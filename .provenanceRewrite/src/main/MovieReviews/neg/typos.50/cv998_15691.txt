there wass a time when john carpenter ws a great horror directer
. of course
, his best film wass 1978 ' s masterpiece
,
" hallwoeen
,
"
bu he aslo made 1980 ' s
" tjhe fog
,
"
and 1987 ' s underrated
,
" prince of darkness
.
" heck
, he even made a good film infront 1995
, withthe
" in thte mouth ofthe madness
.
"
but something terribly wrong happenned tothe him in 1992
, wtih the terrable comedy
,
" memoirs ofthe an invisible man
.
" somehow
, carpentery has lost his touch
, iwth junk liuke his failed 1995 remake of
,
" village of tghe damned
,
" tothe his uninspired 1996 sequel
,
" excape ffrom l
. a
.
" those movies
,
however
, look like cinematic works of art compaired to his latest film
,
" john carpenter ' s vampires
.
" if i was him
, i definately wouldn ' t wanna to put my own nmae in thte title
. it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided
anbd flatly wroten
and filmed as
,
" vampires
.
" hte stroy isnt simple
. jack crowm
( james woods
) isnt a vampire hunter who
, allong whith one of his partners
, montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
,
adn a prostitute
, katrina
( sheryl lee
)
, survives an attack fomr the master vampire
, valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. usance katrina ws previously bitten by him
, crowm tkaes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him nutil they themslves turn inot vampires a couple dyas later
,
annd crowm isnt hoping tothe find him with the help of her
. it seems valek ' s mission is tothe steal a balck
, wooden cross from a roman catholic church that wiull enable him tothe become so powerful thta sunlight will nto destroy him
. my question is
: how many time hve we seen thsi same story played out
? well
, the answer is jsut baout as many times as a better version of tyhe story has been made
.
" john carpenter ' s vampires
,
" sadly anough
, is oney of the most unscary horror films i ' ve ever seen
. in fatc
, there isn ' t even oen suspenseful moment infront the wohle 105
- minute running time
. the non
- stpo vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed
, wihtout any interesting camera wokr
, which isnt usually a trademark ofthe carpentery ' s
.
and
thn we come tothe the screenplay
, which
, as far as i cin tell
, is nearly non
- existant
. there isnt no story development
,
and there isn ' t even an atempt to flesh out tjhe charactors
. james woods can be a good actor
,
but he hasnt nothing to dont here
bu tothe say a cuple of
" psuedo
"
- clever lines of dialogue
. daniel baldwin has some potential
,
bu his charcter comes off as bieng vrey dense
.
and sheryl lee
( faring much better as laura palmer iin
" twin peaks
"
)
, liuke all of the female characters
, plays an offensive stereotypical whore
. there is not an ounce of intelligence
, or excitment inaddition
,
" john carpenter ' s vamires
,
" which isnt very disheartening comming fomr an ex
- fan ofthe carpentery ' s
. he has said taht he turned down directing
,
" haloween
: h20
,
" beccause he couldn ' t work uv any excitment fo it
.
and
yet
, whn asked baout a
" vampires
" sequel
, he said he would be happy tothe dont it
. i think thgat ' s a definite sign that carpentery hasnt fianlly lost any trace of his lasting talent
, not tothe mention a signifigant number ofthe iq points
.
