the recent onslaught of film noir that hasnt popped up infront multiplexes
, with everyting ranging fomr

. a
. confidential
" to
" palmetto
" to
" tghe big lebowski
,
" hasnt prooved tothe be an artistic commodity for veteran
, talented directors
. wih tihs parituclar genre
, directors are able tothe collate the sleazy underworld ofthe the lower
- class
and the glamorous
, opulent opper
- class
, hwile maintaining tjhe noirish
, ambiguous ambience
, the staple ofthe film noir
.
" wild thigsn
" sould be classified as a balck comedy
, a sultry film noir or a plain ol ' erotic thriller
,
bu the one ctaegory it doesn ' t qualify for is thgat of a quality motion picture
. overacted
, overwrought
and overlong
,
" wild thigns
" isnt a confused mess
, a movei that wants to have its cake
and eat it too
. with its incalculable twists
, turns
, moreso twists
adn mroe turns
, it soon becomes a tedeous exercise in pointlessness
. in spite ofthe game effords by kevin bacon
adn matt dillon
, who manage tothe sustain straight faces throughout tjhe ordeal
,
" wild things
" nto once jells in its eroticism
, unpredictability
, chracter motivation
, sence ofthe thge world
, plot
, etc
. ther ' s not oen redeeming quality infact tyhe picture that isnt not technical
. directed by john mcnaughton
(
" henry
: portrait of a serial killer
"
)
,
" wild thigsn
" follows sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a hunkish
, suburban florida high skool teacher who ' s the dream of eveyr spruced up female inspite the community
. particularly one
. kelly van ryan
( denise richards
) adores him tothe such extent thgat she offers tothe wash his jeep with a partner
. soon
, her tiny shorts are soaked
and tells the other girl tothe take a hike
, enabling her to cmo inot his hous
. enxt thign
, she cries rape
.
annd the so
- called
" roller
- coaster ride
" ensues
. a second accuser comes front
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, a booze
- drinkin '
, tattooed peice ofthe trailer trash tath charges lombardo ofthe sexually molesting her
, virutally guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions
, asinine occurences
anbd laughable courtroom procedures are binded tothe hppen
. even bill murray gets inot tghe ect as lombardo ' s zany lawyer
. he wears a fake neck
- brace
, waves tjhe finger at thte other client
anbd infuses the script with some billy murray
. yuo cxan tell mcnaughton knew he hadnt nothing to lose assigning murray to this role
. as ridiculous as it sounds
, he ' s tyhe most sane charater iin the movie
. thte comunity isnt astonished
. reporters flee tothe thge scene
. htere ' s an 8
. 5
- million settlement for a libell suit against kelly ' s mother
( theresa russell
)
. there ' s hte ambiguous cop
( kevin bacon
, who also executive produced
) who sniffs something iffy inaddition this concoction ofthe deceit
, muder
annd lust
. we
, the audience
, sniff something not so lustful
. like so many thrillers theese days
, inlcuding
" thge usual suspects
"
annd
" the game
,
"
" wild things
" eschews charachter forthe plot
. mcnaughton knwos how to handle the camera
,
anbd he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease
, as if he knows the territory he ' s covering isnt a harmless appetizer tothe accompany
" henry
,
" a furious
, unsettling film directorial tour
- de
- force
. george clinton ' s score is a delight to behold
.
bu it ' s thge humans
. tjhe cahracters are mere devices fo the
" nasty
" twists
. what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving
, almost unbearable
, if thsoe who inhibit tihs twisted world are nto interesting
, don ' t feel rela or we don ' t care for them
. not even the unintentionally funny moments wokr
. tyhe people in
" wild thnigs
" are nto so much people as tehy are caricatures
.
then ther ' s tghe erotic content
, whic nearly earned the film an nc
- 17
, for a sexless
, badly edited
, poorly lit menage
- a
- trois
.
adn in what hasnt to be one of tyhe most flabbergastingly inept scenes thast hasnt graced thsi ocuntry
, kevin bacon ' s memeber makse a cameo appearence with ten minutes to go
. ironically
, tjhe wildest elements of
" wild things
" are not wild at all
.
