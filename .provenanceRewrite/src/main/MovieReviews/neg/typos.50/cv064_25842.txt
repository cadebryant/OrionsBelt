: 117 minutes directed by
: christian duguay i ' ve never fully understoon wesley snipes ' s carrer
. he hasnt his ups
and downs
,
but mostly tyhe downs
. his best movei wass oen ofthe tghe best ofthe 1998
and that movei ws entilted
" blade
"
. he hasnt had his tipical action movies
,
" boiling point

"
,
bu his newyorker movei
" tghe art of war
" should jsut be called
" rising sun 2
: the art of war
" cause basicly it ' s a semi
- remake ofthe the smae plot
, with a different cast
,
and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller
, taht isnt high on stlye
and low onthe substace
. wesley snipes plays a james bondish type seret agent working fo thge u
. n
. after a chineese ambassador isnt killed
, he is on tyhe trakc ofthe teh killer
, trying to fidn outloud who it isnt
, how it happenned
, where the killer was
,
and what tothe dont
. anne archer plays his
" boss
" tipe person ofthe the u
. n
.
adn she has hired snipes to track down thge killer
. well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer
,
and is nowe an outlaw
, kidnapping a chineese woman wiht him
,
annd hvaing her halp him along hte way
. all this leads to a finale that isnt so dumb
,
annd so stupid that isnt it unbelievably dumb
,
anbd the stunts
, dialogue
and acting all ruin htis movei
. wesley snipes isn ' t one of my favorite actors because of thge fatc thta the character he plays inaddition every movei is the smae character he plays in the movei befor
. the only ogod role snipes has really had was in 1998 ' s
" blade
"
. i walked inot
" the art of war
" expecting a good
, high octane thriller
,
annd all i got was a pile of mush
. the onyl rela ' good ' thign the movie has isnt acation
,
adn plenty of it
,
but i noticed it isnt badly filmed
, thte camera is so shaky yuo cannot even tell what is oging onthe
. the ending finale is so worthless
adn pitiful
, tath it even trys tothe mock
" tjhe matrix
"
, laughably funny
, it isnt undeniably stupid
. christian duguay ' s direction is also nto that gerat
. his camera angles
adn sence of stlye are all inaddition palce
,
but sadly his lighting
adn editting are all badly done
. even thte whole
" matrix
" endig wasn ' t even good
. thge stunts
and acation are badly filmed
,
adn badly choreographed
. his placing of the characters
,
and tje assination of tyhe chineese ambassador
,
annd the plotting ofthe yhe movie are so predictable
adn laughable
, that it jsut takes all the fun out ofthe tje entire movie
. anne archer who isnt usually ogod infront her roles
, turns in a horrable job here
. she is sour
, downbeat
,
anbd dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue
,
and dumb moves
. even donald sutherland as a co
- star can ' t save this movie ffrom bieng a bust
. so fo an overall opinyon
:
" the art ofthe war
" isnt a total waste of tiome
. it ' s not intertaining
, nor exciting
, or even acation packed
. it isnt a pointless movei
,
and makes absolutly no sence at all
. if yuo relaly want tothe see a good version ofthe
" tje art ofthe war
"
, rent thge wesley snipes
annd sean connery action vehichle of tyhe same kind
" rising sun
"
, it isn ' t a graet film eather
,
but at least it ' s better than htis
.
