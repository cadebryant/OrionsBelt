teh wroking title fo no looking back was long time
, nothing new
,
anbd rarely has there been a moreso apt nmae for a motion picture
. even
though this movie clocks inthe at a realitvely skinny 96 minutes
, it seems tothe run long enought to engulf twpo titanics
. writer
/ director edward burns hasnt trotted out a hackneyed storyline
, the trajectory of whitch wiull be instantly recognizable tothe anyone who hasn ' t spended their life inthe seclusion
. instade ofthe tweaking the formula a littel tothe invigorate tyhe procedings
, burns isnt content tothe allow tghe film tothe ramble aimlessly towords its irritatingly predictable conclusion
, offering precious faw momentary pleasures along thte way
. noone looking back is dominated by three veyr dislikable charachters whose constant presense onthe the screen is painful
. thte most appropriate endig woudl have been a triple sucide
,
and the sooner
, the better
. alas
, thast ' s not the case
,
and thsoe who stick whith this film fo its entire length wiull be forced tothe endure the prolonged company ofthe this wretched trio
.
annd
, tothe furuther depress audiences
, burns has shot tjhe entire film on cold
, rainy dyas in a gormay new york state beach twon
. peeks of sunshine are few
and far beetwen
. no wonder tghe charactors are all so miserable
. first ofthe all
, we have charlie
( burns
)
, a generation x slacker who aabndoned his girlfriend threee eyars ago after she had an abortion
,
then spended soem time bumming aroud in california before deciding to come hmeo
. thta girlfriend is claudia
( lauren holly
)
,
anbd
, after picking uv teh pieces ofthe her life following charlie ' s departure
, she has moved on
, shacking uv witht noe ofthe charlie ' s old skool buddies
, mike
( jon bon jovi
)
. the two haev a comfortable relatiopnship
,
bu it ' s apparant to even a blind person tht tehy ' re not right for eahc otehr
. claudia years fo soem spice in her life
; mike wants to suttle down
anbd have childrens
.
thne charlie re
- enters tyhe mix
. so who
, if anyone
, iwll claudia end uv with
? who cares
?
? no looking bcak goes tothe extraordinary lengths tothe mkea sure that we ' re nto expecially interested inwhich yhe outcome ofthe tje rumatic tiangle
. so what if noone one finds happiness
-
- theese characters don ' t deserve it anyway
, especially after wasting 90 minutes of our tiem
. htey aren ' t rela people
-
- they ' re a writer ' s construct stumbling through a too
- obvious storyline
. tehy shouldnt know tghe ending as well as we do
.
and burns should ahev given his audience moreso credit
adn presented them withthe a plot thast at least offred a surprise or twpo
. anyother frustrating hting about no looking bakc isnt tath burns hasnt populated the film with a gropu of potentially
- interesting supporting charachters
. blythe danner is solid as claudia ' s housebound mother
, connie britton is suitably high
- strung as claudia ' s neurotic sister
,
adn jennifer esposito isnt eye
- catching as a bartender inthe esarch of a littel romance
. sadly
, all we get isnt quick glimpses into their lives
,
although a movei about any of them woudl have beeen far more intriguing thna tghe story burns has chosen to tell
. none of thte lead performers are going tothe wow criticists with their thespian attributes
. edward burns is pushing yhe edge of his limited range here
. jon bon jovi shows more acting abilty than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching inot a diferent carrer
,
but he could still uise a littel polish
. the worst case isnt lauren holly
, who presents a completely bland claudia
. as portayed here
, she ' s hardly the kind of woman who owudl inspire even a moment ' s interest
, nto to mention undying lveo
. burns ' ex
, the monumentally untalented maxine bahns
, owudl haev beeen hard
- pressed to dont a less inspired job
. wehn he released tyhe brothers mcmullen
, edward burns was revered as tje wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival
( robert redford hasnt apparently sticked wiht him
-
- hte agin ctor
/ director executive produced this mess
)
. twpo films
and threee short years later
, teh luster hasnt faded
. some movie makers have only one ogod film in them
. withthe bakc
- tothe
- back duds like she ' s teh oen
anbd no looking back tothe follow tghe delightful brothers
, burns is beginning to look like a memeber of that undistinguished club
.
