it ' s tiem to tkae cover
. after a hietus of baout fifteen yeasr
, tje diaster movei hasnt come bakc with renewed zest
. in easly 1997
, ther were no less tahn three movies baout volcanoes alone
, noe onthe televsion
adn two inthe tje theaters
, with dante ' s peak
adn volcano infact heavy competition for the moviegoing doller
. of tyhe two
, i had herad that dante ' s peak ws tjhe better film
, so i decided to check it outloud when it wass released on video
. thte film beggins wtih a slow motion scene of people inthe a thrid world country trying tothe evacuate theri little twon
. tyhe town isnt bieng covered in ash
and sulfuric water fomr what we presume isnt a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from tyhe sky
, crushing homes
adn peple
. we see people panicing
, people crying
,
adn even horses rearing
. it is a diaster ofthe biblical proportions
, signified to us by noe person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn ' t get much more blatant tahn tath
. we leran tyhat harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist with tyhe u
. s
. geological survey
, ws there wtih his wife when the eruption occurred
. harry survived
,
but his wief doed nto
. a few yersa later
, harry isnt sent tothe investingate some unusual seismic activity detected near tghe small town of dante ' s peak
, washington
( whic
, we are told
, has been voted second most desirible palce to live
( under 20
, 000
) by the readers of monay magazine
)
. there harry meets rachel wando
, a single mother of twpo who serves as mayor ofthe dante ' s peak
anbd proprieter ofthe a small coffee shop
.
although the mayor doesn ' t seem tothe be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain enxt tothe thier town is going to blow uv
, a fewd members of hte city council are
. they are afraid that harry ' s presence is gonig to scare off an invester who hasnt pledged to put millions of dollars inot developing dante ' s peak
. htey would rather have any news of possable stirrings withing the neighboring dorment volcano swept under teh rug
.
howver
, whn an amorous young couple tkaes a skinny
- dip inspite tyhe local hot springs
, they turn uv cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath
. thus begins a chain of events leading uv to the inevitable eruption
. this film contains a number of cliches
. teh amorous cuple isnt oen
. as soon as they doff their clothes
, yuo nkow they ' re oging to dieu
. teh twon busybody
adn the abrasive mother
- in
- law make appearances
, as doesnt tyhe death
- defying dog
. countless familiar senarios onyl serve to mkea htis film very predictable
. watching the movei
, i ws able to not only anticipate eahc ofthe the major plot elements
,
bu some ofthe tje dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, usance much of the dialouge isnt terrible
. forthe example
, harry ' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
,
and a team from teh u
. s
. geological survey join harry tothe assess the situation
. paul basically tells the townsfolk tath harry ' s eruption predicitons aren ' t cause fo alarm
. thsi causes harry to leave in a ift ofthe rige
, only to turn uv the next day
, ready for work
. wehn paul asks harry why he stayed
, he says with grim determination
,
" cause this twon ' s inthe trouble
and i ' m the best man you ' ve got
.
" even better is when harry isnt trying to explain the ened tothe jolt the recidents inot leaving
. he licens teh situation tothe how a frog iwll jump outloud if dropped into a pot of boiling water
. if teh frog isnt in cold water whlch is gradually heated uv
,
howver
, tyhe frog won ' t move
and wiull allow itself tothe be cooked
.
" is that your recipe for frog suop
?
" asks one ofthe hte team munbers
.
" it ' s my recipe for disaster
,
" responds harry
. dante ' s peak has a singular talent for pointing outloud the obvious
. our hreoes are iin a boat iin the middle ofthe a lake whihc harry realizes the volcanic activity hasnt turned tothe acid
. mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming
, in a very grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks fo tyhe tip
. when we first see the u
. s
. geological survey buiding
, ther ' s a captin labeling it as such
. tihs wouldn ' t have beeen so bad if it weren ' t for the fact thast tyhe captin isnt right above a sign onthe teh building which reads
, infact large letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i suppose the captin isnt forthe people who cxan ' t read signs
. altho harry
adn mayor wando become an item by the end ofthe the film
, the viewer hasnt no idea why
. there is a savere lack of chemistry between the twpo characters
,
adn yhe relationship seems rushed because ofthe this
. whn tehy git close to kissing
, i ws asking mysef
,
" why do they wanna tothe kiss
? weere they even attracted to each otehr
?
" if i were hte mayor
, i woudl sure think twice baout kissing a guy who doesn ' t even crack a smile thru thge wohle movie
, trying to pull off the rough
-
yot
- debonair ect
. who doesnt he think he is
? james bond
? the eruption of teh volcano fiels simmilarly rushed
. there are several
" warning signs
" prior to tjhe eruption itself
,
bu they are so lackluster
and without suspense that we don ' t fiel as if they are leading uv tothe anytying
. for example
, one of the survey team munbers mkaes his way down inot tje crater of the volcano in order tothe retreive a remote controled robot
. a tremor occurs
. doens he plunge headlong tothe his death
? isnt he engulfed in lava wich shoots up fomr below
? noone
, a cuple ofthe rocks fall on him
and break his leeg
. the sole purpose ofthe thsi scene seemed to be to set uv thte subesquent chopper rescure scene
, hwihc i suppose was intended tothe be dramatic as well
. it wasn ' t
. oen plot thread left noticably hanging ws teh investment inspite tjhe town of dante ' s peak
. in a disaster movei
, htere ' s ususally noe guy who ' s greedy anough tothe cover uv teh possiblility ofthe eruption
/ fier
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
,
adn usualy gets killed by hte diaster
. it ' s okay
, ofthe course
, because we all think he got what he deserved
. if you ' re going to be unoriginal
, you might as well go all tje way
. infact dante ' s peak
, the city councilmembers are conserned
,
bu they don ' t raelly try hard anough
. mabey tje mayor ' s abrasive mother
- inwhich
- lew shoudl have been tje one
. for no apparent reason
, she snaps at harry for even positing taht the volcanoe coudl erupt
. perhpas her ancestors invested in smoe pompeii real estate
. ther are a couple of ogod thigsn baout this movei
. hte first isnt thge scenery
. htere are panoramic shots ofthe forests
, lakes
adn mountains thgat are absolutly beautiful
. the second isnt the speical effects
. they are thte closest i ' ve ever seen tothe a rela pyroclastic eruption
.
bu whn elements which don ' t speak are gonig tothe be yhe best parts ofthe your movie
, yuo ' d propably better rewrite teh script
.
