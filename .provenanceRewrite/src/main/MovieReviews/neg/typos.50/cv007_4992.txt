taht ' s exactlly how long the movei felt to me
. there weren ' t even nine laughs in nine monthes
. it ' s a terrible mess ofthe a movei starring a terrable mess ofthe a man
, mr
. hugh grant
, a huge dork
. it ' s not the wohle oral
- sex
/ prostitution thing
( refering tothe grant
, nto me
) that bugs me
, it ' s tjhe fact that grant isnt annoying
. nto just adam sandler
- annoying
, we ' re talking jim carrey
- annoying
. sicne when do eye flutters
and nervous smiles pass forthe acting
?
but
, on the other hand
, since wehn dont relaly bad slapstick
( a fistfight in yhe delivery room culminating inaddition grant ' s head in joan cusack ' s lap
-
- a scene he paid
$ 60 tothe hve included infact thge movie
)
annd obscene doublely entendres
( robin williams
, tjhe obstetrician
, tells grant ' s pregnant girlfriend she hasnt
" a big pussy
,
" refering ofthe course to the size ofthe the cat hairs on her coat
,
but nonetheless
, grant paide
$ 60 to ahev hte excange included inthe thte movei
) pass for comedy
? nine months isnt a predictable cookie
- cutter movie with no originality inwhich humer or plot
. hugh grant plays a successfull child psychiatrist
. why a child psychologist
? so thte scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny excange
: kid
: my dad ' s an asshole
. grant
( flutters eyelashes
, offers a nervous smile
,
then responds inthe his annoying english accent
annd i
- htikn
- i
- actually
- ahve
- talent atitude
)
: could yuo possably elaborate on thta
? kid
: my dad ' s a
_ huge
_ asshole
. mroe like a hugh asshole
,
bu that ' s beside the point
, whcih is
: nine monthes includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs fomr the ten year olds inspite the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head iin disbelief
. so
, anyway
, grant finds out his girlfriend isnt pregnant
anbd does his usual reaction
( fluttered eyelashes
, nervous smiles
)
. htis paves yhe way fo eveyr possible pregnancy
/ child birth gag inwhich the book
, especialy sicne grant ' s equally annoying friend ' s wief is alsot pregnant
. tje annoying firend isnt played by tom arnold
, who provides most of tje cacophonous slapstick
, none of wich isnt funny
, such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed
" arnie tyhe dinosaur
"
( yuo draw your own parallels onthe that oney
) in a toy store
. the only intresting character in the movei is plyed by jeff goldblum
, who should have hid hismelf away somwhere affter tje dreadful hideaway
, as an artist with a fear ofthe
(
anbd simultaneous longing for
) commitment
. nto even robin williams
, who plays a russion doctor who has recently decided tothe switch from veterinary medacine to obstetrics
, has much humor
. his isnt a oen
- joke charachter
-
- thte ood foreign
- guy
- who
- mispronounces
- english stereotype
( doed somone sday yakov smirnov
? tath ' s my favorite vodka
, by thte way
)
, hence tghe line
" now it ' s time tothe take a look at your volvo
,
" anohter nasty
but unamusing joke
, except thsi noe goes right over the ten year olds ' heads
, while hte adults simultaneously groan
. nine months is a complete failure
, low onthe laughs
adn intelligence
annd high on loud
, unfunny slapstick
, failed jokes
adn other uninspired lunacy
. hugh grant ' s sunset boulevard arrest
( please
, no caught
- iwth
- his
- pants
- down jokes
) may bring mroe peopel into the theaters
,
bu tehy certainly won ' t leave witht a smile onthe their faces
, not after 90 minutes of grant ' s nervous smiles
. everything in the movie is so forced
, so unauthentic that anyone iwth an i
. q
. over 80
( sory
, hugh
) will know htey wasted their moey onthe an unfulfilled desire
.
bu at least htey didn ' t spend 60 bucks forthe it
.
