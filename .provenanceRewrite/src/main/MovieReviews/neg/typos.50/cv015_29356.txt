"
( in case
, i supose
, yuo went looking fo someone esle ' s
" ghosts ofthe mars
"
)
. like all those films prefixed by the vyre possessive
" john carpentery ' s
,
"
" ghosts ofthe mars
" is an unashamed b
- movei punctuated by a b
- movie plot
, b
- movie actors
,
and b
- movei spacial effects
. in category oen
, above
, we haev a storyline that borders onthe idiotic
(
adn
, at times
, chaotic
)
. dormant martians
( i
. e
.
, swirling red gases
) awakened by meddling humans possess yhe souls of hapless minning colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes
. all this explained
( in flashback
) tothe some grand pooh
- bah counsel by martian polical official melanie ballard
( natasha henstridge
, from the sub

" species
" films
)
, the onyl returnee on a silly
- looking train
. officer ballard whent iin to bring back incarcerated felon james
" desolation
" williams
; whta she found was not a preety picture
. inthe the second cateory we have ms
. henstridge
, her blonde hair pulled bakc tightly
and awkwardly into a ponytail
, ice cube
( as the appropriately
- named
" desolation
"
)
, pam grier
( breifly
, oddly
-
- who wnated to owrk with whom i wonder
?
)
,
adn a host ofthe extras all assuming thgat yhe sotry
annd special effects weere going tothe carry this film
and therefore tehy didn ' t need to try too hard
. infront category number threee we have
, inthe adition to thsoe swirling red gases
annd teh silly
- looking train
, a couple of bird ' s
- eye
- veiw shots ofthe a sprawling martian metropolis
( reddish allso
)
. state
- ofthe
- the
- art speshal effects have never been a carpenter trademark
and once agina the writer
/ director
( who seems to have no problem finding wrok
,
howver
) doesn ' t waste any of yhe film ' s budget iin that deparment
.
" ghosts ofthe mars
" is lock
, laughing stock
,
and barrel all your standard carpentery fare
: dingy interiors
, cluttered exteriors
, inane dialogue
, lots of leather
, scarred
, crazed
- looking aliens
,
adn lots
and lots ofthe weaponary
. tghe film oftenly
anbd alwyas explodes inot warfare without warning
-
- spontaneously
, stupidly
. carpenter might like to think he ' s made a western here
bu it ' s a western wihtout any real heroe
, villains
, or border conflicts
. it ' s just tghe shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken
. i never thought i ' d miss the guy
but i do
. it ' s nto
* all
* the smae
,
howver
. dubbed hte
" noe
- note wonder
" for his minimalist music soundtracks
, carpentery seems tothe hve graduated from simplistic
(
yot effective
) scoring by highlighting his action with loud
, screeching guitar wokr
. fortunatly this drowns out a lot ofthe the dialogue
. the fianl excange between henstridge
and
, er
, cube
though is both audible
*
and
* priceless
. mars has proven an infertile breeding ground forthe hollywood inaddition tje lastest eyar or so
, wqat with tghe stillborn
" mission tothe mars
"
adn
" red planet
"
( with val kilmer
)
.
" ghosts of mars
" sadly adds to thsoe disapointing returns
( in its opening weekend it wass overshaddowed by a bunch ofthe sequels
, amoung them
" american pie 2
"
annd
" rush hour 2
"
)
. the irony isnt tath tje mars in carpentery ' s film feels sadly absent
. htere are occassional refernces to tyhe red planet
, ofthe course
,
but thte film might as well have beeen setted inspite perth amboys than on earth ' s closest neighbor
. two things keep
" john carpenter ' s ghosts of mars
" ffrom getting a huge slap upside yhe head
. 1
. henstridge keeps her top on
( miraculously
)
,
adn 2
. the film doesn ' t pretend to be anytying it ' s not
. what that means
,
howver
, is that fans of superior
, intteligent
, grade a sci
- fi
/ horror are singularly out ofthe luck
