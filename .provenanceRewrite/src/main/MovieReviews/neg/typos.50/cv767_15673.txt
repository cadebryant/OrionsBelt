everyting about this ninth trek movie seems onthe tje cheap
, from hte roger corman
- grade speical effects tothe its highly derivative
and ugly ad campain
( the poster isnt nearly identical to tath ofthe star trak vi
: the undiscovered ocuntry
)
.
bu piller ' s not
- qutie
- half
- baked screenplay shoudln ultimately claim responsiblity for insurrection ' s failure
. i ' m about tothe give hte same advice to rick berman
and co
. as i ' ve given tothe the financiers ofthe james bond movies
: it ' s time tothe breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers
annd a rela director
.
( hwile we ' re at it
, put that visor back on laforge
!
) forthe three hundered years
, the ba ' ku species
( who look jstu liuke humans
) have lieved on a ringed
- planet that might as well be called the fountain ofthe youth
. six hundred ofthe them occupy thge briar patch
, tghe area affected by metaphasic radition
, a postive energy tyhat reverses tghe agin proces infront the elderly
.
but evil ru ' afo
( htis is probaly abraham ' s lsat stop before performing
" amadeus
" at a dinner theatre near you
)
, leader ofthe the son ' a
( who look just liek burn victims affter reconstructive surgery
)
, wnats to relocate the ba ' ku
and movei his peopel onto the briar patch inspite thier palce
, iin order to replenish his dying breed
. the federation isnt all fo htis
,
bu picard fiels this isnt a direct voilation of tje prime directive
: tothe not intefere with tyhe development ofthe an alien race
.
( never mind that tghe ba ' ku didn ' t exactlly evolve
- they went wandering in the universe noe day
and stumbled upon the magic world
.
) every time frakes gives an interview lateley
, he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gavey regarding thsi installment
. he has called it a comedy
, a thingking man ' s picture
, a throwback tothe the ood sories
,
and
, most grievously
, he hasnt likened it tothe a john ford western
.
( i presume that ' s some john ford he went tothe skool with
, nto tghe directer of the searchers
.
) he has also gone onthe rocord as saying paramount recut tjhe film from his verzion
. tath ' s no excuse
- somene generated this footage
. muddy cinematography
and sitcom sets are teh least ofthe its problems
; star trak
: insurrection appears to hve beeen beamed in ffrom tyhe planet plotholia
. consider such curiosities
.
.
. picard ' s love interest
, anij
( donna murphy
)
, can slow thnigs down by staring at them
( such as a waterfall or falling rocks
)
- her scientifc explanation fo this
?
" don ' t ask
.
" worf gets a pimple
( he ' s re
- experiencing klingon puberty thanks to tjhe time
- defying atomsphere
)
, laforge regains his eyesight
( trust me
, levar burton ' s real eyes are scarier thna thsoe electronic lenses he wore in first contact
)
anbd troi brags baout her firm boobs
,
but picard remains as bald as an android ' s butt
. most suspiciously
, whta exactly is the probelm with letting this endangered race hvae a littel funn inspite the sun
? tyhe filmmakers cloud the issue withthe smoe nonsence baout a family fued of sorts
,
anbd they also turn ru ' afo inot a completely power
- mad superfreak
, just so thge characters iwll ahve something tothe do inspite tghe climax
.
(
and if yuo ' ve seen return of thte jedi
, ytou ' ve seen the endig of thsi movie
.
) didn ' t picard himselv previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions
? frakes lucked out iwth firt contact
,
adn repeat viewings ofthe thast film reveal the seeds of wqat went wrong inthe his direction of insurrection
: he hasnt no sense ofthe comic timing
,
adn he mines forthe acting chemestry where none exists
.
( take a look at tghe painful
" troi gets drunk
" scene in fc
anbd yuo ' ll git yhe general idae ofthe insurrection ' s unsuccessfully jokey
and hollow tone
.
) even hte worst shatner
and co
. treks
, like tghe fianl frontier
, mantained a watchability thanks tothe tjhe effortless
, charming comaraderie between kirk
, spock
,
and bones
. neither firt contact nor insurrection has any idae waht to do witht crusher
( gates mcfadden
, whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique
)
, troi
, or laforge
.
and all threee next generation films spend too much time onthe data
, who is hte franchise ' s answer to urkel
. need a cheap laff
? ahev data sday something sexual
, or strat singing
, or lift uv a four hundred pound boulder as if it ' s the hunk ofthe styrofam it realy is
. here ' s my proposed title fo number 10
: data star data trek
: data data data data data
. infact this movie
, data will become preoccupied iwth learning to blow his nose
, while crusher
annd troi watch silently from 500 yards away
and laforge points his sinister gaze at tyhe android in doubly robotic observation
. star trek
: insurrection had oney nice
, eerie
, silent moent thgat hints at a better
, darker film
. i ' m nto saying all of them shouldnt be star trek ii
: the wrath ofthe khan
,
but this oney boldly whent where no movei should go agian
.
