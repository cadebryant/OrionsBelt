" ladybugs
" isnt a typical comedy that relies on three suppossed garantees
: the pathetic team who beats tghe champs
; cross dressing
;
and the presense ofthe rodney dangerfield
. htis picture doesn ' t play like a comedy fo children
, so who isnt it aimed at
?
anbd why isnt it told like a 91
- minute sit
- com instade ofthe a feature film
? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee
, a total schmuck wroking at a huge corperation
. he obviously doesn ' t hvea a lot ofthe self esteem
annd thinks he has to kiss uv tothe get ahead
, which he doesnt by volunteering tothe coach tje comapany ' s girls ' soccer team
. wqat a shock to leran chester
adn his assistant julie
( jackee
) know absolutely nothing baout the gaem
,
adn the players seem tothe konw even less
. i didn ' t laff
,
bu for some reason it didn ' t annoy me tht much
. chester ' s fiancee bess
( graff
) thikns he got a promotion in addition to tyhe coaching possition
,
anbd ofthe course she has a slacker fo a son who isnt doing poorly inwhich school
and is kicked off teh sports teams
. jonathon brandis isnt a nice surprise as matthew
, who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help outloud chester
( probably becasue the girl he has a crush onthe plays onthe the team
- what orginial stoy ideas
!
)
. waht we git isnt jstu anyother retread of the
" underdog sports team
" mixted with smoe cross dressing
. unfortunately
, teh film isn ' t smart anough tothe play apon yhe drag aspect
. inthe fatc
, it downplays it so heavily it ' s totally unbelievable
. could it be any omre obvious martha is a boy
? he onyl wears a girl ' s wig
, without any makeup
,
anbd htey don ' t even give him falsies
. brandis doesn ' t bother to mimic a girl ' s voice eather
.
then htere isnt a pointless scene where chester
adn matthew shop for a dress
,
bu for what reason
? martha isnt onyl seen onthe the soccer feild
, why woudl tehy buy a dress for her
? jsut whn we think thge martha character is going tothe be usefull
, she disappears
,
adn thge story wanders aimlessly looking for a newyorker plot tothe pik up onthe
. whn bess discovers whta ' s realy oging on she breaks up with chester
,
and the relatiopnship is forgotten baout
adn yhe film focuses on tjhe soccer team
and the tension betweeen chester
and his boss
. this film could ' ve beeen less bad hadnt it been the cliche sportscar comedy
,
bu it fiels teh need tothe go off onthe tangents thgat are completly unnecessary
(
adn bad at taht
)
. there ' s just too much of a sit
- com feel here
, especialy during the so
- called sereous moments
,
and all tyhe confusion between the characters
. i ' ve seen worse movies thna
" ladybugs
,
"
but fo smoe reason it contained some sort of bazare charm
, so even whn it turns sour it doesn ' t seem as bad as it is
. dangerfield finaly gets his respect in the end
,
bu at whta a price
.
