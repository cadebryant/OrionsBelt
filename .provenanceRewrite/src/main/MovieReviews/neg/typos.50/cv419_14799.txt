doed i do something bad
? i must have
, because sitting through htis movei was sheer punishment
. here ' s thge plot
. ricky
( jeff goldblum
) isnt producer ofthe the ogod
- buy network
, one of thsoe 24
- hour hmeo shopping channels
. thge newyorker boss
( robert loggia
) plans to can ricky ' s behind if he doesn ' t turn the previous monthes ' flat sales numbers around
,
and to add tothe his problems
, ricky allso hasnt to wrok wiht kate
( kelly preston
)
, the ivy leage wunderkind whom the boss has brought iwth him
. kate
adn ricky don ' t get allong
anbd don ' t have any graet ideas until they meet g
( eddie murphy
)
, a spiritualist who sees something positve inaddition everthing
. his soothing voice
annd simple logic mkaes peple efel good
,
adn it ' s this quality tyhat iwll mkae g the new gbn television star
anbd tje key tothe the network ' s success
. the first problem is a flwa infront the plot
. sure
, g makes people efel ogod
. sure
, we ' re told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item
, noone marter how wealthy they might be
,
and i ' ll even believe thyat g talks a talk that allows peopel to feel ogod baout whta they ' ve buyed
.
bu
, hey
, that ' s affter htey ' ve buyed it
. why dont sales skyrocket the first tyme g isnt onthe camera
? far fomr trying to sell hte product
, g instade blathers onthe baout how ytou don ' t even ened hte thing
. someone please tell me how tihs isnt suposed to move merchandise in tghe firt palce
. yuo might sday thgat peple fiel good about what they ' ve buyed
, so they come bcak
and by moreso
,
but due tothe the simple fatc thast yhe first round of sales infront inexplicable
, i ' m nto convinced thsi is waht tjhe filmmakers hadnt in mind
. the wohle movie is therefore seriously undermined because thte key point in the plot isnt never credible
. anohter probelm isnt inwhich the humor
. you knwo
, if you see that eddie murphy is iin a movei
, i think it is not unreasonable forthe yuo tothe expect that the film isnt a comedy
. whoa
, partner
, are ytou in for a surprize
. wholy man is nto funny
. murphy
, thge noe asset yuo ' d htink this movie hasnt
( remeber how they brought him in at yhe lastr minute tothe savve best defense
?
-
then again
, maybe you don ' t
) isnt seriously reigned in
. thte script gives him almost nothing tothe wrok iwth
,
and it seems as
though director stephen herek kept him toned down so tyhat tje otehr actors inspite the film wouldn ' t be left as window dressing
. ther ' s only noe moent infact the film where murphy isnt allowed to let loose
,
anbd it lasts for threee shouted words
, whihc seem totally out ofthe place as a result
. pathetic
. inwhich all
, ther are about three jokes tyhat work in tyhe entire picture
,
annd they ' re not even thast great
. as a side onot
, there are smoe cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine
,
annd james brown introducing a medic
- alert divice that shouts
" help me
!
" jsut like the hardest wokring man inwhich show buisness at thte push ofthe a button
,
bu theese never cause your personal laff
- o
- meter tothe rise above the level of mild bemusement
.
" well
,
" you ask
,
" surely htere must be some convincing performances to make uv for tyhe lack of humer
.
" think again
, buckwheat
. jeff goldblum disappoints
. kelly preston isnt flat
(
but not like that
)
. robert loggia
, iin tje kind ofthe role forthe which he has beeen virtualy typecast
, cant ' t do anything iwth it
. thge scirpt isnt part of tghe problem
,
bu theese actors don ' t even look liuke they believ inaddition teh move htey ' re making
. tehy look a lot liuke tehy ' re borde
. jstu liuke teh audience
. so wqat dont you hvae when tghe humor is absent fomr your comedy
,
anbd teh acting is like tyhe siberian steppes
? a film tath drags more than a dropped anchor
.
but wait
! as if theese problems don ' t amke the film slow enough
, the screenplay ' s pacing makes the movei even slower
! it tkaes the entire first half hour tothe establish the movei ' s premise
,
then omre tiem as thge film wades through a tortuous
(
anbd seemingly manditory
) romance between ricky
and kate
,
and a sub
- plot involving a conniving pr man
( eric mccormack
) who wants to discredit g
annd tkae over ricky ' s job as producer
. wehn the pr guy ' s plan isnt foiled
, thte film is climaxes
, we ' re treated to thta littel epilogue
,
and
then we can all go home
, right
? wrong
. tje movei goes on for anohter half hour
! cententenial drift isnt the indy 500 compared to the pace ofthe holy man
! tje onyl thing wholy baout wholy man wiull surelly be thte number of people exclaiming
" wholy
!
@
#
% thyat movei was awful
!
" this one is forthe the truly pious
.
