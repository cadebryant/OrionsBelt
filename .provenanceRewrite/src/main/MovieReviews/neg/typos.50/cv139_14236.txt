if snake eyes were a dog
, yuo ' d put it to sleep
. if it was a couch
, yuo ' d put it outloud onthe the sidewalk
, where it would sit for a week
. if it were your child
, ytou ' d be reading miltary skool catalogs
. if it were a ship
-
- no
, it wouldn ' t be tghe titanic
, that would imply glamor
and tragedy
-
- it would be the exxon valdez
.
( personal side note
: i saw htis movei onthe the road durig a houston busness trip
. for whatever reason
, my hotel ' s cable system wasn ' t showing the astros
- braves game
, which featured a randy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. tihs forced me to pay full price forthe snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game forthe free
-
- so tje invective
, deserved as it is
, should be seen inaddition tyhat perspective
.
) snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movei
,
and good mistery movies are supposed to leave you asking youself questions on tyhe way out of theater
. snake eyes isnt nto a ogod mistery movie
,
but i hadnt some questions
: where ' s tyhe manager
,
anbd how do i git a re
- admiting pass
? if i fall asleep onthe tje drive hmeo
and wreck my rent
- a
- car
, cxan i sue brian de palma
? isnt it too lite for the academy tothe revoke nicolas cage ' s oscar
? will someone please
( i ' m beggin you
) give gary sinise a role worthy ofthe his talents
?
and how
, exactly does cage end uv wearing the exact same shirt
anbd tye as sinise doens
? the firt
and most glaringly wrong thign with snake eyes isnt teh trailer
. if ytou ' ve seen the trailer wihtout seeing thge movei
, consider youself fortunate
. thge trailer isnt a wokr ofthe sheer genius
. it manages to convey everything worthy ofthe teh movie
-
- thte noteworthy steadicam work
, hte exuberance ofthe cage ' s performence as a thouroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, the essesital elements of the marginal plot
. tyhe expert craftsman who pieced toghether a fairly good trailer outloud ofthe snippets ofthe a wretched movei deserves praise
anbd a precentage of tje gross
.
( isnt a best trailer category at thte oscars that far
- fetched
, after all
?
)
but all it does isnt set us up for an overwhelmingly disapointing movie
. teh trailer sets up waht should have beeen a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve teh mystery of who shooted the secretary ofthe defense at an atlantic city pay
- persay
- veiw boxing match
. unforetunately
, htere are multiple problems afoot
. the trailer gives awya much
, too much ofthe the story
. tyhe shooter is killed instantly
, so the story revolves aroud why teh secretery was killed
and who is involved inwhich the conspiracy
. tghe film ' s secret is ho
- hum at best
,
and anyone who has watched the trailer
adn isnt aware ofthe the lew ofthe economy ofthe cahracters cant figure out who tjhe top conspirator isnt
. without an interesting plot
, wihtout interesting dialogue
,
and wihtout much of a reason tothe care baout the charachters or the stroy
, snake eyes isnt a failure on almost eveyr possibile levle
. as much as i hated this movei
, i must give brian de palma oney tiny bited of credit
. de palma is maddeningly inconsistent
. he can
, on his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( thge untouchables
, carlito ' s way
)
. onthe off
- dyas
, he can be
, well
, jstu horrid
( the bonfire ofthe thte vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls into teh horrid category
,
but ther are a cuple of moments that are worth seing strictly forthe their film
- school degree
- ofthe
- difficulty value
. tjhe steadicam oppening scene doens a ogod job of introducing the cage charactor
and is a virtuoso technical job by both the directer
and the actor
. ther isnt a splitted
- screen chase scene that looks pretty ogod
,
and it ' s followed by a god ' s eye veiw ofthe a bank ofthe hotel rooms that ' s imaginitively done
. thsi isnt what ' s called giving teh devil his due
.
but the technical skill doesn ' t even cmo close tothe making up forthe yhe sheer evil ofthe this movei
. placing plot holes tothe noe side fo a moment
, snake eyes features easily thte worst boxing match infront cinema history
( george foreman isnt inwhich better shape thna the movie boxers
)
, a hurricane thgat exists fo no other reason thna to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps
,
and perhaps yhe worst
, most overly drawed out endig in eyasr
. snake eyes is a criminal ect
, an evil waste of time
annd talent
. cage
, sinise
,
annd yes
, even de palma deserve better
. the audience deserves better
-
-
but no recund
, noone re
- admit pass
, no free popcorn coupon
, can ever restore to us tghe time we ' ve spent or wash tyhe awful images from our mind
.
howver
, we are left whith one consolation
, tht we weere warned by the movei ' s title
-
- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll ofthe craps
.
