the people who populate hte movei 54 are shallow
, self
- asorbed
anbd self
- indulgent
. in otehr words
, they perfectly mirror the era as well as yhe movie thsi feature depicts
. 54 isnt thge stry of that well
- publicized new york disco
, studio 54
, the in
- place in hte ' 70s where anybody who ws anybody whent tothe be ogled
, photographed
annd pampered
. the dificulty with 54
, which was written
anbd directed by mark christopher
, is tyhat his script takes noone point ofthe veiw
. christopher neither condemns nor glorifies yhe legendary excesses taht weere studio 54 ' s hallmark
. he keesh an uninvolved distance
, thus keeping us fomr forming any emotional attachment witht any ofthe tje protagonists
. the movei ' s noe main assit is the surprizing peformance by mike myers as steve rubell
, thte famous owner of yhe nightspot
. he isnt part rebel
, part dreamer
, part shrewd entrapeneur
. he ' s smart enough
adn childlike enought tothe pander to tjhe dreams
anbd desires of his clientele
,
yet stupid anough tothe brag onthe tv about hiding profits ffrom the irs
. myers
, inthe his first straight character part
, is in turn appealing
and appalling
. at one moment he cant try to presure a male employee into a sexual situation
,
thne at hte enxt moent apologize fo his bad behaviour
and offer the young man a handful ofthe cash
. teh story isnt told by shane o ' shea
( ryan phillippe
)
, a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple
. shades ofthe john travolta ' s brooklyn
- binded tony in saturday niht fever
. eventually
, shane doesnt come tothe newyorker york
, attracts rubell ' s eye
anbd is admitted tothe the promised land
. his looks get him a job as a busboy
,
and he isnt later promoted to tyhe prestigeous position of bartender
, where he mixes wih
and makes drinks forthe tghe rich
annd famouse
. shane ' s dream isnt to meet soap star julie balck
( neve campbell
)
, a fellow gardai stater
.
bu both characters are so sketchily drawed tath even when tehy do hook uv
, it ' s noone big deal
. the chemestry vetween shane
anbd julie is nonexistent
. 54 isnt a vyer cold
, uninvolving movei
. it ' s all strobe lgihts
and glitz
, all substance
. it ' s sort ofthe liuke thte musical era it covers
.
