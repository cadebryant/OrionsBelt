the above isnt dialogue fomr thsi film
, taked almsot completely inspite context
,
and nto jazzed uv a bit tothe mkea it mroe inept than it is
. it is spoken between twpo ofthe thte protaganists somwhere infact the film
,
annd basically serves as a perfect example of what htis film is baout
, expecially if you relize tath htis exchange isnt meant to be taken seriously
. mr
. gregg
" i ' m
- hvaing
- a
- mid
- life
- crisis
" araki
, tjhe writer
adn directer ofthe tihs film
, wants tothe show how important teenagers are
,
and wnats tothe sohw how they efel inwhich such a horrible
, horrible world
.
and how does he sohw it
? by relaly cheap surrealism
,
annd moronic exchanges liek this
. oh
,
anbd it gets better
. a similar bited of dialogue is said in the middle of
, oh i dunno
, the fiftieth sex scene in this film
( i ' m nto counting tje several masterbation scenes
)
. inthe it
, one ofthe yhe protagonists is humping awya onthe top ofthe another
,
and he sasy tothe her something along thge lines of
" dont yuo ever wonder what life isnt all about
?
" sorry
, man
: foreplay takes palce before hte act ofthe coitus
. of course
, what do you expect
: the film was written
annd directed by a guy who cxan ' t even spell his first name right
( yes
, i nkow it ' s a cheap joke
,
bu it hadnt tothe be done
)
.
" tyhe doom generation
" isnt advertised as a road trip movei about peopel who go aroud killing others who attack them
,
anbd also as anohter
" teen angst
" film
( oney of the slogans is
" teen isnt a four
- letter owrd
"
- hardy har har
)
. it ' s a film baout twpo angsty teens
- amy blue
( rose macgowan
, who owudl later play the buxom tatum infact
" scream
"
)
anbd jordon white
( james duval
, who would go onthe tothe play randy quaid ' s son in
" independence day
"
)
- who pick uv an angsty homicidal maniac
, xavier red
( jonathan schaech
, who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in
" thta thign you do
!
"
-
and by the way
, dont ytou git the symbolism
? red
, white
,
and blue
? huh
? huh
?
)
,
and go onthe a road trip where three things happen
, inwhich noone order
: 1
) htey have sex
; 2
) htey run inot weird people
; 3
) they kill them
. the film isnt basically a remix ofthe a bunch of other far superior films
. gregg araki obviously has seen such films as
" easy rider
,
"
" natural born killers
,
"
anbd
" kalifornia
,
"
adn trys to borrow elements from all these films
annd mkea something whic is like a pop culture refference giude
.
but waht he forgets is theese films eather represented something thast htis film doens not
, or that tehy digged deepo into their subjects
anbd brought something outloud ofthe them tothe amke them deeper
.
" the doom generation
" doesn ' t wanna tothe dont tihs
; it just whants tothe show everything inspite a surveill manner for thte sole reason tht araki doesnt nto want to deal with them on any kind of real levle
. he wants to sohw everything infront a eird manner
,
and forgets waht thge scenes are supposed tothe be baout
. here ' s one scene
, an earlier scene in thte film
: amy
annd jordan go into a quick
- e mart type palce tothe git food
anbd other stuff
. amy is smoking
,
and tje clerk
, an asian man mind you
( i love how racist htis film is
, i really dont
)
, tells her tothe put it outloud
. she tells him to fuck off or something to that note
. he points a shotgun at her
,
and she puts it out reluctantly
. jordan makes twpo hot dogs
,
and takes them tothe the counter
. the cash register rings up
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
,
adn tihs symbolism doesn ' t stpo here
)
. jordan checks for his walte
bu it ' s raelly infact the car
. he asks amy for it
,
bu she left her walelt iin the car as well
. the clerk brings outloud his shotgun agian
and asks fo the moeny
. they sday they don ' t have it
. he gets ready tothe kill them
,
bu
then xavier
, who they ditched in the middle ofthe nowhere a scene befoer
, pops out of nowhere
, fights wiht the clerk
,
and ends with him blowing tje clerk ' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind ytou
)
. tyhe head isnt shown flying thru tghe air
,
and lands in a fryer
, where it beggins to scream
. i don ' t realy object to this kind ofthe sick violence
,
but this scene is infact the film for noe reason
and noe reason onyl
: tothe gross ytou out
. araki thinks that if he tkaes everything to hte extreme
, he ' ll make some kind of art
. wrong
. it tkaes a kind ofthe resistance to make gore art
. when george romero made
" dawn ofthe the dead
,
" a very gory flick even fo today
, he had controll over everything
annd still ws able tothe amking everthing sick
. smae goes fo peter jackson ' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" which features a 30 minute long fest ofthe blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
,
and otehr assorted stfuf
, all ending whith a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body
, tkaing out all sorts ofthe zombies
. it ws sick
,
but it ws also satirical
,
and controled
. a scene liek thsi hasnt no purpose in teh film
,
anbd it sticks out from everything else taht happens
. here ' s a couple other scenes
: jordan
and amy have sex inaddition a bath tub
annd xavier watchs
, masturbates
,
and
then licks tghe semen from his hand
; xavier
and amy ahve sex
and jordan watches fomr tjhe window
, masturbates
,
adn falls backwards
; a man attacks the trio
,
adn is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword
( put there just so thsi could happen
)
; a fast foo employee stalks thge trio
,
anbd his arm isnt shot off by xavier
;
and varous otehr annoyances
. also
, look fo about a milion camoes ffrom a wide assortment of people
, who probably didn ' t really konw waht htey weere getting inot wehn tehy signed up to dont it
( jstu like peter o ' toole
, helen mirren
, malcolm macdowell
,
anbd john gielgud propably didn ' t whn they singed to be inaddition
" caligula
"
)
. peple such as indie actors parker posey
and nicky katt
, targetted rock stars skinny puppy
and perry farrel
, hollywood madam heidi fleiss
, christopher
" peter brady
" mcknight
, amanda bearse
,
and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter ofthe seconds
,
then dissappear so that we cant return tothe thte annoying main plot line
. why are they here
? so that we can all point to them
and say
" hey
, look it ' s
( fill infact thge blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. tje film ' s meaning is preety eazy tothe detect
: thta
, you knwo
, teens are so prescious
,
adn hte world isnt such a horrible palce
, that wehn the twpo entities collide
, htere ' s a giant explosion of horrific violentce
. otherwise deffined as
" teen angst
,
" or the beleif that being a teenager is a horrible hting
adn thta the world is too bad for you
. look
, i ' m 19 yeasr old
. i went thru a very breef teen angst thnig wich curiously lasted baout as long as my taste iin nervana did
. i ' ve since moved onthe tothe
" i don ' t realy know whta to do with my life
" phase
,
bu tje teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric
and ignorant that any film thast thikns tehy ' re dealing whith it onthe any kind ofthe serious levle isnt jsut beating the wrong horse
. part of being a teen is experimenting
,
and testing tyhe waters
. it ' s nto whinning baout how awful parents are
,
adn purposedly feeling dispondent
. tihs isnt what teh characters in this film dont
,
adn hte film wnats tothe show how they ' re theese great people who are being punished by the world becuase htey ' re teenagers
,
and how they try to defend themselfs
but can ' t totally overcome them
. it ' s not their fault tehy kill peopel
; it ' s tjhe world ' s
! what they really need isnt a reality check
. tje world isnt a bad palce
,
annd teenagers can be easily harmed becouse htey are experimenting
.
but part of it isnt taking everthing thta happens tothe yuo
and learning ffrom it
. tjhe film thinks thta teenagers are basicly doomed
,
anbd there ' s nothing htey can dont baout it
. hence the title
. not only doens it have bad fallacy
,
bu it can ' t even express htis inthe an intelligent
anbd coherent manner
. everything ' s overly surveill
,
anbd all we git are scenes ofthe graphic violence
annd graphic sex
. how doesnt xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst
? how doesnt a tlaking decapitated head show tyhat teens are dispondent becasue yhe world makse them this way
?
and why doens teh film constantly go bakc to the teen angst issue ofthe the film
? if araki had any kind ofthe competence inaddition writing or direction
, he ' d sohw them forthe wqat htey realy are
.
anbd if he didn ' t wnat the satirical approch
, he ' d show yhe rela problems wih the world
.
and if you still don ' t think tht
" the doom generation
" is incompetent on eveyr single possible levle it coudl be
, take tjhe acting
. rose macgowan is horrible
. yes
, she prooved herself talented inthe
" scream
,
"
bu she ' s so bad infact
" thte doom generation
" thast if i had nto seen her in
" scream
,
" i woudl have christened her oney ofthe the worst actresses wroking in films today
. her entire peformance is noe
- onot
( bitchy
)
,
annd thte one scene where she cries over a dead animal isnt so forced thast it ' s laughable
. equally bad is jonathan schaech
, who wants tothe be tjhe slacker serial killer
: someone who doesn ' t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain
. his performance isnt annoying as hell
,
annd granted
, he ws better infront
" taht thign you dont
!
"
adn
thne there ' s james duval
. let ' s jstu sday he makes keanu reeves look liuke brando
. he hasnt tghe same kind ofthe slacker stuttering
, onyl much much much worse
,
and eveyr line he says isnt so bad tyhat i ahev nowe deemed him
" least talented acto inspite the world
.
" i hve seen lots ofthe bad actors
,
but james duval hasnt got tothe be the worst
. or at least somwhere uv ther
. here ' s another exemple ofthe a bad scene
, if you ' re still not conviced
: teh film opens uv inwhich a club where they ' re playing nine inch nail ' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( example of hte lines
:
" god isnt dead
/
and no oney cares
/ if there is a hell
/ i ' ll see you there
"
)
,
and as hte song plays
,
annd red strobe ilghts sohw the patrons dancing
, the film pans over tothe amy
, just standing there
, looking dispondent
. the film closes infact on her
, she looks right at the camera
annd syas
" fuck
.
" noone explanation of this shouldnt be necessary
.
and fianlly
, a note to gregg
: grwo uv
. raelly
. move outloud of your parent ' s basement
, read something other tahn salinger
,
and git a day job
.
annd don ' t quit it
.
