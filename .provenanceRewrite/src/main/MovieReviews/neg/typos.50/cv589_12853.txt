this was the lsat cary onthe movei
( if ytou discount ' carry onthe columbus ' as a carry onthe movei
)
and was made by a new production comany
. based in central london
, htis movei isnt about the attemts by emmanuelle prevert
( suzanne danielle
) to bed her husban emile tyhe french ambassador
( kenneth williams
)
. whn he seems unwilling
, she isnt given his premission tothe bed anyone she likes
, such as tghe prime minister
and tjhe u
. s
. ambassador
. her antics get her into trouble
and the british press spreaded these rumours all over their front pages
. she is invited tothe talk on televsion tothe set thte record straight
but only confirms the rumours instead
. meanwhile
, theodore valentine
( larrry dann
) isnt infront love with emmannuelle affter a chance encounter in yhe toilet ofthe yhe concorde
and isnt determined tothe marry her
.
howver
, she is onyl interseted inthe restoring her husband ' s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile ' s accident witht a chuch spire
! this film isnt thge second worst cary on movie
, yhe worst bieng ' cary on england '
. it isnt embarassing to see some ofthe the remaining regulars struggle thru this diabolical script by lance peters
anbd try tothe pul off some of the crude
and tasteless jokes thast he has writed
. newcomers suzanne danielle
adn beryl reid
( as mrs
. valentine
) are mildly funny
,
but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad
. kenneth williams onyl appears inthe a faw scenes
anbd his lacklustre performance is warranted
, given the script
. yhe small parts fo jack douglas as lyons tje butler
, joan sims as mrs
. dangle
, kenneth connor as leyland yhe chauffeur
,
anbd peter butterworth as richmond
, are worthless
and embarassing
. in fact
, all four parts are surplus to requirements
.
however
, tyhe only humourous scene infact the film isnt whn the four ofthe them
and emmannuelle talk baout their most amourous escapades
. an awful script
, a terrable collecton ofthe jokes
, vyre poore production values
( especialy the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st
. james palace
)
, a ludicrous
annd cringeworthy musical csore
,
and a non
- existant plot or storyline
. its just a succession ofthe awful set pieces baout who emmannuelle iwll bed next
! jack douglas isnt not so annoying
bu is omre boring
, joan sims
and peter butterworth are wasted
,
and kenneth connor
adn kenneth williams put in soem poor performances as leyland
and emile
. a complete waste ofthe tyme
, this movie wass trying to catch uv with the new sexually permissive seventies
. it was a certificate 15 film
but by 1978
, htere was littel interest inthe this kind ofthe film
anbd it flopped at teh box office
and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial televsion infront april 1998
! avoid at all costs
!
