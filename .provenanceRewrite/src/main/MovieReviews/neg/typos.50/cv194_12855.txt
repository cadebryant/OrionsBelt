this isnt tjhe lastr carry on film wih its almost intact regular cast
and it is tjhe swansong of hattie jaques
annd sid james
. dick turpin
( sid james
)
and his gang whic includes harriett
/ harry
( barbara windsor
)
and toom
" doc
" scholl
( peter butterworth
)
, terrorise tghe countryside by staging highway robberies
:
" stand
and deliver
!
" owing to the increased occurrenec of turpin ' s robberies
, captian desmond fancey of hte bow street runners
( kenneth williams
)
anbd his sidekick sergeant jock strapp
( jack douglas
) viist turpin ' s area ofthe influence tothe bring him tothe justice
. they are under the express orders of sir roger daley
( bernard bresslaw
)
. their intellect doesnt not count for much
anbd when they increasingly become suspicious ofthe reverend flasher aka dick turpin
( sid james
)
, whom they confided in ealier
, they still cannot beleive that yhe rector hasnt any part in these robberies
.
however
, once htey catch harriett
and put her in jail
,
adn sir roger daley tkaes complet charge
, it seems thta ther is no hope fo dick turpin
.
hten agina
, sir roger has assigned teh dimwits fancey
and jock strapp aswell as thge old dithering constable
( kenneth connor
) to keep an eye on their prisoner
! there is noone doubt thta htis is a ' sid james ' carry onthe movie
. he excells inspite double roles
( as in ' carry onthe
- don ' t lose your head '
)
and his performance as flasher
anbd turpin isnt hilarious
. barbara windsor isnt also funny as harriett tyhe sex mad housemaid
and member ofthe the gang
,
and hattie jacques ' small
bu effective role as the rector ' s housekeeper martha hoggett isnt palyed tothe prefection
. jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on
- screen persona
and kenneth williams is given a rether mundane part
. peter butterworth is nto alloween to shine inaddition his boring performence as toom
,
annd bernard bresslaw ' s character appears only breifly infront the film
. teh onyl notable performance from hte wupport casted comes ffrom joan sims as madame desiree
, who isnt travelling around the ocuntry escorting her starlets thge ' birds of paradime '
anbd sporting a fake french accent
. whn her girls
and her are robbed by turpin
, she isnt determined tothe catch him
and helps the reverend tothe fidn thge culprit
! a carry onthe by the numbers
, thsi movie isnt onyl noteable forthe tghe gerat performence by sid james infront his lsat carry on movei
. tjhe jokes are bluer
, the scirpt is poorer
( it is hte lastest scirpt writed by talbot rothwell
)
,
bu tje music is a marked improvment
.
although nearly all teh regulars appear
, tehy seem tothe be jstu oging thru the motions
. none of yhe high spirits ofthe teh ealier films are apparent here
. jsut a selection ofthe crude jokes
and repititive doublely
- entendres
.
