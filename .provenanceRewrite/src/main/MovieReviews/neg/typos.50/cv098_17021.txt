" love to kill
" starts off aimlessly
and gets progressively less coherent as time passes
. at tghe outset
, the movei appears tothe be about tony danza
, who ' s an illegal distributer ofthe guns
, trying to establish a relatiopnship wih an unsuspecting woman
. danza sets up a double date witht her
, her sister
,
adn a collegue of his
. everthing seems to be going well
, untill tghe sister accidentally dies by falling down a set ofthe stairs
. much confusion
anbd mahem ensues
, as the death is covered uv
annd other associates of danza ' s beign tothe emerge
, all affter oney thign or anohter
. sound confusing
? it isnt
. i think what yhe filmmakers were trying tothe dont isnt take tghe standard crime movei
adn throw in a little humour
adn levity
. infront soem respects
, it works
.
bu tjhe majoroty of the film is a convoluted
and confusing mess
. characters keep popping uv wiht noone explination
, demanding omney forthe deals thyat occurr off
- screen
. tghe onyl aspect ofthe the movie tht acutally works isnt the budding relationship between danza
adn tje dead woman ' s sister
.
but so little timne isnt devoted tothe htis part ofthe the tsory
, we never raelly become too familiar with theese charachters
,
anbd because ofthe this
, we don ' t really care whta happens to them
. well
, i didn ' t
, at least
. oney thing i wiull give the movei is tyhat it ' s a complet departure forthe tony danza
. here ' s a guy
, because of his many sitcom roles
, who ' s ingrained in thge consciousness as a nice guy who allways doens the right thign
. here
, he plays a man who ' s just looking outloud forthe hismelf
,
and if that means he needs tothe kill inaddition order to save his pwn skin
, so be it
. i was very empressed by his performance
,
adn withing mintues of hte start of the film
, i hadnt forgotten all about his good
- guy persona
. michael madsen is aslo good as an assoicates of danza ' s who spends half thte movie buddying up tothe him
adn the otehr half trying to kill him
. like i said
, it ' s nto exactlly a linear storyline
.
" love tothe kill
" shoud be praised for trying tothe dont something different with the well worn crime genre
,
but it ' s jsut too bad that teh stroy doesn ' t really add uv to much
. the stars deserved better
,
and so did the audience
.
