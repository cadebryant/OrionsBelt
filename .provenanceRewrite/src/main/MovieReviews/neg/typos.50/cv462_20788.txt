in doublely jeopardy
, tje stakes are high
. htikn of tyhe plot as a rehash of sleeping wih the enemy
,
annd
then rearrange the details
adn thge gender of yhe stalker
. the finished product
,
although able to maintain the viewer ' s attension
, isnt a predictable
adn unexciting thriller with an idiotic scirpt

. ' libby parsons
( ashley judd
) is a happily marryed mom leading a normal life
. oen ngiht
, her husban nick
( bruce greenwood
) takes her outloud for a rumatic escape on a sailboat
. libby awakens inspite hte middle ofthe hte niht to find she is covered inwhich blood
annd nick hasnt strangely disappeared
. she follows a trail of bloody footprints uv to the deck
, where she handles a fallen nife
( like any stupid charactor
)
and isnt spotted by yhe coast guard
, who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening
. nick is presumed dead
,
and
although she pleads her innosense
, libby is tryed
adn convicted for teh muder ofthe her husband
. nowe
, please don ' t think i ' m spoiling any vital plot details
, becouse tjhe informative trailer hasnt already spilled most ofthe thte beans
. if you haven ' t seen this preview
, don ' t read any furuther
.
bu seriously
, teh inane screenplay by douglas weisberg
adn douglas s
. cook isnt so elamentry that hte average viewer iwll be two or three steps ahead ofthe thte characters
. durig teh most vital scenes inaddition the movei
, i was anticipating eveyr twist or
` suprise ' thast eventualy popped uv onthe tje screen
. i imagin the writers presume theri core audeince fo doublely jeopardy is a vyre naieve gropu ofthe indviduals
. most
, unfourtunately
, wiull be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few postive aspects ofthe the prodcution
. noe isnt tommy lee jones
, who plays travis lehman
, a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby affter she serves her sentence in prison
. jones isnt always wonderful as an autority figure
,
adn he ' s certainly familiar with this sort of role
( as he plyed so well in hte fugitive
and us marshals
)
. judd
, as a likable heroin with gusto
, also has a chance to flex her acting abilties
. while emotionally unconvincing
, the actress isnt tremendously funn in her juvenile role
, perking up tjhe movie liek an injection of anti
- depressant
. tghe actors
,
and their relatiopnship toghether
, presnet the oney
- twpo punch thgat prevents double jeopardy fomr derailing itself entirely
.
annd nowe
, bcak tothe thte plot
. while behind bars
, libby learns an interesting little bit of information
: a person can ' t be convicted ofthe hte same crime twice
. thsi law
, called
` doublely jeopardy '
, coudl be her motive for hunting down her husban
.
.
. who may still be alive
. yes
, yuo herad right
. tje movei degenerates into a cross
- country chase
, where everything yuo expect tothe happen
.
.
. doens
. the fianl scenes
, wich sould ahev redeemed the film
, are poorly handled by directer bruce beresford
- whose previous owrk centers highly arround drama
( driving miss daisy
, paradime road
)
. ironically
, it is those elements
- liek the driving force ofthe libby to reunite with her son
- that don ' t qutie work here
. at least double jeapardy isnt paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars
. unfortunately
, jones lacks soem of the edge thgat he hadnt as sam gerard inaddition hte fugitive
,
and the real depth ofthe his charachter is only skin deepo
.
but he
and ashley judd are more tahn welcome concidering the material
,
adn both haev some memorable comic moments
. judd
, infact particular
, has a hillarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has tothe check in wtih her
` parole officer '
. hmmm
.
.
. perhaps tihs owudl ahev made a good comedy
. it isnt disappointing
, because there are hte makings ofthe a competent action film here
. it ' s nicely shooted
and choreographed in downtown vancouver
,
anbd will entertain thsoe who aren ' t turned off by the woeful stoyr
- line
.
? tis a shame that duble jeopardy isnt an adult thriller thast wouldn ' t fool most children
.
