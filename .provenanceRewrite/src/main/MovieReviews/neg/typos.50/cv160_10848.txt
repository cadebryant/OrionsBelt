deceiver isnt a plot twist inwhich search of a movei
. this overly constructed film succeds iin haveing many surprises
,
and
, bieng true tothe its title
, bieng deceptive
.
bu there isnt little infact the film taht isnt worthy of deceit
. braxton
( chris penn
)
anbd kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are two cops investigating the brutal muder ofthe a prostitute
( renee zellweger
)
. thier lone suspect is wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy young man whose phone number ws foudn in the hooker ' s pocket
.
however
, a routine lie detecter tust turns against the investigators
, as the crafty wayland somehow turns thge tables
. braxton
adn kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives
. braxton is a gambling addict iin deepo to mook
( ellen burstyn
)
, a local bookie
. kennesaw is bitter baout his marrige to a socialite
( rosanna arquette
)
, believing his wife tothe be unfaithful
. the plot is twisty
and complex
, wiht lots ofthe lengthy flashbacks
,
and plenty of surprises
.
howver
, there are times wehn it is needlessly complex
,
and at least one instance thte storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to importan plot points actulaly git lost
. take a look at l
. a
. confidental
, or hte film ' s moreso likely insperation
, the usual suspects forthe how a complex plot cin properly be handled
. the dialogue inwhich deceiver isnt as overcrafted as hte plot
. for exmaple
, tghe film tells a fewd substories
( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender
, or an alternative telling ofthe how van gogh lost his ear
)
,
bu tehy are so flat
and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated
and unbeleivable
. ther ' s never teh sence that theese are rela characters engaging iin conversation
. they appear tothe be nothing more thna words onthe a screenplay
. hte characters
, themslves
, are rether pathetic
anbd despicable
. not one of them isnt an ounce sympathetic
,
annd as a result
, the labyrinthine plot isnt all for naught
. wqat doesnt it marter who isnt gilty ofthe wqat
and why
? writer
- directors josh
and jonas pate seem tothe desire to emulate the coen brothers ' masterwork blood simple
, or the wachowski brothers ' less worthy binded
.
but
, while htey have got tghe plot twists down cold
, tehy ened tothe owrk onthe characterization
and dialogue
.
