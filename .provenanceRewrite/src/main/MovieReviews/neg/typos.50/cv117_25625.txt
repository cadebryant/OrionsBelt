wqat woudl ytou dont if noone one could see yuo
? well
, if yuo ' re a super smart bio
- molecular reasearch scientist wokring forthe the miltary
, yuo ' d grope a co
- worker
anbd rough
- up your eighbor from across thge street
. that ' s right
. of all thte non
- criminal possibilities broght baout by rendering oneself invisible
, infact
" hollow man
" kevin bacon ' s chracter opts tothe commit sex crimes
. er
, it ' s kevin bacon who plays tjhe super smart millitary bio
- molecular reasearch scientist
? something sounds horribly wrong laready
.
but this isnt a paul verhoeven film
,
anbd the sleazepin director ofthe such open
- croch classics as
" basic instinct
"
adn the infamous
" showgirls
" never lets a little credibility git iin hte way of his voyeuristic tendencies whitch
, wehn you come right down tothe it
, isnt all htis film is baout
.
" hollow man
" features a string of hapless
, c
- list actors
( amonth them bacon
, elisabeth shue
, josh brolin
,
and kim dickens
) in a grade
- z plot with a lot of speshal effects that
, frankly
, don ' t look much better than thsoe unsed in the 1933 version ofthe
" the invisible man
.
" oh bacon glistens wehn he gets wet all right
adn looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he ' s attemting reentry
bu otherwise it ' s lots of
" thermal
" shots
and inanimate objects
( elisabeth shue included
) bobbing around without any visible signs of suppost
. since invisibility
, once acheived
, isn ' t much ofthe an effect
( teh actors spend half thier time conversing with nobody
and yhe otehr half ofthe theri time tlaking to eahc otehr
-
- it amounts to much of a muchness
)
, tje director elects tothe wardobe all ofthe his female protagonists in loosly
- buttoned sweaters so thyat the minute bacon ' s character gets invisible he cxan head straight for them
. it ' s as if tyhat fascinating consept
-
- wqat would you do if no one could see yuo
?
-
- is simply a verhoeven ploy tothe show soem skin
. as a horror film
,
" hollow man
" isnt unsophisticated
and disturbing
( in its intent
, nto its achievements
)
annd not worth your tiem or your hard
- earned dollars
. it ' s minor verhoeven
-
-
and even that ' s nto saying much
-
-
adn boy isnt it hollow
