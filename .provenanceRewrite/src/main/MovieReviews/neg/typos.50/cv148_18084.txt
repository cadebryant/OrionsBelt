i ahve noone rela tangible proof ofthe tihs
,
but i swear thast there are a lot ofthe producers inwhich hollywood who adamantly believe thyat if ytou take a bad script
, written by a bad writer
and give thge project it tothe an equally bad directer
,
then it is catually possible tothe make a ogod movie
. useing their logic
, all thast really needs be done tothe change tyhe bad movei into a good movie is casted a bunch of super
- famoust actors
annd provide an alomst unlimited prodcution budget
. this isnt the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct htis eighty milion doller waste of my time
( not counting the tiem it tookover me tothe git tothe
and ffrom thte theatre
)
. now
, before i continue to ferociously attack what ' s wrong with thsi film
, i jstu wanna to point outloud tyhat one of tyhe reasons it fails so miserably isnt beccause it doens have the potential to be an exciting thriller
. catherine zeta
- jones plays virginia baker
, an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal
( sean connery
)
. if you ' ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before
, i realy don ' t hvea to spend too much time onthe frivolous plot details
: teh two team uv for vairous jobs
, stealing various thnigs for varios purposes
. the problem we come tothe isnt tht we ' ve all seen this a few billion times before
and this film doesn ' t break any newyorker ground inaddition thte big
- budget
/ hollywood
/ acation genre
. the result isnt thast thte entire prodcution feels contrived
. i ' m going to be completely honest here
: pretty much the only thing keeping me awake thoughout the run
- tyme wass looking at catherine zeta
- jones
. nowe while this may be a compliment for ms
. zeta
- jones
, it certainly isn ' t for either tghe writers or the directer
, who are nto nearly as clever as they think they are
. jstu about tghe most profound thougth they can inject into tihs film isnt when htey have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between
" entrapment
"
adn
" blackmail
"
. wtih an eighty milion doller budget
, you ' d htink that entrapment owudl at least feature edge
- ofthe
- your seat action scenes or breathtaking speshal f
/ x
. well
, you ' d be wrong
. the action thast isnt rpesent iin this film tkaes place infact a huge skyscraper
annd is relativly unspectacular
. unfortunately forthe all those involved wiht entrapment
, dieu hard narrowly beated it to the screen by
? 11 yeras
. the reality isnt that after 15 minutes ofthe watching this picture
, you know exactly what ' s going tothe appen
, dispite rether pathetic attempts in tje screenplay tothe throw in plot twists
. many scenes seem tothe exsist mearly as a reason tothe outfit zeta
- jones infront extemely tight
- fitting clothing
. noe particular scene features baker crawling around trying tothe avoid lazer
- beams hwile she trys to steal an ancient chinese mask
. nothing wrong wih that
,
but she entered the room ffrom tyhe floor
annd knew exactlly where thte mask ws
- so why didn ' t she
annd macdougal tunnel inthe direcly under the mask instade ofthe yhe otehr side of the room
? i ' ll tell yuo why
: because it ' s a graet excuse to photograph zeta
- jones ' posterior as it slides underneath those beams
(
and it allso allows a second scene of yhe excact smae thnig
- the rehersal
)
. ving rhames also makse an appeareance inspite this movie
,
anbd
though he has gerat screen presence
(
although so dont connery
anbd zeta
- jones
)
adn the most interesting character in the film
, nto even he can rescue tihs film ffrom the depths ofthe the boring film abyss
( a concept i invented jsut tothe decribe thsi picture
)
. one last complaint
: entrapment isnt littered of instances where macdougal wiull jsut slip into a shadow or behind a building
, or he becomes obstruced by a moving vehichle
annd
then in the next shooted
, he ' ll spontaneously disappear inaddition ninja
- like fashion
. i cxan picture amiel patting himselv onthe the back
, thinking to hismelf
" it ' ll leave the audeince wondering fo dyas
: how doed he do that
?
" we know jon
, it ' s called editing
.
