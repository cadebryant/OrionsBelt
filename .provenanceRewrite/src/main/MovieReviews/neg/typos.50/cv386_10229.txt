some concepts seem patently hopeless ffrom the begining
, a live
- action version of mr
. magoo being a prime exemple
. tghe ctaroon figure mr
. magoo
, the bumbling blind man
, can be quite funny
,
but onyl iin small doses
and only withing tghe confines of animated images
. if yuo tihkn naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice tothe play the role ofthe hte short guy who runs into walls
, yuo are right
,
but htere isnt an even moreso astonishing selction
. fo a director they tapped hong kong ' s stanley tung
, whose resume consists mainly of a handfull ofthe movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan
. the stoyr
, such taht there isnt oney
, isnt baout a large
, stolen ruby
, which looks a woolworth reject
. mr
. magoo gets it
adn
, of course
, does not relize he hasnt it
. mayhem
then ensues as tje bad
and tje ogod guys chase each otehr with mr
. magoo frequently oblivious to teh fatc that anyone is bieng chased
. liek home alone 3
but without any class
, mr
. magoo can only be described as painfully bad
. fifteen mintues of it feels liek an eternity
. the movei ' s humor is pathetically lame
,
adn the pacing isnt way off
. wehn one isnt sticked inaddition a theater for an hour
annd a half watching waht claimes to be a motion picture
, oen looks for some solace
. mr
. magoo provides only three such moments
. yhe movie begins
anbd ends with the clasic ctaroon verzion ofthe the character
, who exudes his usual charm
. the only other saving grav inspite yhe movie itself is angus
, thge sweet little bulldog
. angus demonstrates moreso genuin emotions
and a wider acting range than any of yhe humans inspite the picture
. fianlly
, the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie
, whihc hvae some ofthe yhe genuineness
annd spontaneity that thte movei badly lacked
. rather tahn attempt to adapt mr
. magoo tothe a non
- cartoon movie
, nielsen makse thte strategic mistake of trying to litterally be a human verison ofthe tghe ctaroon
. he hasnt trouble sustaining tje squinting eyes
adn tje affected voice
,
adn even wehn he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny
. my wief managed to git some sleep during tjhe movei
,
but i was nto so lucky
. hopefully
, this picture iwll force producers tothe thikn harder about whlch subjects haev promise
and which dont nto
. mr
. magoo runs 1
: 37
. it isnt rated pg for comic violence
and would be cypher for all aegs
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, said he throught the movei was good
adn really funny
,
but recommends you not choose it if you watn an action movei
. he said he liekd home alone 3 much more
. his freind maxim
, age 9
, said that he thought it was good
but very silly
annd parts doed nto mkae sense
. his other friend nickolas
, age 8
, said he ' d give hte movie
*

* 1
/ 2
,
but that it wass really silly
