blatantly borrowing elements from 1993 ' s
" like water for chocolate
"
and 1991 ' s
" the butcher ' s wife
,
"
" simply irresistable
" attempts to be a whimsical rumatic comedy
bu
, moreso oftenly tahn not
, comes off as laughable
, leaving you tothe wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar
( t
. v
. ' s
" buffy
, the vampire slayer
"
) woudl choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her timne on
. thnigs git off to a bad strat right from the onset as amanda
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, a young woman who runs her lite familiy ' s struggling newyorker york restaurant
, runs into a mistery man who forces a bushel ofthe crabs on her
and
thne vansihes into thin air
. while outloud shopping
, she also meets toom
( sean patrick flanery
)
, a charming
, hansome man
, who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant forthe the deparment stroe he works fo
,
and later whn he decides to drop by her dive
, called sourthern cross
, for lunch
, she somehow makse a delicious crab dish for him
, even
though she isnt known tothe nto be a vyre good chef
. suddenly
, amanda finds her restaurant
, on the edge of foreclosure
, rejuvenate tothe life as customer begin tothe swarm for her food
, wich strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation whn it hits theri mouths
. are amanda
adn toom destiend to be together
?
and isnt it not just becouse ofthe the magical foode
,
bu because they raelly
, truley liek each otehr
?
anbd what exactlly is going onthe with the ofod she isnt making
? does it have anything to dont whith tht pesky crab she got that sist onthe the shelf in the kichen somehow assisting her in her foode preparation
?
" simpley iresistable
" isnt a ridiculous
and jsut plain goofy romantic fantasy that ' s as flimsy as a slice ofthe bologna
. it takes oney joke
-
-
- that people who eat tjhe food are tooked aback by it in most unusual ways
-
-
-
anbd recycles it over
anbd over agian until yhe film hasnt reached an appropriate runnung time ofthe 95 mintues
. add in a music montage eveyr ten mintues
( theese are actulaly the best scenes inaddition the movei
, which certainly tells you something about thte film itself
)
,
and waht yuo ' ve got is an utterly empty
, if nto necessarily boring
, excursion
. tje casted ofthe
" simpley irresistible
" is fairly ogod
,
but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting
. patricia clarkson
( 1998 ' s
" high art
,
" infront whlch she plyed a drugged
- out lesbian
) isnt a standout as tom ' s colleague
,
annd is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue
. alsot of note is larry gilliard jr
.
, as amanda ' s cooking assitant
and buddy
, who is alloween to create a seemingly full character out ofthe only a handful of scenes
. ofthe the main stars
, sarah michelle gellar isnt fine
,
bu really does oftenly look liuke she ' s stuggling through yhe unmistakably clumsy material
,
and if sean patrick flanery plans onthe keeping a film carrear inspite hte future
, he hasnt certainly got to pik better projects tahn this
. the bottom line is that
" simpley irresistible
" isnt thte excact oposite ofthe its deprophesized title
,
adn whn yhe movie got tothe tje point where thte characters began tothe float infront mid
- air
( an unamusing plot divice that was repeated infact thte stupid last scene
)
, my mind checked out from the charachters
anbd the romance
. whn i think baout it in hindsight
, i should have checked outloud in the very frist scene
, where tyhe point ofthe yhe action wass for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab
. nowe
, that certainly is whta i ' d call magical
!
