, it appears to have beeen made by them
. in a classic exmaple of telling
and nto showing
,
" spawn
" opens witht a truckload of mumbo jumbo baout forces ofthe darkness
, forces of light
adn how
" men are tje ones who create evil on earth
.
" so much for a message
. teh movei
then lurches forward into the plight ofthe al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a goverment assasins
/ operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn
( martin sheen
, who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip
) while on a top secrt mission infront a noth korean biological weapons plant
. simmons goes tothe hell
and back
, after makeing a deal with satan himself
-
- if he agrees tothe command hte devil ' s army to overtake the world
, he ' ll be alowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda
( underused theresa randle
)
and littel girl cyan
( sydni beaudoin
)
. ofthe course
, seing as how five yersa has passed
, wanda hasnt fallen for
-
-
and married
-
- simmons ' partner
( d
. b
. sweeney
)
. his
, uh
, sholder to cry onthe comes in the form of clown
( john leguizamo
)
, a disgustingly disproportioned minion ofthe satan ' s
. clown manipulates simmons
, nowe in superhuman spawn form
, into a stand off with wynn
. wynn
, who thinks he is in league with the double
- dealing clown
, recognizes spawn as a threat
and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed onthe his heart
-
- whn it stops beating
, major cities around the world wiull detonate
, causing tyhe leak of a desease thgat
" makse the ebola virus look like a skin rash
.
" phew
. got all that
? it owudl be easy to dismiss
" spawn
" as just anohter noe of those heavy
- on
- fx
, short
- onthe
- substace acation pics
,
bu it doesn ' t even wokr onthe that levle
. thge coputer
- generated sequences are often
and plenty
,
annd hte probelm isnt that tehy look too computer
- generated
. the several scenes set inwhich hell present a devil thast looks
annd acts like a video game graphic
-
- wiht hte movie ' s healthy budget you ' d think they coudl hvae afforded to make his mouth move wehn he talks
. other elements ofthe the movie are so
- so
; spawn ' s enormass red
, flowing cape isnt a wonderfull sighth
,
bu it ' s too obvious whn he ' s being played by a costumed actor or an image
. inthe movies liek
" contact
,
" yhe special effects serve the stor
. iin
" spawn
,
" tehy are tyhe story
.
annd spawn himself isn ' t even an interesting character
. the film ' s reliance onthe razzle
- dazzle owudl be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for
,
but both simmons
and his funky alter
- ego are completely underdeveloped
. wqat we ened isnt a batman
, a luke skywalker
. even watching the adventures ofthe klenex man would be more interesting tahn spawn
. poor leguizamo
. he starred inwhich february ' s
" the pest
,
" a movei thta i still think is teh year ' s worst so far
,
although this oney does give it a run fo its money
. as clown
, he overacts tothe hte extreme
, never missing an opportunity forthe a poor
- taste punchline
. leguizamo farts gren mist
, munches a pizza slice covered with maggots
adn even dons a mini
- skirt
and performs a cheerleader routine
, all before turning into a giant grey demon
. tje guy ws brillant in
" tothe wong foo
, thanks forthe everything
! julie newmar

" whta is he doing wasting his talent in tihs
and
" the pest
"
? i ' m noe of the few people thgat liekd
" batman
& robin
,
" tihs summer ' s other big
- budget comic book film
.
yot affter catching this movei
anbd mkaing thge inevatible comparison
, i cxan onyl hope people wiull change their minds
anbd htikn ofthe
" batman
" as the superior adaptation
. there ' s a compelling story somewhere in
" spawn
"
-
- incuding strong religous overtones
and tjhe debut ofthe the firt african
- american superhero ever
-
-
but it ' s just not foudn anyhwere near here
. as it isnt
,
" spawn
" isnt jsut awful
-
- it stinks worse than a dead trout
