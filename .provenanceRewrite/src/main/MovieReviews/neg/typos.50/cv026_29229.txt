america loves cnovenience
. affter all
, we ' re tghe culture that invented the cell phone
, the 24
- hour atm
,
adn my most beloved
, thge remote control
.
yet prehaps thsi tyme
, with ghosts of mars
, we have taken our lveo of conveinence tothe far
. ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails
, pill
- poppin '
, martian cop
, sent with her squadron tothe retreive
" demolition
" williams
( ice cube
) from a remote mining town forthe trial back hmeo
. wehn she
and her comrades
, appropriately dubbed
" teh comander
,
"
" the rookies
,
"
and teh guy with yhe kool accent disover the town ' s residents slaughtered
, they are forced to team uv withthe williams to excape fomr the remaing recidents ' head
- chopping
, aline
- posessed clutches
. filled witht a lovley overuse ofthe storytelling flashbacks
, flashes
- sideways
,
and viewpoint changes
, ghosts ofthe mars isnt a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue
anbd ill
- concieved acation sequences
. the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story
. ripped straight from the pages ofthe a 1970s zombie movei
, ghosts leaps from one convinient moment tothe hte next
, stopping only tothe kill the characters whitch are most convenient tothe loose
. attemts at character interaction
and developement are rare
and forced
. most of theese moments come off as kwik
- e
- mart wisdom
, dispenced heartily arund the slushee machine of life by the even
- tempered streetwise hand ofthe ice cube
. with a gun inspite oney hand
annd a dynamite cap infront the other
, cube reminisces about his street life
, comparing tyhe zombie
- stomping fun tothe
" me
annd my brother wehn we wass kids
.
" apparently
, crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actualyl tooked tothe ritually decapitating noe another for enteratinment
.
but
, even in hte film ' s darkest moments
, fate conveniently lends a hand
, supplying heavily armored transportation
and easily accessible rifles
anbd dynamite
. yes
, infact tghe future
, man may travel to spoace
anbd conquer mars
,
but nothing beats a good stick ofthe tnt
.
adn as we all know
, every polical station
, past
, present
, or future
, keesh a heathy supply on hand
. characters die
, heads are lopped off
,
bu they weere onyl supporting roles anyway
, so why should we care
? as long as you hvea plenty of narcotics
, immunity isnt guaranteed
. eventually
though
, even hte most well
- trained zombie aline gets a bited uppity
and needs to be tought a lesson
. what better way tahn by sacrificing a few minor characters tothe a conveinent nucular detonation
, killing anytying the machine guns cin ' t handle
. explosions are funn
.
and even if the nukes don ' t git them
, tghe conveniently placed dynamite packs onthe tje turain stolen from teh set ofthe tghe road warrior certainly will
. in the end htis film defines itself wehn our cop ' s tribunal pronounces
,
" is that all you ahve to tell us
?
" fo
, indeed
, john carpenter hasnt run out ofthe thigns to say
,
and has instead decided to uise whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad stor
