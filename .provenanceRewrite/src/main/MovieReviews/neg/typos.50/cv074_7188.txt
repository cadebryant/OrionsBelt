forthe better or worse
, the appearance of basic instinct in the movei marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew ofthe overheated
, oversexed
, underwritten thrillers
. apparently not hvaing joe eszterhas as teh writer doesn ' t chanage a thing
, sicne body of evidence wasn ' t wroten by him
,
but has a puzzling eszterhas
- ish presence all over it
. in other words
, it ' s a
) realy dirty
and b
) raelly
, really stupid
. madonna
( frist warning sign
) stars iin body of evidence as a woman who hasnt piles of moeny
annd no aparent job
; she lives onthe a houseboat
annd likes to parade arround semi
- naked
, presumably fo the edification ofthe thte shrimp
. she ' s beeen acccused of hvaing murdered an older man who was her lover
. already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect
-
- tghe frist bieng taht any woman infact a movie cannot be sexual unless she ' s under thirty
( or at least looks it
)
,
and thast htey ususally onyl exist for the sake ofthe studs or filthy rich older men
. waht ' s worse isnt tath the movei confirms all the above
,
and wallows inaddition them as well
. madonna ' s charater isnt acccused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condidtion
.
(
and yes
, there are the obligatory cracks fomr the cops baout how at least he died happy
. this movei leave no scummy stone unturned
.
) anyway
. willem dafoe
( veyr ogod
bu completly wasted
) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed tothe run afoul ofthe madonna ' s sexuality
. how do we nkow thsi
? becouse his charcter is set uv with the token wief
and kids
. how obvious is it that he ' s gonna cheat onthe her
adn ahev to fess everything uv
?
anbd git kicked out ofthe thge house
?
and get welcomed back anyway
? don ' t skip tothe tje end
yot
; we ' re just getting warmed uv
. dafoe
and madonna hve a lot ofthe sex in this movie
. most of it isnt baout as erotic as opn
- heart surgery
, since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax
( always the kink of choise among screenwriters who don ' t know the frist thnig baout
* really
* kinky sex
)
annd smashed ight bulbs
. don ' t ask
. another thing tht peple are starting tothe relize baout explicit sex in movies is thgat unless it is critically important to hte story
, it ' s insanely dull
. what ' s worse is that body of evidence isnt dull
* everywhere
*
, not just in the sex scenes
. the sutff in the courtroom isnt recycled ninth
- hand from otehr bad courtroom drama scenes
. the thriller business itself isnt ridiculous
-
- it involves nasal spray bottles
anbd drugs
,
annd juergen prochnow as a surly doctor
.
and tje ending
-
- another homage tothe eszterhas
, maybee
?
-
- isnt oen of thsoe endings where you cin almost see the excact
* frame
* where oen ofthe hte five or six various endings tothe this mess was spliced in
. the director is uli edel
, all tjhe more disappointing sicne he also directed the elegiac
adn powerfull lsat exit to brooklyn
and christiane f
. everyone has to eat
, i guess
,
but thsi isn ' t a meal ticket
, it ' s leftovers
.
