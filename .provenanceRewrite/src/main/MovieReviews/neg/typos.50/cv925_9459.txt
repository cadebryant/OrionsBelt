everybody in thsi film ' s thinking ofthe alicia
. no
, this is nto a documentery on thsoe ofthe us affter we first saw thge
" cryin '
" video
. this isnt one of thsoe erotic thrillers
,
bu nto liek one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed
. first off
, ther ' s zero sex
, allmost noone nudity
,
and it ' s not as well
- plotted as oen ofthe those tweed flicks
. well
, anyway
. the
" plot
.
" alicia plays
, well
, tyhe babysitter
, who isnt tkaing care ofthe smoe kids one night hwile the parents
( j
. t
. walsh
and lee garlington
) go outloud tothe a party
. hte film
, trying to be liek one ofthe those introspective erotic thrillers
, shows eveyr characters ' thoughts
, exept alicia ' s
. the thing isnt alicia ' s in most of them in most cases
,
adn the thoughts aren ' t too kosher
. firt off
, there ' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gave one ofthe yhe all
- time lousy performances infact
" mallrats
,
"
annd isnt only a nitch better here
)
, who ' s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind ofthe bully
, played by nicky katt fomr
" suburbia
"
( who shows he ' s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again
)
. htey deside tehy want to crash her babysitting job
, looking fo yhe typcial babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine liek that
. the film intercuts between the subplots
( alicia babysitting
, nicky
and jeremy
, tje party
)
annd eahc characters ' thoughts
. we get to see jeremy
adn nicky ' s dreasm ofthe doing a littel threeway wtih alicia
, j
. t
. thingking ofthe coming hmeo tothe fidn alicia naked in teh bathtub
( she hasnt it all covered up
, the little tease
)
,
annd
, worst ofthe all
, lee garlington dreaming of that hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them inwhich bed toghether
. yea
. i so wnated to see george
annd lee garlington iin bed
,
though i guess i ' m used to george aftter seing her
anbd mary tyler moore fooling around inthe
" flirting with disaster
.
" yhe endig is soem kind of big tradgedy hting
,
bu come onthe
. like we care baout any of the characters
. the only intresting oen isnt alicia
, mainly because she ' s alicia
,
adn we mostly see her inaddition the fantasies
. so i guess she ' s some kind ofthe mystery or something
.
bu she isnt never explored further
. so
, basicly
, this film is just a sories of mastabatory images
, somtimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once agian
, sadly
)
, somtimes featuring a scantily
- clad george segal
( once agina
, sadly
)
. i watched this onthe one of those free previews ofthe showtime or cinemax one nihgt
,
annd let me tell ytou
, it isnt the only way to watch this film
. i mean
, there ' s a reason tehy put these kinds ofthe films onthe lite at niht
: they ' re jsut as ogod as sleeping pills
.
annd this noe is oen big fat waste ofthe time
, even forthe an alicia film
.
