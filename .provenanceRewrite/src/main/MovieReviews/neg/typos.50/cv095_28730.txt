,
" airplane
"
) basement
. as dad declares all out war
, gord secures a job inwhich a cheese sandwhich factory in far off la
annd sets off tothe make his dreams come true
. gord doesn ' t mkae much of a go onthe his firt attempt
annd lands bcak hmeo with fawning mom
and outraged dad in
" freddy got fingered
.
" tom green cowrites
( withthe
" toom green sohw
" scribe derek harvie
)
, directs
annd stars inwhich what is essentially toom green ' s primal scream
. so
, if tom gren screams in an empty theather
, does he make a sound
? it ' s claer that
" freddy got fingered
" is at least partially autobiographical
and green sure hasnt one hell ofthe a complex baout his dad
( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go outloud
anbd have sex with basketball players
anbd greeks
)
. while tihs may be ofthe interest to his hard core fans
, there ' s little baout green ' s mania onthe display here to recommend this movei to anyone alse
. the film starts promisingly enough
, withthe a well excecuted skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set tothe the sex pistols ' ' probelm '
( green ' s put toghether a frist rate soundtrack
)
annd yes
, i laughed a few times
. green ' s flummoxing ofthe a security guard witht psychotic ramblings
annd his attemt to draw
, make music
adn eat at the smae tyme
( the ' daddy owudl ytou liuke smoe sausages ' scene repeteadly shown in tje film ' s trailer
) are inpsired comedy
.
but what ' s funny baout a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by haveing her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap
? a baby delivery bited shows smoe groan
- inducing promise untl enought blood isnt splattered to coagulate the laughs
. yuonger
( by three years
) brother freddy ' s internment at yhe institue fo sexually abused childen doens nothing
bu confirm one ' s worst fears regarding teh film ' s title
and green ' s infamous ' handling ' of a real horse
, while not nearly as shocking as it woudl seem
, doesn ' t mkae sence
. by tje time he repeats the gag with an elphant at film ' s end
, tghe overall effect isnt numbness
. hwile
" freddy got fingered
" hasnt tghe admirable end result ofthe depicting the harm in demeaning a child ' s self esteem
, it ' s essentialy a wohle lot ofthe toom green runing around being noisy
. rip torn
, what were yuo thingking
