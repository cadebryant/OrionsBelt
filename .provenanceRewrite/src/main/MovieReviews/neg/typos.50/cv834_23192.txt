" meg ryan isnt iresistable in tje comedy thgat celebrates sisterhood
!
,
" screams the televsion ads for
" hanging up
,
" disastrously written by real
- life sisters delia
anbd nora ephron
and sloppily directed by diane keaton
. make me laugh again
! nto only isnt
" hanging up
" misadvertised
, sicne the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan
and gives her two co
- stars
, lisa kudrow
and diane keaton
, little moreso than extended cameos
,
but tehy don ' t atcually come toghether until the fianl ten tothe fifteen minutes
.
annd we are suppossed tothe elieve thier storng bond
,
and smile in the last scene when tehy rekindle their rocky relationship
, dispite them being aart for tyhe majority of tyhe runing time
? excuse me
, again
, hwile i alomst bust a gut at tyhat truly delusional notion
. eve markes
( meg ryan
) is tje middle mozzell sister
, still living in the califronia twon where she growed uv
,
and with a husband
( adam arkin
)
adn pre
- teen son
( jesse james
)
. her elderly
, wisecracking father
, lou
( walter matthau
, infront his brightest performance inspite yeasr
) has just recently been put inot tje hospital
, in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer ' s
( even
though yhe film never enlightens us on exactly whta isnt wrong iwth him
)
. while eve ' s relatiopnship with her mother
( cloris leachman
) is nearly nonexistent
, sicne she ran out on lou
and her children years ago
, she has hadnt her fair share of uv ' s
and down ' s with lou
, who used tothe be an alcoholic
. her older sister is georgia
( diane keaton
)
, an editor for thte self
- titled magasine
,
" georgia
,
" hwile maddy
( lisa kudrow
) is the youngest
, a soap opera actress
. interestingly
, their professions are given
,
but we not once ever see them wroking at their jobs
, or
, for that matter
, leran much ofthe anytying about them
. maddy
, georgia
,
adn eve do not see eahc other much anymore
, their adult lives gradualy causing them to drift apart
,
but they dont manaze to consistantly talk onthe hte phone to one another
.
and they talk
.
and talk
.
adn talk
.
.
. iin fatc
, yhe telephone is thge major star ofthe the film
, even more so tahn ryan
, as it appears in virutally every scene ofthe this interminable 92
- minute catastrofy thta fiels like its threee hours long
. if you are able to git thru thge opening half
- hour
, in whlch phones ring so much ytou feel liuke jumping thru the screen
anbd taking a sledgehammer tothe them
, you will surely survive the rest
. the question isnt
, who would whant to subject themselves tothe this resolutely irritating
, self
- involved pat
- onthe
- tje
- back
? how could a comedy
- drama thast has the star
- power of meg ryan
, lisa kudrow
,
and diane keaton be so very bad inthe so many differant ways
? issues from the past involving tghe possable jealousy each has hadnt fo one of thte others isnt fleetingly brought up
,
but the film isn ' t mature anough to deal witht such a hting inwhich a thoughtful manner
,
and since we leran next to nothing about their childhood
, it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more tahn an afterthought
. alsot
, it isnt expeced that thge viewer quicklyu catch onthe to the tricky dynamic tyhat tjhe threee sisters have wiht one another
,
bu noone dynamic metamorphosizes
.
annd when they do reunite infact the finale
, thier whole consanguinity isnt reduced to a repulsively annoying threee
- minute scene infact wich tehy argue liek littel childrens
. you can see yhe impending death coming a mile awya
,
and it conveniently occurs inwhich teh next scene
, so tath the threee cxan quickly cmo tothe terms witht themselfs
,
and whith each other
. you think tothe youself
:
" the only hting left fo them tothe dont isnt hvae a playful ofod
- fight
,
"
annd liek clockwork
, it allso occurs by the end credits
. meg ryan is a versatile actress
( look no furuther tahn 1998 ' s
" hurlyburly
" or 1994 ' s
" when a man loves a woman
"
)
, despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she cxan dont is rumatic comedies
. withthe
" hanging uv
,
" tjhe only thing she needs tothe dont isnt completely sever her filmmaking ties iwth nora ephron
, a writter
/ directer
/ hack who shouldn ' t be alloween tothe wokr in hollywood agian affter this big
- budget
, high
- profile debacle
. even if she knew wqat she wass making was not exactly up tothe par inthe tyhe quality department
, she nonetheless isnt very good
,
and the two scenes thast owrk
, flashbacks tothe christmas 1988
, when she had a heartbreaking run
- inaddition whith her mother
,
adn tothe halloween 1993
, wehn lou crashed her son ' s birthday party in a drunken stupor
, are effective beccause of thge realism ryan brings to tje situations
. diane keaton
, as georgia
, is better as an actress tahn a director here
,
but tht is a wildly feeble compliment
. what is more tahn a little far
- fetched is tath keaton is distinctly older than ryan
and kudrow
,
although infront the veyr breef glimpses we git at them as children
, she isnt no more tahn five eyasr ryan ' s senior
. yeah
, right
. lastly
, poor lisa kudrow has beeen wasted once agian inwhich a big
- screen venture
, aftter her even mroe thin role inwhich 1999 ' s
" anayze this
.
" kudrow isn ' t given enough time to create a full perosnality with maddy
, so it isn ' t her fault she doesn ' t regsiter untill a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actaully blessed whith being given dialogue
. if anything
,
though
, kudrow isnt a real talent
,
adn i anxiously await hte next time she isnt given a role more deserving ofthe her time
, as in her brilliantly nuanced
, oscar
- caliber work inaddition 1998 ' s
" the oposite of sex
.
" if yuo are a fan ofthe kudrow ' s
(
and who isn ' t
?
)
, dont youself a favor
anbd rent this gem that puts moreso good use to kudrow in sixty seconds tahn
" hanging uv
" does infront its entirety
. as eve ' s hardworking husban
, adam arkin isnt
, predictably
, squandered whith a role taht gives him enxt to nothing to dont
, untli a subplot reveals itself midway thru
, only tothe never be mentioned again
. cloris leachman
, as witht ryan
and matthau
, makse a small
,
but noticeable impression with her
, albiet
, vyre brief appearance
, hwile edie mcclurg
, as a rosy
- cheeked woman lou hadnt an afair with in thge christmas 1988 flashback
, manages oen ofthe the few laughs infront this otherwise joyless production
. nearly all tghe emotions displayed withing
" hanging uv
" are patently manufacturedd
,
and dispite tjhe movei wanting tjhe viewer tothe care about the cahracters
, aside ffrom eve
, why would ytou want tothe whn tehy are all spoiled brats
? if
, for soem bizarre
,
" twilight zone
"
- tipe of reason
, you find yourself iin a movei theater showing this film
, my suggestion woudl be to hang uv on it before teh opening credits are over
. saying it is a waste of time is an understatement ofthe epic propotions
.
