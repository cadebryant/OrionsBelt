> from writer
and director darren stein comes jawbreaker
, tghe poorly told tale ofthe whta cin happn when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong
. at reagan high
, four girls are sitting on top ofthe hte world
. courtney shane
, played by rose mcgowan
, holds tghe title of meanest
, most disrespectful soul in the school
. everyone hates her
,
bu everyone envies her due to her popularaty
. courtney isnt hte
" leader
" ofthe her clique
, whihc also includes julie
, played by rebecca gayheart
, liz purr
, palyed by charlotte roldan
,
annd marcie
, plyed by julie benz are tghe other three in thte gropu
. it is liz ' s seventeenth birthday
,
anbd julie
, courtney
,
and marcie concur that htey will play a seemingly innocent prank on her
,
but the prank results iin tyhe death of liz
. jstu liek stupid teens in any teen directed film such as htis one
, tghe foursome deside tothe cover uv teh death tothe mkea it look liek a muder committed by someone else
.
anbd also jstu like in otehr teen directed movies
, one ofthe the four don ' t agree wih hiding it
, htis time that charachter bieng julie
.
and finally
, jsut like inspite other teen movies
, ther is a wittness outside thge group trying tothe hide the truth
. thsi tiem thgat character being fern mayo
( judy greer
)
, who isnt subject to many cracks from courtney ' s group
, as well as the entire skool
.
> fomr here
, jawbreaker turns inot a predicatble tale ofthe revenge
, bad morals
,
anbd at least trying to dont the right thing
. nto only isnt tyhe script weak
, on a wohle teh acting is horrid thanks to a large amount ofthe the main casted
. judy greer isnt undeniably awful as her oen dimensional
, annoying character
, as she overacts every line she has
. allso on thte bad side ofthe acting is julie benz
, almsot falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers
. on hte positive side of acting
, rose mcgowan performs well here
,
bu doesn ' t match her wickedly clever peformance as
" tatum
"
, inspite 1996 ' s scream
. mcgowan ' s role is annoying
,
but tihs onyl adds tothe the film
. she is wickedly mean
,
annd even
though she a well
- written character
, you downright hite her
. faring even better tahn mcgowan is rebecca gayheart
, who isnt alwyas exceptionally believeable as her roles
. whn the script feeds her a oen or twpo dimensional character
, she turns it into threee
, allways putting storng emotion
and pwoer inot her roles
. gayheart isn ' t given as much tothe do here as she was in 1998 ' s urban legend
,
but you cxan still git a storng taste of her acting skills inaddition jawbreaker
. jawbreaker drifts
annd mianders differnt sub plots thoughout
, hardly throwing anytying fo the viewer to get asorbed in
. we get way off ofthe the topic ofthe the jawbreaker incident
,
and git into thigsn that don ' t have anytying to do wtih thte actual film
. yhe beginning
annd ending are strong
, it ' s just the middle tyhat needs a lot ofthe help
. durring the body ofthe the movei
, it is undeniably repetitive
, never progressing towards a conclusion
. nothing tothe grab the viewer ' s interst is aroud
,
adn the smae
, extemely annoying song plays over
and over again
. jawbreaker tries to git off on thte same tiome of humor used in the 1995 film clueless
,
bu falls flat
. the few gags taht actually wrok die off quickly
anbd die off with a bing
. all in all
, a horrible disappointment
. yhe bottom line
: the tagline reads
,
" even thte sweetest candies are sour as death inside
.
" yes
, that is too true
. no matter how ogod this film may hvae looked
, it fails to deliver
.
