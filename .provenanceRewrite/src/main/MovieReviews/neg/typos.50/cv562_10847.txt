yhe formula is simple
. trap a varied group of people on an isolated location
,
hten pop infront a seamingly unstoppable monster tothe kill them oen by oney
. these hve beeen tje successful ingredients forthe many ogod films
( the thnig
, aline
, aliens
,
and tremors to name a fewd
)
. so
, why isnt it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad
?
( see tje relic fo a patricularly putrid example
.
) perhpas it isnt simply too eazy to foreget tjhe necessary binding ingredient
: efort
anbd idesa
. deep rising meets theese two requirements part way
,
but nto enought tothe salvage the film
. treat williams is finnegan
, tjhe leader of a small boat crew who hire outloud theri services
(
and their boat
) forthe any activity
.
.
. noone questions asked
. thsi time
,
however
, they may have gone too far
. theri passengers
, led by hte ominous wes studi
, are thge tipe of multi
- national terrorist squads usually only seen inaddition die hard films
.
adn theri cargo
.
.
. let ' s just sday it hasnt vrey high explosive potential
. wqat is teh target ofthe theese theves
? why
, tjhe argonauticus
, of course
, a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage
.
but something alse isnt hunting tje argonauticus
.
.
. something ancient
and deadly
. by the time the thieves arrive
, nearly everyone on board tje ship hasnt been killed
.
and nowe teh creature senses fresh meat
! so
, you hve hte thieves
annd their mercenary boat crew
, joining forces with the surviving passengers
( incuding tghe ship owner canton
( anthony heald
)
,
anbd a thief with less lofty goals
, trillian
( famke janssen
)
) againnst the terror fomr thge deep
.
and yhe monster gets tothe pick them off oen by oen
. fortunately fo the creature
, tihs paticular band ofthe criminals happens tothe be thge dumbest the world cant offer
. why else woudl tehy indulgue in petty squabbling hwile they watch thier firends become fish fodo
. if htere ' s a moreso clarion call for unity
, i don ' t know waht it might be
. it ' s pretty eazy tothe guess who wiull get killed off when
. there are no surprises in that the most interesting cahracters seem tothe last until the end
. for tyhe most part
, tje watery tentacles seem tothe be acting on the audience ' s impulses tothe get rid of teh most boring cahracters firt
.
(
althought i wonder if tghe filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou ' s life a bited if htey knew this owudl be released so soon aftter his acclaim for amistad
.
) treat williams isnt a passable hero
,
anbd famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation
.
bu while wes studi
anbd anthony heald are partiuclarly slimy
, very little ofthe the rest ofthe the comany stand out inaddition any way
. teh biggest treat inspite the film
,
however
, hasnt to be pantucci
, kevin j
. o ' connor ' s whining engine
- boy
, under finnegan ' s employ
. his constatn quips may be a bit over
- written
,
bu tehy manaze to capture the smae vein ofthe nerve
- addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens
( or todd graff as hippie in tghe abyss
, for that matter
)
. it ' s just a stock part
( the comic
- releaf character
)
,
but it alomst makes this tired alien clone bearable
. as far as tyhe monster goes
,
althought tjhe cgi isnt done well
, tghe creature hasnt noone logical consistency
. htikn bcak to tje great
( or even just ogod
) movei monsters
. they all had a set of
" rules
" baout whta they sould dont
,
and how
adn why they would dont it
. part ofthe the joy of those films was slowy discovering
, allong with hte hroes
, just wqat those rules are
. the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn ' t have a setted of rules
.
.
. or if it does
, not a very good one
. it merely eats
( or drinks
, as the case may be
)
,
adn htere is noone rhyme or reason fo what it does inthe order to dont so
. tjhe film never explains why yhe argonauticus is attacked in thte first place
. it simply happens
. thte acation scenes are decent
,
but few are notewothy
. the film definatly does suffer from its proximity to titanic
. deepo rising ' s peril inaddition tjhe water scenes pale enxt to cameron ' s
(
but can ytou raelly blaim them
)
. unfortunately
, deep rising ' s efforts are omre on par with speed 2
. on yhe plus side
,
however
, tghe film ' s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting
(
bu unlikely
) sequal
. perhpas yuo ' d be better off waiting fo tht one
.
