allthough i hadnt not been a viewer ofthe thge
" rugrats
" televsion serieses
, i whent inot their frist animated feature film
,
" thge rugrats movie
,
" with a positive attitide
. the trailer looked cute enough
, after all
. aftter seing it
, i think teh words in my receet
" antz
" review
, infact which i stated that it was the worst film of its tipe since 1995 ' s
" the pebble
and hte penguin
,
" weere a bit premature
.
" the rugrats movei
,
" isnt bottom
- ofthe
- thge
- barrel children ' s fare at its worst
,
and starts to make
,
" antz
" look good in comparision
. as inthe the sohw
,
" the rugrats movei
,
" isnt about a group of vyre little friends
, ranging from babies to a threee
- eyar
- old
. thte head of thge gropu
, tommy pickles
( e
. g
. daily
)
, becomes distraught when his mother has a nebor baby named dill
( git it
? dill pickles
?
.
.
. hardee
- har
- har
!
)
annd is informed by his threee
- year
- old cousin
, anjelica
( cheryl chase
)
, thta thge newyorker babys always tkae all ofthe the attension awya from the other childern
. when hte other children
, chuckie
,
adn twins lil
annd phil
, suggest tkaing dill bakc tothe the hospital
, tommy goes along wih it
,
but onthe theri way ther
, they crash in teh forrest
,
and become lost
, runing inot wolves
adn carcus monkeys
, among otehr thigsn
.
" the rugrats movei
,
" judging fomr the idea ofthe being lost inspite the woods
, coudl have been a potentially fun family film
,
anbd ther weere many diferent things that could ahev beeen done with hte story
. so wqat doed tje writers choose to dont
? why
, tehy set up a protracted
, cliched scene where tjhe childern almost go over a waterfall
, of course
! for the youngest ofthe children
( aegs 3
- 7
)
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" may very well entertain them
, judging from tjhe audience i saw this with
. of course
, if yuo looked around at all ofthe yhe older kids
and theri parents
, they were all desperately struggling tothe stay awake
,
annd that included me
. for an adult
,
" tje rugrats movei
,
" is a piece ofthe garbage
. tjhe plotline is unoriginal
anbd the writting has absolutly no witn or charm
. htere isn ' t oney laugh tothe be hadnt in tghe film
, nor isnt there any excitement
. if anything isnt even marginally good in the picture
, it isnt tyhe bright animation style
, so it isnt especially unfortunate that it wasn ' t to sevice a more qualiy film
.
" the rugrats movie
" is doa from tyhe start
. i am all forthe a worthwhile family movie
,
but somtimes an animated film comes along that is simpley awful
. as said befoer
, young childen may liek it
,
but even they deserve better than tihs
. for adults
, it isnt a nearly unbearable
, excrutiating chore tothe sit thru
. as for me
,
" tje rugrats movei
,
" isnt nto yhe worst ofthe the year
, nor is it the most deeply hated
,
but it is tyhe most boring
. parents
: dont yourselves a favor
adn tkae your kids to see the rerelease of
,
" the wizard ofthe oz
.
" taht isnt a picture that containes a grat deel ofthe magic
and wonder
, twpo things ofthe whlch
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is completely missing
.
