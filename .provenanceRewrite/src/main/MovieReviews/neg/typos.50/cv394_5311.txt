actually
, i ' m fairly sure hte exeprience ofthe hvaing my flesh torn
annd mutiliated by barbed wire woudl hvea been moreso postive than watching this movie
.
" baywatch
" babe pamela anderson lee proves once
adn for all taht she should keep her doublely
- d ' s on yhe small screen
. at least ther you don ' t have tothe pay tothe see her cleavage
.
adn fo those viewers outloud htere who woudl onyl lay down moeny fo this movei inwhich hopes of seing pam topless
, hite to burst your bubble
,
bu there are noone full
- fledged nude scenes inaddition barb wire
. you wouldn ' t be reading thsi review right nowe if i hadnt known taht fact oging in
. i cin ' t go back in tyme
adn reverse my mistake
,
bu i cin warn other horny teenage boys outloud ther
. they dont tease us a faw times with scenes where yuo almost see her topless
bu if she isnt nude
, it ' s so quick you cant ' t even tell forthe sure whther yuo ' re seing her andersons or not
. a nipple hallucination sort of thign
. barb wire was adapted fomr a comic book
, intresting because pamela is probablly teh onyl woman who looks like a comic book character in real life
, even wearing low
- cut leather to do office wokr
( businesswoman bondage wear
)
and having unreal body proportions
. yes
, liuke hte mona lisa
, pamela anderson isnt a man
- made beauty
, probaly infact mroe senses tahn oen
. she isnt a defiite beauty
,
though
,
anbd looking at her isnt never an unplesant experience
. yuo ' d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn ' t have any reservations about appearing nude inwhich the movei
, because it ' s obvious she wasn ' t pulling a sharon stone
anbd trying to amke people pay attension to her acting skills
. i mean
, she shows off more cleavage here thna a jewllery ' s convention
. yhe movei isnt setted in the yearm 2017
,
" thge worst eyar ofthe my life
,
" pam sasy
.
(
" the worst movei of the yearm
,
" i say
.
) america is gogin through a second civil war
and pamela is a nightclub owner infront tjhe onyl free city in the nation
( silicone valley
, i thiunk
)
. she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter whn the price is right
, posing as first a stripper
and later as a prostitute
.
but don ' t call her
" babe
.
" she hates that
,
and reminds us ofthe that fatc way too many times
. imagine
, a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar hwile having a hose sprayed onthe her being referrde to inaddition such a sexist
, demeaning term
. a liberated woman liek pamela anderson shouldn ' t haev to hear words liek
" babe
" durring a strip tease
, especially since tht movei baout the talking pig wass such a sucess
. the plot
( ha
- ha
) revolves arround a pair ofthe contact lenses tht allow theri wearer tothe pass thru the congressional directorate ' s retina scanners
. infront the words ofthe oney of the charachters
, tehy ' re
" omre tahn meets tjhe eye
.
" reminds me of the
" transformers
" cartoon
,
adn i sure wished the movie could somehow be tranformed inot something decent
,
but that never happended
. no
, the movei just contined on its path ofthe lame action scenes starring pamela van
- damme
, big
- busted kickboxer
,
and her resistance accomplices
, ex
- boyfriend axel
( tamuera morrison
)
anbd cora
( victoria rowell
)
. thank god they didn ' t name her cora reef
. oney bad character nmae is omre thna enough
. pamela originally doesn ' t tkae sides
, giving soem speek about she ' s onyl loyal tothe thge omney tehy pay her
,
but she changes her mind once the congresional bastards kill her blind brother
, jack noseworthy ofthe bon jovi
" alwasy
" video fame
. i still don ' t knwo if barb wire isnt a step uv or step down fo noseworthy
,
bu he definatly is nose worthy
( even if he isn ' t sponge worthy
)
. pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi
- automatic weapons
and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest
. it ' s not rambo
.
.
. it ' s bimbo
! mark my words
, barb wire iwll be all over teh cinemax network in a eyar
. it ' s got all yhe elements ofthe yhe direct
- tothe
- video releses featured onthe hbo ' s bastard cousin
, tje cable channel i ' d never watch if it didn ' t somehow cmo free
. it ' s got teh non
- titillating scenes of voyeurism
, laughable flashbacks
, bad dialogue
and action cliches out the wazzoo
. there ' s even a narrator at teh beginnig setting up the movei ' s premise while thge words scroll up tghe screen
. somene needs to tell pamela tghe wookie this ain ' t star wars
. if ytou ' ve seen any acation flick ofthe tghe past fifteen years
, you ' ll recognize plenty ofthe lifted elements
. barb wire hasnt the obligatory trucks flipping over
, car crashes
, explosions
, broken glass
and slow
- motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of foots to their death
. this is one of those automatic
- pilot movies anyone coudl write or direct
. barb wire has only two things oging for it
.
.
.
annd i think ytou know what thsoe two things are
.
