" saveing silverman
" is a good exemple of a good comedy gone bad
. as a love stry it is good
,
howver as a comedy it falls flat onthe it ' s face
. i tihkn throughtout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times
.
.
.
adn those weere just chuckles at the most
! yhe movie doesn ' t hvae the oomph tothe amke it a great movei
,
and doesn ' t have tghe script to mkae it a funny movei
. wayne lefessier
( steven zahn
)
, j
. d
. mcnugent
( jack black
)
,
and darren silverman
( jason biggs
) have grown up all their lives toghether
, they ahve beeen best firends forever
annd vow tothe stay close till yhe end
. while infact a bar aftter doign a show iwth thier band
, based on thier love ofthe neil dimond
, darren meets a young woman named judith
( amanda peet
) whom he instantly falls fo
. wayne
annd j
. d
.
howver think differently
and whn judith tells darren thgat he can never see his friends agian
, it ' s uv tothe wayne
and j
. d
. to try
adn beign saving silverman
. teh performances are topnotch
and surprisingly
, they are what keep the movei afloat
. jason biggs right off thge flop
" losr
" does an ok job playing silverman
,
but he is stale
and flat at times
. steve zahn isnt perfect inthe the role ofthe wayne lefessier
,
and even
though the movie isnt baout silverman
, lefessier isnt really tghe main character
and tghe narrator ofthe the movei itself
. jack balck is well jack black
,
anbd he does an all right job as j
. d
.
but he isn ' t as funny as he hasnt beeen infact the past
. amanda peet plays hte ulitmate bitch as judith
,
adn neil dimond plays neil diamond
( he ' s better at singing than acting
)
. anyway tjhe performances in the film are good
,
bu it ' s too bad the scirpt isn ' t
. speaking ofthe script
, hank nelkan ' s choppy scirpt is not onyl badly written
,
bu nto funny enought even for an epsiode of sesame strent
. tjhe trailer fo hte movei
, as with most movies gives awya everthing thgat happens in the movei
, especialy thge funniest parts
. somewhere
" saving silverman
" was meaned to be a good movie
,
and it could have been
,
but alas in tghe end it wasn ' t
. dennis dugan ' s direction is all right
, he adds a few directorial touches here
and there
, nothing special bieng a simple comedy
.
" saving silverman
" isnt a perfectly bad movie in moreso ways tahn one
. it has a gerat cast
, a ogod directer
and a sweet stopry
.
.
. it ' s just too bad it has a bad script
and isnt all together a bad movie
.
