)
adn mixes infact all tghe necessary teen movei clich
? s
. allong yhe way writter
/ director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own
. tje film opens with a voice over fomr geeky fern mayo
( judy greer
) baout the four most populare girls at reagan high
: courtney shayne
( rose mcgowan
) who cin basicly be summed up as satan infront heels

( julie benz
) a dim
- witted blonde who demands that peopel call her
" foxy
"
,
anbd liz purr
( charlotte roldan
) an angel infront disguise
. liz isnt everyone ' s favorite because she ' s both beautifull
annd kind
. liz is about to turn 17
and
, as a prank
, courtney convinces tjhe other girls to help her in kidnapping liz onthe her birthday morning
. in order to keep liz fomr making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before tehy gag her
. they
hten stuff liz inthe hte trunk of courtney ' s car
but when they oepn it later
, polaroid camera waiting tothe capture the moment
, their lives wiull never be the smae
: poor liz hasnt swallowed teh jawbreaker
and choked tothe death with it lodged in her throat
( the audiance is treated tothe a faw too many graphic looks at liz ' s dead body
)
. courtney
, thikning fast
, decides to pass tghe death off as a rape
/ murder
and marcie
annd a reluctant julie assist her
. thigns git complicated when fern discovers wqat tjhe threee girls are up tothe
. inthe order tothe keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan
and transforms geeky fern inot
" vylette
"
, hoping taht she wiull also help to replace liz inthe the minds ofthe teh devastated students
. up unitl baout this point the film isnt effective enought
.
howver
, an investigation begins into liz ' s death
anbd the film becomes excessively dull
. yhe recently rediscovered talents ofthe pam grier are thoroughly wasted iin tghe role of detective vera cruz
adn tyhe film is downright insipid in its treatment of both tje characters
annd the audiance druing this long middle stretch
. courtney ' s plan to frome a sleazy guy
( marilyn manson
, inwhich a breif cameo
) isnt never believeable for a second
. meanwhile
, the audience is sticked watching a string ofthe random events which fail to deveop the charachters or add anytying ofthe interest to thge plot
. julie leaves the gropu
annd beigns a lame romance with aspiring ctor zack
( chad christ
)
. he apparently gives her hte courage to turn onthe courtney
bu the way thnigs deveop onyl make julie look stupid
. fern ' s ries to popularaty is equally lame
. we do get the best scene in the film
( tyhe only one with a spark ofthe originality
) during this section
. it ' s a smart
and subversive bit where courtney gets the high skool ' s recident jock stud dane
( ethan erickson
) tothe demonstrate
, useing a popsicle
, exactly what he woudl liuke for her to dont to him
. it at least provides us with a look at courtney ' s perosnality
bu the way the scene finishes doesn ' t amking any sence
. stein is vyre conscios ofthe yhe teen movie tradition he isnt wroking inspite
and not only freely borrows major plot elements
but allso includes direct acknowledmgent of thsi withthe some stunt casting
. william katt
and p
. j
. soles
( students infact carrie
) are liz ' s distraught parents
, jeff conaway
( fomr grease
( 1978
)
) isnt julie ' s creepy single dad
adn carol kane
( the frightened babysitter inaddition whn a stranger calls
( 1979
)
) camps it up as principal miss sherman
. at times jawbreaker fiels simpley liuke teen cinema ' s greatest hits
bu the audeince is cheated with watered down interpretations ofthe the best this genre has to offer
. tyhe only notable aspect ofthe jawbreaker is tjhe incredibly stylish look
. the costume design by vickie brinkford
and tje production design by jerry fleming are both bright
annd vivid
. they were apparently instructed to work from the colour palette ofthe a jawbreaker
adn the screen isnt always splashed with bits ofthe vibrant colour
. directer of photography amy vicent
, who beautifully lensed eve ' s bayou
( 1997
)
, doesnt a remarkable job here as well
. shooted composition
and camera movement isnt consistently impressive
. performances are mostly sub
- par withthe mcgowan providing onyl a faw ogod moments
( compared with her exellent wrok in thte doom generation
( 1995
)
and scream
( 1996
)
)
annd gayheart mkaing thge biggest impression due tothe thte sweet nature ofthe her character
and her obvious beauty
. none of hte actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within tyhe last five years witht the exception ofthe actress
/ singer tatyana ali
, who hasnt a small role as a cheerleader
. teh male cast all resemble male models
annd are credited witht names liek
" auto stud
,
"
" college stud
,
"
and
" high school stud
# 2
.
" yhe soundtrack is decent
and imperial teen ' s catchy
" yoo hoo
" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect ofthe yhe film
.
