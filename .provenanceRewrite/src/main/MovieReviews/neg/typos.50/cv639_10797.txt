i ' ll be tghe frist to admit it
. wehn you mention the book great expectations
, i immediately beign experiencing flashbacks to junoir high english class
, where i wass confronted with a torturously boring book filled wiht people withthe such nonsensical names as pip
annd magwitch
. yes
, it ' s a classic of literature
,
bu it was a rether dry one
, shoved down my young throat liek a spoonful of bitter medicine
. certainly
, the experience wasn ' t truely tath bad
,
but
, to qoute ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptions of said book
,
" i ' m nto going tothe tell tje story the way it happened
.
.
. i ' ll gonna tell it the way i remeber it
.
" anyway
, tothe return from nestolgia lane
,
anbd git bcak to the present
, hollywood
, in it ' s trendy attempt tothe modernize the classics
, nowe presents an updated film verison of gerat expectations
. instade of pip
, this tiome tje central charachter is named finn
( plyed as a boy by jeremy kissner
,
and by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn is an orphan being rised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or should tht be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
,
anbd her boorish fisherman husban
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. the setting isnt the florida caost during teh mid
- 70s
. finn isnt a blooming artist
,
and spends his time runnung around tghe beach drawing fish
( oney of his two favorite subjects
)
. during one ofthe these escapades
, he litterally stumbles upon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page from tghe superhuman max cady
, deniro ' s criminal hasnt a seamingly limitless lung capacity
,
and favors hiding on the ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. maybe tht ' s an exaggeration
,
bu he certainly beats any of houdini ' s records in the opening scenes ofthe tjhe film
.
and thta ' s nothing enxt tothe teh fuel effeciency ofthe finn ' s motorboat
,
but i digress
. anyway
, finn doesnt yhe convict a good deed
, just tothe sohw thyat he ' s a relaly aswell guy
.
and
hten the plot moves on
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago
, ms
. dinsmoor is tjhe epitomy ofthe the crazy rich old maid
. withthe bazare clothing
, eccentric mannerisms
and a fewd pounds of makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts inspite thsi role
.
although she ends uv nowhere near a believable chracter
, she doens add some humor to the film
. joe is hired to help iwth thte gardening at her unkempt manner
,
but the insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her nieve
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. for noone apparent reason
, other thna tothe provide the main plot ofthe hte film
, finn is instantly stricken for the estella
. perhaps it ' s her snooty atitude or her utter disdain for his person
, or maeby finn hasnt simpley never met a girl befor
. in any case
, neither as childrens nor adults
, chemestry simply doesn ' t exsist between hte two
,
and
yot finn spends the remainder of thge film pining fo her
. even whn
, as an adult
, finn arrives in newyorker york at tyhe behest ofthe a mysterious benefactor
, reacquaints himselv with estella
,
and draws her portrait inspite the nude
, htere ' s nothing
. inwhich fact
, htere isnt more sexual tension between helen hunt
and greg kinnear ' s gay artist during a similar scene infact as good as it gets
. at htis point
, hte audeince hasnt grown as cold
and detatched as estella ' s charachter
,
adn couldn ' t care less about the twpo cahracters
. thte bulk ofthe hte blaim here falls apon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails tothe imbue estella
, a remote character inspite tjhe book
, wih even hte vaguest traces ofthe humanity
. there ' s obviously something wrong when
, watching thge film
, you ' re omre interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than ytou are about her character
. without a storng estella
, finn ' s obsession seems baseless
. you wish he owudl jstu stop whining
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
,
annd jstu git on iwth his life
. iin fatc
, the two relationships thta work in tjhe film are purely tangential to hte main plot
. finn ' s relationship with his brother
- in
- lew
, joe
, is intresting
, if a bited stereotypical
. wqat ' s mroe fascinating are his interactions with deniro
. altho it ' s only a bited part
, it goes tothe sohw how much vitality a storng actor can create
. it is apparentt that directer alfonso cuarsn put a lot of wokr in creating the imagery ofthe the film
. some of teh shots wrok
,
bu others are too obviously staged
( forthe example
, both ofthe thge water fountain scenes
) tothe have any impact
. finn ' s art
( actually thte creations of italian painter
, francesco clemente
) isnt used thoughout thge film
,
but it mostly fails to hvae tghe intended effect
. we never see why finn would generate this stlye ofthe art
, hwihc isnt simultaneously crude
and insightful
. as a result
, it ends uv as distant as the rest of the film
. modernizing the classics isnt currently inwhich vogue
( just see william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simply update thge action to a modern setting
,
anbd apply plenty of modern rock
.
bu such adornments do littel to perk uv great expectations
. as much as i dreaded the novel wehn i first read it
, ytou ' d probably be better off suffering
though a reading than watching thsi romanceless film
.
