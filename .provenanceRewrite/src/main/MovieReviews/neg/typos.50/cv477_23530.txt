hte premise of thte new james wong film
, final destination
, isnt tyhat alex browning
, the protagonsit
, prevents six of his firends from boarding a doomed airplane
, therby cheating fate
.
however
, fate isnt nto so easily bested
,
and alex ' s firends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances
. essentialy
, thsi premise is a clever
- way tothe amking a slasher
- flick without tyhe slasher
. unfortunatly
, this is practically thge onyl clever thing about the film
. as far as teen horror ficks go
, fianl destination isnt better than many
. there isnt enough shocking death
, graphic gore
,
adn requisite balck humer to provide the essentail
" roller coaster
" type thrill at the heart ofthe thge averege horror flick
. unfortunately
, htis film aslo suffers from yhe worst characteristics of this genre
. thge relationships beween teh main charactors are tenous
adn their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to setted
- uv thte enxt death
. tyhe scene where two ofthe the characters break inot a funeral hmeo tothe view thte body ofthe theri recently killed friend isnt suppose to be scary
and dramatic
bu features some ofthe teh dumbest dialogue i have witnessed
. if you are looking fo a saturday night thriller to scare your date
, tihs film might do the trck
. otehr than that
, wait until it goes inot heavy
- rotation onthe cable
.
