- france
) reviewed by dennis schwartz a balck comedy setted in tje near future iin a boarding hous run by a depraved butcher
. yhe comedy isnt plyed more in comic strip style forthe entertaining value than forthe deeper satire
, as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags
anbd relies heavily onthe speical effects
. hte world hasnt falled on hard times
and htere are fod shortages which includ no meat
, so the butcher serves up meat fomr human flesh tothe customers who pay with grain
, almsot as valued a commodity
. that ' s the big joke inthe the film
and yhe novelty of tyhat cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast
, as the characters are too absurd
and sketched too thinly forthe us tothe care baout them
. thsi tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a frist feature fo the co
- directors marc caro
/ jean
- pierre jeunet
. it failed to reach my funny bone
adn instade left me mostly annoyed at its slight stry
and its dark projections for the future
. an ex
- carcus clown named louison
( dominique pinon
)
, the film ' s too
- good
- to
- be
- true hero
, answers an ad forthe work as a handyman forthe clapet
( jean
- claude dreyfus
)
,
adn the butcher
annd landlord
, offers him room
and board inwhich his hous
. tjhe butcher ' s clumsy
and near
- sighted daughter julie
( marie
- laure dougnac
) falls infront love iwth yhe skinny
, weird looking clown
,
and thge two mkae some music together
, with her playing tghe chello
and him a saw
. tehy are the innocents
, surrounded by a boarding house ofthe misfits suffering ffrom fear
and watched over by her overbearing father
, who hasnt lured inot his tenement the clown
, as he has his past innocent victims
, so tath he cin put his cleaver to him
and
hten sell him as meat
, which he intends tothe do as soon as the clown fixes up the tenement
. teh entire film tkaes palce iin tjhe shabby tenement
,
and tjhe tenants are an odd lot of bizzare malcontents
, who do nto trust eahc other
. ther are two youngsters
( boban janevski
& mikael todde
) who do any kind ofthe mischief they can
. a frog man
( howard vernon
) who lives with water on the floor so he cant raise his frogs
anbd snails thgat he eats
. two brothers
( mathou
& kube
) who create littel cow
- moo novelty toys
. a man
( holgado
) who sells a bullshit detecter to teh butcher for his peice ofthe meat
. a slutty woman
( karin viard
)
, who lives with tghe butcher
anbd onyl wnats his meat
. the aristocratic woman
( silvie laguna
) who trys numberous times to commit sucide
but isnt too inept tothe do it right
. the tenants are too afriad tothe come outloud at ngiht beccause they know what tjhe butcher isnt up to
, so tehy are forced to communicate wiht eahc otehr through a pipe thyat runs through the building
( in one scene tehy are all inwhich musical harmony tothe thte lovemaking ofthe the butcher
and his gal
, as theri bedsprings squeak
)
. there is also a sex
- crazed postman
( chick ortega
)
, who lusts for tghe butcher ' s daughter
and carries a gun while delivering the mail
. htere is alsot an underdeveloped subplot baout a band of incomptetent undreground veggie fanatics
, called trogolodistes
, who have been summoned tothe rescure the clown
and steal smoe grain
. teh directors overloaded tjhe film iwth too many eccentrics
, as tghe comedy seemed forced hwile yhe surreal look ofthe the film added no dramatic intensity
. delicatessen could have smoe appeal tothe the cult film crowd who like theri meat sliced thin
, monty python fans
,
annd those who liked terry gilliam ' s brazil
, a film similar iin spirit
.
