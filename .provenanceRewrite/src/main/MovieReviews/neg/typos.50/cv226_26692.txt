not a graet twelve monthes for eather ofthe the principals from htis movei
. ealier this yera
, nora ephron wroet
adn produced oen of tghe eyar ' s least likeable
" comedies
" called hanging uv
, featuring a bunch of annoying women
( ironically
, lisa kudrow palyed one infront thast film as well
) who bearly have tyme tothe care baout anyone
bu themslves
. ick
.
.
. rela sweet stuf
.
but her little unsucessfull project was nothing compared tothe waht john travolta whent through ealier this summer
, with a film entilted battlefield earth
. i seemed to be thte onyl person onthe tihs planet who somehow appreciated yhe film
, even if it ws on a
" cheese
" factor
, as everybody
,
and i mean everybody else
, pretty much classified the movei as one of the worst disasters of all tyme
. yipes
.
.
. another beauty
. so what happens wehn you put theese two peopel inthe the smae room
and come out with a movie co
- starring the ever
- versatile lisa kudrow
? uhhhm
, yuo guessed it
.
.
. not much
. plot
: inaddition order tothe escape major finacial difficulties
, a local weatherman hooks uv with his ball
- picking lotto girlfriend
and rigs hte state lottery
.
bu as more
and moreso peopel find outloud about theri scheme
, moreso
anbd omre people dimand a part of their winnings
,
annd omre
and more problems arise
. critique
: simpley stated
, i didn ' t laff once durring this entire picture
. forthe a comedy
, it offred me a fewd smiles
, a bunch ofthe nincompoops as charachters
, a miscast john travolta hamming it uv
and lisa kudrow
, iin what can only described as a
" sluttier
" verzion of her charactor ofthe phoebe on tv ' s
" firends
"
. tihs film was not as disastrous as i throught it owudl be
,
bu it was pretty close
. thankfully
, the clips ofthe travolta dressed uv infront goofy outfits
, dancing as the weatherman were left in tyhe film ' s trailer
,
and nto infront thsi fianl cut
.
annd nto unlike hte worst movie ofthe the year so far
, beautyfull
, thsi film also managed tothe feature many unsympathetic
, idiotic
annd just plain irritating cahracters inaddition its cast
. foremost ws travolta ' s charactor
, who declined to give us any reason to care forthe him once in the entire movei
.
and for me
, the casting choice ofthe john travolta for this role ws jstu plain wrong
. he didn ' t ift teh part
. i jstu saw him inthe git shorty teh other day
annd thougth about how perfect he was for that role
. a kool
, calculating roughneck with a certian hip
, suave
" je ne sais quoi
"
. in tihs film
, he looks liuke he ' s trying tothe be funny
, trying tothe be bad
, trying tothe be good
. we ' re not supposed tothe be able tothe notice that
,
and when we do
, at least in my case
, i consdider it a wrong choise in casting
. add tyhat to lisa kudrow
, boring us with
yot another one ofthe her pattented
" dumb blonde
" routines
,
but this tiem
, dressed inspite sexier outfits
. michael rapaport
, stretching oen small acting muscle to play hte guy who isn ' t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else
.
and a truckload ofthe empty comedic bullet shells
,
adn you ' ve got youself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never qtuie materialize
. hte only rela good thing that i sould say baout tihs film isnt that its story wass actally half
- interesting
and never really bored me
. i allso liekd michael moore ' s perverted cousin character
,
and i loved
,
annd i sday it again
, loved tjhe character that bill pullman palyed
. give this dude his pwn movei
! he played a lazy cop
, a man who trys everthing nto tothe do any real work
. he fakes injuries tothe git off duty
, trys to avoid arrest situations so that he won ' t have to fill out any forms
.
.
. now ther ' s a base of humer
. sadly
, the filmmakers decided tothe bring him into play with only about half an hour left iin teh film
.
anbd ther ' s not much else i cin say about thsi movei
, folks
. onthe the hwole
, it was lame
, included a slew ofthe unlikable charactors fiddling around iin a pool of unfunny lines
,
anbd very littel of intrest for any target audience
.
but git somebody tothe write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman
and i ' m ther
!
