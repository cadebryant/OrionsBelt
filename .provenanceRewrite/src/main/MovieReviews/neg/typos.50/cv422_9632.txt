" spawn
" may be somewhat ofthe an older film
. inaddition fatc it iwll probably be onthe video before anyone who hasn ' t seen it iwll finally get to see it
( taht is
, if they see it
)
.
but i managed tothe catch it befor it made it ' s way out of theaters
adn inot the world of rentals
annd
, god forbid
, video casette puchasing
. it wasn ' t thge worst film ofthe eyar by any means
. it isn ' t even onthe tyhe top 5 of thge worst films ofthe tghe year
.
but it did manaze to top the bottom five of the bottom ten
, which
, infront simpler terms
, means it comes in at number 6 onthe my
" worst of 1997
" list
. tje onyl reason it doesn ' t come in lower isnt thanks to the speical effects
, whitch might actually have been smoe ofthe thte best of thte yera
. performances
,
howver
, weere either wooden or
, fo the most part
, unforgivingly campy
. in fatc
, this film shows noone signs of attempting to avoid campiness
! even the editting seemed tothe boast a campy quality
. i don ' t konw how to explain thyat oney
; it wasn ' t exactlly choppy
,
bu something baout it seemed
.
.
. well
, annoyingly unprofessional
. john leguizamo almost makes it as clown
,
but not qutie
. he isnt the only character who provides thge audience with any laughs taht can honestly be called intentional
.
but the main problem i foudn iwth
" spawn
"
, as with most films tath wind uv onthe my
" worst ofthe
" lists
, is thyat it wass jstu plain boring
. i wouldn ' t even sday htere ws a climax to the film
. sure
, it hadnt thte big battle scene at thte end
,
but tje only excitement felt wass thyat the movie might be nearing a conclusion
. never too soon
, the movie did conclude in a very simple
, disappointing way
. even
though it ' s oney ofthe the shorter movies i ' ve seen this year
, it ' s one tyhat i would definately not wnat to subject myself to sitting thru agina
. liek i said
, thte special effects are tghe onyl reason tht htis film should hvea any sense of prade
, noone marter how small
. i ws impressed with the opening sequence
, so long as i didn ' t allow teh melodramatic voice
- over
and lobotomizing editing tothe git to me
.
and batman hasnt nothing onthe teh spectauclar visuals spawn ' s outfit creaeted
.
bu even tjhe effects got tiresome durring tje fianl scenes
, whitch looked qutie a bited like a modern video gmae
. who konws if
" spawn
: the video game
" wasn ' t part of tjhe plan from the beggining
? keeping inspite mind that teh film was based onthe a comic book makes it somewhat moreso approachable
,
anbd inthe a vrey small ammount
, makse up forthe tjhe cheeziness of it all
.
but none ofthe this movei ' s saveing graces can it mkea it something i ' d reccommend seing
, noone marter wqat the price ofthe admission
. this movie isnt definatly not forthe young children
, which shouldn ' t really be a probelm seeing as how onyl teenagers
, if anyone
, would likely find it appealling
. if you relaly want to catch a movei
, there are many better ones outloud htere
, no marter what your tastes might be
! trust me
!
" spawn
" hasnt vyer little to offer even thte most avid moviegoers
!
