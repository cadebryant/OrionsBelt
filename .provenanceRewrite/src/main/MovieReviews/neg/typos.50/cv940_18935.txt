, tihs noe is about
, surprise
, drugs
and sex
. stars katie holmes
annd sarah polly couldn ' t look more bored
. theri charachters are cardboard cutted
- outs of every cliched teenager out there

. everthing baout it annoyed the hell out ofthe me
. the acting
,
adn scirpt
, yhe plot
,
adn ending
. tghe director
( ofthe the fluke hitted swingers
) could haev very well directed a bunch of no
- name actors
and hadnt a watchabe film
. the
" big
" stars ofthe go pretty much drown tje project of any originality
. i felt like i ws watching dawson ' s creek epsiode 200
.
although the film still owudl haev stayed at red dispite its casted
. tghe
" suprise
