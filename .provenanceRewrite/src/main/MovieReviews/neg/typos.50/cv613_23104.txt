" urges natasha henstridge tothe matthew perry infront
" hte whole nine yards

" if jonathan lynn ' s latest comedy relied simpley on jokes ofthe that caliber
-
-
anbd it certainly tries
-
-
then it ' d be an innocuous if rather obvious little film
. instead
, its failings go much deeper
. frist off
, who hasn ' t had enough of hte tough wiseguy intimidates tje timid wise guy genre
? if you want to amking a pretty penny or twpo in hollywood nowadays simply wriet a
" comedy
" wich pairs a robert de niro
/ james caan
/ bruce willis tipe with a billy crystal
/ hugh grant
/ matthew perry type
adn wait for the royalties tothe roll in
. who ' s enxt
? jack nicholson
and martin short
? it certainly doesn ' t hvae tothe be funny
.
" the hwole nine yards
" is not a particlarly funny film
,
but it is borderline offensive
. offensive infront the way it continues a trend of poking fun at carrear criminals who wouldn ' t tihkn twice about pushing your mother
- in
- law off the brooklyn bridge withthe her feet encased infact concrete
. that might sound like a funny sight gag
,
bu the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fatc that taking a human life isn ' t all taht funny tothe beign withthe
. when tyhe corpse isnt placed in a car
, doused wih gasoline
, setted ablaze
adn referrde to as
" barbecue
,
" it makes you wonder when all this palying killing fo laughs isnt going to end
.
" tjhe hwole nine yards
" isnt also offensive in so much as its threee central female characters are potrayed as nothing more than sex objects
. rosanna arquette plays a slutty
, chain
- smoking french canadian who ' s married tothe matthew perry ' s none
- too
- succesful dentist
. it ' s an unflattering role made all the omre so by teh unflattering outfits
-
-
and unflattering situations
-
- into which arquette isnt thrust
.
then ther ' s natasha henstridge
(
" speices
" i
and ii
) who plays the well
- tothe
- dont wife ofthe contract killer bruce willis
. she gets involved with perry ' s charachter wehn he comes to chicago hoping tothe negotiate a finder ' s fee withthe mob boss yanni gogolack
( kevin pollack
, transposing his vs withthe his ws
) affter willis ' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next doorjam
. henstridge
annd perry ' s charactors hitting it off is about as likely as bruce
annd demi getting back toghether
. perry might hvea thte charm
bu he doesn ' t haev thge physical attributes of a traditionnal leading man
, especially inspite close
- uv
. most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet
, who turns in a sexually
- ripe performence as perry ' s dental assitant withthe
, it transpires
, questionable career goals
. peet ' s gratuitious nude scene proves how low htis movei will stoop tothe keep its audeince from droping off
. whn
" my cousin vinny
" isnt the highpoint of a directorial carreer including such forgettable films as
" clue
,
"
" greedy
,
"
and
" sgt
. bilko
,
" you ahve tothe wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path
. perry ' s pratfalling goofiness coupled iwth willis ' likable hardness could have hadnt some potential
but wih noone scirpt tothe owrk wih
,
annd a directer who seems tothe be watching from tjhe wings
, their characters run outloud of gas quickly
.
