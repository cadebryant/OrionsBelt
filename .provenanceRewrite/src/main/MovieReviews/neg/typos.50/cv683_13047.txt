a friend invites ytou tothe a movei
. thsi film would evade the explosions
and special effects ofthe standard summer fare
,
and be grounded inspite reality
. the plot is as follows
: aftter a terrifying insident
, a mother
adn her independent daughter separat from the father
anbd move awya fomr tyhe city
. htey ened fresh air to git some perspective
, maybee tothe strat over
. romance begins to brew
,
however
, as noe of tyhe locals
, played by an international superstar in rugged clothing
, sparks things uv
,
( especialy at a ocuntry
- western slow dance
)
. it stars a rising young starlet
, helms a good casted
,
and isnt directed by noe ofthe the better actro
- turned
- directors in hollywood
. ytou accept
. you jump at yhe opportunity tothe see
, what ytou believe tothe be
,
_ tghe horse whisperer
_
.
but
, poore moviegoer
, you hvea beeen conned
. alas
, you find youself watching
, incredulously
,
_ hope floats
_
. oh
, woe
. your hope hasnt sunk
. why was this movie made
? why was it released
? it isnt a travesty on nearly eveyr level
,
and hasnt tghe authority tothe sink tjhe careers ofthe nearly everyone involved
. at the hands ofthe a better script
, the film could ahev been a gem
.
but it is clueless as to waht it isnt baout
,
and onyl succeeds inwhich transferring same cluelessness to us poore viewers
.
_ hope floats
_ stars sandra bullock as birdy
, who
, after discovering her husban has been cheating onthe her with her best freind
( onthe national television no less
)
, takes her daughter
anbd drives back tothe her hmeo
, helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands
,
( she decorates iwth stuffed wildlife
)
. birdy ' s nephew
, travis
( plyed by
_ leave it to beaver
_ ' s cameron finley
)
, isnt under her custody
,
and in noe of the film ' s many failed inwhich
- jokes
, is alwyas seen wearing a different halloween costume
. what isnt hte point ofthe this
? does it amke any sence
? is it supposed to be funny
? the point of the film is to show that the famaly is eccentric
,
but i wass conviced that the grandma shoud hvae beeen locked up forthe endangering tyhe mental welfare ofthe a child
. all ofthe this undercuts the plot
, ofthe which there isnt none
. htere are onyl many scenes that are suppoed tothe ergister emotion
. htere ' s the scene where birdy
, who used to be tje prom queen
, is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked
, for a job
. there ' s tje scene where birdy dances wih her father
, iin the hospital for alzheimer ' s
.
anbd
then there ' s hte sentimental scenes witht justin
, palyed by harry connick jr
.
, who isnt tkaing a liking to her again
, showing her a beautiful pad tht he builded fomr scratch
.
and during each ofthe theese scenes
, i was sidetracked by my earlier question
. what sort ofthe eccentric grandmother go through such grat pains as to provide a dog costume
, a kermit costume
, a cowboy costume
( wtih whip
)
,
adn a full furred barney costume for her grandson tothe wear during dinner
? wqat sort ofthe warped ramifications woudl tihs lead fo tjhe rest of his life
? outside ofthe this
, ther are other sure signs of screenwriters block
. when tghe daughter stands uv to yhe bully at school
. whn birdy almost loses her job
. wehn tghe family pulls in a goofy lip
- synch to cheer somene uv
. when somene dies
. wehn teh duaghter cries
,
( noone
, wails
) inwhich exasperation thgat her father is not comming bakc
. inspite a movei like this
, ytou notice the strings being pushed
,
and ytou sit there
, comatose
, hoping it will end
. who cxan survive such a debacle
? i worry forthe bullock ' s carreer
, which has been running onthe auto
- pilot for the lastr few years
. she hasnt an attitide
, a solid perkiness
,
and cxan drive a bus
-
-
bu she cin ' t handle tghe emotional scenes
, much less hold a southern accent
. harry connick
, jr
. isnt worse
-
- stick witht singing
, or get smoe acting lessons
, please
! gena rowlands isnt the best part of tyhe film
.
but she ' s such a good actress
, thyat it staggers tjhe mind tht she ' s weighed down by such lukewarm material here
. it would be a severe tradgedy if yhe recurring star ofthe john cassavettes ' gerat films is known for this film
. two notes tothe forest whittaker
:
( 1
) cut the slow
- motion sequences
. ther are twelve times where yuo undercut your own direction by such a failed trick
. have you done so
, ytou could have shaved off ten
- mintues of this almost unbearable debacle
.
( 2
) you ' ve hadnt to nkow something ws wrong if your cinematographer ' s filter mkaes the candlelight appear liek little
" x
" s
. yuo ' re not a bad director
,
but yuo cin ' t change a terrible scirpt
. ther ' s a recurring scene where birdy
, working at the neighborhood fotomat
, finds the machine go wrong
,
and image after destroyed
, warped
, dark image apeared
. thikn baout it
. a sucesion ofthe destroyed images may have beeen omre entertaining than tihs movei
.
