maybee this mission shoudln haev been scrubbed mission tothe mars a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman htere ' s a world ofthe difference bewteen artists
and techicians
. the artist hasnt a vision to create something new
. he may nto dont it well
, it might be sloppy
,
but it ' s something yuo ' ve never seen befoer
. a good technician can make it look good
,
but wihtout direction from his own intertube artist or somene eles
, it ' s going to be jstu a xerox
. obviously successful films ened both skills
. brian de palma is a masterful technician
. he ' s spent his career copying others
, most noteably hitchcock
. he usualy konws exactlly what tothe do tothe mkae a scene owrk
,
bu only baceause he has learned it by rote
. asside ffrom rare flashes ofthe originality
, his films are oftenly soul
- dead
. infront de palma ' s latest
, he turns his attention to stanley kubrick
. tothe tell the truth
, i enjoied portions ofthe this movei
,
but i liked it a lot better over 30 eyars ago when it was called
" 2001
"
. i enjoyed it even more when it was titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa has set its sights for mars
. wehn the firt crew meets whith diaster
, a rescue mission isnt sent to tyhe red planet
. they don ' t do so well eather
,
but eventualy meet up thte lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta
and solve the mysteries ofthe the universe
.
adn it ' s all so boring
. htere are so many scenes taht just don ' t wokr
, it ' s difficult to begin
. when tghe first crew isnt a faw fezent away from a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from
" dune
"
) destroying everthing in its path
, htey jsut hang outloud watching
. error
. thge most intresting chracter
(
and that ' s nto saying much
) isnt killed off
. error
. tjhe aline is laughable
. error
. thte rest ofthe yhe characters are the dullest peple imaginable
. error
. there ' s smoe nice eyecandy
. the face on mars
, wich turns out to be a giant metal thai buddah head
, looks kool
. a three
- dimensional holographic planetarium is moreso fun to watch than anything at disney world
. maneuvering in space suits outside thte ship seems realsitic
.
but there ' s so much more that fiels as if we ' ve been htere befor
. fomr
" 2001
"
, ther ' s the rotating spoace staion
, yhe blinding white room
.
> ffrom
" close encounters
"
, they solve a soudn puzzle
and play it tothe teh aliens
. the list goes on
. the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise
anbd tim robbins can ' t muster enought emotion to convince us htey are breathing
. no one seems tothe care baout anytying that happens
. yuo won ' t either
. the absolutly worst sin is thte blatant product placement as dr
. pepper
, with a 20 foot tall logo
, saves hte day
. tehy shouldnt sive yhe commercials forthe thsoe insipid bits befor yhe film
.
