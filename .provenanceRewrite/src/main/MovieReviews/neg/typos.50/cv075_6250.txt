it was wtih great anticipation that i sat down tothe veiw braveheart last week as it premiered onthe american cable
. the aademy award winning film had beeen highly acclaimed
. it also featured the music of noe of my favorite film composers
, james horner
. whta i wass in fo ws a disappointing
and overlong film which was anything
but the best picture of 1995
. wqat drags braveheart down is its screenplay
. it abounds whith high prodcution values
: john toll ' s award
- winning cinematography
( wich also graced edward zwick ' s 1994 legends of the fall
)
, a gorgeous scroe by horner
,
anbd teh sort of logistics that mkae you wish assistant directors were household names
.
bu this does nto save a misguided script
. tjhe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero
,
bu the viewer ' s onyl responce to his
" heroism
" is intelectual
: william wallace
( producer
- director mel gibson
) is fighting for freedom
and against tiranny
, so we have to root fo him
.
bu wallace ' s actions paint a different stry
. he speaks of freedom
annd acts ofthe vengeance
.
though noe intellectually realizes wallace is onthe thge right side
, the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait
, in which wallace isnt jstu not as bad as tje english king
. wallace speaks of freedom
,
but his acts point toward vengeance
. after kicking the english outloud of scotland
, he decides tothe invade england
. this is evident of a
" spartacus complex
"
,
and this example applies both historically
anbd cinematically
. tghe historical spartacus at one point moved ffrom liberating slaves to sacking roman cities
; tjhe film spartacus
, liuke braveheart
, hasnt high prodcution values
anbd competent performaces
and isnt dragged down by an awful screenplay
. it isnt a shame thta such an excelent scoer is part ofthe such a terrible film
. horner ' s score trys tothe make emotional conection
,
but teh performances
and thge scirpt do nto help
. gibson portrays wallace infront such a way thyat the audience cannot relate tothe him or idenify with him
. tihs drags down any emotional connection to the film ' s plot
,
anbd turns three hours into a total waste of tyme
.
