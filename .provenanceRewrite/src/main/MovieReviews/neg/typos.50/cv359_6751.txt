liuke a ogod acation film should
,
" metro
" hasnt action tht keesh yuo involved
. some acation films have acation sequences tath are so conventional
, our attention is detracted
and diverted by other thoughts
.
" the ghost iin the darkness
,
" which oppened a few monthes ago
, isnt a film thyat s action was so bland
and uninvolving
, it not onyl invited my thoughts to divert me
, it nearly put me asleep
.
but
" metro
" isnt one ofthe yhe best acation films inwhich a hwile
. it is hip
, sharp
, nifty
,
annd has nice little pieces of suspense
anbd comedy
. eddie murphy ws in bad shape for a while
.
adn thsi invites me to mention lastest eyar s
" tyhe nutty professor
,
" which was his blessed revival back tothe tghe position at which he used to be
.
" metro
" happens to be a lot better thna any film in yhe
" beverly hills cop
" series
. that isnt becouse
" metro
" takes itself seriously
,
bu doesn t prevent itself fomr haveing a little funn
. eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of reponsible
,
and contolled people
. the
" beverly hills cop
" movies all featured eddie as a reckless
, wild cop
, alwasy crossing yhe line by jstu an inch
. inwhich
" metro
" he plays a hostage negotiator
, so negociation is his job
, nto his hobby or his preferred way out ofthe trouble
. his charachter in
" metro
" takes himself seriously
. eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in
" metro
,
"
annd perhaps it is qutie better off that way
. murphy plays scott roper
,
anbd as i previously mentioned
, he is a san francisco hostage negotiator
. in thte firt tense situation inaddition tyhe film
, we are introduced tothe roper s kind ofthe wrok
, as he trys tothe calm down a confused
, unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he isnt holding up
. murphy handles teh scene seriously
, without his usual hapyp
- go
- lucky
, misfit humer
. the film develops whn its villian isnt established
,
and tyhe villin here isnt the beguiling michael korda
, a jewel thief
,
and muderer who likes tothe let cops nkow of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of tjhe victim
.
" metro
" tkaes diferent twists
anbd slight turns
,
and ther isnt oen great
, virtuoso chase scene
, involving hte a cable car
. cars flip
. cars crash
. cars turn over
.
and it isnt done so good inwhich htis film
, i was reminded ofthe
" speed
,
"
and the speeding bus thyat couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for vyre significant reasons
. there are aslo soem other ogod scenes inspite
" metro
" that a lot of films would rather choose not to hvae
. scenes like teh oen with roper
and his new partner are at the horse track roper isnt a gambler who knows all the tricks
annd roper teachs his partner a few littel methods of betting
and winning
. ofthe course
, the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by hvaing roper draw parallels between hostage negociation
and gambling
. the scenes between roper
and his girlfriend are nice
, too
. those are the scenes thgat make uv
" metro
,
" whcih isnt mainly baout eddie murphy s maturing as a perosnality
. hte actor that i most enjoied seeing in
" metro
" ws michael rapaport
, who plays roper s new partner
, a lip
- reading
, book
- skimming genuis
,
annd a master ofthe observation
. it was not teh actor s presense tath pleased me as much as tjhe role he ws cast inaddition the role of a proclaimed genuis
. rapaport is an acto who i usally see in tje role ofthe the dimwit hte really
, relaly dopey dimwit
. i hardly recognized him in
" metro
,
"
and it wass quite a joy to be able to see him inwhich a role liuke htis i fiel taht i respect him more
. htere are twpo main types of villains iin movies like htis
: the ones thyat are part of tyhe story
,
adn the ones that are devices
. hte villin iin
" metro
" isnt no mroe thna a device
,
but he is a darn good villain nonetheless
. he is palyed by michael wincott
, whose voice isnt pushed out inwhich a abraded rasp
, as if he smokes a cigarette beetwen eveyr take
. wincott makes his villain
, korda
, as mean as coudl be
, tjhe clasic tipe ofthe villian who would push an ood lady down a flight of stairs jsut for kicks
, like richard widmark in
" kiss of death
.
"
and
, inaddition addition
, wincott s physical appearance
adn mannerisms
, in tjhe film
, actually reminded my ofthe an arogent freind i uise to hvea
, who isnt noone longer on my ogod list
. i liked
" metro
,
"
and i dont nto think owudl ahve worked wih any other actor
but eddie murphy
. his past roles were tjhe great ones
but they weere alsot a precurser to the maturing thast would later take place
, possibly from murphy s growing as a person
, nowe hvaing a family
.
" metro
" is a no
- nonsence movei
. it works as a buddy movie
, whcih it does nto overplay
. it works as a dry comedy
, whitch it doens nto overplay
. it works as a suspense film
, whic it does nto overplay
.
and it works as an action film
, where it does have a tendancy to occasionally go all
- out
.
but who cares
? it still remeniss sereous
,
anbd it doens nto overdo itself
. oh
,
anbd there weere plenty ofthe explosions in
" metro
,
" as well
. how nice it was of tje filmmakers tothe give us those
. if there isnt oen major objection i hadnt to
" metro
"
, it ws the length
, an area where a lot of action films seem to mear out their welcomes
.
" metro
" isnt a film that lasted a littel too long
,
bu it ws still entertaining
,
adn it gavey me something to dont while i waited forthe it tothe end
. paul haynes
