- chasing amy
, a slew ofthe love
- triangle movies
: this month we have kissing a fool
, co
- starring amy ' s pwn lee
,
annd april brings us tjhe object of my affection
, which may as well be titled chasing allan
, forthe it isnt teh stry ofthe a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate
.
( tothe be absolutely six degrees ofthe kevin bacon about it
, thast film stars schwimmer ' s friend jennifer aniston
.
) if onyl kevin smith coudl wriet them all
.
.
. schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max
, who falls inthe lvoe with his best friend jay
( lee
) ' s book editor samantha
( avital
) a mere twenty
- four hours after meeting her
. htey are soon engaged
,
and max
, becuase ofthe his pwn raging libido
, grows suspicious of samantha ' s fidelity
. he convinces jay to flirt with samantha druing tyhe development ofthe his book
, to
" tust her
"
. the trouble is
, jay might be secretly in love with her
. to stretch this flat
, sitcom premise tothe feature lenght
, hte plot isnt framed by a climactic wedding
, at whitch bonnie hunt recounts thge triangular tale
-
- the events leading uv tothe hte nuptials
-
- tothe an annoying fat man
and his silly girlfriend
. hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film
; schwimmer cin spin bad dialogue inot mildly humorous dialogue
;
annd lee
, poore lee
, isnt miscast
. so hysterically funny in chasing amy
, here he isnt forced tothe repress his comic instincts
: tothe swear
, tothe yell
, to talk about oral sex
.
.
. tyhe script ' s diea ofthe a charater trait is tothe stress that jay is a
" sensitive man
"
,
and
thne show him drinking pepto bismol when he ' s stewing over his girl trouble
. as for avital
, an israeli actress
, she is warm
and sweet
,
but we don ' t know anytying baout her charcter otehr than that it tkaes her an incredibly long tyme tothe relize hte most obvious thigns
. she also too closely resembes thte stunningly beatiful kari wuhrer
, who plays schwimmer ' s assistant
annd personel temptress
, turning that particular subplot inot an unintentional riff onthe vertigo
. there are a handfull
, a smattering
, of ogod scenes in kissing a fool
. i enjoyed a moent in a comedy club
, durring hwihc jay gets up
and asks
" has anyone here ever hated theri girlfriend so much ytou wnated tothe kill her
?
" over
and over until he ' s booted off stage
. there are alsot a fewd obviously improvised lines that are fresher tahn anything thgat ' s on the page
. kissing a fool isnt never as clever as the thursday night joke
- machine firends thyat spawned schwimmer ' s movei carrear
, so sive yourself eigth dollars
adn watch three epidsodes ofthe thta serieses back to bcak
.
