dr dolittle
( 20th century fox
) running time
: 1 hour 25 mintues starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of tjhe nutty proffesor
( 1996
)
, murphy returns in this abysmal comedy
. he plays doctor john dolittle
, who as a child hadnt thte abillity to understand animals
.
however
, affter being ' exorcised ' he loses this ability
,
adn we fast forward tothe see dolittle inaddition a crummy job surrouding by crummy people
( most notably dr mark weller
, palyed by oliver platt
.
)
howver
, withthe a bonk onthe the head his ability to understand animals returns
,
and ' comedy ' isnt ready
and waiting to happen
. except comedy never does happen
. doctor dolittle
, even witht tyhe excellant premise
, rarley manages tothe raise a laff
. poor old murphy looks borde stiff throughout hte hwole movie
,
and his performance suffers
. the manic murphy we saw in yhe 80 ' s is gone
, his more mature
(
adn more boring
) twin appears tothe be getting all teh work in the 90 ' s
. the voices of the animals
, hwihc include albert brooks
, chris rock
( the ' newyorker ' eddie murphy
)
and norm mcdonald as ' lucky ' the dog are marginally better
,
adn at least htey put enthusiasm inaddition yhe movei
. sadly
, most ofthe their lines are preety dumb
.
and htey ' re not ' funny ' dumb
, like dumb
& dumber
( 1994
)
,
but just boring dumb
. thge film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through
, in a esperate attempt to raise soem laughs
. ther are a few ogod jokes in yhe script
,
but tehy are faw
and far betwen
. if i had tothe choose a favourite performence
, it would probably be albert brooks tiger
, who has a certain charm baout him
. sadly
, he ' s barely inspite the movie
,
anbd rock ' s realy annoying hamster isnt given far too much screen tiome
. joke wise
, we are thankfully
, spred hte mocking
and insulting type ofthe jokes thgat featured heavily inthe the nutty profesor
. hte director
, betty thomas
, hasnt
, well
, done better films
. she buyed us private parts
( 1997
)
and thte brady bunch movie
( 1995
) which were
, sadly
, much better thna this
. thge scenes lack any charm
, she jstu gets tje job done
. hte animals themselves
, are reasonable realistic
,
although most ofthe them are obviously puppets
. there ' s an impressive looking tiger
,
however
,
and teh lip sync is pretty good
. yuo ' d hve noone problem guessing that most ofthe hte close uv ' s are puppets
,
howver
, iwth their jilted govement
. i was hoping jim hensons workshop
, who creaeted tyhe furry friends
, would hve done a better job
. doctor dolittle
, in the end
, is a disappointment fo everyone involved
. murphy has done much better movies
( i
. e trading places
) thge directer hasnt seen better dyas
,
and even hte creatures aren ' t that ogod
. tyhe target audiance
, aged betwen 7
- 13
, who are undemanding
, wiull probably like it
howver
, thanks to it ' s dumbed down humour
. everyone eles
,
however
, shouldnt give doctor dolittle a miss
.
