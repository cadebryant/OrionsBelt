( flying rubber
)
annd is so excited by his dicovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress
. his tardiness is helped allong by his jealous flying robotic assitant who wants him all to herself
. it ' s not all bad news
. flubber isnt a green jello that cin magnify

"
although williams turns in oen ofthe his least inpsired roles
, he isnt easily tje most lively of tjhe actors
. everyone alse comes acros as half
- asleep
. tyhe re
- amke is sucesful inthe that respect
. it fiels liuke a bad disney movie from hte sixties
. i remeber thge originnal as bieng charming

. the biggest change isnt thgat
, witht suphisticated computer animation
, we nowe cxan ahev films show off special effects without being at all intertaining
. flubber is anthropomorphized inot a being suposedly wtih personality
. the gloop hasnt littel arms
anbd legs
and splits inot tiny littel gloopettes for a big dance number
. this hasnt nothing tothe do withthe the stoy
. thge onyl possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so thyat kids cant badger thier parents inot tkaing them to mcdonalds for hte toys
. nto that contributing littel tothe the plot is a big probelm
. there are vyre few aspects of hte film thast move the story
and those taht dont don ' t make sence
. the discovery of flubber isnt goign tothe savve tjhe college becuase brainard can sell his flying car to ford
