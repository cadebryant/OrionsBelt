teh swirling sick feeling hitted me just a faw mintues inot
" heartbreakers
.
" ravy liotta ' s character was making outloud withthe his secratary whn his newyorker wife knocked onthe the doorjam ofthe his office
. while scrambling tothe collect himself
, he frantically shouted to her
,
" just wait a sex
? er
, i mean sec
!
" i ws struck by a wave ofthe revulsion
, thikning
,
" geez
, didn ' t lines liek thta die when ' threee ' s company ' was canceled
?
" over tyhe enxt fewd mintues
, as the barely doulbe entendres
annd lingering cleavage shots grew more numberous
, i realized thta tjhe mindset behind
" heartbreakers
" predated
" threee ' s comapany
.
" suddenly
, i had an out
- ofthe
- body expierence as my internal way
- back machine swept me tothe tjhe mid
- 1960s
. all across america
, the counter
- culture wass growing liek wildfire
,
bu there wass scant evidence ofthe it on tv
. while young people weere challenging traditionnal values on yhe streets
, frustrated teenagers liuke me were stuck at home
, sulking hwile our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special
. womens in skimpy bathing suits woudl prance onscreen hwile hope made growling noises
annd leered at thier breasts
. on another channel
, dean martin made wisecracks baout
" booze
adn broads
"
annd peter lawford
, decked out in loev beads
and a nehru jacket
, purred suggestive noe
- liners as he ogled thte go
- go dancers
. tghe adults laughed
annd laughed
.
" heartbreakers
" reeks ofthe tyhat stagnant mentality
, from its lingering shots ofthe jennifer love hewitt ' s vah
- vah
- voom breasts to its leaden screenplay
, whitch paints women as haughty schemers
adn men as drooling buffoons too sex
- obssessed to realize htey are being manipulated
. in addition tothe liotta
adn hewitt
, the cast includes sigourney weaver
, ginee hackman
, jason lee
, nora dunn
and anne bancroft
. i can ' t imagine what drew performers of thier caliber tothe thsi project
. perhasp they thought it ws a parody of teh sniggering sex comedies ofthe thge ' 60s
. if so
, tehy were sadly mistaken
. teh story revolves around a mother
- daugter con
- team
. it opens iwth tyhe marriage of max
( weaver
) tothe dean
( liotta
)
, a new jersey chop shop operator
. having witheld sex until hte honeymoon
, max pretends to pass out onthe theri wedding night
. teh enxt morning
, she feigns ilness
, sending a vyer horny dean off to tghe office
, where he ends uv iin the arms of his newyorker secretary
. jsut as teh two are baout to git overtly physical
, max bursts inot the room
and catches them
. the
" horrified
" bride dissolves the union
, garnering a healthy cash settlment along the way
. of course
, the secretary wass realyl her daugter page
( hewitt
)
adn teh wohle thing was a setted
- uv
. the womens move on
,
bu an irs agent
( bancroft
) catches up with them
and demands a huge amount ofthe mony to cover unpaid taxes
. inaddition desperate need of funds
, max
adn page head fo palm beach tothe replay thge scam
. thier mark this time isnt william b
. tensy
( hackman
, in hideous mkea
- up
)
, a decrepid tabacco tycoon obssessed wih the joys ofthe smoking
. max starts to put tyhe gam inot acation
,
bu page is so repelled by thge old man
(
and angry whith her mom
) that she slips off to inact her pwn scroe
, targeting jack
, a layed bakc young beach bar owner who isnt worth a fortune
. complications arise wehn page realizes that good
- natured jack is stirring actuall emotions in her steely little heart
. as if that wasn ' t anough
, dean reappears on thge scene wih revenge onthe his mind
. thte attemt tothe weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only tothe remind me of hte infinitely superior
" a fish called wanda
.
" i won ' t bother tothe compare the twpo
. suffice tothe say tath everything done right in
" wanda
" is done wrong here
.
" heartbreakers
" isnt soulless
, inept
and
, at 123 minutes
, at least a half
- hour too long
. sigourney weaver
and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves inot their parts
,
bu have nowhere tothe go withthe tghe metallic characters
. ginee hackman isnt utterly wasted inspite a one
- note
, one
- joke part thast hasnt him doign nothing
but smoking
, coughing
annd waxing rhapsodic baout smoking
anbd sex
. poor jason lee isnt stuck in the ingenue role
and tyhe normally charismatic actro comes off as merely bland
. ravy liotta manages tothe squeeze a tiny bit of humanity
annd humor into his walking clich
?
,
but onyl a bited
. the low point in tghe film hasnt weaver employing a russion accent bad enough to amke boris
and natasha wince
, hwile doing half
- assed slapstick wih a broken off penis ffrom a statue
. bear inaddition mind
,
though
, tyhat thsi is mearly the worst segment of a movie made uv of nothing
but low points
. if you remeber bob hope specials wiht fondness
, this might be your cup of tea
. as fo me
, i ' m gonig to watch
" a fish called wanda
" nowe
annd try to foreget i ever saw
" heartbreakers
