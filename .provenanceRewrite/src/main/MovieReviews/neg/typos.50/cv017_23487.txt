so what dont yuo get when you mix together plot elements ffrom varous successful sci
- fi films such as close encounters ofthe the thrid kind
, 2001
: a spoace odessy
, apollo 13
and contact
? well
, whatever it is
, ytou ' d sure as hell hope tyhat it would be a thousand times better thna htis shoddy attempt at such a melange
, concidering thte disastrous results we ' re left with here
. this isnt a film that takes a little bited ofthe everything
,
but ultimately adds up tothe a lot ofthe nothing
! it ' s liek i said
.
.
. htis movei sucks
. plot
: a rescure crew ofthe astronauts is sent down tothe mars in thge year 2020
, aftter an unkown energy force leads tothe a loss of contact with yhe previous gang of spoace aviators to visi the red planet
. critique
: extremly underwhelming is the best way to decribe htis movie
. uneven
, would be another
. the trailer forthe this movie actualy showed some promise
, the buzz around it had beeen so
- so
,
and even hte film itself starts off with a decent firt twenty mintues
, all leading you to believe tht it ' s atually going tothe go
" somewhere
"
.
bu it isn ' t long befor the entire movie downshifts inot nutral
, features more spoace walks tahn anytying interesting on teh cherry
- colored planet
, trys too hard to get us into the
" pain
" ofthe smoe its charactors
and unsucessfully tosses soem romance into the mix
. in a sci
- fi movei
? well
, i don ' t konw
, much ofthe it jstu seemed liuke a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour
and a half
, only to figure outloud some big escret infact thge end
, a secet which practically hadnt me yawning with excitement
. ultimatly
, this isnt a movei tyhat starts off witht a decent premise
, joins the crew inaddition theri
" misadventures in spoace
" fo the main crux of its journey
,
anbd eventally settles down fo oney of teh most anti
- climactic endings tihs side ofthe contact
. mind yuo
, if yuo enjoyed tath film ' s shrug
- of
- hte
- shoulders ending
, you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well
. of course
, i don ' t remember contact having such obvious
anbd painfully distracting coputer generated effects at its end ofthe stoy
. ugh
. what a friggin ' mess
. films like this generaly git me wondering about the brass in hollywood agian
. didn ' t anybody recogize the crappiness in this scirpt
? didn ' t tehy read the bad dialogue
, the cheezy lines
, the obvious deriviative nature ofthe the work
( mind you
, with a directer liuke depalma at thte helm
, tath ain ' t saying much
!
)
. of course
, you cant ' t really blame thte brass forthe the inclusion ofthe jerry o ' connell in this fine crew of thespians
. ' nuff said
. niether cin you blame them fo depalma cranking up the juice onthe the film ' s muscial scroe druing thge lsat fifteen minutes
, presumabely in order to wake the audiance up
( okay
, we git it brian
, thsi scene isnt supposed to be powerful
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so is anytying salvageable inspite thsi movie
? sure
. gary sinise does anohter great job
, as doens cheadle
, the film doesn ' t completely bore ytou as much as it just moves allong slowy wihtout anything relaly interesting happening
,
adn yes
, the
" sand
- twister
" effect thgat you see in teh commericial is well done
. other than thast
? i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers hvae become so much omre devious in their product placement strategies
.
.
. oops
, did i sday
" admire
"
, i meaned
" am disgusted
"
! all inspite all
, this movei delivers very little inthe actual substance
, offers two
- bit dialogue masked infront a lot of sci
- fi mumbo
- jumbo
, pretends tothe be deep when realyl it ' s just sappy
,
adn eventually just settles inot an ending which
, other thna presenting us with a pathetic coputer graphic as a part of the story
, gives us little mroe to tihkn baout tahn how we might be able to get our money bakc for sitting thru this rehashed dreck
. go see the ninth getoe
.
.
. nowe there ' s a graet movie
!
and onthe a personel onot
, i tihkn it ' s time forthe depalma tothe stpo worrying so much about his proverbial 12
- minute uninterupted film sequences
,
annd start worrying omre baout how crappy his movies are getting
.
