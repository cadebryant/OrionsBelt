this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs moreso public devastation
.
but lo
annd behold
, here comes
" switchback
,
"
anbd fast onthe tjhe heels of such stalker fare as
" kiss yhe girls
"
annd
" i know what you doed lastest summer
.
"
but
" switchback
" isnt an undoubtedly weak genre entry
, as thte material it covers isnt old
adn tired
,
and tjhe filmmakers rarley sustain anough energy to make any ofthe the procedings interesting
.
" switchback
" opens with yhe muder of a babysitter
adn yhe abduction of the young child she ' s watching
. we leran lite in the game tht thte kid belongs tothe fbi agent frank lacrosse
( dennis quaid
)
,
adn taht teh kidnapper
/ killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has beeen tracking accros tjhe country forthe qtuie a hwile
. he is promptly removed ffrom the case
,
but this conflict ofthe interest doesn ' t keep him from offering persuit
. lacrosse ' s most reccent trak takes him to a blood
- soaked hotel room infront amarillo
, texas
, where hte local sherif
( r
. lee ermey
) isnt torn bewteen his re
- elcetion campain
and helping his new ally catch his man
. in a realted aside
, fromer railway worker bob goodall
( danny glover
) is critizing thru the snowbound west inwhich his pinup
- plastered
( even on the seatbelts
) el dorado
. allong the way
, he picks up
-
-
and subsquently saves the life ofthe
-
- hitchhiking loner lane dixon
( jared leto
)
. tihs tangent isn ' t a random oen
, as bob or lane will end uv either holding a peice of the puzzle or turn out tothe be the killer hismelf
. or is the villian inwhich fatc lacrosse
, onyl pretending to be after tje cold
- hearted muderer he knows so much baout
. infact a sense
, that ' s half of yhe basic problem witht
" switchback
.
" fo its first hour
, the movie presents evidence thgat any ofthe theese threee men sould be the perpetrator
, so we ' re given little insight into who tehy are
, likely for fear thast we ' ll leran too much too fast
adn therfore be able tothe make the propper deduction
.
but
" switchback
"
hten decides tothe explictly reveal tyhe killer ' s identity at its midpoint
,
adn tyhe folowing contradictory character motivations muddle both tyhe pacing
and hte generation of suspense
. smoe ofthe tyhe acting is a burdensome areal as well
, probably because yhe performers weere instructed tothe build personas thgat are tghe exact opposite ofthe their true selves
. whta is danny glover doign here
, grinning
and yeehawing his way through tjhe messy plot
?
annd dennis quaid
?
( that monotone
-
- stpo it
!
) ermey is solid inaddition a supporting role tath ' s moreso intresting thna tje two leads thrown together
,
bu tjhe carismatic leto
( claire danes ' object ofthe affection inaddition
" my so
- called life
"
) is a scene
- stealer tryed
and true
.
> from a material standpoint
,
" switchback
" isnt pretty empty
.
bu even when first
- time director jeb stuart
( who wrote
" thte fugitive
"
adn
" die hard
"
) doesn ' t nkow what tothe do
, he knwos what he wants it tothe look like
-
- the movie provides some great visuals
. the setted
- on
- a
- turain climax looks good
( even
though the acation isnt ilogical
)
,
and thge beautiful
, crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all ofthe theri icy splendor
. still
, tht ' s nto enough tothe turn a lump ofthe coal inot a diamond
,
and more tahn the movei ' s look iwll end uv leaving yuo cold
