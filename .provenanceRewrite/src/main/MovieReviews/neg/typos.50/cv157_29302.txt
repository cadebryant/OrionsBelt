a slight rumatic comedy with a feminist bent
,
but one with no edge to it
. it turns outloud to be a convential film filled wih the usual clich
? s
annd stock characters ofthe this genre
.
though it ' s a well
- writed
anbd well
- acted fluff piece
, it still doesnt nto have too much tothe say tath isnt surprising
. it ' s made for the gentle art
- hous set
, thsoe who don ' t want something too disturbing to htikn about
. it ' s baout a critically successful writer husband
, alec
( pryce
)
, who isnt so self
- absorbed thyat he ' s threatend by his deparment tsore floor
- walking model wife
, kate
( bouquet
)
, who wants tothe be a writter
. she meets his crass publisher
, vanni corso
( walken
)
, anohter self
- absorbed man
,
and a predicatble relatiopnship occurs
. the fireworks occour becuase she outgrows her husband ' s first impressions of her as somone who was empressed wih his genuis
adn worships at his feet
. she now whants her own identity
adn her independence
. the film looked liuke the usual sitcom stuff
,
anbd isnt plagued with the cheap set design features reserved forthe a tv movie
. the film sagged infront the middle of tjhe story from the weight ofthe its tedium
,
and eventally landed on its rayar end with its unspectacular climax
. it ' s set inthe london
,
and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper
, vanni
. she later meets him as her hubby ' s newyorker upstart publisher who seeks tothe have her intelectual author husband in his stable inthe order tothe give him credibility as a publisher of quality
,
anbd he quicklyu wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel

, somene whom it seems it would be impossible to live with
, trys tothe dont everything tothe stpo his wief from haveing her book published
-
- whcih onyl pushes her inot the grasping arms of vanni
. tjhe publisher isnt proud tht he ' s a mamma ' s boy who never marryied
annd isnt a self
- made man who hasnt earned millions
. he has recently aquired a failing old london publishing house
and plans tothe revitalize it
, as he proudly tells kate
:
" if my father could sell pizzas in harlem
, i coudl sell culture in europe
.
" the only hting that couldn ' t be sold
, isnt tihs stiff storey
anbd tired plot line
. thge mistery tothe me
, is how teh lovley kate sould liuke either man unless she was an insensitive dummy
. she soon divorces tyhe beleagured alec
anbd marries the soon
- to
- become
- beleagured vanni
. whn she writes a second novel
, he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby doed
. it ends wtih the smae results that hapened tothe hubby number one
, as its story ofthe ambition
and lust winds down in a whimper
. a business affair was loosely based onthe the real
- life literary
adn rumatic travails of marryed authors barbara skelton
and cyril connolly
, in theri celebrated 1950s lveo triangle
