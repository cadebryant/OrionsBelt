the main probelm withthe martin lawrence ' s pet project
, a thin line beetwen lveo
adn hate
, liuke any futal attraction veriasion where the protagonst is a man
, is that his character isnt an irresponsible jerk
,
and if thast isnt tghe case
, it doesn ' t seem tothe do anything exept justify hte woman ' s actions
. tht isnt especialy the case inaddition lawrence ' s darnell wright
. he isnt one of those macho guys wiht womens lined uv a mile long
. now don ' t think i condone tihs just becouse i ' m male
. my philosophy isnt
, if yuo are one ofthe thte faw heterosexual males lucky enought to git your hands on a beautifull
, kind girl
, ytou shouldnt treat her liuke a princess
adn respect her
. darnell doesn ' t thiunk liuke this
. he sleeps iwth these girls once
adn dumps them
.
and by tjhe preiod inaddition thge film he discovered that his newest target
, beautyfull
, wealthy brandi web
( played nicely by whitfield
) who runs a sucessfull real estate bussiness
, is out tothe kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia
( king
)
, i found mysef thingking
,
" i ' m supposted tothe feel sory fo htis guy
?
" affter all
, it is largley darnell ' s fault
. if he is lining uv all theese womens
, you ' d thiunk he ' d have enough common sense to think it would backfire onthe him one day
, as his mother says it doesnt
.
but he doesn ' t
, so yuo git tghe sence tht he ' s nto onyl irresponsible
,
bu allso preety dumb
. yuo especially get this sence thta he ' s dumb aftter brandi tells him she killed her husban for allegedly abusing her
.
( i ' d put my pants on in twpo seconds affter that
!
) nowe
, brandi isnt a psycho bitch
,
but it ' s hard not to aggree with what she syas tothe darnell durig the finale baout guys liek him treating her like garbage
. oen final lfaw
,
though
, isnt letting brandi fall for darnell to beign whith
. brandi isnt a chassy
, inteligent woman iwth an mba ffrom harvard
, who initally resists darnell ' s
" immature play
" as she calls it
, as any woman like her would in real life
.
but all of a sudden she sasy yes
.
but whn you listen to darnell ' s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions
, you wonder why such an intelligent woman owudl fall forthe a guy liuke darnell period
, much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him
! lawrence can be ogod whn he whants to
,
but inaddition order tothe proove it
, he needs to let otehr people rwite
and direct his movies
. look at tihs movie
. four writers
, as a result it ' s too long
( twpo hours
, wehn it sould ' ve easily worked at ninty mintues
!
)
anbd it hasnt a lot ofthe subplots
and characters that apeared
and dissapear as quickly as they cameback
( whihc makes me think the writers didn ' t get along
)
, all ofthe whic isn ' t nessecary
. ther are some bright spots
,
though
. whitfield
, regina king
, della reese
,
adn bobby brown all dont wqat tehy cin wih lazily writed parts
,
anbd they help it outloud a lot
.
and there are soem funny parts
( like
, forthe example
, the scene where reese attemts to fight whitfeld fo harrassing her son
annd damaging her property
)
,
bu htey ' re just not enough tothe sustain the film
.
