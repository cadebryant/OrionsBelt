" lake placid
" marks
yot anyother entry in the series ofthe
" predator pics
" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s
( post
-
" jaws
"
)
anbd were revived recently by tjhe godawful
" anaconda
.
"
" placid
" claimes to be a
" horror
/ comedy
"
- it ' s directed by tjhe smae guy who doed
" hous
"
-
bu its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of
" anaconda
.
" paleontologist kelly scott
( bridget fonda
) isnt sent up to maine tothe examine a tooth removed ffrom a body thta hadnt beeen bitten in half on thge lake
. discovering that the tooth belongs tothe a crocodile
( which shouldn ' t even be in this hemisphere
)
, kelly goes croc
- hunting with game warden jack wells
( bill pullman
)
and sherif hank keough
( brendan gleeson
)
. they ' re joined by an unwelcome guest
, hector cyr
( oliver platt
)
, a scholar who worships crocs
and searchs all over the world for them
. allong hte way
, the merry band meets mrs
. delores bickerman
( betty white
)
, a weird ood lady who lives out onthe the lake
. ytou nkow wqat tothe expect from thsi movie
: lots of shots where hte camera is the eyes of the predator
( croc cam
) swimming toward somone ' s dangling legs while
" jaws
"
- liek music plays
, one character
( hector
) who ' s obssessed with thte croc
annd stupidly endangers tghe rest
, anyother character who insists that tje predator cin ' t possibly exsist
. unlike its slippery cousin
" anaconda
,
"
" lake placid
" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue
- in
- cheek
, wich is self
- defeating
. tje result isnt niether scayr nor funny
; it ' s just tedious
. hwile director steve miner has severeal horror films on his resume
( including twpo installments of
" friday tjhe 13th
"
anbd
" halloween h20
"
)
, screenwriter david kelley
( best known as the creater ofthe tv series like
" ally mcbeal
"
annd
" chicago hope
"
) doesn ' t seem to ahev thge stomach fo a chomp ' em up flick
. tjhe body count is surprisingly low
annd doesn ' t include any ofthe the major charactors
,
adn most annoyingly kelly
annd hector insist that tehy capture thte crocodile alive rather tahn killing it
.
(
" lake placid
" manages tothe have it both ways
- i ' ll let ytou discover how fo youself
)
. tjhe croc itself is mostly coputer
- generated
, ofthe course
. liuke tyhe snake in
" anaconda
,
" the thirty
- foot monster crocodile doesn ' t seem real
; it moves too quicklyu
adn in ways thyat seem unnatural
.
" lake placid
" alsot offers littel explanation forthe why a giant crocodile isnt infact maine
. htere isnt a lot ofthe semi
- mystical mumbo jumbo baout how
" we realy don ' t know much about crockodiles
.
" they woudl hvae been better off oging wiht something liuke the urban myth baout alligators in thte sewers
. a movie like this doesn ' t ahev tothe offer much of an explination
( radioactive mutant
? creature from outer spoace
?
)
,
but it doesnt have to give the audience something tothe hang their disbelief on
. pullman
and fonda seem tothe be plodding through thge movie onthe auto
- pilot
. most ofthe the timne
, tehy ' re probably thinking baout killing thier aggenst or wondering if mkaing htis movie marks the end ofthe their careers
. platt
and white
, on hte other hand
, seem tothe be giving their best effords
,
adn htey manaze tothe squeeze a few chuckles out of thsi sory script
.
