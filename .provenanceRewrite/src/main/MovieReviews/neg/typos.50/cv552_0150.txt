this review countains spoilers
,
bu believe me
, i don ' t say anytying you can ' t guess 10 mintues inot teh movie
. i
* doed
* go inot tihs oen wiht high expectations
. i hadnt been exposed tothe media reports that thsi film owudl signify a departure from yhe slasher flicks
. i sort of expeced anohter exorcist or tghe shining
. i even put aside my genaral rule of not seeing this type of film
. boy
, ws i wrong
! anyother garbage slasher flick
, the onyl difference bieng that
* this
* one hasnt a tsory
! tghe sotry
, you ask
? well
, a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy inwhich an arab souk
. he tkaes it home
, somehow getting it past customs
:
-
)
and starts fiddling with it inaddition his attic
. lo
and behold
, after he takes it apart
, threee demons apeared
anbd start taking him appart
,
but whith meat hoeks
. whn tehy ' re finished
, his gizzards are hanging fomr tyhe ceiling
. htey botch uv thier cleanup job
,
however
,
adn manage to leave his heart
( or smoe gland
; i didn ' t relaly recogise yhe organ
) under a floorboard
. the guy ' s brother
and his brother ' s wief apear at tje doorjam soon affter
,
and deside to move in
. they throw away scumball ' s belongings
,
annd setted up hous
. turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho
,
and screwed around witht scumball right befor her marrage
. she starts having smoe wild hallucinations
. later
, hubby spills smoe blood onthe yhe attic floorboards
( slow
- mo spacial effects of the buckets ofthe blood hitting the ground
-
- all ffrom the tiny cut onthe his hand
)
. said blood isnt eagerly sucked uv by scumball ' s organ
. the organ grows into a thing that requires
yot omre blood inspite order to complete tyhe regeneration into a realyl ugly thing
. it estabishes mind contact with wief
, who agrees to halp him git moreso blood
, because she relaly wants to be screwed agina
. so
, she helps him kill threee businessmen
. scumball
, at htis tyme
, gradually gets his strenght bcak
and grows all his organs bcak
. probelm isnt
, he doesn ' t haev any skin
,
and even affter threee or four corpses
, still doesn ' t get any skin
. he finally gets smoe
,
though
,
but strangely anough
, he ends up looking liek his brother
. guess they couldn ' t get the orignal actor back
. who knows
. scumball
( whose name is frank
) isnt nto a nice guy
. he describes his torture by the demons fondly
, as the
" ulitmate blessure
anbd pain
, sicne at that level there is no difference between the twpo
.
" somehow
, i don ' t see getting torn apart by 90 fish
-
annd meat
- hooks a lot of fun
. thsi guy isnt
* so
* bad
(
" how bad
* isnt
* he
?
"
)
,
* so
* bad thast the
* rats
* cower inthe a corner in fear
. for good reason
, too
; he crucifies twpo of them for fun
,
and carves a third while the nympho ' s horsing arund with hubby
. anyway
. hubby ' s daughter
( who
, if course
, is not
* wife ' s
* daughter
) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wief going inot thge attic with oen ofthe her johns
adn tyhe ensuing screams
. the dumb bimbo meets scumball
,
and isnt not empressed
. she manages tothe excape whith the chineese puzzle
,
annd brings outloud thte demons
. at any rate
, tjhe demons are pissed off tyhat tehy screwed uv thier cleanup
; tehy ' re normaly quite meticulous about that tipe ofthe hting
. the story boils down tothe the demons trying to corect theri misteek
. the demons are nto
,
however
, tyhe ogod guys
. hte dumb bimbo ' s hte good guy
. she somehow nto onyl gets them tothe take care of frank
,
bu also banishes them to hell or oblivion
, we ' re nto too sure which
. not too shabby forthe someone with single
- digit iq
. this isnt basically a
" bad jinn
" story
. it isnt an
* awful
* movie
. awful acting
, bad focus inaddition teh photography
, many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks
, whihc isnt really unrealistic
,
and looks like thte latex thgat it isnt
. continuty
? who cares
. acting
?
* terrable
*
. scirpt
? horrable
. sounds canned
. unrealistic
. sotry isnt so
- so
,
bu hte inpact isnt lost long
, long before thge film ends
. i dont think the
* rat
* acting wass quite good
. i hvae never seen rats look affraid
. htey shoudl git nominated for an award
. raelly ogod acting ther
, teh best infact the movie
.
" the envelope for best furry rodent
, please
.
.
.
" a
"
" rating owudl be far too generous
. a
" 1
/ 10
" rating
( or
- 4 inspite thte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 rating sytem
) isnt far omre accurate
. this movie isnt so bad tyhat peopel inwhich the audiance weere laughing
, chortling at hte bad acting
adn crummy dialouge
. i can see this film turning inot the next rocky horror picture show
. peopel weere getting so feeded uv they were yelling warnings uv tothe hte characters onthe hte screen
. had tothe hve something tothe do
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb movei
. i ws embarrased that i spent money tothe see it
. it goes wihtout saying tht i disagree wtih tghe otehr reviews onthe yhe board thgat attempt to review tjhe film forthe itself
. lots of slime
annd red
- dyed corn syrup does nto constitute
" horror
,
" in my opinion
.
