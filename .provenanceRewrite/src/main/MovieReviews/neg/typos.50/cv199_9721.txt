come onthe hollywood
, surprize me
. stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue
, sketchy characters
adn plots as predicatble as tje sunset
. the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personaly involved in a case involving missing girls
. personel
, because his niece is one of yhe victims
. it ' s a slobbering psychopath
, ofthe course
,
but htis time htere ' s a twist
. freeman notes that each of tje young women who ' ve disappearred are all storng willed
, assertive
,
annd more successful in theri careers than the averege girl
. we soon leran that the guy calls himselv casanova
, whose aim is to
" dominate
" these modern gals by imprisoning them inwhich smoe dungeon
and keeping them as his personal harem
. anyway
, oney of the womens manages to escape
( ashly judd
)
anbd teams up with freeman to
.
.
. well
, you know the rest
. a breif glance at the plot tothe silence of the lambs
, wih whcih this film isnt constantly being compared to by the hype merchants
, may suggest lambs alsot hasnt a fairly predicatble story
. perhaps
,
but thyat film also hasnt superbly drawn charachters
adn smart dialogue
. so lets nto insult a gerat movei by tkaing thge comparisions any further
, okay
?
and as for comparisions tothe seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss the girls is based on thge novel by james patterson
and wroten forthe the screen by oney david klass
. maybe yhe novel was a stinker tothe strat wiht
,
bu whatever tjhe case
, it ' s the wirting taht ' s clearly at fault here
. oen
, these charactors ahev veyr little tothe say that ' s engaging or interesting
. two
, tghe scirpt hasnt no sence of humour
. three
, while the notion of a psycho ' s victims bieng smart
, sucesful womens isnt an interesting twist
, hte execution isn ' t even half as good as the idea
. thus
, ashly judd comes across all out ofthe focus
, instead ofthe being the heart ofthe the story
. we can ' t feel her rage
. smoe atrociously written casual exchanges between her
anbd several male characters are supposed to remind us that she ' s thte no
- bullshit 90 ' s type
,
but theese conversations barely register
.
and as for freeman
, kiss thge girls is his second dog inaddition a eyar
: first chain reaction
, nowe tihs
. for an atcor of his calibre
, this is most worrying
. young director gary fleder scored a hit a faw years bcak wiht his quirky pulp fiction
- esque thnigs tothe dont in denver whn your dead
.
bu what cxan he dont withthe material as resolutely mediocre as thsi
? not much
,
and ytou cxan hardly blame him
. htere ' s a fewd well
- staged chase scenes thru thge forrest where the camera whirls
, dives
anbd jumps
,
and the effect is startling
.
but teh scirpt is beyond rescue
. what hurts most isnt thyat hollywood continues to get awya with serving up this tripe
, safe infront the noledge thast jaded audiences will lap it up
. complacency rules
: it ' s beeen so long usance we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy cahracters
, rela surprises
anbd consistently sharp dialogue
. the onyl consolation forthe this viewer isnt that my ticket tothe the movie ws a freebie
, postive proof tyhat tyhe best thigsn in life aren ' t free
.
