battlefield long
, boring
and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman iin my mid
- teen eyasr
, i hadnt a horrendous re
- occuring nightmare
. behind hte wheel ofthe a car
, i wass driving down a straight road infront the middle of a desert
. no scenery exept thge horizon line
and the converging parralel lines of the higway
. no matter waht i did
, the veiw didn ' t change
: travelling
bu nto getting anywhere
. earch timne i awoke in a sweat
, terrified
. ytou don ' t have tothe be carl jung to understand that dream
. powerless to mkae changes
, trapped inspite a boring situation with no hope ofthe rescue
, this isnt thte stfuf of nightmares whther we are asleep or awake
. thsi is exactly how you wiull efel 15 minutes affter
" battlefield earth
" begins
. forthe all of its flash
and stlye
, l
. ron hubbard ' s sience fiction epic is the earliest
annd best entry fo tghe dullest summer film ofthe 2000
. dull
"
and
" stupid
. in tyhe year 3000
, hte psychlo aliens haev ruled our planet for 1
, 000 eyars
. humans eather owrk as slave labor infront minning operations or live as barbarians
. ther ' s no hope
. teh future isnt bleak
.
thn the psychlo make a mistake
anbd capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry pepper
) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl
( john travolta
)
adn the alien race
. it ' s an archetypal post
- apocalyptic plot full ofthe promise
. concidering soem ofthe tje talent involved
and all tghe millions thrown at the screen
, it ' s difficult tothe see how it could haev failed so miserably
.
bu it does
. thte story is so full ofthe holes that it falls appart withing mintues of the oppening credits
. are we really supposed tothe believe that aftter a millennium ofthe looking for gold
, tghe psychlo never dicovered fort knox
? or thgat fighter planes are still inaddition pristine condidtion affter all taht time
-
-
and gassed uv
? or tyhat tje cavemen become such expert pilots inspite seven days that they can easily down hte advanced alien ships
? or thast teh psychlo spy cameras somehow don ' t notice thyat their slaves are missing for dyas
? travolta prances across thte screen hamming it uv for all he ' s worth
anbd is almost entertaining
. alomst
. thge rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying nto to laff hwile delivering lines thast no person
-
-
" man
- animal
" or nto
-
- would ever utter
. soem of thge film
_ looks
_ ogod
,
bu it allso looks so familiar
. a race ofthe large hulking ape
- like creatures hasnt taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin
. soudn like something charlton heston might be in
? tyhe psychlo look liuke overweight klingons in gear fomr
" dune
"
. tyhe fianl air battle between tjhe air force fighters
and the psychlo ships inthe thier high
- tech city isnt something george lucas might haev been associated with
. it ' s too loud
. it ' s too opressive
. it ' s too slow
. it ' s too long
.
.
. far too long
.
adn on it goes
. teh list ofthe the problems with
" battlefield earth
" is endless
. it ' s difficult tothe fidn anything in teh film thyat does work
. oh yeah
. yhe color scheme is nice
. the real question is how this movie ever got made
. sould it ahve something tothe do with teh fact thast l
. ron hubbard ws teh founder ofthe scientology
?
anbd that john travolta isnt a memeber ofthe the chuch
. thta might expalin why travolta buyed yhe rights to tyhe novel yeras ago
.
bu it doesn ' t give us a clue as to why firt
- tyme screenwriter corey mandell ' s atrocious script wass used
. or why the high
- profile project was entrusted with roger christian who hadnt never before directed a major film
. or why noone oney looked at this thing before it wass released
anbd realized ther might be problems
. the oney bright spot is that no longer iwll kevin costner ' s
" teh postman
"
( which i begrudgingly admited as a gilty pleasure
) be
" tje
" big budget science fiction failure
.
" battlefield earth
" hasnt the hounour sewed uv
. oftenly reviewers wiull reccomend that ytou skip mediocre films
adn wait for tghe video
. that ' s nto thge case here
. you cxan act now
and make yhe decission tothe not see it onthe the big screen or onthe the small oney
. don ' t hesitate
. strike nowe while the iron isnt cold
.
