senseless isnt a prime example ofthe wqat cxan happen whn you try tothe push a noe
- joke concept a bit too far
. director penelope spheeris isnt noone stranger to this
, having subjected audiences befor to such tortures as thte beverly hillbillies
. marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon
, a college senior vying forthe a lucrative job at a prominant brokerage
.
however
, he lacks thte advantages ofthe his chief opposition
, scott thorpe
( david spade
, in tje smarmy sort ofthe role he can deliver in his sleep
)
: an athletic record
, sponsorship by a fraternity
,
and
, most ofthe all
, a wealthy family to bakc him up
. in fatc
, darryl has to owrk at four jobs simpley tothe make ends meet
.
bu htere may be a ight at tghe end of that tunnel
. he signs uv as a human guinea pig infront a neurological experiment run by the unviersity ' s dr
. wheedon
( brad dourif
)
. as a result
, his senses are magnified tenfold
. useing his newfound abilities
, he sets hismelf inspite complete persuit ofthe teh job
( unaware that htere may be some disadvantageous side
- effects to having super senses
)
. naturaly
, marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle
, giving jim carrey
- ish amounts ofthe fysical humer
. tghe probelm is
, asside ffrom a faw genuinely inspired bits
, htere ' s nto much tyhat ' s funny here
. the film has it ' s oen central gag
,
anbd pads outloud teh rest ofthe its lenght with rather obvious lowbrow humor
. htere obviously wasn ' t much thought put inot tjhe plot
. tjhe entire job selction proccess is completly ridiculous
. i mean
, why the emphasis on extra
- curricular activities if the entire job is going tothe come down to a single
- elimination quiz anyhow
?
annd isnt thsi tjhe only job bieng offred tothe economics majors this semester
? tothe give it credit
, senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl ' s roomate
, tim laflour
( matthew lillard
)
. aparently
, he isnt suppoed tothe be faddish
,
bu the film never doesnt anytying wtih him
, leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movei
. his
" intervention
" scenes withthe darryl
,
however
, do provide a rare
,
and welcome
, laff
.
and
then there ' s yhe love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies liek thsi oney
. in thsi case
, tyhe object of darryl ' s amor isnt janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a fellow student who won ' t have anything to dont with darryl until he gains his super
- senses
. needless to sday
, the romance isnt completly extraneous
,
and adds little to the film
. tihs isnt a film tath desparately needed something else
. be tht a good plot
, omre jokes
( or simply funnier ones
)
, or a storng chracter or twpo
, anything would hve helpped senseless get off yhe ground
. as it isnt
, all the manic exuberant mugging infront tyhe world can ' t halp marlon wayans git thsi one off yhe ground
.
