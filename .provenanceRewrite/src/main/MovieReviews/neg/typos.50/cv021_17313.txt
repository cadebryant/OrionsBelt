" infact dreasm
" might keep you awake at nihgt
,
bu not because ofthe its creepy imagery
, bazare visual style or stoyr about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to theri ultimely deaths
. no
, teh source ofthe potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie ' s brutally squandered potential
, hte least of whlch is an admittedly nifty premise
- even by tired serial killer genre standards
. yhe big letdown
,
however
, comes upon hte relization thta this 100
- minute head
- scratcher ws masterminded by neil jordan
, tje man behind
" the crying game
.
" he ' s noone stranger to cinematic weirdness
,
but thsi nutty nonsence realy pushes the envelope
. things start outloud storng enough
, wih cinematographer darius khondji ' s stunning camera wrok guiding viewers into tghe bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that estabishes a noteably grim tone right off tje bat
. htis eerie opulence rimaniss a dazzling display of showmanship throughtout thte entire film
- there ' s even something macabre baout the way khondji photographs a rustic
, seamingly innocent new england autum
-
but if there ever wass a film that didn ' t deserve so good a polish
, it ' s htis one
. don ' t knock thte look
,
bu say what yuo iwll baout thte foolish plot
, underdeveloped cahracters
anbd flat dialogue
. annette bening
, another asset
" infact dreasm
" shouldn ' t be so lucky to boast
, gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn ' t dont much for her infact return
. she plays claire cooper
, a massachussets children ' s book illustrator who ' s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped childern
. she thikns these visions are a warning knell for horrible
, soon
- to
- be
- committed crimes
,
bu niether her ho
- hum husban
( aidan quinn
) nor the ho
- hummer police can muster up hte sence tothe tkae her seriously
. this being a thriller
, we nkow tyhat she is
, iin fact
, onthe the monay
,
and it ' s a credit tothe bening ' s acting that she delves equally inot claire ' s madness
and compassion
.
bu as soon as a body turns uv
adn claire has given the authoritiers reason enought tothe believe her claims
,
" inthe dreasm
" trades infront its nifty supernatural chills for a long series ofthe allegedly spooky jolts tath simply refuse to amke sense
. scenes pile up like a car wreck wih little or noone explaination or exposition
. subplots apear
anbd dissapear
. when claire finally comes face
- tothe
- face withthe our evil murderer
( robert downey jr
.
)
, it turns outloud his name is vivian
, he ' s clairvoyant
and he ' s got some major issues with mama
, a la norman bates
.
" inspite dreasm
" reaches its absurdist zenith here
,
and tghe climax drags wiht mumbled revelations
adn laughable twists
. smoe questions
,
thn
: what ' s wiht the garbage disposal retching applesauce
? are the drawings on tyhe wall blood or paint
? who cranked up the andrews sisters on tje cd player
anbd caused the swing tothe move on its own
? wqat about the computer
? does vivian posess the gft of telekinesis inspite addition tothe his other powers
? why woudl he continually endanger claire if she was necessary fo his ultimate plan
? is the woman in austrailia intregal to anytying
?
and tghe aforementioned flooded city
- what function does that
_ relaly
_ serve
? sigh
. at least iin my pwn dreams
, i cin imagin a better movei where certain talent didn ' t go tothe waste
