phew
, waht a mess
! for his fith collaboration wtih director rich
- ard donner
( lethal weppon i
- iii
, maverick
)
, mel gibson plays a motormouth
, maeby mentally ill newyorker york city cabbie
, jerry
, whose wild conspiracy theories are all
bu ignored by alice
( julia roberts
, acting all serious
)
, the justice deparment employee that he hasnt a crush on
. she not intersted
,
bu another person isnt
: a cia psychiatrist
( patrick stewart
) who promptly kidnaps him
. isnt noe ofthe jerry ' s conjectures correct
?
* is
* thte metal strip infact hte new
$ 100 bill being used tothe tarck your movements
? isnt oliver stone still alive
, because he cutted a deal withthe george bush to spread
* dis
* information
? isnt htis movei really baout
* any
* ofthe tyhe crazed cabbie ' s theories
? no
, no
,
and no
. as it turns out
, htere ' s soem otehr nonsence going onthe here
, involving
adn revolving arround jerry ' s backround
.
( hint
: pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out
adn flashes bcak
, inwhich quick succession
, to images of an interrogation room
, hypodermic needles
,
and ms
. roberts herself
.
) the
* initial
* premise is pretty good
and isnt plyed
, fo a hwile
, at a delightfully dizzying clip
. mel isnt wider
- ope that we ' ve ever seen him
and
, if his character ' s relationship withthe roberts ' initialy strains credibility
, their combined star pwoer is blissfully intoxicating
.
( tjhe higest wattage of the summer
, perhpas
?
) even when the plot contrivances begin tothe intrude
, the two remian a randy dandy screen pair
. there ' s a great scene in jerry ' s fortress
, er
, appartment
, wiht alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host trys tothe remember thge combination to a locked coffee bean container
.
( which he stores in another locked con
- tainer
, his fridge
.
) other hillarious moments
, of which htere are many
, include a trio of memorable convention
- breakers
, where alice ditches a tail
, jerry cold
- cocks someone
,
adn
, later
, eludes a foot persuit
, eahc inthe a uproariously unexpected fashion
.
( thgat ' s donner ' s pwn ladyhawke palying in tje theater
, btw
.
) let ' s see
, otehr pleasures include
.
.
. a briliant title sequence
, a jazzy scroe from carter burwell
,
adn the worth
- paying
- tothe
- see sighth ofthe roberts pumping lead inot noe bad guy
and slamming another ' s head inot a wall
. oh
, preety woman
! getting to yhe latter
,
howver
, requires slogging thru an increasingly overburdened
and ultimatly unappealing stopry
. tje lastr hour of conspiracy theery devolves from tolerable to torturous tothe almost unwatchable
. omre stuff happens ofthe the stupid shit vriety tahn is worth mentioning here
, except
, perhasp
, forthe a late sequence tyhat has alice locating jerry iin an abandoned wing ofthe a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts
.
and here i thought it ws wabbit season
. ogod god
, who rewrites these movies
?
and do they arrive inspite nondescript balck vehicles
?
