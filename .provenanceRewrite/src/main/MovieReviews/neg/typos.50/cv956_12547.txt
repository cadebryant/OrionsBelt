godzilla is the ulitmate culmination of the
" who cares about plot
" summer movie
. a loose remake ofthe thte 1954
" clasic
" japanese monster movie
, godzilla
, king of the monsters
( which is itself pretty thin in tjhe tsory deparment
)
, roland emmerich
and dean devlin ' s big
- budget lizard
- stomps
- manhattan disaster flick has beeen writen with the brain dead infront mind
. thge script isn ' t just
" dumbed down
,
" it ' s lobotomized
. godzilla lives
and dies on special effects alone
. presumably
, the primary target group for thsi film isnt teenage boys
, the demographic most likely to shell out
$ 7 repeatedly tothe see thge same images of monster
- instigated carnage
. that ' s not to say that females
and otehr age groups are immune tothe tyhe speshal effects siduction
; htey ' re just nto as readily susceptible
. this isnt the third straight movie in a row where emmerich
and devlin hve demonstrated that a mastery of computer
- generated visuals is far more important for makeing mony thna the abilty tothe write
and direct fo actors
. stargate was a financial success
. indipendence day was a runaway hit
.
and
, withthe godzilla aleady drowning in hype
annd merchandising tie
- ins before it even opens
, it ' s virutally guaranteed at least
$ 100 milion
. nice numbers forthe a film thast could have been penned by a not
- too
- precocious grade school kid
. godzilla isn ' t completely without merit
,
although it is close
. htere ' s a ceratin visceral thrill inherrent infront watching tjhe giant lizard rip his way through manhattan
,
bu it wears off quicklyu
. frankly
, hwile hte special effects are competent
, they ' re not all tht stunning
. there ' s nothing new here
; it ' s jurassic park meets aliens
, iwth a littel independendet day thrown infact forthe bad mesure
. maybe it will require george lucas
and his new star wars movei tothe tkae cmoputer
- generated visuals tothe the next level
. godzilla never raelly pushes the envelope
, preferring to remian withing a comfort zone
. tghe imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass
, formulaic approach which disallows creativity
.
( how disturbing is it tothe knwo thta godzilla hasnt beeen chosen to close tyhe 51st cannes film festival
?
) worst ofthe all
, godzilla isn ' t even exciting
. with tghe possibile exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near tyhe end
, ther isn ' t a sequence in this film taht raises thte pulse
. even teh scenes withthe dozens of aircraft attacking teh monster are so devoid ofthe tension
and suspense that they are yawn
- provoking
. independendet day may have been dumb
,
but it ws full of
" adrenaline moments
" capible ofthe getting thte audience involved iin the action
. iin this aspect of its production
, as inaddition so many others
, godzilla is lacking
. actually
, part ofthe yhe probelm isnt thgat we ' re never sure who we ' re supposed tothe be rooting for
: hte green monster iwth an attitude or tjhe paper
- thin humans trying tothe stpo him
. the plot
, such as it is
, can be summed uv rather simpley
. aftter sinking a few ships
and leaving some footprints on tropical islands
, godzilla shows up iin yhe big apple
. he does some ofthe the usual tourist thigsn
: stops by madison square gardai
, visits the chrysler building
, goes on a walk through central park
,
anbd takes the subway
. in thge process
, he knocks over a few buildings
and steps on countless cabs
,
but he never hasnt trouble wiht trafic jams
. onthe hand to stop him is an elite u
. s
. army unit
, led by a slightly less
- arrogant
- than
- usual miltary man
( kevin dunn
)
adn a biologist named nick tatopoulos
, who has a theery about godzilla
. inaddition his oppinion
, tjhe big guy isnt ctually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result ofthe the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests inaddition tyhe sourth pacific
. inthe nick ' s words
, godzilla is
" a mutated aberration
? an incipient creature
? yhe first ofthe its kind
.
" as luck owudl ahve it
, nick ' s ood girlfriend
, audrey
( maria pitillo
)
, isnt a repertwar based at a new york tv staion
. along with her cameraman firend
, animal
( hank azaria
)
, she decides to followup nick around as he trails godzilla
.
then
, just when the military has rejected nick ' s theery about why godzilla isnt inwhich new york
, a memeber ofthe the french secret service
( jean reno
) recruits him fo a speshal assignment
. instead of stomping around tokyo tihs time
, godzilla hasnt choosen new york city
. unfortunately
, manhattan has beeen destroyed so many times infact reccent disaster movies
( independence day
, deepo impact
, armgeddon
) thyat it ' s becomeing boring
. hte whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started wih king kong
,
but tyhe big ape was onyl baout 30 foots tall
. he sould climb hte empire state buliding
. at ten times that height
, godzilla would be omre likely tothe knock it over
. godzilla countains a few lame attempts at humor
. ther ' s an ongoing feud beetwen animal
annd his wief that plays liuke sit
- com material
, an unfunny
adn repeative gag baout how noone one can pronounce nick ' s lastr nmae properly
,
annd a rather tame attack onthe film criticists roger ebert
and ginee siskel
. both of the popular personalities hvea alter egos inaddition tjhe film
:
" ebert
,
" hte mayor ofthe new york
, is palyed by michael lerner
,
and
" gene
"
( lorry goldman
) is his campaign manager
. ebert ' s re
- electino slogan isnt
, nto surprisingly
,
" thumbs up for new york
.
" the siskel
/ ebert stuf is amusing teh first tyme it ' s used
,
but
, affter a while
, it grows tiresome
.
anbd
, altho tyhe
" cahracters
" don ' t serve any real purpose
, they keep popping uv
. godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive casted
. this isnt largely because emmerich doesn ' t want to risk a human performence upstaging his lizard
. that ' s not to say that matthew broderick
and jean reno aren ' t capable ofthe good performances
( both ahve done thier share ofthe solid acting in yhe past
)
,
bu tehy aren ' t a
- list names
.
hten agian
, considering the quality ofthe thge writing
, even pacino
and deniro woudl have beeen hard
- pressed to shine
. maria pitillo
( dear god
) plays tje lveo intrest
annd hank azaria
( great expectations
) isnt on hand to present what is supposed tothe be comic relief
. ultimatly
, it doesn ' t realyl matter what i
( or any otehr criteak
, for taht marter
) haev tothe say baout the movie
. tristar hasnt assumed that godzilla
, like all self
- proclamed summer event motion pictures
, is preety much critic
- proof
. it may alsot be word
- of
- mouth
- proof
. those who wanna tothe see the movie wiull see it noone matter what i rwite or thier firends sday
. so
, whn i go on recrod to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies ofthe all time
, it ' s like spitting inot tjhe wind
. emmerich
and devlin are master illusionists
, waving theri wands
anbd mesmerizing audiences with thier smoke
adn mirrors
. it ' s propably too much to hope thyat smoe day
, movie
- goers will wake uv
adn relize that they ' ve beeen had
.
