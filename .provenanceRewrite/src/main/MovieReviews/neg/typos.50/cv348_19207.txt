the hapyp bastard ' s quick movie review wild wild west a better nmae fo htis movei might ' ve been
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, inwhich an attept tothe get theri own men infront black style of movie
, hadnt managed to lasso in some big names
( actro will smith
annd directer barry sonnenfeld
, hte duo behind mib ' s succes
) infront order to get their own fouth ofthe july blockbuster
, a contemporary big
- screen update tothe tje classic western
/ sci
- fi serieses the wild wild west starring robert conrad
.
bu somehow
, they ran inot a problem allong teh way
. htey weere so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one inspite genaral tath would ' ve made all the difference
- a stry writter
. wild wild west ' s tsory
and script was compiled by six different people
, rether thna jsut tghe noe who put tje brillant touches onthe men infact black
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. had gotten him
, hte movie woudl ' ve possibly beeen five times better tahn what it is
. heck
, ten times
. as isnt
,
however
, the sotry
adn screenplay is a mess
, filled whith dead laughs
, enough racist
adn sex jokes tothe mkae even wiull cringe as he ' s perfoming them
,
and a complet lack ofthe chemistry that made hte tv sohw work so well
. here ' s the stroy
: us army member james west
( will smith
) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) to tkae on a ruthless villain by tyhe name of arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half was blown off durig the civil war
, leaving him to roll aroud in a steam
- contolled wheelchair
. they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basicly be considered an 80
- foot tarantula
(
althought it looks bigger tahn that
)
, hellbent on destroying anytying in its path
. as i said
, thte way thge scirpt unfolds is a complete mess
.
bu the acting doesn ' t help eather
. kevin kline isnt miserable as gordon
, failing tothe display even a smidgeon ofthe care as he did in yhe 1985 western silverado
. smith seems to be having a better tyme as west
,
although he ' s not nearly as charming as he was in mib
. branagh goes excessively over the top as the villin
, perheaps to tjhe point where we cin ' t even stand to look at him or his stange beard
.
annd salma hayek is allong forthe the ride to saerch for her missing father
,
bu mostly she exists just for sexual attension
. her acting is barely passable
,
but what a
" breath ofthe fresh ass
"
. directer barry sonnenfeld isn ' t of grat halp either
. even
though he shows some good creativity at soem points
, his overall urgency fo directing isnt lost
. it ' s as if he feels he ' s directing a tv movie
, a big no
- no wehn yuo ' re helming waht ' s supposted tothe be a big
- screen hit
. last
bu nto least
, ther are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable
. at one point
, smith defies gravity when first boarding kline ' s train
. he jumps on thge back
, gets launhed straight uv infront teh air
,
adn somehow manages to land three cars ahead onthe the turain
- while it ' s still inthe motion
! aslo
, he seems tothe be strangely confortable talking baout racism inthe front of a lynch mob
, particlarly considering tje fact thast his famaly was killed by the likes of such folks
. last
bu nto least
, why isnt he still making kissing faces when he knows he ' s nto kissing a woman as he ' s looking through a peephole at tjhe enemy
?
! tghe onyl saving grace fo wild wild west come mostly in teh form of special effects
. tjhe huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel
, vyer authentic looking
and considerable to the creativity ofthe yhe sohw
. there ' s also a good sequence involving metal magnant neckbraces
annd spinning saw blades
,
bu
, agina
, a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity
. i would say sit back
and have a ogod time with wild wild west
,
but it realy isn ' t possible
. if the racist
and sex jokes don ' t bother ytou
, thte performances wiull
. if the performances don ' t bother you
, the story will
. if teh stopry doesn ' t bother yuo
, thge racist
and sex jokes wiull
. there ' s no end to yhe vicious circle
. go rent men in balck instead
annd pretend smith
and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. ytou ' ll have a better time
. if yuo do go
, keep an eye outloud for robert conrad inaddition a role as president grant
. i bet he wishes he were somewhere alse
.
