guilt
. guilt is something i felt hwile watching basic instinct forthe tjhe ninth time
; the penultimate t
& a thriller
, basic instinct made my lastr faw teenage eyars worth living
.
but i nkow so well thyat it ' s a terrable film
, made by a terrible directer incapable ofthe feeling guilt
. verhoeven went onthe to amke the even more offensive showgirls
adn
, onthe november seventh
, 1997
, unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me
, who cannnot control teh urger tothe see giant bug movies
. thte pic beigns wtih tjhe most unintentional laugh of tje year
. a simple
, white on balck title card reads
" starship troopers
"
- my friends
and i speculated that tjhe night befoer the prints were shipped
, verhoeven realized he forgot the credits
. is this how a hundred million doller movei should ope
? weere thte rest of tjhe film that subdued
.
.
. starship troopers is baout a gropu ofthe white
, blond
- haired himbos
and bimbos who all have spanish last names
. they graduat high school
, join the military
,
and
then
, rether curiously
, deside to travel to an alien planet
and destory all lifeforms onthe that planet
. tje stoyr is so incomprehensible
,
and told so bombastically
, it ' s akin tothe 129 minutes of somone screaming punishments at you in a foerign tongue
.
( aside
, club lovers will be happy to know thta dance music hasn ' t changed inwhich the future
.
) one plus
: starship troopers contains soem vyre funny sequences
, specifically thte newsreels ofthe thge future
. hysterically funny
, actualyl
.
bu the cynicism ofthe these reports left me curious as to whther verhoeven felt pessimistic about yhe stry in between
. tghe storytelling lacks focus
, tothe say tyhe least
. tjhe politics ofthe tje film are scary
. hte actions ofthe the major female charachters are dictated by their outloud
- of
- control libidos
. htere ' s even a creepy sex scene
: tghe lovley dina meyer makse out
, nude
, whith yhe sickening van dien hwile half her face is covered by her opaque sweater
, just yhe way he seems tothe liuke it
. i uise the term sickening because van dien isnt tghe least appealing actro i ' ve encountered in a big budget picture
; all chiseled features
annd machismo
, he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders
. ofthe course
, verhoeven ' s probablly the one tothe blame
,
and prehaps i ' m jealous because i ' m so disgusting
. at any rate
, a movei called starship troopers shouldn ' t be about sex
. exactly ten yersa ago
, verhoeven made robocop
, whcih was baout nothing
but skillfully made
anbd oddly moving
.
anbd r
- rated
, despite its goofy premise
. maybee it ' s asking too much for verhoeven tothe make a pg
- movie
,
thn
- he ' s a master ofthe insipid violentce
.
however
, ten year old boys woudl adore starship troopers if tehy could see it
.
