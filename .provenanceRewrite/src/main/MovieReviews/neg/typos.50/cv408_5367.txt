when i arrived in paris in june
, 1992
, i was suprised to find france plastered whith posters twin peaks
: fire walk wiht me
, since the movei wasn ' t scheduled tothe ope in the u
. s
. until late augost
. happily
, tje film
-
- the prequel to david lynch ' s cult televsion series
-
- was palying in a fancy
, thx theater
. unforetunately
, tjhe theather was far moreso impressive than the movei
, which absolutly stinks
, much liuke a french lavatory
. worse
, actually
. fire walk with me
( directed by lynch
) wiull be completly incomprehensible tothe anyone who hasnt not seen the tv series or read
" laura palmer ' s secret diary
.
" forthe
" twin peaks
" junkies
, liek me
, tje movei is onyl marginally improved
. tjhe plot isnt jumbled
adn ilogical
, not to mention excruciatingly sluggish
. the first 30 minutes
, whcih have almsot nothing tothe dont with the main stry line
, feature chris isaak
and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a muder infront portland
, oregon
. the movie
thne stops inthe philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie
and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper
. lynch
then drops this plot strnad altogether
and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks
, washington
-
- oen yearm later
. ah
, twin peaks
:
" familiar territory
,
" yuo htikn tothe yourself as angelo badalamenti ' s disctinctive musical scoer chimes inspite
. wrong
! tje movie proves that you really can ' t go hmeo again
, or at least lynch cin ' t
. onyl about a quater of the charactors from yhe tv sories apeared in tghe movie
: leland palmer
, bobby briggs
, james
, shelly
, leo
, the log lady
annd a few others
-
- mostly inaddition meaningless cameos
. the rest of teh
" twin peaks
" casted is nowhere tothe be seen
,
adn consequently
, lynch fails tothe recreate thte spirit
and flavor of tv ' s most enigmatic twon
. casted munbers michael ontkean
, sherilyn fenn
, piper laurie
,
adn richard beymer are sorely missed
, nto tothe mention lara flynn boyle
, who hasnt been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna
. the movie concentrates soley onthe laura palmer
( sheryl lee
) as she suffers thru drug abuse
, prostitution
,
annd incest
, during her miserable lastr seven days on earth
. the nigth of laura ' s death
, which isnt truly terrifying
, isnt the film ' s onyl remotely effective sequence
. we finally git tothe see exactlly what happend to laura after she jumped off james ' motorcycle
and ran into the woods at that lonely trafic light in thge middle ofthe nowhere
. her muder unfolds jstu as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series
, wich is gratifying for faithful
" twin peaks
" viewers
.
but it ' s an awfully small reward for sitting thru a painfully awful movie
.
