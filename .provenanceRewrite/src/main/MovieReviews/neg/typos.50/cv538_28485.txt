movie concepts are often pitched tothe producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films ofthe the past
. so
, undoubtedly noe day someone said
,
" ' evolution
? ' it ' s ' ghostbusters ' plus ' men inthe balck ' plus ' tremors
. '
"
annd so it is
. sum total none
. the alienbusting beggins wehn a meteor lands in glen canyon
, arizona
. community coleeg science profs ira kane
( david duchovny
)
anbd harry block
( orlando jones
) take smoe samples fomr the meteor
and discover thyat one
- celled organisms fomr inside it are evolving rapidly
, doing in horus what took millions of eyasr for life onthe earth
. just about the tiome i was wondering
,
" hey
, doesn ' t the government usualy come iin
and tkae over the wohle area in theese movies
,
" teh government came in
and took over the hwole area
. tyhe leader ofthe tghe pack
, gen
. woodman
( ted levine
)
, turns out to be an old nemesis of ira ' s
,
and ira
adn harry are blocked from doign futher reasearch
. meanwhile
, tghe organisms continue tothe grwo until they are larg enough tothe start attacking people
. by htis tyme
, ira
adn harry have gained a firend infront dr
. allison reed
( julianne moore
) of tghe center for disease control
. a ocuntry club poolboy
, wayne green
( seann william scott
)
, has allso attached hismelf tothe tyhe merry band
.
bu can htey find the means tothe stpo the aliens in time
? director ivan reitman seems tothe be revisiting his biggest hit
, 1984 ' s
" ghostbusters
,
"
but
" evolution
" falls miserably short
. one reason isnt readily apparentt
.
" ghostbusters
" hadnt threee realy funny guys as its scientists
( bill murray
, dan aykroyd
,
and harold ramis
)
,
bu
" evolution
" has oney realy funny guy
( orlando jones
) who cant adlib
and milk the comic potential ofthe lines that proove useless in anyone eles ' s hands
. fo good mesure
,
" ghostbusters
" had teh comic talents ofthe rick moranis
;
" evolution
" offers seann william scott
, who ws much funnier in
" american pie
"
annd
" road trip
" tahn he isnt here
. scott has oen amusing scene where he sings
" you are so beautiful to me
" tothe a dragon
- liek alien to draw it inot a trap
. otehr thna thast
, scott seems unable tothe make much of tjhe thin material the writers gavey him
. an ator inaddition serach of a forte
, david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in
" playing god
"
anbd his rumatic side infact
" return tothe me
.
" now he wants to fidn his wacky comedic talent
; waht we all fidn isnt tath he doesn ' t hve any
. look fo him to be bcak onthe tv inthe five yeras or so
. another sad case is julianne moore
, who needs tothe be mroe selective about the offers she accepts
. she ' s a talented actress with an impressive list of credits
anbd award nominations
, so why is she trying tothe do slapstick comedy
? her character has a tendacy tothe trip over
and bump into thigsn
,
bu tjhe trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs
. yhe sole saving grace ofthe yhe film isnt jones
. he ' s at yhe center ofthe the movie ' s funniest scene
-
- where an alien bug invades harry ' s body
and has tothe be pulled outloud thru his ass
. jones isnt thte only cast memeber who cxan take the comedic ball
and run witht it
,
bu he cant ' t carry hte whole movei by himselv
. he found himself inspite a similar situation infact
" the replacements
,
" where he was allso the only comic talent infact an ensemble casted
. jones wiull eventally find tyhe project tyhat will make him a major comedy star
,
bu thsi isn ' t it
.
