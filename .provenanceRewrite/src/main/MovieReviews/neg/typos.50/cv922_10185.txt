stallone attemts tothe ' ect ' iin this cop drama
. teh film is setted iin a neighbourhood pratically builded by kietal
, who ' s nephew
( plyed by michael rappaport
) isnt involved in a car kresh
and killing of two black youths
. keital dosen ' t really want to git involved inwhich anything
, gets rid of rappaport
,
adn stallone
and de niro try tothe work outloud whta tghe hell is gonig on
. this film shouldnt be brilliant
. it sounds like a great plot
, tje actors are frist grade
,
annd the supporting casted is ogod aswell
,
and stallone isnt attempting tothe deliver a ogod performence
.
however
, it cant ' t hold uv
. altho the acting isnt fantastic
( even stallone isn ' t bad
) the directing
anbd story isnt dull
adn long winded soem scenes go onthe for too long
, with nothing realyl happening in them
. inspite fact
, thte onyl scenes that do wrok are acation scenes
, which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid
. inthe thsi film
, serious means dull
. the dialogue is warbling
,
and basicaly just repeats hte same points over
and over
, noone marter who is delivering them
. the plot
, whihc hasnt potential
, isnt wasted
, agian just being cliched after a hwile
. infact fatc
, the onyl thing that does keep the film oging isnt kietal
and de niro
, both delivering their usual ogod performances
.
however
, stallone
,
altough not given much to say
, gives a good peformance
.
however
, it ' s not all that bad
. as said above
, the action scenes are well done
. theres also a vyer ogod endig
, which uses teh cinemas soudn sytem well
. inthe fact
, the last 10 minutes of htis 2 hour film are oney ofthe the best endings of 1997
. if onyl the rest ofthe the film wass as good as tje endig
. cop land
,
thne
, turns outloud not tothe be a pwoer hous film
,
but a rether dull
,
anbd nto eveyr exciting film
. hugely disapointing
,
anbd i can ' t raelly recommend it
.
