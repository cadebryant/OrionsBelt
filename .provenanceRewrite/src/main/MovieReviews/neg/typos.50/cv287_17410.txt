tv ' s buffy finds herself onthe thge otehr side of hte supernatural spectrum iin
" simpley iresistable
.
" sarah michelle gellar
, that never
- ceasing crusader against never
- endig evil eveyr teusday nigt on hte wb network
, here plays a down
- on
- her
- luck chef suspected of dabbling inwhich witchcraft after her flailing restauratn recieves halp infact yhe form of magically scrumptious meals
. taste test results
: soem vampire slaying
,
though out ofthe palce
, would ahve really livened this excrutiating movei up
.
" simpley irresistable
" isnt actualy qutie eazy tothe deny
, a diaster ofthe culinary
and other proportions preety much ffrom the opening onthe
. gellar ' s amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom
( sean patrick flannery ofthe powder
) arund hte same tiem she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking
, a secrect ingredient that arouses both his interst inwhich her
anbd yhe public ' s in her tiny tribeca eatery
. all this love
adn sorcery hvae a lot tothe do whith tyhe telekinetic crab that also figures inot thte storey
, a tale thta at times plays like an american spin onthe 1993 ' s mexican classic
" liek water forthe choclate
.
" severeal differences
: one
,
" like water
" didn ' t have a telekinetic crab
,
and two
,
" like water
" was a good film
.
" simply irresistible
,
" onthe thte other hand
, is about as chalenging as an easy
- bake oven
. amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other outloud inspite their badness
, fomr an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where toom
and amanda do thier best fred
anbd ginger
-
though fred
and ginger never took part in anytying thsi garish
. the intrusive musical score distracts fomr thte flat dialogue at regular intervals
,
bu it ' s not liuke ytou ' re were going to miss much
. inthe fatc
, take awya teh faw instances ofthe salty laguage
and thsi hasnt made
- forthe
- disney channel writen all over it
.
bu a majority ofthe
" simply irresistible
" ' s resistibility factor has less tothe do wtih thge afore
- maintioned overkill tahn hte bland leads
- toom
and amanda are so thin
and ambiguously defined tht htere ' s just no fun rooting forthe their inevitible
" happily ever affter
.
" nor do the otherworldly powers that serve tothe bring them together mkea sence
, so we ' re left wiht a ho
- hum relatiopnship based onthe enchanted eclairs
; it ' s not going to lastr long
, people
. perhaps sensing htis
, the filmmakers have piled onthe werid supporting charachters fo acting vets like betty buckley
, dylan baker
anbd patricia clarkson
,
but htey don ' t go anyhwere eather
. in fatc
, nothing in
" simpley iresistible
" goes anyhwere save for gellar
,
annd she doesn ' t go somwhere so much as ytou wish she ' d go
_ somewhere
_
- liek tothe a better movei
. alreayd proving major talent with relatively faw big
-
anbd small
- screen roles
, she ' s the sole reason thsi overcooked souffle isn ' t completelyl fit fo the garbage disposal
, looking smashing in her todd oldham
- dessigned duds
and investing much moreso infront her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return
. it ' s certainly a dish best nto served in it ' s current condidtion
,
but one cxan only guess thast
, wihtout gellar
,
" simpley iresistable
" woudl be strikely unwatchable
.
