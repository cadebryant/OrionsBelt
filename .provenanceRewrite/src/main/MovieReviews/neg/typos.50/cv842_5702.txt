according to the publicity material
, with this movie the directors
" hope tothe restore ogod ood
- fashioned bowling tothe its rightful palce iin thge mainstream ofthe american consciousness
.
" hmm
. you never konw
, they just might be on to something
. what wtih tghe rise ofthe geek chic
, lounge music
anbd seventies fashion
, teh ever
- contrary kids ofthe the ninties might jsut latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion ofthe tackyana tothe claim as theri pwn
.
bu
thn
, i dout if kingpin iwll ahve anything to do wiht it
. it ' s cheesy all right
,
bu connoisseurs ofthe bad tast will fidn this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch
. thta ' s a shame
, becouse
, inthe the first ten mintues or so tjhe film promises tothe be a lot more
. woody harrelson plays thte hotshot bowler on the ries
, roy munson
. the movie opens inwhich the fifties with roy ' s dad dishing outloud the reader ' s digest
/ gumpian wisdom inaddition scoopfuls
, shifting tothe hte 70s for a hilarious spoof of saterday ngiht fever
. tghe sardonic tone of tyhe proceedings is much enhanced by the presence ofthe bill murray
, as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken
. it ' s thanks tothe murray tyhat the first quarter of kingpin seems so good
- he gives the wry
, derisive edge to htis otherwise rether unfocused comedy
. mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job
,
then abondons him tothe an angry mob who mangle roy ' s hand
.
hten it ' s fast foward 17 yeras later wehn munson isnt a fat
, balding losr withthe a prosthetic rubber hand
. he ' s hopeless until he meets ishmael
( randy quaid
)
, an amish amateur bowler thyat munson takes onthe as protege
. so toghether they setted outloud forthe thte million doller bowling tournament in reno
, picking up pretty hustler claudia
( vanessa ange
) onthe thte way
. with tjhe exit of bill murray
, the filmmakers seem to have onyl oen direction to go
,
and that ' s
.
.
. dumb
anbd dumber
. yes
, indeed
, kingpin isnt brought to you by thsoe modern proponents ofthe laxative humour
, peter
annd bobby farrelly
, the directors ofthe the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle
. so
, prepare for much slaparound comedy wih flying rubber hands
, distended nipples
, ridiculous hair
and bull semen
. get setted forthe stock fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water situations wehn city
- boy roy puts onthe a beard
and tries to blend in wiht tyhe amish comunity
, or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes onthe smoking
, striptease
and unchristian neighbour
- socking
. nowe
, don ' t git me wrong
, there ' s nothing wrong with cheap humour
,
and i hadnt my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody
anbd randy
. yhe trouble isnt taht theese jokes aren ' t bold or funny enought tothe drive a movei that bumbles allong wihtout much sence of direction
. it lurches ffrom sports movie tothe amish
- mocking to road
- trip tothe sentimental meledrama
,
( pausing fo a broadside spoof ofthe indecent proposal
,
anbd many shameless plugs forthe tje accompanying pop sountrack
)
, never quite getting it all toghether
. soem gags fall flat fomr a lack ofthe build
- uv
, while there are bits
and pieces in the movie tht simply don ' t dont anything
. why tyhe long
, unfunny fight inthe the car park
? why twpo of theese
? why doens that guy mear mascara
, or that guy have a glass bowling ball wiht a rose inthe it
? tjhe film isnt full ofthe theese half
- thougth
- thru idesa thast give the impression of any ood gaffer
, grip or makeup artist throwing inaddition random stuff
annd saying
,
" wouldn ' t that be funny
?
"
. well
, noone
, actually
. hte actors don ' t dont tyhe movie much favours either
. woody harrelson comes off okay
, plausibly acting dumb
, smart
, cynical or innocent when teh implausible scirpt calls for it
,
but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham
,
anbd vanessa angel has no talent
( like schwarzenegger
, she seems mroe convincing playing a computer
- creation than a human
-
- take the tv series werid science
.
.
. please
)
. even murray hams it uv when he reappears in the movei ' s climax
. all infront all
, a fairly useless attemp at comedy
,
adn a certified no
- hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance
. we ' ll have tothe look tothe a reinspired john waters
, or perheaps somebody fomr down under
(
" strikely bowling
