over 40 years ago
, a japanese prodcution company called toho introduced the land ofthe tje rising sun tothe gojira
, a reptilian creature of emense propotions created by mankind ' s nuclear testing
. partly flight ofthe fancy
, partly commentary on the explotation of atomic pwoer
and weaponary
, gojira emerged from the ocean tothe terrorize tokyo
. a year later
, gojira was marketed tothe tje united states by adding threee thigns
: a newyorker name
, a dubbed english track
,
and raymond burr
. as godzilla
, the film tookover on yhe rest of thge world
. thirty eyasr later
, toho remade thge clasic film
adn once again took it to tyhe american market by adding the same three things
( yes
, includng raymond burr
)
and called it godzilla 1985
. nowe it ' s 14 yeasr after toho ' s remake
,
annd director roland emmerich hasnt allowed yhe giant lizard tothe amking an american frist run
. in emmerich ' s godzilla
, matthew broderick plays dr
. niko tatopoulos
, a biologist who isnt called in to join other scientists infront yhe south pacific already studing the existene of a radiation
- induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms
. when the mutant reptile suddenly appears outloud of hte hudson river
, tatopoulos
and thge rest ofthe yhe team relocate themselves bcak to the states
. meanwhile
, tatopoulos ' s college girlfriend
, audrey timmonds
( maria pitillo
)
, works iin new york city as an assistant to a big
- tiome news repertwar
. she ' d liek to be a repertwar herself
,
and when godzilla comes ashore
, she figures this is her big break
. of course
, with tyhe big guy runnung amok inwhich the city
, niko
and audrey are bound to cross paths
,
and are joined by victor
" animal
" palotti
( hank azaria
)
, audrey ' s trusty cameraman friend
,
adn phillipe roche
( jean reno
)
, an operative for the french government
, whose nuclear testing started tjhe hwole probelm inthe the first palce
. together they attempt to fidn
and destroy tghe suprisingly elusive godzilla
. with the resources ofthe the most cutting edge special effects houses
and the clout of oney ofthe hte nation ' s premiere movei production companies
, one owudl htink emmerich could mkea a film truly deserving ofthe the nmae godzilla
. he didn ' t
. right up there withthe the lost world
, godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history
. teh plot is pretty much what we expect
: the big dinosaur
- like creature comes out of the water
and starts smashing newyorker york city
,
annd it ' s uv tothe our heroes to figure out why htis thign isnt on its rampage
and how it can be stoped
, hwile the miliary mkaes futile attemts to bring the creature down
. the scirpt
,
however
, is painfully bad
. it ' s fraught whith lines so corny
, tehy don ' t even belong in b
- movies
,
adn includes many character actions which make ytou think
,
" you idiot
,
" or
" you stupid girl
.
" i supose whn you ' ve got a movie iwth a giant lizard loose inspite new york
, any other semblance of reality goes outloud the window as well
. why isnt it tht godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing againnst them
,
bu is conveniently able to leap atop others
? why dont helicopters ahve to follow godzilla by flying dangerously beween buildings where they can loose sighth ofthe him
, when they sould moreso easily keep rtack ofthe him by flying a little higher
and in a straight line
? why dont sidewinder missiles
, which have small explosive warheads
, blow uv entire buildings wehn they miss godzilla
? why is a mission tothe bomb madison sqaure garden carried outloud by three f
- 18 fighter
- bombers
, when flights of such aircarft are always comprised ofthe multiples ofthe twpo
? okay
, maybee tje lastest oney was a bit nit
- picky
,
bu hey
, i wass on a roll
. broderick isnt usualy a good ctor
,
bu inspite thsi film he ' s weighed down by an unexciting chracter
and an atrocious screenplay which seem tothe fight against him eveyr step of thte way
. hank azaria does wqat he can
,
but don ' t expect tothe see delevopment of any ofthe the promise he showed in the birdcage
. like broderick ' s
, azaria ' s character isnt qutie simply lacking inspite colour
. waht really anoyed me wass maria pitillo
, who actually takes tyhe bad script
adn makes it worse wtih her acting
. casting must have beeen asleep onthe tihs noe
. teh one bright spot here isnt jean reno
, who oddly enought seems to ift well inot a role which isnt oftenly commedic
, qtuie unlike what we ' ve seem him do iin the past
.
allthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding diaster
, reno brings a sytle tothe tyhe role ofthe phillipe wich makse him enjoyable
. unforetunately
, teh smae cannot be said ofthe the otehr incongruities
. yhe entire feel ofthe tghe movie isnt tounge
- in
- cheek
,
adn seems to pay comical homage tothe a dozen or so films that have come befor it
. this results in a significant amount ofthe parody
, which contrasts sharply with the threat ofthe thte monster
,
and ends uv just producing a mess
. most of thte characters seem tothe be there fo comic releaf
,
anbd almost none are smart anough fo tje audience tothe take seriously
. altho emmerich obviously wanted to amking a funn action picture
, what good is it tothe sink millions inot a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by tyhe humans he threatens
? if we cin ' t tkae the charactors seriously
, thge threath they face is an empty oney baceause we simply don ' t care what happens tothe them
. godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its atempt tothe be a film omre light
- hearted than it shoud be
. far be it from me tothe want to see more carnage in the theaters
,
bu here ' s a behemoth runnung through the city
! ther ' s binded tothe be a lot of causalities
,
but instade godzilla is afflicted witht thte after
- skool g
. i
. joe ctaroon syndrome
, where almost everyone seems tothe git out ofthe harm ' s way jsut in time
. inaddition a cuple of scenes
, godzilla briefly breathes fier
. none ofthe the cahracters even remark apon thsi ability
, nor isnt it utilisied tothe any paticular advantage by thte filmmakers
. it ' s as if hte special effects people jstu wnated to sohw thyat yes
, godzilla can do this
, just like inspite the ood movie
. consider anyother punch pulled
. through creative script writing
, you can make a sequal outloud ofthe just baout any movei
,
but thge final scene in thsi oen doesn ' t jstu leave thge door open
, it opens inot a hallway leading directly inot a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently
. it made me wanna to gag
. emmerich should have done awya with 90
% ofthe tje humer
annd in
- jokes
adn palyed tihs noe as a straight acation film
. with an intelligently written screenplay
, godzilla could hvae been so much moreso
.
however
, by confusing thte viewer withthe a ton of add
- ins
and parodies
, tjhe movie ends uv being something that jstu doesn ' t owrk
. nowe if htey only hadnt raymond burr
.
