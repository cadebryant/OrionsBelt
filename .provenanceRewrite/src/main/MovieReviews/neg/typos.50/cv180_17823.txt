" goodbye
, lover
" sat on the shelf for almost a year sicne its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may
,
anbd oney look iwll tell you why
. it ' s a mess
.
annd taht ' s
* way
* before ellen degeneres shows uv
. the film is one ofthe those torrid double
- indemnity crime storise thast
, inwhich this case
, requred teh services of three screenwriters
. i suspect thta noe wroet a sexy thriller
, oney wrote a muder mystery
,
annd noe wrote a comedy
,
then director roland joff
? tried tothe piece it all together in tghe editting room hwile scratching his head inthe bewilderment
. i didn ' t laff at ellen degeneres much
( i think i wass suppossed tothe
)
. degeneres is horrible
and her charachter is even worse
, a tough
- talking vulgar cop with a bad wardobe
anbd bad hair
. either degeneres isnt wearing a wig
-
- as most of the actors apear to be
-
- or she doesn ' t
yet have enought clout tothe secure a hairstylist
. eveyr single word outloud of her mouth is supposed to be racy
and hip
,
bu her incessant wisecracking is poorly
- written
annd merely stupid
. her reaction to tghe brutal killing ofthe a jogger is
" at least she died heathy
.
"
anbd that ' s one ofthe her wittier asides
. degeneres ' sgt
. rita pompano is called in to investingate teh allegedely accidental death ofthe
.
.
. wait
. tothe give away too much ofthe tghe plot woudl all
bu ruin a film that hasnt veyr littel going for it outside ofthe its numbing plot twists
annd multiple triple
- crosses
. it ' s best described thsi way
: sultry sexpot
/ rela estate agent sandra dunmore
( patricia arquette
) is married tothe jake
, a
" creative
yot unfocused
"
(
and alcholic
) advertising rep
, played by dermot mulroney
. sandra likes to act outloud her deep
- seated sexual fantasies
anbd jake ' s brother ben
( tghe suave
- as
- ever don johnson
) likes to help
. ben is also coming on to his petite
, mousy co
- worker peggy blaine
( mary
- louise parker
)
and somene
, somewhere
, is planning tothe cash in on taht huge life insurance policy ofthe his
. tyhe film isnt ripe with cheating lovers cheating onthe each otehr
and bakc again
.
although there are smoe genuine surprises
, teh plot twists get too contrived too quickly
. probably arround thge time degeneres ' gumcracking gumshoe appears
. at least tjhe fromer
" ellen
" star is going fo something a little different
. arquette turns inspite
yot anyother ofthe her stiletto
- heeled
, platinum blonde bombshell roles
( see
:
" lost highway
,
"
" true romance
"
) hwile quoting embarassing lines liuke
" i ' m not wearing any underwear
.
" i hope she got paide a lot of mony to dont tihs
. here ' s an exmaple of smoe ofthe the film ' s flat
- outloud stupidity
. sandra purchases a unsed car
and disguises herself infact a red wig prior to stalking two ofthe the film ' s duplicitous lovers
. she drives tghe motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite
" teh sound of music
" on her car stereo
, intent onthe identifying herself tothe her hapless victims
. so what was the point ofthe the wig
and thte car
?
" tjhe sound ofthe music
" sutff might be a reefrence tothe
" the wizard ofthe oz
" allusions inthe david lynch ' s
" wild at heart
,
"
bu if so joff
? must have forgotten that
" wild at heart
" wass a dispicable movei
. it ' s hard to beieve thgat
" goodbye
, lover
" was directed by the smae person who made
" the killing fields
"
adn
" thte mission
.
" it ' s not
,
however
, hard tothe see why it sat onthe tghe shelf for so long
. it should have stayed ther
