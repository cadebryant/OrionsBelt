tothe put it bluntly
, ed wood would have beeen proud of this
. a totally rediculous plot is encompassed whith bad humor
, hokey drama
, zero logic
and a crap screenplay
. also
, a beautifully anti
- climactic endig
. not to say it didn ' t look intriguing when i saw the previews
. so much forthe truth inspite advertising
. roland emmerich
, who ' s later
" independece day
" would look liek
" the 400 blows
" compaired tothe this
, co
- writed
annd directed this inane sci
- fi film which uses tje cliche ofthe there bieng soem connection between eqypt
anbd aliens
. in a useless oppening sequence
, men find a stone in 1914 withthe heiroglyphics on it
. it wouldn ' t be till present day
( ' 94
) till htey would actually figure it out
. tehy ' re decipherer
? a slightly
- neurotic scientist
( nice twist
)

adn smoe indy fare
) who ' s life sucks so much that peopel walk out of his lectures affter hte thrid word

" jack
" o ' neill
( kurt russel
, withthe his wyat earp locks in the beginning

)
