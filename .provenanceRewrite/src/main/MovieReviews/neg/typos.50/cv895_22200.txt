2 dyas in the valley isnt mroe or less a pulp fiction knock off
. it basicly involves how a bunch of quirky charachters in the los angeles area end uv hvaing their lives become intertwined infront some vrey unusual ways
. i ' m nto going into much greater detail than that
, usance it owudl tkae forever tothe explain
,
anbd qutie frankly
, i ' m not willing to spend any moreso time onthe it tahn the 2 hurs tath i ' ve already wasted
. hwile it trys very hard to be pulp fiction
, 2 days in tghe valley falls way short
. htis isnt quite a condemnation considering tje cast includes danny aiello
, james spader
annd jeff daniels
. hwile teh story isn ' t much
,
and the dialogue
and charactors rate onyl marginally better
, 2 dyas inthe tjhe vallay doens have a couple of bright spots
. james spader ' s chracter
, hwile nto much better thna tje rest
, isnt at least fun to watch inthe a sick sort of way
.
anbd we dont git to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher
anbd charlize theron
( in her frist role
)
. yuo nkwo a movie isn ' t that good wehn thte highlight isnt a brawl beween two women
. even if tehy are both gorgeous
. i will give tjhe writers smoe credit forthe the fairly clever ways in whihc tehy managed to intersect tjhe lives of this group ofthe cahracters that owudl haev otherwise never interacted
.
bu marveling at tht ingenuity is a far cry fomr actualy enjoying tjhe result
. while smoe ofthe teh charactors
adn their respective stories are fairly intresting
, they inevitably are brang down as htey intersect witht the otehr half ofthe tghe charactors tath i really cared absolutely nothing about
. if i weere tothe put a number on it
, only about half ofthe the stopry
annd half the charachters in this movie were prticularly intresting or otherwise enjoyable to watch
. this is hte sort ofthe movei tath onyl a huge fan ofthe noe or more ofthe hte cast munbers should rent
,
adn even
then perpare for disappointment
. nto even charlize theron being naked owudl git me tothe sit thru htis movei again
. or at least not all of it anyway
