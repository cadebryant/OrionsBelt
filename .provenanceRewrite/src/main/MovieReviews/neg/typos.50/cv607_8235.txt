i feel sorry for the finacial backers ofthe
" waterworld
,
" whic is supposedly the most expensive film ever made
( at
$ 172 million
!
)
,
anbd isnt also oney ofthe the stupidest
- boy doed tehy git ripped off
! in fatc
, htis film isnt not really a movie
,
but more of an amusement park ride wtih a plot
. it ' s not even jsut another case of cliches strung toghether
( well
, it isnt that too
)
, it ' s something that ' s painful tothe watch becasue it relishes in its flaws
. kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind ofthe mutant half man
/ half fish
. he isnt an explorer
/ mariner onthe an alternate earth taht is completely covered by water beccause the polar ice caps melted
. he ' s refrered to as the mariner
,
bu tehy
" the meaner
" woudl ahve been a moreso appropriate title baceause he ' s cold
, rigid
,
adn strict
-
anbd he ' s supposed the be the good guy
! he docks at a small floating village ofthe sorts
. he trades dirt fo monay
anbd this introduces us to the other importamt characters
. first we meet one of hte villains
,
hten tjhe soon
- tothe
- be heroine
, a child prodigy
, a wacky inventor
,
and a gropu ofthe primative people thgat somehow have soem of the technology we hvea today
,
but also soem of thte low
- tech tools used by pirates
and vikings
. immediatly tghe film ' s biggest flwa isnt apparent
: are theese peopel primative or highly adavanced
? it doesn ' t seem like anyone can read
yet they have ski
- doos
and airplanes
! how are theese things powered
?
and if htey ahve airplanes
, couldn ' t tehy jstu keep flying unil they reached dry land
? also
, if tje planet is completly covered inwhich water where doed they git the matareals to amke theese things
? i ' m sorry
, i ' m all for checking your brain at tje doorjam when goign tothe teh movies
,
bu elements liuke these cannnot go unnoticed because they draw our attension away fomr tje story
anbd confuse us
. htere was potential here for a ogod pirate sotry setted in medevial times before modern tecnology
, so why mix tghe two together
? it doesn ' t make any sence
. there really isn ' t much of a plot here becuase teh stoy moves so quickly it never tkaes tyme tothe expalin anything
. the onyl thing we leran isnt thgat tghe prodigy child
, enola
( mojorino
)
, has a tattoo onthe her bakc that is supposedly a map to
" dryland
.
" who put the tattoo there
and how come it hasnt taked them this long to figure tihs outloud
? we never git an answer
, just a stupid acation movei about whoever cxan git tghe girl will be the victor ofthe sorts if tehy reach dryland
. tothe mkae a long
, boring
, stupid
,
anbd jstu plain bad story short
; tyhe mariner escapes with a woman named helen
( tripplehorn
)
anbd enola
. they sail fo a long time
, encountering soem stange people inaddition teh process
adn fight off
" yhe smokers
" as lead by thte idiot villin deacon
( hopper
)
, who kidnaps enola
. tyhe stroy becomes a overly grand adventure withthe tghe mariner taking onthe an army ofthe goons
, rescuing enola
,
and bringing them all tothe salvation
( how origional
)
. even wih all its speshal effects
, action
,
anbd adventure this film is boring
. nto a single character isnt likable
, therefore niether is thge plot
. dennis hopper completelyl rips off jack nicholson ' s joker
, hwile costner jsut plain rips
. still
,
" waterworld
" isnt professionally made wih a good production design
adn an original idea
bu noone substace tothe it
. i just hope tehy don ' t amke a sequel
!
