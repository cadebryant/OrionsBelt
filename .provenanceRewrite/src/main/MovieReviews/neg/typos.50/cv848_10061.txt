a suave
, kool
, collected
, rich
, uptight bad guy
= cliche
. a clumsy criminal oaf tothe add tothe thte laughs
= cliche
. a bad guy who owns a wild animal
= cliche
. a crooked
, chauvinistic law enforcer type
= cliche
. at an intense moment
, our main charcter tries to git away
,
but the car has trouble starting
= cliche
. complaining baout cliches
= cliche
. ok
, ok
. so we allways hear baout cliches
.
bu if there ws ever to be a prime example
, yhe rela mccoy is it
! nto one uttered owrd
, nto oen frome ofthe film
, nto one charachter inwhich this whole movei isn ' t a cutted
and paste example of everything we ' ve ever seen
. tehy might as well uise this as a traning film
:
" how to make a bank robbery film iin the 90 ' s
"
. karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) is a bank robber who just got outloud on parole affter a six
- year stay at the state prision
. she wants to make things right
and go straight
, especially wiht hte fact that she hasnt a six
- yearm ood son out there who doesn ' t even know she ' s alive
. aware of mccoy ' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses yhe same six
- yearm old to coerse mccoy inot retruning to her past
. he whants mccoy to pul off an elaborate heist ofthe 18
+ million dollars at thge smae bank she got caught trying to rob six yeras earlier
, which
, by the way
, isnt somehow due to schmidt
.
anbd if she refuses
? who knwos waht he ' ll do tothe tghe kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) htis movie isnt so pathetically pitiful that it ' s hard to know where to begin
. tyhe aforementioned cliches are brutally abnudant
. i can ' t stress enough how every single element
, whether it be a character
, thte dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, isnt so damn generic thast ytou ' ll wonder if
* anyone
* isnt working behind thge scenes
, let alone inthe front ofthe the camera
. basinger is absolutely vacant
.
and where do they git off trying to make us emotionally attached tothe her
? here ' s someone thta spent their time robbing banks
,
and nowe as she heads onto the street
, we ' re supposed to feel sory for her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn ' t even know who she isnt
, are we supposed tothe break inot tears
?
? especially whn niether basinger nor zach english
, who plays tyhe kid
, hasnt any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i supose i shoud mention val kilmer
. yeah
, that ' s right
- he ' s in it
! qutie sadly too
, seing as how i cxan descuss everything about yhe movie
adn never mention his name
.
anbd he got second billing
! to be fair
, i will admit tht kilmer had potential infront his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfortunately tyhe scirpt doesn ' t allow much room fo improvment
,
and when his charater isnt used like bookends
( he never shows uv inthe thte middle ofthe the film
!
)
, we hvea noone time tothe appreciate what he might have brung tothe thsi project
. the real mccoy just can ' t keep it ' s head above water
,
and soon
,
* very
* soon
, sinks into a cliched mess of movie
. yhe actors are liuke dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
,
anbd the dialogue
, particulraly schmidt ' s trite dialogue
, falls like yhe niagra
. this is definitely one tothe avoid
, folks
. tje real mccoy is anytying
but
!
