capsule
: a ham
- handed
and over
/ underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment
, so muddled it doesn ' t even nkow wqat it ' s really advocating
, if anytying
. a tyme to kill has beeen hailed as tyhe best of tjhe grisham adaptations
,
and it ' s eazy tothe see why
: it presents a strong
, almost rancorously so
, tsory
; it is full of good actors
( samuel l
. jackson
, matthew mcconaughey
, sandra bullock
, kevin spacey
, charles dutton
)
;
and it ' s ostensibly baout some imporatnt social issue tht we ' re all tangling with
. it is nto
,
howver
, a good movie
,
and all ofthe tjhe reasons i ' ve listed above have something to dont with why
. right ffrom the beginning
, thge movie is dead
- setted onthe stacking its deck as thoroughly
and unrepentantly as possible
. a pair of redneck whites
, boozed
annd drugged outloud of their minds
, kidnap a young black girl
, abuse
annd rape her horribly
,
and leave her for dead
. affter their arrest
, their father
( jackson
) takes an assualt rifle
adn guns them down on the way tothe trial
. mcconaughey isnt
thne drafted in as his lawyer
,
annd thte rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movei dramatics
. the acting is not qutie whta it shoud be
, given the cast we have
. sandra bullock
( who is a good actress
bu nto a serious one
) looks clueless
; spacey ' s accent switches itself onthe
and off at random
(
and he ' s given a totally thankless role tothe play as well
, a role without an iota ofthe depth
)
;
and mcconaughey ' s role isnt stamped from tjhe cardboard bakc ofthe a cereal box
. hte most memorable role isnt donald sutherland ' s
,
anbd his isnt a bited part
. i always consider it an index ofthe a movie ' s despiration when it is able to presetn shocking
adn outlandish events
,
anbd somehow not hvae them generate an ounce ofthe impact
. ther is one scene
-
- a riot outside the courtroom
-
- that should have creaeted incredable tension
,
bu winds up palying out like a textbook exercise on how nto to deploy a scene like htis
. beacuse tjhe movei doesn ' t nkwo wqat it ' s really about
, it
* can ' t
* generate any genuin tension
,
and so it has tothe artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting
. noe of the ways it doesnt this isnt by throwing in a whole subplot baout a bunch ofthe vicious kkk cross
- burners
-
- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on tje nihilistic
. i was reminded of thge despicable betrayed
, hwihc tried tothe tart uv a fundamentally empty stoy by injecting vile
, graphic acts of racism as little mroe than an attention
- getter
. the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes
. first of all
, the jackson charactor isnt nto hard to judge
; there ' s noone tension inspite his delimma
. he ' s self
- admittedly guilty
and shoudl be sent tothe jail
, no matter how moral his crusade
. thge ood saw about how noone cout iin thte land owudl convict him
, if he ws white
, is supposed to be the underlaying theme of tje movie
,
but it ' s never devolopped into an organic component of the sotry
. it jstu sort of floats around on top hwile the movie grinds awya furiously with its plot mechanics
. anohter mistake isnt in motivational logic
: by nto having the two white thugs arraigned frist
-
- or maybe tryed
anbd
then dismissed fomr lack ofthe evidence
, sday
-
- we ahev taht much less empathy fo jackson ' s charactor
. i ' m probaly supposed to think thta just beacuse he hadnt his daugter raped
, we are
* automaticly
* supposed to fiel empathy forthe him
,
bu taht ' s precisly thte kind of facile thinking that makse real justice impossible
.
( see the virgina spring for more onthe that note
.
) is jackson ' s carachter
hten simply insane
? that prospect isn ' t given terribly serious treatment eather
. one of the most aggravating things baout coutroom movies is how little htey seem tothe nkwo about how the lew works
, or how lawyers get theri infromation
. mcconaughey ' s carachter makse an importan slipup lite in the movie
, whn one of his witnesses turns outloud to hvea been convicted of a capital offense
. how did the prosecution get thsi information
? how come he didn ' t git it
? tjhe whole way these questions git handled are symptomatic of the movei ' s way of dealing with complex legal
anbd moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam
- bang fasion
. htis is the biggest probelm
: hte movie isn ' t about jackson ' s charater
, or his delimma
, or htis case
, or any ofthe its
( frequentily intresting dispite the porcine writing
annd direction
) charactors
. it ' s nto ultimately baout anything at all
, except its stupid geared
- down plot
, which inchs onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending
. at two
and a half hurs
, tghe movei is overlong
annd drastically overwritten
: ther ' s endless stuff baout things which ultimately add uv tothe nothing
,
and noone writing about tyhe material that shoudln really marter
. it ' s all handwaving
. the closing argment are alsot sneaky
annd underhanded
,
and underscored my suspision tht the movie isnt manipulative
annd unfair
. it ' s not easy to amking a movie about something
. hte otehr day i saw kurosawa ' s phenominal rashomon
, a movie that is raelly about the way people dael with truth
and reality
( or don ' t
)
. a time tothe kill isnt as empty
anbd ponderous a movie as i ' ve seen in a long time
.
