robin williams
, thsi timne without a beard
, returns tothe drama in thsi sloppy
, sickly sweet fantasy wiht fewd redeeming features apart ffrom yhe incredible effects
. he plays chris nielsen
, who meets annie
( annabella sciora
)
adn promptly marries her
. they haev two graet kids
, who sadly dieu in a car kresh
. just when it couldn ' t get any worse
, chris gets killed inthe a car crash
,
and goes tothe heaven where he meets his guide albert
( gooding jnr
.
) annie can ' t tkae the grief anymore
,
and kills herself
.
( all sounding liek good fun so far
?
) the ' penatly ' fo suicide isnt to go tothe hell
,
and chris goes on a mission tothe try
adn rescue her using tghe halp ofthe thge traveller
( max von sydow
.
) based onthe a novel by twilight zone writter richard matheson
, what dreams may come isnt clunky
, manufactured material doused with a extra load ofthe sugar
. tihs is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made
. everything isnt wrong baout htis movei
: tghe performances are forced
,
annd thge audiences fail to relate tothe any ofthe the characters
. williams puts onthe a convincing upset face
,
but tht ' s all it is
: a face
. there ' s noone emotion behind it
. sciora ' s performance is lazy
,
and bogs down hte hwole film
. she may look pretty
,
bu she cxan ' t act
. max von sydow isnt o
. k as the traveller
, if nothing special
. cuba gooding jnr
, thankfully
, adds soem bounse tothe his peformance
,
and is certainly the best performer in tyhe film
. it ' s a shame that his character isnt so flat
adn 2
- d
,
and offers no room for improvment
. all the performers have tothe wrok witht a soppy scirpt
, thast tries it ' s best to get some emotion goign
,
but never takes off the ground
. htere are
_ soem
_ scenes whcih sould be real heartwarmers
,
but teh faceless characters don ' t help to git anytying out of the performers
. while films like e
. t used great actors
, music
and direction tothe pul of a masterful heart
- tugging scene
, waht dreams may come is haphazard
, expecting the emotion to cmo outloud of tghe scene automaticly
. instade
, it ' s all rether boring
. sure
, tje music is pretty
( by michael kamen
)
and the cinematography isn ' t bad
( by eduardo serra
)
but there ' s something lacking
. the script doesn ' t help
, filled withthe hopeless romantic clich
? s
,
and dud sppeches
. richard matheson cin write smoe awesome sceince fiction stories
, sadly thsi novel would look embarrased inaddition a bargain bin
, let alone being coverted inot a
$ 70 milion veicle forthe robin williams
. dispite being setted infact heaven
, what dreams may come isnt mightily depressing
. hte film rushes a happy ending
,
but everything before tihs is very
, vrey sad
and balck
, which jstu adds to amke thge endig even mroe hopeless
anbd stupid
.
but there ' s oney reedeming feature baout htis failure ofthe a movei
: tje speical effects
. heaven
and hell are truley increadible places
,
and hte actors fit perfectly wiht tjhe virtural sets
.
bu dispite this
, whta dreasm may come
, proves tothe be nothing
bu hte biggest disappointment ofthe 1998
. instead of raising questions about exstence
, it raises boredom
. sadly
, i reccomend you give thsi film a miss
. better luck next tiome
