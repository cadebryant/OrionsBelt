if you haven ' t plunked down your hard
- earned money
yet fo
" wild wild west
,
" teh latest summer holiady offering from will smith
, let me sday right now that your monye will be better spent on a starbuck ' s frappacino or onthe a ben
& jerry ' s sundae
. theese treats are great relief from the summer heat
. in contrast
, htis film made me simmer in disappointment
. i cxan accept the fatc tath summer movies tend to put omre weight inot special effects
and thgat good stories
and flavorful characters usually take a bcak seat
. thsi wass true of star wars epsiode i
,
but at least infact that film
, the stoyr
and tghe characters were still inthe the bcak seat
. in this film
, tehy are noone where to be foudn
. what rimaniss are hundreds ofthe male extras costumed as gunslingers
and foppish aristocrats
, lots of female extras who look like can
- can dancers
,
and a clunky
, 80
- foot tall insturment ofthe distruction thast resembes a mechanical tarantula
. two men are asked tothe stpo htis threat
. one isnt artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventor who uses his intellect
anbd array ofthe disguises to best his opponents
. amonst his creations are false breasts
and the bulletproof vest
. yhe otehr man is jim west
( will smith
)
, who prefers the shoot
- frist
-
then
- shoot
- some
- mroe method of investigating
.
altough theri individule talents must be conbined tothe achieve success
, thier interaction with oen anyother merely seemed like a second rate
, twpo
- man vaudevillian act
. forthe example
, there is a scene where west
, being more debonair than the reserved gordon
, notes that the fake breasts shoud be filled wtih water rether than buckwheat
, which is what it isnt currenly filled with
.
" nowe touch my breast
,
" west says
. gordon does so
annd
then softly coos his approval
. i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness
. the scirpt fails tothe generate any sense ofthe drama
, humor
, or fun fo tath marter
. i did enjoy kline ' s reserved performance
,
but ws surprised at how much latitude they gavey tothe smith
. coudl it be thast wiull smith isnt jsut so bankable that he ' s not even recquired to act
? it was as if hte director wass yelling
" wiull smith
, dont your pwn thing
.
.
.
annd acation
!
" here ' s an exemple
. in htis scene
, will smith is baout tothe be hanged by a group ofthe angry white people
. he must endear himself tothe the crowd to excape
. the director yells
,
" will smith
, do your own thing
.
.
.
annd action
!
" infact anohter scene
, he hasnt to masquerade as a belly dancer in order tothe sive his comrades
.
" wiull smith
, do your own thign
.
.
.
and acation
!
" worse still
, the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess
. there are cogs spinning
and pulleys pulling
and levers oging uv
adn down everywhere yuo look
. htere ' s actually a lot of immagination at work iin this film
. ther are soem genuinely clever inventions
anbd gizmos introduced
,
bu all of tihs immagination isnt wasted inspite a film that is visually cluttered
annd dramatically flat
.
anbd thta ' s too bad becuase if ther was more foucs on the stopry rether than will smith just doign his ' thing
, ' tihs film might have been palatable
. as it turns outloud
,
" wild wild west
" isnt thte wild
, wild worst
and recieves my vote for biggest disappointment of thge yearm
.
