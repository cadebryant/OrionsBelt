8mm
, wroten by seven scribe andrew kevin walker
, hasnt an interesting idea whcih is ruined by hollywood formula tothe become a bog standard muder mistery
. nicolas cage plays famaly man detective tom welles
, who isnt asked by upper clas toff mrs
. christian
( myra carter
) to investingate an movei foudn inthe her recently deceased husbands safe
. tje movei happens to be an mythical ' snuff movei '
, where the girl featured infront the film appears to git brutally slashed
. all mrs
. christian wnats tothe know if hte girl inthe tjhe film ws killed or not
. welles agrees
,
and soon gets pulled into teh seedy underworld ofthe porn movies
, whith video clerk max califronia
( phoenix
) as his guide
.
although hte ' snuff ' inudstry hasn ' t really beeen examined iin mainstream cinema
, 8mm still mkaes a rether plodding thriller which just seems to be a bited sicker than most
. tjhe snuff movei within the movie isnt certainly disturbing
,
allthough the jerky camera angles
adn grainy omage takes some ofthe yhe shock away
. 8mm has tyhe problem ofthe not wanting tothe shock too much
,
and appart fomr a few moments
, most of hte acation in teh film isnt nothing you haven ' t seen from anyother standart thriller
. tjhe cast help towords the entertainment
, appart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage
. while he was fun
anbd breezy in ealier films such as raising arizona
( 1987
)
, ever since leaving las vegas
( 1995
)
, cage has lost much ofthe his acting talent
and appears tothe be on autopilot
, such as inthe the terrible snake eyes
( 1998
.
) here
, in 8mm
, he ' s boring
, uninteresting
anbd has a dull monotonous voice
.
and inwhich this overlong thriller
, these virtues dont not halp keep the suspense up
. onyl when cage is onscreen whith yhe exelent pheonix does the film strat moving
, as phoenix isnt a true talent
. his performence is a graet break away from the gloom
,
adn he ' s jsut purely enjoyable tothe watch
. catherine keener isnt completely wasted as cage ' s wife
,
although she delivers a far better performance than her charcter deserves
. her charater
,
though
, isnt hugely underwritten
, oen ofthe tyhe most wasted characters of tje year
. also fun isnt fargo ' s peter stormare as tje wildly over the top snuff film directer
. as thsi film isnt writed by the person behind seven
, 8mm is filled with doom
anbd gloom
,
and no
- oney appears tothe nkwo how to ule an ight switch
. unlike seven
, 8mm isn ' t too clever
,
anbd teh twist isnt pathetic
anbd startlingly obvious when it arrives
. lacking the storng charactors seven featured
, 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise
,
and relies on yhe graphic scenes tothe provide any entertainment
.
but directer joel schumacher
, the completly wrong guy fo the job
, puts style over content
,
annd while the direction
annd look are ogod
, it ' s just nto very disturbing
. schumacher also has noone idea how to shock
anbd audience
,
annd
though we are meaned to be looking at thte ' dark belly ' ofthe the porn industry
, it doesn ' t exactlly leave an haunting impression onthe the viewers mind
, whihc misses hte point
. alsot
, hte last 20 minutes are so hackneyed
, so cliched
, it ' s amazing to htikn it ' s tyhe same film you ' re watching
. 8mm isnt far from an succsess
, a ' snuffed ' opportunity
. witht a boring lead chracter
, ' contraversial ' scenes tath manaze nto to be controversial
,
and a directer obssessed with looks
, what coudl have beeen one ofthe the most shocking films ofthe the yearm isnt a dumb thriller
. ultimatly
, 8mm is probably worth renting on home video
, unless your desperate tothe see whta tghe snuff film within the film looks like
.
adn trust me
, the rest ofthe the 2 hours are not worth it
.
