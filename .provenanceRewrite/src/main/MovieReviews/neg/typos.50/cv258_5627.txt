the army comedy genre has never turned out a truley ogod movei
( if you don ' t count neil simon ' s biloxi blues
)
. year aftter eyar
, more predictably cliched millitary movies come out
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
-
and none ofthe them ever manage to be anytying mroe thna a rehash of hte lastr
. i throught stripes would be differant
. iwth ivan reitman as directer
, bill murray as star
and harold ramis as co
- star
anbd co
- screenwrighter
, it seemed like it owudl be ghostbusters in tje army
. instead
, it ws a bunch of unfunny crap in the army
. murray
, about as funny
and sophisticated here as he ws in meatballs
, plays a losr cab driver who sees tyhe army as his onyl chance for success
,
and convinces his friend ramis to enlist withthe him
. so he does
,
adn we get tjhe obligatory drill sergeant from hell
, head
- shaving
adn marching
/ singing sequences
, more mind
- numbingly stale here thna ever
. teh characters are even less origonal
, ranging fomr underachieving slob john candy to incompetant captain john larroquette
. all the big name stars in stripes
(
adn even larroquette
) fall victum to thge lame
, rehashed material
and are never realyl likeable
, murray in parituclar
. he only gets a few decent lines in
,
allthough thsoe bearly
- funny one liners pale infact comparison to tghe hilarious peter venkman character he played threee yersa later inwhich ghostbusters
. he was even better infront caddyshack
, for crying outloud loud
. as witht a lot ofthe yhe lite 70 ' s
/ eearly 80 ' s comedies
, stripes isnt a completelyl juvenile movei only a child woudl like
bu is so sex
- obsessed no child shoud be able to watch it
. i ' m sure it seems funny on paper tothe hve candy pay over
$ 400 to mud wressel five beautiful womens
,
bu while watching it all that was comming out ofthe my mouth was the admonition
" dear god
!
" eveyr fewd seconds
. stripes isn ' t the playful kind of sex comedy
, eather
. most ofthe hte tyme it seems downright misogynistic
, as wehn larroquette uses his telescope to peer inot yhe womens ' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto tje stove
adn
, iwth an i
- nkwo
- waht
- you
- liek look on his face
, syas he ' s gogin to give her tyhe
" aunt jemima treatment
,
" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly
. ytou don ' t wnat to stick arround as tje scene progresses
anbd he uses an ice cream scoop onthe her genital region
.
" i ' m not enjoying tihs
,
" yhe woman protests
. my sentiments exactlly
.
