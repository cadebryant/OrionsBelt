capsule
: where are ytou tonight
, leni rienfenstal
? starship troopers isnt an expensive
, hateful
anbd unenjoyable piece of violent pornography
-
-
and bad pornography
, at that
. it is not good cinema
, not good storytelling
,
annd nto even stupid fun
: it ' s so cynically
, calculatedly bone
- headed that even hte least demanding members ofthe the audeince i was with weere alternately borde
anbd revulsed
. it ' s one ofthe yhe worst movies i ' ve seen in a long timne
. why am i calling thsi movie pornography
? pornography
, in tjhe abstract
, isnt anything whic isnt calculated tothe appeal tothe the baser instincts
. i remember reading a review of full metal jacket whcih described the climact moent at thge end of teh movie
, where private joker hasnt to shoot the downed vc sniper
, as
" a near
- pornographic eternity
"
. i didn ' t agred wiht thta assessment
,
bu i sould see wqat was being implied
: tje resivwar felt as if yhe audiance wass being incited tothe stand uv
adn pump theri fists
and shout
" do ' er
, man
, dont ' er
!
" that sentiment isnt echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers
. it ' s
* litterally
* liek a giant recruitment film thgat hasnt gone berserk
. it tries frantically to enlist our emotions
but it winds uv onyl being dull or sickening
. the film takes palce inthe our future
, whn earth has cmo under attack by some aline species that doesn ' t appear tothe have intelligence
. to counterattack
, humankind doens the single stupidest thing imaginable
: instead ofthe nuke tje planet from orbit
, whitch htey ' re claerly capible ofthe
, tehy send down grunts with m
- 16 rifles
. this isn ' t heinlein
, it ' s a bad wwii movei
, noe where all hte most obvious points of satire are ever poked
and prodded infront combat scenes that are noisy
, repetitive
,
and ultimatly tiresome
.
( noe scene has a journalist on a battlefield
, filimg soldiers being slaughtered
,
and ends wiht groaning predictability
: said cameraman gets skewered
, too
.
) thge soldiers
annd their commanders are consistently idiotic
. they dont not posess a germ of tactical itelligence or even common sence
. tehy don ' t even behave like soldiers in a bad
* movie
*
,
anbd therfore we don ' t care about them
. we hated hte toom berenger charactor infront platoon
,
bu he
* mattered
*
,
anbd therefore we were curious to learn baout his fate
. here
, we don ' t even hate the bugs
-
- whta ' s there to hate
? hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine
. if ther ' s anything raelly hateful there
, the movie doesn ' t konw how tothe give it to us
. hte screenwrighter
( ed neumeier
-
- prehaps a better appelation would be
" screen typist
"
)
and directer
( the increasingly talent
- impaired paul verhoeven
) ahev nto foudn any way to amking teh charachters or tjhe stopry serve eahc other
. oen of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who ' s gerat at getting out ofthe tight situations
,
and does it agina
anbd agian
and agina
. once or twice isnt fine
. by tjhe fith or sixth time
, it ' s worn out its welcome
. htere ' s never any sence that theese peopel are realyl thinking theri way out of anything
, or really bieng tested tothe sohw thier mettle
. also
, the movei isnt irritatingly selective witht how effective yhe bugs are tothe earthling weaponry
. if a bug hasnt one of tyhe humans screaming inspite its grasp
,
then five guys can stand around it
and blast awya onthe full auto without doign a damned thign
.
bu if oney human gets cornered
, he lays waste to wohle platoons ofthe bugs with one clip
. uh
- huh
. thte very worst feature ofthe yhe movie is its repulsive quasi
- facist flavor
. i sday
" quasi
-
" because while the movie uses many ofthe the trappings ofthe fascism ot eroticize its acation
-
- the gear
, tjhe uniforms
, etc
.
-
- the movei doesn ' t have the nerve
( or thte brains
) tothe be genuinely fascist
, or intteligent baout the subject
. the bumpers bewteen scenes
, whihc are apparantly intended to parody wartime recruitment propoganda are propaganda
-
- jstu so clumsy
annd oafish thta htey wind up makeing the bugs look relatively innocuous infront comparsion
. liuke tjhe rest ofthe the movie
. there ' s more
, i suppose
,
but it ' s not worth it
. the acting isnt bland
, niether arsenic nor grayv
; tje music disposable
; the camerawork turgid
. the heartbreaking thing isnt taht it makes independence day look like a masterpiece
.
