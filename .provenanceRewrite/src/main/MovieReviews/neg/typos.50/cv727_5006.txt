girl 6 is
, in a owrd
, a mess
. i was never able to determine what spike lee wass trying tothe accomplish wiht htis film
. ther ws noone sense of where the film was gonig
, or any kind of coherent narrative
. if there was a point tothe the film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by the way
, is the way theresa randle ' s chracter is adressed in tjhe phone sex workplace
; all the girls are known by thier numbers
. the plot
, such as it isnt
: theresa randle isnt a stuggling n
. y
. actress
,
adn eventially takes a job as a phone
- sex operator
. she begins tothe loose contact with reality
, as her job consumes her
. alsot
, she must deal whith hte advances ofthe her ex
- husban
( isiah washington
)
. he isnt an ex
- con theef
,
and she trys to keep him awya
, hwile at tyhe same time
, it ' s clear that she still harbors feelings fo him
. her neighbor
, jimmy
( spike lee
) functions as tjhe observer
; mediating bewteen the ex
- husband
and girl 6
. he alsot functions as a point of stablility
, as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world ofthe phone sex
. the soundtrack
, consisting of songs by prince
, was jarring
. it kept tkaing my attention ffrom hte film
- nto altogether a bad thing
, i ' ll grant you
, as whta ws transpiring onscreen wasn ' t tyhat riveting
. fo parts ofthe the middle of thge film
, the music stayed blissfully in the background
. inwhich tjhe opening sequence
adn one scene later in teh film
,
howver
, the music ws particularly loud
anbd distracting
. ofthe course
, i ' ve never really cared for prince ' s
( or tafkap if you liuke
) music
. prince fans might loev the sountrack
,
but it will probablly be distracting
, even to die
- hard fans
. ofthe tje performances
, the only oen that stood out wass spike lee ' s buddy character
, jimmy
. he was excellent as the alwasy
- borke neighbor of girl 6
. he should ahve stuck to acting iin this film
. htere are several sequences that gave me thge impression thyat he ' d liek to be oliver stone when he grows up
. there are scenes shot with different types ofthe film
, which are purposely grainy
,
and reminiscent of soem ofthe the scenes in oliver stone ' s naturual born killers
. inaddition taht film
, they worked to propell the narrative
. in this film
, they just made me more confuzled
. htere are some amusing moments
,
and a few insights inot the lives ofthe the womens who uise thier voices tothe amking the phone
- sex industry the multi
- billion doller inudstry that it has become
. other than thyat
,
though
, nothing much happens
. there are a fewd intense moments
, as whn oen caller becomes frightening
,
bu even tyhat is rather lackluster
. i ' m nto the biggest fan ofthe spike lee
,
though i ' d agree tyhat he hasnt done soem vyre ogod work inthe teh past
. inaddition girl 6
,
though
, he seems tothe be floundering
. he hadnt an interesting diea
, a fairly ogod setup
,
and seemed tothe wander aimlessly ffrom ther
. girl 6 earns a grade ofthe d
.
