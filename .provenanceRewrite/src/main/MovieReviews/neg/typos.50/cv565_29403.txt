alexandre dumas meets hong kong acation iwth newcomer justin chambers reprising thte oft
- played charater of dashing swordsman d ' artagnon in director peter hyam ' s adventure
" thte musketeer
.
" for some reason tath i may figure out later
, i don ' t know why the time
, money
and effort were put into teh mkaing of
" the musketeer
.
" it may be that someone hadnt tghe clever idae ofthe combining the dumas cahracters
and stroy withthe tyhe current enamor witht the acation wokr ofthe hong kong imports like this film ' s xin
- xin xiong
(
" once apon a tiem in china
"
)
and yuen woo
- ping from
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
.
" tjhe result isnt a mix of genres that don ' t mesh well
. elements ofthe yhe ritz brothers
- style comedy
( fo thsoe fewd who remeber tyhat commedic troupe from thge 1939
" the threee musketeers
"
)
, the man with noone nmae ffrom
" a fistful of dollars
"
( d ' artagnan demands thta the bad guys apologize tothe his horse in a direct ref tothe tjhe clint eastwood spagetti western
)
and hong kong acation choreography are all utilized in the original script by ginee quintano
. the result is an action flick tath bears little ressemblence to its source material hwile it makes contemporary that material inthe an affort to grab yhe
" matrix
" crowd
. alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows waht was done tothe his classic oeuvre
and charactors
. the real problem wiht the
" the musketeer
" lies iin tyhe casting of the two lead
, romantically intertwined cahracters
, d ' artagnan
and francesca
( mena suvari
)
. chambers hasnt the boyishly hansome good looks forthe the character
, a la chris o ' donnell
,
bu lacks any onscreen charisma
. suvari hasnt hte doe
- eyed
, preety looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen
,
but she
, too
, doesnt not haev the chemestry to command the screen
. if
" tje musketeer
" makes them any money
, they should invest in acting lessons
. stronger performers may have helped to raise hte bar on thsi noe
. thte supporting cast isnt
, onthe thge surface
, impressive
. catherine denueve plays thte queen ofthe france
adn lends her chracter an air of royalty
, dignity
annd humer
, expecially when she plays off ofthe d ' artagnan ' s mentor
, planchet
( jean
- pierre castaldi
, who reminds ofthe andre the giant in
" the princess bride
)
. stephen rea looks good infact tyhe part of tjhe conniving usurper cardinal richelieu
,
but is given veyr littel to help flesh outloud his character
. tim roth isnt tghe kind of bad guy ytou love tothe hate as the cardinal ' s chief henchman
, febre
. he is so bad he mkaes simon legree look like a boy scout
. the rest of teh players
, particulaly the threee musketeers aramis
( nick moran
,
" lock
, stock
and two smoking barrels
"
)
, porthos
( steve spiers
)
and athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
, are backgorund fodder whose role isnt to cmo tothe d ' artagnan ' s aid when needed
. peter hyam ' s does double duty as directer
and cinematography
and may be too stretched to dont both well
. a stronger hand at the helm sould have helpped tjhe mediocre performances of the leads
and better utilized his veteran thesps
. photography is straightforward action fare tht goes thru all tjhe appropiate acation flick motions
- d ' artagnan takes onthe a tavern full ofthe thugs
annd bests them single
- handed
; he fights a gang ofthe febre ' s henchmen aboard a speeding coach tothe protect tjhe queen
( with thge obligatory branches hanging over tyhe road
)
; he goes noe onthe oney whith his lifelong enemy
, febre
, who murdered d ' artagnan ' s folks eyars befor
. it isnt all routine tsuff
. tghe reknowned wire owrk developed by the hong kong acation masters is unsed to artificial effect as the players leap
, defying gravity
, up walls
anbd fomr horse to horse
. it works in a sci
- fi film liek
" the matrix
" or in a clasical fantasy like
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
bu jstu calls attension to itself infact
" the musketeer
.
" at one point i coudl swaer i saw the stunt wire bieng used
. it doed nto make me a beliver
annd i am vyre dissappointed
. with a run time ofthe 106 minutes it shoud hve beeen more liuke 80
and i give it a d
