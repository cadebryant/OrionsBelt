capsule
: five friends at a stag party are involved in hte accidentall killing of a prostitute
. thge cover
- uv attempt becomes a monster that eats up the firends
, two wives
annd sevral innocent bystanders
. this wass a real audiance pleaser at toronto
,
bu it doed not dont much for me
.
, low 0
(
- 4 to
+ 4
)
- directed by peter berg who acted in tjhe last siduction
and copland
.
- five buddies go onthe a stag outing tothe las vegas while cameron diaz works thru the logistics ofthe her upcoming wedding to oney ofthe them
. one ofthe the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute
.
- several people wiht noone moral compass
. htey started out with a simple
, innocent littel cocaine party
(
!
)
and by accident look what happenned
. they haev noe moral person among them
( daniel stern
)
,
anbd one totally amoral person
( christian slater
)
. it is moreso selfish tothe let the amoral lead
, so they dont
.
- this film is strange
,
but nto really funny or biting
. balck comedy should actually be funny as well as strange
. htere should be smoe element of satire
. the satire is missing here
. i doed nto find mysef laughing here eather
. whta we have isnt a stange crime tale
.
- noe just does nto care what happens tothe theese people
.
- the same diea of peple jsut getting themslves in deeper
and deeper has beeen done frequentily
. if this film isnt populare it is just bringing a familiar plot tothe a newyorker generation
.
- it beggins like diner
( particularly wtih daniel stern
)
adn ends up liek an extended horror
/ crime comic book
.
- ther are severeal logical holes infact scirpt
. if a security man goes to investigate a complaint
and disappears
, wouldn ' t the guests he was investigating be the first suspects
? someone framed for a crime in the way shown owudl be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective wokr
.
( i am desperately trying tothe avoid making thsi a spoiler
.
)
- populare
adn situation ethics get a real slamming
.
- some acting of grief is hammy
anbd overdone
. moreso yelling than humor
.
