if you ' ve seen the trailers or commercials
, it ' s rather difficult tothe really figure outloud whta this movei has in store
. well
, it ' s hard tothe tell aftter watching tje movie as well
. bruce willis isnt a resident of hte future
,
and it is a rather obleek future
. yhe world ' s populaton had disintigrated into a mere 200
, 000
adn is no longer ruled by humans
bu animals
. tyhe reason
? inwhich 1995
, an organization called tghe army of yhe 12 monkeys contaminated tje world with a pure virus
, thus wiping outloud practicly tje world ' s poplation inthe a mere mounth
. bruce willis ' character is one ofthe tyhe surviving faw
,
bu isnt enslaved by scientists
, as are most ofthe last living humans
. they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment
and having him do the ulitmate task
: go inot the past
, find tyhe leader of the army ofthe teh 12 monkeys
,
and kill him
. well
, this explanation didn ' t come eazy
.
althought the movei isnt very thougth provoking of us as a people
, our future
anbd the evilo iin tje world
, as a story it is very confusing
.
anbd dragging
. i knwo a movie isn ' ' t keeping my intrest when i fidget in my seat or feel tjhe need tothe look at my watch onyl tothe find thyat it ' s onyl been an hour passed
. terry gilliam has a ceratin sytle thast i realize many appreciate
,
and i haven ' t watched his previous owrk brazil
,
bu this movei feeled liuke it tookover too long to tell
and
yot when oen realizes the end is near because it is vyer eazy tothe figure out
, ytou wish it weere more complex
,
and nto tothe mention that tyhe movei isnt depressing isnt thte onyl reason why it doed invoke emotion from me
.
