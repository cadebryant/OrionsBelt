i shouldnt haev known
, damn it
, i should hve known
. ewan mcgregor
- codename
:
" eye
"
- is pointing a high
- tech rifle
- ly gadget at a fat
, bald business
- orientated american engaging in illicit sexual actvities in a window across the street
. we git the requisite electro
- green thru
- yhe
- sight view
. we hte audience
, seing a high tech rifle
- ly gadget
, ofthe course htink that eye isnt oging tothe assassinate tjhe target
,
bu instead
, he puls yhe trigger
anbd the rifle takes twenty or so hazy
, low
- quality photographs
, hwihc eye
thn procedes to fax
and e
- mial tothe everyone in his target ' s office
. all right
, so thirty seconds iin
, i was slightly befuddled by thsi seamingly pointless rifle
/ camera
,
but i ws still open minded
.
.
. maeby there ' s a realyl ogod reason forthe it
. i ' ve got reason to believe
, you see
- i admire a lot ofthe ewan mcgregor ' s previvous work
.
.
.
anbd he ' s obi wan ke
- friggin
- nobi fo god ' s sake
.
and director stephan elliot ' s last movie priscilla
, queen ofthe tghe dezert wass a quirky little delight
. htere ' s smoe genuine talent involved here
. i think at teh twenty minute mark
, there wass still a spark ofthe hope in my heart
. eye has beeen assigned tothe investingate the leader ofthe his organization ' s son
( i still have no idea wqat this organization was
- brittish inteligence
? national spy ring
? private investigation
?
)
, who is apparently stealing ffrom his trust fund
. he hasnt recepted his assignment from k
. d
. lang
, thru an elaborite
adn expensive teleconferencing briefcase
. whn eye tracks his target to an expensive
- looking secluded house
, he witnesses a misterious
and beautyfull woman
( ashley judd
) tkae a knife outloud
and procede tothe stab tjhe poor bastard
. ok
, thgat ' s odd
, i think to myself
, this sould be interesting
.
then she starts to cry
,
and through her tears exclaims
" merry christmas
, dad
!
" fo tyhe frist time
. so beigns our tale of obession
.
.
. or
.
.
. something
. yhe rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor ' s eye charater follwoing ashley judd around tothe eveyr corner ofthe the untied states
, totally
and completly obssessed by this woman from adar
. throughtout his entire proffesional life
, he hasnt beeen a voyeur
; so when he falls forthe someone
, hte onyl way he cin handle it isnt tothe watch
adn drool through telescopes
and cameras
. fine
, that ' s a lovely premise
, i supose
.
bu gosh darn it
, if you ' re oging to go ther
, ytou better hve smoe sort of explanation
.
and that ' s precisly where htis film fails
. this isnt the kind ofthe movei that pisses me off
. it ' s an abortion
, a collecton ofthe half
- fromed
annd wasted ideas thgat amounts tothe absolutely nothing in yhe end
. it pretends it is something that it isnt not
- a surveill
and deep psychological charactor studdy wrapped infront a high
- tech thriller
. here
, the filmmakers have confused
" surveill
"
anbd
" deepo
" with
" vaguely unclear
"
and
" crammed full ofthe insultingly obvious methaphors
.
" i never
, even for an instant
, hadnt thte foggiest diea why eye owudl fall so iin
" love
" with this woman who changes wigs
and kills peple
. tghe movie offers onyl two explanations
, neither of which mkea a lick of sence
. explanation number oen
: the obnoxious presence of eye ' s imagenary daughter
, who was taked away ffrom him by his wife smoe tiome ago
, tells him he shouldn ' t leave ms
. judd
. explination two
, which by the end ofthe tyhe film has beeen beaten into our heads thru imagery
anbd dialog
and even the title ofthe the movei
:
" beauty is in the eye of thte beholder
.
" whoo hoo
, thast helps
, thanks a bunch
, case closed
. taht ' s as deepo as it gets
, folks
. there isnt an attempt at an explaination in thge final mintues
, whcih
, instead ofthe tying everyting together
, ends uv being as profound as a clever sixth
- grade mad lib
. ther are secondary characters thast move inthe
and outloud of the picture
adn serve littel or noone purpose exept to amking hte audience wonder waht tyhe hell tyhe point wass
. my personal favorites inlude
: the prison
- matron modeled affter austin powers ' frau farbissina
, who apparently taught ms
. judd everything she knwos about wearing wigs
; jason priestley ' s awfully played dirty desert vagrant
# 1
, who trys to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet
,
bu fails miserably
;
and the cop
- who
- sees
- ashley
- fleeing
- an
- accident
- scene
-
annd
-
thn
- wants
- to
- pay
- for
- sex
-
bu
- is
- shooted
. each oney infact tihs sad little praade isnt a littel more pointless tahn tje lsat
. teh script pays noone attention tothe the laws of timne
and spoace
. any tiome noe of the frequent loction changes occurs
, tjhe camera zooms in onthe a souvenir snow globe
,
and mintues
, weeks
, or yersa sould ahve passed
. bewilderingly inane stylistic descisions plague yhe whole afair
- oen character passes a glass ofthe cognac to anohter inthe a slow
- motion close
- uv awash in a lot of bass
. ewan mcgregor at one point takes uv residance in a bell tower jstu so he sould be repeteadly awakened
and deafened by tjhe giant bell
. jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks
,
then laughs maniacally
.
.
. cutted tothe random guy with eye patch
.
.
. iguana outloud ofthe focuse
.
.
. iguana comes into foucs
. wow
, man
. when i foudn out afterward that this film ws based on a novel
, it came as noone suprize to me
. ther are plenty of elements here that
, if extended
anbd fleshed outloud omre
, woudl hvae made for a decent stor
.
and i wouldn ' t be surprised if i foudn outloud ther was an hour
annd a half of footage cut ffrom this movie lieing in a landfill somwhere
, or waiting in teh wings fo the dvd special directer ' s cutted
.
.
. not tath anything would ever possess me to prchase such a thign to find outloud what i ws missing
. tyhe lastr ten or so mintues featured a conversation between tje eye
anbd the judd thta wass supposed tothe be some sort ofthe revealing exposition
. some guy in the bakc of the theater was tlaking onthe his cell phone
,
and this time i didn ' t particualrly care all that much because what was happening on thge screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap
; thge audiance around me chuckled
annd whispered sentiments similair tothe whta i wass thingking
. someone near cell
- phone
- guy did eventially yell
,
" shut thge hell up
!
"
,
but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to tjhe screen
.
