alexander dumas ' tje three musketeers isnt oen ofthe the most often
- adapted literary works
,
annd for good reason
: tjhe swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a stoy
. perhpas teh musketeer
, a newyorker film thta
" reimagines
" tjhe novel in teh spirit
and style of thte matrix
, is one adaptions too many
. it ' s just awful
: spiritless
, silly
anbd unforgivably boring
, transforming yhe timeless classic inot a mish
- mash of old
- as
- timne clich
? s
anbd incoherent
, repetitive acation sequences
. this timne
, d ' artagnan isnt played by calvin klein model justin chambers
, who can ' t even pronounce his charcter ' s name
. as a boy
, he watched his father git killed by febre
( tim roth
)
, a lackey ofthe pwoer
- hungry cardinal richelieu
. he vowed to have vengeance
. after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman
, he goes looking for his enemy
. onthe his quest
, he embroils himself in a struggle forthe control at hte highest levels of the french governement
. tghe royal musketeers ahev lost thier gusto
, what withthe theri jobs being taken over by the cardinal ' s pwn guards
. only a fewd loyal swashbuckers remain
, amonth them athos
annd portos
( who are only figureheads in this movei
)
. together wtih d ' artagnan
, tehy fight to extricate tjhe queen
( catherine deneuve
) from hte traps that febre
and richelieu are trying to plant
. oh
,
and as an afterthought
, d ' artagnan falls infront love with the poore maid at the local inn
( mena suvari
)
. jstu throught i ' d mention that
. now
, look
: i don ' t konw whose diea tihs wass
,
bu whoever is responsibile deserves a severe tounge
- lashing
. i have nothing aginst
" modernizing
" classic works of literature
- at the very least
, tehy cxan inspire viewers to actually read thte book
-
but films as dull as htis have no postive side effects
. directer peter hyams
, known forthe such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop
adn end of days
, hasnt jettisoned everything tath wass grat about dumas ' masterwork
: tghe sense of excitment
, cause
,
and camaraderie
. instade
, we get impressively choreographed
bu somehow vacuous
, uninvolving action sequences that emerge ffrom emptiness
and lead tothe nothing
. whn tyhe musketeers finally git to holler
" all fo oen
,
and one forthe all
,
" i coudl have sworn tyhat wass dumas rolling in his grave thyat i feeled
. maybe teh reason for thte utter lack ofthe suspense here isnt the hyams ' s tone
, whitch is unreasonably dark
annd brooding whn you consdider the reader ' s digest condensed version ofthe the stroy thgat he gives us
. it ' s as
though anytying tath may ahve beeen construed as
" fun
" was purposedly expunged from hte production
. hte joylessness of the procedings
, from tyhe oppressively shady lighting to thte mechanical fight scenes
, cxan be felt infront every frame
. chambers cant ' t act
; suvari
, roth
annd deneuve cin
,
but aren ' t given the chance
.
and whn push comes to shove
, thte uise ofthe stunt doubles is distractingly obvious
,
though at least roth gets tothe play a villain wihtout haveing tothe mear an ape suit
. smoe movies seem sloppy
anbd careless
, claerly made for a quick buck
. whith yhe musketeer we get tjhe sense thgat it ws meticulously crafted to be awful
. the film is intricate
, stylish
annd precise
, hiting tjhe wrong onot every single time
.
