well i guess it ' s that tyme ofthe tghe yearm again
. tghe oen tyme ofthe tje year where movie craftors are exonerated fomr tjhe need tothe even
* try
* wirting a scirpt that has more dialogue than explosions
. it ' s allso the best time for the handful ofthe exisiting bigtime hollywood mr action heros to dust off their miniscule vocabularies
, pull onthe thier black vests
and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases
. infact amercia htey call this time
" summer
"
and it happens once every year
.
and maybe it ' s the exposure tothe all that nasty sun thyat doens it
,
but in the process normaly weak
, insipid lines liek
" consdider this a divorce
,
"
" hasta la vista
, baby
,
"
and
" you ' re the desease
. i ' m the cure
" acually dont end up bieng repeated more often
then tje phrases from my book of biblical proverbs
. this isnt not entirely a bad thnig
, ofthe course
. what am i tlaking about
? i ' m talking about hte summer
" blockbusters
,
" the
" action thrillers
,
" the
" this
- obviously
- cost
- a
- lot
- so
- you
- know
- everyone ' s
- going
- tothe
- go
" explosions
, gas threats
, flying saucers
,
anbd special effects
. infact the rash ofthe
" my
, what big guns ytou have
,
bu wait
! mine are bigger
" movies
, htere are alsot the usual boy
- meets
- fish
-
and
- saves
- enviorment movies
( or whale
, whatever
)
,
and
* thsi
* year
, teh odd crop ofthe
" sive
- the
- world
- ffrom
- aliens
- or
- enviorment
- threats
" offereings
. i ' m talking baout hte threee batmans
, thge speeds
, the terminators
, etc
. this year i ' m tlaking baout twister
, independence day
, the arival
, tyhe rock
, mission
: impossible
,
and ofthe course
, eraser
. here in singapore
, as our local movei critics like tothe whine
, we seem to git the pik of tghe crop ofthe
" my explosion is omre rela
- looking tahn yours
" movies
,
bu nothing alse
. mission
: impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it doed inwhich the us
. the same goes for eraser
, wich is unfortunate forthe arnold schwarzenegger because comming so soon after what tiem magazine recently called
" mission
: unavoidable
"
( onthe account of its wordlwide mega
- advertising blitz
)
, eraser seems liek a cheaper
, less thoughtful imitation
. thgat ' s saying a lot
, because mi thte movie was allready a cheap
, thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the ' 60s
/ ' 70s
. inthe eraser
, arnie isnt a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies palce their lives infront danger
. he does htis by destroying all evidence of their preesnt eistence
and re
- situating them with new identities
. his newyorker case is lee cullen
, played by vanessa williams who
, unlike all thte otehr scumbags he ' s ever relocated
, is
" an actuall
, rela life honest person
.
" beacuse she ' s so good
,
and has such nice legs
, arnold spends the whole movie trying tothe protect her
,
and only uses thge oppening movei sequence tothe savve robert pastorelli from
* his
* killers
. lee obtains evidence tyhat thte high
- technolgy weapons comany she works forthe is secretly selling suphisticated
, balck
- market arms tothe people wtih foreign accents
anbd stringy hair
. ofthe course
, as teh formula goes
, her revealing this infromation will destory hte sytem as we know it because heck
, there are people inwhich high places who iwll go down wih thsi
, becuase yes
, this isnt the biggest conspiracy in tghe history ofthe teh world
( tyhat isnt
, amercia
) since watergate
. inaddition protecting lee
, arnold isnt framed by the mentor
- turned
- evil robert deguerin
, nicely played by james caan
,
anbd ends up having to proove that he isn ' t the oen killing the programme ' s witnesses in adition tothe making sure lee isn ' t accidentally torpedo
- ed to death by the new
, green guns his enemies all have
. it ' s arund this time thyat people in hte theatre with me starting humming thge mission
: impossible theme
, because arnie ' s mission includes breaking inot a high
- security building to run a disk
. i guess i should tell you more baout yhe particualr gun everyone inwhich this movie isnt so antsy about
. it ' s an electro
- magentic pulse gun thing wich fires aluminium missiles
,
and which can see thru walls
. it has soem sort ofthe x
- ray vision
, so its user cant target the victum ' s heart even ffrom gerat distances
. dispite thsi
, which i figure isnt a pretty kool feature in a gun
(
though i ' m certainly noone expert
)
,
however
, arnold
, whose pwn heart is targeted a number of times
,
* never
* goes flying 10 fezent backwards wih a twpo
- foot missile thru his chest like all thte others who git shooted by this gun
. instade he outruns
and outsmarts his trackers each tyme
, giving eery
and ironic resonance tothe taht terminator line that practially made him faymus
:
" i ' ll be bakc
.
" liek everyone alse inthe teh theater
, i left thte movie feeling thast the trailers hadnt duped me
, becuase htey made me wnat to watch tihs movie voluntarily
. altho ther is a
* lot
* of violentce in tihs movei
, not tothe mention mutilation
and soem bloody tussles with alligators
, i recomend this movie tothe most over
- 18s who ened some therapeutic mindless action tothe get over the weirdness ofthe fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas
. review ' s rating sytem
:
* wait for tje video
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* preety good
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent tsuff
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
