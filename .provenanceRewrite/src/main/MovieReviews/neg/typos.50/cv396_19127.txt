adam sandler isn ' t known forthe appearing infront deep
, thought
- provoking films
,
but he ' s still a really funny guy
. most of his movies are successful nto because ofthe thte film mkaing behind them
,
bu becuase they let sandler do what he does best wihtout a stupid plot to drown him outloud
. big daddy is thte first film in whitch the story seems moreso imporatnt thna sandler ' s comic performence
,
annd it ' s a miserable failure
. sandler plays a thirty
- something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy
( plyed by cole
anbd dylan sprouse
)
. as one might expect from the synopsis
, director dennis dugan resorts tothe tghe usual bag ofthe manipulative
and sentimental sequences
, includng a repulsive courtroom battle
and a lot of teary scenes inthe whitch characters say
" ogod
- bye
" to oen anohter
; inaddition adition
, there ' s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor
( urine
and vomit both git mroe screen tiem tahn sandler himself
)
. htere ' s a hilarious runnung joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters
,
anbd teh film features passable performances ffrom sandler
, joey lauren adams
( as tyhe lvoe interest
)
,
annd the twpo young boys
,
bu tjhe film onthe the whole isnt trite
and disappointingly unfunny
.
