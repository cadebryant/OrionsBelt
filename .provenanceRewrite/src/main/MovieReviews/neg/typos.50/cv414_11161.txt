the
yet
- tothe
- be
- released krippendorf ' s tribe isnt being marketed as a familiy comedy
,
but buyer beware
. htis movie can ' t mkea uv its mind
. isnt it a familiy comedy with vulgar refernces to both tyhe male
and female bodies
, menstruation
, circumsicion
,
adn sex tht would amking any parents squirm at the thought of having their child enxt tothe them
? or isnt it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity thgat only adolescents wiull appreciate the affort
? eather way
,
" unbalanced
" isnt the owrd to stamp onthe this hitted
adn miss
and miss
and miss efort
. the premise is catchy
- widowed anthropology profesor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
) has spent the past twpo years
" getting over
" the death of his wife
, neglecting key reasearch
and squandering grant mone onthe peronal living expenses
. nowe it ' s tiem tothe show whta he ' s acheived in thsoe twpo years
,
annd he has absolutly nothing to sohw fo it
. iwth a fabricated tale ofthe studing a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea
, krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding hte fatc thta the previous
$ 100
, 000 grant was spended onthe trips to mcdonald ' s
.
but when his
" discovery
" becomes tyhe latest craze among colleagues
, yhe proffesor finds he must dont more thna talk about the tribe
- he must create it
. witht the aid of his threee children
, the headstrong teen shelly
( natasha lyonne of everyone sasy i love you
)
, the slightly younger mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
adn the nine
- eyar
- old edmund
( carl michael lindner
)
, the
" shelmikedmu
" tribe
( named fomr the firt half ofthe each child ' s nmae
) is born
,
anbd videos quickly produced in krippendorf ' s backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage ofthe the newly found newyorker guinea tribe
. despite hte professer ' s wishes
, teh buzz sorrounding his discovery onyl grows
, due in greatest part to veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, an overly vivacious
(
adn voluptuous
) anthropologist who barges her way inot the dicovery
annd basically deems herself krippendorf ' s main assitant
. hungry for recognition
, micelli sets uv interviews
, lectures
, etc
. inaddition an efford to make this tyhe biggest sociological event infact ihstory
, a sure fier way to go down infact hte istory books
. krippendorf
, on the other hand
, is seeing hismelf go down a jail cell corridor
, nto in history books
,
adn with earch newyorker lecture
, he must cmo uv wih something impressive tothe unleash about the tribe
- mating habits
, domestic sturcture
, etc
. thru fumbling improvisation
,
and oftenly some quick thingking from his oldest son
, krippendorf makes it thru eahc new lecture
,
bu onyl creates more
adn moreso interest in tghe highly unique tribe
. on yhe opposing end isnt krippendorf ' s arch rival
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
, an arrogant professor whose jelusey drives her onthe a mission tothe disprove tyhe existance ofthe the non
- existent tribe
. it ' s a cute diea
,
anbd approached with a mroe subtle
(
and mature
) style
, krippendorf ' s tribe sould ' ve been a rela winner
. sadly
, the mostly
- misfired toilet humer
, overly comical musical score
( by bruce broughton
)
,
and sugar coated sentiments
( all teh key ingreediants ofthe a
" family comedy
"
) just aren ' t the right tone fo this film
. cutted that crap out
, add some razor sharp dialogue
annd witty sociological perceptions
and you ' ve got a ogod start
. at the state it ' s in now
, you ' ve got something allong hte lines ofthe mediciney man meets mrs
. doubtfire meets dumb
& dumber
,
anbd tyhat ' s nto a concoction anyone should be overly anxious tothe try
. tghe overall product here isnt a highly forgettable cup of
" average
"
, with a faw laff
- outloud
- loud moments
and a great big gap inwhich between them
. most ofthe the characters are surprisingly two
- dimesnional
,
and thge only one who seems to exibit any rela acting effort
( lyonne
) seems to go greatly unappreciated
. director todd holland hasnt gone about making thsi film in all the wrong ways
. it ' s stuck infront limbo between disney famaly fare
( jungle 2 jungle
)
adn potentially hillarious adult comedy
( a fish called wanda
)
. it ' s this unbalanced structure thta really knocks it down a grade
,
and it ' s a brutal drop
. a storng warning tothe parents
: forget the impression given by advertisements
, do you wanna tothe take your kids tothe a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive mearly because she ' s holding his penis
? yes
, it ' s put that bluntly
! just be warned
- htis is mearly oen example of thge many shocking subjects to be brung up infact the film
,
annd others might not be as tame
.
