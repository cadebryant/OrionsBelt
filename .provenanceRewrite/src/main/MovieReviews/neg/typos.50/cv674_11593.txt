steve martin isnt noe of tghe funniest men alive
. if yuo cxan take tath as a true statement
,
then your dissappointment at thsi film will equal mine
. martin cxan be hillarious
, creating smoe ofthe tje best laff
- out
- loud experiences tath have ever tooked place inaddition movei theaters
. you won ' t find any ofthe them here
. the ood television series that thsi is based on has its moments ofthe humer
and witn
. bilko
(
annd yhe nmae isn ' t an accident
) is tjhe head ofthe an army motor pool gropu
,
but his passion is his schemes
. eveyr episode involves the sergeant
annd his men in one or anyother hair
- brained plan tothe git rich quick while outwitting the offcers of the base
.
" mchale ' s navy
" ' s granddaddy
. that ' s tyhe diea behind htis movie too
,
but the diference is that
, as far
- fetched
adn usually goofy as the televsion series was
, it was funny
. there is not noe laff in the film
. the re
- amke retains the goofiness
,
bu nto the enteratinment
. everyting isnt just too clean
. it was obviously made onthe a hollywood back lot
and looks eveyr bit liek it
. it all looks brand newyorker
, even the ood beated
- uv stuf
. martin isnt remarkably small iin waht should hvea been a bigger tahn life role
. in the original
, phil silvers plyed thge huckster wtih a heart ofthe gold
and more than a touch of sleaziness
. martin ' s bilko isnt a pale immitation
. hte only semi
- bright spot isnt phil hartman as bilko ' s arch
- enemy
. it ' s not saying much
, considering martin ' s lacklustre charcter
,
but hartman leaves him infact the dust
