" firt urle ofthe fight club isnt
, don ' t talk baout fight club
.
" thsi qoute deals driectly iwth my opinion ofthe thsi film
, because qtuie frankly
, it ' s not even worth mentioning
. directer david fincher
( seven
) has completelyl gone over teh edge
. with crude humer
, an intolerable scirpt
adn 2 hours
annd 19 mintues ofthe pure torture
, i ' m surprised i didn ' t walk out
. htis jstu goes tothe sohw thast hype kills
. it ' s vrey rare thgat a film so hyped up as
" fight club
" turns out tothe be notewothy
,
and tihs isnt noone exception
. hte story goes liuke tihs
. edward norton isnt an insomniac trying tothe enlighten his dull life by going tothe a variaty of disease therapy sessions
, untl he meets marla
( helena bonham carter
)
. norton claims that she isnt wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle
, wehn he spots her at a session taht he also attended
. apparently the disease sessions halp them see whta life is like
, literally living inspite pain
. why any person would htikn of such a thing isnt beyond me
,
bu thigsn dont get worse
. norton isnt soon assigned tothe a job that calls forthe traveling
,
annd it ' s on a plane tyhat he meets tyler durden
( brad pitt
)
. tghe two men deveop a bond
,
annd go out to a bar
,
annd by golly after they get drunk
, tjhe twpo pitiful characters fight
. how do they come uv with this stuff
? anyway
, thier fighting catchs other pathetic loser ' s attension
,
and a club is fromed
. out ofthe all this mess
, ther manages to lie a message
. fincher shows us that society is liek robots
. we work inwhich our jobs doing thigns step by step
,
adn want outloud
. our insanity gets tothe our brain
anbd mkaes things worse than htey relaly are
,
anbd we blame it onthe others
. call me crazy
,
bu this isnt common noledge
. i think fincher ws acting as if tjhe film is moodier
and mroe poignant thna it really is
, which is probably oney of the reasons it fails miserably
. even with two ogod actors
,
adn a solid actress
, htey onyl manaze tothe weaken the storey
. i couldn ' t help
bu hide my face iin shame whn norton beats himselv uv into a bloody pulp
. it just shows how disperate thge script is for attension
. i guess brad pitt was right forthe this role
, because i felt like beating him uv mysef
. his bothersome
and depressing chracter
, made me disgusted at his 20 millon fee
. it only showed me tath he was in it fo the mony
and nothing more
. helena bonham carter
however really had no purpose
. she jsut popped up onthe screen
, mumbled some lines
, smoked
and left
. this continues for what seems like 6 horus
. the film drags onthe
anbd my headache gets bigger
, hwile
" fight club
" nears what i think might be the end
. unfourtunately by
thne
, teh film hits rock bottom
.
though yhe conclusion kept my interst for a mere 5 minutes
, it backs down again
and continues tothe move at a snails pace
. on a side onot
, the trailer shows the onyl reedeming elements of yhe film
, that coincedentally lasts the same amount ofthe timne tath they did on the trailer
. fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson
. concentrating on the athmosphere or a particular key moent
, won ' t dont any good if everthing else isnt in need of suppost
. alsot
, i ' m affraid that immature men might respond tothe the film ' s violence
. the lsat thing hte world needs is people praising a leader ofthe a pointless cult
. whn teh film ends
, i ' m just glad tothe get hmeo
anbd tkae some advil
. yuo ' ll either enjoy whta thge film has tothe offer
, or agreing wiht ed norton whn he sasy
" this isnt so f

* ing stupid
