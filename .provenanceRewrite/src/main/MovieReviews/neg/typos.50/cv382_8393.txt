possably the years the most anticipated film
annd finally it arrives here in the uk
. it smashed u
. s box office office records inthe it ' s opening weekend
and wiull noone doubt dont tghe same here
.
but is it any good
? inaddition a word
, noone
. i ' ll elaborate furhter
. yhe story is as follows
. aparently ther were two islands witht dinosaurs on
. one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind
adn the other a tourist attraction whic failed before it even oppened
.
( see jurrasic park
.
) imgen
, the company that funded jurrasic park
, want tothe reccover thier losses by taking mroe dinos off thge otehr island
annd move them to a new attraction in san diago
. realizing waht a bad idae this is
, proffessor john hammond
( richard attenborough
) decides tothe send a team to doccument the dinosaurs
, so as to rally public support tothe perserve tyhe island
. enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who onyl agrees to go when told his girlfriend is arleady there
. so
, basically
, what you hvae isnt this
. two teams
, oney sent tothe catch
annd move some rinosarus tothe tyhe mainland
and the other
, trying tothe document them
, bieng forced to wokr toghether
, fighting forthe survival againnst the dinosaurs ' firm intentions onthe eating them
. a fairly good idae
,
however it ' s let down by one slight problem
. it ' s crap
. over twpo hours ofthe chase scenes gets way too boring
, way too quiclky
. add to this a terrable scirpt
and smoe feeble attemts at soem occasional characterisation
annd yuo end uv vrey disinterested
. it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on thigns like
, ' whta ' s fo tea
? '
and ' should yuo cut thge lawn later
? '
( yes
, ytou should
)
. it ' s a shame
then relaly
, that spielberg hasnt lowered hismelf inot making what essentially isnt a blatent cash inwhich
, which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park
. with onyl a fewd creative
and genuinely tense scenes
anbd fabulous c
. g
. i rinosarus
( the t
. rex ' s have tothe be seen tothe be beleived
)
, ther is nothing alse tothe recommend the lost world
. a veyr dissapointing sequel
, indeed
.
