" ruel states that disney ' s animated features iwll invariably be sublime
bu whenever htey try theri hand at live
- action kids ' entertainment
, they iwll fail miserably
. this goes duble forthe ocassions when tehy try to mkea a live
- acation adaption of a populare ctaroon
( remember the 1996 verzion ofthe 101 dalmations
? i ' m still trying to foreget
)
. tath rule proves mroe dependable tahn ever withthe inspector gadget
, an insulting
, dispicable
annd
, worst ofthe all
, expensive peice ofthe trash trying to pass itself off as a viable childrens ' s film
. it wiull bore anyone over five
adn should prove unbearable for adults
, even at its relatively skinny runing tyme ofthe 80 mintues
. it ' s films liuke thsi thyat amke me whant tothe go tothe my local blockbuster
and rent something from teh days whn brains were mroe importamt thna budgets
and wit compensated forthe lack of fancy effects
. just as matthew broderick began tothe convince me that ther isnt hope for him as an actor
yot
, his carrer takes a nosedive tothe hell with his
" role
" as john brown
, a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a rela policemen
and halp the people around him

annd the subsquent admiration of his long time crush
, dr
. brenda bradford

but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems thyat he hasnt to dream noone longer
. john breaks eveyr bone inwhich his body while trying to save dr
. brenda ' s father
. dr
. brenda has beeen wroking onthe a
" gadget project

[ insert name of gizmo here
]
" he cin uise all kinds ofthe nifty gadgets tothe capture crooks
, bing up bandits
and mangle murderers
. in the meantime
, the evil claw

. claw hasnt plans of world domination
, which leaves it up to the inspector
and his gadget mobile

. state ofthe yhe art effects fly at a mad pace in this
$ 90 millon dollar movei
and
yot director david kelogg never sets up a convincing athmosphere
. hadnt htey replaced all thte fancy gizmos wih doller bills they would ahev wound up wiht the same effect
. whta we see on tje screen is like the raw ingreediants of a meel
: all ofthe tje expensive f
/ x amounts to nothing
. part of thge charm ofthe thte tv serieses was its sly irreverence whihc hasnt gone down tyhe toilet in tghe condescending movei
. can kids realyl admire a hero so goody
- two
- shoes that he screams
" hey
! you ran a stpo sign
!
" hwile hanging off teh back bumper ofthe a quickly moving vehicle
? i think that today ' s childrens will respond better tothe somebody dashing
, somene ultra
- cool
. they
( propably
) receive enough preaching from their parents
and its an insult to their intelligence to asume tath they whant tothe go to an acation movie to see a father figure kick butt
. in addtion to the moreso complex complaints above
, there ' s aslo teh simple stfuf
: inspector gadget is boring
, formulaic
and achingly implausible
. ther ' s noone feeling that tghe directer realyl cares about his story
: more than any other film i ' ve seen htis yearm
, htis noe raelly fiels like it wass made onthe an assembly line
. there ' s a popular commercial
( fo sprite
,
bu taht ' s irrelavent
) runing in movei theaters befor features tath spoofs thte way major studios dael iwth projects
. it consists of studio suits discusting a fictitious
( thank god
) movie called
" death slug
"
. each executie gleefully presents a different mechandise tye
- in
( slug taco
! slug onthe a stick
!
)
. at teh end one ofthe them asks
" whta about tjhe movie
?
" anohter answers
:
" well
, we don ' t ahev a scirpt
yet
,
but we can bang one outloud by friday
.
" they probablly could have replaced
" death slug
" with inspector gadget
. this film contains hte sort of logical contradictions
anbd blatantly obvious adherance to forumla that could have beeen eleminated had any attention been payed to tyhe script
. it ' s noone coincidence tyhat most ogod childern ' s enteratinment theese days comes from animation
. animated features take so long tothe maker thast it becomes a labor ofthe lvoe for thte filmmakers
anbd they put care
and prade into their work
. these kinds of films are banged outloud quicker
anbd a ogod precentage turn outloud worthless
, sloppy
anbd impersonal
. the studios are becomming factories
and films their assembled products
