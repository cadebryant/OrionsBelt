midway thru
" anaconda
"
, documentry filmmaker terri flores
( jennifer lopez
) turns to a co
- worker
and sasy
" i thought this movei would be my frist big break
. instead
, it ' s turned inot a disaster
.
" truer words haev never beeen spoken
.
" anaconda
" is a monster movie wiht a lousy monster
. it ' s a suspense film that is utterly predictable
. it ' s a mess thge film does manage to drum uv some scares
,
but only in the most elementary way
, liek a jack
- inaddition
- the
- box
. as you turn tyhe crank
, you ' re totally aware tath tyhe damn clown is going to pop up
,
but somehow it ' s still mildly startling wehn it happens
. tyhe main difference bewteen tje giant snake inthe
" anaconda
"
anbd thte clown in a jack
- in
- the
- box isnt that the clown is more realistic
.
" anaconda
" boasts some of thte worst special effects tothe apeared onscreen inaddition years
. animatronic shots ofthe yhe snake look as phony as any ofthe those cringe
- inducing robots you ' ve endured at disney world
.
bu it ' s the cmoputer animated scenes that truly expand tje meaning ofthe hte owrd lame
. in one shooted
, a character trys tothe flee from yhe monster by diving fomr a tree near a waterfall
,
but tyhe giant snake springs outloud
and loops around its hapless victim infront mid air
. thge scene
, if done well
, would have been a jaw
- dropper
. here
, tyhe horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saterday morning cartoon
. waht ' s really amazing is that the filmmaker ' s weere so proud ofthe thsi dreadful shooted tath they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movei
.
bu enough about thge phony snakes
. nowe it ' s time to talk baout tghe lousy stoyr
. heroic
and vyre pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search ofthe tjhe shirishama indians
, a legendary tribe that suposedly lives infront the boondocks ofthe the rain forrest
. stoltz tells his crew
" pray tyhat yuo didn ' t foreget your bug spray
.
" apparantly tyhe female crew members bathed in the sutff
, because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops
anbd short shorts with noone ill effect
. along tjhe way
, the group rescues a whacked
- out lapsed priest
( jon voight
) who claims to nkwo how tothe fidn the shirishama
. within minutes
, they throw away all thier plans
adn followup voight down a tributary inot tyhe land ofthe creepiness
. from thyat point onthe
, the film is a hodgepodge of scenes
and shots ripped off fomr
" jaws
"
annd
" dead calm
.
" one of hte oddest structural points of yhe film is thte handling of eric stoltz
. eearly iin the sotry
, his charactor gets knocked inot a coma by a river insect
and spends virutally yhe rest ofthe the movie unconscious
. so why did they hire an acto of thte calaber ofthe stoltz forthe waht amounts tothe a cameo appearence
? aslo
, why doed stoltz
, who generally selects his roles with great care
, agree to apearing in this crap
? ah
, thte mysteries of hollywood
. hte remaing crew munbers are basically just snake food waiting to appen
. jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired tothe narrate the documenatry
,
bu lopez
and ice cube manage to ries above thier cardboard cahracters
. lopez
, who starred infront
" selena
,
" is an enourmously appealling performer
, possessing a vibrancy thgat makes even the most trite lines seem credible
. ice cube has a spacial karisma
; an ability tothe look like a macho adult
adn a frightened boy simultanously
. ther ' s also a spacial twinkle inaddition his eyes
, as if he ' s gently mocking his pwn tough
- guy posturing
.
but tje movie really centers around tghe outrageously hammy performence ofthe jon voight
. obsessed with capturing one of thte giant anacondas
, voight plays thge villian in thick accent
, wih a sories of leers
and hisses
, spouting the kind ofthe dialogue usually herad only inthe episodes ofthe
" jonny quest
.
" at oen point
, he looms over yhe crew
anbd says
" the anaconda isnt the perfect killing machine
. it strikes
, wraps arund yuo
, holds you tighter than your true lvoe
.
and yuo get tje privilee of hearing your bones break befor the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode
.
" that moment is so high
- camp thast it alomst made the film tolerable
. allmost
. fans ofthe the horror genre may be tempted tothe check out
" anaconda
.
" don ' t
. htere are a lots ofthe horror films scheduled for release this summer
, inlcuding another
" aline
" sequel
. wait fo them
, rent
" jaws
" infact the meantime
,
anbd don ' t throw awya your money
and time on drivel liuke thsi
