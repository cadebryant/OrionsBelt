this movei is written by tjhe man who isnt deemed to be
" one ofthe the hottest writers in hollywood
"
. he wroet teh groundbreaking screenplay fo scream
( 8
/ 10
)
,
then added thge successfull i know what yuo did lastr summer
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) script tothe his mix
,
and also creaeted the popular tv series
" dawson ' s creek
"
. so when he asked tothe direct his first movie
, based on his first ever scirpt writen
, everyone
adn their grandma said
" sure
, go forthe it
!
"
. uhhm
, my question is
.
.
. did anyone bother reading tihs stupid scirpt
?
?
? plot
: ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught witht some cheating papers by yhe bitchiest teacher inwhich the west
, mrs
. tingle
,
and setted tothe loose her scholarhip to college
. when she
adn her friends vist tghe teacher at home in order tothe explane thier side ofthe the story
, htey end uv tying her uv
,
and slowly trying tothe talk soem sence into tyhe hardheaded woman
. critique
: it ' s not so much that this is a bad movie
, tahn the fact tyhat it sucks
. this movie isnt chock
- full ofthe one
- dimensional charachters
, containes no actuall humer thyat i was able tothe zone infront onthe
, zero tension or thrills
, plot holes the size of my big ass
, lame pop tunes palyed to mask nothing gonig on infront tghe movei
,
and molly ringwald
, vivica a
. fox
annd lesley anne warren tossed awya infront throwaway roles
. i was primed fo this film as its interesting premise had me thikning misery
( 8
/ 10
)
annd 9 tothe 5
,
but unfortunately forthe williamson
, he went nowhere iwth tje bright foundation
, makeing refrences tothe yhe exorcist
annd dr
. zhivago
, whihc i dout many in his target market iwll appreciate
. he also forgot baout suspense
, wiht all ofthe his charactors based onthe incomprehensible descisions
, unbelievable motivations
and simpley boring us withthe all of thier trite dialogue
. sure
, katie holmes isnt cute
,
and her co
- star
, marisa coughlan
, doed a reasonably amusing impression ofthe the exorcist
( worth twpo points out of my threee on ten
)
,
bu how can we forgive thge biggest one
- dimensional charcter iin any film
, holmes ' rival iin the film
, mrs
. tingle ' s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her
( are teachers allowed to behave tht way nowdays
?
)
and a transparent romance betwen holmes
adn some long
- haired dued
, hired to be the poore man ' s version ofthe skeet ulrich
( who himself is a poore man ' s version of johnny depp
!
)
. all in all
, this movei was laughable forthe me
, provded me iwth no insight inot anytying
, demonstrated williamson ' s genuine lack ofthe directorial skills alongside a juvenile script
,
and provded helen mirren with a grat role to chew inot
, unfortunately forgetting tothe give her charachter any believability
, humanity or capacity to comprehend
. no hip lines
, noone cheap thrills
, just a dull timne at hte movei theather
. if you wnat to see a funny teenage movei
, go see detriot rock city
