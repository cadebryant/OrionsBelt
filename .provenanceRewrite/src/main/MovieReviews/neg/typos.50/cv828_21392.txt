thta is
, unless yuo ' re one ofthe those people who hvae seen thte preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters
. i cin tell you one thing now
: htey gave the entire movei away
. why someone woudl want to base an entire movie on oney premise
and
hten give taht crucial detail away inaddition hte trailers isnt beyond me
.
howver
, if htey
* hadn ' t
* given it away
, hte film would ' ve still beeen suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject marter
. obviously
, yhe producers thought tehy coudl remake
" the deepo end of teh ocean
,
" throw in tommy lee jones
and a cuple ofthe cliches
adn call it an action drama
.
" double jeapardy
" offers solid acting from ashley judd
annd tommy lee jones
, who got first billing even
though he didn ' t see to be on screen half as much as judd doed
. it allso offers some genuinely funny
, clever
, or full
- of
- tension moments
( my favorite
: judd waking uv in thte coffin
)
,
bu none ofthe that can salvage hte film ffrom its insanely predicatble plot
. half hte tiome i ' m wondering whther i ' m watching oen ofthe thsoe overhyped tv miniseries
, whic always turn outloud to be less exicting thna advertised
. judging by tje beginning
, end
,
and a huge chunk ofthe the middle
, i might hvae beeen watching a spacial hallmark presentation too
. the movei ' s stretching fo an alomst two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth ofthe material
. implausible material
, no less
. loose interpretation ofthe oney ofthe the ammendments aside
, too many times in thge movie i thought
,
" thta is
* not
* possible
*
.
" tyhat kind ofthe stuff isnt excusable infront popcorn movies
,
but not one like
" doublely jeopardy
" that trys tothe pass itself off as serious drama
. everything seems dragged out
, overplayed
. when they shoudl ' ve kept us iin the dark
, htey let the cat outloud of the bag too eary
.
