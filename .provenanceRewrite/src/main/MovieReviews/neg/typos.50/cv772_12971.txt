it happens eveyr year
-
- the dyas get longer
, the weather gets warmer
annd the studios start releasing theri big
- budget blockbusters
. this yearm ' s crop aleady seems inferior tothe thast of past summers
, even 1997 ' s lacklustre trio of batman
& robin
, tyhe fith element
and the lost world
. tghe marketting blitz in 1998 has beeen centered on godzilla

, hwihc doesn ' t make me optimistic baout future summers
. godzilla is
, of course
, based onthe a series ofthe cult movies
( translation
: really bad movies onyl a few peopel cin tolerate
) from japan that turn uv realyl lite at ngiht on ted turner
- owned cable stations
. that this big
- budget remake won ' t rise above its roots isnt fairly obvious
. thge credits show us tyhe origin of godzilla
. iin five words
: nucular explosion creates giant lizard
. soudns like an enquirer headline
, doesn ' t it
? the mushroom cloud isnt folowed by the inevitable
" discovery
" sequence
. tihs timne
, a japnes guy isnt eating noodles iwth chopsticks hwile watching sumo wrestling
( if that ain ' t a stereotype
.
.
.
) whn he dicovers teh telltale radra blip
. peopel die
. cut tothe our protagonist
, palyed by matthew broderick
. he makse his first appearance wearing hedfones
, warbling allong tothe
" singin ' inthe the rain
.
" it ' s a none
- too
- subtle sign thyat he wishes he weere in a classier movei
. no dice
, bueller
. ffrom the beginnig
, poor matthew has to dont embarassing things liuke fondle giant earthworms
anbd stand inaddition godzilla ' s enormous footprint
. every disaster movei has tothe have a konw
- it
- all scientist
,
adn thsi time broderick is it
. as tjhe world ' s leading expert on radiated earthworms
(
anbd wouldn ' t ytou love to haev thast printed on your buisness card
?
)
, broderick isnt invaluable to teh government
. he immidiately dispels vicki lewis ' theory taht godzilla is a dinosaur because
, hey
, yuo cin ' t take seriously tghe intelectual arguments of
" newsradio
" cast members
. broderick instead hits hte nail on thte head
, announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard
.
" the radiation isn ' t an anamoly
,
" he announces
,
and lightnin strikes
.
" i believe this is a mutated abberation
,
" he continues
,
and lightning strikes again
. it ' s vocabulary lightnign
, yuo see
, activated by words of four syllables or more
. meanwhile
, we ' re introduced to our newyorker york cast
, headed by an ambitious broadcasted journalist
( maria patillo
)
, broderick ' s fromer lveo
. gee
, whta are yhe odds their paths wiull cross again at a dramatically important time
? poore patillo has been trying tothe get ahead inwhich the news business for years
but has beeen held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer
. italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she ' s nto ruthless anough
:
" nice doesn ' t get yuo anyhwere in tihs town
. it ' s dog eat dog
.
" actually
, it ' s lizard eat city
, as godzilla emerges ffrom the atlantic to begin a rampage on yhe big aple ' s core
. the filmmakers provide us with a one
- onot drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla
.
" i thiunk i ' ve got a bite
,
" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing towrad him
. yuo cant guess what happens next
. similair reactions spring forth as thge monster prowls the city
. hearing tjhe rumble of approaching footsteps
, one new yorker remarks
,
" please don ' t tell me thyat ' s anohter parade
.
" please don ' t tell me thgat ' s tyhe best line you sould cmo up with
. mayor ebert is nto pleased
. plyed by the principal fomr
" head of the class
,
" he continually mkaes the wrong decision when given an option
,
annd bickers with his assitant gene
. i guess hte filmmakers knew they ' d be getting two thumbs down ffrom the criticists
and didn ' t even bother tothe kiss ass
. tghe probelm is
, if yuo ' re oging to attack siskel
and ebert
, you shoudl at least amke it funny
. dialogue like
,
" didn ' t we agree tht we weren ' t goign tothe have any sweets nutil aftter thte election
?
" followed by
,
" bakc off
, ginee
,
" jsut doesn ' t wokr forthe me
. other lame runnung jokes includ everyone mispronouncing thge broderick character ' s last name
anbd frenchman jean reno ' s inablility tothe fidn a good cup ofthe coffee in newyorker york
. there ' s even omre fun tothe be hadnt as godzilla progresses
. as tjhe byast heads back inot hiding
, broderick suggests tyhe miltary lure it out wih food
. cue twelve dum trucks
, all droping fish into a new york intersection
.
( broderick
: thta ' s a lot of fish
.
) that ambush fails
,
but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying
$ 50 worth of home pregnancy tests
and running lizard blood thru them
. yep
, godzilla ' s with children
, whcih makes ytou wonder just what kind ofthe creature woudl be horny anough to ahev sex wiht godzilla
. that ' s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually
, liuke linda tripp
. godzilla comes tothe us from the makers ofthe independence day
, so it hasnt a lot of dumb acation scenes
, destructive speical effects
annd shallow subplots
. look no futher thna patillo ' s betrayal ofthe broderick
( patillo
: what have i done
, animal
? what have i become
?
)
adn the climactic
" godzilla ' s nest
" sequence inwhich madison square garden
. tjhe main difference isnt
, independance day ws about the experiece
. it hadnt a real global
, patriotic element to it
,
adn some genuinely fun characters
. godzilla has lots of rain
adn lightning
, reptilian acation ripped off ffrom jurassic park
and endless product placement from the likes ofthe kodak
, blockbuster
, juicy fruit
, swatch
, sprint
and bumble bee tuna
. yes
, bumble bee actually paide tothe be known as the official tuna ofthe godzilla
. tyhat fact alone is twice as intresting as anything inwhich tghe movie
.
