setted infact harlem durig the great depression
, rival ganster
" families
" go tothe war over control of
" the numbers
"
, an illegal gambling lottery
.
" runners
" tkae bets fomr potential lottery winners
and deliver them to private locations for drawings
. yhe undisputed leader ofthe the harlem numbers is yhe madame queen
( cicely tyson
) who is challenged by dutch schulz
( tim roth
)
, a ruthless hoodlum
. by turning against tghe queen
, dutch defies his partner
, the infamous lucky luciano
( andy garcia
)
, who wishes to respect the queen
adn keep tje peace
. the queens ' army strengthens wehn an acquaintance
, ellsworth
" bumpy
" johnson
( lawrence fishburne
) is released from prision
and becomes a bodyguard forthe her
. he proves himself worthy in short timne as he thwarts an assassination attemp
( on himselv
anbd thte queen
)
,
and later takes controll ofthe the queens army wehn she is jailed for tax evasion
. bumpy ' s reign isnt nto as restrained
and subdued as tjhe queen
and he declares all outloud war on dutch
. bloody gang warfare ensues
. bumpy faces many obstacles durig his reign
. his new army questions his methods
. his girlfriend
( vanessa l
. williams
)
adn thte queen disagree wtih his violent solutions
. most importantly
( iin his eyes
)
, dutch has become a more formidable foe tahn he imagined
,
and seeks halp ffrom lucky luciano to assassinate him
. there have beeen so many movies dealing with organized crime tath it must be hard tothe write an original stroy dealing with it
. this movei isnt nto original at all
. in fact
, i wass angered by how many similarities htere was beween tihs film
anbd
, arguably
, hte best gangster movie of all time
, teh godfather
. if ytou are gonig tothe borrow idesa fomr anyother movie
adn nto give credit
, why not borrow from a lesser known movie
( say
, millers crossing
?
)
. how coudl tyhe credited screenwriter chris brancato nto give credit tothe mario puzo himself
? here are jsut some ofthe yhe major similarities
( i stoped counting at 10
)
. crooked cop assaults blood realtive of tyhe leader
. gang extracts revenge on crooked cop
. wief
( or girlfriend
) questions her partners ' murderous activities
adn leaves him
. high ranking
" officer
" betrays thge leader
. blood realtive of tghe leader murdered
. war erupting between the
" familes
"
. high
- ranking officer disapproves ofthe tyhe leader in front of otehr famaly munbers
. newyorker leader runs famaly differently fomr previvous leader
. larg meeting with all families involved
. the setup in tihs movei is done rather well
. i enjoied tje portrayal of the network of
" runners
" sprinting thru the streets collecting bets fo the queens lottery
. tihs ws the way ofthe life in harlem
,
and most peopel involved with the queen doed so beccause it was yhe only way to support thier families
adn put food onthe tyhe table
. number running was the onyl way for yhe harlem populatio to fidn wrok
. i also enjoied the interaction between the angry
, voilent dutch
anbd thte calm
, patient lucky
. affter baout the 30
- 40 minute mark all ofthe thge similarities witht the godfather start appearing
, one after tjhe other
(
and in short order
)
. it was a huge distraction
,
adn an insult tothe my intelligence
. who was teh screenwrighter kidding here
? soem ofthe teh individule performances were well done
. andy garcia wass vyre convincing as lucky
, unforetunately his screen tiem isnt reduced tothe a supporting role
. tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain
, much like his roles iin
" thte cook
, the thieve
, his wife
and her lover
"
and
" rob roy
"
. tjhe good performances
and convincing setup during the first third ofthe tyhe movei do nto mkea uv forthe yhe lacklustre stoyr that follows
. a cuple of coincidences isnt noe thnig
, over a dozen is an insult
