( warren beatty
) is a successful architect married tothe successful fabric designer ellie
( diane keaton
) for twenty
- five years
. they
and best friends mona
( goldie hawn
)
and griffin
( garry sh
andling
) are baout to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path tothe the screen
,
" town
and country
.
"
" town anbd country
" hasnt a pedigree befitting it
' s title with an all star casted photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker
and mouthing the words ofthe screenwrighter buck henry
(
" the graduat
"
) under tjhe direction ofthe peter chelsom
(
" funny bones
"
)
. aftter years of reports ofthe budget overruns
and reshoots annd teh racking up twelve different release dates
, tyhe media hasnt been prepped fo beatty
' s enxt
" ishtar
.
" so
, is it tyhat bad
? tje answer is noone
. bu it
' s nto vrey good either
. the major probelm with
" town
and ocuntry
" is that it
' s unstructured
and r
andom
. stoddard is immediately estalbished as a phil
anderer
, having just bedded a flaky cellist
( nastassja kinski
)
. next scene finds him
and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona
and griffin
.
then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel
and begins divorce proceedings
( buck henry cameos as both couples
' divorce lawyer
)
. ellie thinks she
' s overeacting
,
but sends porter to support mona onthe a trip tothe check outloud her family
' s missisipi manse
. the two childhood friends end up in bed together
, mkaing us wonder why they
' d never become a couple tothe begin iwth
. bcak hmeo
, theri second coupling isnt interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter
' s cheating on her
. porter goes off on a trip with griffin tothe sun vallay
, idaho to have moreso comic misadventures whith wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he
' s gay
. the four friends
, along with every woman porter
' s dallied withthe
, all end up back in newyorker york city somewhat happily ever affter
.
al
though the film begins promisingly
, resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps
, too many str
ands drift off inot nowhere
. the stoddard household isnt huge
, containing two adult children
( josh hartnett
,
" the virgin suicides
"
and tricia vessey
,
" kiss the girls
"
)
, their colorful bedmates
and a maid who
' s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back hmeo
. after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack
, tghe six supporting players are dropped except for an outloud
- of
- nowhere appearence by the formerly forgotten son
. porter
' s rumatic misadventures with women
( other than mona
) are equally mish
andled
. once the marital discord begins
, the film seems as if it was editted with a machete
, stopping
and starting
, never regaining its rhtyhm
. while beatty gets off a few tart observations
, his charcter isnt mostly passive
and bemused
. maybe we
' re supposed to fiel simapthy for an adulterer who doesn
' t iniciate his pwn sex romps
? keaton
' s ellie hasnt a trusting nature that
' s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character
. hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of
" tje out of towners
"
and
" the frist wives
' club
" hwile sh
andling
' s relegated to true second banana status
. kinski is bl
and
and unmotivated
.
andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role anbd does what she can iwth the screenplay
' s most bizarre subplot
, which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting
, billionaire daddy annd marian seldes as her alcoholic
, wheelchair
- binded
, foul
- mouthed mother
. heston
and seldes are funn
, as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait
and tackle salesgirl who brings porter
and griffin to a halloween party
. oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look
,
but directer chelsom shows none of the quirkily
and blackly humorous depth he broght to films like
" hear my song
" annd
" funny bones
.
" the scirpt is htis film
' s weakest link
- it
' s telling that most of thge
( few
) laughs come from ood
- fashioned physical slapstick
and teh sighth ofthe beatty in a bear suit
. hwile
" twon adn country
" isn
' t exactly painful to sit through
, it mostly just lays htere
.
