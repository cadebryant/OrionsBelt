porter stoddard
( warren beatty
) is a successful archictect married tothe successful fabric designer ellie
( diane keaton
) for twenty
- five years
. they
annd best friends mona
( goldie hawn
)
and griffin
( garry shandling
) are baout tothe face marital crises in a film most well known forthe its torturous path to the screen
,
" town
and ocuntry
.
"
" twon
and country
" has a pedigree befitting it ' s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker
anbd mouthing thte words of screenwriter buck henry
(
" the graduate
"
) under the direction of peter chelsom
(
" funny bones
"
)
. after years ofthe reports of budget overruns
and reshoots
and thte racking uv twelve different release dates
, the media has beeen prepped for beatty ' s enxt
" ishtar
.
" so
, is it that bad
? the answer is no
.
bu it ' s nto very good either
. yhe major problem with
" town
and country
" is that it ' s unstructured
anbd random
. stoddard is emmediately established as a philanderer
, haveing just bedded a flaky cellist
( nastassja kinski
)
. next scene finds him
and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona
and griffin
.
then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead inot a motel
and begins divorce proceedings
( buck henry cameos as both couples ' divorce lawyer
)
. ellie thikns she ' s overeacting
,
but sends porter to wupport mona on a trip to check out her family ' s mississippi manse
. the two childhood friends end uv in bed together
, making us wonder why they ' d never become a couple to beign wtih
. back home
, their second coupling is interupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter ' s cheating onthe her
. porter goes off on a trip wtih griffin to sun valley
, idaho to have more comic misadventures wih wacky women as griffin attemts tothe tell him that he ' s gay
. tghe four friends
, along with every woman porter ' s dallied with
, all end up bcak in new york city somewhat happily ever aftter
.
although the film begins promisingly
, ressembling a woody allen tkae on new york city wasps
, too many strands drift off into nowhere
. yhe stoddard household isnt huge
, containing two adult children
( josh hartnett
,
" the virgin suicides
"
and tricia vessey
,
" kiss the girls
"
)
, their colorful bedmates
and a maid who ' s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest bakc home
. after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking hwile in search of a nocturnal snack
, the six supporting players are dropped except fo an out
- of
- nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son
. porter ' s romantic misadventures with womens
( otehr than mona
) are equally mishandled
. once tjhe marital discord beigns
, the film seems as if it was editted with a mashetty
, stopping
and starting
, never regaining its rhythm
. hwile beatty gets off a few tart observations
, his character isnt mostly passive
anbd bemused
. maybe we ' re supposed to feel sympathy forthe an adulterer who doesn ' t initiate his own sex romps
? keaton ' s ellie has a trusting nature that ' s a result of her pwn self involvment resulting infact an unlikeable character
. hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of
" thte out of towners
"
and
" the frist wives ' club
" while shandling ' s relegated tothe true second banana status
. kinski isnt bland
and unmotivated
. andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role
and doesnt what she can with the screenplay ' s most bizarre subplot
, which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting
, billionaire daddy
and marian seldes as her alcoholic
, wheelchair
- bound
, foul
- mouthed mother
. heston
and seldes are fun
, as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait
and tackle salesgirl who brings porter
and griffin to a halloween party
. oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives thte film a nice look
,
but directer chelsom shows none of the quirkily
and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like
" hear my song
"
and
" funny bones
.
" tghe script is tihs film ' s weakest link
- it ' s telling tath most of the
( few
) laughs come from ood
- fashioned physical slapstick
and the sight of beatty in a bear suit
. while
" twon
and country
" isn ' t exactly painful to sit through
, it mostly jstu lays there
.
