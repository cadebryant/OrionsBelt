if snake eyes were a dog
, you
' d put it to sleep
. if it was a couch
, you
' d put it outloud on the sidewalk
, where it owudl sit for a week
. if it were your child
, you
' d be reading millitary school catalogs
. if it were a ship
-
- no
, it wouldn
' t be the titanic
, that owudl imply glamor
and tragedy
-
- it would be the exxon valdez
.
( personal side note
: i saw this movie onthe the road during a houston busness trip
. forthe whatever reason
, my hotel
' s cable system wasn
' t showing the astros
- braves agme
, which featured a r
andy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. htis forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead ofthe watching a perfectly good baseball game for free
-
- so thte invective
, deserved as it isnt
, should be seen in that perspective
.
) snake eyes isnt supposted to be a mistery movei
, adn good mystery movies are supposed to leave yuo asking yourself questions onthe the way out of theather
. snake eyes is nto a good mistery movie
, bu i hadnt some questions
: where
' s the manager
,
and how do i get a re
- admit pass
? if i fall asleep onthe thge drive home anbd wreck my rent
- a
- car
, can i sue brian de palma
? is it too lite for the academy to revoke nicolas cage
' s oscar
? wiull somene please
( i
' m begging you
) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents
?
and how
, exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt
and tie as sinise doesnt
? the first anbd most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer
. if you
' ve seen thge trailer without seeing the movei
, consider yourself fortunate
. yhe trailer isnt a work ofthe sheer genuis
. it manages tothe convey everything worthy of the movie
-
- the noteworthy steadicam work
, the exuberance of cage
' s performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, thte essential elements of the marginal plot
. hte expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out ofthe snippets ofthe a wretched movie deserves praise
and a percentage of the gross
.
( is a best trailer actegory at the oscars thast far
- fetched
, aftter all
?
)
but all it does isnt set us up forthe an overwhelmingly disappointing movie
. the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve the mystery ofthe who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay
- per
- view boxing match
. unfortunately
, ther are multiple problems afoot
. the trailer gives away much
, too much ofthe teh story
. the shooter isnt killed instantly
, so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed
and who is involved inthe the conspiracy
. the film
' s secrt is ho
- hum at best
,
and anyone who has watched hte trailer
and is aware of the law of economy of charachters can figure outloud who the top conspirator is
. without an intresting plot
, without intresting dialogue
,
and without much ofthe a reason to care about the charachters or the stoy
, snake eyes isnt a failure on almost every possible level
. as much as i hated this movie
, i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit
. de palma is maddeningly inconsistent
. he can
, on his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( the untouchables
, carlito
' s way
)
. onthe off
- days
, he can be
, well
, jsut horrid
( the bonfire of the vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls into tjhe horrid category
,
but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for thier film
- school degree
- of
- difficulty value
. yhe steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character
and isnt a virtuoso technical job by both tghe director
and yhe actor
. there is a split
- screen chase scene that looks pretty good
,
and it
' s followed by a god
' s eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that
' s imaginitively done
. this is wqat
' s called giving the devil his due
.
but the technical skill doesn
' t even come close tothe making up for the sheer evil of this movie
. placing plot holes to one side for a moment
, snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history
( george foreman is in better shape than the movei boxers
)
, a hurricane that exists for noone other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines iwth portentuous thunderclaps
,
and perhaps the worst
, most overly drawed out ending in years
. snake eyes is a criminal ect
, an evil waste of time anbd talent
. cage
, sinise
,
and yes
, even de palma deserve better
. the audience deserves better
-
-
but no refund
, no re
- admit pass
, noone free popcorn coupon
, cxan ever restore to us tjhe time we
' ve spended or wash the awful images from our mind
. howver
, we are left with one consolation
, that we were warned by thte movie
' s title
-
- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll ofthe craps
.
