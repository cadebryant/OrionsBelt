" pokemon 3
: the movie
" has a lot of bad things inspite it
. first of all it
' s a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents
, badly written scirpt
and fantastic animation
. the frist film came outloud the end ofthe 1999
and was a huge hit grossing almost
$ 90 million domestically
. a sequal soon folowed
and even made
$ 45 million
. warner has released thier third movei based on the immensly popular video gmae
and tv series
and its a waste ofthe time
and celluloid
. thsi time ash ketchum annd his friends are on their way to the johto battles
( which my little brother told me yhe new spinoff is
" pokemon
: yhe johto journies
" so go figure
) anyway he comes in contact wtih a young girl who
' s father has dissapeared after trying to disover tje unown
. htey are small pokemon with a powerful punch adn have grat pyschic abilities
. tje unown bring together their psychic abilities anbd create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly
' s house adn creates every wish she wants
. now it
' s up tothe ash annd his friends to stop this pokemon entei adn show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one
. too bad really that tihs is a bad movie
, surprisingly thge first movie was intertaining
and somewhat absorbing
, the second was a piece of trash
and tihs one is almost in beween
. it has some good qualities
( animation
, message in the end
)
but the flaws seem tothe overpower the goods
. i
' m still not sure what the big thign is about pokemon
, they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language
( besides meowth
, my personal favorite
)
and you don
' t underst
and what they are saying
. my little brother just
thought the movie was amazing
,
and i kept leaneant over
and asking him happened
, or what pokemon that was
. his response was a big lecture of how this is thgat
,
and tht isnt this
.
.
. he sure did put me in my place
. whith the second
and third movie being bad
, i have a feeling pokemon 4
: the movie might be a total bust as well
.
" pokemon 3
: the movie
" hasnt some reedeming qualities for the kids
, anbd the pokemon fans iwll dig every minute of this film
. for those parents
and
/ or brothers annd sisters who hvea to sit through tihs
.
.
. bring a pillow
.
