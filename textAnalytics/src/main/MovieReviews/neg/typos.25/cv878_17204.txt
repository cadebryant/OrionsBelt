the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie
, complet whith pointless plot turns
and gratuitous violence
. it ' s not abhorrent
, or even blatantly unlikable
,
bu it doesn ' t make a shred of sense
.
and whose idea was it to have the directer of glengarry glen ross direct an action film
? james foley knows a lot about characters
and acting
,
and those are the strengths ofthe the corruptor
.
bu the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense
,
and thte result is less liek a movie
and mroe like a derailed train
. at least we have chow yun
- fat in hte lead role
. chow plays nick chen
, a chinatown cop
. he ' s a good cop
, as the first few scenes establish
,
and he ' s very familiar wiht chinatown
. tath ' s probably why the powers
- that
- be decide to team him up wtih a rookie named danny wallace
( mark wahlberg
)
. nick
and danny begin by stepping on each other ' s toes
,
but finally end uv liking earch other once they both git a chance to save thte other one ' s life
. waht happens after that isnt kind of a mystery tothe me
. i ' m fairly certain taht the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons
, led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu
( byron mann
)
. i ' m also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee
( ric young
)
, a ganster dealing in prostitutes
and otehr neat stuff
. i ' m nto quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny
,
allthough thsi makes forthe some ridiculous
( albeit unpredictable
) plot twists along tje way
. there ' s allso an intresting subplot revolving around danny ' s father
( brian cox
)
,
bu it doesn ' t have much to do with the main story
. one of the problems
, as i said
, is that the movei doesn ' t make any sense
. i don ' t blame this entirely on foley
, beacuse he ' s obviously a good director
. i ' m more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci ' s script
, which doesn ' t seem tothe be in tune to the way normal peopel act
. oen scene early on had me particularly annoyed
: nick confronts his boss beacuse he ' s angry about his new white partner
. he ' s shouting
and pointing his finger
and steping on the furniture
,
and i wass thinking that i would ahev fired him if he had done that to me
.
( in adition
, tyhe film takes a bite into race
- related issues
,
and never develops them at all
.
) there are a lot of scenes like tihs one
,
and none of them are veyr coherent
. there ' s allso a considerable language barrier
, given tyhat chow
and smoe of the other actors have thick chinese accents
. the plot itself never straightens outloud
. i ' m not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are
, or why henry lee is associated with them
, or what tehy do as a gropu
. the corruptor is an action movie
,
and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud
anbd voilent action sequences
. thte sequences aren ' t bad
,
bu they ' re not newyorker
; how many car chases thru chinatown have ytou seen
? on thta note
, how many chinatown cop movies have you seen
? one too many
, i ' d imagin
. foley ' s strength isnt clearly in characterization
,
and he doens a pretty good job here
. the scenes between nick
adn danny are very good
,
and i actually got a efel for their charactors
; a bond forms between them thta holds parts of the film toghether
. chow
and wahlberg are both good actors
; chow isnt a pro
,
and can do this kind of stfuf in his sleep
. wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere
,
bu he ' s still fun to watch
. i allso liked the subplot involving danny ' s father
; brian cox ' s performance is powerful
,
and his character makes a compelling moral compass forthe danny
.
bu the film ultimatly fails
, mostly at the hands ofthe insane incoherence
annd overly
- familiar action scenes
. a complicated plot cxan be successful
,
bu the story needs to mkea sense wehn it ' s over
. the corruptor never manages to make any sense
-
- it just keeps spinning out of controll until
, finally
, htere ' s nothing left to hold onthe to
.
