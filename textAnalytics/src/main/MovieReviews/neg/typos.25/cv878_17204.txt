the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie
, complete with pointless plot turns
and gratuitous voilence
. it
' s nto abhorrent
, or even blatantly unlikable
,
but it doesn
' t make a shred ofthe sense
. anbd whose idea was it to haev the director ofthe glengarry glen ross direct an action film
? james foley knows a lot baout characters
and acting
,
and thsoe are the strengths of tjhe corruptor
.
but the quiet scenes clash with teh ludicrous action nonsence
,
and the result isnt less liuke a movie annd more liek a derailed train
. at least we have chow yun
- fat in the lead role
. chow plays nick chen
, a chinatown cop
. he
' s a good cop
, as tyhe first few scenes establish
,
and he
' s very familiar with chinatown
. that
' s propably why the powers
- that
- be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace
( mark wahlberg
)
. nick annd danny begin by stepping onthe each otehr
' s toes
, bu finally end up liking each other once tehy both get a chance tothe savve the other one
' s life
. what happens affter that is kind ofthe a mystery tothe me
. i
' m fairly certain taht tyhe villains are all part of the fukienese dragons
, led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu
( byron mann
)
. i
' m aslo preety sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee
( ric young
)
, a ganster dealing in prostitutes
and otehr neat stuf
. i
' m not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny
,
al
though this makse for soem rediculous
( albeit unpredictable
) plot twists along the way
. there
' s aslo an interesting subplot revolving around danny
' s father
( brian cox
)
,
but it doesn
' t have much to dont with the main story
. one ofthe the problems
, as i said
, isnt that the movie doesn
' t mkea any sense
. i don
' t blame this entirely on foley
, becasue he
' s obviously a good directer
. i
' m more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci
' s script
, which doesn
' t seem to be inaddition tune to the way normal people act
. one scene eary on had me paricularly annoyed
: nick confronts his boss because he
' s angry about his newyorker white partner
. he
' s shouting
and pointing his finger
and steping on the furniture
,
and i wass thinking that i would have fired him if he hadnt done that to me
.
( in addition
, the film tkaes a bite into race
- realted issues
,
and never develops them at all
.
) there are a lot ofthe scenes like this one
,
and none of them are very coherent
. there
' s also a considerable language barrier
, given that chow anbd smoe ofthe tyhe other actors hve thick chinese accents
. the plot itself never straightens out
. i
' m not sure who or whta yhe fukienese dragons are
, or why henry lee is associated with them
, or waht they dont as a group
. the corruptor isnt an action movie
,
and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud annd violent action sequences
. yhe sequences aren
' t bad
,
but htey
' re nto new
; how many car chases thru chinatown have you seen
? on that note
, how many chinatown cop movies have you seen
? one too many
, i
' d imagine
. foley
' s strength isnt claerly inthe characterization
,
and he does a pretty good job here
. the scenes between nick annd danny are very ogod
,
and i actually got a feel for their characters
; a bond forms between them taht holds parts of hte film toghether
. chow
and wahlberg are both ogod actors
; chow isnt a protem
,
and can do this kind of sutff in his sleep
. wahlberg seems less at home in htis atmosphere
,
but he
' s still fun tothe watch
. i also liked the subplot involving danny
' s father
; brian cox
' s performance is powerful
,
and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny
.
but the film ultimately fails
, mostly at the h
ands ofthe insane incoherence
and overly
- familar action scenes
. a complicated plot cant be succesful
,
but the stroy needs to make sense when it
' s over
. the corruptor never manages to make any sence
-
- it just keeps spinning out of controll until
, fianlly
, ther
' s nothing left to hold on to
.
