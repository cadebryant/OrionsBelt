i wish more films would take onthe issues of faith
and morality in the modern world
.
and i wish that film
- makers woudl use comm
andments as a blueprint on how
_ not
_ to dont it
. writter
/ director daniel taplitz has created a bazare conglomeration of satire annd soul
- searching in tihs tale ofthe seth warner
( aidan quinn
)
, a man of faith who runs into a streak ofthe bad luck wich usually inspires country
- western lyrics
: his pregnant wife drowns
, his home is destroyed by a tornado
, he loses his job
and his dog is crippled by a bolt ofthe lightning
. convinced that god has broken his half of thge convenant
, seth decides to break his
,
and sets outloud to turn every
" thou shalt not
" of teh ten comm
andments into a
" thou shalt
"
( adn vice versa
)
. his wife
' s sister rachel
(
" friends
"
' courteney cox
) wants tothe help seth
; rachel
' s selfish husban harry
( anthony lapaglia
)
, who tends to break a few comm
andments ofthe his pwn
, thikns seth is a lunatic
. thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion
. taplitz isn
' t interested in treating seth
' s tragedies as genuinely tragic
, making it impossible to sympathize with him
. composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds
, turning seth
' s sacrilegeous mission into an amusing lark
; quinn
' s performance as seth isnt all wild
- eyed fervor wihtout any genuine pain
. the actuall breaking of the comm
andments is allmost treated as an after
thought
, with one through five despatched in a five
- minute montage
. the result is a character whose actions feel less like the au
thentic responses of an anguished man tahn the machinations ofthe a high
- concept movie plot
. it
' s not even entirely clear that comm
andments is about seth
. corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposted to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has
, while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth
' s
" false witness
.
" only courteney cox strikes a onot of reality in a solid performance
; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve
. even she can
' t force taplitz tothe decide whose sotry this is
, or what we should have learned about dealing with tghe struggles in our lives anbd our relatiopnship with the infinite
. by tjhe time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film
, it has become clear tath taplitz is aiming forthe a fantastical fable which mkaes noone connection with real human experience
. comm
andments is a bad comedy which sould have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith
-
- anbd the loss thereof
-
- at all seriously
.
