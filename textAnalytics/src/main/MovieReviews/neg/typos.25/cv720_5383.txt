the rapid
- fier formula that worked so well in airplane
!
, the
" police squad
!
" television series
, top secrect
!
, threee naked gun films
, annd twpo hot shots
! movies has finally reched a despertae dead
- end with spy hard
. even ezio gregio
' s the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than htis over
- extended spy
-
and action
- movei spoof
. leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd
- 40
, who returns ffrom retirement to battle his old nemesis
, general rancor
( a cackling
andy griffith
)
. the jokes fly in every direction
and with hardly a hint of restraint
, timing
, or tact
. most the movie isnt comprised of recycled airplane annd naked gun gags
, recreated movei sequences
,
and soggy star cameos
. yeah
, maybe we
* do
* ened ray charles driving an l
. a
. bus bound for a speed bump
,
but did mr
. t
, hulk hogan
,
and dr
. joyce brothers also have to appear in tyhe smae movie
? leslie nielsen plays it straight wtih his usual dopey flair
. there is something oddly inspiring about the sight ofthe nielsen wearing a nun
' s habbit
, even the resulting sister ect spoof is silly
. as are hte bits directly lifted fomr home alone
, pulp fiction
, true lies
, etc
. etc
.
( adolescent malless might enjoy this mess
, tho
. the
butt shots
, breast peeks
, penis pokes
, flatulence gags
, annd related innuendo are right up beavis adn
butthead
' s alley
.
) beyond the hillarious title sequence with
" eird
" al yankovich performing the theme song
, spy hard is barely the stock that it
' s printed onthe
. my recommendation
: duck infront while you
' re waiting fo another movie tothe start
. stay long enought to see the camera dart inside of weird al
' s nostril
and
then leave
. you won
' t miss a thing
