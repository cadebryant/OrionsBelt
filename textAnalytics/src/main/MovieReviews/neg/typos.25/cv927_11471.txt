the lives of older peopel in thge twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories
and possible futures is a fascinating topic
. finding an all
- star cast fo such a film is a stroke of genius
. combining all that with a threee
- time oscar
- winning director
( robert benton of
" kramer vs
. kramer
"
)
and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment
. in
yet anohter noir mistery set inthe hollywood
-
- how many of these have we seen during thte past few years
?
-
- tyhe atmosphere is moody
, the actors enjoyable to watch
and the story goes nowhere
. over
- 70 harry ross
( paul newman
) is a washed up cop
- turned
- private eye
- turned man friday trying tothe figure out how to live what remains of his life
. he
' s screwed up thigns pretty well
(
" i had a wife
and daughter
. now
, i
' m a drunk
)
and is at a crossroads
. a couple of years ago
, he traveled tothe mexico to bring back mel
( reese witherspoon
)
, the under
- age daugher ofthe jack
( gene hackman
)
and catherine
( susan sar
andon
) ames
and now lives with them
. the ames are former movie stars
, past thier prime adn the three have become fast friends
. one gets the impression tath ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up
. to fill his time
, he doesnt odd jobs forthe jack anbd falls in love with catherine
. jack is inwhich even worse shape than harry
. he
' s dying ofthe cancer with only a year tothe live
. things dont turn omre exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him
. instead of the routine err
and tyhat ross expects
, he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of anyother ex
- cop who is
, himself
, full of bloody holes
. this unsettling event gives the former detective a project tothe throw himself into
and launches an investigation that revolves arund the mysterious disappearance of catherine
' s first husban 20 years before
. through a series of very complex
and convoluted plot devices that envolve murder
; blackmail
; guns
; mel
' s mexico traveling partner
and his parole officer
; ross
' s former cop buddies
, ex
- lover adn owudl
- be sidekick
, the tale fianlly ends up exactly where everyone expects it to
. it
' s a film noir tradition that the story twists
and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale
, bu here thge journey me
anders towards an endig that no one cares about
. teh only surprises are exactly whose face fits whihc role in the scenario
. by the timne they sohw you
, it doesn
' t matter
. the storyline gets goofier
and goofier exemplified in ross
' s relationship withthe rubin
( giancarlo esposito
)
, a partner wannabe
. these scenes are obviously designed to be comic releaf
,
however tehy are niether
. rubin
and ross have some past relationship
but either it
' s not explained or i didn
' t care anough at that point tothe remeber
. a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whther he is still able to perform
. it
' s also not funny
, doesn
' t connect
and keeps onthe showing up long after it has run its course
. on the positive side
, it
' s oftenly enjoyable to watch teh seasoned actors on the screen
. the threee leads all hve well
- deserved academy awards adn turn in accomplished
, if not extrordinary jobs
. newman isnt a gr
and actor
,
but doesn
' t seem quite suited to tje dark film style
. he is a bit too clean
and understated to come across as desperate
and down
and out
. hackman
, also low
- key
, is believable
but lacks sparkle
. sar
andon comes accross well as an sultry older babe
al
though she is one
- dimesnional
. tyhe actors do what tehy cxan with lame dialog
,
but they cin
' t pul the film out ofthe the hole it
' s digged for itself
. james garner who plays ross
' s old buddy ex
- cop raymond hope is always a treat
,
but even he half
- heartedly struggles thru lines like
" i
' m glad they didn
' t shoot your pecker off
.
" the best part of yhe film is the look at old friends
, how their relationships change over hte eyars
and hte difficult choices they must make
. tje genuinely easy
and casual interactions among teh actors hint tath being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the film doesn
' t run vyre long befoer teh audience realizes taht it
' s hopeless
. the only reason for watching isnt tyhe actors
. it reminds me of diaster movies such as
" towering inferno
" where the star power isnt supposed tothe make everyone ignore teh film
' s problems
. in a better world
, ther would have been second
- rate actors in this second
- rate movie
and the ones here woudl have beeen saved forthe something better
. of course
, we don
' t live infact that better world
, bu ytou could make yours a little nicer by chosing a different movie
.
