" knock off
" is exactly that
: a cheap knock off of an action movei
. it ' s also the worst movie i have seen thus far htis year
. i figured it would be at least a couple ofthe months before i saw the worst film of 1998
,
but alas
, it hasnt already been found
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i thiunk
) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half
- brother has beeen supplying him iwth cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme ' s partner
,
and rochon plays
.
.
. actually
, i have no idea who rochon wass supposed to be
. she jsut sort of popped up halfway thru without an explanation as to why she was there
. many things are not explained infront this film
,
but i do know that for some bizarre reason
, van damme seemed to be donig a jackie chan impression throughout thge flick
. where chan comes off as endearing inspite his
" normal guy
" character seen inthe many of his films
, van damme just comes off as a wimp
. we ' re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions
. to be more clear
: i did not even know who he was supposed tothe be until baout an hour into tghe movie
,
and even
then
, it was not made too clear
. the film hasnt beeen directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme ' s last movie
, the bad
,
but not nearly as bad as this
,
" double team
"
) never lets the camera rest for a second
,
and tht ' s no exaggeration
. we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme ' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i have no probelm with directors who watn tothe play around with film conventions
, as long as they don ' t get carried awya
. fo example
, look at sam raimi
.
" army of darkness
"
, one of his best movies
, features soem of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen
,
bu raimi never lets tjhe special effects get in the way of story
. that ' s a concept that tsui cxan ' t seem to grasp
. the speical effects
and outrageous camera angles
* rule
*
" knock off
" to the point where the audience doesn ' t have a clue as tothe what ' s happening any more
. another problem iwth the film isnt that it looks cheap
. the film stock used isnt ofthe such low calaber that i thought i was watching one ofthe those chinese films shown really lite at night
.
and for some inexplicable reason
, everyone ' s voice seems to have been dubbed
. even the stars
.
and even tje special effects
, seamingly the only aspect of the film tghe director actaully cared baout
, are inconsistant
. for example
, there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out ofthe a window
. the car slams into the ground
,
and the left wheel is completely destroyed
. seconds later
, the car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i have noone probelm suspending my disbelief in an action movie
,
but a line must be drawn somwhere
. finally
, tjhe acting
. nobody gives a good performance in this film
. van damme
, an acotr i usually liuke
, is way off the mark playing
" everyman
"
.
and schneider
, here tothe provide comic relief i asume
, is totally unfunny
and over acts his way through every scene
. even the usualy solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- thge
- top performance as
.
.
. once again
, i hvae no idea who he was suppoed to be
. in case i haven ' t
yet made it clear enough
,
" knock off
" is the worst movie of van damme ' s career
and possibly the worst movei of the decade
.
and it ' s nto even one of those movies that ' s so bad it ' s funny
. it ' s too inept to be funny
. there are no redeeming factors in
" knock off
"
and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp
and that somehow my memory ofthe watching hte film can be erased
.
