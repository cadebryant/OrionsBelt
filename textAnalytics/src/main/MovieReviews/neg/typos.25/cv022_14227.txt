" knock off
" isnt exactly that
: a cheap knock off of an action movei
. it
' s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year
. i figured it would be at least a cuple of months before i saw teh worst film of 1998
, bu alas
, it has already been found
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i think
) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half
- brother hasnt been supplying him withthe cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme
' s partner
, anbd rochon plays
.
.
. actually
, i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be
. she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she wass there
. many things are nto explained inwhich htis film
, bu i do nkow that fo some bizarre reason
, van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick
. where chan comes off as endearing in his
" normal guy
" carachter seen inthe many ofthe his films
, van damme just comes off as a wimp
. we
' re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many ofthe his actions
. to be omre clear
: i did not even nkow who he was supposed to be until about an hour inot the movie
, adn even hten
, it wass not made too claer
. the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme
' s last movei
, the bad
,
but not nearly as bad as this
,
" double team
"
) never lets the camera rest for a second
,
and thyat
' s no exaggeration
. we are even treated tothe a five second shot from tghe point ofthe view of van damme
' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions
, as long as htey don
' t get carried away
. for exmaple
, look at sam raimi
.
" army of darkness
"
, one ofthe his best movies
, features some of yhe most inventive camera wrok i have ever seen
, bu raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story
. that
' s a consept that tsui can
' t seem to grasp
. the special effects annd outrageous camera angles
* rule
*
" knock off
" to teh point where the audience doesn
' t have a clue as to what
' s happening any more
. another problem with the film is thgat it looks cheap
. thge film stock used is of such low calibur that i
thought i was watching one ofthe those chinese films shown really late at niht
.
and for some inexplicable reason
, everyone
' s voice seems to have beeen dubbed
. even the stars
. anbd even the special effects
, seamingly the only aspect ofthe the film the directer actually cared about
, are inconsistent
. forthe example
, there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window
. the car slams into the ground
, adn the left wheel is completely destroyed
. seconds later
, the car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i ahve noone probelm suspending my disbelief inwhich an action movie
, bu a line must be drawn somwhere
. fianlly
, the acting
. nobody gives a good peformance inaddition this film
. van damme
, an ctor i ususally like
, is way off the mark playing
" everyman
"
.
and schneider
, here to provide comic relief i assume
, is totally unfunny
and over acts his way through eveyr scene
. even the usally solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- the
- top performance as
.
.
. once again
, i have no idea who he was supposed to be
. in case i haven
' t yot made it clera enought
,
" knock off
" is hte worst movie of van damme
' s career
and possibly thte worst movie of the decade
. adn it
' s not even one ofthe thsoe movies that
' s so bad it
' s funny
. it
' s too inept tothe be funny
. there are no redeeming factors in
" knock off
"
and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp
and thgat somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased
.
