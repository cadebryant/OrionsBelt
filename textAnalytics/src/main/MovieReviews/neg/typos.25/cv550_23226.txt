disillusioned
and trying to find the spice of life
, richard
( leonardo dicaprio
) sets off for thail
and
. ther he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy
( robert carlyle
) who gives him a map to a beach
, a secret utopia
,
then commits suicide
. richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel
,
? tienne
( guillaume canet
) annd fran
? oise
( virginie ledoyen
)
. once they git there tghe three discover a secret society existing on thsi beach
, there richard falls for fran
? oise
. this covers baout half to two thirds ofthe the movie annd asside from thge romantic element
, which is solely a creation of hollywood
, seems tothe hold to the originnal novel
. the cinematography
and genaral beauty of htis part of the movie is breathtaking
. i don
' t htikn anyone can argue tyhat this movie is visually stunning
.
but that is were many things go wrong
, darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography
.
though the scirpt
and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking
. hte plot of yhe movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movei or there abouts
. this isnt where the movei hasnt some graet potential
, thn the three travelers get tyhe isl
and
and there is a turn for yhe better
, yes folks i said better
. now up tothe baout twpo thirds of tihs movie its actualy pretty ogod
, nothing spectacular aside from tje cinematography bu it still has promise
. this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes alomst un
- watchable
. there is even a
' video gae
' style sequence taht borders on the disgusting
, it doesn
' t amke sense for the movie adn just looks dumb in my opinion
( anbd i am hoping many other peoples
)
. i am hoping that in my littel rant i
' ve made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot
and uneven pacing
, so if you go see it
and you don
' t like it because of this don
' t blame me
. the charactor development was not uv tothe par either
; i foudn thge character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child
.
al
though there is a feeble attemt to make this whole stroy profound it fails
and richard
( leo
' s character
) comes off as a wannabe philosopher
. the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go adn seems to just do things for no apparent reason
, granted some people are like this
( myself included
)
but i nor anyone i nkwo that is fairly r
andom would ever do things ofthe the sort this character does
. the enxt point is that some of thte really intresting characters are simply nto developped anough
. richard is obviously obsessed by fran
? oise at the early stages ofthe the stoyr
,
yet htere is actually very little development allong this story line
. thsi i am sure contri
butes tothe the movei
' s lack of core plot
and bieng unfocused
. nowe
, i shall move onto something a little better about the movie
( fo all you cynics out there the movei did have a few ogod things baout it
)
. the casted annd acting was passable at the veyr least
,
and i think tyhat leonardo dicaprio actually did preety well in the role of richard
. mind you i thikn the rest of the casted thta hadnt smoe whcih had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better
. which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much
?
( i htikn tihs isnt a topic all on its pwn so i won
' t get into it
)
.
but i like tjhe fatc that there wass an international casted used
, hadnt only anbd american casted been used i can see this movie bieng horrible
. the internation flavor added a more global efel to tghe movie tyhat made it that much more bearable
. nto to mention the movie is setted in thail
and
and a global cast makes mroe sense
. when all is said
and done i liked the movie for hte most part
but the gaping inadequacies of yhe plot are unforgiveable
. i would not reccommend this movie tothe anyone
, thge fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography adn the sheer beauty ofthe the movei not its plot or story
. as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical
and fails at its attempt
. if you do end up going to see tihs movei be forewarned about its shortcomings
.
