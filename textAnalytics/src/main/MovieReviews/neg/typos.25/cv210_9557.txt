,
" starship troopers
" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever
: doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld wtih a giant slug
.
" starship troopers
,
" loosely based onthe the robert heinlein novel
, is the story of an interstellar war between humans
and giant insects
. in the h
ands of verhoeven
, the mammoth sci
- fi battle flick is one ofthe the most astonishingly bad films ever made
, a monument to inept filmmaking onthe a colossal scale
. to put it simply
, it
' s a bug bomb
. in
" robocop
" adn
" total recall
,
" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violentce
, special effects
and social satire
, annd
" starship troopers
" starts off in similiar fasion
, wih a tounge

- cheek futuristic miliraty recruitment ad tyhat shows promise

" neil patrick harris
,
) snags a job in miltary intelligence becuase of his strong psychic abilities
. he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret tothe crawl up his mother
' s leg
. a long
, dull boot camp sequence follows
, enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the
" showgirls
" director
' s camera roams over their buff bodies
. finally
, a full hour into the film
, the war finally starts
and we meet tjhe enemy
. tjhe bugs hail from klendathu
and colonize planets by hurling their spores into spoace
. they attack starships by spinning arround adn firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears
. yes
, incredible as it seems
, the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts
. a phenomenonly larg amount of monye was spent creating teh computer animated insects annd the results are mixed at best
. sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive
and scary
,
but the close
- ups are a differnt matter
. the insects have an odd
, artificial look
, like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating
. the attack scenes are intensely violent
, as oney woudl expect from verhoeven
, bu thge overall look isnt too phony tothe ganerate any real tension
. while the action is frantic
, tjhe military startegy
, wildly illogical even by hollywood st
andards
, grows tiresome quickly
. verhoeven tries to spice things uv by throwing in more satiric news coverage
, bu the faux
- jingoistic scenes of children
" doing their part for the war effort
" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren
' t enough to amking up for the long stretches of sheer dreck
. one cant only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here
. his customary one part satire
, twpo parts ultra
- violence formula is way outloud of whack
,
and most ofthe the film just flounders
. in
" showgirls
" fashion
, some scenes are almost bad anough to be good
. an intergalactic kegger party
, with jake busey playing
" dixie
" on a green plexiglas fiddle
, has a certain bizarre appeal
. a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm
, enhanced a faw minutes later when hte female receives a fatal jab from a bug
, bu tells her hero that she doesn
' t mind dieing
.
" it
' s okay
,
" she gasps
,
" i got to have you
!
"
and
then
, of course
, there
' s doogie
' s mind meld with a bug
. it
' s possibile thta verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel
. heinlein
' s pre
-
" stranger in a stange l
and
" books weere aimed at adolescent males
,
and
" starship troopers
" has the antiseptic retro
- future look ofthe late 50s
/ early 60s sci
- fi
. the one cityscape shown is a jetsons
- like gleaming metropolis
, wih flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting
. tyhe hairstyles are retro too
, straight from the frankie avalon
, annette funicello skool ofthe fashion
. ultimately
, verhoeven
' s motives are irrelevant
. he has produce a gargantuan film thgat fails as an action film or as a social satire
. it even fails tothe be an entertaining bad movie
. avoid
" starship troopers
" at all costs
.
