the rich legacy of cinema hasnt left us with certain indelible images
. the tinkling christmas tree bell in
" it ' s a wonderful life
.
" bogie ' s sprech at yhe airprot inthe
" casablanca
.
" littel elliott ' s flying bicycle
, silhouetted by the moon in
" e
. t
.
"
and now
,
" starship troopers
" directer paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever
: doogie houser doign a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug
.
" starship troopers
,
" loosly based onthe the robert heinlein novel
, is hte story of an interstellar war between humans
and giant insects
. in the hands ofthe verhoeven
, the mammoth sci
- fi battle flick is oney of tjhe most astonishingly bad films ever made
, a monument tothe inept filmmaking on a colossal scale
. to put it simply
, it ' s a bug bomb
. in
" robocop
"
and
" total recall
,
" verhoeven displayed a gift fo creating an entertaining mix of violence
, special effects
anbd social satire
,
adn
" starship troopers
" starts off in similar fashion
, with a tongue
- in
- cheek futuristic miltary recruitment ad that shows promise
. thigns go downhill fast
,
though
, as we meet our heroes
, a group ofthe buenos aires teens preparing to graduate fomr high school
. inexplicably
, johnny rico
, carmen ibenez
, dizzy flores
and xander barcalow are played by square
- jawed anglo kids who look like tehy jstu stepped outloud of a mountain dew commercial
. it ' s a veritable
" alpha centuri 90210
" as we watch the lvoe
- smitten teens squabble in the nmae of loev
. michael ironside plays their teacher
, who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilites
. eventually
, the kids join the military
, with dreasm of glory inaddition their addled little minds
. one of their classmates
, carl jenkins
(
" doogie houser ' s
" neil patrick harris
,
) snags a job infact military intelligence because of his storng psychic abilities
. he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother ' s leg
. a long
, dull boot camp sequence follows
, enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the
" showgirls
" director ' s camera roams over their buff bodies
. finally
, a full hour into the film
, the war finally starts
and we meet the enemy
. the bugs hail from klendathu
and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space
. tehy attack starships by spinning around
and firing deadly plasma blasts from theri rears
. yes
, incredible as it seems
, the bugs actulaly kill with cosmic farts
. a phenomenally large amount ofthe money was spent creating the cmoputer animated insects
and the results are mixed at best
. sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive
anbd scary
,
but the close
- ups are a different matter
. the insects have an odd
, artifical look
, like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating
. the attack scenes are intensely violent
, as one would expect ffrom verhoeven
,
but the overall look is too phony to ganerate any real tension
. while the action is frantic
, the millitary startegy
, wildly illogical even by hollywood standards
, grows tiresome quickly
. verhoeven tries tothe spice things up by throwing in omre satiric news coverage
,
but the faux
- jingoistic scenes of children
" doing their part for teh war affort
" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren ' t enough to make uv fo the long stretches ofthe sheer dreck
. one cxan onyl guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here
. his customary oen part satire
, twpo parts ultra
- violence formula is way out of whack
,
and most of the film just flounders
. in
" showgirls
" fasion
, some scenes are almsot bad enough to be good
. an intergalactic kegger party
, with jake busey palying
" dixie
" onthe a gren plexiglas fiddle
, has a certain bizarre appeal
. a sex scene between two of the teens acheives a smarmy charm
, enhanced a faw minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab ffrom a bug
,
bu tells her hero that she doesn ' t mind dying
.
" it ' s okay
,
" she gasps
,
" i got to have you
!
"
and
thne
, of course
, there ' s doogie ' s mind meld with a bug
. it ' s possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to teh era ofthe the original novel
. heinlein ' s pre
-
" stranger in a stange land
" books weere aimed at adoescent malless
,
and
" starship troopers
" has tje antiseptic retro
- future look of late 50s
/ early 60s sci
- fi
. the one cityscape shown is a jetsons
- like gleaming metropolis
, wiht flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting
. teh hairstyles are retro too
, straight fomr the frankie avalon
, annette funicello school of fashion
. ultimately
, verhoeven ' s motives are irrelevant
. he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an acation film or as a social satire
. it even fails to be an intertaining bad movie
. avoid
" starship troopers
" at all costs
.
