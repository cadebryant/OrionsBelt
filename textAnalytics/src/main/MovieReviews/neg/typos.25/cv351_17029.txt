htere
' s a scene early on in
" jawbreaker
" where a character utters tje unintentionally prophetic line
,
" that isnt
* so
* not funny
"
. how right she was
. this pathetic tale of three high
- schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry isnt never even remotely funny
. or fun
. or orignal
. not content with the too
- obvious
" heathers
" heisting
, the filmmakers procede tothe lift freely from a staggering variety of sources
, including
" carrie
"
,
" bride of frankenstein
"
,
" blue velvet
"
,
and even shaw
' s pygmalion
, itself recently remade as
" she
' s all that
"
.
" jawbreaker
" isnt a pastiche
,
and not even an enjoyable one
. i fidn it extrememly telling that the most engaging part ofthe the film isnt hte credit sequence
, a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt
' s
" volcano girls
"
; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film
, the song has absolutly nothing to dont witht tghe footage we
' re watching
. just close your eyes
and pretend you
' re listening to an alt
- rock station
; you won
' t be missing anytying
. the blaim for a mess this big has to be spreaded aroud amonth the principals
. rebecca gayheart
, following roles in
" scream 2
"
and
" urban legend
"
, should have known better tahn to take
yet anyother role in
yet another teen body count movei
. pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might ahev gotten from her role in quentin tarantino
' s
" jackie brown
"
.
and rose mcgowan should jstu quit acting
. she hasnt no charisma
, no presence
,
and no acting skills otehr than rolling her eyes
and looking disaffected
. mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real
- life boyfriend
, rocker marilyn manson
, whose fifteen second role here is far more intresting than anything any of the
" rela
" actors are doing
. manson
, sans trademark makeup
& contact lenses
,
and with an obviously fake moustache
, looks eerily like nicholas cage
; who woulda thunk it
? that crack about direction by committee wasn
' t merely a pithy sound
- bite
. stylistically
, thematically
& narratively
,
" jawbreaker
" is all over the map
, varing wildly in tone
& content from scene to scene
.
though credited soley tothe writer
/ directer darren stein
, one gets teh feeling that no twpo scenes here weere actually guided by the same h
ands
. if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity
, someone needs to get the man some drugs
, pronto
. prozac
, lithium
, kava
, ritalin
, something
, anytying
. he
' s qtuie obviously in depserate ened of chemical halp
.
" jawbreaker
" is a monumental waste of efort
and resources
, anbd quite likely one of the single worst films i
' ve ever seen
. tothe call
" jawbreaker
" garbage would be tothe insult garbage
. bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe
; i
' ve already got my pik for worst film ofthe
' 99
.
" jawbreaker
" runs approximately 90 minutes
,
though it feels longer than
" titanic
"
,
and is rated r for language
, sexual situations
and graphic violence
. not recommended for kids
, teens
, or anyone esle
.
