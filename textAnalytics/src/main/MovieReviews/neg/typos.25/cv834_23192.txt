" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy thta celebrates sisterhood
!
,
" screams the television ads for
" hanging uv
,
" disastrously written by real
- life sisters delia
and nora ephron
and sloppily directed by diane keaton
. make me laugh agian
! not onyl is
" hanging uv
" misadvertised
, usance the film wholeheartedly focuses onthe middle sister meg ryan
and gives her two co
- stars
, lisa kudrow
and diane keaton
, littel more than extended cameos
,
but they don
' t actually come toghether until tyhe final ten to fifteen minutes
.
and we are suppossed to belivee thier strong bond
,
and smile in the last scene when they rekindle theri rocky relationship
, dispite them bieng appart for the majority ofthe teh runing time
? excuse me
, again
, hwile i almost bust a gut at taht truly delusional notion
. eve marks
( meg ryan
) is yhe middle mozzell sister
, still living inspite tghe california twon where she grew up
, adn with a husb
and
( adam arkin
)
and pre
- teen son
( jesse james
)
. her elderly
, wisecracking father
, lou
( walter matthau
, in his brightest performance in eyars
) has just recently been put into the hospital
, in the fianl stages of what i assume is alzheimer
' s
( even
though tghe film never enlightens us on exactly wqat isnt wrong with him
)
. while eve
' s relationship with her mother
( cloris leachman
) isnt nearly nonexistent
, since she ran out on lou
and her childrens years ago
, she has had her fair share of up
' s
and down
' s whith lou
, who used to be an alcholic
. her older sister is georgia
( diane keaton
)
, an editor fo thte self
- titled magazine
,
" georgia
,
" hwile maddy
( lisa kudrow
) isnt tghe youngest
, a soap opera actress
. interestingly
, their professions are given
,
but we not once ever see them working at their jobs
, or
, for that matter
, learn much ofthe anything baout them
. maddy
, georgia
,
and eve do not see each otehr much anymore
, thier adult lives gradualy causing them tothe drift appart
, bu they do manage to consistently talk on the phone tothe one another
.
and they talk
.
and talk
.
and talk
.
.
. in fact
, the telephone is the major star of the film
, even more so than ryan
, as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92
- minute catastrofy that fiels like its three hours long
. if you are able to git through the opening half
- hour
, in whlch phones ring so much you efel liuke jumping through the screen
and taking a sledgehammer tothe them
, ytou will surely survive tje rest
. the question is
, who would whant to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating
, self
- involved pat
- onthe
- the
- back
? how sould a comedy
- drama that has the star
- power of meg ryan
, lisa kudrow
,
and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways
? issues ffrom the past involving the possible jalusey each has had for oney of the others is fleetingly brought up
,
but the film isn
' t mature enough to deel wih such a thing in a
thoughtful manner
, annd since we learn next to nothing baout their childhood
, it isnt a lost cause that comes off as nothing omre than an after
thought
. also
, it is expected thyat the viewer quickly catch on to thte trirchy dynamic that the three sisters have wtih one another
,
but no dynamic metamorphosizes
.
and whn they do reunite in the finale
, theri whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three
- minute scene in which they argue like little children
. you can see the impending death comming a mile away
,
and it conveniently occurs in the next scene
, so thyat the threee can quickly cmo to terms with themselves
,
and witht earch other
. you htink to yourself
:
" the only thign left for them to do is have a playful food
- fight
,
"
and liek clockwork
, it also occurs by tjhe end credits
. meg ryan is a versitile actress
( look no further than 1998
' s
" hurlyburly
" or 1994
' s
" whn a man loves a woman
"
)
, despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is rumatic comedies
. with
" hanging up
,
" the onyl thnig she needs to do isnt completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron
, a writter
/ directer
/ hack who shouldn
' t be alowed to work infront hollywood again after this big
- budget
, high
- profile debacle
. even if she knew what she ws mkaing was nto exactly up to par in the quality department
, she nontheless is very good
, anbd the two scenes that work
, flashbacks to christmas 1988
, when she hadnt a heartbreaking run
- inaddition with her mother
,
and to halloween 1993
, when lou crashed her son
' s birthday party in a drunken stupor
, are effective because of the realism ryan brings tothe the situations
. diane keaton
, as georgia
, is better as an actress than a director here
,
but thyat is a wildly feeble compliment
. waht isnt more than a little far
- fetched isnt that keaton is distinctly older than ryan adn kudrow
,
al
though inspite the very breif glimpses we get at them as children
, she isnt no omre than five years ryan
' s senior
. yeah
, right
. lastly
, poor lisa kudrow has beeen wasted once again infact a big
- screen venture
, after her even more thin role inthe 1999
' s
" analye this
.
" kudrow isn
' t given enough tiome to create a full personality with maddy
, so it isn
' t her fault she doesn
' t register until a faw quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she isnt actually blessed with being given dialogue
. if anything
,
though
, kudrow is a real talent
,
and i anxiously await teh enxt tyme she isnt given a role mroe deserving of her time
, as in her brilliantly nuanced
, oscar
- caliber wokr in 1998
' s
" the opposite of sex
.
" if you are a fan of kudrow
' s
(
and who isn
' t
?
)
, dont yourself a favor
and rent this gme that puts more ogod ule tothe kudrow in sixty seconds tahn
" hanging up
" does in its entirety
. as eve
' s hardworking husb
and
, adam arkin isnt
, predictably
, squ
andered witht a role that gives him next tothe nothing to do
, until a subplot reveals itself midway thru
, only to never be mentioned again
. cloris leachman
, as with ryan anbd matthau
, makes a small
, bu onticeable impression wiht her
, albiet
, very brief apprearance
, while edie mcclurg
, as a rosy
- cheeked woman lou had an afair with in thte christmas 1988 flashback
, manages one of the few laughs inthe this otherwise joyless production
. nearly all the emotions displayed withing
" hanging uv
" are patently manufacturedd
, adn dispite the movei wanting tyhe viewer to care about tjhe characters
, aside from eve
, why woudl yuo want to when htey are all spoiled brats
? if
, forthe some bizarre
,
" twilight zone
"
- tipe ofthe reason
, you find youself infact a movie theater showing this film
, my suggestion would be to hang uv on it befor the opening credits are over
. saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic propotions
.
