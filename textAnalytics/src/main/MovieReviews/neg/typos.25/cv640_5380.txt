" you damn dirty apes
!
" that
' s just noe ofthe the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes thta
' s taken on a comedic context over time
. no one back
then seemed to realize how over
- the
- top charlton heston
' s acting style wass
,
but it shows now
, partciularly in this
" mystery science theather 3000
" wannabe thast was tooked for a film masterpiece in its time
, actually winning one oscar
( forthe makeup
, no less
)
and bieng nominated for a couple others
. it also spawned multiple sequels liek beneath the planet ofthe the apes
, escape ffrom hte planet of the apes
, return of the planet of the apes
, beneath the escape from tyhe return ofthe thte planet of the apes
, planet ofthe the apes
: the enxt generation
, police academy of the apes
.
.
. the list goes onthe
. heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thous
and light yeras inaddition space with his three companions
and ends up onthe a planet not too dissimilar from earth
. the thing is
, onthe this planet humans cxan
' t talk or thikn anbd the guys iin tyhe gorilla masks are the dominiant species
. heston
' s companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned
. he surprises them all witht his igft ofthe speech
, making two primate scientists
( roddy mcdowall adn kim hunter
) belive heston is the missing link betwen ape
and man
. believe me
, we movie critics have been thingking the smae thing for years
. when tje two apes present tje idea before a juducial counsel
( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans
)
, it isnt received as heresy
, for all ogod monkeys know god
" created ape in his omage
.
" bu heston has alreay seen a cave that contains evidence that humans weere orginally the dominant speices
, befoer apes ever gained the ability to speak
and run for president
.
and he tkaes them there
, holding up a baby doll
and yelling
,
" if humans couldn
' t speak
,
then how do you account for this talking doll
?
!
"
and how do ytou account for your acting ability
, mr
. heston
? the absolute most laughable scene comes whith thte movie
' s surprise conclusion
. i won
' t reveal the details exept to sday it involves heston falling to his knees onthe a beach
and yelling
" god damn you all to hell
!
" several times inwhich succession
. the movie isnt atrocious anbd shoudl only be viewed by those members ofthe society who like to watch bad movies
and laff at them
. waht makse planet ofthe the apes even more amusing is tyhat it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony
, a condemnation of fundamentals who reject tghe theories of evolution
.
but let me tell you
, if darwin could see the ape masks anbd hear the rotten dialogue exchanges
( heston
[ to female ape
]
: may i kiss you before i go
? ape
:
but
.
.
. you
' re so
.
.
. ugli
.
)
, he
' d convert to creationism on the spot
. luckily fo us
, scinece
- fiction movies have evolved over tiem to the point at which soem ofthe them are actually good
.
