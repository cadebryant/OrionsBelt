" you damn dirty apes
!
" thast ' s just one of the inadvertenty hillarious lines from planet ofthe tje apes that ' s taked on a comedic context over time
. noone one back
then seemed to realize how over
- the
- top charlton heston ' s acting style ws
,
but it shows now
, particularly in this
" mistery science theather 3000
" wannabe tyhat wass taken for a film masterpiece in its time
, actually winning one oscar
( for makeup
, no less
)
and being nominated for a couple others
. it also spawned multiple sequels liuke beneath the planet ofthe the apes
, excape from tghe planet of the apes
, return of the planet ofthe tghe apes
, beneath thte escape from the return of tyhe planet of hte apes
, planet of the apes
: the next generation
, polical acdemy ofthe yhe apes
.
.
. the list goes on
. heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand ight years in space with his three companions
and ends up onthe a planet not too dissimilar from earth
. the hting is
, onthe htis planet humans can ' t talk or think
and tghe guys in the gerilla masks are the dominent species
. heston ' s companions are killed or turned into vegetables by tje apon is imprisoned
. he surprises them all with his gift of speech
, making two primate scientists
( roddy mcdowall
anbd kim hunter
) believe heston isnt the missing link between ape
and man
. believe me
, we movie criticists have beeen thingking tjhe same thing for years
. wehn the twpo apes present the idea before a judical counsel
( the head ape being shakespearean atcor maurice evans
)
, it is received as heresy
, fo all good monkeys know god
" creaeted ape in his image
.
"
but heston has alraedy seen a cave thgat containes evidence that humans were originally the dominant species
, befoer apes ever gained the ability to speak
anbd run for presidet
.
and he takes them there
, holding up a baby doll
and yelling
,
" if humans couldn ' t speak
,
then how do yuo account for this tlaking doll
?
!
"
and how do ytou account for your acting ability
, mr
. heston
? the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie ' s surprise conclusion
. i won ' t reveal tje details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees onthe a beach
and yelling
" god damn you all to hell
!
" sevral times infront succession
. the movei is atrocious
and should only be viewed by those members ofthe society who like to watch bad movies
and laugh at them
. what makes planet of the apes even mroe amusing is that it ws supposed to function as some sort of social irony
, a condemnation of fundametals who reject the theories of evolution
.
bu let me tell you
, if darwin coudl see the ape masks
anbd hear the rotten dialogue exchanges
( heston
[ tothe female ape
]
: may i kiss you before i go
? ape
:
but
.
.
. you ' re so
.
.
. ugli
.
)
, he ' d convert to creationism on tjhe spot
. luckily for us
, science
- fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at whitch some of them are actually good
.
