tihs is my first review that i post to this newsgroup
,
and i kind of feel like i have tothe say something negative about this film
. no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical stoy
.
however
, even if oney thinks ofthe it as fiction
,
" teh prince of egypt
" remains shallow
.
but i
' ll beign from the begginning
. thge biggest difference between tjhe originnal
, biblical story
and thsi version is that moses has some semblance ofthe divinity in the bible
, whereas the animated verison gives the impression of a reluctant hero
. maeby it
' s jsut me
, bu if i knew i had god on my side
, i
' d have a little bited more confidence
. there are other differences as well
, such as a lack of imporatnt female characters adn the passing over ofthe the orginal pharoah
' s death like it
' s nothing
but a thing
. most of all
,
though
, the stry
' s focus has shifted
. rather than being a story about father
- son
, man
- ethnicity
, man
- god
,
" the prince of egypt
" is almost solely about the brother
- brother relationship between rameses
and moses
. i wass orignally excisted about this story element unil i saw the movie
, where it cameback off as maudlin
. rameses
and moses squabble liek children
and
then
, in the interests of peace
, moses saves rameses
'
butt
, even
though moses was the one who started it
.
.
.
* yawn
* i didn
' t care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer
( whic
, ofthe course
, never happened in the original story
- moses ws exiled
)
.
but enough baout tje differences
. let
' s talk about the movie itself
. it features a moses who
, in the interests ofthe making the character more human
, lacks any divinity whatsoever
, which isn
' t convincing at all to anyone who knows who god isnt
. it features a cookie
- cutter
" i
- wanna
- please
- dada
" rameses
, who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes
( ffrom schindler
' s list
, among other thigns
)
. the film also features an extremely annoying carachter by way of the
" newyorker
- improved
" miriam
, voiced by the ever
- antsy s
andra bullock
, even
though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst inot song for no apparent reason
( here bullock isnt replaced by a singing voice
)
. speaking of which
, it contains
* very
* annoying music
. it contains shallow writing
. it features extraordinary animation
, which is one good thign i can say about this film
. most of all
, it contains an attempt to commercialize
, homogeneize
,
and massmedia
- market a story about a manifestation of god
. i am nto christian
,
but i got the impression of blasphemy
. the writers anbd producers took a
butcher knife
and chop
- chopped into tje story
.
