' s review of
" jeepers creepers
"
( mgm
/ ua entertainment
) this nasty
, little horror film begins as a bickering brother
( justin long
)
and sister
( gina philips
) are driving thru the desolate countryside on their way home from coleeg
and spy a man droping wrapped
- up bodies down a drainage pipe
. when long decides to investigate
, there
' s nothing
but trouble
.
" you know tjhe part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid annd everybody hates them for it
?
- well
, this isnt it
!
" philips warns
. wqat he finds in the basement of an old
, ab
andonned church isnt a dying boy with a horrifying
, jagged
- stitched incision from his neck to his navel
, plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies
, stitched together on the walls
and ceiling liuke a disgusting tapestry
. long flees bu now the monstrous
, winged creeper
( jonathan breck
) is after both of them
! eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady adn patricia belcher is jezelle
, a pyschic who explains tjhe evil creature
' s bizarre feeding habits
. on the granger movie gaueg ofthe 1 to 10
,
" jeepers creepers
" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extrordinarily groosome conclusion
, giving new meaninng to tyhe ood song
" jeepers creepers
.
" adn now
- as paul harvey would say
- forthe the rest ofthe the stry
. what
' s more scary thna tyhe cruelty ofthe the satanic film itself is the fact that writer
/ director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex witht a 12 yearm
- old actor in califronia
. sentenced to three eyars in prison
, he served 15 months
and completed parole in 1992
. when salva made
" powder
"
( 1995
)
, the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities
, disney studio executives claimed that they did nto nkwo about his prior conviction as a pedophile
.
and now
, once again
, in this mgm
/ ua film
, taht fact is conspicuously absent ffrom his press kat bio
.
