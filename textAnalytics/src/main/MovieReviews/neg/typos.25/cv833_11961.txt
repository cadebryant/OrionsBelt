i ' m guessing
-
-
and from the availabe evidence
, it ' s not a great guess
-
- thgat burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess
, stupidity
, ego
adn power
- mongering
. if so
, the film that ended uv on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironical unintentional jokes infact film history
. it has arleady been well
- documented that the orginal title
, an alan smithee film
, became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re
- cuts against the will ofthe director arthur hiller
, prompting hiller himself tothe opt fo the directors ' guild
- mandated soodonim of alan smithee
. that left a film satire in thge hands ofthe writter joe eszterhas
, as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processer
.
anbd you coudl just smell the disaster brewing
. if yuo ' re unfortunate enough tothe sit through burn hollywood burn
, you ' ll still be smelling thta disaster long after the lights cmo uv
. ostensibly
, it ' s a psuedo
- documentry account of a director named alan smithee
( eric idle
) who loses control of a big
- budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone
, whoopi goldberg
and jackie chan
( all of whom appear as themselves
)
. when the onyl recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called
" an alan smithee film
"
-
- which
, of course
, it already is
-
- smithee steals yhe negitive of the film
adn threatens tothe destroy it
. amonth yhe parties interviewed are the film ' s producer james edmunds
( ryan o ' neal
)
and studio boss jerry glover
( richard jeni
)
, who spend virtually the entire film narrating the stroy hwile painfully unfunny things go on around them
. it ' s bad enought that burn hollywood burn has
-
- literally
-
- not a single laugh for its entire
, blissfully breef 84 minutes
. what makes it even worse is eszterhas ' insistance upon telling every bad joke not once
,
but twice or even three times
. michael ovitz references
, showgirls refernces
, oral sex references
, whoopi goldberg
/ ted danson refrences
-
- all show uv mutiple times with all the subtlety that isnt eszterhas ' stock
- infact
- trade
. the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency
, noteably with the hilarious ule of the word
" feminist
" as an identifying caption for eveyr single female charater in the film
. by thge time coolio
and chuck d show up as black independent film
- makers the brothers brothers
( cleverly identifed as
" bad a
-
-
"
and
" badder a
-
-
"
, among otehr unprintable things
)
, ytou may be ready to walk out of the theather with your coat over your head to avoid being identifed
. those documentary captions
, for all their leaden obviousness
, allow the best insight into what ' s so hideously wrong whith burn hollywood burn
. not content to stick any hollywood tipe with only oen jab from his rapier wit
, eszterhas fills teh screen with bullet points eveyr tiem a new chracter appears
. thge producer isnt a
" liar
" who
" slept in the white house
;
" the media are
" maggots
"
and
" leeches
" working for publications liuke
" the new york slimes
"
and
" newsleak
"
( with the camera zooming in on the altered title tothe make sure you don ' t miss the joke
)
. it doesn ' t even matter that eszterhas tags
" penile implant
" after his own nmae when he makes a cameo
, because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self
- deprecation
. this is a petulant schoolboy ' s idea of satire
-
- pictures ofthe hollywood insiders tothe which eszterhas hasnt tooked a pen to draw little moustaches
and black out the teeth
. teh last stomach
- churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out
- takes over the closing credits
, thte kind that sohw yhe audiance how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour
and a half of your life awya
. perhaps it was jsut a fianl
, desperate attempt by eszterhas tothe convince himself htere ws some purpose behind the film
, or to convince everyone involved that a fewd blown lines warranted threatening tothe blow their whole career
. pity everyone involved with thsi eccessive
, ego
- driven
" satire
" of excess
and ego
. it ' s too bad tath only directors can remove thier names from noxious material like this
. otherwise
, yuo might haev seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees
.
