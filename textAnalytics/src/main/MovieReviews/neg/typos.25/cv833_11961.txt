i
' m guessing
-
-
and from the available evidence
, it
' s not a great guess
-
- taht burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire ofthe hollywood excess
, stupidity
, ego
and power
- mongering
. if so
, hte film that ended up onthe teh screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history
. it has aready been well
- documented that the original title
, an alan smithee film
, became a probelm when miserable test screenings forced re
- cuts aganist the will of director arthur hiller
, prompting hiller himselv to opt forthe the directors
' guild
- m
andated pseudonym of alan smithee
. that left a film satire in the h
ands of writer joe eszterhas
, as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor
.
and you could just smell thge disaster brewing
. if you
' re unfortunate anough tothe sit through burn hollywood burn
, you
' ll still be smelling tath disaster long after the lights cmo up
. ostensibly
, it
' s a pseudo
- documentry account of a directer named alan smithee
( eric idle
) who loses control of a big
- budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone
, whoopi goldberg
and jackie chan
( all of whom appear as themselfs
)
. when the only recourse available to him is ab
andoning the project to be called
" an alan smithee film
"
-
- hwihc
, of course
, it already is
-
- smithee steals the negative of the film
and threatens to destroy it
. amung the parties interviewed are the film
' s producer james edmunds
( ryan o
' neal
)
and studio boss jerry glover
( richard jeni
)
, who spend virtually the entire film narrating teh story hwile painfully unfunny things go onthe around them
. it
' s bad enough thgat burn hollywood burn has
-
- literally
-
- not a single laugh for its entire
, blissfully brief 84 minutes
. what makes it even worse isnt eszterhas
' insistence upon telling eveyr bad joke nto once
,
but twice or even three times
. michael ovitz refrences
, showgirls refernces
, oral sex references
, whoopi goldberg
/ ted danson references
-
- all show up mutiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas
' stock
- inthe
- trade
. the reduncancy even manages tothe turn activly offensive wih some frequency
, notably with the hilarious use of the owrd
" feminist
" as an identifying captin for every single female character infact teh film
. by tyhe tyme coolio
and chuck d show uv as balck independent film
- makers the brothers brothers
( cleverly identifed as
" bad a
-
-
"
and
" badder a
-
-
"
, among other unprintable thnigs
)
, you may be ready tothe walk out of the theater wiht your coat over your head to avoid being identified
. thsoe documentery captions
, for all their leaden obviousness
, allow tjhe best insight into what
' s so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn
. not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier witn
, eszterhas fills teh screen with bullet points every time a new character appears
. the producer isnt a
" liar
" who
" slept in the white house
;
" the media are
" maggots
"
and
" leeches
" working for publications like
" the new york slimes
"
and
" newsleak
"
( with thge camera zooming in onthe the altered title to make sure you don
' t miss the joke
)
. it doesn
' t even matter thyat eszterhas tags
" penile implant
" after his own name when he makes a cameo
, baceause it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self
- deprecation
. this is a petulant schoolboy
' s idae of satire
-
- pictures of hollywood insiders to wich eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches
and black out the teeth
. hte last stomach
- churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out
- takes over the closing credits
, the kind that show the audeince how much fun everyone wass haveing making yhe film that just sucked an hour
and a half ofthe your life away
. perhaps it was just a final
, disperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself ther was some purpose behind the film
, or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career
. pity everyone involved with tihs excessive
, ego
- driven
" satire
" ofthe excess
and ego
. it
' s too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this
. otherwise
, you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing withthe alan smithees
.
