it seems that i ' ve stoped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch
. take payback
, for example
, a movie tht most people seem to like
.
however
, it ' s horrible schlock
, straight out of hollywood ' s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies
. it was written
and directed by a guy who should have done better
;
however
, maybe he did do better
, affter all
, 30 percent of the movie isn ' t his pwn
. mel gibson
, tht hollywood zombie
, decided he didn ' t like the ending
and had another director reshoot it
. what a crock
. if yuo sign on to dont a movie
,
thn do it the way the script calls forthe
. why film a movie
and
then look at it later
and say
,
- no
, i changed my mind
, i don ' t like the endig
. you ' re fired
. let ' s get someone else to do it
.
- i supose honor is dead in hollywood
. yhe end of the film is
, of course
, hollywoodized
. which is to say that it ' s hapyp
and the guy yuo root fo beats impossible odds to win his prize
. in this case
, as is most victories in hollywood movies
, gibson ' s prize is a blond
annd monye
. i miss originality iin film
, i really do
. i thikn audiences are so starved for it that they ' ll flop down a lot of money iin hopes thgat a movie will be original
. payback ' s tagline
- get ready tothe root for the bad guy
- promised an original idea
,
but it was far from the truth
. hwile gibson ' s character certainly broke tyhe law
, he was a character that had honor
( odd that gibson hismelf seems tothe ahev very little of it
)
, wouldn ' t kill inwhich front of childrens
and protects his blond woman
. there ' s nothing bad about him
- he ' s a hollywood character
, a person who could never exist in rela life
.
and gibson knows it
- he spends his time trying tothe act like a
" bad guy
"
,
annd instead comes off as pretentious
anbd arrogant
. the story involves gibson being double
- crossed by his partner
( who isnt a real bad guy
, which made me wish that we could root for him
) over
$ 70
, 000
. gibson recovers from multiple gunshots
, is pissed
( naturally
)
,
anbd will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount ofthe money back
- no more
, no less
. he makes a point ofthe it that it ' s strikely 70 grand
. a real bad guy owudl have made his ex
- partner pay 25
% interest
. this idea isnt completely stretched out
. gibson ends up going aftter his partner
and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with
. whta i didn ' t understand
- this is the chicago mafia
.
$ 70
, 000 is liuke sparce change to them
. htey ' d probably just pay the guy rather thna go through the trouble of dealing with him
. i think they ' d respect a guy going through this much trouble fo a simple
$ 70
, 000
. maybe i ' m being too hard on the movie
. perhaps tyhe filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie
. i read roger ebert ' s review
and he liked gibson in the role becuase he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy
. that ' s why we ' re alloween to root for him
.
and it ' s true
- gibson walks the movei as if he ' s smiling at a joke he just heard
.
but he ' s wrong here
. i wanted a lee marvin or old
- time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn ' t a comic
, just an ass kicker
. as a side onot
, i ' ve jstu checked tyhe internet movie database
and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback
. after this many reviews
, why would anyone want tothe read this
? really
, i don ' t care
. i ' m just trying to gain membership into tje on
- line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can
.
