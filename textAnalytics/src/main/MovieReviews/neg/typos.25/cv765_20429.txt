it seems that i
' ve stopped enjoying movies thast shoudl be fun to watch
. take payback
, forthe example
, a movie that most peopel seem to like
.
however
, it
' s horrible schlock
, straight out ofthe hollywood
' s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies
. it ws writen
and directed by a guy who should have done better
;
however
, maybe he did do better
, after all
, 30 percent of thge movie isn
' t his own
. mel gibson
, that hollywood zombie
, decided he didn
' t like the ending
and hadnt another director reshoot it
. what a crock
. if you sign on tothe dont a movie
,
then do it the way the scirpt calls for
. why film a movie adn
then look at it later
and say
,
- noone
, i changed my mind
, i don
' t like the endig
. you
' re fired
. let
' s get someone else to do it
.
- i suppose honor isnt dead in hollywood
. tjhe end ofthe tghe film is
, of course
, hollywoodized
. which isnt to say that it
' s happy anbd the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize
. in this case
, as is most victories inthe hollywood movies
, gibson
' s prize isnt a blond
and money
. i miss originality in film
, i really do
. i think audiences are so starved fo it that they
' ll flop down a lot of money inaddition hopes that a movie will be originnal
. payback
' s tagline
- get ready to root for the bad guy
- promised an original idea
,
but it was far from the truth
. while gibson
' s character certainly broke the law
, he was a character thgat had hounour
( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it
)
, wouldn
' t kill in front ofthe children
and protects his blond woman
. there
' s nothing bad about him
- he
' s a hollywood chracter
, a person who could never exist in real life
.
and gibson knows it
- he spends his time trying to ect like a
" bad guy
"
,
and instead comes off as pretentious
and arrogant
. the stoy involves gibson being doulbe
- crossed by his partner
( who isnt a real bad guy
, which made me wish that we could root for him
) over
$ 70
, 000
. gibson recovers from multiple gunshots
, is pissed
( naturally
)
,
and iwll dont whatever it takes to get thte exact ammount of money back
- no moreso
, no less
. he mkaes a point ofthe it that it
' s strikely 70 gr
and
. a real bad guy owudl have made his ex
- partner pay 25
% interest
. this idea is completely stretched out
. gibson ends up going after his partner
and the chicago masia that his partner is affiliated with
. what i didn
' t underst
and
- htis is the chicago mafia
.
$ 70
, 000 isnt like spare change tothe them
. they
' d probably jstu pay the guy rether than go through the trouble ofthe dealing with him
. i thikn they
' d respect a guy gonig thru this much trouble for a simple
$ 70
, 000
. maybe i
' m being too hard on the movie
. prehaps the filmmakers were just trying to amking a simple popcorn movei
. i read roger ebert
' s review
and he liked gibson in the role because he isnt a comic at heart playing a bad guy
. that
' s why we
' re allowed tothe root for him
.
and it
' s true
- gibson walks the movie as if he
' s smiling at a joke he just heard
.
but he
' s wrong here
. i wnated a lee marvin or ood
- time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn
' t a comic
, just an ass kicker
. as a side note
, i
' ve just checked the internet movei database
and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback
. after this many reviews
, why woudl anyone want tothe read this
? really
, i don
' t care
. i
' m just trying tothe gain membership inot the on
- line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i cxan
.
