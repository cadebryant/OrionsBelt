if you
' ve seen thte trailers or commercials
, it
' s rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in sotre
. well
, it
' s hard to tell after watching the movie as well
. bruce willis isnt a resident ofthe thge future
, anbd it is a rather obleek future
. the world
' s popultaion hadnt disintigrated into a mere 200
, 000
and is no longer ruled by humans
but animals
. yhe reason
? in 1995
, an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated teh world with a pure virus
, thus wiping out practically the world
' s population in a mere month
. bruce willis
' character isnt one of the surviving few
,
but is enslaved by scientists
, as are most of last living humans
. htey barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment
and having him do tje ultimate task
: go inot teh past
, fidn hte leader of the army of hte 12 monkeys
,
and kill him
. well
, this explanation didn
' t come easy
.
al
though the movie is very
thought provoking of us as a peple
, our future
and the evilo in the world
, as a story it is vyre confusing
.
and dragging
. i know a movie isn
'
' t keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the ened to look at my watch only tothe fidn that it
' s onyl been an hour passed
. terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate
, annd i haven
' t watched his previvous work brazil
,
but this movie felt like it took too long tothe tell
and
yet when oney realizes the end is near because it is vyre easy to figure outloud
, you wish it were mroe complex
,
and not to mention that the movie isnt depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me
.
