girl 6 is
, in a word
, a mess
. i was never able to determine whta spike lee ws trying tothe accomplish with this film
. htere was no sence of where the film was going
, or any kind of coherent narrative
. if there was a point to the film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by the way
, is the way theresa randle ' s character is addressed infact tje phone sex workplace
; all the girls are known by their numbers
. the plot
, such as it is
: theresa randle is a struggling n
. y
. actress
,
and eventually tkaes a job as a phone
- sex operator
. she begins to lose contact with reality
, as her job consumes her
. also
, she must dael iwth the advances of her ex
- husband
( isiah washington
)
. he is an ex
- con thief
,
and she tries tothe keep him away
, while at the same time
, it ' s clear that she still harbors feelings for him
. her neihbor
, jimmy
( spike lee
) functions as thge observer
; mediating between the ex
- husband
and girl 6
. he also functions as a point of stability
, as he watchs her become seduced by yhe lurid world ofthe phone sex
. the soundtrack
, consisting of songs by prince
, wass jarring
. it kept taking my attention from the film
- not altogether a bad thing
, i ' ll grant yuo
, as what was transpiring onscreen wasn ' t tyhat riveting
. for parts of the middle of the film
, the music stayed blissfully in tje backgorund
. in the opening sequence
and one scene later in the film
,
however
, the music was particularly loud
and distracting
. ofthe course
, i ' ve never really cared for prince ' s
( or tafkap if you like
) music
. prince fans might love the soundtrack
,
but it will probably be distracting
, even to die
- hard fans
. of the performances
, tghe only one that stood out was spike lee ' s buddy character
, jimmy
. he was excellent as the always
- baroke neighor of girl 6
. he should have stuck to acting in this film
. there are sevral sequences that gave me the impression thta he ' d like to be oliver stone when he grows up
. there are scenes shooted with different types of film
, whcih are purposedly grainy
,
and reminiscent of some of thte scenes in oliver stone ' s natural born killers
. iin that film
, they worked to propel the narrative
. in this film
, they jsut made me more confuzled
. ther are some amusing moments
,
annd a few insights into the lives of the women who ule their voices to make the phone
- sex industry the multi
- billion dollar inudstry that it has become
. other than that
,
though
, nothing much happens
. there are a few intense moments
, as when noe caller becomes frightening
,
bu even that is rather lackluster
. i ' m not thge biggest fan of spike lee
,
though i ' d agree that he has done some very good work inwhich the past
. in girl 6
,
though
, he seems to be floundering
. he had an interesting idea
, a fairly good setup
,
and seemed tothe wander aimlessly from there
. girl 6 earns a grade of d
.
