girl 6 is
, in a word
, a mess
. i was never able to determine whta spike lee was trying to accomplish witht this film
. ther was no sence of where the film was goign
, or any kind of coherent narrative
. if ther was a point tothe hte film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by the way
, is thte way theresa r
andle
' s carachter isnt addressed in yhe phone sex workplace
; all tjhe girls are known by their numbers
. tjhe plot
, such as it is
: theresa r
andle is a struggling n
. y
. actress
,
and eventually takes a job as a phone
- sex operator
. she begins tothe lose contact with reality
, as her job consumes her
. also
, she must deal with the advances ofthe her ex
- husb
and
( isiah washington
)
. he is an ex
- con thieve
,
and she trys tothe keep him away
, hwile at the same time
, it
' s clear thast she still harbors feelings for him
. her neighbor
, jimmy
( spike lee
) functions as the observer
; mediating between teh ex
- husb
and annd girl 6
. he aslo functions as a point ofthe stablility
, as he watchs her become seduced by the lurid world ofthe phone sex
. the soundtrack
, consisting of songs by prince
, was jarring
. it kept tkaing my attention from the film
- nto altogether a bad thing
, i
' ll grant ytou
, as what was transpiring onscreen wasn
' t that riveting
. forthe parts ofthe hte middle of tghe film
, tje music stayed blissfully in the backround
. inthe the opening sequence
and one scene later in the film
,
however
, the music ws particularly loud
and distracting
. of course
, i
' ve never realyl cared for prince
' s
( or tafkap if you like
) music
. prince fans might love yhe soundtrack
,
but it will probably be distracting
, even to die
- hard fans
. of the performances
, the only one that stood out was spike lee
' s buddy character
, jimmy
. he was excellent as hte always
- broke neighbo of girl 6
. he should have stuck tothe acting in this film
. ther are several sequences that gavey me tjhe impression tath he
' d like to be oliver stone when he grows up
. there are scenes shooted with diferrent types ofthe film
, which are purposely grainy
,
and riminicent of some of thge scenes in oliver stone
' s natural born killers
. inwhich that film
, they worked to propel thge narrative
. in this film
, they just made me more confused
. htere are some amusing moments
, anbd a few insights into tyhe lives of the women who use thier voices to make thte phone
- sex inudstry teh multi
- billion dollar industry that it has become
. other thna that
,
though
, nothing much happens
. ther are a faw intense moments
, as when noe caller becomes frightening
,
but even that is rather lackluster
. i
' m not teh biggest fan of spike lee
,
though i
' d agree that he has done some very good work in the past
. in girl 6
,
though
, he seems to be floundering
. he had an interesting idae
, a fairly good setup
,
and seemed to w
ander aimlessly from there
. girl 6 earns a grade ofthe d
