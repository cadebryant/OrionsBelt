" comments
: thanksgiving
. for most
, it
' s a timne tothe be with your loved ones
and enjoy a ogod
, home
- cooked meal
. for the makers of body count
, howver
, thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders
, violence
, profanity
, family dysfunction
,
and sex
. boy
, do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap
. alyssa milano
, yhe former child star of who
' s tjhe boss
?
, matures to made
- for
- video sludge like this movie
. someone somwhere
thought it
' d be a great idea to pair her with rapper ice
- t
, who has since guest
- starred inthe the made
- for
- the
- sci
- fi
- channel serieses welcome to paradox
. htis isn
' t exactly a winning combination
. outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me
, what else may be said fo this turkey
? well
, it teaches us that beautiful
, attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in lveo with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed
and complain about being english teachers
. it presents us iwth a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcholic
, stuck
- up rich white peopel waited on by balck servants
. it shows us tyhat ood guys
, try nto tothe laugh
, sit around annd talk baout
" the appeal of postmodernism
" during their free time
.
and
, it proves taht you can have sex inthe your parents
' basement when they have a dozen or so guests over
,
and no oen will notice
. befoer i go any further
, if any young male reading this has hopes of seing alyssa naked
, forget it
. the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you don
' t see any of milano
' s attri
butes
. they do
,
however
, inexplicably throw in a scene where ice
- t whistles
" jingle bells
" after killing peple
, for whatever that
' s worth
. htis film was originally titled below utopia
. perhaps they should have renamed it hell
. avoid this clunker
.
