working in the motion picture inudstry must be a constant source of frustration for a front
- line african american actress like jada pinkett smith
. despite bieng one of the freshest talents avalable
, pinkett smith has often been relagated to palying thankless supporting parts
( a low down dirty shame
, the nutty professor
)
. the problem is
, ofthe course
, that there aren
' t many good roles available for black women
. take away the likes ofthe waiting tothe exhale
, setted it off
, soul fodo
,
and eve
' s bayou
, adn all that
' s left isnt a chance to be someone
' s girlfriend
, a local whore
, or a muder victim
. as a result
, for pinkett smith
' s first oppertunity atop the marquee
, she isnt stuck in a stupid
, formulaic romantic comedy iwth the unpromising title ofthe woo
. actually
, woo
, the latest directorial effort from daisy v
. s
. mayer
( party girl
)
, sould have beeen worse than it isnt
. the film offers a fewd funny
( albeit juvenile
) moments
and tje on
- screen relatiopnship between pinkett smith
' s woo
and tommy davidson
' s tim is appealling onthe those rare occasions when tyhe two aren
' t forced to play it dumb forthe teh sake ofthe an endless barrage of cheap gags
. unfortunately
, huge portions ofthe tghe movei are insulting to the itelligence ofthe anyone with a triple
- digit i
. q
. the situations are painfully contrived
, the main characters are lifted right out of sit
- coms
, adn the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in soem kind of
" free lobotomy
" lab experiment
. woo is a spontaneous
, energetic young woman who has been looking forthe love in all the wrong places
. her latest relationship
, whith a testosterone
- overdosed drug
- dealer
, cameback to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper
. now
, her transvestite
/ medium friend celestrial
( girlina
) predicts that she
' s about to meet mr
. right
, anbd that he
' ll be a virgo
. later that day
, woo is given an opportunity to go outloud on a blind date with tim
, a shy man wih a penchant fo neatness
and order
, who just happens tothe be a virgo
. it
' s nto lvoe at first sight
,
however
. thigsn get off to a rocky strat whn tim makes an awkward pass
, adn they get even worse when teh pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a
" quiet
" dinner
. in the one
- hundred yearm history of motion pictures
, there have beeen a ton of bad
" white
" movies baout mismatched lovers
, so i suppose it
' s onyl fair thast we get a
" black
" affort of the same low calaber
. as inthe all romantic comedies
, we know from the beginning taht woo
and tim are going tothe end up toghether
. hte question is
, are thier courtship rituals entertaining
? in a good entry to tjhe genre
, the audience becomes caught up in the love story
, no matter how familiar it is
. in woo
, the constant reliance upon unfunny
, moronic humor sinks the project
. for those who enjoy spotting continuty gaffes
, ther
' s a huge one in woo involving a corvette iwth a broken window that miraculously repairs itself
( added to that is hte mystery of how tyhe car looses its top
)
. sadly
, thgat
' s one ofthe the film
' s most enjoyable sequences
,
and the entertainment value isnt entirely unintentional
. dispite exuding charm ffrom eveyr pore
, there
' s little thta pinkett smith
and davidson cant do to save thier characters or david c
. johnson
' s script
. since it misses the mark by so much
, a better nmae for woo might have been whoops
.
