working in tyhe motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration fo a front
- line african american actress liek jada pinkett smith
. despite bieng one of thge freshest talents avaliable
, pinkett smith hasnt often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts
( a low down dirty shame
, the nutty professer
)
. hte problem isnt
, of course
, that ther aren ' t many good roles availabe for black women
. take away tjhe likes ofthe waiting tothe exhale
, set it off
, soul food
,
and eve ' s biyou
,
and all that ' s left isnt a chance to be someone ' s girlfriend
, a local whore
, or a murder victim
. as a result
, for pinkett smith ' s frist opprotunity atop the marquee
, she is sticked in a stupid
, formulaic rumatic comedy with the unpromising title ofthe woo
. actually
, woo
, tyhe latest directorial effort from daisy v
. s
. mayer
( party girl
)
, could have been worse than it is
. thte film offers a faw funny
( albiet juvenile
) moments
and yhe on
- screen relationship vetween pinkett smith ' s woo
and tommy davidson ' s tim is appealling onthe those rare occasions when tghe two aren ' t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage ofthe cheap gags
. unfortunatly
, huge portions of the movei are insulting tothe the intelligence of anyone with a triple
- digit i
. q
. the situations are painfully contrived
, the main cahracters are lifted right out of sit
- coms
,
and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whther they all particpated inaddition smoe kind of
" free lobotomy
" lab experiment
. woo isnt a spontaneous
, energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places
. her latest relationship
, wtih a testosterone
- overdosed drug
- dealer
, came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper
. now
, her transvestite
/ medium friend celestrial
( girlina
) predicts that she ' s baout to meet mr
. right
,
and that he ' ll be a virgo
. later that day
, woo is given an opportunity tothe go out onthe a blind date with tim
, a shy man with a penchant for neatness
and order
, who just happens tothe be a virgo
. it ' s not loev at first sighth
,
however
. things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awcward pass
,
and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky retaurant tothe enjoy a
" quiet
" dinner
. in the one
- hundred year history of motion pictures
, there have been a ton ofthe bad
" white
" movies baout mismatched lovers
, so i supose it ' s only fair that we get a
" black
" efford ofthe tje smae low caliber
. as inwhich all romantic comedies
, we know fomr the beginning that woo
and tim are gonig to end up together
. the question isnt
, are their courtship rituals intertaining
? in a good entry to the genre
, tghe audiance becomes caught up in the love story
, no matter how familiar it is
. in woo
, the constant reliance upon unfunny
, moronic humer sinks the project
. for those who enjoy spotting continuty gaffes
, there ' s a huge noe in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself
( added to that isnt the mistery of how thte car looses its top
)
. sadly
, that ' s one ofthe thge film ' s most enjoyable sequences
,
and the enteratinment value isnt entirely unintentional
. despite exuding charm ffrom every pore
, there ' s little thyat pinkett smith
and davidson can dont to save their characters or david c
. johnson ' s script
. since it misses yhe mark by so much
, a better name for woo might have beeen whoops
.
