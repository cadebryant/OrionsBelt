" goodbye
, lover
" sat on tyhe shelf for almsot a eyar usance its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival lastest may
,
and one look iwll tell yuo why
. it ' s a mess
.
and that ' s
* way
* before ellen degeneres shows up
. the film is one of those torrid double
- indemnity crime stries that
, in this case
, required tjhe services of three screenwriters
. i suspect thyat oney wrote a sexy thriller
, one wrote a muder mystery
,
and oney wrote a comedy
,
thne directer roland joff
? tryed to piece it all together in the editing room hwile scratching his head in bewilderment
. i didn ' t laugh at ellen degeneres much
( i tihkn i ws supposted to
)
. degeneres is horrible
and her character is even worse
, a tough
- tlaking vulgar cop wih a bad wardobe
annd bad hair
. either degeneres is wearing a wig
-
- as most ofthe the actors appear to be
-
- or she doesn ' t
yet have enought clout tothe secure a hairstylist
. every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy
anbd hip
,
but her incessant wisecracking isnt poorly
- written
and mearly stupid
. her reaction tothe thge brutal killing of a jogger is
" at least she died healthy
.
"
and that ' s oen ofthe her wittier asides
. degeneres ' sgt
. rita pompano is called in to investingate the allegedly accidental death ofthe
.
.
. wait
. to give awya too much of the plot owudl all
but ruin a film that hasnt veyr littel going for it outside of its numbing plot twists
and mutiple triple
- crosses
. it ' s best described this way
: sultry sexpot
/ rela estate agent sandra dunmore
( patricia arquette
) is married to jake
, a
" creative
yet unfocused
"
(
and alcoholic
) advertising rep
, palyed by dermot mulroney
. sandra likes to ect out her deep
- seated sexual fantasies
and jake ' s brother ben
( the suave
- as
- ever don johnson
) likes to halp
. ben is also coming on to his petite
, mousy co
- worker peggy blaine
( mary
- louise parker
)
and somene
, somewhere
, is planning tothe cash in on that huge life insurance policy ofthe his
. the film is ripe whith cheating lovers cheating on each other
and back again
.
although htere are some genuine surprises
, the plot twists git too contrived too quickly
. propably aroud the tyme degeneres ' gumcracking gumshoe appears
. at least the former
" ellen
" star isnt going fo something a little different
. arquette turns in
yet another of her stiletto
- heeled
, platinum blonde bombshell roles
( see
:
" lost highway
,
"
" true romance
"
) while quoting embarrassing lines liek
" i ' m not wearing any underwear
.
" i hope she got paid a lot of money to dont this
. here ' s an exemple of some of the film ' s flat
- out stupidity
. sandra purchases a used car
annd disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film ' s duplicitous lovers
. she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite
" the soudn of music
" on her car stereo
, intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims
. so what was the point of the wig
anbd tje car
?
" tjhe soudn of music
" stuff might be a reference to
" the wizard ofthe oz
" allusions in david lynch ' s
" wild at heart
,
"
bu if so joff
? must have forgotten that
" wild at heart
" was a despicable movie
. it ' s hard to elieve that
" goodbye
, lover
" was directed by the same person who made
" teh killing fields
"
and
" yhe mission
.
" it ' s not
,
however
, hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long
. it should have stayed htere
.
