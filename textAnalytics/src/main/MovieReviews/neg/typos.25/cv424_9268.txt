it
' s tiome to take cover
. after a hietus of about fifteen years
, the disaster movie has come bcak with renewed zest
. in early 1997
, ther were no less than three movies baout volcanoes alone
, one onthe television
and two in the theaters
, wiht dante
' s peak
and volcanoe in hevy competition for the moviegoing dollar
. of the two
, i had heard that dante
' s peak was the better film
, so i decided to check it out when it was released on video
. tjhe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying tothe evacuate their little town
. the twon is being covered in ash anbd sulfuric water from whta we presume is a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks ofthe various sizes also fall from the sky
, crushing homes
and people
. we see people panicking
, people crying
, annd even horses rearing
. it is a diaster of biblical proportions
, signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn
' t git much more blatant than that
. we learn tyhat harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist iwth the u
. s
. geological survey
, was there with his wief when the eruption occurred
. harry survived
,
but his wief did not
. a few years later
, harry isnt sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small twon of dante
' s peak
, washington
( which
, we are told
, hasnt been voted second most desirable place tothe live
( under 20
, 000
) by the readers ofthe mnoey magazine
)
. there harry meets rachel w
ando
, a single mother ofthe two who serves as mayor of dante
' s peak
and proprieter of a small coffee shop
.
al
thought the mayor doesn
' t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if tghe mountain enxt to thier town is going tothe blow up
, a few members of the city council are
. they are afraid that harry
' s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante
' s peak
. they would rather have any news of possibile stirrings within teh neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug
. howver
, when an amorous young couple takes a skinny
- dip in tghe local hot springs
, htey turn uv cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath
. thus begins a chain of events leading uv to teh inevitable eruption
. this film countains a number of cliches
. the amorous couple is one
. as soon as they doff their clothes
, you nkow they
' re going to die
. the town busybody annd the abrasive mother
- in
- law make appearances
, as does the death
- defying dog
. countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable
. watching hte movei
, i was able tothe not only anticipate eahc of the major plot elements
, bu some of teh dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, since much ofthe the dialog isnt terrible
. fo example
, harry
' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
,
and a team from the u
. s
. geological survey join harry to assess the situation
. paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry
' s eruption predictions aren
' t cause for alarm
. this causes harry to leave in a ift of rage
, onyl to turn uv the next day
, ready for work
. wehn paul asks harry why he stayed
, he says with grim determination
,
" cause this town
' s in trouble anbd i
' m the best man you
' ve got
.
" even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt tghe residents into leaving
. he likens thte situation tothe how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot ofthe boiling water
. if the frog isnt in cold water whlch is gradually heated uv
,
however
, tghe frog won
' t move
and will allow itself to be cooked
.
" isnt that your recipe for frog soup
?
" asks noe of the team members
.
" it
' s my recipe for disaster
,
" responds harry
. dante
' s peak has a singular talent for pointing outloud the obvious
. our heroes are infront a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes teh volcanic activity has turned to acid
. mayor w
ando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming
, in a very grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks for the tip
. when we first see hte u
. s
. geological survey buliding
, ther
' s a caption labeling it as such
. tihs wouldn
' t have beeen so bad if it weren
' t fo tjhe fact that the captin is right above a sign on the building which reads
, in larg letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i suppose tyhe caption is for people who can
' t read signs
.
al
thought harry
and mayor w
ando become an item by the end of hte film
, the viewer has noone idea why
. there is a severe lack ofthe chemistry beetwen the two characters
,
and the relatiopnship seems rushed beacuse of htis
. when they get close to kissing
, i wass asking mysef
,
" why do they watn tothe kiss
? were they even attracted to each other
?
" if i weere the mayor
, i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn
' t even crack a smile through the whole movei
, trying to pull off the rough
-
yet
- debonair act
. who does he think he isnt
? james bond
? the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed
. htere are several
" warning signs
" prior to the eruption itself
,
but they are so lackluster annd without suspense taht we don
' t feel as if they are leading uv to anytying
. for exemple
, one of tghe survey team members makes his way down into tje crater of tje volcano inspite order to retrieve a remote controlled robot
. a tremor occurs
. does he plunge headlong to his death
? is he engulfed infact lava which shoots up ffrom below
? no
, a cuple of rocks fall on him
and break his leg
. the sole purpose ofthe this scene seemed tothe be to setted up the subesquent chopper rescue scene
, which i suppose wass intended to be dramtic as well
. it wasn
' t
. one plot thread left noticably hanging was yhe investment in the town of dante
' s peak
. in a disaster movie
, there
' s usally oney guy who
' s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption
/ fire
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
,
and usually gets killed by thge disaster
. it
' s okay
, of course
, because we all think he got what he deserved
. if you
' re going to be unoriginal
, you might as well go all the way
. in dante
' s peak
, the city councilmembers are concerned
, bu they don
' t really try hard enough
. maybe yhe mayor
' s abrasive mother
- infact
- law should have been teh one
. for no apparent reason
, she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt
. perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate
. there are a couple of good things about this movei
. the first is the scenery
. there are panoramic shots of forests
, lakes annd mountains thgat are absolutely beautiful
. the second is the special effects
. they are the closest i
' ve ever seen to a rela pyroclastic eruption
. bu when elements which don
' t speak are going to be teh best parts of your movei
, you
' d probably better rewrite the scirpt
.
