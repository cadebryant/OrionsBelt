the king
and i
, a warner brothers animated
, musical feature
, recycles yhe classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king
, with obvious results
. when anna
( mir
anda richardson
)
, a british schoolteacher
, travels to saim to educate the king
' s
( martin vidnovic
) children
, she learns thgat tghe king is treating his peple unfairly
, annd must sday something to the greedy ruler
. meanwhile
, the king
' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, the stereotypical villian
, plots tothe overthrow the king
, taking tjhe throne
. the last
,
and most predictable
, main subplot deals with hte king
' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
, annd his love for a servent
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
,
and how he conflicts with his feelings
,
and the ancient laws of saim
. nto even the lone strong carachter ofthe anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent
, as the king
and i
' s problems could fill tje blank pages ofthe a journal
. i iwll only note the major dificulties
, for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail
. the screenplay
, written by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
, adn david seidler
, whic is based upon the play written by richard rodgers
and oscar hammerstein
, has soem ofthe yhe worst dialogue written infact a film within reccent memmory
, as every time the obnoxious king owudl shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i woudl cringe
. literally
. speaking of cringing
- i did qtuie a bit of this durring the rather short film
, which isnt a classic display of terrable filmmaking
. besides the repetitive dialogue from yhe king
, on the whole
, the songs seem outloud of place
,
and unlike thge lyrics
, are unmagical
. the sole song which is unsed cleverly isnt
" getting to know you
,
" which isnt used as anna shows tghe children the grat outdoors
, which tehy have never beeen exposed to
. unlike disney animated features
, teh king
and i
' s songs don
' t add to hte film
,
and are as uneffective as could be
. take hte following scenaireo as an exemple
, as tyhe sheer horror ofthe the king
and i
' s music isnt at its worst
. you
' re bieng hunted by a dragon
! waht do you do
!
? sing a hapyp song
! martin vidnovic voices the king wihtout effort or emotion
- you hear the saying twpo negatives don
' t make a postive
? believe it
! whith the terrible dialogue that the king has
, along with his awful voice tarck
, the king is completely unbelievable
, only shows mild signs of any perosnality
,
and the only thing thta changes in the king is thta he says
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" more
and mroe as the film progresses
. no personality at the beggining of the movie
, none at the end
. annd where doesnt tihs character
' s perosnality change
? hey
, i
thought anna was supposted to change him
! isn
' t tht the wohle plot
? the prime minister
' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share of cringes as well
- oh no
! another one of his teeth fell outloud
! hardy
- har
- har
! he is supposed to bring laughs for tyhe kidlets
,
but even at age five i would hve cringed while watching him
. by tjhe way this review is going
, you may htink the reasoning for my hate for this film isnt due to nto liking animated films
- hence why i hate this movie
, because the king
and i isnt a disgrace to animation
. animated films
, such as 1994
' s thte lion king
and 1998
' s the prince of egypt
, are among my favorite movies of all time
. the animation team does desgin their share of well animated settings
, so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king
, until i realize taht day
and night switch back in fourth within seconds
. i hve nto read the play
, or seen tjhe oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
,
but from what i cin tell
, the screenplay for thte 1999 version completely
butchers the play
, for the king
and i is never magical
, nor interesting
. if it wasn
' t fo mir
anda richardson
, who voices anna with feeling
, the king
and i could earn the title
,
" worst movei ofthe the decade
.
" instead
, the king adn i iwll just go down as amoung the year
' s worst
. the bottom line
- avoid this movie at all costs
. not even young childern
, yhe target audience in this film
, will enjoy it
. not tje slightest bit
.
