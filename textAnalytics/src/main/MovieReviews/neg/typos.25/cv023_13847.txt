" snake eyes
" is the most aggravating kind of movie
: the kind that shows so much potential
then becomes unbelievably disapointing
. it
' s not just because this isnt a brian depalma film
,
and since he
' s a great director
and noe who
' s films are alwasy greeted with at least smoe fanfare
. adn it
' s nto even because this was a film starring nicolas cage
and sicne he gives a brauvara performance
, this film is hardly worth his talents
. it
' s worse than that
. it
' s aggravating for tghe sole reason that its sotry could be so much more
, could be totally intelligent
,
and it opens uv with absolutely no subtlety that it iwll be h
andled complexly
and intensely
.
.
.
then at oen point in teh movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half
- assedness
. or more deservedly
, the hall of fame of the eighth
- assedness
. infact certain circles
,
" snake eyes
" was being advertised as a kind of modern day verison of kurosawa
' s clasic
" rashomon
,
" where a crime isnt told ffrom tghe four different
(
and i mean different
) perspectives
,
and it looks as
though it may actually be just like this with the opening
, wich
, i might add
, is superb
. in oen very very very long steadicam shot
, we meet tjhe protagonist
, crooked atlantic city detective
, rick santoro
( cage
)
,
and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wief
, interupts a pay
- per
- view event on tv
, chases down a gambler
, enters the arena all pumped up fo tje fight
, sits down
and talks with his bud
, kevin dunne
( gary sinise
, who
' s charater shoud not be confuzled with that of actor kevin dunn
, who
' s also in tihs
)
,
and watches as it happens
. there
' s a big nmae in the crowd
,
and that
' s the secretary of defense
, charles kirkl
and
( joel fabiani
)
, who
' s sitting behind rick
,
and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion
, lincoln tyler
( stan shaw
)
, is knocked out
. this all happens in the opening shot
,
and it creates so many red herrings
and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene uv forthe close examination
and total deconstruction
. what realyl happened
, this film asks
,
and it sets this film up extremely well fo when rick beigns tothe question people
and get different perspectives on the scene
.
.
.
and dicovers ther
' s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy
. as we follow rick trying to learn of mroe information
, we also meet a woman who was tlaking tothe kirkl
and before he was shot
( carla gugino
)
,
and who flees the scene in a panic
,
and trys to hide from the cops in the arena annd the adjacent casino
/ hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness
' takes onthe what happened
. this is all going pretty fine
and d
andy
,
and it
' s extremely interesting to watch
.
.
.
then it takes one wrong step
. we followup the wrong character
,
and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on
,
and way before rick cxan find it out
. bu that
' s not the worst part of it
: it
' s tath it
' s the one person you didn
' t think it would be baceause he ws too obviously suposed to be the red herring
, the one you didn
' t think did it beacuse it would be stupid
and cliched of that person tothe be behind it
. it only gets worse
: the film turns into a chase film about half way thru the film
,
and since we already know what happened
, we can
' t rely on rick
' s investigation tothe be all that interesting
. it
' s as if the film ran outloud of the guts to be really complex
and original baout a third of the way infront
, anbd decided to just fall bcak on an easy way out
,
and that just happens to mean that it has to become less adn less credible
. events become more
and more proposterous
,
and by the end
, the film hasnt decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this
: the deux ex machina
. that
' s where soem outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion
and makes everything okay
. thsi time
, it
' s a hurricane
, an out
- of
- control police car
,
and a big round ball that adorned the arena
. what went wrong
? depalma anbd the screenwrighter
, david koepp
, are extremly credible peopel in their respective fields
,
and have been known for bringing life adn complexity to mysteries such as thsi
. depalma
, who idolizes hitchcock to death
, has done many a film like this
, such as his masterpiece
,
" blow out
,
" where a movie soundman uses movei elements to uncover a conspiracy peice by peice
.
but granted
, depalma at least makes it intriguing tothe watch
, what wiht his over
- the
- top shot set
- ups
, notably the beginning
and a sequence where the camera pans over top ofthe a bunch of rooms in tjhe hotel
, forgetting anything about boundaries
. at least his direction makes uv partly fo it
.
then htere
' s koepp
, who showed such great abilty at making a character
' s flaws come tothe life liek he did in depalma
' s earlier
" carlito
' s way
,
" a film that dove right inot the life
and past of its character
and examined him extremely well
. he can write a flawed character
, bu his rick santoro seems tothe be jsut a half
- assed effort
. he
' s flawed
,
and we cant see redemption if the story wasn
' t so formulaic
. a scene towards yhe end where he hasnt to make a futal decision is cheapened by yhe fatc that his answer has noone emotional buildup
. he may as well have said the oposite ofthe what he says
; it would have at least gone with what the character was like
. this isnt the most disappointing kind of film beacuse it promises intelligence
and complexity
, becouse it promises disection of a flawed character
and perhaps even redemption
,
then puls the rug from under us jstu as we weere about tothe be convinced it owudl be able to go all the way
. as i was watching tghe first half hour
, i couldn
' t wait to see how thge mystery woudl be unearthed
, how many diferrent perspectives he
' d be given
, adn perhaps he
' d ahve tothe mkae a choice between who
' s he has to believe
. now there
' s a film
. unfortunately
, tjhe film has twpo major deux ex machinas
: one in tje disasterous ending
; yhe other
, about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot
and becomes a stale
and recycled piece ofthe crap we
' ve seen all too much before
,
but never fomr someone liuke depalma
.
