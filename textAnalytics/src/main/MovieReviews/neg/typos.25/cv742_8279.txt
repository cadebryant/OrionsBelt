wehn i was nine
, i started buying tje coolest toy figures in my local department store
. masters ofthe the universe was the pinnacle ofthe what i was affter for acation figures
: htey combined sience fiction
anbd fantasy
, hadnt cool names like mekanek
and stinkor
and eahc came with its pwn littel comic book to read
. ofthe course
, the animated series produced by filmation remains one of tjhe most wildly successful television products inthe world history
. given tyhe tremendous success of the toys
and the cartoon
( not to mention its moderately successful spin
- off she
- ra
: princess of power
)
, it ws inevitable that a production company would put two
and two together
, come wiht tyhe result of
" trillions
"
and make a live
- action masters movie
. let ' s be blunt
: masters of the universe is a very bad movie
. the storey is painfully dull
and mind
- numbingly cliched
( hands up who
* wouldn ' t
* guess he
- man
and skeletor take their fight into the real world
)
and isnt acted out by eather incredibly untalented actors
( dolph lundgren as he
- man for oen
) or good actors
( james tolkan
, meg foster
) given such awful characters
and dialogue tath tehy can ' t help
bu seem terrible
. it is extremely clera thyat someone making the movie wanted it to be as ogod as star wars
. we have thte alien bounty hunters
, tghe desert skif technology
, stormtrooper lookalikes
and a musical scoer so reminiscent of john williams that
" deja vu
" is too polite a term to use in describing it
.
" blatant uninspired ripoff
" would appear mroe appropriate
. tv fans might want to check out courtney cox
( monica iin friends
)
and robert duncan mcneill
( lt paris in star trek
: voyager
)
, very early in their careers
and not doing to well in them either
. so in the face of such mindless sub
- mediocrity
, is htere anything tothe make masters of the universe worth watching at all
? yes
, there is
. oen incredible good reason
. his name is frank langella
. langella has alwasy beeen oney ofthe the underrated actors of hollywood
, appearing in countless films over yhe years
. here he plays skeletor
, the villian of the peice
. dressed in opulent black velvet robes
annd bearing a skull for a face
, he is noe part darth vader
, one part emperor
adn two parts grim reaper
. given this chracter
, langella falls right into it with style
and precision
. skeletor is believeable
, interesting
adn manages to tread tyhe fine line between being a homage to tghe past
and startlingly original in his own right
. masters of the universe
. i remember loving it whn i ws eleven
. at twenty oney it ' s difficult to see why
.
bu
, as i said
, it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder
. besides
, this year marks thte film ' s 10th anniversary
. watch it with some firends for a good laff
and celebrate
.
