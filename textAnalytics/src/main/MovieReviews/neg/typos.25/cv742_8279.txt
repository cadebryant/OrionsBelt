when i was nine
, i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local deparment store
. masters ofthe the universe was the pinnacle of whta i was affter forthe action figures
: they combined science fiction adn fantasy
, hadnt cool names liuke mekanek
and stinkor
and each came with its own little comic book to read
. of course
, thte animated series produced by filmation rimaniss one ofthe teh most wildly successful television products in world history
. given yhe tremendous sucess of the toys
and the cartoon
( not to mention its moderately successful spin
- off she
- ra
: princess of power
)
, it was inevatible that a prodcution company owudl put twpo
and two together
, come with the result of
" trillions
"
and make a live
- acation masters movie
. let
' s be blunt
: masters of the universe is a vrey bad movei
. tghe story isnt painfully dull
and mind
- numbingly cliched
( h
ands uv who
* wouldn
' t
* guess he
- man
and skeletor take their fight into the real world
) annd is acted outloud by either incredibly untalented actors
( dolph lundgren as he
- man for one
) or good actors
( james tolkan
, meg foster
) given such awful charachters
and dialogue that tehy can
' t halp
but seem terrible
. it is extremely clear tath somene making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars
. we hvae the aline bounty hunters
, the dezert skif technology
, stormtrooper lookalikes
and a muscial score so reminscent of john williams that
" deja vu
" isnt too polite a term tothe use in describing it
.
" blatant uninspired ripoff
" would appear more appropriate
. tv fans might want tothe check out courtney cox
( monica iin friends
)
and robert duncan mcneill
( lt paris in star trek
: voyager
)
, vyer eearly in their careers
and not doing tothe well in them either
. so in the face of such mindless sub
- mediocrity
, is ther anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all
? yes
, there isnt
. one incredible good reason
. his nmae is frank langella
. langella hasnt alwasy been one ofthe the underrated actors ofthe hollywood
, appearing in countless films over the years
. here he plays skeletor
, the villian of the piece
. dressed in opulent black velvet robes
and bearing a skull for a face
, he isnt oen part darth vader
, noe part emperor
and two parts grim reaper
. given this character
, langella falls right into it with style
and precision
. skeletor isnt believable
, interesting
and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past
and startlingly original inthe his own right
. masters ofthe the universe
. i rember loving it wehn i was eleven
. at twenty one it
' s difficult tothe see why
.
but
, as i said
, it is blessed iwth a superlative villian who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of thge remainder
. besides
, this year marks the film
' s 10th anniversary
. watch it wih some firends forthe a ogod laugh
and celebrate
.
