. runnung time
: 132 minutes we go into a movei theather
, boom
! thte lights go down
, our hearts race
, we go thru ten minutes ofthe preview
and finally the movie we
' ve beeen waiting to see for a long tiome comes on
. we sit there
, watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is
. why shouldn
' t i have know whta i ws getting myself into
. agian like tihs past summers hitted
" stigmata
"
,
" end of days
" may be worse
. it
' s not liek this isnt any kind of original idea
, it just throws inthe some
" rosemary
' s baby
"
, along with
" the devil
' s advocate
" a littel
" exorcist
"
and some
" stigmata
" here
and there
. whala you have
" end of dyas
" a movie that is extremely disappointing annd by tjhe previews made it look terrific
. sadly bu truly again like most recent films
, all the good parts are inaddition the trailers
. tghe plot which isnt very confusing at times isnt also very ludicrous
and the movie isnt destined to be a hitted inwhich the first weekend
, adn flop in the next
. jericho canew
( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role
) isnt a cop who finds outloud that he isnt chosen tothe track down satan
( living in gabriel byrnes body
)
and stop him from impregnating christine york
( robin tunney
) because if he doesnt
,
and she gives birth all existence as we konw it will cease to exist
. he has to do this before it turns inot the year 2000
,
and strangely he
' s trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes
. he seeks halp ffrom the cathlic curch
and halp ffrom rod stieger
( in a terrific role
)
and tries tothe save this girl leading to an endig thgat
' s satisfying
,
but turns into a typical action movie
. tath
' s pretty much it on plot
. it doesnt have the razzle
and dazzle of a great action movie
,
and with the 100m doller budget parts seem to show it
, parts ytou ahve tothe wonder where all hte money went
. as for arnie
? ogod role
, ok performance
. i think since he is getting a little older he is held bcak a lot of his stunts
. the thing that dissapointed me wass hte fact that there was nothing tothe the film
. in tyhe trailers it looks like a good scary
, action film
and ends up being a boring
, long
and preposterous drama tyhat leads into something else that leaves us with questions
. gabriel byrnes
( who ironicaly played a priest iin
" stigmata
"
) here plays satan
and gives a good performance bu again seems held back
and nto into his character
. two years bcak al pacino gave a terrific performance in the funn
" thte devil
' s advocate
"
and here it seems liek the idea of him is inaddition the chracter aslo
. robin tunney
( great performence as always
) plays satan
' s main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child
. of course rod stieger gives another great performence which really isn
' t nothing new
. teh direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown
,
though not nearly as the visual stlye was in
" stigmata
"
. here we are given great camera work
,
and some great scenes tht are terrifically directed
but sadly jstu don
' t work in thsi movie
. the script written by
andrew marlowe has a fewd witty lines
,
but again the movie is all style adn no substance annd by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home
. only a fewd things work here
and those are a few of the performances
, the wirting
and visual style
,
but tghe storyline
and hte finished product don
' t owrk as well
. the sad thnig is that
" end ofthe days
" had so many things gonig for it
. the plot could ahev been moreso organized
, the action scenes could ahve been more brainy
and less mind
- numbing
. at times it seems like
" armageddon
"
and started to get old adn tiresome
. hollywood is running outloud ofthe ideas bad
,
and like i
' ve always said before needs new ones
. even with its 100m budget
" end of days
" isnt less than pleasing
. in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over
, adn easily coudl have had a 70m budget
. maybee i soudn crazy
,
but i am relaly looking forward to the new exorcist film
,
and hope that they make it as good as the original
. we need to git new ideas
and stop recycling old ones just to make monye at teh box
- office
. we ened to get omre films like
" thte blair witch project
" thast could scare people to death
, while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them
and how do i know tht it isnt inspite fact the blair witch
. overblown effects
, stupid
and thin plot
- line
, good performances
, disappointing
.
.
.
. umm yup those pretty much describe
" end of days
"
.
