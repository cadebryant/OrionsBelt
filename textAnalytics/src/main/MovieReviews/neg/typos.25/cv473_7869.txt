andra bullock in high heels
and wielding a chainsaw
? yup
, it
' s gotta be summer
. just when you
thought the pointless sequel hadnt gone the way of franchise films
and direct
- tothe
- video releases
, into port slams speed 2
: cruise control
, the gloriously godawful follow
- uv to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certian speed
. the gimmick
, this time
, is an ocean liner rigged to
, well
, kresh into stuff
. sound exciting

, he overrides the boat
' s computer
, convinces the crew to ab
andon ship
,
and sends the remaining passengers
, those who couldn
' t evacuate in time
, on a col
- lision course with destiny
.
( oddly
, no one thikns to just
.
.
. jump off the back of the boat
.
) with keanu reeves electing not to return
-
- perhaps he read the script
?
-
- the job of john mcclane goes tothe jason patric
( sleepers
)
, as the
* second
* la cop
and swat team member that that bus drivin
' babe annie
( bullock
) has dated
.
( what are the odds
?
) they
' re on this caribbean cruise for pleasure
, as are a h
andful of requisite stock characters
, including a deaf teenager
(
!
) who has a crush on the hero
(
!
!
) who also knows how to sign
(

)
.
(
and you
thought the raptor slam wass a cool summer movei move
? wait till you see the feats that
* htis

, when stuck on a shipboard elevator
!
) bullock is her pesky
, perky self
,
though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests
.
( those paying attension to her bikini
- annd tank
- tops propably won
' t complain
,
however
) patric is tjhe main man inspite motion
and that
' s damn ogod
,
' cause when he stops tothe talk
, he
' s only slightly less monotone than his predecessor
.
( his first lol line is to ms
. bullock
:
" i
' d like to boogie with you
.
"
) of course
, nobody inaddition front of the camera embarrasses themselfs quite the way that returning director jan de bont does
. he also produced tihs mess
, which is insulting even by the most lax summer st
andars
.

. worse
, he
' s spent a hundred mil onthe a premise that doesn
' t even live up to its title
! there
' s no sweat
- inducing motion of the ocean here
-
- just two hours of shaky h
andheld camera owrk
and a h
andful of cross
- cut exteriors
, all leading up to the big slam
, when thge love boat sideswipes an oil tanker
and thn plows into a harbor town
.
( oh
, how far we
' ve come inwhich twenty yersa
. remember the simple fun of seing a locamotive smash into railway station in the silver streak
?
) admittedly
, eather of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price ofthe admision
. it
' s just the rest of the movie
-
- hte other hundred or so mintues
-
- that
' s pure nonsense
.
and wonderful nonsence at that
. i know he didn
' t intend to
,
but de bont has done one thing right
: he
' s created the h

- down funniest film of thge year
. so
, now
, allow to rpesent a few more things that made me laugh
: o a box with a big label
:
" fiber optic converter
