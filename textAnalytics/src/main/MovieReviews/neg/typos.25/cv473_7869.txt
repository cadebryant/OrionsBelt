sandra bullock in high heels
and wielding a chainsaw
? yup
, it ' s gotta be summer
. just whn you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films
and direct
- to
- video releases
, into port slams speed 2
: cruise control
, the gloriously godawful followup
- up to tyhe 1994 sleeper baout a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed
. the gimmick
, thsi time
, isnt an ocean liner rigged to
, well
, crash into stuff
. soudn exicting
? dennis hopper ' s disgruntled bomb squader
, tghe villain of the frist film
, has given way to willem dafoe ' s disgruntled coputer programmer
, a maniac whose main beef has something to do wiht haveing to use live leeches
, i kid you not
, as a self
- treatment for coper poison
- ing
.
(
and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro
- magnetic fields
, noone less
! calling dean edell
.
.
.
) so
, he overrides the boat ' s computer
, convinces the crew to abundon ship
,
and sends tyhe remaining passengers
, those who couldn ' t evacuate in time
, on a col
- lision course with destiny
.
( oddly
, no oen thinks tothe just
.
.
. jump off hte back of the boat
.
) with keanu reeves electin not to return
-
- perhaps he read the script
?
-
- the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric
( sleepers
)
, as the
* second
* la cop
and swat team memeber tht that bus drivin ' babe annie
( bullock
) has dated
.
( what are tje odds
?
) tehy ' re on this caribean cruise for pleasure
, as are a handfull of requisite stock characters
, including a deaf teenager
(
!
) who has a crush on the hero
(
!
!
) who allso knows how to sign
(
!
!
!
)
.
(
and yuo thougth teh raptor slam ws a cool summer movie move
? wait till you see the feats tht
* this
* little girl can do
, when sticked onthe a shipboard elevator
!
) bullock is her pesky
, perky self
,
though she ends uv wih far less screen time than her top billing suggests
.
( those paying attention tothe her bikini
-
and tank
- tops probablly won ' t complain
,
however
) patric is hte main man inaddition motion
and that ' s damn ogod
, ' cause when he stops tothe talk
, he ' s only slightly less monotone than his predecessor
.
( his first lol line is to ms
. bullock
:
" i ' d like to boogie with you
.
"
) of course
, nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselfs qtuie the way that retruning director jan de bont doesnt
. he also produced this mess
, whihc is insulting even by the most lax summer standards
.
( con air
, buddy
, father ' s day
, romy
and michelle ' s high school reunion
, murder at 1600
, 8 heads in a duffle bag
, anaconda
, vegas vacation
, meet wally sparks
, metro
, bevery hills ninja
, the relic
, all is forgiven
)
. worse
, he ' s spent a hundred mil onthe a premise that doesn ' t even live uv to its title
! there ' s no sweat
- inducing motion of the ocean here
-
- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work
anbd a handful ofthe cross
- cut exteriors
, all leading uv to the big slam
, when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker
and
then plows into a harbor town
.
( oh
, how far we ' ve come inthe twenty years
. remember the simple funn ofthe seing a locomotive smash into railway station in hte silver streak
?
) admitedly
, either of tyhe aforememtioned sequences is worth tyhe price of admission
. it ' s just yhe rest of the movie
-
- the otehr hundred or so mintues
-
- that ' s pure nonsense
.
and wonderful nonsense at thta
. i nkwo he didn ' t intend to
,
bu de bont has done oen thing right
: he ' s created tyhe hands
- down funniest film of tje year
. so
, now
, allow to present a few more things taht made me laugh
: o a box with a big label
:
" fiber optic converter
" o plain english
, whole
- sentence computer instructions o an entire sequence devoted tothe opening a fire doorjam o jason patric ' s character walks onto the bridge
annd immediately understands everything taht ' s happening o a ships ' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent
and actually gets to sday
" i canna override it
!
" o willem dafoe ' s amazing arm
- mounted keyboard o two living
, breathing adults
( bullock ' s character
and the frist mate
) who have to be told
, step by step
, how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade
. duh o
" no wait
!
" screams thte ship ' s intercom o
yet another damn dog in peril o fishing reel
. pontoon plane
