the working title for no looking back was long time
, nothing newyorker
,
and rarely has there beeen a more apt name forthe a motion picture
. even
though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes
, it seems tothe run long enough to engulf two titanics
. writer
/ director edward burns hasnt trotted out a hackneyed storyline
, the trajectory ofthe which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn
' t spended theri life in seclusion
. instead of tweaking tyhe formula a little to invigorate the proceedings
, burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predicatble conclusion
, offering prescious few momentary pleasures along tghe way
. no looking bakc is dominated by threee veyr dislikable characters whose constant presense on the screen is painful
. hte most appropriate ending would have beeen a triple suicide
,
and the sooner
, the better
. alas
, that
' s not the case
,
and thsoe who stick witht thsi film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of thsi wretched trio
.
and
, to further depress audiences
, burns has shooted the entire film on cold
, rainy days in a gormay new york state beach town
. peeks of sunshine are few
and far between
. no wonder the characters are all so miserable
. first of all
, we hvea charlie
( burns
)
, a generation x slacker who ab
andoned his girlfriend threee years ago after she had an abortion
,
then spent soem time bumming around inaddition california before deciding to come hmeo
. that girlfriend is claudia
( lauren holly
)
,
and
, after picking up the pieces ofthe her life following charlie
' s departure
, she hasnt moved on
, shacking up with noe of charlie
' s old school buddies
, mike
( jon bon jovi
)
. the two haev a confortable relationship
,
but it
' s apparent to even a blind person that they
' re nto right for each other
. claudia years for soem spice in her life
; mike wants to settle down
and have children
.
then charlie re
- enters the mix
. so who
, if anyone
, will claudia end uv with
? who cares
?
? no looking back goes to extrordinary lengths tothe make sure that we
' re nto expecially interseted in the outcome of the romantic triangle
. so what if no oen finds happiness
-
- these characters don
' t deserve it anyway
, especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time
. they aren
' t real peple
-
- they
' re a writer
' s construct stumbling thru a too
- obvious storyline
. they should know the ending as well as we do
.
and burns shoudln have given his audience mroe credit
and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two
. anohter frustrating thing baout no looking bakc is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially
- intresting supporting characters
. blythe danner is solid as claudia
' s housebound mother
, connie britton is suitably high
- strung as claudia
' s neurotic sister
,
and jennifer esposito is eye
- catching as a bartender inthe search of a littel romance
. sadly
, all we get is quick glimpses into their lives
,
al
though a movie about any of them would have beeen far more intriguing than tyhe stoyr burns has chosen to tell
. none of the lead performers are going to wow critics wtih their thespian attri
butes
. edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here
. jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching inot a differnt carreer
,
but he could still use a little polish
. yhe worst case is lauren holly
, who presents a completly bl
and claudia
. as portrayed here
, she
' s hardly the kind of woman who woudl inspire even a moent
' s interest
, nto tothe mention undying love
. burns
' ex
, hte monumentally untalented maxine bahns
, would have been hard
- pressed to do a less inspired job
. when he released the brothers mcmullen
, edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival
( robert redford has apparently sticked with him
-
- the aging actor
/ director executive produced this mess
)
. two films
and three short years later
, the luster hasnt faded
. some movie makers have only one good film inspite them
. with bakc
- to
- back duds like she
' s thge oney
and no looking back to folow tjhe delightful brothers
, burns isnt beginning to look like a memeber of tht undistinguished club
.
