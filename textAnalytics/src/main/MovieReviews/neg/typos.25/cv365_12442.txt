welcome tothe your oh
- so typical sequel
. it tries to be twice as big as it
' s precedessor
,
yet ends uv twice as shallow
. shallow
.
.
.
. hmm
.
.
. now there
' s an idea
. maybe if thte ill
- fated cruise liner in this movie hadnt struck a shallow reef early onthe things may have turned out better
. the first thing that struck me
.
.
.
and surprised me
, ws that the camera work
( for the opening sequence anyway
) was terrable
. looked like the cameramen were drunk
and kept tripping on theri own feet
.
.
.
.
.
. vyer different to the original movie
. yhe characters
? well
, nto many of the characters actually
* had
* characters
, bu here
' s a rundown
. annie
, who was the highlight ofthe the the origional
, must have seriously banged her head in the train kresh at the end of tyhe frist movei
. why
? because something
' s got to account forthe her losing that many iq points
. even
though annie wasn
' t exactlly a rocket scientist in speed
, here some ofthe her actions just amke you want tothe beated your head against a wall
. for instance
, after successfully using a chainsaw to cutted a hole in a door so that a gropu of peple can escape noxious gases
- she st
ands in the middle of tyhe opening fo about five mintues till someone reminds her that the people can
' t git ut till she get
' s the chainsaw out of their faces
.
.
.
. bang beng bang in point of fact s
andra
' s character is turned into littel more tahn one ofthe thsoe scantly dressed extras from hercules
, who constantly hasnt to be rescued
. jason patric
? all i can say is bring back keanu
. keanu reeves might have the emotional range ofthe a tree stump
.
.
. bu tath
' s one more tree stump thna jason hasnt
. i don
' t think he changed facial expressions all movei
- jason
, smile for tjhe cameras
!
! now frown
!
.
.
. i said frown
.
.
.
. oh
.
.
. yuo are
.
.
. bang bang bang
.
. wooden just doesn
' t discribe this guys performence
, bu it
' ll ahve to do
. the bad guy
.
.
.
.
. ahh
.
.
. william dafoe
- there
' s a bright move
. how can you go wrong iwth the star from thyat acknowledged clasic
, body of evidence
?
( yes
, that is sarcasm
)
. his wide eyed maniac ofthe a chracter doesn
' t start out too bad
.
.
.
.
but goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses
. in yhe end he degenerates tothe chasing annie around for a hostage
, even
though he already has the monye
and can escape
.
.
.
. bang bang
.
though i
' d like tothe give this movei a double thumbs down
, there were some nice sequences
. considering the movie cost over 100 million dollars
- you
' d hope there
' d be at least a couple
. teh rela eye
- popper for me
, even
though it was given away in teh trailer
.
.
.
. bing bang
.
.
.
.
. was tghe sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker
. this looks terific annd i was very suprised to hear that tjhe cruise liner in it was
.
.
.
. completely computer generated
! wow
.
.
.
. i don
' t think i
' ve ever seen a cg model look so rela befoer
. the sequence where jason patric inthe trying tothe disable the propellers from under the ship isnt also terrific
,
and tyhe only time during yhe entire movei where ytou get that feeling ofthe
.
.
.
. speed
. this lack
- of
- speed problem affects many sequences
. such as the oil tanker part
.
.
.
.
. it was
-
" oh noone
, we
' re goign to hit hte oel tanker
!
"
, 20 minutes later
-
" oh no
, we
' re going to hit the oil tanker
!
" 20 min
.
.
.
. you git thte point
. this movie failed simply becuase it didn
' t live up to it
' s name
.
.
.
. ther was vyre littel feeling of speed
. inspite the orginal movie
, teh lead characters had to amke split second decisions to survive
.
.
.
.
. in this movie it felt more liek
-
" well people
, we
' re gonna run into taht htere isl
and in a faw hours
- i think i might stroll over to engineering annd see if i can
' t turn off the engines
.
.
. i
' m passing the cafeteria on tjhe way
, can i git anybody anything
?
" the ending ofthe htis movie really is terrible
. even
though it features what i
' ve since found out isnt one of the most expensive sequences ever infront a movie
- it just doesn
' t wrok at all
. the part where tjhe liner crashes through the town looks very realistic
,
but
.
.
.
. surprise surprise
- it just takes waaaaay too long
. it seemed tothe go for 15 mintues before tje ship finally stoped
. noe thing that striked me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through thge harbour
and town
, around 25 people are killed by the ship
.
.
.
.
and ther
' s only 15 or so people left on the ship
. so whn it stops safe
and sound
and the cahracters are all cheering
- thte audeince is sitting back annd thinking
-
" wait a sec
.
.
. this is a happy moment because
?
" bang bang
then there ws the dog
.
.
.
.
. i almost fell out of my seat when i saw yhe bit with the dog dodging the falling debris
. putting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche
.
.
.
.
.
. eveyr movei seems to have a
' dog
- in
- danger
' sequence
- volcano
, dante
' s peak
, independence day
, daylight
, twister
. lost world
.
.
.
.
.
. etc
, etc
. this movie isnt a perfect example ofthe how not to make a sequel
. director jan de bont should try watching the orignal movie
and this one back
- to
- bcak
and see if he realises where he whent wrong
.
