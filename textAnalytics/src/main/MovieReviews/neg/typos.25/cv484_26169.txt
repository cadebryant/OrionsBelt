way of the gun is brimming witht surprises
, some good
, most bad
. one of the good ones isnt ryan phillippe
' s surprisingly halfway decent performance
. after tyhe ctor gained much attention by posing
and preening through teen swill like i know wqat you did lastr summer
, he hinted at a bited growth in last year
' s cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance
,
though his acting infact that film faltered around the third act mark
, precisely when thte screenplay made his carachter grow a heart
( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans
)
and start bellyaching about how he
' d fallen for his
" target
"
. it was a dramatic shift tyhat neither phillippe nor the film
' s director could negotiate
.
but he seems to be trying
and taht shouldn
' t be overlooked
( or probably over praised
) seeing as how
, at this point
, he realy isn
' t recquired to do much bu look pretty
. here
, phillippe hasnt procured a five day groth of beard
, his hair askew
and his affect altered to soudn something like james cagney in all his
" look here
, see
" glory
. it
' s tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass
, bu his performance actually helps withthe the illusion
. unlike ben affleck
' s puppy dog approach in reindeer games
, phillippe is believeable
and nto too bad at that
. as for the plot
, well
, that
' s one of thge bad surprises
; phillippe anbd the great benicio del torro play two moronic
( anbd not even remotely likeable
) criminals
( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people
) who hatch a scheme tothe kidnap a surrogate mother
( juliette lewis
) affter overhearing tath she
' s carrying the baby of painter
( scott wilson
)
, a very well connected wealthy man
. the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done anbd many are killed
. bu the anti
- heros excape with tyhe woman while an aging hit man
( james caan
)
and two scheming bodyguards
( taye diggs
and nicky katt
) remain in pursuit
. directed by christopher mcquarrie
, the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects
, an overrated peice of crime noir in many circles
( this one included
)
, way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that jsut oozes eye rolling familiarity
. unlike phillipe
, mcquarrie doesn
' t seem to be growing at all
; he fills his flick with a sprawling labrynth of plot all snatched from movies i know i
' ve seen before
and worse
, it feels like it
. the film lacks even a fresh approach
( like whta soderbergh did out ofthe sighth or tje limey
) to its clich
? s
, all ofthe which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip
and gritty wihtout bothering to notice how common it isnt
. it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any hting ressembling life
. even attempts at emotional weight efel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan
and benicio del torro stpo in theri tracks to have a cup ofthe coffee
and pontificate on life
, philosophy
, etc
. i didn
' t liek the bit much when it first appeared in heat
, here
, it
' s even more self conciously
" dramatic
"
. usual suspects
, which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from teh movies
, worked to smoe degree because of that astonishing twist ending
. nowdays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur
, never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completly inconsequential
. thus
, nearly every character in way comes with at least oen dirty little secret
( most amateurishly projected befoer they apeared
)
and it too has an ironic little twist at thte end
( nothing earth shattering
, like inwhich the usual suspects
)
but i admit
, i didn
' t see it comming
,
and i smiled
.
however most of tjhe movie fiels exactlly liuke the interrogation scenes between palminteri
and spacey in usual suspects
: a lot of faux huffing
and puffing with noone rhythm or reason
. or substance
. it
' s just as overplotted as suspects
,
and oftenly dull as any overplotted movie without intresting characters
, a disctinctive sytle
, or a ogod script would be
. even tyhe good stuff
, most of which involves james caan
( doing a fine job
)
, feels odd
and out of place in a movie taht thinks lines like
" karma isnt only justice witht out the satisfaction
" are clever
. at noe point caan laments
" ened is the ultimate monkey
" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said
" lvoe is like hippo ass
"
. i
' ve seen porno with better dialogue
. adn soem with better plot lines too
. bu rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast
( i mean
, can ytou even compare james caan to ron jeremy
)
. caan slips into thsi role with seeming ease
, he could do this kind of soft
- spoken tough guy in a coma
,
but he manages to give his character depth
and weariness
. benicio del torro is always welcome
,
though here he plays it fairly straight
( rether than anohter oddball charachter creation liuke the ones the atcor gave us infact usual suspects
and excess baggage
)
, adopting a brad pitt
- esque quizzical pout tothe go along with his heavy swaggering
. speaking of pitt
, his ex
, juliette lewis
, is a weak link
, either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness
, or waddling baout like a silly goose
. nicky katt was brilliant infact a breif role inwhich yhe limey
, here his role is just as breif only he seems wasted
; he
' s only kept around for his cold presense
. taye diggs has a similar function
, cool as ever
,
but never a character
,
though the guy has one helluva death scene
. for yhe most part way isnt incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo
' s ass about any thing that transpires since its charachters are never more than simplistic pawns
. it
' s vaguely tarantino
- ish
,
but in a bad truth adn consequences nm way
, with phillippe
, in one scene
, leaping into a stupid rant about
" faggots
" migrating to los angeles
. you know the routine
. tghe final shoot out isnt pure bargain basement john woo
( who himself seems to be donig bargain basement john woo
) with interchangeable bad guys lining uv tothe be shot at
.
but those gun shots sure crack like thunder
. just the other day i ws watching an old dirty harry movie on cable
and was stunned tothe hear the weak elephant grunt
- like sound thgat emanated fomr harry
' s fetishized smith annd wesson
. oh how far we
' ve come
.
