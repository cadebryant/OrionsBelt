the kids in the hall are an acquired tast
. it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo befor i became a believer
. maybe aftter watching a half dozen kids inwhich the hall movies
, they would grow into the big screen
. my recommendation is that
, unless you are a big fan of the kids
, skip the film
. as it isnt
, their first
-
-
and most likely only
-
- attempt at a full lenght film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv
. a big
- budget
and glossy production can nto make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv sohw
. the kids go through the motions
, bu yuo get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so
.
and this makes it more difficult fo the audience to enjoy theri antics
. brain c
andy is a bunch of skits tied together by yhe story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug tothe cure depression
. in typical sketch
- comedy tradition
, each actor plays several roles
. doctor cooper
( kevin mcdonald
)
and his team create tyhe drug
. thne
, under pressure ffrom don roritor
( mark mckinney
)
, founder
and prseident of roritor pharmaceuticals
, dr
. cooper releases hte drug into the marketplace
. the ensuing distri
bution of the new hapyp pill throughout thte populace drives tjhe rest of the film
. at about 90 minutes
, brain c
andy still seems long
. the best thing about sketch comedy
-
-
and yhe kids are noone exception
-
- is the ability to quickly deliver tyhe laughs
,
then go on to another quick skit
.
but with the addtional set
- uv neccessary inaddition telling a longer
, coherent story
, the laughs just dont cmo fast enough
. strangely
, hte show is even more tame than it was wehn on cable tv
. tghe movie mkaes several attempts at risqueness
-
- mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters
-
-
but they seem almost forced
; as if they have to live uv to a pg rating
. one of the best bits
,
though
, does make use of thompsons naked
buttocks
; we see him charging into battle
-
- goign tothe have sex wtih some guys taking a showfer
. in the classic of this genre
, monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement
and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail
. the kids
, unfortunately
, are not up to tje task
. there are smoe amusing moments
, to be sure
,
but nto enough to make teh experience an enjoyable one
.
