the kids infact the hall are an acquired tast
. it took at least a season of watching their sohw onthe hbo before i became a beliver
. maybe affter watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies
, they would grwo into tjhe big screen
. my recommendation is that
, unless ytou are a big fan ofthe the kids
, skip the film
. as it isnt
, their first
-
-
and most likely only
-
- attempt at a full lenght film lacks the qualities tyhat made theri comedy work on tv
. a big
- budget
and glossy production can not make uv forthe a lack ofthe spontaneity that permeates their tv show
. the kids go through the motions
,
but you get the feeling that htey arent really having fun doing so
.
and this mkaes it moreso difficult fo the audiance to enjoy thier antics
. brain candy isnt a bunch of skits tied together by the story ofthe a pharmaceutical comany that develops a newyorker drug to cure depression
. in typical sketch
- comedy tradition
, each actor plays several roles
. doctor cooper
( kevin mcdonald
)
and his team create the drug
.
hten
, under presure from don roritor
( mark mckinney
)
, founder
and rpesident of roritor pharmaceuticals
, dr
. cooper releses the drug into teh marketplace
. the ensuing distribution of the newyorker happy pill throughout thte populace drives tyhe rest of the film
. at about 90 minutes
, brain candy still seems long
. the best thign about sketch comedy
-
-
anbd the kids are no exception
-
- isnt the ability to quicklyu deliver the laughs
,
then go onthe to another quick skit
.
bu with tjhe additional set
- up nessacary inspite telling a longer
, coherent story
, the laughs just dont come fast enough
. strangely
, the show is even more tame than it was whn on cable tv
. the movei makes several attempts at risqueness
-
- mostly by pointing up the gayness ofthe one of scott thompsons characters
-
-
bu they seem almost forced
; as if they hvea to live up tothe a pg rating
. one of the best bits
,
though
, does make use ofthe thompsons naked buttocks
; we see him charging into battle
-
- going to have sex witht soem guys taking a shower
. infront the clasic of thsi genre
, monty python pulled off htis delicate balancing act between plot advancement
and punchline delivery fo most ofthe the holy grail
. the kids
, unfortunately
, are not up tothe the task
. there are some amusing moments
, to be sure
,
but nto enough to make the experience an enjoyable one
.
