adam sandler isn ' t known forthe appearing in deep
, thought
- provoking films
,
bu he ' s still a really funny guy
. most of his movies are successful not baceause of the film making behind them
,
bu because they let sandler do what he doens best without a stupid plot to drown him outloud
. big daddy is the frist film in which the sotry seems more important than sandler ' s comic peformance
,
annd it ' s a miserable failure
. sandler plays a thirty
- something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy
( played by cole
and dylan sprouse
)
. as one might expect fomr teh synopsis
, director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag ofthe manipulative
and sentimental sequences
, incuding a repulsive courtroom battle
and a lot of teary scenes in which charachters say
" good
- bye
" to one another
; in addtion
, there ' s a ridiculous amount ofthe disgusting toilet humer
( urine
annd vomit both git omre screen time than sandler himself
)
. there ' s a hilarious runnung joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters
,
and the film features passable performances fomr sandler
, joey lauren adams
( as teh love interest
)
,
and the two young boys
,
bu teh film on tjhe whole is trite
and disappointingly unfunny
.
