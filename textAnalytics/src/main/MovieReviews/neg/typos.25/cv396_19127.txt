thought
- provoking films

but he
' s still a relaly funny guy

,
and it
' s a miserable failure

, director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative
and sentimental sequences
, including a repulsive courtroom battle
and a lot of teary scenes infact which characters say
" good
- bye
" to one another
; in addtion
, htere
' s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humer
( urine
and vomit both get mroe screen time thna s
