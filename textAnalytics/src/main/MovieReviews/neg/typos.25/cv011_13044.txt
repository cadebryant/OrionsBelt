janeane garofalo inspite a romantic comedy
-
- it wass a good idae a couple years ago with the truth baout cats adn dogs
but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker
. this isnt a by
- the
- books movie that plods along on a predestined course with noone surprises
and very few laughs
. it also jumps on tje ever
- popular polliticel satire b
andwagon
and manages to fall flat there
, too
. garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator
( jay o
. s
anders
) running for reelection
. denis leary plays tje stereotypical strategist wiht no ethics who decides the only way forthe the sc
andal
- plagued senator tothe win is to play up his irish roots
and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that
' s made thte kennedy family so populer
. so leary orders garofalo to go to irel
and
and dig up some relatives tothe exploitate
. she soon lerans why
" easier said than done
" is tyhe mantra ofthe movies like thsi
. the matchmaker falls fo eveyr cliche ofthe things that cin go wrong
-
- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to irel
and
, alomst misses the bus to town
, can
' t get a hotel room
, ends uv in thte smallest
, trashiest one around
, has a dog piss onthe her luggage
,
and so on
.
then comes waht roger ebert calls the
" meet cute
.
" it happens in eveyr romance
: the man
and woman have to meet eahc other for yhe first time iin some unconventional
, cinematic way
. infront the matchmaker
, it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom anbd finds a nude sean
( david o
' hara
) in the bathtub
, his dog sitting at his side
. no points for guessing it
' s the same dog that just made water on her luggage
. also noone points forthe guessing garofalo hates o
' hara on sighth
. that
' s how it works in movies liuke these
. i know from tghe instant i saw thgat irishman infact the bathtub thast she
' d hate him for awhile
, thne succumb tothe his charms
, live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil
, after which they
' d reconcile inaddition timne for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits
. i haven
' t maintioned the movei
' s twist
yet
. garofalo comes to the small irel
and town during the annual matchmaking festival
, during whihc lonley folks from around hte county pair off into a future of bliss
. milo o
' shea
( who looks liuke an irish tom snyder
) isnt the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom
and bring lonely souls together
. rest assured he
' ll do all he can to match up garofalo
and o
' hara
. oh
,
and in keeping iwth the matchmaker
' s utter predictability
, he dies toward the end
. what the message here
? somtimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction
, liek garofalo
, will sell out with a weak script
. i was excited to see garofalo
and leary iin the same movie
,
but they actually onyl have two or three scenes together
. leary stays stateside
, forthe tghe most part
, yelling at garofalo over the phone
and generally being an asshole
. he even undoes hismelf with the old microphone
' s still on after he
' s done giving the speech cliche
. both of them should have known better
.
