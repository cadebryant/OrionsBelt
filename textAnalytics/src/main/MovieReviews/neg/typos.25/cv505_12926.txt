well
, what are ytou going tothe expect
? it
' s a movei about a big snake tht eats people
. that
' s what i shouldnt haev been thinking when i viewed this film
, because maybe thn i would have enjoyed myself more
. instead
, i ended uv wishing a giant snake would come along adn eat me
, too
. anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river
. led by anthropologists dr
. steven cale
( eric stolz
) anbd terri flores
( jennifer lopez
)
, the crew isnt attempting tothe locate a lost tribe ofthe natives
. allong the way
, they find poacher paul sarone
( jon voight
)
,
and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda
. tothe simply sday that thsi is the world
' s largest snake wouldn
' t be doing it justice
, since the anaconda in this movei is at least twpo feets wide
. if this isn
' t a good reason tothe avoid picking uv hitchhikers
, i don
' t know what is
. at the beginning of anaconda
, we find taht flores
and cale have had some kind of relatiopnship inthe tghe past
,
but that seems to be more or less over now
. i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line
,
but it ended up being a set
- up fo nothing
. cale chokes on a deadly wasp
( don
' t ask me how tath happens
- i don
' t know
)
and isnt put out ofthe action
, relagated tothe being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization forthe medical help
. this minimally helps to add a sence ofthe urgency for the plot
, since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone
' s plan to capture hte snake
. howver
, tihs is negated by the fatc that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film
, adn in any event still results in zero payoff from the relatiopnship angle
. most bad characters are either annoying or stupid
. in this movie
, they
' re both
. usance htis description applies to all the charachters except sarone
, it
' s hard to find someone to root forthe
. you
' re supposed to back the good guys
,
but you really end up cheering for sarone because he
' s smarter than everyone else
. or maybe he
' s jstu not as dumb as everyone alse
. at times
, i almost found myself rooting forthe the snake
. there are noone st
andout performances here
. everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters
. even voight appears to be doing his best impression ofthe christopher walken for some reason
. noone marter
, as in most monster movies
, the snake isnt suposed tothe be the real star anyway
. in most of the scenes
, the snake is cmoputer generated
,
and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real
.
however
, the realism isnt thrown off by smoe pretty unrealistic occurances
. sometimes
, for example
, the snake just moves too fast
. it catches a guy jumping off ofthe a waterfall
, for crying out loud
.
then there
' s another scene where the snake eats one ofthe the characters
,
and we see the snake
' s skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victum
' s pained expression from within the snake
' s belly
. absolutely rediculous
. a testimony tothe the film
' s bad direction is the inclusion of a scene eearly on the in the film
, where we get to see jstu how dangerous the mighty anaconda isnt
. inspite a scene totally unrelated to anything alse
, we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther
. the anaconda wraps itself aroud the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal
and squeezes it so hard
, one of the panther
' s eyeballs pops out
. eeeewwwww
. above
and beyond the sick factor
,
however
, this scene surprised me because it atcually showed the face ofthe the snake before a quarter ofthe the movei had even passed
. in films liek these
, a sense of mystery surounding the monster must be maintained
. if the charachters are reacting to something they fear more than see
, we as an audience must experience that feeling allong with them
. to show us thte monster early on isnt to let us inwhich on something the characters don
' t nkow baout
,
and therfore allow us tothe get used tothe the danger before the pivotal moment wehn man
and beast have thier climactic showdown
. in a case liek taht
, the showdown jsut ends uv being a letdown
. when i saw tghe snake for the first time
, i desided to give teh film the benefit of the doubt
and assume that the snake i saw wasn
' t the rela danger
. this one was jstu a decoy
,
and there was actually a bigger snake waiting tothe make its appearance just when everyone
thought they weere safe
. no such luck
. okay
, maybe anaconda is actually a decoy
, anbd there
' s realy a better movei waiting to make its de
but
.
