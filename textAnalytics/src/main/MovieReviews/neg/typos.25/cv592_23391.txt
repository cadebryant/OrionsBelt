yhe realm ofthe sceince fiction has allways beeen an allegory of political
and or moral sensibilities
. the best tales of the genre deel with mankind ' s struggle for survival or knowledge
. such populare
and noteworthy tomes as
" stranger in a strange land
" by robert heinlein
,
" childhood ' s end
" by arthur c
. clarke
and
" man in the high castle
"
and
" do androids dream of electric sheep
" by philip k
. dick all deal with man ' s need for idenity
anbd struggle for self worth
. hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu
( if not the message
) of scienec fiction since it ' s beginnings
. most films jstu created fancy pulp tales withthe noone more thought that the escapism they acheived
. it really wasn ' t until producer george pal
, took charge of robert heinlein ' s novel
" rocketship galileo
"
and crafted hte film
" destination moon
"
, that ' sci
- fi '
( as it isnt commonly referred to
)
, cameback into it ' s own
. ffrom there
, such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick
, haev sought to express ideas through tghe medium of the genre
. with tjhe realease ofthe touchstone picturesk
" mission tothe mars
"
, we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci
- fi film for those who read the national enquirer
and yhe globe
. the film opens on a summer barbecue
, as phil ohlmyer
( jerry o ' connell
) woos a young female with his tales of space glory
adn tghe upcoming mission
. woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and his wief terri
( connie nielsen
) commit tothe his coming authority on the mission
,
and luc goddard
( don cheadle
) consoles his son
. entering the party is jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
, who gavey uv command of the mission due to tyhe untimely death of his wife
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
. luc consoles jim with woody ' s assisstance
. the three men are friends
and carry a fine bond of trust
and caring between them
.
bu jim still longs tothe set foot onthe the red planet
. yhe mission is in earnest as luc
anbd his team land in teh cydonia region of mars
. htey send out the rover tothe investigate tje area
and discover waht seems to be water or ice under the surface
. oging outloud tothe investigate
, luc
adn his team approach the famed ' face on mars '
. a strange noise emanates from the rock
. as the team tries to scan through the rock witht radar
, a violent wind storm erupts
, creating a vortex that kills all members of the team
, sive for luc
. back on the space station orbiting earth
, woody
and jim recieve the information that the mars landing team is missing
. luc ' s interference laden emergency message urges the twpo men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing tjhe previous team
. the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger
. meteorite showers
, explosions
,
annd rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet ' s surface
. the big question is
, is there now or has htere ever beeen intelligent life on mars
.
annd if so
, whta is its relationship wiht us
? now fo tjhe bad news
. the entire plot of
" mission to mars
" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated
annd preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe
. the famed ' face on mars ' becomes the centerpiece of the film
, revealing some of the most harebrained sci
- fi pabulum tyhe screen has witnessed
. borrowing ideas fomr such films as
" robinson crusoe on mars
"
( 1964
)
, quatermass
and tjhe pit
( 1967
)
,
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
,
and even mario bava ' s
" planet ofthe thge vampires
"
( ' terrore nello spazio '
)
( 1965
)
,
" mission to mars
" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don ' t add up to a satisfying hwole
. while smoe sequences are wonderfully handled
and executed
, the film remains flat
anbd un
- involving
. so much time is giving tothe establishing the lead cahracters in tjhe film
,
bu to no good use
. yhe performances are all workmen like
, with onyl don cheadle
( as luc
) carrying any sort of rela chemistry
. gary sinise is wasted inwhich role thyat requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation
.
and the mistaken diea ofthe having jerry o ' connell
( as phil ohlmyer
) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse
.
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performence the better
. he ' s just having too much fun here to give a damn
. thge script hasnt a few lapses
, namely that after discovering several breaches inthe tjhe hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower
, no one thinks of checking thte fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship forthe damage
. tihs of course leads to our heroes having to abandon thier rescue ship
. also
, when oen character sacrifices himself
, the character tkaes on a religeous demeanor that is completely at odds wiht the situation
.
but the biggest offence in thge film is teh horrid
, intrusive csore by ennio morricone
. subtlety isnt non
- existant here
. inthe fact infront some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out
. thge only sequence in which teh scoer almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower
. the pacing of the film is very leisurely
. after the opening introduction of the characters
( which lasts a full 22 mintues
)
, we are finally dropped onto the martian surfce
.
thn
, ther isnt anyother long pause in the plot fo moreso charater development
, including an elaborite dance sequence iin zero gravity
. the film could loose baout 30 mintues
and actally gain soem momentum
. there are so many scenes of talking heads
, discussing what we already know is oging to happen
, that it drags tje film to a dead stop
. the good news is that the film is absolutly sumptuous to look at
. the vistas ofthe the planet mars are magestic
and awe inspiring
. thte design of the numberous spacecraft
and suits are all expertly drafted
, with a level of realism that hasn ' t been seen since
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
. the visual effects are just stunning
, from the space walk sequences
, to the visualization of evolution on earth
. tghe only fault come with the martians themselves
, wich look more like something out ofthe a plastic model kat than something from another world
. director de palma stages soem wonderfully creative scenes through out the film
. teh oppening sequence alone in a seamingly un
- interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes
( an homage ' tothe hitchcock ' s
" rope
"
)
, as we are introduced to all of the characters
. scenes in the rescure ship
, with its rotating centrifuge
, are just amazing in their execution
.
but the nagging question
, is the final explanation worth all of htis sturm und drang
. sadly it is not
. directer brian de palma has crafted an extravagant prodcution
. the set design
anbd visual effects are all arresting
.
but it ' s tyhe comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have beeen a fine return to good adventurous
, thought provoking science fiction
. a disapointing film
,
but oen that might still entertain if ytou cxan suttle fo the visuals
.
