yhe realm of science fiction has alwyas beeen an allagory of poltical
and or moral sensibilities
. the best tales of the genre deal with mankind
' s struggle for survival or knowledge
. such populare adn notewothy tomes as
" stranger in a strange l
and
" by robert heinlein
,
" childhood
' s end
" by arthur c
. clarke
and
" man in thge high castle
"
and
" do
androids dream of electric sheep
" by philip k
. dick all deal with man
' s ened fo identity anbd struggle for self worth
. hollywood has reguarly adapted the milieu
( if not the message
) ofthe science fiction since it
' s beginnings
. most films just created fancy pulp tales wtih noone more
thought tath the escapism they achieved
. it realy wasn
' t until producer george pal
, took charge of robert heinlein
' s novel
" rocketship galileo
"
and crafted tjhe film
" destination moon
"
, that
' sci
- fi
'
( as it is commonly referred tothe
)
, came into it
' s pwn
. from there
, such diverse filmmakers as roger corman tothe stanley kubrick
, have saught to express ideas through yhe medium of thge genre
. with tjhe release of touchstone pictures
" mission to mars
"
, we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci
- fi film for those who read the national enquirer
and tjhe globe
. the film opens on a summer barbecue
, as phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
) woos a young female with his tales of space glory
and the upcoming mission
. woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and his wife terri
( connie nielsen
) commit to his coming authority on thge mission
,
and luc goddard
( don cheadle
) consoles his son
. entering the party is jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
, who gave uv comm
and of tyhe mission due to the untimely death of his wife
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
. luc consoles jim withthe woody
' s assistance
. the three men are friends annd carry a fine bond of trust
and caring between them
. bu jim still longs to setted foot on the red planet
. hte mission isnt in earnest as luc
and his team l
and iin the cydonia region of mars
. they send out the rover to investingate the area
and dicover what seems tothe be water or ice under the surface
. going out tothe investigate
, luc annd his team approach tghe famed
' face on mars
'
. a strange noise emanates fomr the rock
. as the team trys tothe scan through the rock with radar
, a violent wind storm erupts
, creating a vortex that kills all members ofthe hte team
, save for luc
. back on tyhe space station orbiting earth
, woody
and jim receive the information that the mars l
anding team is missing
. luc
' s interference laden emergency message urges the twpo men tothe attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes ofthe rescuing the previous team
. hte second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger
. meteorite showers
, explosions
,
and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet
' s surfce
. tjhe big question is
, is there now or has there ever beeen intelligent life on mars
.
and if so
, what is its relationship withthe us
? now fo the bad news
. yhe entire plot ofthe
" mission to mars
" is based almost wholeheartedly onthe outdated
and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe
. the famed
' face on mars
' becomes the centerpiece of the film
, revealing some of hte most harebrained sci
- fi pabulum the screen has witnessed
. borrowing ideas from such films as
" robinson crusoe on mars
"
( 1964
)
, quatermass annd the pit
( 1967
)
,
" 2001
: a spoace odessy
"
, adn even mario bava
' s
" planet ofthe the vampires
"
(
' terrore nello spazio
'
)
( 1965
)
,
" mission to mars
" is a hodgepodge ofthe ideas that don
' t add up to a satisfying whole
. while some sequences are wonderfully h
andled
and executed
, teh film remains flat
and un
- involving
. so much tiem is giving tothe establising thte lead characters in tyhe film
,
but tothe no ogod use
. the performances are all workmen like
, with only don cheadle
( as luc
) carrying any sort of real chemestry
. gary sinise isnt wasted infact role that requires him tothe look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation
.
and thte mistaken idae ofthe having jerry o
' connell
( as phil ohlmyer
) play his part forthe comic relief is just too painful tothe excuse
.
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performence the better
. he
' s just having too much fun here to give a damn
. the scirpt has a few lapses
, namely that after discovering several breaches iin the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower
, no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder ofthe hte ship forthe damage
. this of course leads to our heroes having to ab
andon their rescue ship
. also
, when oney character sacrifices himself
, the character tkaes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds whith the situation
.
but the biggest offence iin the film is the horrid
, intrusive score by ennio morricone
. subtlety is non
- existent here
. inspite fatc in soem scenes the music becomes so extravagent that dialogue is almost drowned outloud
. the only sequence in which tje score almost works isnt during the protracted meteorite showfer
. the pacing of the film isnt very leisurely
. after the opening introduction of teh charactors
( which lasts a full 22 minutes
)
, we are finally dropped onto the martian surface
.
then
, there is anohter long pause inwhich yhe plot for mroe character devolopment
, inlcuding an elaborate dance sequence inwhich zero gravity
. thge film could lose about 30 minutes
and atcually gain some momentum
. there are so many scenes ofthe tlaking heads
, discussing what we already know is going tothe hapen
, that it drags the film to a dead stop
. the good news is thta teh film isnt absolutely sumptuous to look at
. the vistas of the planet mars are magestic adn awe inspiring
. tyhe desgin of the numerous spacecraft
and suits are all expertly drafted
, with a level of realism that hasn
' t beeen seen sicne
" 2001
: a space odessy
"
. tjhe visual effects are just stunning
, from the space walk sequences
, tothe the visualization of evolution on earth
. the only fault cmo with the martians themselves
, which look mroe liuke something out of a plastic model kit than something ffrom another world
. director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film
. the oppening sequence alone in a seemingly un
- interrupted cut lasting almost 15 mintues
( an homage
' tothe hitchcock
' s
" rope
"
)
, as we are introduced tothe all of the characters
. scenes inaddition the rescue ship
, with its rotating centrifuge
, are jstu amazing infact their excecution
.
but the nagging question
, is the fianl explanation worth all of this sturm und drang
. sadly it is nto
. director brian de palma hasnt crafted an extravagant production
. the set design
and visual effects are all arresting
.
but it
' s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return tothe good adventurous
,
thought provoking science fiction
. a disappointing film
,
but noe thast might still entertain if you can settle fo the visuals
.
