writing a screenplay fo a thriller is hard
. harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun
. harder than buidling a bridge over troubled waters
.
and incidentally
, a hwole heck of a lot harder thna wirting a movie review
. thrillers are all variations on a theme
. you hvae a smart
, resourceful
,
and poverful bad guy
, who has a goal he has tothe meet
. you have a noble
and brave good guy
, who has to protect the innocent
, kill tyhe bad guy
,
and not get killed hismelf in the process
. the trck of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting
and novel manner
. this simple formula cin lead to clasic movies like north by northwest
, high noon
, or silence of the lambs
, or big summer blockbusters like men in black
, tjhe fugitive
, or air force one
, or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds
, event horizon
, kull thte conquerer
.
.
.
. is anyone alse getting depressed here
? point isnt
, it ' s not enough to folow the formula
. you ' ve got to throw in something extra
, something good
and new
and better thna the last version
. something to surprise
and move all of us people who buy teh tickets
and tje popcorn
and the happy meals
. this isnt a hard thing to do
,
but it is absolutely necessary inthe every way
. wihtout that something extra
-
- whether it ' s a great plot or a well
- written screenplay
, or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or grat big hungry dinosaurs
-
- the movei fails
. tht ' s why the jackal
, with all its starpower
, wih all its budget
, with all its hype
, gets a big fat f
. bruce willis is tyhe bad guy
, the jackal
, a legendary killer for hire
. richard gere is tghe good guy
, a former ira assassin with a vendetta agains the jackal
. the jackal is trying to kill someone
. gere is trying to stpo him
. will gere be able to stop the assassintation in time
adn kill the jackal
?
( i ' ll give you threee guesses
,
and thge firt two don ' t count
.
) there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal
, no moment wehn you say tothe yourself
,
" i wonder what happens next
?
" teh script for the jackal isn ' t ripped straight from today ' s headlines
. it ' s ripped off
, straight from an epsiode of millennium
. throughout the movie
, we leran what the jackal ' s plans are
adn how he intends to accomplish them
. noone surprise
. the fun of a movei liek this shoud come from richard gere figuring outloud what the jackal ' s plan is
and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy
. instead
, we get twpo
( count ' em
, two
) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere
annd instantly divines the jackal ' s plan just as if he ' s frank black
( or more likely
, just as if he ' s been handed a copy of the script
)
.
and we never get more than a superficial clue as tothe why gere has had this flash of insight
. it ' s liuke gere ' s character isnt psychic
,
but neither he nor the fbi
( or the screenwriters
) seem to know it
.
and just liek in millennium
, tjhe bad guy hasnt an overwelming ened to go after the people the good guy cares about
, whether or not they are important to what he ' s trying to do or not
. whta ' s more
, iin thge last half of tyhe movei
, tje jackal
, supposedly a super
- smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake
, comes down with a major case ofthe tje stupids
. as for hte performances
.
.
. bruce willis manages to get thru the whole movei wihtout a wisecrack
, which is a major achievement
,
but not anough reason tothe see the movie
. his disguises are good
,
but nto as good or as interesting as val kilmer ' s inwhich hte saint
. richard gere is made to talk yhe entire movie in an irish accent
, which detracts from his otherwise lifeless
and dull performance
. sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie
-
- not taht his peformance is bad or anything
, it ' s not
,
but it is sad that hollywood won ' t use this talented acotr in any part other than an fbi agent
( shoot to kill
, sneakers
)
. writting a ogod plot
and a good screenplay
, like i said
, is hard
,
but it can be done
. it wasn ' t done here
. it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays
adn to denounce bad
anbd uninteresting ones
. dont not go see this movie
. yuo ' ll only encourage the producers tothe make mroe just like it
. instead
, stay home
and rent day of tjhe jackal
, or in the line of fire
, or a fier safety video
, forthe crying out loud
. anything other than the jackal
, wich lives up to its name by gnawing hte dead bones of other
, better movies
.
