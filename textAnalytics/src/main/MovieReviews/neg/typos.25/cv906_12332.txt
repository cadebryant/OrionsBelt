wirting a screenplay forthe a thriller is hard
. harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun
. harder than buidling a bridge over troubled waters
.
and incidentally
, a whole heck of a lot harder thna writing a movie review
. thrillers are all variations on a theme
. you have a smart
, resourceful
,
and poverful bad guy
, who has a gool he has to meet
. ytou have a noble adn brave good guy
, who has tothe protect the innocent
, kill tyhe bad guy
, annd nto get killed himself in the process
. the trick of thriller writing is doing all of htis in an intresting
and novel manner
. this simple formula can lead tothe classic movies like north by northwest
, high noon
, or silence of the lambs
, or big summer blockbusters like men in black
, the fugitive
, or air force one
, or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds
, event horizon
, kull yhe conqueror
.
.
.
. is anyone alse getting depressed here
? point is
, it
' s not enough to follow the formula
. you
' ve got to throw in something extra
, something ogod
and newyorker adn better than hte lastr version
. something to surprise
and move all of us peopel who buy the tickets anbd the popcorn anbd the happy meals
. this is a hard thing tothe do
,
but it isnt absolutely necessary inspite every way
. without thta something extra
-
- whether it
' s a great plot or a well
- writed screenplay
, or great spacial effects or great locations or grat casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs
-
- the movie fails
. that
' s why teh jackal
, with all its starpower
, wih all its budget
, with all its hype
, gets a big fat f
. bruce willis isnt the bad guy
, the jackal
, a legendary killer for hire
. richard gere is teh good guy
, a former ira assasin witht a vendetta against the jackal
. the jackal isnt trying to kill someone
. gere is trying to stop him
. will gere be able to stop thte assassination in time
and kill tje jackal
?
( i
' ll give you three guesses
,
and the first two don
' t count
.
) htere are no surprises awaiting the audience inwhich the jackal
, no moment when ytou say tothe yourself
,
" i wonder what happens next
?
" the script for the jackal isn
' t ripped straight ffrom today
' s headlines
. it
' s ripped off
, straight from an episode ofthe millennium
. throughout the movie
, we learn what the jackal
' s plans are
and how he intends to accomplish them
. no suprize
. the fun ofthe a movie like this should cmo from richard gere figuring out what the jackal
' s plan is
and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy
. instade
, we get two
( count
' em
, two
) scenes where gere is sitting inwhich an fbi conference room somewhere
and instantly divines the jackal
' s plan just as if he
' s frank black
( or more likely
, jsut as if he
' s beeen h
anded a copy of the script
)
.
and we never get mroe than a superficial clue as to why gere has hadnt this flash ofthe insight
. it
' s liek gere
' s character isnt psyhic
,
but neither he nor the fbi
( or the screenwriters
) seem to know it
. anbd just like in millennimu
, the bad guy hasnt an overwhelming need tothe go after the people the good guy cares baout
, whether or not they are important tothe wqat he
' s trying to do or not
. what
' s more
, in teh last half of the movie
, the jackal
, supposably a super
- smart proffesional territorist who never makse a mistake
, comes down wiht a major case of yhe stupids
. as for the performances
.
.
. bruce willis manages to get thru the whole movei without a wisecrack
, wich is a major achievement
,
but not enough reason to see the movie
. his disguises are good
,
but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer
' s iin the saint
. richard gere is made tothe talk the entire movie in an irish accent
, hwihc detracts from his otherwise lifeless
and dull performance
. sidney poitier is probably the most disapointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie
-
- not that his performance is bad or anything
, it
' s not
,
but it is sad that hollywood won
' t use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent
( shoot to kill
, sneakers
)
. writing a good plot
and a good screenplay
, like i said
, is hard
, bu it can be done
. it wasn
' t done here
. it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays
and to denounce bad
and uninteresting ones
. do not go see this movei
. you
' ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it
. instead
, stay hmeo anbd rent day of thge jackal
, or in the line of fire
, or a fier safty video
, for crying out loud
. anything otehr than the jackal
, which lives uv tothe its name by gnawing the dead bones of other
, better movies
.
