in 1990
, thte surprize success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above
- the
- title stars
, patrick swayze
, demi moore
,
and whoopi goldberg
. eight years later
, moore
and goldberg
' s careers aren
' t exactlly thriving
,
but they have had their share of screen successes usance
; the same cxan
' t be said of swayze
, who hasnt just added
yet another turkey tothe his resume with the aptly named black dog
. forget tyhe mortal kombat movies
-
- htis trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come tothe video games
. good truck driver jack crews
( swayze
) must drive a cargo of ilegle firearms ffrom atlanta tothe newyorker jersey
. along yhe way
, jack
and his crew ofthe three run into a number of obstacles
-
- such as a highway weigh station
, evil truckers
,
and deadly uzi
- firing motorcyclists
. eveyr so oftenly
, like at the end of a video game
" level
" or
" stage
,
" the main baddie pops up
: red
( meat loaf
, fresh from tje triumph of spice world
)
, who wants to steal the cache of guns
. just in case yuo forget his name or have trouble keeping track ofthe who
' s driving what
, all of red
' s vehicles
, be it a pickup or a big rig
, are painted
-
- you guessed it
-
- red
. i could go into more of yhe plot specifics
( such as jack
' s dream of haveing a nice home with his family
, the past trama that sent him to prison annd cost him his trucking licnese
, thge fbi
/ atf crew tracking tjhe cargo
)
,
but they are of little importance
. all tht matters tothe director kevin hooks
and writers william mickelberry adn dan vining are tghe obstacles jack confronts iin his drive fomr point a to point b
. bu they fail at even this modest gool
, for none of tjhe highway chaos
, as credibly staged as it is
, is terribly interesting
, let alone exciting
. once you
' ve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the frist time
, you
' ve seen it every time
. as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment
, thte saddest part about the film hasnt nothing to do with whta shows up onscreen
; it
' s that swayze has to reduce himself to such work
. hwile far from hte best of actors
, he isnt certainly not horrible
,
and he is a charismatic presence
. i don
' t know if it
' s his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve hismelf with bombs such as black dog
. regardless
, if he continues onthe htis career trcak
, coudl a tv series be far behind
