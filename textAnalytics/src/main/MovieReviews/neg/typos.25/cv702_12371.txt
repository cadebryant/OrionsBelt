in 1990
, the surprise sucess an unheralded littel movei called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio ofthe above
- the
- title stars
, patrick swayze
, demi moore
,
and whoopi goldberg
. eight years later
, moore
annd goldberg ' s careers aren ' t exactly thriving
,
bu they have had their share of screen succcesses since
; the same can ' t be said ofthe swayze
, who hasnt just added
yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog
. foreget the mortal kombat movies
-
- this trucksploitation flick isnt the closest the movies has come to video games
. good truck driver jack crews
( swayze
) must drive a cargo of ileagle firearms from atlanta to newyorker jersey
. along the way
, jack
and his crew of three run inot a number of obstacles
-
- such as a higway weigh staion
, evil truckers
,
and deadly uzi
- firing motorcyclists
. eveyr so often
, like at tjhe end ofthe a video game
" level
" or
" stage
,
" the main baddie pops up
: red
( meat loaf
, fresh from the triumph of spice world
)
, who wnats to steal the cache of guns
. just inthe case you forget his nmae or have trouble keeping track ofthe who ' s driving whta
, all of red ' s vehicles
, be it a pickup or a big rig
, are painted
-
- you guessed it
-
- red
. i could go inot more of the plot specifics
( such as jack ' s dream of hvaing a nice home whith his family
, the past trauma that sent him tothe prison
and cost him his trucking ilcense
, tje fbi
/ atf crew tracking the cargo
)
,
but they are ofthe little importance
. all that matters to director kevin hooks
and writers william mickelberry
and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a tothe point b
.
but they fail at even tihs modest goal
, forthe none of tje highway chaos
, as credibly staged as it is
, isnt terribly intresting
, let alone exicting
. once you ' ve seen a cuple of trucks bang against each otehr or a big rig explode tyhe first tyme
, you ' ve seen it every time
. as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment
, the saddest part baout the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen
; it ' s that swayze has to reduce hismelf to such work
. while far from thte best of actors
, he is certainly not horrible
,
and he is a charismatic presense
. i don ' t know if it ' s his judgment or the dearth ofthe quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as balck dog
. reguardless
, if he continues on this career trackr
, could a tv serieses be far behind
?
