* this review containes spoilers
* as with most ofthe her films
, director amy heckerling ' s latest
, losr
, seesaws between unpleasant
annd artificial
,
and is sometimes both at once
. when she tackles big issues
, such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high
, it ' s impossible to tell whther she ' s bieng marter
- of
- fact or glib baout them
( they carry an almost documentary starkness
)
,
bu whatever the case
, she continually refuses tothe comment politically
. such is tjhe sitcom tendency of her work
: to jeopardize the innocence of her characters
and
then hitted the reset button
. htis fear of drama soured me onthe fast times
.
.
.
, look who ' s talking
, clueless
,
and nowe loser
, inthe whihc ms
. heckerling also demonstrates
, fo tghe frist time
, zero affinity fo thte milieu
. hasnt anyone
, for instatance
, ever met a girl inthe the stylistic veign of mena suvari ' s dora
? attired inaddition black thrift
, her eye shaddow smeared to racoon chic
and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips
, she accepts the lable of goth
,
but noone self
- respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging
, as dora does
, thsoe geriatric rockers everclear
, nor willingly went anywhere with a six
- pack
- wielding fratboy stranger
. the mchanics ofthe loser ' s tired old introvert
- boy
- falls
- for
- extrovert
- girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non
- specificity
, so tyhat tehy become even less than sterotypes
. tehy become walking wardrobes
. small
- town transplant paul
( a strangely static jason biggs
)
, our eponymous hero
, alwyas wears his woolly hunter ' s cap with flaps covering the ears
,
and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn ' t scream
" shemp
"
( yhe lame stooge
) wig louder
. he hasnt three smug
- looking roommates
( the one
- dimensional trio is not supposted tothe be brothers
,
but they share similar facial features
, including
and especially mouths
)
,
adn their fasion sense is incomprehensibly glam
.
though they ' re nto overtly transvestites
, heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy
; how very cruising of her
.
( the dormies conspire to evict paul
and regularly molest women they haev drugged
. dora ignorantly downs noe of thier date rape potions
. unforetunately
, either heckerling or the studio isnt too cowardly tothe admiting if she ws subsequently violated
.
) when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare
, he learns that she isnt dating theri unctuous europian lit professor edward alcott
( superb greg kinnear
)
.
although paul ' s already in love with dora by tihs point
, as is bound to happen to losers whn pretty girls addres them by name
, he gets altruistic
and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott
. she ' s thrilled
,
bu nevertheless spends a few days at paul ' s to recuperate
; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery
and a broadway play
(
" cabaret
"
)
,
anbd jstu whn paul ' s got in his head that she ' s starting tothe loev him back in that non
- freindly way
, she decides to become alcott ' s live
- in girlfriend
. cue precious hommage to the graduat
, shots of paul drifting around berkeley
-
- er
.
.
.
( asside
: simon
& garfunkel ' s
" parsley
, sage
, rosemary
& thyme
" should never have beeen allowed in another motion picture
.
) heckerling has a lot in common wtih nora
" you ' ve got mial
" ephron
, tyhe only other prominent chick directing comedies today
, inthe that neither has any use for strong
- willed womens
. men continue to trod on dora utnil the bitter end
( inwhich the final scene
, she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum
)
,
and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her wiull
-
- mere hours after paul hints to her that she wass poisoned
, she ' s cheerily redecorating his apartment
.
( heckerling is so laissez
- faire about tjhe issue in general that she reserves tyhe comeuppance of the would
- be rapists for jokey epilogue titles
.
) goth veneer asside
, there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora
,
and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies baout them
. heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model
,
and while such arcs may not be heckerling ' s social responsibility
, it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were infact her shoes
.
( consider
, too
, that dora is teh film ' s sole female principal
.
) nto thast loser isnt worth contemplating this seriously
-
- god knows heckerling didn ' t
. tht isnt her hallmark
.
