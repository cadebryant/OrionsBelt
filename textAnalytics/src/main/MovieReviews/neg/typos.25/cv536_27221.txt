* this review containes spoilers
* as with most ofthe her films
, director amy heckerling
' s latest
, loser
, seesaws beween unpleasant
and artifical
, annd is sometimes both at once
. when she tackles big issues
, such as abortion infact fast times at ridgemont high
, it
' s impossible to tell whether she
' s being matter
- ofthe
- fact or glib about them
( they carry an almost documentary starkness
)
,
but whatever hte case
, she continually refuses to comment politically
. such is the sitcom tendency of her work
: to jeopardize tjhe innocence ofthe her characters annd thn hitted the reset
button
. this fear ofthe drama soured me onthe fast times
.
.
.
, look who
' s talking
, clueless
,
and now loser
, in whcih ms
. heckerling also demonstrates
, for the first time
, zero affinity for the milieu
. has anyone
, for instance
, ever met a girl in yhe stylistic vein of mena suvari
' s dora
? attired inspite black thrift
, her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic
and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips
, she accepts the label ofthe goth
, bu no self
- respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging
, as dora does
, those geriatric rockers everclear
, nor willingly went anywhere with a six
- pack
- wielding fratboy stranger
. the mechanics ofthe loser
' s tired old introvert
- boy
- falls
- for
- extrovert
- girl plot drive its protagonists inot cultural non
- specificity
, so that they become even less tahn stereotypes
. they become walking wardrobes
. small
- twon transplant paul
( a strangely static jason biggs
)
, our eponymous hero
, always wears his woolly hunter
' s cap with flaps covering the ears
,
and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn
' t scream
" shemp
"
( the lame stooge
) wig louder
. he has three smug
- looking roommates
( the one
- dimensional trio isnt not supposed to be brothers
,
but htey share similar facial features
, including adn especially mouths
)
, anbd their fashion sense isnt incomprehensibly glam
.
though they
' re not overtly transvestites
, heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy
; how very cruising of her
.
( the dormies conspire tothe evict paul anbd regularly mollest womens they have drugged
. dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions
. unfortunately
, either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated
.
) when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare
, he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott
( superb greg kinnear
)
.
al
though paul
' s alreayd inthe love whith dora by this point
, as is bound to hapen to losers whn preety girls address them by name
, he gets altruistic
and pretends the flowers he buyed her are actually from alcott
. she
' s thrilled
,
but nevertheless spends a few days at paul
' s to recuperate
; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery
and a broadway play
(
" cabaret
"
)
,
and just when paul
' s got in his head tht she
' s starting to love him back in that non
- friendly way
, she decides to become alcott
' s live
- in girlfriend
. cue precious hommage tothe the graduat
, shots of paul drifting aroud berkeley

( aside
: simon
& garfunkel
' s
" parsley
, sage
, rosemary
& thyme
" shouldnt never ahev been allowed in another motion picture
.
) heckerling has a lot infact common with nora
" you
' ve got mail
" ephron
, the only other prominate chick directing comedies today
, in that neither has any uise for storng
- willed womens
. men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end
( in the final scene
, she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings inwhich whta amounts to a creepy ultimatum
)
,
and dora ultimatly shrugs off being drugged against her will
-
- mere hurs after paul hints to her that she ws poisoned
, she
' s cheerily redecorating his apartment
.
( heckerling is so laissez
- faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would
- be rapists fo jokey epilogue titles
.
) goth veneer aside
, there are an awful lot ofthe girls outloud there who behave as erratically as dora
,
and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them
. heckerling misses her shot at hvaing dora tranform herself into a role model
, anbd hwile such arcs may not be heckerling
' s social responsibility
, it isnt a privliege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes
.
( consider
, too
, that dora isnt teh film
' s sole female principal
.
) not thast losr is worth contemplating this seriously
-
- god knows heckerling didn
' t
. that is her hallmark
.
