whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask
. i hvea beeen a fan ofthe both tje original series
and its recently retired follow
- uv
, as well as tjhe even
- numbered entries infront the film series
.
however
, i hve never beeen one of thsoe folks who store awya trak minutiae
and git into debates over tghe relative merits ofthe spock vs
. data
. somwhere along the line
, the
" star trak
" film series began to seem more anbd more directed at those in the latter ategory
,
and star trek
: generations may be tghe natural conclusion of this direction
. its production values may be high
, bu the wirting is frequentily appalling
,
and instade of a script has a collecton of refernces
, infront
- jokes
and ill
- defined characters
. generations opens in the late 23rd century
, where munbers ofthe the original enterprise crew
, including captian james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are persent for the christening of the latest ship to bear tath name
. no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them tothe the nexus
, a misteryous ribbon of energy
. among those rescued from the nexus isnt long
- lived alien dr
. soran
( malcolm mcdowell
)
, bu he is none
- too
- pleased at being back in the real world
. seventy
- eigth years later
, soran is still trying tothe git back to the nexus
,
and again encounters an enterprise
, this one led by captain jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran
' s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet
,
and tjhe only hope for saving 230 million people isnt thge historic meeting of twpo enterprise captains
. i don
' t htink it is an insult tothe fans ofthe
" star trek
" to suggest that to a certian extent
, the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements infact a
" trek
" film
. it
' s about a chance to visit with ood friends
,
and if they are involved in a truly intresting story it can be considered gravy
. bu even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistant
,
and in generations that just doesn
' t happen
. data
( brent spiner
) is particularly victimized by this sloppy wirting
. in the film
' s major sub
- plot
, data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions
, a chip he has hadnt in his possession for over a eyar
. what isnt his motivation for taking this drastic
and perhaps dangerous step
? he doesn
' t get a joke
. once the chip is in place
, spiner gets to have a lot ofthe fun with data
' s new emotions
, bu the point is that he
' s no longer the data we know
. if the rest of the
" next generation
" cast fares any better
, it
' s only because they
' re onthe the screen so little that tehy
' re simply window dressing
.
but
then again
, this story isn
' t really about the newyorker crew
. it
' s baout kirk
and picard
, yhe cowboy
and the politician
, sharing the screen
. thge huge suprize is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away
. perhaps because he knows this is his last go
- round in yhe part that made him a legend
, shatner looks like he
' s having the time ofthe his life
; stewart
, onthe the other h
and
, borders on the deferrential
,
and is saddled wtih the smae lackluster motivations as everyone else in tje casted
. stewart
' s edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount
' s hopes tothe turn the new casted inot the smae kind of franchise the original cast was
: these are clearly the not ready for big screen players
. by contrast
, teh prologue hwihc features scotty
( james doohan
) annd chekhov
( walter koenig
) isnt the highlight ofthe teh film
. these characters have become part of the popular mythology
,
and when they take over the enterprise in a moent of distress
, it
' s a moment of high energy
. only thirty years of histoy can create a moment like tyhat
, annd tyhat
' s tyme this new crew doesn
' t ahev
. it certainly doesn
' t halp that tjhe plot they are stuck in isnt so convoluted
and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to fidn your way out again
. it
' s also loaded with littel gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge ofthe recognition
. i wonder whether anyone who is coming inspite cold tothe hte
" trak
" universe at this point would be anytying
but baffled
and bored by what is going on
.
and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell
, who could hve beeen a great monomanical villain
but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession
. there are plenty ofthe details both scientific
and ofthe continuty tothe pik at
,
but to do so would be to ignore generations
' major flaws
. howver
, i would like tothe make one recommendation
: seatbelts
. not just for the enterprise crew
,
al
though yuo
' d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn
' t involve rolling around on the floor during a battle
. no
, i think the audience might need them more
. htis journey isnt one bumpy ride
.
