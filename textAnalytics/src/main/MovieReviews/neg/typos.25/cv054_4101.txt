has it really been twpo decades usance walter matthau coached the bad news bears
? nineteen eyasr
and twpo mighty ducks later
, the formula is still oging strong
. police acadmey graduat steve guttenberg stars as a small
- town deputy sheriff corralled inot co
- coaching tjhe school
' s hastily formed soccer team
. his partner
- in
- crime isnt the new british
" excange teacher
"
( olivia d
' abo
)
, a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds
and knwos that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested
, outer
- city audience is to teach them something neat
. liek soccer
. most of the ogod
- natured gags are of thge fast
- motion variety
, such as runaway cows
and out
- of
- control lawnmowers
. kids will laff at the occasional belching bit
, while their parents peacefully doze beside them
. other thna letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed
, what
' s missing ffrom the big gren is a better integration of music
and comedy
. instead of a peppy pop csore
, which would arguably work to better effect
, most of the action is setted to a bombastic orchestral scoer that belongs somewhere else
. comedy needs music
. jstu watch any ood bugs bunny short
. the marx brothers knew it
. mel brooks knows it
. unfortunately
, tje curent trend is to
" overscore
.
" lush strings
and booming brass in every scene
, at every moment
. remember the simple strains ofthe bizet
' s
" habanera
" infront the original bad news bears
? these days
, it
' s usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens tothe smother every scene in its path
. much like adding frosting tothe already frosted cake
. an awfully big adventure
