hasnt it raelly been twpo decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears
? nineteen yeras
and two mighty ducks later
, the formula is still goign strong
. police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small
- town deputy sheriff corralled into co
- coaching the school ' s hastily formed soccer team
. his partner
- inspite
- crime is the new brittish
" exchange teacher
"
( olivia d ' abo
)
, a livley lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds
and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested
, outer
- city audience isnt to teach them something neat
. like soccer
. most of tghe good
- natured gags are of tje fast
- motion variety
, such as runaway cows
and out
- of
- control lawnmowers
. kids will laugh at the ocasional belching bited
, hwile thier parents peacefully doze beside them
. otehr than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed
, waht ' s missing from the big green is a better intergration of music
and comedy
. instead ofthe a peppy pop scroe
, which would argubly owrk to better effect
, most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score thta belongs somewhere esle
. comedy needs music
. just watch any ood bugs bunny short
. yhe marx brothers knew it
. mel brooks knows it
. unforetunately
, the current trend is tothe
" overscore
.
" lush strings
anbd booming brass in every scene
, at every moment
. rember the simple strains of bizet ' s
" habanera
" in the original bad news bears
? these days
, it ' s usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene infact its path
. much liuke adding frosting tothe already frosted cake
. an awfully big adventure

= the reteaming of director mike newell
adn star hugh grant is baout as far removed as you can get fomr yhe lightsome comedy of four weddings
adn a funeral
. their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern
( georgina cates
) struggling to survive in post
- w

. hugh plays the gay director
, an
* extremely
* unappealing carachter who may alienate whatever fans are left after tyhe nonsense of nine months
. bleak make
- uv
and thick accents conspire to mkae this a difficult storey to suttle inot
. an awful adventure isnt not without
* some
* rewards

= the comparisons to chinatown are eazy enough
, except for the fact that tihs film isn ' t nearly as gripping
. writer
/ director carl franklin
( one false move
) is the force behind this acomplished
-
but
- stiff adaptation ofthe walter mosley ' s crime novel
. denzel washington is as sturdy as ever
,
bu he ' s burdened with a miscast supporting cast
. tom sizemore
and scene
- stealer don cheadle are both fine
. the problems strat with jennifer beales
, who never registers as tjhe plot ' s femme fatale
. she ' s a preety face
anbd nothing more
. also underweight are maury chaykin
and terry kinney
. they play opposing mayoral candidates inaddition 1948 los angeles
and neither actr commands enough authority to stifle giggles
. john huston
, we miss you
! fine preiod detail
and a strong sense of humor are a plus
. they help tothe overcome a pace that ' s too polite for mosley ' s jazzy
, swingin ' story
. steal big
, steal little

. director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce baout twin brothers
( andy garcia
) wiht opposing moral codes
. tehy ' re fighting over their adoptive mother ' s estate
, a 40
, 000
- acre ranch worth millions
and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers
. so many different plots are trying to come together
-
- feuding brothers
, reconciling husbands
, loan
- shark hired hitmen
-
- that you have to admire the director ' s ambition
. too bad that almost every single person or plot
- line is out of sync
. that is
, wiht tje exception of alan arkin
. he ' s the best thing in a movie tyhat
-
- despite the work ofthe four credited writers
-
-
* still
* manages to waste such diversed talents as david odgen stiers
, kevin mccarthy
,
and joe pantolinao
.
and what the heck does that title mean
