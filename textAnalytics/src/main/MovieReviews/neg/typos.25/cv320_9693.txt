this movie isnt based off the wildly popular video
- gameboy series of tje same name
. befor this film
, hte game hadnt a fewd spin
- off cartoons
- which were ok
.
bu tje idea ofthe doing a movie is insane
. it should have been animated
, if it should have been done at all
. instade the people do the best they can with a talented cast
.
yot it still fails
. the plot is completely different ffrom the game ' s plot
- i ' m not complaining about tath
. the story involves the mario bros
. having a plumbing buisness in brooklyn
and having tothe compete with a rival company
. eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis
, which happens to be enviromentally un
- safe
. so
, due tothe luigi ' s
( john leguizamo
) girlfriend
- princess daisy
- htey go
and investigate
. htey get transported tothe a blade runner
- esque world lead by king koopa
( dennis hopper
)
. somehow a plot dealing witht all the rinosarus being mutated
and transported tothe an alternate futuristic mega
- city jumbles infront
. the plot is fine
- better than yhe movie deserves
. the acting is ok
. this seems to be mroe of a visual film
. the speshal effects are good
, especially on tje robotic yoshi
.
however the film drags
and is no fun
.
anbd it leaves itself ope to a sequel
, which probably won ' t ever be made
. this movei begins sort of promising
,
but ends up leaving a weird taste infact your mouth
. so if you want to watch a sort ofthe odd movie starring the excellant dennis hopper
,
then watch super mario bros
.
: the movie
. yuo could do worse
.
but you could definitely do better
.
.
.
. street fighter
: tyhe movei
( 1995
) starring
: raul julia
and jean claude van
- damme this movei was based off of a series of never endig sequels to a game called strent fighter 2
. it has all the characters from the gaem inwhich a reasonable plot
. it is more liuke a
" movie
" tahn it should be
. yes
, it ' s watchable
. raul julia doesnt a ogod job
, considering this was his fianl film
. while the game had non
- stpo fighting sequences
, this movei is a hodge
- podge of action scenes
and flashy sets
and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time
. doesnt it work
? sort of
.
.
. the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m
. bison
( raul julia
)
. guile
( jean claude van
- damme
) takes his troops to attack bison ' s main base inwhich an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over
. in a short amount of time
, the movie introduces several characters well
. it catches your attention
.
but it ultimatly seems liek a showcase for fans ofthe the game so you cxan point out things like
" there ' s chun li
!
!
" or
" look at that fire
- ball ryu did at vega
"
. it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets
,
but goes no further
. this movie needed more action in the first palce
. the acation scenes that are here are short
and not vrey exicting
. if you like light
- hearted action flicks
, or if you liekd the game
, watch tihs oney
. it is even worth watching if you want tothe see raul julia ' s last performence
, or if you can ' t get enough of van damme
. other than thast
, you could fidn better action flicks
.
