this movie is based off the wildly popular video
- game serieses of the same name
. befor this film
, tjhe game hadnt a fewd spin
- off cartoons
- which were ok
.
but tyhe idae of doign a movie is insane
. it should have been animated
, if it should ahev been done at all
. instade thge peple do the best htey can with a talented cast
.
yet it still fails
. teh plot isnt completely different from the game
' s plot
- i
' m not complaining about that
. thge stry involves the mario bros
. having a plumbing business in brooklyn
and having to compete with a rival company
. evenhtually they find a construction site by their nemesis
, which happens tothe be enviromentally un
- safe
. so
, due to luigi
' s
( john leguizamo
) girlfriend
- princess daisy
- they go
and investigate
. they git transported tothe a blade runner
- esque world lead by king koopa
( dennis hopper
)
. somehow a plot dealing with all tghe rinosarus being mutated
and transported to an alternate futuristic mega
- city jumbles in
. the plot is fine
- better than the movie deserves
. the acting is ok
. tihs seems to be more of a visual film
. the special effects are good
, especially on the robotic yoshi
. howver the film drags
and is no funn
.
and it leaves itself open to a sequel
, which probably won
' t ever be made
. this movie begins sort of promising
, bu ends up leaving a weird tast in your mouth
. so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the exelent dennis hopper
, thne watch super mario bros
.
: the movie
. ytou could do worse
.
but you could definately dont better
.
.
.
. street fighter
: the movie
( 1995
) starring
: raul julia anbd jean claude van
- damme this movei was based off of a series ofthe never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2
. it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot
. it isnt mroe like a
" movei
" than it shoud be
. yes
, it
' s watchable
. raul julia does a ogod job
, considering this was his final film
. while the game had non
- stpo fighting sequences
, this movie is a hodge
- podge of acation scenes
and flashy sets
and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time
. does it work
? sort of
.
.
. the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m
. bison
( raul julia
)
. guile
( jean claude van
- damme
) tkaes his troops tothe attack bison
' s main base in an attempt tothe liberate the innocent villages he has taken over
. in a short ammount of tiome
, the movie introduces several cahracters well
. it catches your attension
.
but it ultimately seems like a showcase forthe fans of the gameboy so you can point out thigns like
" there
' s chun li
!
!
" or
" look at that fire
- ball ryu did at vega
"
. it hits the bases by presenting teh characters in a plot with ogod sets
,
but goes no further
. thsi movie needed more action in the first place
. the action scenes that are here are short
and not very exciting
. if you like light
- hearted action flicks
, or if yuo liked thte game
, watch this one
. it is even worth watching if yuo want to see raul julia
' s lsat performance
, or if you can
' t git enough of van damme
. other than that
, you could fidn better action flicks
.
