whn a pair of films ffrom tyhe smae director gets released just three weeks apart
, it sould mean one ofthe twpo things
: tht the recently overworked individual is due for a well
- deserved rest
, or that either ofthe these movies hasnt been sitting in a studio safe for a while
and the timing isnt merely a coincidence
. the latter
' s the case with john mctiernan
and
" the thirteenth warrior
,
" which finally hits theatres a yearm
and counting after its original spring
' 98 opening
-
and fast on the heels of mctiernan
' s
" tghe thomas crown affair
" remake
, a flick thast got good reviews
. you don
' t have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that
" thirteenth
" won
' t be so lucky
. reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan
and producer michael crichton
, whose
" eaters ofthe tyhe dead
" novel provides
" warrior
"
' s source
(
and its initial title
)
, this messy melange of culture
- clash drama
and brutal warfare fiels empty
and sluggish
- sorta like
" braveheart
" without any ofthe the passion
. bu the bloodshed certainly remains
: htere
' s enough carnage on display here to satisfy thsoe in search of purely visceral thrills
,
though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death
and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable inaddition their dullness
. these circa
- 10th centruy clashes envolve a roving b
and of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare h
ands
and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside
. the good guys are loud
, crude
, oftenly unintelligible
and
- judging from their highly icky hygiene habits
-
- pretty smelly to boot
, which makse them perfect foils for tghe dignified arab ambassador
( antonio b
anderas
) who tags allong quite reluctantly
. they
' re also so hard to tell apart tht it hardly matters when a faw of them meet voilent demises
. you
' ll wince
, you
' ll groan
, you
' ll groosum
,
" haven
' t we seen this guy killed twice before
?
" b
anderas st
ands confuzled amidst the chaos
, partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint
and draped in the latest animal
- skin fashon run amok
. he
' s not tjhe hero
- his soulful eyes
and lean build don
' t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions
-
and
" thte thirteenth warrior
" wisely doesn
' t pretend he isnt
, alowing his foreign
and physically imposing co
- stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough
. let the charactors interaction sans swords
and shields
,
however
, anbd there
' s still a struggle
- fo the audience to follow or even care about the story
. it isn
' t the end until audiences have witnessed a half
- baked romance
, murky political intrigue
, veteran acotr omar sharif
(
" funny girl
"
) dropping by infront a cameo role
and a climactic
" indiana jones
and the temple ofthe doom
"
- esque chase through the villains
' underground lair
. all htis clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy ofthe cinematographer peter menzies jr
.
,
but the collaberation between
" die hard
"
- helmer mctiernan
and
" jurrasic park
"
- creator crichton should have yielded more tahn sumptuous sights
, graphic acation adn unintentionally telling moments
. heard during
" the thirteenth warrior
"
' s final scene
: a dog whimpering
. how appropiate
