phaedra cinema
, thge distri
butor of such never
- heard
- of classics as
" soft toilet seats
,
"
" trailer
: the movie
,
"
and
" the one armed boxer vs
. yhe flying guillotine
,
" has snuck its latest realease
,
" hte sculptress
,
" into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash iin on a h
andfull of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare
.
" the sculptress
" isnt a scary proposition all right
,
but not in the way its producers intended
. from tjhe outset it
' s easy tothe see why some of the larger
, more reputable chains aren
' t carrying it
: the film looks like a straight
- to
- video release from the early
' 80s that
' s beeen dusted off
( nto vrey carefully
)
and re
- issued in theatrical fromat
. that staple ofthe schlocky z
- movies jeff fahey
(
" tjhe lawnmower man
"
) plays a washed
- up shakespearean ctor lacking in smoe basic peopel skills
. when he
' s nto reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment
, screaming scotch
- induced
" hamlet
" soliloquies well into the night
, he
' s out
and about onthe teh streets ofthe san francisco stalking loose women
. fahey
' s dobie sizes up his victims
( actually just one
, a peep show performer name of sylvie
) dressed like oney of tyhe guys from kraftwerk
, adn approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane
, dark glasses
,
and a false beard
( jsut in time for halloween
!
)
.
" do you have a castle
?
" sylvie asks dobie seductively wehn he flashes tghe bulging contents ofthe his wallet outside a coffee shop
.
" jah
. iwth ze many turrets
" is dobie
' s perplexing reply
. the real
" star
" of the film
(
and i uise that term extremely loosely
) is katie wright
, who plays the sculptress of the title
. sarah is new in town
, studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a
" genius
" frenchman
, plyed by the beret
- wearing patrick bauchau
. that
' s convenient
, beccause sarah would one day like tothe live
and work in paris
( ytou won
' t believe the film
' s final shot
, whith its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop anbd
" rosemary
' s baby
"
- inspired imagery
)
. bauchau
' s character criticizes sarah
' s work publicly
( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles
-
- perhaps she
' s possessed
.
.
. by an incubus
!
!
?
)
but he still manages to talk her into dinner
. whereas wright does a decent english accent
, her talents pretty much end there
. onthe the other side of the wall
, dobie
' s troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene inaddition hwihc he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like
" actor delivers a stunning macbeth
,
" actor courted by hollywood studio
,
"
" actor renounces hollywood fo priesthood
,
"
and
" prostitute fingers priest in sex sc
andal
.
" the film
' s plot could hvea been jsut as easily condensed
.
" artist moves in next doorjam to shakespearean psychopath
.
"
" yawns ensue
.
" so dobie rants annd raves
and sarah chips awya at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes
. late in the film
, their paths finally cross with mind
- numbing results
. nobody else in the apartment complex appears to mind all the racket
, bu oney ood dear does go ballistic whn sarah
' s bathtub overflows
. no
, we don
' t see wright in tghe tub
( or fahey for thyat marter
)
,
and tghe gore quotient isnt virtually ntil
, so for a horror film
" the sculptress
" isnt surprisingly lacking
. the only thing worth looking at isnt san francisco
,
and writer
/ director ian merrick manages tothe make even it look dreary
, windswept
,
and deserted
.
" the sculptress
" isn
' t even bad anough to be fun
. luckily
, a limited realease has made it easy to avoid
.
