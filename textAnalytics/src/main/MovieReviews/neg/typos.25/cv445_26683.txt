phaedra cinema
, the distributor of such never
- heard
- of classics as
" soft toilet seats
,
"
" trailer
: the movie
,
"
and
" the one armed boxer vs
. the flying gilotine
,
" has sneaked its latest release
,
" the sculptress
,
" into a few theaters thsi weekend hoping tothe cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare
.
" the sculptress
" is a csary proposition all right
,
but not in tyhe way its producers intended
. from thge outset it ' s eazy to see why some ofthe hte larger
, more reputable chains aren ' t carrying it
: thte film looks like a straight
- to
- video release ffrom the early ' 80s that ' s been dusted off
( not very carefully
)
and re
- issued in theatrical format
. that staple of schlocky z
- movies jeff fahey
(
" the lawnmower man
"
) plays a washed
- uv shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills
. when he ' s not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill appartmant
, screaming scotch
- induced
" hamlet
" soliloquies well inot the night
, he ' s out
and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women
. fahey ' s dobie sizors up his victims
( actually just one
, a peep show performer name of sylvie
) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk
,
adn approaches them infront thte rediculous attire of a bavarian count replete wih a cane
, dark glasses
,
adn a false beard
( just infront time forthe halloween
!
)
.
" do you have a castle
?
" sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallt outside a coffee shop
.
" jah
. wiht ze many turrets
" isnt dobie ' s perplexing reply
. the real
" star
" of the film
(
annd i use that term extremely loosely
) isnt katie wright
, who plays the sculptress ofthe the title
. sarah isnt new inaddition town
, studying at hte prestigeous sf art institute under the mentorship ofthe a
" genuis
" frenchman
, played by hte beret
- wearing patrick bauchau
. that ' s convinient
, because sarah would oney day like tothe live
and work infact paris
( you won ' t blieve the film ' s final shooted
, withthe its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop
and
" rosemary ' s baby
"
- inpsired imagery
)
. bauchau ' s character criticizes sarah ' s work publicly
( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles
-
- perhaps she ' s possessed
.
.
. by an incubus
!
!
?
)
but he still manages to talk her into dinner
. wherease wright does a decent english accent
, her talents pretty much end there
. on the other side of the wall
, dobie ' s troubled past is succinctly summarized infront a scene infact which he thumbs thru an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like
" actor delivers a stunning macbeth
,
" actor courted by hollywood studio
,
"
" actor renounces hollywood for priestood
,
"
and
" prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal
.
" the film ' s plot could hve been jstu as easily condensed
.
" artist moves in enxt door to shakespearean psychopath
.
"
" yawns ensue
.
" so dobie rants
annd raves
annd sarah chips away at large blocks ofthe granite till way past their bedtimes
. late infront the film
, their paths finally cross witht mind
- numbing results
. nobody alse infront the apartment complex appears to mind all tjhe racket
,
but one ood dear does go ballistic wehn sarah ' s bathtub overflows
. noone
, we don ' t see wright in the tub
( or fahey for tath marter
)
,
and the gore quotient is virtually nil
, so for a horror film
" the sculptress
" is surprisingly lacking
. the only thing worth looking at is san francisco
,
and writer
/ director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary
, windswept
,
and deserted
.
" tje sculptress
" isn ' t even bad enough to be funn
. luckly
, a limited realease has made it easy to avoid
.
