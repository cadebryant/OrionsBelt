anbd acotr
/ magincian ricky jay as capt
. amazing ' s manager
. teh cast includes four oscar
- nominated actors
! when i saw the list of players eearly last year
, i figured tyhe result would be a can ' t
- miss comedy
.
yot
, i must report disappointment
. the script is probably tjhe worst of 1999
. nearly every joke misfires
. the stabs at comic books are too obvious tothe be funny
.
( for example
, no one cin recogise capt
. amazing inthe his secret identity because he ' s wearing glasses
.
) the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work
. the cast tries hard
, expecially hank azaria
, whose character adopts an effete british accent hwile in costume
,
but the script isnt jsut too lame to run
.
