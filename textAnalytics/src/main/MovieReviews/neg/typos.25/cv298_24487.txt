- nominated actors
! when i saw the list of players early lastest year
, i figured the result owudl be a can
' t
- miss comedy
. yot
, i must report disappointment
. the script is probably the worst of 1999
. nearly eveyr joke misfires
. the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny
.
( for example
, no one can recognize capt
. amazing iin his secret identity because he
' s wearing glasses
.
) the fart jokes sorrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work
. tje casted tries hard
, especially hank azaria
, whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume
,
but thte script is just too lame to run
.
