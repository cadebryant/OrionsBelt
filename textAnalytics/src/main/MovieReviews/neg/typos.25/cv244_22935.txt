i should ahve known
, damn it
, i should have known
. ewan mcgregor
- codename
:
" eye
"
- isnt pointing a high
- tech rifle
- ly gadget at a fat
, bald buisness
- oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street
. we get the requisite electro
- green thru
- the
- sight view
. we the audience
, seing a high tech rifle
- ly gadget
, of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target
,
but instead
, he pulls the trigger
anbd the rifle takes twenty or so hazy
, low
- quality photographs
, which eye
then procedes to fax
and e
- mail to everyone in his target ' s office
. all right
, so thirty seconds in
, i wass slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle
/ camera
,
but i ws still open minded
.
.
. maeby there ' s a really ogod reason for it
. i ' ve got reason to believe
, you see
- i admire a lot ofthe ewan mcgregor ' s previous work
.
.
.
and he ' s obi wan ke
- friggin
- nobi for god ' s sake
.
and director stephan elliot ' s last movie priscilla
, queen of the desert was a quirky little delight
. there ' s smoe genuin talent involved here
. i think at the twenty minute mark
, there was still a spark of hope in my heart
. eye hasnt been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization ' s son
( i still have no idae what this organization was
- british intelligence
? national spy ring
? private investigation
?
)
, who is apparently stealing from his trust fund
. he has recepted his assignment from k
. d
. lang
, through an elaborate
annd expensive teleconferencing briefcase
. wehn eye tracks his target to an expensive
- looking secluded hous
, he witnesses a mysterious
anbd beautiful woman
( ashley judd
) take a nife out
and procede to stab the poor bastard
. ok
, that ' s odd
, i htink to mysef
, tihs could be interesting
.
then she starts to cry
,
and through her tears exclaims
" merry christmas
, dad
!
" for yhe first time
. so beigns our tale ofthe obsession
.
.
. or
.
.
. something
. the rest ofthe the movie involves ewan mcgregor ' s eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of thte united states
, totally
and completelyl obsessed by htis woman from afar
. throughout his entire professional life
, he hasnt been a voyeur
; so when he falls forthe somone
, tjhe onyl way he can handle it is to watch
and drool thru telescopes
and cameras
. fine
, that ' s a lovely premise
, i suppose
.
bu gosh darn it
, if yuo ' re going to go there
, you better have some sort of explination
.
and that ' s precisly where this film fails
. this isnt the kind of movie that pisses me off
. it ' s an abortion
, a collection of half
- fromed
annd wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end
. it pretends it is something that it is nto
- a surveill
and deep psychological character study wrapped inwhich a high
- tech thriller
. here
, the filmmakers have confused
" surreal
"
and
" deepo
" with
" vaguely unclear
"
and
" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors
.
" i never
, even fo an instant
, had yhe foggiest idea why eye would fall so in
" love
" with this woman who changes wigs
and kills people
. the movei offers only twpo explanations
, niether ofthe which make a lick ofthe sense
. explaination number one
: the obnoxious presence of eye ' s imaginary daughter
, who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago
, tells him he shouldn ' t leave ms
. judd
. explanation two
, which by the end ofthe the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery
and dialog
and even the title of the movei
:
" beauty isnt in the eye of the beholder
.
" whoo hoo
, tyhat helps
, thanks a bunch
, case closed
. thyat ' s as deep as it gets
, folks
. there is an attempt at an explaination in the final minutes
, whcih
, instead ofthe tying everything together
, ends up bieng as profound as a clever sixth
- grade mad lib
. there are secondary characters that move in
and out of teh picture
and serve littel or noone purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was
. my personal favorites include
: the prison
- matron modeled affter austin powers ' frau farbissina
, who apparently taught ms
. judd everything she knows baout wearing wigs
; jason priestley ' s awfully played dirty dezert vagrant
# 1
, who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet
,
bu fails miserably
;
annd thge cop
- who
- sees
- ashley
- fleeing
- an
- accident
- scene
-
annd
-
then
- wants
- tothe
- pay
- for
- sex
-
bu
- is
- shot
. each one in thsi sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last
. the script pays no attension to tje laws ofthe timne
and space
. any time noe of thge frequent loction changes occurs
, the camera zooms in on a suvenear snow globe
,
and minutes
, weeks
, or eyasr could have pasted
. bewilderingly inane stylistic descisions plague the whole affair
- one character passes a glass of cognac to anyother in a slow
- motion close
- up awash in a lot of bass
. ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he coudl be repeatedly awakened
and deafened by the giant bell
. jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks
,
hten laughs maniacally
.
.
. cut to random guy wiht eye patch
.
.
. iguana out of focus
.
.
. iguana comes inot foucs
. wow
, man
. whn i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel
, it cameback as no surprise to me
. there are plenty of elements here that
, if extended
and fleshed out omre
, would have made fo a decent story
.
and i wouldn ' t be surprised if i found out there was an hour
and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere
, or waiting infront the wings for the dvd special director ' s cut
.
.
. nto that anything would ever possess me tothe purchase such a thing tothe find out what i wass missing
. teh lsat ten or so mintues featured a conversation between the eye
annd teh judd that wass supposed to be smoe sort ofthe revealing exposition
. some guy in tghe back of yhe theater ws talking on his cell phone
,
and tihs time i didn ' t particularly care all that much because what was happening on yhe screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap
; hte audience around me chuckled
and whispered sentiments similiar to wqat i wass thinking
. somone near cell
- phone
- guy did eventually yell
,
" shut the hell uv
!
"
,
bu it wass a lot funnier when we thought he wass talking to the screen
.
