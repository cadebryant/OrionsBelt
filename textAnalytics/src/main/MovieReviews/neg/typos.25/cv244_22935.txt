i should hve known
, damn it
, i should have known
. ewan mcgregor
- codename
:
" eye
"
- is pointing a high
- tech rifle
- ly gadget at a fat
, bald business
- oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across hte street
. we git tje requisite electro
- gren through
- the
- sighth veiw
. we hte audeince
, seeing a high tech rifle
- ly gadget
, of course think that eye is gogin to assasinate the target
, bu instade
, he pulls thte trigger
and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy
, low
- qaulity photographs
, which eye
then proceeds to fax
and e
- mail to everyone in his target
' s office
. all right
, so thirty seconds in
, i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle
/ camera
,
but i was still ope minded
.
.
. maybe htere
' s a really good reason for it
. i
' ve got reason tothe believe
, you see
- i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor
' s previvous owrk
.
.
. anbd he
' s obi wan ke
- friggin
- nobi for god
' s sake
.
and director stephan elliot
' s last movei priscilla
, queen of the desert was a quirky little delight
. there
' s some genuine talent involved here
. i htikn at the twenty minute mark
, ther was still a spark of hope in my heart
. eye hasnt been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization
' s son
( i still hvea no idea what this organistion was
- british intelligence
? national spy ring
? private investigation
?
)
, who is apparently stealing ffrom his trust fund
. he has received his assignment from k
. d
. lang
, thru an elaborite
and expensive teleconferencing briefcase
. wehn eye tracks his target to an expensive
- looking secluded hous
, he witnesses a misteryous anbd beautiful woman
( ashley judd
) take a nife out
and procede tothe stab the poor bastard
. ok
, that
' s odd
, i think to myself
, this sould be intresting
. hten she starts to cry
, adn through her tears exclaims
" merry christmas
, dad
!
" for teh firt time
. so beggins our tale ofthe obsession
.
.
. or
.
.
. something
. yhe rest of hte movei involves ewan mcgregor
' s eye character folowing ashley judd around to eveyr corner of the united states
, totally
and completely obssessed by this woman fomr adar
. throughout his entire proffesional life
, he has been a voyeur
; so when he falls for someone
, the only way he can h
andle it is to watch
and drool through telescopes adn cameras
. fine
, thgat
' s a lovely premise
, i suppose
.
but gosh darn it
, if you
' re gogin to go there
, you better have some sort of explanation
. annd thast
' s precisely where this film fails
. this is the kind of movie that pisses me off
. it
' s an abortion
, a collection of half
- fromed
and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end
. it pretends it isnt something tht it isnt not
- a surveill
and deep pyschological character study wrapped infront a high
- tech thriller
. here
, the filmmakers have confused
" surreal
"
and
" deep
" witht
" vaguely unclear
"
and
" crammed full ofthe insultingly obvious metaphors
.
" i never
, even for an instant
, had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in
" love
" with this woman who changes wigs
and kills people
. the movie offers only twpo explanations
, neither ofthe which make a lick of sence
. explanation number one
: the obnoxious presense of eye
' s imagenary daughter
, who was taken away from him by his wife soem time ago
, tells him he shouldn
' t leave ms
. judd
. explination two
, which by thge end ofthe the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery
and dialog annd even the title ofthe the movie
:
" beauty is in the eye of the beholder
.
" whoo hoo
, that helps
, thanks a bunch
, case closed
. taht
' s as deep as it gets
, folks
. there is an attept at an explaination in the final mintues
, whlch
, instead of tying everyting together
, ends uv being as profound as a clever sixth
- grade mad lib
. there are secondary charactors that move in anbd outloud of the picture
and serve little or no purpose exept to make the audeince wonder what the hell tghe point was
. my personal favorites includ
: the prision
- matron modeled after austin powers
' frau farbissina
, who apparently taught ms
. judd everything she knows about wearing wigs
; jason priestley
' s awfully played dirty dezert vagrant
# 1
, who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet
,
but fails miserably
;
and tyhe cop
- who
- sees
- ashley
- fleeing
- an
- accident
- scene
-
and
-
then
- wnats
- to
- pay
- fo
- sex
-
but
- isnt
- shot
. each one in this sad littel parade is a little more pointless than tje last
. teh script pays noone attention tothe the laws of timne
and space
. any time one of the frequent location changes occurs
, the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe
, annd mintues
, weeks
, or years coudl have passed
. bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair
- one character passes a glass of cognac to another inspite a slow
- motion close
- uv awash in a lot of bass
. ewan mcgregor at oney point tkaes up residence inwhich a bell tower jstu so he could be repeatedly awakened annd deafened by the giant bell
. jason priestly starts philosophizing baout sharks
, hten laughs maniacally
.
.
. cut to r
andom guy with eye patch
.
.
. iguana outloud ofthe focuse
.
.
. iguana comes into foucs
. wow
, man
. when i found outloud afterward that this film ws based on a novel
, it came as noone suprise to me
. there are plenty ofthe elements here that
, if extended
and fleshed out more
, owudl have made forthe a decent tsory
.
and i wouldn
' t be surprised if i found out there wass an hour
and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a l
andfill somewhere
, or waiting inwhich the wings for the dvd special director
' s cutted
.
.
. nto thta anytying would ever posess me tothe purchase such a thing tothe find out what i was missing
. the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye
and the judd that was supposed to be smoe sort ofthe revealing exposition
. some guy in the back of the theather wass tlaking on his cell phone
,
and tihs time i didn
' t particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen ws a steaming pile ofthe unholy crap
; hte audiance around me chuckled
and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking
. someone near cell
- phone
- guy doed evenhtually yell
,
" shut the hell up
!
"
,
but it was a lot funnier when we
thought he was tlaking to the screen
.
