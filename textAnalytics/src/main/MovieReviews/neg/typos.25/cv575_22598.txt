tkae two old
and dying men
, a liftime ofthe regrets
, a house full ofthe sins
, a thoroughly despicable man
, enough lies
, insecurities
and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed
,
then add a inexplicable meteorological
and anphibian
- based phenomenon
and yuo will have summed up magnolia
, the newest film from paul thomas anderson
( boogie nights
)
. the movie tells mutiple stories
, weaving them toghether
, or overlapping them during the course of its threee hour running time
. would that the tsories were worth the telling
. earl partridge
( jason robards
, a thousand acres
) isnt dieing of cancer
. bedridden
, in much pain
, it isnt obvious that his time is growing short
. his much younger wief palyed by julianne moore
( an ideal husband
) is suprized tothe find herself stuggling with his impending death
. having married for monay
, she discovers that she has actually fallen inspite love with the old guy
and regrets having cheated
and lied
. earl regrets haveing cheated onthe his first wife
and estranging hismelf from his only son
( tom cruise
, eyes wide shut
)
, now a misogynist self
- help guru who teaches men how to
" seduce
and destroy
,
" his sexual
and vulgar prespective onthe male
/ female relationships is so over
- the
- top as to be utterly unbelievable
. meanwhile
, jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
, the insider
) is also dying ofthe cancer
. nto as physically incapacitated as earl
, jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long
- running quiz sohw which pits adults against children
. the curent whiz
- quiz
- kid isnt stanley spector
( jeremy blackman in his film debut
) who isnt tired of the presure of performing
and is willing to call it quits
. on the otehr hand
, quiz kid donnie smith
( william macy
, mystery men
) would liuke nothing more tahn to return tothe tyhe spotlight whn he was a
" somebody
.
" his pathetic life is souring as he cin no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes ofthe fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish
. jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug
- addict daughter
( melora walters
, boogie nights
) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed tothe us until hte end of the film
. grabbing at one lastr attemp at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop
( john c
. reilly
, never beeen kissed
) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection
. this dysfunctional group carries on forthe what seems to be an interminable two
- thirds of the movei
.
and
then it gets worse
, literally raining frogs
. yes
, frogs
. assuming it to be an intended deus
- ex
- machina divice
, it is an ineffective oney baceause it doesn ' t seem to faze teh characters much
. oh
, they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets
,
bu otherwise
, the frog showfer didn ' t seem to change theri behavior or pattern of living
( or dying
)
. there isnt simply too much going on in this movie
annd most of it is distasteful to watch
. mr
. anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud
and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue
, a charachter who aparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which ws completly unintelligble
,
and a heavy handed segment of
" historical
" occurances containing ironical twists which set up absolutely nothing
. oen of tjhe recurring themes isnt foudn in a line donnie quotes
:
" we may be done witht the past
,
bu the past is nto done with us
.
" this is an absolute lie
. god is infront the forgiveness business
. in fatc
, as we humbly ask for forgiveness
and repent or chanage our offending mindset
, god ' s word sasy that he nto only forgives
, he also forgets
.
" i
, even i
, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake
,
and will not remember thy sins
.
" isaiah 43
: 25

] the spiritual one who keesh bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants tothe keep us in a state of condemnation
. don ' t let him
. next tiem your spiritual adversray reminds you of your past
, take great pleasure in reminding him ofthe his future
. he hates that
