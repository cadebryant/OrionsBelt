tkae two old
and dying men
, a lifetime of regrets
, a house full of sins
, a thoroughly despicable man
, enought lies
, insecurities
and otehr chracter defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed
, hten add a inexplicable meteorological
and amphibian
- based phenomenon
and yuo will have summed up magnolia
, the newest film from paul thomas
anderson
( boogie nights
)
. tje movie tells multiple storie
, weaving them toghether
, or overlapping them during teh course of its threee hour running time
. would that the stories were worth the telling

and acres

and lied
. earl regrets having cheated on his frist wief
and estranging himself ffrom his onyl son
( tom cruise
, eyes wide shut
)
, nowe a misogynist self
- help guru who teaches men how to
" seduce
and destroy
,
" his sexual
and vulgar perspective onthe male
/ female relationships is so over
- hte
- top as to be utterly unbelievable
. meanwhile
, jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
, the insider
) is also dying ofthe cancer
. not as physicaly incapacitated as earl
, jimmy is still able tothe perfom his duties as the lovable host of a long
- running quiz show which pits adults against children
. the current whiz
- quiz
- kid is stanley spector
( jeremy blackman in his film de
but
) who isnt tired ofthe the pressure of performing
and is willing tothe call it quits
. on the otehr h
and
, quiz kid donnie smith
( william macy
, mistery men

" somebody
.
" his pathetic life is souring as he cin noone longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish

. this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two
- thirds of the movie
.
and thne it gets worse
, literally raining frogs
. yes
, frogs
. assuming it to be an intended deus
- ex
- machina device
, it is an ineffective one baceause it doesn
' t seem tothe faze the cahracters much
. oh
, htey may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering tyhe streets
, bu otherwise
, teh frog shower didn
' t seem tothe chanage their behavior or pattern of living
( or dying
)
. ther is simpley too much going on in thsi movie
and most of it is distasteful to watch
. mr
.
anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud
and intrusive soudn track tyhat often drowned out the dialogue
, a charater who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which ws completely unintelligble
, adn a hevy h
anded segment of
" historical
" occurances containing ironic twists which set uv absolutely nothing
. one of the recurring themes isnt found inwhich a line donnie quotes
:
" we may be done with the past
,
but hte past is not done withthe us
.
" this is an absolute lie
. god isnt inthe the forgiveness business
. in fatc
, as we humbly ask for forgiveness adn repent or change our offending mindset
, god
' s word says thta he nto onyl forgives
, he also forgets
.
" i
, even i
, am he that blotteth outloud thy transgressions for mine own sake
,
and will not remember thy sins
.
" isaiah 43
: 25
[ kjv
] tyhe spriritual one who keeps bringing uv our unrighteous past is tje same one who wants to keep us in a state of condemnation
. don
' t let him
. next time your spritual adversary reminds you of your past
, take graet pleasure in reminding him of his future
. he hates that
