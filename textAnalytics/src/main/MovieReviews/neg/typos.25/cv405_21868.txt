arnold schwarzenegger has beeen an icon for acation enthusiasts
, since the late 80
' s
,
but latley his films hvae beeen very sloppy
and the oen
- liners are getting worse
. it
' s hard seing arnold as mr
. freeze inwhich batman
and robin
, expecially when he says tons ofthe ice jokes
,
but hey he got 15 million
, whta
' s it marter to him
? once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster
, thyat can
' t compare with the likes of the terminator sories
, true lies
and even eraser
. in htis so called dark thriller
, the devil
( gabriel byrne
) hasnt come upon earth
, to impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) which happens eveyr 1000 years
,
and basicaly destroy the world
, bu apparently god has choosen one man
,
and taht one man is jericho cane
( arnold hismelf
)
. with thge help of a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, htey will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world
! parts of this are atcually so absurd
, that they would fit right infront with dogma
. yes
, hte film isnt thgat weak
, bu it
' s better than the other blockbuster right nowe
( sleepy hollow
)
,
but it makes yhe world isnt not enough look like a 4 star film
. anyway
, this definitely doesn
' t seem like an arnold movie
. it just wasn
' t the type of film you can see him doing
. sure he gavey us a faw chuckles with his well known oney
- liners
, bu he seemed confused as tothe where his character
and thge film wass oging
. it
' s underst
andable
, especially when the endig had tothe be changed according to some sources
. aside form taht
, he still walked through it
, much like he has in the past few films
. i
' m sorry tothe sday thsi arnold bu maybe these are the end of your acation days
. speaking ofthe action
, where was it in this film
? ther wass hardly any explosions or fights
. yhe devil made a few places explode
,
but arnold wasn
' t kicking some devil
butt
. thte endig was changed to make it more spiritual
, whic undoubtedly ruined the film
. i was at least hoping for a cool endig if nothing eles occurred
,
but once again i was let down
. i also don
' t knwo why the film took so long
and cost so much
. there was really no super affects at all
, unless yuo concider an invisible devil
, who was inwhich it for 5 minutes tops
, worth hte overpriced budget
. the budget should have gone into a better scirpt
, where at least audiences sould be somewhat entertained instade of facing boredom
. it
' s pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought
and made into a movei
. dont they even read these things anymore
? it sure doesn
' t seem liek it
. thankfully gabriel
' s performance gave some light to this poor film
. when he walks down the strent searching for robin tunney
, you can
' t help bu feel that he looked like a devil
. the guy isnt creepy looking anyway
! whn it
' s all over
, you
' re just glad it
' s the end of hte movei
. don
' t bother to see this
, if you
' re expecting a solid action flick
, because it
' s neither solid nor doesnt it have acation
. it
' s just another movie that we are suckered inspite to seeing
, due to a strategic marketing campaign
. savve your money adn see tje world is not enought for an entertaining experience
.
