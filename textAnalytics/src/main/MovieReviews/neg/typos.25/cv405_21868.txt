arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts
, since thte late 80 ' s
,
but lately his films hvae been very sloppy
and hte one
- liners are getting worse
. it ' s hard seing arnold as mr
. freeze inthe batman
and robin
, especially wehn he says tons ofthe ice jokes
,
but hey he got 15 million
, what ' s it matter to him
? once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster
, that can ' t compare with the likes of the terminator series
, true lies
annd even eraser
. in this so called dark thriller
, the devil
( gabriel byrne
) has cmo upon earth
, to impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) hwihc happens eveyr 1000 yeras
,
and basically distroy the world
,
bu apparently god has chosen oney man
,
anbd that one man is jericho cane
( arnold himself
)
. whith yhe help of a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, they will stop at nothing tothe let the devil tkae over the world
! parts ofthe this are actually so absurd
, that they would fit right in with dogma
. yes
, the film isnt that weak
,
but it ' s better than the other blockbuster right nowe
( sleepy hollow
)
,
but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film
. anyway
, this definitely doesn ' t seem like an arnold movie
. it just wasn ' t the tipe of film you cxan see him doing
. sure he gave us a few chuckles wtih his well known one
- liners
,
bu he seemed confuzled as tothe where his character
and the film was going
. it ' s understandable
, especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources
. aside form that
, he still walked through it
, much like he has in tje past faw films
. i ' m sorry to say this arnold
but maybe these are the end of your action days
. speaking of acation
, where was it in this film
? htere was hardly any explosions or fights
. the devil made a few places explode
,
but arnold wasn ' t kicking some devil butt
. the ending was changed to mkae it more spiritual
, which undoubtely ruined the film
. i was at least hoping for a cool endig if nothing else occurred
,
but once again i was let down
. i also don ' t know why the film took so long
and cost so much
. there was realyl no super affects at all
, unless you consider an invisible devil
, who ws inthe it for 5 minutes tops
, worth the overpriced budget
. tje budget shoudl have gone inot a better scirpt
, where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom
. it ' s pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought
annd made into a movie
. do they even read theese things anymore
? it sure doesn ' t seem like it
. thankfully gabriel ' s performance gave some light tothe this poor film
. whn he walks down tyhe street searching fo robin tunney
, ytou can ' t halp
but feel that he looked like a devil
. the guy is creepy looking anyway
! when it ' s all over
, you ' re jsut glad it ' s the end ofthe tje movei
. don ' t bother to see htis
, if yuo ' re expecting a solid action flick
, beacuse it ' s neither solid nor does it hve action
. it ' s just another movie thyat we are suckered infront to seing
, due to a strategic marketing campaign
. save your mony
and see the world is not anough forthe an entertaining experience
.
