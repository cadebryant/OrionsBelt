well i guess it
' s that time of the yearm again
. the one tyme ofthe the year where movie craftors are exonerated from tje need to even
* try
* wirting a scirpt that has more dialogue than explosions
. it
' s allso thge best time for thte h
andful of exisiting bigtime hollywood mr action heroes tothe dust off their miniscule vocabularies
, pull on their black vests
and charge onto our screens tersely expirating whta they hope will become memorable catchphrases
. in america they call tihs tiem
" summer
"
and it happens once every year
.
and maybe it
' s tyhe exposure to all thyat nasty sun taht does it
,
but infront the proces normaly weak
, insipid lines like
" consider this a divorce
,
"
" hasta la vista
, baby
,
"
and
" you
' re hte disease
. i
' m the cure
" actually do end up bieng repeated more oftenly
then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs
. this is not entirely a bad thnig
, ofthe course
. waht am i talking about
? i
' m talking baout the summer
" blockbusters
,
" the
" acation thrillers
,
" the
" this
- obviously
- cost
- a
- lot
- so
- ytou
- know
- everyone
' s
- going
- to
- go
" explosions
, gas threats
, flying saucers
,
and special effects
. in the rash of
" my
, what big guns you have
,
but wait
! mine are bigger
" movies
, ther are also the usual boy
- meets
- fish
-
and
- saves
- environment movies
( or whale
, whatever
)
,
and
* this
* year
, yhe odd crop of
" save
- the
- world
- from
- aliens
- or
- environment
- threats
" offerings
. i
' m tlaking baout the three batmans
, the speeds
, the terminators
, etc
. this yera i
' m talking about twister
, independence day
, the arrival
, the rock
, mission
: impossible
, adn of course
, eraser
. here in singapore
, as our local movie critics liek tothe whine
, we seem tothe get hte pick of the crop of
" my explosion is more real
- looking tahn yours
" movies
,
but nothing else
. mission
: impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did infront the us
. the same goes fo eraser
, which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magasine recently called
" mission
: unavoidable
"
( onthe account of its worldwide mega
- advertising blitz
)
, eraser seems like a cheaper
, less
thoughtful imitation
. that
' s saying a lot
, because mi tje movie was already a cheap
,
thoughtless immitation of its tv originator of the
' 60s
/
' 70s
. in eraser
, arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger
. he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existnce anbd re
- situating them with new identities
. his new case is lee cullen
, played by vanessa williams who
, unlike all the other scumbags he
' s ever relocated
, is
" an actual
, real life honest person
.
" because she
' s so good
,
and has such nice legs
, arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her
,
and only uses the opening movie sequence tothe save robert pastorelli from
* his
* killers
. lee obtains evidence that the high
- technolgy weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated
, black
- market arms to people wtih foreign accents anbd stringy hair
. of course
, as the forumla goes
, her revealing this information wiull destroy tjhe system as we nkow it beacuse heck
, there are people infront high places who will go down whith this
, because yes
, this is yhe biggest conspiracy inthe the history of the world
( that is
, america
) since watergate
. inspite protecting lee
, arnold is framed by thte mentor
- turned
- evil robert deguerin
, nicely played by james caan
,
and ends up having to prove that he isn
' t the one killing the programme
' s witnesses infront addition tothe mkaing sure lee isn
' t accidentally torpedo
- ed tothe death by the new
, green guns his enemies all have
. it
' s around this time that people in the theatre witht me starting humming the mission
: impossible theme
, because arnie
' s mission includes breaking into a high
- security building to run a disk
. i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone infront this movei is so antsy about
. it
' s an electro
- magnetic pulse gun thing whcih fires aluminium missiles
,
and which can see through walls
. it has soem sort of x
- ray vision
, so its user cant target tyhe victim
' s heart even from great distances
. dispite tihs
, which i figure is a preety cool feature iin a gun
(
though i
' m certainly no expert
)
, howver
, arnold
, whose pwn heart isnt targeted a number of times
,
* never
* goes flying 10 foots backwards with a two
- foot misile through his chest like all thte others who get shot by this gun
. instead he outruns
and outsmarts his trackers eahc time
, giving eery
and ironic resonance tothe that terminator line that practically made him faymus
:
" i
' ll be back
.
" liuke everyone else in the theater
, i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me
, because they made me whant to watch htis movie voluntarily
.
al
thought there is a
* lot
* of violence in this movie
, nto tothe mention mutilation
and some bloody tussles wih alligators
, i recommend this movie tothe most over
- 18s who need some theraputic mindless action to get over hte weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas
