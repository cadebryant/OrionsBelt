well i guess it ' s thyat time of hte year again
. the one time ofthe the year where movie craftors are exonerated fomr the need to even
* try
* writting a script that has more dialogue than explosions
. it ' s also tje best tiome for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies
, pull onthe their balck vests
and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases
. in amercia they call htis time
" summer
"
annd it happens once eveyr year
.
and maybe it ' s tjhe exposure to all thgat nasty sun that does it
,
but in hte proccess normally weak
, insipid lines liuke
" consider this a divorce
,
"
" hasta la vista
, baby
,
"
and
" you ' re the disease
. i ' m the cure
" actually do end uv being repeated more often
thn the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs
. this isnt not entirely a bad thing
, of course
. wqat am i talking about
? i ' m tlaking about tjhe summer
" blockbusters
,
" the
" action thrillers
,
" tjhe
" this
- obviously
- cost
- a
- lot
- so
- you
- know
- everyone ' s
- gogin
- to
- go
" explosions
, gas threats
, flying saucers
,
and special effects
. in tjhe rash of
" my
, what big guns yuo have
,
bu wait
! mine are bigger
" movies
, there are also the usual boy
- meets
- fish
-
adn
- saves
- environment movies
( or whale
, whatever
)
,
and
* this
* year
, the odd crop of
" save
- tyhe
- world
- ffrom
- aliens
- or
- environment
- threats
" offerings
. i ' m talking baout the three batmans
, the speeds
, tje terminators
, etc
. this year i ' m talking about twister
, independendet day
, the arival
, the rock
, mission
: impossible
,
annd ofthe course
, eraser
. here inthe singapore
, as our local movie critics like to whine
, we seem to get the pick ofthe the crop of
" my explosion is more rela
- looking than yours
" movies
,
bu nothing else
. mission
: impossible opened in our theatres almsot as soon as it did in the us
. the same goes for eraser
, which isnt unfortunate forthe arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after waht time magasine recently called
" mission
: unavoidable
"
( on account of its worldwide mega
- advertising blitz
)
, eraser seems like a cheaper
, less thoughtful imitation
. thgat ' s saying a lot
, because mi the movie was already a cheap
, thoughtless imitation of its tv originator ofthe the ' 60s
/ ' 70s
. inthe eraser
, arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place theri lives inthe danger
. he does this by destroying all evidence of their prseent existence
and re
- situating them with new identities
. his new case isnt lee cullen
, palyed by vanessa williams who
, unlike all yhe other scumbags he ' s ever relocated
, is
" an actuall
, real life honest person
.
" because she ' s so ogod
,
and has such nice legs
, arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her
,
and only uses the opening movei sequence tothe save robert pastorelli from
* his
* killers
. lee obtains evidence that thge high
- tecnology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophicated
, black
- market arms to peple with foreign accents
and stringy hair
. of course
, as the formula goes
, her revealing this information wiull distroy the system as we know it because heck
, there are people in high places who will go down with tihs
, becuase yes
, this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world
( that isnt
, america
) since watergate
. in protecting lee
, arnold is framed by the mentor
- turned
- evil robert deguerin
, nicely played by james caan
,
and ends up having to proove that he isn ' t the one killing the programme ' s witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn ' t accidentally torpedo
- ed to death by the new
, green guns his enemies all hvea
. it ' s arround tihs time that people in thte theatre whith me starting humming the mission
: impossible theme
, because arnie ' s mission includes breaking inot a high
- security building to run a disk
. i guess i should tell ytou more about the paticular gun everyone inthe this movie is so antsy baout
. it ' s an electro
- magentic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles
,
annd which can see through walls
. it hasnt some sort of x
- ray vision
, so its user can target the victim ' s heart even ffrom great distances
. dispite tihs
, which i figure isnt a preety cool feature in a gun
(
though i ' m certainly no expert
)
,
however
, arnold
, whose own heart is targeted a number of times
,
* never
* goes flying 10 feet backwards wtih a two
- foot missle thru his chest like all the others who get shooted by this gun
. instead he outruns
and outsmarts his trackers each tiome
, giving eery
and ironic resonance to tath terminator line that practicaly made him famous
:
" i ' ll be back
.
" liuke everyone else inspite thge theather
, i left the movei feeling tyhat the trailers had duped me
, because they made me want tothe watch this movie voluntarily
.
although ther isnt a
* lot
* of violence in tihs movei
, not to mention mutilation
adn some bloody tussles with alligators
, i reccomend this movei to most over
- 18s who ened some theraputic mindless action to git over yhe weirdness ofthe fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas
. review ' s rating system
:
* wait for the video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home withthe gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
