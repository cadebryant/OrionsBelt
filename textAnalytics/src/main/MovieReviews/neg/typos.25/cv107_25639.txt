" it
' s jsut
.
.
. the way
.
.
. we are
.
"
-
-
- a rapist
( matt frewer
) responds tothe supergirl
' s
( helen slater
) query as to why she
' s being attacked
, an exmaple of tyhe mind
- numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl
. i
' ll admit it
.
.
. i lveo superman iii
. i nkow it
' s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor
,
but i still thikn it
' s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise
. supergirl
, a spin
- off film ofthe sorts ffrom the series
' smae producers
( alex
ander
and ilya salkind
)
, doesn
' t even rival superman iii in terms of quality
, let alone superman or superman ii
. supergirl lost me ffrom teh opening scenes
and went steadily downhill for the rest of its twpo hour plus running time
. as the film beggins we see the residents ofthe argo city
, a commune like place consisting ofthe refugees fomr krypton which resides in
" inner spoace
"
, go about their daily lives
. ok
.
.
. what
? so these are exiles from krypton
, which blew up right
? were they living there before krypton exploded
? how do you get to
" inner space
"
? thsi whole
" intertube spoace
" notion is never explained
, prticularly infact terms of how these people get information from the outside world
. how dont they know where superman went
? how do they know he tookover the nmae clark kent
and now works at the daily planet
? these kinds ofthe things frustrate the hell out of me
. argo city is kept running by a pwoer source called tje omegahedron
. one day the founder of argo city
, zaltar
( peter o
' toole
)
, gives the omegahedron to superman
' s cousin
, kara
( helen slater
)
, for use as inspiration in her art
. kara uses it tothe create a bug
- like thing which immediately crashes thru the layer of
" whatever
" that protects the city
. in the chaos
, hte omegahedron sails out through the opening
, dooming hte argonians to death
.
.
. in three dyas time
, or something
. kara
then climbs into a pod which zaltar hadnt designed for interdimensional travel
and chases after the omegahedron to save her world
. the power source travels direcly to earth
and l
ands in hte bowl of dip belonging to a minor
- leage witch named selena
( faye dunaway
) who
, immediately befor her dip was ruined
, announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel
( peter cook
)
. selena somehow knows that this ball fomr the sky will halp her with her evil plans
,
and she sets out to achieve world domination
. selena is unaware of course that kara has allso arrived on earth
,
and tht she
' s arrived as supergirl
( complete wih appropriate costume
)
. supergirl emerges ffrom tyhe bottom of a lake when she arrives
. ok
.
.
. huh
? why does the omegahedron fall from the sky
but supergirl shoots outloud of the bottom ofthe a lake
? attension movie
: explain youself
! i
' m sorry
, i can only suspend disbelief so much
. i can
' t buy into any of tihs nonsense just because the movie wants me tothe
. knowing that she needs a secet identity
, supergirl basically
" wills
" herself into a school girl outfit
( complete with a different hairstyle
)
, picks the alias linda lee
and enrolls inot skool
. she
' s given her dorm assignment
,
and who happens to be her roommate
? lois lane
' s sister
, lucy
. ok
, coincidence is one thnig folks
,
but we
' re getting really contrived now
. what follows are some generic all
- girls school hijinks
.
.
. complete with evil bully girls
( mean for no reason
, of course
)
and even a shower scene
(
!
)
. best moent
though comes when supergirl decides tothe put a bra onthe over her school uniform
and starts stuffing it with socks
. at this point i
' m rapidly wondering why i
' m bothering with this nonsense
. there is some credit to give to hte film
however
. one lengthy
and elaborite sequence featuring an
" evil
" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its
" prey
" isnt very well done
. also
, its commendable to see genders reversed in the film
, whereas the womens have all the power
and the men are merely objects
and tools
. hart bochner
( die hard
) is particularly fun as kara
' s lveo interest
, a lovesick l
andscaper who is under a spell cast by selena
(
al
though he is unfourtunately part of noe ofthe tghe film
' s more ridiculous moments
, whn he has to be rescued from being tapped by soem
" menacing
" bumper cars
)
.
then there weere numerous little things that bothered me
. thte flying effects are never convincing for a moment
.
.
. it
' s all too obvious taht helen slater is hooked tothe wires
. instade ofthe haveing her look like she
' s flying
, the filmmakers wanted her to be
" graceful
"
, so she poses a lot
and doens ballet
- type maneuvers
. also
, who are teh frist twpo humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth
? a pair of truck drivers
/ rapists who immediately attack her anbd
then meet a
" wacky
" demise
. there is alsot some rampant product placement inaddition the film
, most notably for popeye
' s
, tylenol
,
and a
& w root beer
, with the latter actually putting its logo on the t
- shirt of one of the rapists
(
?
!
)
. finally
, just one word
: monsters
. faye dunaway
and peter o
' toole ham it up unmercifully
,
however when o
' toole overacts he
' s entertaining adn when dunaway does it she
' s annoying
( her character actually says the line
" seize them
!
" at oney point
)
. dunaway
' s henchmen
( played by peter cook
and brenda vaccaro
) fare much better
, iwth vaccaro coming off best as the equialent of ned beatty
' s otis character from the firt two superman movies
. helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent
, naive character she
' s written to be
, as she
' s able tothe gaze at flowers anbd bunnies with the right ammount of genuine wonder to amke it believable
. believability asside
though
, it
' s still annoying
. now dispite all this negativity
(
and i
' m nto alone here
.
.
. supergirl is nto a well liked nor a well respected movie infront many circles
)
, leave it to thge ogod people at anchor bay enteratinment to actually make people not only interested
,
but excited baout its release on dvd
! they have released two seprate editions of the film on dvd
, to the delight of many people
( including myself
.
.
.
yet i
' m still unclear as to why
, since this movei is so awful
)
. the first
and most widely availabe dvd realease features the international version of tje film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran infront u
. s
. theaters
. yhe movei is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2
. 35
: 1
, is enhanced forthe 16x9 televisions
,
and has been remastered infront full thx glory
. extras on thte disc include
: a full lenght audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc
and
" special project consultant
" scott michael bosco
, the excelent 50
- minute documentary ffrom 1984 called supergirl
- thge mkaing of a feature
( dig that workout montage
!
)
, 5 trailers
, 3 tv spots
, talent bios
, iin
- depth storyboards
( accompanied by score fomr the movie
)
,
and assorted still galleries
. the transfer on this international version is incredable
.
.
. you
' d htink yuo weere watching a new release
. images are sharp
, colors jump off thge screen
,
and yhe picture is free of scratches or artifacts
. only smoe speical effects sequences sohw the wear of time
, annd there just isn
' t much that cxan be done about thyat
( unless you
' re obsessive liuke george lucas
)
. the new thx approved audio is loud adn clear in all the right places
, howver ytou
' ll be hearing absurd dialogue adn a mediocre jerry goldsmith csore
( which is completelyl unrelated to john williams
' classic superman theme
and soudns better suited for a cannon films
' golan
- globus prodcution
)
. thge commentary track featuring directer szwarc
and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries
. bosco seems tothe be an expert in all things supergirl adn isnt there with szwarc to ensure that there
' s no dead air on the track
. bosco probes szwarc forthe information on virtually everyone adn everthing that comes onscreen
,
and we learn a great deal more baout the film as a result of his participation
. altho
, at times you cant tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc
,
and is surprised when he doesn
' t get tath response
. we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track
, most notably the
" almost
" appearance infact tghe film by christopher reeve
. great detail isnt given baout superman
' s proposed role in the original script before reeve
( wisely
) dropped out
. as it st
ands
, superman is writen off early on in the film when we hear a radiu broadcast mention thta he is billions of light years away on soem sort of peace mission
. for the sake of brevity
, i won
' t even get inot that one
. szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds
(
and everyone else agreed
) that supergirl needed to st
and on its own
, replacing the science fiction ofthe the superman films with cutsy
" whimsical fantasy
" nonsence
. bosco also points outloud scenes not inthe the american release as they cmo along
, claiming tht hadnt htey beeen in the orignal realease it owudl hvae been a hit at the box office
. agian
, for the sake ofthe brevity
, i won
' t even get into that one
. anchor bay has also released a limited edition
( onyl 50
, 000 copies pressed
) two
- disc set
. disc one containes everything mentioned for the regular release
. disc two features teh never befoer seen director
' s cutted of the film
, which runs 138 minutes long
. the additions mainly consist of scene extensions whitch don
' t add much ofthe note
, except forthe a few moments which leng
then peter o
' toole
' s screen time
( paricularly during his latter appearances
)
. the print is rough in spots
and the soudn is only in mono
,
but fans ofthe tyhe film won
' t care
. one question
though
.
.
. shouldn
' t the directer
' s commentary be on the director
' s cutted of the film
? i
' d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd
. i was nine whn it was released tothe theaters
,
and even
then i was smart enought tothe inform my parents nto to take me to see it
. so when i popped tjhe dvd into my player
and sat down in my easy chair i had noone idea what to expect
. i knew hte film wasn
' t beloved anbd i never had any interest in it before
,
but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc
. as yhe disc began to spin i was rather empressed with the opening sequence
, which made me sit uv
and wonder if my assumptions all htis time could have beeen wrong
. come to find out
however it wass just tjhe chase digital stereo logo
.
.
. so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started
. at the end of tje film
, supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron
,
and flies bcak to argo city
. ugh
, i give up
. i
' m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once
, not twice
,
but three times tothe review these discs
. supergirl isnt definitely a terrific dvd package
,
but a very lousy movie
.
