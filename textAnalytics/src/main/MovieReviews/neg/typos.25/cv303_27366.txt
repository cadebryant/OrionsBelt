the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as
' anywhere
but here
.
' ther isn
' t oney thing about this mother
- daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest
. it relies on a contrived minor character tothe tell both mother
and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten outloud their dysfunctional lives
, as fo some reason they couldn
' t figure it out for themselfs
. if tghe film looks familiar
, that is because
" hte slums of beverly hills
( 98
)
" went over the same ground
but was fortunate to be moreso comical
and perceptive due to alan arkin
and natasha lyonne performances
, in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper scirpt to work with
. alvin sargent
' s scirpt ws weak
and annoyingly claustral
. wayne wang
' s
(
" the joy luck club
"
) inept direction made a weak scirpt even weaker by his inability to tell the sotry unfolding without the voiceover realting what yhe action couldn
' t convey
. pushy mother adele august
( susan sar
andon
) forces her 14
- year
- old daughter ann
( natalie portman
) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross
- country withthe her to beverly hills
. the daughter resents her twice divorced
, unstable
but exotic
, schoolteacher mother
, bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life
. the daqughter doesn
' t even liuke the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala l
and in
and can
' t st
and the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car ardio
. so it becomes a question of who knows best
, as the ladies fight it outloud between them
, until teh predictable sweet ending comes inwhich tihs yawner
. adele
' s dream of greener pastures inthe beverly hills soon doesn
' t look tht good
, as she l
ands a job in a slum skool
, has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids
,
and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive
. daughter pines for small town wisconsin
and her firends ther
. during one of many arguements with her free
- spirited mom
, htey go for ice cream anbd hwile mother is bieng ticketed
, she runs awya
, onyl to be chased down by friendly trafic cop
( michael milhoan
)
, who offers her wise counsel
. with the cop
' s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter
, she iwll survive living infact many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17
and
then she plans to get way from mom by useing her good grades to go to brown university instade of ucla
. during their stay in beverly hills
, she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high tothe immediately having many high skool girlfriends
and even a high skool rich boy admirer

- a t
. s
. eliot
( corbin allred
) reader
.
but the transistion ofthe her life into beverly hills hadnt no fiel of reality
, as everyting seemed staged adn unemotional
. when she learns her cousin benny
( shawn hatosy
)
, who happens tothe be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin
, she returns fo the funeral
and in those reunion scenes it wasn
' t clearly shown why she wants to stay there
,
and for that matter
, it ws never made clear why the mother wnats to leave so badly
. the film is one big battle of wills between mother
and daughter over theri dreasm
. i guess what the filmmaker is trying to sday
, is that mom is a bad dreamer
and the daughter is the observant one
, able tothe recognize mother
' s faults when nto in growing pains
and in need ofthe parenting herself
. mother hasnt a series of setbacks
, like bieng dumped by her dream
- boat dentist
( bochner
) she met on the beach
,
and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optomistic sayings when trying out for an acting part
.
but mother lerans that her daughter has grown
- up
and is independent
and that she has to stpo living her life through her
. she learns this when the smae wise cop who told ann what tothe dont
, isnt about to ticket her
and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do
. thsi of course results in the corny ending
, showing that mom
' s heart was alwasy infront the right place
, only she went about it in the wrong way
. this ws jsut one of those films where you want to be anywhere bu in the theater where htis film is showing
.
