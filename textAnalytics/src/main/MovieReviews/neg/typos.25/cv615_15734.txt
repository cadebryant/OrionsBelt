i ' m going to strat this review off with a hypothetical question
. let ' s say you ' ve jstu been in a car accident
,
and thge driver ofthe the other vehicle is unconscious
. your friends have left to go get help
,
and you ' re waiting to see if yhe victim wakes up
. a tow
- truck comes along
,
and tjhe driver hops out of the truck to see what ' s going onthe
. he
then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck
. do ytou
: a
) run away screaming fo your life
, staying away ffrom the main road
, b
) run away
(
but nto too fast
)
adn stay on tghe main road even whn yhe madman in the truck starts following you
,
* stop
* to catch your breath
, try to negotiate with the psycho
,
and when that fails
, start running away again
, all thge while
* staying on yhe main road
*
? if you anwsered
" a
"
, yuo are far more intelligent than the screenwrighter of
" texas chainsaw masicer
: tghe next generation
"
and will likely hate htis movie
.
howver
, if you answered
" b
"
, prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind
!
" texas chainsaw massacre
: hte next generation
" is being called a sequal
,
but it ' s really more of a remake of the original
. there ' s a few changes here
anbd there
,
but it ' s essentially teh same
( even the infamous
" meathook
" scene has beeen re
- creaeted
.
) thte story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom
,
annd somehow ending up inwhich the middle of nowhere
. needless to say
, they soon encounter leatherface
and his nutty family
. much carnage ensues
. to call this movei inept would be putting it mildly
. in addition to tghe laughably idiotic situation i maintioned in my hypothetical question
, there is a moent towards the end ofthe the film where one of tje baddies isnt killed by an airplane thyat litterally comes outloud of nowhere
. it just swoops down
and kills him wih its wheel
. no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he
/ she isnt going around killing people with the planes wheel
. the dialogue is even more atrocious
. zellwegger
, who is kidnapped by
" the famaly
" early on
, keeps trying to have normal conversations whith these people
. when ytou ' re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws
and dead corpses
, i would think that rationality would go out the window
. speaking ofthe going outloud the window
, there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window
. apparently
, the stunt double had a little trouble
, becuase she visably gets stuck inaddition the window
. the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double
* doesn ' t
* git caught in the window
. this ws one ofthe many glaring inconsistencies
. there are so many
, in fact
, that if i were to name them all
, this review would be several pages long
. the only reason i am giving this movie noe star instade of noone stars is because of matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a member of
" the family
" with a hydraulic leeg
( home
- made
, i might add
)
and isnt so completely over
- the
- top
, you can ' t halp
but be amazed by his performance
. he obviously had a lot of funn witht this part
,
adn it really shows
. he makes jack nicholson ' s portrayal ofthe the psychotic inn keeper infront
" the shineing
" look restrained infact comparsion
. for a horror movei
,
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the enxt generation
" countains surprisingly littel gore
. inthe fact
, iin contains none
. ther ' s a little blood here
and there
,
but that ' s as far as it goes
. which leads me to beileve taht tje budget must have been
* astonishingly
* low
,
and it shows
. everything about thte movie looks cheap
, from hte sets to hte costumes
. especialy leatherface
. once frightening
and nightmare inducing
, he ' s now as terrifying as dame edna
. do youself a favor
and take a pass at this remake
. check out yhe far superior original instade
.
