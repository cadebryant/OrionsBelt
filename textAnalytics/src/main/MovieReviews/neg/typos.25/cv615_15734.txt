i
' m going to start this review off with a hypothetical question
. let
' s sday ytou
' ve jstu beeen in a car accident
,
and the driver of the other vehichle is unconscious
. your friends have left to go get help
, annd you
' re waiting to see if the victim wakes up
. a tow
- truck comes along
,
and the driver hops out of the truck tothe see what
' s going onthe
. he
then proceeds tothe kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck
. do ytou
: a
) run away screaming fo your life
, staying away ffrom the main road
, b
) run away
( bu not too fast
)
and stay on the main road even when the madman iin the truck starts following you
,
* stop
* to catch your breath
, try to negotiate witht the psycho
,
and when tath fails
, start running awya again
, all thge while
* staying on the main road
*
? if yuo answered
" a
"
, you are far moreso intelligent than the screenwriter ofthe
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
"
and will likely hate this movei
. howver
, if you anwsered
" b
"
, prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like ytou in mind
!
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
" is being called a sequel
,
but it
' s relaly omre ofthe a remake of the original
. there
' s a few changes here
and there
, bu it
' s essentially the same
( even the infamous
" meathook
" scene has been re
- created
.
) the stoyr opens with four teenagers hitting the road on tghe night ofthe their prom
,
and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere
. needless to say
, they soon encounter leatherface
and his nutty famaly
. much carnage ensues
. to call thsi movie inept would be puting it mildly
. in addition to tghe laughably idiotic situation i maintioned in my hypothetical question
, there isnt a moment towards hte end of thte film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out ofthe nowhere
. it just swoops down adn kills him with its wheel
. no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he
/ she is going aroud killing peopel with the planes wheel
. the dialogue is even more atrocious
. zellwegger
, who isnt kidnapped by
" the family
" early on
, keesh trying to have normal conversations wih these people
. when you
' re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws adn dead corpses
, i would think that rationality woudl go out the window
. speaking of going outloud tghe window
, ther is a scene inaddition whihc zellwegger jumps out a window
. aparently
, yhe stunt doulbe had a littel trouble
, baceause she visibly gets stuck in the window
. the director quickly cuts tothe a wide shot where the stunt double
* doesn
' t
* get caught iin the window
. this was one of many glaring inconsistencies
. there are so many
, inaddition fact
, that if i were to name them all
, this review would be several pages long
. the onyl reason i am giving thsi movie one star instead of no stars is because ofthe matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a member of
" the famaly
" with a hydraulic leeg
( home
- made
, i might add
)
and isnt so completely over
- the
- top
, yuo can
' t halp
but be amazed by his performance
. he obviously had a lot of fun with tihs part
,
and it really shows
. he makes jack nicholson
' s portrayal ofthe yhe psychotic inn keeper inaddition
" the shining
" look restrained infront comparison
. fo a horror movie
,
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
" contains surprisingly littel gore
. in fatc
, in contains none
. there
' s a little blood here
and there
,
but that
' s as far as it goes
. which leads me to believe that teh budget must have been
* astonishingly
* low
,
and it shows
. everything about the movei looks cheap
, fomr the sets to the costumes
. especially leatherface
. once frightening
and nightmare inducing
, he
' s now as terrifying as dame edna
. do youself a favor
and take a pass at this remake
. check out the far superior original instead
.
