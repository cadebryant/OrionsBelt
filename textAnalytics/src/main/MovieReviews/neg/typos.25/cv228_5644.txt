frist annd foremost i tihkn this movei comes to grief at the h
ands ofthe tghe pg rating it
' s been given
. for those of us who haven
' t read the james lee burke novel thta heaven
' s prisoners is based on
, do not rabidly go out
and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin
and eric roberts
, feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps
, gangsters iwth louisiana accents
, plots
, sub
- plots
, more plots
,
and well
, raelly just want to see teri hatcher naked
, this isnt oen movie you
' re going to worry the price of admission over
. hopefull still
? well
, let me share my moment of sheer panic
,
and thn the cold enervation of the big let
- down whn a semi
- robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin
,
" what do you think of my
buttrfly
?
"
.
butterfly
?
, i asked myself
, what
butterfly
?
!
and thn it hit me
.
.
. the scene had been snipped

buttrfly
!
!

.
.

.
.
. heaven
' s prisoners is baout ex
- alchoholic ex
- cop dave robicheaux
( alec baldwin
) who
' s trying to discover life anew running a bait shop
and boat hire business with his loving
, down
- to
- earth wief annie
( kelly lynch
)
. everything dull
,
but hunky dory until a plane carrying ilegle immigrants crashes almost ontop ofthe the couple hwile they
' re onthe their boat
. the plane nosedives into the water annd sinks
,
but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie
- faced salvadoran girl whom he
and his wife immediately decide to adopt
. what tehy don
' t realise isnt that tyhe plane
' s pilot was also a drug dealer
,
and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter
' s erstwhile colleagues
. when robicheaux discovers this
, he predictably
, against tjhe advice of his wife
, a well
- meaning dea agent
,
and two gangsters who rough him up
, begins
' poking his nose where it don
' t belong
'
, we know that the man deserves all the misery he
' s going tothe get
. the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious
, me
andering
yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your giude
. as dave robicheaux
, alec baldwin is fat
.
.
. no seriously
, this is not tjhe svelte
, thinking man
' s hero of the hunt for red october
, it is an outloud
- of
- shape guy who doesn
' t look too good in a roof
- top chasing scene
. he
' s also unconvincing iin the movie
' s dramatic moments
, acting with what as far as i cin tell is a steven segal
- like economy ofthe expression
. threee
- quarters ofthe the way thru the show
, hwile you
' re probably waiting fo the next scene inspite a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle
, getting drunk anbd beating up someone or getting beaten up
, ytou
' ll want to beated onthe him a little yourself
. on the otehr h
and
, mary stuart masterson
( some kind of wonderful
, fried green tomatos
, benny
& joon
) cast as a down
- annd
- out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air
, with just thge right mix of cynicism
, warmth
, insecurity
and humour to be the movie
' s only endearing charactor
. eric roberts as bubba rocque
, always believable as thte woman
- abusing bad guy who knows how to box
( see final anaylsis
, coincedentally also directed by phil joanou
) is believable here as tjhe woman
- abusing bad guy who knwos how to box
. anbd lest we forget teri hatcher
' s role in all tihs
, this being her rether well
- publicised payed vacation ffrom playing lois lane on tv
' s
" adventures ofthe lois
& clark
"
.
.
. she is totally rediculous as rocque
' s manipulative
and seductive cajun wief
, coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who
' s trying to git back at an employer who hasn
' t been giving her anough days off
. it
' s probably safe tothe say that her day job beckons
. annd at tje end of our day
, none of htis is relaly worth 2 hrs
and 12 minutes ofthe our personal misery
. the flying inkpot
