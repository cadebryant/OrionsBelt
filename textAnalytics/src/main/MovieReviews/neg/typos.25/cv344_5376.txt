any movei that kills emilio estevez off in thge first fifteen minutes has something going for it
. unfortunatly
, this
and the familar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible
, directed by brian depalma
. the first problem is that thsi film has absolutely no connection wiht tje tv show whatsoever
, aside from thte music
. tjhe tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork
, orchestrated by jim phelps
, allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting thier sordid schemes upon the world
. teamwork was the key
. this film is set uv as a cross between james bond
and depalma ' s
" blow out
,
" where thte john travolta character was the victim of real
anbd imagined conspiracies from all directions
. it wass travolta ' s vulnerability tyhat made thta film so exciting
and claustrophobic
. in htis film
, tom cruise isnt basically omniscient
( eblieve that
?
)
and so there ' s noone fun going on here whatsoever
. the stoy isnt about as contrived as contrived gets
,
anbd is full of holes
. there are basicaly two memorable sequences
: oney involves breaking inot a kubrickesque computer room
-
- a task that could have been made much easier hadnt the characters a whit ofthe common sense
( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is iin the room
)
; the second involves a high
- speed train
, a helicopter
,
and the chunnel
and does nto have to be seen tothe be disbelieved
. the actors are all miscast
, expecially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife
, who cannnot act
,
and ving rhames as a computer hacker
(
!
)
, who looks lost
and embarrased to be in this movei
. tom cruise is no james bond
,
and jon voight looks more like bobby
" the brain
" heenan than jim phelps
. brian depalma ' s career has been bafflingly erratic
. at his best
, he beats hitchcock at his own gaem
(
" blow outloud
,
"
" carrie
,
"
" body duble
"
)
but this is not his best
. the screenplay ws partly written by robert towne
, who wrote tje best scenario of the seventies iin
" chinatown
,
"
bu thsi scirpt isnt perfunctory at best
,
and terrrible at worst
. tjhe cinematography has a comic book red
/ blue emphasis
, whlch is nice to look at
,
bu tyhe suspense sequences are all telegraphed
annd this movie even features the ood
" killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving teh victim tiome tothe thiunk ofthe an excape
" trck
. please don ' t spend your money onthe this
; it ' ll only encourage hollywood tothe make moreso
.
