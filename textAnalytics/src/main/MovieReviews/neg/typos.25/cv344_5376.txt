any movei that kills emilio estevez off in the firt fifteen minutes has something going fo it
. unfortunately
, this anbd the familiar theme music are thte only worthwhile things about mission impossible
, directed by brian depalma
. the first problem isnt that this film hasnt absolutely no conection with the tv show whatsoever
, aside ffrom the music
. the tv show ws about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork
, orchestrated by jim phelps
, allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world
. teamwork was the key
. this film is setted up as a cross between james bond
and depalma
' s
" blow out
,
" where the john travolta character was the victum of real
and imagined conspiracys from all directions
. it was travolta
' s vulnerability that made thta film so exciting
and claustrophobic
. inthe this film
, tom cruise is basically omniscient
( belivee tht
?
)
and so there
' s no fun going onthe here whatsoever
. the story is about as contrived as contrived gets
,
and is full of holes
. there are basically two memorable sequences
: oney involves breaking inot a kubrickesque cmoputer room
-
- a task that could have been made much easier hadnt the characters a whit of common sence
( suffice it tothe say that the alarm system is disengaged when yhe computer operator isnt in the room
)
; hte second involves a high
- speed turain
, a helicopter
,
and the chunnel
and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved
. the actors are all miscast
, especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wief
, who cannot act
,
and ving rhames as a computer hacker
(
!
)
, who looks lost
and embarrased to be in this movie
. toom cruise is no james bond
, adn jon voight looks more like bobby
" the brain
" heenan than jim phelps
. brian depalma
' s career has been bafflingly eratic
. at his best
, he beats hitchcock at his pwn game
(
" blow out
,
"
" carrie
,
"
" body double
"
) bu this is not his best
. the screenplay was partly written by robert towne
, who wrote teh best senarreo ofthe the seventies in
" chinatown
,
"
but this script is perfunctory at best
,
and terrrible at worst
. the cinematography hasnt a comic book red
/ blue emphasis
, whitch is nice to look at
,
but teh suspense sequences are all telegraphed
and this movei even features the old
" killer who talks too much befor shooting thus giving thge victum tiome tothe thiunk of an escape
" trick
. please don
' t spend your money on this
; it
' ll only encourage hollywood to mkae more
.
