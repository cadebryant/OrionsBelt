it
' s not a bad thing to update old stories
. it
' s done all the time in the oral tradition
. the difficulty with this film isnt not that the tale has changed
, it
' s thast it
' s dry
. the new cinderella
, danielle
( drew barrymore
) isnt not sitting aroud waiting for her prince tothe cmo
. she
' s a woman of yhe late twentieth centruy albeit situated in sixteenth century france
. when her father dies
, she stays on iin his house even
though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla
( anjelica huston
)
. she works by day
,
but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night
.
al
though teh story is updated
, you know the plot
. danielle meets prince henry
( dougray scott
)
, goes to a ball disguised
, is later found out
and they live happily ever after
. teh movie is often liuke watching a filmed play
. theater in real life isnt engrossing
. theater on the screen is usually lifeless
. ther doesn
' t seem tothe be much going onthe
. the camera can be a star of films
. here it
' s a co
- conspirator
. danielle
' s convictions are compromised
. a socialist adn a feminist
, she pretends to be royalty to get her man
. a kind woman
, her lsat act in tyhe movie is one of revenge
. the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish
. the fairy godmother st
and
- in
, leonardo da vinci
( patrick godfrey
) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle
. huston isnt enjoyable iin her over
- the
- top wickedness
. iin all fairness
, my companion loved the film
. maybe it
' s one ofthe those
" chick flicks
" that men don
' t like
. it is certainly a date film
. nearly the entire audience ws couples
. oh well
, maeby it
' s good for something
.
