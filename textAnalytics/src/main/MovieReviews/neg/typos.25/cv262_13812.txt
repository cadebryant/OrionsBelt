it ' s not a bad thing tothe update old stories
. it ' s done all the time in the oral tradition
. the difficulty whith tihs film is not that tyhe tale has changed
, it ' s that it ' s dry
. the newyorker cinderella
, danielle
( drew barrymore
) is not sitting around waiting for her prince tothe come
. she ' s a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated iin sixteenth century france
. when her father dies
, she stays on iin his house even
though she isnt mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla
( anjelica huston
)
. she works by day
,
but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night
.
although the story is updated
, you knwo tje plot
. danielle meets prince henry
( dougray scott
)
, goes to a ball disguised
, is later foudn out
and they live happily ever after
. the movie is oftenly like watching a filmed play
. theater infact real life is engrossing
. theater on the screen is usually lifeless
. there doesn ' t seem to be much going on
. tghe camera cant be a star of films
. here it ' s a co
- conspirator
. danielle ' s convictions are compromised
. a socialist
anbd a feminist
, she pretends tothe be royalty to get her man
. a kind woman
, her last act in thge movie is oen ofthe revenge
. the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish
. the fairy godmother stand
- iin
, leonardo da vinci
( patrick godfrey
) is fun tothe watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle
. huston is enjoyable inthe her over
- tghe
- top wickedness
. in all fairness
, my companion loved the film
. maeby it ' s oen ofthe those
" chick flicks
" tht men don ' t like
. it isnt certainly a date film
. nearly the entire audience ws couples
. oh well
, maybe it ' s good for something
