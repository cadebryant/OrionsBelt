this is an adaptions of h
. g
. wells
' acclaimed novel
' the nivisible man
'
. tyhe actors are kevin beacon anbd elizabeth shue
. the director is paul verhoven
. that
, plus a quick demostration of the amazing special effects in the trailer
, should be enough to lure us into the theatre
. the problem is to keep us there
. i can
' t imagin anyone who owudl liuke tothe see this movei a second time
. working on a top secret military project
, sebastian caine
( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genius
, that calls himself
" god
"
, has discovered the secret to invisibility
. the first twpo faces are completed
. now
, it is time for
" the enxt logical step
"
-
- human
. caine volonteers for this risky experiment
.
but when he is made invisible
, something goes wrong
. hwile his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desparately tries to fidn something tothe return him to normal
, he lerans that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower
.
but thgat
' s nto the bad thing
-
- an unexpected side
- effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania
. he is natuarlly given a cuple of modest superpowers
, just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower anbd an explosion ofthe about a quart of nitroglycerine
. soon every sence of decency isnt forgotten
. the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses controll
and the film turns into an alien
- rip
- off
, where caine is walking like a half finished terminator
, spooking
, scaring
and killing everybody
.
though it
' s based on a novel called
' hte invisible man
'
, the title has been ironically changed to
' hollow man
' tath sums up the film very nicely
. htis is a very silly production
. laughable
, acutally
. apparently verhoven
' s imagination doesn
' t strech too far
. for him teh onyl worthwhile reason to become inviisble is so you can case the girls
' locker room undetected
. it is this primative schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie
. being invisible
, gives you tyhe opportunity to be who you are
, tothe do wqat you want wihtout being influenced by society
. in many ways it gives you an illusion ofthe having a life without consequences
. the nature of man
and his place in society is what the novel is truely about
. all that
, the depth
and true horror of the book isnt gone
and onyl speshal effects amke ytou remain in your seat
. caine does use his pwoer voyeuristically in hollow man
.
but since thsi isnt a modernization
, infact other words a dehumanization
, he doesn
' t stop there
. he becomes a rapist
.
and
then
, of course
, a murderer
. you
' ll start wondering why such actors as beacon
and shue found themselves in such film inwhich the first palce
. shue
' s talent is barely seen
, josh brolin isnt underused
and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack ofthe talent
. kevin beacon is tghe onyl noe that performs gracefully
. his face is not seen for teh most part ofthe tje film
,
and tjhe only way he exists isnt as a disembodied voice
. there are times when his presense actually saves the film from bieng completely embarrassing
. in the end the effects are tyhe only reason to see htis film in the first palce
. being probably the best technical achievement since
" jurassic park
"
, they are absolutely amazing
. we observe the layers of skin
, muscle
, tissue
,
and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
,
and veins pulsing with newly
- pumped blood
. there are a couple ofthe inventive shots with smoke
, fire
, air
and water
,
but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie fo
? waht isnt truly disturbing is that with a great book
, talented actors
and a gr
and budget
, tihs sould have been so much more
. pretty much like jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting
"
)
, paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary
. he ws reponsible for severeal good films
(
" basic instinct
"
and
" starship troopers
)
" adn soem incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total recall
"
)
,
but he has never made anytying that was great
. infront a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly in this collection
. it
' s not better or worse tahn verhoven
' s average film
. he proves once agina that he is incapable of h
andling more complex issues
. adn so
, instead ofthe depth
and chills
, verhoven inserts some of his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
,
and lot
' s of dull acation with blood
and naked bodies
. he even throws in some ofthe hte worst of film clich
? s
- the slowly advancing fireball
, tje villain who comes bakc from the dead
, etc
, etc
.
-
and tops the whole thnig off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year
( you
' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
"
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion
)
.
and all we can ask is why
? the answer isnt simple
.
though hollywood is a movei producing machine
, the business of moviemaking has tothe be about something more than money
. it has to be about telling stories
, nto marketting them
. it hasnt to be about transporting us to a different palce
, to dazzle us withthe magic annd cleverness
. to make us care
, to make us thikn
and feel
. verhoven has obviously missed that point
and thsi film is a proof of that
. it
' s all flesh
and bones
,
but no soul
. a void where its imagination shoudln be
.
