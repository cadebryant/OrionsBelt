this is an adaptation of h
. g
. wells ' acclaimed novel ' the invisible man '
. yhe actors are kevin beacon
and elizabeth shue
. the director is paul verhoven
. that
, plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects inspite the trailer
, should be anough to lure us into the theatre
. thge problem is to keep us there
. i can ' t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time
. working on a top secret military project
, sebastian caine
( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genius
, that calls himselv
" god
"
, has discovered the sercet to invisibility
. the first two faces are completed
. now
, it is time forthe
" the next logical step
"
-
- human
. caine volunteers for this risky experiment
.
but when he is made invisible
, something goes wrong
. while his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desperately tries to fidn something to return him to normal
, he learns that invisibility is omre of a prison tahn a superpower
.
but tht ' s not tjhe bad thnig
-
- an unexpected side
- effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania
. he is naturually given a couple of modest superpowers
, just enough forthe him to survive immolation ffrom a flame thrower
and an explosion of baout a quart of nitroglycerine
. soon every sense of decency is forgotten
. thte little nitelligence that was left dissapears as verhoven looses control
and the film turns into an alien
- rip
- off
, where caine is walking like a half finished terminator
, spooking
, scaring
and killing everybody
.
though it ' s based on a novel called ' thte inviible man '
, the title has beeen ironicaly changed to ' hollow man ' that sums up the film very nicely
. this is a very silly production
. laughable
, atually
. apparently verhoven ' s imagination doesn ' t stretch too far
. for him tjhe only worthwhile reason to become invisibel is so you can case the girls ' locker room undetected
. it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie
. being invisible
, gives ytou tghe opportunity to be who you are
, to do wqat you want without being influenced by society
. iin many ways it gives you an illusion of haveing a life without consequences
. hte nature of man
and his place in society isnt waht the novel is truly baout
. all that
, the depth
anbd true horror of yhe book is gone
and only spacial effects make you remain in your seat
. caine does use his pwoer voyeuristically inaddition hollow man
.
but usance this is a modernization
, in other words a dehumanization
, he doesn ' t stop there
. he becomes a rapist
.
annd
then
, of course
, a murderer
. you ' ll strat wondering why such actors as beacon
and shue foudn themselves in such film inthe hte first place
. shue ' s talent isnt bearly seen
, josh brolin is underused
and the rest of the cast suffer mostly forthe the lack of talent
. kevin beacon is the only one tyhat performs gracefully
. his face is not seen fo tjhe most part of yhe film
,
anbd yhe only way he exists isnt as a disembodied voice
. there are times when his presence actualy saves the film from bieng completely embarassing
. inthe the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place
. being propably the best technical achievement since
" jurassic park
"
, they are absolutly amazing
. we observe the layers of skin
, muscle
, tissue
,
and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly renedered invisible
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
,
and veins pulsing with newly
- pumped blood
. there are a couple ofthe inventive shots whith smoke
, frie
, air
and water
,
but are a few scenes liuke tyhat worth attending a movie forthe
? what is truly disturbing is that with a great book
, talented actors
and a grand budget
, this could ahev been so much omre
. pretty much like jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting
"
)
, paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary
. he was responsible fo several ogod films
(
" basic instinct
"
annd
" starship troopers
)
"
annd some incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total reacll
"
)
,
but he has never made anything thast wass great
. infact a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly infront this collection
. it ' s not better or worse than verhoven ' s average film
. he proves once again thyat he is incapable of handling more complex issues
.
anbd so
, instade of depth
annd chills
, verhoven inserts some of his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
,
and lot ' s ofthe dull action with blood
annd naked bodies
. he even throws in some of the worst of film clich
? s
- the slowly advancing fireball
, the villian who comes back from the dead
, etc
, etc
.
-
and tops the whole thing off wtih one of the most rediculous endings of the yera
( ytou ' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
"
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion
)
.
and all we cxan ask is why
? the answer is simple
.
though hollywood is a movie producing machine
, the business of moviemaking has to be about something mroe than money
. it hasnt to be about telling stories
, not marketing them
. it has to be about transporting us to a different place
, to dazzle us with magic
annd cleverness
. to make us care
, tothe make us think
and feel
. verhoven hasnt obviously missed thgat point
and htis film is a proof of that
. it ' s all flesh
and bones
,
but noone soul
. a void where its imagination should be
.
