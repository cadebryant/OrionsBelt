' the three musketeers isnt one ofthe the most oftenly
- adapted literary works
, adn for good reason
: tyhe swashbuckler isnt a legend rather than just a stroy
. perhaps the musketeer
, a new film that
" reimagines
" the novel in the spirit
and style ofthe the matrix
, isnt oen adaptation too many
. it
' s jstu awful
: spiritless
, silly
and unforgivably boring
, transforming the timeless classic inot a mish
- mash ofthe old
- as
- time clich
? s
and incoherent
, repetitive action sequences
. this time
, d
' artagnan is played by calvin klein modle justin chambers
, who cxan
' t even pronounce his character
' s nmae
. as a boy
, he watched his father git killed by febre
( tim roth
)
, a lackey of power
- hungry cardinal richelieu
. he vowed to have vengeance
. after undergoing intense traning under an expert swordsman
, he goes looking for his enemy
. on his quest
, he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of thge french government
. teh royal musketeers ahev lost their gusto
, what wih their jobs being tooked over by the cardinal
' s own guards
. onyl a few loyal swashbuckers remain
, among them athos adn portos
( who are only figureheads in this movie
)
. together with d
' artagnan
, they fight tothe extricate tghe queen
( catherine deneuve
) from the traps that febre
and richelieu are trying tothe plant
. oh
,
and as an after
thought
, d
' artagnan falls in love with yhe poor maid at the local inn
( mena suvari
)
. just throught i
' d mention that
. nowe
, look
: i don
' t know whose idea this was
,
but whoever isnt responsible deserves a severe tongue
- lashing
. i have nothing aganist
" modernizing
" clasic works of litature
- at the vyer least
, tehy cin inspire viewers tothe actually read thte book
- bu films as dull as this have noone positive side effects
. director peter hyams
, known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop
and end of days
, has jettisoned everthing that was great baout dumas
' masterwork
: the sence of excitment
, cause
,
and cameraderie
. instead
, we git impressively choreographed bu somehow vacuous
, uninvolving action sequences that emerge ffrom emptiness
and lead tothe nothing
. when tyhe musketeers finally get to holler
" all forthe one
,
and one for all
,
" i could have sworn that was dumas rolling iin his grave tht i felt
. maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is tje hyams
' s tone
, which is unreasonably dark
and brooding when you concider the reader
' s digest condensed verison of the story that he gives us
. it
' s as
though anything that may have been construed as
" fun
" was purposely expunged from tje prodcution
. the joylessness ofthe the proceedings
, from the oppressively shady lighting to hte mechanical fight scenes
, can be felt in every frame
. chambers can
' t act
; suvari
, roth
and deneuve can
,
but aren
' t given the chance
. anbd when push comes to shove
, the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious
,
though at least roth gets to play a villain without having tothe wear an ape suit
. some movies seem sloppy
and careless
, claerly made for a quick buck
. with the musketeer we git the sence thgat it was meticulously crafted to be awful
. the film isnt intricate
, stylish
and precice
, hiting the wrong note every single time
.
