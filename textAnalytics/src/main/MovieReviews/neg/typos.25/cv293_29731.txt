alexander dumas ' the three musketeers is one of tjhe most often
- adapted literary works
,
and for good reason
: the swashbuckler is a legend rather thna jstu a story
. perhaps the musketeer
, a new film that
" reimagines
" the novel in the spirit
and style of yhe matrix
, is one adaptation too many
. it ' s just awful
: spiritless
, silly
and unforgivably boring
, transforming tyhe timeless classic inot a mish
- mash of old
- as
- tiem clich
? s
and incoherent
, repetitive acation sequences
. this time
, d ' artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers
, who cant ' t even pronounce his charachter ' s name
. as a boy
, he watched his father get killed by febre
( tim roth
)
, a lackey of power
- hungry cardinal richelieu
. he vowed tothe have vengeance
. affter undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman
, he goes looking for his enemy
. on his quest
, he embroils himselv infront a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french goverment
. the royal musketeers have lost their gusto
, waht with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal ' s own guards
. only a few loyal swashbuckers remain
, among them athos
and portos
( who are onyl figureheads in this movie
)
. together with d ' artagnan
, tehy fight to extricate teh queen
( catherine deneuve
) fomr the traps that febre
and richelieu are trying to plant
. oh
,
adn as an afterthought
, d ' artagnan falls iin love wtih the poor maid at the local inn
( mena suvari
)
. just thought i ' d mention that
. nowe
, look
: i don ' t nkwo whose idea this ws
,
but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tounge
- lashing
. i have nothing against
" modernizing
" classic works of literature
- at tje very least
, they can inspire viewers to actually read the book
-
bu films as dull as this have noone positive side effects
. director peter hyams
, known forthe such masterpieces ofthe modern cinema as timecop
and end of days
, has jettisoned everything that ws gerat about dumas ' masterwork
: the sence of excitment
, cause
,
and camaraderie
. instade
, we get impressively choreographed
but somehow vacuous
, uninvolving action sequences tath emerge ffrom emptiness
and lead to nothing
. wehn tjhe musketeers finaly git to holler
" all for one
,
anbd noe for all
,
" i could have sworn that wass dumas rolling in his grave thgat i felt
. maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams ' s tone
, which is unreasonably dark
and brooding whn you consider the reader ' s digest condensed version ofthe the story that he gives us
. it ' s as
though anything that may have beeen construed as
" fun
" was purposely expunged from the production
. the joylessness of tjhe proceedings
, from tghe oppressively shady lightnig to hte mechanical fight scenes
, can be felt in eveyr frame
. chambers can ' t act
; suvari
, roth
adn deneuve can
,
bu aren ' t given the chance
.
and when push comes tothe shove
, teh use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious
,
though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit
. some movies seem sloppy
and careless
, clearly made forthe a quick buck
. with the musketeer we get the sense that it ws meticulously crafted tothe be awful
. the film is intricate
, stylish
and precise
, hitting the wrong note every single time
.
