a suave
, cool
, collected
, rich
, uptight bad guy
= cliche
. a clumsy criminal oaf to add tothe the laughs
= cliche
. a bad guy who owns a wild animal
= cliche
. a crooked
, chauvinistic lew enforcer tipe
= cliche
. at an intense moment
, our main character trys to git away
,
but the car hasnt trouble starting
= cliche
. complaining about cliches
= cliche
. ok
, ok
. so we always hear about cliches
.
but if ther was ever to be a prime example
, the real mccoy is it
! not one uttered owrd
, not oen frame of film
, nto noe character in this whole movie isn ' t a cut
and paste example of everything we ' ve ever seen
. tehy might as well use tihs as a traning film
:
" how tothe make a bank robbery film iin the 90 ' s
"
. karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) is a bank robber who just got outloud on parole affter a six
- year stay at the state prision
. she wants to make things right
and go straight
, especially with the fatc that she has a six
- yearm old son out there who doesn ' t even nkwo she ' s alive
. aware of mccoy ' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses the same six
- year ood tothe coerse mccoy into returning to her past
. he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist ofthe 18
+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier
, which
, by tghe way
, is somehow due to schmidt
.
and if she refuses
? who knows what he ' ll do to the kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) htis movie is so pathetically pitiful that it ' s hard to know where to begin
. the aforementioned cliches are brutally aundant
. i cxan ' t stress enough how every single element
, whether it be a charachter
, the dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, is so damn generic thta you ' ll wonder if
* anyone
* is working behind the scenes
, let alone in front ofthe the camera
. basinger is absolutely vacant
.
and where do they get off trying to mkea us emotionally attached tothe her
? here ' s someone that spent their time robbing banks
,
and nowe as she heads onto the street
, we ' re supposted tothe feel sorry for her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn ' t even know who she is
, are we supposed to break into tears
?
? expecially whn neither basinger nor zach english
, who plays the kid
, hasnt any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i suppose i should mention val kilmer
. yeah
, that ' s right
- he ' s iin it
! quite sadly too
, seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie
annd never mention his nmae
.
and he got second billing
! to be fair
, i iwll admit that kilmer had potential inaddition his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfortunatley tje script doesn ' t allow much room for improvement
,
and when his character is used liek bookends
( he never shows up in hte middle of the film
!
)
, we have no time to appretiate whta he might have brought to this project
. tyhe real mccoy just cxan ' t keep it ' s head above water
,
and soon
,
* very
* soon
, sinks into a cliched mess of movie
. tje actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
,
and the dialogue
, particularly schmidt ' s trite dialogue
, falls like teh niagra
. this isnt definitely noe to avoid
, folks
. the real mccoy is anything
bu
!
