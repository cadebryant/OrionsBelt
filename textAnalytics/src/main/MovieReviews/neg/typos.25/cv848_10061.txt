a suave
, cool
, collected
, rich
, uptight bad guy
= cliche
. a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs
= cliche
. a bad guy who owns a wild animal
= cliche
. a crooked
, chauvinistic law enforcer type
= cliche
. at an intense moment
, our main character tries to get away
, bu tjhe car hasnt trouble starting
= cliche
. complaining about cliches
= cliche
. ok
, ok
. so we alwyas hear about cliches
.
but if there was ever to be a prime exmaple
, the real mccoy is it
! not one uttered owrd
, not one frame of film
, nto oney character infront this whole movie isn
' t a cut anbd paste exemple of everything we
' ve ever seen
. they might as well use tihs as a traning film
:
" how tothe make a bank robbery film in the 90
' s
"
. karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) is a bank robber who jsut got out on parole after a six
- year stay at the state prison
. she whants to make things right adn go straight
, especially with the fact that she has a six
- year old son out there who doesn
' t even know she
' s alive
. aware of mccoy
' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses the same six
- yera old to coerse mccoy inot returing to her past
. he whants mccoy tothe pull off an elaborite heist ofthe 18
+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier
, which
, by the way
, is somehow due tothe schmidt
.
and if she refuses
? who knows wqat he
' ll do to tjhe kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) tihs movie is so pathetically pitiful that it
' s hard to know where to begin
. the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant
. i can
' t stress enough how eveyr single element
, whether it be a charcter
, yhe dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, is so damn generic thgat you
' ll wonder if
* anyone
* isnt working behind tyhe scenes
, let alone in front of tyhe camera
. basinger isnt absolutely vacant
.
and where do tehy git off trying to mkea us emotionally attached tothe her
? here
' s someone thast spent their time robbing banks
,
and now as she heads onto the street
, we
' re supposed to feel sorry forthe her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn
' t even know who she is
, are we supposed to break into tears
?
? especialy when neither basinger nor zach english
, who plays the kid
, hasnt any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i suppose i shoudln mention val kilmer
. yeah
, that
' s right
- he
' s infact it
! quite sadly too
, seing as how i cin discuss everything about hte movie anbd never mention his name
.
and he got second billing
! to be fair
, i will admiting thgat kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfortunately the script doesn
' t allow much room for improvement
,
and when his character is used like bookends
( he never shows up inthe the middle of the film
!
)
, we have no time to apprieciate what he might have brought to this project
. the real mccoy jsut cxan
' t keep it
' s head above water
,
and soon
,
* vyer
* soon
, sinks into a cliched mess ofthe movie
. the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
, adn the dialogue
, articularly schmidt
' s trite dialogue
, falls like the niagra
. this is definitely one to avoid
, folks
. the real mccoy is anytying
but
!
