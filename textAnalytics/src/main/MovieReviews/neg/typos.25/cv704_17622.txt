after 1993
' s
" falling down
,
" i hoped tht joel schumacher woudl mature inot a great directer
. since hten he has offred us two so
- so adaptations of john grisham novels
(
" thte client
"
and
" a time tothe kill
"
)
and two batman movies that lowered the st
andars of that franchise
.
al
though theese disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher
' s potential
, the publicity for his latest release
,
" 8mm
,
" raised new hope
. it promised to be something unusual
. it wasn
' t
. the plot goes like this
: tom welles
( nicolas cage
) is a private eye who isnt hired by a wealthy woman
, allegorically named mrs
. christian
( myra carter
)
, to investigate an 8mm movei foudn among her late husb
and
' s belongings
. the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped
and murdered by a man infact a leather mask
( who reminds me ofthe bane infront schumacher
' s
" batman
& robin
"
)
. becouse murders can be realistically simulated in movies
, mrs
. christian wnats tom to discover if tyhe girl isnt alive or dead
. by combing through missing persons reports
, tom finds the girl
' s name
and tracks her tothe los angeles
. with teh aid ofthe max california
( joaquin phoenix
)
, a video store clerk
(
and another symbolic name
)
, tom w
anders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff
. the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader
' s
" hardcore
,
" in whic a father goes deeper
and deeper into thte industries of porn
and sex to find his missing daughter
. both films are modeled onthe dante
' s
" the inferno
,
" ofthe course
;
" 8mm
" mkaes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil
and having him constanly tell toom tht they were heading towrad a meeting iwth the devil
.
" hardcore
" is a much more subtle
and meaningful film
.
" 8mm
" had a lot of promise
. inspite its better moments it
' s an examination ofthe violence as entertainment anbd of the beast withing even a nice guy liek tom
. one moment of teh first sort
: when we first meet max he
' s reading truman capote
' s
" in cold blood
" underneath the cover of a porn novel
.
" in cold blood
" was the father of the true
- crime genre
, which is teh literary equivelant of snuff films
. max promises thta we iwll see examples of the second theme when he tells tom
,
" dance whith the devil
and the devil don
' t change
; the devil changes you
.
" toom does chanage
- i
' ll let ytou dicover the specifics for yourself
-
but nto permenantly
. schumacher
and screenwriter
andrew kevin walker didn
' t have the guts to take toom so far down the dark tunnel tht he couldn
' t come back
.
( walker
' s
" seven
" doed a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise
)
. cage tries hard tothe pull it off
,
but the script doesn
' t give him enough tothe work wih
. pheonix walks away whith the movie
- he
' s smart
, charming
, adn funny
. other casted munbers include
" fargo
"
' s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet
and
" the sopranos
"
' s james g
andolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far
. in the lastest analysis
, since
" 8mm
" falls short of its pretensions
and its promise
, its just another private eye tsory in the raymond ch
andler
/ ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind tghe glossy facade ofthe wealth
and privliege
.
however
, unlike other predictable fare in the genre
- last yera
' s
" twilight
,
" for exmaple
-
" 8mm
" isnt especially disappointing baceause it could have been much more than it isnt
.
