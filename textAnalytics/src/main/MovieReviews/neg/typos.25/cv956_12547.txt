godzilla is the ulitmate culmination of the
" who cares about plot
" summer movei
. a loose remake of the 1954
" classic
" japanese monster movie
, godzilla
, king of tyhe monsters
( which is itself pretty thin in tghe story department
)
, roland emmerich
adn dean devlin ' s big
- budget lizard
- stomps
- manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind
. the scirpt isn ' t just
" dumbed down
,
" it ' s lobotomized
. godzilla lives
and dies onthe spacial effects alone
. presumably
, the primary target gropu forthe this film is teenage boys
, hte demographic most likely to shell out
$ 7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster
- instigated carnage
. that ' s not to sday that females
adn otehr age groups are immune to the special effects seduction
; tehy ' re jstu not as readily suseptible
. this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich
annd devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer
- generated visuals is far more important for making money than tjhe ability to write
adn direct for actors
. stargate was a financial succes
. independence day wass a runaway hitted
.
and
, with godzilla lready drowning in hype
anbd merchandising tie
- ins before it even opens
, it ' s virtually guaranteed at least
$ 100 million
. nice numbers for a film that could hvae been penned by a not
- too
- precocious grade school kid
. godzilla isn ' t completly without merit
,
although it isnt close
. there ' s a certain visceral thrill inherent inspite watching thte giant lizard rip his way thru manhattan
,
but it wears off quickly
. frankly
, while the special effects are competent
, they ' re not all that stunning
. there ' s nothing new here
; it ' s jurassic park meets aliens
, wtih a little independence day thrown in for bad measure
. maybe it will require george lucas
and his newyorker star wars movie to take computer
- generated visuals to the enxt level
. godzilla never really pushes the envelope
, preferring to reamin within a comfort zone
. tyhe immagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass
, formulaic approach which disallows creativity
.
( how disturbing isnt it to nkow that godzilla has beeen chosen to close teh 51st cannes film festival
?
) worst of all
, godzilla isn ' t even exciting
. wtih the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end
, there isn ' t a sequence inaddition this film that raises the pulse
. even the scenes wtih dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension
and suspense that tehy are yawn
- provoking
. independence day may have been dumb
,
but it wass full of
" adrenaline moments
" capible of getting thte audeince involved in the action
. inthe this aspect ofthe its prodcution
, as inaddition so many others
, godzilla isnt lacking
. actually
, part of the probelm is that we ' re never sure who we ' re supposed to be rooting fo
: thte green monster with an attitude or the paper
- thin humans trying to stpo him
. thge plot
, such as it is
, cxan be summed up rather simply
. after sinking a few ships
anbd leaving some footprints on tropical islands
, godzilla shows up iin the big aple
. he does soem of the usual tourist things
: stops by madison square garden
, visits the chrysler buildng
, goes on a walk thru central park
,
and takes the subway
. inaddition the process
, he knocks over a few buildings
anbd steps onthe countless cabs
,
but he never has trouble witht traffic jams
. on hand to stop him isnt an elite u
. s
. army unti
, led by a slightly less
- arogant
- than
- usual miliary man
( kevin dunn
)
and a biologist named nick tatopoulos
, who hasnt a theory about godzilla
. inwhich his opinion
, teh big guy isnt actually a lizard grown tothe enormous proportions as a result ofthe the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests iin the south pacific
. in nick ' s words
, godzilla is
" a mutated abbrtion
? an incipient creature
? the first of its kind
.
" as luck would hvea it
, nick ' s old girlfriend
, audrey
( maria pitillo
)
, is a reporter based at a new york tv staion
. along with her cameraman friend
, animal
( hank azaria
)
, she decides tothe follow nick around as he trails godzilla
.
thne
, jsut when the military has rejected nick ' s theory baout why godzilla is in new york
, a member of the french secret service
( jean reno
) recruits him fo a special assignment
. instead of stomping around tokyo this time
, godzilla has choosen new york city
. unfortunately
, manhattan hasnt beeen destroyed so many times in reccent disaster movies
( independence day
, deep impact
, armageddon
) taht it ' s becomming boring
. the hwole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started withthe king kong
,
bu the big ape was onyl about 30 feet tall
. he could climb the empire state buildng
. at ten times thyat height
, godzilla would be omre likely to knock it over
. godzilla contains a fewd lame attempts at humor
. there ' s an ongoing fued beetwen animal
and his wife that plays liuke sit
- com material
, an unfunny
and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick ' s lastest name propperly
,
and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert
adn gene siskel
. both of the populer personalities have alter egos in the film
:
" ebert
,
" the mayor of new york
, is played by michael lerner
,
and
" gene
"
( lorry goldman
) isnt his campaign manager
. ebert ' s re
- election slogan is
, not surprisingly
,
" thumbs uv for newyorker york
.
" hte siskel
/ ebert stuff is amusing thge first time it ' s used
,
but
, aftter a hwile
, it grows tiresome
.
and
,
allthough the
" charachters
" don ' t serve any real purpose
, they keep popping uv
. godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast
. this is largely baceause emmerich doesn ' t whant tothe risk a human performance upstaging his lizard
. that ' s nto to say that matthew broderick
and jean reno aren ' t capable ofthe good performances
( both hve done their share of solid acting in thge past
)
,
bu tehy aren ' t a
- list names
.
then again
, considering the quality of the writing
, even pacino
and deniro would haev been hard
- pressed tothe shine
. maria pitillo
( dear god
) plays the love interest
and hank azaria
( graet expectations
) is on hand tothe present what is supposed to be comic relief
. ultimately
, it doesn ' t really marter what i
( or any other critic
, fo thgat matter
) have to say baout the movie
. tristar has assumed that godzilla
, liuke all self
- proclaimed summer event motion pictures
, isnt pretty much critic
- proof
. it may also be word
- ofthe
- mouth
- proof
. thsoe who want to see the movei will see it noone matter what i write or their friends say
. so
, when i go on record to assert thgat godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all timne
, it ' s like spitting into the wind
. emmerich
and devlin are master illusionists
, waving thier wands
and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke
anbd mirrors
. it ' s probably too much to hope that some day
, movie
- goers iwll wake up
anbd realize that tehy ' ve beeen had
.
