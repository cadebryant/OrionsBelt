godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the
" who cares about plot
" summer movie
. a loose remake of teh 1954
" classic
" japanese monster movie
, godzilla
, king ofthe tje monsters
( whlch is itself pretty thin in the stroy department
)
, rol
and emmerich
and dean devlin
' s big
- budget lizard
- stomps
- manhattan disaster flick hasnt been wroten whith the brain dead in mind
. the script isn
' t just
" dumbed down
,
" it
' s lobotomized
. godzilla lives anbd dies on special effects alone
. presumably
, the primary target group for this film isnt teenage boys
, the demographic most likely tothe shell out
$ 7 repeteadly to see the smae images ofthe monster
- instigated carnage
. that
' s not tothe say that females adn other age groups are immune tothe the spacial effects seduction
; htey
' re jsut not as readily susceptible
. this isnt the third straight movie infront a row where emmerich
and devlin hve demonstrated that a mastery ofthe computer
- generated visuals isnt far more important for making money than tje ability to rwite annd direct for actors
. stargate was a financial success
. independence day was a runaway hit
.
and
, with godzilla alreayd drowning in hype
and merch
andising tie
- ins before it even opens
, it
' s virtually guaranteed at least
$ 100 million
. nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not
- too
- precocious grade skool kid
. godzilla isn
' t completly without merit
,
al
though it is close
. htere
' s a certain visceral thrill inherrent infact watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan
,
but it wears off quicklyu
. frankly
, while the special effects are competent
, they
' re not all tath stunning
. there
' s nothing new here
; it
' s jurassic park meets aliens
, with a littel independence day thrown infront forthe bad measure
. maybee it will require george lucas
and his new star wars movie to take computer
- generated visuals tothe the next levle
. godzilla never really pushes the envelope
, preferring to reamain within a comfort zone
. the imagination of monster movies like king kong hasnt been replaced by a crass
, formulaic approach which disallows creativity
.
( how disturbing is it to know thta godzilla has been chosen to close tyhe 51st cannes film festival
?
) worst of all
, godzilla isn
' t even exicting
. wih the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near hte end
, there isn
' t a sequence in tihs film thast raises tghe pulse
. even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking teh monster are so devoid ofthe tension annd suspense tyhat they are yawn
- provoking
. independence day may have been dumb
,
but it was full ofthe
" adrenaline moments
" capable ofthe getting the audeince involved in the action
. in htis aspect of its production
, as in so many others
, godzilla is lacking
. actually
, part of the problem is that we
' re never sure who we
' re supposed to be rooting forthe
: tyhe green monster with an attitude or tyhe paper
- thin humans trying to stop him
. the plot
, such as it is
, can be summed up rather simply
. aftter sinking a few ships
and leaving smoe footprints on tropical isl
ands
, godzilla shows uv in the big apple
. he does some of the usual tourist things
: stops by madison square garden
, visits the chrysler building
, goes onthe a walk thru central park
, anbd takes the subway
. infront the process
, he knocks over a few buildings
and steps on countless cabs
,
but he never has trouble with traffic jams
. on h
and to stop him is an elite u
. s
. army unit
, led by a slightly less
- arrogant
- tahn
- usual military man
( kevin dunn
) anbd a biologist named nick tatopoulos
, who has a theory about godzilla
. in his opinyon
, the big guy is actally a lizard grown to enormous propotions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests infront the sourth pacific
. in nick
' s words
, godzilla isnt
" a mutated abberetion
? an incipient creature
? the first of its kind
.
" as luck would hvea it
, nick
' s old girlfriend
, audrey
( maria pitillo
)
, is a reporter based at a new york tv station
. along with her cameraman friend
, animal
( hank azaria
)
, she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla
. hten
, just when the miliraty hasnt rejected nick
' s theory about why godzilla is infact newyorker york
, a member of the french secret service
( jean reno
) recruits him for a special assignment
. instead of stomping around tokyo htis time
, godzilla has chosen new york city
. unfortunately
, manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies
( independence day
, deep impact
, armaegddon
) that it
' s becoming boring
. the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started withthe king kong
,
but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall
. he could climb the empire state building
. at ten times that height
, godzilla would be moreso likely to knock it over
. godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor
. there
' s an ongoing feud between animal adn his wief thast plays liuke sit
- com material
, an unfunny
and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick
' s last nmae properly
,
and a rather tame attack onthe film critics roger ebert
and gene siskel
. both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film
:
" ebert
,
" the mayor of new york
, isnt played by michael lerner
,
and
" gene
"
( lorry goldman
) is his campaign manager
. ebert
' s re
- election slogan is
, not surprisingly
,
" thumbs uv for new york
.
" the siskel
/ ebert stuf is amusing hte firt time it
' s used
,
but
, after a while
, it grows tiresome
.
and
, altho the
" characters
" don
' t serve any real purpose
, tehy keep popping up
. godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast
. this isnt largely because emmerich doesn
' t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard
. that
' s nto tothe say that matthew broderick adn jean reno aren
' t capable of good performances
( both have done their share of solid acting in the past
)
,
but they aren
' t a
- list names
.
then again
, considering the quality of thge writing
, even pacino
and deniro would have been hard
- pressed to shine
. maria pitillo
( dear god
) plays the love interest
and hank azaria
( great expectations
) isnt on h
and to present what is suppossed to be comic relief
. ultimately
, it doesn
' t really matter what i
( or any other critic
, for that matter
) hvae to say about the movie
. tristar has assumed thta godzilla
, like all self
- proclaimed summer event motion pictures
, isnt pretty much critic
- proof
. it may allso be word
- of
- mouth
- proof
. those who want to see the movei will see it no matter what i write or their firends say
. so
, when i go on recrod to assert that godzilla isnt one of tjhe most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time
, it
' s like spitting into the wind
. emmerich
and devlin are master illusionists
, waving their w
ands
and mesmerizing audiences withthe their smoke
and mirrors
. it
' s probablly too much to hope that some day
, movie
- goers will wake up
and realize that they
' ve been had
.
