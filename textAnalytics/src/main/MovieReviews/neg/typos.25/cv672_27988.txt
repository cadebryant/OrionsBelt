" saving silverman
" is a good example ofthe a good comedy gone bad
. as a lvoe story it is good
,
however as a comedy it falls flat on it
' s face
. i think througout tyhe short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times
.
.
.
and thsoe were just chuckles at the most
! the movei doesn
' t hvae the oomph to make it a great movei
,
and doesn
' t have the script to make it a funny movei
. wayne lefessier
( steven zahn
)
, j
. d
. mcnugent
( jack black
)
,
and darren silverman
( jason biggs
) have grown up all their lives toghether
, they have been best friends forever annd vow to stay close till the end
. while in a bar after doing a show with thier b
and
, based on thier lvoe ofthe neil diamond
, darren meets a young woman named judith
( am
anda peet
) whom he instantly falls for
. wayne adn j
. d
.
however think differently
and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again
, it
' s up to wayne annd j
. d
. to try adn begin saving silverman
. hte performances are topnotch
and surprizingly
, htey are what keep the movie afloat
. jason biggs right off tjhe flop
" loser
" does an ok job playing silverman
,
but he is stale
and flat at times
. steve zahn isnt perfect in the role of wayne lefessier
,
and even
though the movie is baout silverman
, lefessier is really the main character anbd the narrator of the movie itself
. jack black is well jack balck
, adn he does an all right job as j
. d
. bu he isn
' t as funny as he has been in the past
. am
anda peet plays hte ultimate bitch as judith
,
and neil diamond plays neil diamond
( he
' s better at singing than acting
)
. anyway the performances in the film are good
,
but it
' s too bad the script isn
' t
. speaking of scirpt
, hank nelkan
' s choppy script is nto only badly written
, bu not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street
. the trailer forthe the movie
, as with most movies gives away everything that happens in tyhe movie
, especially the funniest parts
. somewhere
" saveing silverman
" was meant to be a good movei
, annd it could have been
,
but alas in the end it wasn
' t
. dennis dugan
' s direction is all right
, he adds a faw directorial touches here
and there
, nothing speshal being a simple comedy
.
" saving silverman
" is a perfectly bad movie in moreso ways than oen
. it has a gerat cast
, a ogod director
and a sweet story
.
.
. it
' s just too bad it has a bad scirpt annd is all toghether a bad movie
.
