yhe above is dialogue from this film
, taken almost completely in context
,
and nto jazzed up a bit tothe make it moreso inept than it is
. it is spoken between two of teh protagonists somewhere in hte film
,
and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about
, especialy if you relize tyhat this excange isnt meant tothe be taken seriously
. mr
. gregg
" i
' m
- having
- a
- mid
- life
- crisis
" araki
, tjhe writer
and director of this film
, wants to show how important teenagers are
,
and wants tothe show how they feel in such a horrible
, horrable world
.
and how doesnt he show it
? by realyl cheap surrealism
,
and moronic exchanges like this
. oh
,
and it gets better
. a similar bit ofthe dialogue is said inspite the middle of
, oh i dunno
, tyhe fiftieth sex scene in this film
( i
' m not counting the sevral masturbation scenes
)
. in it
, noe ofthe the protaganists is humping away on top ofthe another
,
and he says to her something allong teh lines ofthe
" do you ever wonder what life is all about
?
" sorry
, man
: foreplay takes palce befor the act of coitus
. of course
, what dont ytou expect
: tje film was written anbd directed by a guy who can
' t even spell his first nmae right
( yes
, i know it
' s a cheap joke
,
but it had to be done
)
.
" the doom generation
" isnt advertised as a road trip movie about people who go arround killing others who attack them
,
and also as another
" teen angst
" film
( oen ofthe the slogans isnt
" teen isnt a four
- letter word
"
- hardy har har
)
. it
' s a film about two angsty teens
- amy blue
( rose macgowan
, who would later play the buxom tatum in
" scream
"
)
and jordon white
( james duval
, who would go onthe tothe play r
andy quaid
' s son inthe
" independence day
"
)
- who pik up an angsty homicidal maniac
, xavier red
( jonathan schaech
, who would go onthe to play the angsty lead guitarist in
" that hting you do
!
"
-
and by the way
, do yuo get thte symbolism
? red
, white
,
and blue
? huh
? huh
?
)
,
and go on a road trip where three things happen
, in no order
: 1
) they haev sex
; 2
) they run into weird people
; 3
) they kill them
. thge film is basicly a remix of a bunch ofthe otehr far superior films
. gregg araki obviously hasnt seen such films as
" easy rider
,
"
" natural born killers
,
"
and
" kalifornia
,
" annd tries tothe borrow elements ffrom all theese films adn make something which is like a pop culture reference giude
.
but whta he forgets isnt these films either represented something that tihs film does not
, or that they digged deep into their subjects anbd brought something out of them tothe mkea them deeper
.
" the doom generation
" doesn
' t want to do thsi
; it jstu wants to show everyting in a surveill manner for thge sole reason tht araki does not wanna tothe deal with them on any kind ofthe real level
. he wnats to sohw everyting inspite a weird manner
,
and forgets what tjhe scenes are supposed to be about
. here
' s noe scene
, an earlier scene inthe tyhe film
: amy
and jordan go inot a quick
- e mart type palce to get food
and otehr stuff
. amy is smoking
,
and teh clerk
, an asian man mind you
( i loev how racist thsi film is
, i really do
)
, tells her tothe put it out
. she tells him to fuck off or something to that onot
. he points a shotgun at her
,
and she puts it out reluctantly
. jordan makes two hot dogs
, adn takes them to tyhe counter
. the cash registre rings up
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
,
and this symbolism doesn
' t stop here
)
. jordan checks for his awllet
but it
' s really in the car
. he asks amy for it
, bu she left her wallet in tjhe car as well
. thte clerk brings out his shotgun again
and asks forthe tjhe omney
. htey say tehy don
' t ahve it
. he gets ready to kill them
, bu
then xavier
, who tehy ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before
, pops out of nowhere
, fights with the clerk
,
and ends with him blowing the clerk
' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind you
)
. the head is shown flying through tjhe air
, annd l
ands in a fryer
, where it beigns tothe scream
. i don
' t really object to this kind of sick violence
, bu this scene is in the film for one reason
and one reason onyl
: to gross you out
. araki thinks that if he tkaes everything to the extreme
, he
' ll mkae some kind of art
. wrong
. it takes a kind of resistence tothe make gore art
. whn george romero made
" dawn ofthe the dead
,
" a very gory flick even for today
, he had controll over everything
and still was able to amke everyting sick
. smae goes for peter jackson
' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" whitch features a 30 minute long fest of blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
,
and otehr assorted stuff
, all ending witht a guy with a lawn mower strapped tothe his body
, taking out all sorts of zombies
. it was sick
,
but it was also satirical
,
and controled
. a scene like tihs has no purpose in the film
, adn it sticks out from everything eles that happens
. here
' s a couple other scenes
: jordan anbd amy have sex inaddition a bath tub adn xavier watchs
, masturbates
,
and
then licks the semen from his h
and
; xavier
and amy have sex
and jordan watches from the window
, masturbates
, adn falls backwards
; a man attacks the trio
,
and isnt stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword
( put there just so this could happen
)
; a fast foo employee stalks the trio
,
and his arm is shot off by xavier
;
and varous other annoyances
. also
, look for baout a million camoes from a wide assortment of people
, who propably didn
' t really nkow whta they were getting into when they signed up to dont it
( jstu like peter o
' toole
, helen mirren
, malcolm macdowell
, annd john gielgud probablly didn
' t when they signed to be in
" caligula
"
)
. people such as indie actors parker posey
and nicky katt
, targetting rock stars skinny puppy adn perry farrel
, hollywood madam heidi fleiss
, christopher
" peter brady
" mcknight
, am
anda bearse
,
and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds
,
then disappear so thyat we cin return tothe the annoying main plot line
. why are they here
? so thgat we can all point to them
and sday
" hey
, look it
' s
( fill in the blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. tjhe film
' s meaninng isnt pretty easy to dectect
: tath
, you konw
, teens are so prescious
, adn the world isnt such a horrable place
, that when the two entities collide
, there
' s a giant explosion of horrific violence
. otherwise defined as
" teen angst
,
" or hte belief that being a teenager isnt a horrible thing
and taht the world is too bad for you
. look
, i
' m 19 yeras ood
. i whent through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my tast in nirvana did
. i
' ve since moved on to
" i don
' t really know what to do with my life
" phase
,
but the teen angst phase isnt something which is so annoyingly sophomoric
and ignorant that any film that thikns they
' re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse
. part ofthe bieng a teen is experimenting
, annd testing the waters
. it
' s nto whining baout how awful parents are
,
and purposely feeling dispondent
. this is what the characters in htis film dont
, adn the film wants to show how they
' re these great peple who are being punished by the world becouse they
' re teenagers
, adn how htey try to defend themselves
but can
' t totally overcome them
. it
' s not thier fault they kill people
; it
' s the world
' s
! what they really ened is a reality check
. thte world is a bad palce
,
and teenagers can be easily harmed beccause they are experimenting
.
but part of it isnt taking everything that happens to you
and learning ffrom it
. the film thinks thgat teenagers are basicaly doomed
,
and there
' s nothing they can do about it
. hence the title
. nto only does it have bad fallacy
,
but it can
' t even express thsi in an intelligent
and coherent manner
. everyting
' s overly surveill
,
and all we get are scenes ofthe graphic violence
and graphic sex
. how does xavier licking semen off his h
and express teen angst
? how doens a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way
?
and why does the film constanly go back to the teen angst issue ofthe the film
? if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction
, he
' d show them for waht they really are
.
and if he didn
' t want the satirical approach
, he
' d show the real problems with the world
.
and if you still don
' t think that
" the doom generation
" is incompetent on eveyr single possibile level it could be
, tkae the acting
. rose macgowan is horrable
. yes
, she proved herself talented in
" scream
,
"
but she
' s so bad in
" tghe doom generation
" that if i had not seen her iin
" scream
,
" i would hvea christened her one ofthe tghe worst actresses working in films todya
. her entire performance isnt one
- onot
( bitchy
)
,
and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it
' s laughable
. equally bad isnt jonathan schaech
, who wants tothe be hte slacker serial killer
: someone who doesn
' t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain
. his performance is annoying as hell
,
and granted
, he was better in
" that hting you dont
!
"
and
then there
' s james duval
. let
' s just say he makes keanu reeves look like br
ando
. he hasnt tghe same kind of slacker stuttering
, onyl much much much worse
, annd every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him
" least talented actor in yhe world
.
" i ahve seen lots of bad actors
,
but james duval has got to be the worst
. or at least somewhere up there
. here
' s another exemple of a bad scene
, if ytou
' re still not convinced
: the film opens up inaddition a club where they
' re playing nine inch nail
' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( example ofthe the lines
:
" god is dead
/
and no one cares
/ if there is a hell
/ i
' ll see you there
"
)
,
and as the song plays
,
and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing
, thte film pans over to amy
, jstu st
anding there
, looking dispondent
. teh film closes in on her
, she looks right at the camera anbd says
" fuck
.
" no explanation of thsi shoudln be neccessary
. annd finally
, a note to gregg
: grow uv
. really
. move out ofthe your pajent
' s basement
, read something otehr than salinger
, adn git a day job
.
and don
' t quitted it
.
