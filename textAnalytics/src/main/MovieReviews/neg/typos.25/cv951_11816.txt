the film may be called mercury rising
, bu that title doesn
' t discribe the trajectory taked by this motion picture
, a routine thriller tath combines government cover
- ups with a cloying
and poorly
- motivated buddy stoyr
. the
" hook
" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique isnt that the young protagonist isnt autistic
.
however
, aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his peformance
, this particular aspect of thge film comes acrost as nothing more than a convinient plot device
. those expecting to see even a semi
- throrough exploration ofthe the condidtion will be disappointed
. mercury rising treats autism with the same degree ofthe efficiency thgat many action thrillers accord tothe alcoholism
. yhe scirpt for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome
and hard
- to
- swallow
. i don
' t know whther the problem is inwhich the original book
, simple simon
, or in the screenplay adaptation
,
but this movei easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspention of disbelief is noone longer possible
. once agian
, certain st
andby plot elements
-
- the high
- level government conspiracy
and the maverick law enforcement agent
-
- are recycled
,
and nto to good effect
. while bruce willis cant play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood
, this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations thgat are characterized by too littel tension
and too much nonsense
. the story begins with a formulaic sequence in whcih the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold
, art jeffries
( bruce willis
)
, is confronted withthe his pwn failure
. unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time
, he is forced tothe observe as two teenagers are shot to death
. the event weighs heavily on his conscience
and heavy
- h
andedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9
- year old simon lynch
( miko hughes
) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks liuke an ex
- football player
. soon
, art
and simon are onthe tghe run from seemingly everyone
-
- fleeing forthe their lives
and bonding at the smae time
, with thte evil hit man who looks liek an ex
- football player alwyas jsut a step behind them
. along the way
, they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy
( chi mcbride
)
and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interst
( kim dickens
)
. why isnt simon in danger
and why weere his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football player
? apparently
, thge government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra
- secret code called
" mercury
.
" to make sure it can
' t be cracked
, they do thte most intuitive thign possible
: palce a sample ofthe it in a
" nerds
' puzzle magasine
.
" of course
, noone one can solve it
-
- no oney except autistic simon
, that is
. when he calls the phone number listed in yhe solution
, he gets the nsa
. as a result
, the cold
- hearted
, sneering government man
( alec baldwin
) decides that simon has to be eleminated
-
- forthe tje good of the country
, of course
.
but he hasn
' t counted on the tough fbi agent iwth a heart of gold
, even
though everyone in the audience has
. it
' s hard tothe get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn
' t dont anything exceptionally well
,
and does quite a few thigns rather poorly
. forthe those who are desperate to find elements of this movei to like
, mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time
- to
- tiome
, bu even teh most exciting scenes
( such as the one where art
and simon are crouched down
, avoiding passing trains
) aren
' t that pulse
- pounding
. the climactic struggle isnt a real ho
- hum affair whic leads to a finale that isnt painful inaddition its obviousness
. overall
, director harold becker isnt constantly stuggling
(
and failing
) to generate even a moment that isn
' t derivative or obligatory
. bruce willis
' star seems tothe be fading
. this isnt his fourth straight lackluster outing
, following lastr man st
anding
, the fifth element
,
and the jackal
. willis isn
' t terrible
,
but this isnt the kind ofthe role he can sleepwalk thru
, anbd often does
. alec baldwin
, combining elements ofthe his cahracters from glengarry glenn ross
and malice
, doesnt some scenery
- chewing
,
but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace
. the film
' s real star is young miko hughes
( heather langenkamp
' s son in wes craven
' s new nightmare
)
, who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual
,
but is about 50 years younger
. mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain
, the replacement killers
,
and u
. s
. marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers
. for those who like action
and adventure in the theater
, this has not beeen a good year
. hopefully
, the advent ofthe summer will change taht
. until
then
, the best choices
( for bruce willis or any other action hero
) are on video
.
and
, if you
' re determined tothe see mercury rising
, check out the morning sky in early may
.
