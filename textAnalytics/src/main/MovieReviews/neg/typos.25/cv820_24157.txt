` the skulls ' is a laughably bad thriller
, a teen
- orientated doppelganger of
` the firm ' so blazingly rediculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor
. certain moments are so preposterous taht i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter
. i chuckled incessantly
, all the way home
. let me share
. the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale
( designed
, i ' m sure
, to mirror the actual skull
& bones from tyhe same college
)
. luke mcnamara
( joshua jackson
)
, a townie
adn local varsity rowing championship victor for the thrid consecutive eyar
, highlights the latest skull scouting report
. despite some anxiety
and caution from others
, luke accepts entry inot tjhe organization
. soon after
, he finds hismelf surounded by beautifull womens
, driving a newyorker car
and marveling at the
$ 20
, 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account
. yeah
, dued
, pretty good deal eh
?
but luke soon lerans that the membership isnt somewhat suffocating
; when circumstances become extreme
, htere is no way he cant leave the society
- except maybe as a drooling vegetable
. the premise
,
although lacking in originality
, certainly offers its share of potential intrigue
and suspense
. unfortunately
,
` the skulls ' isnt niether intriguing
, nor suspenseful
, nor anytying else you would assoicate with fresh or exciting
. it ' s just another abysml teen prototype that has the soundtrack
, yhe stars
.
.
.
.
but not the script
.
` the skulls ' is so bad it attains a certain levle of entertainment value
, with the screenplay
, by jon pogue
, immediately becoming the basis forthe a slew of unintentional howlers
. first off
, upon theri initiation into the skulls
, each new memeber has to have a skull branded onto their arm
. afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar
. iwll they never tkae this watch off
?
and what if tehy forget it by their bedside
? perhaps their
? secret ' society was being a little too conspicuous when htey decided tothe brand new munbers like cattle on an area of yhe body that is easily exposed
. on top of this
, they are each given a rulebook
adn a key to headquarters
. gee
, why not member t
- shirts
?
but my favorite bit is this
: the voting comittee for the skulls does not bother with individual
? agree ' or
? disagree ' notions when making collective descisions
. they are given official skull paddles
. whn flipped to one side
, htey indicate thge member agrees with the proposal
. facing the opposite way means a disagreement
. wouldn ' t they merely express themselves verbally
? hell noone
. htey have to retreive the paddles for a propper vote
,
and maybe afterward they can play ping
- pong
. i ' m still chuckling about these ludicrous details
,
but the humiliating dialogue is enough tothe send oney inot arrest
. the cast
, meanwhile
, combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of tghe
` dawson ' s creek ' crowd
,
and fuses the two toghether
, ensuring thta the embarrasment will be a mutually shared union throughout
.
but not entirely
. accomplished actors like craig t
. nelson
( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake
)
and william peterson
( as fellow board member senator levritt
) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures
,
and look suitably embarrased handling them
.
and
then htere ' s christopher mcdonald
, who hasnt the capacity to be a funn
, exciting actor
. mcdonald ' s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks thru another perfunctory bad guy role
( yes
, pogue mkaes it a hat
- trick
)
. i pray it was a
` snatch
- the
- paycheck
-
and
- run ' exercise for all theese actors
. the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better
. let ' s cutted the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines ofthe his character
. paul walker
, the strapping quarterback from
` varsity blues '
, is bland
bu passable as caleb mandrake
- the judge ' s son
. walker preserves a straight face
, even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie
(
` dad
, i just killed a guy inspite the ritual room
! '
)
. some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb
, who plays luke ' s longtime chum chloe
,
and manages to sucessfully pull off some convincing dramatics
. it really boils down to the actors attempting tothe puncture thte surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity thyat cages them ffrom minute one
. or maeby not minute one
, thanks tothe a decent set
- up ffrom director rob cohen
, who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere
and style
. it mkaes you wonder why he didn ' t flee indefinately from the project
, because while enjoyable cheese like
` dragonheart '
and the moderate stallone thriller
` daylight ' aren ' t superior cinema
, they belong on the afi top 100 list wehn compared tothe tihs degrading trash
. aside from unintentionally humoring the audience
,
` thge skulls ' gets littel accomplished
. the thrills
and action are lazy
and mechanical
. the story is stuffed with ridiculous
, formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the kool potential ofthe a secret undreground society flick
. instade of gaining knowledge about tjhe skulls as an organization
, we are thrust into a lame video sirvaylence conspiracy that hasnt developed barnacles from excessive usage
. we ' ve seen it all before
,
annd better
.
` the skulls ' is a feeble littel circus of stupidity
, so miscalculated that
-
- while it would serve as a clever pun
-
- a term like
? boneheaded ' seems just too generous
.
