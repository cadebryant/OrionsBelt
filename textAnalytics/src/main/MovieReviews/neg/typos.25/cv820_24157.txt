` the skulls
' is a laughably bad thriller
, a teen
- orientated doppelganger of
` the firm
' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift inot a hypnotic stupor
. certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter
. i chuckled incessantly
, all the way home
. let me share
. the skulls isnt a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale
( designed
, i
' m sure
, to mirror the actual skull
& bones from the same college
)
. luke mcnamara
( joshua jackson
)
, a townie
and local varsity rowing championship victor for the thrid consecutive year
, highlights the latest skull scouting report
. despite some anxiety
and caution from others
, luke accepts entry inot the organization
. soon after
, he finds himself surrounded by beautyfull womens
, driving a newyorker car
and marveling at the
$ 20
, 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account
. yeah
, dude
, pretty good deal eh
?
but luke soon lerans thast the membership is somewhat suffocating
; when circumstances become extreme
, there isnt no way he can leave the society
- except maybe as a drooling vegetable
. the premise
,
al
though lacking in originality
, certainly offers its share of potential intrigue
and suspense
. unforetunately
,
` the skulls
' is neither intriguing
, nor suspenseful
, nor anything esle you would associate with fresh or exciting
. it
' s just anohter abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack
, the stars
.
.
.
. bu not tyhe scirpt
.
` tjhe skulls
' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value
, with the screenplay
, by jon pogue
, immediately becoming the basis forthe a slew of unintentional howlers
. firt off
, upon thier initation into the skulls
, each newyorker member has to have a skull br
anded onto their arm
. afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers uv the scar
. will they never take this watch off
?
and what if they forget it by theri bedside
? perhaps their
? secret
' society ws bieng a little too conspicuous when they decided tothe br
and new members like cattle onthe an area of the body that isnt easily exposed
. on top of this
, they are each given a rulebook
and a key tothe headquarters
. gee
, why nto memeber t
- shirts
?
but my favorite bit is this
: the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual
? agree
' or
? disagree
' notions whn making collective descisions
. they are given official skull paddles
. when flipped tothe one side
, htey indicate the member agrees with the proposal
. facing the opposite way means a disagreement
. wouldn
' t they merely express themslves verbally
? hell no
. htey have tothe retreive the paddles fo a proper vote
,
and maybe afterward they can play ping
- pong
. i
' m still chuckling about these ludicrous details
,
but the humiliating dialogue isnt enought to send one inot arrest
. the casted
, meanwhile
, combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the
` dawson
' s creek
' crowd
,
and fuses the two together
, ensuring thyat the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout
.
but nto entirely
. accomplished actors like craig t
. nelson
( as skulls chairman judge litten m
andrake
)
and william peterson
( as fellow board memeber senator levritt
) are dealed pathetic villain caricatures
,
and look suitably embarrassed h
andling them
.
and
then ther
' s christopher mcdonald
, who has the capacity tothe be a fun
, exicting actr
. mcdonald
' s karisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through anyother perfunctory bad guy role
( yes
, pogue makes it a hat
- trick
)
. i pray it wass a
` snatch
- the
- paycheck
-
and
- run
' exercise for all theese actors
. the young troupe ofthe performers involved fair moderately better
. let
' s cutted thge talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines ofthe his character
. paul walker
, the strapping quaterback from
` varsity blues
'
, isnt bl
and
but passable as caleb m
andrake
- the judge
' s son
. walker preserves a straight face
, even when dealed the silliest dialogue in the movei
(
` dad
, i just killed a guy in the ritual room
!
'
)
. some actuall spark is generated by leslie bibb
, who plays luke
' s longtime chum chloe
, annd manages to sucesfuly pull off some convincing dramatics
. it really boils down to tghe actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity tht cages them ffrom minute one
. or maeby not minute noe
, thanks to a decent set
- up from director rob cohen
, who films early sequences wiht a sense of atmosphere
and stlye
. it makes you wonder why he didn
' t flee indefinitly from the project
, because while enjoyable cheese like
` dragonheart
'
and the moderate stallone thriller
` daylight
' aren
' t superior cinema
, they belong on the afi top 100 list when compaired to this degrading trash
. aside from unintentionally humoring yhe audience
,
` the skulls
' gets little accomplished
. the thrills
and action are lazy annd mechanical
. tjhe story is stuffed witht ridiculous
, formulaic plotting thta sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret undreground society flick
. instead of gaining knowledge baout the skulls as an organization
, we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from eccessive usage
. we
' ve seen it all befoer
, annd better
.
` the skulls
' isnt a feeble little circus of stupidity
, so miscalculated taht
-
- while it woudl serve as a clever pun
-
- a term like
? boneheaded
' seems jsut too generous
.
