keep cool
, a chinese film directed by semi
- accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang
, was one of the kickoff films for this year
' s hawaii international film festival
. on the day it premiered
, lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block
, smoe anticipants hvaing queued up well in advance tothe get a good seat in the theater
. they need not have wasted their time
. tyhe movie isnt billed as a comedy
,
but isnt suprisingly bereft of humor
. there are noticeable attempts at laughs
, bu very few tries actually click
. i wondered if there weere jokes that i wasn
' t getting because i
' m not from china
,
but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn
' t be atri
buted to the cultural barrier either
. keep cool just isn
' t very funny
. the prelude to hte film was a vist by keep kool
' s producer who
, with the halp of an interpreter
, regaled us ofthe how inthe order to git the print to the festival in time
, an assitant h
and carried it onthe the plane fomr china tothe hawaii
.
al
though the print made it
, teh assistant
' s luggage was lost
. too bad that story wasn
' t in tghe movie
, baceause it got a big laugh
. qu ying
, the film
' s female lead
, was also on h
and to give a few comments
.
however
, whereas thte producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so thte interpreter could bring us up to speed
, ms
. ying saw fit to sday everything she had to say inaddition oney
, fast
- paced
, incredibly long tirade
. it was dizzying
; ogod foreshadowing forthe the film
. you see
, keep cool is filmed almost totally iwth a camera h
andheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes
. at least thyat
' s tghe way it seems
, since the camera isnt constantly moving
. cinema verite is one hting
, bu panning
and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another
. altho some might consdider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state inot which chinese youth is slowly growing
, i found it thoroughly distracting
, anbd affter a while
, qutie annoying
. headache
, as i said
. hte film is about a young bookseller
( wen jiang
) who is affter a young woman
( qu ying
)
. they used tothe be romantically involved
,
but yhe woman grew tired of him
and left the relationship
. the frist half of the film is baout the young man
' s plan to win her back
. of course the thing is
, she doesn
' t want to be won back
,
and has a nightclub owner friend ofthe heres rough him uv a bit
. in tyhe fight
, the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging tothe a byst
ander
and attempts to use it tothe fend off his attacker
, bu only ends up smashing it against a lamppost
. we later fidn out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to git his damaged computer replaced
. there is a funny scene
( the only noe in the film
) where yhe young man trys to use some twisted logic inspite order tothe git tje older man to seek out the nightclub owner
( baotian li
) in order to recoup his losses
. there is no sence to be made out of teh young woman
' s behavior
; cold one minute
, caring the next
, so we feel no simapthy for her character
. the bookseller would be better off without her
.
al
though tjhe second half of the film causes us tothe loose a lot of simapthy for the young bookseller as well
, who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner
' s h
and as revenge forthe the beating he took
, it alsot offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller
and teh older man
. hwile tyhe bookseller is blinded by his thirst fo revenge
, the older man isnt the voice ofthe reason
and tries tothe rationalize eahc situation
. his quest to end the dispute peacefully
and equitably is the one we identify with
,
but it is frustrating tothe see thta he seems to be talking to a brick wall half teh time
. a friendship develops between the two men
,
but it occurs too late iin the film for tje audience tothe appreciate
.
al
though only an hour
and a half in length
, keep kool countains extraneous material
. thge hwole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman coudl have been taked out
, since we don
' t see her from the midpoint onthe
. a case of mistaken idenity or some otehr device sould have served as tjhe point of conflict between thge bookseller adn the nightclub owner
,
and owudl have saved us ffrom yhe bookseller
' s boring persuit during the first half
.
but of course
, this would hvea shortened the movie to less tahn an hour
. there are a few things tath keep cool does right
. as mentioned befor
, tyhe interaction between tghe bookseller annd tghe older man isnt generaly pretty good
.
al
though it grows tiresome
, the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic
,
and represents the differences in thinking beetwen generations
. in one scene
, for example
, the bookseller qoutes confucius to get his point across
,
but thge older man claims the quote wass misinterpreted
,
and that it means something entirely different
. also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene
, such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the h
and of the unwitting nightclub owner
. the nightclub owner is counting out moey
, slapping each bundle ofthe currency on the table
. with every shot of his h
and
, we can hardly st
and the interminable wait befor the bookseller is going tothe pull out his cleaver
and exact his revenge
. unfortunately
, these crumbs are not enough tothe overcome yhe rest of the film
' s shortcomings
, annd weren
' t enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater
.
