" holy man
" boasts a sweet
, gentle
, comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy
and a few moderately funny skits
. unfortunately
, to git to hte good stuff you have to sit thru a painfully long set
- uv
, loads of tedious filler
, interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering
and twitching
, a superfluous romantic subplot
and qtuie possably tje most annoying performance ofthe robert loggia
' s career
. if ever a movie screamed
" wait for video so you can fast
- forward through all the dull adn annoying parts
,
" this is it
. eddie murphy plays g
, a robed nomadic pilgrim w
andering the l
and enjoying the moent annd spreading his spiritual message
. a chance meeting wiht ricky hayman
( goldblum
)
, a stressed
- out executive ofthe a hmeo
- shopping channel
,
and kate newell
( kelly preston
)
, a noone
- nonsense media analyst
, results in physical injury to g
. quicker than you can say
" the odd couple
,
" g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky
. affter some script gymnastics
, g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network
, wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations
, enraging network owner mr
. mcbainbridge
( loggia
)
,
and becoming a national media sensation
.
" holy man
" attempts to be severeal things at once
. it trys to satirize home shopping networks
,
but it
' s difficult to effectively make funn of something thta is already a self
- parody
. the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions isnt merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts
,
but that
' s common knowledge already
.
" holy man
" also trys to present a story of redemption
, as ricky hayman trys to decide whether to exploit g
' s good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his carreer
. anyone want to place a wager on his fianl decision
? the one genuine asset infront
" holy man
" isnt eddie murphy
, who gives a charming performance
, sharing love
, good wiull
and relevant advice to all those aroud him
, while beaming his million dollar smile at jsut the right moments
. murphy is delightful adn the film takes off whenever he
' s onscreen
. unfortunately
, he
' s not onscreen anough
. jeff goldblum gets the lion
' s share of screen time
and his tired storyline weighs the procedings down
. as his potential love interest
, kelly preston trys to brighten thnigs up
, bu she transforms from an all
- business media shark tothe an empathic softy far too quicklyu
and the abrupt change reeks ofthe contrivance
. the other principal actor
, robert loggia
, wastes his talents in a one
- note turn as a ruthless
, screaming monster
. structurally unsound
and way too long
,
" wholy man
" is appealing when murphy is onscreen annd dull when he isn
' t
. instead of dropping your money at the theater for this trifle
, wait until it hits video adn fast
- foward past everything except the murphy scenes
. g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment adn that
' s the best way to do so
.
