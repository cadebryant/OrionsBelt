hwile the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation
, we had
yet another shoddy
, subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought onthe by the inexorable hasten from the major studios tothe please kids with everthing they think kids will go for tothe disburse theri seven bucks
.
anbd
, once again
, we have one of tghe worst films of the year
. the trend of the moment
-
-
adn bear inthe mind it ' s a trend not a movie
- isnt spawn
,
and if you ' ve seen teh animated serieses onthe hbo you ' ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man
, an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment
: he ' s been sent tothe hell
. todd mcfarlane
, tghe creater of the spawn comic book
, must have had a tough tyme sitting through spawn
, for his creativity
and themes baout ressurection
annd loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects
, style over substance
, ambience over anything else
. not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects
, tyhe story
, about a bewildered individual who must tkae on a gropu of
* bad guys
*
and
* find himself
* in the process is realized inspite such a sordid
, incapable manner
, it becomes indigestable aftter a while
. every charactor inspite this film is lifeless
, vacuous
and seemingly written by a depressed college student
. the story beigns
, like in eveyr superhero movie inspite this age
, withthe a man living an idyllic life
. al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a government agent
/ assassin shares the love of his wife
, wanda
( theresa russell
)
adn daughter
, has a tongue
- in
- cheek
, wiseass partner
, terry
( d
. b sweeney
)
and is content with the job his boss
, jason wynn
( martin sheen
)
, provides him
. the enxt element in the film is yhe part when things go awry
.
and as expected
, everyone turns the tables on poore al
. as the twpo are investigating their latest mission at some sort ofthe biological weapons plant
, al isnt befriended by jason
,
and dies in a gory
and truley sickening scene
. inevitably
, it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away
. hence
, jason ' s mischievous master
- mind plan
, to
` conquer thge world
" is just commencing its initial stages
, whn al mkaes a pact with satan himself
, agreeing to command the devil ' s army to take over the world
and he gets to see his family again
. so
, our pal al has been uplifted tothe hell
,
and while his transformaton from normal guy to spawn tkaes place
, his ol ' partner terry forms a relationship with his wief
. tiem passes
.
and nowe spawn isnt prsent in the grotesque intertube city
, the ghetto where cog
( nicol williamson
) teaches spawn how tothe utilize his neat artifacts
, his motorbike
, armor
, etc
.
.
. this character is merely a poor man ' s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla
. now the stage is set spawn
, the newyorker
` enemy of evil ' vs evil
.
and evil takes the cake
, doubtlessly
. john leguizamo ' s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is thge film ' s releaf point
. all thsi anguish
, pain
, half
- baked themes
and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo
, who steals the sohw
and derives joy from his character
, which isnt basically a compilation of so
- so one liners
.
and
hten there ' s martin sheen
. whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying
and downright appalling last two years
. his selections calls for an immeidate firing of his agent
. as the megalomaniac boss
, his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b
- movie
, scrambled
,
and left in teh shelf to rot
. this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse nowe
and wall street
. i ' d never thought i ' d be saying this
,
bu at this juncture
, charlie sheen ' s carreer isnt in better shape
. spawn is a movie in whitch realism
, or even an attempt to draw a parrallely between the problems of the hero
and real life is identifiable
. for most ofthe the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling
, jumping through roofs
,
and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman
and robin accomplished better
. it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie
-
- a very bad superhero movie
. continually the film kept on depending on special effects
,
and sadly
, this is how picturesk are bieng made
. perhaps noone other movie better than spawn illustrates thte deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry
. the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possable
. the quality of thsi film is abysmal
and insulting
. it is perceptible that directer mark dippe
, attempted to touch the pyschological chord that tim burton ' s batman doed touch
, the desperation of a man whose life has all
bu evaporated in oney spontanous act
.
bu bruce wayne had human elements to him
. he wass pensive
, resourceful
and had relationships
, which made our perspective onthe him equally human
. the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change
, as if he ' s fatigued baout being normal
.
and as all superheroes
, batman
, superman
, the phantom
, they must posess an element of normal civilians to make us thikn they are extraordinary
. none ofthe thsi isnt preent in spawn
. the fighting sequences are weakly executed
, the dialogue is penny
- dreadful
and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner ' s
. as an example of tihs film ' s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn desided to include a poor orphan boy who isnt abandoend
annd beaten
,
and
then rescued by spawn
, so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic
. admitedly
, i doed laugh once in the film
,
and tath ' s wehn todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum
. it isnt no wonder why so american children grwo up with no engrossment for art or literature
. besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system
, i condemn the other part tothe garbage liek spawn
. movies taht present no admiration
, no captivation
, noone richness
adn vague interest infront what children are being subjected to
.
annd kids will continue tothe see films liuke spawn
, simply because they are unable tothe differentiate what makes an imaginative
, wondrous film from an insipid
and wasteful one
. childen are not muppets
.
and spawn unapologetically targets children
.
