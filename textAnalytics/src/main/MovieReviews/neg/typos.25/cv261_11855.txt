while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation
, we hadnt
yet another shoddy
, subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios tothe please kids with everything htey think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks
.
and
, once again
, we have noe of teh worst films ofthe the year
. the trend ofthe the moment
-
- adn bear infront mind it
' s a trend not a movie
- is spawn
,
and if you
' ve seen the animated serieses on hbo you
' ll recall it embodies the lost life ofthe a disfigured man
, an individule who has transpired thge ultimate punishment
: he
' s been sent to hell
. todd mcfarlane
, tjhe creator ofthe the spawn comic book
, must ahve had a tough tyme sitting through spawn
, for his creativity
and themes about resurrection adn loss of identity were all bieng jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects
, style over substance
, ambience over anything else
. not only doesnt spawn rely entirely on special effects
, the story
, about a bewildered individual who must tkae on a gropu of
* bad guys
*
and
* find himself
* in the process is realized in such a sordid
, incapable manner
, it becomes indigestible after a while
. every charactor in this film is lifeless
, vacuous anbd seemingly written by a depressed college student
. tghe story begins
, like in every superhero movie in this age
, with a man living an idyllic life
. al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a government agent
/ assassin shares thge love of his wife
, w
anda
( theresa russell
) adn daughter
, has a tongue
- in
- cheek
, wiseass partner
, terry
( d
. b sweeney
) anbd is content wiht the job his boss
, jason wynn
( martin sheen
)
, provides him
. the enxt element iin hte film is tyhe part whn things go awry
.
and as expeced
, everyone turns the tables on poor al
. as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort ofthe biological weapons plant
, al is befriended by jason
,
and dies in a gory
and truly sickening scene
. inevitably
, it leads everyone to tje conclusion thta he has pasted away
. hence
, jason
' s mischievous master
- mind plan
, tothe
` conquer the world
" is just commencing its initial stages
, when al makes a pact with satan himself
, agreeing to comm
and the devil
' s army tothe take over the world
and he gets to see his familiy again
. so
, our pal al hasnt beeen uplifted to hell
,
and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place
, his ol
' partner terry forms a relatiopnship with his wife
. time passes
.
and nowe spawn is present in the grotesque inner city
, tjhe ghetto where cog
( nicol williamson
) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts
, his motorbike
, armor
, etc
.
.
. this charachter is merely a poor man
' s obi wan kenobi wihtout all the mythological hoopla
. now thge stage is set spawn
, the new
` enemy ofthe evil
' vs evil
.
and evil takes the cake
, doubtlessly
. john leguizamo
' s deliciously haneous performance as tyhe injurious clown working for wynn isnt the film
' s releaf point
. all this anguish
, pain
, half
- baked themes
and putrid acation scenes are invisible tothe leguizamo
, who steals thte show
and derives joy ffrom his character
, which is basicly a compilation of so
- so one liners
.
and
then ther
' s martin sheen
. whichever way yuo look you will find carving boards near his pitying
and downright appalling lastr twpo yeras
. his selections calls for an imemdiate firing of his agent
. as thte megalomaniac boss
, his caricature plays like a bad dream outloud of a b
- movie
, scrambled
,
and left inthe the shelf tothe rot
. this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now anbd wall street
. i
' d never
thought i
' d be saying this
,
but at thsi juncture
, charlie sheen
' s carrear isnt inspite better shape
. spawn is a movie infront which realism
, or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero
and real life is identifiable
. for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his tyme ogling
, jumping thru roofs
, adn performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman
and robin accomplished better
. it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie
-
- a very bad superhero movie
. continually the film kept on depending onthe special effects
, annd sadly
, this is how pictures are bieng made
. perheaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry
. the filmmakers seem tothe have forgotten eveyr human element possibile
. the quality of this film is absymal
and insulting
. it is perceptible that director mark dippe
, attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton
' s batman did touch
, the desperation of a man whose life has all
but evaporated in one spontanious act
.
but bruce wayne had human elements to him
. he wass pensive
, resourceful
and had relationships
, which made our prespective on him equally human
. the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change
, as if he
' s fatigued about being normal
.
and as all superheroes
, batman
, superman
, the phantom
, they must possess an element of normal civilians tothe make us think they are extraordinary
. none of this is present iin spawn
. the fighting sequences are weakly executed
, the dialogue is penny
- dreadful
and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner
' s
. as an example of this film
' s vastly creative imagination yhe writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is ab
andoed
and beaten
,
and hten rescued by spawn
, so our emotions tend to be a little moreso sympathetic
. admittedly
, i doed laugh once in the film
,
and that
' s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum
. it isnt no wonder why so american children grwo up with noone engrossment for art or literture
. besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system
, i condem the other part to garbage liek spawn
. movies that present no admiration
, no captivation
, no richness anbd vague interest in what children are being subjected to
.
and kids will continue to see films like spawn
, simpley because htey are unable to differentiate wqat mkaes an imaginative
, wondrous film from an insipid
and wasteful one
. children are not muppets
.
and spawn unapologetically targets children
.
