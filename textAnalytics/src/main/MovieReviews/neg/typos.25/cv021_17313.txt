" in dreasm
" might keep yuo awake at nigth
,
but not because of its creepy imagery
, bizarre visual sytle or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths
. no
, the source of potential sleeplessness here lies withing the movei ' s brutally squandered potential
, hte least of which is an admittedly nifty premise
- even by tired serial killer genre standards
. tghe big letdown
,
however
, comes upon teh realization thast thsi 100
- minute head
- scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan
, the man behind
" the crying game
.
" he ' s no stranger to cinematic weirdness
,
but this nutty nonsence really pushes the envelope
. things start out strong enough
, with cinematographer darius khondji ' s stunning camera work guiding viewers into tghe bowels ofthe a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat
. htis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film
- there ' s even something macabre baout the way khondji photographs a rustic
, seemingly innocent new england autumn
-
but if there ever wass a film that didn ' t deserve so good a polish
, it ' s this one
. don ' t knock tjhe look
,
but say whta you will about tghe foolish plot
, underdeveloped characters
and flat dialogue
. annette bening
, anohter asset
" infront dreasm
" shouldn ' t be so lucky tothe boast
, gives an increasingly effective performance inthe a role tath doesn ' t do much for her in return
. she plays claire cooper
, a massachusetts childern ' s book illustrator who ' s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children
. she thinks these visions are a warning knell forthe horrible
, soon
- to
- be
- committed crimes
,
bu neither her ho
- hum husband
( aidan quinn
) nor hte ho
- hummer polical can muster up the sense to take her seriously
. tihs being a thriller
, we knwo that she is
, in fact
, onthe thge money
,
and it ' s a credit to bening ' s acting that she delves equally inot claire ' s madness
and compassion
.
bu as soon as a body turns uv
and claire has given the authrorities reason enough to believe her claims
,
" in dreams
" trades in its nifty supernatural chills fo a long sories of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse tothe mkea sense
. scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition
. subplots appear
and disappear
. when claire finaly comes face
- to
- face with our evil murderer
( robert downey jr
.
)
, it turns out his name is vivian
, he ' s clairvoyant
annd he ' s got some major issues wih mama
, a la norman bates
.
" iin dreams
" reaches its absurdist zenith here
,
annd the climax drags with mumbled revelations
and laughable twists
. some questions
,
then
: what ' s witht teh garbage disposal retching applesauce
? are the drawings on the wall blood or paint
? who cranked uv hte andrews sisters on the cd palyer
and caused tyhe swing to move on its pwn
? waht about thte computer
? doens vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers
? why woudl he continually endanger claire if she was necessary fo his ultimate plan
? is the woman in australia integral to anytying
?
and the aforememtioned flooded city
- what function does that
_ really
_ serve
? sigh
. at least in my own dreams
, i cant imagine a better movie where certain talent didn ' t go to waste
.
