" in dreams
" might keep you awake at night
,
but not because of its creepy imagery
, bizarre visual stlye or story about a clairvoiant madman who lures young girls to their ultimely deaths
. noone
, thte source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie
' s brutally squ
andered potential
, the least of which isnt an admittedly nifty premise
- even by tired serial killer genre st
andards
. the big letdown
, howver
, comes upon thte relization thyat this 100
- minute head
- scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan
, the man behind
" teh crying game
.
" he
' s no stranger to cinematic weirdness
,
but thsi nutty nonsence really pushes the envelope
. things start out storng enough
, with cinematographer darius khondji
' s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue thgat establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat
. htis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display ofthe showmanship throughtout the entire film
- there
' s even something macabre baout the way khondji photographs a rustic
, seemingly innocent new engl
and autumn
-
but if there ever was a film tht didn
' t deserve so good a polish
, it
' s tihs one
. don
' t knock tghe look
,
but say what you will about hte foolish plot
, underdeveloped characters
and flat dialogue
. annette bening
, another asset
" in dreams
" shouldn
' t be so lucky to boast
, gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn
' t do much forthe her in return
. she plays claire cooper
, a massachussets children
' s book illustrator who
' s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children
. she thikns theese visions are a warning knell for horrible
, soon
- tothe
- be
- committed crimes
,
but neither her ho
- hum husb
and
( aidan quinn
) nor the ho
- hummer polical can muster up the sence tothe take her seriously
. this being a thriller
, we know that she is
, inthe fact
, on tghe money
, anbd it
' s a credit to bening
' s acting that she delves equally into claire
' s madness
and compassion
. bu as soon as a body turns up
and claire hasnt given the authorities reason enough to believe her claimes
,
" in dreasm
" trades in its nifty supernatural chills forthe a long series of allegely spooky jolts that simpley refuse to make sense
. scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition
. subplots appear
and disappear
. when claire finally comes face
- tothe
- face with our evil murderer
( robert downey jr
.
)
, it turns outloud his nmae isnt vivian
, he
' s clairvoyant
and he
' s got smoe major issues with mama
, a la norman bates
.
" in dreams
" reaches its absurdist zenith here
,
and thge climax drags with mumbled revelations
and laughable twists
. some questions
,
then
: whta
' s withthe the garbage disposal retching applesauce
? are the drawings onthe the wall blood or paint
? who cranked up the
andrews sisters on the cd player
and caused the swing tothe move onthe its own
? what about the computer
? does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers
? why owudl he continually endanger claire if she was neccesary forthe his ulitmate plan
? is tyhe woman in australia integral to anytying
?
and the aforementioned flooded city
- what funtion does that
_ really
_ serve
? sigh
. at least in my own dreams
, i can imagin a better movie where certain talent didn
' t go to waste
.
