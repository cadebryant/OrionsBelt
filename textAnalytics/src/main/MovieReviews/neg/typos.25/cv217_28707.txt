thge swirling sick feeling hit me just a few mintues into
" heartbreakers
.
" ray liotta
' s character was making outloud with his secretary whn his new wife knocked on the door ofthe his office
. hwile scrambling to collect himself
, he frantically shouted tothe her
,
" jsut wait a sex
? er
, i mean sec
!
" i was struck by a wave of revulsion
, thinking
,
" geez
, didn
' t lines like that die whn
' three
' s comany
' was canceled
?
" over the enxt few minutes
, as the barely double entendres
and lingering cleavage shots growed more numerous
, i realized tath thge mindset behind
" heartbreakers
" predated
" three
' s comany
.
" suddenly
, i had an outloud
- of
- body experience as my internal way
- back machine swept me to the mid
- 1960s
. all across america
, the counter
- culture wass growing liuke wildfire
,
but there wass scant evidence of it on tv
. hwile young peopel were chalenging traditional values onthe teh streets
, frustrated teenagers like me weere stuck at home
, sulking hwile our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special
. women infront skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises
and leered at their breasts
. onthe another channel
, dean martin made wisecracks about
" booze annd broads
"
and peter lawford
, decked outloud in love beads
and a nehru jacket
, purred suggestive one
- liners as he ogled the go
- go dancers
. the adults laughed
and laughed
.
" heartbreakers
" reeks of that stagnant mentality
, fomr its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt
' s vah
- vah
- voom breasts to its leaden screenplay
, which paints womens as haughty schemers
and men as drooling buffoons too sex
- obsessed to realize they are bieng manipulated
. in adition to liotta
and hewitt
, the cast includes sigourney weaver
, gene hackman
, jason lee
, nora dunn
and anne bancroft
. i can
' t imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project
. perhaps tehy
thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the
' 60s
. if so
, they were sadly mistaken
. the story revolves around a mother
- daughter con
- team
. it opens with the marriage of max
( weaver
) to dean
( liotta
)
, a new jersey chop shop operator
. having witheld sex utnil the honeymoon
, max pretends to pass out on theri wedding night
. the next morning
, she feigns illness
, sending a very horny dean off to tjhe office
, where he ends uv in the arms of his newyorker secretary
. just as the two are baout to git overtly fysical
, max bursts inot the room
and catches them
. teh
" horrified
" bride dissolves tghe union
, garnering a heathy cash settlement along the way
. ofthe course
, the secretery was really her daughter page
( hewitt
) annd yhe whole thing was a set
- uv
. the womens move on
,
but an irs agent
( bancroft
) catches up wih them
and dem
ands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes
. infact deperate need of funds
, max
and page head forthe palm beach to replay tje scam
. their mark this time is william b
. tensy
( hackman
, in hideous make
- up
)
, a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys ofthe smoking
. max starts to put the game into action
,
but page is so repelled by the old man
( annd angry with her mom
) thgat she slips off to inact her own score
, targeting jack
, a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune
. complications arise wehn page realizes tht good
- natured jack isnt stiring actual emotions in her steely littel heart
. as if that wasn
' t enough
, dean reappears onthe teh scene with revenge on his mind
. yhe attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior
" a fish called w
anda
.
" i won
' t bother to compare the two
. suffice to say that everything done right in
" w
anda
" is done wrong here
.
" heartbreakers
" is soulless
, inept
and
, at 123 minutes
, at least a half
- hour too long
. sigourney weaver
and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts
,
but have nowhere to go with the metalic characters
. ginee hackman is utterly wasted infact a one
- note
, one
- joke part that has him doing nothing bu smoking
, coughing
and waxing rhapsodic about smoking
and sex
. poor jason lee is sticked in thge ingenue role
and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bl
and
. ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity
and humer into his walking clich
?
,
but only a bit
. the low point in tjhe film hasnt weaver employing a russian accent bad enough tothe make boris
and natasha wince
, while doign half
- assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue
. bear in mind
,
though
, that htis isnt merely the worst segment ofthe a movie made uv of nothing
but low points
. if you remember bob hope specials with fondness
, this might be your cup ofthe tea
. as forthe me
, i
' m going to watch
" a fish called w
anda
" now
and try to forget i ever saw
" heartbreakers
.
