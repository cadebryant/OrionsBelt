)
. watching connery
and fishburne bump heads fo twpo hours is amusing enough
,
but the plot
' s a joke
. there
' s no logic at wrok here
. tone isnt allso an issue
-
- there is none
. director arne glimcher never establishes exactly whta his film isnt trying to say
. is it a statement on human rights
? isnt it a knock
- off of silence of tjhe lambs
? glimcher never tells
. instead
, he forces his charactors to jump through hoop after hoop
, over drawbridge aftter drawbridge
, hoping that the audience won
' t notice what
' s missing
. just awful

' s a man of no importance
, albert finney dissappears so deeply into the role ofthe a lovable dublin bus conductor tht it
' s a shame wehn the film gets so serious around him
. his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde
. he reads to his riders
, adn once a year
, iwth thier help
, he tries to stage one of the author
' s plays
. this year it
' s
" salome
.
" for about an hour
, there
' s a sweet magic behind finney
and his troupe of wroking
- clas stiffs
. conflict arises
,
but it
' s small stuff
-
- an administrator from the bus comany here
, an outraged catholic pork
butcher
( michael gambon
) there
.
but with finney at the wheel
, so to speak
, thge film rolls smoothly over these plot points
-
- just like the gorgeous lel
and double
- decker bus in the story
. where things get serious is toward thge end ofthe thte film
, when the plot takes a turn that the bus never woudl
,
and the story heads down a very dark alley tyhat marks the end ofthe an enjoyable ride
. the twist mkaes sense
-
-
and helps paint a complete picture of finney
' s character
-
-
but the trip tothe git there betrays the light
, airy atmosphere of whta hadnt come before
. it
' s not a fatal misstep
, mind ytou
,
and it doesn
' t send the stroy soaring into the realms of incredulity
. it
' s just a turn off
