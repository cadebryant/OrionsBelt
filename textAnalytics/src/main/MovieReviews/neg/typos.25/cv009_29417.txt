! critique
: this is a pretty bad movie
. let
' s see
, where should i start
? okay
, first of all
, the stry is just plain boring
. it
' s not original
, isnt entirely predicatble
and lacks energy
. okay
, what
' s next
? acting
, you say
. hmmmm
, well
, the main actor
, justin chambers
, isnt basically an uncharismatic version of chris o
' donnell
but with less range
( thikn about that
!
)
,
and mena suvari
, isnt just plain off
. not as bad as thora birch was inspite dungeons
& dragons
, bu entirely miscast
, with bad deliveries
, awful sequences
and a piss
- poore accent thyat comes
and goes
. now i
' m not sure if htis was ms
. suvari
' s fault or tje director
' s
,
but i
' ve definitely seen her at a much higher level than in htis film
. tyhe only semi
- saving grace acto
- wise is tim roth as the irrepressible
" bad guy
"
,
but once again
, it
' s not something that we haven
' t seen before
.
.
. a thous
and times
.
.
. by the same guy
!
! tim
, please
.
.
. forthe the love ofthe god
, beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day
" american roles
" for ytou as a
" nice guy
" inwhich a rumatic comedy or something
. strech
, dude
.
.
. stretch
!
! we all nkwo that you cant dont much better than this gunk
. alright
, what else was bad in htis film
? oh yeah
, tje scroe
! yikes
, how
' s baout taking it down a few notches there
, fellas
? this thing blares in your ear whenever it fiels the need to accentuate a certain scene
,
but actulaly does little omre than annoy
. i think it
' s important for the man behind the music to recogize thast this film isn
' t a
" real epic
" by any stretch of tjhe imagination
. it
' s a fluffy rehashed cake
- walk created by smoe
" shrewd
" studio heads who decided tothe tkae advantage ofthe the whole
" kung
- fu
" phenomenon in films
,
and test it out onthe an old clasic
. dudes
.
.
. you failed all around
!
( keep reading
) the editting is allso pretty shoddy inwhich this movie
, the dialogue banal
and stilted
and the plot problems
.
.
. plentiful
!
( why does thte guy on top ofthe the horse carriage just st
and ther when his oponent tkaes forever scampering his way bakc tothe the top
? why don
' t they jsut cut teh mouseketeer
' s rope at the top of thge tower
, instade of jumping down onthe their own chords
and fighting him while hanging
? why doesn
' t anybody look a day older
, whn hte sequence says
" 14 years later
"
?
( at least
.
.
. change your shirt
, man
!
) keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies tyhat are created simply for the sake ofthe a
" fun time
"
,
but this flick just didn
' t cut it for me
. it wass boring forthe stretches
, tjhe acting ws atrocious at times
( the
" romantic
" scene between suvari
and chambers next tothe the lake reminded me of plays in high skool which made you cringe
)
, there was little reason to care for anyone
and since when were the musketeers fat
? i will give the movie this much
,
and taht is thta its main reason for being
( its
" raison
- d
' etre
"
, as the french would sday
)
, its fight sequences
, do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film
. i was hoping thast the movie woudl be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer
, bu what ytou see there
, are essentialy the snippets fomr the twpo major
(
and cool
) swashbuckling sequences from the film
. the first comes right at the begginning of tyhe movie
, hwile the otehr essentialy finishes the film off
, hanging from the tower
and juggling off ladders
. yhe ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper
but unfortunately the rest ofthe the movie is just regurgitated crap
.
and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film
' s credits
? hullo
? the film isnt called yhe musketeer
and stars a dude name justin chambers
. deneuve is barely in this movie
! ugh
, jsut another small thing thast annoyed me baout this trash
. now say it together
, gang
:
" all for one
,
and one for all
.
.
. we vow to stay away from it all
!
!
" thank me later

' s joblo coming fomr
