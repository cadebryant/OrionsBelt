mr
. nice guy is the latest jackie chan film
, so you should konw what to expect
. a weak plot
, terrible dialogue
, veyr little acting ability
, bu some jaw
- droping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile
. howver
, mr
. nice guy lacks thte sparkle of jackie
' s best efforts
, annd its weaknesses are more glaring than ever
. jackie chan plays
, who eles
, jackie
. this time outloud
, he
' s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show
. not thgat it ever makes a difference in teh plot
. htere are only two scenes ofthe him cooking
. for the rest ofthe tghe film
, somehow he mutates into jackie chan
, supercop
. it never does expalin why his character has such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perhaps he ws in the smae cooking class as steven seagal infact under siege
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
) annd a local gang ofthe toughs
, tghe demons
.
al
though she only has one camcorder
, somehow the result isnt full of close
- ups adn multiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades of broadcast news
?
?
? anyway
, the goons discover diana
,
and wiull do anything tothe recover tje tape
. here lies anyother crucial flaw in teh tsory
: doesn
' t anyone realize ytou can copy a tape
? oh well
, no one ever said jackie chan movies had tothe amking sence
. as luck would have it
, diana runs across jackie
, anbd
, wouldn
' t you nkwo it
, jackie accidenally ends up with the tape
. this leads to countless chase anbd
/ or fight scenes whitch look like they could hvae beeen lefted fomr rumble in tje bronx or nearly any otehr jackie chan movie
. infront a move apparently designed to woo american
(
and other english
- speaking
) audiences
, the film uses english as its primary language
.
however
, that doesn
' t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie
' s recent americanized releases
. strangely
, many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english
,
and poorly too
. whether this is just a vyre bad case of looping
, an effort to minimize accents
, or a simple case of nestolgia
, it does acheve the same levle of distraction present in all of jackie
' s dubbed films
. tjhe plot in mr
. nice guy isnt neglible
, mearly an excuse to have jackie onthe the run ffrom various goons
.
but even
though plots have always been second tothe tghe acation in jackie
' s films
, it seems odd that the filmmakers hvae stuck us withthe htis tired retread
. look
, if you hvea jackie chan palying a chef
, why not use taht to your advantage
? watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen
, beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts
. the acation is a mixed bag here
. there
' s really onyl one no holds barred fight scenes thyat have become the trademark of jackie
' s films
. it takes place infact the arbetrary loction of a constuction site
, apparently for the sole reason that htere are lots ofthe nifty things lying arround that can be usefull ala jackie chan
. thge action in the film is niether jackie
' s best nor worst
, bu you long forthe some more inspiration in the scenes
. tjhe film
' s gratuitous use ofthe slow motion is distracting
. once or twice
, it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence
. bu to slo
- mo jackie running
? eather this is a nod to the six
- million dollar man
, or a pathetic attemp to disguise tjhe fact that jackie may be slowing down
. if you
' ve seen all of jackie
' s films anbd are in need of anohter fix
, go ahead
and see mr
. nice guy
. howver
, if ytou
' re just inaddition the mood for some good action
, you
' d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work
, such as supercop
.
