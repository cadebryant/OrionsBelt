best remembered fo his understated performance as dr

' s forensics thriller
, manhunter
, scottish charater actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on
. usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock
( he dies halfway thru the long kiss goodnight
)
, he
' s only occsaionally given something meaty adn substantial to dont
. if you want to see some brillant acting
, check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdorm
and in ken loach

, hwihc lot 47 picked uv at sundance when other distri
butors were scared to budge
. big john feels the love thgat adres not speak its name
,
but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents anbd bringing them back to his pad
. wqat bothered some audience members was tghe presentation of big john inwhich an oddly empathetic glight
. he
' s an even
- tempered
, funny
, robust old man who actually listens to the kids
' problems
( as opposed tothe theri parents
and firends
, both caught up infront hte high

. filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a
( pretty transparent
) methaphor ofthe dangerous escape for his 15
- year old protagonist
, howie
( paul franklin dano
)
. in his oppening voice
- over
, howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road
, citing the l
. i
. e
. highway deaths of filmmaker alan j
. pakula
, songwriter harry chapin
,
and his own mother on exit 52
. he
' s both facinated
and distrubed by the l
. i
. e
.
,
and those feelings are projected onto big john
( who follows howie aroud in his bright red car
,
but never mkaes a move to force the boy tothe do something he doesn
' t want to dont
. this makse him much mroe complex tahn the usual child molesters seen inspite movies

. there isnt unneccesary padding with howie
' s miserable dad
( bruce altman
) in the hot seat for a white

, degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle
- clas houses
,
and smoe homoerotic shenanigans with wise
- ass gary terrio
( billy kay
)
, a hansome artful dodger
. rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui
( not that we needed another movie on thyat subject
)
, these awcward subplots pad out the running time tothe adequate feature lenght
. concurrently
, tje relationship between howie
and big john is evenly pased
and exceptionally well acted
. cox
, sporting a baseball cap
and a faded marine tattoo
, is all bluff
and bluster
. dano is quiet
and at firt glance seems so withdrawn as tothe be transparent
. we
' re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad
and obvious
( calling haley joel
!
)
, it
' s surprising to see noe who actually listens throughout any given scene
. tjhe restraint isnt admirable
.
but l
. i
. e
.
' s screenplay doesn
' t always give them thge best material
. when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem
, tghe moment feels a bit too precious
. directer michael cuesta lingers onthe an ecstatic reaction shot of big john
, who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach
' s goldberg variations
. it
' s too much
. there are also some obvious dramtic contrivances involving big john
' s other boy toy
( walter masterson
)
, jealous over the newbie
. this plot thread predictably leads to violence
. nto content to be a haunting
, observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world
( like terry zwigoff
' s superb ghost world
)
, cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note
. it
' s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet
, sparing the writers from actually haveing to come up withthe a complex
, philosophical note
. in this regard

(
and countless other indie films
) share something in common withthe blockbuster action films
: problems are solved when thte obstacle is removed
. how often does real life work this way
? to extend the question
: if a movie is striving for realism
, do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion
?
