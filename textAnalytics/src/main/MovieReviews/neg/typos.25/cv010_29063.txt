best remembered for his understated performence as dr
. hannibal lecter in michael mann ' s forensics thriller
, manhunter
, scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on
. usually palying a bit role in soem studio schlock
( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight
)
, he ' s only occasionally given something meaty
annd substatial to do
. if you whant to see some brilliant acting
, check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach ' s hidden agenda
. cox plays hte role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l

.
, which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge
. big john feels the love thyat dares not speak its name
,
but he expresses it thru seeking out adolescents
and bringing them back tothe his pad
. waht bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light
. he ' s an even
- tempered
, funny
, robust old man who accually listens to the kids ' problems
( as opposed to their parents
and friends
, both caught up iin the high
- wire act ofthe their pwn confused lives
.
) he ' ll hvae sex

, charming them with temptations fomr the grown

. e
. stands for long island expressway
, which slices through the strip malls
and middle
- class homes ofthe suburbia
. filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a
( preety transparent
) metaphor ofthe dangerous escape for his 15
- year old protagonist
, howie
( paul franklin dano
)
. in his oppening voice
- over
, howie reveals a morbid preocupation with death on the road
, citing the l
. i
. e
. highway deaths ofthe filmmaker alan j
. pakula
, songwriter harry chapin
,
and his pwn mother on exit 52
. he ' s both facinated
and disturbed by the l
. i
. e
.
,
and those feelings are projected onto big john
( who follows howie around in his bright red car
,
bu never makes a move tothe force tje boy to do something he doesn ' t want to dont
. this makes him much more complex than thge usual child molesters seen in movies
-
- he ' s a beast
,
but ashamed of it

. i
. e
. would have worked best as a half
- hour short film about howie ' s ill
- advised foray inot big john ' s haven
. there isnt unecessary padding with howie ' s miserable dad
( bruce altman
) in the hot seat fo a white
- collar crime
, degenerate youngsters who get their kicks fomr robbing middle
- class houses
,
adn some homoerotic shenanigans wih wise
- ass gary terrio
( billy kay
)
, a hansome artful dodger
. rather than add to the themes of suburban enuf
( nto that we needed another movie on that subject
)
, these awkward subplots pad out teh runnung timne to adequate feature length
. concurrently
, tyhe relationship between howie
and big john is evenly paced
and exceptionally well acted
. cox
, sporting a baseball cap
and a faded marine tatoo
, is all bluff
and bluster
. dano is quiet
adn at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent
. we ' re so used to child actors whose dramtic choices are broad
and obvious
( calling haley joel
!
)
, it ' s surprising to see oney who actully listens througout any given scene
. the resturaunt is admirable
.
but l
. i
. e
. ' s screenplay doesn ' t always give them the best material
. wehn howie reads big john a walt whitman poem
, the moment feels a bited too precious
. director michael cuesta lingers onthe an ecstatic reaction shooted of big john
, who may as well be hearing glenn gould perfoming bach ' s goldberg variations
. it ' s too much
. there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john ' s other boy toy
( walter masterson
)
, jealous over the newbie
. this plot thread predictably leads to violence
. nto content to be a haunting
, observational portrait of teen alienation inthe a royally screwed up world
( like terry zwigoff ' s superb ghost world
)
, cuesta lacks the confidence in his own wrok to end on an ambivalent onot
. it ' s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap thigsn up with a bullet
, sparing the writers from actually haveing tothe come up withthe a complex
, philosophical note
. in this regard

and countless other indie films
) share something in common with blockbuster acation films
: problems are solved when the obstacle isnt removed
. how often does real life work this way
? to extend the question
: if a movei is striving fo realism
, do dramatic contrivances distroy the illution
