come on hollywood
, surprise me
. stop giving us these poorly written thrillers iwth banal dialogue
, sketchy characters annd plots as predictable as the sunset
. the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls
. personal
, because his niece is one of the victims
. it
' s a slobbering psychopath
, of course
,
but thsi time there
' s a twist
. freeman notes tath earch of the young women who
' ve disappeared are all strong willed
, assertive
,
and more successful in their careers tahn the average girl
. we soon leran that the guy calls himself casanova
, whose aim is tothe
" dominate
" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon
and keeping them as his personal harem
. anyway
, one of the women manages to escape
( ashly judd
)
and teams up wtih freeman to
.
.
. well
, yuo know the rest
. a brief glance at the plot to silence of thge lambs
, with which this film is constanly being compared to by the hype merchants
, may suggest lambs also has a fairly predicatble story
. perhaps
,
but that film alsot has superbly drawn characters
and smart dialogue
. so lets not insult a gerat movie by taking the comparisons any futher
, okay
?
and as fo comparisons to seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss tghe girls is based on the novel by james patterson
and written for the screen by one david klass
. maybe teh novel was a stinker tothe start with
,
but whatever the case
, it
' s the writing taht
' s clearly at fault here
. one
, theese characters have very little to say tyhat
' s engaging or interesting
. two
, the script has noone sense of humour
. three
, while the notion of a psycho
' s victims being smart
, successful women isnt an interesting twist
, the execution isn
' t even half as good as the idea
. thus
, ashly judd comes across all out of focus
, instead of being hte heart ofthe teh sotry
. we can
' t feel her rige
. soem atrociously written casual exchanges between her annd several male characters are supposed tothe remind us that she
' s thte no
- bullshit 90
' s type
,
but these conversations bearly register
. anbd as for freeman
, kiss the girls isnt his second dog in a year
: first chain reaction
, now this
. for an actor of his calibre
, this is most worrying
. young director gary fleder scored a hit a faw years back with his quirky pulp fiction
- esque thigsn to dont in denver when your dead
.
but what can he do wtih material as resolutely mediocre as this
? nto much
,
and you can hardly blaim him
. ther
' s a few well
- staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls
, dives adn jumps
,
and the effect isnt startling
.
but the scirpt is beyond rescue
. what hurts most isnt that hollywood continues to get away with serving up thsi tripe
, safe in the knowledge thast jaded audiences will lap it uv
. complacency rules
: it
' s beeen so long usance we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters
, real surprises
and consistently sharp dialogue
. the onyl consolation for htis viewer is that my ticket to the movei ws a freebie
, positive proof taht the best things in life aren
' t free
