come on hollywood
, surprise me
. stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue
, sketchy charachters
and plots as predicatble as the sunset
. the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls
. peronal
, because his niece is one of the victims
. it ' s a slobbering psychopath
, ofthe course
,
but tihs tiem there ' s a twist
. freeman notes that each ofthe yhe young women who ' ve disappeared are all strong willed
, assertive
,
and moreso successful in their careers than the average girl
. we soon learn taht the guy calls himself casanova
, whose aim isnt to
" dominate
" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon
and keeping them as his personal harem
. anyway
, oen of the womens manages tothe escape
( ashly judd
)
anbd teams uv with freeman to
.
.
. well
, you konw yhe rest
. a brief glance at tje plot to silence of the lambs
, with which this film is constantly being compared tothe by the hype merchants
, may suggest lambs also has a fairly predicatble story
. perhaps
,
bu that film also has superbly drawn characters
anbd smart dialogue
. so lets not insult a great movie by taking tghe comparisions any further
, okay
?
annd as for comparisions to seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss tghe girls isnt based on tyhe novel by james patterson
and writed for the screen by oney david klass
. maybe the novel ws a stinker to start with
,
but whatever the case
, it ' s the writing tyhat ' s clearly at fault here
. one
, these characters have vrey little tothe sday that ' s engaging or interesting
. two
, yhe script has noone sence of humour
. three
, while the notion of a psycho ' s victims bieng smart
, successful women is an interesting twist
, the execution isn ' t even half as good as yhe diea
. thus
, ashly judd comes accross all out of foucs
, instead of being the heart of the story
. we can ' t fiel her rage
. some atrociously written casual exchanges vetween her
adn several male cahracters are supposed to remind us that she ' s the no
- bullshit 90 ' s tipe
,
bu these conversations bearly register
.
and as for freeman
, kiss the girls is his second dog in a eyar
: first chain reaction
, now tihs
. for an actor of his calibre
, this is most worrying
. young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction
- esque things to do in denver when your dead
.
but what can he dont with material as resolutely medicore as this
? not much
,
and yuo cin hardly blame him
. there ' s a few well
- staged chase scenes through the forest where thge camera whirls
, dives
and jumps
,
and the effect is startling
.
but hte script is beyond rescue
. what hurts most is thast hollywood continues to get awya with serving up this tripe
, safe in the knowledge taht jaded audiences will lap it up
. complacency rules
: it ' s been so long sicne we saw a mainstream american thriller tht delivered juicy characters
, real surprises
anbd consistently sharp dialogue
. the onyl consolation for thsi viewer is that my ticket to the movie ws a freebie
, positive proof that teh best things inaddition life aren ' t free
.
