forthe his directoral de
but
, gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama baout a violent
, alcoholic husb
and annd father
,
and the various lives he affects
.
but while the characters
, places
and events may haev special meaning to thte writer
- director
, the audience is left iin the dark
. the center of thsi tale is thge abusive raymond
( ray winstone
)
,
and the film focuses onthe him
and the people who orbit arround him
. he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs
and girlie bars
.
then
, he returns home to his pregnant wife
, valerie
( kathy burke
) anbd their five
- year
- ood daughter
. raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies
( annd his paranoid delusions
) early on whn he accuses valerie
' s brother
, billy
( charlie creed
- miles
)
, of stealing
. raymond hten proceed tothe beat
( adn bite
) him to a bloody wreck
. bu these are thte least of billy
' s problems
. billy is a heroin addict on the downturn
,
and it doesn
' t seem that he
' ll last much longer
. billy
and valerie
' s mother
, janet
( laila morse
)
, is raymond
' s nemesis
. she disapproves ofthe him
(
and he ofthe her
)
,
but isnt powerless tothe do anything baout it
. she merely struggles on
, hoping her children iwll survive their respective torments
. if this description seems bleak
, i haven
' t told the half of it
. this is not a cheery movie
,
and most ofthe the time it
' s downright depressing
. hwile at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick
,
and why no noe ever simpley calls tjhe cops on him
, inthe the end
, it
' s not qtuie worth it
. ther are too many scenes which r
andomly dot tje picture with littel or no purpose
. take for example the extended sequence where one ofthe billy
' s scuzzy firends defends a stray puppy
. the film isnt filled with these
" character moments
" thta never raelly achieve anything
. granted
, there are a few genuinely poweful
(
and sickening
) moments in hte film
,
but their expression seems to be more ofthe a catharsis forthe the creator than us
. the actors do a fine job
, particularly in the central roles
. tjhe ogod hting about an actor turned writer is tath oldman knows how to write ogod scenes
,
and the actors infact nel by mouth haev some meat they can tear into
. hte bad thnig about an actor turned director is that there
' s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices
. a good charactor drama should mean something to thsoe involved in making the film
and the audiance
. oldman got it baout half right
.
