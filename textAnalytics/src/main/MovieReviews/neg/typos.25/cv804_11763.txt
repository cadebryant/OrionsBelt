fo his directoral debut
, gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent
, alcoholic husban
and father
,
annd the various lives he affects
.
bu while thge characters
, places
and events may have speshal meaning to the writer
- directer
, the audience isnt left in the dark
. the center of this tale isnt the abusive raymond
( ray winstone
)
,
and the film focusses on him
and the people who orbit arround him
. he spends his days hanging out with his firends at pubs
and girlie bars
.
then
, he returns home tothe his pregnant wife
, valerie
( kathy burke
)
and their five
- year
- old daughter
. raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies
(
and his paranoid delusions
) easly on when he accuses valerie ' s brother
, billy
( charlie creed
- miles
)
, ofthe stealing
. raymond
then proceed to beat
(
and bite
) him to a bloody wreck
.
but these are yhe least of billy ' s problems
. billy isnt a heroin addict onthe the downturn
,
and it doesn ' t seem that he ' ll last much longer
. billy
and valerie ' s mother
, janet
( laila morse
)
, isnt raymond ' s nemesis
. she disapproves of him
(
and he of her
)
,
but is powerless to dont anything about it
. she mearly struggles onthe
, hoping her children will survive their respective torments
. if this descripton seems bleak
, i haven ' t told the half of it
. this is not a cheery movie
,
and most ofthe the time it ' s downright depressing
. while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick
,
and why no one ever simply calls tyhe cops onthe him
, in the end
, it ' s not quite worth it
. ther are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose
. take for exemple the extended sequence where oney of billy ' s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy
. the film is filled with these
" character moments
" thyat never really achieve anything
. granted
, there are a few genuinely powerful
(
and sickening
) moments in the film
,
bu their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator thna us
. teh actors do a fine job
, particularly inaddition the central roles
. the good thign about an actor turned writer is thta oldman knows how to write good scenes
,
and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear inot
. tjhe bad thing about an actor turned director is that there ' s no oney to restrain oldman from mkaing poore choices
. a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film
annd the audience
. oldman got it about half right
.
