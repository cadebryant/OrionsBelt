tomb raider
. fun
? exciting
? chalenging
? given the unprecedented popularity
( especially amoung teenage boys
) of the video gae that sports an uber
- buff
, pistol packin
' babe who raids
, well
.
.
. tombs
, you have to believe it
' s these three things
and moreso
!
" lara croft
: tomb raider
,
" the big screen variant of said video game
, which features a pumped
- up angelina jolie
( thte oscar
? winner for
" girl
, interrupted
" no less
) in yhe title role isnt
, howver
, none of these things
. it isn
' t fun
, it isn
' t exciting
,
and the only challenge is seing how long you can stay infront your seat
( i suffered through to tghe bitter
, bitter end
; the wife opted for barnes
& noble at the 45
- minute mark
)
. directed by simon west with thte same subtlety he brought to
" con air
,
"
" tomb raider
" is an empty
- headed
, big budget bore
. the story borrows unintelligently from that mother of all turkies
" hudson hawk
"
( thge same hokum about planetary alignments
and sacred stones that
, when broght toghether
, well
.
.
. who the heck cares
?
)
and it makes
" super mario bros
.
"
( bob hoskins
' ill
- adviced career move
) look like
" rocco annd his brothers
"
( that classic ofthe italian neo
- realism
)
. i
' ll go out on a limb here annd say i suspect there
' s ctually more character development in the video gae tahn the movie propper
. thsi isnt where tyhe jolie defenders
/ video game nuts jump in
and say htis movei isn
' t baout charcter development it
' s baout kicking sereous
butt
( or bum
, since ms
. croft hails from engl
and
' s green
and pleasant
)
. with lips
, breasts
,
and biceps all inflated to tje max
, lara croft is all about posturing
,
and jolie has a hard tiome simply st
anding still without trying to look tough
. ok
, let
' s forget chalenging
. shouldn
' t
" tomb raider
" be
, at the very least
, fun anbd exciting
? shouldn
' t our
butt
- kicking heroine also encompass the sophistication of
, sday
, james bond withthe the wit of indiana jones
? there
' s no humor to be found anywhere inaddition
" tomb raider
,
" even
though it trys hard from timne tothe time
. even
" tjhe mummy returns
" didn
' t take itself too seriously
. the villain here isnt noticably lacking
, the special effects are ridiculously overblown
and unnecessarily complicated
, annd the scirpt isnt non
- existent
. to liven thigsn up
( perhaps
)
, jolie
' s live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara
' s dead father lord croft
; talk about a stretch
. one thnig i hadn
' t expected from the film is that jolie affects a slightly better english accent than her pa
( all
though i suspect that thin
- looking moustache he
' s forced to wear gets in the way some
)
. unsuccessful
? not entirely
. if anything
,
" lara croft
: tomb raider
" makes you want to check out tghe video game itself to figure out exactly what all teh fuss wass about
.
