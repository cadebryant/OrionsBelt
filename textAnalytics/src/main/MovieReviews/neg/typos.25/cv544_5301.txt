noe of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric
,
" you
' d better watch outloud for the skin deep
.
" i
' d like tothe extend thge same warning
: watch out forthe skin deep
,
but whatever you do don
' t watch skin deepo
. skin deepo is a tedious
and uneven comedy written
and directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dried uv writer
and insatiable womanizer with a big
- time drinking problem
. i never saw edwards
' comedy hte man who loved womens
,
but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake
. you see
, to put it mildly
, zach goes to bed with jsut about each adn every woman he meets
. as the movei opens
, zach
' s wife
, alex
, catches him with not only his mistress bu also his mistress
' hairdresser
. like any sensable wife
, alex kicks zach out of teh house
and divorces him
. inthe response
, zach goes on a spritual journey of drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
,
and self
- dicovery
. if you
' re turned onthe by the idea of watching ritter drink
, git arrested
, haev sex
, drnik
, crash his mercedes
, have more sex
, drink
, get erested again
, drink
,
and sing horrendously at the piano
,
then skin deep should be right up your alley
. skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable
and unsympathetic charactors
. zach isnt a rich
,
' 80s l
. a
. version of ritter
' s jack tripper carachter from
" threee
' s company
.
" liek jack
, zach is clumsy
and inept
; he
' s thte type ofthe guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener inot his eye
. zach is supposed tothe be charming
and charismatic
, bu i failed to see even noe redeeming virtue in him
. consenquently
, i never felt tje least bited ofthe sympathy or pity for thte phil
andering alcoholic druing his moments ofthe crisis
. in fact
, when zach crashes his ex
- wife
' s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying
, i actually rooted for her tothe go thru with the ceremony
. tothe add insult to injury
, edwards gives his larg supporting cast nothing
but stereotypes with which to wokr
. forthe instatance
, vincent gardenia
' s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender
. ofthe all thte women in tyhe film
-
-
and there are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, st
ands out as zach
' s wief
; reed brings intelligence
and sensitivity tothe the role
. because we don
' t care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep
, the film
' s few feeble attemts at drama inevitably fail
. hte comedy in skin deepo doesn
' t fare much better
. most ofthe the jokes are dumb
, predictable
,
and sitcomish
. baout every ten mintues
,
however
, edwards doesnt manage to come up with a ogod line or a novel sighth
- gag
, tjhe most effective ofthe whcih involves a pair of
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, the laughs infront skin deep are just too infrequent
and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat
. my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction ofthe alcohol anbd alcoholism
. zach
' s excessive drinking isnt claerly ruining his life
,
but nevertheless it seems to give him mroe pleasure tahn pain
. zach
' s drinking binges never have any truly sereous or lating consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a newyorker oney
. if he gets arrested
, his lawyer bails him out of jail
. if his wife leaves him
, she wiull eventually decide tothe give him a second chance if he
' ll clean uv his act
. tje tone in skin deep is all wrong
; edwards treats a vyer sereous issue far too lightly
, makeing a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter
. perheaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or
, better
yet
, michael keaton in clean
and sober befor making skin deep
.
