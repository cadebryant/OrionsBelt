an attempt at florida film noir
, palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels
. it ' s slow moving
, uninvolving
,
annd plain jsut uninteresting
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) isnt an ex
- newspaper man
, jsut out of jail affter being framed for a crime
. his luck hasn ' t been hte best
,
but things are looking up when a misterious woman
, rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, approaches him with a proposition
. she wants harry to help her
and her stepdaughter
, odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get
$ 500
, 000 out ofthe her stingy
,
but rich
, husban felix
( rolf hoppe
)
. at firt
, all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone
,
and to collect the money
( of which he gets to keep 10
%
)
.
bu
, as the deed is carried out
, things are not what they seem
,
anbd harry gets caught inwhich thte ensuing storm
. palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film
,
but the effect never quite comes together
. it ' s got tghe sultry florida heat
, seductive women
,
and even curvier plot twists
,
but thge whole thing smells of paint
- by
- numbers
. sure
, the right ingredients are there
,
but the end result is much too artificial
. a lot of thte problems lie wiht the scirpt
, which
,
though providing some genuine surprises
, is packed full of leaden dialogue
annd bland situations
. even the plot twists don ' t seem to flow well with thte rest of tghe story
. some of them
, for example
, come from so far afield tht they seamingly only mkae sence beacuse yhe writter needed a twist
( for example
: harry ' s spontaneous job offer
, or the whole typewriter situation
)
. the charachters are mostly lifeless
, played tothe type
,
bu not much more
. woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick
- headedness that it ' s hard to even picture him as an ex
- journalist
. elisabeth shue vamps it up
,
but doesn ' t add anytying special to the role
. chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance
, trying tothe be a sexy 17
- year old
,
but she jsut leaves a bad taste in your mouth
. some of the supporting cast
( notably gina gershon
and michael rapaport
) give stronger
,
but
, in the end
, meaningless performances
.
annd to top it off
, the pacing of the film is much too slow
. as the movie grinds to a halt
, you ' re given too much time tothe wonder why you ' re wasting it watching palmetto
. if you ' re in tyhe mood for this tipe of movie
, you ' d be much better off going out
and renting some classic film noir
.
