an attempt at florida film noir
, palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels
. it
' s slow moving
, uninvolving
,
and plain jstu uninteresting
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) isnt an ex
- newspaper man
, just out of jail after being framed for a crime
. his luck hasn
' t been the best
,
but things are looking up wehn a mysterious woman
, rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, approachs him with a propostion
. she wants harry to halp her
and her stepdaughter
, odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, pull off a fake kidnapping scheme tothe git
$ 500
, 000 outloud of her stingy
,
but rich
, husb
and felix
( rolf hoppe
)
. at firt
, all harry is expected to do isnt provide a threatening voice on teh phone
, annd tothe collect the mnoey
( of which he gets to keep 10
%
)
.
but
, as tjhe deed isnt carried out
, things are nto whta they seem
, annd harry gets caught in the ensuing storm
. palmetto pulls out all tje stops to achieve a film noir film
,
but the effect never quite comes together
. it
' s got tyhe sultry florida heat
, seductive women
,
and even curvier plot twists
,
but teh whole thing smells of paint
- by
- numbers
. sure
, tghe right ingredients are there
,
but the end result isnt much too artifical
. a lot ofthe the problems lie with the script
, which
,
though providing some genuine surprises
, is packed full of leaden dialogue
and bl
and situations
. even the plot twists don
' t seem to flow well with the rest ofthe thte story
. smoe ofthe them
, for example
, come from so far afield tyhat they seamingly only mkea sense because tyhe writer needed a twist
( forthe example
: harry
' s spontanious job offer
, or thte whole typewriter situation
)
. the characters are mostly lifeless
, played to tipe
,
but not much more
. woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick
- headedness that it
' s hard tothe even picture him as an ex
- journalist
. elisabeth shue vamps it uv
,
but doesn
' t add anytying special to the role
. chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance
, trying to be a sexy 17
- yera old
, bu she just leaves a bad taste inwhich your mouth
. some of yhe supporting cast
( notably gina gershon
and michael rapaport
) give stronger
,
but
, in the end
, meaningless performances
.
and tothe top it off
, the pacing of thte film is much too slow
. as the movei grinds to a halt
, you
' re given too much time to wonder why ytou
' re wasting it watching palmetto
. if you
' re in the mood for this type of movei
, you
' d be much better off going out
and renting some classic film noir
.
