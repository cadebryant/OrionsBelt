tim robbins
and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy
. robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex wtih his boss
. he goes into depression
,
and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual
' ghetto
' side of every american city
. there
, lawernce attempts to steal his car
, bu tothe noone avail
,
and isnt dragged along wih robbin
' s on a trip to arizona
. there
, they hold up a store
, are mistaken for two other robbers
( just like in my cousin vinny
)
and are chased by the police
,
and the other robbers
. ofthe course
, ther
' s gags along the way
, ususally from lawernce
.
al
though the film is midly funny
,
and quite watchable
, there
' s something so horribly familiar baout it all
. this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there
' s lawernce witht his wisecracking
and heavy profanity
, just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop
, anbd pratically yhe same idea as midnight run
. it
' s full ofthe all the road movie cliches
,
and even has a
' comedy
' car chase
, which just seemed so eighties
. even the credit sequence seemed tothe be outloud ofthe a steve martin
, or chevy chase
, eighties comedy
. there also isn
' t much chemistry betweeen robbins
and lawernce
. in planes
, trains adn automobiles
, there was real chemistry between steve martin
and john c
andy
. in nothing to lose
, there is hardly chemistry at all
. towards the end the chemistry seems to work
,
but forthe the bulk of tje film
, there isnt hardly any
, tje director directs the film in a workman like fashion
,
but gets tyhe jokes across
.
and
al
though there isnt noone chemistry between the twpo leads
, they give ogod performances on their own
. lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance
,
and robbin
' s is alright aswell
.
however
, robbin
' s performance is nowhere near as good as tyhe cahracters he played in jacob
' s ladder
, adn the player
. in fact
, if you watn to see robbin
' s do comedy much better than in nothing to lose
, i suggest you rent outloud the hudsucker proxy
, where he is much funnier
. nothing to lose does hve smoe funny moments in it
,
however
. the humour isn
' t particulary sophisticated
,
but if you enojyed dumb
& dumber
, ytou might enjoy this
. tjhe charachters infront arizona are funny
,
and there
' s also a good scene where robbin
' s asks a shopkeeper which
' threatening aproach
' ws better
, lawerences
( wich consisted ofthe lawerence threatening tothe shoot the shopkeeper
' s ass
,
and swearing a lot
)
, or himselfs
,
( whic was speaking in a deep
, sacry voice
) bu the gags are predictable
, tyhe lack of chemistry infurating
,
and the ending too far
- fetched annd
' perfect
' nothing to lose
then
, is robbin
' s first
' bad
' movie
(
and hopefully his last
)
, annd suggests that odereick should twice before makeing another film
. he nearly ruined carrey
' s career with ace ventura
: when nature calls
, let
' s hope he hasn
' t ruined robbin
' s
( or even lawerence
' s
) with nothing to lose
.
