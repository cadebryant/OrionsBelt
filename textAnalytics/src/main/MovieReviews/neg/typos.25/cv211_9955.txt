tim robbins
and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy
. robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss
. he goes into depression
,
and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ' ghetto ' side of every american city
. there
, lawernce attempts to steal his car
,
but to noone avail
,
anbd is dragged along with robbin ' s on a trip to arizona
. there
, they hold up a store
, are mistaken fo twpo other robbers
( just liek in my cousin vinny
)
and are chased by tjhe police
,
and the other robbers
. ofthe course
, there ' s gags allong the way
, usually from lawernce
.
allthough the film is midly funny
,
and quite watchable
, there ' s something so horribly familiar about it all
. this film should raelly be called beverly hills midnight run there ' s lawernce whith his wisecracking
and heavy profanity
, just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop
,
anbd pratically tje same idae as midnight run
. it ' s full of all the road movie cliches
,
annd even has a ' comedy ' car chase
, which just seemed so eighties
. even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin
, or chevy chase
, eighties comedy
. there also isn ' t much chemistry between robbins
and lawernce
. inwhich planes
, trains
and automobiles
, htere ws real chemistry between steve martin
and john candy
. in nothing to lose
, there is hardly chemistry at all
. towards the end thge chemistry seems to work
,
but for the bulk of the film
, there isnt hardly any
, the director directs the film in a workman liuke fashion
,
but gets the jokes across
.
annd
although htere is no chemestry between the twpo leads
, they give good performances on their own
. lawerence gives a ogod eddie murphy performance
,
annd robbin ' s is alright aswell
.
however
, robbin ' s performence is nowhere near as good as thge characters he played inspite jacob ' s ladder
,
anbd the palyer
. in fact
, if you want to see robbin ' s do comedy much better than in nothing to lose
, i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy
, where he is much funnier
. nothing to lose doesnt have some funny moments in it
,
however
. the humour isn ' t particulary sophisticated
,
but if you enojyed dumb
& dumber
, ytou might enjoy thsi
. the characters in arizona are funny
,
and there ' s also a good scene where robbin ' s asks a shopkeeper which ' threatening aproach ' was better
, lawerences
( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper ' s ass
,
annd swearing a lot
)
, or himselfs
,
( which was speaking inwhich a deep
, scary voice
)
bu the gags are predictable
, the lack ofthe chemistry infurating
,
adn the endig too far
- fetched
and ' perfect ' nothing to lose
hten
, is robbin ' s first ' bad ' movie
(
and hopefully his lsat
)
,
and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film
. he nearly ruined carrey ' s career with ace ventura
: when nature calls
, let ' s hope he hasn ' t ruined robbin ' s
( or even lawerence ' s
) with nothing tothe lose
.
