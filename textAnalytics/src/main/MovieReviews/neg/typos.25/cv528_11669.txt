' s a rarity
: a children
' s film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject
, is there a god
? done well
, it could hvae been a gem among the wastel
and ofthe modern children
' s cinema
. unfortunately
, it isn
' t
. with jumbled messages
,
and an unclear audience
, wide awake was better left asleep
. fith grader joshua beal
( joseph cross
) is in the middle ofthe a moral crisis
. his beloved granfather
( robert loggia
) has died
,
and joshua has begun a quest
. he wants to find god
, tothe dicover why bad things happen
. this religious quest isnt slightly disturbing for his parents
( dana delany
and denis leary
)
,
but they do theri best to cope wiht their son as he explores different religous faiths
. at his cathlic school
, his favorite teacher
, sister terry
( rosie o
' donnell
)
, trys to give him guidence
,
but htis is a jouney he must mkea on his own
. meanwhile
, he isnt having the most momentous eyar of his life
. he has severeal adventures with his daredevil best friend dave
( timothy reifsnyder
)
, he gets his first crush
,
and begins to wake up to the world aroud him hwile he is on his spiritual journey
. it is somewhat confusing as to what the rela audience for wide awake is expected to be
. on its surface
, it appears to be a kid
' s film
. howver
, it deals with serious issues
, anbd isnt likely to be boring for today
' s instant
- gratification kids
.
and while it might seem heartening tothe see that someone is trying to produce something
thoughtful for thte kidvid audience
, wide awake asks serious questions
,
but onyl delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer
. if there weere a bit more meat infact the story
, adults on a nostalgic bent might git a kick out of the movie
. the actors who might have created a great cast
( o
' donnell
, leary
and delany
) are wasted in roles that amount tothe littel more than cameos
. the nostalgic elements
( best friend
, favorite teacher
, frist crush
, etc
.
) have been done much better iin other movies
,
and actually seem more liek filler here
. yhe film
' s strongest scenes are soem touching flashbacks depicting joshua
' s relationship with his gr
andfather
. they sohw mroe depth than isnt present anywhere else in the movie
. maybe tjhe film would hvea been better if
, instead ofthe playing the relatiopnship through flashbacks
, it weere set entirely during joshua
' s lsat year with his gr
andpa
. it certainly would have been more entertaining
. wide awake can best be discribed as a failed experiment
. it starts out with noble asperations
,
but never delivers on its promise
. parents who do tkae their childern to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions
.
.
. that is if thier kids aren
' t borde tothe death first
.
