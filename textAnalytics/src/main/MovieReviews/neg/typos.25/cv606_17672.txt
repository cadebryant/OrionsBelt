filmmakers will use all manner ofthe tricks to flesh out
and brighten up a dull
, dreary
,
and overused idea
. doug liman
( swingers
)
, director of the ultra
- hip
and severely dark comedy go
, is an example of just such a filmmaker
. in his latest
, he gives the viewers a raucous
, neon
- lit backdrop as cinematographer
adn points the audience down a drug
- infested path ofthe misadventure as director
.
but he fails tothe come up with any parallell structure inspite his multi
- tiered movei
and he fails to connect with hte audience onthe any levle
, bringing the worth of his efforts to nil
anbd the value of go to baout the smae
. his movie is produced anthology
- style
-
- telling the same story from multiple
( three
) points of view
, much as an author might wriet a serial novel
. consistant with this ethic
, liman
and screenwriter john august provide a bit ofthe an overlap at the beginning ofthe each narrative
and insert brief connections tothe otehr narratives
. the thread that laces tje three stories together is a drug deel
and the events thereafter
. inthe story a we hvea checkout clerk ronna
( sarah polley
) looking to score some rent monye
and turning to drug trafficking tothe do it
; inthe story b we have regluar drug dealer simon
( desmond askew
) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity
;
anbd in story c we have gay soap actors zack
( jay mohr
)
and adam
( scott wolf
) working undercover for the polical to bust said drug deel
. neither of the three stories have much substance
,
and the movei has the feel ofthe a campfire story
( albeit a rether strange one
) that coudl be told in five tothe ten minutes
.
( in fact
, the movie wass originally a short film entited x expanded tothe feature lenght
.
) the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie ' s christmas setting
,
annd the los angeles
/ las vegas nightlife is something too far ffrom the mainstream for most theater
- goers to attach themselves to
. thte characters are shallow to tyhe point of prerequisite
,
and performances from little
- known players like polley
, askew
,
and taye diggs don ' t halp or hurt the roles
. in fact
, even bigger names like mohr
, wolf
,
and katie holmes don ' t ahev enough time to make substantial success
.
although thta ' s almost expected for lack of continuous screen time
, tghe success in the picture shoudln cmo from a thread that binds the stories
. go doesn ' t have this
,
and it suffers baceause ofthe it
. as far as teen movies are conserned
, go represents the absolute bottom
, for its constant stream ofthe indecipherable light
and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme
.
( tje follwoing do not count as common themes
: drug deals
, people attempting tothe have rumatic interludes with drug dealers
, people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives
, or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them
.
) at times
, the humer in go is sickly funny
,
and on a low inght
, almsot watchable
;
but for hte majority of its runing time
and for most viewers
, tihs movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night
.
