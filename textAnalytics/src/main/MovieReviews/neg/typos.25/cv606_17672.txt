filmmakers will use all manner of tricks tothe flesh out annd brighten uv a dull
, dreary
,
and overused idea
. doug liman
( swingers
)
, director of the ultra
- hip
and severely dark comedy go
, is an example of just such a filmmaker
. in his latest
, he gives hte viewers a raucous
, neon
- lit backdrop as cinematographer annd points thte audiance down a drug
- infested path ofthe misadventure as director
.
but he fails tothe come up with any parallel structure in his multi
- tiered movie
and he fails to connect with the audiance on any level
, bringing the worth of his effords to nil
and the value ofthe go to about the same
. his movie is produced anthology
- stlye
-
- telling the smae storey from multiple
( three
) points of veiw
, much as an author might write a serial novel
. consistant with this ethic
, liman
and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of earch narrative
and insert breef connections tothe other narratives
. the thread tath laces tghe threee stories toghether isnt a drug deal annd thte events thereafter
. in stoy a we have checkout clerk ronna
( sarah polley
) looking to socre some rent mney annd turning to drug trafficking to do it
; iin stoy b we hvea regular drug dealer simon
( desmond askew
) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity
;
and in story c we hvea gay soap actors zack
( jay mohr
)
and adam
( scott wolf
) working undercover for thte police to bust said drug deal
. neither of thte three stories have much substance
,
and thte movie hasnt the feel of a campfire sotry
( albeit a rether stange oney
) that sould be told in five to ten mintues
.
( in fact
, the movie was originally a short film entilted x exp
anded to feature length
.
) the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie
' s christmas setting
,
and the los angeles
/ las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theather
- goers to attach themselves tothe
. the characters are shallow tothe tyhe point ofthe prerequisite
,
and performances from littel
- known players like polley
, askew
,
and taye diggs don
' t help or hurt the roles
. in fact
, even bigger names like mohr
, wolf
,
and katie holmes don
' t have enough time to make substantial success
.
al
though thast
' s almost expected for lack of continuous screen timne
, thge succsess in the picture should come from a thread taht binds the stories
. go doesn
' t have this
,
and it suffers because ofthe it
. as far as teen movies are concerned
, go represents the absolute bottom
, for its constant stream of indecipherable light
and sound mean nothing wihtout some sort ofthe common theme
.
( the following do not count as common themes
: drug deals
, peple attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers
, people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives
, or peple not involved in drug deals stumbling inot them
.
) at times
, the humor in go isnt sickly funny
,
and on a low night
, almost watchable
;
but forthe the majority of its runnung time
and for most viewers
, htis movei will best be left tothe teens at blockbuster on a saturday night
.
