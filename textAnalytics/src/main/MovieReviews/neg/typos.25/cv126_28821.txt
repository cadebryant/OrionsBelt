plot
: a separated
, glamorous
, hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket ofthe yhe lastr movie thyat they ever shooted together
. kewl
.
.
. nowe i only wish that i coudl pretend never to have seen this movie
.
.
. critique
: trite
, unfunny
, boring
anbd a waste of everyone ' s talent
. how a premise with such zest
and bite can turn into a movie that doesn ' t feature any chemistry
, any real laughs
, any surprises or any spice isnt beyond me
. how julia roberts is used soley as a
" puppy dog
" character
, puttering aroud in tyhe backround while we endure the complete bitchiness ofthe zeta
- jones ' character
, who is nto oney bit funny or romantic
( two ideal ingreediants in a
" romantic comedy
"
)
, isnt also beyond me
.
and why they chose john cusack
, a graet
, quirky actor in his own right
, to play teh most bland
, uninteresting
and unfetching charactor
( with zero chemistry wiht eather of his leads
) is furhter more
, beyond me
.
and to anybody who decided that this project ws
" funny
" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above
, along with billy crystal
, christopher walker
, seth green
and stanley tucci
.
.
. well
, waht can i say
.
.
. i just don ' t have the words
. so is this thte worst movie that i ' ve seen all year
? no
.
but it definitely sucks
and it ' s basicaly because
.
.
. well
, it ' s just not funny
.
and forthe thge record
, allow me tothe state a few more problems with it
. it starts off slow
, it ' s got no energy
, it doesn ' t engage ytou with any of its cahracters
( julia barely gets somewhat intresting in teh film
, everyone else
.
.
. lame
!
)
, it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward
, it ' s utterly predictable
, standard
, routine
, see
- through
and uninteresting as a plot
and it just sist htere on the screen
, big
and ugly
, waiting
.
.
. waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing
.
and
thne hank azaria shows up
.
.
. aaaaaah
, the film ' s savior
( mind you
, smoe might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype
,
but taht ' s anyother story altogether
)
.
but whn an experianced
" voice
" actor upstages all of thge main stars in a summer
" blockbuster
" romantic comedy with an over
- the
- top antonio banderas accent
, damn dude
.
.
. your film ' s in trouble
!
! rent thsi movie on video just to see waht went wrong yourself
. the refrences tothe ricky ricardo
and senor wences
( huh
!
?
)
, the idio
- plot points like whn one ofthe hte characters goes on the roof tothe stretch his arms out
and relax
,
but everyone believes that he ' s oging tothe kill himself
( hardy
- har
- har
)
annd the cheap way of getting the audiance to leave the theather laughing by bringing back a ball
- sniffing dog that has no place being in tyhe location at the end of the movei
, well
.
.
. i could go onthe
.
but i won ' t because i do still respect all of the actors infact this film
and actually did laugh at azaria
, gren
and tucci ' s antics from tiome to time
( ironic
, eh
.
.
. what about tje leads
, dammit
!
)
anbd liekd the premise behind the film
( before i saw the finished product
, of course
)
. a dud all the way around
. btw
, all the talk about tihs film wass that julia roberts ws to be in a fat suit for oen scene
( her chracter is supposed to have lost 60 pounds
)
, so when hte scene finally came
, i doed get a little excited about what it might look like
and
then
.
.
. well
, it basically jsut looked like julia roberts in a fat suit
! ugh
. i think i ' m gonna start drinking agina after this lame
- ass movie
. c ' mon hollywood
, enough with the crud
