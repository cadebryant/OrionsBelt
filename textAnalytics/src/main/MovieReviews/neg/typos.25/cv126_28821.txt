plot
: a separated
, glamorous
, hollywood cuple must pretend to reunite for a press junket ofthe the last movei that they ever shooted together
. kewl
.
.
. now i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie
.
.
. critique
: trite
, unfunny
, boring
and a waste of everyone
' s talent
. how a premise with such zest
and bite can turn inot a movie that doesn
' t feature any chemistry
, any real laughs
, any surprises or any spice is beyond me
. how julia roberts is used solely as a
" puppy dog
" charactor
, puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta
- jones
' character
, who isnt not one bit funny or rumatic
( two ideal ingredients in a
" romantic comedy
"
)
, isnt also beyond me
.
and why they chose john cusack
, a grat
, quirky actor in his own right
, tothe play the most bl
and
, uninteresting
and unfetching character
( with zero chemestry with either ofthe his leads
) is further more
, beyond me
.
and tothe anybody who desided that tihs project wass
" funny
" enough tothe greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above
, along with billy crystal
, christopher walker
, seth gren
and stanley tucci
.
.
. well
, what cxan i say
.
.
. i just don
' t hve the words
. so isnt tihs the worst movei thta i
' ve seen all year
? no
.
but it definitely sucks adn it
' s basically because
.
.
. well
, it
' s just nto funny
.
and fo the record
, allow me to state a few more problems with it
. it starts off slow
, it
' s got no energy
, it doesn
' t engage you with any of its characters
( julia bearly gets somewhat interesting in the film
, everyone esle
.
.
. lame
!
)
, it utilizes way too many flashbacks tothe move the stroy forward
, it
' s utterly predictable
, st
andard
, routine
, see
- through anbd uninteresting as a plot adn it just sits there onthe the screen
, big
and ugly
, waiting
.
.
. waiting forthe you tothe laugh or find something in it that isnt amusing
.
and
then hank azaria shows up
.
.
. aaaaaah
, tje film
' s savior
( mind you
, some might be offended by his exaggeration ofthe a stereotype
,
but that
' s another story altogether
)
.
but when an experienced
" voice
" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer
" blockbuster
" romantic comedy withthe an over
- the
- top antonio b
anderas accent
, damn dude
.
.
. your film
' s in trouble
!
! rent tihs movei on video just to see what went wrong youself
. the references tothe ricky ricardo
and senor wences
( huh
!
?
)
, tjhe idio
- plot points liuke when noe of the characters goes onthe the roof to strech his arms out anbd relax
,
but everyone believes that he
' s going to kill himself
( hardy
- har
- har
) annd the cheap way ofthe getting hte audience to leave tyhe theater laughing by bringing bcak a ball
- sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end ofthe the movie
, well
.
.
. i coudl go on
.
but i won
' t because i do still respect all ofthe the actors in this film
and actually doed laugh at azaria
, green
and tucci
' s antics ffrom time to time
( ironical
, eh
.
.
. what about tghe leads
, dammit
!
)
and liked the premise behind the film
( before i saw the finished product
, of course
)
. a dud all the way aroud
. btw
, all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene
( her charater is supposed to have lost 60 pounds
)
, so when the scene finally came
, i did get a little excited about what it might look like anbd
then
.
.
. well
, it basically just looked like julia roberts inaddition a fat suit
! ugh
. i think i
' m gonna start drinking again after thsi lame
- ass movie
. c
' mon hollywood
