some movies ask yuo to leave your brain at the door
, some movies ask you to believe inthe thge impossible to really have a good tiem
. playing god asks just oen simple
, eensy
, teensy thing so it can fully entertain yuo
, it
' s accomplished in jstu four eazy to follow steps
: crack open your skull
, scoop out your brain
, squish it under your foot several times
and reverse steps two anbd one
. congratulations
, you now ahve all the necesary requirements tothe fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing
. some movies fail at teh box office
but ytou manage to see why the producers
thought it could have been a good movei
, others are simpley good ideas that are badly executed
.
then there
' s playing god
, which enters the esteemed category of movies whlch seem to have grown from the union ofthe a drunk director
, actors satisfied inspite the knowlege thgat this horrible flick will ahve no lasting impact onthe their careers
and a bunch of rip
- offs
( or homages as they like to call it
) ffrom otehr
, better movies that end uv looking liek an unflushed toilet
. harsh
? maybe
. justified
? hell yes
! this is a movei that is not just satisfied inspite ripping off other movies
but fiels the ened to remind us ofthe that fact every ten mintues
. for example
, a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his h
ands firing awya
. this does look moderately kool
,
but the camera lingers onthe the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling
:
" oooh
, look look
! john woo
! twpo guns blazing
! slooooow motion
!
"
and if thgat wasn
' t enough
, you can also hear yhe scirpt grunting under the effort it must take to try
and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep
and meaningful like in a tarantino movie
. poore timothy hutton gets tothe deliver most ofthe the corny lines
, you have to admire tghe efort he puts inot it
, tihs guy deserves better
. unlike most movies this one does not suffer from
" stupid bad guy
" syndrome
, just to make things a little different this tiem we get stupid heros
. example
: duchovny manages tothe distract a bad guy by making him go into tjhe bathroom tothe get some b
andages
. now the bad guy isnt
, liek
, stoned
, man
, so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero
.
( term unsed as loosely as possable
) survival instincts
and a ogod dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun
, which our hero does
, bu onyl aftter contemplating it for about thirty seconds
. even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it
, goign so far as to acutally wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger
. mind you
, i
' ve never fired a shotgun in my life
but believe yuo me tht the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs
, be he stoned or not
. some iwll argue that our hero does not haev a killer instinct
, the hell with tath
! twpo fbi guys have just beeen shot in front me
, along with one bad guy adn the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second
. solution
? boom
! i
' ll take the time to efel sory about it later thank you very much
. another prime example of the idiat hero syndrome
: our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens tothe her
. he knows tjhe head bad guy has her on tyhe tenth floor of a building
and that he might be runing into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers
. he still hasnt his shotgun
, bring it along yuo say
? no thanks
, i
' ll just ditch it in yhe bcak ofthe my car
.
and tjhe real kicker is this
: when he reaches the room
and people start shooting at him he hasnt yhe nerve tothe look surprised
! hwile we are on the subject of getting shot
, why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the doorjam
? i
' ve got no formall training
but even i know you never sit with your back tothe the doorjam
. ask mr
. wild bill
, tyhe first anbd only time he did not sit with his back tothe a wall cost him his life
. this isnt the major probelm with tihs movie
, any mook coudl have
thought of a hundred ways to make it better
. is it so much to ask that hollywood actaully put a little common sense into theri charachters
? fo instatance
: our heroes hide at duchovny
' s summer hmeo
, now the bad guys could come knocking at any moent
. ok
, tihs time our hero does get himself a gun
and has it at his side most of thge tiem
. bu see
, our hero isnt a drug addict
and guess what
? he chooses now to go clean annd suffer through dt
. oh sure
, he
' ll be really impressive wehn the bad guys come calling
. going clean is really honorable ofthe him
, bu i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able tothe fire a gun
. for an enjoyable peformance by timothy hutton
, plot holes the size of godzilla
, getting our intelligence insulted anbd several
" oh come on
!
" moments
