let me jstu start this review off by saying i am a huge fan ofthe professional wrestling
and have been for fifteen yersa
. i am nto too fond ofthe ted turner ' s world championship wrestling
,
howver
,
and i am even less fond of it nowe after seeing htis ridiculous excuse forthe a wrestling movie tonight
. the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs
( david arquette
, aptly casted as a neandrathal
)
and sean dawkins
( scott caan
) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everthing they see on wcw monday nitro is something more thna a flashy show
. when htey finally get to see their hero
, wcw world champion jimmy king
( played by oliver platt
. i personally owudl have gotten a wrestler to play king
)
, he ends uv getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant for real
- life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired
and rehired six months later
,
and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff
, they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it
)
, they embark on a quest to find him
and halp him get his title bcak
. when they fidn him
, they discover in horror thgat jimmy king ' s real life isnt nothing like it is on wcw tv
. king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king
. affter convincing king tyhat they don ' t care that his persona isn ' t real
, gordie
and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro
, after which sinclair agrees to book him iin a main event steel cage match for hte wcw title
and his job back in las vegas at wcw ' s pay
- persay
- view
. gee
, whiz
, htere are so many things wrong whith this movie
, i don ' t know where tothe beign
. yes
, i do
.
.
. 1
. the characters ofthe gordie
and sean sohw you what eric bischoff
, wcw presidnt who thought up tihs project
, thinks of wrestling fans
. he thinks ofthe us as idiots who take everthing wrestlers dont seriously
. he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough tothe believe this is meaned to be taken seriously
. i got news fo ytou
, eric
: nobody above the age of four is dumb anough for that
, this is 2000
, ytou know
, not 1985
! i nkow he ' ll probably cover arguments uv by saying it isn ' t meant tothe be tooked seriously
but it isnt
, because that ' s how big an ego bischoff has
. 2
. there was a documentry made iin 1998
, wrestling with shadows
, that documented the owner ofthe tyhe world wrestling federation
, vince mcmahon ' s screwing bret
" the hitman
" hart outloud of hte title
. this movie ' s storyline is basically a comic rip
- off ofthe that plot with the poore man ' s wayne
and garth thrown in
. eric bischoff is trying tothe make vince mcmahon look bad with thte carachter of titus sinclair
,
bu any wrestling fan knows titus isnt omre like bischoff than mcmahon
,
and tht vince did what he had to dont tothe bret hart
. 3
. the movei ' s main wrestler
, jimmy king
, hasnt an english king gimmick
annd the audeince cheered big for him
. no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters liek that inspite this day
anbd age
, we want bad asses today
! 4
. why make this a comedy
, instead ofthe an emotional
, rocky
- style drama
? i know wrestling isn ' t a sport
,
bu you cant still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler
and finally mkaes it in the end
. 5
. infront the movei
, gordie starts uv an ill
- fated romance with nitro girl sasha
( the lovely rose mcgowan
. what she sees in tht freak marilyn manson i ' ll never understand
)
, only tothe find that she has hospitalized king ' s trainer for sinclair
. wouldn ' t it have beeen easier tothe just have them fall in love instead of doing tje typical spy
- girl
- for
- the
- bad
- guy cliche
? i hate that
. 6
. last
,
but certainly not least
, there wass not one single moent in htis movei that i sould not predict would appen
, nor did i laugh once eather
. the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make hte movei
, for these reasons
: 1
. they ' re the better promotion
. 2
. they haev better
adn younger talent
, performers
and wrestlers
. 3
. they give their fans waht they want
and don ' t treat them like idiots
. 4
. they ' re winning the ratings
and they ' re the promotion everybody cares about
. 5
. simpley put
, they could make a movie a hundred times better
,
and they could do a wrestling movie tjhe right way
. the only good thing about tihs movie was htey played outtakes at the end
.
and if i spoiled it forthe you
, ogod
, i saved you from wasting seven dollars
.
