let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling adn have been for fifteen years
. i am not too fond of ted turner
' s world championship wrestling
,
however
,
and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this rediculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight
. the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs
( david arquette
, aptly casted as a ne
andrathal
)
and sean dawkins
( scott caan
) who are so obssessed with proffesional wrestling that they believe everything they see onthe wcw omnday nitro is something mroe than a flashy show
. when tehy fianlly get to see their hero
, wcw world champion jimmy king
( played by oliver platt
. i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king
)
, he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant for rela
- life wcw president eric bischoff befor he was fired
and rehired six monthes later
, adn if anyone reads this who knows bischoff
, they will agreing wiht me that the role of sinclair had his name writen all over it
)
, tehy embark on a quest to fidn him
and halp him get his title back
. when they find him
, htey disover in horror that jimmy king
' s real life is nothing like it is onthe wcw tv
. king isnt a drunken atlanta native rather thna an english king
. after convincing king that they don
' t care tht his persona isn
' t real
, gordie
and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro
, after which sinclair agrees tothe book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title
and his job back in las vegas at wcw
' s pay
- per
- veiw
. gee
, whiz
, there are so many things wrong wtih this movie
, i don
' t knwo where to begin
. yes
, i do
.
.
. 1
. tje characters of gordie anbd sean show you what eric bischoff
, wcw president who thougth uv thsi project
, thinks of wrestling fans
. he thikns of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously
. he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to blieve this isnt meant tothe be taken seriously
. i got news for yuo
, eric
: nobody above tje age of four is dumb anough for taht
, this is 2000
, ytou know
, not 1985
! i know he
' ll probaly cover arguments up by saying it isn
' t meaned tothe be taken seriously
but it is
, because thgat
' s how big an ego bischoff has
. 2
. there was a documentary made inwhich 1998
, wrestling wih shadows
, thta documented the owner ofthe thge world wrestling federation
, vince mcmahon
' s screwing bret
" the hitman
" hart out ofthe the title
. this movie
' s storyline is basicly a comic rip
- off of that plot with the poor man
' s wayne
and garth thrown in
. eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with yhe character of titus sinclair
,
but any wrestling fan knows titus is moreso like bischoff than mcmahon
,
and tath vince doed what he had to do to bret hart
. 3
. the movie
' s main wrestler
, jimmy king
, hasnt an english king gimmick
and the audeince cheered big for him
. no wrestling fan atually enjoys characters like that in this day
and age
, we want bad asses today
! 4
. why make this a comedy
, instade of an emotional
, rocky
- style drama
? i nkwo wrestling isn
' t a sport
,
but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler
and finally makes it infact the end
. 5
. in tghe movie
, gordie starts up an ill
- fated romance wih nitro girl sasha
( the lovley rose mcgowan
. what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i
' ll never underst
and
)
, only tothe find that she hasnt hospitalized king
' s trainer forthe sinclair
. wouldn
' t it have been easier tothe just have them fall iin love instade of doing tjhe tipical spy
- girl
- for
- the
- bad
- guy cliche
? i hite that
. 6
. lastest
,
but certainly not least
, ther was not one single moment in this movie tyhat i sould nto predict would happn
, nor doed i laugh once eather
. the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie
, for these reasons
: 1
. htey
' re the better promotion
. 2
. htey have better
and younger talent
, performers
and wrestlers
. 3
. htey give thier fans what they want
and don
' t treat them like idiots
. 4
. tehy
' re winning the ratings
and they
' re teh promotion everybody cares about
. 5
. simpley put
, they could mkae a movie a hundred times better
, adn they could do a wrestling movie the right way
. the only good thing about this movie was they palyed outtakes at the end
. anbd if i spoiled it for you
, good
, i saved ytou ffrom wasting seven dollars
.
