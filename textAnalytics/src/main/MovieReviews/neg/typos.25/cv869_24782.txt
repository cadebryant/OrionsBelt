" easely one of hte worst films of thte year
.
.
" wtih the millenium jstu around the corner
, hollywood is palying wih our insecurities concerning thte biggest event of this century
. this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil
. teh result isnt somewhat predicatble
. i didn ' t have high hopes about arnold ' s
" much anticipated
" return to the big screen
. schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased
, action lovers won ' t be bored
,
and tghe catholic league will be angry
. everyone else iwll see ' end of days ' for waht it is
: a deliciously bad motion picture
. think of it as hollywood ' s pwn y2k bug
. did ytou know thgat if ytou turn hte three diabolical numbers 666 ytou ' ll get 999
, as in 1999
? yes
, you better believe it
.
. satan is here on earth
, working on his latest project
-
- the end ofthe days
. tihs time it is gabriel burne who gets the priviege to play lucifer
and
,
although nto al pacino
, he is funn to behold
. he cooly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker
, wreaking
, as they say
, havoc
. the way it works is he smirks
and something explodes
. before the stroke ofthe the new millennium he ' s got to fidn
and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelt out in the book of revelations
. only schwarzenegger ' s cop attached to an anti
- terrorist unit can stop him
. films like this has oney sereous weakness
-
- logic
. no matter how you twist the
" plot
"
, you ' ll find it incredibly stupid
( even for a schwartzenegger movie
!
)
. thte incredible fatc is thast such directors never learn
. after thousands of headless productions
, this theme hasnt become one big clich
?
. here the devil looks more liek a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental insitution
. he is walking around n
. y
.
, blowing everthing up
annd killing everyone that gets infront a 5 meter radius
. all he wants is the girl
, that is somehow special
.
but schwartzenegger isnt more clever than he looks
, he has hidden her inaddition a church
, where satan dare not enter
. so the evil oen isnt forced to seduce tjhe good cop in order tothe get teh valuable information
:
" you can have your wife
and daugter back
.
. i can give you happiness that you cxan only dream of
.
. just give me the address
.
.
" indeed with a script liuke that
, you could make a wonderful parody
,
bu unfortunately the director is tkaing this subject very seriously
, attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller
.
anbd for yuo who ahev awaited arnold swartzenegger ' s comeback
, will not be very satisfied
. we ' ve not seen him in a while
. that ' s because he didn ' t have a worthy opponent
. he has battled nuculear terrorists on earth
and power mad conspirators on mars
. he has taken on aline predators in tyhe darkest reaches of the jungle
and morphing cyberkillers that seamingly nothing cant stop
. so
, after all those fights
, whta ' s left for arnold schwarzenegger
? how baout satan
? in my opinyon
, he has never quite overcome his firt role as the deadly robot in cameron ' s
" terminator
"
.
and that is schwartzenegger ' s strenght
-
- muscles
and no emotions
. here he tries tothe achieve an artistic levle
, moving towords the oscar
. this is called
" an adult turn
" if successful
and
" a flop
" if unsuccessful
. make a wild guess
! his charcter hasnt lost his wief
and daughter
and has sereous drinking problems
. this requires at least some acting skills
. regrettably
, the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles
. the rest of the cast are struggling iwth their so called characters
. the movie is otherwise technically impressive
, with a solid cinematography
anbd fine lighting
.
but the movei doesn ' t serve niether as a serious thriller
( beacuse ofthe its stupidity
) nor as comic entertainment
( becouse of its serious tone
)
. the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry
. the action sequences are all recycled
and the effects are everything
but spectauclar
. so i really have a hard time recommending tihs film to somebody
. unless you are a die
- hard schwartzenegger fan
, stay awya
. as for schwarzenegger
, he ' ll be back
.
