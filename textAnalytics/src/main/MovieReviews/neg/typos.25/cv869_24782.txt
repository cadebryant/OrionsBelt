" easely noe of the worst films of the yearm
.
.
" with the millenium just around the corner
, hollywood is playing with our insecurities conserning teh biggest event ofthe this century
. this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against teh powers of evil
. the result isnt somewhat predicatble
. i didn
' t have high hopes about arnold
' s
" much anticipated
" return tothe the big screen
. schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased
, action lovers won
' t be bored
,
and the catholic leage will be angry
. everyone esle will see
' end of days
' fo what it isnt
: a deliciously bad motion picture
. think of it as hollywood
' s pwn y2k bug
. did you knwo that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you
' ll get 999
, as in 1999
? yes
, you better believe it
.
. satan is here on earth
, wokring on his latest project
-
- the end ofthe dyas
. this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege tothe play lucifer
and
,
al
though not al pacino
, he isnt fun to behold
. he coolly strolls through manhattan infact the borrowed body ofthe an investment banker
, wreaking
, as they say
, havoc
. thte way it works is he smirks
and something explodes
. befoer the stroke ofthe the new millennium he
' s got tothe find
and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations
. onyl schwarzenegger
' s cop attached tothe an anti
- territorist unti can stop him
. films liek this hasnt one serious weakness
-
- logic
. noone matter how you twist tghe
" plot
"
, you
' ll find it incredibly stupid
( even fo a schwartzenegger movie
!
)
. tje incredible fact isnt that such directors never leran
. after thous
ands ofthe headless productions
, this theme hasnt become one big clich
?
. here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution
. he is walking around n
. y
.
, blowing everyting uv adn killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius
. all he whants is the girl
, tht is somehow special
.
but schwartzenegger is more clever tahn he looks
, he hasnt hidden her in a church
, where satan dabree not enter
. so the evil one is forced to seduce tghe good cop in order to get tjhe valuable information
:
" yuo can have your wief
and daughter bcak
.
. i can give you happiness that ytou cant onyl dream of
.
. jsut give me tyhe address
.
.
" indeed with a script like that
, yuo sould make a wonderfull parody
,
but unfortunatly the director is taking tihs subject vrey seriously
, attemting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller
.
and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger
' s comeback
, will not be very satisfied
. we
' ve not seen him in a hwile
. that
' s becuase he didn
' t have a worthy opponent
. he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth anbd power mad conspirators on mars
. he has taken on alien predators infact thte darkest reaches ofthe hte jungle annd morphing cyberkillers thast seemingly nothing can stpo
. so
, after all thsoe fights
, what
' s left for arnold schwarzenegger
? how about satan
? inspite my opinion
, he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot infront cameron
' s
" terminator
"
.
and thast is schwartzenegger
' s stregth
-
- muscles
and noone emotions
. here he tries to achieev an artistic levle
, moving towards tyhe oscar
. this is called
" an adult turn
" if successful
and
" a flop
" if unsucessfull
. make a wild guess
! his chracter hasnt lost his wife
and daughter
and hasnt sereous drinking problems
. this requires at least some acting skills
. regrettably
, the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles
. the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters
. the movei isnt otherwise technically impressive
, whith a solid cinematography adn fine lighting
. bu the movie doesn
' t serve niether as a serious thriller
( because of its stupidity
) nor as comic entertainment
( because of its serious tone
)
. the only rela comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry
. the action sequences are all recycled
and thte effects are everything
but spectacular
. so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody
. unless you are a die
- hard schwartzenegger fan
, stay awya
. as for schwarzenegger
, he
' ll be back
.
