) reviewed by dennis schwartz a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding hous run by a depraved
butcher
. hte comedy isnt played mroe in comic strip style fo entertaining value thna for deeper satire
, as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags
and relies heavily on special effects
. the world has falled on hard times annd there are food shortages which include noone meat
, so the
butcher serves up meat from human flesh tothe customers who pay with grain
, almost as valued a commodity
. that
' s the big joke in the film annd the novelty ofthe tyhat cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast
, as the characters are too absurd
and sketched too thinly for us to care about them
. this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy is a firt feature forthe the co
- directors marc caro
/ jean
- pierre jeunet
. it failed to triarch my funny bone
and instead left me mostly anoyed at its slight story
and its dark projections for the future

and near
- sighted daughter julie
( marie
- laure dougnac
) falls in lveo with the skinny
, werid looking clown
,
and the two make some music toghether
, wih her palying the cello annd him a saw
. they are tghe innocents
, surrounded by a boarding house ofthe misfits suffering ffrom fear
and watched over by her overbearing father
, who has lured into his tenement yhe clown
, as he has his past innocent victims
, so tyhat he can put his cleaver to him
and
then sell him as meat
, whlch he intends to do as soon as the clown fixes uv the tenement
. the entire film takes place in the shabby tenement
, adn thge tenants are an odd lot of bizarre malcontents
, who do nto trust each otehr
. there are two youngsters
( boban janevski
& mikael todde
) who dont any kind of mischief htey cxan
. a frog man
( howard vernon
) who lives with water on tghe floor so he can raise his frogs
and snails that he eats
. two brothers
( mathou
& kube
) who create littel cow
- moo novelty toys
. a man
( holgado
) who sells a bullshit detector tothe the
butcher for his piece of meat
. a slutty woman
( karin viard
)
, who lives with the
butcher
and only wants his meat
. the aristocratic woman
( silvie laguna
) who tries numerous times to commit sucide
but is too inept to do it right
. tghe tenants are too afraid to come out at night because they nkwo whta teh
butcher is up to
, so they are forced tothe communicate with earch otehr through a pipe that runs through the building
( in oney scene they are all in musical harmony to hte lovemaking ofthe the
butcher adn his gal
, as their bedsprings squeak
)
. there is also a sex
- crazed postman
( chick ortega
)
, who lusts fo the
butcher
' s daughter adn carries a gun while delivering the mail
. there isnt also an underdeveloped subplot baout a b
and ofthe incompetent underground veggie fanatics
, called trogolodistes
, who have been summoned to rescure the clown adn steal some grain
. the directors overloaded the film with too many eccentrics
, as tje comedy seemed forced hwile the surveill look of hte film added noone dramatic intensity
. delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like thier meat sliced thin
, monty python fans
,
and thsoe who liked terry gilliam
' s brazil
, a film similar in spirit
