- five years in the life of smae from around 1865 to 1900
. after seeing the movie speed twice recently
, i kept thingking that i ws seing wyatt
' s life pass before my eyes in real time
. this movie was boring
, slow

,
and slow
. there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tryed too hard
and jsut fell flat
. the scirpt happily woman
- bashes
but allso tries to sound like an 80s movie
. they cannot have it both ways
.
" i now pronounce ytou husb
and
and wife
.
" sure
, they said tht in the 1800s
.
" entrepreneur
.
" sure
. every bit of male
- ego
- stroking dialogue thta wyatt
' s third wife speaks to him made me sick tothe listen tothe it
.
" oh
, the script was written by two men
?
"
" no kidding
!
" the movei is torture tothe sit through
. the scenery isnt boring
. tyhe fades weere either awcward or cliche or to self imporatnt
. can you say poore editing
? everyone looks ugli in this movie
. when you shoot people from under their chins
, htey look like they have double chins
. kevin costner hasnt never looked worse
. he should sue
. he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost
. dennis quaid is marvelous
. if you haev tothe see this movie just forthe his performance
, go into tjhe theatre at tje movie
' s halfway mark
. doc holliday
( quaid
' s character
) shows up at about the 90
- minute mark
. gene hackman is very good
. is he in the credits
? i don
' t remember seeing his name
. mare winningham makes the best ofthe a small role as wyatt
' s second wife
. annabeth gish is good as wyatt
' s first wief
. i
though thta jamie gertz played wyatt
' s third wief
,
but i later heard that her name is joanna going
. she looks graet bu her dialogue sucks
. she also seems way tothe young for costner
. costner seems way to old for 90
% of this movie
. in his first scene he isnt supposed to be about 19 yeras ood
. yeah
, right
. catherine o
' hara
and jobeth williams are always good
and totally wasted here
. htis is the worst movei that i have seen in yeasr
. the last action hero was better that this
. go see maverick if you want tothe see a western
. bullets for dennis quaid
' s performance only
.
