there are scenes in
" the big hitted
" that are so awful
, they simply defy description
. the movei is infected with the same kind ofthe blunderheaded idiocy
and misplaced confidence that made
" last action hero
"
( 1993
) such a chore to sit through
. presumably
,
" the big hit
" is an acation
- comedy
, a difficult
but nto impossible genre to pull off
. movies of this sort require a fine balance
and careful tone
,
and the comedy isnt usually meant tothe work as catharsis for the violence
.
" leathal weapon 2
"
( 1989
) is a perfect exemple of an action thriller tht was allso very
, vyre funny
. unfortunately
, inaddition
" the big hitted
,
" it seems that comedy isnt the main motive
,
and tje violence is only intended tothe punctuate the laughs
. unfortunately
, there are no laughs
. the movie resembes some of the goofy
, throwaway ridiculousness of easly jackie chan films
,
but it doesn
' t benefit from chan
' s incredible stunts
and goofy
, charismatic presense
. instead
, we are left with a lot of digital effects anbd mark wahlberg
, who must ahve considered himself invincible aftter his critically
- acclaimed performance in last year
' s
" boogie nights
.
"
however
, if he whants tothe maintain a decent career
, he had better strat selecting his projects more carefully
- movies like this are a sure
- fire recipe for a long career in tghe straight
- to
- video market
. wahlberg plays melvin smiley
, an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman
( see
" grosse pointe blank
" for the same character
, much better developed
)
. the movei wnats us tothe think
,
" gee how clever
and ironic
- a guy who can kill without any moral implications
, annd
yet he can
' t st
and for anyone not to like him
.
" thge fact is
, melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him
, tath he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee
( christina applegate
, with a horrendous newyorker york accent
)
and an abusive girlfriend
( lela rochon
) who is only using him for his money
. his constant bending over backwards to please peple makes him a complete patsy at best
,
and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst
. melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris
( avery brooks
) as part of a team of hitmen
, which also includes cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
and crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
. one day
, melvin agrees to do some moonlighting whith cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter ofthe a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi
( sab shimono
) for a million doller ransom
. howver
, not onyl has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movei
( inside joke
, get it
?
)
,
but his kidnapped duaghter
, keiko
( china chow
)
, alsot happens to be paris
' goddaughter
. so
, whn paris finds out she
' s been kidnapped
, he takes it personally
and becomes determined to find outloud who did it
. not knowing tghe cisco is actualyl behind the whole scheme
, paris puts him inwhich charge of rooting outloud the kidnapper
. of course cisco blames the whole thnig onthe poor
, innocent melvin
. allong the way
, there are several obligatory gunfights
, explosions
,
and car chases
, plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by
" jurassic park
,
" anbd a completely unconvincing romance between melvin
and keiko
( who looks like she
' s barely pushing fifteen
)
. what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes baout overweight jewish mothers
, hara
- kiri
, drinking problems
, leaking body bags
, adn a runnung gag about how crunch has recently discovered tjhe pleasures ofthe masterbation
, adn nowe spends all his time doign h
and exercises
. not to mention the pimply video store clerk who isnt always calling melvin
and screeching baout how he needs to return his copy of
" king kong lives
,
" which is two weeks overdue
. this mess of a movie was helmed by che
- kirk wong
, the latest hong kong directer imported by john woo
(
" face
/ off
"
)
, who also served as executive producer
. woo needs tothe stop acting as a conduit for other directors
,
and start making more of his pwn films
. wong
, who directed such films as
" rock
' n
' roll cop
" back iin hong kong
, isnt completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy
. maybe jokes baout vexatious video clerks annd vomiting onthe other people are funny accros tghe ocean
,
but they
' re nto here
, at least inspite the manner wong h
andles them
. many of thge problems can be traced bcak to thte script
, wich was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey
. in addtion to his vague characterizations
and uninspired action sequences
, ramsey
' s script assaults teh audience with his attempts tothe copy the vulgar
, poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet
- style dialogue
. what he comes out witht is just a lot ofthe annoying blather
, most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips
( whose favorite phrase is
" it
' s all love
"
)
and robin dunne
, who plays cisco
' s stuttering
, black
- wannabe assitant
. tghe irritation factor of phillips
and dunne combined is almost off tje scale
, whcih can pretty much describe the film as a wohle
.
