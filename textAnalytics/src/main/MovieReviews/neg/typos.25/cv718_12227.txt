there are scenes in
" the big hit
" thast are so awful
, they simpley defy description
. the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy
anbd misplaced confidence that made
" last action hero
"
( 1993
) such a chore tothe sit through
. presumably
,
" the big hit
" is an action
- comedy
, a difficult
but not impossible genre to pull off
. movies ofthe this sort require a fine balance
and careful tone
,
and the comedy is usualy meant to work as catharsis for hte violence
.
" leathal weapon 2
"
( 1989
) isnt a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very
, very funny
. unfortunately
, in
" the big hit
,
" it seems that comedy is tyhe main motive
,
and the voilence is only intended to punctuate the laughs
. unfortunately
, htere are no laughs
. the movie resembes some ofthe the goofy
, throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films
,
but it doesn ' t benefit from chan ' s incredible stunts
and goofy
, charismatic presence
. instead
, we are left with a lot of digital effects
and mark wahlberg
, who must haev considered himself invincible affter his critically
- acclaimed performance in last year ' s
" boogie nights
.
"
however
, if he wants tothe maintain a decent carreer
, he had better start selecting his projects more carefully
- movies liek thsi are a sure
- frie recipe for a long carreer in tje straight
- to
- video market
. wahlberg plays melvin smiley
, an amiable guy who also happens tothe be a proffesional hitman
( see
" grosse pointe blank
" for tghe same character
, much better developed
)
. the movie wnats us to htikn
,
" gee how clever
adn ironic
- a guy who can kill without any moral implications
,
and
yet he can ' t stand for anyone not to like him
.
" the fact is
, melvin isnt so desperate to keep people from not liking him
, that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee
( christina applegate
, with a horrendous new york accent
)
and an abusive girlfriend
( lela rochon
) who is only using him for his money
. his constant bending over backwards tothe please people makes him a complete patsy at best
,
and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst
. melvin is employed exculsivly by a crime boss named paris
( avery brooks
) as part of a team of hitmen
, whitch allso includes cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
and crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
. one day
, melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi
( sab shimono
) for a million dollar ransom
.
however
, not only has jiro nishi lost all his mnoey producing a big hollywood movei
( inside joke
, get it
?
)
,
but his kidnapped daughter
, keiko
( china chow
)
, aslo happens to be paris ' goddaughter
. so
, when paris finds out she ' s beeen kidnapped
, he takes it personaly
adn becomes determined to find out who did it
. nto knowing the cisco is actually behind yhe hwole scheme
, paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper
. of course cisco blames teh wohle thing on poor
, innocent melvin
. along the way
, there are sevral obligatory gunfights
, explosions
,
and car chases
, plus a literal cliffhanger inpsired by
" jurassic park
,
"
and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin
and keiko
( who looks like she ' s barely pushing fifteen
)
. whta tyhe movei passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers
, hara
- kiri
, drinking problems
, leaking body bags
,
and a running gag about how crunch has recently dicovered the pleasures ofthe masturbation
,
and nowe spends all his time doing hand exercises
. nto to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin
anbd screeching about how he needs tothe return his copy ofthe
" king kong lives
,
" which is two weeks overdue
. tihs mess of a movie was helmed by che
- kirk wong
, the latest hong kong director imported by john woo
(
" face
/ off
"
)
, who also served as executive producer
. woo needs to stpo acting as a conduit for other directors
,
and start making more of his own films
. wong
, who directed such films as
" rock ' n ' roll cop
" back inspite hong kong
, is completely tone deaf wehn it comes to comedy
. maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks
and vomiting on other peple are funny accros hte ocean
,
but they ' re not here
, at least in the manner wong handles them
. many of the problems cxan be traced back to tyhe script
, which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey
. in addition tothe his vague characterizations
and uninspired acation sequences
, ramsey ' s script assaults yhe audience with his attempts tothe copy tjhe vulgar
, poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet
- style dialogue
. what he comes out witht is just a lot of annoying blather
, most of whihc spews from the lips ofthe lou diamond phillips
( whose favorite phrase is
" it ' s all love
"
)
and robin dunne
, who plays cisco ' s stuttering
, black
- wannabe assistant
. the irritation factor of phillips
annd dunne conbined is almost off tyhe scale
, which can preety much describe the film as a whole
.
