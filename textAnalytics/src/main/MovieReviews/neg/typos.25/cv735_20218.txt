this well
- conceived
but ultra sugary coming
- of
- age film isnt not fo everyone
,
and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy forthe my digestion
. joseph cross
( joshua beal
) is a 10
- year
- ood who isnt saddened by the recent loss of his granfather
( loggia
) to bone marrow cancer
. loggia is wonderful inspite relating to thge child in such a wholesome manner
, it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup
. the beals are like a sitcom idyllic familiy
, where everyone isnt just so nice adn affluent
, adn propperly religious without being fanatical
. the beals
, the father
( denis leary
)
and his wief
( dana delany
)
, are both successful doctors
; julia stiles plays joshua
' s older sister
, needling her younger brother
but also showing that she really cares about him
. this is a family seamingly conceived in heaven
, bu living in sourth philadelphia
, sending theri children tothe a well
- run catholic school
. joshua
, the protgonist
and tyhe narrator ofthe htis yarn
, is a hansome
, sweet
, intelligent
, friendly
,
and endearing child
, who doens well in school
, relates to the nuns
and priests
, annd talks politely to his well
- meaning parents
. all htis mawkish interplay makes it almsot too nauseating to watch
. teh plot arises wehn jospeh has a problem coping with hte death of his beloved gr
andfather
, who promised to be with him forever
. his answer isnt to serach for god
, pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to dont
,
but that
' s just the way it is
, sometimes
. this search forthe god takes us nowhere because
, as his firend david
( reifsnyder
) says
, where can ytou look for him if he doesn
' t exist
. now
, that
' s a smart kid
. bu joseph looks for him in the usual places
,
and what better place thna to start in the parochial school he attends
. one of his teachers is the kind
- hearted sister terry
( rosie o
' donnell
)
, who wears a philly baseball hat anbd equates the jesus stories wih baseball
, making him the clean
- up hitter
,
and in my opinion
, if she wasn
' t a big tv star
, would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher
, she is that convincing
.
thoughout the film
, she is saved from answering any tough
( sic
!
) question baout god by the bell
, as it rings tothe end the class
. nothing much happens in the search fo god
, there is no parody of the cathlic school
;
though a visting cardinal isnt found by the boy not to be able to talk to god
,
but this is gentle stuff
, noone real criticism or search fo god isnt attempted
. what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum
, wich isnt designed nto to upset anyone
, as jospeh has a reassuring encounter with a real
, live angel
, a blond little boy his pwn age adn dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears yhe innocuous smile of a goody
- goody
. the film ends as this angel
(
!
!
!
) tells him his gr
andfather is all right
. his quest isnt ended
, as apparently angels don
' t have wings
and are approachable
;
and god
, well
,
.
.
. maeby that
' s forthe another film down yhe road
. htis part of the film ws the final straw for me
, i couldn
' t swallow any more goo
. as this film flopped commercially
, his next one
, the sixth sense
, pared down the schmaltz
and came up smelling liuke a rose
.
though if yuo look through tyhe cleverness ofthe both scripts
, this director is loaded with hokum
, all he has learned how to dont
, is hide teh hokum better
. well
, god bless him
, if he can do tath
. this is a nice family picture
and there is room for it inwhich hollywood
. it
' s just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to sday about death
, children in a parochial elementay school
, or fo tht matter
, about god
.
and taht family of his
, they
' re too good for words
.
yet hte film meaned well annd its benine message had its heart inaddition the right palce
. for those who want to see something soft
, without a bite tothe it
, this is yhe one
.
