starship troopers is a bad movie
. i mean
, a really
, really
, bad movei
. not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood
, gore
and body parts shown on teh screen
, it blissfully jumps over that line
, apparently unaware thast the movei trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen yearm olds
( of wich i saw many inthe the theatre
)
. looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence
, we are left with a movie wih a thin plot at best
, noone strong lead characters
, a blatant disregard for phisics
,
and a very obvious naziesque theme
. that being said
, onto hte review
: the movie starts withthe a propag
anda message from the federation
( who
' s logo bears a
* strong
* resemblence to a nazi german eagle
)
, urging the populace to go off anbd fight the bugs
, who are attempting to destroy earth
. the film shows large rallies with young childrens in attendance
, pledging allegience to the federation
( again
, sound familar
?
)
. as the movie progresses
, we are shown terror tactict training
, as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm
,
and throws a nife through anyother
' s h
and
. eventually
, the recruits embark on a jouney to a location twpo thirds of the way accross tghe milky way galaxy
, to fight the bugs on their home planet
. as our faster than light travelling
" heroes
" arrive on planet
, htey drop onto the planet
,
and burst our of their craft br
andishing
.
.
.
" what
?
" you say
,
" lazer beam weapons
? sonic weapons
? phasers
? photon cannons
?
"
. nope
, htey hop out br
andishing good ood 1997 machine guns
, pump action rifles
, anbd tactical nuclear weapons
! i guess a lot ofthe physics money r
& d went into travel
and not weaponry
. as the assault begins
, our group of troopers are seen walking inaddition a straight line thru a box canyon
. twpo munbers of the group notice rocks slipping annd falling above them
, anbd oen even sees a streak fly by
, bu disregards it as nothing
. this ofthe course
, leads tothe more massive carnage
, blood shed
,
and graphic depictions ofthe limbs
and heads bieng ripped adn severed from their bodies
. agina
, i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons
! in the end
, we see neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris burst onto tjhe scene in wqat could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat
, hat
,
and gloves
. he doens a vulcan mind meld on tyhe giant slug
,
and
then proclaims that the bugs are scared
! this sets the troopers into a frenzy
, as they are now oen step closer tothe completing their goal
, total genocide of a species
( again
, sound familiar
?
?
)
. i haev tried very hard not tothe step on
and spoil thge plot with htis review
, bu given it
' s non
- exsistance
, i may have anyway
. i could go onthe for pages ripping htis movie apart
, bu don
' t want to bore you too badly
. in short
, i felt as if i were subjected tothe a mix vetween a pro
- nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies
, a drivers education accident scene film
,
and a complete blank screen
( the plot
, of course
)
. i wouldn
' t recommend this movei tothe anyone
, anyhwere
, under any circumstance
