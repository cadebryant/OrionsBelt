shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen
. it isnt both humorous
and romantic in a vyre unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience forthe the nearly 2
and adn a half hours that it occupies
. tath is
,
however
, not tothe say it is a good film
, a quality prodcution or anything of the sort
. shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be veyr little qualiyt or original work
. the finest sign ofthe this may be the plot
, in looking bakc
, htere seems tothe be littel more than a thin
, predictable plot taht is only carried by tghe protrayal ofthe people that we revere in our history books
. philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) owns 1 ofthe the 2 theatres in london
. it is at the peak ofthe tje royal theatre era
, anbd queen elizabeth
( the recently damed judi dench
, by
, appropriately enough
, queen elizabeth ii
) is very much a fan
. howver
, to direcly quote the film
, he has
" cash flow problems
.
" through a long set of events
, it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough tothe pay off his debts
. so
, mr
. henslowe imploys thte young playwright
, william shakespeare
( joseph fiennes
) to pen a commedic production
. howver
, the young writer has a savere case of writer
' s block
,
and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well
. he hasnt the title infact mind
, romeo adn ethel
, the pirate
' s daugter
( even that joke loses steam after a while
)
but cant
' t seem to put words to paper
. hten
, as only hollywood could hvea it
, thru a long set of twisted events
, he meets viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and falls madly iin love
, thus curing his writter
' s block
. there are many otehr littel issues that mr
. henslowe encounters
,
but they all pan outloud to be much ado baout nothing
. the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that oen of tghe messages given is that a show should nto allways be credited to it
' s author
. ironically
, that couldn
' t be truer here
. the grat scenes that will sweep audiences away are nto the scenes thta fit in the plot
,
but rether the recitals ofthe shakespearean lines by actors playing actors
. one ofthe the most breathtaking moments in this film does nto involve the character ofthe shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner
, bu rather 2 young childern named romeo
and juliet who chose to end their pwn lives in the name of love
. so it is that i am offended by thge fact that marc norman
and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production
,
and the nmae william shakespeare isnt no were to be seen beyond a character
' s nmae in the credits
. the acting in this entertaining
yet poor film is oftenly thin to the point that it would nto have survived even in queen elizabeth
' s theatres
. joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall
though
. he is tragically unbeleivable
and comically bad
. gwyneth paltrow is littel more than satisfactory in her lead postion as well
.
however
, the supporting cast does almost sive the day
. geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredable
and judi dench isnt breathtaking
. they both seem to have shown that as proven actors htey could survive iin this film of weak links
. you will alsot find a vyre ogod performance by ben affleck in his first rela role sicne good will hunting
( no
, armageddon doesn
' t qualify as real acting
.
)
.
and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well
.
but not even tehy could sive this sad excuse for a film
, so it rimaniss plagued by poor performances
. when all isnt said
and done
, shakespeare in loev is onyl worth the trip if you wanna to be entertained
. howver
, as the film so kindly pointed out
, entertainment may be fun
, bu it isn
' t nessasarily quality
.
and htis certainly isn
' t quality
. perhaps this may be best compaired tothe a john grisham novel
, as a dear firend of mine often does compare things tothe his wokr
. simpley put
, it is far
- fetched
, poorly crafted
,
but very intertaining
.
