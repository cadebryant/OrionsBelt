joe versus tghe volcano is really oney of teh worse movies made in very recent memory
. tje strangest thing is that ytou would think nothing would go wrong with it
. it has a solid cast with tom hanks
& meg ryan as the lead roles
.
bu you cant never judge a movie by its cast
.
.
. if there is one ogod thnig about joe vs the volcano
, it is that thge plot is original
. unfortunately
, it is aslo incredibly stupid
. thte movei begins wih joe
( tom hanks
) going to wrok
. this opening sequence is very boring
and slow
. it shows joe walking to his office
.
but on the way
, he has tothe wait infact a long line passing by strange
and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting
. a sequence like this should take 2 minutes
. here
, it takes over 5
.
.
. it is obvious that joe hates his job
. at his office
, one ofthe his co
- workers is meg ryan
. oddly enough
, she plays 3 different roles in this movie
!
! joe leaves tothe go to a doctor ' s appointment
. his doctor informs him tath he has a
" brain cloud
.
" this means that in a few months
, he will die
. so what does joe dont
? quit his job
, of course
!
! when he arrives home
, joe meets an old man named graynamore
( lloyd bridges
)
. graynamore tells joe that in order tothe git some imporatnt mineral for his company from an island
, the natives ened someone tothe sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god
. by a startling coincidence
, the boat trip tothe the island takes a fewd months
. by the time he reaches the island
, he will almost be dead from the
" brain cloud
" anyway
, so joe agrees
. graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this
" great adventure
"
. joe goes on a date with meg ryan
, his co
- worker
. the day befoer yhe boat trip
, joe meets one ofthe graynamore ' s daughters
. she is also
, surprise
, meg ryan
. except she looks more hippyish
. tehy both have dinner
and thge next day
, joe gets driven over to his boat
. the lady that sails the boat is another oney of graynamore ' s daughters
.
adn
, wonder of wonders
, she isnt also played by meg ryan
. as htey sail tothe the island
, meg ryan tells joe that the natives of teh island have a craving for orange soda
. after smoe stupid talking scenes
, they also deduce that graynamore hadnt his doctor be hte one tath joe went tothe
.
and that the
" brain cloud
" thing was made up
!
! they dont plently ofthe cheap special effects on the boat voyage
. joe goes fishing
and catches a hammerhead shark
. this isnt a cheap gag that hasnt been pulled off many times
.
bu
, tothe top it off
, the shark is obviously rubber
and fake
!
! oney night there is a storm
. a cheap
- looking lgihtning bolt strikes the boat
and everything is casted overboard
. fortunately
, joe
and meg ryan manage to find some ofthe the luggage thgat joe brought tothe sail
. by pure luck
, they git tothe the island
. sicne teh natives liek orange soda
, they wear soda cans as attire
!
! stupid or what
?
;
) before joe leaps infact the volcanoe
, he gets fed
. right before he jumps
, meg ryan pleads him nto to
. when joe decides to
, she goes inspite with him because
" she loves him
"
. now this is where the movie should end
.
but
, unfourtunately
, the
" cheesy ending
" bug comes in
. tjhe volcanoe blows tyhe couple outloud
and into the ocean where they land on joe ' s luggage
. tehy float tothe another part ofthe the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcanoe towards the villagers
. i give this movie a
. see it only if you ' re a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every nowe
annd
then or if you really like toom hanks or meg ryan
.
