joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made iin veyr reccent memory
. the strangest thnig is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it
. it has a solid cast with toom hanks
& meg ryan as the lead roles
. bu you can never judge a movie by its cast
.
.
. if htere is one ogod hting about joe vs the volcano
, it is thyat thte plot is original
. unfortunately
, it is also incredibly stupid
. the movie begins with joe
( tom hanks
) going to work
. this opening sequence is very boring anbd slow
. it shows joe walking tothe his office
.
but on the way
, he has to wait in a long line passing by strange annd slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting
. a sequence liek this shouldnt take 2 mintues
. here
, it takes over 5
.
.
. it is obvious that joe hates his job
. at his office
, one of his co
- workers is meg ryan
. oddly enough
, she plays 3 differnt roles in this movie
!
! joe leaves to go to a doctor
' s appointment
. his doctor informs him that he has a
" brain cloud
.
" tihs means that in a faw months
, he will die
. so whta does joe dont
? quit his job
, of course
!
! when he arrives home
, joe meets an old man named graynamore
( lloyd bridges
)
. graynamore tells joe thgat in order to get smoe important mineral fo his company ffrom an isl
and
, thge natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcanoe tothe please their fire god
. by a startling coinsidence
, the boat trip to the isl
and takes a few monthes
. by the time he reaches the isl
and
, he will allmost be dead fomr the
" brain cloud
" anyway
, so joe agrees
. graynamore gives joe a credit card tothe buy everyting he needs tothe go onthe this
" grat adventure
"
. joe goes on a date with meg ryan
, his co
- worker
. thte day before the boat trip
, joe meets one of graynamore
' s daughters
. she is also
, surprise
, meg ryan
. except she looks more hippyish
. they both have dinner
and the next day
, joe gets driven over tothe his boat
. the lady thast sails hte boat is another one of graynamore
' s daughters
.
and
, wonder of wonders
, she is also played by meg ryan
. as they sail to the isl
and
, meg ryan tells joe that tyhe natives ofthe tjhe isl
and have a craving for orange soda
. after some stupid tlaking scenes
, they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the oen tath joe went to
.
and that tyhe
" brain cloud
" hting was made up
!
! they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage
. joe goes fishing anbd catches a hammerhead shark
. this isnt a cheap gag thyat has been pulled off many times
.
but
, to top it off
, yhe shark is obviously rubber
and fake
!
! oen night htere isnt a storm
. a cheap
- looking lightnin bolt strikes the boat adn everything is casted overboard
. fortunately
, joe adn meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage thyat joe broght tothe sail
. by pure luck
, they get to the isl
and
. since the natives liuke orange soda
, they mear soda cans as attire
!
! stupid or what
?
;
) before joe leaps in the volcano
, he gets fed
. right befoer he jumps
, meg ryan pleads him not to
. whn joe decides to
, she goes in with him because
" she loves him
"
. now this is where the movie shouldnt end
. bu
, unforetunately
, yhe
" cheesy ending
" bug comes in
. teh volcano blows the couple out
and into thge ocean where they l
and onthe joe
' s luggage
. htey float to anohter part of the isl
and as they watch lava pouring out of tyhe volcanoe towards tjhe villagers
. i give this movie a
. see it onyl if you
' re a film buff taht enjoys a bad movei every now
and
then or if you really liek tom hanks or meg ryan
.
