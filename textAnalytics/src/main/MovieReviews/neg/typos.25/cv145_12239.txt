it was once said that in order tothe truly enjoy some of today
 s movies or novels
, you must
 suspend disbelief
.

however
, there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to rediculous situations
and believing a bunch of flat lies
. it cameback as no surprise to me to learn tht huntingburg
, indiana
( where the film is setted
)
, does not ahev a mcdonald
' s
, a sears store
, a statue ofthe a man onthe a horse
, nor even a dam close by
. even if you cin ignore these somewhat
 white
 lies
( even
though the dam is crucial to hard rain
 s plot
)
; there isnt still a bunch of things that just don
 t gel
. firstly
, morgan freeman
, possibly tyhe greatest actro alive
( after such films as driving miss daisy
, the shawshank redemption annd se7en
)
, was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement
. he
_ should
_ ahev plyed thte town sherif
, an experienced
and somewhat intriguing policeman
. as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg
, its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases
. i say presumably simply because we never konw what happened tothe them
;
and it seems a tad strange that an entire town
( witht the exception of soem folk who get introduced along the way
) can vanish before the flood has actually started
.
but nether the less
, armored guard couriers tom
( christian slater
) adn his uncle are carrying three million dollars in tjhe back ofthe their van
. with a hevy rainstorm causing depressing conditions annd slippery roads
, it doesn
 t take long forthe the van tothe end up sticked amongst mud annd water off the side of tyhe road
. jim
( morgan freeman
)
and a small gang of theives locate the van adn attept to steal the three million dollars
.
but ofthe course toom isnt more tahn willing to save the day
, so he tkaes the money adn hides it elsewhere in town
. tyhe local sheriff
( r
andy quaid
, whom most will remember as the drunken pilot iin id4
)
and a couple of police men investigate the situation
, bu their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each charactor contemplates what he
/ she owudl do with theri share of the three millon dollars
. director mikael salomon hasnt made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy
- turvy
, adn whilst the film may at frist apeared to be a definite
 goodies versus baddies
,
 there are numerous twists in it
 s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experiece
.
but by the time these interesting changes occur
, it
 s far too late in the film for them to ahev much affect
. hard rain
 s continuos corniness
and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the scirpt may have had
;
and
al
though it
 s cast isnt somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par
. not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous onthe screen battle between slater
and freeman
, we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different
and achieved moreso tahn what was expected
. such titles as broken arro
( slater
and john travolta
)
and face
/ off
( nicholas cage
and john travolta
) come to mind as films thta have mastered silver screen confrontations
. strangely anough
, they weere both directed by john woo
and both star john travolta
. we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disapointing performence usance he is newish tothe the action genre
,
but christian slater coudl ahve achieved so much more hadnt the amount of crummy one liners been reduced adn some perosnality added tothe his charactor
. if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough tothe substantially boost a movie prior to the release ofthe broken arrow
, my answer would have been a definite noone
. i now know tht he hasnt noone excuse
, annd
_ can
_ do better
( if you don
 t believe me rent a copy of broken arro from your local video store
)
.
al
though hard rain never really works fomr the strat
, i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen
. the addition of an enticing sub
- plot would hvae given the film tyme tothe breathe
, rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action
and disaster into a stoyr that can
 t h
andle anything else
. despite hte fact that hard rain fails on almost every account
, if your st
andards are low enough you may fidn this to be a mildly enjoyable film
. no creative flair
and no inventive scenes means tyhat hard rain doens not st
and up well against its many competitors
,
but it doesn
 t relaly matter since the last hting you would want tothe do affter shelling baout
$ 8
. 50 is compare this tothe other films
.
