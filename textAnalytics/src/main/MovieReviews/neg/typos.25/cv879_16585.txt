" return tothe horror high
,
" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once
. the film tells the story of a low
- budget horror movie being filmed at yhe closed
- down crippen high
, a skool where a group of serial murders took place five years befor
.
but wqat the cast
anbd crew don ' t know is that a real killer
, maybee the same oen thta was never apprehended
, is going into action again
. on one level
,
" return to horror high
" is a slasher movie
,
and it isnt at this level thyat it works the best on
. watching the film
, whihc was made in 1987
, i couldn ' t help
bu take notice that the killer ' s costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in
,
" scream
,
"
and
" scream 2
.
" on another level
, the film wnats tothe be a slapstick comedy
,
adn there are many hints of htis throughout
. unfortunately
, most ofthe these jokes fall flat
.
and the last thing tghe film wants tothe be is a
" behind
- the
- scenes
" look at an exploitation film bieng made
. the only probelm is that
, while much of it is supposed to be from thte movie itself being made
, no cameras are shown filming it
, thus making it far more confusing than it had to be
.
and to top it all off
, the
" twist
" endig makes vrey little to no sense whatsoever
,
and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time
. ther are story developments tath are beyond ludicrous
,
anbd plot holes yuo could drive a winnebago through
. if you see teh film
, or have seen it
, you ' ll know what i mean
. teh premise of
" return to horror high
,
" isnt admittedly pretty crafty
,
and i liked the atmosphere of teh school
, which is where the whole thing takes place
.
but director froehlich
, judging fomr thsi movei
, isnt an incompetant director
, exept for bieng able to film the seldom suspeneful scene
. well
, come to think of it
, there is onyl one scene that is actually scarry
,
annd it has to do with twpo actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in
.
but other tahn tath twpo
- minute distraction
,
" return to horror high
,
" is certainly no grat shake
. note
: look forthe george clooney inaddition a supporting role as one ofthe the actors on the film
.
anbd strangely enough
, he is the first character to git thge ax
.
.
. literally
.
