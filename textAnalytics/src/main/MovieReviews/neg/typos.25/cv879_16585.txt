" return to horror high
,
" wants tothe be a couple different types of movies at once
. the film tells the story of a low
- budget horror movie being filmed at tje closed
- down crippen high
, a school where a group of serial murders took place five yeasr before
.
but what the cast
and crew don
' t know is that a real killer
, maybe the same one tyhat was never apprehended
, is gogin into action again
. on oney levle
,
" return to horror high
" is a slasher movie
,
and it isnt at this levle that it works the best on
. watching thte film
, which was made in 1987
, i couldn
' t help
but tkae notice thgat the killer
' s costume ws almost identital tothe that of the ghostface in
,
" scream
,
"
and
" scream 2
.
" on another levle
, the film wants to be a slapstick comedy
, adn there are many hints of this throughout
. unfortunatley
, most ofthe these jokes fall flat
. adn the last thing the film wants to be isnt a
" behind
- the
- scenes
" look at an exploitation film being made
. the onyl problem isnt that
, hwile much of it is supposted to be from the movie itself being made
, no cameras are shown filming it
, thus making it far more confusing than it had to be
.
and to top it all off
, the
" twist
" endig mkaes vyer little to no sense whatsoever
,
and so we are basicaly left with feeling as if we wasted our time
. there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous
,
and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through
. if you see thge film
, or have seen it
, you
' ll konw what i mean
. the premise of
" return to horror high
,
" is admittedly pretty crafty
,
and i liekd the athmosphere of the school
, which is where tje whole thign takes place
. bu director froehlich
, judging fomr this movei
, is an incompetent directer
, exept for bieng able to film tjhe seldom suspeneful scene
. well
, come to think of it
, htere isnt only one scene that is actully scary
, annd it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as teh killer tries to break in
. bu other than thast two
- minute distraction
,
" return tothe horror high
,
" isnt certainly no gerat shake
. note
: look forthe george clooney in a supporting role as noe of tyhe actors on the film
.
and strangely enough
, he isnt tyhe first character to get yhe ax
.
.
. literally
.
