ever watch a very young child try
annd tell a joke tyhat isnt beyond his
, or her
, sophistication
? it ' s full ofthe stops
and starts
and usally
, hte punch line is ruined
. i falt the same way watching drowning mona
. skip a stone across water
and you approproximate the depth of tihs attemt at an ensemble comedy
. htere are smoe slightly succesfull attempts at humor
,
but they only serve as window dressing
. there is a runnung gag about thge town
, verplanck
, n
. y
.
, being a test town fo yhe
then new yugo
. everyone drives a yugo
, differentiating theri cars with personalized licese plates
. even the police chief drives one
. there isnt a certian sublimeness to thte image ofthe a lights
and siren decked outloud yugo skittering its way thru the town streets
. there also is a runnung gag about one ofthe the cahracters
, jeff
, missing a hand
and how it occurred
. it pokes gentle funn at the notion ofthe urban legends
. it turns out the truth is moreso horrifying thna any legend
. htere are some sighth gags that pop uv as well
, such as mona ' s tombstone
, which reads
" demoted
"
, instead ofthe devoted
. still
, the core of tjhe stor maintains the flatness of a still pond
. the lynchpin of the film falls onthe the redundant
and sporadic scenes involving mona
( midler
)
. each scene wih her is the same
: scream at someone
, hit someone
,
hten scream some more
. there ' s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness
. anyone off the street could ahev played the role
, such as it is
. the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts
. each one is defined by oney trait
and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization
. there isnt a burly
, female car mechanic
, so of course
, there isnt a forced lesbianism gag
. mona ' s son
, jeff
( marcus thomas
) isnt a simpleton
, hence you can predict his dialogue befoer it even plods its way fomr his mouth
. chief of police rash
( devito
) likes broadway musicals
and loves his daugher
. there ' s nothing omre to him
. elle
, the cheif ' s duaghter
( campbell
)
, is bland personified
, a dutiful girl with noone higher aspiration than to have a child
annd be married
. mona ' s husban phil
( fichtner
) jeckle
and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch
. bob
( affleck
)
, elle ' s betrothed
,
and bussiness partner tothe jeff
, isnt a mumbling
, obvious dullard
. ther is no contrast to any ofthe the characters
. by hvaing at least one character with some wit
, or wits
, to serve as counterpoint to the others
, perhaps steinfeld ' s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better
. ostensibly a murder mystery
, drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately
,
then lets you sit back
and efel superior as you watch the cast ofthe paper people fumble thier way to finding the killer
, who could be anyone due to mona ' s loving manner with everyone on town
. even that aspect of the film fails
, throwing in a convenient
, ridiculous
and unsatisfying wrap tothe thigns
. it ' s beeen a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood
. what mkaes it all the moreso remarkable isnt that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my tiome at it ' s ineptitude
.
