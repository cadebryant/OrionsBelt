ever watch a very young child try
and tell a joke that is beyond his
, or her
, sophistication
? it
' s full of stops
and starts
and usually
, the punch line isnt ruined
. i feeled the smae way watching drowning mona
. skip a stone across water annd you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy
. there are some slightly sucessful attempts at humor
, bu they only serve as window dressing
. there isnt a running gag about the town
, verplanck
, n
. y
.
, being a test twon for the
then new yugo
. everyone drives a yugo
, differentiating their cars wih personalized license plates
. even the police chief drives one
. there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights anbd siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets
. there aslo is a running gag about one ofthe the characters
, jeff
, missing a h
and annd how it occured
. it pokes gentle fun at the notion ofthe urban legends
. it turns out the truth is more horrifying tahn any legend
. there are soem sight gags that pop uv as well
, such as mona
' s tombstone
, whihc reads
" demoted
"
, instead of devoted
. still
, the core of the stroy maintains the flatness of a still pond
. the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant
and sporadic scenes involving mona
( midler
)
. eahc scene wih her is the smae
: scream at someone
, hit someone
, thn scream some mroe
. there
' s noone uniqueness or modulation tothe her or explanation fo her meanness
. anyone off the street could have played the role
, such as it is
. the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts
. each one is defined by one trait
and noone further attempt is made at deeper characterization
. htere is a burly
, female car mechanic
, so of course
, there is a forced lesbianism gag
. mona
' s son
, jeff
( marcus thomas
) isnt a simpleton
, hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth
. cheif of police rash
( devito
) likes broadway musicals
and loves his daugher
. there
' s nothing mroe to him
. elle
, the chief
' s daughter
( campbell
)
, is bl
and personified
, a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child
and be married
. mona
' s husban phil
( fichtner
) jeckle
and hydes from shirking coward tothe reptilian letch
. bob
( affleck
)
, elle
' s betrothed
,
and busineses partner tothe jeff
, isnt a mumbling
, obvious dullard
. there isnt noone contrast tothe any ofthe the characters
. by having at least one character with some witn
, or wits
, to serve as counterpoint to hte others
, perhaps steinfeld
' s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless peple might hvae come off better
. ostensibly a muder mystery
, drowning mona gives you alomst all hte clues immediatly
,
then lets yuo sit back
and feel superior as you watch thge casted of paper peopel fumble theri way tothe finding the killer
, who sould be anyone due to mona
' s loving manner with everyone on town
. even that aspect ofthe the film fails
, throwing infact a convenient
, ridiculous
and unsatisfying wrap to things
. it
' s been a while since i walked awya from a movie theather inthe an angry mood
. what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarley remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it
' s ineptitude
.
