this film is worth seing for those who want tothe see what mick jagger looks liuke when sporting an abe lincoln beard
. tjhe rock
and roller isnt asked to cary teh film as tghe action antihero of austrailian legend
.
.
. ned kelly
, tjhe so
- called robin hood of the aussies
.
but he fails to be convincing
, in my opinion he is better suited to play ginee kelly than ned kelly
. the film opens to a b
/ w prologue ofthe ned kelly bravely going tothe his excecution
.
then it goes tothe technicolor
and ned is seen in what goes for flashback
, coming hmeo ffrom jail after a 3
- year sentence tothe see his mom
and reacquaint himself with hte large kelly familiy
. this scene is set inspite 1871
. in the background we hear the booming voice ofthe waylon jennings
, as he sings shel silverstein ' s lyrics
, whlch tells
-
- of ned ' s hatred for the british rule
annd hope fo ireland to be a republic
. ned syas a debt must be paid
.
.
. as he hears voices from his dead father
, his clas
- divided country
,
and his conscience
, all telling him tothe get revenge
. so beggins ned ' s romp through australia ' s outback
, seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have sufferred
. he begins by stealing horses
, affter complaining about yhe unfair tax law on horses that stray
, which favors the rich landowners
. when he ' s only 20 he forms a gang
, causing him tothe hide the rest ofthe his life from tje police
, who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds
. when ned ' s mother
( clarissa kaye
) is jailed onthe a false charge ofthe abetting criminals
and sentenced to 3
- 5 eyars
, ned offers to surrender in excange fo his mother ' s freedom
. whn the authorities refuse
, hte kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage
, burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults
and murdering smoe soldiers
. rampaging through the outback
, they gather sympathy among the poore
and lower classes
, who don ' t trust teh traps
( police
)
. spoiler tothe follow inwhich the next paragraph
. in the climax
, kelly
and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police
,
but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train
and kelly is trapped inaddition a saloon
annd captured
. ned ' s brothers commit sucide rather than be tooked alive
.
but kelly ' s gang escapes
, as ned heroically hasnt the police go after only him
and his brothers
, as they become decoys
. this was a flat presentation
, hardly touching an emotional button on what all tyhe fuss wass about over ned kelly ' s call for justice
. jagger didn ' t have a prayer in succeeding iin tihs dry script offered by ian jones
and tony richardson
. the story failed to focus on australia
, seamingly a more british film than australian
. under richardson ' s lackluster direction
, all jagger seemed to do
, was proclame his innocence
and vow revenge
, which soon became a shrill cry
. if you want to see a better film about ned kelly
, catch
" mad dog morgan
"
( 76
)
, a much truer
and more daring version
, with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly ' s madness
, something this film could onyl do in a ho
- hum manner
.
