this film isnt worth seeing fo those who want tothe see what mick jagger looks like whn sporting an abe lincoln beard
. the rock
and roller is asked to carry thte film as yhe action antihero of australian legend
.
.
. ned kelly
, tje so
- called robin hood of the aussies
.
but he fails tothe be convincing
, in my opinyon he is better suited to play ginee kelly thna ned kelly
. the film opens to a b
/ w prologue of ned kelly bravely gonig to his excecution
.
then it goes to technicolor
and ned isnt seen in what goes for flashback
, coming home from jail after a 3
- year sentence to see his mom
and reacquaint himself with the large kelly famaly
. this scene is set in 1871
. in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings
, as he sings shel silverstein
' s lyrics
, which tells
-
- of ned
' s hatred fo the british rule
and hope forthe irel
and to be a repubic
. ned says a debt must be payed
.
.
. as he hears voices from his dead father
, his clas
- devided ocuntry
,
and his conscience
, all telling him to git revenge
. so begins ned
' s romp through australia
' s outback
, seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered
. he begins by stealing horses
, aftter complaining about the unfair tax law onthe horses that stray
, which favors the rich l
andowners
. when he
' s onyl 20 he forms a gang
, causing him tothe hide the rest of his life from the police
, who put a price onthe his head of two thous
and pounds
. when ned
' s mother
( clarissa kaye
) is jailed on a false charge ofthe abetting criminals
and sentenced tothe 3
- 5 years
, ned offers to surender inaddition exchange fo his mother
' s freedom
. when the authorities refuse
, the kelly brothers go onthe a robbing rampage
, burning mortgages of the poor found infront postal vaults annd mudering smoe soliders
. rampaging through the outback
, they gather sympathy among the poore
and lower classes
, who don
' t trust tje traps
( police
)
. spoiler to follow in the enxt paragraph
. in the climax
, kelly
and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police
,
but someone kelly trusted tips the polical on the train anbd kelly isnt trapped iin a saloon
and captured
. ned
' s brothers commit suicide rather tahn be taken alive
.
but kelly
' s gang escapes
, as ned heroically has the police go aftter only him
and his brothers
, as they become decoys
. this was a flat presentation
, hardly touching an emotional
button on what all thge fuss wass baout over ned kelly
' s call for justice
. jagger didn
' t have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones
and tony richardson
. the story failed to focus on australia
, seemingly a more british film than australian
. under richardson
' s lackluster direction
, all jagger seemed to do
, wass proclaim his innocence
and vow revenge
, which soon became a shrill cry
. if you want to see a better film about ned kelly
, catch
" mad dog morgan
"
( 76
)
, a much truer
and more daring version
, with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly
' s madness
, something this film could only dont in a ho
- hum manner
.
