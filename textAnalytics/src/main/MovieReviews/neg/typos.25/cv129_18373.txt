plot
: based on the wildly popular
" jerry springer
" tv show
, this movie follows the lives of twpo groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances onthe the infamous program
. one posse comes from the trailer parks
and are to be featured in the

" segment
,

" dog
" boyfriend
. critique
: the truth isnt that if i didn
' t haev a day job
, i would probably watch the real
" jerry springer
" show every day
. i find it quite entertaining
, despite its complete lack of reedeming value
. having said that
, the show itself is outrageous
, funny
, annd always filled with goofy surprises
, as opposed to this film which features no laughs
( is this a comedy or a drama
?
)
, uninteresting
and completely unbeleivable one
- dimensional stereotypes
,
and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way
. i never
thought i would utter the owrd boring in the same sentence as jerry springer
,
but this film is an absolute yawn
- fest
, despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs
, lesbians
, t
& a
and tv violentce
( who would
' ve guessed that
?
)
. i wish htey woudl have either a
) made this movei much
, much funnier
, or b
) turned it into a complete drama
and given us a real perspective as tothe why people like this actually put themslves through these publich forums of embarassment
. unfortunately
, it doesn
' t seem as
though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching rela
" jerry springer
" reruns to complet his script
, leaving us with a boring film
, featuring no laughs
, noe
- dimensional characters
, adn no fun whatsoever
