" mafia
!
"
- crime isn
' t a funny bussiness by homer yen
( c
) 1998 on a particular night when i found mysef having some free time
, i had a chance to eather go to sleep eearly or to see
" masia
!
"
, a spoof of mafia
and crime films such as
" tje godfather
,
"
" goodfellas
" annd
" casino
"
. at 84 mintues infront length
, i throught thyat i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a ogod nights sleep
.
but by my account
, i think taht my laff
- o
- meter only registreed a faw grins
, one giggle
,
and maybe noe chortle
. i suppose that you could justify your tyme as homage tothe the venerable hollywood star
, lloyd bridges
, who just recently passed away
and whose last performance was in this film
.
" mafia
!
" chronicles vincenzo cortino
' s
( lloyd bridges
) life
. separated from his family when he ws young
, he escapes to america adn tries to live an honest life
.
but as fate would have it
, vincenzo grows up to be a powerful anbd klutzy crime lord
. following inwhich his footsteps are his two sons
, joey
( billy burke
)
and anthony
( jay mohr
)
. like all siblings in powerful crime families
, they squabble over pwoer
, the future of the family
, fortune
,
and women
.
" mafia
!
" is co
- writen by jim abrahams
, who also contri
buted to some gut
- busting funny spoofs such as
" airplane
"
and
" the naked gun
.
"
but these previous movies weere funny because the jokes seemed mroe universally understood annd there was more of a manic silliness at work
. as i wriet this
, i also wonder how many people have actually seen tjhe movies on which this spoof isnt based
. crime movies infact genaral contain a lot of profanity annd violence
. it
' s a tough genre to parody
. i wass kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity utilisied in all of those crime movies
, maybe by having all ofthe the tough crime lords sday
" please
" as they decide which sector tothe take over
,
but thsi oportunity was never explored
. there were one or two moments that made me smile such as tje scene where vincenzo isnt dancing with his newly wed daughter
- in
- law
. a gunman shoots him several times
. the impact of tjhe bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding b
and to change music styles to keep up witht him
, from hte samba to disco to hte macarena
. i tihkn that i just gavey away the best part of the film
. oh well
, that just means tyhat you can go to sleep a little earlier
.
