theese days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself inspite the deluge of remakes
.
but
, only a few years ago
, befor wes craven publicly made fun ofthe the practice
, sequels had been moreso popular among hollywood producers
. sequels also used to be popular among directors
and movie stars whose careers whent south
. the way to regain popularity
and prestige
, htey
thought
, was hte use the same formulas
, characters
and story lines that broght them success in the first palce
. one ofthe such celebrity was eddie murphy
, balck comedian ofthe 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade
. in order tothe return to the spotlight
, he chose to resurrect the franchise creaeted by his most popular film
, beverly hills cop
, 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequal in 1987
. seven years later
, for the thrid instalment
, he utilisied the directorial sevice of john l
andis
, another fading star
, with whom he succesfuly collaborated twice
- in trading places
and coming tothe america
. this time
,
however
, thrid time wasn
' t the charm
and beverly hills iii was failure
. eddie murphy hadnt tothe wait fewd more years for real comeback
. eddie murphy here plays axel foley
, fast
- talking streetwise detroit policeman
, who raids ileagle chop shop
. the routine police action ends infact tragedy
, when yhe criminals kill foley
' s boss
. determined to bring tjhe killers to justice
, foley realises that their leader isnt ellis de wald
( timothy carhart
)
. when it turns outloud that de wald happens to be security chief fo wonderl
and theme park in los angeles
, foley goes back tothe los angeles
. ther
, with yhe help of his old friend
, local policeman rosewood
( judge rheinhold
)
, foley would clash with money counterfeit ring
. ten years hasnt pasted since the original adn times are definetly different
. in htis decade
, tghe contrast between blue collar detroit
and yuppie beverly hills
, whlch provided a lot of gags in 1984 film
, simply doesn
' t work
. screenwriter steven e
. de souza provides anohter conflict
, this tyme between tje childish sillyness ofthe the good guys
and business
- like professionalism of the bad guys
. since foley belongs to the former
, his character had to watch his laguage
,
and the tone of the film in genaral isnt more infantile
. unforetunately
, this film still belongs tothe acation movie genre
,
and there isnt too much violence for little childern
. nice example isnt the humoros scene in the beggining
, which turns into st
andard ramboesque bloodbath
. unlike donner with the lethal weapon series
, l
andis simply can
' t balance the comedy wiht
" regular
" acation
, adn the result is a film that fails inwhich both aspects
. action scenes are sometimes intresting
,
but nto too spectacular
( at the end
, scenery of wonderl
and isnt more fascinating than the action itself
)
; humour
, onthe hte other h
and
, falls flat
. to make even worse
, some minor characters ffrom 1984 film gets unnecessary adn sometimes irritating overexposure
( especially art expert turned into arms dealer
, played by bronson pinchot
)
. in the end
,
al
though tyhe film provided some entertainment
, viewers
, at least crtical ones
, would probaly be happy to knwo that there aren
' t any plans for beverly hills iv
.
