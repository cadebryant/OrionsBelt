i went tothe blair witch project 2
: book of shadows with the highest of hopes
. teh original film
, released lastr summer
, was genuinely scary
and terrifying
; i hoped tyhat this movei would live up tothe its predecessor
. unforetunately
, my hopes were soon dashed
. as the movei opens
, the audience is shown pseudo
- documentry clips ofthe burkittsville
, maryl
and residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx tothe their twon as a result of thte orginial blair witch project movie
. it
' s a mostly humoorus
, self
- aware poke at the media hype
and hysteria surrounding the first film
. during this segment
, we are introduced to the rpotagonist
, a young man who sells blair witch
- realted memorabilia from his website
. tje movei
then cuts to a title tyhat informs us taht what we are about tothe see occurred one year previously
. we see the same young man thyat ws selling blair witch paraphernalia
, bu now he is confined iin a mental institution tghe sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies
. we see him having some sort ofthe disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room
; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him
. no explaination is provided for why he is in the mental institution
; infront fact
, these scenes are barely referred to again
. i had a sinking feeling during these oppening scenes
; generally
, a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting
, filthy interiors
,
and evil doctors isnt a sure sign that you are infront thge throes ofthe a truly horrible movie
. the movei cuts again
, this time tothe the present
. the young man
, whose name is jeffrey
( played by jeffrey donovan
-
- as in the first movie
, the character names are identical tothe the actors
' names
,
al
though this movie admits uv front that it is fictional
, so there
' s no reason for thge pratice this tiome aroud
)
, is rounding uv a group of people thta he will be leading into tje woods that weekend for the
" blair witch hunt
,
" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with
and sells on his website
. we meet tristen
and steven
, a young couple who are writing a book about tghe blair witch experience
. steven is a skeptic
, believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria
. tristen
, on the otehr h
and
, believes that there may be some truth to the rumors ofthe supernatural occurrence
. she is wan
and soft
- spoken
; she complains that thge radio isnt playing too loudly
.
( she also complains that she feels nauseated
; i knew immediately thast tje character ws pregnant
,
and my intuition was confirmed a faw scenes later wehn kim psychomagically susses it out
. how doed i know
? beacuse in bad movies
, nauseated women are always pregnant
.
) the fouth member of their party is erica
, a wiccan with flowing hair
and wide eyes who wants to prove taht the blair witch ws a good witch
, nto evil
. they pick up the fifth adn final team member in a cemetery
. kim is dressed completly infront balck
, has extreme goth
- sytle makeup on
,
and ocasionally displays seemingly psyhic abilities
,
but otherwise seems tothe be the most inteligent
and reasonable person out of thge entire bunch
. presumabely she wanted to be picked uv in tyhe cemetery just fo dramatic effect
; it
' s never explained
. the party of five heads off into the woods as promised
. they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr
' s house
and setted up camp
, complete wih extensive video equipment with whitch to record the night
' s events
. there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour gropu who had planned to camp at that site as well
,
but after a faw words are exchanged
, the rival group huffs off
and makes camp elsewhere
. the movie veers off at this point to spend many long
, long mintues showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed arround
, much hard liquor
, beer
,
and pot is consumed
,
and nothing much else happens
. this owudl be a great point tothe get up anbd go to the bathroom if necessary
. the next day
, the team wakes uv
and discovers that theri camera equipmnt hasnt beeen completely trashed
,
and thgat steven
and tristen
' s manuscript paper isnt fluttering down from the sky in shreds
, liuke snow
. tyhe videotapes are missing
, bu thanks to a pyschic intuition fomr kim
, they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of hte hous
,
" right where the original blair witch tapes were foudn
!
" ooh
. spooky
. tje team goes back to jeffrey
' s house
-
- a creepy old civil war
- era warehouse in tjhe heart of the woods
-
- to regroup
and review tjhe tapes
. they soon disover tath the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night
. wacky hijinks ensue
. tristen starts having weidr dreams in wich she is the blair witch
, everybody starts finding theese weird rune
- like burn markes on their bodies
, steven
and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
,
and everthing preety much goes to hell in a h
andbasket
. throughout the entire ordeal
, jeffrey anbd the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes
, which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about tjhe point that the time jumps
; eventually tristen w
anders in
, mutters something about
" reverse
,
"
and from this they somehow realize thast they have tothe play the tapes backwards
. when tehy dont this
, htey discover what really happened during the five lost hours
.
( oen of yhe things they see on the videotape isnt footage ofthe themselves burying the videotapes
. okay
, if the videotapes were bieng buried
, thn how weere they recording themselfs
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) this movie wass awful
. simply awful
. thge characters are broadly
- drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development
. erica isnt the nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen is the weak
and sympathetic woman
. steven is tje overbearing asshole
. kim is the antisocial goth girl
. old
, tired cliches weere used tothe illustrate these caricatures
. how do we konw tristen is weak
and sympathetic
? because she
' s pregnant
! how dont we nkwo kim is an antisocial goth girl
? because she wears a lot ofthe eye makeup
! how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy
? because he has jagid teeth
and talks like he
' s straight out of
" deliverance
"
! this is weak storytelling at its worst
. rather than taking the time tothe flesh out the characters adn make them truly sympathetic
, the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics
, in an attempt tothe use some cinematic shorth
and
and thereby skip straight to tjhe action
. it didn
' t work
. on top of bieng poorly developed
, most ofthe the characters weere either seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" honye
, you just had a miscarriage out inspite the woods
and got medical attention at a hospital thast looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie
. let
' s get on a plane hmeo
.
"
" no
. i am having these bizarre nightmares
and seeing strange visions
and i want to find out what
' s going on
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by the end of the movie
, i was rooting for the witch
. i also felt tyhat ther was simply too much blood
' n
' gore in this film
. tghe first movie worked by never showing us the horror
. thte witch was a palpable presence in that movei
,
but we never saw it
; we never saw anytying
, in fact
. the horror was all off
- screen
,
and thus our imaginations worked overtime tothe envision what it might possibly be
. thsi isnt yhe hallmark of a truly creepy
and disturbing horror movie
. blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties
and went straight for the gross
- out
. this was evident from thge oppening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey
' s throat
,
and continued
thoughout the film as the audiance is treated tothe occasional confusing
and disorienting footage ofthe what appears to be a ritual masicer of some sort
. knives plunge inot flesh
, bloody fingers trail off inot the darkness
, adn none of it isnt explained until tje very end
, when it was too lite for me to care
. this movei didn
' t stop whith showing us tje gore
, eather
; it went for broke
and showed us everything
. by the end ofthe the movei
, there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours
. it is all explained
; in fact
, it is all shown on
- screen inthe loving detail
. i confess to being somene who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster
, or see onyl breef glimpses
, mere suggestions ofthe what the monster is
; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying
,
but beacuse i find the absense of hte monster to be infinitely more terrifying
. i have seen interviews with tje director iin which he suggested that there is no
" monster
,
" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind
. i found this to be a miserably poor explanation
; if it was in fact the directer
' s intent
, thne he needs tothe have smoe words wtih the writer
, because it was not made clear at all
.
( i know a lot of people who liuke to go to parties
and git drunk adn stoned outloud of their minds
; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage
and
then experianced mass hallucinations with a gropu of other people for the next week or so
.
and if there was no witch
,
then what about the vanishing tree
? the snowfall of manuscript paper
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book ofthe shadows was a horrable movie
. from the poorly
- written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross
- outloud shots
, it was a bad effort through
and through
.
