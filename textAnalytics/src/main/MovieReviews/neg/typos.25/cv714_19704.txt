do the folks at disney have no common decency
? they have ressurected
yet anyother cartoon
and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects
, embarrassing writing
and kid
- freindly slapstick
. wasn
' t mr
. magoo enough
, peple
? obviously not
. inspector gadget is not what i woudl call ideal family enteratinment
. younger viewers wiull likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness
,
but their adult companions may fiel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80
- minute exercise in glaring stupidity
. thge movie is poorly edited
, grossly manipulative
,
and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle
. all the elements are there
, bu tjhe manner in which directer david kellogg pieces them together is laughable annd trite
. as a huge fan of the 80
' s animated tv show
, tjhe firt thing i must express is my anger toward thge treatment of hte main villain
. inthe hte cartoon
, dr
. claw was a frightening
, raspy
- voiced presence who remained a total mystery tothe the viewer
. we never saw his face
; he simply sat back iin his arm
- chair
, watching surveillance cameras
and gently stroking his loyal cat
. as a child
, i always imagined what dr
. claw would appear as
-
and this curiosity kept me watching for many years
. with the release ofthe the live
- action movie
, hte face of tihs once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed
- it
' s
.
.
. rupert everett
?
! only now
, dr
. claw is simply known as claw
(
` one word
,
' he explains
,
` like madonna
'
)
. he sports a shiny clamp instead of tje steel glove
,
and seems far less interesting than the animated version
. it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic
,
but he overplays tyhe role entirely too far
. whn all is said
and done
, htis wasn
' t a very wise move on the part ofthe the screenwriters
- tjhe infamous dr
. claw has been turned inot a wisecracking gmae sohw host who makes cheap attempts at being suave
and cool
. he does still have his cat
,
though
. in tghe title role
, matthew broderick looks lost
. the actor
, while ususally downright charming
, doesn
' t know exactlly where to take his character
- a fault tyhat agian cin be blamed onthe the hapless writers
. broderick first plays a friendly
, naive security guard named john brown
, who dreasm of becoming a cop
and upholding the law for the good ofthe the peopel
. he hasnt a mad crush onthe pretty scientist brenda
( joely fisher
)
, who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue anbd electronics
.
but one fateful night
, her lab is destroyed anbd her experiment isnt stolen by a fiendish millionaire
( everett
) who wants tothe take over the world
. john courageously pursues the lemosine from the scene of tje crime
,
but loses the chase when his vehicule bursts inot flames
. infront a full body cast
, he is chosen tothe be the firt human prototype for brenda
' s work
; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numberous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys
. anbd so is born inspector gadget
. as bad as this movie is
, it does have a certian charm in isolated scenes
. broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget
, an evil
and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city
. adn there are about twpo or three amusing punch lines
, the funniest bieng whn robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall
,
and a japanise man flees the scene while screaming
,
` this is why i left tokyo
!
' alas
, the hitted ratio of the ongoing gags is baout 20 tothe 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle
. there are so many tired plot additions
. gadget
' s tlaking car
( voiced by d
. l
. hughley
) is the smae tipe ofthe charcter as zoot the suit from my favorite martian
. both are wisecracking
, non
- human additions designed tothe coax laughter fomr smaller children
. well
, it jstu doesn
' t work
( in fact
, zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this
)
. anbd don
' t even git me started about the villains
. i didn
' t mind everett
' s performance
,
but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust
. tje characters fomr the ctaroon hvae been reduced to thankless supporting roles
. penny
( michelle trachtenberg
)
and brain the dog now ahve littel to do with the acation
,
and chief quimby
( dabney coleman
) has lost considerable appeal infact tjhe transistion of animation to live action
. tje special effects are everywhere
, bu not so annoying they iwll cause your eyes to peel over
. the problem here lies solely infront the script
. perhaps the next time disney attemts a remake liek this
, they will invest omre in the screenplay than the fancy
- schmancy visuals
. here is oen critic crossing his fingers
, anyway
.
