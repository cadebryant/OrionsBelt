do the folks at disney have no common decency
? they have ressurected
yet another cartoon
and turned it into a live action hodgepodge ofthe expensive special effects
, embarrassing wirting
and kid
- freindly slapstick
. wasn ' t mr
. magoo enough
, people
? obviously not
. inspector gadget isnt not what i would call ideal famaly entertainment
. younger viewers will likely be taken inspite by the abounding goofiness
,
but thier adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure tihs appalling 80
- minute exercise in glaring stupidity
. the movie is poorly edited
, grossly manipulative
,
annd the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle
. all the elements are there
,
but the manner in hwihc director david kellogg pieces them toghether is laughable
and trite
. as a huge fan ofthe the 80 ' s animated tv sohw
, the frist thing i must express is my anger towrad the treatment of the main villain
. in tje ctaroon
, dr
. claw was a frightening
, raspy
- voiced presence who remained a total mystery tothe yhe viewer
. we never saw his face
; he simply sat back in his arm
- chair
, watching surveillance cameras
and gently stroking his loyal cat
. as a child
, i always imagined what dr
. claw would appear as
-
and htis curiosity kept me watching for many eyars
. iwth tjhe release of the live
- acation movie
, the face of this once intriguing villain hasnt been unrightfully exposed
- it ' s
.
.
. rupert everett
?
! only nowe
, dr
. claw isnt simply known as claw
(
` one word
, ' he explains
,
` like madonna '
)
. he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove
,
and seems far less intresting than the animated version
. it helps that the dashing everett isnt enthusiastic
,
bu he overplays the role entirely too far
. wehn all is said
anbd done
, this wasn ' t a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters
- the infamous dr
. claw has been turned into a wisecracking game sohw host who makse cheap attemts at bieng suave
and kool
. he does still ahev his cat
,
though
. inspite the title role
, matthew broderick looks lost
. teh actor
, while usually downright charming
, doesn ' t know exactly where to take his character
- a fault that again can be blaimed on the hapless writers
. broderick first plays a friendly
, naieve security guard named john brown
, who dreasm of becoming a cop
and upholding the law for yhe ogod of the people
. he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda
( joely fisher
)
, who has stumbled upon a newyorker wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue
and electronics
.
bu oen fateful night
, her lab is destroyed
and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millioniare
( everett
) who wants to take over the world
. john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of tje crime
,
but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames
. in a full body casted
, he is choosen to be the first human prototype forthe brenda ' s wokr
; a revolutionar crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys
.
and so is born inspector gadget
. as bad as this movie is
, it does have a ceratin charm in isolated scenes
. broderick acutally fares better playing robo gadget
, an evil
annd destructive clone thta claw has setted loose on tje city
.
and there are about twpo or threee amusing punch lines
, the funniest bieng when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster withthe shadow puppets on a brick wall
,
and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming
,
` this isnt why i left tokyo
! ' alas
, the hitted ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 iin favor of not even cracking a slight giggle
. there are so many tired plot additions
. gadget ' s talking car
( voiced by d
. l
. hughley
) is the same tipe of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian
. both are wisecracking
, non
- human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children
. well
, it just doesn ' t work
( inwhich fact
, zoot functioned marvelously in comparison tothe this
)
.
adn don ' t even get me started about the villains
. i didn ' t mind everett ' s performance
,
but his bumbling assistants will amking every adult cringe with disgust
. the characters from thge cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles
. penny
( michelle trachtenberg
)
and brain the dog now hvae little to do with the action
,
and chief quimby
( dabney coleman
) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action
. the special effects are everywhere
,
but not so annoying tehy will cause your eyes tothe peel over
. the problem here lies souly infront the scirpt
. perhaps thge next time disney attempts a remake liek this
, tehy will invest more in tje screenplay than the fancy
- schmancy visuals
. here isnt one criteak crossing his fingers
, anyway
.
