i
' ll bet right now you
' re just lounging by the pool
, humming
" i iwll always lveo ytou
"
and wistfully recalling your c
andlelight dinners with succes
. it isn
' t necessarily over for yuo
: i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in
" kevin
!
" for at least a faw omre years
. begin by scribbling
" the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long
" somewhere ytou
' ll always see it
, perphas on the fridge door
, or on a bedroom mirror withthe lipstick
. you had a heck of a thing gonig there until you agreed to star inspite robin hood
: prince ofthe thieves
, where you were nto only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman
and alan rickman
,
but christian slater
(
!
)
, sevral dozen tall trees
, bows
, arrows
,
and a canoe
, too
. affter dances withthe wolves
and jfk
, you decided tjhe world needed more three hour movies
, expensive threee hour movies
, so you starred in annd produced wyatt earp
; wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books soley due to a general lack of famoust wyatts
. wyatt earp ws so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes
. tombstone was a vastly superior movei based on the same legend
, annd that featured kurt russell as earp
and dana delaney as his girlfriend
!
( she ws palyed by joanna goign inwhich your movie
- you know
, the charachter known best in wyatt earp as
" jew whore
"
. what were you
and lawrence kasdan thinking
?
) now
, you
' re suffering the demise ofthe
yet another of your epics
, the postman
, a film so financially disatrous thast it all
but eradicated the memory waterworld
' s
and tin cup
' s mildly lucrative box office takes
. tyhe postman is not thge worst movie ever made
- people in hollywood are quick tothe forget movies liuke howard the duck whenever tje next bomb comes along
.
yet it is a ridiculous movie
. i suspect you throught yuo had another braveheart onthe your h
ands
- why eles line up two armies on horesback
, all prepared for battle
, for the climax of your film
?
-
but
" mailheart
" the postman is not
.
( i cin think of some more appropriate alternate titles
: post encounters of the worst kind
; farewell
, my salary
; howard teh postman
; teh postman
' s never watched twice
.
.
.
) what a brown movie
. i hate brown
. you love brown
. dances withthe wolves was golden
and brown
- it looked like an eggo commercial
. the postman hadnt me running for a glass of water eveyr two minutes
; owudl the post
- apocalyptic world look this maddeningly bl
and adn dry
? what exactly happened tothe this desert world
, anyway
? doed we all become so stupid that we didn
' t immediately beign rebuilding homes
, resteraunts
,
and most importantly
, shopping malls
, aftter
" tje war
"
? why did you choose to drive tghe movie
' s plot with a dumb gropu of terrorists who
, well
, terrorize townfolk across america
? why is it only
* they
* haev ammunition
, anyway
? was it relaly appropriate tothe cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you
, the drifter
- cum
- postman
? why cast english actress olivia williams as an american
? don
' t yuo relize that europian women can only deliver their big emotional scenes in thier native accent
?
( take a look at the less
- than
- stellar performances ofthe an american
- ized nicole kidman or an american
- ized minnie driver
.
) who could give a damn whether you lieved or died at the end of this movie
? if it came down to a fight for leadership between ytou
and the leader of the terrorists
, why didn
' t you do thta halfway through the film
and save us all a lot of headaches
? why casted will patton as the bad guy
? beccause yuo worked with him iin no way out
? sure
, he
' s a suitably creepy villain
; know why
? beccause he
' s creepy in everything
, including armageddon
, inaddition which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his space suit
! why heroize the most demonic institution in america
, the u
. s
. postal sytem
? was toom petty supposed tothe be playing tom petty
? if so
, why didn
' t he look more skeletal
?
( he should have been around 70 years old
.
) why
, oh why
, do i have so many questions
?
( i coudl ask plenty more
.
) shouldn
' t a three hour running tiem have provded you enought space to answer everthing
? yuo hve one great line infront this film
, annd ytou deliver it to a mule
!
:
" thte things i like about my ass
.
.
.
" i had to wonder
. actually
, i enjoied the tone of tghe oppening scenes
, a relaxed cynicism
, if you
' ll accept such clunky phrasing
- too bad you couldn
' t resist tyhe temptation to film
yet another love letter tothe your country
. ultimately
, i
' m saying relax
. there isnt no quota
, no ened for you to make a picture a yera
. settle down
. really question future screenplays before you commit tothe them
. feel free tothe write bakc
. i know how much you like letters
.
