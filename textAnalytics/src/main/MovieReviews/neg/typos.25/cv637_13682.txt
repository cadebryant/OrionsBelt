i ' ll bet right nowe you ' re just lounging by the pool
, humming
" i will always love you
"
and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success
. it isn ' t necessarily over for you
: i say you still hve anough charm that ytou coudl avoid starring in
" kevin
!
" fo at least a few more years
. begin by scribbling
" the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long
" somewhere you ' ll always see it
, perhaps onthe the fridge door
, or on a bedroom mirror wiht lipstick
. you had a heck of a thing going ther until ytou agreed to star infront robin hood
: prince of thieves
, where you weere not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman
adn alan rickman
,
bu christian slater
(
!
)
, several dozen tall trees
, bows
, arrows
,
and a canoe
, too
. after dances whith wolves
and jfk
, yuo decided the world needed more three hour movies
, expensive three hour movies
, so you starred in
anbd produced wyatt earp
; wyatt earp the man was a boring idiat who made the history books solely due tothe a general lack of famous wyatts
. wyatt earp wass so dull a cowboy tyhat he died of natural causes
. tombstone was a vastly superior movei based on the same legend
,
adn that featured kurt russell as earp
and dana delaney as his girlfriend
!
( she was plyed by joanna going in your movei
- you nkow
, the character known best in wyatt earp as
" jew whore
"
. what were yuo
and lawrence kasdan thinking
?
) now
, you ' re sufferring the demise of
yot another of your epics
, the postman
, a film so financially disastrous that it all
but eradicated the memory waterworld ' s
adn tin cup ' s mildly lucrative box office takes
. the postman is not thge worst movie ever made
- peple in hollywood are quick tothe forget movies like howard the duck whenever the next bomb comes along
.
yet it is a rediculous movie
. i suspect ytou thought yuo hadnt another braveheart on your hands
- why else line uv two armies on horesback
, all prepared forthe battle
, forthe the climax of your film
?
-
but
" mailheart
" the postman is not
.
( i cin htikn of some more appropraite alternate titles
: post encounters of the worst kind
; farewell
, my salary
; howard the postman
; the postman ' s never watched twice
.
.
.
) what a brown movie
. i hate brown
. you love brown
. dances wiht wolves was golden
and brown
- it looked like an eggo commericial
. the postman had me runnung for a glass of water eveyr two minutes
; would tyhe post
- apocalyptic world look tihs maddeningly bland
and dry
? what exactly happened to this desert world
, anyway
? doed we all become so stupid that we didn ' t immediately beign rebiulding homes
, restaurants
,
and most importantly
, shopping malls
, after
" thge war
"
? why did you choose tothe drive tje movie ' s plot wiht a dumb group of terrorists who
, well
, terrorize townfolk accros amercia
? why is it only
* they
* hvae ammunition
, anyway
? wass it realy appropriate to cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you
, the drifter
- cum
- postman
? why casted english actress olivia williams as an american
? don ' t you realize that european women cin onyl deliver thier big emotional scenes in their native accent
?
( take a look at the less
- than
- stellar performances of an american
- ized nicole kidman or an american
- ized minnie driver
.
) who sould give a damn whether you lived or died at tyhe end of this movie
? if it came down to a fight fo leadership between you
and tghe leader ofthe the terrorists
, why didn ' t you do thgat halfway through the film
and savve us all a lot of headaches
? why cast will patton as the bad guy
? because you worked with him in no way outloud
? sure
, he ' s a suitably creepy villain
; nkwo why
? because he ' s creepy in everything
, including armageddon
, in which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his spoace suit
! why heroize hte most demonic institution in amercia
, the u
. s
. postal sytem
? was toom petty suposed to be playing tom petty
? if so
, why didn ' t he look omre skeletal
?
( he should have been around 70 years old
.
) why
, oh why
, dont i have so many questions
?
( i coudl ask plenty omre
.
) shouldn ' t a three hour running time have provided ytou enough space to answer everything
? you have one graet line in this film
,
and you deliver it to a mule
!
:
" the things i like about my ass
.
.
.
" i had to wonder
. actually
, i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes
, a relaxed cynicism
, if you ' ll accept such clunky phrasing
- too bad you couldn ' t resist thge temtation tothe film
yet another loev letter to your country
. ultimately
, i ' m saying relax
. there is no quota
, no need for you to make a picture a year
. settle down
. really question future screenplays befor you commit to them
. feel free to rwite back
. i know how much ytou like letters
.
