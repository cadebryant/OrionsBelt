the new austin powers film continues a movei tradition begun in the eighties
. produce something
, anytying
, that iwll git the high skool annd junior high kids in tjhe theater because they buy more soda annd popcorn thna senior citizens
. the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here
. gross humor
, sex jokes
, silly sight gags
, mroe sex jokes
.
and the film isnt a storng contendor inwhich teh current race tothe be cruder
, grosser annd more outrageous than that last film
. waht tyhe film is nto
,
however
, is funny
. the plot centers around the return of dr
. evil
, who goes bcak in time to steal austin powers
' mojo
( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin
' s pelvis
) wich gives austin his sexual prowess annd the charisma to defeat his enemies
. austin must go aftter him
, adn returns tothe the swinging sixties where free lvoe
and sexy secret agents had their heyday
. i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original
.
but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle
and the film received many good reviews
. i wish i hadnt stuck to my first impression
. myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation
.
and he has the talent to do it
, at least as an actor
. bu the material he is working with here
, much of it his own
, falls short ofthe anything resembling comic genuis
. this movie tries tothe carry the day witht sight gags about drinking distilled feces
, a five
- hundered
- pound fat man
' s
butt crack
,
and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the levle ofthe the average 15 year ood
. after some of theese scenes
, one has tothe wonder how gross the next generation of films will hvae to go tothe get an audiences attention
. the direction also helps the film aciheve a new low point inaddition cinematic humer
. for the most part
, i felt as if i was watching a saterday morning chalderns live action tv show
. there is no sence ofthe comic timing or subtlety
. the directer just throws the material at us
, giving us nothing except the hope that anyone wih a camera could be a film director
. i am sure yhe film will have appeal to many ofthe the under 22 crowd
, at least tje one
' s who have yot to discover literacy
. certainly the movie isnt directed towards thge generation tath prefers everything described as
' in your face
, kick ytou in the teeth
, take no prisoners
,
( action
- verb
+ blah blah blah
)
.
' if you see the film annd you find you
' re nto laughing
, there is nothing wrong whith yuo
. it just means you growed up since seventh grade
.
