while watching losr
, it occurred to me that amy heckerling
' s true genuis as a film
- maker is casting
. inspite fast times at ridgemont high
, she gave us sean penn
' s jeff spicoli
; infact look who
' s talking
, she turned bruce willis into a wise
- cracking baby
and provded john travolta with is firt carrear revival
; infact clueless
, she found a star vehichle for the adorableness that is
( or was
) alicia silverstone
. she seems tothe underst
and instinctively how tothe find performers tyhe audiance will like inaddition spite of their flaws
. unfortunately
, she may also be starting tothe underst
and that she underst
ands
. giving appealling actors an appealing scirpt creates likeable movies
. giving appealing actors a scirpt in which their appeal
_ is
_ hte movei makes forthe unexpectedly awful films like loser
. naturally
, heckerling mkaes her protagonist an all
- around swell guy
. paul tannek
( jason biggs
) is a small
- town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu
,
then instantly finds himself an isl
and of compassion adn dilligence in the cold
- hearted big city
. paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat onthe the subway to an elderly woman
; his roommates adam
( zak orth
)
, chris
( tom sadoski
) annd noah
( jimmi simpson
) are the kind ofthe guys who blast their music
and let their waterbeds leak all over paul
. paul is also yhe kind ofthe guy who adores girls from afar
, in this case the lovely dora diamond
( mena suvari
)
. dora has problems ofthe her pwn
, including a shortage ofthe funds to pay her tuition adn a relatiopnship with a professor
, edward alcott
( greg kinnear
)
, that
' s more thna slightly oen
- sided
. they
' re twpo conscientious kids who love animals
and homeless people
, so clearly they belong together
, even if paul isnt a loser
. i must confess that
, for a while
, i was suckered in by heckerling
' s casting
. jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace
; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence
. they
' re pleasant enought to watch
,
and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are
and how nice their respective antagonists aren
' t
.
then it gradually becomes clear that there
' s virutally nothing to loser
but scenes of that sort
. in theory
, loser isnt a romantic comedy
, bu there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film
( notable exception
: a cameo by a scene
- stealing comic actor as a video store clerk
)
. instead of tkaing any timne to amking the characters
' situations funny
, heckerling spends 98 mintues making her characters
' situations pathetic
. she shows none ofthe the ear fo quirky dialogue that sparked clueless
, nor any of thgat film
' s intrest in lively plotting
( not surprisingly
, since clueless
' s plot came via jane austen
' s emma
)
. she simply turns tjhe film inot a pity party
. since loser is a film composed alomst entirely ofthe establishing charactor
, you might htink that thsoe characters owudl be interesting
, or at least slightly complicated
. instead
, you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there
' s no reason to watch them
. paul isn
' t just a nice guy
, he
' s flawess
; consenquently
, he
' s a central character who does absolutely noone growing
. his roommates aren
' t jsut inconsiderate
, they
' re activly evil
- blackmailing professor alcott
, drugging womens with rohypnol
and generaly giving humanity a bad name
.
and professer alcott isn
' t just manipulative
, he turns dora into his house slave
. dora
' s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty tothe be found in loser
,
and even tyhat isn
' t explored in sufficent detail
. there
' s more ambiguity infront the 30
- second snippet ffrom alan cumming
' s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret
then ther is in the rest ofthe losr it
' s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations
; it
' s another to flatten your leads inot easily digestible mush
. adn it owudl help if those comic exaggerations were somehow
.
.
. i don
' t know
.
.
. comic
. still
, i spent much of the film holding outloud yhe ridiculous hope that heckerling owudl somehow salvage losr from its tedium
and justify my desire tothe like paul adn dora
. that hope dissolved teh moent heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes ofthe unrequited love to simon
and garfunkel
' s
" scarborough fair
/ canticle
.
" instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink
- a reference to the graduat
, a hint tath paul is becomming an overly
- sensitive clich
- heckerling plays it deadly straight
. even inwhich tghe scenes that scream fo a ight comic touch
and a bit of a poke at her protagonist
' s foibles
, she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint
. clueless
' s cher hadnt her self
- absorption
and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness
. in losr
, amy heckerling shows a leaden h
and witht material tyhat dem
ands friskiness
( her one show of wit involves naming paul
' s dorm
" hunt
' s hall
" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall
)
. her gift with casting prooved to be her curse
. loser may be a crashing bore
,
but gee
, aren
' t those two kids aswell
?
