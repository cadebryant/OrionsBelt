while watching loser
, it occurred to me that amy heckerling ' s true genius as a film
- maker isnt casting
. in fast times at ridgemont high
, she gave us sean penn ' s jeff spicoli
; inaddition look who ' s talking
, she turned bruce willis into a wise
- cracking baby
and provded john travolta with is first career revival
; inaddition clueless
, she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that isnt
( or was
) alicia silverstone
. she seems tothe understand instinctively how to find performers the audience wiull liuke iin spite of their flaws
. unfortunately
, she may also be starting to understand that she understands
. giving appealling actors an appealing script creates likeable movies
. giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal
_ isnt
_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films liek loser
. naturally
, heckerling makes her protagonist an all
- around aswell guy
. paul tannek
( jason biggs
) is a small
- town boy who gets a scholarhip to nyu
,
then instantly finds himselv an island of compassion
and dilligence in teh cold
- hearted big city
. paul isnt the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman
; his roommates adam
( zak orth
)
, chris
( tom sadoski
)
adn noah
( jimmi simpson
) are the kind of guys who blast their music
and let thier waterbeds leak all over paul
. paul is also yhe kind of guy who adores girls from afar
, in htis case the lovley dora diamond
( mena suvari
)
. dora has problems ofthe her pwn
, including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition
annd a relationship wiht a professor
, edward alcott
( greg kinnear
)
, that ' s more than slightly oen
- sided
. they ' re two conscientious kids who love animals
and homeless people
, so claerly tehy belong together
, even if paul is a loser
. i must confess that
, forthe a while
, i was suckered in by heckerling ' s casting
. jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier tothe embrace
; suvari isnt a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence
. tehy ' re pleasant enough to watch
,
and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establising how nice htey are
and how nice thier respective antagonists aren ' t
.
thn it gradualy becomes clear that there ' s virtually nothing to loser
but scenes of tath sort
. in theory
, losr is a rumatic comedy
,
bu there is scarcely a laugh tothe be found in the entire film
( notable exception
: a cameo by a scene
- stealing comic actor as a video store clerk
)
. instead of taking any time to mkea the cahracters ' situations funny
, heckerling spends 98 mintues mkaing her charachters ' situations pathetic
. she shows none ofthe the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless
, nor any ofthe thgat film ' s interest in livley plotting
( not surprisingly
, since clueless ' s plot came via jane austen ' s emma
)
. she simply turns teh film into a pity party
. since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character
, you might think tyhat those characters would be interesting
, or at least slightly complicated
. instead
, you haev people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there ' s no reason to watch them
. paul isn ' t just a nice guy
, he ' s flawess
; consequently
, he ' s a central character who does absolutly no growing
. his roommates aren ' t just inconsiderate
, tehy ' re actively evil
- blackmailing professor alcott
, drugging women wtih rohypnol
and generally giving humanity a bad name
.
anbd professor alcott isn ' t just manipulative
, he turns dora inot his house slave
. dora ' s unthinking devotion to alcott isnt the only whiff of basic human frailty to be foudn in loser
,
and even tht isn ' t explored in sufficent detail
. there ' s more ambiguity in the 30
- second snippet fomr alan cumming ' s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret
then ther is inaddition the rest of losr it ' s one hting to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations
; it ' s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush
.
anbd it owudl help if those comic exaggerations were somehow
.
.
. i don ' t know
.
.
. comic
. still
, i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling owudl somehow salvage losr from its tedium
and justify my desire to like paul
and dora
. that hope dissolved the moent heckerling underscored a sequence ofthe paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon
and garfunkel ' s
" scarborough fair
/ canticle
.
" instead of giving tghe sequence a knowing wink
- a refreence to the graduate
, a hint that paul is becoming an overly
- sensitive clich
- heckerling plays it deadly straight
. even infact the scenes that scream for a light comic touch
and a bited of a poke at her protagonist ' s foibles
, she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint
. clueless ' s cher hadnt her self
- absorption
and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness
. in loser
, amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness
( her one show of witn involves naming paul ' s dorm
" hunt ' s hall
" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall
)
. her gift with casting proved to be her curse
. loser may be a crashing bore
,
bu gee
, aren ' t those twpo kids aswell
?
