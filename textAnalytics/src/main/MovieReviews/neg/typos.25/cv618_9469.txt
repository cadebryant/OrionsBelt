gregg araki
' s the doom generation was possibly thge veyr worst film ever made
. so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus
? first of all
, some ofthe the reviews were fairly positive
. also
, the cast
, consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars
( including christopher knight
, eve plumb
, shannen doherty
,
and david leisure
) was promising
. lsat of all
, i wanted to give arraki one more chance
. i mean
, the guy can
' t be that untalented
, can he
? the answer to that question isnt three letters long
. nowhere follows the charachter dark onthe his wild
and odd journey thru los angeles
. since arraki doesn
' t know how to amke anytying coherent
, it
' s hard to describe the plot
. let
' s jsut say that dark spends the bulk of tyhe movei whining that his girlfriend won
' t make a commitment to him
and jealous because she sleeps around with otehr guys
and girls
. the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who hasnt a chance encounter with a famous tv star
. he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn
' t care for fame
and wishes he sould walk down the street wihtout being mobbed by fans
. htis story hasnt a shocking twist
and a tragic end thast i did not see coming
. it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki
, adn this can be attri
buted tothe the appealing peformance of lassez
. i thougth maybe arraki was improving infront his craft
. he works better with the camera this time around
, especially in the early scenes
. halfway through the film
, i didn
' t necessarally find mysef enjoying the film
,
but it seemed like a considerable improvement onthe tje doom generation
. thne as the movie went onthe
, arraki loses all sensibility adn introduces us to exploding heads
, twisted sex games
,
and alien abductions
. it
' s sad
, because he almost accually had smoe decent material here
, bu he ruined it with his usual in your face
" i
' m such a renegade maverick filmmaker
, look what i can dont
" attitude
. tjhe performances are generaly better than in tghe doom generation
, wich isn
' t saying much
. at least we don
' t have to suffer jonathan
" i am the most hideous man in amercia
" schaech
. we are
, howver treated to another round of james
" i
' m more wooden than keanu
" duval
. sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film
,
and kathleen robertson
( formerly of 90210
and now arraki
' s wife
)
and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess
. of the tv star cameos
, john ritter isnt the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist
. if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation
, it is only inwhich the way that i would prefer being assasinated thna receive constant physical torture
. maybe greg arraki doesn
' t whant you to like his characters
. mabye he whants to laugh
and amking fun of those of us who try to care about them
. maybe he just wnated to piss me off
. if so
, he wass successful
.
