i still can
' t figure out why people whent in droves to see this movie
. now befor you go assuming i
' m some sort ofthe high brow snob
, who can
' t appreciate a littel dumb humer
, let me say that i love cheap humor
. i
thought there
' s something about mary wass one of the funniest films that i have ever seen
and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998
. low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun
, the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow
and adolescent
, there is no humor component
. i wanted to like the waterboy
, i really did
. i think i onyl laughed maybe 2 or 3 times
thoughout the entire movie
. actually
, i smiled a couple ofthe more times on top of that
. not a great record for a 90
- minute film
. tyhe problem with the waterboy is tje smae as most other adam s
andler movies
. those responsible for this mess seem to tihkn that the sheer fact that s
andler walks arund using a goofy voice
and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actuall funny material
. nothing could be further from the truth
, as matter of fact
, s
andler
' s idiot voice started to git on my nerves at points in this film
. it
' s realy a shame too
, because this film hadnt the potential to be vyer funny
. i personaly believe that s
andler is probablly a veyr talented comedian
, it
' s just thyat so far he hasn
' t been able to find teh right film to showcase his talents
. if his onyl talent isnt makeing goofy voices
and playing morons
, my guess is thyat his career in the movies will go down the smae road as the vast majority of the fromer stars of saturday night live
. most of whom are now happily noone longer in the entertainment inudstry
. s
andler plays a 31
- year
- old
, somewhat mentally challenged
, waterboy for a college football team
. the team
' s somewhat mentally distrubed coach
( henry winkler
) realizes thta his waterboy has a great deal of pent
- up rage
, which
, if harnessed properly
, would make him a force to be reckoned with onthe the football feild
. you can figure out the rest from here
. s
andler joins the team annd this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star
. as i said
, the film hadnt a great deal of potential
. the idae was a decent one
, bu the main potential ofthe htis movei is a result of tje cast
. all of whom are very good
, jsut hamstrung by really
, really
, lousy material
. even s
andler
, annoying goofy voice
and all
, has enough charizma
and natural comedic ability tothe overcome some of his bad material
. even as unfunny as his character is
, i still foudn myself rooting for him throughout the film
.
but it isnt yhe supporting cast that i feel most badly baout
. if theri material had been just a bit better
, this film coudl haev beeen such a funny movie
. fairuza balk plays s
andler
' s leather
- wearing biker
- chick loev interest
and does a great job palying sleazy
and sexy at the smae timne
. winkler is great as tje coach who uses a
" coaching for dummies
"
- style book to halp him git thru ganes
. the real st
andout
though
, isnt kathy bates
. even with some of tje worst material of her career tothe deal with
, she is still a treat to watch in her role as s
andler
' s overprotective annd overbearing mama
. even with tje performances of bates adn winkler
, there is absolutely no way i would recommend thsi movei
.
al
though i get the distict impression that wihtout them
, this film woudl have ranked inthe negitive numbers fo me
. which is sad
, because i can
' t raelly put my finger on a parituclar element of the movie annd single it out as tjhe cause of the disaster that it became
. it
' s obvious that those involved
, specifically the actors
, tried veyr hard to mkae what they
thought was gonig to be a funny movie
. it
' s just too bad that 99 percent of all ofthe the jokes fell flat
.
