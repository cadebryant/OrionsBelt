i cried during
_ babe
_
. i admit it
. teh special effects
, thge story
, the great dialogue were woven toghether so delicately
and succesfully that my mind lost trakc that this was a
" children
' s film
"
-
- so much so that
, yes
, i got a littel overly sentimental
. such
, my friend
, is the power ofthe cinema
. when word came out that they weere useing this newly developed f
/ x for a doctor dolittle update
, in which eddie murphy plays the title character
, adn many great comic actors suply the voices
, my anticipation rose to great expectations
. they cant
' t possibly drop the ball on tihs oney
. can
' t miss
. can
' t possably miss
. htey missed
. what whent wrong
? after much
thought
, i supply three general rules
.
( 1
) don
' t let a television actress
- turned
- comedy movie director near an urbanite script
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall
' s dreadful
" preacher
' s wife
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders with
" the brady bunch movie
"
,
but the smae sitcom
- airiness doesn
' t qtuie work here
. it
' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom
, annd iced it with glight doses of modern r
& b
. take away the black cast
, take away the atrocious sountrack
,
and you have the residue of some mid
- 80
' s kirk cameron sohw
.
( 2
) the greater the casted
, the less the individual cast
- member has to do
( i
. e
.
,
" con air
"
)
. it isnt grat tothe have hte comic voices ofthe jenna elfman
, garry sch
andling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
, annd gilbert godfried in your lineup
,
but they have nothing tothe dont
but improvise their underdeveloped
, stereotyped characters
, one
- line
- at
- a
- time
. it
' s even worse
, baceause sometimes theri voices are so unrecognizable that you don
' t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian untli the credits
. now there are three character actors who do get special treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity tothe nearly every project he
' s infact
, annd the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy
. norm mcdonald fares nearly as well
, as a stray dog who lerans to bond with dolittle
.
but there
' s little humer here
. that rests on the shoulders of chris rock
, sorely miscast
and unfunny as the voice of thier wise
- ass guinea pig
. even the mouth isnt ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don
' t let the special effects techicians walk awya with the script
. there
' s a certain timing taht
' s m
andatory in comedy
. tothe hvae this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson
' s creature shop
, is a travesty
. this is nto to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren
' t well
- timed laughfests
; with the right director
, tehy can be
and have
. here
, betty thomas is claerly over her head
. i wish i coudl commend yhe special effects
,
but they
' re merely average
. count the number ofthe times where the animal
' s mouth is turned away from the camera
, or too far to notice
, or ill
- synched
. this is less a
" babe
"
and more ofthe a
" look who
' s barking
" clone
. you may be wondering
,
' how does eddie murphy fare
?
' well
, he cameback bcak iwth tghe exceptional
" nutty proffesor
"
, anbd i don
' t doubt he cin come back again
. here
, he
' s tied into a straight man
and given little to do
. tyhe exceptions are when he fears he
' s going crazy
: a far cry from his smarter
- than
- you
' d expect routine that he
' s more adept at
. it
' s unfortunate thgat he is where richard pryor was ten years ago
, making lame comedies without the smae bite he had given in his early years
. after all this
, what
' s left
?
butt jokes
. a
_ lot
_ of
butt jokes
. i guess fo kids that may be funny
,
but i wass stone
- faced
. if there
' s a lesson the film may be telling us
, is that animals hvea feelings too
,
and they care way too much for your
butt
.
