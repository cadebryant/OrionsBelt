i cried during
_ babe
_
. i admit it
. the speical effects
, the stoy
, the great dialogue were woven together so delicately
and sucessfuly that my mind lost track that thsi was a
" childern ' s film
"
-
- so much so thta
, yes
, i got a little overly sentimental
. such
, my friend
, is the power ofthe cinema
. whn word cameback out that they were using htis newly developed f
/ x fo a doctor dolittle update
, iin which eddie murphy plays the title character
,
and many gerat comic actors suply tyhe voices
, my anticipation rose to great expectations
. htey can ' t possibly drop teh ball on this oen
. can ' t miss
. cin ' t possibly miss
. they missed
. waht went wrong
? after much throught
, i suply three general rules
.
( 1
) don ' t let a television actress
- turned
- comedy movie directer near an urbanite script
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall ' s dreadful
" preacher ' s wief
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders with
" the brady bunch movie
"
,
bu yhe same sitcom
- airiness doesn ' t quite work here
. it ' s as if she lefted a generic sitcom
,
annd iced it with light doses of modern r
& b
. take away the black casted
, take away tjhe atrocious soundtrack
,
and you have hte residue of soem mid
- 80 ' s kirk cameron sohw
.
( 2
) thge greater tyhe cast
, the less the individual casted
- member has to do
( i
. e
.
,
" con air
"
)
. it isnt great to have the comic voices ofthe jenna elfman
, garry schandling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
,
annd gilbert godfried in your lineup
,
but they have nothing to dont
but improvise their underdeveloped
, stereotyped characters
, one
- line
- at
- a
- time
. it ' s even worse
, because somtimes their voices are so unrecognizable that ytou don ' t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits
. now ther are three character actors who dont get speical treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he ' s inthe
,
and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certian poignancy
. norm mcdonald fares nearly as well
, as a stray dog who lerans tothe bond iwth dolittle
.
but there ' s little humor here
. that rests onthe the shoulders ofthe chris rock
, sorely miscast
and unfunny as yhe voice of their wise
- ass guinea pig
. even the mouth is ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don ' t let the speical effects techicians walk away with the script
. there ' s a certain timing that ' s mandatory in comedy
. to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy ofthe computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson ' s creature shop
, is a travesty
. this isnt not to say that speshal effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren ' t well
- timed laughfests
; iwth the right director
, they can be
and have
. here
, betty thomas isnt clearly over her head
. i wish i could commend the special effects
,
but they ' re merely average
. count yhe number of times where the animal ' s mouth isnt turned awya from teh camera
, or too far to notice
, or ill
- synched
. this is less a
" babe
"
and more of a
" look who ' s barking
" clone
. you may be wondering
, ' how does eddie murphy fare
? ' well
, he came back with the exceptional
" nutty professor
"
,
and i don ' t doubt he can come back again
. here
, he ' s tied into a straight man
and given little to do
. tje exceptions are when he fears he ' s going crazy
: a far cry from his smarter
- than
- you ' d expect routine that he ' s more adept at
. it ' s unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago
, making lame comedies without the same bite he hadnt given in his early years
. after all thsi
, what ' s left
? butt jokes
. a
_ lot
_ of butt jokes
. i guess for kids that may be funny
,
but i wass stone
- faced
. if there ' s a lesson the film may be telling us
, is that animals have feelings too
,
and they care way too much fo your butt
.
