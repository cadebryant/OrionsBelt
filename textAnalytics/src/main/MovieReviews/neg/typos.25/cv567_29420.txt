infact my opinyon
, a movei resivwar
' s most important task is tothe offer an explanation for his oppinion
. bu with soul survivors
, i
' m so full of critical rige that this review is liable to turn into a venomous
, uncontrollable rant
, obligations damned
.
however
, protocol forces me to do otherwise
. soul survivers tells the story of four college
- binded friends
: cass
andra
( melissa sagemiller
) is sweet annd innocent
. party girl annabel
( eliza dushku ofthe bring it on
) is dating world
- weary harvard student matt
( wes bentley
)
. matt still hasnt feelings fo cassie
, who is now dating sean
( casey affleck
)
. driving back ffrom a creepy
, gothic party
, tyhe quartet gets into a horrific car crash
. sean dies
, leaving cassie crestfallen
and guilty
, made worse becuase sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her
. as cassie mopes through her classes
, she sees the ghost of sean all over the palce
, urging her to folow him
. allong with being plagued by other gastly visions
, cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party
. annabel
and matt try calming her down
,
but no oen shares cass
' s visions
. she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself
. rarely ahev i seen a director so thouroughly mish
andle material
. in his directorial de
but
, steve carpenter does nothing tothe provoke the audience into feeling any emotion
. wehn the movie
' s camerawork isn
' t pedestrian
, it
' s clich
? d
. carpenter
' s need for close
- ups
, his camera following sagemiller from behind
, drain thte movei of any anticipation
. we already know wqat tothe look for
, so why shoudln we be surprised
?
and the sense of scary atmosphere
, which was recently done so well inwhich the others
, is nowhere tothe be found here
. carpentery
' s scirpt relies on r
andom twists annd turns with a minumum ofthe logic
and loads of laziness
. thsi is a movie where the endig features one character providing an explanation about teh plot tothe another character
, which isnt one of tghe lamest screenwriting devices around
. the second lamest device
, of course
, isnt the
,
" oh
, it was all a dream
" resolution
. annd guess wqat
? this movie has both
! not that the main body of hte film
, which has sagemiller constantly runing in fear or haveing a nervous breakdown
, is anything worthwhile
. sicne htere
' s no captivating dialogue
, no charachter chemestry exists anywhere
. that
' s a huge problem
, since the four main characters are supposed tothe be couples
. carpenter can
' t even get yhe smutty scenes right
, which are becomeing more prevalent in pg
- 13 movies like bring it onthe
and get over it
.
[ the film was recently re
- cutted from an r rating tothe get more kids inaddition tyhe seats
.
- ed
.
] wehn sagemiller adn dushku dance toghether at a club
, he rarely shows them in a full shot
and he never keeps the camera on them forthe longer than a second before relating to some michael bay
- style quick cuts
.
and when sagemiller
and dushku take a shower together affter getting covered in paint
, they
' re fully clothed
. regardless
, any sexiness in thast scene is undercut by its stupidity
. why wouldn
' t they wash the clothes in the sink or in tyhe washing machine
? why would they shower iin their clothes
? what if they weren
' t covered infront latex paint
? the cast
, which wiull see better material in the future
, owudl be wise to leave this one off their resumes
. i felt sory for affleck
, who i
' ve liekd infact other movies
,
and bentley
, who ws great infront american beauty
. dushku
, who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality
, has got to stop taking roles belonging tothe rose mcgowan
. as for sagemiller
( star of the aforementioned get over it
)
, i watn to see her in a movie where she plays a person
, anbd not an object for gawking
. anbd i
' m nto even getting into luke wilson
' s role as a priest
. at least he
' s friends iwth wes
anderson
. bottom line
: soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors
and warn people about it
.
