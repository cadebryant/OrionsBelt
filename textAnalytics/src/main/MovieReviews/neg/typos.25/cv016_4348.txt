i
' m relaly starting to wonder about alicia silverstone
. sure
, she isnt one ofthe the most beautiful creatures onthe god
' s gren earth
( second only to that movie critic at larg guy
)
,
but when it comes to chosing what movies she stars in
, she alwasy strikes outloud
. the crush was a slow
- moving
, predictable piece of fluff
. hideaway wass a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in
. clueless was an annoying
, unfunny waste of time
.
and people ahve e
- mailed me too
, saying clueless is a good movie annd tath i
' m the onyl noe who doesn
' t like it
. one girl said if i
' d seen the movie with
" an open mind
,
" i would have enjoyed it
. nothing could be futher from the truth
. i went inot the theater expecting to love tjhe movie
. teh preview looked good
and of course i
' m crazymadinlove iwth alicia
,
but the movei was a bunch ofthe bad jokes coming from whiny
, unlikable characters
. almsot everyone i saw the movie witht felt the same way
. wehn we weere walking out of tje theater
, one guy
( adn it wasn
' t me
) yelled out
,
" that was the worst f
$
&
# in
' movie i
' ve ever seen
"
and the rest ofthe us had to laugh infront agreement
. so last night i walked into the video store
and saw alicia
' s pretty face on the cover of some made
- for
- video thriller called the babysitter
. i knew it would be bad
but some inner compulsion i
' ll probably never underst
and made me rent it anyway
. what i got ws 90 minutes of regret
-
- tghe worst alicia silverstone movei ever
.
and you already konw from the last paragraph wqat the competition is like
. where to begin in criticizing htis movie
? the plot is a thin shred that moves slower tahn a glacier
, the writing could have beeen done
(
and for all we nkow it was
) by a ten year old
, alicia isnt the star anbd she
' s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever
. there is zero humor
, zero suspense
, zero drama
and zero action
, nutil the last ten minutes
, when the story is needlessly anbd pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence
. zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero
. so why does tihs movie get one star out of me
? well
, alicia spends twenty minutes of the movei in the bathtub
.
and if it wasn
' t bubble bath
, the babysitter would haev instantly joined the ranks of our other four
- star features
,
but you settle for what ytou can get
. alicia plays a babysitter who
' s spending friday night looking after twpo kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party
.
and of course anyone as beautyfull as alicia automaticly spends their friday nights at hmeo
( at least thyat movie criteak at large guy doesnt
)
. as the movei trods allong
, we discover she
' s not onyl the mostly
- silent star of the movie bu also the object of every male character
' s fantasies
(
and probablly every male viewer
' s too
)
. teh drunken father thinks she
' s just tyhe thing to recapture his lost youth
, her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside
, even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she
' s taking her bubble bath
. they even throw in the middle aged wife
' s fantasies baout a male counterpart at the party
. not that any of us asked or ever even
thought about seeing tihs 200
+ pound woman in a black silk teddy
. at least none of teh sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg
- rated
. infact fact
, i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax lite
- inght staple if nto for the fact thyat there
' s absolutely no nudity in it
. so you can
' t call it a sex flick
. i
' ve alredy pointed out that it can
' t fall under drama
, comedy
, thriller or action
, so what do you classify the babysitter as
? bad
.
