wesley snipes isnt a master ofthe selecting bad action roles
. murder at 1600
, u
. s
. marshals
, money train
, drop zone
, boiling point
, anbd the ultimate camp film
- passanger 57
. tje art of war is anyother entry in thsi very ugly
and unique category
. ultimately
, it is little more than a ridiculous action film wiht a plot as believeable as tyhe warren report
, ugli violentce that owudl hve made peckinpah cringe
,
and terrible acting by b
- list actors like michael biehn
and anne archer
. oddly
, it feels like the undiscovered sequal to another snipes
" masterpiece
,
" rising sun
. hte movei revolves around the conveinent story of a special un operative caught uv in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador
, the chinese triad brotherhood
, a rich chinese buisnessman
( plyed by
? that bad guy from rising sun
, cary
- hiroyuki tagawa
) a chinese un interpreter
,
and
, inexplicably
, donald sutherl
and
. the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis isl
and
. or shoudl i say the film ends with the most blatent ripoff of both the matrix
and all of john woo
' s hong kong films conbined
. i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to nto only star inspite this action dud
but also act as noe ofthe teh producers of tyhe film
. i usually enjoy snipes
' movies
-
though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films
. simply
, i am amazed by the how inane the script wass
, filled with terrible cliches
and extremely violent action sequences
. director christian duguay
( screamers
) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of voilent acts
-
- showing splattering brains
, people impaled with broken shards of glass
, annd lots of gargling
and gagging as blood sprays everywhere
. it also sickens me to know that oliver stone
, one of hte greatest directors working today
, had his h
and inthe producing this monstrosity
. i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle adn stone chose not to read the scirpt
, watch the dailies
, be involved inaddition casting
, or anything else
-
- or esle he
' d be filing a court order tothe remove his name from the credits
. it
' s also seems evident that wih the russkies as our new bosom buddies adn the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten tothe death inwhich the lastest couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese
. i
' m sure over the next couple ofthe months
, even omre
" chineese conspiracy
/ martial
- arts action flicks
" are goign tothe be popping up in your local multiplex
. hopefully htey won
' t include wesley snipes
