the ads fo
" batman
and robin
" scream
" the event ofthe the summer is here
" adn that
' s teh problem
. the producers were apparently so intent onthe creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it
.
" batman
and robin
" isnt 126 minutes of lavish sets
, flashy costumes annd big
, confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance
. it
' s like noe of those cheesy kings isl
and stage shows
; bright
, busy
and visually diverting
,
but not very much fun
. it wasn
' t always thsi way
. tim burton
' s
" batman
" was an epic story of obession
and duality
, of darkness
and revenge
. the film
, hwile far from perfect
, was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel
. batman was a creepy
, brooding creature of the night
. the joker
, brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson
, was at once charismatic
and repellent
. batman
and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin
, battling inner demons
and oney anohter over gotham city
' s breathtaking gothic skyline
. those days ofthe the dark knight are gone
, replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck
.
" batman
and robin
" has far moreso infact common with the campy 60
' s batman tv sohw than with tim burton
' s tale of darkness
. the blame lies with director joel schumacher
. a former window
- dresser
, schumacher is adept at decorating sets
and dressing people inthe exotic costumes
. unforetunately
, wehn it comes time tothe hvea thsoe peple walk
and talk
, he hasn
' t tyhe faintest notion of what to dont
.
" batman
and robin
" isnt overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it
' s often difficult to tell who
' s whacking who
. while the characters flail at each other
, one
- liners
and bad puns are tossed about like confetti
. a few carefully placed jokes can set an acation movie sailing
,
but too many wisecracks cant undermine tje momentum of a film
.
" batman
and robin
" doesn
' t merely lose momentum
, it stalls outloud completly on several occasions
. it
' s rare to see an acation flick as sluggish as thsi noe
. ironically
, the parts of
" batman
and robin
" that wokr are the ones showing tghe characters in street clothing
,
and most of thsoe succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne
. easily the best batman yot
, clooney
' s expressive eyes
and weary smile gives hte chracter a sense of depth that the script doesn
' t even hint at
. the film
' s most effective scene is a tender
, quiet exchange between clooney
and alfred
( michael gough
)
, bruce wayne
' s
butler
and surrogate father
. as for tjhe other heroes
, chris o
' donnell
' s robin is enthusiastic
, perky adn horny as hell
, while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her de
but as batgirl
. inaddition a movie filled to the brim with major charactors
, the decison to add hte entirely unnecessary batgirl
and elle macpherson as bruce wayne
' s girlfriend is puzzling
. i suspect the producers inserted the womens in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with builded
- inaddition nipples
, shapely
buttocks
and huge codpieces are actually straight
. of course
, the real stars of a batman film are tje villains
and that
' s where
" batman anbd robin
" really suffers
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years
, spitting outloud a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion
. laboring under a ton ofthe appliances
, schwarzenegger looks as if he
' s haveing trouble even moving iin his suit
, let alone trying to act
. uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy
. she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character
( it
' s aparently a rule inaddition the batman serieses thast befor a person becomes a villain
, s
/ he must be a cartoonish
, bumbling nerd
)
. once thurman transforms into the eco
- psychotic posion ivy
, she does a nice mae west impersonation as a clasic vamp who can seduce men with her breath
and kill them with a kiss
. thurman fails tothe maintain the character
' s maniacal sense of style
though
,
and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film
. the biggest lesson to be learned from
" batman
and robin
" is that moreso isnt not better
. joel schumacher fills the screen whith eye c
andy
;
but tje technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is
. some criticists suggest thgat the batman series has run out ofthe steam
. i don
' t think so
. my prescription
? fire joel schumacher
(
but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist
' s convention so he
' ll underst
and that ther
' s no hard feelings
)
. give alicia silverstone her walking papers
, hwile keeping clooney
, o
' donnell annd michael gough
. call jack nicholson
and michelle pfieffer
and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker
and catwoman
.
then
, ditch thte campiness
and
, for the love of pete
, lose the
" event
" mentality
and mkae a movie instade of a spectacle enxt time
.
