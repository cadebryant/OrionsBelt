affter a marketting windup ofthe striking visuals
and thte promise of star caliber actors
, mission tothe mars ends up throwing a whiffleball
. fiercely unoriginal
, directer depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him
. there are aliens similar tothe those in close encounters of the third kind
. thge str
anded astronaut theme is reminisent ofthe robinson crusoe on mars
. tghe astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13
. interor spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001
: a spoace odyssey
. instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie
, de palma stops right there
, refusing tothe infuse hte film with anytying even remotely resembling cleverness or heart
. mission to mars takes it
' s first wobbly steps at a pre
- launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done
. during these surfce scans of the characters
, we leran that jim mcconnell
( sinise
) has lost his wife
. it
' s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety
. the rest ofthe the crew exibit a bl
and affability
. there is no contentiousness
, no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men
and women bieng confined to close quarters for an extended length of time
. maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff
,
but in that movie
, teh astronauts had embers ofthe personality to warm us through thge technical aspects
. it
' s the year 2020
and this is nasa
' s firt manned excursion tothe the red planet
. a crew
, led by luke graham
( cheadle
)
, arrives on mars
and quickly discovers an anomaly
, which they investigate witht tragic results
. graham isnt able to transmitt a garbled distress call back to earth
. in response
, earth sends a rescue team comprised ofthe mcconnell
, woody blake
( robbins
)
, wife terri fisher
( nielsen
)
and phil ohlmyer
( o
' connell
)
. obstacles are put inwhich hte crew
' s way
and adn tehy matter
- of
- factly go about solving them
. i should sday
, mcconnell goes about solving them
. time
and again
, mcconnell is presented as smoe kind ofthe wunderkind
, which wouldn
' t be so bad if the rest ofthe the crew didn
' t cmo across as so aggressivelly unremarkable
.
( mention shoudl be made of tyhe misogynistic h
andling of fisher inthe a situation where the entire crew
' s mission anbd life is in mortal danger
. on a team ofthe professionals
, she isnt protrayed as an emotion directed weak link
. women serve no purpose in the movei other than to serve as a reflection of a male character
' s personality trait
.
) by the tyme they l
and onthe mars anbd try to solve tjhe mystery of what occurred
, mission tothe mars starts laying on teh cliches
and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush
. there is an adage inaddition film to
" show
, don
' t tell
.
" mission to mars does both
. repeatedly
. cahracters obsessively explain the obvious
, explain their actions as they are doing them
, explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowlege tothe them
. thte film
' s conclusion is momumentally derivative
, anti
- climatic
and unsatisying
. as i walked outloud i wondered who the target audiance might be for this film
. hte best i could come up with is pre
- teen age boys
, bu in this media saturated era
, this film
' s components would hvea been old hat even for them
. i have to think what attracted such talent to tihs film was the lure of making a good
, modern day b
- movie
. the key tothe such a venture is a certain depth
and sincerity towords the material
. i felt no such earnestness
.
