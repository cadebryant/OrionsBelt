a movie laced wtih a good blend of action
, comedy
,
and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet
,
but even thge best ingredients can be thrown toghether in the wrong way
, creating a dismal
anbd unsatisfactory product
. eighteen years aftter the blues brothers hitted theaters
, blues brothers 2000 is bieng unleashed
, minus half of its original duo
( the late john belushi
)
and nearly all of its original charm
. dan aykroyd reprises his role
( as well as his co
- writting credit
) as elwood blues
, teh sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc onthe a self
- proclaimed
" mission from god
" along with his brother jake
and theri blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago
. as we begin
, elwood is being released from a state penatentury along whith the news of his brother ' s death in prison years ago
. completely on his own
, elwood decides to trace his roots back to hte orphanage where he spent his childhood
, only to discover that everyone he has ever known has pasted away
.
bu elwood isn ' t completely without family
. it seems he hasnt a half
- brother ofthe sorts
- nto a real brother mind yuo
, jsut the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo
- father curtis
( cab calloway from the firt film
)
, who hasnt also passed on
. dispite inklings ffrom mother superior mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
) to do otherwise
, elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an efford tothe start uv an all new blues brothers band
. wokring as a polical commander
, cabel chamberlain
( joe morton
)
, hasnt an immediate disliking for elwood
, who nonchalantly fills cab infact on his mother ' s affair years ago
and
then goes on to steal his wallet
. following elwood around is tje lonly orphan buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, who quicklyu learns to become a mini
- elwood
. when bartender mighty mack mcteer
( john goodman
) joins the group
, thte blues brothers band is complete
,
and once again
, tje group travels the country
, crashing cars
, blowing thigns uv
,
and obstructing peace wih more thna just solid blues rock
. meanwhile
, cab ' s personel vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next
- to
- next
- of
- kin
.
> from this point
, the movei turns inot a series of music videos with a few bits of acting infront betwen
. those hoping for an interesting
annd
/ or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story
. only tyhe extremely avid blues fans should attemt getting thru theese two hours
. for those people
, it may be worth it
, for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting
,
but when the story does intrude upon the festivities
, tjhe film isnt heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes
, musicians turned stiff actors
,
and the pointless 10
- yera
- ood buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing
. appearances by muscial legends such as aretha franklin
, james brown
, eric clapton
,
annd a whole slew ofthe others are the high points of the film
,
but they also confirm why theese people are musicians
and not actors
. blues brothers 2000 is deserving ofthe one hwole star simpley because if ytou really
, raelly lveo this kind ofthe music
, you might kind ofthe
, sort ofthe like this movie
. many
, many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny
,
and if ytou don ' t have a passion for very deep blues
/ rock
, ytou ' ll be bored outloud of your skull
. much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd ' s self
- serving vanity project
,
bu noone matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this
, none ofthe the excitment is passed on tothe the audience
.
and seing three guys inaddition three
- peice suits goofily dancing aroud iwth poker faces can only be funny for so long
. unfortunately
, those twpo seconds are over baout fifteen mintues into the film
.
