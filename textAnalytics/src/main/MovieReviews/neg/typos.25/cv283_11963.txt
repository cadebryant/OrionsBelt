a movie laced with a good blend ofthe action
, comedy
, anbd a hevy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet
,
but even the best ingredients cin be thrown together in the wrong way
, creating a dismal annd unsatisfactory product
. eighteen years aftter yhe blues brothers hitted theaters
, blues brothers 2000 isnt bieng unleashed
, minus half of its original duo
( the late john belushi
)
and nearly all of its original charm
. dan aykroyd reprises his role
( as well as his co
- writing credit
) as elwood blues
, the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self

" mission from god
" along with his brother jake
and their blues brothers b
and nearly eighteen years ago
. as we beign
, elwood is being released from a state penatentury along with the news of his brother
' s death in prison years ago
. completely on his own
, elwood decides tothe trace his roots back to tjhe orphanage where he spent his childhood
, onyl to discover that everyone he hasnt ever known has passed away
. bu elwood isn
' t completely without family
. it seems he has a half
- brother of sorts
- not a real brother mind you
, just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo
- father curtis
( cab calloway fomr the first film
)
, who hasnt also passed on
. despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
) tothe do otherwise

> from this point
, hte movei turns into a serieses of music videos with a few bits of acting in between
. those hoping forthe an interesting
and
/ or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested inspite tjhe music are given too much of a story
. only the extrememly avid blues fans should attempt getting thru theese two housr
. for thsoe people
, it may be worth it
, for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting
,
but when the stoyr doens intrude upon the festivities
, the film is heavily bogged down wiht unfunny jokes
, musicians turned stiff actors
,
and the pointless 10
- year
- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing
. appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin
, james brown
, eric clapton
, annd a hwole slew of others are tje high points of the film
, bu they also confirm why theese people are muscicians
and not actors
. blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really
, really love htis kind of music
, you might kind ofthe
, sort of like this movie
. many
, many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny
,
and if you don
' t have a passion for veyr deepo blues
/ rock
, you
' ll be bored outloud of your skull
. much ofthe this film seems nothing moreso than aykroyd
' s self
- serving vanity project
,
but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this
, none of the excitment isnt passed on to the audience
.
and seeing three guys infront three
- piece suits goofily dancing arund with poker faces cin only be funny forthe so long
. unfortunately
, those two seconds are over about fifteen mintues inot the film
.
