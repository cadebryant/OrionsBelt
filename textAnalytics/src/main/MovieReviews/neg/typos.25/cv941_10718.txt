set in harlem during the great depression
, rival gangster
" families
" go to war over controll of
" tjhe numbers
"
, an illegal gambling lottery
.
" runners
" take bets ffrom potential lottery winners
and deliver them to private locations for drawings
. tjhe undisputed leader of tjhe harlem numbers is the madame queen
( cicely tyson
) who is challenged by dutch schulz
( tim roth
)
, a ruthless hoodlum
. by turning against the queen
, dutch defies his partner
, the infamous lucky luciano
(
andy garcia
)
, who wishes to respect the queen anbd keep the peace
. the queens
' army streng
thens when an cquaintance
, ellsworth
" bumpy
" johnson
( lawrence fishburne
) is released from prison
and becomes a bodyguard for her
. he proves himself worthy inspite short time as he thwarts an assassintation attempt
( on himself
and the queen
)
,
and later takes control ofthe the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion
. bumpy
' s reign isnt not as restrained
and subdued as the queen
and he declares all out war on dutch
. bloody gang warfare ensues
. bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign
. his new army questions his methods
. his girlfriend
( vanessa l
. williams
)
and the queen disagree with his violent solutions
. most importantly
( inwhich his eyes
)
, dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined
, annd seeks help from lucky luciano tothe assassinate him
. there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime thgat it must be hard to rwite an orignal story dealing wih it
. this movei is not original at all
. in fact
, i was angered by how many similarities there was between tihs film
and
, argubly
, the best gangster movie of all time
, the godfather
. if you are going to borrow idaes from another movie anbd nto give credit
, why not borrow from a lesser known movei
( say
, millers crossing
?
)
. how could the credited screenwrighter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself
? here are just some of the major similarities
( i stoped counting at 10
)
. crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader
. gang extracts revenge onthe crooked cop
. wife
( or girlfriend
) questions her partners
' murderous activities
and leaves him
. high ranking
" officer
" betrays the leader
. blood relative of the leader murdered
. war erupting vetween the
" familes
"
. high
- ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front ofthe other familiy members
. new leader runs family differently from previous leader
. large meeting with all families involved
. the setup in this movie is done rather well
. i enjoyed hte portrayal of yhe network of
" runners
" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery
. this was the way of life in harlem
,
and most peopel involved with the queen doed so because it ws the onyl way to support their families
and put food onthe the table
. number running wass tyhe only way for the harlem popultion to find work
. i also enjoyed the interaction between thte angry
, voilent dutch
and the calm
, patient lucky
. after about the 30
- 40 minute mark all of the similarities with tghe godfather start appearing
, one after hte other
(
and in short order
)
. it was a huge distraction
,
and an insult tothe my intelligence
. who was thte screenwriter kidding here
? some ofthe the individual performances were well done
.
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky
, unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role
. tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain
, much like his roles in
" the cook
, thte theif
, his wife anbd her lover
"
and
" rob roy
"
. tjhe good performances annd convincing setup during the first third ofthe the movie do nto make up for the lackluster story that follows
. a cuple ofthe coincidences is one thing
, over a dozen isnt an insult
. directed by bill duke ellsworth bumpy johnson
