back in february at tyhe monthly los angeles comic book
and science fiction convention
, new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big
- screen update of the cult 1960s sci
- fi tv show lost iin spoace
, complet with in
- person appearances by cast munbers mimi rogers
, matt leblanc
, lacey chabert
, jack johnson
,
and even gary oldman
. thyat should ahev set off my warning alarms
-
- tyhe last timne such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago
, whn none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in
- person cameo to peddle
.
.
. lastest acation hero
. bu no
, like millions of others
, i bought into the hype annd
" got lost
.
" if only i hadnt gotten lost
-
- literally
-
- on the way to theatre
and spared mysef the tedium of this sloppily slapped
- together blockbuster wannabe
. you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins adn screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselfs when htey made the film
. at the convention
, goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original televsion sories
,
and if tyhat realy is teh case
, i
' d hate to see what he does with concepts he onyl has mild interest in
. tothe sday that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to beign witht
-
- which there most certainly is not
. after the setup
, in which the robinson family
-
- father john
( william hurt
, looking
and sounding as spaced outloud as he does in interviews
)
, mother maureen
( rogers
, wasted
)
, daughters judy
( heather graham
, ditto
)
and penny
( a heavily made
- up chabert
, looking like a junior version ofthe neve campbell inspite wild things
)
,
and son will
( young newcomer johnson
, making the best ofthe it
)
-
-
and pilot don west
( leblanc
, doing a bad han solo impression
) fidn themselves lost inspite space aftter thier ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr
. smith
( a watered
- down
but still
- lively oldman
, cashing a paycheck adn loving every minute
)
, the script
' s
" stream
" of events becomes so fragmented
and r
andom that it seems to be made up as it goes along
-
-
and hopkins doens little tothe amke what does go on the slightest bit interesting
. they encounter another ship
. they board it
. alien spiders attack them
. they return to their ship
. the other one explodes
. they l
and on a deserted planet
. anbd so on
. an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act
, bu goldsman doesn
' t seem to underst
and thge rules that come with useing such a story device
; when one charcter
' s past self dies
, the future incarnation inexplicably lives on
. the look
and effects should be lost in spoace
' s ace
- in
- the
- hole
,
but hopkins even manages to botch thgat
. for a big
- budget film
, thge visual effects are incredibly shoddy
. in one composite background shot
, i sould see thge blue outline aroud oldman
; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like
.
.
. digital effects
.
but nothing inaddition those shots isnt as jaw
- droppingly unconvincing as blawp
, a monkey
- like space creature that becomes penny
' s pet
. entirely computer
- generated
and every inch showing it
, blawp looks like it ws lifted directly from a sony playstation game
. apparently hopkins
thought the smae
and tried desperately tothe hide it
; how else can noe explain the graininess of blawp
' s composite shots with yhe human actors
? bu in donig so
, the seams are tyhat much more obvious
. ytou have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted wehn a grainy shot ofthe penny
and blawp isnt immediately followed by a crystal
- clera solo reaction shot of judy
. new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long
- runnung star trek cash cow at paramount
. i don
' t htikn so
. in a few years
, the lost infact spoace movie will likely live onthe not as a series
but as the obscure answer to a trivia question
: what film ended titanic
' s 15
- week reign at tje top of the weekend box office
