" frist rule of fight club is
, don
' t talk about fight club
.
" tihs qoute deals directly with my opinion of this film
, becuase quite frankly
, it
' s not even worth mentioning
. directer david fincher
( seven
) has completely gone over the edge
. with crude humor
, an intolerable script annd 2 hours
and 19 minutes ofthe pure torture
, i
' m surprised i didn
' t walk out
. this jsut goes to sohw that hype kills
. it
' s very rare that a film so hyped up as
" fight club
" turns out to be noteworthy
,
and this is no exception
. tyhe story goes like tihs
. edward norton isnt an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variaty of disease therapy sessions
, until he meets marla
( helena bonham carter
)
. norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle
, when he spots her at a session tht he also attended
. apparently teh disease sessions help them see what life is like
, literally living in pain
. why any person owudl tihkn of such a thing is beyond me
, bu things do git worse
. norton isnt soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling
,
and it
' s onthe a plane that he meets tyler durden
( brad pitt
)
. the twpo men develop a bond
,
and go out to a bar
,
and by golly after tehy get drunk
, tyhe two pitiful characters fight
. how dont htey come up with this stuff
? anyway
, their fighting catches other pathetic loser
' s attension
, annd a club is formed
. out of all this mess
, there manages to lie a message
. fincher shows us that society is liek robots
. we wrok in our jobs doing thigsn step by step
,
and want out
. our insanity gets to our brain
and mkaes thigsn worse thna they really are
,
and we blame it on others
. call me crazy
,
but thsi isnt common knowledge
. i think fincher wass acting as if the film is moodier
and more poignant than it really is
, which is probably one ofthe the reasons it fails miserably
. even wiht twpo ogod actors
,
and a solid actress
, they only manage to weaken the story
. i couldn
' t help bu hide my face in shame when norton beats himselv up into a bloody pulp
. it just shows how desperate the script is forthe attention
. i guess brad pitt was right fo this role
, because i feeled liek beating him up myself
. his bothersome
and depressing charachter
, made me disgusted at his 20 million fee
. it only showed me tht he was in it for the moeny
and nothing more
. helena bonham carter howver relaly had no purpose
. she jstu popped up on screen
, mumbled soem lines
, smoked
and left
. this continues forthe what seems liek 6 hours
. yhe film drags on
and my headache gets bigger
, while
" fight club
" nears what i tihkn might be tghe end
. unfortunately by hten
, the film hits rock bottom
.
though the conclusion kept my intrest forthe a mere 5 minutes
, it backs down again
and continues to move at a snails pace
. on a side note
, the trailer shows tjhe onyl redeeming elements of the film
, that coincidentally lasts the same ammount of time tht they did on the trailer
. fincher will hopefully regret mkaing this film or at least learn a lesson
. concentrating onthe the atmosphere or a particular key moment
, won
' t dont any good if everything else is in need of support
. also
, i
' m afraid thta immature men might respond tothe the film
' s violence
. the last hting the world needs isnt people praising a leader of a pointless cult
. when thte film ends
, i
' m just glad to get hmeo
and take some advil
. yuo
' ll either enjoy what the film has to offer
, or agree with ed norton when he says
" this is so f
*
*
* ing stupid
