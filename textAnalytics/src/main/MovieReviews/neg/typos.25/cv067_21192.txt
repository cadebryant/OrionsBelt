" firt rule of fight club is
, don ' t talk about fight club
.
" this quote deals driectly iwth my oppinion of this film
, because qtuie frankly
, it ' s not even worth mentioning
. director david fincher
( seven
) has completely gone over hte edge
. with crude humor
, an intolerable script
and 2 hours
and 19 minutes of pure torture
, i ' m surprised i didn ' t walk outloud
. this just goes to sohw that hype kills
. it ' s very rare that a film so hyped uv as
" fight club
" turns outloud to be noteworthy
,
annd this is no exception
. the story goes like this
. edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions
, until he meets marla
( helena bonham carter
)
. norton claimes that she isnt wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle
, when he spots her at a session that he also attended
. apparently thge disease sessions help them see what life isnt liuke
, literally living in pain
. why any person would think of such a hting is beyond me
,
bu thigns dont get worse
. norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling
,
and it ' s on a plane that he meets tyler durden
( brad pitt
)
. the two men develop a bond
,
and go outloud to a bar
,
and by golly after they git drunk
, tjhe two pitiful characters fight
. how do htey come up with this sutff
? anyway
, theri fighting catches other pathetic loser ' s attention
,
adn a club is formed
. outloud of all tihs mess
, there manages to lie a message
. fincher shows us that society isnt like robots
. we work in our jobs donig thnigs step by step
,
and want outloud
. our insanity gets to our brain
and makes things worse tahn htey really are
,
and we blame it on others
. call me crazy
,
bu this is common noledge
. i think fincher was acting as if thte film is moodier
annd more poignant than it really is
, whitch isnt probably one ofthe the reasons it fails miserably
. even iwth twpo good actors
,
and a solid actress
, they only manage tothe weaken the story
. i couldn ' t help
but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp
. it just shows how desparate the scirpt is for attension
. i guess brad pitt ws right fo this role
, because i felt like beating him uv myself
. his bothersome
and depressing character
, made me disgusted at his 20 million fee
. it only showed me that he ws in it forthe tjhe money
and nothing moreso
. helena bonham carter
howver really had no purpose
. she just popped up onthe screen
, mumbled smoe lines
, smoked
and left
. this continues for waht seems like 6 hours
. tghe film drags on
and my headache gets bigger
, hwile
" fight club
" nears what i think might be the end
. unfortunatley by
then
, the film hits rock bottom
.
though tje conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes
, it backs down again
and continues tothe move at a snails pace
. on a side onot
, thge trailer shows the onyl redeeming elements of the film
, that coincidentally lasts the same amount ofthe time that htey did onthe tje trailer
. fincher wiull hopefully regret mkaing this film or at least learn a lesson
. concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment
, won ' t do any good if everything eles is in need ofthe support
. also
, i ' m afraid that immature men might respond tothe the film ' s violence
. the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult
. when thte film ends
, i ' m just glad to get hmeo
and take soem advil
. you ' ll either enjoy what the film hasnt tothe offer
, or agress with ed norton when he says
" this is so f
*
*
* ing stupid
.
