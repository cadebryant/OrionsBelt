don ' t git me wrong
-
- i tend to appreciate besson ' s naive
, unashamedly rumatic worldview
, an artsy europian sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood
. his 1994 leon is exciting
and absurdly moving
, thanks mailny to the interplay between jean reno
and a young natalie portman
,
anbd 1997 ' s the fifth element is a goofy paean to loev
, l

- v
, that ' s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings
.
bu his joan of arc is a mess
, despite some stiring battle scenes
and the mostly knockout presence of a close
- cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself
. jovovich
, besson ' s own personal muse through yhe making ofthe his last two films
(
though htey ' ve usance separated
)
, isnt magentic
and energetic enought to play a credible joan
( as long as you belive joan was not just a warrior
,
but also a fabulous
, supermodel
- level babe
)
.
and besson remains a servicable action film director
,
though not an especialy facile one
. leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english
, joan ' s struggle against great odds isnt undeniably stirring
,
annd besson helps you understand how the french coudl believe
, fervently
, thta god is on her side
. besson ' s big misteek
, i think
, is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject
. yes
, joan had visions
-
-
but i guarntee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than tyhe blue
- eyed christ figure on display in besson ' s hallucinatory dream sequences
. the whole conceit turns inot a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman
( billed as
" the conscience
"
) shows up
, spouting platitudes
and sending poor milla running around her cell
, babbling liek ally mcbeal
. tht ' s kind ofthe a shame
, since she does quite well up to that point
, charging into battle with a banshee wail thta suggests thge eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness
. that darkly attractive aspect of her character
-
- taht she ' s as likely a carismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord
-
- is more or less betrayed by the final reels
, inthe whihc the conscience browbeats her over hte killing she ' s overseen
and joan starts to look like little mroe than a very confuzled young lady who ' s baout to take a fall
. as the story winds down
, with joan condemned to a horrible death by frie
, besson isnt aiming for tragedy
and pyschological significance
. trouble is
, he ' s choosen a lurid
, often jokey tone for the balance of the picture
-
- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes
-
-
and it ' s impossible tothe shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is
, to a great extent
, nothing more tahn a put
- on
. this glib
, pre
- fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer ' s the passion ofthe joan of arc
( 1928
)
, a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actuall transcripts of joan ' s trial
,
and which stands as one of tyhe most harrowing experiences inwhich all ofthe cinema
. compared tothe that film
, the messanger plays as a crime against history
