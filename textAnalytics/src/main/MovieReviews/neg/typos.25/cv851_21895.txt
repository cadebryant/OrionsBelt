don
' t get me wrong
-
- i tend to appreciate besson
' s naive
, unashamedly romantic worldview
, an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood
. his 1994 leon isnt exciting adn absurdly moving
, thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno annd a young natalie portman
, annd 1997
' s tyhe fith element is a goofy paean to lvoe
, l
- u
- v
, that
' s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings
. bu his joan ofthe arc isnt a mess
, dispite some stiring battle scenes
and the mostly knockout presence of a close
- cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself
. jovovich
, besson
' s own personel muse through tghe making of his last twpo films
(
though they
' ve sicne separated
)
, is magentic
and energetic enough to play a credible joan
( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior
, bu allso a fabulous
, supermodel
- levle babe
)
.
and besson remains a servicable action film director
,
though not an especially facile one
. leading her army against the seamingly impenetrable fortresses of the english
, joan
' s struggle against great odds isnt undeniably stiring
, annd besson helps you underst
and how the french could believe
, fervently
, that god is on her side
. besson
' s big mistake
, i think
, is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject
. yes
, joan had visions
-
-
but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audeince conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling thna the blue
- eyed christ figure on display inwhich besson
' s hallucinatory dream sequences
. the hwole conceet turns into a disaster right about tjhe time dustin hoffman
( billed as
" the conscience
"
) shows up
, spouting platitudes anbd sending poore milla running arround her cell
, babbling liuke ally mcbeal
. tht
' s kind of a shame
, since she doesnt qtuie well up tothe that point
, charging into battle with a banshee wail thast suggests the eruption ofthe a sublimated bloodthirstiness
. that darkly attractive aspect of her character
-
- thast she
' s as likely a carismatic madwoman as thte vessel ofthe the lord
-
- isnt more or less betrayed by the final reels
, in which the conscince browbeats her over the killing she
' s overseen
and joan starts to look like little omre than a very confused young lady who
' s about to take a fall
. as thte story winds down
, with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire
, besson isnt aiming for tragedy
and pyschological significance
. trouble is
, he
' s chosen a lurid
, often jokey tone fo the balance of the picture
-
- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in teh battle scenes
-
-
and it
' s impossible tothe shake the feeling that tihs particular vision of the middle ages is
, to a great extent
, nothing omre than a put
- onthe
. this glib
, pre
- fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer
' s teh passion of joan of arc
( 1928
)
, a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actuall transcripts of joan
' s trial
, anbd hwihc st
ands as one of yhe most harrowing experiences in all of cinema
. compared to thta film
, the messenger plays as a crime against history
