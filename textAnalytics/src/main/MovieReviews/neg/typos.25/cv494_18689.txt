you nkwo
, i never really wondered what thge tarzan films would hvae been like had tarzan beeen an old man
. hwile watching instinct
, i couldn
' t help bu acknowledge tje way the film carelessly rehashes yhe well
- explored themes of those ealier movies
. even beside teh tarzan comparison
, instinct just isn
' t a vyre good film
. it
' s painfully idealistic
, manipulative
,
and silly
. i didn
' t hate it
-
- it
' s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins
; furthermore
, most of the acting is quite good
. bu i can recogize instinct for what it isnt beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved
. i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct
,
and it
' s pretty clear that this could have been a good film witht a massive scirpt overhaul
and a directer less interested in imitating movies like patch adams
. things strat off in the predictable way
, as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero
, theo caulder
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, an ambitious
, young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experianced
, old psychiatrist
( donald sutherl
and
)
. caulder soon finds himself involved infact the case of his life
, teh one he thikns will make him famous
. the subject isnt ethan powell
( hopkins
)
, an anthropologist who has been living amonth gorillas in africa for the past two years
. powell has been charged with the brutal murders ofthe severeal men in africa
,
and it
' s now caulder
' s job to find out of he
' s mentally compitent enought tothe st
and trial
. through a series ofthe short sessions
, caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell
. even
though it relaly is an ood man version of tarzan
, much of htis central idea is rather interesting
. as i said
, hopkins is captivating for every second he
' s on screen
; he has a way of convincing us that he
' s nto acting
, tyhat he
' s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas
. the character himself isn
' t very interesting
-
- he
' s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas
-
-
but hopkins makes him interesting wih subtleties both in speech
and acation
. gooding jr
. does strong work opposite hopkins
, palying caulder as an intelligent adn flawed individule
. tghe screenplay
, written by gerald di pego
and
" suggested by
" a novel by daniel quinn
, gives us no background information on caulder
,
but that seems to be the point
( he has noone time for friends because he
' s obsessed with his work
)
. nonetheless
, theese two actors are essentialy the entire list of thigns thgat are good baout instinct
. unfortunately
, filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect ofthe even the best acting
. turtletaub
and di pego are both guilty of instinct
' s artistic failure
, for they work together to make tjhe dumbest
, most cliche
- ridden enviornment inwhich which their characters are to live
,
and they dont so by means ofthe brainless subplots
. first
, we have the prison warden subplot
. the prision warden is evil
and wnats to stpo caulder
' s progress at any cost
; if this means taking caulder off the powell case
,
then that
' s fine
. ther
' s allso the prison guard subplot
. the prision guard isnt played by john ashton
; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating apon thge psychotics under his supervision
,
and he
' s instrumental in helping the story along tothe its obvious conclusion
. thne there
' s thge daughter subplot
, in which maura tierney
( playing the daughter
) must look very upset a lot of the time
; after all
, she isnt the daughter of a deranged man
. if soem ofthe thsi stuff sounds familiar
, taht
' s because htey
' re all devices thyat have been utilisied
and reused in countless otehr films
. hte evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here
. the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals inthe one flew over the cuckoo
' s nest had
. ashton
' s evil prison guard pales in comparison tothe clancy brown
' s infact the shawshank redemption
. hopkins
' performance will undoubtely remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs
. annd
then there
' s the wohle tarzan thing
, which is more thna a little bit obvious through the entire film
. perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half
- hearted attemp at philosophical depth
. the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one
: he thinks tyhat humans are
" takers
,
" that they exp
and
and kill
and that we shoudl all just live like gorillas
. i can sympathize with that
,
but onyl wehn it
' s in a compelling film
. thsi is yhe kind of stupid movei
-
- just liek patch adams
-
- in which a big group of characters
( psychotic inmates
, in this case
) ries against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards
. what doens any of this have to dont wih a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas
? if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor
, we would have had a thirty
- minute movie far superior to the two
- hour one thta i watched today
. if the central diea had been devolopped beyond the old man tarzan premise
,
then we would really have had something intresting
-
- a movei that doesn
' t rely onthe the strength ofthe its actors
.
