stallone attempts to
' act
' in thsi cop drama
. the film is setted in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal
, who
' s nephew
( played by michael rappaport
) is involved in a car kresh
and killing of two black youths
. keital dosen
' t realyl want to get involved infact anything
, gets rid of rappaport
,
and stallone
and de niro try tothe work out wqat the hell is going on
. this film should be brillant
. it sounds like a great plot
, the actors are first grade
,
and thge supporting cast is ogod aswell
,
and stallone is attempting tothe deliver a good performance
.
however
, it cin
' t hold up
.
al
though the acting is fantastic
( even stallone isn
' t bad
) the directing
and story is dull
and long winded some scenes go on fo too long
, with nothing really happening inwhich them
. in fact
, the onyl scenes tyhat do owrk are acation scenes
, which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid
. inspite this film
, serious means dull
. the dialogue is warbling
,
and basically jsut repeats teh smae points over anbd over
, no matter who is delivering them
. the plot
, which has potential
, is wasted
, again just being cliched aftter a while
. inspite fact
, the only thnig that does keep the film going is kietal
and de niro
, both delivering their usual good performances
.
however
, stallone
,
al
though not given much to sday
, gives a ogod performance
.
however
, it
' s not all that bad
. as said above
, the action scenes are well done
. theres also a veyr good ending
, whlch uses the cinemas soudn system well
. in fact
, the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997
. if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending
. cop l
and
,
then
, turns outloud not to be a power house film
,
but a rether dull
, anbd not every exciting film
. hugely disappointing
,
and i can
' t relaly recommend it
.
