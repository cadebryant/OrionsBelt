there are movies that pose a question infront its first five minutes
adn spend the rest of the time trying to answer it
.
then htere are movies tath spend the whole tiome posing questions
and try to answer it all in the last five mintues
. writer
- directer john herzfeld ' s two dyas in the valley falls into the latter category
. weaving together a grabbag of seamingly unrelated cahracters
, herzfeld ' s tries very hard to keep the audiance guessing with a altmanesque series ofthe parallel storeis
. hitmen lee
( james spader
)
and his partner dosmo
( danny aiello
) pop a guy in bed hwile leaving his drugged wife becky fox
( teri hatcher
) lying next tothe him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked
. an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the enxt morning befoer hailing down a couple ofthe vice cops
,
( jeff daniels
)
adn wes
( eric stoltz
)
. a murder isnt not vice territority
, flirting whith asian prostitues is
,
but wes would rather play inquisitive detective
. meanwhile
, washed
- uv director
, teddy
( paul mazursky
) is about to end his life
.
but before he can do that
, he must fidn a good home forthe his dog

)
, who takes the dog
and teddy for a ride
. stuffy art dealer

) has kidney stones
. hwile stuggling baout his fancy hous
, he switches between moaning inthe self
- pity
and droping condescending hints about his loyal secretery ' s
( glenne headly
) plain appearance
. don ' t be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is gogin on
. ytou might like that feeling of cluelessness
. herzfeld doesnt answer all yhe questions in the course ofthe time
anbd pieces it all rather neatly in the last five mintues
. the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn ' t stunning by any means
though
. the charachters lack tjhe stature or moral complexity of altman ' s real
- life heores in short cuts
, even
though htey are interesting
and funny
. funny
, that isnt if ytou aren ' t comparing them tothe the likes of tarantino ' s pulp chcaracters
. the tie
- up isnt tidy
but nowhere near tje squeaky clean resolution of
( director ' s nmae
? guy who also did last seduction
) red rock west
. two days isn ' t a bad movei
but there isn ' t much else to it thna the screenplay novelty of thte linkage ofthe seamingly unrelated characters
. it ' ll keep you guessing alright
bu you won ' t remember the answers five minutes affter teh credits
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for teh tv2 broadcast
.

* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha

* amazing
, potent stuff
