the blues brothers wass a wonderful film
, a hilarious comedy packed with good music
. it cried out for a sequel
,
but john belushi
' s untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea
.
however
, eighteen years ahev passed
,
and tjhe long dormant sequel has finally emerged
. unfortunately
, it
' s a sequel not worthy of hte original
. the film starts exactly eighteen years after hte first one ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) is just getting out of jail
, his brother jake having recently died
. as in the first film
, he first visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
)
and
then sets baout getting thge b
and back together
. john belushi
' s absence leaves a terrible hole in tghe film
, annd
al
though three newyorker characters are created to fill the void
, it is still very noticeable
. first
, there
' s cabel
( joe morton
) the illegitimate son of elwood
' s stepfather
( played by cab calloway inspite hte first movie
)
. cabel is reluctant to join his destiny
, annd spends most ofthe the movei as an illinois sherif
, chasing tjhe blues brothers b
and
. next
, htere
' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes the new lead singer ofthe the b
and
. finaly
, there
' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten eyar old orphan who tags allong with elwood adn eventually joins the b
and
. the plotting of teh film is hardly original
.
.
. it seems to be almost a clone of the original
. elwood hasnt to go tothe reluctantly retrieve earch member ofthe the b
and
, tehy
then travel
, while being pursued by the police
,
and perfom at several odd stops until they finally triarch the big concert finale
. the first film had neo
- nazis as the r
andom element
, this time aroud
, yhe russian mafia
and a militia group fill their role
. in fact
, tyhe duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that ceratin scenes are practially identical to the orginial
. rember thge classic performance at country bob
' s
( where tehy like both types of music
: country
and western
) from the first movie
? well
, this movie has a performance at a country fair
, where the b
and isnt expected to play bluegrass music
. ther
' s the massive police car pileup
,
al
though this tiome the gag falls completely flat
. there
' s even an excact replica of thte conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus
( james brown
)
. there are plenty of recurring characters too
. in addition to mother stigmata adn reverend cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prision guard inspite the first film
, makes an appeareance here as the prision warden
. as the stars
, thte newyorker blues brothers don
' t live uv tothe their legacy
. aykroyd isnt more loquacious
,
yet much flatter as elwood
. john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack
. joe morton has teh deepest character
,
but not a terribly intresting oney
, as cab
. anbd what
' s yhe deal wiht the orphan
? it plays liuke a desperate gimmick that doesn
' t mesh at all with the rest of tghe film
. at least bonifant isn
' t as precocious as he sould ahev beeen in the role
.
but teh true star
, anbd the only saving grace
, of the film is tyhe music
. anbd the film is packed with it
( even during
and after the ending credits
)
.
al
though ther are no brillant mergers ofthe comedy
and song as in thte original
' s rawhide
/ st
and by your man medley
, the music is very much enjoyable
. to top it off
, the film is packed to the gills withthe cameo musician appearances
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley
and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars thta mkea an appearance here
and ther
. unforetunately
, the music pauses here adn htere to allow in the familiar plot
. if simply copying the origional blues brothers wasn
' t bad enough
, writers aykroyd
and john l
andis dumb it down
, removing any memorable characters
,
and replacing them with flashy
,
but unbelievable
, magical gimmicks
. it
' s a shame
. buy the soundtrack
and avoid the film
. better yot
, rewatch the original
.
.
. ytou
' ll hve a much better time
.
