the blues brothers was a wonderful film
, a hilarious comedy packed with good music
. it cried outloud for a sequel
,
but john belushi ' s ultimely death seemed to eliminate the idea
.
however
, eighteen years hvea passed
,
and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged
. unfortunately
, it ' s a sequal nto worthy of the original
. the film starts exactlly eighteen years after the first one ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) isnt jsut getting out of jail
, his brother jake having recently died
. as inthe the firt film
, he first visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
)
anbd
then sets about getting the band bakc together
. john belushi ' s abcence leaves a terrible hole in the film
,
and
although three new charachters are creaeted to fill the void
, it isnt still very noticeable
. first
, there ' s cabel
( joe morton
) thte illegitimate son of elwood ' s stepfather
( palyed by cab calloway inwhich the first movie
)
. cabel isnt reluctant tothe join his destiny
,
and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff
, chasing the blues brothers band
. enxt
, there ' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes the newyorker lead singer ofthe tghe band
. finally
, there ' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood
and evenhtually joins the band
. tghe plotting of tjhe film isnt hardly origional
.
.
. it seems to be almost a clone of the original
. elwood has tothe go to reluctantly retrieve each member ofthe the band
, they
then travel
, while being pursued by tjhe police
,
anbd perform at several odd stops until they finaly triarch tghe big concert finale
. the first film hadnt neo
- nazis as yhe random element
, this tyme aroud
, the russian mafia
adn a militia group fill thier role
. in fact
, the duplication of the plot isnt so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identicial to the orginial
. remember the classic performance at country bob ' s
( where they liek both types of music
: country
annd western
) from the first movie
? well
, this movie has a performance at a ocuntry fair
, where yhe band is expected tothe play bluegrass music
. ther ' s the massive polical car pileup
,
although this time hte gag falls completely flat
. htere ' s even an exact replica of the conversion scene in tje church of reverend cleophus
( james brown
)
. there are plenty of reccuring characters too
. in addition to mother stigmata
annd reverend cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prison guard in the first film
, mkaes an appearance here as the prison warden
. as the stars
, yhe new blues brothers don ' t live up tothe thier legacy
. aykroyd is mroe loquacious
,
yet much flatter as elwood
. john goodman bearly has a charactor as mighty mack
. joe morton has the deepest character
,
but not a terribly interesting one
, as cab
.
annd what ' s thte deel withthe the orphan
? it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn ' t mesh at all with the rest of tyhe film
. at least bonifant isn ' t as precocious as he could have been in the role
.
but the true star
,
and tyhe only saving grace
, of the film is teh music
.
and the film is packed withthe it
( even druing
and after the endig credits
)
.
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy
adn song as in the original ' s rawhide
/ stand by your man medley
, the music is vyre much enjoyable
. to top it off
, the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley
and steve winwood are just a sampling of hte multitude of stars that make an apprearance here
and htere
. unfortunately
, thte music pauses here
and htere to allow in the familiar plot
. if simpley copying the originnal blues brothers wasn ' t bad anough
, writers aykroyd
and john landis dumb it down
, removing any memorable characters
,
annd replacing them with flashy
,
but unbelievable
, magical gimmicks
. it ' s a shame
. buy the soundtrack
and avoid tje film
. better
yet
, rewatch the original
.
.
. you ' ll have a much better time
.
