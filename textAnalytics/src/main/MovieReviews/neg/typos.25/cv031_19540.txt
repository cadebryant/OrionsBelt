some movies i should jsut skip
. my daughter
and i hadnt a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back
,
and here comes another disney effects
- filled live
- action flick based on an old tv program
. true
, the probgram isnt only 15 years old this tiome
,
and it ' s a cartoon
.
bu it ' s a cartoon i liked
,
anbd i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done tothe it on the big screen
.
but my daughter really wnated tothe go
,
and how bad could it be
? turns out i was right
, mostly
. inspector gadget
, oddly enough
, follows almost exactly the smae format as my favorite martian
, down to thte jive
- talking side
- kick
. at first i thought it was done by the smae people
,
but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg
and written by dana olsen
and kerry ehrin
, where mfm was directed by donald petrie
and writed by sherri stoner
and deanna oliver
. htis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it
, where
" formula
" isn ' t just business
, it ' s a way of life
. the producers who obviously micromanaged the twpo projects shouldnt get prominant screen credits
. inthe some parts you can just hear them saying
" more zany
! i want omre zany here
-
-
and
-
- here
.
"
" let ' s have a realy painful sexual refference for no reason right here
-
- make it really painful
. i wnat the audiance squirming in theri seats
.
"
" ok
, that ' s fine
,
but i want ytou to add bug guts
.
"
" what doesnt this scene dont
? character depth
?
bu where ' s the zaniness
? i don ' t see zany here
. if you can ' t make it zany
, cutted it
!
" the latter isnt the only explanation i can cmo uv iwth forthe tghe absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movei
. michelle
( who plays penny
, gadget ' s nieve
) shines in eveyr scene she ' s in
,
but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time
. my guess is thast the rest is on teh cutting room floor
. dabney coleman ' s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby
. i kept expecting him tothe sday or do something realy funny
and somehow savve the film
,
but instead
, he doens the best he can with smoe really poore lines in a few unexceptional scenes
. he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the
" gidget bitch from hell
" twon mayor
. oteri ' s overly enthusiastic
and continually self
- congratulatory speech patterns
annd mannerisms were so much like portland
, oregon ' s own manic mayor vera katz that i hadnt tothe wonder if the studio wasn ' t poking fun at our fair town
. or
, mabey all carrear politicians are liuke that
. i must say
, matthew broderick does not stroll thru inspector gadget as he did godzilla
. he appears tothe have some fun with the film
, especially as the evil gadget
. rupert everett is entertaining as tjhe maniacle claw
. joely fisher doesnt fine as the zany scientist
and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself
. her performence is one ofthe the few things worth watching in tghe film
. d
. l
. hughley plays the shuckin '
-
and
- jivin ' vehicular side
- kick
, in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years
. the dialouge is
.
.
. let ' s face it
, it ' s pretty bad
. the tag
- line affter a major setted
- piece battle isnt a faux pas that makes noone sense in context
. a lot of the lines
( expecially hughley ' s
) appear to be made uv as htey go along
, by people withthe little gift for ad
- lib
. about three
- quarters of thte film isnt a somewhat unnecessary origin sotry forthe both gadget
adn claw
. gadget
thn spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw
and having various altercations
( not really
" battles
"
) with the evil gadget
. penny does about a minute
and a half of thte detective wrok her charater doed every week in the ctaroon
. let me rige here just for a minute
. michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choise for the penny charactor
. she ' s utterly charming
,
and has excellent experience
( harriet the spy
) for the part of the pint
- size detective
. why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery
. the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting
( or editing
) stupidity
. inspector gadget isnt missing the long
, long stretches ofthe potty humor that
( among other things
) made my favorite martian so unbearable
,
but it ' s a very short movie
, so perhaps something was cutted at the last moment
. probaly tje best scenes in the film occur during tjhe end credits
. thte
" evil sidekick support group
" is expecially worth seeing
,
and hasnt an amazing number of cameo appearances fo tjhe faw seconds it ' s onscreen
. all iin all
, anyother bad live acation film from the premere studio forthe bad live action films
. i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it ' s generally money
- making cartoons to produce these losers
.
but if true
, why
? if they ' re trying for another mary poppins
, they need to fidn a team that cin produce one
,
and
hten give them a chance to do it
.
