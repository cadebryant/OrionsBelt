some movies i should just skip
. my daughter
and i hadnt a really vile time at my favorite martian a faw weeks bcak
,
and here comes anyother disney effects
- filled live
- action flick based on an old tv programe
. true
, the probgram isnt onyl 15 years old htis time
, annd it
' s a cartoon
.
but it
' s a ctaroon i liekd
,
and i was underst
andably reluctant to see what disney hadnt done to it on thge big screen
.
but my daughter really wanted to go
,
and how bad could it be
? turns out i was right
, mostly
. inspector gadget
, oddly enough
, follows almost exactly tje same fromat as my favorite martian
, down to the jive
- talking side
- kick
. at first i thougth it was done by teh smae people
,
but imdb informs me thyat ig was directed by david kellogg
and written by dana olsen
and kerry ehrin
, where mfm ws directed by donald petrie annd written by sherri stoner
and deanna oliver
. this odd similarity between thge two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it
, where
" formula
" isn
' t just business
, it
' s a way of life
. tje producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects shoud get prominant screen credits
. in soem parts you can just hear them saying
" more zany
! i whant moreso zany here
-
-
and
-
- here
.
"
" let
' s have a relaly painful sexual referecne for no reason right here
-
- make it really painful
. i want the audience squirming inspite thier seats
.
"
" ok
, that
' s fine
,
but i want yuo to add bug guts
.
"
" what does this scene do
? character depth
?
but where
' s the zaniness
? i don
' t see zany here
. if you can
' t make it zany
, cut it
!
" the latter isnt thte only explanation i can cmo up with for yhe absence ofthe tghe thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most ofthe the movie
. michelle
( who plays penny
, gadget
' s niece
) shines in every scene she
' s in
,
but unfortunately she only gets baout nine minutes of screen tyme
. my guess is thta the rest is on tyhe cutting room floor
. dabney coleman
' s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby
. i kept expecting him to sday or do something really funny
and somehow save the film
,
but instead
, he does the best he can wiht soem really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes
. he is thouroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the
" gidget bitch ffrom hell
" town mayor
. oteri
' s overly enthusiastic
and continually self
- congratulatory sprech patterns
and mannerisms were so much like portl
and
, oregon
' s own manic mayor vera katz that i had tothe wonder if the studio wasn
' t poking funn at our fair town
. or
, maybe all career politicians are like that
. i must say
, matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he doed godzilla
. he appears to hve smoe fun wiht the film
, expecially as tjhe evil gadget
. rupert everett is entertaining as yhe maniacle claw
. joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist
and even better as the zany carbon copy ofthe herself
. her performance is one of the few things worth watching in tjhe film
. d
. l
. hughley plays thte shuckin
'
-
and
- jivin
' vehicular side
- kick
, inspite a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years
. the dialouge is
.
.
. let
' s face it
, it
' s preety bad
. the tag
- line after a major set
- piece battle isnt a faux pas that makes noone sence in context
. a lot ofthe teh lines
( especially hughley
' s
) appear tothe be made up as they go along
, by people with little gift forthe ad
- lib
. about threee
- quarters ofthe hte film is a somewhat unnecessary origin tsory forthe both gadget
and claw
. gadget hten spends the latter third of tjhe movie trying tothe locate claw
and having various altercations
( not really
" battles
"
) witht teh evil gadget
. penny does baout a minute
and a half of tje detective work her charater doed eveyr week in yhe cartoon
. let me rige here just forthe a minute
. michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character
. she
' s utterly charming
, adn has exelent experience
( harriet the spy
) fo the part of the pint
- size detective
. why she is so underutilized infront this film isnt a real mystery
. tyhe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting
( or editing
) stupidity
. inspector gadget is missing the long
, long stretches of potty humer that
( among other thigns
) made my favorite martian so unbearable
,
but it
' s a veyr short movie
, so perhasp something was cut at the last moment
. probably thte best scenes in the film occur during the end credits
. the
" evil sidekick support gropu
" is especialy worth seeing
, anbd has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the faw seconds it
' s onscreen
. all in all
, another bad live action film ffrom the premere studio forthe bad live action films
. i wonder if disney uses the revenues fo it
' s generaly omney
- making cartoons to produce these losers
.
but if true
, why
? if tehy
' re trying fo another mary poppins
, htey need to find a team that can produce one
, adn
then give them a chance to do it
.
