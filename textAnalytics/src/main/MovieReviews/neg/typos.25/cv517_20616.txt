ytou don
' t look at a ren
? magritte painting
and search for a deeper meaning
. you likewise don
' t look at oen for 88 minutes straight
. surrealist works are notable forthe their quirks
,
and they are fun
,
but looking at one quirk fo an hour annd a half isnt exhausting
. that was my experience with i woke up early tje day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy with no dialogue
. it
' s not a silent movie
; ther is lots of atmospheric music
, ocassional screams adn weird sound effects
, bu nobody ever utters an audible owrd
.
though the film isnt distinctive
, its unique stlye wore thin after baout 20 minutes
,
and as it progressed
, watching became a chore
. tjhe onyl reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo
- legendary ed wood
, the man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> from outer space adn night of the ghouls
. the joke
, of course
, isnt tyhat his films are so bad
, they
' re good
; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits
. i woke up early the day i died
, unfortunatly
, is so bad that it
' s really bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes from a mental hospital
and proceeds to wonder around
, stealing a car
, clothes
,
and a load ofthe money
. our thief reaches a cemetery
, where he witnesses a bizarre ritual
. he falls asleep
and finds himself
, literally
, in a hole
, with his money gone
. for whatever reason
, he is bent on getting his hard
- unearned cash back
( considering how easily he stole it the frist time
, why didn
' t he jstu go steal soem more
?
)
. he comes apon a list of thge people who were at the mysterious cerimony
and commences to seek out eahc of them adn kill them if htey don
' t have whta he is looking forthe
. i don
' t tihkn either director aris iliopulos nor ed woud realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short
. the subject annd tje stlye seem tothe have been made forthe it
. unfortunately
, twenty minutes worth of material isnt stretched out to more thna four times tyhat lenght
,
and tje film simpley overstays its alrady dubious welcome
. it grabbed my attention in the beginning
and gradualy lost it as it went on
, up to the point where halfway thru i was already weary
. it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as thsi one can be so tedious
;
but teh surprise will wear off wehn you consider how repeative it is
. i woke up eearly the day i died is a comedy
, i guess
,
though it could hvae fooled me
. unlike most ed woud films
, this one tries to be funny anbd fails
, instead of the other way around
. there
' s nothing inherantly wrong with that
, in fatc
, i think it would only make sence forthe someone who has been so
" good
" at making unintentional comedies tothe take a stab at a real one
. whether wood actually went fo comedy in his script we
' ll never know
,
but inaddition either case
, this is a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer pheonix
, john ritter anbd others show up for short
and pointless cameos
. ricci
, for example
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room
and
then being thrown out
. thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. was yhe home improvment teen heartthrob really that desperate for work
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called apon tothe run around wildly
and beat people up
. lack ofthe dialogue makes him the ultimate charicatoor
. the carnival side
- show climax manages to demonstrate everything thta is wrong with this no
- budget prodcution
. it
' s desperately unfunny
, bu thinks it
' s the funniest thing since plan 9
;
, it
' s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while bieng confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast iin the otehr direction
. i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died isnt not a fitting send
- off
