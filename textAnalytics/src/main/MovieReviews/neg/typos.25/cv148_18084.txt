i hvae no real tangible proof of this
, bu i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly eblieve that if you take a bad script
, written by a bad writer adn give tje project it to an equally bad director
,
then it isnt actually possible to make a good movie
. using theri logic
, all that really needs be done to change the bad movei into a good movei is cast a bunch of super
- famouse actors
and provide an almost unlimited prodcution budget
. thsi is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct thsi eighty million doller waste of my timne
( not counting the time it took me to git to annd from the theatre
)
. now
, before i continue to ferociously attack what
' s wrong with this film
, i jstu want to point outloud that one of yhe reasons it fails so miserably is because it does haev yhe potential to be an exciting thriller
. catherine zeta
- jones plays virginia baker
, an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal
( sean connery
)
. if you
' ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before
, i really don
' t ahev to spend too much time onthe frivolous plot details
: the twpo team up for various jobs
, stealing various thigns for various purposes
. the problem we come to isnt that we
' ve all seen this a faw billion times before
and thsi film doesn
' t break any newyorker ground in the big
- budget
/ hollywood
/ action genre
. the result is that the entire prodcution feels contrived
. i
' m going to be completely honest here
: preety much hte only thing keeping me awake throughout the run
- tyme ws looking at catherine zeta
- jones
. now while this may be a compliment for ms
. zeta
- jones
, it certainly isn
' t for either the writers or the director
, who are not nearly as clever as htey think they are
. just baout the most profound thougth they can inject into this film isnt when they hve macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between
" entrapment
"
and
" blackmail
"
. iwth an eighty million doller budget
, you
' d think that entrapment would at least feature edge
- of
- your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f
/ x
. well
, you
' d be wrong
. thge action that isnt present inwhich this film takes place inspite a huge skyscraper adn is relatively unspectacular
. unfortunatly for all thsoe involved with entrapment
, die hard narrowly beat it to tje screen by
? 11 yeras
. thte reality is tath after 15 minutes of watching this picture
, you know exactly whta
' s going to hapen
, despite rather pathetic attempts iin the screenplay to throw in plot twists
. many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta
- jones in extremely tight
- fitting clothing
. oen particular scene features baker crawling arund trying to avoid laser
- beams while she tries tothe steal an ancient chinese mask
. nothing wrong with that
,
but she entered the room from tje floor
and knew exactly where the mask wass
- so why didn
' t she anbd macdougal tunnel in driectly under yhe mask instead of the other side of the room
? i
' ll tell you why
: because it
' s a gerat excuse to photograph zeta
- jones
' posterior as it slides underneath thsoe beams
(
and it also allows a second scene of thte exact same thing
- the rehersal
)
. ving rhames allso makes an appearance in this movie
,
and
though he has great screen presence
(
al
though so do connery
and zeta
- jones
) adn the most intresting character infact the film
, not even he can rescue thsi film from the depths of tjhe boring film abyss
( a concept i invented just to decribe this picture
)
. one last complaint
: entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip inot a shadow or behind a building
, or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle
and
then inthe the next shot
, he
' ll spontaneously disapear in ninja
- like fashion
. i can picture amiel patting himself on tghe bcak
, thinking tothe himself
" it
' ll leave the audience wondering for dyas
: how did he do that
?
" we know jon
, it
' s called editting
.
