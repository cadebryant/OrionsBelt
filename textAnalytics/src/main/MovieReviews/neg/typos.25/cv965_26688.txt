: blair witch 2 a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman certain things iin our lives are inevitable
. death
, sorrow
, love
, heartbreak
, pain
, joy
. we expect theese events
. we know they
' re going to happen anbd some
, we even look forward to
. it
' s part of the human condition
. we hvea also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society
. as we near the fall election
, sevral of them are hitting us in tghe face
. politicans exaggerate their own importance
. our side is always right
; theirs is always wrong
. in yhe end
, voters are usually forced tothe choose the lesser ofthe twpo whocares
. in hollywood the one indisputible inevitable isnt that if a film makes big money
, there will be a sequel
. even if tje originnal story doesn
' t merit one
. even if yhe first film is complet in itself
. even if succsess isnt a fluke
.
" the blair witch project
" was made with a budget of
$ 1
. 75 anbd exploded on the screen
, raking in huge profits
. the concept was brilliant
. the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that thte story might be rela
. the film itself wass even more convincing
. the movei
_ must
_ be au
thentic
. why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen
? the first film caught lightning in a bottle
. the sequal proves ytou cant
' t pour that old lightning into a new bottle
. yuo have to give this effort soem credit
. it would have beeen easy to have made thte same movie again with a newyorker gropu of kids
. it owudl have been easy
,
but of course
, it wouldn
' t have worked
. instead
" book of shadows
" acknowledges tjhe firt film as a movie
and concentrates on the hysteria following its realease
. it
' s a great scheme
and possibly the onyl entertaining way to do a sequel
. unfortunately it doesn
' t work either
. five kids spend the nigt in hte woods at the scene of the first film
. weird stuff happens
and tehy retreat to an old factory where one ofthe them lives
. even weirder stuff happens
. some people die
, there
' s blood
and knives
and none of the characters hvea a lick of common sense
. while supposedly doing serious research
, yhe group sets uv a circle of surveillance cameras in tje ruins of the old hous in the woods
and vows tothe stay alert all night awaiting a visitation
.
then they proceed to get totally trashed onthe drugs
and alcohol
and party down with very loud
, vrey obnoxious heavy metal music
. it
' s a bad plan
. the cast shows soem early promise
. a couple is doing research onthe a
" blair witch
" book
. teh tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficoinado
. a goth anazon princess adds a bit of commedic relief
. the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick
, the cute rock
and roll chick
and the cute disco chick
: teh cute wiccan chick
. the first film
' s unaccomplished actors cameback across as rela peple iin a rela situation because hours
and hours of video were shot during days in the woods
. this timne
, these unaccomplished actors jstu come across as unaccomplished actors
. there
' s not noe character you care about when they strat shouting for noone reason
. altough what passes for a plot starts outloud with a solid idea
, it
' s ruined by poor excecution
. the follow
- up to noe of thge most successful horror films ever is nothing more thna a bad slasher movie
. they
' re trapped in an ood big weird hous
. they stupidly separate inot various rooms
. there are strange noises
, they see scary apparitions
and people disappear
. ever see this movie
? seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better
. the film features mostly cheap tricks
and unnecessary gore
. fo a storyline filled with surprises
, it
' s oddly predicable
.
" teh blair witch project
" wass a rare triumph ofthe style over substance
.
" the book of shadows
" is a triumph ofthe tedium over promise
.
