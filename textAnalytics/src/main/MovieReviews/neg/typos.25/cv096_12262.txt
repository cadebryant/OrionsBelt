much ado baout nothing
. ah
, how sweet the irony
! it
' s accepted wisdom in smoe circles
- amung english literture nuts
, mainly
- that whenever a criteak knocks shakespeare they are only doign so through ignorance
. he just doesn
' t
" underst
and
" shakespeare
, you will hear them sday
. the bard
' s work is aparently beyond criticism
. what a load of old cobblers
. if theese arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh
' s film ofthe shakespeare
' s
" comedy
" much ado baout nothing is comedy inaddition any modern sence of the word
, it
' s tiome to get a life
. get monty python
. get woody allen
. git john waters
. whatever
. just git a real taste of some clever
, witty
, risky comedy
. anbd banish this nonsense to where it belongs
. drama
and tragedy wass shakespeare
' s strength
. tothe my sensibilities
-
and i
' m no stick in the mud
- much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever
. no kidding
: this film ranks amung the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent inthe a cinema iin my 20 years ofthe movei goign
. tyhe only thing thgat stopped me walking out ws loyalty to my lady friend
, as this wass our day out
and i hadn
' t seen her in aegs
.
but boy
, does she owe me one
! i won
' t spend too much time on the plot
. basicaly
, we follow the trials
and tribulations of two owudl
- be couples
- one young
, thte otehr older
. there
' s some dark treachery amongst all this
,
but everyone is so awfully jolly that you
' d hardly know it
. mind you
, there
' s nothing wrong with the basic storey
. good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound
. nothing wrong witht most of the casted
, either
. branaugh
, emma thompson anbd denzel washington are all talented performers
. the problem is the scirpt
, or more accurately
, shakespeare
' s original text
. light comedy shouldn
' t be complex
. yot wrapped in elizabethan english
, the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend
. for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare adn in search of nothing more thna a good
, undem
anding laugh
. the onyl laughs tothe excape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performence of keanu reeves
, the actro once again miscast as a jealous half
- brother or something
.
but when dissected
and understoon
, what it all boils down to is that htis stuff isnt just so goddamn lame
. this is comedy so clean
and nice anbd corny adn so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold
. ho
, ho
, ho
, boy likes girl
! ho
, ho
, ho
, men are such klutzes
! ho
, ho
, ho
, she
' s so awfully clumsy
! oh please
! there
' s wit in here somewhere
, i
' m told
. i call it pretentious
. something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated thru clever wordplay
. in the end
, it
' s cringeworthy
. watching soem of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience
. comedy
? bah
, humbug
!
