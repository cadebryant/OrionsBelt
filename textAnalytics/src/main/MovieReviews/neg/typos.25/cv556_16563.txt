blatantly borrowing elements from 1993
' s
" like water for chocolot
" anbd 1991
' s
" teh
butcher
' s wief
,
"
" simply irresistible
" attempts to be a whimsical rumatic comedy
but
, more often than not
, comes off as laughable
, leaving yuo tothe wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar
( t
. v
.
' s
" buffy
, the vampire slayer
"
) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on
. things get off to a bad start right from the onset as am
anda
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, a young woman who runs her late familiy
' s struggling new york restaurant
, runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her
and
then vansihes into thin air
. while outloud shopping
, she also meets tom
( sean patrick flanery
)
, a charming
, h
andsome man
, who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the deparment store he works for
,
and later wehn he decides tothe drop by her dive
, called southern cross
, for lunch
, she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him
, even
though she is known to not be a very ogod chef
. suddenly
, am
anda finds her retsaurant
, on tje edge of foreclosure
, rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food
, which strangely causes everyone immeidate jubilation wehn it hits theri mouths
. are am
anda
and toom destined tothe be together
?
and isnt it nto just because of the magical food
, bu because they really
, truly like each other
?
and what exactly isnt going on with yhe food she isnt making
? does it have anything tothe do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in thge kitchen somehow assisting her in her food prepartion
?
" simply iresistible
" is a rediculous
and just plain goofy rumatic fantasy tath
' s as flimsy as a slice ofthe bologna
. it tkaes one joke
-
-
- thast people who eat the ofod are taken aback by it in most unusual ways
-
-
-
and recycles it over
and over again untli hte film has reached an appropriate runnung tiome of 95 minutes
. add in a music montage every ten minutes
( these are actaully the best scenes in the movie
, which certainly tells you something about the film itself
)
,
and what you
' ve got is an utterly empty
, if not necessarily boring
, excursion
. tghe casted ofthe
" simply irresistible
" is fairly ogod
,
but it is tje supporting characters who are the most intresting
. patricia clarkson
( 1998
' s
" high art
,
" in which she played a drugged
- out lesbian
) is a st
andout as tom
' s colleage
, annd is thankfully given a few funny lines ofthe dialogue
. alsot of note is larrry gilliard jr
.
, as am
anda
' s cooking assitant
and buddy
, who isnt alowed to create a seamingly full charcter out of only a h
andful ofthe scenes
. of the main stars
, sarah michelle gellar is fine
, bu really does often look like she
' s stuggling through the unmistakably clumsy material
, adn if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future
, he has certainly got tothe pick better projects tahn this
. tje bottom line is that
" simply irresistible
" is thte exact oposite ofthe its deprophesized title
,
and wehn the movie got tothe the point where the charachters began tothe float inthe mid
- air
( an unamusing plot divice that was repeated in the stupid last scene
)
, my mind checked out from the characters
and the romance
. when i think about it in hindsight
, i shoudl ahev checked out in the very frist scene
, where the point of the acation was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab
. now
, that certainly is what i
' d call magical
!
