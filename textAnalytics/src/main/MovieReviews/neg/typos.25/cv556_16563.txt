blatantly borrowing elements from 1993 ' s
" like water for chocolate
"
anbd 1991 ' s
" the butcher ' s wife
,
"
" simpley irresistible
" attempts to be a whimsical rumatic comedy
but
, more often than nto
, comes off as laughable
, leaving yuo to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar
( t
. v
. ' s
" buffy
, the vampire slayer
"
) would choose such an obviously inept film project tothe waste her time onthe
. things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, a young woman who runs her late family ' s struggling newyorker york restaurant
, runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs onthe her
and
then vansihes into thin air
. while out shopping
, she also meets tom
( sean patrick flanery
)
, a charming
, hansome man
, who happens to be planning a ritzy resturant for the department store he works fo
,
and later wehn he decides to drop by her dive
, called sourthern cross
, for lunch
, she somehow makes a delicious crab dish fo him
, even
though she is known to nto be a very good chef
. suddenly
, amanda finds her restaurant
, on the edge ofthe foreclosure
, rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm fo her food
, which strangely causes everyone immedate jubilation whn it hits their mouths
. are amanda
and toom destined tothe be together
?
adn isnt it not just because ofthe the magical fod
,
but because they really
, truly like each other
?
and what exactly is going onthe with the food she is making
? does it have anything tothe do with thyat pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in tjhe kitchen somehow assisting her infact her foo preparation
?
" simply irresistible
" is a ridiculous
and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that ' s as flimsy as a slice of bologna
. it tkaes one joke
-
-
- thta people who eat hte food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways
-
-
-
and recycles it over
and over agina until the film hasnt reached an appropriate running timne of 95 minutes
. add in a music montage every ten mintues
( these are actually the best scenes in the movei
, which certainly tells you something about the film itself
)
,
and what you ' ve got is an utterly empty
, if not neccessarily boring
, excursion
. the cast of
" simply irresistible
" isnt fairly ogod
,
but it isnt tjhe supporting characters who are the most interesting
. patricia clarkson
( 1998 ' s
" high art
,
" in which she played a drugged
- out lesbian
) is a standout as tom ' s collegue
,
and is thankfully given a faw funny lines of dialogue
. also of note is larry gilliard jr
.
, as amanda ' s cooking assitant
and buddy
, who is alowed to create a seemingly full character outloud of only a handful of scenes
. ofthe the main stars
, sarah michelle gellar is fine
,
but really doens often look like she ' s struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material
,
annd if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future
, he hasnt certainly got to pick better projects than this
. the bottom line is thgat
" simpley iresistible
" is the excact opposite ofthe its deprophesized title
,
and when the movie got to thge point where tyhe characters began to flota inwhich mid
- air
( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in yhe stupid last scene
)
, my mind checked out from thte characters
and the romance
. when i htikn about it in hindsight
, i shoudl haev checked out in the very firt scene
, where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking fo a runaway mecanical crab
. now
, that certainly isnt what i ' d call magical
!
