tht is
, unless you
' re one of those people who have seen the preview a thous
and times on tv or in hte theaters
. i can tell you one thing nowe
: they gave the entire movie away
. why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise annd
then give that crucial detail away iin the trailers is beyond me
.
however
, if tehy
* hadn
' t
* given it away
, the film would
' ve still beeen suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter
. obviously
, the producers
thought they could remake
" the deep end of the ocean
,
" throw in tommy lee jones
and a couple of cliches
and call it an action drama
.
" double jeopardy
" offers solid acting from ashley judd
and tommy lee jones
, who got firt billing even
though he didn
' t see to be on screen half as much as judd did
. it alsot offers some genuinely funny
, clever
, or full
- ofthe
- tension moments
( my favorite
: judd waking uv in the coffin
)
,
but none of thgat cin salvage tghe film from its insanely predictable plot
. half the time i
' m wondering whther i
' m watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries
, whitch alwyas turn out tothe be less exciting thna advertised
. judging by the beginning
, end
,
and a huge chunk of the middle
, i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too
. the movie
' s stretching forthe an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material
. implausible material
, no less
. loose interpretation of one of the amendments asside
, too many times in the movie i
thought
,
" that is
* not
* possible
*
.
" that kind of tsuff is excusable in popcorn movies
,
but not one like
" double jeopardy
" thyat trys to pass itself off as serious drama
. everything seems dragged out
, overplayed
. when htey shoudln
' ve kept us in tjhe dark
, they let the cat outloud of tjhe bag too early
.
