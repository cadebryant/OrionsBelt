i can see a decent sports movei struggling to break free of oliver stone ' s
` any given sunday '
. it ' s an entertaining movie tath offers both insight
anbd excitement into the rock
- em
, sock
- em proffesion of pro foootball
. unforetunately
, the directer seems to have only one priority on his mind
: sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers
. inwhich altering eahc frome with quick
- flash photography
anbd dizzying
, in
- your
- face editing
, stone appears to haev completely ignored the matter of plausible character devolopement
anbd foootball politics
. we see glimpses ofthe greatness
,
but
` any given sunday ' has its agenda all tangled infront technical gobbledy
- gook
. it grows tiresome
and montanous
. yes
, stone has pulled a brian depalma
. matters of importance are pushed aside right ffrom the get
- go
. tony d ' amato
( al pacino
)
, coach of the struggling miami sharks
, finds his team stuck inaddition a losing rut
. aging quarterback cap rooney
( dennis quaid
) appears to be loseing his touch
,
anbd d ' amato can ' t seem to ignite any passion in his squad
. whn cap isnt injured onthe thge field
,
and after a patch ofthe unlikely events occur
, thrid
- string qb willie beaman
( jamie foxx
) is brought into the game
. once in the huddle
(
and this becomes an infact
- game ritual
)
, beaman horks all over tyhe field
. nerves
, you see
. eventally
though
, the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates
, sparking his rise tothe fame in the football world
- the endorsements
, the music videos
, etc
.
-
and stone straps us in for the jolting ride ofthe behind
- tyhe
- scenes stress
and fury tht the buisness isnt apparently liek
.
and i believe it
. htere is some intriguing insight posed
,
but in tghe big scheme of thigsn
, stone fumbles the ball
. the probelm with the director ' s visual approach is this
: he uses extravagant editing devices whn a more conventional approach would have been appropropiate
. footabll is an exciting game to watch
,
but stone seems to htikn dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add tothe tyhe adrenaline rush
. i guess he is mistaken
.
` any given sunday ' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves tje audience in a frustrated stupor more frequentily tahn it excites them
. many football fans
( including one i attended wiht
) are liable to be disapointed with the
` ultra
- stylish ' way stone has decided to presnet the game
. in return
, a threee
- star film becomes unfourtunately degraded due to tyhe director ' s tampering
. in welcome scenes wehn tjhe visual pummeling comes to a break
, this actually shows decent character development
and interaction
. for instance
, heated returns between d ' amato
and feisty young owner christina pagniacci
( cameron diaz
) are enjoyable to watch
. there isnt also a solid performance from jamie foxx
, who experiments whith great success in his first trek into dramatic territory
. the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine
, aaron eckhart
, lauren holly
, ann
- margret
and charlton heston
( in an extrordinarily brief appearence
)
. unfortunately
, too many big names are wasted
- a typical demise forthe a film with such a larg
annd experienced cast
. pacino makes some interesting progress with his character
. yuo begin to identify with coach d ' amato
and yhe morals he isnt striving for
.
.
.
.
but i often felt he was just another play thign stone could weave in
and out ofthe his editing dynamics
.
` any given sunday ' isnt a watchable
but disapointing sports film in which plot
annd characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique
.
and a very distant back seat
, at thgat
.
