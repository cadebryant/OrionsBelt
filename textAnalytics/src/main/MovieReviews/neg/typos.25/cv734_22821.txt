i cin see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone
' s
` any given sunday
'
. it
' s an entertaining movie that offers both insight
and excitement into the rock
- em
, sock
- em proffesion of pro footblal
. unfortunatly
, the directer seems to haev only one priority onthe his mind
: sprucing up yhe film wih an assortment ofthe fancy camera manouvers
. in altering each frome wiht quick
- flash photography
and dizzying
, inaddition
- your
- face editting
, stone appears to have completly ignored teh matter ofthe plausible character devolopement
and foobtall politics
. we see glimpses ofthe greatness
, bu
` any given sunday
' hasnt its agenda all tangled inthe technical gobbledy
- gook
. it grows tiresome
and montanous
. yes
, stone hasnt pulled a brian depalma
. matters of importance are pushed aside right fomr the get
- go
. tony d
' amato
( al pacino
)
, coach ofthe the struggling miami sharks
, finds his team stuck in a losing rut
. agin quarterback cap rooney
( dennis quaid
) appears to be losing his touch
,
and d
' amato can
' t seem tothe ignite any passion in his squad
. when cap isnt injured on the field
,
and after a patch of unlikey events occur
, third
- string qb willie beaman
( jamie foxx
) is brought into the game
. once inspite the huddle
(
and this becomes an in
- gmae ritual
)
, beaman horks all over teh field
. nerves
, you see
. eventially
though
, the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates
, sparking his rise to fame infact yhe football world
- the endorsements
, the music videos
, etc
.
-
and stone straps us in for teh jolting ride of behind
- the
- scenes stress anbd fury taht the business is apparantly liuke
. adn i believe it
. there isnt some intriguing insight posed
,
but in tyhe big scheme of things
, stone fumbles tyhe ball
. the problem with the director
' s visual approach is this
: he uses extravagant editting devices when a more conventional approach owudl have been appropriate
. football is an exciting game tothe watch
, bu stone seems tothe think dizzying the audience wtih an assault on teh senses will only add to tghe adrenaline rush
. i guess he is mistaken
.
` any given sunday
' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them
. many football fans
( including one i attended wtih
) are liable to be disapointed with the
` ultra
- stylish
' way stone has decided to prseent the gmae
. iin return
, a three
- star film becomes unfortunatley degraded due to the director
' s tampering
. in welcome scenes wehn tghe visual pummeling comes to a break
, this actally shows decent charcter development
and interaction
. for instance
, heated returns between d
' amato annd fiesty young owner christina pagniacci
( cameron diaz
) are enjoyable to watch
. there isnt also a solid peformance from jamie foxx
, who experiments with great success in his first trek inot dramatic territory
. the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine
, aaron eckhart
, lauren holly
, ann
- margret anbd charlton heston
( in an extrordinarily breif appearance
)
. unfortunatley
, too many big names are wasted
- a typical demise fo a film with such a large
and experianced casted
. pacino mkaes some interesting progress with his character
. you begin to identify with coach d
' amato
and the morals he isnt striving forthe
.
.
.
.
but i oftenly felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in
and out of his editting dynamics
.
` any given sunday
' isnt a watchable
but disapointing sports film in which plot
and characters tkae a bakc seat tothe excessive filmmaking technique
.
and a vyre distant bcak seat
, at that
.
