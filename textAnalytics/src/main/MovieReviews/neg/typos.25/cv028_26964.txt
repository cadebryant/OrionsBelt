a follow
- up tothe disney ' s live
- acation
" 101 dalmatians
" that ' s better
, mroe intertaining than the first
? just as unlikely
. with
" 102 dalmatians
,
" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going tothe the dogs
, moreso is definetly
* not
* the merrier
. 1996 ' s
" 101 dalmatians
" certainly wasn ' t the greatest movei
- gogin experience of all tiem
,
but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous
, larger
- than
- life peformance
. inthe adition
, we had two amiable leads in tghe form of jeff daniels
and joely richardson
,
and lots
and lots of adorable spotted puppies
. tihs tiome around htere seem to be fewer puppies on the screen
,
and close ' s facial
anbd fysical gyrations are starting tothe feel as old as the 53
- year
- old actress under that startling black
and white wig of hers
.
but that ' s only half the probelm with kevin lima ' s laborious film
. wqat makes
" 102 dalmatians
" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humer
( here almost single
- handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he ' s a dog
, voiced by eric idle
)
, its rabid plotlessness
( cruella goes aftter puppies again
; winds up inaddition goo agina
)
and most of all
, the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic
" heroes
" of the peice
, a welshman named ioan gruffudd
and tyhe blander
- tahn
- bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo
?
. gruffudd isnt cute
and harmless
, perhaps
,
but evans can ' t even aspire to that
. the dogs upstage them both
, of course
,
bu in hte case of evans
, even close ' s split ends are more animated
. bad acting
,
however
, seems to be a requirement for thsi sequel
, since g
? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro ' s in
" men of honor
.
" jean pierre le pelt isnt a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant forthe fine furs
and depardieu ' s over
- thte
- top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail
,
annd wail for wail
. france ' s most popular export besides brie hasnt long since turned into a caricature of himself
,
and inthe
" 102 dalmatians
" the producers milk that realization for all it ' s worth
-
- le pelt likes tothe refer tothe the furry littel critters as
" poopies
,
" par example
(
and ad nauseum
)
. thge finesses of the script
( atributed to four screenwriters no less
,
annd far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up
) are quickly dispensed wiht
, since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben
(
?
)
. that done
, it ' s bakc to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off
- limits sables
anbd minks
and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake ofthe a hooded designer gown
. the dogs are pretty cute
-
- try making a puppy look otherwise
-
-
but that ' s pretty much all they are
. htere ' s allways the feeling that ther ' s a trainer off in the wings
, coaxing the dogs tothe opne doors
, or pick up their fod bowls in unison
, or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder
. savvy holiday goers should skip
" 102 dalmatians
"
and pop the original 1961 animated clasic into
* their
* vcrs instead
. it ' s one dalmation less
,
but 101
% moreso satisfying
.
