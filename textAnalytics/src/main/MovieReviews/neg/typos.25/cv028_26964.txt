" 101 dalmatians
" that
' s better
, mroe entertaining than the first
? just as unlikey
. with
" 102 dalmatians
,
" the disney studios have proven that wehn it comes to going to tghe dogs
, mroe is definitely
* not
* the merrier
. 1996
' s
" 101 dalmatians
" certainly wasn
' t the greatest movie
- going experience ofthe all time
,
but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous
, larger
- than
- life performence
. in addition
, we hadnt two amiable leads inspite the form of jeff daniels adn joely richardson
, adn lots
and lots of adorable spotted puppies
. this time arround there seem to be fewer puppies on tghe screen
, adn close
' s facial annd physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53
- year
- ood actress under that startling balck
and white wig of hers
.
but thgat
' s only half the problem with kevin lima
' s laborious film
. waht makes
" 102 dalmatians
" such a collosal bore isnt its embarrassing attemts at humor
( here almost single
- h
andedly foisted onthe a wisecracking macaw who thinks he
' s a dog
, voiced by eric idle
)
, its rabid plotlessness
( cruella goes after puppies again
; winds up in goo agian
)
and most ofthe all
, the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic
" heroes
" of tje piece
, a welshman named ioan gruffudd annd the bl
ander
- than
- bl
and alice evans as a parole officer named chlo
?
. gruffudd isnt cute anbd harmless
, perhaps
,
but evans can
' t even aspire to thast
. the dogs upstage them both
, ofthe course
,
but in the case ofthe evans
, even close
' s splitted ends are more animated
. bad acting
,
however
, seems to be a requirement fo this sequel
, since g
? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro
' s infact
" men of honor
.
" jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant fo fine furs
and depardieu
' s over
- teh
- top antics mimic those ofthe the campy close flail forthe flail
,
and wail for wail
. france
' s most populare export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of hismelf
,
and inthe
" 102 dalmatians
" the producers milk thyat relization for all it
' s worth
-
- le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as
" poopies
,
" par example
(
and ad nauseum
)
. the finesses of tjhe script
( attri
butred to four screenwriters no less
,
and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed uv
) are quickly dispensed iwth
, since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in tghe slammer is the tolling of big ben
(
?
)
. tht done
, it
' s back to tjhe mension to roll around infront her heretofore off
- limits sables
and minks adn a plan to skin thsoe little dahlings forthe the sake of a hooded designer gown
. tjhe dogs are pretty cute
-
- try making a puppy look otherwise
-
-
but that
' s preety much all htey are
. there
' s always the feeling taht there
' s a trainer off in the wings
, coaxing tyhe dogs to open doors
, or pick up theri food bowls in unison
, or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder
. savvy holiay goers should skip
" 102 dalmatians
"
and pop the orginial 1961 animated classic into
* their
* vcrs instade
. it
' s oen dalmatian less
,
but 101
% more satisfying
.
