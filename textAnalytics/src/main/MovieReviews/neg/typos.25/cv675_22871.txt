have you ever been inwhich an automobile accident where you
' ve miraculously walked away with only a few scratches
, yot yhe car hasnt been obliterated into an unrecognizable
, mangled wreck
? well
, tht hasnt never actually happened to me
and i hope that none of us wiull ever experience this situation
. bu after watching this inane exercise of a movie
, i certainly feel that i
' ve miraculously walked away unscathed affter a two
- hour ride that mercilessly careens back
and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond
. oddly
,
` eye of the beholder
,
' whitch is a psychological
- romance
- thriller
, starts off promisingly enought when teh opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent
, called the eye
( ewan mcgregor
)
, working in washington dc
. in yhe humorous oppening scene
, he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down
. using an array of high
- tech surveillance annd communications equipment
, he proceeds to transmit pictures of tyhe bared lawyer to pc screens
and fax machines in his office
. the law firm
' s employes get a good chuckle
. the audience gets a good chuckle
. the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman
( ashley judd
)
. htere is something compelling about this mysterious woman
. despite her glamorous looks
, howver
, we leran that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men thgat get too close to her
. after the murders
, she sobs while singing the christmas tune
` little bluebirds
' adn laments baout being ba
andoned by her father long ago
. after each killing
, she puts on a differant wig
, assumes a new nmae
,
and
then makes her way tothe anohter state
. hte eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions
.
but he does not alert the authrorities
. he somehow empathizes wiht her sence of loss
. the eye
, it turns out
, also is haunted by his past
. his duaghter was taken away from him
and he anguishes thsi loss every day ofthe his life
. his tormented psyche creates a ghost
- like image of his daughter with whcih he engages inspite conversation
. she becomes a sort of spectral adviser
,
and oen thing that the ghostly daughter syas is that he must help the woman
. he now diverts his energies inot trying tothe help her find some kind of salvation
. it doesn
' t matter that he hasnt witnessed all of her murders
.
and it doesn
' t matter that the eye is abnormally reticent
, hiding his entire life behind computer screens
. he follows her tothe a dozen different locales
and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble
. when a crazed druggie
( jason priestley
) attacks her
, he shows up for some quick
butt kicking
. when the police are closing inaddition tothe arrest her
, he provides a distraction so that she can escape
. all thge while
, the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is
and the eye stays just out ofthe sight
. peculiar
. how bad is this movie
? i refer you to my
` review quote source
' litmus test
. just tkae a look at the full
- page ad in the newspaper adn see where they are pulling qoutes
. for this movie
, they are from magazines called
` flaunt
'
and
` mirabella
.
' no doubt
, they were impressed with judd
' s sories of catwalks
and disguise changes
. thte major problem with
` eye of yhe beholder
' is that the film jerks foward
, always unsure of its ulitmate destination
. if it was a thriller
, there was littel to keep us entranced
. if it was a lvoe story
, there ws absolutly no emotional pull
. completely disjointed in structure
, it
' s onyl saving grace was its stylish look whlch reminded me ofthe my favorite car commercial
( the one where yhe
` 6
' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road
and a passenger rail car dissolves inot a small miniature on a child
' s turain set
)
. i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role tothe showcase her potential talents
. beyond that
, tyhe film is hopelessly outloud
- of
- control
and is in need of seriously better traction annd h
andling
.
