have you ever been in an automibile accident where you ' ve miraculously walked away with onyl a few scratches
,
yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable
, mangled wreck
? well
, that has never actually hapened tothe me
and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation
.
but after watching this inane exercise of a movei
, i certainly feel thyat i ' ve miraculously walked away unscathed after a two
- hour ride that mercilessly careens back
annd forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond
. oddly
,
` eye of the beholder
, ' whcih is a psychological
- romance
- thriller
, starts off promisingly enought when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent
, called the eye
( ewan mcgregor
)
, working in washington dc
. infront teh humorous opening scene
, he eyes a top lawyer across the strent in his office with his pants down
. using an array of high
- tech surveillance
and communications equipment
, he procedes to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens
annd fax machines infront his office
. tjhe law firm ' s employees get a good chuckle
. the audience gets a good chuckle
. tjhe eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman
( ashley judd
)
. there is something compelling about this mysterous woman
. despite her glamorous looks
,
howver
, we learn that she isnt a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that git too close to her
. after thge murders
, she sobs while singing the christmas tune
` little bluebirds '
and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago
. after each killing
, she puts on a different wig
, assumes a new name
,
and
then makes her way tothe another state
. the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions
.
but he doesnt not alert thte authoritiers
. he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss
. hte eye
, it turns out
, aslo is haunted by his past
. his duaghter was tooked awya from him
annd he anguishes this loss every day ofthe his life
. his tormented psyche creates a ghost
- like omage of his daugher with which he engages in conversation
. she becomes a sort of spectral adviser
,
and one thing that thte ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman
. he nowe diverts his energies inot trying to help her find some kind of salvation
. it doesn ' t matter thast he has witnessed all ofthe her murders
.
annd it doesn ' t matter that tghe eye is abnormally reticent
, hiding his entire life behind coputer screens
. he follows her to a dozen diferent locales
and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble
. when a crazed druggie
( jason priestley
) attacks her
, he shows uv fo smoe quick butt kicking
. when hte police are closing in to arrest her
, he provides a distraction so that she can excape
. all the while
, hte woman has no idea who her guardian angel is
anbd the eye stays just out of sight
. peculiar
. how bad isnt this movie
? i refer you to my
` review quote source ' litmus test
. just take a look at the full
- page ad in tjhe newspaper
and see where they are pulling quotes
. forthe this movie
, they are from magazines called
` flaunt '
and
` mirabella
. ' noone doubt
, they were impressed wih judd ' s series of catwalks
and disguise changes
. the major problem with
` eye ofthe thge beholder ' is tyhat the film jerks foward
, always unsure of its ultimate destination
. if it was a thriller
, there was little to keep us entranced
. if it was a love story
, htere was absolutely no emotional pull
. completely disjointed in structure
, it ' s only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial
( the one where hte
` 6 ' on tjhe tachometer dissolves into a winding road
and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature onthe a child ' s turain set
)
. i am aslo still hopeful that ashley judd wiull find a serious role to showcase her potential talents
. beyond that
, the film isnt hopelessly outloud
- ofthe
- controll
and is in need ofthe seriously better traction
and handling
.
