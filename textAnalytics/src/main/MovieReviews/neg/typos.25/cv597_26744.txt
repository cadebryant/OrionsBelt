for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo
( the killer
, hard boiled
, face off
) appears to have made an exciting
, elevant
, charming spy thriller
, kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american
( read
: unsophisticated
) hero omre willing to drop kick villains than out fox them
. sadly
, as the picture progresses
, the fianl product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up
, twpo
- hour long episode ofthe magyuver
.
and not a particularly good oney at that
. what went wrong
? mi2 begins flashily enough
, that initial flash leading us to believe thta it
' ll soon give way to something ofthe a plot
, bu it onyl gives way tothe more flash
,
then digresses futher inot a presumably unintentional parody of itself wih much slo mo posturing anbd countless acation set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way ofthe tom cruise
' s firing gun just so htey can die realy cool
. early on
, during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt
( tom cruise
) anbd nyah nordoff
- hall
( th
andie newton
)
, woo works some of his trademark magic
. in one hypnotic
,
though completely inexplicable sequence
, the director slows the action down tothe a languid semi
- stall as cruise
and his stunning opponant stare into one
and other
' s eyes with come hither sexuality
?
?
? just as their respective cars smash
and spin in accordance
, comming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff
. prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain
, sans scafolding
, thne leaping from oen jagged rock formation to another
. why
? i haven
' t the foggiest
. i dout even john woo could provide you with a logical reply
. with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine
, the one tyhat jettisons logic for gravity defying effects
and story for more gravity defying effects
. it
' s possible tyhat these
" spies
" could be adrenaline junkies climbing montains
and crashing into eahc otehr as means to get off
,
though of course thsi is never explored
. yhe scenes i
' ve discribed are really only included to titillate
, not to give any insight into character
. god forbid
. woo certainly konws how tothe amke each set piece energetic
,
but they remain individule set pieces never connecting to form anything more thna splices of beer commercial
- like visuals
. still inspite terms of crackerjack eye c
andy
, the opening has much to cherish
. cruise annd newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices
( the graeful slow mo artistry ofthe synchronized movment juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of twpo attractive individuals discovering how attractive tjhe other isnt
)
. betwen the frantic dancing
, woo trains his camera on cruise
and newton as they amke with soem sensuous eye contact
. the scene is a littel over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way
,
yet it has style
and something of soul
,
and woo casts a bited of a spell onthe us
. sure it
' s all smoke
and mirrors
,
but we cin see that there happens tothe be a talented maestro behind this particular product
. th
andie
and cruise later meet inspite a bathtub in a scene that
' s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez
\ george cloony trunk meeting in outloud of sight
. they flirt
and excange obvious duble entendres
. newton bats her eyes flirtatiously
. cruise grins a littel too slyly
. the cruise character
, ethan hunt
, hasnt been drastically altered usance yhe first film
. here cruise plays him more as a hip
, sexual dynamo thna the square jawed robot he impersonated inwhich part 1
. he
' s cool anbd dashing
, which is precisely the kind of role we whant to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut
( which might just be the longest epiode of red show diaries ever committed to film
)
,
and blustered his way through magnolia
( qtuie possably the most overrated performance ofthe the 90
' s
)
. sadly as teh film progresses we see less of cruise
' s initial
" i
' m tyhe man
!
" charm
and moreso slo
- mo close
- ups of his preening mug
. mi2 falls apart onthe nearly every levle during its repetitious third act
, which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won
' t stpo
. yhe wohle hting commences with an utterly generic gun battle
( tje first gun fight infact the film
)
, whitch really should be unheard ofthe in a john woo film
,
but alas this particular battle sould
' ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi
( of course excepting teh
" symbolic
" pigeons who seem to find their way into eveyr john woo picture
)
. we
' ve all seen guys slide accross the floor in slo mo hwile firing a gun in each h
and
. it isn
' t done any differently here
. the action is pure hard target
\ broken arrow theatrics wiht nothing tothe propel it
but thge appaernt need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind
. he
' s cool for sure
but he
' s made tothe be as empty as tje movei
. the actor isn
' t used so much fo his boyish appeal as fo his chiseled looks
; he smiles narcissistically into thge camera at literally any moent
, be it during a gunfight
, before one or after one
. when he
' s not beaming away
, he
' s staring inot tghe lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell
, bu woo
' s editing seriously undermines tghe affort
. he fetishizes cruise
' s angular face with such glee thta it turns into a naked gun style spoof
. i half expected cruise tothe peel off his facemask
and reveal that he
' s relaly austin powers
. in a classic woo action moment
, ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frome like a pin
- up boy angel ofthe death
. the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns inot a motorcycle attack in whic bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like smoe kind ofthe mass suicide ritual
( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise
, basicaly inviting our hansome hero to shoot him in mid air whic he doens
)
. the lead bad guy
( played by the appropriately british dougray scott
)
and cruise face off inspite a mentally deficient game of chicken
?
?
? on motorcycles
.
though instead of jumping off to thge side at thte last moment
, tje twpo grown men leap directly into the otehr giving each otehr a mid air bear hug
, only to fly about a hundred feet
( still inthe bear hug position
)
, l
and on a beach below
and begin a mano
- e
- mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a
" so you
thought i was dead
.
.
.
"
. not to worry
, cruise takes care of the probelm without even breaking a sweat
. what a hero
! you may hve noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2
' s plot
. my reasoning is simple
: i
' m nto sure of any good it would do
. the film itself hasnt absolutely no concern with story
, only whith hurtling forth to tje next
" spacial
" effect
. i wasn
' t kidding when i told a friend ofthe mine that mi2 has less plot than thge averege aerosmith video
. nobody will go to this forthe the plot
, annd if they do tehy
' ll surely regret it
. as summer movies evolve
( or devolve
) character
and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing
. in mi
, hte plot seemed tothe be built around brian de palma
' s
( that film
' s directer
) stylistic flourishes
, while inspite mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo
' s non
- stop masturbatory p
andemonium
. it
' s irrelevant in every sense
, as isnt character
. all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke adn mirrors
.
