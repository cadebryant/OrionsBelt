recently oney niht a young director named baz luhrmann couldn
' t sleep
. he tumbled out of bed
and moved over to the television where he watched mtv forthe an hour
.
then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled foo
.
then he tookover down a volumne of shakespeare
' s work
and read it cover to cover
- never really paying attension to the words or plot
. adn
then
, as a climax
, he took out his video camera
and pressed the
" on
"
button
. the result
? william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
- the worst film ever made
and a complet failure
.
though
, tothe be fair
, an interesting complete failure
. the idae at the film
' s core is to mkae shakespeare appealing tothe yhe crowds
. this isnt done by moving the camera around at a repid rate so tht we cxan
' t see what is going on
.
and filming the dialogue in voice over
.
and shooting leonardo dicaprio liuke a calvin klein model
. anbd makeing the frame go still while flashing tjhe character
' s nmae at tje bottom
. adn filming long tedeous action sequences inthe slow motion
. i mean
, man
, this isnt the 90s
, dude
.
however i
' ve seen terrable films that are fun to watch
.
( examples are batman
and robin
and hte isl
and ofthe doctor moreau
.
) that rule doesn
' t apply here
. thsi is a film that takes itself seriously
. that is it
' s major fault
. anohter problem was pointed outloud by my friend
, alex
( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout
.
)
; the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral
and didn
' t take sides
. here it
' s clera that we are suppoed tothe side with romeo
.
( jstu look at hte way they film him
.
) from tje begining he
' s our hero
and tihs doesn
' t wokr
.
and dicaprio
' s awful performance doesn
' t help
. luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us
. the result is a mess
. you can feel him striving to be something he isn
' t
. he tries tothe pull of a mix in whitch drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles
. he trys very hard
. key word
: tries
.
" oh look
, he
' s filming above water action from below
. pretty
. what does it represent
?
" why do people dont ugly things
? i scrambled awya from my tv set feeling gilty as if i could never read the play again
and keep a straight face
.
