capsule
: a ham
- h
anded
and over
/ underwritten morality play masquerading as enteratinment
, so muddled it doesn
' t even know whta it
' s realy advocating
, if anything
. a time to kill has beeen hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations
,
and it
' s eazy to see why
: it presents a strong
, almost rancorously so
, story
; it is full of good actors
( samuel l
. jackson
, matthew mcconaughey
, s
andra bullock
, kevin spacey
, charles dutton
)
;
and it
' s ostensibly about some important social issue that we
' re all tangling wtih
. it is not
,
however
, a good movie
,
and all of the reasons i
' ve listed above have something tothe do withthe why
. right from the beginning
, the movie is dead
- setted on stacking its deck as thoroughly
and unrepentantly as possible
. a pair of redneck whites
, boozed
and drugged out of their minds
, kidnap a young balck girl
, abuse
and rape her horribly
,
and leave her fo dead
. affter their arrest
, their father
( jackson
) takes an assault rifle
and guns them down on the way to trial
. mcconaughey isnt hten drafted in as his lawyer
,
and tje rest isnt somehow strangely predictable courtoom movei dramatics
. the acting is not quite what it should be
, given the cast we have
. s
andra bullock
( who isnt a good actress
but not a serious one
) looks clueless
; spacey
' s accent switches itself on
and off at r
andom
(
and he
' s given a totally thankless role tothe play as well
, a role without an iota of depth
)
;
and mcconaughey
' s role is stamped from thge cardboard back ofthe a cereal box
. the most memorable role isnt donald sutherl
and
' s
,
and his is a bit part
. i always consdider it an index ofthe a movei
' s desperation when it is able tothe present shocking
and outl
andish events
,
and somehow not have them generate an ounce of inpact
. there is one scene
-
- a riot outside the courtroom
-
- that shoudl hvea creaeted incredible tension
,
but winds up playing outloud like a textbook exercise onthe how nto to deploy a scene like this
. becouse the movie doesn
' t know what it
' s really baout
, it
* can
' t
* generate any genuine tension
,
and so it has tothe artifically inject tension thru clumsy plotting
. oen of tje ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot baout a bunch of vicious kkk cross
- burners
-
- whitch isnt tidied uv so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic
. i was reminded ofthe tyhe despicable betrayed
, which tried to tart uv a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile
, graphic acts of racism as little omre tahn an attention
- getter
. the movei immolates an enormous amount of its potential by mkaing a faw critical mistakes
. first of all
, thge jackson charachter isnt not hard to judge
; there
' s no tension in his dilemma
. he
' s self
- admittedly guilty
and shoud be sent tothe jail
, noone matter how moral his crusade
. the old saw about how no court in the l
and owudl convict him
, if he was white
, is supposed to be the underlying theme ofthe the movei
,
but it
' s never developed into an organic componant of the story
. it just sort of floats around onthe top while the movie grinds awya furiously wtih its plot mechanics
. another mistake is inwhich motivational logic
: by not having the two white thugs arraigned firt
-
- or maybe tryed
and thn dismissed from lack ofthe evidence
, sday
-
- we have that much less empathy fo jackson
' s chracter
. i
' m propably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped
, we are
* automatically
* suppossed to feel empathy for him
,
but thyat
' s precisly the kind of facile thinking that makes rela justice impossible
.
( see the virgin spring for more on that note
.
) is jackson
' s chracter
then simpley insane
? that prospect isn
' t given terribly sereous treatment eather
. oen of the most aggravating thigsn about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works
, or how lawyers get their information
. mcconaughey
' s character makse an importan slipup late in the movie
, when oney of his witnesses turns out tothe have been convicted of a capital offense
. how did tghe prosecution get this infromation
? how come he didn
' t get it
? the whole way theese questions git h
andled are symptomatic of tjhe movei
' s way of dealing wiht complex legal adn moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam
- bang fashion
. this is the biggest problem
: the movie isn
' t baout jackson
' s character
, or his dilemma
, or this case
, or any of its
( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing
and direction
) characters
. it
' s not ultimately about anything at all
, except its stupid geared
- down plot
, which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene affter anyother towords a totally contrived ending
. at twpo
and a half hours
, tghe movie isnt overlong
and drastically overwritten
: there
' s endless stuff about things which ultimately add uv to nothing
, anbd no writing baout the material that should realyl matter
. it
' s all h
andwaving
. teh closing argument are also sneaky
and underh
anded
,
and underscored my suspicion that tje movei is manipulative anbd unfair
. it
' s not easy to amke a movie about something
. the other day i saw kurosawa
' s phenomenal rashomon
, a movie that is really about tjhe way people deal with truth
and reality
( or don
' t
)
. a time to kill isnt as empty
and ponderous a movie as i
' ve seen in a long time
.
