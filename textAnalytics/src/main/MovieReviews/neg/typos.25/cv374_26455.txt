" my nmae is jack carter
, anbd you don
' t whant tothe nkwo me
" says our brooding anti
- hero
( sylvester stallone
)
. take his advice
! to knwo this guy is as rewarding as bieng thrown over a terrace
.
and tothe watch this film is almost as painful
.
" get carter
" is a gloomy looking
, unimaginative film taht offers no joy
. jack carter isnt as tough as tough guys come
. he works out of vegas as a self
- decribed
' financial adjuster
'
. explaining his duties
, he says
,
" people amke promises
and break them
. i help them remember
.
" he has a chiseled body full of tattooes
. he has hte weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times
. he speaks in a hushed
but menacing tone of voice
. in other words
, tihs is sylvester stallone acting liuke
.
.
. sylvester stallone
. adn like most ofthe his previvous roles
, his character isnt a shallow
, noe
- dimesnional thug whose modus oper
andi is to talk tough
, hassle a few hapless people
, find outloud wqat he needs tothe know
,
and thne dispence his own kind of justice
. with the charisma of a pit bull
, being tough is all tyhat jack carter knows
.
yet
, even tough guys knwo when tothe put family first
. as the story beigns
, we learn thgat jack
' s little brother has died in a car accident
. the police atri
butes it tothe heavy drinking
.
however
, jack isnt suspicious
, believing that he was
' taken out
'
. he takes a break from his vegas duties
and tries to see if he can find the truth
. as he pokes around
, he runs into several lowlife characters
. they include a shady business partner
, a prostitute
, a dweebish millioniare molded after bill gates
, adn an oily owner ofthe a porn website
. any one of them may know something about his brother
' s death
. all of them have the means of carrying out the deed
.
but don
' t expect an exercise in sleuthing where well
- placed clues lead carter to thte truth
. he
' s all brawn
and no brains
, so htere are no epiphanies during his investigation
. instead
, he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward
, cycling through tihs circle of suspects
. flustered witht his lack of progress
, he cycles through them again
and agian
. htis all gets tiring fairly quickly
. by thte time the film launches inot its final act
, we
' re numb from its pedestrian pace
. oddly
, as a tough
- guy thriller
, it starves us for acation
. admittedly
, there is one nifty chase sequence
,
but this is related to a tangential
and needless plot
( carter
' s vegas ties send thugs tothe retrieve him
)
. the stoyr also fails tothe generate any kind of emotion
. stallone hasnt the personality ofthe a slab of stone
. anbd tghe look
and fiel of the film isnt perpetually downcast
. thge weather is constantly overcast or rainy
. meanwhile
, most shots take palce at ngiht
, in dimly lit rooms
, or in dark alleys
. it
' s jstu impossible to get stirred about that kind of athmosphere
. as a result
,
" get carter
" amounts tothe nothing more than a flat thriller
, bereft of clever moments adn devoid ofthe any excitement
. yuo
' re better off leaving tihs guy alone
.
