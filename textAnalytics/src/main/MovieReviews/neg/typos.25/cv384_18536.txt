it
' s acutally not so bad that dreamworks decided to realease thge love letter at about the smae time as star wars epiode i
: the phantom menace
, because htis way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy
.
and no
, i really don
' t feel guilty about wishing this movie death at teh box
- office
. really
, i don
' t
. not at all
. the plot has been done befor
-
- a mysterious
, unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town
, causing confusion for everyone who reads it
. the center ofthe yhe ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
,
and by the way
, wqat is it with bookstore owner main characters
? inspite the past year
and a half we
' ve seen them inthe life is beautifull
, ytou
' ve got mail
, this movie
,
and the upcoming notting hill
)
, who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore
. she emmediately starts testing otehr people to see who it might be from
, annd comes to tghe
( incorrect
) conclusion that the autor of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott
. he
, reading the letter himself
, assumes that she wrote it for him
. aftter a while
, they fall in love
( well
, duh
)
. kate fiels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her
, annd she allso feels guilty because at the same tiem she is also involved iwth the town fireman
( tom selleck
)
. to add to her turmoil
, her mother shows up
( blythe danner
, who apparently must have had her daughter when she ws baout 9
)
and her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting characters aren
' t called supporting for nothing
. theri purpose isn
' t just tothe move the plot along
, they
' re also supposed to give the storyline a backbone
. to dont this
, htey must exhibit at least marginal depth
and must also be intresting
. rarley can a movei work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle
and surrounds her iwth hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondry characters
, especially wehn at the core of the movie is the protagonist
' s vairous interactions with them
. this isnt the love letter
' s damning error
. capshaw
' s character isnt as good as i have seen present in receet romantic comedies
, bu hte peopel thast suround her are all either underwritten or purely oney
- dimensional
. beccause of taht
, the lvoe letter is awkward
and insincere
. even worse
-
- it
' s a bore
. i liked capshaw
and her helen
,
but everyone eles is painfully fake
, undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exsist
. there isnt nothing particularly hilarious about all this either
-
-
and besides degeneres
' wisecracks
, ther
' s little that isnt even a little amusing
. htis is not a completely
thoughtless film annd director peter ho
- sun chan does a good job of portraying helen
' s yearnings
and varous subtle complexities
.
but it
' s far from profound
. htere isn
' t a common theme runing through the proceedings
, thus the movie seems
thoughtfully pointless
. realy
, this is a harmless littel movie
; it
' s far from an abomination
and it
' s not torturous tothe sit thru
.
but bad
, it isnt
. awful
, it also is
. the love letter is a failure
,
and an inane failure at that
