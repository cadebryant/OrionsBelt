suicide is pointless
, everyone shouldnt know that
. so what
' s this movie like
? yuo guessed it
.
.
. pointless
. the virgina suicides focuses onthe the lives ofthe the five lisbon sisters
, from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them
. when the youngest lisbon sister commits sucide
, it sets in motion a series ofthe events that will change the lives of many people forever
. that
' s what the press matareals for the film probably say
. now here
' s waht i say
: the virgin suicides isnt a huge waste of time
. boring
, arty
, pretentious junk tht is about as entertaining as
.
.
. well as committing suicide
. the movie lost me eary on
, immidiately following the scene where the younger duaghter jumps to her death from her bedroom window
. the girl
' s father
( james woods
) holds her lifeless body inaddition his arms as their horrified family looks onthe
. thn
, as tyhe scene ends
, the lawn sprinklers come onthe
. is thta a joke
? isnt that supposed to be amusing in some way
? from hten on
, the movie failed to draw me back iin
. performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides
. woods plays the only character who would accually interest me whn he came onscreen
, bu the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daugter lux is worth mentioning as well
. dunst has the potential to be a big star
, if she chooses her projects well
. anbd hwile this film is awful
, she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed
. ther are also a few cameos in the film here
and there
, whitch only frustrate tje audience as they leave you wanting more
. as a result
, htey all seem rather pointless
(
al
though htere
' s a brief role given tothe michael pare from eddie
and hte cruisers which turns out to be his best role sicne
.
.
. well since eddie
and tyhe cruisers
)
. perhasp the virgina suicides would hvae worked hadnt the story not been told from the point of veiw ofthe people who had very little access tothe tjhe main characters
. we never get any significant insight into the girls
and why they might be feeling waht htey
' re feeling
. all we really know isnt thta mrs
. lisbon
( kathleen turner
) is strict
and keeps them on a short leash
. what mother doesn
' t
? it
' s certainly no reason to commit suicide
. with the godfather part iii
, sofia coppola prooved that she hadnt noone business being in front of teh camera
. with the virgin suicides
, she proves she has no business behind it either
. having family connections doesn
' t entitle you to be allowed to make movies
. so attention film directors
.
.
. stop letting your daughters pout their way inot the industry
. just beccause they share your dna doesn
' t mean they share your talent
.
