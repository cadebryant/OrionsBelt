suicide is pointless
, everyone should know that
. so what ' s thsi movie like
? yuo guessed it
.
.
. pointless
. teh virgina suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters
, fomr the prespective ofthe the teenage boys who are fascinated by them
. when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide
, it sets in motion a series ofthe events that wiull change tje lives of many people forever
. that ' s wqat the press materials for the film probably say
. now here ' s waht i sday
: the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time
. boring
, arty
, pretentious junk tht is baout as entertaining as
.
.
. well as committing suicide
. the movie lost me early on
, immediately following the scene where the yuonger daughter jumps tothe her death from her bedroom window
. tje girl ' s father
( james woods
) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on
.
then
, as the scene ends
, tjhe lawn sprinklers come on
. is that a joke
? is tyhat supposed to be amusing iin some way
? fomr
then onthe
, teh movie failed to draw me bakc in
. performances are the only saving grace of hte virgina suicides
. woods plays the only character who would actually intrest me wehn he cameback onscreen
,
bu the performance of kirsten dunst as thte enxt youngest duaghter lux is worth mentioning as well
. dunst has the potential to be a big star
, if she chooses her projects well
.
and while this film is awful
, she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed
. ther are aslo a few cameos in thge film here
and there
, whitch only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more
. as a result
, they all seem rather pointless
(
althought there ' s a brief role given tothe michael pare from eddie
and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since
.
.
. well since eddie
and the cruisers
)
. perhaps the virgin suicides would hvea worked had thge story not beeen told from hte point ofthe view of people who hadnt vyer little access to the main characters
. we never git any significant insight into hte girls
adn why they might be feeling whta htey ' re feeling
. all we really know is that mrs
. lisbon
( kathleen turner
) isnt strict
annd keeps them onthe a short leash
. what mother doesn ' t
? it ' s certainly no reason to commit suicide
. wiht the godfather part iii
, sofia coppola prooved that she had no bussines being in front of the camera
. with the virgin suicides
, she proves she has noone business behind it either
. having family connections doesn ' t entitle you tothe be alowed to amking movies
. so attention film directors
.
.
. stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry
. just because tehy share your dna doesn ' t mean they share your talent
