i think maybe it ' s time for the batman series to be put to rest
. not only has the firt two films ' unsettling insight into whta it would really take for someone to mkea himself into a
" superhero
" been abandoned
,
but this noe throws any lingering realism out the window
and goes fo all
- outloud camp with few traces of tje self
- mocking restraint ofthe the relatively light
- hearted thrid installment
. let me give you an exemple
: in tyhe frist scene of the movie
, batman
( george clooney
)
anbd robin
( chris o ' donnell
) are summoned to a museum that hasnt beeen literally turned to ice by mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
) in an attempt tothe steal a diamond
. mr
. freeze ' s thugs are armed with none otehr than hockey sticks
,
but this is no problem for our heroes
: automatic skates shoot out of their shoes
, at whcih point robin manages to get hold ofthe a hockey stick
, grabs the diamond
,
and stick
- handles it thru tghe museum
. i might have expected this from an airplane
- style farce
,
bu i don ' t think that ' s what this movei is suposed to be
. after all
, yhe previvous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of thge superhero
/ action genre
and kept the corny death
- defying stunts to a minumum
, while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony
. not any more
; the list goes on
and on in this oen
. robin holds onto thge outside of a flying rocket ship 30
, 000 feet high in the atmosphere
, climbing infact thge doorjam to save batman
. mr
. freeze
and poison ivy
( uma thurman
) leap from a skyscraper
anbd survive by landing in a small pond
. a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress thta seems tothe have beeen stolen from the old he
- man cartoons
. my very favorite exemple isnt the scene in whitch batgirl
( alicia silverstone
) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs
, during which they come uv with tyhe clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline
adn setting it on fire to distract her
. not bad
,
but wouldn ' t tyhe police
( or maybe batman
?
) notice if the road was onthe fire
? i knew gotham city was tihs crazy anarchic place
,
bu
.
.
.
. it allso seems that the creators ofthe the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rul that there hvae tothe be omre main charactors
and plot lines in each successive installment
. as if three protaganists
and two villains weren ' t anough
, batman
and robin furhter weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of hte failing health of bruce wayne ' s butler alfred
( michael gough
)
, wich might have seemed poignant if it wasn ' t surronded by so much silliness
, as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce ' s girlfriend which serve noone purpose other than tothe remind us that she is inthe thte movei
. all this might be semi
- excusable if the story were interesting
and entertaining
,
but it isn ' t
. in fatc
, it ' s kind ofthe boring
. mr
. freeze
and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson ' s joker
annd danny devito ' s penguin
. their evil plot is as predictable
( schwarzenegger atcually pronounces thge words
,
" today gotham city
, tomorrow the world
!
"
) as it is lame
- brained
( didn ' t it ever ocurr to poison ivy thyat freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too
?
)
.
and robin ' s constant challenging ofthe batman mostly just mkaes him look bull
- headed
and stupid
and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner infront thte first place
. strip away the stars
, the fancy set design
,
adn yhe status as a
" batman movie
,
"
and all you have here is anyother barely passable summer action flick
.
