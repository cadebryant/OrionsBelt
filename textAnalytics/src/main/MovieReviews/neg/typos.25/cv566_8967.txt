i tihkn maybe it
' s time for the batman series to be put to rest
. not only hasnt tjhe first two films
' unsettling insight inot what it would really take for someone to amke himself into a
" superhero
" beeen ab
andnoed
,
but htis one throws any lingering realism out the window
and goes for all
- out camp with fewd traces of the self
- mocking restraunt of the relatively light
- hearted third installment
. let me give you an example
: in tje first scene ofthe the movie
, batman
( george clooney
)
and robin
( chris o
' donnell
) are summoned tothe a museum thyat has been literally turned to ice by mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
) in an atempt to steal a diamond
. mr
. freeze
' s thugs are armed with none otehr than hockey sticks
,
but this is no probelm for our heroes
: automatic skates shoot out of their shoes
, at whcih point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick
, grabs tghe dimond
,
and stick
- h
andles it through thge museum
. i might ahve expected this from an airplane
- stlye farce
,
but i don
' t think that
' s what this movie is suposed to be
. after all
, thge previous three batman movies were actully fairly realistic by the st
andards of thte superhero
/ action genre
and kept tyhe corny death
- defying stunts to a minimum
, while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount ofthe irony
. not any more
; teh list goes on
and onthe inthe this oney
. robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30
, 000 feet high in the atmosphere
, climbing infact tghe door to save batman
. mr
. freeze
and poison ivy
( uma thurman
) leap from a skyscraper
and survive by l
anding in a small pond
. a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to ahve beeen stolen from the old he
- man cartoons
. my very favorite example is the scene iin which batgirl
( alicia silverstone
) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs
, during whic they cmo up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline
and setting it onthe fier to distract her
. nto bad
,
but wouldn
' t teh police
( or mabye batman
?
) notice if tghe road wass on fire
? i knew gotham city was tihs crazy anarchic palce
,
but
.
.
.
. it also seems that thte creators of teh batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that ther have to be more main cahracters anbd plot lines in each successive installment
. as if three protagonists
and two villains weren
' t anough
, batman
and robin further weighs itself down iwth an underdeveloped side story ofthe the failing health ofthe bruce wayne
' s
butler alfred
( michael gough
)
, wich might hve seemed poignant if it wasn
' t surronded by so much silliness
, as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce
' s girlfriend which serve no purpose otehr than to remind us that she isnt in the movie
. all this might be semi
- excusable if the story were interesting
and entertaining
,
but it isn
' t
. in fact
, it
' s kind of boring
. mr
. freeze
and posion ivy pale iin comparison as villains tothe past baddies such as jack nicholson
' s joker
and danny devito
' s penguin
. theri evil plot is as predictable
( schwarzenegger actually pronounces yhe words
,
" todya gotham city
, tomorrow the world
!
"
) as it is lame
- brained
( didn
' t it ever occur to poisin ivy that freezing the entire world owudl kill her precious plants too
?
)
.
and robin
' s constant chalenging of batman mostly jsut makes him look bull
- headed
and stupid anbd makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the frist palce
. strip awya thge stars
, the fancy set design
, annd the status as a
" batman movie
,
" adn all you have here is another barely passable summer acation flick
.
