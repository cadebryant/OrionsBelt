these days
, people have rather short attention span
and hardly anything cant satisfy them for hte long run
. 1970s nestolgia isnt aready wearing off
,
and nowe
, people are becomming more
and more interseted inspite 1980s
. few years in the future
, early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age ofthe nostalgia
. howver
, i doubt thta peopel are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period
. one of the reason woudl surely be films like national lampoon
' s loaded weapon 1
, thast
, in many ways
, symbolise the biggest probelm of contempoary american film industry
- lack of originality
and ideas
. bieng made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series
, this film pairs twpo l
. a
. policemen
- jack colt
( emilio estevez
)
, burn
- out alcoholic cop on the edge
, annd wes luger
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, by
- the
- book policeman
, days away from retirement
. two of them
, following the murder of luger
' s ex
- partner
, must confront evil genaral mortars
( william shatner
)
, crime lord who is going tothe flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies
. hte authors of this films
( whose directer
, ginee quintano
, worked onthe such projects like third
and fourth sequel of polical academy
) lacked any original idea befor htey undertook the projects
,
and that reflects in the lack plot
, characters
, annd
, even origonal lines
. the plot
, or what goes for the plot in thsi movei
, is nothing moreso than a series of gags that amking laugh ofthe smoe popular films made in previous few years
( apart from lethal weapon series
, this film
" borrows
" its female lead from basic instinct
)
. the best gags
, are
, smae as with many other similar movies
, shown in the trailers
. the rest simply doesn
' t work
. only those who used to watch a lot ofthe hollywood products inspite that period owudl laugh
. others would probaly wince at thte lameness ofthe humour
. some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a hwile
.
but
, at tjhe end
, spending hour
and half inwhich front of this disorganised mess of a movei is simply not worth the effort
. the film was somtimes criticised for being the parody of a series thyat already had strong comic overtones
. the authors ofthe lethal weapon returnd tjhe favour by using teh loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel
.
