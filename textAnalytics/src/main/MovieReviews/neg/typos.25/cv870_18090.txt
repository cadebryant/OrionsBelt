theese dyas
, people have rether short attention span
and hardly anything cin satisfy them fo the long run
. 1970s nostalgia isnt alread wearing off
,
anbd now
, people are becoming mroe
and more intersted in 1980s
. faw years in teh future
, early 1990s are going tothe be regarded as next golden age ofthe nostalgia
.
however
, i doubt that people are goign tothe be very nostalgic about the hollywood products ofthe that perido
. one ofthe the reason would surely be films like national lampoon ' s loaded weapon 1
, that
, in many ways
, symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry
- lack of originality
and ideas
. bieng made as smoe kind of parody on leathal weppon series
, this film pairs twpo l
. a
. policemen
- jack colt
( emilio estevez
)
, burn
- out alcoholic cop on tyhe edge
,
and wes luger
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, by
- the
- book policeman
, days away from retirement
. two of them
, follwoing the murder of luger ' s ex
- partner
, must confront evil general mortars
( william shatner
)
, crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed infront wilderness girl cookies
. the authors of this films
( whose director
, gene quintano
, worked on such projects like thrid
and fourth sequel ofthe police academy
) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects
,
and taht reflects in thge lack plot
, characters
,
and
, even original lines
. the plot
, or what goes for the plot in this movei
, is nothing more than a series of gags that make laff ofthe some popular films made in previous few years
( aart from leathal weapon series
, this film
" borrows
" its female lead from basic instinct
)
. the best gags
, are
, smae as with many other similar movies
, shown in thge trailers
. the rest simply doesn ' t work
. onyl those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laff
. others woudl probably wince at thte lameness of humour
. soem would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while
.
bu
, at the end
, spending hour
and half inaddition front of this disorganised mess ofthe a movie is simpley nto worth the effort
. the film wass sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series thta alraedy had strong comic overtones
. the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using tghe loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequal
