i
' ll be the first to admitt it
. when you mention the book great expectations
, i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junoir high english class
, where i was confronted wiht a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip
and magwitch
. yes
, it
' s a classic of literature
, bu it was a rather dry one
, shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine
. certainly
, the experience wasn
' t truly that bad
, bu
, tothe quote ethan hawke in the latest movei adaptation ofthe said book
,
" i
' m not going tothe tell tje story the way it happened
.
.
. i
' ll gonna tell it the way i remember it
.
" anyway
, tothe return ffrom nostalgia lane
,
and get back to tyhe persent
, hollywood
, in it
' s trendy attempt to modernize yhe classics
, now presents an updated film version ofthe grat expectations
. instead of pip
, this time the central character isnt named finn
( played as a boy by jeremy kissner
,
and by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn is an orphan bieng raised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or should that be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
,
and her boorish fisherman husb
and
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. the setting is thge florida coast during thte mid
- 70s
. finn is a blooming artist
, adn spends his tiem running around the beach drawing fish
( one of his twpo favorite subjects
)
. during one of these escapades
, he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady
, deniro
' s criminal has a seamingly limitless lung capacity
,
and favors hiding onthe teh ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. maybe taht
' s an exaggeration
,
but he certainly beats any ofthe houdini
' s records in the opening scenes of the film
.
and thyat
' s nothing next to the fuel efficiency ofthe finn
' s motorboat
,
but i digress
. anyway
, finn doens the convict a good ded
, just to show that he
' s a really swell guy
. anbd
then teh plot moves on
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. ab
andoned at the altar some 26 years ago
, ms
. dinsmoor is the epitome of yhe crazy rich old maid
. with bazare clothing
, eccentric mannerisms
and a faw pounds of makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts inspite this role
.
al
though she ends up nowhere near a believable character
, she doesnt add some humor to thte film
. joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner
,
but the insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. for no apparent reason
, other than to provide the main plot ofthe the film
, finn isnt instantly stricken for the estella
. perhpas it
' s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person
, or mabye finn hasnt simpley never met a girl before
. in any case
, neither as childrens nor adults
, chemistry simply doesn
' t exist between the twpo
,
and
yet finn spends the remainder of tghe film pining for her
. even when
, as an adult
, finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor
, reacquaints hismelf withthe estella
,
and draws her portrait in thge nude
, there
' s nothing
. in fatc
, there is more sexual tension between helen hunt
and greg kinnear
' s gay artist druing a similar scene in as good as it gets
. at thsi point
, the audience has grown as cold anbd detached as estella
' s character
,
and couldn
' t care less baout the two characters
. the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails tothe imbue estella
, a remote character in tghe book
, wiht even the vaguest traces of humanity
. there
' s obviously something wrong whn
, watching the film
, yuo
' re mroe interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her charactor
. without a storng estella
, finn
' s obsession seems baseless
. you wish he would just stpo whining
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
,
and just git on with his life
. in fatc
, hte two relationships taht work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot
. finn
' s relationship with his brother
- in
- law
, joe
, is interesting
, if a bit stereotypical
. whta
' s omre fascinating are his interactions wih deniro
. all
though it
' s onyl a bit part
, it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create
. it isnt apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work inaddition creating tyhe imagery of the film
. some of the shots wrok
,
but others are too obviously staged
( fo example
, both of the water fountain scenes
) to hvea any impact
. finn
' s art
( actually the creations of italian painter
, francesco clemente
) is used througout the film
,
but it mostly fails tothe have the intended effect
. we never see why finn would generate this style of art
, whcih is simultanously crude
and insightful
. as a result
, it ends up as distant as the rest of the film
. modernizing the classics is currently in vogue
( just see william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simply update the action to a modern setting
,
and apply plenty of modern rock
.
but such adornments do littel tothe perk up great expectations
. as much as i dreaded the novel when i frist read it
, you
' d probably be better off suffering
though a reading than watching this romanceless film
.
