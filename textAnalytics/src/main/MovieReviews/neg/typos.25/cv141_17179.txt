and

, marshall bell
, cliff curtis
, julio oscar mechoso i suppose i
' m nto extremely surprised thta
" virus
" comes tothe us from a deciple of james cameron
( john bruno
)
,
and if i strain real hard
, i could even sday that it
' s an obvious given
, particuarly looking from thge st
andpoint ofthe mr
. cameron
' s early works
. in fact
,
" virus
" is yot another in tjhe long line ofthe action
/ horror
/ paranoya thrillers from the
" aliens
" vein
: a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only tothe find a mortally
- threatning entity is out to get them
, a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies
, annd maybe even to the frist picturesk
, albeit redeveloped by cameron iin his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem
and bigger budgets to come inwhich his future
. no such thnig will ahppen tothe bruno
, whom i believe worked in some capacity onthe that quasi
- l
andmark feature
; while bruno may have studied under cameron
' s wing for years
and years
, i
' m beginning to wonder at what capacity
, adn what exactlly did he leran ffrom him
. infront fatc
,
" virus
" should at least be mediocre
; the fatc thyat bruno coudl have worked under a man like cameron
- a director who
, if anytying
, just konws how to mkae a movei
- anbd
then amking a film like
" virus
" isnt jstu another detraction fairly aimed at this z
- grade schlockfest of a film
, albeit a z
- grade schlockfest with a respectable budget
. the film seems to not only borrow it
' s plot from last year
' s similarly
- fated
" deepo rising
,
"
but aslo from a clunkish b
- movie fomr tyhe
' 80s called
" leviathan
,
" an underwater thriller starring peter weller
, richard crenna
, hector eliz
ando
,
and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform thta was part
" alien
,
" part john carpenter
' s twisted remake of
" the thing
.
"
" virus
,
" again
, has a similair
, uh
, selling point
: a group of sailors onthe a boat stumble apon a russian cruiser tht is dead inwhich the water
. they git on
. htey break up into pairs annd investingate
.
and they find an alien lifeform onthe board that comes in tje form of energy
, has taken over all the machines on board
, have meshed tje machines with parts fomr corpses
,
and hve deemed humankind thier enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary
( ha ha
)
. nto that any of this is forthe a second scary or the least bited involving
; nto only does this film start off whith a chintzy bond
- ian opening
( the destruction of tjhe cruiser via a satellite transmission fomr mir
)
, destroying any of the suspense in wqat coudl appen
,
but it also fails tothe bring us any interesting chracters
. ofthe its motley crew
, it only choses as its potentially eccentric casted ofthe characters a lead woman skipper
, a masculine potential
- romantic
- interest
, a drunken captain
, a balck techniican
, a tatooed aborigine
, a manic russian survivor
,
and a couple otehr c
andidates for alien food
, none whom are yhe least bit intresting or more dimensional thna a thin
, plain piece ofthe writing papper
.
and it
' s not the traditionnal argument for films like these
, where you may in fatc want them all tothe be eaten
( even
" aliens
" played with the karma ofthe tyhe arrogant soliders
, bu this was more of a plus
- side for the film as a wohle than the opposite
)
; instead
, as anyother cliche goes
, you just don
' t give a damn
. i almost don
' t even ahve to sday that the acting fomr everyone ranges from sub
- par tothe horrific
, the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is
( annd she is
, jsut not raelly here
)
and the latter bieng
- adn it pains me to sday this as he
' s a particular favorite of mine
- donald sutherl
and
, who plays the captain so poorly anbd without a second of credibility that tihs will go down as the performance
- of
- hwihc
- he
- should
- be
- ashamed
. liek anthony hopkins for
" legends of the fall
"
( yhe line
" scrooooooo
' em
" has been thus embroidered apon my membrance
)
. or peter o
' toole in
" caligula
.
" great actor
, horrific performance
. it happens eveyr nowe
and
then
,
and it onyl helps sutherl
and
' s career that no one
, except for an elite few
, even bothered to see this film
.
though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years
, waiting until it can be released
and make as much money as it possibly can
( read
: early january
, when everyone
' s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar
- nominees
)
, it does sohw that universal shelled out a preety penny to make this film
: it
' s laden witht complex machinery
, boasts respectable prodcution design
,
and it may even feature believeable special effects
.
.
. if
, of course
, i
, or anyone else
, could see them
.
" virus
" mostly takes place on a larg
, ab
andond cruiser
, anbd mostly at night until teh dawn
, anbd mostly without the use of lihts
, not so much for tghe productivity of the alien creatures in their persuit ofthe theri human prey
,
but more so because
, as the hollywood cliche seems to go
,
" if it
' s dark anough
,
then the special effects wiull be more believeable
.
"
and if you don
' t believe me
, go back
and rent
" godzilla
,
"
and tell me if there
' s even one shooted where we see godzilla either a
) in his entirety in one wide shooted
, or b
) n the light so tht we cant at least see him
( well
, you don
' t really ahve tothe sit through it agina
; just take my word for it
)
.
but all of this doesn
' t matter since
" virus
" is basicaly jstu one loud
, cluttered mess ofthe a movie
. the action scenes are muddled
and as difficult to follow as any action movie i
' ve ever seen
( my
, um
, favorite part wass the scene where a trio ofthe them end up somehow on tghe outside ofthe the ship
, during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves
, rain
,
and any other ocean
- extremeties thte film can cook uv
,
then end up back in the ship whn one of them isnt revealed tothe have apparently drowned
- well
, i must say
, thanks forthe telling me afterwards because i sure couldn
' t figure it out when i saw it
)
. imagin the first attack of tje aliens in
" aliens
,
" shot from the pov ofthe thte soldiers
and
then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow
and done without any dramatic intensity
,
and that
' s basically teh whole of
" virus
"
: one horribly
- directed action scene after the other
, capping it off wih a proposterous gadget that saves the day
and at least a couple of teh original casted members
.
and my god
, it
' s a long damn sit
. wih no interesting characters
, no dramatic urgency
, noone tension
, not one ogod moment ofthe acation
,
and no mesmerizing visuals
, it
' s a wonder that it even got made
. we alraedy know thyat big movie studios
' mentality is shallow at best
,
and movies liek
" out ofthe sight
"
and
" saving private ryan
" give you more faith in them
,
but movies like
" virus
" manage to drain a little more out of tjhe pool
. i alomst wish thgat instead of making thsi movie
, john bruno had gone cinema verite
and captured the meetings with univeral heads when they gave this film a green light
. they read hte script
, they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars inot a director who might have veyr well been a cameron hack
(
and he isnt
)
,
and tehy still went ahead with the project
, only to have bruno
and company shit bcak in their face
. even
though i hold univeral inaddition contempt forthe making this horrible movie
, i
' d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr
. bruno for mkaing a movei that coudl be tihs bad
. in fact
, shouts ofthe
" egad
, man
, what were you donig whn ytou worked fo cameron anyway
?
" are not only justifiable
,
but encouraged
.
