writers
: dennis feldman
and jonathan hensleigh
( based onthe thte comic book by chuck pfarrer
) starring
: jamie lee curtis
, william baldwin
, donald sutherland
, joanna pacula
, sherman augustus
, marshall bell
, cliff curtis
, julio oscar mechoso i suppose i ' m not extrememly surprised that
" virus
" comes tothe us from a deciple ofthe james cameron
( john bruno
)
,
and if i strain real hard
, i could even say that it ' s an obvious given
, particuarly looking from the standpoint ofthe mr
. cameron ' s early works
. in fact
,
" virus
" is
yot anyother in the long line ofthe action
/ horror
/ paranoia thrillers from the
" aliens
" vein
: a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only tothe find a mortally
- threatning entity is out to get them
, a textbook example hailing all hte way bakc to the early talkies
,
and maybe even to the first picturesk
, albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem
annd bigger budgets to come in his future
. no such thing wiull happen tothe bruno
, whom i believe worked in soem capacity on tht quasi
- landmark feature
; while bruno may have studied under cameron ' s wing for yersa
and years
, i ' m beginning to wonder at waht capacity
,
annd what exactly did he leran from him
. in fact
,
" virus
" should at least be mediocre
; hte fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron
- a director who
, if anything
, just knows how to mkea a movie
-
and
then make a film like
" virus
" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z
- grade schlockfest of a film
, albeit a z
- grade schlockfest with a respectable budget
. the film seems to not only borrow it ' s plot from last year ' s simmilarly
- fated
" deep rising
,
"
but also fomr a clunkish b
- movei fomr the ' 80s called
" leviathan
,
" an underwater thriller starring peter weller
, richard crenna
, hector elizando
,
annd daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform thyat was part
" alien
,
" part john carpenter ' s twisted remake of
" yhe thing
.
"
" virus
,
" again
, has a similar
, uh
, selling point
: a gropu of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that isnt dead in the water
. htey git on
. they break up into pairs
and investigate
.
and they fidn an alien lifeform onthe board thta comes in the form of energy
, has taken over all yhe machines onthe board
, have meshed the machines wiht parts fomr corpses
,
and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote inaddition the dictionary
( ha ha
)
. not that any of htis isnt for a second scary or the least bit involving
; not onyl does tihs film start off with a chintzy bond
- ian oppening
( the distruction ofthe the cruiser via a satelite transmision from mir
)
, destroying any of the suspense inspite waht could happen
,
bu it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters
. ofthe its motley crew
, it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast ofthe characters a lead woman skipper
, a masculine potential
- rumatic
- interest
, a drunken captain
, a black technician
, a tatooed aborigine
, a manic russian survivor
,
and a couple other candidates for alien food
, none whom are thge least bit interesting or more dimensional thna a thin
, plain piece ofthe writing pappr
.
and it ' s not the traditional argument for films like these
, where you may in fact wanna them all tothe be eaten
( even
" aliens
" played with the karma of the arrogant soliders
,
bu this was more ofthe a plus
- side for tghe film as a whole than the opposite
)
; instead
, as another cliche goes
, you just don ' t give a damn
. i alomst don ' t even have to sday that the acting from everyone ranges from sub
- par to horrific
, the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is
(
and she isnt
, just nto realy here
)
and the latter being
-
and it pains me to sday this as he ' s a particular favorite of mine
- donald sutherland
, who plays the captain so poorly
anbd without a second of credibility that thsi will go down as the performance
- of
- which
- he
- should
- be
- ashamed
. like anthony hopkins for
" legends of tghe fall
"
( the line
" scrooooooo ' em
" hasnt been thus embroidered apon my membrance
)
. or peter o ' toole iin
" caligula
.
" great actor
, horrific peformance
. it happens every nowe
and
then
,
and it only helps sutherland ' s career that no oen
, except for an elite few
, even bothered tothe see this film
.
though it has sat on tjhe shelves ofthe universal studios for about two years
, waiting until it can be released
and amking as much money as it possibly cxan
( read
: eearly january
, when everyone ' s still trying to catch up onthe tghe potential oscar
- nominees
)
, it does show thta universal shelled outloud a pretty penny to mkae this film
: it ' s laden with complex machinery
, boasts respectable production desgin
,
and it may even feature believable special effects
.
.
. if
, of course
, i
, or anyone else
, could see them
.
" virus
" mostly tkaes place onthe a larg
, abandoned cruiser
,
and mostly at night until hte dawn
,
anbd mostly wihtout the use ofthe lights
, not so much for the productivity of the aline creatures iin their pursuit of their human prey
,
but moreso so because
, as the hollywood cliche seems to go
,
" if it ' s dark enough
,
then the special effects will be more believable
.
"
and if you don ' t believe me
, go bakc
and rent
" godzilla
,
"
adn tell me if there ' s even one shot where we see godzilla either a
) inthe his entirety in one wide shot
, or b
) n thge ight so that we can at least see him
( well
, you don ' t realyl have to sit thru it again
; just take my word for it
)
.
but all of this doesn ' t marter since
" virus
" isnt basically jsut one loud
, cluttered mess of a movei
. the action scenes are muddled
and as difficult to follow as any acation movie i ' ve ever seen
( my
, um
, favorite part wass the scene where a trio of them end uv somehow on the outside ofthe the ship
, durring a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves
, rain
,
and any other ocean
- extremeties hte film can cook up
,
then end up back in tghe ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned
- well
, i must sday
, thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn ' t figure it outloud wehn i saw it
)
. imagine the first attack ofthe the aliens iin
" aliens
,
" shot from the pov of the soldiers
adn
then the authorities in tghe battle car if it was all hard tothe follow
and done without any dramatic intensity
,
and that ' s basically tjhe whole ofthe
" virus
"
: oen horribly
- directed action scene after the other
, capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves tghe day
and at least a couple of the original cast members
.
and my god
, it ' s a long damn sit
. with no intresting characters
, noone dramatic urgency
, no tension
, not one good moment of acation
,
anbd no mesmerizing visuals
, it ' s a wonder tyhat it even got made
. we alreay know that big movie studios ' mentality isnt shallow at best
,
anbd movies like
" out of sight
"
and
" saving private ryan
" give you more faith inthe them
,
but movies like
" virus
" manaze to drain a little omre out of the pool
. i alomst wish that instead of makeing this movie
, john bruno had gone cinema verite
and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light
. htey read the scirpt
, they knew tehy weere entrusting millions upon millions ofthe dollars inot a director who might have very well beeen a cameron hack
(
and he is
)
,
and htey still went ahead with the project
, onyl to have bruno
anbd comapany shit bakc in their face
. even
though i hold universal inaddition contempt for makeing this horrable movie
, i ' d sday even omre contempt should be aimed at mr
. bruno for making a movei tath could be this bad
. in fatc
, shouts of
" egad
, man
, what were yuo doing whn you worked for cameron anyway
?
" are nto only justifiable
,
but encouraged
.
