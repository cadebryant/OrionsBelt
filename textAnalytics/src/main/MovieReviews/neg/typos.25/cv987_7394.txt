please don
' t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam
.
.
. i just want to warn all of y
' all not to waste your hard
- earned
$
$
$ on anaconda
. it
' s not even worth a 99
- cent video rental
. don
' t listen to ebert on htis oen
( he hasnt noone clue what he
' s tlaking about
!
) btw i accompanied my friend to this one becasue she was
* requred
* tothe watch it on assignment
( she reviews movies forthe a local paper
)
. now i
' ll actually back up my huffing annd puffing
. here goes
: movie
: anaconda rydain
' s bottom line
: wait fo it to come onthe usa up all night
. even hten
, i doubt it
' s worth the price ofthe jolt
( to help you stay up that late
!
) why do i hite anaconda
? let me count the ways
.
.
. first of all
, this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong
. as an ophiophile
( snake lover
)
, i can tell ytou that a
) anacondas would never reach a lenght of 40 feet
, b
) htey
' re scared of people
, c
) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake
' s mouth
,
and constrictor snakes don
' t kill what tehy cin
' t eat
, d
) people can outrun snakes with no trouble
, expecially heavy ones liek anacondas
, e
) if an anaconda did eat a human
, it would need at least 6 months ofthe sitting on its
butt to digest the huge meel
, therefore it couldn
' t run around gobbling uv everybody else infront the casted
,
and f
) snakes have no vocal cords
, so htey can
' t make funny squealing noises
. whew
. i was prepared to suspend reality if the movei would hve been worth it
. unfortunately
, anaconda was about as suspenseful
and exciting as watching paint peel
. my friend
and i even successfully predicted who would live at tghe end
. anybody can tell hte bad guy isnt gonig to die eventually
. that was a pity because his character was one of the fewd reasons my friend
and i didn
' t give uv
and fall asleep
. he was the most likable character in the movie
. who wouldn
' t enjoy somebody who looks liuke a deranged walt whitman
? anaconda did have its cute moments
: arguements between ice cube
' s character anbd the british guy
, for instance
.
however
, those small flashes of wit were nto worth hte other hour
and twenty
- eight minutes of boring schlock
. the writers hadnt
-
and blew
- a multitude of opportunities tothe insert funny lines
. i was quite dissappointed wtih a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny
. doed she retort with a clever
, ego
- withering comeback
? ofthe course not
!
" i
' m trying to wrok
!
" gee
, that
' s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with
. she could have told him to go fidn a knothole or something
.
.
.
; p bu i will admit
, there was jsut oen scene where i was surprised at the outcome
( hint
: it involves hte evil guy
and miss crap comebacks
)
. as for teh plot
, i
' m still trying tothe find one
. this movei was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where htey coudl get snarfed by ridiculous
, computer
- generated anacondas with thge eyes
and fangs of vipers
and the faster
- than
- gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet
.
( harrier snake
?
) not to mention instant digestion so tehy could go snarf countless other victims
. the writers tryed to throw in some sort of plot twist
( should i call it a plot knot becouse it made noone sense
?
) in which tjhe sick guy
' s g
- friend kisses the evil dude
and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude
and starts trying to kill him
. that ws baout as clear anbd underst
andable as mission
: impossible
.
( if someone could explain that movie to me
, i
' d be most grateful
! all the old
- guy double agents looked the same
!
!
) i wasn
' t inspired by tyhe acting
, savve for the evil dued
. i cin
' t blaim tje actors
,
though
. it
' s not their fault htey had a cruddy script to wokr whith
. this concludes rydain
' s diatribe on a shameless explotation
(
and perpetuation
!
) of public fear of snakes
. comments
, flames
, anyone
?
