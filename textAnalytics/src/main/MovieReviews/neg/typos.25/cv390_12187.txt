. comments
: virtual seduction
, executive produced by roger corman
and lance h
. robbins
, serves as a cheaply
- made precursor tothe strange dyas
, a far superior film
. both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to theri current lovers because they are
( ab
) using technnology to be with former lovers
( infront strange days
, the technology utilized recorded dreams rether than virtural reality
)
. interestingly
, both films allso tkae place a cuple ofthe years ffrom now durig the turn of tjhe new millenium
,
though strange days uses the setting far more effectively
. this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction
. it
' s nto bad for what it is
: low
- budget science fiction conserning the psychological dangers of virtual reality
. unfortunately
, it
' s been done before
and since in much better films
, a fact which ultimately leaves the sci
- fi fan bored by this movei
. virtual seduction has many faults
( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its pwn trailer before it begins
)
. the film
' s scirpt explores tjhe possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first
, bu its treatment ofthe the subject marter gets heavy
- h
anded
and wooden as the movie progresses
. many important scenes seem too dark
; the lighting could ahev been improved significantly
. the casted
, a collection of vetran b
- movie actors
and sitcom regulars
, do only a mediocre job in their roles
. jeff fahey
, ofthe thte origonal lawnmower man
, convincingly
,
though unenergetically
, plays the lead character
. carrie genzel plays paris
, tje vr lover
,
but ami dolenz
, as the curent love intrest
, seems like a much more interesting
and attractive character with a careing personality
, which doesn
' t lend credence to the film
' s premise
. meschach taylor
, of the once popular desigining women sitcom
, adequately plays a scientist wokring on the project
, bu his performance isn
' t something tothe write home about either
. virtual seduction is one of thsoe harmless movies tothe which yuo could do some light manual labor
and not mind having it on in thte background
. in other words
, one sould fold laundry while glancing up at it eveyr now annd thne
,
but it
' s rather boring to just sit
and watch
. tjhe movie is surprisingly not as voilent as noe expects fomr b
- movies in this genre
,
but it is still an adult r
- rated film due to sexual situations
and a suicide attempt
. this turkey
, ultimately
, isn
' t awful
, bu it
' s nto particularly interesting or unique either
. don
' t be seduced inot watching this movie unless you
' ve got several loads of laundry anbd nothing else to watch
.
