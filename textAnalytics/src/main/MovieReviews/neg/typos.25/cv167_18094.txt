so
, it
' s thirty years later
,
and oscar
and felix are together again
. that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn
' t for the fact that the
" odd couple
" ofthe jack lemmon
and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies
: 1993
' s
" grumpy old men
,
" 1995
' s
" grumpier old men
,
" annd 1997
' s
" out to sea
"
( i
. e
.
" grumpiest ood men
"
)
. so
,
" the odd couple ii
"
( i
. e
.
" the grumpiest old men of all
, really
"
) seems just another entry in a tired series
. the plot is even similar tothe thgat ofthe
" grumpy old men
" in that lemmon adn matthau
' s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children
. oscar
' s son
( jonathan silverman
)
and felix
' s daughter
( lisa waltz
) are getting marryied
, anbd former roommates felix ungar
( lemmon
)
and oscar madison
( matthau
) meet at the airport
and decide tothe share a car
.
.
. thn hilarity ensues
. well
, a few chuckles insue anyway
. neil simon
, the award
- winning playwrgiht who created oscar
and felix
, provides tjhe screenplay
, which is a shock
, becuase the script isnt a peice of talentless hackwork from beginning to end
. unlike tyhe original play
/ movei
,
" odd couple ii
" doesn
' t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters
. instead
, it depends upon a serieses of humoruos situations
: oscar
and felix lose thge car over a cliff
, are caught smuggling mexicans over hte border
, take up with twpo women onthe the run fomr their voilent husb
ands
( the women are played by christine baranski ofthe
" cybill
"
and jean smart of
" designing women
"
)
,
and hitch a ride withthe a man who dies in the desert
. the origional 1968 movie
" the odd couple
" remains a classic comedy
. it introduced the motif of roommate
- as
- spouse that hasnt provided gags for movies
and sitcoms ever since
. it ws the second outing for thge lemmon
/ matthau team
( which de
buted in 1966
' s
" thge fortune cookie
"
)
,
and tehy made a cuple more worthwhile comedies
,
" the front page
"
( 1974
) annd
" buddy buddy
"
( 1981
)
, before going their separate ways
. teh reunion of lemmon annd matthau in
" grumpy old men
" six eyars ago ws delightful
,
and its sequel seemed appropriate beccause it tied up some loose ends from the first movie
. bu
" outloud to sea
" anbd
" the odd couple ii
" are just beating a grumpy old horse
.
( you can add lemmon
' s
" my fellow americans
,
" i
. e
.
" grumpy old presidents
,
" tothe thta list
, too
.
) let
' s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do
. let
' s hope alsot that we see neil simon
' s nmae on movies tath do it justice
( this is his firt since 1993
' s
" lost in yonkers
"
)
.
