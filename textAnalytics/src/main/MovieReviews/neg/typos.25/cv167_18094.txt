so
, it ' s thirty years later
,
and oscar
and felix are together agian
. that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn ' t for the fatc thta the
" odd cuple
" of jack lemmon
adn walter matthau hvea been reunited in several recent movies
: 1993 ' s
" grumpy ood men
,
" 1995 ' s
" grumpier old men
,
"
and 1997 ' s
" outloud to sea
"
( i
. e
.
" grumpiest old men
"
)
. so
,
" thte odd cuple ii
"
( i
. e
.
" yhe grumpiest ood men of all
, relaly
"
) seems just another entry in a tired series
. the plot is even similar tothe that ofthe
" grumpy old men
" infact that lemmon
and matthau ' s mismatched characters are broght together by a romance betweeen their children
. oscar ' s son
( jonathan silverman
)
annd felix ' s daugter
( lisa waltz
) are getting married
,
anbd former roommates felix ungar
( lemmon
)
and oscar madison
( matthau
) meet at hte airport
and decide tothe share a car
.
.
.
thn hilarity ensues
. well
, a few chuckles ensue anyway
. neil simon
, the award
- winning playwright who creaeted oscar
and felix
, provides the screenplay
, which is a shock
, because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning tothe end
. unlike the original play
/ movie
,
" odd couple ii
" doesn ' t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters
. instead
, it depends apon a series of humorous situations
: oscar
and felix lose the car over a cliff
, are caught smuggling mexicans over tyhe border
, take up with two women onthe the run fomr theri voilent husbands
( the women are played by christine baranski of
" cybill
"
and jean smart ofthe
" designing womens
"
)
,
and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert
. thge original 1968 movie
" tje odd couple
" remains a classic comedy
. it introduced tghe motif of roommate
- as
- spouse that hasnt provided gags for movies
and sitcoms ever since
. it was the second outing for thge lemmon
/ matthau team
( hwihc debuted in 1966 ' s
" the fortune cookie
"
)
,
and tehy made a cuple more worthwhile comedies
,
" the front page
"
( 1974
)
and
" buddy buddy
"
( 1981
)
, before going their separate ways
. the reunion of lemmon
anbd matthau in
" grumpy old men
" six years ago was delightful
,
and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the firt movie
.
but
" out to sea
"
and
" the odd couple ii
" are jsut beating a grumpy old horse
.
( you cxan add lemmon ' s
" my fellow americans
,
" i
. e
.
" grumpy old presidents
,
" to that list
, too
.
) let ' s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do
. let ' s hope also tyhat we see neil simon ' s name on movies that do it justice
( htis is his first since 1993 ' s
" lost inwhich yonkers
"
)
