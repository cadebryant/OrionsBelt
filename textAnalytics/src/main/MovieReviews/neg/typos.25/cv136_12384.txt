" event

. gluttony isnt hollywood
' s favorite sin
, bu it is the movie
- goers who pay tje price by being dealed the same things over
and over on an ever
- worsening basis
.
" lost in spoace
" is the latest such offering
- a film so poor it woudl be twice as good if it were mediocre
. it
' s made up ofthe eveyr element ofthe science fiction
,
but at no tiome does it envoke the slightest amount ofthe wonderment the genre was meaned for
. audiences
' attention spans are rapidly decreasing
and as is the trend with such films
, this one opens wiht a fast
- pased spoace battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene inwhich the film
( probably because it has
" star wars
" written all over it
)
,
but as the producers
' way ofthe showing off their budget through hte spacial effects
. battle scenes are worthless without tension
,
and since we have no idea what the setting is it
' s impossible to care about anytying tath happens
. in essence
, the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game
, not a peice of filmmaking
. we meet the robinson family
- a family ofthe five that does not get allong
but hasnt been choosen to act on earth
' s behalf in efford tothe find anyother planet worthy of colonization due to tje exhausting of our naturual resources
. each memeber ofthe the family has a speshal trait annd personality
,
and
yet none of them seem like actual people
. professor john robinson
( hurt
) is the intelligent
, quiet leader who has devoted so much time tothe his work his famaly
and marriage are suffering without his realizing it
( it
' s obvious what role thsi aspect will play
)
. ofthe course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children
and parents arguing
and bickering among themselves
and iwth each other
, while tghe necessary problems are
" resolved
" at the right moments
. tjhe onyl thing worse than tyhe screenplay is the fact it
' s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire
,
and isnt so pathetic it
' s laughable
. the first ect isnt not a building of a story
,
but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug infront all the requred elements
( such as plot
, conflict
, annd characterization
- god forbid
!
)
. we
' re provded with the minimum amount possibile of these elements to keep the film ffrom being completely silent
. in fatc
, it might as well be since the dialogue isnt virtually non
- existent
. yes
, hte characters do speak
, bu they do not talk
. they say thigns that only relate to the conflict
,
but they never really interact
( unless it
' s the cartoony flirting scenes beween arrogant major don west
( leblanc
)
and uptight
, unemotional judy robinson
( graham
)
)
. it
' s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue
and generic plot devices that so little happens
. eventually tyhe pacing rapidly increases
, bu hte ammount of genuine intrest does not
. the stroy finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themslves lost in spoace after narrowly managing tothe defeat dr
. smith
( oldman
)
, tghe cartoony villain
, adn his plans forthe sabotage
. what ensues is a sories upon series of completly unrelated conflicts
. the first such scene takes palce on an ab
andoned spaceship
and what ensues sould best be described as
" alien
"
- lite
. the story changes again whn the robinsons crash l
and on an alien planet annd must act quickly to escape it
and survive
.
but htere
' s never any rela notion of suspense here because thge script constanly w
anders aimlessly
. plotlines are developed
, bu each becomes totally irrelevant as thte story changes from scenario to scenario
. the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel anbd various time paradoxes
,
but it
' s presented in such a ridiculous way it
' s utterly boring
. by the tiem tyhe last ect rolls around
, ther isnt no sence of a payoff building
. the endig does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax
, instead
, it seems to come to a sudden halt
(
but at least it ends at all
)
.
" lost in space
" is major film production at its worst
. it
' s frightening that a film so poorly written
, directed
,
and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment
.
