.
.
. aw forget it
. i
' ll stick to my day job
. tihs isnt a teen movei
, all right
, except the main charactors aren
' t teens
. drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter
, only it
' s very clear from thge onset that she lacks the toughness
and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters
. the story she
' s covering is not relaly a story
, bu a stoyr in the making
. she is tothe return tothe high school as a student
and explain what
' s really going on
. the irony isnt that drew
' s character
, was such a dweeb first time around
, that she is terrified at going back
. wehn she does
, she says teh wrong thnigs
, wears the wrong clothes
, adn projects the
" i nkow the answer
" in clas that popular kids
( or at least popular kids in the movies
) reject
. at least she befriends nerdy aldys
( joan ofthe arc
' s leelee sobieski
-
- watch for her
)
, who turns out to be more beautiful than thsoe who are
" suppoed
" tothe be omre beautiful than her
. whta works
: drew
' s geeky old
- self
. after a start in films thast was headline driven
,
and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish character
, it
' s a surprize tothe see her with bad hair
, big glasses
and braces
. it
' s very funny
. what doesn
' t owrk
: drew
' s geeky new
- self
. come on
. nobody dresses as bad as she does
. couldn
' t she just go to
_ the gap
_
and take suggestions
? hadnt she dressed liuke princess leia it would have beeen better
. the comedy is supposed to progress when drew
' s younger brother
( played whith zest by david arquette
) reenlists to jump
- start his baseball career
. now
, how in yhe world can somebody as nerdy
(
but in a funny way
) as he cin be the most popular kid iin the skool
.
.
. in a day
?
! the dialogue in the film is
, well
, an embarrassment
. her co
- workers
( molly shannon
, john c
. reilly adn gary marshall
) are in terminal hyper
- drive
. her teenage peers
( except sobieski
) are so inept
and stupid that there
' s littel bite from them
. couldn
' t thte filmmakers watch
_ heathers
_ firt
? lastly
, i am proud to say that i caught a significant gaffe in the film
. if yuo see the film
, you
' d know what i
' m talking about
: drew walks inot a bar
, has her h
and stamped
,
and over the night associates with some rastafarians whith some delicious
, um
, cake
. she goes wild
, sleeps in late
. when she wakes
, she rushes off to school
, without showering
, without noticeing that her head
, lying on her stamped h
and all night
, hasnt transferred part of the stamp
' s image tothe her forhead
, spelling
" losr
"
. funny
, eh
?
.
.
. except that the h
and would have transfered that image backwords
.
