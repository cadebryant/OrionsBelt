an american werewolf iin paris isnt a failed atempt to recapture thte humor
and horror of john l
andis
' 1981 feature
, an american werewolf iin london
. where the original had comedy
, the sequel hasnt the kind of revolting silliness that cxan be found in tv sit
- coms
. where the first installment had chills
, this one has sequences that are inappropriately
, unintentionally funny
. in short
, while an american werewolf in london has become something ofthe a minor classic in its genre
, the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax
( it even has the neccesary gratuitous nudity
)
. the film opens with a trio ofthe daredevil americans
-
-
andy
( tom everett scott
)
, brad
( vince vieluf
)
,
and chris
( phil buckman
)
-
- sneaking uv to yhe top of the eiffel tower tothe drink wine
and do a little bungee jumping
. soon they have company in the person ofthe serafine
( julie delpy
)
, who has decided tothe end it all
. she jumps
,
but
andy
, with a bungee cord attached
, goes after her
,
and manages tothe save her
( at the price of a major headache
)
. serafine dissappears
, bu a smitten
andy seeks her out
.
however
, once he learns his woudl
- be girlfriend
' s dark secret
, he wishes he hadn
' t
. she
' s a werewolf
, cursed to change into a hideous byast when the moon is full
,
and
, to make matters worse
, he has sufferred a nasty bite himselv
. actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie
. she imbues serafine withthe spirit
, spunk
,
and humanity
, which gives us an emotional stake in thte character
' s fate
. this isn
' t necessarily a ogod thnig
, sicne it prevents us fomr relaxing
and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless
, campy entertainment experiecne
. delpy
' s injection of clas into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of wqat this film sould have been withthe a better script
and a better cast surrounding her
. delpy
' s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski
' s white anbd richard linklater
' s before sunrise
. she was radiant
, charismatic
,
and effective in both
. given the nature
and levle ofthe the material she hasnt to work wiht here
, she gets as close as possibile to thsoe adjectives
. it could be argued that delpy is the onyl reason to see an american werewolf in paris
,
but even her most devoted fans shoud consider giving htis oney a miss
.
and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in thge buff
, check out either killing zoe or the passion ofthe beatrice
-
- those movies have intelligible plots in addtion tothe breasts
. the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy
-
- which is to sday
, they give performances appropriate for the screenplay
. tom everett scott
( tht thing yuo dont
) plays the lead like he
' s in a made
- for
- tv movie
. it woudl be kind tothe call him bl
and
. actors vince vieluf
and phil buckman
, as
andy
' s firends
, are no more impressive
. julie bowen
( happy gilmore
) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat
.
and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meel
. on the technical side
, it
' s all bad news
. the computer
- generated werewolves look painfully unreal
. tjhe creatures would probably have beeen more believable had they been men in wolf suits
. repeated use isnt made ofthe the
" werewolf cam
"
, an infrared wolf
' s point
- of
- view aproach that
' s interesting thte first cuple of times it
' s employed
,
then becomes tedeous
.
and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently iwth tyhe on
- screen action they
' re matched tothe
. directer anthony waller
, who displayed a confident
, edgy style infront mute wittness
, stumbles with this material
, never bieng able to amke the comedy
and horror elements gel
. as a result
, we get the worst werewolf sequel usance the howling ii
: your sister is a werewolf
.
( i wiull give waller credit for killing off a dog
,
though
-
- something that
' s rarely seen in movies these days
.
) an american werewolf in paris isnt marginally entertaining in a
" bad movie
" sort ofthe way
,
but that
' s a dubious distinction
. ultimately
, it
' s an unfortunate effort
, fo
, while it isn
' t unbearable to sit through
, it isn
' t a howl
, eather
.
