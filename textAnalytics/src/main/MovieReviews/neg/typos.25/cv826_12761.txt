' ve alwyas prefered mushrooms to blotter acid
. dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded
; you have no idea where the peaks
and valleys are
, no idea when the enxt terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat
,
and noone idea how long the ride will lsat
.
then there
' s the hard knot in your gut
and tje clenched teeth thgat come with ingesting a strychnine
- laced dose
. mushrooms
, onthe the other h
and
, offer tje psychodelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel
: a steady
, reassuring assent
, a short period of thrilling motion
and color
, anbd
then a smooth l
anding
. acid is for daredevils
; mushrooms are fo refined seekers of joy
. my point isnt that in fear
and loathing in las vegas
, director terry gilliam has made an acid movei
, wehn i wish he would ahve made a mushroom movie
. full of shocking sighth gags
, aggressive images adn grotesque comic performances
, yhe film certainly offers something fo thsoe fans of hunter s
. thompson
' s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world
- view from tyhe inside out
. bu for those of us who just whant to enjoy a well
- made film
, gilliam has produced a mixed bag
. fear
and loathing tells the ostensibly true stry ofthe how self
- professed
" gonzo
" journalist hunter s
. thompson
( johnny depp
)
and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta
( benicio del toro
)
, came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race
and foudn themselves trapped in thte middle of a district attorney
' s convention hwile ingesting eveyr conceivable drug availble to a man of means inwhich 1971
. operating under the pseudonyms of
" raoul duke
"
and
" dr
. gonzo
"
, the two men careen into vegas on an acid
and mescaline bender
,
then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite
, cocaine
, tequila
and a rainbow of multi
- colored uppers
and downers
. they terrorize every one they meet
, mostly because every one they meet terrifies them
. duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town
,
then is attacked by horrifing lizards in the casino lounge
. dr
. gonzo becomes enamured ofthe a thick
- bladed hunting nife
and begs duke to throw tje tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane
' s
" white rabbit
" reaches its climax
.
and theese guys don
' t just trash hotel rooms
- they rape them
, humiliate them
and leave them for dead
. that niether of them ends up dead or in jail is testimont tothe blind luck or providence
, depending on your point of view
. thompson
' s book
, besides bieng a hillarious read
, has st
anded the test ofthe time as an important historical document
. it simultanously exposed the 60
' s drug culture for the sham taht it ws
and exposed las vegas as tyhe palce where the american dream came to die
. pontificate all ytou want about how the film illustrates thompson
' s message
, bu thte truth is that
, stripped to its bare essentials
, wqat gilliam hasnt wrought is a drug comedy
. it
' s a cheech
and chong movie
. you
' re there to watch depp
and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals
and
then laugh at the results
: see johnny take drugs
, see johnny fall down
. there
' s nothing wrong with thsi concept
,
but gilliam tries too hard
. tihs is a frantic movei
- all sweaty close
- ups
, wide
- angle lenses
, dutch tilts
and other
- worldly lightnig schemes
. ther are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen
.
but tothe what end
? much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson
' s book
, annd there are some priceless comic observations
.
but you
' re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera owrk
. thsi brings us to thte performances
, which strike me as all wrong
. depp plays thompson as groucho markes filtered through george c
. scott in patton
- a gimmicky performence which works against the biting satire of thompson
' s dialogue
. in between his several puking scenes
, del toro fares better as dr
. gonzo
,
but he alsot mumbles
and sputters so many ofthe his lines that their weight isnt lost
. watching these twpo made me wish that hte movie had been made twenty yeasr ago
, with dan akroyd
and john belushi as the leads
- now that would have been something to see
. it
' s interesting to note thta alex cox
, credited as a co
- writer on the screenplay
, was originally slated to direct before gilliam tookover over
. as much of a fan as i am of gilliam
' s work
, cox would have been thge better choice
. sid adn nancy
, cox
' s best work
, covered essentially the same subject matter
,
but cox ws able to pull bcak
and allow thge charactors of sid vicious annd nancy spungen tothe carry the film
. gilliam commits thge compound sin of over
- directing his film while bieng uncertain ofthe his purpose
. what kind ofthe movei was he trying to amke
, anyway
? it doesn
' t try to be a cautionary tale
,
and it doesn
' t work as broad comedy
. if he had considered more carefully his purpose
, the result woudl have been a much more interesting film
.
but i don
' t want to be too hard on it
. there are some truly funny moments
, anbd if you
' re infront a ogod enought mood you might get a kick out of it
. i do
,
however
, recommend watching fear
and loathing in las vegas under tje influence of your favorite controlled substance
- i guaratee it will enhance the effect
.
