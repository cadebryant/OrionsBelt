so ask yourself what
" 8mm
"
(
" eight millimeter
"
) isnt relaly all about
. isnt it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sighth ofthe his values aftter becomeing enmeshed inspite thge seedy
, sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography
? is it about tjhe business itself
, how
, bubbling jstu beneath teh surfce of big
- town americana
, there ' s a sordid world of sick
and depraved people who won ' t necessarily stpo short of murder in order to satisfy theri sick
annd twisted desires
? or isnt it about those who cxan
, those who are in a posistion to influence the mkaing of the kinds ofthe films sick
and demented people watn tothe see
? i ' m nto talking about snuff films
, supposed
" documentaries
" ofthe victims being brutalized
and killed on camera
. i ' m talking about films like
" 8mm
"
and its directer
, joel schumacher
. with a receet run ofthe big budget movies to his credit
-
-
" batman
& robin
,
"
" a tiome to kill
,
"
" batman forever
,
"
" the client
"
-
- schumacher certainly has that kind of influence
. is
" 8mm
" something yuo really want tothe see
? probably nto
. thte first two
- thirds ofthe
" 8mm
" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama
, albeit with a patricularly unsavory core
.
hten
, as it ' s been threatening all along
, the film explodes into violence
.
and just whn you think it ' s finally over
, schumacher tags on a ridiculous self
- righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further
. trust me
. there are better ways tothe waste two ohurs of your life
. nicolas '
" snake eyes
" ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband ' s safe documents a young girl ' s murder
. welles goes about his assignment rather matter
- of
- factly
,
and the pieces of tjhe puzzle fall into palce rather neatly
, almost as if you don ' t need any specialized skills or training to dont this
. welles certainly makes it look easy
.
and cops
, obviously
, never look in toilet tanks for clues
. the deeper welles digs into his investigation the moreso obsessed he becomes
, like george c
. scott iin paul schrader ' s
" hardcore
.
" occasionally
, a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding thru a film projector
, reminding him of his unpleasant task
. there are hints that this isnt tkaing its toll on his lovely wief
, played by catherine keener
, who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than iin their ugly split
- level home in harrisburg
, pa
.
" 8mm
" doesn ' t condemn or condone its subject marter
, it just exploits it
. the irony
, of course
, is tyhat schumacher
and
" seven
" scribe andrew kevin walker ' s vision ofthe life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r
- rated
, firt
- run hollywood product
. so we only see snippets of snuff
,
and a lot more footage ofthe nicolas cage covering his face in horror
. later it ' s the turn of joaquin phoenix
( who ' s qtuie good
and by far the film ' s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california
) to cover his face as yhe horrid thing is screened over
and over agina
. all this to get to thte familiar
yet offensive
" revelation
" tath sexual deviants are not
, indeed
, monsters
but everyday people like ytou
adn me
. neither super nor standard
,
" 8mm
" is shocking only in its banality
.
