- timne director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie ofthe characters typing at their computers
, he would
. as it is
, he settles for characters talking on yhe phone
. denise calls up isnt a movie forthe
and baout the electronic generation
, where characters are too caught up with their work adn insecurities prefer to live out theri relationships
and fantasies on the phone
. it
' s a satire
-
and a sometimes funny one
- baout how we let h
andphones
, call
- waiting
and answering machines run our lives
. the problem
: denise calls up is a movie about an diea
. a darn good one
,
but still an 80 minute
- long idea
.
and despite salwen
' s attempt at plots
and sub
- plots
, dispite some genuinely funny moments
, you can predict the movie
' s outcome within the frist fifteen mintues
. you get the drift aftter a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldn
' t make it fo a party
- nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film
, tehy owudl rather be talking on hte phone
. here
' s salwen
' s plot
: while all the charactors are iin a disfunctional
, telefixated limbo
, loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant iwth his child
, courtesy of the sperm he donated to teh local bank
. as martin progresses from slamming tghe phone on her tothe long phone conversations over the baby
' s name
, his friends
-
and his friends
' friends
- get involved
, courtesy of call
- waiting
and double
- lines
. in the tigher
and moreso tantalizing sub
- plot
, barbara
and jerry are set up onthe a blind date that neither turns up fo
. both profess to have too complicated schedules tothe ever meet
,
but htey git it goign over the phone
. with repeated phone sex comes a glitch
; what if the other person is simply faking it
? denise calls up scores with soem inspired moments
. mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless
, everyone shares the excitment ofthe denise
' s delivery through a conferance call to her h
andphone
,
and barbara
' s best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend
' s answering machine
.
( as gale
' s overly
- chatty aunt recounts
, her cordless ws knicked inot her ear
and lodged in her brain
.
)
but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie
. the pace sags
, the dialogue drags
and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone
- touters
.
and thge ending is litterally a non
- event as expected
, everyone is too chicken to turn up fo the party frank throws infront gale
' s memmory despite promising over thge phone thast they iwll
. we get the point
. yhe movie appears to be intent onthe flogging its terribly
-
' 90s statement utnil they have it coming out ofthe your ears
. pun intended
. there
' s even a on tjhe movie
' s web site where ytou cxan win cellular phones
( as if we haven
' t hadnt enough of these thnigs already
)
. watch the movie only if you find it philosphy compelling enough for a earful
