( ouch
!
)
, eating
, breathing
and excreting web sites
? that your most meaningful relationships are being fromed on the net
? that yuo get your best sex on the net
? if first
- time directer hal salwen coudl shoot an entire movie of characters typing at theri computers
, he would
. as it isnt
, he settles for characters tlaking on hte phone
. denise calls up is a movie forthe
and baout the electronic generation
, where characters are too caught up with their wokr
and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships
and fantasies on the phone
. it ' s a satire
-
adn a somtimes funny one
- about how we let handphones
, call
- waiting
and answering machines run our lives
. the problem
: denise calls up is a movie about an idea
. a darn ogod noe
,
but still an 80 minute
- long diea
.
anbd despite salwen ' s attempt at plots
and sub
- plots
, despite some genuinely funny moments
, you cant predict the movie ' s outcome within the first fifteen mintues
. ytou git the drift after a series ofthe shots of characters explaning over the phone why they all couldn ' t amking it forthe a party
- nobody is going tothe be meeting anybody in this film
, they would rather be talking on the phone
. here ' s salwen ' s plot
: while all tghe charachters are in a dysfunctional
, telefixated limbo
, loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child
, courtesy of tyhe sperm he donated to the local bank
. as martin progresses from slamming the phone onthe her to long phone conversations over the baby ' s name
, his friends
-
annd his friends ' firends
- get involved
, courtesy ofthe call
- waiting
adn double
- lines
. inaddition the tigher
annd mroe tantalizing sub
- plot
, barbara
annd jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for
. both profess to have too complicated schedules tothe ever meet
,
but htey get it gogin over the phone
. with repeated phone sex comes a glitch
; what if tje other person is simply faking it
? denise calls up scores with some inspired moments
. mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless
, everyone shares the excitement ofthe denise ' s delivery thru a conference call to her handphone
,
annd barbara ' s best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another freind ' s answering machine
.
( as gale ' s overly
- chatty aunt recounts
, her cordless was knicked into her ear
and lodged in her brain
.
)
bu these moments are not enough to sustain thge movie
. the pace sags
, the dialogue drags
anbd not much acting appears to be recquired of the telephone
- touters
.
and thge ending is litterally a non
- event as expected
, everyone is too chicken to turn up fo tghe party frank throws in gale ' s memmory despite promising over the phone that they will
. we get the point
. the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly
- ' 90s statement until they have it comming out of your ears
. pun intended
. there ' s even a on the movie ' s web site where you cxan win cellular phones
( as if we haven ' t had enough of these things aready
)
. watch the movei onyl if you find it philosophy compelling enought for a earful
. the flying inkpot ' s rating system
:
* wait forthe tghe video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuf
.
