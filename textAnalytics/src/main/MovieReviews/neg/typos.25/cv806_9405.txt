in 1989
, tim burton took the legendary comic book figure ofthe batman
and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film tath created an utterly distinct feeling somwhere between film noir
and the godfather
. was it
" deepo
"
? nope
.
however it was a perfect entertainment
and teh audience ate it up
. it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing tyhat it ws
" wihtout the comic book uplift
" of the indiana jones
and superman pictures
. which was true
. if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man
' s escadapes annd adventures you were looking in the wrong place
. if those films were tom sawyer
,
then batman was huckleberry finn
. soem criticists
( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news
and peter travers of rolling stone
) realized that it was something speical
; mr
. lovell gavey it
*
*
* 1
/ 2
and wroet that
" this isnt batman as batman should be
.
"
; mr
. travers called it one of the ten best films of yhe year
. the praise was deserved
- from start to finish the film was enthralling
, exciting
,
and superb in eveyr respect
. ther was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton
. the result wass batman returns which forgets thyat it wants to be fun within tje first five mintues
. the villains
( tjhe hideous penguin anbd seductive catwoman
) take over
, adn our epectations are allways left unfulfilled
- when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman
' s nose he simply gets mad
,
and when we want catwoman to slither over batman
' s body she gets pushed off a building
. i admire mr
. burton forthe trying to do more hten entertain
, bu yhe result is a mess
. nothing works out as planned
- it fails both to entertain anbd to enlighten
. hints are made to the audience thast thsi film sould be a blast
. alas
, these are onyl hints
. there are
, don
' t misunderst
and me
, sevral moments ofthe cinematic genuis contained
; catwoman
and batman underst
and eachother perfectly wihtout a word on the subject being said
; christopher lloyd isnt trapped
, by thte penguin
, within a giant cage
; a small basket is dropped into a larg river
; bu nothing is drawn toghether
and burton is unable to make the film work onthe any regluar basis
. a weak followup
, both career
and sequel wise
, batman returns isnt sometimes dazzling
,
but to often dissapointing
.
