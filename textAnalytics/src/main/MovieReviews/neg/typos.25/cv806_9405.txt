inaddition 1989
, tim burton tookover the legendary comic book figure of batman
annd turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric littel film that creaeted an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir
and hte godfather
. was it
" deep
"
? nope
.
however it was a perfect entertainment
adn the audience ate it up
. it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was
" wihtout the comic book uplift
" of teh indiana jones
and superman picturesk
. whihc ws true
. if what you weere looking for was tje tale of a heroic man ' s escadapes
annd adventures ytou were looking inaddition the wrong place
. if thsoe films weere tom sawyer
,
then batman was huckleberry finn
. smoe critics
( glenn lovell ofthe thte san jose mercury news
and peter travers of rolling stone
) realized that it wass something special
; mr
. lovell gave it
*
*
* 1
/ 2
and wrote that
" this is batman as batman should be
.
"
; mr
. travers called it one ofthe the ten best films of the year
. the praise wass deserved
- from start to finish the film was enthralling
, exciting
,
anbd superb in every respect
. there was no doubt that htere would be a sequal directed by burton
. the result was batman returns which forgets tath it wants to be fun withing the first five minutes
. the villains
( the hideous penguin
and seductive catwoman
) tkae over
,
and our epectations are alwyas left unfulfilled
- when we wanted the penguin tothe bite off batman ' s nose he simpley gets mad
,
and whn we want catwoman to slither over batman ' s body she gets pushed off a building
. i admire mr
. burton for trying to do more
then entertain
,
bu the result is a mess
. nothing works out as planned
- it fails both to entertain
and tothe enlighten
. hints are made tothe the audiance that this film could be a blast
. alas
, these are only hints
. ther are
, don ' t misunderstand me
, several moments ofthe cinematic genuis contained
; catwoman
and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said
; christopher lloyd is trapped
, by tjhe penguin
, within a giant cage
; a small basket is dropped inot a large river
;
but nothing is drawn together
and burton isnt unable to make the film work on any regular basis
. a weak followup
, both career
and sequel wise
, batman returns is sometimes dazzling
,
bu to often dissapointing
.
