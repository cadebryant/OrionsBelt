teh recent onslaught ofthe film noir that has popped up in multiplexes
, whith everything ranging from
" l
. a
. confidential
" to
" palmetto
" tothe
" the big lebowski
,
" hasnt proved to be an artistic commodity fo veteran
, talented directors
. with this particular genre
, directors are able tothe collate tghe sleazy underworld of the lower
- class
and the glamorous
, opulent upper
- class
, while maintaining the noirish
, ambiguous ambience
, the staple ofthe film noir
.
" wild things
" sould be classified as a black comedy
, a sultry film noir or a plain ol
' erotic thriller
, bu the oney category it doesn
' t qualify forthe is that ofthe a qaulity motion picture
. overacted
, overwrought adn overlong
,
" wild things
" is a confused mess
, a movie that wants to haev its cake anbd eat it too
. with its incalculable twists
, turns
, more twists
and more turns
, it soon becomes a tedious exercise infront pointlessness
. in spite of game effords by kevin bacon
and matt dillon
, who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal
,
" wild things
" not once jells infront its eroticism
, unpredictability
, carachter motivation
, sense of the world
, plot
, etc
. ther
' s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical
. directed by john mcnaughton
(
" henry
: protrait ofthe a serial killer
"
)
,
" wild things
" follows sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a hunkish
, suburban florida high school teacher who
' s thge dream of every spruced up female in hte community
. paritcularly oney
. kelly van ryan
( denise richards
) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep iwth a partner
. soon
, her tiny shorts are soaked
and tells the otehr girl to tkae a hike
, enabling her to come into his house
. next hting
, she cries rape
. adn the so
- called
" roller
- coaster ride
" ensues
. a second accuser comes front
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, a booze
- drinkin
'
, tattooed peice of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her
, virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions
, asinine occurrences
and laughable courtroom procedures are bound tothe happen
. even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo
' s zany lawyer
. he wears a fake neck
- brace
, waves the finger at the otehr client anbd infuses the script with soem billy murray
. ytou cant tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role
. as ridiculous as it sounds
, he
' s the most sane charachter in the movei
. thge community is astonished
. reporters flee tothe the scene
. there
' s an 8
. 5
- million settlement for a libel suit against kelly
' s mother
( theresa russell
)
. there
' s the ambiguous cop
( kevin bacon
, who also executive produced
) who sniffs something iffy iin this concoction of deceit
, muder
and lust
. we
, tyhe audeince
, sniff something not so lustful
. like so many thrillers these dyas
, includng
" the usual suspects
" anbd
" the game
,
"
" wild things
" eschews character for plot
. mcnaughton konws how to h
andle thte camera
,
and he keeps the campy fillings ofthe the script flowing wih workmanlike ease
, as if he knows tyhe terriory he
' s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany
" henry
,
" a furious
, unsettling film directorial tour
- de
- force
. george clinton
' s score is a delight tothe behold
.
but it
' s the humans
. the characters are mere devices for the
" nasty
" twists
. what writer stephen peters doesnt not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving
, almost unbearable
, if those who inhibit this twisted world are nto interesting
, don
' t feel real or we don
' t care for them
. not even the unintentionally funny moments work
. tghe people in
" wild things
" are not so much people as they are caricatures
.
then there
' s the erotic content
, which nearly earned tje film an nc
- 17
, for a sexless
, badly edited
, poorly lit menage
- a
- trois
.
and in what hasnt to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes thyat has graced this country
, kevin bacon
' s memeber mkaes a cameo appeareance with ten minutes tothe go
. ironically
, the wildest elements ofthe
" wild things
" are nto wild at all
.
