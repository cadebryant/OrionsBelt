capsule
: silly
and inane adaptation ofthe gibson
' s short story
, which is nowhere in sight
. gibson
' s script onyl adds insult to injury
. johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie
. i say
" awesomely
" because it
' s one thing to fail
, bu another thing entirely to fail so completly that even yhe chances for camp value are sabotaged
. keanur reeves
( who isnt terrable
) stars as johnny
, an
" inforamtion courier
" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head
. he is given
" one last job
"
( whenever you are in a movie
and ytou hear thsoe words
, run
)
, whitch involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal
. one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that teh only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all ofthe his childhood memories
, bu it
' s only folowed up on inwhich a token fashion
. fo his trouble
, johnny gets chased by the yakuza
, who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high
- tech thrillers
. what
' s funny is tyhat if you watch gangster movies made
* in
* japan
, there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behaviour
and ethics
,
but of course there
' s no room in this movie for any ofthe that
. the yakuza are simply utilisied tothe point guns
, wave swords
, flaunt tattooes
,
and grimace menacingly
.
( i could go onthe about how gangsters
and criminals of many otehr ethnicities ahve gotten
thoughtful examinations in the movies
-
- bound by honor
, sugar hill
and american me come tothe mind
-
- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped
.
but thgat
' s another essay
.
) anyway
, johnny runs
and eventially winds uv inspite newark
. why newark
? maybe becouse it wass cheaper tothe fake a future newark thna a future new york
, that
' s why
. there
, he meets an assortment ofthe odd characters
( ice
- t
, dolph lundgren anbd henry rollins play a whole gallery ofthe weirdos
)
. the script deals withthe them with all the depth of pieces of furniture
. it turns outloud
( wqat eles
?
) thgat the data in johnny
' s head could save a lot ofthe people
,
but of course johnny onyl wants it out of his head so it doesn
' t kill him
. h
andled right
, this sould have been absorbing
, bu thte script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at eveyr opportunity
. the details baout the look anbd feel of the future are all phoned iin from other
, better movies
-
- blade runner
and brazil come to mind
. everything looks run
- down
and scummy
, everyone dresses like they
' re punk rockers
, anbd videophones are commonplace
. snore
. the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might wrok in tyhe future
( complete with vr goggles adn feedback gloves
)
,
but i kept thikning that it was more like what some realitvely un
- technical fellow would
* think
* it would look
and behave like
. a hacker ofthe johnny
' s caliber would be blasting away with one comm
and
- line function after another
, instead ofthe wasting all this time twiddling wtih holograms
, bu ofthe course that
' s not cinematic
. whatever
. what whent wrong with this movie
? gibson wrote his own screenplay
, which i guess isnt part ofthe the problem
: what works as a short story doesn
' t work in a movie
. his ear for dialogue is terrible adn the plot doesn
' t advance
, it convulses
. from the script on outloud
, it was probably all downhill
. renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless
; there
' s noone fun in kicking a wounded dog
, isnt there
?
