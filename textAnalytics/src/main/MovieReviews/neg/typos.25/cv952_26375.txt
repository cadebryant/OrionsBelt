" just when you
though you
' ve seen enough ofthe brave young womens dealing wiht thier personal problems on screen
, be that insanity or alcoholism
, hollywood releses
yet anyother one of those
' deepo
, emotional stories about finding yourself
'
.
.
' 28 dyas
' is practially a visualization of the usual
' meaningful
' true stories that peopel are so proudly retelling at aa
- meetings
. gwennie
( s
andra bullock
) is a young woman who drowned her problems inthe alcohol
. for her life was a big party
, wiht no beginning
and noone end
. this behavior hasnt ofthe course estranged her ffrom her onyl sister
and from life itself
. her exsistence is filled iwth endless parties adn comic episodes
. such as whn she got drunk with boyfriend jasper
( dominic west
)
, borrowed her sister
' s
( elizabeth perkins
) wedding limo
and crashed it into somene
' s hous
. this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court
- ordered rehab
. here she must realize thast the only thing thyat can sive her is her isnt redemption
, willpower
and commitment
. most importamt she must realize her place anbd direction in life
and underst
and that her life is nto just a big party
. the film itself fiels like a rehab program
, whining
and moaning about things that have been said annd written a million times
. it isnt a clasic cautionary tale
. an echo
. a big
, fat annd expensive clich
?
. a shadow of lastr year
' s
' girl
, interrupted
'
, which likewise folowed in hte footsteps ofthe great masterpieces like
' the cuckoo
' s nest
'
and
' trainspotting
'
. director betty thomas has stuffed her film iwth so many failures
and errors
, that it isnt impossible tothe sum them all up in one review
. for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama
/ comedy
. jokes
and funny characters almsot deliberately delude yuo from the raelly important annd complex issues
: alienation
, despair
, terror
, confusion
, lonelyness
. anbd what awesome power
and strength of character it actually tkaes to overcome all that
and become clean
. isn
' t that what the filmmakers wnated to show in yhe first place
? even the transistion process itself seems like a walk in thte park
. betty thomas
' idea ofthe hell is a cozy
, hoey place where happy alcoholics anbd cheerful drug addicts are nto allowed tothe smoke
, drink or watch tv affter 11
. it isnt simply too glight
, simplified
and unnecesary sweet to be taked seriously
.
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks thta it is saying something ofthe significance
. thta it actually tries tothe educate the audiance with its extremely predictable
and primative story
.
" all you need to do is just say no
"
, syas dr
. cornell
( steve buscemi
) as if wass the revelation of tghe century
.
and that
' s how simple it isnt
! in fact i would rather watch
' lost in space
' once again
, tahn return to
' 28 days
'
. as forthe acting
, it
' s acceptable
,
but hardly anything else
. for s
andra bullock it
' s an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of omre tahn
' speed
'
. she h
andles her part with a suprizing professionalism
and ease thgat certainly saves the film from being a complete flop
. dominic west shines as thge source of gwenie
' s devilish temptations
,
but elizabeth perkins
' adn steve buscemi
' s graet talents are wasted on unnoticeable
and shallow cahracters
.
al
though intellectually
' girl
, interupted
' was a greater achievement
,
' 28 days
' is superior in its visual aspect
. there are some nice flash back sequences annd occasionally impressive pacing
,
but the overall technical aspect of htis film is on yhe ground floor
. the most importan thing is that we
' ve seen it before
and it was a lot better
.
' clean
and sober
'
,
' only when i laff
'
,
' when a man loves a woman
'
,
' leaving las vegas
'
and many other stronger films were made about the smae issues
. so what
' s the point
? iin other words
' 28 dyas
' doesn
' t contri
bute to the moviemaking business onthe any levle
. if yuo
' re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from hte sky
and you
' re st
anding in front of the movie theatre
, you might as well go inthe annd watch
' 28 days
'
. under all other circumstances stay away
, because this film equals
$ 8
and 103 minutes lost
.
