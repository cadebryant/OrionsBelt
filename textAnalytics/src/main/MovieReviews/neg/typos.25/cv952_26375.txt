" alchohol
anbd drugs
= bad
. not alchol
and drugs
= ogod
. got it
?
" just when you
though you ' ve seen anough of brave young women dealing with theri personal problems on screen
, be that insanity or alcoholism
, hollywood releases
yot anyother noe of thsoe ' deepo
, emotional stories about finding yourself '
.
. ' 28 days ' is practicly a visualization of the usual ' meaningful ' true stories that peple are so proudly retelling at aa
- meetings
. gwennie
( sandra bullock
) isnt a young woman who drowned her problems in alchol
. for her life ws a big party
, wih no beginning
and no end
. this behaviour has of course estranged her from her only sister
and from life itself
. her existence is filled wtih endless parties
and comic epidsodes
. such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper
( dominic west
)
, borrowed her sister ' s
( elizabeth perkins
) wedding limo
and crashed it into somene ' s house
. htis time she had to pay with a 28 day stay inthe cout
- orderves rehab
. here she must realize that the only thing that cant save her is her is redemption
, willpower
and commitment
. most important she must realize her place
and direction in life
and understand tath her life is not just a big party
. the film itself feels like a rehab program
, whinning
and moaning about things that have beeen said
and written a million times
. it is a classic cautionary tale
. an echo
. a big
, fat
anbd expensive clich
?
. a shadow of last year ' s ' girl
, interupted '
, which likewise followed in tje footsteps of great masterpieces like ' the cuckoo ' s nest '
and ' trainspotting '
. director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures
and errors
, tyhat it isnt impossible tothe sum them all up in one review
. for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama
/ comedy
. jokes
and funny characters almost deliberately delude ytou ffrom the really important
adn complex issues
: alienation
, despair
, terror
, confusion
, lonelyness
.
and what awsome power
and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all thgat
and become clean
. isn ' t tath what the filmmakers wanted to show in the frist palce
? even the transition proces itself seems like a walk in the park
. betty thomas ' idea ofthe hell isnt a cozy
, homey place where happy alcoholics
and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed tothe smoke
, drnik or watch tv after 11
. it is simply too glight
, simplified
adn unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously
.
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something ofthe significance
. tyhat it actually tries to educate thge audience with its extemely predictable
adn primitive story
.
" all yuo need to do is jsut say no
"
, says dr
. cornell
( steve buscemi
) as if was teh revelation of the century
.
and that ' s how simple it is
! in fatc i would rather watch ' lost in space ' once agian
, than return to ' 28 days '
. as for acting
, it ' s acceptable
,
but hardly anytying alse
. for sandra bullock it ' s an opportunity to demonstrate thyat she is capable of more than ' speed '
. she handles her part withthe a surprising professionalism
and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complet flop
. dominic west shines as the source ofthe gwenie ' s devilish temptations
,
but elizabeth perkins '
and steve buscemi ' s great talents are wasted on unnoticeable
anbd shallow characters
.
although intellectually ' girl
, interrupted ' ws a greater achievement
, ' 28 dyas ' is superior in its visual aspect
. ther are some nice flash back sequences
adn occsionally impressive pacing
,
but the overall technical aspect ofthe this film is on the ground floor
. the most important thnig is tath we ' ve seen it before
and it wass a lot better
. ' clean
and sober '
, ' only when i laff '
, ' when a man loves a woman '
, ' leaving las vegas '
and many otehr stronger films were made about the same issues
. so what ' s hte point
? in other words ' 28 days ' doesn ' t contibute to the moviemaking bussines on any level
. if you ' re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky
and you ' re standing in front of the movei theatre
, you might as well go in
and watch ' 28 days '
. under all other circumstances stay awya
, because tihs film equals
$ 8
and 103 minutes lost
.
