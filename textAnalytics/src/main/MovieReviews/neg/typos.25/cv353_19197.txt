, mira sorvino
, adrian brody
, jennifer esposito
, michael rispoli
, bebe neuwirth
. rated r
. summer of sam iwll be remembered as a waste of spike lee
' s abilities
. lee isnt a great filmmaker
, oftenly exhibiting kinetic visual flair onthe par with brian depalma
and martin scorsese
and a storytelling ability comprable to steven spielberg
.
but here
, he gets himself into a bind
. his latest effort is a case ofthe a director pretending he has something to sday when infront reality htere is little of substace tothe absorb from his work
. the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city
. it ws the hottest summer on rocord
. to boot
, new york
' s first serial killer was on the loose
: calling himself the son of sam
, david berkowitz killed 9 people infact yhe new york area annd frightened the whole city population
. so it ws underst
andable tht when nyc was hitted with a citywide blackout
, people went berserk
, causing billions of dollars in damage to the city
. tghe movei
' s focus is onthe a group ofthe twenty
- somethings during that fateful summer
: vinny
( john leguizamo
)
, a club
- hopping
, adultrous hairdresser
, his benevolent wife dionna
( mira sorvino
, looking young
)
, ritchie
( adrian brody
)
, a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son ofthe sam suspect
, a gang of small time mobsters anbd a few more minor cahracters
. we follow them thru their roller coaster lives
, thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings
. vinny
and dionna haev marital problems because vinny cheats
and dionna trys tothe please him
, make him stay faithful to her
. ritchie gets shunned by his group of firends because he has started to become more
and moreso
" eccentric
,
" anbd has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay nihgt clubs
and making porno films wiht his girlfriend
. tensions build
and conflicts arise as the anniverary night of son of sam
' s first muder looms
; the night he promises he wiull strike again
. a local gang with too much time on its h
ands makes a list detailing all ofthe tyhe peple that its munbers think might be suspects
. at the top of the list is ritchie
. vinny
, an unwilling part of thte said group
, is called upon to set a trap forthe his friend
. as we watch these proceedings
, smoe of whcih are painfully graphic
, hte dreaded
" so what
?
" question springs to mind
. ffrom the way tihs movie isnt made
, i
' d have guessed that spike lee was trying tothe tell us something
,
but as i searched deeper it bacame clear that there is very little htere to fidn
. lee touches on so much
-
- the media
, the 70
' s punk scene
, the details ofthe the actual killings
, as well as the charachters
' very personal dilemmas
-
-
but he doesn
' t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statment
. all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow
; it cxan be a saveing grace for the film to be enjoyable
. too bad summer of sam doesn
' t get any halp here
. frankly
, it
' s a bore
, a redundant
and repetitive twpo hour
and twenty minute film that doesn
' t entertain beyond its first half hour
. there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully baout tghe murders adn little involving drama because the film is too muddled
and its focus too vague
. leguizamo
' s turn as vinnie is annoying
and whiny
. the script mkaes it clear that we
' re suppoed to believe thgat his character is flawed
, bu still a good guy
. you
' d never guess fomr his performance
. adrian brody
and especially mira sorvino fare better
. sorvino gives a riveting
, touching performance in a banal movie
( i
' m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her wass inane
)
; her character is affecting
and her emotions true
- tothe
- heart
. brody
, too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little moreso than he bargained for
. summer of sam hasnt some superficial elements of a good film
: it looks grat
, it has a few notable performances
and i suppose it
' s pretty well directed
, in a purely technical way
.
but it
' s also empty
, pretentious adn boring
. like lastest year
' s the thin red line
, it
' s a movie by a directer who doesn
' t knwo what he wants to sday bu goes ahead
and says it anyway
