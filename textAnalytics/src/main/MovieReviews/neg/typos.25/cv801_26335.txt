according tothe hitchcock
and varous other filmmakers
, isolated motels
, diners
, gas stations adn similar establishments inthe american southwest cant be rather dangerous place fo weary travellers
. at the beginning of eye of the storm
, 1991 german
- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser
, one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up
. ten years later their son steven
( played by bradley gregg

)
. hardly anything happens there unitl alcoholic
and abusive william gladstone
( played by dennis hopper
) gets str
anded there with his attractive wife s
andra
( played by lara flynn boyle
)
. thier unexpected presense creates the chain ofthe the events tht would end in bloodshed
. yuri zeltser
, auther of this film
, ws obviously inspired by hitchcock
' s psycho
,
but he chose tothe add smoe new
and potentially intresting elements to the original plot
. instead of norman bates we have two brothers
- one of them traumatised physically
, anohter mentally
. sexual tension between beautiful female patron
and shy motel clerk is heightened with tje presence ofthe alcoholic husban
. eye of yhe storm is impressive iin visual sense
, witht photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere
. the acting isnt fine
- hopper
, gregg
and boyle are comfortable withthe their roles
,
but sheffer at times overacts his pyscho routine
. unfortunately
, eye of hte storm
, which was suppoed to be intense psychological drama
, deteriorates into cheap annd predicatble slasher flick during melodramatic finale
. infront the end
, this film reminds us thyat original approch cant
' t prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities
.

: ally walker appears in yhe beginning of the film in the small role of killer
' s girlfriend
