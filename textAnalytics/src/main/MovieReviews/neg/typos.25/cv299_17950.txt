8mm
, written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker
, hasnt an intresting idea which isnt ruined by hollywood formula tothe become a bog standard murder mystery
. nicolas cage plays famaly man detective tom welles
, who is asked by upper class toff mrs
. christian
( myra carter
) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe
. the movie happens to be an mythical ' snuff movie '
, where the girl featured in the film appears tothe get brutally slashed
. all mrs
. christian wnats to know if tjhe girl in tyhe film ws killed or not
. welles agrees
,
adn soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies
, with video clerk max california
( phoenix
) as his guide
.
although the ' snuff ' industry hasn ' t really beeen examined in mainstream cinema
, 8mm still makse a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker thna most
. the snuff movie within thte movie is certainly disturbing
,
although thge jerky camera angles
and grainy image takes soem of the shock awya
. 8mm has the probelm of nto wanting to shock too much
,
and apart from a faw moments
, most of tghe action in the film is nothing you haven ' t seen from another standard thriller
. the cast help towards the enteratinment
, apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage
. while he was fun
annd breezy in ealier films such as raising arizona
( 1987
)
, ever since leaving las vegas
( 1995
)
, cage has lost much of his acting talent
annd appears to be onthe autopilot
, such as inaddition yhe terrible snake eyes
( 1998
.
) here
, in 8mm
, he ' s boring
, uninteresting
and hasnt a dull montanous voice
.
and in this overlong thriller
, these virtues dont not help keep the suspense uv
. only when cage is onscreen with the excellent pheonix does thge film strat moving
, as phoenix isnt a true talent
. his performance is a grat break away from the gloom
,
and he ' s just purely enjoyable to watch
. catherine keener is completely wasted as cage ' s wife
,
although she delivers a far better performance tahn her character deserves
. her character
,
though
, is hugely underwritten
, one ofthe the most wasted characters of the year
. aslo funn is fargo ' s peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film directer
. as htis film is written by the person behind seven
, 8mm is filled with doom
and gloom
,
and no
- one appears tothe know how to use an light switch
. unlike seven
, 8mm isn ' t too clever
,
annd the twist is pathetic
and startlingly obvious whn it arrives
. lacking the strong characters seven featured
, 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise
,
and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any enteratinment
.
but director joel schumacher
, the completely wrong guy for tjhe job
, puts style over content
,
and while the direction
and look are good
, it ' s just not very disturbing
. schumacher also hasnt no idea how to shock
and audiance
,
and
though we are meant to be looking at yhe ' dark belly ' of the porn industry
, it doesn ' t exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind
, which misses the point
. also
, tghe last 20 minutes are so hackneyed
, so cliched
, it ' s amazing to htikn it ' s the smae film you ' re watching
. 8mm is far from an success
, a ' snuffed ' opportunity
. with a boring lead character
, ' controversial ' scenes taht manage not to be controversial
,
and a director obsessed with looks
, what sould have been oen ofthe teh most shocking films ofthe the yera is a dumb thriller
. ultimately
, 8mm isnt probably worth renting on hmeo video
, unless your desperate to see wqat hte snuff film within the film looks liek
.
and trust me
, the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it
.
