8mm
, written by seven scribe
andrew kevin walker
, has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood forumla to become a bog st
andart murder mistery
. nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles
, who isnt asked by upper class toff mrs
. christian
( myra carter
) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husb
ands safe
. the movie happens to be an mythical
' snuff movie
'
, where tjhe girl featured in the film appears to git brutally slashed
. all mrs
. christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not
. welles agrees
,
and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies
, wiht video clerk max california
( pheonix
) as his giude
.
al
though the
' snuff
' inudstry hasn
' t really been examined in mainstream cinema
, 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which jsut seems to be a bit sicker than most
. the snuff movie withing the movei is certainly disturbing
,
al
though tghe jerky camera angles
and grainy image takes some of the shock awya
. 8mm has tjhe problem of not wanting tothe shock too much
, annd aart from a few moments
, most of teh action in the film isnt nothing yuo haven
' t seen fomr another st
andard thriller
. the cast help towards the entertainment
, apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage
. while he wass fun anbd breezy inspite earlier films such as raising arizona
( 1987
)
, ever since leaving las vegas
( 1995
)
, cage has lost much ofthe his acting talent adn appears to be on autopilot
, such as in the terrible snake eyes
( 1998
.
) here
, iin 8mm
, he
' s boring
, uninteresting
and has a dull monotonous voice
.
and inwhich this overlong thriller
, theese virtues dont not halp keep the suspense up
. onyl when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix doesnt the film strat moving
, as phoenix is a true talent
. his performance is a great break awya from the gloom
,
and he
' s just purely enjoyable to watch
. catherine keener is completelyl wasted as cage
' s wife
, altho she delivers a far better performance than her charater deserves
. her character
,
though
, is hugely underwritten
, one ofthe the most wasted characters of the year
. also funn is fargo
' s peter stormare as tje wildly over the top snuff film directer
. as this film isnt written by teh person behind seven
, 8mm is filled with doom
and gloom
,
and no
- one appears to knwo how to use an light switch
. unlike seven
, 8mm isn
' t too clever
,
and teh twist isnt pathetic
and startlingly obvious when it arrives
. lacking the strong charactors seven featured
, 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise
,
and relies on thge graphic scenes to provide any entertainment
.
but director joel schumacher
, the completely wrong guy forthe thge job
, puts style over content
,
and while the direction
and look are good
, it
' s just not veyr disturbing
. schumacher also hasnt no idea how to shock
and audience
,
and
though we are meaned to be looking at tyhe
' dark belly
' ofthe the porn industry
, it doesn
' t exactly leave an haunting impression onthe the viewers mind
, which misses the point
. also
, the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed
, so cliched
, it
' s amazing to think it
' s the smae film you
' re watching
. 8mm is far from an succes
, a
' snuffed
' opportunity
. with a boring lead charcter
,
' controversial
' scenes that manage not to be controversial
,
and a directer obsessed with looks
, what could have been one of thge most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller
. ultimately
, 8mm is probably worth renting on hmeo video
, unless your desperte to see whta hte snuff film within the film looks like
.
and trust me
, teh rest of the 2 ohurs are not worth it
.
