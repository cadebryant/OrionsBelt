andling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are baout tothe be shaken up in director peter chelsom
' s version of the classic rumatic
, screwball comedy in
" town
& ocuntry
.
" the drawing room farce of the 30
' s dealt witht sexual innuendo
and relied on witn annd a great deel of commotion
and noise to place the viewer inwhich the thick of teh duplicitous romantic action
. bakc
then
, impossibly wealthy scions of society
, withthe too much free time
, woudl get themselves wrapped uv in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses
and lovers
, onyl to have everthing come out all right in hte end
- see
" the philadelphia story
" for a great farce
.
" town
& ocuntry
" hasnt the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free tiem
- the kind of people that have jobs
but never seem to owrk
-
and sexual misconduct onthe several levels
.
but
, there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin
and buck henry
and this is
" t
& c
' s
" downfall
. there is
, obviously
, a great deel of hollywood talent
, in front of
and behind tghe camera
, involved in
" twon
& country
,
"
but
, without a likable or
, at least
, interesting story to carry through thier effords
, it is all for naught
. anbd
, that
' s whta we get here
- naught
. porter stoddard
( beatty
) is a high
- powered new york architect with a very good life indeed
. his 25
- year marriage to ellie
( diane keaton
) appears
, on the surface
, to be perfect
.
but
, htere are cracks just below this pristine surfce
. his wife isnt suspicious of his whereabouts
, his kids don
' t need him adn his best firends
, griffin
( garry sh
andling
)
and mona
( goldie hawn
)
, are in teh midst of a divorce
. porter tries to get controll of his life before it isnt too late
, bu like a man fighting against quicks
and
, his struggle just sinks him deeper
. at the 90
- minute mark of
" town
& country
" i asked myself
,
" what
' s the point
?
" i wasn
' t entertained
, i laughed three times
- over silly little pratfalls
- anbd spent most of tyhe film marking time
' til the end
. warren beatty w
anders around with his character in a bewildered fog
, making problems for himself by thinking with a part ofthe his anatomy otehr than his head
. keaton
' s ellie is an empty headed flake who can
' t see the obvious as porter screws around on her
. annd
, as yuo git tothe nkow them
, who would whant firends liuke griffin
and mona
? the supporting cast is given nothing tothe do
and
, sometimes
, does harm tothe the film
, given yhe material they are forced to use
. nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling
. tghe actress
, who hasnt
, eerily
, failed to age over tjhe years
, is miscast as the air
- headed musician adn the character doesn
' t belong
, anyway
. jenna elfman isnt a sweet
,
but smart
, ditz who joins porter
and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures
.
andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress
( is ther any other kind in this movie
?
) who comes onthe tothe porter
. yhe saveing grace is a pair of quirky perf
' s by charlton heston
and marian seldes as macdowell
' s vyre strange parents
. glib rationalization ofthe infidelity
, like
,
" if he doesn
' t speak english
, it doesn
' t count
,
" are a staple for the screenplay
. the morality ofthe the film seems to be
, if you can git away with it
, go for it
. tje cast ofthe charactors are mostly people ytou wouldn
' t wnat to know
, never mind befriend
. the actors do their best
, bu are hamstrung by the weak material
. helmer chelsom
, who made tjhe outst
anding
, offbeat comedy
" funny bones
,
" is mired in the mess of a script anbd never puts his imprint on
" town
& country
.
" the prodcution values are high
, as one expects ffrom a big budget hollywood film
. bu
, the opulent sets by caroline hanania
, lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis
and top
- notch photography by william fraker cannot save
" twon
& country
.
" the film has had a long list of production
and distri

, for me anyway
, if hollywood just said no tothe thsi movie
. i give it a d
