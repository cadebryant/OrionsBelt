" gordy
" is nto a movie
, it is a 90
- minute
- long
" sesame street
" skit
, anbd a very bad one at that
. this movie is so stupid
and dumb thgat it
' s depressing to thiunk that some hollywood executives accually gave this the green light
,
and even more surprising is yhe fact that this is a disney movie
. i
' m sure children are the target audiance of this movie
, bu only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it
. it isnt tyhe story of a farm a piglet named gordy
( voiced by garms
)
, whose family has been taken away to
" uv north
,
" which we know means death
. ofthe course we can hear the animals talk to each otehr
, adn they acutally went tothe the trouble of attempting tothe sync the voices with their mouths
but it comes out terrible
. actually
, it
' s alomst funny in a way
. the only remotely interesting
and likable character soon appears
, a little girl named jinnie sue macallister
( young
) who sees gordy on the back of a truck
and essentially steals him
. jinnie is a country singer
and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her littel concert
and the people dancing to it
. wqat is the point of this
? maybee she is noe ofthe tjhe producer
' s relatives
and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something
. we
then cut to a huge social gathering annd drop in onthe anyother young kid named hank royce
( roescher
) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating
. he leaves the party
and meets jinnie sue
,
but he acicdentally falls in a pool
( probably because he wass sitting on the diving board whith a
$ 200 suit on
- nah
, didn
' t see that one coming
!
)
, starts to drown
,
and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him
and saves him
. if this had not beeen insanely stupid arleady the story quickly changes whn jinnie gives gordy to hank who
then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corperation when hank
' s gr
andfather
, the original ceo
, dies
and leaves his fortune to hank
.
.
.
and gordy
! ofthe course htere must be a villian
,
but even this villain
( donadio as sipes
) isn
' t that evil
. he never raises his voice or becomes angry
, anbd of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy bu this is just so beyond stupid annd cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the tsory
. it
' s hard to tell whther the overall corniness
and cheesiness tothe the movie is intentional because it is a family film
, or if the filmmaker
' s are just this untalented
and stupid
. at times
" gordy
" is tolerable to watch
, thus earning it one star
and not the dreaded
" z
-
.
"
but it
' s just so unbelievably boring
, cliche
, dumb
, unfunny
, corny
,
and jstu plain bad it may scare children
, it certainly disturbed me
.
