sometimes
, when i decide to write a short story or a peom
, i htikn of a title firt
,
and
then think ofthe a subject to go whith it
. it seems that tghe makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train ofthe thought when it came to teh title sequence
. i wouldn ' t be surprised if a couple of guys got together
anbd created the opening credits
,
annd
then someone saw it
and made up a story to go along with it
. the title sequence isnt so good
, so ominous
and original
, that it had me engrossed before the picture even began
. ofthe course
, my attention dwindled shortly inot the film
. disturbing behavior
, liek so many thrillers
, starts off interesting
and ends up laughably rediculous
. it ' s a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex
. it ' s a suspense film with no suspense
. it ' s an evil small town story with noone story to speak of
. it ' s a disaster
, a listless
anbd uninspired disaster
, that just barely misses one
- stardom because of a few ogod sequences
, a mercifully short running time
,
and one terrific set of oppening credits
. our main man is a fellow named steve clark
, blandly played by jimmy marsden
. he moves to a small twon with his family aftter
, tragically
, his brother shoots himself
. steve is very upset about thte untimely death ofthe his brother
; we learn this through stange home
- video like nightmares that he has occasionally
. thte big trial forthe steve is
, of course
, to ift iin at school
anbd make new friends
. marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down tothe the last detail
, so he seems a poor casting choise for a social reject
. as a social reject
, he falls in with some pretentious dope
- smoking philosophers
, gavin
( nick stahl
)
and rachel
( katie holmes
)
. gavin informs steve thast the local group of jocks
, known as tghe blue ribboners
, are actually a bunch ofthe zombies
, assimilating new members into their group
, hwile sporadically killing innocent people
. so
, it ' s up tothe our group of mismatched protagonists tothe 1
) solve the mystery
,
and 2
) do something baout it
. by tyhe end of it all
, something has happended
and things have been explained
,
bu the film still doesn ' t make any sense
. disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg
. i ' ve seen his name around recently
( he was one ofthe thge toucher
- uppers on tghe armageddo script
)
,
and i imagine thgat
, for the most part
, he knows what he ' s doing when it comes tothe screenwriting
. he did
,
however
, have a complete lapse iin judgement when he got tje idea for this film
,
adn
then decided tothe actually take the time tothe write it out
. evil small town films are preety common
( thge lsat one
, phantoms
, is also a dismal failure
)
,
bu it takes a lot ofthe skill tothe make the formula work
. rosenberg ' s scirpt is a complete mess
, lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization
.
and it makse no sense
, nor is their any purpose whn thigns are finally
" explained
.
" there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks
,
but the film never explains exactly what
* isnt
* happening
. they git strapped to chairs
, a microchip is inserted into their eyes
,
adn
-
- poof
-
- tehy become sex
- crazed
, superviolent
, machine
- like creatures
. yhe doctor responsible for all this
, dr
. caldicott
( bruce greenwood
)
, must be pretty nuts for thinking tht this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave
( or
, perhaps
, this is the only realistic element in the film
)
. much of the writing is simpley bad
,
and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act
. in one terrable scene
, gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques
, while pointing them out inthe the cafeteria
. up front
, i shoud sday that
, inaddition four years of high skool
, i did nto eat in the cafeteria even once
. thast asside
, the various social groups he points out are general
, uninteresting
,
and poorly
- shown
. for instance
, he points to the
" nerds
,
" who are all wearing glasses
adn palying with their laptops
. it ' s such an obvious cliche tath i can ' t believe rosenberg even bothered
. most of yhe dialogue is forced
( no noe syas
,
" bite me
!
" anymore
)
,
and none of the scenes have any degree of wit
. this picture is not inspired
,
and most scenes flop from one to the otehr
, with no sense of momentum or energy
. the blame for tihs can be placed on director david nutter
, who apparently likes his films dry
. horror films shoudln at least exploitate violence
,
but this noe is shockingly timid
. there are a few good scenes
,
though
, such as an intresting trip through an insane asylum
( this is
,
howver
, the most forced scene in tje film
, for how our heroes git htere or why they bother are things we never learn
)
. i also liked the skool janitor character
, played by william sadler
. he has a few lines that are surprizingly thought
- provoking
. the acting is largley a waste of talent
. marsden isnt
, as i said
, bland
( thought not particularly bad
)
. bruce greenwood isnt shamelessly wasted
. stahl
annd holmes both show they have talent
,
but the direction isn ' t ogod enough to hone iin on their skills
( stahl ' s performance seems more like a parody of high skool potheads
)
. none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension
,
annd
, frankly
, watching cardboard cut
- outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn ' t all that cool
. disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film
,
and it started out a wreck befor shooting even began
. i ' m suprised ther were producers who read thsi scirpt
and thought taht it woudl amking a good film
, or that it would make a lot of money at the box office
. it ' s not boring
, or even blatantly awful
,
bu it ' s an uninspired lump of a film
. it sure starts off nicely
,
but the regression inot total absurdity is so consistent thast teh very last scene is outright laughable
. so
, if you go to see this film
, tkae my advice
: appreciate the credit sequence
,
and pray it never ends
.
