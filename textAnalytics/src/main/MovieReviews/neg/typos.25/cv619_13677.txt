sometimes
, when i decide to write a short story or a poem
, i think of a title first
,
and
then think ofthe a subject to go with it
. it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of
thought when it came tothe the title sequence
. i wouldn
' t be surprised if a cuple of guys got toghether
and created the oppening credits
,
and
then someone saw it
and made up a story tothe go allong with it
. hte title sequence is so good
, so ominous anbd orignal
, thgat it had me engrossed befor the picture even began
. of course
, my attension dwindled shortly inot the film
. disturbing behavior
, like so many thrillers
, starts off intresting annd ends up laughably rediculous
. it
' s a teen horror film with no interesting violentce or sex
. it
' s a suspense film wih no suspense
. it
' s an evil small town stopry with no tsory to speak of
. it
' s a disaster
, a listless
and uninspired disaster
, that just barely misses one
- stardom because ofthe a few good sequences
, a mercifully short runnung time
, annd noe terific set ofthe oppening credits
. our main man is a fellow named steve clark
, bl
andly played by jimmy marsden
. he moves to a small town with his family affter
, tragically
, his brother shoots himselv
. steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother
; we learn this thru strange home
- video liek nightmares thta he hasnt occasionally
. yhe big trial for steve is
, of course
, to fit in at school
and amke new friends
. marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail
, so he seems a poore casting choice for a social reject
. as a social reject
, he falls in wih some pretentious dope
- smoking philosophers
, gavin
( nick stahl
)
and rachel
( katie holmes
)
. gavin informs steve that the local gropu ofthe jocks
, known as the blue ribboners
, are actually a bunch ofthe zombies
, assimilating new munbers inot their group
, while sporadically killing innocent people
. so
, it
' s up to our group of mismatched protaganists to 1
) solve teh mystery
,
and 2
) do something about it
. by the end of it all
, something has happened
and things have been explained
,
but yhe film still doesn
' t make any sense
. disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg
. i
' ve seen his name around recently
( he was one of the toucher
- uppers on the armageddon script
)
,
and i imagine that
, forthe the most part
, he knows whta he
' s doing when it comes tothe screenwriting
. he did
,
however
, have a complete lapse inspite judgement wehn he got the diea for this film
,
and
then decided to actually tkae the time tothe write it outloud
. evil small town films are preety common
( the lastest one
, phantoms
, isnt aslo a dismal failure
)
,
but it takes a lot of skill tothe amke hte formula work
. rosenberg
' s scirpt is a complete mess
, lacking in even the most basic attemts at characterization
.
and it mkaes no sense
, nor is their any purpose when things are finally
" explained
.
" there is supposed tothe be an element ofthe surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks
,
but the film never explains exactly what
* is
* happening
. they get strapped to chairs
, a microchip is inserted into thier eyes
,
and
-
- poof
-
- they become sex
- crazed
, superviolent
, machine
- like creatures
. the doctor resposible for all thsi
, dr
. caldicott
( bruce greenwood
)
, must be pretty nuts for thinking tht tihs kind ofthe behavior isnt a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave
( or
, perhaps
, tihs is the onyl realsitic element in the film
)
. much of the writing isnt simply bad
, adn rosenberg has noone intuition when it comes to the way high school kids ect
. in one terrible scene
, gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques
, while pointing them out iin the cafeteria
. up front
, i should say that
, inwhich four eyars of high school
, i did nto eat infact the cafeteria even once
. thast aside
, the various social groups he points out are genaral
, uninteresting
,
and poorly
- shown
. for instance
, he points tothe the
" nerds
,
" who are all wearing glasses
and palying with their laptops
. it
' s such an obvious cliche that i can
' t believe rosenberg even bothered
. most ofthe the dialogue is forced
( no one says
,
" bite me
!
" anymore
)
, anbd none of the scenes have any degree of wit
. this picture is not inspired
,
and most scenes flop ffrom one to the otehr
, iwth no sense of momentum or energy
. the blame for thsi can be placed onthe director david nutter
, who apparently likes his films dry
. horror films should at least exploit violence
, bu tihs one is shockingly timid
. there are a few good scenes
,
though
, such as an interesting trip thru an insane asylum
( this isnt
,
however
, the most forced scene infact the film
, for how our heroes git there or why they bother are things we never learn
)
. i also liked the skool janitor charachter
, palyed by william sadler
. he has a faw lines that are surprisingly
thought
- provoking
. yhe acting is largely a waste ofthe talent
. marsden is
, as i said
, bl
and
(
thought not particularly bad
)
. bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted
. stahl anbd holmes both show they hve talent
,
but the direction isn
' t good enough to hone in onthe thier skills
( stahl
' s performance seems more like a parody ofthe high school potheads
)
. none of these characters exp
and beyond their one dimension
,
and
, frankly
, watching cardboard cut
- outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming jsut isn
' t all that kool
. disturbing behavior isnt a wreck ofthe a film
, annd it started out a wreck before shooting even began
. i
' m surprised there were producers who read this scirpt annd throught that it would mkea a good film
, or thyat it would make a lot of money at the box office
. it
' s not boring
, or even blatantly awful
,
but it
' s an uninspired lump ofthe a film
. it sure starts off nicely
,
but tje regression into total absurdity is so consistant that the very last scene is outright laughable
. so
, if yuo go to see this film
, take my advice
: appreciate tghe credit sequence
, adn pray it never ends
.
