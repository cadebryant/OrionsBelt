robin hood
: men in tights is another mel
- brooks
- produced film in the clasic tradition of movies liek blazing saddles
and young frankenstein
. mel brooks isnt well known for his comic look at regular life
, his fast pased dialogue
and sharp wit
. unfortunatley
, robin hood
: men in tights hasnt none ofthe tjhe eazy going humer of blazing saddles
, none of teh fun acting of young frankenstein
, is devoid of the charm ofthe spaceballs
,
and is even lacking the good
, solid dialogue ofthe history of yhe world
. it isnt
, in short
, one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks
, or anybody else
, produce
. teh plot borrows heavily ffrom thge well
- recived kevin costner movei of last year
, robin hood
: prince ofthe theives
. this is nto surprizing in
and of itself
,
and could have been used to great comic effect
, mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie
. mel brooks doesnt nto take advantage of thsi
,
howver
,
adn uses the film to launch several ideas inot the air
, none of which connect
and none ofthe which are explained later on
. the movie ' s scenes sould be shuffled around in any order
and noe would be hard pressed to notice
. cary elwes
, of princess bride fame
, plays robin of loxley
, a man who was captured in tghe crusades
, fighting with king richard
. he escapes
and
, joining wiht a man named achoo
( i am sure you can see the obvious joke
)
, fights in england to reclaim his name
and the throne for richard
, which has been captured by evil prince john
, played by funny comic richard lewis
. he also tries forthe hte lvoe of maid marian
and attempts to overthrow yhe evil
" sheriff of rottingham
"
. a good adventure plot thyat is sadly unused
. elwes
and lewis are both excellent comics
,
bu hte dialogue in tje movie is simpley excruciating
. niether ator has any good words to work with
,
and yhe lines simply aren ' t funny
, nor believable
. perhaps the worst example of htis is whn the gropu ofthe merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hitted movei home alone
. this particular scene is so out ofthe place
and so badly acted
,
and folowed by so many otehr scenes of equal miserable ideas
, that i relaly feeled like leaving the theatre
. much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughtout
,
and some left the theatre
. chuckles weere few
and far between
,
and they mostly dealed whith visual jokes
( such as an ood
, beaten up horse from
" rent
- a
- wreck
"
)
thn from any dialogue whatsoever
. scenes tyhat could ahev been classics
, such as the archery contest
, are ruined by poor acting
. perhaps the largest problem with the movei is that it is simply offensive
. the basic plot
, that robin has received a key that will unlock thge chastity belt of maid marian
, is not witty nor funny
. mel brooks as a circumcision
- giving rabbi is allso offensive to me
and others in the audience
( not all jewish
, either
)
. the movei simply tries to hard trying to be funny
and by
and large fails
. the addition of a blind man who stumbles around
, falling off cliffs
, walking into ledges
and being a general buffoon could have had soem humorous potential
,
but is also made terribly offensive
. the onyl reason to see this movie isnt the surprise ator at the end who plays king richard
. he isnt well worth waiting for
, if you can stand an hour
anbd half of unfunny dialogue
, excruciating visual humor
, old puns
, ancient jokes
and bad acting
. if yuo can ' t
, don ' t even bother watching this miserable film
.
