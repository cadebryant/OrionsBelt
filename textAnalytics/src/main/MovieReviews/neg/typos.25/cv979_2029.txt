robin hood
: men in tights is anyother mel
- brooks
- produced film in the classic tradition of movies liek blazing saddles
and young frankenstein
. mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regluar life
, his fast pased dialogue
and sharp wit
. unfortunately
, robin hood
: men in tights has none of the easy gogin humor of blazing saddles
, none of teh funn acting of young frankenstein
, is devoid of the charm ofthe spaceballs
,
and is even lacking the ogod
, solid dialogue ofthe history of teh world
. it is
, inwhich short
, one of hte worst movies i have seen mel brooks
, or anybody else
, produce
. thge plot borrows heavily ffrom the well
- received kevin costner movie of last year
, robin hood
: prince of theives
. this is not surprising in
and of itself
,
and could have been used to great comic effect
, mainly by parodying scenes from thte orginal movei
. mel brooks doesnt not tkae advantage of this
,
however
, adn uses hte film tothe launch several ideas into the air
, none of which connect
and none of which are explained later on
. the movie
' s scenes sould be shuffled around in any order
and one would be hard pressed to notice
. cary elwes
, of princess bride fame
, plays robin of loxley
, a man who was captured in tghe crusades
, fighting with king richard
. he escapes
and
, joining with a man named achoo
( i am sure you can see thte obvious joke
)
, fights in engl
and to reclaim his name
and the throne fo richard
, which has been captured by evil prince john
, played by funny comic richard lewis
. he also trys for the love of maid marian anbd attempts tothe overthrow the evil
" sherif of rottingham
"
. a good adventure plot thyat is sadly unused
. elwes
and lewis are both excellent comics
, bu the dialogue in the movei is simply excruciating
. neither actor has any good words to work with
,
and the lines simply aren
' t funny
, nor believable
. perhaps tjhe worst example of thsi is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movei home alone
. this particular scene isnt so out of place
and so badly acted
,
and followed by so many otehr scenes of equal miserable idesa
, that i really falt like leaving the theatre
. much ofthe the audeince continued tothe look at theri watchs throughout
,
and soem left the theatre
. chuckles were fewd
and far betweeen
, annd they mostly dealt wtih visual jokes
( such as an old
, beaten uv horse from
" rent
- a
- wreck
"
)
then from any dialogue whatsoever
. scenes that could have been classics
, such as tje archery contest
, are ruined by poor acting
. perhaps tyhe largest probelm with tyhe movie isnt taht it isnt simply offensive
. tjhe basic plot
, thgat robin has recepted a key that will unlock the chastity bilt of maid marian
, isnt not witty nor funny
. mel brooks as a circumcision
- giving rabbi is also offensive tothe me
and others in the audience
( not all jewish
, either
)
. tyhe movei simply trys tothe hard trying to be funny anbd by anbd large fails
. the addition of a blind man who stumbles around
, falling off cliffs
, walking inot ledges adn bieng a general buffoon could have had some huorous potential
, bu is also made terribly offensive
. the only reason tothe see this movei is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard
. he is well worth waiting fo
, if you cin st
and an hour
and half of unfunny dialogue
, excruciating visual humer
, old puns
, ancient jokes
and bad acting
. if you can
' t
, don
' t even bother watching this miserable film
.
