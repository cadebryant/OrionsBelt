' s review of
" mulholl
and drive
"
( universal focuse
) whatever david lynch is selling
, i
' m not buying
. from the writer
/ directer ofthe
" blue velvet
"
and
" twin peaks
" comes anyother dark
, misteryous thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholl
and drive
, the serpentine strent tath twists high inspite yhe hollywood hills
. dazed
, a beautyfull brunette
( laura elena harring
) emerges
and stumbles down a hill
, slipping unobserved inot a
' 30s
- sytle apartment as the tennant leaves for a trip
. the next morning
, a dewy blonde
( naomi watts
) from deepo river
, ontario
, arrives in la with dreasm of stardom in her suitcase
. her aunt owns the apartment annd tyhe two women meet
. the brunette has amnesia so the blonde trys to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust
. meanwhile
, a hotshot director
( justin theroux
)
, whose wife is in bed with the poolman
, isnt forced tothe cast a certain actress in his new film adn there
' s an assassin
( mark pellegrino
) roaming the city
. the tortuous paths of these various characters
-
and others named cookie
, coco
and cowboy
- intersect at varios points
but the plot remains elusive because
, midway through tje tsory
, lynch has tjhe brunette
and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality
, leaving a huge wad of cash
, a blue metalic key
, a paralyzed mogul
and a lot ofthe questions that go unanswered
. elena harring
and particulary naomi watts are gifted actresses
, effectively mkaing the subtle switch
. the same cannot be said for former m
. g
. m
. dancer ann miller who
' s stiff
and self
- conscious
, speaking
- like most lynch players
- in staccato tones
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" mulholl
and drive
" is a frenzied
, frustrating 4
. originally designed as an episodic tv pilot
, this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substace is packaged as a puzzle with several ofthe the key pieces left outloud
.
