the tagline for this film is
:
" some houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn ' t expect too much from this
.
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre
. i thought
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
and jan de bont
. i thougth
, mabe it wiull be funn
?
and in fatc the beginning was rather intriguing
.
but by the end of it i thought
: why liam neeson
adn cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these gerat actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess tyhat defies any rationality
. here is the story
: in the monstrously over
- decorated mansion known as hill house
, visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor
( liam neeson
) into being guinea pigs inthe a fright experiment under tjhe guise of an insomnia investigation
. amonst them is a sophisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
and a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. actually
, the doctor is researching the
" primordial fear reaction
"
and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects
and watch
! what happens
.
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself
. it rumbles
, hums
and belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
and billowy curtains
.
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real
, placing an emotional wall between audience
and screen
. thte second half of the film is basicaly about the main heroine running back
and forth from yhe sinister lamps
and evil furniture
. is tyhat exciting or what
? tyhe worst thing baout it is that it didn ' t have to be bad
. it ' s based on a great book
,
`
` yhe haunting of hill house
, ' ' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptions of the book was scary
annd inteligent
. it played with tyhe greatest fears ofthe our sub conscience
.
" the blair witch project
"
, thyat cost less thna an old car
, managed to shock
and terrify the audiences fomr their senses
.
and with a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovley peice ofthe terror
. de
! bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material tht it is
, in itself
, frightening
. he is the master of thte extravagant special effect
and the big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a moreso serious material
? in the end
" haunting
" wiull only haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont ' s career as a director
.
yot it wouldn ' t be fair tothe say tyhat everything is bad
. thte effects are truly impressive
and the house is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautiful
, mysterious
, magical
anbd spooky
.
bu this is where the good thigsn end
. the music is blaring
, thge floors moving
, tje ceiling morphing
and the pictures on tje walls screaming
-
-
and all ofthe this
, every second
, eveyr moment of screen time
, isnt absolutely without life
. it ' s nothing more tahn a special effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn ' t engage
. at first you do not nkwo wqat ' s oging on
. is this part ofthe the experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections of the subconscience
? paranoia
?
but in the end it shows out thta this is actually happening
. yhe house is actally possessed
. it isnt at that point wehn all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of yhe window
. for ever
, i sat infront anticipation for a decent climax
and that ' s what i got
? i believe hichock once said that
" it ' s
! better to wait for a climax
, thna to see one
"
. this may be true
,
and it might actually work
,
but ther isnt only one problem
-
- jan de bont isnt nto hichock
and the thigns that he shows are not scary
, only stupid
. they are impossible to take seriously
. any paralells that you might have heared befoer
, linking this picture to kubrick ' s
" the shining
"
, are absolutly baseless
.
" shining
" had class
, style
, story
, acting
,
but most of all talent
and originality
.
" haunting
" has only special effects
anbd art direction tothe boast of
.
and those elements alone are not enough to amking it a good film
. casting good actors for small
, pale parts only makes things worse
.
bu i guess that no matter what i or other critics sday or write
, most of ytou will see tihs film anyway
, even if the tagline woudl say
:
" some films are jsut born stupid
"
.
