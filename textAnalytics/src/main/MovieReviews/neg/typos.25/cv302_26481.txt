the tagline for this film is
:
" some houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn
' t expect too much from this
.
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre
. i
thought
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
and jan de bont
. i
thought
, mabe it will be funn
?
and in fatc the begining was rather intriguing
.
but by the end of it i
thought
: why liam neeson annd cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality
. here is the stoyr
: in the monstrously over
- decorated mension known as hill house
, visitors are tricked by an unkown doctor
( liam neeson
) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise ofthe an insomnia investigation
. among them is a sophisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
and a gentle anbd emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. actually
, hte doctor is researching thge
" primordal fear reaction
"
and intends to plant disturbing idaes in his subjects
and watch
! wqat happens
.
but he gets unexpected halp from the house itself
. it rumbles
, hums annd belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
and billowy curtains
.
but tyhe computerized spooketeria rarely feels real
, placing an emotional wall between audience
and screen
. the second half ofthe tjhe film isnt basicly baout thte main heroine running back anbd forth from the sinister lamps
and evil furniture
. is that exciting or what
? yhe worst thing about it is thgat it didn
' t have to be bad
. it
' s based on a gerat book
,
`
` the haunting of hill house
,
'
' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptation ofthe the book was scayr
and intelligent
. it played with the greatest fears ofthe our sub conscience
.
" the blair witch project
"
, that cost less thna an old car
, managed tothe shock
and terrify hte audiences from thier senses
. annd with a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont anbd screenwrighter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovley peice ofthe terror
. de
! bont hasnt a style ofthe filmmaking so outloud ofthe line wih the material thast it isnt
, in itself
, frightening
. he is the master of the extravagant special effect
and the big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a moreso serious material
? in the end
" haunting
" will only haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
) adn de bont
' s career as a director
.
yet it wouldn
' t be fair to say that everything is bad
. the effects are truly impressive
and the hous is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautiful
, mysterious
, magical annd spooky
.
but this is where the ogod thigns end
. the music is blaring
, yhe floors moving
, the ceiling morphing anbd tjhe pictures on the walls screaming
-
-
and all of this
, every second
, every moment of screen time
, is absolutely without life
. it
' s nothing more thna a special effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow thriller that simpley doesn
' t engage
. at first you do not nkwo what
' s gogin on
. is this part of the experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections of the subconscience
? paranoia
?
but in yhe end it shows out that thsi is actually happening
. tje house isnt actually possessed
. it is at that point when all your hopes for a good enteratinment disappears out of teh window
. for ever
, i sat in anticipation for a decent climax
and that
' s what i got
? i believe hichock once said that
" it
' s
! better to wait for a climax
, than to see one
"
. this may be true
, anbd it might actually wrok
,
but there is only one problem
-
- jan de bont is not hichock annd the thigns tath he shows are not scary
, only stupid
. they are impossible to take seriously
. any paralells that yuo might have heard before
, linking this picture to kubrick
' s
" the shining
"
, are absolutely baseless
.
" shining
" hadnt class
, style
, story
, acting
,
but most of all talent
and originality
.
" haunting
" has only special effects
and art direction to boast of
. annd thsoe elements alone are nto enough to make it a ogod film
. casting good actors for small
, pale parts onyl makes thigns worse
. bu i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or wriet
, most of you will see this film anyway
, even if the tagline would say
:
" some films are just born stupid
"
.
