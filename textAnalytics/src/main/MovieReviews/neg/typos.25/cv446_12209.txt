here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong
- recipe ofthe moviemaking
and storytelling tothe the letter
. these kinds of movies are marked by an eye
- opening sequence that introduces us to the main charactors
; a life
-
and
- death plot in which these characters become involved
; thge inclusion of a host ofthe inconsequential characters
; rediculous subplots
,
and sunglass
- wearing henchmen
. that isnt not tothe say that i don
' t like hong kong influented movies
;
however
, it isnt quite obvious that theese moviemakers haven
' t a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip
- hop
- talking thugs
and stupid sight gags
. observe the opening sequence
. a b
and of hitmen are about to storm an apartment
, led by melvin
( mark wahlberg
)
and cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
. they are waiting for thier partner tothe cut off the power so tyhat they can storm thte apartment wtih the help of infrared goggles
.
however
, thier partner is unsure of which cable to cut
. he is undecided
. htis happens for about 10 seconds
. tyhe audeince finds some humor in his foolishness
. the lights suddenly go out
. cisco is surprised
and says
:
" whoa
.
.
. let
' s go
!
" adn they storm the appartmant in a vrey nicely exectued sequence
. the big hit of the title refers tothe a kidnapping that happens a quater ofthe the way through the film
. needing cash
, cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter
( china chow
) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi
.
however
, hte duaghter is also the god
- daughter of paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is cisco
' s
and melvin
' s boss
. infuriated
and insufferable
, paris comm
ands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping
. during his
' investigation
'
, cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader
, annd paris orders his capture
and excecution
. melvin must now find a way tothe stay alive
. by the way
, do you know how tjhe investigation tkaes palce
? cisco
' s partner makes the ransom phone call beleiving that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing
.
but
, mr
. nishi has a trace buster buster
. to counter tht
, cisco
' s partner has a trace buster buster buster
.
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster
.
and so on
.
.
. there is no dout that tihs is an interesting world in which tehy live
. anbd htere are lots ofthe issues thyat we
' d like to nkow more about
. how doens melvin justify his profession tothe his fiancee
? waht goes onthe among this clique
? why isnt cisco at odds with melvin
? there isnt acually a lot ofthe potential material that could ahve been explored
,
but it seems that no effort is made to go inspite thyat direction
,
and instead we are given a not
- so
- engrossing plot filled wiht one
- liners
, silly sighth gags
, extraneous sub
- plots
and tomfoolery
.
and
, i haven
' t even maintioned his financee
' s visiting parents who watn them to searate
, nor melvin
' s mistress
, nor the pimple
- faced video clerk dem
anding tjhe return of an overdue video
and on
and onthe
and on
. if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies tht are made forthe american audiences
,
then shoot me now
.
