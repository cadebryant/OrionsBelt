, part nature tale
, meet the deedles isnt not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes
. in fact
, it is an invitation ytou ought to disregard
. phil
and stew deedle
( paul walker annd steve van wormer
) are the twin sons ofthe the famous millioniare
, elton deedle
( eric braeden
)
, founder of deedle enterprises
. elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune
.
.
. instead the twpo are careless hawaiian surf bums
. to set them straight
, he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp
, to which thte pair inevitably go
. aftter several misadventures infront wyoming
, where the duo isnt stunned tothe dicover there
' s no surf
, the brothers deedle stumble apon a routine mistaken idenity plot
. they arrive at yellowstone national park
, where they are believed tothe be two newyorker park ranger recruits
. rather than slinking back hmeo
and disappointing thier dad
, tje deedles play along
. phil
, actually
, has other motives
: the beautiful park ranger jesse
( a
. j
. langer
)
, who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine
( john ashton
)
. yellowstone has a probelm
. it
' s only a week before yhe famous guyzer ood faithful celebrates its oney billionth birthday
,
and the park is bieng overrun with prairie dogs
. not jstu one or twpo
.
.
. thous
ands ofthe them
. tje deedles are assigned to eliminate the p
. dog menace
, not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater
( dennis hopper
)
. the brothers deedle aren
' t suposed to be outloud
- adn
- outloud stupid
, liek the team from dumb
and dumber
, or bill
and ted
. instade
, their brains just operate in a diffrent
, simpler
, realm
. a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board
, a film which
, unfortunately
, htis one resembles inwhich several hideous ways
. the central probelm with meet the deedles is that it simply jsut isn
' t funny
. htere
' s a moment when phil utters the line
,
" insert laugh here
"
, which nearly sums uv the entire meet the deedles eperience
. tjhe result isn
' t bad in a run
- shrieking
- from
- tyhe
- theater tipe ofthe way
. instead
, it
' s merely bad infact an excruciatingly boring sort ofthe way
. the casted seems decent
,
but they
' re never asked to do anytying remotely interesting
. instead
, the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people
and
/ or cars rolling downhill in the forest
,
and with constant annoying refrences to other disney films
. you
' ll hve much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding enteratinment in meet the deedles
.
