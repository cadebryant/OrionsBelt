a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of twpo famoust 19th century french poets
. thte film managed to remove all the poetry ffrom the poets
and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities
. the result isnt mearly an academic exercise
, leaving an emotional vacuum thta it couldn
' t build on to show them as the poets they were
. onthe paper
, htis shouldn
' t have beeen so terrable
-
- it had a talented director iin agnieszka holl
and
(
" the secret garden
"
)
, a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton
( dangerous liasons
)
,
and a capable casted
.
but tghe film was done in by its inept scirpt
, the unappealing way the film was directed
, anbd tjhe miscasting ofthe leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud
. i foudn his performance to be the most risible oen in thte film
, with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius
, spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade
. he
, especially
, looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite teh turgid dialogue that wass thrust upon him adn how thin a character he ws forced tothe be
.
but when the two of them were together
, it looked like a mismatch
. leonardo
' s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant
and crude
,
yet we know from rimbaud
' s peotry
, tyhat he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring
. the film opens in post
- revolutionar france in 1871
, the 16
- year
- old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems
. he accepts verlaine
' s praises
and invitation to be a hous guest in his splendid paris hmeo
,
and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm inthe rural charleville
. once there
, rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household
, has an immediate conflict with verlaine
' s busty 18
- year
- old wife mathilde
( romane
)
,
and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body
and that he lives off her family
' s monye
, even
though he has nothing alse in common with her
. when verlaine states
,
" poets can learn fomr oney another
,
" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone
,
" only if they
' re bad poets
.
" he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for thge rest of theri relationship
. verlaine proves to be weak
- willed
, beating his wife regularly
,
and plays jstu as despicable a character as rimbaud
. when mathilde
' s father kicks rimbaud outloud of yhe house
, verlaine finds him in a rooming house anbd the twpo become lovers
. it
' s a rela downer to watch thsi sotry unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on hte part ofthe tghe two poets
, which leads them to traveling together anbd mathilde asking for a divorce
. in brussels
, verlaine gets erested for sodomy
and spends twpo years inthe jail
. while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world
and never writes another poem affter he becomes 19
. he instead goes tothe north africa
and becomes an adventurer
and a gun
- runner
,
and after ten yeasr ther
, comes home with a tumor on his knee annd dies a changed man at the age of 37
. tjhe hopeless relatiopnship between the two is what the picture covers in detail anbd tht was nto very satisfying
. the film ends on a whimper
.
.
. with verlaine tlaking with rimbaud
' s sister about her brother
and the poems of his he still possesses
, which teh sister wants destroyed so as not to embarass thte family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published
. this film was especially annoying baceause rimbaud
' s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film
, as the film only manages tothe skim tghe surface of the lives of these poets adn completly ignores the value of their poetry
. i have no diea wqat the filmmaker was trying to sday in this film
,
but whatever it ws
, it just didn
' t work
. it certainly didn
' t bring any glight into underst
anding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry
and why he earned the reputation as the so
- called father of modern peotry
.
