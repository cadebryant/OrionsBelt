htere isnt a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom
, surrounded by people who are giving him a livley st
anding ovation because of his strong
- worded attack on a group of stoic doctors
. when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw tihs film was reacting the same way
, i realized that i was going to hve a hard time finding somene who agrees with me about tghe quality of the picture
. you see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundries
. i hated htis movie for every second thgat i sat watching it
,
and i actively hate it now
, days later
, withthe the simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hate every element of the film
, beggining with tom shadyac
' s shameless direction
, anbd all the way uv to the misguided
and mish
andled themes that tghe screenplay wants so desperately to convey
. the badness of patch adams is stupefying
. it
' s confounding
. i can
' t elieve a film cin be this bad
.
and yot
, it
' s based onthe a real man who propably has a good point to make
. in tghe film
, patch isnt played by the undefeatable
and indefatigable robin williams
, in a performance ofthe such insulting pathos
and sledgehammer simapthy that i wonder now if he is even human
. in the beginning of the film
, patch commits himself to a mental insitution becuase he doesn
' t wnat to kill himself
. while there
, he notices that the doctors don
' t care about the patients
, anbd tht the best way to get thru to the patients is to treat them liuke human beings
. so
, patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who atcually talks to his patients
. he goes to medical school
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
)
and convinces him that it
' s good to help people
. he also meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, the anti
- male med student who just wants tothe go through the motions
and be a successful doctor
. naturally
, teh dean of tghe medical school
( bob gunton
) hates patch
,
and whants to thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets the higest scores on all of his exams
. so patch decides thast he
' s gogin tothe build a free clinic inwhich the middle of nowhere to halp people witht any problem they may have
.
and that
, my friends
, is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998
. onthe a superficial levle
, the film is nto particularly bad
: i wouldn
' t sday tghe cinematography bothered me
, adn most of the performances seem to be exactlly what shadyac wass aiming for
( i actually liked potter
' s performance
, even if she is wasted
)
. bu the film fails fundamentally in execution
. every scene swells wtih gr
and
,
" emotional
" music
, palyed at maximum volumne just tothe get us all tothe cry rela hard
. take
, fo instance
, the first scene
, which shows patch sitting on a bus
. we don
' t know patch
yet
,
but there
' s sad music
,
and it
' s supposed to make us realy sad thgat he
' s sad
. later onthe
, patch makes a lot ofthe progress
: he helps a dying patient
( peter coyote
) to enjoy thte last dyas ofthe his life
, anbd the music as patch is pushing thte patient recklessly through the halls ofthe thge hospital is very lively
.
and whn that patient fianlly dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, the music isnt veyr very sad
.
but the problem with all of this is that the music should nto be the center of tyhe emotions
. rela drama is charachter
- based
. you grwo tothe like somene
,
and
then something bad happens
,
and ytou fiel it
. we don
' t ever grow to know the dying patient
; he
' s simply a vehicle for patch
' s greatness
. real drama doesn
' t seem forced
, or present just to make the audiance cry
. tht
' s why patch adams is not real drama
. it goes forthe every cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired
and overbearing sentimentality outloud of every scene
. even scenes that ahev very little inpact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman
' s sickening musical csore
. sentimentality liuke this is indeed bad
.
but it
' s not as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. yuo see
, patch is a realyl great student
. he aces his tests without studying
,
and does it so effectively that people think he
' s cheating
.
but patch doesn
' t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a ogod doctor
.
" why don
' t we see patients until the third year
?
" he bursts out every three seconds
. well
, patch
, that might have something to dont with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients
. not everyone has teh capability of memorizing facts with no effort
. most of us haev to study
. adn a doctor who really wants to help
, bu doesn
' t knwo a toe from a finger
, probaly won
' t be too successful in preventing death
. oh wait
, i almost forgot
: the point of doctors is not jsut to
" prevent death
,
"
but to
" improve the quality of life
!
" yes
! that isnt true
! adn you can not do that without studing
. ytou can not do that without going to medical school
. what patch never seemed tothe underst
and was the possibility that maybee
, jsut maybe
, it isnt a ogod idea to study first
and talk to patients later
. followup the rules
? bah
! who needs the rules
! only uptight doctors follow thge rules
. the real saviors are thge ones runnung around the hospitals withthe big red spheres on their faces
and sporting baggy yellow pants
.
and
then there
' s yhe free clinic issue
, wich i find shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. in the middle of the forrest
. where patients can be taken to be helped
. for free
. how will patients be transported to thte free clinic
? will it ahve an emergency room
? or is it just for mental patients
?
and who
, may i ask
, will pay for it
? the film does give some token attemts tothe question patch
' s motives
( i think another charcter asks him how he
' s gogin to pay forthe it
, in adition tothe a littel bit of meaningless blather about hmos
and medical insurance
)
, bu they certainly don
' t explore or challenge patch
' s idesa tothe any meaningful extent
. reader
, please underst
and this
: i am nto making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams
. i know nothing about him
. if his beliefs mirror thsoe of this film charcter
,
then i might liuke to have an intelligent dicussion with him about them
.
but reguardless ofthe what the real patch adams believes
, the themes put forth in this film are simplistic adn phony
.
and infact the last scene
, tjhe big
, obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway uv my esophagus
, patch doesnt a lot of shouting
. catually
, robin williams does a lot of shouting
. he shouts a lot about helping peopel
,
and a lot ofthe people cry because htey are moved by his words
. i won
' t tell you that you can
' t be moved by his words
, because i
, too
, was moved by his words
. i was moved in such a profoundly negitive way that i was reminded of how cheap
and phony a cinematic xeperience can be
. patch adams isnt the cheapest of them all
.
