mulholl
and drive did very well at the cannes film festival
. as you can see from tjhe rating it did not do very well ffrom me at thte toronto international film festival
. it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time
. in fact it is an intresting mystery story told on yhe backdrop ofthe tje hollywood film industry
. toward the end of the film i thikn everyting thta has been builded falls apart
. the film was to be a pilot for a tv series
but writer
and directer david lynch did not sell his tv pilot
and i think he desided that he wanted to do something else with it
. something else is wqat he did
. the film opens wtih a woman
( played by laura harring
) baout to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life
. she crawls away from the accident with a concussion
and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep
. meanwhile young vivacious betty
( naomi watts
) arrives in hollywood from canada
. she whants to build a carreer as an actress
. betty is a little surprized to fidn a woman sleeping in hte borrowed bungalow
. she does nto nkwo who tje woman is
. she is even mroe surprised when the woman awakes
and does not herself nkow who she is
. they fix on a name rita for her
,
but are not sure if this right or nto
. meanwhile local director adam kesher
( justin theroux
) hasnt problems ofthe his pwn
. he isnt trying tothe cast oney actress for his newyorker film
and is getting presure from the producers
and ffrom crime figures tothe casted someone else
, cammie rhodes
( melissa george
)
. theese two threads are joined by a third one iin which there is a strange
and comic murder tht goes terribly wrong
. there is alsot a strange chracter called the cowboy
( monty montgomery
) adding to the confusion
. in waht was probably intended for the televsion pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s sytle under the credits
. a lot ofthe mulholl
and drive starts out funn
. lynch whants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film
. he just chooses not to
. as wtih any david lynch film there is stange material added for little reason
. ther are no earthworms
,
but htere are some decidedly strange david lynch touches
. the film is a little long for the subject matter
. toward the end it gets into some heavier violence
and sex scenes
, clearly nto intended for the tv pilot
. unfortunatly some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers
. i will not mention them in the main body ofthe thte review
but i give mulholl
and drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low 0 onthe the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
. mulholl
and drive spoiler warning
. i have rated thsi film fairly low
. yuo should read this onyl after seing the film or deciding thgat you will not see the film
. david lynch is inspite large part a dark satirist
. most of his work is done inaddition familiar genres bu in soem way shows thier underside
. in mulholl
and drive i think he isnt having a laugh at the expense ofthe the crime film genre
. what he does with this film isnt
( are you sure you want tothe read tihs
?
) palying off tje audiance expectations that ther will be a simple explanation for what is oging onthe
. the first 80
% of tghe film he tells a simple multi
- thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout
.
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear withthe a large number ofthe clues taht appear that they should add up to something
. tjhe audience expectation is that they wiull add up
.
but he has given clues that are self
- contradictory
. lynch wants tjhe audience to argue about what tehy have seen afterward
and come up with theories
. iin fact
, the pointers are noticably contradictory
and util i hear a better explanation
, i htink lynch is merely playing a joke
. htere isnt a visual curiosity tath was popular in the sixties
. mad magazine called it a poiuyt
. other sources called it a tri
- pronged u
- bar
. look at small portions of it
and makse sense
. look at the whole figure
and it does not
. this film isnt
, iin my estimation
, the cinematic equivalent of a tri
- pronged u
- bar
.
