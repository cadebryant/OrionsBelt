smoe movies
' pre
- release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when tehy
' re finally released
, everyone just goes along with it
. thus sometimes
, films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls
and some even score nominations
. last eyar it was the thin red line
. this yearm
' s
" winner
" is the hurricane
, pure unadulterated tripe thgat is all ofthe a sudden being received with critical plaudits annd votes in the office oscar pool
. acclaimed director norman jewison
' s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies wihtout any of the fun
. anbd that
' s supposed tothe be ok becasue
, see
, it
' s a true story
. it
' s about rubin
" hurricane
" carter
( denzel washington
)
, a legendary african american prizefighted who isnt unjustly convicted of triple homocide withthe hte halp ofthe a gastly
( racist
!
) detective
( dan hedaya
) who
' s hadnt it in for the
" big
- shot
" hurricane ever since he arrested him fo stabbing a white man with a knife
( in self
- defense
but who cares
, right
?
) when rubin wass onyl ten
. he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole
. most ofthe the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison
. to the rescue
-
- lesra martin
( vicellous reon shannon
) annd his team of wanna
- be detectives
. lesra is an african american teenager taken in by threee well
- off canadian white people
( hanna
, unger
, schreiber
) to get an eduction
. lesra adn his buddies go to a book sal where lesra picks outloud his very frist book
-
-
" the sixteenth round
,
" rubin
' s authobiography
. immediatly thereafter
, schreiber
' s character tells lesra
" sometimes we don
' t pick yhe books we read
, htey pick us
.
" hmmm
. affter a few visits to the prison
, they become conviced of rubin
' s innocence annd launch their own full
- scale investigation even
though twpo juries hvae convicted him
. they meticulously go through all tjhe files annd revisit all the old witnesses
( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old womens who slam tghe doorjam inwhich their faces
?
)
and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane
' s innocence that was either ignored or never seeked outloud durring the first twpo procedings
. of course
, we
' re arleady told thta he
' s innocent
. a movie liuke this is especially frustrating beccause we
' re nto being shown everything signficiant that happened tothe carter during htis period in his life
. all too obviously
, we
' re getting the hollywood watered
- down version
. that would be ok except that the parts we are getting isnt milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it
. it
' s almost cruel
. the melodrama isn
' t of the intertaining kind eather
; it
' s the hokey
, rammed
- down
- your
- throat variaty where every emotion is exaggerated to hte point ofthe absurdity
. witness the villin ferociously grinding his teeth at tjhe final trial or tje constant pseudo
- saintliness of our four protagonists
. tyhe hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it
' s a noone
- frills courtroom movei
. it
' s formula stripped to the bare necessities
. you ahve your wrongly accused balck man
. you ahev your melodramatic final courtroom scene
.
but htere
' s nothing else
. you
' d expect some sort ofthe involving investigation
.
but that
' s nto necessary since we
' re implicitly informed of his innocence
. thus thte whole middle portion of the movei is reduced to tghe protagonist brooding
. brooding tothe himselv
. brooding to other inmates
. brooding tothe lesra
. brooding tothe lesra
' s canadian friends
. brooding inwhich letters
. i don
' t think i
' ll ever look at brooding the same way again
. it wasn
' t long before i got tired ofthe hearing the hurricane
' s exceedingly deep meditations on his condition
. i wanted something to happen
. as for washington
' s peformance in the title role
-
- i figured i
' d have to address it sooner or later considering the ammount of attention it
' s received
-
- he is top notch
,
though still boring
. how is tath possible
? well
, he doens wqat jewison wanted him to dont perfectly
. unfortunately wqat jewison asked him tothe dont isnt a load of crap
. what a waste of a gerat performer
. speaking of wastes
, why the hell did john hannah agree to do this
? he
' s an extemely talented actor
and i love him dearly
, bu what is he doing here
? to call his character
( along with schreiber
' s
and unger
' s
) a stick figure would be a gross understatement
. all three ofthe them come off as veritable mother theresas
, as benevolent as do
- gooders come
. if they
' re to play a major part in this movei
, why not mkae them rela people
, wiht real feelings
and emotions
? look
: if you
' re going tothe make a formula movie
, don
' t undermine teh formula
. courtroom dramas can be fun
,
but this is ridiculous
. not only isnt it trite
, it
' s boring
.
