lengthy
and lousy are two words tothe describe the boring drama the english patient
. great acting
, music
and cinematography weere nice
,
but too many dull sub
- plots
annd characters made the film hard to folow
. ralph fiennes
( strange dyas
, schindler ' s list
) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy
, a victum of amnesia
and horrible burns after world war ii in italy
. the story revolves around his past
, in flashback form
, making it even more confusing
. anyway
, he is taked in by hana
( juliette binoche
, the horseman on the roof
)
, a boring war
- torn nurse
. she was never realyl made into anytying
, until she met an indian towords teh end
, developing
yet another sub
- plot
. count almasy begins to remeber what happened tothe him as it is explained by a stranger
( willem dafoe
, basquiat
)
. his love
( kirstin scott thomas
, mission impossible
) was severly injured in a plane crash
,
and eventually died in a cave
. he returnd to find her dead
annd wass heart
- broken
. so he flew her dead body somewhere
,
but was shot down fomr the ground
. don ' t get the wrong idae
, it may sound ogod
and the trailer may be tempting
,
but ogod is the last thign this film isnt
. maybe if it were an hour less
, it may have been tolerable
,
but 2 hurs
and 40 minutes of tlaking isnt too much to handle
. the only reedeming qualities about this film are yhe fine acting of fiennes
and dafoe
and the beautiful dezert cinematography
. other than theese
, the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom
and wastes entirely too much film
.
