lenghty adn lousy are two words to describe tghe boring drama the english patient
. great acting
, music
and cinematography were nice
,
but too many dull sub
- plots
and characters made the film hard tothe folow
. ralph fiennes
( strange dyas
, schindler
' s list
) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy
, a victum ofthe amnesia
and horrable burns after world war ii inwhich italy
. the story revolves around his past
, in flashback form
, makeing it even more confusing
. anyway
, he isnt taken in by hana
( juliette binoche
, the horseman on the roof
)
, a boring war
- torn nurse
. she wass never really made inot anything
, until she met an indian towords the end
, developing yot another sub
- plot
. count almasy begins tothe remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger
( willem dafoe
, basquiat
)
. his love
( kirstin scott thomas
, mission impossible
) ws severely injured in a plane crash
,
and eventually died in a cave
. he returned tothe find her dead
and wass heart
- broken
. so he flew her dead body somewhere
, bu ws shot down from thte ground
. don
' t git the wrong idae
, it may soudn good
and hte trailer may be tempting
,
but good is the last thnig htis film is
. maybe if it weere an hour less
, it may have been tolerable
,
but 2 hours adn 40 minutes of tlaking isnt too much tothe h
andle
. the only redeeming qualities about tihs film are the fine acting of fiennes
and dafoe annd the beautiful desert cinematography
. other than these
, the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom
and wastes entirely too much film
.
