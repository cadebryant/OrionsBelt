riendeer games is easily thge worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger
( scream 3
and arlington rd are the others
, each derivative in their own special way
)
. tjhe guy can
' t seem to write believeable dialogue
( sample from reindeer games
:
" rule
# 1
: never put a car thief behind the wheel
"
)
, create multi
- faceted cahracters
, or even engeneer coherent plots
but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists
and turns
( noone marter if each noe deems tyhe actual story increasingly unlikely
)
. his screenplay for riendeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching tjhe film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight
. i can jsut envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard
,
" oh you throught my movie was gonna go here
, f
* ck you jack ass
, take that twist
, decipher this mother f
* cker
!
" it
' s almost as if the writer were angry at us forthe shelling out monay tothe see his stupid movie
.
and why the hell owudl anyone want tothe invest time in a movei when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules forthe noone reason other than to congratulate himself onthe how damn clever he isnt
? auteur theory be damned
; it
' s kruger
' s
" style
"
, nto the director
' s that winds uv on screen
. kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut
" sometimes less isnt more
"
. annd his numberous twists cin
' t even claim tothe be originals
; arlington rd
' s ending isnt a direct steal from the much better alan j
. pakula thriller the parallax view
, anbd in riendeer ganes we get this ol
' gem
; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn
' t nkwo
( pronouns utilizied to protect the gender of the
" character
"
.
.
. grammar be damned
)
.
" how did ytou konw that
?
" the stunned protagonist asks
, suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along
.
.
. since twist endings are currently so in vogue
,
and seing as how kruger
' s screenplays ususally come equipped with baout threee twists per ending
, i guess it
' s noone wonder why he works so frequently
. he
' s quicklyu becoming miramax
' s mickey mouse
; the company has already signed him tothe work on sevral of their upcoming projects
. htis is apropriate considering that miramax
( which used to palce their label on some of the most artistically daring films
) has quickly become a grindhouse forthe coddling freign imports
( life is beautifull
)
and freddie prinze jr
. vehicles
. theri company
' s current logo sould be
" we ride the trends
"
. riendeer games stars ben affleck as rudy
, a supposedly hardened criminal spending his dyas
and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head
. altough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos tothe incinuate bad assness
, he plays teh role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging thru a polical academy flick
. affleck is such a puppy dog that it
' s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone
' s bitch
. the role itself is so badly written
( the character only grows balls when the plot calls forthe it
)
, the twists so outrageous
,
and the directing so self consciously gritty that this isnt about as close to self parody as i cxan recall a recent
" serious
" movie getting
. it may have been wiser had thte film makers simply went all the way in tht direction
, casting jerry seinfeld as tjhe hardened criminal
and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy
( who
' s palyed here by gary sinise in
yet another over the top villain peformance
) james frain is nick
, rudy
' s cellmate
, a manslaughterer who
' s foudn a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason
( charlize theron
)
. ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her
though she
' s never seen one picture of him
. which works outloud fine since the character is killed in a near
- riot
,
and rudy
( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick
) takes his place
, which leads to a sudden anbd very frenzied sex scene between ashley
and rudy
( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape
)
and a surprise visti ffrom ashley
' s brother
, gabriel
( gary sinise
)
, who waltzes into thier shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co
- horts
. he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who
, according to what he wroet in the letters tothe ashley
, utilisied to work as a guard in the indian casino
.
though by the end
, the film pulls the rug outloud from under us so frequently that everthing i
' ve described might as well be irrelavent
. this isnt what you can expect should you chose to tkae tihs reindeer on
; severeal scenes inwhich which
, aftter catching his prey
, the bad guy proceeds tothe stall interminably untill the good guy hasnt a chance tothe kill his captor annd crack a stupid oen
- liner
. included
: two
( 2
) scenes of two
( 2
) differnt bad guys explaning thier motives tothe teh hero when they should be killing him
( one following the other no less
)
.
though it
' s an action film
, the ending is more a talkfest where we git the wohle movie explained tothe us by one flustered charactor actor after anyother while affleck looks on
, incredulous as the audeince
. the flick was directed by john frankenheimer
, a straightforward action director who lucked inot the manchurian c
andadate easly in his career
, fell off the a
- list following a string of flops annd now
, in his old age
, is slowly climbing his way bakc up
. it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts
but his last major film was ronin
( one of those almost bu not quite movies
) which followed the isl
and of dr
. morneau
( you remember
, the noe with marlon br
ando in mime make
- up
and a not so flattering moo
- moo
)
,
and now thsi
. he films action sequences with a minimum ofthe quick cutting which i liuke considering that nowdays action scenes are commongly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung toghether
and layed out for a brain
- zapped mtv audience to pick apart
. probelm is theese action scenes
( nearly all failed escapes
) serve noone purpose infact the story other tahn tothe further pad out hte running time
and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play
. character problems abound
; rudy is made to shift betweeen sweet boy next door earnestness
and hard edged wiseacre
, the latter of which is not
( at least at this point
) something ben affleck is capible of pulling off
. thte fromer he can do wiht ease
and often the actor coasts onthe his lackadaisical charm while thsoe aroud him growl anbd swear
.
but
then suddenly affleck starts growling
and swearing alongside them liuke the class clown imitating a tarantino ganster
. charlize theron
, an extrordinary talent
, is
, like affleck
, playing whatever part thte scirpt requires her to play
, whether it be vulnerability at oen moent
, anger at the next
. she never hasnt a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious fysical attri
butes
( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this
. gary sinise has played this role frequentily
,
and here
, as in snake eyes
, he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol
( teh guy must be so incredibly borde of stomping through the smae paces that going out of control is hte only thing that keesh him interested any more
)
, tath it becomes more of an anonyance
( oh there he goes again
?
?
?
) than a threat
. these are talented peopel who made the misteek of jumping onthe to a script with little
but stock characters
and a bag ofthe tricks tht it dully springs on its audience
.
