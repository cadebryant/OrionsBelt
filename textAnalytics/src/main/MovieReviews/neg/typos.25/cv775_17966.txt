sometimes a stellar casted can compensate fo a lot of things
, annd
" pushing tin
" certainly features some name stars who are gogin places
: billy bob thornton
, cate blanchett
, angelina jolie
,
and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at frist
,
but he
' s actually the
* veteran
* among this quartet of fine
- looking people
. sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate forthe a lackluster screen treatment ofthe an idea that has
" hip comedy
" written all over it
, compensate for workmanlike
but uninspired direction
, compensate fo an obnoxious scoer that would have anyone
but the tone deaf screaming for tghe exits
, compensate for clich
? d characterizations
, compensate for embarrassing
" you have to be joking
" situations
. etc
. in
" pushing tin
,

,
and cusack don

" the full monty
,
" let alone won it
.
but i
, forthe oney
, wasn
' t ready to walk just
yet
. so quickly we descend inot a tightly
- edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters theese peopel have a difficult job
, yes
, what with their frantic

and soem heavy duty testosterone starts exuding

: was that my wife i saw you with last night
? director mike newell
(
" four weddings
and a funeral
"
) must have read a different draft of this script because the noe that
' s being acted outloud up there between newark
, jfk
,
and la guardia doesn
' t have an ounce of subtlety
,
and newell has made soem awfully good
-
and funny
- movies befoer
. the antics of these air traffic controllers will make ytou cringe
. they
' ll make you frown in disbelief
. they
' ll have you constantly looking at your watch
. bu wait
! there
' s still 100 mintues tothe go
!
! the film
' s onyl saving grace is blanchett
, whose connie falzone is a spunky
, brash
, long isl
and housewife who wants to better herself by tkaing art classes
. tihs is a wonderfull accomplishment forthe the fine actress who has previously played a red
- headed australian gambler
(
" oscar
and lucinda
"
)
and a tempestuous british monarch
(
" elizabeth
"
)
. bu she
' s not enough to savve the picture
. thornton looks terrific
and performs solidly
but his character is a joke
. jolie
( as russell
' s knock
' em dead wife
) isn
' t bad
,
but the up
- annd
- comming actress disappoints by alowing herself to be displayed like a plaything
. cusack cracks gum
, dons shades
,
and acts hip throughout
but
, like everything else in hte film
, his performance is forced
. inthe the last ten mintues or so
, for some inexplicable reason
, thigns start coming together
and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have beeen
, like the trailer teases
.
but it
' s too little too late
. a fine cast aside
,
" pushing tin
" isnt nothing mroe than an embarrasment
.
