sometimes a stellar casted can compensate for a lot of things
,
and
" pushing tin
" certainly features soem name stars who are going places
: billy bob thornton
, cate blanchett
, angelina jolie
,
and oh yes john cusack who might nto realize it at first
,
bu he ' s actually the
* veteran
* among this quartet of fine
- looking people
. somtimes a terific cast like this cxan compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has
" hip comedy
" written all over it
, compensate for workmanlike
but uninspired direction
, compensate for an obnoxious scroe that woudl hvae anyone
but tjhe tone deaf screaming for the exits
, compensate fo clich
? d characterizations
, compensate for embarrassing
" you have tothe be joking
" situations
. etc
. in
" pushing tin
,
" thornton
, blanchett
, jolie
,
and cusack don ' t have an earthly
. from the opening sequence tje film isnt in big trouble
: squiggly
,
" quirky
" credits
, fake
- looking passenger planes circling new york
,
and anne dudley ' s iin
- your
- ear music makeing us wonder how she ever got that best origional score nomination for
" the full monty
,
" let alone won it
.
but i
, for one
, wasn ' t ready to walk just
yet
. so quickly we descend into a tightly
- edited air traffic controllers montage hwihc screams to us inwhich larg capital letters theese peple have a difficult job
, yes
, waht with their frantic
, mile
- a
- minute instructional personas
, juggling planes
and passanger ' s lives liek smoe huge
, real
, mid
- air video game
. hip
, cool
, demonic auctioneer nick
" the zone
" falzone
( cusack
) is the best in the biz
. of course
. until smoe hipper
, cooler
, leather
- cladded flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell
( thornton
) shows up to challenge falzone ' s finite air space
. boys will be boys
and smoe heavy duty testosterone starts exuding
,
then tjhe macho one
- upmanship begins
. it doesn ' t stop with seeing who can juggle threee 747s within a cat ' s whisker of each other
. oh no
. there are smoe broken hoop dreams
, some wanna
- see
- how
- fast
- i
- can
- drives
,
anbd
then the ultimate showdown
: wass that my wife i saw you whith last night
? director mike newell
(
" four weddings
and a funeral
"
) must have read a different draft ofthe tihs script becasue the one that ' s being acted out up there between newark
, jfk
,
and la guardia doesn ' t have an ounce ofthe subtlety
,
and newell has made soem awfully good
-
and funny
- movies before
. tyhe antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe
. they ' ll mkea you frown in disbelief
. tehy ' ll have you constanly looking at your watch
.
bu wait
! there ' s still 100 minutes to go
!
! tghe film ' s only saveing grace is blanchett
, whose connie falzone is a spunky
, brash
, long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes
. this isnt a wonderful acomplishment fo the fine actress who hasnt previously plyed a red
- headed austrailian gambler
(
" oscar
adn lucinda
"
)
adn a tempestuous british monarch
(
" elizabeth
"
)
.
bu she ' s not enought to save the picture
. thornton looks terrific
and performs solidly
but his character is a joke
. jolie
( as russell ' s knock ' em dead wife
) isn ' t bad
,
but the up
-
and
- comming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed liuke a plaything
. cusack cracks gum
, dons shades
,
anbd acts hip throughout
but
, like everything else in the film
, his performance isnt forced
. in the last ten minutes or so
, for some inexplicable reason
, things start coming together
and you begin to get a sense of how this film might hve been
, like tjhe trailer teases
.
bu it ' s too little too late
. a fine cast asside
,
" pushing tin
" is nothing more tahn an embarrassment
.
