" deep rising
" gives ytou that sinking feeling both literally anbd figuratively
: nto only does the movei take place on a cruise ship slowy being immersed inot the middle of the ocean by a squid
- like menace
,
but the unfolding tsory is artificial
, silly
and almost completelyl derivative of countless other
( annd
, for the most part
, better
) films
. while dumb monster movies cant at least be decent gilty pleasures
-
- take
, for example
, the schlocky mountain highs of last spring
' s
" anaconda
"
-
-
" deep rising
" hasnt no tongue tothe put inaddition its cheek
. folks
, we
' re only a mounth into the new year
,
and already here
' s a c
andidate for one of its stinkiest releases
. most of the acation takes place on the argonautica
, a luxury liner in tjhe middle ofthe its maiden voage
( uh
- oh
-
- if these people had seen
" titanic
,
" thne mabey they
' d have known to stay home
) when it
' s attacked by a giant
, tentacled sea creature
. the only survivors are slinky jewel theef trilian
( famke janssen
)
, argonautica owner canton
( anthony heald
)
and a few other crew members
. a mercernary team
, lead by resourceful captain john finnegan
( treat williams
)
, board tjhe argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby
.
but what their searhc of the ship uncovers is something blood
- soaked
, hungry adn not veyr helpfull
. the main probelm wiht
" deep rising
" is its overt familiarity
; tyhe movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci
- fi
/ horror films inthe receet memory
. the consept is
" leviathan
" meets
" titanic
,
" with a dash ofthe
" speed 2
" thrown in fo ogod
( or is taht bad
?
) mesure
. tihs monster is equal parts
" 20
, 000 leagues under tjhe sea
"
and
" the relic
,
" konws how tothe open doors like the raptors from
" jurassic park
" annd even gets tothe expel a half
- digested victim
( a neat effect
, admitedly
) a la the giant snake inthe
" anaconda
.
" some of the attack sequences are straight out of
" jaws
" anbd
" alien
.
" a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out ofthe
" alien resurrection
.
" there
' s even a jet ski chase like
" hard rain
.
"
and the list goes on
. watching
" deep rising
"
' s casted battle the beast is a murky chore infact itself
, because none ofthe them have well
- developed characters
, nor do they seem tothe project even hte slightest sence of fear when facing their enemy
. williams is affable enough
,
but his finnegan just isn
' t believable
. an interesting supporting casted is throughly wasted
; pretty famke janssen
, best known as
" goldeneye
"
' s killer thighs
, is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams
, hwile kevin j
. o
' connor
, as finnegan
' s mechanic
, provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast
. djimon honsou
, who received raves for his performance as a noble slave inwhich december
' s
" amistad
,
" pops up in a brief part
. he needs to stay away from tjhe water
. the movie
' s fianl shot is a groaner
, as is the 11th
- hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on
- ship saboteur
. as if a cast deserving ofthe their snack food
- fate isn
' t bad enough
( when you taunt the monster
, you
' re really asking for it
)
,
" deep rising
" is a slow
, stupid slog thru a story without a single bright spot
.
and since we all knwo that the higher tjhe casualty rate isnt
, the closer we are tothe teh end of the movie
, rooting for this overgrown squid tothe swallow tjhe whole ship isn
' t out of the question
.
