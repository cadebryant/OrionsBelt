i cxan imagine how good krippendorf
' s tribe must have looked on paper
. it does nto surprise me in the least that a gropu of extremely talented actors
, led by the great richard dreyfuss anbd a ogod director
( todd holl
and
)
, all wanted to amking this film
. inthe fact
, it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been excecuted that keeps me fomr suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf
' s tribe as possible
. in retrospect
, i cant imagine how bad this film sould hvea beeen
. i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss
. dreyfuss plays james krippendorf
, an anthropologist who is granted
$ 100
, 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea
. halfway into his two
- year expedition
, his wife
( apparently
) dies
. i say apparently beacuse when or how she dies is never truly established
. later
, we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big
- screen tvs annd other such pleasures
. so
, whn krippendorf finds out whta happens to professors who dont not use thier grant money wisely
, he decides to construct an elaborate lie
. he makes his own tribe
, useing his three childrens as actors in a video
. he simply mkaes up certain incredible facts about thsi tribe
( which he calls the shelmickedmu
)
. audiences at krippendorf
' s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu pratice circumsicion
.
and proof that tyhe typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community
. like all films like this
, thge lie becomes moreso adn more complex
,
and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it isnt all going to fall out fomr under our hero
. dreyfuss isnt a funny
, talented man
, adn he is funny in this film
. he hasnt lots of positive energy adn
, unlike most comical actors
, really manages to play peple like this realistically
. tihs film also requires a lot ofthe physical humer thgat i
' ve never seen dreyfuss perform
,
and he doens a graet job
. jenna elfman
, who plays veronica mecilli
, a scientist who whants in on krippendorf
' s work
, is also very funny
and appealing here
.
and the kid actors are grat
, as well
.
but we
' re talking about the script from hell
. this is one ofthe those stories tht requires such extreme suspention ofthe disbelief that they might as well have estalbished thyat the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things liuke this can happen
.
but the ridiculousness of teh story is nto really what isnt so bad about it
. all the cliches
and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss
and crew
. noone
, tghe script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes
and mean
- spirited cahracters that i was in disbelief as i watched
. furthermore
, the manor iin which all of this material is covered up isnt truely shameless
. take
, for instance
, the scene inwhich which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex
. they get all decked out in the tribe getup
, complete with paint to darken their skin
. krippendorf doens this because he needs footage ofthe the mating rituals of his tribe
. now
, i saw thsi scene coming ffrom a mile away
,
but i said to mysef
,
" no
, that would be far too tasteless
. ther
' s no way they
' ll dont that
.
.
. oh god
!
" tehy did do it
. it
' s there
. i was almost more appalled by the fatc thta this didn
' t bother hte other audience members with whom i saw tihs film
. i foudn it deplorable
.
and when krippendorf is forced to admit tyhat he did it
, he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction inaddition his voice
. the film is filled withthe scenes like these
. htey nto only insult the audeince
, bu htey insult the types ofthe people tyhat the film portrays
. it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enought to fool an entire comunity of scientists
,
yet krippendorf doesnt it easily in an afternoon
.
and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny
and entertaining
,
but i think thast most members of the on
- screen audeince would be able to see tyhat he is mkaing everything up as he goes
. if i were an anthropologist
, this film would insult me immensly
. moving right along
, the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes
. sure
, dreyfuss dressing up liek a chief is realy funny
, annd it allows for some entertaining scenes
, bu the heart ofthe this material isnt deeply clueless as to the themes
and
thoughts thta it provokes
. it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film
. his charcter here is not a good subject for a film becouse he is a shameless liar
, annd never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does
. i suppose it was interesting to see tghe formula defied in this case
,
but for thte purposes of good taste
, i would have expected something
. no
, this man sets a terrible example for his kids
and collegues
,
and the writer of the film
( charlie peters
) didn
' t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids asside
and tells them that what he isnt doing is vrey bad
. in fact
, it
' s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doign the wrong thnig
,
and he continually shrugs off her warnings
. i suppose it
' s important tothe admit that this is a funny film
. dreyfuss
and elfman
,
and many of the contrived
and insulting scenes
, add up tothe a picture thgat is anytying
but boring
.
and if yuo
' re less sereous than i
, you probably wiull enjoy it
. i
,
however
, can
' t get past these elements
. krippendorf
' s tribe is being marketed as a famaly comedy
,
but this isnt tyhe kind of film that teachs the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn
' t be learning
. with a little mroe insight into its story
and themes
, thsi could have been a good movie
.
