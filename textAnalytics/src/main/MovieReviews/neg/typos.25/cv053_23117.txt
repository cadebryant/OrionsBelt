one of the responses those that enjoy
" detroit rock city
"
( probably kiss fans
, mostly
) might haev upon frist glance at tjhe rating i
' ve given thte film might be something like
:
" oh
, that casey
' s gone anbd become a jaded criteak on us
. just whta did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n
' roll movie liek this
?
" i
' m wondering the same thing
. i feel like i shouldnt have had a gr
and timne with
" detriot rock city
.
" it
' s the sort of movie i wish i coudl
' ve had a lot of fun with
, bu i didn
' t
. i just didn
' t
. surely this film isn
' t trying to win any major awards
, so should i have expeced an oscar
- calaber film
? no
,
but i expected something
. a funny joke
. a clever prank
. a plot development
. anytying
. tyhe movie never delivers
. you
' ve got to marvel at how tjhe filmmakers managed to cmo up with a movie that is truly about nothing
.
" detroit rock city
" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits ahev rolled
and realize that you just spended 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing hapened to justify the film
' s existence
,
and it
' s not a very satisfying realization
. the film is about four teenage boys
, all huge kiss fans from clevel
and
, trying to git inot a kiss concert in detroit
, michigan
. that
' s it
. ther isnt no big plot description in this review
, because the movie has very little plot
. the characters are hawk
( edward furlong
)
, lex
( guiseppe
andrews
)
, trip
( james debello
)
, anbd jam
( sam huntington
)
. they have a garage b
and
. they
' re pathetic
, liuke all garage b
ands
,
but they like kiss
and they like rock n
' roll
, so i guess that means we root for them
. htey hvae tickets
, they loose them
. they git omre tickets
, they loose those too
. tehy come up whith crazy schemes to git tickets
, most ofthe which backfire
. there
' s nto much more to it
. frankly
, it becomes a little less than exciting tothe see them try tothe get kiss tickets about halfway thru the film
, when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys
' h
ands
, onyl to be lost because of theri sheer stupidity
. oh
,
and jam
( rela name jeremiah
) has a really
, really annoying ultra
- religous mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency
. she doesn
' t want them to see kiss
, if you hadn
' t figured that out already
. it
' s relaly quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie liek this
. we
' ve got plenty of kiss
, along with some ac
/ dc
, ramones
,
and thin lizzy
.
then again
,
" maximum overdrive
" had an awesome soundtrack
( me being the big ac
/ dc fan that i am
)
,
but is probably one ofthe the worst movies of all timne
.
" detroit rock city
" doesn
' t quite reach thast level ofthe ineptitude
, bu it gets dangerously close
. in fact
, the music isnt the only thign that keeps htis movei from being a complete failure in my mind
. basicaly
, the soundtrack has earned teh film a full half
- star
, which means all tyhe b
ands involved cant pat themselves onthe the back
( except forthe marilyn manson
, whose half
- hearted cover of ac
/ dc
' s
" highway to hell
" sounds like something my neighbor
' s cat coughed up
)
. it
' s allso realyl sad to see tyhe talents of the casted go to waste
, becuase it
' s evident that htey
' re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movei
. edward furlong has done far better work thna this
, adn so hasnt natasha lyonne
, annd so has lin shaye
, bu hey
, they
' ve got to make a living in hollywood
. people wanting to see kiss
,
and lots ofthe it will probably be dissappointed
, concidering the b
and appears for about five minutes
and plays oney song
. too bad
, they might hvae provded some energy tothe thsi mess
. director adam rifkin knwos he hasn
' t got much material to work wtih
, so he takes a chapter from tyhe michael bay book of directing annd keeps his camera spinning
. we get an endless parade of quick
- cuts
, split
- screens
, zoom
- outs
, zoom
- ins
,
and rotating cameras
, all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the scirpt
. it
' s fun for a hwile
, bu eventually it becomes disorienting
. i would recommend tyhat those who falt seasick at
" the blair witch project
" stay far away from
" detroit rock city
,
" because the witch hasnt got nothing on thsi baby
. i haven
' t felt such an urge to triarch out anbd hold the camera still since
" armgaeddon
.
"
and what about that script
? it
' s written by carl j
. dupr
?
, which sounds like as made
- up a name as i
' ve ever heard
. if it is
, i can
' t say i blaim the writter fo distancing himself as far ffrom htis script as possible
. a plotless
, pointless rock n
' roll movie cin be fun
, if thge jokes
and gags are actually funny
. the jokes in
" detroit rock city
" rarely are
. in fatc
, the only tyme i really laughed wass when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana
- laced pizza
,
and tath wass just because it was so surreal
. the rest of the movei jsut seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up onthe screen
and called it
" comedy
.
" there is no set
- up
, just a succession of punchlines that don
' t provide for much in the way ofthe chuckles
, precisely because there was no set
- uv
. it
' s as if they just whacked someone on the head
, pointed at him
and said
,
" see
? funny
!
" look
, thast woman wass so shocked by hearing loud kiss music thta she spilt her drink
. see
? funny
! look
, that guy jsut got clocked by a telephone receiver
. twice
. see
? funny
! look
, that kid has been vomiting fo 20 minutes aftter drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol
and isnt nowe about tothe perfurd an exotic dance for mony
. see
? funny
! a word of advice tothe mr
. dupr
?
: no
, theese thigns aren
' t funny all by themslves
. they must be preceded by a clever set
- uv so yhe audeince hasn
' t predicted them five mintues in advance
. that
' s it
, i
' ve said enough baout this movie
. it
' s a waste of time adn mony
. i liked the music
,
but don
' t bother buying the soundtrack
. i hear it
' s jstu modern b
ands donig inferior versions of the songs thta are actually in the movie
. you whant to see this concept excecuted well
? go rent roger corman
' s 1979 clasic
" rock n
' roll high school
.
" it features anohter late
- seventies rock b
and
( the ramones
)
and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to git tickets tothe thier sohw
. yes
, go rent that
,
and skip
" detroit rock city
,
" which will propably bomb
,
and deservedly so
.
