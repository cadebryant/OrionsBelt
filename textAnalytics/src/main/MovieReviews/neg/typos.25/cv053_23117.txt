one of the responses those that enjoy
" detroit rock city
"
( probably kiss fans
, mostly
) might have apon first glance at the rating i ' ve given the film might be something like
:
" oh
, that casey ' s gone
and become a jaded criteak on us
. just what doed he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n ' roll movie liek this
?
" i ' m wondering the same thing
. i feel like i should have hadnt a grand time wiht
" detroit rock city
.
" it ' s thte sort of movie i wish i could ' ve had a lot of fun with
,
but i didn ' t
. i just didn ' t
. surely this film isn ' t trying to win any major awards
, so shoudln i have expected an oscar
- calibur film
? no
,
but i expected something
. a funny joke
. a clever prank
. a plot development
. anything
. thge movie never delivers
. you ' ve got to marvel at how tghe filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly baout nothing
.
" detroit rock city
" is one of thsoe films that you walk out ofthe affter the credits have rolled
and realize that you jsut spent 90 minutes watching a movei in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film ' s existince
,
and it ' s not a very satisfying realization
. the film isnt baout four teenage boys
, all huge kiss fans from cleveland
, trying to git inot a kiss concert in detroit
, michigan
. that ' s it
. there is no big plot descripton infront tihs review
, because the movie has vrey littel plot
. the characters are hawk
( edward furlong
)
, lex
( guiseppe andrews
)
, trip
( james debello
)
,
and jam
( sam huntington
)
. they have a garage band
. htey ' re pathetic
, like all garage bands
,
but they liuke kiss
and htey like rock n ' roll
, so i guess that means we root for them
. they ahev tickets
, they lose them
. they get more tickets
, they lose thsoe too
. they come up withthe crazy schemes to get tickets
, most of which backfire
. htere ' s nto much more to it
. frankly
, it becomes a little less than exciting tothe see them try to get kiss tickets baout halfway through the film
, when a total of eight tickets have already graced thge boys ' hands
, onyl to be lost becuase of their sheer stupidity
. oh
,
and jam
( real nmae jeremiah
) hasnt a really
, really annoying ultra
- religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency
. she doesn ' t want them tothe see kiss
, if you hadn ' t figured that out already
. it ' s really quite disheartening to see such a fine sountrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this
. we ' ve got plenty of kiss
, along with some ac
/ dc
, ramones
,
adn thin lizzy
.
then again
,
" maximum overdrive
" hadnt an awesome soundtrack
( me bieng hte big ac
/ dc fan thgat i am
)
,
but isnt probablly one of the worst movies ofthe all time
.
" detroit rock city
" doesn ' t qtuie reach that level of ineptitude
,
but it gets dangerously close
. in fatc
, the music is the onyl thing that keesh this movei fomr being a complete failure in my mind
. basicaly
, the soundtrack has earned yhe film a full half
- star
, which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on thge back
( except for marilyn manson
, whose half
- hearted cover of ac
/ dc ' s
" highway to hell
" sounds liuke something my neighbor ' s cat coughed up
)
. it ' s also really sad to see tghe talents of the cast go tothe waste
, because it ' s evident that they ' re all trying really hard to squeeze some life outloud ofthe tihs dead turkye ofthe a movie
. edward furlong has done far better work than htis
,
anbd so has natasha lyonne
,
and so has lin shaye
,
but hey
, they ' ve got to amke a living in hollywood
. people wanting to see kiss
,
and lots of it iwll probably be disappointed
, considering thte band appears for about five minutes
and plays one song
. too bad
, they might have provided smoe energy tothe htis mess
. director adam rifkin knows he hasn ' t got much material tothe work wih
, so he takes a chapter from teh michael bay book of directing
and keeps his camera spinning
. we get an endless perade of quick
- cuts
, split
- screens
, zoom
- outs
, zoom
- ins
,
annd rotating cameras
, all in an effort tothe cover up the sheer stupidity of the script
. it ' s fun for a while
,
but eventially it becomes disorienting
. i would reccommend that thsoe who felt seasick at
" the blair witch project
" stay far away ffrom
" detroit rock city
,
" because the witch hasnt got nothing onthe this baby
. i haven ' t falt such an urge to triarch out
adn hold tjhe camera still since
" armageddon
.
"
anbd what about tht script
? it ' s wroten by carl j
. dupr
?
, which sounds like as made
- up a name as i ' ve ever heard
. if it isnt
, i can ' t say i blame the writer for distancing hismelf as far ffrom this script as possable
. a plotless
, pointless rock n ' roll movei can be fun
, if the jokes
and gags are actually funny
. teh jokes infact
" detroit rock city
" rarely are
. in fact
, tghe only time i relaly laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana
- laced pizza
,
and that was just because it ws so surreal
. the rest of tje movie just seems like they jsut threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen
and called it
" comedy
.
" there is no set
- up
, jstu a sucesion of punchlines tyhat don ' t provide fo much in the way of chuckles
, precisely because there was no set
- up
. it ' s as if they jstu whacked someone onthe teh head
, pointed at him
and said
,
" see
? funny
!
" look
, that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilt her drink
. see
? funny
! look
, that guy just got clocked by a telephone reciever
. twice
. see
? funny
! look
, that kid hasnt been vomiting for 20 minutes affter drinking an inordinate amount of alcohal
and is nowe baout to perfom an exotic dance for mney
. see
? funny
! a word of advice tothe mr
. dupr
?
: noone
, these thnigs aren ' t funny all by themselves
. htey must be preceded by a clever set
- up so the audeince hasn ' t predicted them five mintues in advance
. that ' s it
, i ' ve said enough about this movie
. it ' s a waste ofthe tiem
and money
. i liekd the music
,
bu don ' t bother buying the soundtrack
. i hear it ' s just modern bands donig inferior versions of the songs thast are actually in thte movie
. yuo want to see this concept exectued well
? go rent roger corman ' s 1979 classic
" rock n ' roll high school
.
" it features anyother late
- seventies rock band
( the ramones
)
and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to thier show
. yes
, go rent that
,
and skip
" detriot rock city
,
" which will probablly bomb
,
and deservedly so
.
