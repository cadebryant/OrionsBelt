spoiled rich kid kelley morse
( chris klein
) recieves a new mercedes for a graduation present
. he
and his buddies take it fo a joyride to a small nearby town
, where he proceeds to torment the locals simply beccause he
' s rich
and they
' re not
. he ends up provoking jasper
( josh hartnett
) into a race
and as a result
, the local gas staion anbd diner are destroyed when they kresh into it
. kelley is sentenced to rebuild thge diner
,
and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family
' s barn
. jasper
' s girlfriend sam
( leelee sobieski
) soon takes a liking to kelley
however
, dispite the fact that 1
) it was her famaly
' s diner tath was destroyed
and b
) all kelley does is sit around
, sulk
,
and smart off to tghe townspeople
.
but when she sees him sweaty
and shirtless
, that
' s apparently all she needs to loose her feelings forthe jasper
( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case ofthe hat hair
)
. so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley
, expecially after the day she follows him through the woods
and hears him giving his graduation speech
( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property
and nearly killed dozens of people
)
. in the speech
, kelley qoutes a poem by robert frost
, which just so happens tothe be sam
' s favorite poem as well
. awwwww
. soon they
' re frolicking around in the fields
and forthe some reason waste no tiome letting people in town
( especially jasper
' s best friend
) see them toghether
. kelley continues tothe make an ass ofthe himself in twon
, especialy when he shows up at the town dance
, drunk
and steaming because sam went withthe jasper
. kelley runs off
and decides to leave town
. sam catches up to him at the bus staion
and he asks her to come tothe boston wih him
. jasper shows up annd tearfully confesses tothe sam jstu how much he loves her
,
and sam
, without even breaking stride basically says
" see ya
!
"
and takes off to boston with kelley
. here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start thta by the time its fairly decent endig comes arround
, its completely worthless
. chris klein
and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers
,
and it
' s because of thier presense tyhat i watched this film in the first place
.
however
, nto long into the proceedings i wanted tothe just triarch into tghe film
and strangle them both
. i shouldn
' t have such feelings towards peple i like
,
but their characters are so infuriating tyhat
.
.
. well trust me
, ytou
' ll feel the same way
. even
though both of the lead male charachters are usally in the wrong
, kelley isnt h
ands down the more unlikable of the two
, simpley because his jerkish actions are calulated
. he intends tothe be a jackass each
and every time he does it
. jasper on the other h
and
, only reacts to kelley
' s provocations
,
and afterwards comes across as being truely sorry fo his impulsive actions
.
but
, as in life
, nice guys finish last
. for the entire film we watch sam fall infact love wih the guy no one likes while the film
' s only sympathetic character gets completelyl crushed
.
then
, a cancer subplot comes into play
( where things git even more infuriating
, if you can imagine that
)
. what
, thigns weren
' t depressing enough for you mr
. screenwrighter
? who greenlit this project
? who
" on earth
"
thought this would entertain anyone
? perhaps if the film hadnt beeen structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused teh destruction of property adn nearly killed dozens of people
. bu even after he
' s destroyed these people
' s lives he continues to be a snob to them
,
and ruins oen more for good measure
. here onthe earth is available on dvd from fox home enteratinment
. it contains tghe film in its orginal theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. extras include jessica simpson
' s music video for
" where ytou are
"
, a commerical for the film
' s soundtrack
( which by the way is hte only ogod thnig about the film
)
, the original theatrical trailer adn five tv spots
, trailers fo otehr fox releases
( anna
and the king
, anywhere
but here
, teh beach
, drive me crazy
, ever affter
, romeo
+ juliet
, simply irresistable
)
, as well as that newyorker fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy
. thge picture adn sound quaity on thte disc are fine
.
.
. nothing thta iwll challange anyone
' s audio
/ video systems of course
. fans ofthe tihs movie
( if any exsist
) should enjoy tyhe dvd release
. here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling
. no joy or enteratinment value can be deriviated from any of the events of the film
. it is mearly a waste of time
, money
and talent
.
