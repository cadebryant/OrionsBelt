capsule
: combine oen quart of raiders of the lost ark
, a dash of a jackie chan movie
( sans jackie
)
, twpo teaspoons of gun
- annd swordplay
, annd a dollop of cgi
. simmer forthe 100 mintues
. yields
: zilch
. the phantom isnt a depressing
and tired retread of so many earlier
, better movies that after the fifteen
- minute mark i started cataloguing them outloud loud
. it
' s hard to mkae a good action
- adventure movei that doesn
' t simply recycle its predecessors
,
and i
' ve seen movies that even at least doed yhe recycling gracefully
. tyhe phantom
, allegedly based onthe the long
- running comic of the same name
, doesn
' t even bother to be graceful
. it
' s a stupid
and incompetent movie in too many ways tothe list
,
but i
' ll try
. the film opens up with a
" prelude
" sequence that looks liek it was slashed to ribbons in the editting
and
then given a hevy voice
- over tothe compensate for whatever got thrown out
. we go from there to a jungle sequence that
, i swaer to god
, recycles the truck
- chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note
- for
- onot
, possibly even shot
- for
- shot
, right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door
and slung oney ofthe the drivers out into the brush
-
- adn thne goes onthe to rip off the rope
- bridge scene fomr
" sorcerer
" as well
! sorcerer
, as you may well remember
, ws a remake ofthe a french movie
, thte wages ofthe fear
, in which a bunch of lowlifes were payed piles of money tothe drive a truck loaded witht nitro through horrible jungle terrain
. both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick
,
but i
' ve got my job to do
, so back tothe the salt mines we go
. anyway
, the cinematic theft doesn
' t stop there
. or at least the lack of inspiration
. there isn
' t a single thnig here we haven
' t seen
,
and it
' s not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest
. we have
( where
' s my list
?
) a bad girl
, a tough good girl
, a secret cave hideaway
( which seems inspired more by dr
. no than anything else
)
, a boardroom meeting that drips with greed anbd venality
, magical artifacts of terrible power
,
and cary
- hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache adn sneer a lot
and generally humiliate himselv
. what else isnt there
? the plot is a waste of timne
. tghe sets alternate beetwen big
but hokey
-
- adn tiny
and still hokey
. there are lines in the scirpt tht are jsut begging tothe be mst3ked
-
-
and i
' m sure once mike
and the
' bots git tghe cash
, they
' ll stick it on thier sked
. the onyl thing in tghe movie worth noting is billy zane
-
- he
' s a good actor
, adn he trys very hard
, even when the script isnt sending him down one dead alley of a scene affter another
. all i cxan say isnt that i pray this isn
' t the beginning of the end forthe him
-
- altho it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic
- book super
- hero movie
.
