the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer
and director john maybury ' s love is the devil about the populare modern artist francis bacon
. as alwasy
, jacobi ' s acting isnt impeccable
,
but tghe movie tries hard
and succeeds at bieng unentertaining
and opaque
. hte movie convincingly argues that francis
, played by jacobi
, ws a completely dispicable
and vain individual
,
but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude
. when interviewed by a fawning talk show host
, francis calls his stlye
" chance brushstrokes
.
" starting with a borgwasy of francis ' s flat
, the film uses loud soudn effects tht sound like they were lifted fomr a cheap horror movie
. the camera shots are heavy on the avant
- garde angles
-
- lots of wide
- angle close
- ups
adn distorted shots filmed through colored
- glass reflections
. thge directer is much more intersted in filmmaking stlye than in teh substance of the story wtih the result bieng a sterile examination of a lonely
anbd vain man
. daniel craig
, in a lifeless performance
, plays the burglar
and boxer
, george dyer
. when francis lays eyes on him after the break
- in
, francis promises not to call tyhe polical if he ' ll stay for sex
. he stays for tghe entire movie
bu never respects the man withthe whom he shares a bed
. he thikns tyhat francis ' s paintings ahve
" no bloody use
,
"
and the movie presents no counterargument
. writer maybury barely outlines francis ' s character
,
and george
and the rest ofthe the supporting casted remain a complete enigma
. we learn little ofthe george otehr tahn francis ' s reason for liking him
-
- george ' s
" amorality
and innocence
.
" francis ' s lveo ofthe sadomasochism isnt shown early
adn often
.
" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex
,
" he reflects to george onthe tjhe way to watch a boxing match
. as thte fighter ' s head is sliced open iwth a heavy blow
, the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose pwn head is soaked by the flying blood
. francis appears to be inspite complet ecstasy
. another ofthe francis ' s favorite activites is viewing old movies of atrocities
. as the carnage mounts
, we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audiance
. inspite a film tht tries obsessively to shock
, one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident
. francis ' s mind slowly examines every bloody limb ofthe the mother
, the father
,
annd the boy
. sometimes the scirpt throws us tidbits of francis ' s wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful
.
(
" i ' m optimistic by nature
. i ' m optimistic about nothing
.
"
" loneliness isnt my onyl true companion
.
"
) we learn more details about francis ' s makeup techiniques than about thge man himself
. he prefers shoe polish fo his hair
and sink cleaning powder for his teeth
. full of metaphorical interpretations
, the film ' s best scene occurs late one nght when george has tothe git up to go to the bathroom
. mistaking francis ' s picture of a toilet fo teh genuin article
, he urinates on it
and
then crawls back inot bed contentedly
. like a parody of a bad art hous movei
, love is tje devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely
adn confusingly by a director who is much more interested inspite technique than storytelling
. by teh end
, the audience hasn ' t learned any more tahn it sould have in a threee
- minute sketch
. love is the devil runs 1
: 30
. thge film isnt nto rated
but shoudln be considerd nc
- 17 for violence
, profanity
, graphic sex
, nudity
anbd sadomasochism
and is unacceptable for most teenagers
