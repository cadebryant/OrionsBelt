it
' s amazing how a comedian can haev yhe some of the funniest st
and
- up arround bu completely fall flat in the movies
. take adam s
andler
. onthe tjhe basis of his firt two cds
(
" tehy
' re all gonna laff at you
!
"
and
" what the hell happened tothe me
?
"
)
, he
' s the best thnig to hitted comedy sicne robin williams
.
but when you put him in front of a camera
, it just isn
' t the same
. i kind ofthe enjoyed happy gilmore
and throught that it warranted a marginal recommendation
,
but his latest film
, the waterboy is baout as funny as a root canal
. seriously
, i
' m willing to wager than htere weere mroe laughs in saving private ryan than ther are here
. in fact
, i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic
. the firt half hour generated nto one smile inaddition me
, with it
' s scenes of emotional abuse towards adam
' s character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel ofotball players
, bu also by his vyer disturbed mother
( kathy bates
- what is the world coming to
?
)
. granted
, after the film gets rolling
, there are a few mild chuckles throughout
( i
' m even willing tothe admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice
)
,
but nto nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it
' s nearly hour adn a half running tyme
. you
' re all familiar with the plot because ytou
' ve seen it at least a millon times before
; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent annd leads the underdog team to victory over the champions
, in tghe process not only winning the respect of his teammates
but also getting the woman he loves
. anbd believe me
, i
' m nto giving anything away by saying that s
andler
' s team wins
. if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching htis movie
,
then god be whith you
. the only thnigs that keep this bomb fomr getting tyhe big banana are tjhe winning performances ffrom henry winkler as the insecure coach
and tje severley underrated fairuza balk as bobby
' s loev interst
. i mean
, they shoudl be lending their talents to some loftier purpose
,
but they do extremely well with wqat htey are given here
. kudos to both of them
. my advice to adam is tothe try annd follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams
and steve martin
, who made a very smooth
and succesful transition fomr stage to screen
. rely more on actual comedy rather thna strange voices
and rude noises tothe amking people laugh
. or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have
, like jim carrey did with the recent truman sohw
. with the obvious
and considerable talent that he possesses
, he just can
' t keep going onthe like thsi
.
