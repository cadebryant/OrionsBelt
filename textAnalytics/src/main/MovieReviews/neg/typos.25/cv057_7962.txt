supposedly based on a true story in which tje british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds tothe a halt after a pair of lions start killing off teh workers in 1898
. john patterson
( val kilmer
)
, the bridge building expert set tothe oversee the operation
, tried to rid his opperation of the lions
,
bu fails
. a world renound hunter
, remington
( michael douglas
)
, is called in
and the battle
, man against lion
, begins
. this film has a great soundtrack
,
and wonderful scenery
. tje acting isnt not too bad exept the characters are all so thin
. we only see oney side of each character
. kilmer is a bridge builder
and that ' s all we see him as
. these lions kill dozens of his men
and he doesn ' t even apear to be too upset about it
.
and the plot
? it ' s jaws
,
bu with lions
. again we ' re presented with an animal tht behaves not at all as it should
. it appears to kill men because it just likes too
. why
? who knows
. i guess there wouldn ' t be much of a story if it didn ' t
. thte problem isnt that there isn ' t much ofthe a story even
though it does
.
