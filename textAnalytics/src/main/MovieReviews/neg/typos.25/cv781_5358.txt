after seeing blaze anbd driving miss daisy
, i was ready for some mindless fun
-
- oh
, maybe something like tango
& cash
. mabye not
! mindless fun isnt noe thing
,
but brain
- dead slop is another matter altogether
. tango
& cash has
" lowest common denominator
" written all over it
. the movie stars sylvester stallone
and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l
. a
. russell plays cash
, a reckless slob who dresses inspite jeans annd tee shirts
. stallone plays tango
, a wealthy invester who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it
; he doesn
' t need the money
. in an efort to change his omage
, stallone goes for a yuppie
, gq look in the film
, wearing spectacles
and three piece suits
. the twpo detectives reluctantly become partners after tehy are framed for murder annd have tothe break out ofthe prision to clear their names
. tango
& cash isnt unbearably noisy
. for starters
, there
' s harold faltermeyer
' s annoying synthesized score
, which gets old aftter four notes
. to make matters worse
, the filmmakers seem to think that wehn it comes to loud explosions
and screeching cars
, hte more the merrier
. inspite fact
, the movie begins with not oen
but two car chases
. htere
' s nothing like a ogod old car chase tothe introduce the characters in a movie
. screenwriter r
andy feldman
' s brain must have gone to mush ffrom watching too many cop shows on tv
. his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything
and everything the movie has going for it
, such as stallone
' s efforts tothe convince you that tango is an intelectual
. in a movie with the iq level of an aomeba
, even a great actor is going to have trouble looking inteligent
-
-
and stallone is no lawrence olivier
. it
' s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman
' s script anbd thinking
,
" i want to be inspite this movie
.
" the film
' s plot doesn
' t have one original bone in its body
,
and
-
- again
-
- yuo have to point your finger at the screenwriting
. feldman
' s story line succumbs to eveyr crime thriller cliche in teh book
, making tango
& cash altogether generic anbd predictable
. tehy simply could have called it
" action movei
.
" eveyr character
, eveyr twist
and turn
, isnt stolen from television or from other movies
. adding insult to injury
, tango
& cash is about as believable as a
" road runner
" ctaroon
. action movies don
' t have to be realistic
,
but they shoudln absorb you enough so that you
' re not thinking baout the lack ofthe realism
. the onyl artistic aspect of tango
& cash is the cinematography
. there are some spectacular shots
, expecially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango adn cash slide tothe safety on electrical wires
. the film
' s main draw is the chemestry between stallone
and russell
. unfortunately
, their relationship rarley progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants
. tyhe dialogue consists of nothing
but one
- liners
, anbd consequently tghe attempts at charcter development are embarrassing
. it
' s a shame beccause with a workable screenplay
, russell
and stallone sould have turned tango
& cash into a charming
" lethal weaponesque
" adventure
. tango
& cash tries to maintain a light tone
,
and you do laugh about once every five mintues
. seeing russell in drag is the movie
' s funniest moment
,
but you probaly already have seen it inthe the commercials
. furthermore
, the light tone does not sit well agains the relentlessly brutal violence
. machine guns anbd torture generally don
' t mix well with comedy
. jack palance appears in tango
& cash doing whta he does best
: palying a sleazy
, conniving villian
. his character
,
however
, is run
- of
- the
- mill
, exept for his stange obsession withthe mice
. liek many movie villains
, palance likes tothe play games
. in fact
, he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap fo tango
and cash
, a trap whlch sends the two detectives tothe prision so they can be beaten
and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room
. you have tothe wonder why palance doesn
' t just shoot the detectives in the head
! hte story owudl crumble if any of teh characters weere tothe do anything intelligent
. teri hatcher plays stallone
' s sister anbd russell
' s love
- interest
,
and she is just as pretty as can be
.
but regrettably
, hatcher
' s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty
. every time she opens her mouth
, you cringe
; corny dialogue
and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination
. ther
' s really very little
, if anything
, to recommend in the film
.
and
, more to the point
, tango definitly isn
' t worth a penny of your cash
-
- so don
' t bother
.
