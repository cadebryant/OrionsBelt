there were four movies thgat earned jamie lee curtis the title of
" scream queen
" in the early ' 80s
. two of them were halloween movies
,
but the other twpo
-
- prom night
and terror train
-
- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly affter the success of halloween
. thte same
" god
, i ' m scared
, there ' s some guy in a mask comming after me
" routine she did in john carpenter ' s classic
, jamie lee copies here
, wtih none ofthe tjhe urgency or suspense
. terror train takes place on
( where esle
?
) a train
, charted by soem pre
- med students finishing their first four years of higher eduction
. most ofthe them won ' t make it tothe med school
,
though
,
and it ' s obvious from the foreshadowing done wehn the conductor complains
,
" i wish to hell they ' d put a radio onthe that turain
.
" the conductor charcter probably has the most lines ofthe anyone
, even jamie lee
. from the beginning
, he ' s talking his head off
( he tells one ofthe his co
- workers
" think onthe this
-
- when ' s the last tiome someone built a shopping mall next to a turain station
?
" as if it makes any kind of sence
)
and it only gets better as he engages hismelf iin an argument about tyhe benifits of railroad over recreational vehicles
. of course
, the loudmouth conductor is the first person to fidn a bloody body
, which is
then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back tothe veiw it
. i forgot to mention hte prologue
. it ' s a party three years earlier
, wiht the same group ofthe students
. two of them play a trck on a geeky frat pledge
, promising him he ' s going to get laid
. they send jamie lee uv to stand behind the bed
and talk to tghe geek as he comes in
, noticing a form on the bed
. she syas
,
" kiss me
, kenny
,
"
anbd he kisses the body on yhe bed
, which happens to be a cadaver
.
(
" oh my god
, htey killed kenny
! you bastards
!
"
) it ' s a sick trick
,
and one jamie lee wasn ' t let in onthe
. she still hasn ' t forgiven the guy as they board the terror train
(
" you asshole
, ytou can ' t have a good time without hurting somebody
!
"
)
. the killing starts before the train even leaves the station
. sicne it ' s newyorker yera ' s
, everyone ' s wearing disguises
( a convenient plot device we ' ve seen befor
)
,
and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when noone one ' s looking
. at least one of yhe characters says it ' s a groucho mask
; whn the killer dons it
annd steps aboard
, it looks like gene shalit who
, by the way
, owudl make a great killer in a slasher movie
. speaking of weird
- looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene
, noe of terror train ' s most famoust gimmicks is the appeareance of david copperfield
" as tjhe magician
,
" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music
.
then there ' s his greatest trick
-
- getting layed wiht hair that looks like that
. fo all its attempts at visual stlye
adn substance
, terror train is more lionel thna amtrak
, more prom night than halloween
,
and nothing realyl worth watching
. onyl dieu
- hard fans ofthe jamie lee curtis
and david copperfield
( if he truley has any fans
) should even attempt to watch it
.
and it makes me wonder if a horror movie setted iin an rv could be much worse
. i mean
, when was the lastr timne someone built a shopping mall enxt to a train station
, anyway
? terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car
.
