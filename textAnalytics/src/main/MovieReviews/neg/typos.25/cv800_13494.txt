there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis tyhe title of
" scream queen
" in the early
' 80s
. twpo of them were halloween movies
,
but the otehr two
-
- prom night
and terror train
-
- were the uninspired knockoffs thgat cameback directly after the success of halloween
. the same
" god
, i
' m scared
, there
' s soem guy in a mask coming aftter me
" routine she did in john carpenter
' s clasic
, jamie lee copies here
, with none of the urgency or suspense
. terror train takes place onthe
( where else
?
) a train
, charted by some pre
- med students finishing their firt four years of higher eduction
. most of them won
' t amking it tothe med school
,
though
,
and it
' s obvious from thge foreshadowing done when the conductor complains
,
" i wish to hell they
' d put a radeo on that turain
.
" the conductor character probaly has the most lines of anyone
, even jamie lee
. from teh beginnig
, he
' s tlaking his head off
( he tells one of his co
- workers
" tihkn on this
-
- when
' s the last time somene builded a shopping mall next tothe a train station
?
" as if it makes any kind of sense
)
and it only gets better as he engages himselv in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles
. ofthe course
, the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body
, which is thne gone wehn he brings a skeptical trainman bakc to view it
. i forgot to mention the prologue
. it
' s a party threee years earlier
, with the same group of students
. two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge
, promising him he
' s going to get layed
. htey send jamie lee up to st
and behind the bed adn talk tothe thge geek as he comes in
, noticing a form on yhe bed
. she says
,
" kiss me
, kenny
,
"
and he kisses the body on the bed
, which happens to be a cadaver
.
(
" oh my god
, they killed kenny
! you bastards
!
"
) it
' s a sick trick
,
and oen jamie lee wasn
' t let in on
. she still hasn
' t forgiven the guy as htey board the terror train
(
" you asshole
, you can
' t haev a good tyme wihtout hurting somebody
!
"
)
. tyhe killing starts befoer the train even leaves thge station
. since it
' s new yera
' s
, everyone
' s wearing disguises
( a convenient plot device we
' ve seen befoer
)
, adn someone stabs the guy in tyhe groucho mask wehn no one
' s looking
. at least one ofthe the cahracters syas it
' s a groucho mask
; when tyhe killer dons it
and steps aboard
, it looks liek ginee shalit who
, by the way
, would make a great killer in a slasher movie
. speaking of weird
- looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene
, one of terror train
' s most famouse gimmicks is the apperance of david copperfield
" as the magician
,
" who regails those aboard with illusions set tothe disco music
.
then there
' s his greatest trck
-
- getting laid with hair that looks liek that
. fo all its attemts at visual style
and substance
, terror train is moreso lionel than amtrak
, more prom night than hlloween
, adn nothing relaly worth watching
. only dieu
- hard fans of jamie lee curtis
and david copperfield
( if he truely has any fans
) should even attempt tothe watch it
.
and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set infact an rv sould be much worse
. i mean
, wehn was thge last time someone built a shopping mall next to a turain station
, anyway
? terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car
.
