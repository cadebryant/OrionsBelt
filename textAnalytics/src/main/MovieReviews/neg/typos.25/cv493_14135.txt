tothe sum teh entire film
" 54
" uv in one sentence
, it woudl be
: watch a vh1 documentary instade
.
" 54
"
, seems liuke someone brang william faulkner inot 1978
, brought him into studio 54
, got him really drunk
, told him tothe write about it
,
and
then dumbed that down to be released to the public
. a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex
, drugs
, annd disco
. the narrator
, shane o
' shae
( ryan phillippe
)
, works as a grease monkey in new jersey who
, ofthe course
, on a whim decides to go into new york
and try to get into studio
" 54
"
. phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young
, attractive actor wih a six pack stomach
. he isnt let infront by steve rubbell
( mike myers
)
, the infamous co
- owner of studio 54
, because he isnt attractive
. he eventually becomes a bus boy adn
then a bartender
.
.
. you expected more
, didn
' t you
. there isn
' t
. the film builds uv fomr nothing
and becomes nothing as it
' s climax
( isn
' t that an apt word for studio 54
) l
ands with a thud
. the glitz of the club
and perpetually semi
- clothed patrons are used inaddition an tothe atempt tothe sohw the it
' s glamour
. for much ofthe its target audiance
, college age to early thirties
, it attempts to sohw celebrities mixing whith
" normal people
.
" this even fails since the only twpo celebs truely introduced are
andy warhol adn truman capote
. you can be sure that half of the audeince hasn
' t heard of them
, another quarter only know their names
,
and thge other quater knew they were there already
. the humor
, if you cxan call it that
, is builded on an eighty year old woman getting high
and 70s refernces like john travolta
and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back
then the best performance in the film isnt given by mike myers as the perpetually high
, sexually ambivlaent
, very new york steve rubell
. he seems to play rubell better tahn rubell would if he was still alive
. he looks liek rubell
and sounds jsut like him while giving a subdued
, almsot nostalgic peformance
, whn needed
. it reminds you ofthe his saturday night live character linda richmond onthe
" coffee talk
" sans dress
and wig
. the supporting cast of salma hayek
, breckin meyer
, adn neve cambell are thier only htere to give added subplots which are inctroduced
but lead absolutely nowhere
. the romance between phillippe
and cambell
, as a soap opera star
, is completely implausable
. the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots ofthe the eighty year old hooked onthe amphetimenes
. hayek
' s wanna
- be singer seems extremely forced
and her husban
, greg
( meyer
) st
ands in as shane o
' shae
' s surrogate best friend
. yhe subplots seemed forced
and seem liek tehy have beeen added just tothe amking sure the film was over an hour adn a half long
. overall
,
" 54
" tried to give a veiw of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine
. the film never leads to anything
, has no obserable point
,
and covers up a lack of real plot withthe a vell of beautyfull people
. in truth
, that reminded me ofthe the eighies
.
