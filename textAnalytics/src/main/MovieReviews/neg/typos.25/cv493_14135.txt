to sum the entire film
" 54
" up in one sentence
, it owudl be
: watch a vh1 documenatry instead
.
" 54
"
, seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978
, brought him into studio 54
, got him really drunk
, told him to write about it
,
anbd
hten dumbed that down to be released to the public
. a sloppy verzion of almost stream ofthe conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illution of sex
, drugs
,
anbd disco
. the narrator
, shane o ' shae
( ryan phillippe
)
, works as a grease monkey iin new jersey who
, ofthe course
, onthe a whim decides to go inot new york
and try tothe get into studio
" 54
"
. phillippe gives a passable peformance which could have been made by any young
, attractive actro with a six pack stomach
. he is let in by steve rubbell
( mike myers
)
, the infamous co
- owner of studio 54
, beacuse he is attractive
. he eventually becomes a bus boy
and
then a bartender
.
.
. you expected more
, didn ' t you
. there isn ' t
. the film builds up from nothing
and becomes nothing as it ' s climax
( isn ' t that an apt word forthe studio 54
) lands with a thud
. the glitz of tghe club
and perpetually semi
- clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it ' s glamour
. for much of its target audience
, college age to early thirties
, it attempts to show celebrities mixing wih
" normal peopel
.
" this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol
and truman capote
. you can be sure that half of the audience hasn ' t heard of them
, anyother quater only knwo their names
,
and tje other quarter knew they were there already
. the humor
, if you can call it that
, is builded on an eighty yera old woman getting high
and 70s refrences like john travolta
and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back
thn the best performance infact the film is given by mike myers as yhe perpetually high
, sexually ambivlaent
, very new york steve rubell
. he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive
. he looks like rubell
and sounds just like him hwile giving a subdued
, allmost nostalgic performance
, when needed
. it reminds you ofthe his saterday niht live character linda richmond onthe
" coffee talk
" sans dress
and wig
. tghe supporting cast of salma hayek
, breckin meyer
,
and neve cambell are their onyl there tothe give added subplots which are introduced
bu lead absolutely nowhere
. the romance betwen phillippe
and cambell
, as a soap opera star
, is completely implausable
. the two share about half as much screen time as htere are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes
. hayek ' s wanna
- be singer seems extremely forced
and her husband
, greg
( meyer
) stands in as shane o ' shae ' s surrogate best freind
. teh subplots seemed forced
and seem like they have been added just tothe make sure tghe film was over an hour
and a half long
. overall
,
" 54
" tried to give a veiw of the brashness ofthe the place where crack flowed like heroin whcih flowed liek wine
. the film never leads to anything
, has no obserable point
,
and covers up a lack of real plot witht a veil of beautiful people
. in truth
, that reminded me of the eighies
.
