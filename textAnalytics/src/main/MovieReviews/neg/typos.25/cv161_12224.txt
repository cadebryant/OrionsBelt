this isnt the kind of movei that makes oney appreciate disney
' s live
- action george of the jungle
. tarzan
and tyhe lost city
, tyhe latest attempt tothe bring edgar rice burrough
' s legendary hero to the big screen
, isnt one ofthe the most inept
and ill
- timed of any tarzan adventure so far
. badly conceived anbd poorly executed
, tarzan
and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video tsore shelfs
. i hvea no diea why the producers chose now to bring bcak tarzan
; it
' s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring forthe his next movie
. furthermore
, it
' s even more curious that htis film is rated pg
, which
, by dfeinition
, rules out any sex or explicit violence
. anbd
, hwile i
' m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek verzion of the story
, tarzan deserves a slightly moreso adult approach than the one utilisied in the embarrassing production
. ofthe course
, noone tweaking of tjhe content to change the rating could have saved tarzan
and thge lost city
, usance the film
' s troubles originated wtih the script
and were propagated all the way down the line
. imagine george of the jungle stripped ofthe all
( intentional
) humor
,
and ytou have a fair idea of what thsi tarzan is like
. with its uninspired action
and tepid adventure sequences
, the film barely registers a pulse
. anyone infront sarch of a relitively entertaining
, family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book
, which uses the same basic elements to much better effect
. the only worthwhile element ofthe tarzan
and the lost city is the pretty scenery
( which
, unfortunately
, includes the two lead actors
)
. the film doesn
' t attempt to re
- tell thte origin story

, sends a mystical message to tarzan for help
. withthe lady jane following close behind
, he returns tothe the jungle where he was born
. its patently obvious that casper van dien
( one ofthe the pretty
- boy heroes of starship troopers
) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability
. with his plastic facial expressions
, monotone voice
, annd complete inability tothe make convincing animal noises
, his range rivals that of steven seagal
. his pecs
,
however
, are impressive
,
and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off

, march give a solid peformance in jean jacques annaud
' s steamy the lover

then
, she made the career
- killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color ofthe night
, which exploited her every acting defiency
. tarzan continues this trend
. march may be attractive
,
but
, at least judging by this performance
, she can
' t ect
. meanwhile
, steven waddington has sereous trouble summoning up hte menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy
. instade
, he turns out tothe be little more than a nuisance
. the story line is pure formula
, which has largely been true througout the yeras for almost all of the tarzan movies
. the problem is that htis noe seems so childish
and lifeless
. the romantic elements are all contrived
? inspite fact
, lady jane
' s presence is necessary onyl so she can be captured
and subsquently rescued by her buff fiance
. the spacial effects are truely bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
( including some laughably bad men inspite ape costumes
? apparantly
, animatronics weere too expensive forthe this production
)
.
and
, of course
, as with all jungle movies
, there are tjhe obligatory cute animals
. over the years
, the legend of tarzan has beeen one of the most populare sources for film series material
. tje most famous ape man was johnny weismuller
,
but no less than twpo dozen other actors have essayed the part
( including gordon scott
, who is widely believed to be the best acto to tackle the role
)
. weismuller made 12 tarzan features
; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number
.
and
, having seen tarzan anbd the lost city
, i would argue thyat the movei
- gogin public woudl have beeen well served if he had missed by 12
.
