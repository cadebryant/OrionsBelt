everything in the phantom you have seen many times before
and there is nothing new presented here
. wincer displays absolutly no skill in setting uv an exciting acation sequence
. billy zane is wooden as the hero
. kristy swanson is given very little to do
,
and does very little with it
. treat williams
, looking like rhett butler
but sounding like mickey mouse
, is one of the worst villains i hvea ever seen in a movie
. onyl catherine zeta jones
, as one of williams cohorts turns inwhich a ogod performance
. she has energy
and spunk
, whic the movie needed much more of
. oh yeah
, teh phantom aslo hasnt a secret idenity
but this isnt so poorly played out you won ' t even care
. baout the only thigsn i cxan recommend are a good performance by jones
,
and some colorful scenery
.
however
, if youre looking for a fun family movie
, go watch the underrated flipper
. this is not a good movei
