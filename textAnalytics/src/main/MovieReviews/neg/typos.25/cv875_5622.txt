everything inaddition the phantom you have seen many times befor
and there isnt nothing new presented here
. wincer displays absolutely no skill infront setting up an exciting action sequence
. billy zane isnt wooden as tje hero
. kristy swanson is given very little to do
, annd does very little with it
. treat williams
, looking like rhett
butler
but sounding liuke mickey mouse
, is one ofthe the worst villains i have ever seen infront a movei
. onyl catherine zeta jones
, as noe of williams cohorts turns in a good performance
. she hasnt energy
and spunk
, which the movie needed much more of
. oh yeah
, thte phantom alsot has a secret identity
but thsi is so poorly plyed out you won
' t even care
. about the only things i cin reccomend are a good performance by jones
,
and some colorful scenery
.
however
, if youre looking forthe a fun family movie
, go watch the underrated flipper
. htis is nto a good movie
.
