, cleaning uv after dogs
. roro

. nto too surprisingly niether finds that his idea works outloud the way he quite expeced
. hte plot turns in several places are contrived
. one knows fairly quicklyu that if things are oging to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen
. lebanese
- born josef fares who wrote
and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer
. when thigsn start tothe get slow
, he just adds throws in another sotry
. for example halfway inot the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs
and a long chase isnt added to the film
. characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does nto seem to haev a whole lot mroe personality beyond fear for losing a biological function
. we do see some of roro
' s family life
and his concerns
. that may be because roro
' s background is a lot like that of the director
. while the story was entertaining
, i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile ffrom the film
. it was just a way tothe pass baout an hour
and a half in my life
. one does not ahve to go to the movies to see entertainment like this
. i rate it a 4 onthe the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
