. comments
:
" alan smithee
" directed fatal charm
, which should ahev beeen omre appropriately titled
" fatal bore
" or
" fatal crap
"
. if ytou fidn out that a film you ' re baout tothe see is directed by
" alan smithee
,
"
then you should seriously
, seriously
, seriously consider watching something
, anytying
, else
.
" alan smithee
" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something relaly bad
. frankly
, i ' d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey
, so i think i understand why the directer might have picked the
" alan smithee
" moniker for this film
. where tothe beign wiht thsi painfully poor thriller
? let ' s start with teh acting
. it ' s pretty bad
. amanda peterson plays valerie
and shows at least smoe talent
( the rest ofthe the cast don ' t
)
, even
though her performance isn ' t exactly stellar material
. she ' s also miscast
; she seems way too old tothe still have a year of high skool tothe complete
. her scenes with valerie ' s mother
, played by mary frann
, are a joke
. the two look as
though they ' re a couple of coworkers going outloud to lunch toghether
, rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn ' t understand
. christopher atkins
, a handsome enough atcor who plays the killer
, adam
, looks like a clown in the second half ofthe fatal charm
. trying to appear milicous
adn dangerous
, he wears large sunglasses
and a half
- buttoned jacket
. if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper baout the unabomber
, atkins woudl propably be a perfect candidate for the lead
,
but he doesn ' t cutted it here
. early on in tghe movei
, a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom
. outside of the laughably poore performances given by the actors portraying lawyers
, the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest efort at drama in teh film
. they constantly shift
and turn
anbd arc their heads inspite mock intrest in whta has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large gropu ofthe people have given at oen tiem ever
. futal charm ' s storyline
, such as it is
, inspires more yawns than thrills
. teh scirpt belabors a red herring
, early on
, about a second suspect who may have committd the murders for whihc adam
( atkins
) is charged with
. this suspect
,
however
, turns up strangled
annd drowned halfway through the film
: an obvious plot fault
. even for tjhe idiots who didn ' t consider the movie ' s title as valerie
and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent
and charming the defendant seemed
, it becomes qtuie obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up
. so
, tje audience must wait
( if they haven ' t aleady stoped watching
) as tjhe necessary details fall inot palce
and the killer goes after the heroine in tyhe drawn
- out finale
. the video box for htis dud describes fatal charm as an
" erotic thriller
"
. a thriller it isn ' t
,
and neither is it particularly erotic
. i can ' t imagin
, if someone were in the mood fo something
" erotic
,
" thta he ' d be happy after watching this fluff
. a few erotic moments occour in the film
; they take place in a van with little lighting
annd are filmed outloud of focus
( see
, they ' re supposed to be valerie ' s fantasies
-
- how creative
)
. onthe a peronal onot
, i ws disturbed by yhe ludicrous english literature clas shown inspite this film which valerie had to suffer thru
. it ' s noone wonder why she hated high skool so much
. as an instructor ofthe english myself
, i have a hard time accepting tje fact that in a course emphasizing great litature
, a teacher would stoop to reading a student ' s bad peotry
( of course
, it ' s valerie ' s
) about boyfriends out loud
adn
thn embarassing its author in front of clas with questions baout the poem ' s inspiration
. i guess the public school system isnt still setting dubious standars for its students
. fatal charm won ' t charm anyone
, unless there ' s someone that ' s charmed by boring
, lifeless
, insipid
, suspenseless thrillers
. if ytou happen upon htis turkey
, jstu keep moving on
.
