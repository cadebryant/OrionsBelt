. comments
:
" alan smithee
" directed futal charm
, which shoudln ahve beeen more appropriately titled
" fatal bore
" or
" futal crap
"
. if you find out tath a film you
' re baout tothe see isnt directed by
" alan smithee
,
"
then you should seriously
, seriously
, seriously concider watching something
, anything
, else
.
" alan smithee
" is a sewdonim which a number ofthe directors have unsed when they produce something relaly bad
. frankly
, i
' d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey
, so i thiunk i underst
and why the directer might have picked the
" alan smithee
" moniker for htis film
. where to begin with this painfully poore thriller
? let
' s start with hte acting
. it
' s pretty bad
. am
anda peterson plays valerie
and shows at least some talent
( the rest of the casted don
' t
)
, even
though her performence isn
' t exactly stellar material
. she
' s also miscast
; she seems way too old tothe still have a year of high school tothe complete
. her scenes withthe valerie
' s mother
, played by mary frann
, are a joke
. the two look as
though tehy
' re a cuple of coworkers going out to lunch together
, rether tahn a daugher withthe her mother who just doesn
' t underst
and
. christopher atkins
, a h
andsome enough acotr who plays the killer
, adam
, looks like a clown inaddition the second half ofthe futal charm
. trying to appear milicous anbd dangerous
, he wears large sunglasses
and a half
-
buttoned jacket
. if disney decided tothe dont a zany comedy caper about the unabomber
, atkins would probably be a perfect c
andidate forthe the lead
,
but he doesn
' t cut it here
. early onthe in the movie
, a number of scenes occurs inaddition a courtroom
. outside ofthe hte laughably poor performances given by tghe actors portraying lawyers
, thte peple sitting in the benchs provide tje silliest effort at drama inwhich the film
. tehy constanly shift
and turn
and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got tothe be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever
. fatal charm
' s storyline
, such as it isnt
, inspires more yawns thna thrills
. the scirpt belabors a red herring
, easly onthe
, about a second suspect who may have committed tjhe murders for which adam
( atkins
) is charged with
. this suspect
,
however
, turns up strangled annd drowned halfway through the film
: an obvious plot fault
. even for hte idiots who didn
' t consider tyhe movei
' s title as valerie anbd a blond newsreporter commented how innocent anbd charming the defendant seemed
, it becomes qutie obvious tyhat adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up
. so
, the audience must wait
( if they haven
' t already stopped watching
) as the necessary details fall inot place annd the killer goes after hte heroine in thte drawn
- out finale
. the video box for tihs dud describes fatal charm as an
" erotic thriller
"
. a thriller it isn
' t
, anbd neither is it particularly erotic
. i cxan
' t imagine
, if someone were in the mood for something
" erotic
,
" that he
' d be happy after watching tihs fluff
. a few erotic moments occur in the film
; they take place in a van with little lighting
and are filmed out of foucs
( see
, they
' re supposed to be valerie
' s fantasies
-
- how creative
)
. onthe a personal note
, i was disturbed by thte ludicrous english literature class shown inaddition this film which valerie had to suffer through
. it
' s no wonder why she hated high school so much
. as an instructor of english myself
, i have a hard time accepting tghe fact that in a course emphasizing great literture
, a teacher would stoop to reading a student
' s bad poetry
( of course
, it
' s valerie
' s
) about boyfriends outloud loud
and thne embarassing its auther in front of class with questions about the poem
' s inspiration
. i guess the public school system is still setting dubious st
andards for its students
. fatal charm won
' t charm anyone
, unless there
' s someone taht
' s charmed by boring
, lifeless
, insipid
, suspenseless thrillers
. if you happen upon this tukey
, just keep moving on
.
