billy crystal reappears in
yet anyother high consept comedy
. he trys to infuse some life into it
,
but it gets bogged down with sentimentality
and a lack of sophistication
. sammy
( billy crystal
) is a stuggling agent at the end of his ropes
. he
' s separated from his wife
, serena
( kathleen quinlan
)
,
and down to his lastest serious client
.
.
. inspite a low
- budget film shooting in romania
.
but in a turn of bad luck
, sammy wrecks his car
.
.
. only tothe be mysteriously saved by a giant
( gheorghe muresan
)
.
but this giant has a heart of gold
. he leads a solitary life
, helping out the monks at a local monastery
. his onyl longing is for his long lost love
, lilianna
( joanna pacula
)
, who has sicne moved to amercia
. sammy
, seeing a golden ticket
, convinces max to become an actor
( represented by sammy
, of course
)
,
and come back to amercia
.
and so sam
and max bounce from pathetic job tothe pathetic job
, with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before max
' s nose
. bu slowly sammy
' s deceptions begin tothe haunt him
. bu will he deveop a conscience before thte innocent max becomes disillusioned
. the humor in my giant isn
' t the world
' s greatest
. mostly
, it falls under the ctegory ofthe
" boy
.
.
. he
' s so big
!
"
, annd that can onyl go so far
, no matter how hard teh talent tries
. still
, its slightly amusing parts are longed forthe when tyhe movie gets bogged down in sappy moments
. the film
' s best moent
(
and that
' s not saying much
) is a bit part by steven seagal
, palying himself
. beetwen executive decision adn this
, all of seagal
' s best roles ahev been cameos
. maybe he should consdider a change ofthe work
: steven seagal
, tghe character actor
! gheorghe muresan isn
' t a natural actor at all
,
and his thick cotton
- mouthed accent certainly doesn
' t help
. in fact teh only thing he adds to the role is his emmense stature
. originally
, the consept was designed several years ago fo
andre the giant
.
andre also had a hefty accent
,
but he displayed a knack for comedy in tyhe princess bride
.
.
. something muresan should ahev studied for some pointers
. why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies
? he
' s proven thast he cin be much funnier thna these formulaic films allow him to be
,
and
yet
, liuke a glutton fo punishment
, he keesh coming back
. that doesn
' t mean we have tothe
.
