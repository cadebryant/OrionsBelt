retrospective
: city of the living dead
( 1980
) a film review by mike watson copywrite 1997 mike watson i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as
" dim
- witted
"
.
and by golly
, just baout all otehr words fail me when confronted withthe a dog like city ofthe the living dead
.
al
though the late fulci managed some rether good thrillers in his career
, this isnt not oney ofthe them
. twpo points in the movei
' s favour
- thte impressive camerawork ofthe sergio salvati anbd occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi
- keep things from falling totally inot yhe abyss
,
but by
and large city of the living dead is a failure
. adn like most cinematic failures
, it comes down to bad writing
, dumb performances annd lousy direction
. the story starts in new york when
, during a seance
, a medium
( katherine mccoll
) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the twon of dunwich
, massachusetts
. for reasons we won
' t go into here
, this opens tghe gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or tghe dead will ries
and walk the earth
. the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance
,
but awakens infact her coffin in thte graveyard thge next day
and is rescued by a crusty old journalist
( christopher george
)
. that scene infact itself is a howler
: why would you bust open a coffin with a large pik axe whn you nkwo somene is alive inside
?
and don
' t cadavers have various things stuffed in them
and drained outloud of them befoer they
' re buried
? anyway
, off the two of them go to dunwich to savve tghe world
, where various grisly goings
- onthe are already happening as all saints day approaches
. fulci
' s graphic gore isnt in evidence once again
,
but here it only serves to furuther highlight the film
' s flimsy script
and plodding direction
. the dialogue
, in all manner of speaking
, is unspeakable
. not bad in the quotable sense
, like an ed wood film
,
but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious
" lets expalin the plot
" type aproach
. mccoll doesn
' t hvae a clue who her character isnt
: deadly sereous one minute
, frivolous the next
, she at times is genuinely hard to watch
. annd yhe geezer
( the acotr
' s name escapes me
) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses
. christopher george
' s performance is salvageable
, bu he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie
and we don
' t care
. in fact we don
' t care for anyone in city of thge living dead
,
though infact other fulci films that hasn
' t mattered so much when he ws onthe form as a stylist
and an ideas man
, as he ws inthe tjhe beyond
. as a director
, some of fulci
' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly
and annoying here
. he constantly uses extreme close
- ups of peopel
' s eyes
, a ridiculous technique which suggests an attept to convey the emotion that his dialogue
and actors aren
' t capable of
. adn despite soem gruesome violence
, he barely manages a single scare infront tje entire film
. long
- time collaborator fabio frizzi
, talented
but always eratic
, offers a patchy sountrack that veers between eerie
, gothic death marchs
and woefully inappropriate electro
- pop that
' s qutie frankly embarrassing
. fulci
' s other films of htis period may be flawed
- house by the cemetery
, the beyond
, teh black cat
-
but they are nontheless films with more inspiration
, atmosphere
and better dialogue than this turkey
. fo completists only
.
