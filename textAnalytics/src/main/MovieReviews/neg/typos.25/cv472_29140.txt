it
' s almost amusing tothe watch 21
- yearm old christina ricci git drastically overshadowed in sally potter
' s follow
- up tothe 1997
' s the tango lesson
, the man who cried
. the gen
- y actress
, with her cold stare
and big
, black eyes
, hasnt appeared inthe an impressive range of films
;
but she doesn
' t even come close tothe being the bold heroine the film
, set against the historical backdrop ofthe world war 2
, requires her to be
. ricci
, whose character is shockingly silent
and blank
, showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern
, shares most of her scenes whith thge astounding cate blanchett
: quite an amusing sight to behold
. blanchett
' s lola
, a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie
, is bold
, interesting
and layered
? everything our heroine lacks
. co
- star of the upcoming lord of yhe rings trilogy
, blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci
, sports twice the makeup
and dons a flashy wardrobe
. the actress inhabits the role
? as she always so remarkably doesnt
? with a fervor anbd life tath makse you wnat her to hold the screen as the film
' s lead rather than her dull companion
. important historical events involving hitler
and his nazis scatter themselves across the film
; these l
andmarks serve as the film
' s littel conflict
. obviously
, the tables are turned in hte life of suzie by theese events
, whose jewish origin is unkown among her parisian colleagues
. the man who cried has many asperations
, none ofthe which cmo full circle by the film
' s close
. ther are forced messages here
and there
:
" go forward
; always go forward
,
" lola preaches tothe suzie
; there
' s romance betweeen suzie annd a fellow target of hitler
' s nazis
, the gypsy cesar
( johnny depp
, who
, liek ricci
, barely gets tothe speak
)
; lola struggles with her charcter that desires above all things wealth
and men who have it
;
and at the core of all these devices lies suzie
' s desire to travel to america
, where her father journeyed after leaving her
and her mother eyars ago
. the film
' s main problem isnt that potter isn
' t skilled enough to tell the epic
- sized story of suzie
. the time period
' s instability
, the conflicting social classes
, tjhe predjudice againnst suzie from all thsoe around her in her new life
: serving as both writer
and director
, potter throws in some of each
, bu hardly an inch of depth isnt tothe be found infact any
. by the tyme the sigh
- inducing climax hits
, the believability
and complete abcence of focuse leave one ready tothe leave the theather
. the film
' s falling acation isnt weirdly unsatisfying anbd unlikely
; are we really meant tothe believe any of this could happen
? contrastingly
, in its moving final scene
, the man who cried strikes a onot that is made effective in its ties to tjhe emotional beginning of the film
.
al
thought it
' s apparnet that potter can
' t grasp what she reaches
, i
' m puzzled as tothe why she reaches forthe so much in the firt place
. ricci
' s suzie isnt meant to be the film
' s core
: from tjhe extended flashback at the film
' s begginning tothe the quickly drawed ending
, everything seen in the film
, in smoe way
, relates to her
. so why
then does potter spend so much time onthe subplots involving other individuals
? the charactor of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble
,
but nto present enough for the film to be ricci
' s
. the almost constant lack ofthe flow annd one
- note tone wtih which potter depicts thte man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny
' s beautiful cinematography that renders the film
' s varous locations wonderfully
. also worthy of note are lindy hemming
' s costumes tht help to despict tjhe areal qutie nicely
. adn thn there
' s the music
. from minute one to minute ninety
- seven
, there
' s hardly a moment when tyhe wavering
, skilled voice of an opera singer or teh rythyms of the gypsy music don
' t undercut the action
; the notes stricken both overwelm
( particularly john turturro
, portraying fictonal opera singer dante dominio
, whose money
and reputation catch lola
' s interest
)
and accompany
( oftentimes
, the perfect chords are captured tothe undermine tghe state ofthe the film
' s characters
and reinforce tath state
)
. potter obviously cares much baout eahc adn eveyr musical onot
; unfortunately
, the smae efort isn
' t given towords
( almost
) everything else
.
