a number of criticists have decided that it
' s open season on freddie prize jr
.
, slamming thge young ator as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise controll in soudn
- alike
, disposable teen fluff like
" head over heels
,
"
" boys
and girls
,
"
" down tothe you
" annd
" she
' s all that
.
" while the prinze oeuvre isnt hard to defend
, his talent is nto
. i frist saw him in the independnet dark comedy
" the house of yes
,
" where he gave a subtle
, impressive peformance as the younger brother in oen of america
' s freakiest families
. prinze has thge acting chops
; he jstu needs to take a fewd supporting roles in some grown
- up movies to show the non
- believers that he has wqat it takes
.
" summer catch
" certainly won
' t help his case
. inoffensive
, bu utterly generic
, the baseball
- related romantic comedy does littel omre tahn kill time
. the story deals with the love affair betwen tenley
( jessica biel
)
, a wealthy cape cod girl
and ryan
( prinze
)
, a local boy ffrom a working class family who dreams ofthe becoming a big
- time baseball star
. ryan
' s preoccupation withthe his newyorker honey
- bunny drives her elitist father
( bruce davison
) crazy annd endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team
. it
' s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch
, as his time isnt occupied with making out wtih tenley
, fighting with her dad
, bonding with his own dad
( fred ward
, who deserves better than thsi
)
, fighting with his brother
( jason gedrick
) anbd carousing at a neighborhood bar wtih his teammates
. the filmmakers desparately want to amke a quirky
, charachter
- heavy baseball movei liek
" bull durham
,
" bu haven
' t got a clue how to get htere
.
and so they glide from one clich
? to the enxt for 108 mintues
. the only bited of originality comes from marc blucas infront a minor role as a center
- fielder from texas
. in an early barroom scene
, blucas
, best known as demon
- fighting riley finn from
" buffy hte vampire slayer
,
" hears a young woman compliment a guy onthe his ass
,
then turns to teammate matthew lillard
and states
,
" he doens have a nice ass
. a bubble
butt
.
" when lillard gives him an
" are you insane
?
" look
, blucas calmly says
,
" it
' s nothing sexual
,
" hten goes on tothe evaluate hte hind
- ends of some other players
, including lillard
' s
. speaking of asses
, prinze does not bare his in thge movie
. the actor has a noone nudity clause infact his contract
, so two stunt
-
butts weere employed for a couple of semi
- nude shots
. blucas
, whose chracter secretly dates a large woman throughout the story
, gets anohter unique moment late in the film
. sick ofthe hearing teammates make
" fat chick
" jokes
, he climbs onthe top of a table
and loudly declares his love of amply
- sized ladies
. while his speech still ends up objectifying womens
, it remains a nice change of pace inaddition a numbingly ordinary movie
. trivial tidbit
:
" summer catch
" marks a scooby doo summit
. marc blucas appears in
" jay
and silent bob strike back
" as fred from the scooby doo gang
, while freddie prinze jr
. plays the same character in the upcomming big budget film version of the old cartoon
.
