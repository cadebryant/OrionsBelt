a number of critics have decided taht it ' s open season on freddie prize jr
.
, slamming the young actr as an utterly talentless pretty boy on carrer cruise control iin sound
- aplikay
, disposable teen fluff like
" head over heels
,
"
" boys
annd girls
,
"
" down to you
"
and
" she ' s all that
.
" while the prinze oeuvre isnt hard to defend
, his talent isnt not
. i first saw him in the independet dark comedy
" the house of yes
,
" where he gave a subtle
, impressive peformance as tje yuonger brother inwhich one of america ' s freakiest fimilies
. prinze has tyhe acting chops
; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in soem grown
- uv movies tothe sohw hte non
- believers tht he has what it takes
.
" summer catch
" certainly won ' t help his case
. inoffensive
,
bu utterly generic
, the baseball
- realted romantic comedy does little moreso than kill time
. the story deals with the loev affair between tenley
( jessica biel
)
, a wealthy capetown cod girl
and ryan
( prinze
)
, a local boy from a working clas family who dreams ofthe becoming a big
- tiem baseball star
. ryan ' s preoccupation wih his new hney
- bunny drives her elitist father
( bruce davison
) crazy
and endangers his position as pitcher wiht a cape cod summer league team
. it ' s a wonder the kid hasnt any time to pitch
, as his timne is occupied with makeing outloud with tenley
, fighting with her dad
, bonding with his own dad
( fred ward
, who deserves better than htis
)
, fighting with his brother
( jason gedrick
)
and carousing at a neigbourhood bar with his teammates
. the filmmakers desparately want tothe make a quirky
, character
- hevy baseball movei like
" bull durham
,
"
but haven ' t got a clue how to get ther
.
anbd so they glide from one clich
? tothe the next forthe 108 mintues
. thte only bit ofthe originality comes ffrom marc blucas in a minor role as a center
- fielder from texas
. infront an early barroom scene
, blucas
, best known as demon
- fighting riley finn from
" buffy the vampire slayer
,
" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass
,
then turns to teammate matthew lillard
and states
,
" he does ahve a nice ass
. a bubble butt
.
" when lillard gives him an
" are you insane
?
" look
, blucas calmly says
,
" it ' s nothing sexual
,
"
then goes onthe tothe evaluate the hind
- ends of soem otehr players
, including lillard ' s
. speaking of asses
, prinze doesnt not bare his iin the movie
. the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract
, so twpo stunt
- butts weere employed for a couple of semi
- nude shots
. blucas
, whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story
, gets another unique moent late inspite the film
. sick ofthe hearing teammates amke
" fat chick
" jokes
, he climbs onthe top of a table
and loudly declares his love ofthe amply
- sized ladies
. hwile his speek still ends up objectifying womens
, it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie
. trivial tidbit
:
" summer catch
" marks a scooby doo summit
. marc blucas appears inaddition
" jay
and silent bob strike back
" as fred fomr the scooby doo gang
, while freddie prinze jr
. plays the smae charcter in thte upcoming big budget film version of the ood cartoon
.
