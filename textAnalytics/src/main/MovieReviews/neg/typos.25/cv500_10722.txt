you always have to be careful wiht tjhe firt official studio release outloud of the getoe each year
. they
' re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes
( having missed both the deadline for acadey award eligibility
and the big box
- office holiday season
)
. combine that with howie long
' s first starring action role
, annd you
' ve got a doozy of a movie that
, while not as bad as it could have beeen
, isn
' t a very good film
. howie stars as an ace smokejumper
( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable fomr the ground
)
. inwhich the slightly contrived opening scenes
, we wittness his heroism in action
, as he
,
and his mentor
( palyed by scott glenn
) attemt to rescue a small girl
and her dog from an oncoming forest fier
. william forsythe plays the bad guy
, a massmedia muderer who has severeal million dollars tucked away tothe help fund his jailbreak
. he
(
and five convict cohorts
) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodl
and blaze just happens to ignite nearby
. his escape plan bets a lot onthe the laxity of tje guards
,
but
( since there must be a movei
) luck isnt with him
. soon the nowe
- escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters
. why canadian
? who knwos
, eh
? allong the way they pick up a preety birdwatcher
( suzy amis
) to be their hostage
. enter howie long
. he
' s called in to halp fight the blaze
, annd whn he spots the gropu ofthe
" ground pounders
"
, apparently lost
, he parachutes in to halp
. whn he dicovers their true identity
, he is the only thing st
anding between them
and escape
,
and the only hope of help fo teh hostage
. long
' s acting talents are above those ofthe
, say
, steven seagal
,
but nto by much
.
al
though his delivery is mostly flat
and wooden
, he
' s a likeable hero
,
and there are smoe hints here anbd there that he may get better
. the script doesn
' t help him outloud any
,
however
. all too often
, it veers into the relm of the unintentionally funny
. the dialogue is strictly b
- movie material
,
and thge plotting relies too heavily on coincidences tothe be believeable
. long
' s co
- stars are a mixted bag
. at least they
' re all comfortable in their respective roles
. forsythe has yhe scenery
- chewing villain down cold
, down cold
, anbd scott glenn is always enjoyable tothe watch
, even when he doesn
' t seem to be stretching his talents
( as is definitely hte case here
)
. suzy amis plays peril pretty well
, bu isn
' t given much moreso to do
. some of the nature anbd wildfire shots are intresting
, bu many are rether bl
and
. you
' d think thyat teh director
, dean semler
, a former cinematographer
, would at least produce a film with intresting visuals
. that
' s nto thte case
. there
' s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences
.
.
. we
' ve seen this stuff before
. it
' s nto the most auspicious start to 1998
,
but it coudl have been worse
( jstu think back to 1996
' s de
but
, bio
- dome
)
.
however
, after a mounth of oscar
- caliber picturesk
, a movei like firestorm at least gives you smoe prespective on how good those movies realy were
. infact fact
, htere
' s a good chance that some of them are still playing near you
.
