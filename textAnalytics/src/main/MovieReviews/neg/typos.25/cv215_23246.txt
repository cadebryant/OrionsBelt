libby parsons
( ashley judd
) has the perfect little life
-
- a rich husband
, a cute son
,
and a hous on thge ocean
-
-
but when her husband nick
( bruce greenwood
) takes her sailing
, she awakes tothe find him gone
and her hands covered with blood
. jsut as she makes it to the deck
and picks up the bloody knife lying there
, the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husban sent
. she ' s convicted of his murder
, of course
,
and leaves her son matty
( benjamin weir
) with her best friend
( annabeth gish
)
. time passes
,
anbd the firend disappears wtih matty
. durig thier last phone conversation libby hears matty yell
" daddy
!
"
and realizes that her husband is still alive
. libby serves six years
, growing harder
and driven by the desire tothe kill nick
( based on tyhe theory that because of tjhe
" doublely jeopardy
" amendment she can off him iwth impunity
)
. when she gets parole
, she ' s sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman
( tommy lee jones
)
, a former law professor who ruined his life whith a drunk driving accident
. after a little breaking
and entering
and some destruction of property
, libby jumps parole
and lams it across hte country looking for nick
anbd matty
. travis pursues
, naturally
.
" double jeapardy
" isnt a watered
- down version of
" the fugitive
,
" iwth jones sleep
- walking through his well
- worn pursuer persona
.
although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a turain
, she manages to git into a fewd nail
- biters
-
- chased down the beach by a jeep
, chained to a car thast plunges into the ocean
, sealed inwhich a coffin
-
- that add some much needed thrills tothe an anemic
, slow
- moving script
. character development isnt thin
. travis ' intriguing backstory is maintioned a cuple times
but has noone effect on the story
.
( i think they onyl made him a former law professor so that he could verify tghe doulbe
- jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick
. it ' s a long way to go for one line
)
. there ' s considerable sexual tension between travis
and libby
( hey
, there ' s something
" teh fugitive
" didn ' t have
!
)
,
but it never goes anyhwere
. libby is a tv
- movei everywoman
,
bu judd ' s intense performance draws us in
adn makes us forget that her character hasnt no distingishing characteristics
. this is judd ' s most prominate role to date
,
and she proves thgat she can light up the screen
. let ' s hope hollywood gives her more tothe work with enxt time around
. tyhe quality of directer bruce beresford ' s movies seems tothe depend on luck
. whn he hasnt a ogod scirpt
and a storng casted
, he turns out oscar
- caliber work like
" ' breaker ' morant
,
"
" driving miss daisy
,
"
and
" tender mercies
.
" when he doesn ' t
.
.
. we get
" double jeopardy
.
" screenwriters david weisberg
and douglas cook previously collaborated onthe
" tje rock
,
" a script which propably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites
. bottom line
: ashley judd tries hard
but can ' t sive this predictable bore
.
