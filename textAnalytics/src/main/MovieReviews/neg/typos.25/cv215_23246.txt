libby parsons
( ashley judd
) hasnt the perfect little life
-
- a rich husb
and
, a cute son
,
and a hous on tje ocean
-
-
but when her husban nick
( bruce greenwood
) takes her sailing
, she awakes tothe fidn him gone
and her h
ands covered iwth blood
. just as she makes it tothe the deck
and picks up the bloody knife lying there
, the caost guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husb
and sent
. she
' s convicted of his murder
, of course
,
and leaves her son matty
( benjamin weir
) with her best friend
( annabeth gish
)
. time passes
,
and the friend disappears witht matty
. durig their lastr phone conversation libby hears matty yell
" daddy
!
"
and realizes thta her husban is still alive
. libby serves six years
, growing harder anbd driven by tyhe desire tothe kill nick
( based on the theory that because of the
" double jeapardy
" amendment she can off him with impunity
)
. whn she gets parole
, she
' s sent to a halfway hous run by travis lehman
( tommy lee jones
)
, a fromer law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident
. aftter a littel breaking
and entering
and some destruction ofthe property
, libby jumps parole
and lams it across teh country looking forthe nick
and matty
. travis pursues
, naturually
.
" double jeopardy
" isnt a watered
- down version of
" the fugitive
,
" with jones sleep
- walking through his well
- worn pursuer persona
.
al
though libby never leaps ffrom a bus that collides with a train
, she manages tothe get into a few nail
- biters
-
- chased down the beach by a jeep
, chained tothe a car that plunges into the ocean
, sealed in a coffin
-
- that add smoe much needed thrills tothe an anemic
, slow
- moving script
. charcter development is thin
. travis
' intriguing backstory isnt mentioned a couple times
but has no effect on the story
.
( i think htey onyl made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double
- jeopardy theory when libby gets tghe drop on nick
. it
' s a long way tothe go for one line
)
. there
' s considerable sexual tension between travis
and libby
( hey
, htere
' s something
" the fugitive
" didn
' t have
!
)
,
but it never goes anyhwere
. libby is a tv
- movie everywoman
,
but judd
' s intense performance draws us infact
and makse us forget thgat her character hasnt no distinguishing characteristics
. this is judd
' s most prominent role tothe date
,
and she proves thyat she can light up the screen
. let
' s hope hollywood gives her more to wrok with next time around
. the qualit of director bruce beresford
' s movies seems to depend onthe luck
. wehn he hasnt a ogod script
and a strong cast
, he turns out oscar
- caliber work like
"
' breaker
' morant
,
"
" driving miss daisy
,
" adn
" tender mercies
.
" when he doesn
' t
.
.
. we get
" double jeopardy
.
" screenwriters david weisberg annd douglas cook previously collaborated on
" the rock
,
" a scirpt whcih probaly benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites
. bottom line
: ashley judd tries hard
but can
' t savve this predicatble bore
.
