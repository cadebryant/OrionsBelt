. the lack ofthe humour wasn
' t thte only issue that i had with this film eather
. yhe movie attempts to weave a couple ofthe love stories through its vision
, bu unfortunately
, they are also lacking in conviction
, believability
and credibility
. they are contrived annd apeared to be placed into the story for onvenience sake
