- fated

. critique
: htis movie doed not make me laugh once
. perhaps it was because i wass tired when i watched it
. perhaps
. perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the smae schtick a thousand times on seinfeld
. perhaps
. perhaps it was because teh movie just wasn ' t funny
. absolutely
. the lack of humour wasn ' t the only issue thta i hadnt with this film either
. the movie attempts tothe weave a couple of love stories thru its vision
,
but unfortunately
, they are aslo lacking in conviction
, believability
and credibility
. they are contrived
and appear to be placed inot thge story for convenience sake
. the actors were all adequate enough in their roles
,
but the problem didn ' t lie in tjhe acting
. i wish i coudl find one good reason for you to see htis waste of time
,
but i can ' t
. unless of course
, you need something playing on your tv set hwile you waste soem time around the hous
. overall
, thsi movie stinks
. on tjhe good side
, charlize theron is darn cute
,
and yhe movie is no longer
then 90 minutes
. on the bad side
, this movie is not funny
, interesting or enjoyable in any whcih way possible
. a person wouldn ' t even enjoy his nachos hwile watching this emptiness
. please skip it
