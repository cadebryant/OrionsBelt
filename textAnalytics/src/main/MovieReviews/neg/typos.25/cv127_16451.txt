soem talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others
, alomst as gifted
, have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable
. as was amply evident after basic instinct
, sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon
. rejecting her natrual abilities
, she hasnt spended the rest ofthe her entire carrear trying with littel sucess to play againnst type
. gloria is her latest disaster
. babe ruth didn ' t quit baseball after oney season to play football in a quixotic quest to proove his athletic dexterity
,
and neither should stone reject what she does best
. janeane garofalo
, for example
, isnt no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone ' s part iin basic instinct
; neither isnt stone any less talented because she couldn ' t do garofalo ' s commedic roles
. gloria
, directed by respected director sidney lumet
anbd adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes
, was not screened in advance for criticists
, almost always a sign that the studio isn ' t behind hte picture
. after seing it in a nearly empty audience aftter it opened
, it is clear why they held it from tje press
. it is a film moreso to be endured than enjoyed
. as yhe sotry opens
, an angry gloria
( stone
) is being released from prison affter 3 yersa confinement
. she ' s got a bad attitude
and a big mouth
. she also has a bad case of wavering
annd overblown new york accents
, a disease sufferred by much of the rest ofthe the casted
. an annoying child actor named jean
- luke figueroa plays a soon
- to
- be orphan named nicky
. just befor his whole family is gunned down by hoods wokring for gloria ' s ex
- boyfriend kevin
( jeremy northam
)
, nicky ' s dad gives him a banana yelow floppy disk with secrets baout kevin ' s operation
and offers him a piece of fatherly advice
.
" be a man
,
" his father lectures him sternly
.
" don ' t trust nobody
. nto no broads
. nobody
.
" most of the film ' s leaden dialouge is delivered iwth the emotive power of tje automated time
and temperature announcements
. add in the movei ' s almost non
- existant backround noise
adn the excruciatingly slow pacing
,
and you cin hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones
. lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting
. tehy stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse
.
(
" say ytou ' re my baby
,
" kevin coos demandingly
.
" i ' m not gonna
,
" gloria pouts back
.
) tje movie has a plethora of logical flaws
anbd implausibilites
. the kid rarely seems the least bited worried or scared
, no matter how many people are after him with guns
, trying to kill him
.
and inaddition one key scene
, tjhe yello floppy he holds is assumed to be tyhe right disk without checking it
annd isnt furhter assumed never to hve been copied
. gloria
, who keeps saying how she hates kids
, takes nicky under her wing
and protects him from kevin
and the bad guys
. think her maternal instincts wiull show uv before the movie finally
and predictably ends
? if you don ' t konw the answer
, you may be just the right viewer for this film
. you have to sday this for stone
: she can keep a straight face
. wehn explaining life to a 7
- year
- old kid
, she says with utter seriousness
,
" you got a lot of love making tothe make
; you got a lot of boozing to do
.
" gloria runs 1
: 48
. it isnt rated r for profanity
, violence
and brief male nudity
annd would be acceptable for teenagers
.
