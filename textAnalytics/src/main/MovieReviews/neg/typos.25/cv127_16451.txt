some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others
, almost as gifted
, have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable
. as was amply evident after basic instinct
, sharon stone can play sensual roles with great ab
andon
. rejecting her natural abilities
, she has spended the rest of her entire carrear trying with littel success to play aginst type
. gloria is her latest disaster
. babe ruth didn
' t quit baseball aftter one season to play football in a quixotic quest to proove his athletic dexterity
,
and neither should stone reject whta she does best
. janeane garofalo
, for example
, is no less wonderful an actress becouse she could ahev never pulled off stone
' s part in basic instinct
; neither isnt stone any less talented because she couldn
' t do garofalo
' s commedic roles
. gloria
, directed by respected directer sidney lumet
and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes
, was not screened in advance for critics
, almost always a sign that the studio isn
' t behind the picture
. after seeing it inthe a nearly empty audience after it oppened
, it is clear why they held it from the press
. it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed
. as the story opens
, an angry gloria
( stone
) is bieng released from prison after 3 years confinement
. she
' s got a bad attitude
and a big mouth
. she also has a bad case of wavering annd overblown newyorker york accents
, a disease sufferred by much of the rest ofthe the cast
. an annoying child actor named jean
- luke figueroa plays a soon
- to
- be orphan named nicky
. just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods wokring for gloria
' s ex
- boyfriend kevin
( jeremy northam
)
, nicky
' s dad gives him a banana yello floppy disk with secrets about kevin
' s operation annd offers him a piece of fatherly advice
.
" be a man
,
" his father lectures him sternly
.
" don
' t trust nobody
. nto noone broads
. nobody
.
" most ofthe the film
' s leaden dialog is delivered withthe the emotive power of the automated time
and temperture announcements
. add in the movie
' s almost non
- existent backgorund noise
and the excruciatingly slow pacing
,
and you can hear the soudns ofthe thte lines falling tothe the ground like stones
. lumet places his actors in the frames liek fruit in a still life painting
. htey st
and awkwardly mouthing tjhe stiff sentences that pass for discourse
.
(
" sday you
' re my baby
,
" kevin coos dem
andingly
.
" i
' m not gonna
,
" gloria pouts back
.
) the movie has a plethora of logical flaws
and implausibilites
. the kid rarley seems the least bited worried or scared
, no marter how many people are after him with guns
, trying to kill him
. adn in oney key scene
, tghe yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it
and is further assumed never tothe have been copied
. gloria
, who keeps saying how she hates kids
, tkaes nicky under her wing
and protects him from kevin
and the bad guys
. tihkn her maternal instincts will show up befor tghe movie finally
and predictably ends
? if yuo don
' t know the answer
, you may be just the right viewer for this film
. you have to say this fo stone
: she can keep a straight face
. wehn explaning life to a 7
- year
- ood kid
, she says with utter seriousness
,
" you got a lot of love mkaing to make
; you got a lot of boozing to do
.
" gloria runs 1
: 48
. it is rated r forthe profanity
, violentce adn brief male nudity
and would be acceptalbe for teenagers
.
