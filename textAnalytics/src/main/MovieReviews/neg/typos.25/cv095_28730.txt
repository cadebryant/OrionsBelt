gord brody
( toom gren
) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim
( rip torn
)
and julie
' s
( julie hagerty
,
" airplane
"
) basement
. as dad declares all out war
, gord secures a job in a cheese s
andwich factory inspite far off la
and sets off to amking his dreams come true
. gord doesn
' t make much ofthe a go onthe his first attempt
and l
ands back home with fawning mom
and outraged dad in
" freddy got fingered
.
" toom green cowrites
( with
" tom green show
" scribe derek harvie
)
, directs annd stars inaddition what is essentially tom green
' s primal scream
. so
, if tom green screams in an empty theater
, does he amking a sound
? it
' s claer that
" freddy got fingered
" is at least parshally autobiographical
and green sure has noe hell of a complex about his dad
( mom gets off easier whn sonny boy advises her to go out
and have sex with basketball players
and greeks
)
. while this may be of interest tothe his hard core fans
, there
' s little baout green
' s mania on display here tothe recommend this movie tothe anyone else
. the film starts promisingly enough
, with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set tothe tyhe sex pistols
'
' probelm
'
( gren
' s put together a first rate soundtrack
)
and yes
, i laughed a few times
. green
' s flummoxing of a security guard withthe psychotic ramblings
and his attempt to draw
, make music annd eat at the same time
( the
' daddy would you like some sausages
' scene repeatedly shown iin thte film
' s trailer
) are inspired comedy
.
but whta
' s funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap
? a baby delivery bit shows some groan
- inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs
. younger
( by threee years
) brother freddy
' s internment at the institute forthe sexually abused children does nothing
but confirm one
' s worst fears regarding the film
' s title adn green
' s infamous
' h
andling
' ofthe a real horse
, hwile not nearly as shocking as it would seem
, doesn
' t make sense
. by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film
' s end
, thge overall effect is numbness
. while
" freddy got fingered
" has the admirable end result ofthe depicting teh harm in demeaning a child
' s self esteem
, it
' s essentially a hwole lot ofthe toom green running around bieng noisy
. rip torn
, what weere you thinking
