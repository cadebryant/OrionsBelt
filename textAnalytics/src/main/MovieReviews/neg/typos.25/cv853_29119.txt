it
' s a shame tje execution of this concept falls very short of its premise
. the movie is lacking
and most unsatisfying
. osmosis jones is crude
, gross
, disgusting
, adn wass directed by the farrelly brothers
- the twisted siblings behind there
' s something about mary
, me
, mysef
and irene
and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt
. not that ther
' s anything wrong wtih scatology
. i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humer
- such as it was
. it
' s merely that wiht osmosis jones
, the farrellys humer is too juvenile
, too predictable
. you can almsot foresee the puns just by viewing tje part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn
. osmosis jones looks like one ofthe those old health class movies gone pyscho
. the trouble is
, the animation may please the very young
,
but thte jokes may be over their heads
, hwile the teen
- age audience may find it too tame for their tastes
. adults
? well
, let
' s just say most will find it unappetizing
. osmosis jones plays like a 100
- minute infomercial for thge eat heathy foods lobby
. the live action sequences revolve aroud frank
( bill murray
)
, who seems to be the grungiest human being inspite the universe
. he continually looks as if he needs a shave
and a shower
. frank
, much to the consternation of his duaghter
, is a fast
- fod addict
, eating anytying
-
and everything
- that cin kill you
. he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner
-
and presumably smell better
- thna he does
. frank
' s body isnt invaded by thrax
, a lethal virus
, after frank eats a hard
- boiled egg thgat had fallen to the ground
. it
' s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt
and plops it into his mouth
. nope
, the farrellys pile it on by frist having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg
, wresting it from the primate
' s mouth
. liuke i said
, the gross meter tips the scales on this one
. after ingesting the egg
, the movie begins its animated sequences
. here
, osmosis jones
( voiced by chris rock
)
, a renegade white blood cell isnt teamed with drix
( voiced by frasier
' s david hyde pierce
)
, a 12
- hour
, painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax
( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne
)
. basically
, what we ahev isnt a cliched cop
- buddy movie
, rife with all the clich
? s of that genre
. adn this is why osmosis jones doesn
' t click
. it merely falls back onthe tired
, familiar conventions instade of creating new
and exciting situations
. the jokes annd puns are lame
: osmosis searches out a snitch
, a fromer flu virus
. affter pumping him for information
, drix tells osmosis
,
" funny
, he doesn
' t look fluish
.
"
and the jokes don
' t rise above that level
. tyhe live action scenes are no better
. frank is such a slob
, so unappealing tath it is difficult tothe fathom how he ever married or even sired a child
. he
' s allmost a bigger ctaroon than yhe animated characters
. osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns anbd dissolves blood cells right
and left
. the animation isnt rether two
- dimensional anbd flat
. it lacks scope
and depth
. it isnt an unappealing movie tyhat will leave you scratching your head
,
and maybe leaning towrad a shower after you walk out ofthe the theather
.
