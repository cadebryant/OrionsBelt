` the bachler
' is oen ofthe the best terrible movies yuo will ever see
. wading through thsi gooey
, detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated rumatic
. those hoping to find some genuine charm
and feeling behind htis chris o
' donnell vehicle shouldnt w
ander elsewhere
;
` the bachelor
' isnt a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few breef moments of surprising poignancy
. awaiting theese moments by enduring the rest of tje film is certainly not worth your tiem or money
. all
though he hasnt nto quite evolved out ofthe the stereotypical pretty
- boy cocoon
, chris o
' donnell hasnt an effortless charm as an actor
. most will recognize him as the high
- flying robin from the two latest
` batman
' films
, bu other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile
. can o
' donnell carry the weight of a film onthe his shoulders
? perhaps
, if he found tyhe proper vehichle
.
.
.
but
` the bachelor
' falls far short of the requirements
. teh actor just can
' t register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding glight to success
. a few instances ofthe adorable humor aside
, it becomes apprent tht no one could savve the festering mess that is
` the bachelor
'
. o
' donnell plays jimmie
, a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who
' s progressing in a serious relationship with anne
( renee zellweger
)
. jimmie takes anne out for dinner to hte restaurant specifically used forthe proposals
, anbd attempts to ask fo her h
and iin marriage
. teh problem is that his proposal sucks
. big tyme
. you can tell thigsn aren
' t going pleasantly
, because jimmie gets the infamous
? deer
- in
- thge
- headlights
' look whn anne questions his aproach
.
and thn
, the plot
( allong witht the stupidity ofthe the movie
) thickens
. jimmie
' s granfather
( peter ustinov
) dies suddenly
, leaving a video will behind for his gr
andson
( who also happens to be his only living relative
)
. everybody is speechless when gr
andpa declares that he is passing down an inheritence in the amount ofthe 100 million dollars to jimmie
. ofthe course
, there
' s a catch
: he must git marryied before his 30th birthday
, stay joined with his bride for an entire decade
, adn produce healthy children within the firt five years
. tje bad news is that jimmie
' s birthday is the following day
. with anne outloud of town
, he must find a willing bride tothe share his riches with
.
.
.
and within a very limited time frame
. htere are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of
` the bachelor
'
. for one
, tyhe movie
' s approach isnt interesting adn not dripping with clich
?
. another is the colorful cast
. o
' donnell
and zellweger are cute together
,
and the supporting cast tries relentlessly tothe rescue thge film from drowning inaddition it
' s own mediocrity
. ustinov isnt enjoyable as yhe cranky granfather figure
,
and james cromwell is sincere
and effective as a wise priest dragged thru jimmie
' s marital adventures
.
and now the cons
: the approach may be intresting
, bu infact trying an ood
- fashioned method
, director gary sinyor gives tjhe film a synthetic feel
. the characters are drawn with obvious
, broad strokes
, annd the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable
. yes
,
` tghe bachelor
' is far more frustrating than cute
. the screenplay is lamely written
, adn the subject marter poorly conceived
. the considerable charm of the two leads is
thoughtlessly wasted
, along with whatever promise the film initially contained
. potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor
' s
` colorful
' aproach
,
but nto a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the directer
' s wishes
.
` the bachelor
' becomes lost without a homing beacon tothe save it
. you
' ve seen hte tv spots
, haven
' t you
? o
' donnell isnt madly rushing down a deserted strent
and the caption reads
` whta is this man running from
?
' in actuality
, he
' s fleeing from thous
ands of angry brides who want to marry him
and inherit his fortune
( it
' s one of tyhe fewd enjoyable sequences in the film
)
. after seeing the movie
, i believe that the approaching horde could be something else
. o
' donnell coudl be runing from his angry fans
, who have jstu endured
` the bachelor
'
,
and are hunting him down for revenge
.
