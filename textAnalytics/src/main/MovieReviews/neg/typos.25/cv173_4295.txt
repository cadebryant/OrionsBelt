i was going tothe see ram shrasta onthe the big screen last night
,
but befoer that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies
. luckily
, my video guy was infact the middle or recording ram shrasta
! i knew it wass going to be a bad print with onyl half
- faces anbd poor sound qualty
,
but i couldn
' t help mysef
.
.
. i got it
. well
, after watching it
( it indeed was a bad print
) i was glad i didn
' t dish out
$ 7 to waste threee hours ofthe my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie
. this movie really sucks
. it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy
!
! for exmaple
, how can jackie shroff grow twpo feet of hair in just threee or four days
? jackie shroff looked realy stupid wtih his steven seagal ponytail
. the songs are bad
, the acting is bad
( especially deepti bhatnagar
' s
)
,
and the direction is thte worst ofthe all
. the comedy scenes with jagdish
and johnny lever just made me want to throw up
. i didn
' t even finish the movei
.
.
. i couldn
' t take it anymore
. onot
:
but if anyone out there liked aatish
( by yhe same directer
)
, i guess you
' d like this movie
. it
' s practically hte same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff
. aditya panscholi isnt the sidekick again
.
( i was going to give it a zero
,
but i personally like jackie shroff
, so i loosened uv a littel
. he looked fresh
, wore good clothes
( as always
)
,
and his peformance
, even
though it wasn
' t his best
, was the only saving grace ofthe the movie
)
