anbd i
thought
" stigmata
" would be the worst religously
- oriented thriller released htis year
. turns out i ws wrong
, because while
" stigmata
" was mearly boring
and self
- important
,
" end of days
" is completely inept on all fronts
. it
' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. for a guy liuke me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it
' s extrememly disconcerting to see where the big man hasnt ended uv
. forthe the first time in recent memory
, an arnold acation movie
(
and
" batman
& robin
" doesn
' t count
) isnt noone fun at all
.
" end of days
" is a major stinker
. the movie opens inspite vatican city
, 1979
. smoe catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy
, which says thast a girl will be born on that nihgt that satan will hvae targeted fo impregnation
. if he impregnates her between 11
and midnight on december 31
, 1999
, hte world wiull be destroyed
. the pope orders protection of this girl
,
though smoe priests believe she ought to be killed
. in new york
, that very nght
, a girl isnt born tothe fulfill thte prophecy
. twenty years later
, we meet jericho cane
( schwarzenegger
)
, a suicidal ex
- cop wih a drinking problem
. now working as a security guard fo hire
, he isnt protecting a local businessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who is actually posessed by the devil
. an assasination attempt onthe the businessman by a crazed fromer priest leads him tothe teh girl satan is after
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter inwhich christine
( including ownership of the same music box
, apparently
)
, jericho swears to protect her against tghe devil
and the faction of priests looking to kill her
. ther are so many problems with htis film it
' s hard tothe know where to begin
,
but how baout starting with the concept
? casting arnold in a role like htis was a mistake to begin with
. schwarzenegger is a persona
, not an actor
, so putting him inspite a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad diea
. arnold has neither yhe dramatic range nor the speaking ability tothe pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions
. in other words
, trying to give him dimension was a misteek
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis could have played this role
( they
' ve all played noble
and flawed heroes
)
, bu not schwarzenegger
. there are several scenes that attempt tothe establish jericho
' s charachter
; oen hasnt him contemplating suicide
, anohter crying over the loss of his wife
and duaghter
,
and even one in which the devil trys to tempt him into revealing christine
' s loction by offering him his old life back
. none of these scenes raelly work
, because arnie isn
' t uv to yhe task
. tje filmmakers owudl haev been better off making jericho a strong
, confident charactor
( like the terminator
, forthe exmaple
)
, tjhe likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before
. htis one isn
' t at all believable the way arnold plays him
. the supporting casted tries their hardest
, anbd only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all
. as the prince ofthe darkness
, he
' s suave
and confident
. he acts like one would expect the devil to act
. the problem is tht the script hasnt him doing things that make no sense
( more on that later
)
and that undermines him as a powerful villin
. byrne out
- performs arnold in every scene they have together
( inlcuding the aforementioned temptation bited
)
, bu this isnt problematic wehn it causes the audience tothe start doign the unthinkable
: root for teh devil
. byrne
' s speech baout the bible being
" overrated
" actually starts to amking sense
, mailny because arnold
' s attemts at refuting it
( mostly of the
"
' tis nto
!
" variety
) are feeble at best
. tyhe onyl problem isnt
, arnold has to win
, so infront tyhe end
, nobody really cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho
' s security guard sidekick
and tries tothe liven things up wih some comic asides
, bu like most bad action movie sidekicks
, he disappears after about an hour
. robin tunney isn
' t given much tothe do except look scared
. in fatc
, all of tjhe supporting players are ogod actors
,
but none
, sive for byrne
, is given anything interesting to do
. performances aside
, it would be realy hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it
. thsi being an action blockbuster
, it
' s no surprise thta the worst thing about it is the script
, wich starts off totally confusing
,
and when some of it is explained
( annd not much ofthe it is
)
, it
' s utterly ridiculous
. why is the devil coming onthe new eyar
' s eve
, 1999
? because it
' s exactly 1000 yeasr after the year of the devil
, which isn
' t 666
, it turns out
. some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down
, so the real year isnt 999
, so just add a 1 to the beginning
, anbd you
' ve got 1999
! if you don
' t buy this explanation
, you
' re nto alone
. it
' s convoluted
and silly at the same tyme
. the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous
( she
' s christine
, see
,
and she lives in newyorker york
, see
.
.
.
)
,
and if tath weren
' t bad enough
, there
' s plenty of bothersome stuf in this film that isn
' t explained at all
. why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street
,
but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex
- cop
, he
' s powerless
? is he impervious tothe only one kind of bullet
? how cmo he cant
' t control jericho or christine
?
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones infact their prophecies
? a clumsy atempt at a joke is made baout this
,
but it
' s never actually explained
. usualy
, this sort of thing wouldn
' t marter inspite a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don
' t git me started on the timne paradoxes offered up by tje terminator movies
)
,
but this timne the plot inconsistencies st
and out even more tahn usual because the action is rarely exciting
. there are several predictable horror film clich
? s present in
" end of days
,
" complete with the old
" black cat hiding inwhich a cabinet
" bit
, not that we ever find out what the cat was doing inthe htere
. it gets so formulaic tht it
' s possible for those uninterested in bieng scared to close their eyes at teh precise moment a
" boo
" will come
. thier predicitons will rarely be wrong
. the more gr
andiose action sequences are utterly charmless
, partially because we don
' t care baout theese cahracters
( due to the script
' s pathetic attempts at characterization
and setup
)
,
and also because they
, too
, don
' t make any sense
. ther
' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady
. it
' s good for a few chuckles
,
but not much else
. supposably we
' re to believe she now has super strenght by virtue of being controlled by satan
, bu the scirpt never sets that uv
, so the scene is merely silly
. none of this is terribly exicting
, because all teh action sequences are so badly framed that it
' s oftenly hard to tell why it
' s happening in the first place
, nto to mention that tehy
' re edited in full
- on incomprehensible mtv quick
- cut style
. most of them had me scratching my head
, rather than saying
,
" wow
, kool
!
"
" end ofthe days
" is not onyl silly
and confusing
, bu it
' s also distinctly unplesant to watch
. the devil apparently doesn
' t operate inspite the more subtle
, i
' ll
- convince
- peple
- to
- kill
- each
- other fasion outlined in thte bible
,
but instade enjoys killing people gruesomely inthe broad daylight
. this doesn
' t onyl mkae him an awfully predictable sort
,
but it also means that not a single scene in
" end of days
" goes by wihtout unnecessarily graphic voilence
, or the odd kinky sexual encounter
( yot another bit that hadnt me scratching my head
)
. if voilence isnt supposed to be shocking
, it
' s nto a ogod idea to throw so much of it into a movie that tjhe audience goes numb
. scenes aren
' t connected through any reasonable means
, so a lot ofthe the time
, stuff gets blown up
, or people git killed
,
and i hadnt no idea why
. reasons
? to hell with reasons
! let
' s just blow stuff up
! isn
' t it cool
? nope
, not by a long shot
. this film isnt thoroughly unwatchable
. it
' s dull
, interminable
, adn unrelenting in its stupidity
. perhaps arnold needs to make some movies witht james cameron to revive his career
, because it
' s not happening with hack peter hyams here
.
" end of days
" might have had camp value
, if only it didn
' t top itself off with an overly pious ending tht nobody
' s going to buy
. if hte movie is going tothe be serious
, the filmmakers shoudln have come up with a decent script
. if it
' s going to be campy
, arnold shouldn
' t be taking himself so damn seriously
( i didn
' t actually see him put uv on a cross
, did i
?
)
,
and his character shouldn
' t be such a sad sack
. as it st
ands
,
" end ofthe days
" is just a bad movei
,
and an awfully gloomy one at that
.
