adn i thougth
" stigmata
" would be yhe worst religiously
- oriented thriller released this yearm
. turns out i ws wrong
, because hwile
" stigmata
" was merely boring
anbd self
- important
,
" end ofthe dyas
" is completely inept on all fronts
. it ' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. for a guy liek me who growed up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it ' s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up
. for the first time iin recent memory
, an arnold action movie
(
and
" batman
& robin
" doesn ' t count
) is no fun at all
.
" end of days
" is a major stinker
. the movie opens in vatican city
, 1979
. some cathlic priests haev observed an ancient prophecy
, which syas that a girl will be born on tath night that satan wiull have targeted for impregnation
. if he impregnates her between 11
and midnight on december 31
, 1999
, the world wiull be destroyed
. the pope orders protection of this girl
,
though some priests belieev she ought to be killed
. in new york
, tath very nigth
, a girl is born tothe fullfill the prophecy
. twenty eyasr later
, we meet jericho cane
( schwarzenegger
)
, a suicidal ex
- cop with a drinking problem
. now working as a security guard for hire
, he is protecting a local businessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who is accually possessed by tje devil
. an assassination attemp onthe the buisnessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine
( including ownership of the same music box
, aparently
)
, jericho swears to protect her against the devil
and the faction of priests looking to kill her
. there are so many problems with this film it ' s hard to know where to begin
,
but how about starting with the consept
? casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with
. schwarzenegger is a persona
, not an actor
, so puting him inaddition a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea
. arnold hasnt niether the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions
. in other words
, trying to give him dimension ws a misteek
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis could have played this role
( htey ' ve all plyed noble
and flawed heroes
)
,
but not schwarzenegger
. there are several scenes that attept to establish jericho ' s character
; one hasnt him contemplating sucide
, another crying over teh loss of his wief
and daughter
,
anbd even oen in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine ' s location by offering him his old life back
. none ofthe theese scenes really work
, beacuse arnie isn ' t up tothe the task
. the filmmakers would have beeen better off making jericho a storng
, confident character
( like the terminator
, for exemple
)
, hte likes of wich schwarzenegger has excelled infront before
. this noe isn ' t at all believable tje way arnold plays him
. the supporting casted tries their hardest
,
annd onyl gabriel byrne makes any impact at all
. as the prince of darkness
, he ' s suave
anbd confident
. he acts liek one would expect the devil to act
. the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense
( more on that later
)
and thast undermines him as a powerful villain
. byrne out
- performs arnold in every scene they have together
( including the aforementioned temptation bit
)
,
bu thsi is problematic when it causes the audience to strat doing the unthinkable
: root fo the devil
. byrne ' s speech about the bible being
" overrated
" actualyl starts to make sense
, mainly because arnold ' s attemts at refuting it
( mostly ofthe the
" ' tis nto
!
" variety
) are feeble at best
. the only probelm is
, arnold has to win
, so in teh end
, nobody really cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho ' s security guard sidekick
and trys to liven thigsn uv with some comic asides
,
but like most bad action movie sidekicks
, he disappears after about an hour
. robin tunney isn ' t given much to do except look scared
. infront fact
, all of the supporting players are good actors
,
but none
, sive for byrne
, is given anytying interesting tothe do
. performances asside
, it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it
. this being an action blockbuster
, it ' s no surprize thta the worst thing about it isnt the script
, which starts off totally confusing
,
and when smoe of it is explained
(
and nto much of it is
)
, it ' s utterly ridiculous
. why is the devil coming on new yera ' s eve
, 1999
? because it ' s exactly 1000 years after the year of tyhe devil
, which isn ' t 666
, it turns outloud
. some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down
, so teh real year is 999
, so jsut add a 1 tothe thge begginning
,
and you ' ve got 1999
! if you don ' t buy this explanation
, you ' re not alone
. it ' s convoluted
and silly at the same time
. the method by wich jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous
( she ' s christine
, see
,
and she lives infront new york
, see
.
.
.
)
,
and if that weren ' t bad anough
, ther ' s plenty of bothersome stfuf inwhich this film tyhat isn ' t explained at all
. why can satan kill everyone he passes on the strent
,
but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex
- cop
, he ' s powerless
? isnt he impervious tothe only one kind of bullet
? how come he can ' t control jericho or christine
?
and how doed those gregorian monks deal with tiem zones in their prophecies
? a clumsy attempt at a joke isnt made about this
,
bu it ' s never actually explained
. usually
, this sort ofthe thnig wouldn ' t matter in a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don ' t get me started on the time paradoxes offered uv by the terminator movies
)
,
bu this timne tyhe plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action isnt rarley exciting
. there are several predicatble horror film clich
? s present in
" end ofthe dyas
,
" complete wtih the old
" black cat hiding in a cabnet
" bit
, nto that we ever find out whta the cat was donig in there
. it gets so formulaic taht it ' s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close thier eyes at the precise moment a
" boo
" will come
. theri predicitons will rarely be wrong
. tje more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless
, parshally because we don ' t care about these characters
( due to the script ' s pathetic attempts at characterization
and setup
)
,
and also because htey
, too
, don ' t mkae any sense
. there ' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady
. it ' s good for a few chuckles
,
but nto much alse
. supposedly we ' re tothe believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan
,
but the scirpt never sets that up
, so the scene isnt merely silly
. none of htis is terribly exciting
, because all the acation sequences are so badly framed tht it ' s often hard to tell why it ' s happening inthe the first place
, not to mention thgat they ' re edited in full
- on incomprehensible mtv quick
- cut sytle
. most of them had me scratching my head
, rather than saying
,
" wow
, cool
!
"
" end of dyas
" is not only silly
and confusing
,
but it ' s also distinctly unplesant tothe watch
. yhe devil apparently doesn ' t operate in the omre subtle
, i ' ll
- convince
- peple
- to
- kill
- each
- other fashon outlined in the bible
,
but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight
. this doesn ' t only make him an awfully predictable sort
,
but it also means that not a single scene in
" end of dyas
" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violentce
, or the odd kinky sexual encounter
(
yot another bit that had me scratching my head
)
. if voilence is supposed tothe be shocking
, it ' s not a good idae to throw so much of it inot a movie thyat the audience goes numb
. scenes aren ' t connected through any reasonable means
, so a lot of hte time
, stuff gets blown up
, or people git killed
,
and i hadnt no idea why
. reasons
? to hell wih reasons
! let ' s just blow stuff up
! isn ' t it cool
? nope
, nto by a long shot
. this film is thouroughly unwatchable
. it ' s dull
, interminable
,
and unrelenting infact its stupidity
. perhaps arnold needs to make soem movies witht james cameron to revive his career
, baceause it ' s not happening wih hack peter hyams here
.
" end of days
" might have hadnt camp value
, if onyl it didn ' t top itself off with an overly pious ending thyat nobody ' s goign to buy
. if tghe movie is going to be serious
, the filmmakers should have come up iwth a decent script
. if it ' s going tothe be campy
, arnold shouldn ' t be taking himself so damn seriously
( i didn ' t actully see him put uv on a cross
, doed i
?
)
,
and his character shouldn ' t be such a sad sack
. as it stands
,
" end of days
" is jsut a bad movie
,
and an awfully gloomy one at that
.
