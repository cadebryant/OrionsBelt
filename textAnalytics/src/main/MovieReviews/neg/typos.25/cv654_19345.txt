you think that these people onyl exsist in yhe movies
, bu trust me
, they
' re as real as life
. i once talked tothe a guy who thougth tghe united states governement was putting satelites into orbit which could fry an individual person
' s brain with microwaves
.
then i sat in a room full of people who beleived that the government rigged state elections
. i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine ws an additive that cigarette companies put in theri products for the specif goal ofthe getting people addicted
. these people hadnt waht are known as
" conspiracy theories
"
- idaes about how unseen forces wrok to deceive
and controll tghe public
. a little imagination goes a long way
. iin richard donner
' s conspiracy theery
, jerry fletcher
( mel gibson
) isnt a newyorker york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theery about everything
. his latest
, that nasa is trying tothe kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle
, might sound outrageous to us
, bu is all inthe a day
' s work for him
. he combs tje newspaper
, looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings
- on behind the scenes
,
and ffrom there jerry draws his conclusions
. upst
anding citizen that he isnt
, he trys tothe convince alice sutton
( julia roberts
) of the justice deparment that the president must be warned
. lucky gal
, alice
, who met jerry when he saved her from a cuple ofthe muggers
and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since
. wqat she doesn
' t know isnt that jerry
' s interest iin her is far more than
, well
, professional
. he goes to great lengths to follow her around
and watch her in her own apartment
. bu when smoe secrt government types seem to take an interest in jerry
' s ideas
and his limited
- circulation
" conspiracy theory
" newsletter
, he finds himself in danger anbd inspite real need of alice
' s halp
. oney of the problems with conspiracy theory is thta it tries to pass itself off as an action
- thriller whn it seems to have neither a wohle lot of action
, nor a significant number of thrills
. part ofthe thsi is a result of the film
' s slow pace
. it takes forever to set up thte relationship between jerry annd alice
,
and even once that is over iwth
, the rest ofthe teh film seems tothe be a lot ofthe boredom that every once inaddition a while stops to tkae a break fo excitement
. at over two hours
, this film could ahev been significantly condensed
and had it
' s running tiome shortened by twenty minutes tothe half an hour
,
but even
then
, the action scenes would not be able to save the film
. instead of truly exciting
and engaging set pieces
, we
' re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite
" balck elements
"
: balck helicopter
, men iin black action suits
and body armor
, black vehicles
- you know the drill
. they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets
and weapons
,
but forthe some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories
and some chick with no training somehow manage tothe elude them eveyr time
. big deal
, we
' ve seen it all befor
. watching teh film
, i wished donner hadnt at least tried to uise a little immagination
,
but i was out ofthe luck
. now
, when i say it took forever to set up the
" relationship
" between jerry
and alice
, i completely mean what one person is relative tothe tjhe otehr
,
and not romantic involvement
. oh
, donner
and screenwriter brian helgel
and owudl like you tothe believe that by the end ofthe the movie
, the twpo main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love witht each other
,
but there seems tothe be no evidence of that ever occuring
. yuo see
, htere weere more sparks between gibson
and danny glover in the leathal weapon movies
( also directed by donner
) tahn between gibson
and roberts inwhich conspiracy theery
. the twpo just don
' t click
,
and when you throw iin a number of happenings that woudl cause alice to reject jerry altogether
( like finding outloud he
' s been stalking her
)
, thte subsequent attraction is absolutely forced
. the script infact general allso seems forced
, liuke someone sat helgel
and down
and forced him to write it
, thne took it
and forced it apon us
. dialog is undistinguished
and rether unmemorable
, to the point that i almost stopped listening
. even gibson
' s usual gift for ad lib couldn
' t punch up the film suffciently to raise my interest
,
al
though one of jerry
' s theories baout oliver stone was mildly amusing
. unfortunately
, much ofthe what
' s discussed in the film is not inherently importamt to whta
' s going onthe
,
but instade filler thyat starts out withthe potential
, bu ends up just being extraneous because it
' s never followed through
. for exemple
, jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station
. he even goes so far as to explain thast tyhe staion ws flooded at the time due to a water main break
( hence hte water in a subway station
)
,
and that the coroner shoud check the man
' s lungs for chlorine
. this is convincing enough to alice tht she seems to believe him
. you know what happens
then
? nothing
, zip
, nada
. noone folow
- up whatsoever
, so waht
' s the significance
? okay
, here
' s another one
. a couple of well known
( real life
) asssassans were found to have possessed copies of tyhe j
. d
. salinger novel
" the catcher inaddition tyhe rye
"
. jerry also has a bunch ofthe copies
. whenever he goes inot a bookstore
, he has tothe buy one
. leaving out the question of whther or not this mkaes jerry an assassin
, we
' re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assasin
. nto when we find out about his salinger collection
, not when he goes tothe the bookstore
, not later on when we get the answer to our first question
. the point becomes totally extraneous
. oh
, did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film
? yeah
, he plays this goverment psychiatrist named dr
. jonas who may or may not be a bad guy
. that
' s baout it
. forthe all teh presence this usually marvelous actro has
, he
' s nearly forgettable iin conspiracy theery
. ytou can just lump him in with the supporting players
, with tje exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of tyhe fbi
. tihs guy was realy likable
,
and i wish he
and his character had gotten more screen time
. okay
, here
' s my theery
. this really started outloud as a gerat film
, bu some of its jokes were actaully true
! the government came in
and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security
,
and htis was what was left over
.
