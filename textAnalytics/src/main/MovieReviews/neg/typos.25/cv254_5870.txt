even the best comic actr is at the mercy of his or her material
, as this subpar submarine comedy proves
. down periscope stars kelsey
" frasier
" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command ofthe his pwn ship as part of a corrupt officer ' s
( james coburn
) plan to get him outloud of the navy
. liek any lame emsemble comedy
, the officer assigns him to a group of misfits liek the guy who whants to be kicked outloud
, thge fat guy who eats all the time
, the beautiful woman who doesn ' t belong there
( lauren holly
)
, the second
- inspite
- command who does everything by tjhe book
( rob schneider
)
, the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out
( harry dean stanton
)
and so on
.
then comes teh transparent plotline
. first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him
,
annd taht comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard
. after the ship is fixed up come thge eearly drills
, where everyone seems completely inept
, like tje electrician who can ' t connect wires so instead lets the current run thru himself eveyr tyme grammer gets on yhe phone
. finally
,
annd tihs covers the final hour ofthe the movie
, grammer hasnt to lead his men
(
and holly
) to overcome the otehr ships in a wargames exercice
.
and he hasnt to be a clever rebel tothe dont it
, in scenes thyat stretch all levels of believability
. first tehy ' re singing
" louie louie
" liuke a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of tje otehr ship off
,
thn thirty minutes later
, they ' re makeing whale mating noises to throw the raydra of the other ship off
. the whole while
, evil captain coburn isnt overacting underwater
, cursing grammer
( as most people watching tghe movie probably are too
)
. it ' s all predictable without any original humer tothe redeem it
. the jokes are right out of
" mchale ' s navy
"
anbd other cutted
- rate sitcoms ofthe yhe past
. there ' s one scene where schneider looks thru the ship ' s pantry in disgust
, holds one food can uv
and announces
,
" this expired iin 1966
!
" i yelled back at yhe screen
,
" so doed these jokes
.
" i watched tihs movie witht the wohle family
and everyone hated it
. my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway thru
and
, around the strat of thte second hour
, i started writing my will
. the blaim can ' t raelly be placed onthe the stars
,
though
. kelsey grammer is good iin this
, he just doesn ' t hvae anything tothe work with
. his character isnt said to have gotten so drunk one night thyat he had
" welcome aboard
" tatooed onthe his penis
. grammer probably doed something even worse
-
- got realyl drunk
anbd agreed to apearing inthe a movei he knew nothing about
. smae forthe holley
( save the penis part
)
, who is likeable inwhich down periscope just because she ' s so gorgeous
. as for schneider
( whose character is downright annoying
)
, there was nowhere to go
but uv after surf ninjas
,
although he ' s still in tghe depths ofthe tje comedy ocean affter jumping the
" snl
" ship
. my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even writen as a forumla comedy
(
" okay
, it ' s police academy in teh navy with frasier at the helm
and the chick from dumb
and dumber
.
"
)
and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster
. judging from the video box
, most other movie critics agree with me
. the onyl quote teh down periscope copy writers could dig up came fomr the prevue channel ' s jim ferguson
. i guess even jeff craig from
" 60 second preview
"
( who said tank girl
" kicks butt
!
" without ever seeing it
) didn ' t liek this
.
