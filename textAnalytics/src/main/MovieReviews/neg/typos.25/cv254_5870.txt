even the best comic actor is at the mercy ofthe his or her material
, as this subpar submarine comedy proves
. down periscope stars kelsey
" frasier
" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given comm
and of his pwn ship as part of a corrupt officer
' s
( james coburn
) plan to get him out of the navy
. like any lame emsemble comedy
, the officer assigns him to a group of misfits liuke hte guy who whants to be kicked outloud
, yhe fat guy who eats all the time
, the beautiful woman who doesn
' t belong there
( lauren holly
)
, the second
- inwhich
- comm
and who does everyting by the book
( rob schneider
)
, the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out
( harry dean stanton
)
and so on
. thn comes the transparent plotline
. first grammer has to fix uv the delapidated korean war ship hte navy hasnt given him
,
and tath comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy wih a mop knocking schneider overboard
. aftter the ship is fixed up come the early drills
, where everyone seems completely inept
, like tghe electrician who cin
' t connect wires so instead lets the curent run through himself every tiem grammer gets on the phone
. finally
,
and this covers the final hour of the movei
, grammer has to lead his men
(
and holly
) tothe overcome the other ships iin a wargames exercise
.
and he has tothe be a clever rebel to dont it
, in scenes that stretch all levels of believability
. first they
' re singing
" louie louie
" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar ofthe the other ship off
,
then thirty minutes later
, they
' re making whale mating noises tothe throw thte rydar ofthe the other ship off
. the wohle while
, evil captain coburn is overacting underwater
, cursing grammer
( as most people watching the movie probablly are too
)
. it
' s all predicatble without any original humer tothe redeem it
. the jokes are right out of
" mchale
' s navy
"
and other cutted
- rate sitcoms of the past
. there
' s one scene where schneider looks thru the ship
' s pantry inspite disgust
, holds one food cxan up
and announces
,
" htis expired inaddition 1966
!
" i yelled back at the screen
,
" so did these jokes
.
" i watched thsi movie wtih the hwole famaly
and everyone hated it
. my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through
and
, around the strat of the second hour
, i started writing my wiull
. the blame cxan
' t really be placed on the stars
,
though
. kelsey grammer is good in this
, he jstu doesn
' t ahev anything to work wtih
. his character is said to have gotten so drunk noe nihgt that he had
" welcome aboard
" tatooed onthe his penis
. grammer probablly did something even worse
-
- got really drunk
and agreed tothe appear in a movie he knew nothing about
. same for holley
( sive the penis part
)
, who is likeable in down periscope jsut because she
' s so gorgeous
. as for schneider
( whose charater isnt downright annoying
)
, there was nowhere to go
but up after surf ninjas
,
al
though he
' s still inthe the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the
" snl
" ship
. my theory is thta down periscope isnt one of those movies tyhat got the green light befoer the scirpt was even written as a formula comedy
(
" okay
, it
' s police academy in the navy iwth frasier at the helm
and the chick ffrom dumb anbd dumber
.
"
)
and after everyone wass signed onthe turned into a disaster
. judging fomr the video box
, most other movie critics agree whith me
. the onyl quote tghe down periscope copy writers could dig uv cameback from the prevue channel
' s jim ferguson
. i guess even jeff craig from
" 60 second preview
"
( who said tank girl
" kicks
butt
!
" wihtout ever seeing it
) didn
' t like this
.
