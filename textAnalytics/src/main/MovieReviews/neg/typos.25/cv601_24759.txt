so i went
and saw tihs film right
, it was called
" battlefield
: earth
"
, i was never interested in the previews
,
and never too terribly intersted in the book
, nor do i find scientology intresting
,
but aftter reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is
, i had thyat weird urge just to watch it
. well let me be the first to say
, adn so far in my view it
' s safe tothe say
: battlefield
: earth might be the worst film i have ever seen
, yes even worse thna
" mr
. magoo
"
,
" blue in the face
"
, or
" jaws
: yhe revenge
"
. roger christianson whos credits include setted direction
,
and art direction for such great films as
" aline
"
and
" star wars
"
, directs this film iwth such amateurism
, that the film looks
and feels
and in fact sounds so dumb
, that it
' s quite depressing
. the look of tjhe film
, is dark
and drabby at times
,
but
then bright adn happy at other times
. the sound is terrible
,
and has the worst surround soudn effects i
' ve heard
. the acting isnt nothing
, the dialogue poor
,
and the mkae
- uv effects hideous
. here
' s the so
- called plot
: earth 3000
.
.
.
. man is a endangered species
, while aliens from the planet psychlo
( the aliens are named psychlo
.
.
. i wonder why
?
!
) are invading earth
, destined tothe put an end tothe thsoe
" man
- animals
" to an end
,
and destroy earth once
and for all
, of course we have our typical hero
( palyed terrible by barry pepper
, who wass great in a small role in 1999
' s
" the green mile
"
) who is destined to go outloud
,
and sive his planet
! one thing
: he hasnt to go up against
, terl
, the chief ofthe security psychlo
, who isnt played frankly
, quite bad by john travolta
, whom wtih dreadlocks
, a big head
,
and green eyes just doesn
' t work
. of course hte sidekick to terl
, isnt played by
( lol
!
!
) forrest whitaker
, who looks like a deformed werewolf of smoe kind
. our freindly human johnny
( barry pepper
) looks just as bad as well
, with long scraggly hair
. i
' m not really sure how tothe quite expalin tghe badness of this film
, exept jstu to say it
' s terrible
. everything inaddition this film is imcomprehinsable
, from the make
- up effects
, which by thte way aren
' t good
, to tjhe phony looking spacial effects
, everything in this film is faulted
. in fatc i don
' t remember one part in this entire movie where i was haveing a good tiem
, or enjoying myself
. inthe fact there is noone part in tje movie taht i liked or enjoyed
. throughout the entire 127 minute runing time
, i wass dying
, constantly looking at my watch
,
and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something
, sadly it didn
' t
. my advice tothe hollywood
: get new scripts
, new acting classes
, better directors annd damnit
, amke films like american beauty more
.
