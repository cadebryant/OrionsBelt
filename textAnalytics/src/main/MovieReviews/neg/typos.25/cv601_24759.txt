so i went
and saw htis film right
, it was called
" battlefield
: earth
"
, i was never interested inaddition the previews
,
and never too terribly interseted inthe the book
, nor do i find scientology intresting
,
but after reading adavanced reviews of how bad this film really is
, i had that weird urge just to watch it
. well let me be the firt tothe say
,
and so far in my view it ' s safe tothe say
: battlefield
: earth might be tyhe worst film i have ever seen
, yes even worse thna
" mr
. magoo
"
,
" blue inspite the face
"
, or
" jaws
: the revenge
"
. roger christianson whos credits include set direction
,
annd art direction for such grat films as
" alien
"
and
" star wars
"
, directs this film with such amateurism
, that the film looks
and feels
adn in fact sounds so dumb
, that it ' s quite depressing
. tyhe look of the film
, is dark
and drabby at times
,
but
then bright
and happy at other times
. yhe soudn is terrable
,
anbd has the worst surround soudn effects i ' ve heared
. the acting is nothing
, the dialogue poor
,
and thge make
- up effects hideous
. here ' s the so
- called plot
: earth 3000
.
.
.
. man is a endangered speices
, while aliens from the planet psychlo
( the aliens are named psychlo
.
.
. i wonder why
?
!
) are invading earth
, destined to put an end tothe those
" man
- animals
" to an end
,
adn destroy earth once
and for all
, of course we have our typical hero
( played terrable by barry pepper
, who was grat in a small role in 1999 ' s
" the green mile
"
) who is destined to go outloud
,
and save his planet
! one thing
: he has to go up against
, terl
, the cheif of security psychlo
, who is played frankly
, quite bad by john travolta
, whom with dreadlocks
, a big head
,
and green eyes jstu doesn ' t wrok
. of course the sidekick to terl
, is played by
( lol
!
!
) forrest whitaker
, who looks like a deformed werewolf ofthe some kind
. our friendly human johnny
( barry pepper
) looks just as bad as well
, with long scraggly hair
. i ' m not really sure how tothe quite explane the badness of tihs film
, except just to say it ' s terrible
. everything in htis film is imcomprehinsable
, fomr the amking
- uv effects
, which by tje way aren ' t good
, to the phony looking special effects
, everything in this film is faulted
. infact fact i don ' t remember one part in tihs entire movie where i was having a good time
, or enjoying myself
. in fact there is no part inaddition the movie that i liekd or enjoied
. throughtout the entire 127 minute running time
, i was dieing
, constantly looking at my watch
,
and hoping mabye hte projectioner would blow a bulb or something
, sadly it didn ' t
. my advice to hollywood
: get newyorker scripts
, newyorker acting classes
, better directors
and damnit
, make films like american beauty more
.
