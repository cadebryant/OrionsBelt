running time approximately 1hr 40mins reviewed by jack choo rating
: the movie starts with a rather se7en
- ish opening sequence
, rether cool
and sets the mood forthe things tothe cmo
. the story propels the audeince into a neo
- reality
; somewhat very close to conscious reality
but laced with weird tinges of blue
and red
. existenz is actually the name of a newyorker virutal
- reality gmae
. supposedly
, vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal
- drug infront thsi neo
- reality
.

*
*
( leigh
) is the ultimate game creator
and introduces her ultimate game
- exeprience in the form of existenz
. players are required to haev bio
- ports embedded in their spine
, which plugs tothe a game
- pod inspite order to enjoy the immersive experience
. during a secretive beta
- testing
- cum
- teaser meeting for htis newyorker gameboy
, an assasinations attept on
*
*
* life occurs adn she runs off with fellow bodyguard
*

( law
)
.
*
*
* isnt more of a realists than anytying else
, afraid that he
' ll lose reality if he begin to play these games
but
*
*
* requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz tothe check if the program is still fucntioning properly after the assasinations attempt
. as they soon disover
, htey are transported betweeen realities within existenz uncovering more thna they initially expected
. existenz has all yhe cronenberg
- gore that is expected of him
. even so
, this film is no
- where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners
. not even half as suspenseful as the commercially succesful tjhe fli
. existenz can probably be looked apon as his 90
' s verzion ofthe videodrome
, even so
, it is a poor follow
- up
. while in most of his famed films
, his penchant for gore alwyas hit the right onot with theme of hte film annd plot
. in existenz
, the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of tje film
and seem to be an act of over
- indulgence tahn anything else
. jennifer jason leigh anbd jude law
, both commendable actors
, looked aloof
and miss
- directed throughout the entire film
. the scripting
and acting barely puls the film out of yhe b
- grade actegory
. it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a relaly tight
- budget
and it seems that he h
andeled tht pretty well in tyhe production desgin
and values created for this film
( the opening sequence
,
though
, probablly formed a considerable portion of the budget
!
) which is actualy qutie good
. existenz is too predictable
and cliched inaddition theese times
. 10 years ago
, it would hve been anyother classic for cronenberg
. cronenberg fans
however
,
( those people who enjoy seeing firends getting queasy over mutilation on film
) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you
.
