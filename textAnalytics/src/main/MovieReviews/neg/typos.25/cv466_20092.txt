running time approximately 1hr 40mins reviewed by jack choo rating
: the movei starts witht a rather se7en
- ish opening sequence
, rather kool
and sets the mood for things to cmo
. the story propels the audiance into a neo
- reality
; somewhat very close tothe consicous reality
bu laced with weird tinges of blue
and red
. existenz is actually the name ofthe a new virtual
- reality game
. suposedly
, vr games are highly popular as is consdidered a legal
- drug in htis neo
- reality
.
*
*
*
*
( leigh
) is the ultimate game creator
annd introduces her ultimate game
- experience in the form of existenz
. players are required to have bio
- ports embedded in their spine
, which plugs tothe a game
- pod inaddition order to enjoy the immersive experience
. during a secretive beta
- testing
- cum
- teaser meeting forthe this new gaem
, an assassintation attempt on
*
*
* life occurs
anbd she runs off with fellow bodyguard
*
*
*
( law
)
.
*
*
* is more ofthe a realists thna anything alse
, afraid that he ' ll loose reality if he begin to play theese games
but
*
*
* requires his halp to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the programe isnt still functioning properly after tyhe assassination attempt
. as htey soon dicover
, they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more thna they initially expeced
. existenz hasnt all the cronenberg
- gore thgat is expected of him
. even so
, this film is no
- where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners
. not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly
. existenz cin probably be looked upon as his 90 ' s verzion ofthe videodrome
, even so
, it isnt a poor follow
- up
. while in most of his famed films
, his penchant for gore alwyas hitted thge right note with theme of the film
and plot
. in existenz
, teh gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film
and seem to be an ect ofthe over
- indulgence tahn anything else
. jennifer jason leigh
and jude law
, both commendable actors
, looked aloof
and miss
- directed throughout the entire film
. the scripting
and acting barely pulls the film outloud ofthe the b
- grade category
. it was obvious thgat cronenberg worked on a really tight
- budget
and it seems thgat he handled that pretty well in the production design
annd values created for this film
( the opening sequence
,
though
, probably formed a considerable portion of the budget
!
) which is actually quite good
. existenz is too predictable
and cliched in these times
. 10 years ago
, it would have been another classic fo cronenberg
. cronenberg fans
however
,
( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation onthe film
) should not give this film a miss as some form of apresheation cin still be offered by yuo
.
