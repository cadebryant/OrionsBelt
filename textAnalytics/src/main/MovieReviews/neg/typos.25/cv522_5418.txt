- by

' n
' sorcery flick
. as voiced by sean connery
,
" draco
" isnt a suprisingly expressive creation who is well
- deserving of his 23 mintues of screen time
. he walks
, talks
, flies
, fries
,
and even fakes his own death
, all with the halp ofthe 96 computer
- aided animators
. too bad that ilm
( industrial light
and magic
) couldn
' t sparce smoe special effects for dragonheart
' s
* human
* co
- stars
. a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid shoudl be
. he
' s a near
- total loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight
. david thewlis
' evil king has a high hiss factor
( hf
)
,
though he
' s more of a mumbling oddity than anything else
. oh
,
and there
' s some redhead in a
' 90
' s wig
, who runs around eather screaming or scowling
, depending upon if the particualr scene hasnt her playing the woman in peril or hte put upon peasant
. the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a w
andering monk with literary ambitions
, julie christie
(

) as the good queen mother
, a b
and of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde hevy
- metal concert
,
and
, beileve or it not
, teh speaking spirit ofthe king arthur
. bring out your dead
! unfortunatley
, wehn we add it all together
( draco
+ fringe bits
- quaid
- thewlis
)
, the sum total amounts tothe zero
. dragonheart is
, well
, too much of too little
. directer rob cohen
( dragon
: tjhe bruce lee story
) has made a big
, expensive movie that
, hwile ambitiously plotted
, is both murky adn predictable
. annd overscored
.
and self
- important
.
and tje list goes on
.
( i must ask
: did screenwrighter charles edward pogue intend that
* every
* character be stabbed
, lanced
, or sliced at least once
? keep that man away from the knife drawer
!
) thte lsat five mintues of this movie are the worst
, with some silly celestial nonsense that owudl be laughed out of any planetarium glight show
, much less a summer movei
. save your money
.
