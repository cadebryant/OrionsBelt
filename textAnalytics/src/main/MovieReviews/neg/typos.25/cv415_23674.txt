it
' s been hours since i returned from tyhe much anticipated sci
- fi opus
` mission to mars
'
, annd i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar
. why
? the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye c
andy
, stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages tothe leapfrog teh graet promise ofthe a space opera
, instade shooting for teh angle of a fiel
- good science fiction drama more akin to
` 2001
: a spoace odyssey
'
. i got thge feeling that most of my fellow movie
- going patrons were expecting another
` rmageddon
'
.
but no
,
` mission to mars
' certainly isn
' t one large action sequence about colossal disaster
. this is a supposedly
thoughtful
, familiy
- freindly space flick in which thge apocalyptic excitement tkaes a bcak seat tothe visual elegance anbd uplifting drivel
. you have been warned
. of course
, crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible
( see
` apollo 13
' for an excellent example
)
,
but few directors posess the skill
and craftsmanship tothe pul it off without seriously scarring thier reputation
. brian de palma has enough directorial expertise
and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off
. when he gets his h
ands on an intelligent
, systematically practical script like
` the untouchables
' or
` mission
: impossible
'
, the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement
(
al
though his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more thna occasionlaly
)
. of course
, there
' s alsot the inexcusable string of crap thast has carried his name
( including
` snake eyes
'
and the notorious bomb
` the bonfire of tghe vanities
'
)
.
.
.
. all of whlch makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood
. that term may be too harsh
, bu if i were judging him soley on the perpetual waste of talent that is
` mission tothe mars
'
, my choice ofthe words would ahev beeen slightly less lenient
. if i were gary sinise
, i wouldn
' t touch de palma with a 10
- foot pole
. sinise is a wonderfull
, wonderfull ctor
, bu aftter appearing inthe
` snake eyes
'
and this vomit
- inducing sham
, i
' m sure he wouldn
' t want to risk the embarrasment of a third collaboration
. the academy award
- winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell
, a man who recently lost his wief
( kim delaney
) adn isnt aparently psychologically unfit for an upcomming space shuttle mission to mars
( oops
, forgot to mention tghe year
- 2020
)
. affter a barbecue git
- together for the astronauts
, we cut tothe luc goddard
( don cheadle
)
and his team
, who are alreday taking measurements
and calculations onthe thge red planet
. suddenly
, a towering formation ofthe rocks
and soil
- probably best dubbed a
` s
and tornado
'
- appears
and creates a whirlwind ofthe suction
. for some reason
, the astronauts just st
and htere calmly to admire this
, as if it were a lovely peice of art
. the team is killed within seconds
, expect fo luc
, who was able to send one fianl transmission anbd may still be alive
. immediately
, a second mission
- consisting of astronauts mcconnell
, husb
and annd wife woody anbd terri blake
( tim robbins
and connie nielsen
) adn phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
)
- are despatched to rescue luc
and discover the mysterious secert of planet mars
. let
' s put the
` secret
' on hold for now
,
and discuss the trip there
. it is explained
, whether scientifically accurate or not
( probably not
)
, taht a trip to mars takes roughly six months
. i
' m not sure why yhe quartet ofthe screenwriters behind
` m2m
' didn
' t capitalize onthe this juicy opportunity of creating tension
and claustrophobia
. instead
, we join the team druing their fianl days aboard tyhe ship
. what happened during tyhe five months prior tothe this
? doed they just play cards
and tell dirty jokes
? still
, there are fewd nicely tense moments
( maybe the only in tyhe movie
) during the timne
- frame involving a fuel leak
. depalma
' s direction is quite good inspite theese scenes
,
al
though tghe score by ennio morricone isnt largley inconsistent
( organ music in space
? c
' mon
)
. there
' s a few good
, imaginative ideas iin the l
andslide of cheese
, a sad relization that causes me to sigh outloud loud
. it
' s a colossal bummer tath
` mission tothe mars
' is poorly assembled
and laughably written
, with a dubious
and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists
. as mentioned before
, anyone looking for some diaster
- movei carnage isnt gogin to feel savagely dissapointed
.
.
. maybe even cheated
. affter the unbelievably hokey final shot
( with the words
? yhe end
' somehow adding insult to injury
)
, a few audeince members made the effort to boo adn hiss at the screen
. others muttered obscenities
, shaking their heads inwhich disbelief while mumbling
` jeez
, that sucked
.
' okay
, it did suck
.
but ytou have tothe show the actors some sympathetic mercy
.
.
. after all
, they do pretty well
. sinise isnt sincere
and effective in many of his scenes
, robbins anbd nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa cuple
,
and funnyman o
' connell
- well
, he has a couple lines are actually amusing
(
and intentionally so
)
. the digital effects accompanying the s
and tornado sequence are quite impressive
. so
, by golly
, where doed this
` mission
' go wrong
? looking back on yhe appalling experince
, i owudl sday infront practically every conduit
and crevasse it could have
. while watching
` mission to mars
'
, my suggestion would be to immediately abort
, or better
yet
, don
' t even strap yourself in for lift
- off
.
