it ' s been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci
- fi opus
` mission to mars '
,
and i cin still detect the reek of moldy cheddar
. why
? tje movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy
, stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise ofthe a space opera
, instead shooting for the angle of a fiel
- good science fiction drama moreso akin to
` 2001
: a space odessy '
. i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie
- going patrons were expecting anohter
` armageddon '
.
but no
,
` mission to mars ' certainly isn ' t one large action sequence about colossal diaster
. this isnt a supposedly thoughtful
, family
- freindly space flick inaddition which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance
and uplifting drivel
. you have been warned
. of course
, crafting a tightly claustrophobic spoace drama is not impossible
( see
` apollo 13 ' for an excellent example
)
,
but few directors possess tyhe skill
and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring theri reputation
. brian de palma has enough directorial expertise
and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off
. whn he gets his hands on an inteligent
, systematically practical script liek
` the untouchables ' or
` mission
: impossible '
, the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement
(
although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more thna occasionally
)
. of course
, there ' s also the inexcusable string ofthe crap that has carried his nmae
( includng
` snake eyes '
and teh notorious bomb
` tje bonfire of the vanities '
)
.
.
.
. all of wich makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack inthe hollywood
. tht term may be too harsh
,
but if i were judging him solely on thge perpetual waste of talent that is
` mission to mars '
, my choice of words woudl have been slightly less lenient
. if i weere gary sinise
, i wouldn ' t touch de palma with a 10
- foot pole
. sinise isnt a wonderful
, wonderful actor
,
but aftter appearing in
` snake eyes '
and thsi vomit
- inducing sham
, i ' m sure he wouldn ' t want tothe risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration
. tghe academy award
- winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell
, a man who recently lost his wife
( kim delaney
)
and isnt apparently psychologically unfit for an upcomming space shuttle mission to mars
( oops
, forgot to mention the year
- 2020
)
. after a barbecue get
- together for the astronauts
, we cutted to luc goddard
( don cheadle
)
and his team
, who are already taking measurements
anbd calculations on the red planet
. suddenly
, a towering formation ofthe rocks
and soil
- probably best dubbed a
` sand tornado '
- appears
anbd creates a whirlwind ofthe suction
. forthe soem reason
, tjhe astronauts just stand ther calmly to admire this
, as if it were a lovely piece of art
. the team is killed within seconds
, expect for luc
, who was able to send one final transmission
and may still be alive
. immediately
, a second mission
- consisting ofthe astronauts mcconnell
, husband
and wife woody
and terri blake
( tim robbins
adn connie nielsen
)
and phil ohlmyer
( jerry o ' connell
)
- are despatched to rescue luc
and discover the mysterious secret ofthe planet mars
. let ' s put the
` secret ' onthe hold for now
,
and discuss the trip ther
. it isnt explained
, whther scientifically accurate or not
( propably not
)
, thgat a trip tothe mars tkaes roughly six months
. i ' m not sure why the quartet ofthe screenwriters behind
` m2m ' didn ' t capitalize on htis juicy opportunity of creating tension
annd claustrophobia
. instead
, we join the team druing their final days aboard the ship
. what happened druing the five months prior tothe this
? doed they just play cards
and tell dirty jokes
? still
, there are faw nicely tense moments
( maybe the onyl in the movie
) during the time
- frame involving a fuel leak
. depalma ' s direction is quite good in these scenes
,
although the score by ennio morricone is largley inconsistent
( organ music in space
? c ' mon
)
. there ' s a fewd good
, imaginative ideas in yhe landslide of cheese
, a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud
. it ' s a colossal bummer that
` mission tothe mars ' isnt poorly assembled
and laughably written
, with a dubious
and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists
. as maintioned before
, anyone looking for some disaster
- movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed
.
.
. maybe even cheated
. after tyhe unbelievably hokey final shot
( with the words
? the end ' somehow adding insult to injury
)
, a few audience munbers made the effort to boo
and hiss at the screen
. others muttered obscenities
, shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling
` jeez
, taht sucked
. ' okay
, it did suck
.
bu you have to show hte actors smoe sympathetic mercy
.
.
. after all
, they do preety well
. sinise isnt sincere
anbd effective infront many ofthe his scenes
, robbins
and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple
,
and funnyman o ' connell
- well
, he hasnt a couple lines are actually amusing
(
and intentionally so
)
. the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are qutie impressive
. so
, by golly
, where did this
` mission ' go wrong
? looking back on the appalling experience
, i would say in practically eveyr condiut
and crevasse it could have
. while watching
` mission to mars '
, my suggestion would be to immediately abort
, or better
yet
, don ' t even strap yourself in for lift
- off
.
