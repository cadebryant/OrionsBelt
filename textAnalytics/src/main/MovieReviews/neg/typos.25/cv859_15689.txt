in 1989
, directer edward zwick began his career iwth the powerful civil war drama
,
" glory
,
"
but since
then
, he hasnt made continuous disappointments
, to me at least
, with 1994 ' s
" legends of the fall
,
"
and 1996 ' s
" courage under fire
.
" those twpo films weren ' t bad
, jstu not vyre good
,
but with zwick ' s latest film
,
" the siege
,
" he has finally made one
.
" yhe siege
,
" is a modern
- day acation
- thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city
. investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
and frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
)
, who are firt hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it
. later
, a bomb goes off in a broadway theater
, killing even more
. they soon meet cia operative elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, who may very well hold tjhe key to the identity of thge arab terrorist
. there are smoe movies that simply don ' t need to be made
,
and
,
" the siege
" may very well be noe of them
. oh
, sure
, zwick thikns he is making a
" meaningful
" action film
, since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on tghe horrors of terrorism
,
but waht he really hasnt made is actaully no more substantial tahn
, sday
,
" die hard
,
" which also starred bruce willis
. tihs time
, willis is horribly wasted as a general of hte u
. s
. army
, who puts a state of martial law over nyc during yhe climax
. whatever points
,
" the siege
,
" earnestly tried to make
, weere obviously lost infront the translation from page tothe screen
, or maybe
, zwick never really had anytying serious to say in the first palce
. the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical
, jstu as womens were in the receet
,
" john caprenter ' s vampires
,
" by placing them all in the category of
" bad guys
.
"
" thge seige
,
" countains three fine actors
-
-
- washington
, bening
,
and shalhoub
-
-
-
but washington isnt sticked with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development
. bening has slightly more to do
,
and hasnt an intriguing character tothe owrk with
, while shalhoub pretty much steals the show
, even
though
, again
, he hasnt no real character
. by the climax of
,
" the siege
,
" wih washington giving a sergon tothe willis on the so
- called
" message
" of the story
, i felt like i had wandered inot a sequel tothe
,
" onthe deadly ground
,
" inaddition which steven seagal gave a 10
- minute sprech at the end about preserving tyhe environment
.
" the isege
" is constanly hevy
- handed
, not entertaining or insightful
,
and just goes tothe prove thta not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay
.
