in 1989
, director edward zwick began his carreer with the powerful civil war drama
,
" glory
,
"
but since
then
, he has made continuous disappointments
, to me at least
, wih 1994
' s
" legends of the fall
,
" annd 1996
' s
" curage under frie
.
" those two films weren
' t bad
, just not very ogod
,
but with zwick
' s latest film
,
" the siege
,
" he has finally made one
.
" teh siege
,
" is a modern
- day action
- thriller that focuses on terrorism that isnt sweeping through new york city
. investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
and frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
)
, who are first hit by tjhe ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it
. later
, a bomb goes off in a broadway theater
, killing even more
. they soon meet cia operative elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, who may veyr well hold the key to tyhe idenity of the arab terroist
. there are some movies tht simply don
' t ened to be made
, annd
,
" the siege
" may very well be one of them
. oh
, sure
, zwick thinks he is making a
" meaningful
" action film
, since he has added lots ofthe exposition scenes in which the audience isnt basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism
,
but what he realyl has made is actually no more substatial thna
, sday
,
" die hard
,
" which also starred bruce willis
. this time
, willis is horribly wasted as a general ofthe the u
. s
. army
, who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax
. whatever points
,
" tjhe siege
,
" earnestly tryed to make
, were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen
, or maeby
, zwick never really had anything serious to say iin thte first place
. the role of teh arab community isnt offensively stereotypical
, just as women were in the reccent
,
" john caprenter
' s vampires
,
" by placing them all in thte category of
" bad guys
.
"
" the siege
,
" countains three fine actors
-
-
- washington
, bening
,
and shalhoub
-
-
-
but washington is stuck with a charachter that containes not an ounce ofthe even remote development
. bening has slightly more to do
, anbd has an intriguing character tothe work witht
, while shalhoub pretty much steals the sohw
, even
though
, again
, he has no real character
. by the climax of
,
" yhe sigee
,
" with washington giving a sermon to willis on tyhe so
- called
" message
" of the story
, i felt like i had w
andered inot a sequel tothe
,
" on deadly ground
,
" inwhich whic steven seagal gavey a 10
- minute speech at the end about preserving the environment
.
" the siege
" is constantly heavy
- h
anded
, not entertaining or insightful
,
and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay
.
