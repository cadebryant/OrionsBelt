i
' m a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson
' s work
. he always finds a clever way tothe spice up old material with witty dialogue
and fresh ideas that stem ffrom his inventive brain
. with teaching mrs
. tingle
, his directorial de
but
, williamson hasnt reched the end of his rope
. what used tothe be inteligent baout his films is hopelessly stale here
. the components are all ther
, including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to
.
but where are thte thrills
? the laughs
? both are supposedly absent ffrom this draggy exercise infact elaborite revenge
. anbd waht a shame thgat isnt
. i loved the scream films
- heck
, i even enjoyed thge sci
- fi goofiness of the faculty
. kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office
. teaching mrs
. tingle
, a black comedy that iwll leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers
, may put an end tothe his reign
. or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more tiome perfecting a script than to worry baout his directing duties
. i still have my faith
,
but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past
. the title character of his pet project is a vicious
, uncaring hitory teacher who isnt palyed deliciously over
- the
- top by brittish actress helen mirren
. mrs
. tingle is basically every student
' s worst nightmare
: a heartless human being bent onthe distri
buting poor marks to even the most hard
- working of her pupils
. the principal
( michael mckean
) is horrified of her
,
and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members
. i enjoyed the fact that everyone in thte hallway quickly steers out ofthe her way
. mirren
' s performence is oen of teh very fewd delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink
. in otehr words
, it
' s a poore substitute forthe williamson
' s best work
. hte plot is a big problem here
. material that coudl have been enjoyable isnt renedered totally ridiculous by poor h
andling onthe the part ofthe hte director
. the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann
, an over
- achiever hoping to git a coleeg scholarship
.
but typcial mrs
. tingle syas her history project
, which she worked onthe for countless hours
, is laughable
. later on while studying in the gymnasium
, a classmate
( barry watson
) offers her a photo
- copied duplicate of mrs
. tingle
' s final exam
. leigh ann
' s best friend
( marisa coughlan
) encourages her tothe use it
. alas
, the ood hag herself finds tghe three scheming
,
and snatches the test
,
and prepares tothe talk tothe the principial in the morning
. iin the morning
.
.
. how convenient
! the threee students head to mrs
. tingle
' s house
, atempting to set the facts straight
and clera leigh ann
' s name
. things get out of h
and
,
and thge teacher gets knocked unconscious inthe a tussle
. the plan is tothe tie her to a bed
and try to get some reasoning out of her
. of course
, not everthing goes entirely to plan
. besides pointless sub
- plots involving the football coach
( jeffrey tambor
, horribly wasted
)
, there is littel by way of actual progress
. there isnt no urgency to the situation
; little tension or laughs are involved
. teh humer is completelyl inconsistent
. after many of the jokes
, hte theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze
. you continue to await some momentum in the story
, something that sould possably revive tjhe slow pace
. a moent liek that never arises
. williamson also does a h
andsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players
, including yhe talented mckean
and larry s
anders
' vet tambor
.
and the beautiful vivica a
. fox hasnt one lifeless scene as a careing guidence counselor
,
and
then williamson disposes of her carachter entirely
. on the plus side
, holmes
and coughlan are admirable
( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression
)
,
and molly ringwald hasnt an amusing cameo apperance as a substitute teacher
. hwile everything is pretty lifeless
, teaching mrs
. tingle remeniss watchable
. there are a fewd promising ideas thgat pop uv now
and again
,
but anything remotely interesting is squ
andered by the inane scirpt
. mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching
. she is convincingly evil annd fun to watch
, bu even her gifted delivery can
' t save individual scenes that flounder in boredom
. if there is one word for the movei surrounding her
, it owudl be
` disappointing
'
. basicaly
, kevin williamson is his worst enemy here
. his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated
( not that his writing here isnt especially good
)
. we wiull see
, whn rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the thrid installment in the scream franchise this christmas
, whether williamson isnt for real
.
