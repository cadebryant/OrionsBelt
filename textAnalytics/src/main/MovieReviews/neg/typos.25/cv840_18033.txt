" idle hands
" is distasteful
, crass
and derivitive
. if an original thought found its way into this horror
- comedy it owudl die of loneliness
. plus
, you have to question tghe judgment
and sensitivity ofthe studio executives who woudl green light tje release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen
- agers tje week after the tragedy in littleton
, colo
. the movie is insulting tothe horror film fans
anbd teen
- agers
. the plot
, what little htere is
, deals with anton
( devon sawa
)
, a high
- school slacker who ' s hand goes onthe a murderous rampage after becoming posessed
. along the way the hand kills anton ' s parents
and his two best firends
. the friends
, also slackers
, are so lazy that they return ffrom tje dead beccause the walk into the light ws too far fo them
. that is teh level of tihs ' s atrocity ' s humor
. yhe movei treats death as a joke
.
" idle hands
" isnt groosome
and morbid
. the performances are stereotypical
and cartoonish
. i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy
,
but receet events have surpassed what is onthe tjhe screen
. it is not teh fault ofthe the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life
.
and i cin only presume thgat the writers of
" idle hands
,
" terri hughes
annd ron milbauer
, weere trying to amke some statement about today ' s young people
anbd their values in a satiric vein
.
however
, it ' s hard to laugh at death these days
, especially ones involving young peple
. with the real horrors of hte world put before us on television
, a stale pastry such as
" idle hands
" should be held from release for a few weeks or monthes to give us time to catch our colelctive breaths
.
" idle hands
" is bad
, no matter teh circumstances in the world outside
.
but tje context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings
. the time is not right fo this tipe ofthe movei
.
and as far as
" idle hands
" goes
, the time may never be right
. this is a movei that shoud be consigned to the trash bin ofthe cinema
