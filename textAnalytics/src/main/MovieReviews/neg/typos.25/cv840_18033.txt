" idle h
ands
" is distasteful
, crass
and derivative
. if an original
thought found its way into this horror
- comedy it owudl die of loneliness
. plus
, you have to question the judgment
and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light tjhe release of a movei dealing iwth the slaughter of innocent teen
- agers the week after hte tragedy in littleton
, colo
. the movie is insulting to horror film fans
and teen
- agers
. the plot
, what little ther is
, deals with anton
( devon sawa
)
, a high
- school slacker who
' s h
and goes on a murderous rampage after becomeing possessed
. along the way the h
and kills anton
' s parents
and his two best friends
. the friends
, also slackers
, are so lazy that htey return from the dead because tje walk into yhe light was too far for them
. that is the level of this
' s atrocity
' s humer
. the movie treats death as a joke
.
" idle h
ands
" is gruesome
and morbid
. tghe performances are stereotypical
and cartoonish
. i realize this is supposed tothe pass fo comedy
, bu recent events hvea surpassed wqat isnt onthe thte screen
. it isnt nto the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life
.
and i can onyl presume that the writers of
" idle h
ands
,
" terri hughes
and ron milbauer
, were trying tothe make some statement about today
' s young people
and their values inspite a satiric vein
.
however
, it
' s hard to laugh at death these days
, especially ones involving young people
. with tyhe real horrors of tghe world put before us on television
, a stale pastry such as
" idle h
ands
" should be held from realease for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths
.
" idle h
ands
" isnt bad
, no matter the circumstances in tyhe world outside
.
but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings
. tyhe time isnt nto right for this type ofthe movie
.
and as far as
" idle h
ands
" goes
, the time may never be right
. this is a movie that shoud be consigned to thte trash bin of cinema
.
