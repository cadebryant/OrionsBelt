tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove thgat she did not kill her spouse
. the fugitive
? not quite
? this is the plot fo double jeopardy
, another fugitive copycat wihtout teh action
, excitment
,
and good acting that yhe original hadnt
. there are other slight differences besides one movei being bad
and the other good
; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall
, clever huh
? oh annd tjhe fugitive ashley judd was framed by her pwn husban
( bruce greenwood
) who needed tothe collect two million dollars in life insurence money not a one armed man
. both movies are on video
. make the wise choice
and pick the fugitive
. htere are so many flaws in double jeapardy
, it is laughable
. while serving time in prison
, libby parsons
( judd
) dicovers that she cin never be charged forthe committing tyhe smae crime twice
. learning that her husb
and is still alive
, she decides tothe serve her time inaddition prison
, fidn him
, retrieve her son
,
and kill her husb
and if neccesary
. wehn thte strict parole officer travis lehman
( jones
) st
ands in her way
, libby decides to break thge rules
( who knows why
?
) anbd continue her plan
, despite the fact that if she gets caught
, she
' s going back to jail
. director bruce beresford spends way too much timne trying tothe convince tyhe audience that libby misses her son
. every other scene
, we are given a shooted of libby staring
and crying at his picture
. in an acation movie like this
, valueable time wasted on theese shots tkaes away more opportunities for libby to get up annd dont something
. all that is needed in this type ofthe movie is a short scene in whitch libby tells herself or a friend
" i miss my son
.
" nothing more
, nothing less
. dr
. kimble of tyhe fugitive didn
' t look at one picture of his dead wife
, his primary concern was to save himself
. libby at times shows thsi same determination
but nto nearly enough
. ashley judd
and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors
but if they continue tothe do movies liuke this
, they will be typecast for the rest of their careers
, kind of liuke their doomed co
- star tommy lee jones
. winning an oscar for thge fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired ofthe his i
- do
- my
- job
- whther
- they
- are
- innocent
- or
- guilty roles
. people still pay to see his movies anbd he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right
.
though i don
' t thiunk he will win anyother oscar again
. the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes ofthe libby parsons
. even if she wass excused for disobeying her parole officer
, the number of otehr crimes she commits hwile on hte run are too numerous to count
. borgwasy
, assault
, gr
and theft auto are some ofthe libby
' s slipups
. the message of yhe movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you
' re innocent of the major crime
. hopefully criminals won
' t use doublely jeopardy as a referene in cout for why they are innocent
. tath woudl just be plain stupid
.
