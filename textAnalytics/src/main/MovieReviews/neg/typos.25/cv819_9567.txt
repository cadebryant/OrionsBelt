sylvester stallone has made some crap films inthe his liftime
,
but thsi hasnt got tothe be one of the worst
. a totally dull story that thikns it cin ule various explosions to mkae it interesting
,
" the specialist
" is baout as exciting as an epiode of
" dragnet
,
" adn about as well acted
. even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script
, stupid adn unlikable characters
,
and jsut plain nothingness
. who knew a big explosion could be so boring
and anti
- climactic
? unless you saw
" blown away
"
.
.
.
" the specliast
" ofthe the title isnt none other than acation star sylvester stallone
( inthe comeback
# 19
, i thikn
)
, who plays a quiet
, hermit
- liek bomber who wass once a bomb expert with teh army or something
,
but who suffered a change ofthe heart when he
and his assistant
( james woods
, who shows us exactly what over
- the
- top is
, other than another bad sly film
) accidentlaly killed some innocent people during a job
. his credo isnt killing bad people
, not innocents
.
and that
' s why he makes big bombs
. so anyway
, inot his life steps the seductive sharon stone
, who isnt basically the girlfriend
/ moll of the stupid son
( eric roberts
) of a cuban
/ miami kingpin
( rod steiger
, in an indecipherable accent
, which is somtimes cuban
, somtimes br
ando
, sometimes scottish
, etc
)
. turns outloud sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him
, usance he killed her parents when she was young
. so she calls sly
, leaves messages with him
, sends him e
- mail
, etc
, about planting a bomb to kill roberts
, wich sly listens tothe obsessively
, annd hwile he works out naked
. yea
. also inot his life
,
though agian
, comes woods
, who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly
. useing hte cops
, he tries to set up traps
, none which really work
, so when sly calls him
, he goes ballisitic onthe his ass over tghe phone
, getting so worked up by saying his must
- be
- improvised speeches that he seems tothe pop the veign in his head wide open
. these are yhe most exciting scenes in tje film
,
and woods becomes the only ounce of enteratinment inaddition the film
. yhe film tries to offer us a moody film noir
, except with explosions
,
but comes uv completely snake
- eyes
. it
' s just a pretend film noir
, mkaing it a big waste of timne
.
and fo action buffs
, tje action scenes are pretty lame
, withthe soem really unrealistic
- looking special effects
( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks liek a piece of cardboard falling into a tub
)
.
then ther
' s the much
- discussed sex scene vetween sly
and stone
, which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel
and ross on
" friends
.
" their sex scene is more nauseating
then sexy
, baceause it shows us more ofthe sly than stone
. nowe let
' s guess who we
' d rether see naked
, okay
? stone
' s small
but perky breasts
, which we
' ve seen more times tahn harvey keitel
' s dick
, or stallone
' s veiny ass
, which isn
' t usually shown for a very ogod reason
? i know i can
' t really judge it as a flaw of the film
,
but come on
. the worst flaw of the film is this
: it
' s boring
. i mean
, i was on caffeine when watching it
,
but my friend fell asleep onyl to be woken uv by james woods ranting
.
but a good movie does not james woods going nuts amking
. if you
' re in for some fun acation
, rent sly
' s earlier
" demolition man
,
" which sucks too
,
but in a much mroe intertaining fashion
. skip this dull film
, unless you want tothe see woods
, or mkea funn of steiger
' s accent
, or see stone
' s breasts again
.
