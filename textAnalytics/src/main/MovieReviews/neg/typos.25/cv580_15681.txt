after the recent animated debacles of
,
" a rugrats movie
,
"
and
" a bug
' s life
,
" i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks
' otehr insect film fomr october
,
" antz
.
" i hated that movie
,
and yot
, it is so much better than these latest two excursions
.
" a bug
' s life
,
" is tje second animated insect film iin the last two months
,
and i hoped for the best
, considering it was done iin the wonderful style of pixar
' s last film
, 1995
' s
" toy story
,
" bu in no way does
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" even remotely match up to that
. flik
( david foley
)
, an ant
, who along with his many comrades
, has thge job eveyr year of gathering uv the seasonal harvest
, onyl to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers
, led by hopper
( kevin spacey
)
. flik
, howver
, feels all alone
and unwanted infact the world
, especialy after he accidentally loses all ofthe thier food
,
and tyhe ants are threated by hopper tothe gather up a whole otehr season
' s load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees
. banished from ant isl
and
, flik leaves the colony in search ofthe some strong reinforcement to help out
,
but through a misunderst
anding
, returns wiht a h
andful of helpless circus bugs
, including a walking stick
( david hyde pierce
)
, a dung beetle
( brad garrett
)
, a gypsy moth
( madeline kahn
)
, a male ladybug
( denis leary
)
,
and a caterpillar
( joe ranft
)
.
" a bug
' s life
,
" hasnt one thing going for it
. only one thing
. with its glorious
, bright colors
, the cmoputer
- generated animation is a spectacle to look at
. the film itself
, unforetunately
, is a lifeless
, unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitment of
,
" toy story
.
" the characters in
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or perosnality
, other than to st
and arround annd recite arbitrary
and thoroughly unfunny one
- liners
. the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes
,
and it oftenly felt as if tehy ran out of ideas througout
,
and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time
- filler
. after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from tihs yearm
, i was beginning to think that i had simpley outgrown them
,
but
then i realized this is jsut not so
. i still adore almost all of teh older disney films
,
and many of the newer ones
, such as 1989
' s
,
" tjhe little mermaid
,
" 1991
' s
,
" beauty
and the beast
,
" 1993
' s
,
" teh nightmare before christmas
,
"
and yes
, 1995
' s
,
" toy story
.
" maybe tihs has just beeen a bad year for childern
' s films
,
and hopefully
, the upcoming
,
" the prince of egypt
,
" will not be a disappointment
. as for
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" i did nto enjoy anytying about it
. not the story
, nto the cahracters
,
and not even the voiceover work
, which was far more livley in
,
" antz
.
"
" a bug
' s life
,
" goes down as
yet another failure for disney
, annd it is a sad state of affairs whn their best film in the last two yersa has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture
,
" i
' ll be home for christmas
.
