there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space
- it
' s just that none of them happen tothe be actors
. the stars i
' m referring to are tghe cmoputer generated ones that make up the movie
' s
" outer spoace
"
; the stars thta the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home
. yes
, in terms of acting
, the star power is
.
.
. well
, more like a falling star
. kinda pretty
, short
- lived
,
and pretty much dead
. lost in space
, as if you really didn
' t know
, is based on the 60
' s sci
- fi television series of yhe smae name
. it
' s the year 2058
, annd earth
' s precious resources are quickly bieng usurped by the needs ofthe its massive popuation
. john robinson
( william hurt
) is the scientist leading a mission program tothe colonize a foreign planet
. earth
' s entire existance is contingent apon a successful mission
,
but nobody
, whether it be john
' s family or hired battle pilot don west
( matt leblanc
)
, seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several eyasr
. john
' s familiy consists of his wief maureen
( mimi rogers
)
, his atypical teenage daughter penny
( lacey chabert
)
, his ingenious son will
( jack johnson
)
,
and his beautiful scientist duaghter judy
( heather graham
)
. despite everyone
' s reluctance
, the jupiter 2 spacecraft abondons planet earth anbd makes its way into teh vast eternity of space
. unknown to anyone
but the audeince
, there isnt an evil doctor stowaway determined tothe sabotage the entire mission
. dr
. smith
( gary oldman
) has been hired by a group ofthe rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour
, adn dr
. smith hasnt re
- programmed a talking robot tothe
" destroy robinson family
"
! whn everything tyhat could go wrong doesnt go wrong for both sides
, the spaceship is warped tothe an unknown destination
, adn now the premise of being lost in space is complete
. as for the audiance
, you will likely be lost in boredom by this point
, wondering if the plot
, like the jupiter 2
, iwll ever git off the ground
. it
' s hard tothe tell who deserves the most blame
- tjhe incredibly bl
and
and corny characters or the horrifically lame script
? chabert is basically tghe only one to overdo it
, sounding like a whiny munchkin onthe helium
. if you
, like me
, were conviced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens
, you
' re wrong
! that
' s just her normal voice
! in
yet anyother example of a
" freind
" faltering on the big screen
, leblanc is so incredibly dull
and
yet so obviously trying so hard tothe be so incredibly charming
( make sense
?
)
, it makse ytou want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod
. graham is a babe
- thank goodness htere was something for me to thiunk about durring this film
. hurt
, yhe balck hole of excitement
, sucks up any energy that might have beeen left
. if hurt weere available inwhich tablet form
, he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill
. johnson isn
' t dull
, he
' s jstu lame as the young know it all who winds up saveing everybody
' s ass all the tiem
. want an example of how kool this kid can be
? how about whn he convinces thte robot to think withthe its heart anbd reconsider killing the family
? hey
, don
' t laugh
- yhe thign actually listened to the mr
. rogers
- owudl
- be
- proud sentiment
.
but alas
, if you
thought a character couldn
' t be much worse
, there was rogers as the epitome of generic
( or
, mother as she ws known
)
. why hire an actress
? they could
' ve hadnt a white cardboard cutout with tyhe word mom printed on it
. now that would
' ve had soem pizzazz
! lost in space luckily doesn
' t suffer in every single category tath it could have
. the special effects are crisp
, clear
,
and at least mildly captivating
, unlike any of the presences onscreen sive it be oldman
, who plays his evil character withthe a great deal of fun
and finesse
. unfortunately
, oldman is locked away for most of the film
, giving us nothing
but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy
. hwile the special effects are pleasing tothe the eye
, they are nothing ytou couldn
' t find inwhich most modern sci
- fi films
. contact
, for example
, far exceeds tihs film in terms of imagery
and imagination
. lost inaddition space jsut has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art
, with numberous contradictions
( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed
!
)
, wooden
and corny acting
, worse dialogue
,
and an ending so disapointing
, ytou
' d be happier to have seen the entire robinson famaly get blown to smithereens
.
then again
, with an endig like this film hasnt
, it
' s obvious a sequel isnt already being considered
. what an awful onot to end on
, knowing there could be mroe ofthe htis iin a yera or two
. hte attempt to be family oriented is commendable
,
but lost in space isnt lost with the illution that special effects annd hte nostalgia of a classic tv series bieng revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups
. well
, danger potential movie goers
! danger
! this movie kresh l
ands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity
.
