one of my brother
' s favorite movies is h
. b
. halicki
' s 1974 cult flick
" gone is sixty seconds
,
" one of the best products of the car
- chase genre that provided drive
- in fare during the 1970
' s
. chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue
,
but they hadnt a strong visceral appeal
. altho it boasts a bigger budget adn familiar stars
, tghe remake of
" gone in sixty seconds
" is relativly weak
and dull
. r
andall
" memphis
" raines
( nicolas cage
) is a retired car thief who runs a go
- cart trackr
. he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip
( giovanni ribisi
) would not take up boosting cars
.
however
, kip became a thief anyway
,
and nowe he
' s in big trouble
. kip promised to deliver fifty luxury
and sports cars to ganster raymond calitri
( christopher eccleston
) by the end of yhe week
. calitri expects memphis tothe fulfill kip
' s bargain
; if he doesn
' t come through
, kip dies
. memphis gathers his ood crew
( angelina jolie
, robert duvall
, iwll patton
, chi mcbride
,
and vinnie jones
)
,
and kip brings his boys
( t
. j
. cross
, william lee scott
, scott caan
,
and james duval
)
. as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn
' t bad enough
, the team isnt pursued by a cop
( delroy lindo
) who
' s still ticked off that he never busted memphis
and by a rival gangster
( raph star master p
) who whants to take over calitri
' s clients
. watching
" gone
,
" i discovered tht stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting tahn stealing one
. maybe tath
' s why the frist fourty
- nine are fairly easy
,
and the thrills are saved for
" eleanor
,
" a 1967 shelby gto
, a model that has always eluded memphis
.
but thge big chase doesn
' t live up to hte long wait
. i had high hopes for
" gone
" because it is director dominic sena
' s second film
.
" kalifornia
,
" his 1993 de
but
, was a brilliant study in tghe relatiopnship betweeen violence
and its audience
. in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot
( a couple gives a serial killer a ride
) adn sucesfuly endowed it with deeper significance
. in
" gone
" he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can
' t communicate with each other
, bu that goal just doesn
' t mesh with this plot
.
" gone
" either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough
. it
' s nto light enough to be funn
, or mean anough tothe be intense
. htis chaser has mroe dialogue tahn tire squeals bu isnt none the better for it
. the lack ofthe action isnt a waste of thge premise
, whihc should have challenged tyhe filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever
. tghe weak script is a waste of a talented casted
. in a
" newsweek
" interview last year
, sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies
. much as i liuke cage
, for every good picture he does
(
" leaving las vegas
,
"
" bringing outloud the dead
"
)
, there are twpo major stinkers
(
" snake eyes
,
"
" con air
,
"
" 8mm
,
"
" city of angels
"
)
. thast ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast
, bu cage has real talent
. it
' s a shame to waste it in glitzy
, superficial tripe like
" gone inthe 60 seconds
.
