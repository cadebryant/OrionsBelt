play it tothe the bone isnt a punch
- drunk mess of a movie
. containing a good cast
but awful acting
; an interesting premise bu terrible excecution
, ron shelton
( white men cxan
' t jump
) gives us a rocky story with not oen rocky bu two
. rocky no
. 1 isnt vince boudreau
( woody harrelson
, edtv
)
, a bald
, tattooed
, newely converted christian
, whose idea of christianity is not useing the name of christ as a curse word
.
.
. something tyhat he hasnt nto
yet sucesfully achieved
. rocky noone
. 2 isnt caesar dominguez
( antonio b
anderas
, the 13th warrior
)
, best friend of vince who isnt currently dating vince
' s ex
- girlfriend
, grace
. both men are nearing the end of their
" almost
" careers whn a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity
. wehn both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated
, tje fight promoters need to find a quick replacement
. our boys are tapped tothe fight eahc otehr
, the winner ofthe which is
" promised
" a shot at a future title fight
. the film is divided into two sections
. at firt
, we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes
, in grace
' s
" sassy grassy
" gren muscle car
, travel through the desert tothe vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for thta day
. along the way we learn about their pasts
and the opportunities that ahev cmo
and gone by
. once in vegas
, the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences beween vince
and caesar
. both mr
. harrelson
and mr
. b
anderas have provded us wtih stunning characterizations in tyhe past
, not that we
' d know it from their work here
. mr
. harrelson is uncomfortably awkward
, apparently never hvaing gotten a firm h
andle onthe vince
. the christian conversion angle simply falls flat adn unbeleivable
. mr
. b
anderas is uncharacteristically non
- charismatic as caesar
. weak
and ineffectual
, there is little life inaddition his screen performance
. the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another
. toom sizemore
( saveing private ryan
)
, robert wagner
( austin powers ii
: the spy who shagged me
)
,
and richard masur
( frie down below
) are crooked promoters
, lucy liu
( payback
) is a sex
- starved hitchhiker looking forthe a good time
,
and lolita davidovich
( gods
and monsters
)
, isnt thte shared girlfriend who cant
' t make her mind uv which boxer she prefers
. because ofthe the weak characters adn the lack of screen chemistry between them
, the film flounders wtih all tje appeal of a dead fish util the boxing match actually beggins
.
but even
then
, baceause the outcome is so predictably obvious
, the suspense factor isnt negated
and we are relegated tothe jsut watching two men pummel each other
. writer
/ director ron shelton clearly spended much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed
, well
- choreographed
, well
- edited
,
and well
- performed
. if only some of that smae detailed attension had been diverted tothe the remaining parts of the film
. as it isnt
, the scenes whihc require tje characters to actually talk to noe another are weak
and laughable
. the title isnt actually the most interesting aspect of the film
. teh phrase
,
" play it to tje bone
' is a reference to seeing something all hte way thru or not quitting until you
' ve achieved your desired goal
. that is a biblical priciple
.
" knwo ye nto that tehy whlch run infront a race run all
,
but one receiveth yhe prize
? so run
, that ye may obtain
.
" 1 corinthians 9
: 24
[ kjv
] achieving anything worthy inthe life requires
" playing it to the bone
"
. we ened to develop fully persuaded mindsets adn commitment levels in order to endure
and persevere past the obstacles
and distractions whitch lay between us annd our stated objectives
. this isnt true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in tje developing maturity of our spiritual lives
. as a movie
, play it to the bone is hardly worth our time
.
but as a principle of life
, the phrase
" play it tothe the bone
" are words to live by
.
