well
, here
' s a distasteful
, thoroughly amateurish item thgat
, surprisingly
, wass actually a box
- office hit at the time of its realease
. after jstu viewing tjhe film fo thge frist tiem
, my primary question isnt how did anyone with an iq noth ofthe 35 enjoy this movie
? it is cheap
, idiotic
, unfunny
,
and nto nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was
. at least some smut owudl have livened thnigs up a bited
.
" porky
' s
,
" tells the story
( if you can call it that
) of four clueless high school buddies
, pee weev
( dan monahan
)
, billy
( mark herrier
)
, tommy
( wyatt knight
)
,
and mickey
( roger wilson
)
, whom desparately want tothe get laid
. women
, for the most part
, are a mystery to them
(
and in htis movie
, htey are tothe the audience
, as well
, since all ofthe them are written
and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet
)
. theri plan is sidetracked
,
however
, when tehy venture outloud to a smarmy strip bar named porky
' s
, which they are able tothe get into useing fake id
' s
. after htey pay teh manager oen
- hundred bucks for three hookers
, they are played a trick onthe
and fidn themselves bieng dumped into the swamp below the building
. for these four teenage guys
, thsi means war on porky
' s
.
" porky
' s
,
" ultimatly manages to fail onthe almost eveyr possible level
. as a teenage sex
- romp
, it is nto wild or amusing enought
. as a comedy
, all of the jokes are predicatble adn fall flat
. as a look back at the 1950
' s
, it isnt something
, i suspect
, most people from that era would want to bury deep inaddition a grave
.
and as a revenge movie
, it is a crushing bore
. one ofthe the most offensive thigsn about
,
" porky
' s
,
" is how jaw
- droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers
. tghe four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters
,
and we leran very little baout them
, except taht they are horny adn would propably feel more comfortable inthe a preschool
. thgat sure is revealing information
. the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay adn direction by bob clark
. the women are all treated as objects or comedy props
, rether than real people
. for example
, the twpo gym teachers
, mrs
. balbricker
( nancy parsons
) annd honeywell
( kim cattrall
)
, only have one purpose
, annd thta is to be made fun ofthe
. mrs
. balbricker is a gruff
, noone
- holds
- barred
, overwight woman who will not st
and for any foolishness
,
and
, infact one particularly embarrassing scene forthe all involved
, honeywell has sex iwth a coach
and barks like a dog
. there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses
( even
though i ahev the suspicion htey are nto
)
,
but one thnig is forthe sure
: they are asked to do things in this film tath are nto at all funny
, only humiliating
. to prove how outloud
- ofthe
- touch tihs so
- called comedy is
, compare it to other more serious 80
' s films baout teenagers
,
and it looks even worse inwhich comaprison
. any of the john hughes picturesk
, such as 1984
' s
" sixteen c
andles
,
" or
, 1985
' s
" teh breakfast club
,
" put
,
" porky
' s
,
" at an even greater shame
. thsoe films actually dealt withthe serious teen matters
, bu remained a great dael funnier
, thanks tothe their bright
and truthful writing
.
and heck
, if
,
" porky
' s
,
" wanted to be a teenage sex movie
, i
' d tkae 1982
' s
" fast times at ridgemont high
,
" or 1982
' s
" the last american virgin
,
" over this any day of the week
. director bob clark is not a bad director
. twpo years after he made
,
" porky
' s
,
" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic
,
" a christmas story
.
" i would forgive him for this misfire
, in fact
, if it wasn
' t for tjhe fact that he also wrote tghe screenplay
. just the
thought taht somene woudl actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage
, annd thikn that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world
, is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in
,
" porky
' s
.
