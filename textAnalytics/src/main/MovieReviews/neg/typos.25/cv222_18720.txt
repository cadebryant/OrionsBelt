synopsis
: an aging master art thief
, his supplier
,
and a young
, buxom security consultant are all not who they first apeared to be
( or are they
?
) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during thte millennimu
. comments
: this movei was boring
. plain
and simple
. entrapment shoud not have been boring
. it stars sean connery
, who can still carry an action film dispite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable anough film presence
,
and ving rhames
, ultra
- cool star of pulp fiction adn mission
: impossible
. it takes full advantage of the y2k coputer bug fears
( a current
" hot topic
" inthe tje news
) in its storyline
, which is setted at the end of 1999
. it has soem genuinely well
- staged action sequences
. so
, whta went wrong
? plenty
, unfortunately
. the major problem with entrapment is its script
. it has a been
- htere
, done
- that feel to it
. nothing seems particularly inventive or orginal
, so the whole movie lacks suspense
and drags
( it runs nearly twpo hurs
)
. the screenwriters
, for example
, periodically use a countdown to the illennium as a means ofthe transition between scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 days to thte millennuim
"
)
. this device wass used much more effectively in the overlooked sci
- fi film strange days
. the characters are not who htey appear to be at the beginning
, which isnt neat at first
but the divice wears thin once the umpteenth
" suprise
" revelation is made
. entrapment
, in other words
, relies too heavily on the audiance not knowing what each character
' s true motive isnt
, resulting inspite a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion
. the star power here is quite strong
,
but the viewer cxan
' t help
but efel the actors are wasted in thsi prodcution
. sean connery isnt given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames
' carachter seems like an after
thought
; he
' s not developed at all
. the camera zooms inspite frequentily annd leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones
' s tight wardrobe
. tihs
, inthe adn ofthe itself
, is not bad
, bu
, aftter a while
, it hasnt a juvenile fiel tothe it
. at least the species movies hold no bones baout the fact that they
' re exploiting the female body
. entrapment does the same under the thin disguise ofthe plot development
( sean connery suposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her
, in tights
, arc
and pivot around lazer beams
)
. the tagline for tihs movie reads
" the trap is set
.
" it sure is
, onthe those who spended money to see this movei
. entrapment really isn
' t that bad
; it is watchable
. i would suggest
,
however
, one waits until tihs is on cable or television to see it
.
