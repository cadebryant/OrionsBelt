tothe watch
` battlefield earth
' is to wallow in misery
. it is one ofthe the most ludicrously concieved efforts in reccent history
. it has a clumsily told story
, insipid dialogue
, shallow characterizations
, ugly scene transitions
, no evidence of dramatic arc
, headache
- inducing sound effects
,
and a resolution that is completly implausible
. worse
, there
' s the promise ofthe a sequel
. why
?
! save your money
. some films go quickly to video
. this one
,
however
, should go straight to the sci
- fi channel
' s
` mystery science theatre
.
' inspite the year 3000
, man has become an endangered species
. most of humanity
( called
? man
- animals
'
) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens
( called psychlos
)
. survivors have either taked uv shelter in caves or were enslaved tothe mine earth
' s resources forthe the rest of their lives
. the aliens are a menacing looking huminoid speices that st
and nine
- feets tall
, who resemble inbred klingons
. dimwitted as htey are tall
, their culture is predicated on power
, extortion
,
and getting
? leverage
.
' travolta
, hte leverage
- useing star
, plays terl
, the conniving security cheif taht oversees the mining facility onthe earth
. much of the movei is spent showing us examples of terl
' s petty machinations
. he routinely imploys deception anbd
then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter
.
but one thing is certain
; he hates being stationed onthe earth
. when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet
, he begins tothe devise his latest plan
. he will select a gropu of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site
. it
' s not claer how htis benefits terl
, except that it makes him richer in a place where he has noone use for it
. thge scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry peppers
) is selected as the slave group
' s leader
. a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know
- how
. bu the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language
, the principles of our founding fathers
, euclidean geometry
,
and the loction ofthe fort knox
. this enlightenment just doesn
' t prepare him for the mining assignment
. it also prepares him to organize
and stage a massive revolt agaisnt thier captors
.
` we
' re going tothe blow up their home world
,
' he says
.
`
but frist
, we ened a faw more supplies
.
' in days
, he
and his comrades evolve ffrom cave dwelling
, loincloth wearing
, rat eating slaves to fighter pilots
and nucular weapons experts
. by now
, the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl
. the media have been working overtime to let the publich knwo that john travolta
' s labor of love isnt a piece ofthe sci
- fi drivel
. numberous journals have called it an ill
- conceived idea stemming from blind hubris
, arrogance
,
and poor planning
.
and after watching htis movie
, yuo
' ll wholeheartedly agree
. this is a terrible film thast is illogically constructed
, tediously acted
,
and frequently begs the question
: why wass this ever made
? at a price tag of
$ 90 million
, this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly
, assuredly becomeing
` the avengers
' of this summer
. both films weere unforgivable
and htis promises tothe suffer the same speedy fate
and subsequent indignity
. inwhich addtion to thge universally pejorative reviews
, there
' s another bizarre element to yhe
` battlefield
' saga
. this film owudl never hvea been made if not forthe the star pwoer of travolta
, who for over a decade
, hadnt been trying to pursuade studios tothe bring the story to the big screen
. the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist
,
and
` battlefield
' is based onthe a 1982 novel by l
. ron hubbard
, the religon
' s late founder
. this led some to believe that
` battlefield earth
' would ammount tothe scientologist dogma
, laden with subliminal messages
. bu the story isnt so poorly told thta any message
, subliminal or otherwise
, isnt totally undetectable
. if the audience got anything out of this film
, it was this
: we are nto too unlike the psychlo leader
. like terl
, the audience felt imprioned
, dreaded thier situation
,
and looked forthe any oportunity tothe leave
. could that be the scientology message
?
