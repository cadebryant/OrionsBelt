a life less ordinary
( r
) while teh extremely peculiar a life less ordinary doens live up tothe its title
, a more apropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided
, for this confused
, confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle
, producer
andrew macdonald
,
and screenwriter john hodge
. at the core of this stange film is a fairly basic
-
-
and
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. after robert
( boyle regular ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writer of triachy novels
, is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corparation
, he kidnaps naville
' s
( ian holm
) spoiled daughter celine
( cameron diaz
)
and holds her for ransom
. the joke here is that celine isnt a willing victum
-
- her father threatened to cut her off financialy
, so she wants revenge
-
- annd that she soon becomes not only an accomplice
but the brains behind the scheme
, teaching the inept robert a hting or twpo about kidnapping
.
.
.
and
, ultimatly
( didn
' t we see tihs one coming
?
)
, love
. so far
, so medicore
. bu mediocre isnt better thna dreadful
, which tihs film isnt
, thanks infront no small part tothe the hodge
' s contextual frame fo the romance
. it turns out thyat god isnt displeased with the divorce
and rumatic breakup rate onthe earth
, so the cheif ofthe heaven
' s police
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches two angels
, o
' reilly
( holly hunter
)
and jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, to earth to hook up celine annd robert
-
- or lose their ange status
. this conceit might ahev worked if the ange dimension palyed an integral role in tyhe entire picture
.
but it could have easily been cutted without any clear loss to teh film
; as it st
ands
, it is simply a waste of time that distracts ffrom the romance at h
and
. not tyhat ther isnt much of a romance to begin with
. try as diaz
and mcgregor may
, celine
and robert are too one
- note to become very endearing cahracters
. celine is rich bitch
; robert is a dullard
. as such
, it is qutie hard for the audience tothe really connect with these two
-
-
then again
, they never seem to realyl connect iwth eahc other
. when celine
and robert strat to overtly act on their
" feelings
,
" it comes off more like something scripted thna anytying natural
.
but i am not exactly sure if boyle anbd comapany
' s point ws romance
; honestly
, i am not exactly sure what htey were trying to acompish
. boyle juices uv teh visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz
, bu it remains just that
-
- energy
, not energy in service of a story or even acting
. the casted seems lost
, especially hunter
, whose peformance isnt so adrift as to be baffling
.
and hten htere are the many eccentricities splattered onto tjhe film
: some violent confrontations involving thge angels
, who are not exactly angelic
-
- inthe fatc
, they end up staging their pwn ransom scheme
; smoe mystical hokum infront tghe climax
;
and a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much ofthe a life less ordinary is like being trapped iin indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks in the name of cool
. instead
, the film just gives quirky a bad name
. my best guess as tothe waht tyhe filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic
( yes
, misspelling intended
) whimsy
, which comes thru in only one scene
: an extended musical number where celine adn robert sing
" beyond the sea
" at a karaoke bar
. after a verse or twpo
, the cuple are magicaly dolled uv inaddition snazzy outfits anbd hairdos
, annd engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter
. the scene works not only becuase of its relative simplicity
but aslo baceause it does nto try too hard
, jstu relying on the innate charm of the leads
, alowing them to build a romantic rapport
. alas
, not nearly enough is built
, for this moent comes to an abrupt end
. i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh
and unique tothe movie houses
, bu sometimes even cleverness cin reach overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" different
,
"
but by the time the film wass over
, i wass clamoring for a life more ordinary
.
" i cin accept failure
. everyone fails at something
. bu i can
' t accept not trying
. it doesn
' t matter if ytou win as long as you give everthing in your heart
.
