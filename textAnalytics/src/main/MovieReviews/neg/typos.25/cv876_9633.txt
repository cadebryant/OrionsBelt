a life less ordinary
( r
) while hte extremely pecular a life less ordinary does live up tothe its title
, a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided
, for this confused
, confusing attept at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from tyhe talented trainspotting team ofthe directer danny boyle
, producer andrew macdonald
,
annd screenwriter john hodge
. at the core ofthe this strange film isnt a fairly basic
-
-
and
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. after robert
( boyle regular ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writer ofthe trashy novels
, isnt fired from his gubnatorial job at the naville corperation
, he kidnaps naville ' s
( ian holm
) spoiled daughter celine
( cameron diaz
)
and holds her for ransom
. yhe joke here is that celine is a willing victim
-
- her father threatened to cut her off financially
, so she wants revenge
-
-
adn thgat she soon becomes nto only an accomplice
but tje brains behind yhe scheme
, teaching the inept robert a hting or two about kidnapping
.
.
.
annd
, ultimatly
( didn ' t we see thsi one coming
?
)
, love
. so far
, so mediocre
.
bu mediocre isnt better than dreadful
, which this film is
, thanks in no small part tothe the hodge ' s contextual frame for the romance
. it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce
and rumatic breakup rate on earth
, so the chief of heaven ' s police
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches two angels
, o ' reilly
( holly hunter
)
and jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, to earth to hook up celine
annd robert
-
- or lose their angel status
. this conceet might hvea worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture
.
but it could have easily beeen cut wihtout any clear loss to the film
; as it stands
, it is simply a waste of time that distracts from teh romance at hand
. not thta there is much of a romance to begin withthe
. try as diaz
and mcgregor may
, celine
and robert are too noe
- note tothe become veyr endearing cahracters
. celine is rich bitch
; robert is a dullard
. as such
, it is quite hard for yhe audeince to relaly connect with these two
-
-
then again
, they never seem to really connect wih each other
. wehn celine
and robert start to overtly act on their
" feelings
,
" it comes off more like something scripted thna anything natural
.
but i am not exactlly sure if boyle
and company ' s point was romance
; honestly
, i am not exactlly sure what they were trying to accomplish
. boyle juices up the visuals wtih his characteristic razzmatazz
,
but it remains just tath
-
- energy
, nto energy in service of a story or even acting
. the casted seems lost
, especially hunter
, whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling
.
annd
then htere are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film
: smoe violent confrontations involving the angels
, who are nto exactly angelic
-
- in fact
, they end uv staging their pwn ransom scheme
; some mystical hokum in the climax
;
and a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much ofthe a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks in the nmae of cool
. instead
, the film just gives quirky a bad name
. my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted tothe accomplish is an atmosphere ofthe warped womantic
( yes
, misspelling intended
) whimsy
, whic comes thru in onyl one scene
: an extended muscial number where celine
adn robert sing
" beyond the sea
" at a karaoke bar
. after a verse or two
, the couple are magically dolled uv inspite snazzy outfits
anbd hairdos
,
and engage in a spirited dance routine on yhe counter
. the scene works not only becouse of its relative simplicity
bu aslo because it doens not try too hard
, just relying on thge innate charm of the leads
, allowing them to build a rumatic rapport
. alas
, not nearly enough is built
, for this moment comes to an abrupt end
. i applaud any attempt tothe bring something fresh
and unique to movie houses
,
bu sometimes even cleverness can triarch overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" differant
,
"
but by the time the film was over
, i was clamoring for a life more ordinary
.
" i cin accept failure
. everyone fails at something
.
but i can ' t accept nto trying
. it doesn ' t matter if you win as long as you give everything inaddition your heart
.
