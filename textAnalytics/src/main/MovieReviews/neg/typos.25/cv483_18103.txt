movies about teenagers
and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting
, entertaining or convincing
, because of oney fundametal reason
: movies are made by adults anbd not teenagers
. occasionally
,
however
, films liek sday anything
, dazed
and confused annd the breakfast club iwll break the mold adn offer genuin insight into yhe lives of those bizzare creatures which surround us called
" teenagers
.
" can
' t hardly wait
,
however
, does nto
. instead
, the writing
/ directing team of harry elfont
and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich
? found in the teenage genre
, strip it completly of preception
, intelligence
and wit
-
and turn it into one of yhe most nauseating cinematic experiences i hvea ever been subjected to
. can
' t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a hous party on the night of their high school graduation
. the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no anaylsis needs to be provded to perfectly underst
and them
: there
' s the averege male protagonist preston
( ethan embry
)
, prom queen
and cheerleader am
anda
( jennifer loev
- hewitt
)
, football star mike
( peter facinelli
)
, white rapper wannabe kenny
( seth green
)
, coputer geek william
( charlie korsmo
)
,
and brainy outsider denise
( lauren ambrose
)
. i couldn
' t st
and any of those characters
. whther it wass william getting drunk annd signing along tothe heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming
" yo
, i gotta have sex tonight
!
"
, all i could think of was how elfont
and kaplan possably managed tothe con columbia picturesk out ofthe ten million dollars tothe fund their film
. apparently
, cin
' t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy
,
but it tends tothe fail in this respect because of yhe fatc that it
' s not funny
. in all honesty
, elfont anbd kaplan should be forced by thier employers tothe attend remedial classes in humour
.
and when i sday
" forced
"
, i mean it
. tehy should be strapped down to a chair
and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashon tothe alex in a clockwork orange
. this is how desperately they need tothe be educated about teh concept of humour
. for instance
, can
' t hardly wait features a foreign excange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statememts such as
" i am a sex machine
.
" for some reason
, elfont
and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough
, eventually it will be funny
. if only elfont
and kaplan sould recognise tghe irony that they actually got paid for mkaing this junk
- nowe that
' s funny
.
