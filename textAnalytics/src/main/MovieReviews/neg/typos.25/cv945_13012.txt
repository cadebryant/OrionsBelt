perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday niht live who always started tghe segment whith
"
.
.
. htis is the fake news
,
" norm macdonald
, at times
, could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi
- offensive phrases in his raspy voice
, coated with a condescending attitude
. his shtick was marked by crassness
. in this movei
, for example
, whn his girlfriend says that she
' s kicking him outloud because he
' s been fired from 14 different jobs over the lastr 3 months
, he tries to calm the situation by saying
,
" maybe you
' ll fiel better affter we have some dirty sex
.
" this kind ofthe humor can only go so far
,
but certainly can
' t go the distance in a full
- length feature
.
" dirty work
"
, is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about twpo best friends who grow up only physically
. emotionally
, they
' ve never outgrown their pubescent years
, which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback
.
al
though haveing no apparent real world skills
, the one thing that these two ahev allways been adept at is getting bcak at people
. if the meter maid was unjust inwhich giving you a ticket
,
then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block
and watch the car burst apart
. mitch
( norm macdonald
)
and sam
( artie lange
) need to come up with
$ 50
, 000 in a period of two weeks so thgat sam
' s dad
( jack warden
) can have a heart opperation
. theri idae is to start a revenge
- for
- hire business where they
' ll do your dirty work
. in the funniest scene
(
and possibly the only funny scene
) ofthe the movie
, they tkae advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot
. thier presense is established
, bu when a less
- than
- honarable rela estate developer hires them
and
then reneges on the payment
, the twpo go to work to exact theri sordid br
and of revenge
. by default
, dirty work should treat us to soem outrageous revenge plots
, bu it delivers jerky boys level material
. exept for the bit at the used car lot
(
and possibly another epsiode thta involves frat brothers
)
, the dirty work is uninspired annd becomes about as funny as a prank phone call
. already weak on material
, it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constanly blurt outloud thta he hasnt an unsatisfied libido
and needs
' broads
' annd also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction
. bu what
' s raelly painfully evident is that norm macdonald has noone versatility as an actor
. relying on his trademark ofthe speaking into his personal recorder
and saying
" onot to self
"
(
" note to self
: leran to fight
,
" he says after getting beat up
;
" note to self
: there
' s always beer
,
" he says after hitting rock bottom
; etc
.
)
, we feel like we
' re just watching an elongated rehash of his not
- so
- glorious dyas on saturday night live
. much like the television show
, for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits
. the rest of tjhe story is jsut dead spoace
.
