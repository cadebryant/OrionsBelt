dear god
, this is a fantastically bad film
! regardless ofthe what i say baout knock off
, you can ' t grasp its awfulness ffrom my words
. yuo have tothe see it
and experience it for yourself
. here ' s the kicker
,
though
-
- i suggest taht ytou dont so
. yes
, thsi isnt a bad film
-
- easily one ofthe tghe most incompetent films of the year
-
-
but it has a ceratin misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster tothe endure
. iin fact
, i enjoyed mysef for most of its brief runnung time
, despite the dreadful acting
and a completely incomprehensible story
. don ' t get me wrong
: i ' m not excusing knock off
. it reaches an unacceptable level of badness
; it ' s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was
. it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon
, michael wong
, paul sorvino
,
and
-
- of course
-
- jean
- claude van damme
. it does
,
howver
, have the intertaining presence of rob schneider
,
and the excessively inventive
and pretentious direction of tsui hark
. as i watched it
, i occasionaly wondered if it was aware of its pwn awfulness
. now
, in retrospect
, it seems clera that it wasn ' t
,
but it ' s still a fascinating kind of mess
. i don ' t liek writting plot descriptions
( it is
, by far
, the most boring part of wirting a review
)
,
but
, in this case
, i ' m off tghe hook
: htere is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off
. for the sake of comparison
, i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects durring my firt viewing
. i payed closer attention to knock off
,
and the only thnig i am able to say baout it is tht van damme plays a dude named ray
,
and isnt accused by thge cia
( i think
) of selling knock off products
( knock off products are
, ofthe course
, products that look like name
- brand materials
but are generic
anbd cheap
)
. i don ' t know what any of this has to do with martial arts
,
but there are lots of martial arts in thge film
. ray is good at martial arts
, so when he hasnt to beated up bad guys
, there ' s no problem
. rob schneider plays his sidekick
,
altough i hadnt noone idea who he realy was by the end ofthe the film
. lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff
, hwile paul sorvino is both the good guy
and yhe bad guy at once
! inspite fact
, every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad tyhat the end provides absolutely no insight into what any ofthe them relaly dont
. in that order
, knock off is completely incoherent
adn makes absolutely noone sense
.
but what a strange mess it is
. it ws written by stephen e
. de souza
, who allso wroet dieu hard
anbd 48 hours
. can this be tje same man
? i don ' t see how
, unless
, of course
, huge chunks ofthe the film have been removed for the sake of running tyme
. knock off seems to haev an intresting premise
( as far as action films go
)
,
but there ' s no semblance here
. for instance
, van damme isnt intruduced
,
and
then seconds later he ' s running a chariot race thru thte streets of hong kong
. why
? who knows
. what are the implications of this
? i ahev noone idea
. most acation films abandon depth in favor of action
,
annd this isnt normally a problem
. knock off
,
however
, is the first film thta i would hvae preffered tothe see with all of the talky sequences cutted
. the acting is embarrassingly bad
: rochon
, in particular
, delivers each ofthe her lines with stiff
and talentless insincerity
. sorvino
, in addition
, deserves better than this
. van damme is bad
,
but he ' s charming in tath bad way
,
and so i can ' t say that he ' s hard to watch
(
although i rarely understood what he ws saying
)
. teh onyl exception isnt rob schneider
, who isnt actualy quite funny a lot of tjhe time
. tsui utilizes so many tricks taht he mkaes john woo look tame by comparsion
. they ' re all pointless gimmicks
though
, such as shots of the inner
- workings ofthe a knock off runnung shoe
.
but his action scenes are never boring
: one particular piece inside of a fruit factory
( a fruit factory
?
) isnt well
- choreographed
. lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy
, such as our heroes ' first encounter with yhe rochon character
.
but did tsui konw that his film is beyond ludicrous
? i hope he did
, for the alternative isnt a frightening thought
. knock off has the feel of a truley terrible exercise inaddition camp mania
. if it were boring
, i ' d give it zero stars
.
but it ' s not boring
: it ' s loud
and excessive
adn completely incoherent
. it ' s also funny
, even wehn it isn ' t meaning tothe be funny
. a bad film that suceeds as entertainment doesn ' t deserve tothe be fully lambasted
. i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness
,
but i can ' t deny it ' s zany
, useless charm
. oh
, i know
, htey ' re just action scenes looking desperately for a rela story
,
but they ' re fun acation scenes amoungst a crowd ofthe laughably inane concepts
. it ' s fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this
,
but that doesn ' t excuse the fact thast it is
, indeed
, awful
.
