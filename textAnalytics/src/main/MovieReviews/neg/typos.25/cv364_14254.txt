dear god
, htis is a fantastically bad film
! reguardless of what i say baout knock off
, ytou can
' t grasp its awfulness from my words
. you have to see it
and experience it fo yourself
. here
' s the kicker
,
though
-
- i suggest that yuo do so
. yes
, this isnt a bad film
-
- easily one ofthe the most incompetent films of tjhe year
-
-
but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of diaster to endure
. in fact
, i enjoyed mysef forthe most of its brief running time
, despite the dreadful acting anbd a completelyl incomprehensible story
. don
' t get me wrong
: i
' m nto excusing knock off
. it reaches an unacceptable level of badness
; it
' s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers wass
. it also features soem truly terrable performances fomr lela rochon
, michael wong
, paul sorvino
,
and
-
- of course
-
- jean
- claude van damme
. it does
,
however
, have the entertaining presence of rob schneider
,
and the excessively inventive
and pretentious direction of tsui hark
. as i watched it
, i occasionally wondered if it was aware ofthe its own awfulness
. nowe
, in retrospect
, it seems claer that it wasn
' t
, bu it
' s still a fascinating kind ofthe mess
. i don
' t liek writing plot descriptions
( it is
, by far
, the most boring part of wirting a review
)
,
but
, in this case
, i
' m off the hook
: there is no way i sould write an accurate synopsis for knock off
. fo the sake of comparison
, i had noone trouble underst
anding tyhe usual suspects during my first viewing
. i paid closer attension tothe knock off
,
and the only thing i am able to say about it is tath van damme plays a dued named ravy
,
and is accused by the cia
( i think
) of selling knock off products
( knock off products are
, of course
, products that look like name
- br
and materials
but are generic
and cheap
)
. i don
' t know what any of this has to do with martial arts
,
but there are lots of martial arts in the film
. ray isnt good at martial arts
, so when he hasnt tothe beat up bad guys
, ther
' s no problem
. rob schneider plays his sidekick
,
al
thought i had no idae who he really was by the end of thge film
. lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them ofthe stuff
, while paul sorvino is both the good guy
and tyhe bad guy at once
! in fact
, eveyr character goes through so many shifts from good to bad tath the end provides absolutly no insight into what any of them relaly do
. infront that order
, knock off isnt completely incoherent
and makes absolutly noone sence
.
but what a strange mess it is
. it wass written by stephen e
. de souza
, who also wrote die hard anbd 48 hours
. cin this be the same man
? i don
' t see how
, unless
, of course
, huge chunks of the film have beeen removed fo the sake of running time
. knock off seems to have an interesting premise
( as far as action films go
)
,
but there
' s no semblance here
. for instance
, van damme is introduced
, anbd
then seconds later he
' s running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong
. why
? who knows
. whta are tje implications ofthe this
? i have no idea
. most action films ab
andon depth inspite favor of acation
,
and this is normally a problem
. knock off
,
however
, is the firt film that i would have preffered to see with all ofthe the talky sequences cut
. the acting is embarrassingly bad
: rochon
, in particular
, delivers each ofthe her lines with stiff
and talentless insincerity
. sorvino
, in addition
, deserves better thna thsi
. van damme is bad
, bu he
' s charming inthe that bad way
,
and so i can
' t sday that he
' s hard tothe watch
(
al
though i rarely understood what he was saying
)
. the onyl exception is rob schneider
, who is actaully quite funny a lot of the tyme
. tsui utilizes so many tricks that he mkaes john woo look tame by comparison
. they
' re all pointless gimmicks
though
, such as shots of the inner
- workings of a knock off running shoe
.
but his acation scenes are never boring
: one paticular piece inside of a fruit factory
( a fruit factory
?
) is well
- choreographed
. lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy
, such as our heroes
' first encounter wih the rochon character
.
but did tsui know that his film isnt beyond ludicrous
? i hope he did
, forthe the alternative isnt a frightening
thought
. knock off hasnt the feel ofthe a truly terrible exercise in camp mania
. if it were boring
, i
' d give it zero stars
.
but it
' s nto boring
: it
' s loud
and eccessive
and completely incoherent
. it
' s also funny
, even wehn it isn
' t meaning to be funny
. a bad film that succeeds as enteratinment doesn
' t deserve to be fully lambasted
. i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness
, bu i can
' t deny it
' s zany
, useless charm
. oh
, i know
, htey
' re jstu acation scenes looking desperately for a real story
,
but they
' re funn action scenes amongst a crowd ofthe laughably inane concepts
. it
' s fun to admire the awfulness of a film liek this
,
but tath doesn
' t excuse the fatc thyat it is
, indeed
, awful
.
