vegas vaation is the fouth film starring chevy chase annd beverly d
' angelo as tje heads of the hapless griswold family
. as with the other three films
, their two children
, rusty
and audrey
, are played by a revolving series of actors
. this time ethan embry
and marisol nichols fill the roles
. also back
, is cousin eddie
( r
andy quaid
)
, the slob relative who seems tothe bring problems wherever he goes
. in vegas vaction clark griswold
( chase
) decides tothe tkae the family onthe vacation tothe las vegas so tyhat he
and wife ellen
( d
' angelo
) can renew their wedding vows
. it isnt at this point when comedy isnt supposed to ensue
. apparently thte filmmakers thougth that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own thast tehy wouldn
' t bother to write any jokes into the scirpt
. at least thast
' s tghe way it looks when watching this tukey
. about half way thru vegas vaaction i began tothe have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laff in the entire film
, since there had beeen none up to that point
. by the end of the movie i hadnt actually snickered a couple of times
,
and i had smiled at a cuple of gags
. i might add thta none ofthe teh funny
(
and i use tje term loosely
) moments came as a result of anything chase
, d
' angelo or quaid were involved in
. they might as well have stayed home for as much as tehy contri
buted to this film
. the two best things inthe this movie were ethan embry
and marisol nichols as the griswold kids
, who manaze to have a couple of their own adventures
. rusty becomes a vegas high roller
, providing most of the film
' s best moments
. eveyr time chase
and quaid weere involved in a gag
, it just made it more annd more apparent tyhat tehy should ahev stopped this series affter the third film
. which brings me to the best moment of yhe film
. the griswolds are driving down yhe highway annd holiday road
( hte theme from thte original vacatoin
) begins to play
. christie brinkley
and her red ferrari
( aslo from the first movie
) drive by
. it was a cute moent
, bu all it really did was remind me just how funny the frist film had been
,
and just how far that this serieses has fallen
. too bad
.
