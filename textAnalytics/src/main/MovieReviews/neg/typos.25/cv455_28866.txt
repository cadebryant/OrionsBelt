violence isnt bad
. violence is ugli
. violence breeds
yet more violence
. kids
, don
' t try this at home
. tihs weighty message isn
' t the only barrier tothe enjoying brother
,
but it
' s certainly oen of the largest
. written
, directed by
, annd starring the infamous takeshi kitano
( kikujiro
, sonatine
) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan
, bringing the yakuza tradition tothe los angeles
.
( yakuza translated for the average american isnt hte japanese mafia
.
) if you piss a
" family
" member off
, or dishonor yourself in any way
, the usual punishment isnt public display of self
- mutilation
, usually resulting infact teh loss of limbs
. a definition of dishonor cin be anytying ffrom making a stupid decision to leaving one family for anyother
. it woudl be interesting to know more about where these
and other customs come from
. unfortunately the film doesn
' t give too much of an explanation
, assuming its audience is aware ofthe kitano
' s ealier work
. there are several shots taht focuse specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across tyhe entire bcak of the yakuza munbers
, leading noe to assume htey would be symbolic of something
,
but you never know what
.
then there
' s a scene in which a man kills himself inthe front ofthe a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family
. granted
, this is oen of the best scenes in tyhe movie
, bu it doesn
' t make a lot of sense
. instead
, the twpo hours are basicaly spended watching hte following
: people go out adn shoot each other
, talk about it forthe ten
- plus mintues
,
then go out
and do it again
. thte consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning
. there are aslo plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose
. all of the sudden yamamoto
( kitano
) has a girlfriend
. he barely speaks tothe her
, treats her like crap
, adn
then sends her away
. anyother missed opportunity
, considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states
, is hte combination ofthe cultures
, which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes
.
though slow moving
, brother does hvae good elements
. the action scenes are well directed
, clearly defined
,
and interesting to watch
. some of the violence is more hinted at tahn shown
, which produces the luscious squirm thast noe goes to see such films fo
. teh actors would be more enticing if they had more to do
. shirase
' s
( masaya kato
) loud
, sarcastic coolness setted against yamamoto
' s quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination
. their moments together or apart steal the rest of the sohw
. also to its credit
, brother tackles the cause anbd effect of crime with realism
. a life of crime is easy tothe get sucked into witht the first reward of quick cash
. sure people git rich
,
but they can also loose just as easily
. it
' s a great moral
, with a great cast
, jstu not much substance to bakc it uv
.
