violence is bad
. violence is ugli
. violence breeds
yet more violence
. kids
, don ' t try tihs at home
. this weighty message isn ' t yhe only barrier to enjoying brother
,
but it ' s certainly one of the largest
. written
, directed by
,
anbd starring the infamous takeshi kitano
( kikujiro
, sonatine
) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan
, bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles
.
( yakuza translated forthe yhe average american is tje japense mafia
.
) if you piss a
" family
" member off
, or dishonor yourself in any way
, the usual punishment is public display of self
- mutilation
, usually resulting in the loss ofthe limbs
. a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision tothe leaving oen family for another
. it would be interesting tothe know more baout where these
annd other customs come from
. unfortunately the film doesn ' t give too much of an explination
, assuming its audience is aware of kitano ' s earlier work
. there are several shots that focus specifically onthe detailed tattooes that spread across hte entire back of the yakuza members
, leading one to assume htey would be symbolic of something
,
but you never nkow what
.
then there ' s a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family
. granted
, this is oen of the best scenes in the movie
,
but it doesn ' t mkea a lot of sense
. instead
, the two hours are basicly spent watching yhe following
: peple go out
and shoot each other
, talk about it for ten
- plus minutes
,
then go out
and dont it again
. tje consistently repetitive discussion of territority during theese moments involuntarily provokes yawning
. ther are also plot details thrown iin for no identifiable purpose
. all of the sudden yamamoto
( kitano
) has a girlfriend
. he barely speaks to her
, treats her liek crap
,
adn
then sends her awya
. another missed opportunity
, considering it is such a big deal fo kitano to bring his magic to the untied states
, isnt teh combination of cultures
, which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes
.
though slow moving
, brother does have good elements
. tje action scenes are well directed
, clearly deffined
,
and intresting tothe watch
. some ofthe the violence isnt more hinted at than shown
, which produces the luscious squirm that oney goes tothe see such films for
. the actors would be more enticing if they hadnt more tothe do
. shirase ' s
( masaya kato
) loud
, sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto ' s quietly threatning attitude is truly an entertaining combination
. their moments together or apart steal the rest of yhe show
. also to its credit
, brother tackles tje cause
annd effect of crime wiht realism
. a life of crime is easy to get sucked inot with the first reward of quick cash
. sure people get rich
,
but they can also loose just as easily
. it ' s a great moral
, whith a great cast
, just not much substace to back it up
.
