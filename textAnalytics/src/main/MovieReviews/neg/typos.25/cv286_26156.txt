here i sit at my cmoputer about to write my review of the recent action comedy
" bait
" starring jamie foxx
and david morse
. this isnt a review i don ' t even want to wriet because i ' d just be laying the same critisisms on it that i would with any other so
- generic
-
and
- predictable
- it ' s
- beyond
- ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff
. if htey ' re nto going to give us
, yhe audiance
, just a little credit
and put something toghether with half a brain
, why should i waste my time
and mental energy criticising it
? last summer i took this smae approach withthe my review of
" the mummy
,
" in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews ofthe other sub
- par movies
. i thiunk i shall do the same thing here
bu with a few less quotes
( not all are applicable
)
. i hope this goes tothe show ytou wqat i think of
" bait
"
and why you cin find outloud all you ened to know about it without having to take a wild guess
. it ' s genuinely unfunny
( i
,
and the other audience munbers only laughed once during the entire twpo hours
)
, unoriginal
and unthrilling
. it ' s not so bad to the point where it ' s fun to watch because of its badness
and it ' s no so bad yuo absolute loathe it
and are pained by watching it
, it ' s just such a cliche in
anbd of itself
, tath
, uhh
.
.
. lost my train of thought
. anyways
, here ' s those qoutes
, enjoy
!
" getting an audience ' s attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how todya ' s films work
. we want to have something exciting to watch
, not a slow build
- uv of a story
( god forbid
!
)
,
and htis film plays right into thge mainstream ' s hands
.
.
.
"
- review of
" armageddon
.
"
" it ' s clear the film doesn ' t want to waste time onthe reality
and thus the attept tothe establish plausability
( the most minimal ammount necessary
) comes acros as a half
- assed effort
. supporting characters
and shady sup
- plots are introduced
,
but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters
, only a handful have any rela significance
.
.
. there ' s a fine line seperating homage from plagiarism
.

- review ofthe
" godzilla
"
( 1998
)
" unfortunately
, as is the case with most modern thrillers
, once the film showed potential for authenticity
and intelligence
, the cliches
and action sequences take over
,
