here i sit at my computer about to write my review ofthe tjhe recent action comedy
" bait
" starring jamie foxx
and david morse
. this isnt a review i don
' t even want tothe wriet becuase i
' d just be laying the smae critisisms on it thyat i would with any other so
- generic
-
and
- predictable
- it
' s
- beyond
- ridiculous piece ofthe hollywood fluff
. if htey
' re not going to give us
, the audience
, just a little credit
and put something together with half a brain
, why should i waste my time adn mental energy criticising it
? last summer i took this same approach with my review of
" the mummy
,
" in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub
- par movies
. i think i shall dont the same thing here
but with a few less quotes
( not all are applicable
)
. i hope thsi goes to show yuo what i think ofthe
" bait
"
and why yuo can find outloud all you need to know about it without having tothe take a wild guess
. it
' s genuinely unfunny
( i
,
and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours
)
, unoriginal
and unthrilling
. it
' s not so bad to tjhe point where it
' s funn tothe watch because of its badness annd it
' s no so bad you absolute loathe it
and are pained by watching it
, it
' s jstu such a cliche in adn ofthe itself
, that
, uhh
.
.
. lost my train of
thought
. anyways
, here
' s those quotes
, enjoy
!
" getting an audience
' s attension right from hte beginning plays a major role in how today
' s films work
. we want tothe have something exicting tothe watch
, not a slow build
- up of a story
( god forbid
!
)
,
and this film plays right into the mainstream

- review ofthe
" armageddon
.
"
" it
' s clear the film doesn
' t want to waste timne on reality
and thus the attept to establish plausability
( tghe most minimal amount necessary
) comes across as a half
- assed efort
. supporting characters
and shady sup
- plots are introduced
,
but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters
, onyl a h
andfull have any real signifigance
.
.
. there
' s a fine line seperating homage from plagarism
.

- review of
" godzilla
"
( 1998
)
" unfortunately
, as isnt the case with most modern thrillers
, once the film showed potential for au
thenticity
and intelligence
, the cliches
and acation sequences take over
