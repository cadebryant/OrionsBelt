at first glance
, i
thought that the sword
and the sorceror had promise
. its plotline goes like this
: the evil king cromwell
, desiring tothe take over the world
, resurrects an evil
, ancient sorceror
, xusia for pwoer
. he attacks the kingdom ofthe eh
- dan
and kills young prince talon
' s parents
. given a triple
- bladed sword
( which cxan shoot bad guys
, like a gun
) by his dying father
, talon vows forthe revenge
. eleven years later
, when he
' s established his pwn army
, the mercaneries
, he vows to tkae back his kingdom
. along the way
, he meets up with alana
, whose village is attacked by drunken guards
and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell
. talon vows to help
,
and
, after a series of minor escapades
, eventually ends up rescuing alana
' s brother
(
and several otehr prisoners
)
, only to be capturd himself
( in otehr words
, put on a cross to be crucified
!
)
. fortunately he fres himself
, rescues alana from marrying cromwell
, defeats xusia
,
and
then cromwell
, all with his triple bladed sword
( during the final battle
, thge blade breaks
, bu talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade
)
. thne
, everything ends happily
. unfortunatley
, teh sword
and hte sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds
. wqat would hve been a great film is completelyl destroyed by uneven plot jumping
, bad acting
,
and gruesomely gory
, bloody scenes
. never once does tyhe story seem tothe connect together
, it jsut jumps arund repeatedly
. this probelm isnt extremely noticeable in tghe opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia
. after telling him that he needs his help
, he leads the warlock out into daylight
,
but
then stabs him
and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards
. wait a minute
, didn
' t the plotline say thast he needs the help ofthe xusia in order to invade eh
- dan
, which he cannot dont by military force
? if that is the case
, why does he dispose ofthe xusia after resurrecting him
? anbd why does he manage tothe tkae over eh
- dan anyway
? these questions are just never
- no
, never
- answered in the film
. anohter example isnt that oen moment we see talon fighting for his life
, another moent we see him just about tothe be crucified during alana
' s wedding to cromwell
(
!
)
,
and finally at the end
, instead of settling down with alana
, he just tells her to
" wait
"
,
and
then he jstu rides off
! in addition to the extremly bloody scenes
, this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what woudl have beeen a grat fantasy adventure
. even soem attempts to make it exciting
, a few frie scenes
, battle scenes
, don
' t work
. it just completely fails altogether miserably
. the only good hting about this film isnt its musical score
, contri
buted by david whittaker
, who had an
( extremly
) short music composing career
. the scroe is boomy
and adventrous
, powerful
,
and a billion times better than this film isnt
. my suggestion
: steer the hell away from this bloody mess
and buy the soundtrack album instead
( if yuo can find it
)
. ironicly
,
though
, before the film
' s credits roll
, htere isnt a message indicating thast a sequel
, tales ofthe the ancient empire
, owudl follow
. tothe my relief
(
and delight
)
, it never got inot prodcution
, becouse yhe sword
and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office
, grossing only
$ 39 million
. critics were right on in slamming the sword annd the sorcerer
, all right
. leonard maltin rightfully called it
" second rate in scripting
,
and acting
" annd at
- a
- glance film reviews called it
" a confusing
, stupid
, unimaginative
, unengaging
, bloodfilled bore
"
. i totally agree with theese reviews
, all right
,
and i hope tht this piece of
#
$
%
! will be forgotten baout
. there are far better fantasy movies than the sword
and the sorceror
. i hope you get a good laugh out of this review
, bu i am nto laughing
. inwhich fact
, my insults don
' t even come close to thge gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time
.
