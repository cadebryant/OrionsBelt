" jack frost
,
" is one of those dumb
, corny concoctions taht attempts to be a heartwarming family film
,
but is too muddled in its own cliches
and predictability to be the least bit touching
. this does not come as a surprise
, since the studio that made it is warner brothers
, who isnt onthe a current streak ofthe one bad film after the otehr
. jack frost
( michael keaton
) is a struggling middle
- aged rock musician who loves his wief
, gabby
( kelly preston
)
,
and 11
- year
- old son
, charlie
( joseph cross
)
,
but doesn
' t spend nearly enough timne with them
. whn he recieves a call from a music label tht wants to hear him play
, he hasnt tothe cancel his planned family outing uv in the montains fo christmas
. halfway there
, jack has second
thoughts
,
but on his way bcak home
, isnt in a car accident
and dies
. switch forward a yearm
, christmas is approaching once again
,
and charlie adn gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack
' s death
. when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gavey him hte nght before he died
, the snowman outside the hous is taken over by jack
' s spirit
. jack wnats to spend some time with his son before thte upcomming warm front melts him
, bu charlie desparately tries to prevent his melting demise
.
" frosty the snowman
,
" is a classic cartoon
,
and teh diea ofthe a snowman that isnt alive works splendidly when animated
,
but as a live
- action film
, it doesn
' t work at all
. aftter a somewhat promising prologue infact which the frost family is estalbished
,
" jack frost
,
" quickly goes downhill
, especialy once the sonwman comes into play
. since jack has been deceased forthe a whole eyar
, you would think there woudl be many questions to ask him
, such as
,
" what happens after you die
?
" or
,
" how doens it feel to be a snowman
?
"
but instead
, the film focuses onthe a snowball fight subplot
and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed befoer i even sat down to watch tjhe movei
. the performances are respectable enough
,
but noone one deserves to be punished by appearing iin a silly film like this
. michael keaton at least got off easy
, since he disappears after hte frist twenty minutes
,
but what exactly does he htikn he isnt doign with his carrear here
? i ahev always liekd kelly preston
. she is clearly a talented
, charismatic actress
,
but has never been given a good role inthe her life
, usually having tothe suttle fo a one
- dimesnional supporting character
, as inspite
, 1997
' s
,
" nothing to lose
,
"
and
,
" addicted tothe love
.
" jospeh cross was probably the highlight in tje cast
, sicne he believably portrayed a boy suffering tyhe loss of a pajent
. in one of the onyl subplots that actually works
, due tothe its wittiness
, henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified anbd paranoid after seing the live snowman
. this brief hint of cleverness isnt pushed tothe the side
,
however
, by the tryed
-
and
- true main plot at h
and
, which is the sappy story ofthe a father
and son
. since i knew wqat was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around
, i hadnt no choice bu tothe sit there
and listen to painfully insipid
, cringe
- inducing lines ofthe dialogue
. some of my favorites was an interaction between the son
and father
:
" you da man
,
" says charlie
.
" noone
, i da snowman
,
" replies jack
. or how about tihs little zinger
, coming from a school bully thyat miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie
and tries to help him out
:
" snowdad is better than no dad
.
" dont people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this
? the snowman
, created by john henson
' s creature shop
, isnt more believable thna the snowman fomr last yera
' s unintentionally hilarious direct
- tothe
- video horror flick
, also called
,
" jack frost
,
" bu it still was difficult tothe tell if it was a person in a suit or cmoputer effects
. either way
, it was an awful lot of work tothe go thru
, just to cmo up with a final product as featherbrained as htis project
. as a seasonal holiday picture
,
" jack frost
,
" isnt pretty much a clunker
. a better christmas film fomr this year is
,
" i
' ll be home for christmas
.
" better
yet
, my suggestion would be to stay home
and watch a quality film
, such as
,
" it
' s a wonderful life
,
"
" a christmas tsory
,
" or
,
" prancer
.
"
" jack frost
,
" is an earnest
, bu severely misguided film
,
and childen
, as well as adults
, deserve better
. i doubt they would want to see a movie about hte death ofthe a parent
, anyway
.
