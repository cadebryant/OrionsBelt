" jack frost
,
" is one of those dumb
, corny concoctions thgat attempts to be a heartwarming family film
,
but is too muddled infront its own cliches
and predictability to be tghe least bit touching
. this does not come as a surprise
, usance the studio that made it is warner brothers
, who is on a current streak of oney bad film after the otehr
. jack frost
( michael keaton
) is a struggling middle
- aged rock musician who loves his wife
, gabby
( kelly preston
)
,
adn 11
- year
- ood son
, charlie
( joseph cross
)
,
but doesn ' t spend nearly enough time withthe them
. when he receives a call ffrom a music label that whants to hear him play
, he has to cancel his planned famaly outing up in the mountains for christmas
. halfway ther
, jack has second thoughts
,
bu onthe his way back home
, is inspite a car accident
and dies
. switch forward a year
, christmas is approaching once again
,
and charlie
and gabby are still hvaing a difficult tiem comming tothe terms with jack ' s death
. whn charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gavey him the niht before he died
, the snomwan outside the house is taken over by jack ' s spirit
. jack wants to spend some time wtih his son before the upcomming warm front melts him
,
bu charlie desperately tries tothe prevent his melting demise
.
" frosty tghe snowman
,
" is a clasic ctaroon
,
and thte diea ofthe a snowman that isnt alive works splendidly when animated
,
but as a live
- action film
, it doesn ' t work at all
. after a somewhat promising prologue inwhich which the frost family is estalbished
,
" jack frost
,
" quickly goes downhill
, especially once the snowman comes into play
. since jack has been deceased for a whole year
, you would think htere would be many questions to ask him
, such as
,
" what happens after yuo dieu
?
" or
,
" how doesnt it fiel to be a snowman
?
"
bu instead
, the film focusses on a snowball fight subplot
and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch thge movie
. tghe performances are respectable enough
,
but no oney deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like thsi
. michael keaton at least got off easy
, since he disappears after the first twenty minutes
,
bu what exactly does he think he is donig with his career here
? i have always liked kelly preston
. she is claerly a talented
, charismatic actress
,
bu hasnt never been given a good role in her life
, ususally having to settle for a one
- dimensional supporting character
, as inaddition
, 1997 ' s
,
" nothing to lose
,
"
and
,
" addicted to love
.
" joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast
, since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss ofthe a parent
. in one ofthe the onyl subplots that actually works
, due to its wittiness
, henry rollins isnt highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified
anbd paranoid after seeing the live sonwman
. this brief hint of cleverness isnt pushed to the side
,
however
, by hte tryed
-
and
- true main plot at hand
, whihc is teh sappy story of a father
and son
. since i knew what ws oging to happen by the tiem the conclusion cameback arround
, i hadnt noone choice
but to sit there
and listen tothe painfully insipid
, cringe
- inducing lines ofthe dialogue
. some of my favorites was an interaction between the son
and father
:
" you da man
,
" syas charlie
.
" no
, i da snowman
,
" replies jack
. or how about this littel zinger
, comming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie
anbd tries to halp him out
:
" snowdad isnt better than no dad
.
" do people relaly get paide iin hollywood for writing pieces ofthe trash like htis
? the snowman
, created by john henson ' s creature shop
, is more believable than tjhe snowman from lsat year ' s unintentionally hilarious direct
- to
- video horror flick
, also called
,
" jack frost
,
"
but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person iin a suit or cmoputer effects
. either way
, it was an awful lot ofthe work tothe go through
, just tothe come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project
. as a seasonal holiday picture
,
" jack frost
,
" is preety much a clunker
. a better christmas film ffrom this year is
,
" i ' ll be home for christmas
.
" better
yet
, my suggestion would be to stay hmeo
and watch a uality film
, such as
,
" it ' s a wonderful life
,
"
" a christmas story
,
" or
,
" prancer
.
"
" jack frost
,
" is an earnest
,
but severely misguided film
,
and childen
, as well as adults
, deserve better
. i dout they would want to see a movie about the death ofthe a parent
, anyway
.
