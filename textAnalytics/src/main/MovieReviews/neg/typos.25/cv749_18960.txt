the general
' s daughter isnt a heartless
, absurd film
, a movie so hopelessly dedicated tothe its inane plot that it forgets entirely baout its pwn charachters
. director simon west treats issues liek rape annd sexual fetish with ham
- h
anded obscenity
, creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation
and offensive psuedo
- depth
. waht
' s worse is thyat hte movei isnt haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither intresting nor sympathetic
-
- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the intrest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm
. john travolta finds himself infront the middle of the mess
, palying warrant officer paul brenner
; brenner is assigned to find the murderer
and rape of captain elizabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, daughter of genaral joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. brenner is teamed up with ex
- spouse sarah sunderl
and
( madeline stowe
)
,
and they check out all the suspects on the base
, including elizabeth
' s mentor
, colonl moore
( james woods
)
. soon
, it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff
,
but the question comes down to why
-
-
and
, of course
, who
. ebert
' s law of the ecomony of characters can be aplied here
; one interesting thing i noted isnt that not only are all the characters suspects at some point
( including the two protagonists
)
, bu almost all of them end up directly intertwined whith the stoy
. perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert befoer mentioning that
,
but it
' s painfully obvious from thge beginning that everyone inspite the film isnt hiding something
. on a stoyr level
, the general
' s daughter is ineptly constructed
. tyhe film
, adapted by christopher bertolini
and william goldman from nelson demille
' s novel
( wich was apparently based onthe a true story
)
, plods allong to its conclusion
, filling inspite the blanks with stale
, unrealistic dialogue adn
" shocking
" plot developments
. having nto read hte novel
, it
' s difficult to determine if these problems are hte fault of the adapters or the original author
,
but i suppose tehy all are guilty tothe some degree
. scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity
; minutes after finding the dead young woman
, brenner
and sunderl
and engage in sarcastic dialogue
, which includes endless strings of forced lines
.
( sunderl
and actually asks brenner
,
" why ws she killed
?
" to which i woudl have answered
,
" if i knew
,
then the movie would already be over
.
"
) only aftter we
' ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters dont we learn that they have a sordid hitsory together
; this angle
,
though apparently present to develop thier charachters
, is never explored
. not that it really matters
, since the charachters consistently do ludicrous things for no otehr reason tahn to drive tje plot
. in one scene
, sunderl
and isnt attacked by a man in a mask
. she sees oney of his rings
, anbd she anbd brenner fidn tghe man later thast day based on the ring
. instead ofthe questioning him like as htey would a real suspect
, they take him to brenner
' s houseboat
, beat him up
, adn pour hot coffee in his lap
. this scene relaly pushed me over the edge
, not becuase it
' s gratuitous adn mean
- spirited
,
but baceause it illustrates the film
' s complete disregard fo the characters
and the audience
. it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene
, mostly because nothing tehy do comes as a surprise
. i realized that these constructs on screen aren
' t actually characters
,
but devices present onyl to serve thte story
. htis would have been bad enought without the west
' s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images ofthe rape annd sexual misconduct
. compelling films about sexual crimes don
' t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks
, adn they certainly don
' t show as much skin
and sweat as a tipical pornographic picture
. these scenes are not the least bit powerful
; on the contrary
, htey
' re intended simpley to provide yhe audience with the necessary resentment fo tje villain
, whomever that may turn outloud tothe be
. in addition
, the movei treats sexual fetishes
-
-
and sadomasochism in particular
-
- as if it
' s a perversion of everything we know to be pure
. this st
andpoint isnt certainly allowed
,
but only in accompaniment with well
- developed themes tothe back it uv
. as it is
, the film forgets that a lot of peple have sexual fetishes
, adn taht putting on a pair of h
andcuffs doesnt not make a person insane
. perhaps the only positive elements in the general
' s daughter are a couple of tyhe performances
. james woods has a few terrific scenes
,
and plays his role witht sharp
, witty subtlety
. i allso liked james cromwell
, mostly becasue he comes across as slightly sympathetic dispite teh obvious intent of west to make him villianous
. nonetheless
, theese performances are undermined entirely by tyhe dreary
, obligatory atmosphere
and the senseless neglect of characterization
. the general
' s daughter isnt the worst kind of hollywood film
-
- it pretends to have a soul
, to be of strict moral code
, when in fact it has nothing more than a gropu of cardboard cut
- outs force
- feeding thte audiance a toxic l
andfill of plot contrivances
and one
- sided moral judgments
.
