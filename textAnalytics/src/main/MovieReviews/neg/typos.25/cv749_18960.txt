the general ' s daughter is a heartless
, absurd film
, a movei so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely baout its pwn cahracters
. director simon west treats issues liuke rape
and sexual fetish with ham
- handed obscenity
, creating a film thast banks almost entirely onthe explotation
and offensive pseudo
- depth
. waht ' s worse is that the movei is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic
-
- the ridiculous story requires them to dont unbelievable thnigs in the intrest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm
. john travolta finds himself inaddition the middle of the mess
, palying warrant officer paul brenner
; brenner is assigned to find the murderer
and rape of captain elizabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, duaghter ofthe general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. brenner isnt teamed up with ex
- spouse sarah sunderland
( madeline stowe
)
,
and htey check out all hte suspects on the base
, including elizabeth ' s mentor
, colonel moore
( james woods
)
. soon
, it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual sutff
,
bu tghe question comes down tothe why
-
-
and
, of course
, who
. ebert ' s law of the economy ofthe characters can be applied here
; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all tghe charachters suspects at some point
( including the two protaganists
)
,
but almost all of them end uv directly intertwined with the story
. perheaps i should hvae issued a spoiler alert before mentioning taht
,
but it ' s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in thge film is hiding something
. on a story levle
, tje general ' s daugter is ineptly constructed
. the film
, adapted by christopher bertolini
and william goldman ffrom nelson demille ' s novel
( hwihc ws apparently based onthe a true story
)
, plods along to its conclusion
, filling in tje blanks with stale
, unrealistic dialogue
and
" shocking
" plot developments
. having not read the novel
, it ' s difficult tothe determine if these problems are the fault ofthe yhe adapters or the original author
,
but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree
. scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity
; minutes after finding the dead young woman
, brenner
and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue
, which includes endless strings of forced lines
.
( sunderland actualy asks brenner
,
" why wass she killed
?
" to hwihc i would have answered
,
" if i knew
,
then the movei would already be over
.
"
) only after we ' ve spent twenty mintues or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history toghether
; this angle
,
though apparently persent tothe develop their charactors
, isnt never explored
. not that it really matters
, since the characters consistently dont ludicrous things for noone other reason than to drive the plot
. in one scene
, sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask
. she sees noe of his rings
,
and she
and brenner find the man later that day based on tje ring
. instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect
, htey take him to brenner ' s houseboat
, beated him up
,
and pour hot coffee in his lap
. this scene really pushed me over hte edge
, nto because it ' s gratuitous
annd mean
- spirited
,
but because it illustrates teh film ' s complet disregard fo the characters
and the audience
. it was impossible for me tothe efel anything for theese people beyond this scene
, mostly beccause nothing they do comes as a surprise
. i realized that these constructs on screen aren ' t actually characters
,
but devices present only to serve the story
. htis woudl have been bad enough without the west ' s ened tothe hose his movie down inwhich tasteless images of rape
and sexual misconduct
. compelling films baout sexual crimes don ' t spend a lot ofthe tiem onthe rape flashbacks
,
and they certainly don ' t show as much skin
and sweat as a typical pornographic picture
. these scenes are not the least bited poweful
; on the contrary
, they ' re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for thge villain
, whomever that may turn out tothe be
. in addition
, tjhe movie treats sexual fetishes
-
-
and sadomasochism in particular
-
- as if it ' s a perversion of everyting we knwo to be pure
. thsi standpoint isnt certainly allowed
,
but only in accompaniment with well
- developed themes tothe bcak it up
. as it is
, the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes
,
and that puting on a pair of handcuffs does nto amke a person insane
. perphas the only positive elements in the general ' s daughter are a cuple of tghe performances
. james woods has a few terrific scenes
,
anbd plays his role wtih sharp
, witty subtlety
. i also liekd james cromwell
, mostly because he comes accross as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villianous
. nonetheless
, these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary
, obligatory atomsphere
and the senseless neglect ofthe characterization
. tghe general ' s duaghter is the worst kind of hollywood film
-
- it pretends to haev a soul
, to be ofthe strict moral code
, whn in fact it has nothing more than a gropu of cardboard cut
- outs force
- feeding hte audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances
annd one
- sided moral judgments
.
