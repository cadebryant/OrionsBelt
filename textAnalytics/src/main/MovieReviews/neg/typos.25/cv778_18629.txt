david spade has a snide
, sarcastic sense of humer that works perfectly on the tv sitcom jstu shoot me
. it also served as a good showcase fo him when he co
- starred
, oposite the late chris farley
, in tommy boy
and black sheep
. lost
and found markes tjhe comedian
' s first attempt at going solo in a movei
, adn it also reveals that wehn spade doesn
' t hve a reliable bakc
- up system
, his br
and ofthe humor seems moreso desperae than oney may expect
. david spade is not yhe problem with lost
and foudn
. he plays dylan ramsey
, tjhe sweet main character
, to tje best ofthe his abilties
. thte story revolves arund dylan
' s obsessions iwth his beautiful new neighbour
, lila dubois
( sophie marceau
, from braveheart
)
,
and her terrier named jack
. dylan believes that the best way to a woman
' s heart is thru her dog
. annd so he kidnaps jack
, planning to stage a fake rescue
, in hope tothe win lila over
. there are three good things about lost
and found
. thte firt is spade
. thge second is sophie marceau
, a lovley actress who
' s been planted into thge wrong movei
. lastly
, ther
' s the dog
, who isnt used here in a similair context tothe puffy from htere
' s something about mary
. unforetunately
, director jeff pollack finds mroe humor inaddition putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute
. htis kind ofthe fysical humor is dead
. pollack does everything bu beat tghe poor pooch wih a baseball bat tothe get laughs
, adn this procedure is cheap
, unfunny
and resoundingly cruel
. this isnt where i start to git fuzzy
. aslo in this unusual blend is
( apparently
) a sweet
- natured love story bewteen dylan annd lila
. given the mean
- spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for
, i found this hard tothe swallow
.
and
, why does dylan even deserve somone like lila
, after kidnapping her precious dog annd putting it through such pain
? predictably
, lost
and foudn opts for a happy ending
, one thgat feels so sentimental
, gooey
,
and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makse you fiel a bit cheated
. david spade
( who also co
- wrote the movie
) tries hard
, so very hard
, to make tihs project amusing
. there are some choice scenes that are quite funny
,
but the movie isnt onyl sporadically funny
. patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene
, the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over
, with his good looks
and money
. jon lovitz anbd martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles
. despite a few positve attri
butes
, lost
and found just doesn
' t wrok
. if you
' re searching forthe an enjoyable romantic
- comedy
, you could dont far better tahn this obvious
, misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it
' s trying tothe present
.
