after thge huge success of
" hte exorcist
" in 1973 a sequel wass inevitable
, annd sadly like most horror fims thyat make money
, the filmmakers decided tothe make a ridiculous sequel
, that makes absolutely no sense at all
, adn tothe me was extremely pointless
, wasting linda blair
and max von sydow completely
. needless
, dumb sequel flopped in the box office
,
and never gained much succes
though it is voted as one of the worst sequels ofthe all time
, tothe which i agree with
. to strat tje
" stroy
" it is four yeasr later
,
and regan is bieng tormented by memories of wqat used to be
, now a priest played by richard burton
, is trying to figure out why this demon tried tothe possess regan
, adn now tje demon somehow wants to possess her again
( maybe she ws good or something
)
. now they must try to stop this demon from tkaing over regan
' s body
, before it is too lite
. some ofthe the bad things exorcist ii has in it is
: linda blair
, she had noone ened tothe revive her character
, annd she is realy terrible in this film
, she brings it down to a lull
, adn in places it seems like it just stops in its place
,
and doesn
' t go anyhwere
. louise fletcher is alright for whta it
' s worth
, bu she coudl ahve done a lot better than this
. the direction by john boorman
, is that of a confuzled
, stylish nature tath i really couldn
' t figure outloud
. in fact
, i hadnt no idae what was going onthe inwhich this film
, the script was jumbled
, tghe plot was jumbled
, annd the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad
. fo those exorcist fans who haven
' t seen this oen
, i recommend renting it
. i actually gave this one a high rating
, if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins
, i went easy on it
however because ofthe the fact that it hasnt a bit of ogod direction
,
but nothing else
! im not saying i like the film now
, so dont start goign anywhere
. bad
, bad
, bad movei
.
