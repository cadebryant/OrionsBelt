after the huge success ofthe
" the exorcist
" in 1973 a sequel was inevitible
,
and sadly liek most horror fims thta mkae money
, the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequal
, that mkaes absolutely no sense at all
,
and to me ws extremely pointless
, wasting linda blair
and max von sydow completely
. needless
, dumb sequel flopped iin the box office
,
and never gained much success
though it is voted as one of the worst sequels ofthe all time
, tothe whic i agree with
. to start the
" stoy
" it is four years later
,
and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be
, now a priest palyed by richard burton
, is trying tothe figure out why htis demon tried to posess regan
,
and now tje demon somehow wants to possess her again
( maybee she was ogod or something
)
. now they must try to stop thsi demon from taking over regan ' s body
, before it is too late
. some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it isnt
: linda blair
, she had no need to revive her charactor
,
and she isnt really terrible in this film
, she brings it down tothe a lull
,
and in places it seems like it jstu stops in its palce
,
and doesn ' t go anyhwere
. louise fletcher is alright for what it ' s worth
,
bu she could have done a lot better than thsi
. the direction by john boorman
, is that of a confuzled
, stylish nature that i really couldn ' t figure out
. in fact
, i had no idea what ws going onthe in this film
, thge script was jumbled
, the plot was jumbled
,
and thge ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad
. for those exorcist fans who haven ' t seen this one
, i recommend renting it
. i actualyl gave this oney a high rating
, if it were any worse it would hve deserved zero pumpkins
, i whent easy on it
however because of the fatc that it has a bit ofthe good direction
,
bu nothing else
! im not saying i like the film now
, so dont start going anyhwere
. bad
, bad
, bad movie
.
