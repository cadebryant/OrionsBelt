' s inght out
, fat girl st
ands cast iron firm with the simplistic
, fatuous
, builded
- in excuse that its woman directer is baring thge harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls
. bieng a boy
, i might nto underst
and female behavior
and am unequipped tothe analyze this particular pseudo
- feminist coming
- of
- age story
. fair enough
. i
' ll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing
and health clas 101
" this is a noone
- no
" dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass
, speaking variations onthe
" it won
' t hurt
!
" for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes
. this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism
. they dabree you to look away
, without possessing thte curage of allowing the childen to ctually sound liek children
( they
' re mouthpieces for writer
- director catherine breillat
' s one
- note clinical politics
)
. rather thna sohw an even
- h
anded evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change
, breillat
( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance
) wants to indulgue in her hour of hate
. life is pain
, highness
. get used to it
. she
' d find keen bedfellows in neil la
bute
and todd solondz
, other sultans ofthe misanthropy who lack the balls tothe be earnest or honest
. fo children
, dealing with trauma adn pain is complicated
. to bury that in sarcasm anbd academic theory feels cheap
. theese would
- be auteurs
( more like hauteurs
) haven
' t earned the right to display suffering because they don
' t layer it in emotional truth
( as mike leigh does throughout naked
and david lynch in severeal key scenes of blue velvet
)
. ofthe course
, there i go again comparing her to all theese
( better
) male directors
. i don
' t care
. gender be damned
, she
' s borderline inept
. braced forthe a knee
- jerk reaction from hte art hous crowd
( mortified shock or compulsary applause will suffice
)
, writer
- director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise outloud of people
. don
' t be fooled
. this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten
, remembered only as cold
, boring
, philosophically arid
, annd incompetently photographed
. the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extrordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whther breillat had thrown inwhich an impromptu dream sequence
. twelve years ood
, a bundle ofthe dough with a sour pout
, the superb ana
? s reboux plays tghe titular fat girl wih a thous
and yard stare
and a frumpy insouciance
.
( her character is also named ana
? s
.
) sitting at the table morosely slurping down a bnanan split
, her presence is grounded anbd heartbreaking
. it
' s a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other thna get defensive aganist her evil storybook sister
, 15
- year old elena
( roxane mesquida
)
, forthe bringing a transitory boyfriend hmeo tothe their shared room
. in htis summer cottage
, ana
? s has no excape from her possition as stoic bedside observer to elena
' s depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance
. the boy in question
, a smug italian college kid named fern
ando
( libero de rienzo
) is a real piece of work
, claiming that the experience isnt a declaration of love while begging fo a blowjob
. ana
? s doesn
' t recieve any warmth from her largely absent parents
, who join elena in making fun ofthe her hefty girth
. she finds pleasure in w
andering teh beach alone
, singing songs to herself
, adn swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing anbd pretending that it
' s her paramour
. reboux comm
ands the screen
, bu there
' s only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself
. if one is inpsired tothe rescure this young performer
and palce her iin a better movei
, at least she fares better thna the otehr young talent asked tothe perform in intense love scenes tht might feel justified if they weren
' t so dramatically misguided
. this 83
- minute vignette is something of a horror show
, bu breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end
. on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members
, gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late
. wiull mommy fall asleep at teh wheel
? perphas
. or maybe there
' s something deadlier around thte corner
, lying in wait tothe pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl
. what
' s more
, she might even liek it
. with the intent of being unfair
and unpredictable
, placing her heroine inaddition the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood
, breillat
' s extreme fluorish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt
. fat girl is a bitter pill indeed
