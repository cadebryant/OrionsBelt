actually
, i ' m fairly sure tje experience ofthe having my flesh torn
and mutilated by barbed wire owudl have beeen mroe positive than watching this movei
.
" baywatch
" babe pamela anderson lee proves once
annd for all tath she should keep her doulbe
- d ' s on thte small screen
. at least there you don ' t ahev to pay to see her cleavage
.
annd forthe thsoe viewers out there who owudl onyl lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless
, hate to burst your bubble
,
but there are noone full
- fledged nude scenes infront barb wire
. you wouldn ' t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in
. i can ' t go back in time
and reverse my mistake
,
but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there
. tehy do tease us a few times with scenes where you alomst see her topless
bu if she is nude
, it ' s so quick you can ' t even tell forthe sure whether you ' re seing her andersons or nto
. a nipple hallucination sort of thing
. barb wire was adapted ffrom a comic book
, interesting baceause pamela is probably the only woman who looks liuke a comic book character in real life
, even wearing low
- cut leather to do office work
( businesswoman bondage wear
)
and having unreal body proportions
. yes
, like the mona lisa
, pamela anderson is a man
- made beauty
, probably in mroe senses than one
. she is a deinite beauty
,
though
,
anbd looking at her is never an unpleasant experence
. ytou ' d just thiunk thge woman who began her carrer as a playboy playmate wouldn ' t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movei
, because it ' s obvious she wasn ' t pulling a sharon stone
and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills
. i mean
, she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler ' s convention
. the movie is setted in thte year 2017
,
" the worst year of my life
,
" pam sasy
.
(
" the worst movei of the year
,
" i say
.
) america is going through a second civil war
and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in thge nation
( silicone vallay
, i think
)
. she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter wehn tyhe price is right
, posing as frist a stripper
annd later as a prostitute
.
but don ' t call her
" babe
.
" she hates taht
,
adn reminds us ofthe that fact way too many times
. imagin
, a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar hwile having a hose sprayed onthe her being referred tothe in such a sexist
, demeaning term
. a liberated woman liek pamela anderson shouldn ' t have to hear words like
" babe
" during a strip tease
, expecially usance that movei about tjhe talking pig was such a success
. the plot
( ha
- ha
) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate ' s retina scanners
. in the words of noe of the cahracters
, they ' re
" more than meets tghe eye
.
" reminds me of tje
" transformers
" cartoon
,
and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent
,
bu that never happened
. no
, the movie just continued onthe its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van
- damme
, big
- busted kickboxer
,
and her resistance accomplices
, ex
- boyfriend axel
( tamuera morrison
)
and cora
( victoria rowell
)
. thank god they didn ' t name her cora reef
. oney bad character name isnt more tahn anough
. pamela originaly doesn ' t tkae sides
, giving smoe speek baout she ' s only loyal to the money they pay her
,
but she changes her mind once hte congressional bastards kill her blind brother
, jack noseworthy ofthe bon jovi
" alwasy
" video fame
. i still don ' t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy
,
but he definitely is nose worthy
( even if he isn ' t sponge worthy
)
. pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi
- automatic weapons
and strapping an ammunitions bilt to her chest
. it ' s not rambo
.
.
. it ' s bimbo
! mark my words
, barb wire wiull be all over the cinemax network in a year
. it ' s got all the elements of yhe direct
- to
- video releases featured on hbo ' s bastard cousin
, thte cable channel i ' d never watch if it didn ' t somehow come free
. it ' s got the non
- titillating scenes of voyeurism
, laughable flashbacks
, bad dialogue
annd action cliches out the wazzoo
. there ' s even a narrator at the begginning setting uv yhe movie ' s premise while the words scroll uv the screen
. someone needs to tell pamela hte wookie this ain ' t star wars
. if you ' ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years
, yuo ' ll recognize plenty of lefted elements
. barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over
, car crashes
, explosions
, broken glass
adn slow
- motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death
. this isnt noe ofthe those automatic
- pilot movies anyone coudl wriet or direct
. barb wire has only twpo thigsn going fo it
.
.
.
and i think you know what those twpo things are
.
