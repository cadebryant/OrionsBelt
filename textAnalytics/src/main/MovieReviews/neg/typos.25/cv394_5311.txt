actually
, i
' m fairly sure the experience of haveing my flesh torn
and mutilated by barbed wire owudl have been more positive tahn watching this movie
.
" baywatch
" babe pamela
anderson lee proves once
and for all that she should keep her double
- d
' s on the small screen
. at least ther you don
' t have to pay to see her cleavage
.
and for thsoe viewers outloud there who would only lay down money forthe htis movie inaddition hopes of seeing pam topless
, hite to burst your bubble
,
but ther are no full
- fledged nude scenes infact barb wire
. you wouldn
' t be reading htis review right now if i had known that fact going in
. i cxan
' t go bakc in time annd reverse my mistake
,
but i can warn other horny teenage boys outloud htere
. they do tease us a fewd times with scenes where yuo allmost see her topless
but if she isnt nude
, it
' s so quick you can
' t even tell for sure whether you
' re seeing her
andersons or not
. a nipple hallucination sort of thing
. barb wire was adapted from a comic book
, interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life
, even wearing low
- cut leather tothe dont office work
( businesswoman bondage wear
) anbd hvaing unreal body proportions
. yes
, like thte mona lisa
, pamela
anderson is a man
- made beauty
, probably inwhich moreso senses tahn one
. she is a dfeinite beauty
,
though
,
and looking at her is never an unplesant experience
. yuo
' d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn
' t have any reservations about appearing nude in tje movei
, because it
' s obvious she wasn
' t pulling a sharon stone
and trying tothe make people pay attention to her acting skills
. i mean
, she shows off more cleavage here than a jewler
' s convention
. the movie is setted iin hte eyar 2017
,
" yhe worst year of my life
,
" pam says
.
(
" tje worst movei of the year
,
" i sday
.
) america isnt going through a second civil war annd pamela is a nightclub owner infront the only free city in yhe nation
( silicone valley
, i think
)
. she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when tyhe price is right
, posing as firt a stripper
and later as a prostitute
.
but don
' t call her
" babe
.
" she hates that
,
and reminds us of tyhat fatc way too many times
. imagine
, a woman who doesnt a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred tothe in such a sexist
, demeaning term
. a liberated woman like pamela
anderson shouldn
' t have to hear words liek
" babe
" during a strip tease
, especially sicne that movie about the talking pig was such a sucess
. the plot
( ha
- ha
) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow thier wearer to pass through the congressional directorate
' s retina scanners
. in the words of one of the characters
, they
' re
" more than meets the eye
.
" reminds me of the
" transformers
" ctaroon
,
and i sure wished the movie sould somehow be transformed into something decent
,
but that never happened
. no
, tghe movei just continued on its path ofthe lame action scenes starring pamela van
- damme
, big
- busted kickboxer
,
and her resistence accomplices
, ex
- boyfriend axel
( tamuera morrison
)
and cora
( victoria rowell
)
. thank god they didn
' t nmae her cora reef
. noe bad character name is moreso than enough
. pamela originally doesn
' t take sides
, giving some speech about she
' s onyl loyal to the money they pay her
, bu she changes her mind once hte congressional bastards kill her blind brother
, jack noseworthy ofthe bon jovi
" alwasy
" video fame
. i still don
' t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy
,
but he definitely is nose worthy
( even if he isn
' t sponge worthy
)
. pam gets ready tothe avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi
- automatic weapons
and strapping an ammunitions bilt to her chest
. it
' s not rambo
.
.
. it
' s bimbo
! mark my words
, barb wire iwll be all over the cinemax network in a year
. it
' s got all the elements of the direct
- to
- video releases featured onthe hbo
' s bastard cousin
, the cable channel i
' d never watch if it didn
' t somehow come free
. it
' s got the non
- titillating scenes of voyeurism
, laughable flashbacks
, bad dialogue anbd acation cliches outloud tje wazzoo
. there
' s even a narrator at the beggining setting up thte movie
' s premise while the words scroll uv hte screen
. somone needs to tell pamela tghe wookie thsi ain
' t star wars
. if ytou
' ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years
, yuo
' ll recognize plenty of lifted elements
. barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over
, car crashes
, explosions
, broken glass
and slow
- motion shots ofthe bodies falling hundreds of feet to thier death
. tihs isnt one of those automatic
- pilot movies anyone coudl rwite or direct
. barb wire has onyl twpo thigsn going for it
.
.
.
and i think you nkwo what thsoe two things are
.
