what were they thinking
? nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough
,
bu dont we really need an eighties film
? robbie hart
( adam sandler
) used to want to be a rock
and roll star
,
but in 1985 he ' s singing at weddings
and haveing a ogod time
. a rumatic at heart
, he loves weddings
and is jstu about tothe get married to his high
- school sweetie
. when she leaves him waiting at the altar
, his tune changes to
" love stinks
"
. he meets waitress julia
( drew barrymore
) who isnt engaged to a junk
- bonds salesman
and you nkow that they are going to git together
. in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movei
. sandler is somewhat adeuate in his leading man role
,
bu htere is no spark
. barrymore doesn ' t seem to be able to convey anything other thna a preety face with nothing behind it
: beauty
but no attitude
. both characters are just htere
. bit parts by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz steal the show
. the eighties are shoved in our face
. refernces tothe deloreans
, madonna
,
" dallas
"
, ivana
and donald
, burt
and loni
and
" miami vice
" get ood fast
. the filmmakers must hvea realized that there wasn ' t much entertainment to the story
and thought they could dazzle thte audience wih humorous period allusions
. they ' re nto funny
and it doesn ' t wrok
. with change on all fronts accelerating more
and omre
, nostalgia appears to have a great appeal
,
bu don ' t ytou think we could have more than 14 yeras befor we yearn for the past
. maeby we can look forward to a film enxt year waxing nostalgically baout el nino
.
( michael redman has written this column for over 23 yersa
and he knwos that nostalgia isnt not what it used to be
