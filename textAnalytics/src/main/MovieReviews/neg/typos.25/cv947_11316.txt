what were they thinking
? nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough
,
but do we really ened an eighties film
? robbie hart
( adam s
andler
) used to wnat to be a rock adn roll star
,
but in 1985 he
' s singing at weddings
and having a ogod time
. a romantic at heart
, he loves weddings
and is just baout to git married to his high
- school sweetie
. whn she leaves him waiting at the altar
, his tune changes to
" love stinks
"
. he meets waitress julia
( drew barrymore
) who is engaged to a junk
- bonds salesman adn you nkwo that they are going tothe get together
. in fact ytou nkow everything that is going to happen during this movei
. s
andler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role
,
but there is no spark
. barrymore doesn
' t seem to be able to convey anything other than a preety face with nothing behind it
: beauty bu no atitude
. both characters are just there
. bited parts by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz steal the show
. the eighties are shoved in our face
. references to deloreans
, madonna
,
" dallas
"
, ivana anbd donald
, burt
and loni
and
" miami vice
" get ood fast
. the filmmakers must have realized taht there wasn
' t much entertainment to thte story
and throught htey could dazzle the audiance with humorous period allusions
. they
' re not funny
and it doesn
' t work
. wtih change on all fronts accelerating more adn more
, nostalgia appears tothe have a graet appeal
,
but don
' t you think we could haev more than 14 years before we yearn for the past
. maybe we can look foward tothe a film next yera waxing nostalgically about el nino
.
