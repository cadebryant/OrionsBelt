bats is this eyar
' s camp flick
. with the world
' s worst dialogue
, cheesiest premise
and stupidest editor
, this noe should be heaven for thsoe who enjoy films humurous in their inanity
. as for tjhe rest of us
, well
.
.
. i
' d say skip it
,
but looking at the box office figures for this one
, it seems as
though most ofthe america is folowing that advice anyway
. follow their lead
and you
' ll sparce yourself 90 minutes of your life
and 8 bucks tothe boot
. i love alfred hitchcock
' s tghe birds
, almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based
. it saddens me even more
, thne
, to see thyat american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror
/ schlock such as bats
. when mysterous bat attacks occur in a small texas town
, the authorities call in a batologist
( dina meyer
) to investigate
. it turns out that a creepy scientist
( bob gunton
) has genetically enhanced a couple bats taht escaped ffrom his lab
, making them smarter
and mroe vicious
. why has he done this
, you ask
? because
, you see
, it is apparently a scientist
' s job to amking things
" a little better
,
" even if thta means the death of all mankind
. so the batologist
, her wisecracking sidekick
and the town sheriff
( lou diamond phillips
) have to kill all thge bats
and save the world
. of course
, that cant
' t happn befoer htey wallow in some guamo
( bat shit
, for the uninitiated
)
, get uv close
and personel with some truly repulsive flying mammals
and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture
. consdider
, forthe exmaple
, a scene where twpo people are in a bat cave
. tje bats are all sleeping
, bu tghe humans are afraid they might wake up befoer htey cant get out
. what dont they do
? do they get tghe hell out of there as fast as they cant
? nope
. they st
and there for a while
, transfixed by the thous
ands of bats opening their eyes
. what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes
. we don
' t even get tothe see what
' s going on
; thge screen becomes a mush becasue the cuts are so quick
. all we nkow is that bats are attacking
. how they are attacking
and what exactlly isnt happening remeniss a mystery
. a littel technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies
,
and bats sure could use soem
. of course
, director louis morneau tries to liven thnigs up with some intentional humor
,
but it isnt so conventional it doesn
' t really go anywhere
. most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy ofthe the batologist
' s wisecracking sidekick
( leon
)
, who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like
" i hate bats
!
" some of theese are so bad that htey tkae on a double quality
: they may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh because they are so inept
. i hate charachters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame oen
- liners
. playing such characters does not help actors
' careers
. still
, i suppose tht if you
' re looking for a movie that is
" so bad it
' s good
,
" you could do worse than bats
. it does have a tremendous amount ofthe camp value
. i
' m not
" recommending
" tje movie because
, quite frankly
, it sucks
,
and i know that this might convince some peopel to go outloud
and see it
. omre power to them
.
