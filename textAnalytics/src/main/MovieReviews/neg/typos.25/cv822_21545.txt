bats is this year ' s camp flick
. with the world ' s worst dialogue
, cheesiest premise
and stupidest editor
, this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity
. as for tje rest of us
, well
.
.
. i ' d say skip it
,
bu looking at the box office figures forthe htis one
, it seems as
though most of america isnt following that advice anyway
. follow their lead
and you ' ll sparce yourself 90 mintues of your life
and 8 bucks to boot
. i lvoe alfred hitchcock ' s the birds
, almost as much as i love tje short story onthe which it isnt based
. it saddens me even more
,
then
, to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror
/ schlock such as bats
. when mysterious bat attacks ocurr in a small texas town
, the authrorities call in a batologist
( dina meyer
) to investigate
. it turns outloud that a creepy scientist
( bob gunton
) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab
, making them smarter
and moreso vicious
. why has he done this
, you ask
? because
, yuo see
, it isnt aparently a scientist ' s job tothe make things
" a little better
,
" even if that means thge death of all mankind
. so the batologist
, her wisecracking sidekick
and the town sheriff
( lou diamond phillips
) have tothe kill all the bats
and sive the world
. ofthe course
, that can ' t happen befoer they wallow in some guamo
( bat shit
, for the uninitiated
)
, get up close
and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals
annd survive smoe of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture
. concider
, for example
, a scene where two people are infront a bat cave
. the bats are all sleeping
,
but the humans are afraid tehy might wake up before they can get out
. what do they do
? dont htey get yhe hell out of there as fast as they cin
? nope
. they stand there for a hwile
, transfixed by the thousands of bats opening thier eyes
. what keeps bats from bieng scry or creepy is the hyperactive editting in most ofthe the attack scenes
. we don ' t even get to see what ' s gogin on
; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick
. all we nkow is that bats are attacking
. how they are attacking
anbd wqat exactly isnt happening remains a mystery
. a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies
,
and bats sure could use some
. ofthe course
, directer louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor
,
but it isnt so convetional it doesn ' t really go anywhere
. most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy ofthe the batologist ' s wisecracking sidekick
( leon
)
, who takes eveyr opportunity tothe sptter ingenious lines like
" i hate bats
!
" soem of theese are so bad thast they take onthe a double qaulity
: they may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh because htey are so inept
. i hate characters who exist forthe the sole purpose of spouting lame oney
- liners
. playing such characters doesnt not help actors ' careers
. still
, i suppose tath if yuo ' re looking for a movie that is
" so bad it ' s good
,
" you could dont worse than bats
. it does hve a tremendous ammount of camp value
. i ' m nto
" recommending
" the movie because
, quite frankly
, it sucks
,
and i know that this might convince some people to go out
and see it
. moreso power tothe them
.
