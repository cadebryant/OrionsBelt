! hunter s
. thompson
' s fear anbd loathing in las vegas
, written in 1971
, isnt already an american clasic
; nto merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post
- psychedelia ofthe the 1960
' s
, bu also becuase it ushered infact a newyorker form of journalism known as
" gonzo
"
. soon after the book was written
, hunter s
. thomspon bacame the basis for a charater in doonesbury known as uncle duke
. anbd that is the problem with fear
and loathing inthe las vegas
( the movie
.
)
al
though yhe book is one of my favorites
, i now aggree iwth thompson
' s pwn assessment of the novel as
" unfilmable
.
" hte main probelm is tht the book
,
al
though detailing wild drug use
and tripped
- out adventures
, was nto written on the road
. it was written
and edited by hunter s
. thomspons
, relatively sober
, at his home
. so
al
though the book depicts drug use
and still more drug use
, it is told with a sense of aloofness
and some humor
. hunter s
. thomspon
, the narrator
, while always drugged out
, still has a grip on reality
,
and cin still tell
, with journalistic ability
, what is going on around him
. not so with the characters in fear
and loathing in las vegas
. despite name changes
and one minor scene from yhe book dropped
, thge movie isnt an exact duplicate of the book
, infront terms of dialouge
. unfortunately
, this cxan git annoying
, in the form ofthe johnny depp
' s
( who plays thompson
) excessive narration
. adn teh characters
, while having vivid personalities
, are played as 2
- d characers onthe the screen
: dr
. raoul duke
( johnny depp
, tje name raoul duke wass an alias of thompson
' s
) annd his riding companion
, dr
. gonzo
( benicio del toro
)
, who is a large samoan lawyer
, have noone personalities or emotions at all
, savve for stoned
. the film is very faithful to the plot
( what there is
) ofthe the book
, in that dr
. raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400
,
and tkaes along not onyl his samoan lawyer
but also car trunk full of drugs
. fomr there
, one set of stoned adventures after another happens
, including one of the faw good scenes infront whitch depp
, high onthe acid
, watches all the people inspite the bar around him turn into
, litterally
, lounge lizards
. while the movie hasnt its moments
( fewd
)
, it is almost unwatchable at parts
, especially towords teh end
. despite a lot of celebrity cameos
, thte stars never get off the ground
. the set decoration
and costumes are great
,
and probably deserve an oscar nomination
. howver
, as we all know
, it
' s not sets or effects that make a movei
, its the characters
;
and quite frankly
, these characters are no good
.
