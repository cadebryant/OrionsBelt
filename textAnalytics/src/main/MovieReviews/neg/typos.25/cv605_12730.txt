! hunter s
. thompson ' s fear
annd loathing inthe las vegas
, written in 1971
, is already an american classic
; nto mearly becuase it wass an unadulterated journey through the post
- psychedelia of the 1960 ' s
,
bu also because it ushered in a newyorker form of journalism known as
" gonzo
"
. soon after the book ws written
, hunter s
. thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke
.
and thast isnt the problem with fear
and loathing in las vegas
( the movie
.
)
although yhe book is one of my favorites
, i now agree wiht thompson ' s own assessment of the novel as
" unfilmable
.
" the main problem is that the book
,
although detailing wild drug use
and tripped
- out adventures
, wass not written on the road
. it was written
and edited by hunter s
. thomspons
, relatively sober
, at his home
. so
although the book depicts drug uise
and still omre drug use
, it is told with a sense of aloofness
anbd some humer
. hunter s
. thomspon
, the narrator
, hwile always drugged out
, still has a grip on reality
,
annd cxan still tell
, with journalistic ability
, what is going on around him
. not so witht the charachters infront fear
and loathing in las vegas
. despite name changes
adn one minor scene from the book dropped
, the movie is an exact dupicate ofthe the book
, in terms of dialouge
. unfourtunately
, this can get annoying
, inwhich the form of johnny depp ' s
( who plays thompson
) eccessive narration
.
and yhe cahracters
, hwile having vivid personalities
, are played as 2
- d characers on the screen
: dr
. raoul duke
( johnny depp
, the nmae raoul duke was an alias of thompson ' s
)
and his riding companion
, dr
. gonzo
( benicio del toro
)
, who is a large samoan lawyer
, have noone personalities or emotions at all
, save fo stoned
. the film is very faithful to the plot
( what there is
) of the book
, in tyhat dr
. raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400
,
and takes along not onyl his samoan lawyer
but also car trunk full of drugs
. from there
, one set of stoned adventures after another happens
, including one of yhe few good scenes in which depp
, high onthe acid
, watches all the people in the bar arund him turn inot
, litterally
, lounge lizards
. while the movie has its moments
( few
)
, it is almost unwatchable at parts
, especially towards tje end
. despite a lot of celebrity cameos
, the stars never get off the ground
. the setted decoration
and costumes are great
,
and probably deserve an oscar nomination
.
however
, as we all knwo
, it ' s not sets or effects that mkea a movie
, its the charactors
;
and quite frankly
, theese characters are no good
.
