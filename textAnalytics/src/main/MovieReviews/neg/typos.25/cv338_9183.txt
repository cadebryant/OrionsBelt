wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic propotions
. over black anbd white drawings
, we are told thast the earth isnt destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange
, sending the remnants of humanity thru generations of radiation
- induced mutation
. the
" original
" inhabitants of the earth
, fairies annd elves
, return to populate the globe
, along with their evil
, mutant counterparts
. one day
(
and i say
" oen day
" not tothe be trite
,
but because thta
' s exactlly how it happened
- no advance notice
)
, a fairy queen gives birth to twins
, one good
and one evil
. the twins grow up to be powerful wizards
, the good oen embracing magic
,
and hte bad oen utilizing technology to attempt to exp
and his evil empire
. we are given the notion tath an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic
and those of technology
. as unoriginal as the premise is
, i was still somewhat interseted in how this stoyr would play itself outloud
. ther
' s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world
, after all
. i soon learned
,
however
, thyat the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film
. once the transition was made fomr still art tothe color animation
, an entirely different feel tkaes precidence
. rather than the epic saga promised by the narration
, we get a goofy
- looking world of a saterday morning cartoon
. nto just the look
, mind you
, bu all the zany soudns like
> honk boing for eyars
, blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good
, usance his armies of ogres
and other mutants woudl git dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined
. howver
, blackwolf now has a secrte weapon
: nazis
. yup
, adolf hitler
, the luftwaffe
and the wehrmacht
. okay
, not the real thnigs
,
but an archival film his minions dug up
. projected into the sky forthe all to see
, it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy inot submission long enough fo the ogres to hack them up
. before ytou know it
, there are dead elves everywhere
. this isnt just as well
. the characters are so bad that thte viewer doesn
' t care about any of them
. they
' re either silly
, sappy
, or both
. the dialog gets much of the credit for tihs
. an exmaple is when avatar nonchalantly sasy
,
" well
, looks like my brother
and i begin our final battle
.
" not very formidable when he
' s also the guy who says
,
" thsi is the biggest bummer of a trip i
' ve ever beeen onthe
.
" my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can
' t fight back against tjhe nazi
- charged evil
. her response is
,
" htey haev weapons
and technology
. we just have love
.
" suffice to say
, tyhe characters are strikely twpo
- dimensional
,
and we therefore don
' t expect anything more than the obvious to happen
. which it doesnt
. the only unexpected occurrence is the way yhe final battle betwen brothers isnt plyed out
, which is anticlimactic
and disappointing
. please note that it is the action thast is unexpected
. thast it is disappointing isnt not
. the film couldn
' t suttle on a particular mood
. it seems to move from dark to ight with the cuts from scene to scene
and even angle tothe angle
. scenes which are seamingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts ofthe levity
. the dramatics
, whitch seem to occur at r
andom
, are overly staged
and overly acted
, detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which sould otherwise be gleaned
. ralph bakshi
, the director
, makse an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film
: hitler
and the nazis were bad
. so who doesn
' t nkwo this alread
? well
, maybe children
. okay
, so you might say tath htis isnt a movei for children
. it
' s not
. inaddition the scenes where good fights evil
, htere
' s a lot ofthe violence anbd gore that children should not be seeing if they
' re watching a ctaroon
. so is tyhe film fo adults
? if so
, we probably don
' t need tothe be bashed over the head to get the point
. why not hvea the bad guys be symbolic of thte nazis instead of using ood propog
anda in a seriously disjointed attempt tothe show us something we already know
? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks
and airplanes
,
and hitler giving speeches
.
however
, we don
' t see any reason why they shoud be considered bad
. we see no atrocities bieng committed
, not even any real battle footage
. there isnt absolutely no connection made between the armies ofthe evil
and the third reich
,
and we
' re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuf is inspiring in tjhe first palce
. this needed to be throught outloud much moreso thouroughly if a point were tothe be made
, since subject matter such as htis deserves better treatment
. i
' d like to assume that bakshi ws trying tothe sday that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anyhwere
, at any tiome
, anbd we must therfore be vigilant
.
however
, i
' m not sure if i want tothe give him taht much credit
.
