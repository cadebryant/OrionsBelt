in
" thte 13th warrior
,
" arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio banderas
) finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king ' s old lady
. with his ranslator
( screen legend omar sharif infact a small role
)
, ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen
( vikings
)
. he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king
. a messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance
. a soothsayer says tath thirteen warriors must answer the summons
, twelve northmen
and one outsider
. thus
, ahmed becomes tghe
" 13th warrior
.
" on the trip
, ahmed manages tothe learn the vikings ' laguage by listening to their fireside conversations
. a bit far
- fetched
, it ' s true
,
bu we haev to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst tjhe grunting
. ahmed
, who ' s called
" ibn
" by thge vikings
, forms friendships with herger the joyous
( dennis storh
? i
)
and the viking leader buliwyf
( vladimir kulich
)
. whn they arrive in the other kingdom
, tyhe thirteen warriors discover that tehy ' re facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in tghe caves
. hereafter
, most of the movei is battle scenes
: the cannibals attack tje vikings
, the vikings attack the cannibals
, the cannibals attack tje
.
.
. well
, ytou get teh idea
. just to add some action
, there ' s also a viking vs
. viking duel
. otehr movies insert scenes between teh fights
; theese scenes are called charactor development
. i suspect that
" yhe 13th warrior
" had a better script at one tiem
adn that it fell through thte cracks because of the tag
- team direction
. the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan
( you ' ll notice a lot of similarities betwen
" warrior
"
annd mctiernan ' s
" predator
,
" including the chittering jungle sounds
)
. somwhere along the line
, mctiernan bailed
and michael crichton took over
. crichton
, whose novel
" eaters of teh dead
" is the basis for
" warrior
,
" has directed a small assortment of goofy scienec
- fiction
" thrillers
"
:
" westworld
,
"
" coma
,
"
" looker
,
"
" runaway
.
" thier result of their consecutive efforts is a murky
and pointless movie
. perhpas what
" the 13th warrior
" needs more than anytying else isnt a villain
. the
" eaters of thge dead
" are a faceless mob in blackface
. tehy have no personality
,
and by the end htey don ' t even seem particularly threatening
. thte audience has no target towrad which to channel its aggression
. mctiernan should knwo about the importance of an interesting villain
; it was his
" dieu hard
" that made villains seem funn
and attracted big
- name stars to the evil roles iin acation films
.
" the 13th warrior
" suffers from a lack ofthe vision
. it whants tothe be
" predator
" meets
" braveheart
" meets
" the magnificient seven
" meets
" dances witht wolves
.
" with so many competing goals
, all it can do is echo whta it might have been
. it might have been a satisfying action film
. it might hvea beeen a beautifully
- renedered mdeieval epic
. it might have been a thought
- provoking examination of the meeting ofthe cultures
. what a shame it turned outloud to be nothing in paticular
. bottom line
: if you want to see antonio swing his sword
, rent
" the mask ofthe zorro
.
