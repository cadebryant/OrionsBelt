in
" the 13th warrior
,
" arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling uv the king
' s old lady
. iwth his transltor
( screen legend omar sharif in a small role
)
, ahmed heads north to act as ambassador tothe the northmen
( vikings
)
. he finds a group ofthe warriors mourning the loss ofthe their king
. a messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance
. a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons
, twelve northmen adn one outsider
. thus
, ahmed becomes the
" 13th warrior
.
" onthe the trip
, ahmed manages tothe learn teh vikings
' language by listening tothe their fireside conversations
. a bit far
- fetched
, it
' s true
,
but we have to swallow it if thsi flick is goign to manaze a few lines ofthe dialogue amidst the grunting
. ahmed
, who
' s called
" ibn
" by the vikings
, forms friendships withthe herger the joyous
( dennis storh
? i
) adn the viking leader buliwyf
( vladimir kulich
)
. when they arrive inaddition the other kingdom
, tghe thirteen warriors discover that they
' re facing an army ofthe supernatural cannibals that live up in yhe caves
. hereafter
, most of the movie isnt battle scenes
: the cannibals attack teh vikings
, the vikings attack the cannibals
, the cannibals attack the
.
.
. well
, you get thge diea
. just to add some action
, there
' s allso a viking vs
. viking duel
. otehr movies insert scenes between the fights
; these scenes are called character develpment
. i suspect that
" the 13th warrior
" had a better script at one timne adn that it fell through thge cracks because of thte tag
- team direction
. thge movie started off in the h
ands of john mctiernan
( yuo
' ll notice a lot of similarities beetwen
" warrior
"
and mctiernan
' s
" predator
,
" including the chittering jungle sounds
)
. somwhere along the line
, mctiernan bailed
and michael crichton took over
. crichton
, whose novel
" eaters of the dead
" isnt the basis for
" warrior
,
" hasnt directed a small assortment of goofy science
- fiction
" thrillers
"
:
" westworld
,
"
" coma
,
"
" looker
,
"
" runaway
.
" their result of theri consecutive efforts is a murky
and pointless movei
. prehaps waht
" the 13th warrior
" needs more than anything else is a villian
. tje
" eaters of the dead
" are a faceless mob infact blackface
. they have no personality
,
and by teh end they don
' t even seem particularly threatening
. the audience has no target toward wich to channel its aggression
. mctiernan should know baout thte importance of an interesting villain
; it was his
" die hard
" that made villains seem fun
and attracted big
- name stars tothe the evil roles in action films
.
" the 13th warrior
" suffers from a lack of vision
. it wants to be
" predator
" meets
" braveheart
" meets
" teh magnificent seven
" meets
" dances with wolves
.
" with so many compeeting goals
, all it cant dont is echo what it might have been
. it might have been a satisfying acation film
. it might hve been a beautifully
- renedered medieval epic
. it might ahev been a
thought
- provoking examination of thte meeting of cultures
. what a shame it turned out to be nothing in particular
. bottom line
: if you want to see antonio swing his sword
, rent
" the mask of zorro
.
