wow
, a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever
. i
' m amazed that somene
thought this was a story that must be told on screen
. many blacks in hollywood complain that tehy are nto nominated for awards based on theri race
. i thiunk firt they ened to concentrate their energy on themselfs
,
and stop making movies whic makes them look like nothing more than sex
- crazed buffoons
. even i
' m offended by it
. bill bellamy is a
" payler
" which means he sleeps with a lot of women
and lies to them
. what a pleasant main charactor
. one day
, his firends decide that they want to fidn outloud how to be a player
. why they deside this
" one day
" i have no idea
. how many eyasr have they been firends
and why all ofthe a sudden would they want to learn
? anyway
, bellamy agrees to teach
,
and his wonderfull lesson tothe his firends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex wiht women
. this is the bulk ofthe the film folks
, guys riding from house to house
, one keeps getting outloud to hvea sex
, hwile the others sit in the car
. since russell simmons isnt producer
,
and since the official title ofthe the film is
" def jam
' s how to be a player
"
, i was ready to be jumping up
and down
and stomping my feet
and beating tjhe person next to me because of the comedy
. amazingly
, aside from gilbert gottfried
' s 90 seconds of screen time
, there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner
. instead of jokes
, there
' s just an endless stream of profanity
and naked breasts
( adn naked breasts aren
' t so bad
,
but naked breasts alone don
' t make a ogod movie
)
. be sure tothe bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well
. gilbert gottfried
' s charater serves as one in his very brief appearance
, asking forthe explanations as to waht is bieng said
. they should ahve brought him allong fo hte entire film
.
