warner brothers hasnt scored another marketing coup
. the oen
- two punch was started in the summer
, wiht the release of batman forever
. trailers for ace ventura 2 weere bundled with tje bat
, ensuring that every jim carrey fan in tje free world would knwo about the impending sequel
. carrey went onthe to win raves as hte riddler
adn yhe ever
- wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video
(
$ 11
. 99 at wal
- mart
)
; a mere two weeks befor carrey ' s return in tihs marketwise
,
but misfired comedy
. ace ventura
: when nature calls isnt a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber
- faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled enviornment
. he may have been brilliant under the direction ofthe joel schumacher
, in batman forever
,
but
, here
, left to his own devices
, carrey quickly wears outloud his welcome
. hte oppening sequence is by far tghe best
-
- an amusing spoof ofthe cliffhanger
, with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon
.
( you can guess what happens to mr
. paws
. hint
: it sounds like splat
.
) the plot quickly shifts to a temple inaddition the himalayas
,
and
then tothe not
- so
- darkest africa
, where ace is onthe thge case of a missing white bat
. with his hair
and limbs both wildly askew
, carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes
. tje rest of the film is just more of the same
. sure
, yhe plot ' s linear
,
and teh production values solid
,
but where is teh scripted humor to support carrey ' s sloppy slathering
? writer
and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set
- ups
. instead
, carrey jsut mugs away
, playing for tjhe camera even when most of it isn ' t funny
. the better gags have been shown inaddition teh ads
,
though a bit with ace emerging buck
- naked fomr tghe backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see
.
though an arguable improvement over the original
, ace ventura
: when nature calls isnt still a snooze for anyone over tjhe age of ten
. tyhe script is virtually devoid ofthe wit
. tribal mask jokes
? jerry lewis cameos
? foreget it
. if anything
, the inexplicable presence of simon callow
( four weddings
and a funeral
)
anbd bob gunton
( tyhe shawshank redemption
) suggests that wokring withthe carrey is the clasical actor ' s ultimate challenge
. jsut how long
* can
* they keep a straight face
?
