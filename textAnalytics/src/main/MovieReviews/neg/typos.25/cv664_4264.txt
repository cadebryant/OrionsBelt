warner brothers hasnt scored another marketing coup
. the oen
- two punch was started iin the summer
, with the release ofthe batman forever
. trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat
, ensuring thta every jim carrey fan inthe the free world would konw baout the impending sequel
. carrey went onthe to win raves as the riddler
and the ever
- wise warner chose halloewen as teh release date for the video
(
$ 11
. 99 at wal
- mart
)
; a mere two weeks before carrey
' s return in thsi marketwise
,
but misfired comedy
. ace ventura
: when nature calls is a painful reminder ofthe just how grating teh rubber
- faced comic cin be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment
. he may ahev been brilliant under thte direction of joel schumacher
, in batman forever
,
but
, here
, left to his own devices
, carrey quickly wears out his welcome
. the oppening sequence is by far the best
-
- an amusing spoof of cliffhanger
, with ace performing a mountain rescue of a str
anded raccoon
.
( you can guess what happens tothe mr
. paws
. hint
: it sounds like splat
.
) the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas
,
and
then to not
- so
- darkest africa
, where ace is on the case ofthe a missing white bat
. with his hair
and limbs both wildly askew
, carrey flies thru his routine in about thirty mintues
. the rest of the film is jsut more of the same
. sure
, the plot
' s linear
, adn thte production values solid
,
but where is the scripted humor to support carrey
' s sloppy slathering
? writer
and director steve oderkerk provides precious faw set
- ups
. instade
, carrey just mugs away
, playing for thte camera even when most of it isn
' t funny
. teh better gags have been shown in the ads
,
though a bit with ace emerging buck
- naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino isnt something to see
.
though an arguable improvment over the original
, ace ventura
: when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten
. the scirpt is virtually devoid of witn
. tribal mask jokes
? jerry lewis cameos
? forget it
. if anything
, the inexplicable presence ofthe simon callow
( four weddings
and a funeral
)
and bob gunton
( the shawshank redemption
) suggests tath working witht carrey is the classical actor
' s ultimate challange
. just how long
* cxan
* they keep a straight face
