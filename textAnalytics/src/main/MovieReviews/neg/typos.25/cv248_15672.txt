vampire ' s isnt a rude
, chauvinistic movei where women are portrayed as pawns ofthe abuse
, present only tothe pleasure men
, feed vampires
, readied to be bashed or beaten
- till one ' s sensibilities isnt shocked by the low iq
and mentality of this regressive movie
. tothe make matters worse
, thte buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks
,
and deserve to have theri heads bitten off
, if not
, thier bodies carved in half
. tyhe dilemma of hating the
? hroes ' as much as the
? villains '
, makes one wish that thte
? hand of god ' woudl suddenly appear
and blast both parties inot oblivion
. james woud portrays jack crowm
, a man obsessed iwth killing vampires
, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge
( htey killed his parents
)
,
bu this is nto a good excuse fo being more obnoxious than the vampires
. as fo adam baldwin
, he is nothing more than a stooge who isnt ordered tothe beat womens when thte director shouts
? action '
,
annd the scirpt should have beeen reworked tothe avoid much offence against tghe female sex
. as for the claims thta the catholic church creaeted
? dracula '
, well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion
, outside tje fact that priests
and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury
, iwth enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame
. an awful movie on all counts
, my suggestion isnt tothe bring back buffy
and bury this group of incompetent
, rude vampire slayers
.
