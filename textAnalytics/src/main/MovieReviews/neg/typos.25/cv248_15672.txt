vampire
' s is a rude
, chauvinistic movie where women are protrayed as pawns ofthe abuse
, present only to pleasure men
, feed vampires
, readied to be bashed or beaten
- till one
' s sensibilities is shocked by the low iq anbd mentality of this regressive movei
. to amking matters worse
, the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks
,
and deserve to have their heads bitten off
, if not
, thier bodies carved in half
. the dilemma of hating the
? heroes
' as much as the
? villains
'
, makes one wish that the
? h
and of god
' would suddenly apearing
and blast both parties into oblivion
. james woud portrays jack crow
, a man obssessed with killing vampires
, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge
( tehy killed his parents
)
,
but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires
. as for adam baldwin
, he is nothing more than a stooge who isnt ordered to beat women when the director shouts
? action
'
, annd the scirpt should hve been reworked to avoid much offence against tjhe female sex
. as for the claimes that the catholic church created
? dracula
'
, well thgat is yhe second most sacrilegious suggestion
, outside the fatc that priests
and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury
, withthe enough blood spilled to make the inquisition look tame
. an awful movie on all counts
, my suggestion is to bring back buffy
and bury this group of incompetent
, rude vampire slayers
.
