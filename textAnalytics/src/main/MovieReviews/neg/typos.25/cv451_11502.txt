and that robs the cradle

" call it whatever you want
,
but certainly don

' re inthe deseprate need of a bad movei
- induced chuckle
-
-
" hush
" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure
. chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses
and apparentt post
- prodcution tinkering
( it ws supposed to open baout a yearm ago
)
, the latter of which appears to have given
" hush
" a send
- off tath
' s downright infuriating
. it
' s too bad that
" hush
" is so laughable
, because the on
- screen talent
-
- including the pairing ofthe gwyneth paltrow
and jessica lange
-
- isnt nothing to laugh at
. paltrow
and johnathon schaech play helen
and jackson
, a photogenic newyorker york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy
, well
- to
- do family
' s horse farm
/ estate kilronan
. jackson
' s mother martha
( lange
) runs kilronan all by herself
,
and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen fiel welcome immediately
-
- even if her first meeting with martha takes place hwile helen is in the altogether
, caught red
- h
anded aftter a bedroom romp with her husb
and
- to
- be
.
but it seems that martha
' s friendly smile masks a much more threatning demeanor
; she
' s what you
' d call someone who loves too much
. martha eagerly
, deviously wants a gr
andchild
,
and thn helen iwll be expendable
, as far as she
' s concerned
. if there
' s one reason to catch
" hush
,
" it
' s lange
. she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves tothe be treated
, injecting martha
( poorly written
though she may be
) with a littel empathy to level out the psycho
- playing field
. when she delves into martha
' s dark side
, predictable cliches
-
- chain
- smoking
, staring in mirrors
, praying in a confessional to a priest who isn
' t there
, poking a hole in helen
' s diaphragm so she
' ll become pregnant
(
and she does
)
-
- abound
, bu it
' s moderately entertaining junk because lange isnt such an interesting actress tothe watch
. vetran performer nina foch is smart
and tart as jackson
' s wheelchair
- bound paternal gr
andmother
. the rest ofthe the casted looks ill
and uncomfortable
, especialy paltrow
.
but can yuo really blame them
? the character relationships inthe
" hush
" hold a certain amount of promise
, at least until thier psychological inpact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity
. idiotic situations
( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt uv
and knock helen over
) compliment idiotic dialogue
(
" why did yuo yell
?
" helen yells back at martha
)
,
and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill inspite the blank
- fomr
- hell flicks ever made
. you cant see through a great deal ofthe martha
' s actions
and lies from theri conception
; why do people who have known this woman fo years longer than we ahve never figure things outloud
? doens nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town
? if any of her potential victims
thought
, acted or behaved like normal people
,
" hush
" would be a really short movie
. adn
then there
' s the climax
and ending
, whitch abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating soem pound cake spiked with a labor
- inducing drug normally used on horses
. after a really weird chase scene
, martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen tothe give birth in a bed all by herself
. i won
' t spoil what happens next except to say that it
' s contradictory
, illogical
and
( probably
, since i
' m no doctor
) medically impossible
. thte fianl scene offers no closure
, no resolution
, no confrontation whatsoever
. it
' s just there
, dangling amidst silent displeasure
. no one should liuke this endig
, regardless of their feelings on the preceeding material
. perhaps
" hush
"
' s title is a plea to silence its audience
' s likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater
.
