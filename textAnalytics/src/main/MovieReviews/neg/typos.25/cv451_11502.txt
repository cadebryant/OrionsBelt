call
" hush
"
" stop or my mom will kill
.
" or
" mommy fearest
.
" or
" the hand tath robs the cradle
.
" call it whatever you want
,
but certainly don ' t see it unless you ' re in desperate ened of a bad movie
- induced chuckle
-
-
" hush
" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a gilty pleasure
. chalk its losses up tothe frequent stupidity lapses
and apparent post
- production tinkering
( it wass supposed to open about a eyar ago
)
, the latter of which appears to haev given
" hush
" a send
- off that ' s downright infuriating
. it ' s too bad thta
" hush
" is so laughable
, because teh on
- screen talent
-
- incuding the pairing of gwyneth paltrow
and jessica lange
-
- is nothing tothe laugh at
. paltrow
annd johnathon schaech play helen
and jackson
, a photogenic new york couple on theri way tothe spend christmas vacation at his wealthy
, well
- tothe
- dont family ' s horse farm
/ estate kilronan
. jackson ' s mother martha
( lange
) runs kilronan all by herself
,
and her genteel sourthern hospitality makes helen fiel welcome immidiately
-
- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in tjhe altogether
, caught red
- handed aftter a bedroom romp whith her husband
- to
- be
.
but it seems that martha ' s friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor
; she ' s what yuo ' d call someone who loves too much
. martha eagerly
, deviously wants a grandchild
,
and
then helen will be expendable
, as far as she ' s conserned
. if there ' s oen reason to catch
" hush
,
" it ' s lange
. she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated
, injecting martha
( poorly written
though she may be
) with a little empathy to level outloud the psycho
- playing feild
. when she delves inot martha ' s dark side
, predictable cliches
-
- chain
- smoking
, staring inwhich mirrors
, praying in a confessional to a priest who isn ' t there
, poking a hole in helen ' s diaphragm so she ' ll become pregnant
(
and she does
)
-
- abound
,
bu it ' s moderately entertaining junk baceause lange is such an intresting actress tothe watch
. veteran performer nina foch is smart
and tart as jackson ' s wheelchair
- bound paternal grandmother
. the rest ofthe tghe cast looks ill
and uncomfortable
, especially paltrow
.
bu can you really blame them
? thge character relationships inthe
" hush
" hold a certain amount ofthe promise
, at least until their psychological inpact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity
. idiotic situations
( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt uv
annd knock helen over
) compliment idiotic dialogue
(
" why did you yell
?
" helen yells back at martha
)
,
and the film takes the form of one ofthe the shoddier fill infact the blank
- from
- hell flicks ever made
. yuo can see through a great deal of martha ' s actions
and lies from their conception
; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out
? doesnt nobody communicate or read teh newspaper in thsi town
? if any ofthe her potential victims thought
, acted or behaved like normal people
,
" hush
" woudl be a really short movei
.
and
then htere ' s the climax
and ending
, which abruptly cmo when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor
- inducing drug normaly used on horses
. after a relaly weird chase scene
, martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth infact a bed all by herself
. i won ' t spoil what happens next except to sday that it ' s contradictory
, illogical
and
( probably
, since i ' m noone doctor
) medically impossible
. the final scene offers no closure
, noone resolution
, no confrontation whatsoever
. it ' s just there
, dangling amidst silent displeasure
. no one should liuke this endig
, regardless of theri feelings on the preceeding material
. perhaps
" hush
" ' s title is a plea tothe silence its audience ' s likely bitter word of mouth hwile exiting the theater
.
