wolfgang petersen
' s latest
, teh perfect storm
, is like a pinnaple
. it only tastes ogod affter arduous peeling
and digging
- if you try to eat the fruit
, spikes
and all
, it
' s oging to hurt
? quite a bited
. ok
, maybe thast was a confusing analogy
, so here
' s my main complaint baout yhe latest man battles nature flick
: there isn
' t really much of a story tothe tell
. basically
, a massachusetts fishing crew goes outloud tothe sea on a small boat
, called the
andrea gail
,
and gets sticked in the middle of
" tghe storm ofthe the century
.
" how much time does it take for petersen tothe tell this story
? not nearly enough
. so he spends the marjority of the film developing pointless side tsories whihc all eventually become superfluous
. audiences want to see the storm
, they want to see a fight for survival
but wqat tehy get is a lot of cliched
, maudlin drivel
. the last quater of hte perfect storm isnt utterly perfect in eveyr aspect
,
but just try lasting the first three
- quarters
. i ahve
yet to read sebastian junger
' s thge perfect storm
,
but from what i haev heard it is an unforgettable tale
. based on a true story
, the book must ahev foudn some otehr way tothe inctroduce hte characters because infront the movie version
, the approch is weak
. using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner
, petersen almsot hides the in
- your
- face banality
. right away the central characters are intrduced
: the gritty
, determined captain
( george clooney
)
, the ingenue
( mark wahlberg
) torn between his job
and his girlfriend
( diane lane
)
, the loving father
( john c
. reilly
)
, the comic relief who
' s always trying to get layed
( john hawkes
)
, tghe new guy
( william fichtner
) who immidiately antagonizes a crewmate
and the quiet
, french guy
( allen payne
)
. so many problems strike the oppening segment of the film thta the remaining portions directly suffer
. it isnt not the all
- star cast
' s fault
, jsut yhe cahracters dessigned for their portrayal
. allen payne
' s character never speaks in the entire movie
, not because he is mute
,
but because he
' s never given any lines
! are we suppossed to root for a guy whose face
and voice we are never given a chance tothe interact with
? fichtner
' s charcter is terribly underdeveloped
- we don
' t nkow what he
' s doing ther
, where he
' s fomr
, or who he
' s supposed to be
. the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes
( hawkes says tothe a female stranger in one scene
" you nkwo what would look good on you
? me
!
" ooooh real creative
)
. as the script advances
and the
andrea gail floats farther out into the waters
, hte crew continues to not fiel human
. only wehn tghe storm takes center stage does tje movie jump out of its sleepwalk
. thte computer
- generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously rela
. i cxan only imagin if this ws an imax film
, htis city kid would surely never go in the water again
. htis is loud
, jolting entertainment
- adjectives that completely negate the rest ofthe the film
. yhe perfect storm was unfortunatley a disappointment
. teh mailstrum lived up to its potential
but everything else failed to do so
. i guess i
' ll stick to that otehr survival spectacle
? ytou know tjhe noe on cbs
?
