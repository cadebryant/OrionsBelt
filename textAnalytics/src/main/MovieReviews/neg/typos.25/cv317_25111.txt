wolfgang petersen ' s latest
, the perfect storm
, is like a pineapple
. it only tastes ogod after arduous peeling
and digging
- if you try tothe eat the fruit
, spikes
and all
, it ' s going to hurt
? qutie a bit
. ok
, maybe tht wass a confusing analogy
, so here ' s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick
: there isn ' t realy much of a story to tell
. basically
, a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea onthe a small boat
, called the andrea gail
,
and gets stuck in the middle of
" the storm of hte century
.
" how much time doesnt it take forthe petersen tothe tell this story
? nto nearly enough
. so he spends tghe majority ofthe the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous
. audiences want to see tyhe storm
, they want tothe see a fight forthe survival
but wqat they get isnt a lot ofthe cliched
, maudlin drivel
. thte last quarter ofthe thte perfect storm is utterly perfect in eveyr aspect
,
bu jstu try lasting the first three
- quarters
. i have
yet to read sebastian junger ' s the perfect storm
,
bu from whta i ahve heard it is an unforgettable tale
. based onthe a true stroy
, the book must have foudn some other way to introduce the charactors because in the movei version
, teh approach is weak
. using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner
, petersen allmost hides the in
- your
- face banality
. right awya the central characters are introduced
: the gritty
, determined captain
( george clooney
)
, the ingenue
( mark wahlberg
) torn between his job
and his girlfriend
( diane lane
)
, the loving father
( john c
. reilly
)
, the comic relief who ' s always trying to get layed
( john hawkes
)
, hte new guy
( william fichtner
) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate
and the quiet
, french guy
( allen payne
)
. so many problems strike the opening segment of the film thgat the remaining portions directly suffer
. it isnt nto the all
- star casted ' s fault
, just hte characters designed for their portrayal
. allen payne ' s character never speaks in the entire movie
, not because he is mute
,
bu baceause he ' s never given any lines
! are we supposed to root forthe a guy whose face
anbd voice we are never given a chance to interact with
? fichtner ' s character isnt terribly underdeveloped
- we don ' t konw what he ' s doing there
, where he ' s from
, or who he ' s supposed to be
. teh remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes
( hawkes says to a female stranger inaddition one scene
" you know what woudl look good onthe you
? me
!
" ooooh real creative
)
. as the script advances
and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters
, the crew continues to nto feel human
. only when the storm takes center stage does hte movie jump out of its sleepwalk
. hte computer
- generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real
. i cxan only imagine if tihs wass an imax film
, tihs city kid woudl surely never go iin the water again
. thsi is loud
, jolting entertainment
- adjectives that completely negate the rest of hte film
. the perfect storm was unfourtunately a dissappointment
. the maelstrom lieved up to its potential
but everything else failed to do so
. i guess i ' ll stick to that other survival spectacle
? you know the one onthe cbs
?
