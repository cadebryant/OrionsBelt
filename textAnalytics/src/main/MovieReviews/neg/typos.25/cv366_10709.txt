- appointed sucessot
, who
' s psychotic
,
and thinks it
' s a great idea to spend a week whith him
and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundered miles from civilization with noone dependable transporation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall
. comments
: tracks of a killer had a couple ofthe strikes against it before i even began watching it
. strike one was the fact thta somene had scrawled the word garbage onthe the videotape
' s sticker in black marker
( not typically a good sign wehn you rent a film
)
. strike twpo came while the previews played
. did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie
' s quality
( or lack thereof
) while watching the trailers that cmo before it
? well
, the cheesy films bieng advertised before tracks ofthe a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring peopel no one knows
,
and htey all looked bad
( definately nto a good sign
)
. tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout
. about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact thta it sports some nice scenery
. to be fair
, the first half
- hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller
. wolf larson
, who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant
, adequately plays tghe underling obviously set up as the killer of the film
' s title
. james brolin
and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten
. brolin
' s charcter
, for some inexplicable reason
, thikns its a gerat idea to spend some time inspite a cabin
, practicly isolated
, with lebrock
and larson
, whom he
' s decided to test forthe the week before giving him full controll of his comapany
. by the time the cahracters arrive at teh cabin
, this film begins to become tedious
. apparently
, brolin
' s sucessor
' s test involves chopping wood for the fireplace
and skiing
, whihc don
' t seem like attri
butes necesary tothe run a business in the city
.
but
, hten again
, what do i know about business
? i dont htikn
,
though
, that they shoud ahev invested infact some better furniture for the cabin
; its beds
and closets have a habbits of jstu breaking at the slightest touch
. larson
' s character accidently kills his pwn wife rather than the couple he wants to kill
. this leaves the movie with an hour to go
and only three characters
, whihc really isn
' t anough to sustain it
. the film
' s writer must have taken a cue from stephen king
, as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery
and gerald
' s game
. larson annd lebrock fight
and torture each other
( the tables get turned a couple of times
) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for halp
. some old guy
' s arround too
, just so the killer can add to his body count wihtout killing the couple
, who everyone konws will be alive at the end ofthe the film
. the old guy
,
however
, miraculously survives his first death anbd appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it
' s worthy ofthe a chuckle or twpo
. outside ofthe that chuckle
, unfortunately
, tracks of a killer wiull just bore you as the obvious plot is drawed out ad infinitum
and the actors
, forthe some reason
, become increasing obnoxious
. if yuo
' re inaddition a video store
and thinking about renting htis turkey
, don
' t
. amke tracks to a far superior suspense film
, like misery
.
