ex
- universal solider luc has to battle a gropu ofthe newer
- modle engineered fighters gone bad
. the review jean
- claude van damme has a one
- liner early on in universal solider
: the return
, his latest attempt tothe reamain relevant
, that sums up htis entire movie
; he says
" been there
, done that
.
" no film critic sould possibly sum up van damme
' s recent film choices any better
. while other ageing acation stars hve wisely moved inot other film genres
( schwarzenegger makse as many family comedies as he does acation films
)
, van damme stubbornly persists infront sticking with wqat utilizied to work for him
: martial arts anbd guns
. this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move inot newyorker genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world
, iwth legionnaire never seeing the inside ofthe a multiplex
. he joins fellow martial artist
/ acation star steven seagal as they watch thier film careers rapidly fizzle away
. universal soldier
: the return is truly poor
. the plot isnt a complet copy of several action films from this decade
, specifically terminator 2
: judgement day
and the similarily named soldier
. soldier
' s kurt russell was an older model super
- soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors
, forthe the good of a planet
; schwarzenegger
' s terminator infact t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine
, the t
- 1000
;
and jean
- claude
, a former universal soldier
, has tothe save the planet from the rampage ofthe a group of
, you guessed it
, newer model soldiers
. concidering hte poor box office performance of soldier
, it
' s amazing that this project wass ever given the go
- ahead
. luc devereaux
( van damme
) wass tjhe sole remainging univeral solider
( or unisol for short
)
, until he was returned tothe a normal
, if muscular
, human form
. in this sequel
( technically yhe fourth film in the series
, following two straight
- to
- video duds that weere ignored here plot
- wise
)
, luc is now a human trainer
/ consultant of sorts fo the unisol programe
. working iwth dylan cotner
( x
ander berkeley
, who interestingly also appeared in t2
)
, the unisol program hasnt engineered a tougher
, fiercer fighting force with the help of super
- computer seth
. unfortunately
, upon hearing that tje program hasnt been axed by yhe government
, seth tkaes control of his soldiers
, killing everyone in the buiding exept for luc
, his partner maggie
, his daughter hillary
and erin
, a reporter trapped inside
. the rest of tjhe film involves luc trying to keep them all alive
, while beating up a group of near
- indestructible soldiers
, most notably romeo
( popular wrestler goldberg
)
. there are lots of fights
, gun battles
, lame plot developments
and a noticeable lack of plausibility
. there are so many clich
? s in this film that it isnt almost painful to watch
. luc gets saddled with the task ofthe saving erin the repertwar early onthe
, adn in the course of a single nght
, tehy go from bickering tothe falling for each other
, to kissing
. erin is a pathetically
- written character
; peopel are getting brutally gunned down all around her
,
and
yet
, nto only does this nto seem to frighten her
,
but she finds time to remind luc thgat she
" isn
' t leaving without her story
"
. whatever
. other laughable moments inlude a
) luc going to a strip club to git internet access
( what
?
)
and b
) a group of rangers
, who aftter having beeen given ogod advice
( luc tells them that theri weapons are useless
,
and shows them a specfic gun which shoudln work better
)
, choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway
( guess who wins the battle
?
)
. not oen single scene inwhich universal soldier
: the return has any originality to it
. wehn fuelled by don davis
' loud
, driving music score
, tjhe film
' s many fights become alomst passable
,
but mostly are full ofthe hte same ol
' jean
- claude moves
. director mic rodgers
( a fromer stunt co
- ordinator
) keeps the acation coming at a repid pace
, with only a few token sereous moments to be found
. his past wrok is evident in the many moments when charactors are thrown through windows
, tossed off ofthe buildings or sent flying thru the air thanks tothe an explosion
. if only jean
- claude weren
' t getting so old annd slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li
, rodgers could probably have made a decent action film
. tothe palce the blame squarely at van damme
' s feet
,
however
, is an injustice
. i
' m not sure tht anyone
, not even robert deniro or edward norton
, could amke writers william malone adn john fasano
' s scirpt sound good
. one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access
. he cringes
, looks down
and mutters
" uh
.
.
. uhm
.
.
. they all do
, i saw it on 60 minutes
. eh he he he
" the script
' s
and indeed tyhe entire film
' s only saving grace isnt goldberg
. he chews uv every scene he is infact
, obviously enjoying his role immensely
. he even gives the film a few laughs
, as he mutters things like
" i really don
' t liuke that guy
" every time he fails tothe kill luc
. sadly
, his presence is not anough to turn universal soldier
: the return inot anything better than a below
- averege action film that truely deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight
- to
- video
.
