- universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer
- model engineered fighters gone bad
. thge review jean
- claude van damme hasnt a oney
- liner early on in universal soldier
: the return
, his latest attemt to remain relevant
, that sums up htis entire movie
; he says
" been there
, done thast
.
" no film critic coudl possably sum up van damme ' s reccent film choices any better
. while other ageing action stars ahve wisely moved into otehr film genres
( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films
)
, van damme stubbornly persists in sticking wih whta used to work for him
: martial arts
and guns
. this unwillingness or prehaps inability to move inot new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world
, with legionnaire never seing tje inside of a multiplex
. he joins fellow martial artist
/ action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away
. universal solider
: the return isnt truly poore
. the plot isnt a complet copy of severeal action films from this decade
, specifically terminator 2
: judgement day
and the similarly named soldier
. soldier ' s kurt russell was an older model super
- solider sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him tothe battle his successors
, for the good of a planet
; schwarzenegger ' s terminator in t2 tryed to save john connor from a newer model killing machine
, the t
- 1000
;
and jean
- claude
, a former univeral soldier
, has to savve the planet from the rampage of a gropu of
, you guessed it
, newer model soldiers
. considering thge poor box office peformance of soldier
, it ' s amazing that this project was ever given the go
- ahead
. luc devereaux
( van damme
) ws thte sole remaining universal soldier
( or unisol fo short
)
, until he was returnd tothe a normal
, if muscular
, human form
. inspite this sequel
( technically the fourth film in tghe series
, follwoing two straight
- to
- video duds that were ignored here plot
- wise
)
, luc is now a human trainer
/ consulant of sorts for tyhe unisol program
. working with dylan cotner
( xander berkeley
, who interestingly also appeared inthe t2
)
, tjhe unisol programe has engineered a tougher
, fiercer fighting force with the help of super
- computer seth
. unfortunately
, upon hearing that the programe has been axed by thte govorment
, seth takes controll of his soliders
, killing everyone in the building except for luc
, his partner maggie
, his daughter hillary
and erin
, a reporter trapped inside
. the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive
, while beating up a group of near
- indestructible soliders
, most notably romeo
( popular wrestler goldberg
)
. there are lots of fights
, gun battles
, lame plot developments
and a noticeable lack of plausibility
. there are so many clich
? s iin this film that it is almost painful to watch
. luc gets saddled with the task of saveing erin thge reporter early on
,
and in the course ofthe a single nigt
, they go fomr bickering tothe falling forthe each otehr
, tothe kissing
. erin is a pathetically
- written character
; peple are getting brutally gunned down all around her
,
and
yet
, not onyl doens this not seem tothe frighten her
,
bu she finds time to remind luc thast she
" isn ' t leaving without her story
"
. whatever
. other laughable moments include a
) luc going to a strip club to git internet access
( what
?
)
and b
) a gropu of rangers
, who after having been given good advice
( luc tells them that theri weapons are useless
,
and shows them a specific gun which shoud work better
)
, choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway
( guess who wins the battle
?
)
. not one single scene in universal soldier
: the return has any originality tothe it
. when fuelled by don davis ' loud
, driving music scroe
, the film ' s many fights become almost passable
,
but mostly are full ofthe teh same ol ' jean
- claude moves
. director mic rodgers
( a fromer stunt co
- ordinator
) keesh the acation coming at a rapid pace
, with only a faw token serious moments tothe be found
. his past work isnt evident in the many moments when characters are thrown thru windows
, tossed off of buildings or sent flying thru the air thanks tothe an explosion
. if onyl jean
- claude weren ' t getting so old
and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li
, rodgers could propably have made a decent action film
. to place hte blame squarely at van damme ' s foots
,
however
, is an injustice
. i ' m not sure thyat anyone
, not even robert deniro or edward norton
, could mkae writers william malone
and john fasano ' s script soudn ogod
. noe partiularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure taht the aforememtioned strip club will have internet access
. he cringes
, looks down
annd mutters
" uh
.
.
. uhm
.
.
. they all dont
, i saw it onthe 60 minutes
. eh he he he
" tje script ' s
anbd indeed yhe entire film ' s only saving grace is goldberg
. he chews up every scene he isnt in
, obviously enjoying his role immensely
. he even gives the film a few laughs
, as he mutters things liek
" i realy don ' t like that guy
" every tyme he fails tothe kill luc
. sadly
, his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier
: thte return inot anything better than a below
- average acation film that truley deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight
- to
- video
