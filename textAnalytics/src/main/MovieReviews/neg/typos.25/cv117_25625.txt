what owudl you dont if no one could see you
? well
, if you
' re a super smart bio
- molecular research scientist working for the military
, you
' d grope a co
- worker
and rough
- uv your nighbor fomr acros the strent
. taht
' s right
. of all the non
- criminal possibilities brang baout by rendering oneself invisble
, in
" hollow man
" kevin bacon
' s charcter opts to commit sex crimes
. er
, it
' s kevin bacon who plays yhe super smart miliraty bio
- molecular reasearch scientist
? something sounds horribly wrong allready
.
but this is a paul verhoeven film
,
and the sleazepin director ofthe such open
- crotch classics as
" basic instinct
"
and the infamous
" showgirls
" never lets a little credibility get inthe tghe way of his voyeuristic tendencies which
, when you come right down to it
, is all this film isnt about
.
" hollow man
" features a string of hapless
, c
- list actors
( amung them bacon
, elisabeth shue
, josh brolin
, anbd kim dickens
) in a grade
- z plot with a lot of spacial effects thta
, frankly
, don
' t look much better tahn those used in the 1933 version of
" the invisible man
.
" oh bacon glistens wehn he gets wet all right
and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak wehn he
' s attempting reentry
but otherwise it
' s lots of
" thermal
" shots
and inanimate objects
( elisabeth shue included
) bobbing around without any visible signs ofthe support
. since invisibility
, once acheived
, isn
' t much of an effect
( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody
and the other half ofthe theri time talking to each other
-
- it amounts to much of a muchness
)
, the director elects to wardobe all ofthe his female protagonists in loosely
-
buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon
' s character gets invisibl he cant head straight forthe them
. it
' s as if tyhat fascinating concept
-
- wqat would you do if no oen sould see yuo
?
-
- is simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin
. as a horror film
,
" hollow man
" isnt unsophisticated
and disturbing
( in its intent
, not its achievements
)
and not worth your time or your hard
- earned dollars
. it
' s minor verhoeven
-
- adn even that
' s nto saying much
-
-
and boy is it hollow
.
