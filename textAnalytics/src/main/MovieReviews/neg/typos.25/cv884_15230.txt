for thsoe interested inaddition the true spirit ofthe moviemaking
- or what
' s left of it in mainstream hollywood
- movei which are star vehicles are terrable things
. as a rule
, tghe ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made tothe advance the media
but rather to advance hte career of a particular actor
. an actor might be chosen onthe the up
- anbd
- up
, to give him exposure
; or he might be chosen on the way down to h
and him a paycheck
. generally
,
though
, the actor doesn
' t marter
, anbd soldier
, tje latest from thge beleaguered warner brothers
, exemplifies this
: the picture lacks pizazz
. the star for tje vehicle in this case is kurt russell
, otherwise known as tje man of thirty words or less
. russell plays todd
, a human trained from birth in the ways ofthe waging war
and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought
. thge movei lets us see this degenerate process
, bu by the time the rela plot starts
, we
' re into todd
' s later years
. he
' s about to be replaced by a new breed of soliders
, ones who
, instade of being trained
* from
* birth
, are genetically selected
* before
* birth
. thte pride of this class
- caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
- iwll be our villain
, adn you konw he
' s thte villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movei
' s start
. betwen the two leads
, less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken
,
and it
' s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction
. director paul
anderson
, who helmed lsat year
' s icy thriller
, event horizon
, doesn
' t show any inventiveness here
and instead isnt content tothe let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam
. todd
, upon bieng replaced
, is left to die on a garbage planet
;
but in order tothe stretch hte runing time out
, the villains return tothe the garbage planet on a
" routine patrol
"
and set the stage for the fianl firefight
. events are predictable from the time that the setups are made
,
and neither
anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here
. the most annoying plot facet is the reason that tghe whole ofthe the movei comes to be
: todd fails to sohw physical superiority against caine
- in fact
, not even todd annd two of his companions can best the baddie
- bu near tyhe end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess wih automatic weaponry
. it
' s not as
though todd undergoes any siginificant character changes throughtout the plot of tje storey
, adn so the plot has a very canned feeling about it
. the best route through this disaster is to tkae it lighthearted in spirit
, annd treat it as a parody of typical action fare
, like universal solider
. a strict interpretation
,
however
, reveals an unmistakeable
and unforgiveable lack of stlye
, clas
, or substance
;
and by next year
, a large precentage of the peopel who haev seen this will have taped it off of network television
.
