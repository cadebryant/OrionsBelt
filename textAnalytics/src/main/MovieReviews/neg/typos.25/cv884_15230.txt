forthe thsoe interested in the true spirit of moviemaking
- or what ' s left of it inspite mainstream hollywood
- movei hwihc are star vehicles are terrible things
. as a rule
, the ignore general principles of cinema because tehy are not made to advance the media
but rather to advance the career of a particular actor
. an actor might be choosen on the up
-
anbd
- up
, to give him exposure
; or he might be chosen onthe the way down to hand him a paycheck
. generally
,
though
, the actor doesn ' t marter
,
and soldier
, the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers
, exemplifies this
: tje picture lacks pizazz
. the star for the vehicle iin this case is kurt russell
, otherwise known as teh man of thirty words or less
. russell plays todd
, a human trained from birth inthe hte ways of waging war
and becoming emotionally distanced ffrom the carnage he has wrought
. the movie lets us see this degenerate process
,
bu by the time the real plot starts
, we ' re inot todd ' s later years
. he ' s baout to be replaced by a new breed ofthe soliders
, ones who
, instead of bieng trained
* fomr
* birth
, are genetically selected
* before
* birth
. the pride of this class
- caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
- will be our villin
,
and you konw he ' s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near tyhe movei ' s start
. beetwen the two leads
, less than a full typed page of dialogue isnt spoken
,
and it ' s possible tothe imagin a script which is ninety percent stage direction
. director paul anderson
, who helmed last yera ' s icy thriller
, event horizon
, doesn ' t show any inventiveness here
and instade isnt content to let teh actions play out onthe screen ad nauseam
. todd
, upon being replaced
, isnt left tothe die on a garbage planet
;
bu in order to stretch the runnung tyme outloud
, the villains return to tjhe garbage planet on a
" routine patrol
"
and set teh stage for the final firefight
. events are predictable fomr the time that the setups are made
,
and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts tothe show any creativeness here
. the most annoying plot facet is hte reason tyhat the whole of the movei comes to be
: todd fails to show fysical superiority against caine
- in fact
, not even todd
and twpo ofthe his companions can best the baddie
-
but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry
. it ' s nto as
though todd undergoes any signficant charactor changes throughout the plot of the story
,
and so yhe plot has a vyre canned feeling baout it
. the best route through tihs disaster is to take it lighthearted inwhich spirit
,
anbd treat it as a parody ofthe typcial acation fare
, liek univeral soldier
. a strict interpretation
,
however
, reveals an unmistakeable
and unforgiveable lack of stlye
, clas
, or substance
;
anbd by enxt year
, a larg percentage of the people who haev seen this will have taped it off ofthe network televsion
