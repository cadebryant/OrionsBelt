thge eyar is barely a week old
,
and htere isnt already a c
andidate fo thte worst of 1997
-
- the relic
, a would
- be chiller that
' s more successful at making the audience laugh thna scream
. inwhich this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams
( whose last two picturesk weere dreadful jean
- claude van damme vehicles
)
, a creature that feeds onthe the hypothalamuses
( hypothalamii
?
) of humans
and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum
. how did this creature come inot existence
,
and why does it feed on hormones
? thge
" scientifc
" explination cooked up by the four
-
- yes
, four
-
- credited screenwriters
( amy holden jones
, john raffo
, rick jaffa
, adn am
anda silver
) takes
" suspention of disbelief
" to new heights
, even by monster movei st
andars
.
but as cockamamie as the csience is inspite the film
, it isn
' t qutie as hard to swallow as the casting ofthe the clueless penelope ann miller as a brillant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics
. miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination
, turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion inot an overblown oscar clip
, complete with piercing wails
and glycerine tears
. give it up
, penelope
-
- it
' s a
_ monster
_ movei
_
. on tyhe flip side
, toom sizemore just phones in his performance as a polical lieutenant
,
but his role isnt so thankless thta it
' s hard to imagin it being plyed any omre effectively
. it
' s qtuie funny to see a film indulge
, with the straightest of faces
, iin all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well
(
and so recently
) iin scream
. fo example
, in one early scene
, a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night
. ok
, we all know what
' s coming
,
but as if we didn
' t need any mroe confirmation
, he puls out a joint
and starts puffing away
. everyone knows what happens tothe people who do drugs in a scary movie
.
and later
, miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears soem suspicious hevy breathing
. does she make a beeline for the front door
? of course nto
-
- she runs inot tje ladies room anbd cowers iin a stall
. with all yhe cliches
, it is only fitting the film
' s climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in reccent film
: that of somene outrunning a fireball
. if the relic isnt truly
" the next evolution in terror
" as the poster states
, thn the horror film
-
-
and humanity
-
- is in even worse shape than we
thought
.
