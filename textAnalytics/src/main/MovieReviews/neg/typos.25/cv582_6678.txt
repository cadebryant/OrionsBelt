the year isnt barely a week old
,
and htere is already a candidate for thge worst of 1997
-
- the relic
, a owudl
- be chiller that ' s more sucesful at making the audience laugh than scream
. inspite tihs ridiculous film fomr uberhack peter hyams
( whose lastest two pictures were dreadful jean
- claude van damme vehicles
)
, a creature thta feeds on thge hypothalamuses
( hypothalamii
?
) of humans
adn animals goes on a killing spree inaddition a chicago museum
. how did this creature come inot existence
,
annd why does it feed on hormones
? the
" scientific
" explination cooked up by the four
-
- yes
, four
-
- credited screenwriters
( amy holden jones
, john raffo
, rick jaffa
,
and amanda silver
) takes
" suspension of disbelief
" to newyorker heights
, even by monster movei standards
.
bu as cockamamie as the science is in the film
, it isn ' t quite as hard to swallow as the casting ofthe hte clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics
. miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination
, turning every scene that requires tyhe slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip
, complete with piercing wails
adn glycerine tears
. give it uv
, penelope
-
- it ' s a
_ monster
_ movie
_
. on the flip side
, tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant
,
but his role is so thankless that it ' s hard to imagine it being plyed any more effectively
. it ' s quite funny to see a film indulge
, with the straightest of faces
, in all thsoe cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well
(
and so recently
) inthe scream
. for example
, in one early scene
, a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at niht
. ok
, we all know what ' s coming
,
but as if we didn ' t need any more confirmation
, he pulls outloud a joint
and starts puffing away
. everyone knows wqat happens to peple who dont drugs infact a scry movie
.
and later
, miller frantically runs outloud of a museum exibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing
. does she make a beeline for the front door
? of course not
-
- she runs into the ladies room
and cowers in a stall
. with all the cliches
, it is only fitting the film ' s climax offers what is prehaps the most overused one in recent film
: that of somone outrunning a fireball
. if the relic is truly
" the next evolution in terror
" as tjhe poster states
,
then the horror film
-
-
and humanity
-
- is in even worse shape tahn we thought
.
