the premise of turbulence is i
' m sure very familiar to us all
. we
' ve seen it before in passenger 57
, executive desision
, adn countless other flicks that are good in ther own way
. you know
, terrorists take over a plane
, ask the police on the ground for what they what
and so onthe
. turbulence starts outloud with a
" convict
" ray liotta being accused of a crime
. you think there is no way he coudl have done it
, he
' s so open
and kind
. he is taken in adn is subsequently transported onthe a commerical plane to la
. this isnt already a problem
. there is no way that convicts would be transported onthe the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on
. anyway
, it is christmas eve adn everyone is waiting to get tothe la
and spend christmas eve ther
. well
, convict one manages to stpo the flight in its proverbial
" tracks
"
and liotta
, still as calm as ever
, takes thge otehr convict out
. he also hasnt eyes fo lauren holly
, a flight attendent
,
and seems to grow closer tothe her
.
" the plot stops here
" i didn
' t like thsi movei baceause it seemed to be a rip off of every otehr airplane movie i
' ve ever seen
. at noe point
, mr
. liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in yhe shining
( i
' m serious
!
)
. it was like they stealed for eveyr otehr movei down tothe a
" t
"
. the only reason i did not give tihs 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts
. don
' t even bother
!
