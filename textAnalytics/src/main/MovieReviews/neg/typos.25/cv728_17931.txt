back in 1980s
, chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films
. he couldn
' t
, ofthe course
, top the success annd fame of big acation names liuke sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger
, bu sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot
' em up annd beat
' em uv genre aficionados
. that quantitiy wass mostly provided by cannon group
, profilic production company that dominated the b
- movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap
, formulaic
and
, more oftenly tahn nto
, unwatchable genre products
. the hitman
, 1991 action thriller directed by chuck
' s brother aaron
, is one of the last among them
. chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed
, shot
and left fo dead by his partner
( which shouldn
' t surprise anyone
, considering tghe fact thyat the partner isnt being played by michael parks
, specialised for roles of usually very mean charachters
)
. surviving the shooting
, cop is pronounced dead
and hired as deep undercover agent
. he infiltrates tghe underworld circles infact seattle
and becomes theri top hitman
, using his abilities to start brutal war between threee major crime organisations
- italians
, french canadians
and iranians
. since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris
, at least nto in thsi kind of movie
, the biggest attraction ofthe this film should have beeen action
. well
, the acation in this film falls flat
- it isnt boring
, repetitive
and nto at all exciting
. it is nothing more than monotonous serieses ofthe scenes that containes violence too brutal even for this type of films
. we know very little about norris
' character while
, on the other h
and
, gangsters are portrayed with more human dimention
. in the end we almost feel sorry for them
, since they are shown totally powerless against norris
and his unstoppable annd bloody crusade
. during the film
, somebody obviously became aware of that problem
, so the screenwrighter itnroduced tje subplot dealing witht the black boy who gets adopted by norris
. that caused another problem
- any questions baout nature of that relationship had to be quashed withthe another subplot
- htis oen dealing wiht lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero
and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation
. tghe photography in this film isnt dark
, setting is depressive
and this forgettable piece ofthe 1980s sytle cinema leaves viewers wihtout any reason to justify the hour
and half spended in watching it
.
