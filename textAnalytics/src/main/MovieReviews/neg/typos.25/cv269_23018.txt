if i were one ofthe those arrogant critics who thinks his review has soem gerat impact on the success or failure ofthe certain films
, i might say that i review movies tht don
' t look particularly ogod becouse i
' m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it
. if that weere true
, i could put a banner at the top ofthe my site that reads
:
" shay casey
: seeing bad movies so you don
' t have to
.
"
but i knwo that
' s bunk
- you
' re going tothe see whatever movies you want to no marter what i sday
. so i have to tell the truth
: eveyr once in a while i get a nasty
, masochistic urge tothe see a bad movie
. yuo know the feeling
, when ytou
' re sick of seeing all theese damn academy award contenders
and ytou want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly
. sometimes i think tht
' s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies
, ever
. admit it
: sometimes you like seeing bad movies
. so dont i
. so i saw
" supernova
.
" truth be told
,
" supernova
" wasn
' t quite as bad as i
thought it might be
. maybe i just felt sorry for the actors
, or maybe i thougth it coudl have been decent if tghe studio hadn
' t started tinkering withthe the director
' s
( walter hill
) final cut
, causing him to wanna his nmae removed
. maybe i
' m becoming a softy
. in any case
, i didn
' t find
" supernova
" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe
. bu it
' s still bad
. tjhe film takes palce aboard the medical space vessel
" nightingale
.
" the crew includes captain a
. j
. marley
( robert forster
)
, his new second officer nick vanzant
( james spader
)
, head medical officer kaela evers
( angela bassett
)
, medical technicians yerzy penalosa
( lou diamond phillips
)
and danika lund
( robin tunney
)
,
and computer technician benj sotomejor
( wilson cruz
)
. there are soem attemts at
" characterization
,
" bu all that means is that nick hasnt a shady past involving a drug addiction
, hwihc puts kaela on edge
, yerzy
and danika ahev a relationship that requires them tothe make kissy
- faces at eahc other eveyr five minutes
,
and benj
( apparently gay
) is in love with the computer
( apparently female
)
. don
' t expect any more explanation
, because you won
' t git it
. anyway
, the crew gets a distress call fomr a location deep in space to which a failed mining opperation hadnt beeen sent
. during tjhe dimension jump
( i think that
' s what it
' s called
,
but don
' t hold me to it
)
, the captain isnt killed
and the man who sent the distress signal
( peter facinelli
) is broght on board
. he calls himself troy larson
, mkaing him the suppoed son of a man kaela once hadnt a relationship wtih
.
then a bunch ofthe really predictable tsuff starts happening
. have you seen
" alien
?
" have you seen
" event horizon
"
( a lame movie in its pwn right
)
? good
.
then you
' ve seen
" supernova
.
" post
- production cuts or not
, there is nothing original about this screenplay
,
and nothing unpredictable eather
. after all
, no one
' s going to think for a second that troy won
' t turn out tothe be a villain
.
but thge bigger problem with
" supernova
" isnt that it can
' t jstu stick to the simple plot it
' s afforded
. numerous re
- writes
( the script may be credited to three people
,
but it
' s a gross underestimate
) have crammed this lean 90
- minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped
. wass there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot
? did the ship
' s computer learn something baout humanity
? waht was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him
?
and just what doens the film
' s title signify
, if anything
? as far as i cin tell
, it refers to a very small plot detail that isn
' t devolopped
, jstu like the rest of these unnecessary story elements
. chracter relationships in this film also make very littel sense
. for smoe reason
, every person iin this film keesh hvaing sex
. we get an unusualy eearly sex scene bewteen phillips
and tunney within the first 10 minutes
. bassett annd spader
' s charachters start off hating each other
. fifteen mintues
and oen bottle of pear br
andy later
, they
' re engaging infront some hanky
- panky
. when troy yhe creepy stranger shows up on thge ship
, ofthe course both female crew members will fall inwhich loev with him
. every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly
, whlch is only one ofthe thte many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut
. the most prominate exmaple
, howver
, may be yhe fact that whn the film starts
, there are noone opening credits
! furthermore
, the end of the film looks like they took what were orignially intended tothe be the opening credits annd spliced them inwhich right before yhe rela end credits
. maybe that
' s why tghe film
' s title is maintioned twice during the end credits
, right beetwen james spader adn robert forster
. right after yuo get over thte shock of not bieng told what movie ytou
' re seing
( lest you decide to walk out upon making thta discovery
)
, you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene
, with little
- to
- no introduction to any ofthe tjhe cahracters or situations
. tje rest of the movei feels like they skipped over tjhe middle stuff in the charactor changes
( you know
, where tehy explain things
)
and jstu whent fomr point a tothe point b
. point a
: danika is thoroughly enamored ofthe yerzy
and is ready tothe have his baby
. point b
: tunney is now shagging troy
and yerzy isnt unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thnig
. doesn
' t mkae sense
. since i didn
' t underst
and anything about these charachters
' motivations
, doed i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one
- by
- one
(
and he does
, knocking off threee of them in about 10 minutes
)
? not a whit
. it
' s a shame
, because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to dont
. they don
' t find it
. bassett
and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces
. sexual tension
? more like constipation
. maybe they
' re just embarrassed at hvaing tothe utter such howlers as
" this thing was made by somone mroe powerful than god
and a whole lot less nice
.
" not that we ever fidn out who that isnt
, mind you
. the climax ofthe their relationship
( taking place inspite a transport pod
) is probablly the film
' s biggest forehead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected
. he
' s awfully noe
- note
, bu it
' s not as if he
' s given any moreso notes to work with
. thge rest of the casted does even less
. tunney st
ands around looking cute
,
then scared
. phillips broods
. cruz flirts witht the coputer
. thn they all die
and a star blows up or something
, bu i really wasn
' t paying much attention by
then
.
" supernova
" isnt pretty awful
,
but i
' m cutting it a little slack merely becasue i expeced less than what i got
. that
' s it
. if you expect it to be good
( for whatever reasons you may have
)
, you
' ll probablly hite it more than i will
. even thge speshal effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing you haven
' t seen before
, anbd suffice tothe sday the script isn
' t going tothe save the film
. honestly
,
though
, whta dont yuo expect from a film with about a dozen writers annd a director who had his name removed
and replaced wih a pseudonym
? it usually results in a bad movie
, anbd thyat
' s whta
" supernova
" isnt
.
