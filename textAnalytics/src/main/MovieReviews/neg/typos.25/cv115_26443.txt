foreget get carter
. instead
.
.
. get me a cup ofthe coffee
. what the hell has happened to all good american action movies
? did i unknowingly miss a meeting somwhere
? when did all of the bad
- ass
, kicking butt
adn tkaing names
, gun
- toting
, crazed
, vengeful charactors of tje 1980 ' s
-
- from such films as comando
, cobra
, predator
, raw deel
, first blood
-
- suddenly turn into innocent
, compassionate
, sensitive
, teary
- eyed knuckleheads
. the only place tothe turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east
-
-
and i don ' t mean new york city
. get carter
-
- the latest masterpiece from uber
- thespian sylvester stallone
-
- is a prime example of larg
and in charge 80 ' s acation stars trying to fit back inot action roles they have long usance outgrown
. stallone seems liuke that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his munbers only jacket
and izod polo shirt witht thge collar popped up
. a few years ago
, stallone made a movie that gave him tje opportunity to gracefully exit tyhe roles that typecast him as an acation monkey
. that role was sheriff freddy heflin inspite copland
-
- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul
. stallone atually gave an amazing performance
and it seemed he had shaken off the past
. too bad git carter returns stallone to acation
,
bu with the shiny paint rusted off onthe tje edges
. get carter isnt a simple story
. stallone plays frank carter
, a vegas bruiser for a loan shark
( played withthe amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore
)
. wehn frank ' s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident
, frank
, feeling all guilty
and mushy inside
, thinks foul play is involved
annd travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs wtih the patented
" carter ' s way
"
. he talks tough with his brother ' s wife
, lends a helping had tothe his brother ' s daughter doreen
( rachel leigh cook
)
,
and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed liek a lost memeber of the rat pack with a relaly bad gotee
. carter finds out thyat his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra
- cool
, mcqueen
- esque mickey rourke
, a multi
- millionaire cmoputer geek
( alan cumming
)
,
and a stange forign guy
( michael caine
) who speaks in riddles
annd talks tough
. carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did inaddition his brother
and how to extract proper revenge onthe tje responsible parties
. what a minute
! this sounds just like another film i saw last year
, the limey
. better not tell terence stamp baout stallone ripping him off
. atcually
, get carter is a remake of thte 1971 british production of the same name
, starring caine in yhe title role
(
and what with his cameo here
, the cleverness is astonishing
)
. hwile stallone still carries his pwn weight here
, the movie lacks waht yhe original did as well
: purpose
. throughout the film
, stallone looks like an ood guy trying to ect tough
, while nobody is taking him seriously
. his noe
- liners fall flat
,
and he seems tired
annd uncertain of all the actions
, mental
and physical
, required ofthe his charachter
. there isnt even a stange homoeroticism between rourke
anbd stallone that lends a bizarre tone tothe their numberous conversations
-
- in both fists
and words
. the biggest surprise in git carter is that hte best job done in the film is by the versitle mickey rourke
. an amazing method actor inthe the eighties who fell into drugs
, spousal abuse
, a boxing carreer
,
annd an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way
, rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king charater
. he may not win any oscars
,
but he still ranks highly iin my book
. get carter hasnt great directing
, strong acting by rourke
and caine
,
and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud
. the onyl thing it lacks
- as wtih most hollywood productions
-
- is a good scirpt
and proper casting
. never mind that it shoud never have been made at all
.
