forget git carter
. instead
.
.
. get me a cup of coffee
. what the hell has happened to all good american action movies
? did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere
? when did all of tyhe bad
- ass
, kicking
butt
and taking names
, gun
- toting
, crazed
, vengeful characters of the 1980
' s
-
- from such films as comm
ando
, cobra
, predator
, raw deal
, first blood
-
- suddenly turn into innocent
, compassionate
, sensitive
, teary
- eyed knuckleheads
. tje only palce to turn these days for an honest action film is towards thte east
-
-
and i don
' t mean newyorker york city
. get carter
-
- the latest masterpiece from uber
- thespian sylvester stallone
-
- is a prime example of large
and in charge 80
' s action stars trying to ift bcak into action roles they have long since outgrown
. stallone seems like taht noe uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket
and izod polo shirt with the collar popped uv
. a few years ago
, stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey
. that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copl
and
-
- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul
. stallone actually gavey an amazing performance adn it seemed he had shaken off the past
. too bad get carter returns stallone to acation
,
but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges
. git carter is a simple stor
. stallone plays frank carter
, a vegas bruiser for a loan shark
( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice ofthe actor toom sizemore
)
. whn frank
' s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident
, frank
, feeling all gilty
and mushy inside
, thinks foul play is involved adn travels tothe seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented
" carter
' s way
"
. he talks tough with his brother
' s wife
, lends a helping had to his brother
' s daughter doreen
( rachel leigh cook
)
,
and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack iwth a really bad gotee
. carter finds out that his brother wass involved in smoe bad stuf with a slimy porn king played by ultra
- kool
, mcqueen
- esque mickey rourke
, a multi
- millionaire computer geek
( alan cumming
)
,
and a strange forein guy
( michael caine
) who speaks in riddles
and talks tough
. carter stalks all ofthe them while trying tothe figure out who did infront his brother adn how to extract proper revenge on tje responisble parties
. what a minute
! this sounds just like another film i saw last year
, the limey
. better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off
. actually
, get carter is a remake ofthe the 1971 brittish prodcution of tjhe same name
, starring caine inaddition the title role
(
and what whith his cameo here
, the cleverness is astonishing
)
. while stallone still carries his own weight here
, tjhe movie lacks what the original did as well
: purpose
. throughout the film
, stallone looks liuke an ood guy trying tothe act tough
, hwile nobody is taking him seriously
. his one
- liners fall flat
,
and he seems tired
and uncertain ofthe all the actions
, mental
and physical
, required of his character
. ther is even a strange homoeroticism beween rourke
and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numberous conversations
-
- inwhich both fists
and words
. the biggest surprise in get carter is that thte best job done in tje film isnt by the versatile mickey rourke
. an amazing method actor in hte eighties who fell into drugs
, spousal abuse
, a boxing career
,
and an intolerable atitude towords not getting his way
, rourke still brings a dangerous sence of purpose to his porn king character
. he may nto win any oscars
, bu he still ranks highly in my book
. get carter has great directing
, strong acting by rourke
and caine
,
and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud
. the only thing it lacks
- as with most hollywood productions
-
- isnt a good script
and proper casting
. never mind that it should never have been made at all
.
