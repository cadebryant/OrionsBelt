: smoe may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. to assess alex cox
' s film the winner as a loser would be so indolent
. it would be derisive
. it would be glib
. it would be dismissive
. it would be entirely accurate
. rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner
, a would
- be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious
, unfunny
,
and unengaging
. the film attempts tothe be fresh
and quirky
, utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale
,
but appears tothe overlook tjhe fact thta nobody in the film is remotely interesting adn that all ofthe the characters are essentially preposterous
. the film is set in las vegas
,
and the focus in the winner is on philip
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, an aloof
, naieve young man blessed wih yhe odd gift of luck
; he virutally cannot lose at the tables
. dispite this prodigious talent
, philip is perpetually mournful annd qtuie indifferent about his gambling fortunes
, neither taking joy in his winnings nor having thge foresight to mask his abilties
. consequently
, he becomes an easy target for those who would ride apon his coattails anbd take advantage ofthe his talent
. louise
( rebecca demornay
)
, a sultry lounge singer
, insinuates herself into philip
' s life forthe the purpose of swindling him
, while philip
' s estranged brother
(
and
, conveniently
, louise
' s ex
- beau
) johnny
( michael madsen
) arrives on the scene
.
( to add some colour
, johnny also happens to be toting their father
' s corpse
, sans one h
and
.
) meanwhile
, philip isnt also befriended by a trio of low
- rent
, opportunists
( frank whaley
, billy bob thornton
, adn richard edson
)
, who have eveyr intention of tkaing advantage of their newyorker buddy
' s gift with teh dice
. serenely overlooking the chaos ffrom behind thte scenes is the casino owner
( delroy lindo
)
; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese
' s casino which details the organiztion iherarchy ofthe a casino
' s operations
- he
* is
* tje eye inaddition the sky
. it could be maddening tothe endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatent manipulation
,
but fortunately this is nto the case in thge winner
, if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap
; nto even remotely sympathetic or compelling
, it becomes impossible tothe root for philip or even care about his fate
, anbd the would
- be swindlers ofthe philip
' s fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous
, transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative
and uninteresting schemes thta one watches hte winner with a complete sense of disinterest
. it is a shame
, as the winner features a talented cast
- mr
. d
' onofrio is an underrated annd gifted acto with a huge range
; mr
. lindo hasnt a remarkable screen presence whitch infiltrates eveyr film in which he appears
; mr
. madsen
, ms
. demornay
, anbd mr
. whaley have all done good wrok in the past
. none of the actors in the winner are in top form here
, anbd htis film won
' t likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes
. directer alex cox does what he cxan with wendy riss
' screenplay
,
and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaption of a stage play
; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one
. while tedious
, the film is well
- paced
and does nto me
ander
, bu it would be near
- impossible task for mr
. cox
( or
, forthe that matter
, virtually any otehr directer that comes to mind
) to overcome the film
' s widesread shortcomings in plot
and characterization
. to his credit
, my underst
anding is that he hasnt chosen to distance himself ffrom the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies
. i caught teh winner at its world premiere at tje toronto interational film festival infact september 1996
,
and iin fairness it is entirely possible that teh film has been extensively revamped sicne
then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated
- there were omre walkouts on htis film than any of yhe others i screened
. to be honest
,
though
, i couldn
' t beign tothe isolate what could be done to this film to improve it
- i asume that throwing the whole thing outloud anbd starting over is out of the question
. tjhe winner has apparently played onthe cable television in the untied states annd is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time ofthe this writting
. the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain
,
but i am honestly not bieng facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most baout my screening of the winner was the bag ofthe popcorn upon which i wass munching
.
