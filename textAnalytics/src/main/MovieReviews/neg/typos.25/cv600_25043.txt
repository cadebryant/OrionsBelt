silly performances
and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group ofthe people str
anded at
" hte last stop cafe
and motel
" due tothe heavy snowfall
. one ofthe the str
anded is a colorado state highway patrolman
( adam beach
) who discovers a murder scene
and a bag full of cash from a receet bank robbery
. someone amoungst the group of strangers isnt a bank robber
and a murderer
,
but is it the same person or are htere multiple criminals
? adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for hte lead in this film
. he doesn
' t play the role with enough seriousness to be believeable or enough goofiness fo it to be funny
. his performance is sticked somwhere in the middle
,
and this film really needed it tothe be on one side or the other
. rose mcgowan isnt cold
and unpleasant tothe the eye as always
,
and jurgen prochnow
.
.
. what on earth is he doing in this
? best performance comes from william s
. taylor as a cheesy
(
yet still somehow cool
and confident
) wayne newton drifter type
. tghe last stop is available onthe dvd from sterling hmeo entertainment
. as usual with sterling
, they
' ve filled out this dvd with extra features
. the disc contains teh film in its orginial aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, a choise ofthe 2
. 0 dolby suround sound or 5
. 1 dolby digital suround sound
, a full lenght audio commentary trakc with director mark malone
, interviews wih the cast
and crew
, the original trailer
, adn the usual cast
and crew biographies
. tjhe film itself might not be tjhe greatest
,
but sterling
' s effort ofthe adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable
( suggested retail of
$ 19
. 95
) makes this dvd worth the moey
.
