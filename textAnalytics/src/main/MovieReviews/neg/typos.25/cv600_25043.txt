silly performances
adn soem huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic gropu of peopel stranded at
" the last stpo cafe
and motel
" due tothe heavy snowfall
. noe of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman
( adam beach
) who discovers a murder scene
anbd a bag full ofthe cash fomr a recent bank robbery
. someone amongst the group of strangers isnt a bank robber
anbd a muderer
,
but is it hte smae person or are there mutiple criminals
? adam beach unfortunately wass the wrong choice for teh lead in this film
. he doesn ' t play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or anough goofiness for it to be funny
. his performance is sticked somewhere in the middle
,
and thsi film realyl needed it tothe be onthe one side or the other
. rose mcgowan is cold
anbd unpleasant to the eye as always
,
and jurgen prochnow
.
.
. what on earth is he donig in this
? best performence comes from william s
. taylor as a cheesy
(
yet still somehow cool
annd confident
) wayne newton drifter type
. thte lastest stop isnt availaible on dvd from sterling home entertainment
. as usual with sterling
, they ' ve filled outloud this dvd with extra features
. the disc contains tghe film in its original aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, a choice of 2
. 0 dolby suround sound or 5
. 1 dolby digital suround soudn
, a full lenght audio commentary track with director mark malone
, interviews with the cast
and crew
, hte original trailer
,
and the usual cast
and crew biographies
. the film itself might not be the greatest
,
but sterling ' s effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable
( suggested retail ofthe
$ 19
. 95
) makes this dvd worth the money
