woof
! too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin
and debra winger
, because that
' s whta
' s recquired to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as
-
- ofthe all thigsn
-
- a psychologist
. nto usance hte reagan administration has ther beeen an acting stretch ofthe such magnitude
! alas
, mickey rourke
, we hardly knew ye
. story opens with a campy kick
-
- willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out ofthe thte window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy
. she goes splat
, he goes ugh
,
and his character spends the rest ofthe the film colorblind
. really
. the ogod doctor thn moves to sunny l
. a
.
, where he rooms iwth an ood college chum
( scott bakula
)
, a therapist who
' s getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group
. buddy bites it inaddition the second reel
( no surprise htere
)
and willis agrees to tkae over both the group
and the death threats
. for his troubles as therapy man
, willis gets tothe share some cut
- from
- nc17 love scenes with the lover
' s jane march while dodging nails
, cars
,
and rattlesnakes
. why
' d it hve to be snakes
? color ofthe night is the worst movie of the year
. period
. foreget north
, clifford
, or
, heaven halp us
, even on deadly ground
. here is a movei misfire so audaciously awful that you can
' t help bu wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming
. for starters
, yhe
" group
" is a collection ofthe mixted nuts better suited tothe bob newhart than bruce willis
. theese are realistic portrayals of thge mentally unhealthy
? palying a prissy obsessive
/ compulsive
, cuckoos nest alumnis brad dourif
, alone
, may set the psychology profession bcak ten years
. the plot
' s a wreck with laughable dialogue
, pointless pov shifts
,
and tje one big secet solvable in the first fifteen minutes
. directer richard rush
, who once helmed freebie
and tghe bean
, doesn
' t seem to mind
. unfazed by the nincompoop plot annd cuckoo characterizations
, he overfills the film whith enough canny camera shots
and zany set
- pieces tothe make the efford almost worth watching
. his tolkein freeway chase is ok
, bu the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala
( most recently
) fatal analysis
. acting credits are across
- the
- board awful
. willis can be forgiven beccause he
' s filming die hard 3 as we speak
.
but what baout ruben blades insulting presence as the cop
? or lesley ann warren
' s stereotypical sex addict
? or worst offender jane march as a mystery
- girl
- who
' s
- noone
- real
- mistery
? shudder
. bottom line
: how they all kept straight faces
, i
' ll never know
.
