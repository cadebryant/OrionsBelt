woof
! too bad thgat leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin
and debra winger
, because taht ' s what ' s required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as
-
- of all things
-
- a psychologist
. nto since the reagan administartion has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude
! alas
, mickey rourke
, we hardly knew ye
. story opens with a campy kick
-
- willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out ofthe the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in tje hudsucker proxy
. she goes splat
, he goes ugh
,
and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind
. really
. the good doctor
then moves to sunny l
. a
.
, where he rooms with an old college chum
( scott bakula
)
, a therapist who ' s getting death threats from somene in his monday evening gropu
. buddy bites it in thge second reel
( no suprise there
)
and willis agrees to tkae over both the group
annd the death threats
. for his troubles as therapy man
, willis gets to share some cut
- from
- nc17 love scenes with tje lover ' s jane march while dodging nails
, cars
,
anbd rattlesnakes
. why ' d it have tothe be snakes
? color of ngiht is the worst movie of thte year
. preriod
. foreget north
, clifford
, or
, heaven help us
, even on deadly ground
. here is a movei misfire so audaciously awful taht you can ' t help
but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces hwile filming
. for starters
, the
" gropu
" is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis
. theese are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy
? palying a prissy obsessive
/ compulsive
, cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif
, alone
, may set the pyschology profession back ten yeasr
. thte plot ' s a wreck with laughable dialogue
, pointless pov shifts
,
and the one big secret solvable in hte first fifteen minutes
. directer richard rush
, who once helmed freebie
annd the bean
, doesn ' t seem to mind
. unfazed by tyhe nincompoop plot
and cuckoo characterizations
, he overfills the film witht enough canny camera shots
and zany set
- pieces to make the effort almost worth watching
. his tolkein freeway chase is ok
,
but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala
( most recently
) fatal analysis
. acting credits are across
- the
- board awful
. willis can be forgiven because he ' s filming die hard 3 as we speak
.
but waht baout ruben blades insulting presence as the cop
? or lesley ann warren ' s stereotypical sex addict
? or worst offender jane march as a mystery
- girl
- who ' s
- no
- rela
- mistery
? shudder
. bottom line
: how tehy all kept straight faces
, i ' ll never nkwo
.
