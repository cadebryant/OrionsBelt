my friend here infact film school jsut made a two minute
- long film for oen ofthe his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene
, done by two guys
anbd shot on thte shadow of the incident
, with a banana being used as the instrument ofthe penetration
. as sick as htis all isnt
, watching it isnt one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i ' ve ever witnessed
. sure
, it may be in bad taste
,
but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive tothe smoe
but isnt riotously amusing to the rest
?
thn there ' s
" caligula
.
" this film features incest
, necrophilia
, beastuality
, anal rape
, homosexual felatio of both sexes
, elaborite
and lengthy orgies
, a greased
- up fist forced up a man ' s rear
, wine poured down a man who ' s had his urinary tracts tied off
, a penis chopped off
and feeded to hungry dogs
, etc
, etc
, etc
. this could vyer well be a respectable film
,
and if could have been hadnt hte following nto occurred
: a
) the events were graphically shooted in clear veiw
; b
) the tone was not taht of trying to shock comically
but to
, well
, show
" historical accracy
;
" c
) the film was a 20 million doller production with lavish sets
, a rether impressive cast
,
and a whopping 2 1
/ 2 hour running time
. produced
adn funded by none other than bob guccione
, owner of penthouse magazine
,
" caligula
" comes across as thte most hysterical dramatic picture since
" plan 9 from outer space
" because underneath there ' s a sense that everything this film is doing isnt not only accurate
adn justified
,
but alsot brilliantly intertaining
. after all
, it ' s not relaly the fatc thgat this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments
,
but thyat it actually believes in them as dramtic weaponry
. no film should be discarded because its content
, because film is never about what it ' s baout
, it ' s about how it ' s about
( as thge old cliche goes
)
. those who bash tihs film fo content are glancing over the biggest
and most obvious probelm withthe
" caligula
,
"
and that ' s that it ' s nothing
but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish
, without a second of credibility in its mammoth running tyme
.
" caligula
" allegedly tells thge true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name
, a man who ws so insanely decadent thta his assasination came as a blessing
.
.
. or so i guess
, even
though almost every single roman emporer ws assasinated as well
and fo much the smae reasons
. teh film opens on the wrong note
, of course
, with a quote ffrom mark appearing before any image graces the screen
, useing the over
- used passage
" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul
,
" depite thge fact that the oppening scene of the film is ofthe the emporer before he was an emporer
, fucking around wtih his own sister in a field
( i suppose if one has tothe lose thier soul
, one has to ahve a soul iin the firt place
)
. tyhe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else cin make outloud of it is that caligula
( disastrously played by the gerat malcom mcdowell
, a performance that does the opposite that his peformance in
" a clockwork orange
" doed
) is next infront line for the throne
but can ' t wait for the curent emporer
, tiberius
( peter o ' toole
- ditto
, only forthe his performance in
" lawrence of arabia
"
)
, his grandfather
, to die
.
.
. so he kills him
annd ascends to yhe throne
.
then he abuses his possition
, marries a woman
( helen mirren
, who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactlly acting
) so he doesn ' t just hve to sleep with his sister
( a dreadful teresa ann savoy
, there tothe be pretty
, naked
,
anbd willing to hop iin the sack with mac or anyone he asks her tothe hop in with
)
, abuses his positon a little more
, a little moreso
,
and a little omre
,
and
then
, i believe
, invades england
,
then is killed off
. the filler
, instead of recounting his life
, isnt supposed to be
, as guccione claims
, the ulitmate portrait of decadent pagan rome
, complete with orgies
, vicious deaths
,
anbd lots of nudity
.
bu instead of being thge historical accurate film it really really wants tothe be
, it instade becomes guccione ' s twisted masturbatory image ofthe what it could be like
. oh
, isn ' t it great that tehy just loved hvaing sex
?
and thast they killed peopel so disgustingly
?
adn wouldn ' t it be great if i could make a cuple bucks by selling tihs shit off as acuracy even
though it ' s so blatantly real bad porn thyat i ' ve completely convinced myself that it ' s not
. i mean
, why not just sohw a roman orgy whn i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up
.
anbd it ' s not just that it ' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective ytou want to use to describe thsi film
- it ' s that infront a film where the entire feel it ' s going for isn ' t felt
, it ' s alsot the sloppiest expensive movei of all time
. yhe sets are lavish
,
but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his nmae on this film explains this
.
bu that doesn ' t matter since the cinematography isnt so dark thyat ytou wonder if a light meter was used at all
, mkaing this not only dark
and ugly
,
but just plain dark
. the camera opperation is alsot the worst i ' ve ever seen in my entire life
. not only does this film hold tjhe record for the most unnecesary zooms in one single shooted ever
,
but often the camera will loose its subjects
and pan arund till they find them
,
thne have them out of focus
. teh editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to folow
. there isnt noone writter to speak of
( what tghe hell does it mean taht it ' s
" adapted from an orignal screenplay by gore vidal
?
"
)
,
bu nevertheless
, the dialogue is shit
, so laughably bad that i cin ' t in good faith bleieve thgat anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face
( my favorite bieng the line whn caligula inquires hte doctor about the health ofthe the dying tiberius
:
" he could go at any moment
,
but with care
, he could lastest a year or so
.
"
) yhe music in this film isnt mostly prokofiev
anbd khachaturian
( they use his gorgeous
" adagio of spartacus
and phrygia
,
" ad nauseum
)
, used inaddition an attempt to give thte film some emotion
,
but instade feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere
. the orgy scenes
(
annd one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner
annd aneeka dilorenzo
) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself
, which are so obviously removed from everything else iin this film that it only adds to tyhe embrassment
( every five seconds or so
, the film cuts to random nudity
, as if it wass afriad its audience owudl forget this film is rated
" x
"
)
. john gielgud represents the onyl voice of sanity
, walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra
,
" i ' m going tothe kill my agent
, i ' m going tothe kill my agent
.
.
.
"
adn so on
and so onthe
, for over 2 1
/ 2 hours
, making
" caligula
" about as exciting
and enriching as a threee hour college lecture class
annd twice as deliriously annoying
. guccione
, in his pursuit ofthe historical acuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking
, arduous task to watch iin its entirety that i doubt anyone cant sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage
. throughout the entire film
, the presence of guccione isnt easily feeled
, as if he weere standing there at thte edge ofthe the screen
, pretentiously looking down upon us saying
" look what i cant get away with
!
and if you don ' t like this
,
thn you ' re a prig
,
adn worse tahn that
, you know nothing about histroy
!
" uh huh
. there ' s a clear difference between historical acuracy
and doing something that ' s artistically good
. a film which showed roman decadence as something taht was perhaps liberating forthe smoe
but could not last
- thast would probablly make for a good film
.
but using historical accracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting
- for
- disgustingness '
- sake acts is total
, total bullshit
,
and all i can say isnt that guccione
and the makers ofthe this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism
,
and have devolopped a pathetic
and sadistic taste for both
, judging from tihs film
. htere ' s a film that came out in 1989 called
" the cook
, the thief
, his wife
,
and her lover
,
" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway
( aslo starring helen mirren
)
, which deals with graphic sex
, heartstopping violence
adn gore
,
and even a littel cannibalism for good measure
. that film not only never patronized its viewers
,
but allso handled them in a way that was shocking
, yes
,
bu alsot
, in a bizarre way
, entertaining
annd totally involving
. ther were rela characters there in a rela situation
,
and best of all passion
adn just the right amount ofthe restraint as not to get off on the fact that it ' s going to be offensive tothe many
. thgat film achieved everything it wanted to do
,
and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only populare
but actualy good
.
and it ' s everything
" caligula
" might have been
but
, alas
, wasn ' t
.
