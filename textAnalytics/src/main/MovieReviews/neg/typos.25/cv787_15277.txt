my firend here in film school just made a two minute
- long film for one of his classes thyat includes a staged anal rape scene
, done by two guys
and shot on the shadow of the incident
, iwth a banana being used as the instrument of penetration
. as sick as this all isnt
, watching it isnt one of tje most admittingly hysterical moments i
' ve ever witnessed
. sure
, it may be in bad tast
,
but what yhe hell is bad tast other than something tyhat may be offensive tothe smoe
but is riotously amusing tothe tyhe rest
?
then ther
' s
" caligula
.
" this film features incest
, necrophilia
, beastuality
, anal rape
, homosexual felatio ofthe both sexes
, elaborate annd lengthy orgies
, a greased
- up fist forced up a man
' s rear
, wine poured down a man who
' s had his urinary tracts tied off
, a penis chopped off
and fed to hungry dogs
, etc
, etc
, etc
. this could very well be a respectable film
,
and if could ahve been hadnt the follwoing not occurred
: a
) the events were graphically shot in clear view
; b
) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically bu to
, well
, show
" historical accracy
;
" c
) the film was a 20 million dollar production whith lavish sets
, a rather impressive cast
, adn a whopping 2 1
/ 2 hour runing time
. produced
and funded by none other than bob guccione
, owner of penthouse magazine
,
" caligula
" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since
" plan 9 from outer spoace
" because underneath there
' s a sense that everything this film is doing is not onyl accurate
and justified
,
but also brilliantly entertaining
. aftter all
, it
' s nto really tjhe fact that this film features the aforememtioned disgusting moments
,
but tyhat it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry
. no film shoudl be discarded because its content
, because film is never baout what it
' s baout
, it
' s about how it
' s about
( as the old cliche goes
)
. those who bash this film forthe content are glancing over the biggest
and most obvious probelm with
" caligula
,
"
and that
' s that it
' s nothing bu overdramaticized bullshit fomr start tothe finish
, without a second of credibility in its mammoth running tyme
.
" caligula
" allegedly tells hte true storey of the evil roman emporer of tje same nmae
, a man who was so insanely decadent thyat his assasination came as a blessing
.
.
. or so i guess
, even
though alomst every single roman emporer ws assasinated as well
and for much the smae reasons
. yhe film opens on the wrong onot
, of course
, with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces tyhe screen
, using tghe over
- unsed passage
" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul
,
" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer
, fucking aroud with his pwn sister in a field
( i suppose if one hasnt to loose their soul
, oen has tothe have a soul iin the first place
)
. the plot is so incomprehensibly done tyhat all i or anyone else can make out ofthe it is that caligula
( disastrously played by the grat malcom mcdowell
, a performance that does the oposite that his performance in
" a clockwork orange
" did
) is next in line forthe the throne bu can
' t wait for the current emporer
, tiberius
( peter o
' toole
- ditto
, only for his performance inwhich
" lawrence of arabia
"
)
, his granfather
, to die
.
.
. so he kills him adn ascends tothe the throne
.
then he abuses his position
, marries a woman
( helen mirren
, who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactlly acting
) so he doesn
' t just hvea to sleep with his sister
( a dreadful teresa ann savoy
, ther tothe be pretty
, naked
,
and willing to hop in the sack wiht mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with
)
, abuses his postion a little more
, a littel more
,
and a littel omre
,
and
then
, i beleve
, invades engl
and
, hten isnt killed off
. the filler
, instade of recounting his life
, isnt supposted to be
, as guccione claims
, the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome
, complete with orgies
, vicious deaths
, adn lots ofthe nudity
.
but instead ofthe being tjhe historical accurate film it really really whants to be
, it instead becomes guccione
' s twisted masturbatory image ofthe what it could be liuke
. oh
, isn
' t it great that they just loved having sex
?
and that they killed people so disgustingly
?
and wouldn
' t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even
though it
' s so blatantly real bad porn that i
' ve completely convinced myself that it
' s not
. i mean
, why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a ogod ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it uv
.
and it
' s nto just taht it
' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want tothe ule to describe this film
- it
' s that in a film where thte entire fiel it
' s going for isn
' t felt
, it
' s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all tyme
. the sets are lavish
,
but so blatantly innacurate tht i wonder if no historian wanting to hvea his name on this film explains thsi
.
but that doesn
' t matter since hte cinematography is so dark tyhat you wonder if a light meter was used at all
, making this nto onyl dark anbd ugly
, bu just plain dark
. the camera opperation is also the worst i
' ve ever seen in my entire life
. nto only does this film hold the record forthe tyhe most unnecessary zooms in one single shooted ever
, bu oftenly tje camera will lose its subjects adn pan around till htey find them
,
then have them out ofthe foucs
. the editing is so sloppy that soem scenes are absolutely impossible to followup
. there is no writer to speak ofthe
( wqat teh hell does it mean thgat it
' s
" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal
?
"
)
, bu nevertheless
, teh dialogue is shit
, so laughably bad that i cxan
' t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them wiht a straight face
( my favorite being the line whn caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius
:
" he could go at any moment
,
but with care
, he could last a yearm or so
.
"
) the music infront thsi film isnt mostly prokofiev adn khachaturian
( they ule his gorgeous
" adagio of spartacus
and phrygia
,
" ad nauseum
)
, utilisied infront an attempt to give thge film smoe emotion
,
but instead feels as if it wass shipped in from elsewhere
. thte orgy scenes
(
and oen infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner
and aneeka dilorenzo
) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself
, whcih are so obviously removed ffrom everthing else in tihs film that it only adds to the embrassment
( eveyr five seconds or so
, the film cuts tothe r
andom nudity
, as if it was afraid its audience woudl forget this film is rated
" x
"
)
. john gielgud represents the onyl voice of sanity
, walking around inspite his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra
,
" i
' m goign to kill my agent
, i
' m gogin tothe kill my agent
.
.
.
"
and so on
and so onthe
, for over 2 1
/ 2 hours
, making
" caligula
" about as exciting adn enriching as a three hour coleeg lecture class
and twice as deliriously annoying
. guccione
, in his persuit of historical accracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking
, arduous task to watch in its entirety tht i dout anyone cant sit thru an hour of it wihtout irreversible psychological damage
.
thoughout the entire film
, the presence of guccione is easily feeled
, as if he were st
anding there at thge edge of the screen
, pretentiously looking down upon us saying
" look waht i can get awya with
! adn if you don
' t like this
,
then you
' re a prig
,
and worse tahn that
, you know nothing about history
!
" uh huh
. there
' s a clear difference between historical accuracy anbd doing something tath
' s artistically good
. a film whihc showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some
but coudl not lastest
- that would probably amke fo a good film
.
but using historical accuracy as a licence to git awya with any kind of disgusting
- for
- disgustingness
'
- sake acts is total
, total bullshit
, anbd all i can sday isnt that guccione
and thte makers of htis film ahev lost any kind of touch wtih either entertainment or eroticism
, anbd have developped a pathetic
and sadistic taste for both
, judging from this film
. there
' s a film that came out in 1989 called
" the cook
, the thief
, his wief
,
and her lover
,
" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway
( also starring helen mirren
)
, whitch deals with graphic sex
, heartstopping violence
and gore
, anbd even a little cannibalism for good measure
. that film not only never patronized its viewers
,
but also h
andled them in a way that was shocking
, yes
,
but also
, in a bizarre way
, entertaining
and totally involving
. there were real characters there in a rela situation
,
and best of all passion
and just the right ammount of restraint as not to get off on the fatc that it
' s going to be offensive tothe many
. that film acheived everything it wnated to do
, anbd has since retained a status as noe of those cult films that is nto onyl popular
but actualy ogod
.
and it
' s everthing
" caligula
" might have been
but
, alas
, wasn
' t
.
