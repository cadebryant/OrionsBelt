according to the publicity material
, wiht this movei the directors
" hope tothe restore good old
- fashioned bowling to its rightful place in tje mainstream of american consicousness
.
" hmm
. you never knwo
, tehy just might be on to something
. whta witht the rise of geek chic
, lounge music
and seventies fashion
, the ever
- contrary kids ofthe the nineties might just latch on tothe bowling as another terminally unhip bastion ofthe tackyana to claim as thier own
.
but
then
, i doubt if kingpin will have anytying to do with it
. it
' s cheesy all right
,
but connoisseurs of bad taste iwll find this film exudes that bl
and smell of stale jokes rather tahn tghe invigorating stink ofthe true kitsch
. tyhat
' s a shame
, because
, in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more
. woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler onthe the rise
, roy munson
. the movie opens iin the fifties with roy
' s dad dishing out teh reader
' s digest
/ gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls
, shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever
. the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by tghe presense ofthe bill murray
, as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken
. it
' s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good
- he gives the wry
, derisive edge tothe this otherwise rather unfocused comedy
. mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job
,
then abondons him to an angry mob who mangle roy
' s h
and
.
then it
' s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat
, balding loser with a prosthetic rubber h
and
. he
' s hopeless until he meets ishmael
( r
andy quaid
)
, an amish amteur bowler that munson takes onthe as protege
. so toghether htey set out fo the million dollar bowling tournament in reno
, picking up pretty hustler claudia
( vanessa angel
) on the way
. withthe hte exit ofthe bill murray
, the filmmakers seem to haev only one direction to go
,
and tyhat
' s
.
.
. dumb annd dumber
. yes
, indeed
, kingpin is brought to yuo by those modern proponents of laxative humour
, peter
and bobby farrelly
, the directors ofthe the aforememtioned jim carrey vehicle
. so
, perpare for much slaparound comedy witht flying rubber h
ands
, distended nipples
, ridiculous hair annd bull semen
. git set for stock fish
- out
- of
- water situations when city
- boy roy puts onthe a beard
and trys to blend inspite witht hte amish community
, or wehn suaku straitlaced ishmael tkaes on smoking
, striptease anbd unchristian neighbour
- socking
. nowe
, don
' t get me wrong
, there
' s nothing wrong with cheap humour
,
and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody
and r
andy
. thge trouble isnt tyhat these jokes aren
' t bold or funny enough tothe drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction
. it lurches from sports movie tothe amish
- mocking to road
- trip to sentimental melodrama
,
( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal
, anbd many shameless plugs for tje accompanying pop soundtrack
)
, never qtuie getting it all toghether
. smoe gags fall flat from a lack of build
- uv
, while there are bits
and pieces in the movie that simply don
' t do anything
. why the long
, unfunny fight in the car park
? why two of these
? why doens that guy wear mascara
, or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it
? the film is full of these half
- thougth
- through idaes that give teh impression of any ood gaffer
, grap or makeup artist throwing in r
andom stuff
and saying
,
" wouldn
' t that be funny
?
"
. well
, no
, actually
. the actors don
' t do the movie much favours either
. woody harrelson comes off okay
, plausibly acting dumb
, smart
, cynical or innocent when tje implausible scirpt calls for it
, bu r
andy quaid isnt a ceaseless ham
,
and vanessa angel hasnt noone talent
( like schwarzenegger
, she seems more convincing playing a computer
- creation than a human
-
- tkae tje tv series ewird science
.
.
. please
)
. even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movei
' s climax
. all inwhich all
, a fairly useless attempt at comedy
,
and a certified noone
- hoper at kickstarting tjhe bowling renaissance
. we
' ll have to look tothe a reinspired john waters
, or perhaps somebody from down under
(
" strikely bowling
"
, anyone
?
) for thge definitive bowling comedy
. the flying inkpot
