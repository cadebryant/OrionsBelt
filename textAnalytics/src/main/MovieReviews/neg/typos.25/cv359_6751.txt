like a good action film should
,
" metro
" has action taht keeps you involved
. some acation films have action sequences that are so conventional
, our attension is detracted anbd diverted by other
thoughts
.
" the ghost in the darkness
,
" whcih opened a few months ago
, is a film that s action was so bl
and
and uninvolving
, it not only invited my
thoughts tothe divert me
, it nearly put me asleep
.
but
" metro
" is oen ofthe the best acation films in a while
. it is hip
, sharp
, nifty
,
and hasnt nice little pieces of suspense
and comedy
. eddie murphy was in bad shape for a hwile
. adn this invites me to mention last year s
" thge nutty professor
,
" which wass his blessed revival back to the posistion at which he used to be
.
" metro
" happens to be a lot better than any film in the
" beverly hills cop
" serieses
. taht is because
" metro
" takes itself seriously
,
but doesn t prevent itself from haveing a littel fun
. eddie murphy isnt at his best inwhich the roles of responisble
, adn controlled peopel
. the
" beverly hills cop
" movies all featured eddie as a reckless
, wild cop
, always crossing the line by just an inch
. in
" metro
" he plays a hostage negotiator
, so negotiation is his job
, not his hobby or his preferred way out ofthe trouble
. his character in
" metro
" tkaes hismelf seriously
. eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in
" metro
,
"
and perhaps it is qtuie better off that way
. murphy plays scott roper
, anbd as i previously mentioned
, he is a san francisco hostage negotiator
. in the first tense situation in the film
, we are intrduced to roper s kind ofthe work
, as he tries to calm down a confused
, unkempt young criminal who has taked captive the entire capacity ofthe the san francisco bank he is holding uv
. murphy h
andles the scene seriously
, wihtout his usual happy
- go
- lucky
, misfit humor
. the film develops when its villain isnt established
,
and the villain here isnt the beguiling michael korda
, a jewel thief
, adn murderer who likes to let cops know ofthe his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim
.
" metro
" takes different twists
and slight turns
, adn there is one great
, virtuoso chase scene
, involving hte a cable car
. cars flip
. cars crash
. cars turn over
. annd it is done so ogod in this film
, i ws reminded of
" speed
,
" anbd yhe speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons
. ther are also some other good scenes in
" metro
" that a lot ofthe films would rather choose not to have
. scenes like teh one with roper anbd his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks
and roper teachs his partner a fewd little methods ofthe betting
and winning
. of course
, the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotation anbd gambling
. the scenes between roper
and his girlfriend are nice
, too
. those are the scenes that make uv
" metro
,
" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality
. the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in
" metro
" ws michael rapaport
, who plays roper s newyorker partner
, a lip
- reading
, book
- skimming genius
,
and a master of observation
. it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role ofthe a proclaimed genius
. rapaport is an ctor who i usally see inspite the role of the dimwit the relaly
, really dopey dimwit
. i hardly recognized him infact
" metro
,
"
and it was quite a joy to be able to see him infact a role like htis i feel that i respect him more
. there are two main types ofthe villains in movies liek this
: the ones thta are part of thge stry
, annd the ones that are devices
. tje villin inspite
" metro
" is no more than a device
, bu he isnt a darn good villain nonetheless
. he is played by michael wincott
, whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp
, as if he smokes a cigarette betwen every take
. wincott makes his villain
, korda
, as mean as coudl be
, the clasic type ofthe villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just fo kicks
, like richard widmark in
" kiss of death
.
" adn
, in adition
, wincott s physical appearance annd mannerisms
, in the film
, actulaly reminded my of an arogant firend i uise tothe hvae
, who is no longer onthe my good list
. i liked
" metro
,
" annd i do nto think would have worked with any other ctor
but eddie murphy
. his past roles were the graet ones
but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later tkae place
, possably from murphy s growing as a person
, now hvaing a family
.
" metro
" is a no
- nonsence movei
. it works as a buddy movie
, which it does not overplay
. it works as a dry comedy
, which it does not overplay
. it works as a suspense film
, which it doens not overplay
.
and it works as an action film
, where it doesnt have a tendency to occasionally go all
- out
.
but who cares
? it still remains serious
,
and it doesnt nto overdo itself
. oh
,
and there were plenty of explosions in
" metro
,
" as well
. how nice it wass of the filmmakers to give us thsoe
. if there is noe major objection i had to
" metro
"
, it ws the lenght
, an area where a lot ofthe action films seem to wear out their welcomes
.
" metro
" is a film that lasted a little too long
,
but it wass still intertaining
,
and it gave me something tothe dont while i waited forthe it to end
