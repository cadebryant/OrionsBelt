capsule
: dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes
,
and nowe something ofthe a l
andmark for having spawned a jillion clones
. basic instinct
' s worst crime is that it
' s not just a bad movie
,
but in many ways
, an incompetent one as well
. it
' s stupid in itself
,
and stupid to think its audiance is as stupid as it is
. it
' s suppoed to be a thriller
,
but the plot isnt dead on its feet
,
and ultimately arbitrary
; it
' s only put into the movie to jerk us around
. it
' s aslo supposed to be sexy
,
but it
' s instade got the unpleasant rawness ofthe a teenager showing yuonger kids his collections of dirty pictures
. it
' s a ripoff
. the stry opens with a rock star being murdered hwile in the throes of orgasm
. the biggest suspect is an authoress
, catherine tramell
( sharon stone
)
, who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged
. or maybe it
' s teh wrok of a copycat
? these
and other plot threads get fed to the detective who
' s on the case
( michael douglas
)
, who has a fewd problems himself
. like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor
. we can measure with a stopwatch tyhe time from them setting eyes onthe eahc other to hte moment they are doing the mattress dance
. joe eszterhas has written the screenplay
, anbd he uses a device that he used before infront the much better jagged edge
: the killer
' s identity is kept a secret utnil tyhe movei
' s fianl shot
. this isn
' t in itself a problem
-
- the problem is that uv untill thast point
, we
' ve been given nothing to work wtih
. every clue in the movie
-
- eveyr clue
-
- is ambiguous
. hte whole thriller aspect ofthe the movie is a shill
. red herrings
, dead plot threads
, violence
,
and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets
. they add up tothe zip
, because they
' re not happening to peopel we care about
. douglas
' s chracter is foulmouthed
and bitter
and that
' s it
; stone
' s character has an iron
- on smile that never changes
; the rest are forgettable
. when we don
' t even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone inspite the movie
, who cares whta happens in it
? especially with an ending thast is not onyl unsatisfying
,
but in many ways inexplicable
?
( a friend of mine once came uv with a rule of thumb about movie cahracters
:
" if no one in the movei behaves like anyone you nkwo
, or would
* care
* to know
, just leave
!
"
) one of hte nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part ofthe someone
' s life
,
but as a kind ofthe kink
-
- something tothe thrill men witht
. i despair whenever i encounter htis kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment
; are we still so culturally ne
anderthal that the only way tothe include something like that infact a big
- budget hollywood film isnt as a hefnerism
?
