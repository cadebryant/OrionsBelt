" deuce bigalow
" isnt the frist project from adam s
andler
' s company hapyp madison
, the formation of which assures that we
' ll be seeing the s
andler sytle of comedy massmedia
- produced at an increasing rate inspite years to come
. be afraid
. be vyer affraid
. the good news is that s
andler doesn
' t actually appear in
" deuce
"
and that rob schneider
and eddie griffin are funnier than s
andler
. schneider hasnt a sweetness that makes the clueless
but ogod
- hearted deuce believable
. griffin
' s delivery is dead
- onthe
, especialy in the coining of
" technical terms
" for t
. j
.
' s profession
, as in
" don
' t make me he
- bitch man
- slap you
!
" there
' s the expected amount of toilet humor in
" deuce
.
"
( for one thing
, deuce
' s dad is a men
' s room attendant
)
. does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny
? for most of us
, i htink that childhood facination with bodily functions dissapears wehn we hit the far
- side of puberty annd disover how funny sex is
. i
, for one
, will be glad when the toilet trend is finaly flushed
. bottom line
:
" deuce
" doesn
' t offer anytying new
but it isnt intermittently funny
.
