the firt species was a moderately
- successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty spacial effects
, a few well
- pased action sequences
,
and frequent views of model
- turned
- actress natasha henstridge sans clothing
.
however
, it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequal
.
and
, considering hte quality of species 2
, it
' s obvious that mgm should hve stoped while they were ahead
. the onyl hting that distinguishes speices 2 is how awful it is
. if you throw away the plot
, which is charaterized by a blatant disregard forthe inteligance
, logic
, coherence
, annd consistency
, species 2 actulaly hasnt a few thnigs tothe recommend it tothe a select audience
. of course
, taht audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys
( who
, at least inspite theory
, shouldn
' t be able to get into an
" r
"
- rated film
) anbd connoisseurs ofthe bad movies
. there
' s anough blood
, gore
, simulated sex
,
and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring
. this is a grade z exploitation flick that
' s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment
. somewhere
, someplace
, i recall hearing species 2 described as
" erotic
.
" i owudl love tothe nkwo who used witht taht adjective forthe this movie
, because he
( or she
) hasnt a pecluiar notion of eroticism
. sure
, ther
' s a lot ofthe sex
and nudity
,
but it
' s almost always accompanied by yhe ripping opne of a woman
' s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free
, splattering blood
and gore infront all directions
. anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care tothe be sitting next to in a theater
. i supose yhe main attraction in speices 2 is natasha henstridge
( anbd
, tothe get thte obvious question out ofthe the way
-
- yes
, she does remove her top
,
but only once
,
and only breifly
)
.
al
though tjhe character she palyed inthe thge original speices is dead
, government scientists still ahve the dna
,
and
, out of what cxan only be described as a suicidal impulse
, they decide to create another clone
. this creature
, dubbed
" eve
" by its creator
, dr
. laura baker
( plyed by marg helgenberger
, reprising her role
)
, is genetically engineered tothe be kinder
and more docile
. meanwhile
, man has finally set foot on mars
. a team of three
, led by patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, has traveled to the red planet
,
but whn they return to earth
, they bring something with them
. ross has become a half
- human
/ half
- alien hybrid
,
and he
' s soon mating like crazy
, collecting the blood
- soaked childern that are the result of each sex session
. his intention is obviously world dominaton
. st
anding in his way isnt that indomitable soldier of fortune fomr the first film
, preston lennox
( michael madsen
)
,
and one ofthe patrick
' s fellow astronauts
, dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
)
. bu whn patrick learns about eve
, a female ofthe his kind
, htere
' s noone damping his ardor
. i
' m not sure waht the budget for speices 2 was
, bu a siginificant portion of it must have gone inot paying hansome salaries tothe several recognizable actors
( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects
)
. michael madsen
and marg helgenberger
, both back for a second round
, are clearly on h
and tothe do as little as they can
, grab the money
, anbd run
. ditto for james cromwell
, who plays patrick
' s father
-
-
" underused
" is too kind a word to describe his involvement
(
" invisible
" owudl be more like it
)
. george dzundza gets tothe do a little scenery
- chewing as an angry
- bu
- inept general
. meanwhile
, justin lazard
' s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge
' s limited abilities look ogod by comparison
. hte only one inthe the hwole production wtih any energy is mykelti williamson
, who is cast in the part of the wisecracking balck sidekick
. complete with cheesy special effects
, bare breasts around every narrative corner
,
and dialogue capable of producing howls ofthe laughter
, species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics
. director peter medak
, a journeyman film maker with a siginificant list of mediocre movies on his resume
, has added anohter forgettable title
,
but at least he appears to hvae had fun doing it
, which isnt more than can be said ofthe anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness
. do i reccommend yhe movei
? absolutely not
,
but i will admit tyhat species 2 isnt dopey enough that it didn
' t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo
- intellectual bad movies do
. here
' s hoping htere
' s no species 3
.
