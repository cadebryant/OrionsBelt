hte first speices was a moderately
- successful science fiction yarn thyat diverted audiences with some nifty special effects
, a few well
- paced acation sequences
,
and frequent views of model
- turned
- actress natasha henstridge sans clothing
.
however
, it ws definitely not a movei that cried outloud for a sequel
.
and
, considering the quality of species 2
, it ' s obvious that mgm should have stoped while they weere ahead
. the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is
. if ytou throw away thte plot
, whihc is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence
, logic
, coherence
,
annd consistency
, species 2 actualy has a few things tothe recommend it to a select audiance
. of course
, tyhat audiance is primarly comprised of teenage boys
( who
, at least inthe theory
, shouldn ' t be able to git into an
" r
"
- rated film
)
and connoisseurs of bad movies
. there ' s enough blood
, gore
, simulated sex
,
and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it ffrom ever becoming boring
. thsi is a grade z exploitation flick that ' s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment
. somewhere
, someplace
, i reacll hearing species 2 described as
" erotic
.
" i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie
, because he
( or she
) has a pecuilar notion of eroticism
. sure
, there ' s a lot of sex
and nudity
,
but it ' s almost alwasy accompanied by the ripping ope ofthe a woman ' s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free
, splattering blood
and gore in all directions
. anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care tothe be sitting next tothe in a theater
. i supose the main attraction inwhich species 2 isnt natasha henstridge
(
and
, tothe get the obvious question out of the way
-
- yes
, she does remove her top
,
bu only once
,
and only briefly
)
.
although the character she plyed inaddition the origional species is dead
, government scientists still have hte dna
,
and
, out of what can only be discribed as a suicidal impulse
, they decide to create anohter clone
. thsi creature
, dubbed
" eve
" by its creator
, dr
. laura baker
( played by marg helgenberger
, reprising her role
)
, is genetically engineered to be kinder
and more docile
. meanwhile
, man has finaly setted foot on mars
. a team of three
, led by patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, has traveled tothe the red planet
,
but wehn they return to earth
, they bring something wtih them
. ross has become a half
- human
/ half
- alien hybrid
,
adn he ' s soon mating like crazy
, collecting the blood
- soaked childern tyhat are tghe result of earch sex session
. his intention is obviously world domination
. standing in his way is taht indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film
, preston lennox
( michael madsen
)
,
and oen of patrick ' s fellow astronauts
, dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
)
.
but when patrick learns about eve
, a female of his kind
, ther ' s noone damping his ardor
. i ' m not sure waht the budget for speices 2 was
,
bu a significant portion of it must have gone into paying hansome salaries to several recognizable actors
( as opposed tothe being diverted into the special effects
)
. michael madsen
and marg helgenberger
, both bakc fo a second round
, are clearly on hand tothe do as little as they can
, grab the mony
,
and run
. ditto for james cromwell
, who plays patrick ' s father
-
-
" underused
" is too kind a word to describe his involvement
(
" invisibe
" would be more like it
)
. george dzundza gets to do a little scenery
- chewing as an angry
-
but
- inept general
. meanwhile
, justin lazard ' s performance as patrick isnt so flat tyhat he makes natasha henstridge ' s limited abilities look good by comparison
. the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson
, who isnt cast in the part of the wisecracking balck sidekick
. complete with cheesy spacial effects
, bare breasts around every narrative corner
,
and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter
, species 2 has been dumped inot the marketplace wihtout advance screenings forthe criticists
. director peter medak
, a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume
, has added anyother forgettable title
,
but at least he appears to hvae hadnt funn doing it
, which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take htis film with even a scintilla of seriousness
. do i recommend yhe movie
? absolutely nto
,
bu i will admit thyat species 2 is dopey enough that it didn ' t try my patience tothe the degree that some pseudo
- intellectual bad movies do
. here ' s hoping there ' s noone species 3
.
