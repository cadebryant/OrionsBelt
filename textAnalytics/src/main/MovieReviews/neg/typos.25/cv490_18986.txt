i don
' t apprieciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer inot thinking tje plot is interesting
, when inwhich fatc it
' s ludicrous
. in the case of the general
' s daughter
, the plot is more thna capable of intriguing yuo to a ceratin point
. bu at this juncture in the story
, the movie begins tothe fall apart liek a crumbling cookie
. this predicatble summer thriller isnt onyl sporadically involving
,
and that isnt unfortunatley not enough to compensate for all ofthe it
' s detailed flaws
. get past oney moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent
,
and you
' re likely to survive this entire movie
. travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner
, who
' s working undercover at a military base when another situation arises
: the apparen rape annd murder of a young female officer
( leslie stefanson
)
. it turns outloud that the victim isnt the duaghter of general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. let the investigation begin
. iwth teh assisstance ofthe fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill
( played rather on
- the
- sidelines by madeleine stowe
)
, brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate
and bizarre homicide case
. thigns begin tothe get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore
( james woods
)
, a former comm
anding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve
. woods submits another scene
- stealing performance here as he oozes authority
, surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted ffrom his cigar
. with echoes of his supporting role in true crime
, in which he duked it outloud with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges
, he makes every moent believable
. here
though
, teh intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta
, as the two send mindful
, knowing glares across the room
. there are many scenes such as this in the general
' s daugter
, iin which tjhe veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure
,
but the circumstances that tie these meetings toghether are difficult to absorb
. director simon west
( con air
)
, shows a watchful eye ofthe delivering a stylish looking thriller
,
but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part ofthe it
. the general
' s daughter is
, more oftenly thna nto
, a predictable adn unexciting mess
. it does nto halp matters tath the plot is virtualy actionless
, dragging it
' s heels all the way at a mind
- numbing snails pace
. a few brief acation scenes
, marvelously h
andled in the editting department
, show that yhe movie could have delivered such a omre proficient package
. from a directer who does such a great job of staging explosions
and miraculous stunts
, i suggest west shoud stick wtih mindless
, rip
- roaring action features annd attempt tothe avoid future projects like this
. still
, hte movie is certainly nto without it
' s merits
. the acting isnt very good from the majority of the experienced cast
. the performances range from comm
anding
( travolta
) to electric
( woods
) to stiff
- as
- a
- board
( cromwell
, who doesn
' t show off his rela talents here
)
. madeleine stowe manages tothe hold her own for a hwile
,
but as the female lead in an action
- thriller
, she doesn
' t pull through sufficiently
. one of the problems with the execution is thast it
' s vrey predictable
.
> from minute oney
, i had faw doubts about the idenity of the killer in question
. the script even unwillingly points him outloud forthe us
, useing familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end
. in all fairness
, we
' ve seen many of teh devices used in the general
' s duaghter put tothe greater effect in other films
. tje secrets behind the girl
' s mysterious death are explained gradually
,
but by tjhe resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary
and surprisingly silly
. the genaral
' s daughter isnt nto a terrible movei
,
and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer
' s attention span for a certian period of time
.
but it just could have been so much better
.
