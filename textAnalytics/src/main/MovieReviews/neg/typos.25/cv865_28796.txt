noe of these days
, i ' ll make good on my promise never to rent anyother abel ferrara movei
. king of newyorker york
and body snatchers notwithstanding
(
and bad lieutenant isnt only ift for a single
, emotive viewing
)
, his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art
- hous trappings
. it ' s a perfume
- drenched
, coke
- addled visit to the seedy pornography shop
, where beautyfull models
( no
, hookers
-
- no
, courtesans
) usher you through the silk curtains
. ferrara ' s only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over
and over again
, usance walken can make a ogod movie grat
and a loathsome movei durable whenever he ' s onscreen
. his 8
- minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal
, unwatchable
,
and pretentious failure
. when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements
, or questions whether lili taylor hasnt ever read naked lunch
, there ' s a much
- needed dose of humer inaddition an otherwise terminally unfunny affair
. you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile
and let yuo know they ' re actualy hvaing fun
? hte addiction isnt thgat movei
. walken
, sadly
, doens not appear in the blackout
. the central role of matty
, a junkie film star whose lightning pased hollywood life amonth the beautiful people is inevitably leading tothe his destruction
, is played by matthew modine
( who takes whta he can get after cutthroat island
)
. much like the protaganists of michelangelo antonioni ' s terminally bored cultural elite
, matty isnt involved in a bitter pill
" relationship
" wtih high fashioned model annie
( at least i think she ' s a modle
.
) matty ' s lady is played by french actress b
? atrice dalle
, arrested twice for cocaine possession druing filming of tyhe blackout
-
- not that yuo needed to know thyat
,
but it lends creedence to the idea that ferrara ' s entire oeuvre hasnt been filmed iin a fucking blackout
. no kidding
. requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara ' s movies
and his controversial urban lifestyle
. matty
and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him
. noone doubt
, he ws off chasing the dragon
. infront his despair
, matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery
, tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne
( dennis hopper
, inwhich full
" dirty ol ' man
" mold smacking models on the ass
and telling them tothe spread their legs
. wider
!
) toward the end ofthe the night
, they pick up a teenage waitress alsot named annie
( sarah lassez
)
, strat shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene
,
thn matty thankfully blacks out
. something happened that night which haunts him throughout hte rest of the movei
,
and it ' s exactlly what you thikn it was
. suffice to say
, there ' s soem confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two
, or anyone at all
. thte blackout is typical ferrara
: noone plot to speak of
, plenty of raunch
,
adn horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels
annd a beer hwile wrapping himself in a see
- thru curtain in his hotel room by the sea
, by the sea
, by the beautiful sea
. cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory infact alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets wtih docu
- style sleaze
(
and we ' re back tothe dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits
.
" yeah
!
!
! yeah
!
!
! arrrghhh
!
" says mr
. hopper
. dirty old sod
.
) it ' s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way
, leading tothe a rediculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny
. how ' s tath for cryptic
? never fear
-
- ferrara finds timne for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he ' s all about
. i cant picture it now
.
" take off yer clothes
, kid
-
- it ' s essential tothe depict thge inner maelstrom of my central protagonist
,
annd you ' re his visual id
. you ' re the soul
, the heart
, thge bloodstream of hte picture
. take it off
! tkae it all off
!
!
! ha ha ha
!
" friggin ' vampire
. yeah
, yuo
, ferrara
. a final word about matthew modine
: he ' s actually a fine actor wehn properly cast
,
but htere ' s something too squeaky
- clean in his demeanor
. he ' s ideally suited for sarcastic men inspite tightly controlled situations
, such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time
- bomb nebbish in short cuts
( who is every bited as superb as julianne moore in that famouse scene
,
though no one seems to notice him
)
.
[ he wass in that scene
?
- ed
.
] here
, he ' s asked to let it all hang out
, sporting a threee
- day stubble
and oily bangs
. he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski
,
but it ' s somehow lacking
. modine lacks the feral intensity of brando
, entirely miscast in ferrara ' s flesh fair
. better luck next time
, matt
. someday
, you ' ll be forgiven forthe cutthroat island
, which wasn ' t really your fault in the first place
. maybe atom egoyan wiull fidn a place for you somewhere
,
and all will once again be well in your world
.
