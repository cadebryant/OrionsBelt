one ofthe theese days
, i
' ll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie
. king of new york
and body snatchers notwithst
anding
(
and bad lieutenant isnt onyl fit for a single
, emotive viewing
)
, his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut ofthe hoary art
- house trappings
. it
' s a perfume
- drenched
, coke
- addled viit to the seedy pornography shop
, where beautiful models
( no
, hookers
-
- no
, courtesans
) usher yuo through the silk curtains
. ferrara
' s only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over
and over again
, usance walken cant amke a good movei great
and a loathsome movie durable whenever he
' s onscreen
. his 8
- minute scene in the addiction isnt the saveing grace of that otherwise abysmal
, unwatchable
, anbd pretentious failure
. when he starts tlaking about his vampiric bowel movements
, or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch
, htere
' s a much
- needed dose ofthe humer in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair
. you konw those gothic club kids who are too cool tothe smile
and let you know they
' re atually having fun
? the addiction is that movie
. walken
, sadly
, does nto apear infront thte blackout
. the central role of matty
, a junkie film star whose lightning pased hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his distruction
, is played by matthew modine
( who takes what he can get after cutthroat isl
and
)
. much like thte protagonists ofthe michelangelo antonioni
' s terminally bored cultural elite
, matty is involved in a bitter pill
" relationship
" with high fashioned model annie
( at least i thikn she
' s a model
.
) matty
' s lady is played by french actress b
? atrice dalle
, arrested twice for cocaine possession druing filming ofthe the blackout
-
- not that you needed tothe know tht
,
but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara
' s entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout
. no kidding
. requiem forthe a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara
' s movies annd his controvertial urban lifestyle
. matty
and annie struggle over her decission to have an abortion without consulting him
. noone doubt
, he ws off chasing tyhe dragon
. infront his despair
, matty indulges iin a chemical induced weekend of debauchery
, tooling aroud the streets ofthe miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne
( dennis hopper
, infront full
" dirty ol
' man
" mold smacking models on the ass adn telling them tothe spread their legs
. wider
!
) towrad thte end ofthe the night
, they pick up a teenage waitress alsot named annie
( sarah lassez
)
, start shooting a hastly improvised sexual scene
,
then matty thankfully blacks out
. something happened thgat ngiht which haunts him throughout thge rest of the movie
,
and it
' s exactly what yuo think it ws
. suffice tothe say
, there
' s some confusion over whther he killed annie oney or annie two
, or anyone at all
. the blackout is typcial ferrara
: no plot tothe speak of
, plenty ofthe raunch
,
and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels annd a beer while wrapping himself in a see
- thru curtain in his hotel room by yhe sae
, by thge sea
, by the beautiful sea
. cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu
- stlye sleaze
( adn we
' re bakc to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits
.
" yeah
!
!
! yeah
!
!
! arrrghhh
!
" syas mr
. hopper
. dirty old sod
.
) it
' s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way
, leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes controll of his destiny
. how
' s that for cryptic
? never fear
-
- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity tothe remind us what he
' s all about
. i cant picture it now
.
" tkae off yer clothes
, kid
-
- it
' s essential to despict the inner mailstrum of my central protagonist
,
and you
' re his visual id
. you
' re the soul
, thte heart
, the bloodstream ofthe the picture
. take it off
! take it all off
!
!
! ha ha ha
!
" friggin
' vampire
. yeah
, you
, ferrara
. a final word about matthew modine
: he
' s catually a fine actor whn properly cast
, bu htere
' s something too squeaky
- clean iin his damenor
. he
' s idealy suited for sarcastic men infact tightly controlled situations
, such as his private joker iin full metal jacket or the time
- bomb nebbish in short cuts
( who isnt every bit as superb as julianne moore inthe that famous scene
,
though no one seems to notice him
)
.
[ he was infact that scene
?
- ed
.
] here
, he
' s asked to let it all hang out
, sporting a threee
- day stubble
and oily bangs
. he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski
, bu it
' s somehow lacking
. modine lacks the feral intensity ofthe br
ando
, entirely miscast in ferrara
' s flesh fair
. better luck next tiome
, matt
. someday
, you
' ll be forgiven for cutthroat isl
and
, which wasn
' t really your fault in yhe frist palce
. maybe atom egoyan will find a palce forthe yuo somewhere
, annd all wiull once again be well inspite your world
.
