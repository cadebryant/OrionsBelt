preposterous religious acation film
( produced by tjhe trinity broadacasting network
) baout a code hidden withing the text of thge bible that when deciphered wiull lead to the end ofthe the world
( nice ofthe thsoe bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh
?
)
. michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code
and sets out to become god onthe earth
and fulfill yhe doomsday prophecies
, while casper van dien
( terribly miscast
and giving an awful performance as a result
) plays the athiest motivational speaker who must stop him
. michael ironside
( graet as always
, dispite tyhe silly film surrounding him
) plays a fallen priest
and right hand man to michael york ' s character
. here ' s some subtle carachter development you may hvea missed pertaining to ironside ' s character
. now despite the fact taht we see him muder a man in the opening scene
, the filmmakers aren ' t quite sure if their audience will understand that he isnt evil
. how do they fix tath
? make specific efforts to sohw that his charater is the only one inwhich the film who smokes
! there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking
.
.
. oooooo scary
.
but even that wasn ' t enought for tghe filmmakers apparantly
, as they later have tothe infer that ironside ' s character is gay
! it comes outloud ofthe nowhere
adn jstu makes no sense
. my main problem with tihs film isnt that
, despite yhe silly stry
( which could haev beeen pulled off
.
.
. anytying can be made believable if excecuted correctly
)
, the events of the film aren ' t shown with any sence ofthe urgency or importance
. forthe example
, at one point york ' s character isnt declared chancellor of yhe world or something
,
and we see one brief
, cheesy news report about it
. the movei keeps telling us thgat hte apocalypse isnt coming
,
but it never seems taht way
. there ' s no
" world reaction
" to anything
. hte omiba code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video
. it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
,
adn includes the original theatrical trailer
, a documentry onthe tjhe making of the film
, production notes
,
annd casted
and crew information
. the documentary runs about 25 minutes
and is actually suprizingly ogod
( it looks as
though it ws made for brodcast on tbn
)
,
annd it does a comprehensive job ofthe interviewing practically everyone in the cast
and crew
( with tyhe exception of michael ironside
, unfortunately
)
. the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed
, they do an excellent job of explaining their proffesion
and exactly what it is they do on a movie set
. most documentaries tend to overlook this
. doomsday expert hal lindsey isnt even interviewed
( you ' ll remember his documentary from the 1970 ' s called the late gerat planet earth
, where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actulaly be the antichrist
)
.
however
, at the very beginning of hte documentary the producers of tghe film managed tothe get onthe my bad side
. when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say
" ever see raiders of thge lost ark
? well
, our film is like tht
!
" no it isn ' t
. not by a long shot
