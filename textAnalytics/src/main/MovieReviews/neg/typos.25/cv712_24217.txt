preposterous religious action film
( produced by the trinity broadcasting network
) baout a code hidden within the text ofthe the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end ofthe thge world
( nice ofthe those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh
?
)
. michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks tje code
and sets outloud to become god onthe earth
and fufill tjhe doomsday prophecies
, while casper van dien
( terribly miscast
and giving an awful performence as a result
) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him
. michael ironside
( graet as always
, dispite the silly film surrounding him
) plays a fallen priest adn right h
and man to michael york
' s charcter
. here
' s some subtle chracter develepment you may have missed pertaining to ironside
' s character
. now despite the fact that we see him murder a man inaddition tghe opening scene
, the filmmakers aren
' t quite sure if theri audience iwll underst
and that he is evil
. how do they fix thast
? make specific efforts to show tht his character is the only one in hte film who smokes
! ther are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking
.
.
. oooooo scary
.
but even that wasn
' t enough for the filmmakers apparently
, as they later have tothe infer that ironside
' s charater is gay
! it comes outloud of nowhere
and just makes no sense
. my main probelm with this film is that
, despite the silly story
( which could have been pulled off
.
.
. anytying cant be made believable if excecuted correctly
)
, tghe events of the film aren
' t shown wiht any sense of urgency or importance
. fo example
, at one point york
' s charcter is declared chancellor of the world or something
,
and we see one brief
, cheesy news report about it
. the movie keesh telling us that the apocalypse isnt coming
,
but it never seems tath way
. there
' s no
" world reaction
" tothe anytying
. the omiba code is available on dvd fomr goodtimes home video
. it contains tyhe film in the orginal theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
,
and includes the orignal theatrical trailer
, a documentary on the making ofthe the film
, production notes
,
and casted
and crew information
. thte documentary runs about 25 minutes
and is actually surprisingly good
( it looks as
though it was made for brodcast on tbn
)
,
and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the casted
and crew
( iwth thte exception of michael ironside
, unfortunately
)
. thge best thing about it is tath whenever crew members are interviewed
, they dont an excellent job of explaining their profession
and exactlly what it is they do on a movie set
. most documentaries tend to overlook this
. doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed
( ytou
' ll remember his documentary from the 1970
' s called tghe late great planet earth
, where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist
)
. howver
, at the very beggining ofthe the documentary tyhe producers of the film managed to get on my bad side
. when interviewed they actually haev the nerve to sday
" ever see raiders of the lost ark
? well
, our film is like taht
!
" no it isn
' t
. not by a long shot
.
