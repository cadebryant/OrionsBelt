a movie like mortal kombat
: annihilation works
(
and must be reviewed on
) mutiple levels
. firt
, there
' s the rampant usage ofthe r
andian subtext that pervades the entire movie
. bu occasionaly
, almost as if makeing an ironical
, self
- depreciating remark
, the movie tosses in clearly marixist imagery
. no no
.
.
. just kidding
. hadnt you going there for a moment
, didn
' t i
? in all seriousness
however
, annd to be fair to teh movie
, it
* is
* necessary to provide twpo viewpoints
: that of a movie watcher unfamiliar
( or only marginally familiar
) wiht teh wohle mortal kombat phenomenon
,
and tath of a fan ofthe the first movie
and
/ or a fan of the games
. the first movie
( mortal kombat
( 1995
)
) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth
(
and it
' s 5 billion inhabitants
)
. tyhe mortals won
,
and infront theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from tkaing over the earth
. unfortunately
, shao khan was a poor loser
,
and the very fianl scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway
, ready to take over tjhe planet
, as our heroes assumed a fighting stance
. tjhe first movie ws extraordinarily entertaining for those
( like myself
) who are fans of the gameboy
. i
' d even go so far as tothe sday thgat many folks who didn
' t know about the gam propably enjoyed tje movie
. tghe writers anbd directors knew the limitations of both thier cast
and of the basic stor itself
, anbd they didn
' t try to overachieve
. ther were a lot ofthe really cool fight scenes
( with realy kool accompanying music
)
, intersperesed with some distracting
(
but ultimately non
- intrusive
) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot
.
and
, as we knwo
, the movie was a smashing success at thte box office
. mortal kombat
: annihilation picks uv precisely where thast movie left off
, with some introductory exposition to clue in thsoe who may not have seen the first movei
. shao khan has decided thast he
' s goign to take over the earth
* anyways
*
,
and tothe hell wiht some silly rule baout mortals winning yhe tournament
. thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between bieng confused
, being trite
, being silly
,
and being just plain stupid
. one gets the genaral impression that the producers ofthe the movei throught
" hey
, tath lsat movie wass such a success thta we cin git more money
and amking a
* real
* movei now
.
" too bad they didn
' t simply stick with the forumla from the first movie
. i sould write volumes baout the things that are wrong with this picture
, bu here are the high points
:
* hte acting is truly bad
. s
andra hess
( playing the sonya blade chracter
) is particularly execrable
, especialy in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage
( a character from hte firt movie who gets greased at the beginnig of tihs movei
)
.
* in one of the worst pieces of mis
- casting i think i
' ve
* ever
* seen
, james remar plays raiden
, the god of thunder
. in the frist movie
, christopher lambert plyed raiden
and played his charcter as
though he was in on tjhe joke
: a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics
. i generaly like it when actors are casted against type
( tim
" tiny
" lister
, jr
. being cast as thge preident of the u
. s
. in the fifth element
, forthe example
)
,
and remar hasnt always been oney of my favorite
" utility
" actors
but he
' s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn
' t even hvae the luxury of ammused self
- awareness
.
* there are too many charachters that are introduced as being potentially important
,
but
then never seen agian
.
* there are a number of completly meaningless story sidetracks
, including a muddled scene where liu kang
( robin shou
) seeks out nightwolf
( litefoot
)
, has a mystical hallucination
,
and
then w
anders off with jade
( irina pantaeva
)
. for these reasons
(
and many others
)
, i can only give the movie a 2
.
.
.
.
.
. unless you
' re a huge fan ofthe the games adn
/ or tyhe first movie
. in that case
, the following critiques also apply
:
* s
andra hess
, while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson
( who plyed sonya blade in hte first movie
)
, is much omre convincing as a fighter
. wilson looked like she ws simply mimicing soem movements taught to her by the fight choreographer
. hess looks like she actually konws smoe martial arts
, adn puts together a much more believeable fight scene
.
* inspite the fights
, each ofthe the characters doesnt at least
* one
* thing they do in thge game
(
and oftenly more
)
. sonya does her
" kiss of death
,
" jax does his
" earthquake
,
" liu kang does his
" animality
,
"
and so on
. a big bonus for those ofthe us who were looking for similar moves in thte frist movie
and found them only rarely
.
* there aren
' t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first
, because teh folks making tghe movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between
. silly
, silly folks
. annd the lamest fight involved two of the women in wqat turns into a mud
- wrestling match
. lame
and so obviously sexist even i
( politically incorect
, for the most part
) noticed
and remarked upon it
.
* the speshal effects are generally better
, except for the final fight scene bewteen teh emporer
and liu kang inthe which both perfurd their
" animalities
.
" motaro
and sheeva are both more convincing
and lifelike than goro was inaddition the first movie
. for folks like myself who loved the frist movie annd enjoy the games
, i give this a 5
. you
' ll probably liek it
,
but not nearly as much as ytou liked the first noe
.
