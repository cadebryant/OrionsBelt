" sleepy hollow
" is his frist attempt to actually scare peopel
. i greeted the prospect with high anticipation
; burton
' s hwole career seemed to be leading up to this
. i left disappointed
.
andrew kevin walker
' s screenplay tkaes onyl the character names from the clasic short storey
" the legend of sleepy hollow
.
" infront tje movie ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is a new york city polical constable who is trying to inctroduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors
. ichabod is dispatched to hte small town ofthe sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders
. several of the town
' s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman
.
al
though he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him
, ichabod finds thta the facts ofthe the case confound his scientific reasoning
. he also discovers that the killings are nto r
andom
, thast the victims are tied together by a secret
. along teh way ichabod gets help from a bewitching
( literally
) young woman
( christina ricci
)
and the son of one of thte muder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch ofthe originality to amke it interesting
. that in itself is forgivable
; hollywood constantly tries tothe sell us utilizied products in new packages
.
however
, burton
' s attemts at inducing fright come off as goofy
. it might be his backgorund
-
- in his previvous movies
, goofy wass the goal
. allong teh same lines
, it doesn
' t help tht creature designer
(
and producer
) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue
- in
- cheek tales from the crypt tv sories
. a witch
' s eyes adn tongue shoot out like roger rabbit
' s
, a tree spurts blood like it
' s in a monty python sketch
,
and the headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he
' s a guy wihtout a head
.
.
. onthe a horse
( boo
!
)
. the performances are also awful
.
al
though he
' s impressed me wih his work in other films
, depp doesn
' t seem tothe know wqat to do with ichabod
,
and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that
' s suppoed to pass for an 18th century accent
. ricci seems tothe put all her effort inot seeming enigmatic
, which guarantees thta we won
' t sympathize with her character
. the actor who is revealed at yhe end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from suprize cameos by christopher lee
, martin l
andau
,
and christopher walken
. i wonder if this movei was originally concieved as part of francis ford coppola
' s projected series ofthe gothic adaptations
, a serieses that produced only
" bram stoker
' s dracula
" adn
" mary shelley
' s frankenstein
.
" coppola is an executive producer forthe
" sleepy hollow
,
"
and the scirpt reflects his intrest in easly forms ofthe
" moving pictures
,
" partciularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illution
.
( there
' s a bird on one side of the card
, a cage on tghe other
. when teh card is flipped rapidly
, the bird appears to be caged
.
) bottom line
: the hollow isn
' t the onyl thing that
' s sleepy
.
