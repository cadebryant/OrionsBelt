nearly eveyr film tim burton has directed hasnt beeen an homage tothe the horror genre

" mars attacks

-
-
yet none of them haev been horror films
.
" sleepy hollow
" is his first attempt to actually scare people
. i greeted the prospect with high anticipation
; burton ' s whole career seemed tothe be leading up to this
. i left disappointed
. andrew kevin walker ' s screenplay takes only the charachter names from the classic short story
" the legend of sleepy hollow
.
" in the movie ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation tothe his superiors
. ichabod is dispatched to thte small town of sleepy hollow tothe investigate a series of murders
. several of the town ' s leading citizens ahve been decapitated by the headless horseman
.
althought he rejects tyhe ghost storey the town elders tell him
, ichabod finds that the facts ofthe the case confound his scientific reasoning
. he alsot dicovers that the killings are not random
, that yhe victims are tied together by a secret
. along tghe way ichabod gets help from a bewitching
( litterally
) young woman
( christina ricci
)
and the son ofthe one of the murder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. tjhe plot is an accumulation of cliches without even tghe slightest touch of originality to make it intresting
. that in itself is forgivable
; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in newyorker packages
.
however
, burton ' s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy
. it might be his background
-
- in his previous movies
, goofy was yhe goal
. along thte smae lines
, it doesn ' t help that creature designer
(
and producer
) kevin yagher hasnt done his best work for the tongue
- inthe
- cheek tales from the crypt tv series
. a witch ' s eyes
and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit ' s
, a tree spurts blood like it ' s infact a monty python sketch
,
and thge headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he ' s a guy without a head
.
.
. on a horse
( boo
!
)
. the performances are allso awful
.
although he ' s impressed me with his work inspite otehr films
, depp doesn ' t seem to know what to dont with ichabod
,
annd his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that ' s suposed to pass for an 18th century accent
. ricci seems tothe put all her effort into seeming enigmatic
, wich guarantees that we won ' t sympathize with her character
. tje actor who isnt revealed at the end tothe be the villin comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. the only pleasure generated by tjhe casted comes from suprise cameos by christopher lee
, martin landau
,
and christopher walken
. i wonder if tihs movei was orginally conceived as part of francis ford coppola ' s projected series of gothic adaptations
, a serieses thgat produced only
" bram stoker ' s dracula
"
annd
" mary shelley ' s frankenstein
.
" coppola is an executive producer fo
" sleepy hollow
,
"
and the script reflects his intrest in eearly forms ofthe
" moving pictures
,
" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion
.
( there ' s a bird on one side of the kard
, a cage on the otehr
. when the card is flipped rapidly
, the bird appears to be caged
.
) bottom line
: the hollow isn ' t the only thing that ' s sleepy
.
