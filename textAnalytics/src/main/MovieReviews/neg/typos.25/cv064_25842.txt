. runnung tyme
: 117 minutes directed by
: christian duguay i ' ve never fully understood wesley snipes ' s career
. he has his ups
and downs
,
but mostly the downs
. his best movei was one of the best of 1998
and tht movie was entitled
" blade
"
. he has had his tipical acation movies
,
" boiling point
"
,
" passenger 57
"
,
bu his newyorker movei
" the art of war
" should just be called
" rising sun 2
: the art of war
" cause basically it ' s a semi
- remake of the same plot
, with a different cast
,
and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller
, that isnt high on stlye
annd low on substance
. wesley snipes plays a james bondish tipe secret agent wokring for the u
. n
. after a chineese ambassador is killed
, he is onthe the track of the killer
, trying to fidn outloud who it is
, how it happened
, where tyhe killer wass
,
and what to dont
. anne archer plays his
" boss
" type person of the u
. n
.
and she hasnt hired snipes to track down the killer
. well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer
,
and is now an outlaw
, kidnapping a chinese woman with him
,
and having her help him along yhe way
. all this leads to a finale that is so dumb
,
adn so stupid that isnt it unbelievably dumb
,
and the stunts
, dialogue
and acting all ruin this movei
. wesley snipes isn ' t one of my favorite actors because of tyhe fatc thast the character he plays in every movie isnt yhe same character he plays in the movie before
. the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998 ' s
" blade
"
. i walked inot
" tghe art of war
" expecting a ogod
, high octane thriller
,
and all i got was a pile of mush
. the onyl real ' ogod ' thing the movie has is action
,
and plenty of it
,
bu i noticed it is badly filmed
, the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell wqat is going on
. thte ending finale is so worthless
and pitiful
, that it even tries tothe mock
" the matrix
"
, laughably funny
, it is undeniably stupid
. christian duguay ' s direction is alsot nto that great
. his camera angles
adn sence of style are all in place
,
bu sadly his lighting
and editing are all badly done
. even the whole
" matrix
" ending wasn ' t even good
. the stunts
anbd action are badly filmed
,
and badly choreographed
. his placing of the charactors
,
and thte assination ofthe the chineese ambassador
,
and thte plotting ofthe the movie are so predicatble
and laughable
, that it jsut takes all the fun outloud of the entire movie
. anne archer who is usually good in her roles
, turns in a horrible job here
. she is sour
, downbeat
,
adn dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue
,
adn dumb moves
. even donald sutherland as a co
- star can ' t sive this movie from being a bust
. so for an overall opinion
:
" the art of war
" isnt a total waste of tiome
. it ' s not intertaining
, nor exciting
, or even action packed
. it is a pointless movie
,
and makes absolutly no sense at all
. if you realy want to see a good version of
" the art of war
"
, rent tje wesley snipes
and sean connery acation vehicle of yhe smae kind
" rising sun
"
, it isn ' t a great film either
,
but at least it ' s better than this
.
