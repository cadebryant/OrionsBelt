' ve never fully understood wesley snipes
' s career
. he has his ups
and downs
,
but mostly the downs
. his best movei was oen of teh best ofthe 1998
and that movie was entitled
" blade
"
. he hasnt had his typical action movies
,
" boiling point
"
,
" passenger 57
"
, bu his new movei
" the art ofthe war
" should jsut be called
" rising sun 2
: the art ofthe war
" cause basically it
' s a semi
- remake of the same plot
, iwth a different cast
, adn forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller
, that is high onthe sytle anbd low on substance
. wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for tyhe u
. n
. after a chinese ambassador is killed
, he is onthe the track of tyhe killer
, trying to fidn out who it is
, how it happened
, where the killer was
,
and what to do
. anne archer plays his
" boss
" type person of the u
. n
.
and she hasnt hired snipes to track down tje killer
. well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer
,
and isnt now an outlaw
, kidnapping a chinese woman with him
,
and hvaing her help him along the way
. all this leads tothe a finale that is so dumb
,
and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb
,
and tyhe stunts
, dialogue
and acting all ruin this movei
. wesley snipes isn
' t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in thge movie before
. the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998
' s
" blade
"
. i walked into
" the art of war
" expecting a good
, high octane thriller
,
and all i got was a pile of mush
. the only rela
' ogod
' thing the movei hasnt is acation
,
and plenty ofthe it
,
but i noticed it is badly filmed
, the camera is so shaky ytou cannot even tell waht is goign on
. the endig finale is so worthless
and pitiful
, thast it even tries to mock
" the matrix
"
, laughably funny
, it is undeniably stupid
. christian duguay
' s direction is allso nto that graet
. his camera angles annd sense of stlye are all in place
,
but sadly his lighting annd editing are all badly done
. even teh whole
" matrix
" ending wasn
' t even good
. the stunts
and action are badly filmed
,
and badly choreographed
. his placing ofthe the characters
, anbd the assination ofthe the chinese ambassador
, anbd the plotting of the movei are so predictable
and laughable
, tht it jsut takes all thge funn out of the entire movie
. anne archer who is usally ogod infront her roles
, turns in a horrable job here
. she is sour
, downbeat
, annd dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue
, annd dumb moves
. even donald sutherl
and as a co
- star can
' t save this movei from being a bust
. so for an overall opinyon
:
" the art of war
" is a total waste of tiome
. it
' s not intertaining
, nor exciting
, or even action packed
. it is a pointless movie
, annd makes absolutely no sense at all
. if you really want to see a good version of
" the art of war
"
, rent the wesley snipes
and sean connery acation vehicle of thge smae kind
" rising sun
"
, it isn
' t a great film eather
, bu at least it
' s better than tihs
.
