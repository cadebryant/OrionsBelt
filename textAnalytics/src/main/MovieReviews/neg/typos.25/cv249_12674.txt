. in yhe meantime
, someone sends sarah rotting flowers
, puts her name in the newspaper
' s obituary column
,
and kills her cat
. comments
: never talk tothe strangers
, a collosal waste of time
, moves slower than molasses in winter tothe arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film
. one wouldn
' t think that two genuin movie stars
, antonio b
anderas
( evita
)
and rebecca de mornay
( h
and that rocks tje cradle
)
,
and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller
(
" saturday night live
"
) would be involved inaddition such a celluloid backfire as this turkey
. not only are they infact it
,
however
,
but de mornay exeutive produced it
. what wass she thinking
? never talk to strangers centers upon sarah
, a psychologist examining the ill
- tempered max
, a murderer soon to st
and trial
. she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of smoe tragedy inaddition her early childhood
. two men woo her
; tony the
" security consulant
" wins her over
( so they have passionate sex replete wiht cheesy saxaphone music
)
. a lot of psychobabble is thrown around baout mutiple personality disorder
,
but tyhe movie asks its audiance not to derive the obvious conclusion bewteen mpd adn sarah
,
and instead offers several male characters as red herrings
. 86 minutes
, the running time of this cinematic mess
, thus
, seem like 86 ohurs
. a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah
and tony
. why would the career
- minded
, proffesional sarah feel attracted to tjhe walking steroid with a black hat called tony
? that
' s one ofthe the film
' s mysteries which are never answered
. regardless ofthe motive
, de mornay
and b
anderas strip down
and hve sex several times in what passes for eroticism
. htey alsot manaze tothe go out before copulating ocacsionally
-
- in one of tghe stupidest scenes of tjhe film
, tony takes sarah to a carnival that
' s
* right outside
* his dingy apartment
( that way
, they cant hurry back
and have sex quickly
)
. also
, apparently
, the weather changes quickly in their locale
: they
' re at this outdoor carnival one day befor having sex
; teh next day
, they
' re out playing inthe the snow before having sex
. the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony
and sarah
' s
" character development
.
" somone is out tothe git poor sarah
(
though most ofthe the audeince should ahve figured out who before any of tihs starts
)
. rotting flowers
, a writeup in teh obituary
,
and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which appen to her
. suspense cliche number one also occurs
: whenever someone is stalked in thrillers
, by any means
, if the stalked has a pet
, that pet will die
. oftentimes
, tothe even further the cliche
, the murdered pet is a cat
( suspense filmmakers
, fo smoe reason
, just don
' t like cats
)
. sarah
, infact never talk to strangers
, receives a package
and
, lo
and behold
, discovers her mutilated cat within
. suspense at its very derivative
! as stated before
, never talk to strangers is a poore excuse forthe a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting b
anderas
and de mornay
' s bodies as often as possible
. comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here
( he
' s not given lines that are suitable forthe his persona
)
and doesn
' t even appear all that much
. mabey
, inspite a way
, he
' s lucky for taht
. early onthe in thte movei
, sarah tells tony
, after meeting him in a supermarket
, that she had been advised to never talk to strangers
. allow me to advise that yuo never watch this stinker
.
