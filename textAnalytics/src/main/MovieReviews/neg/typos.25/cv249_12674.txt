synopsis
: blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the misteryous puerto rican rether than bearded cliff the wisecracking nighbor upstairs
. inwhich the meantime
, someone sends sarah rotting flowers
, puts her name in the newspaper ' s obituary column
,
and kills her cat
. comments
: never talk to strangers
, a collosal waste of time
, moves slower thna molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into tghe film
. oen wouldn ' t think that two genuine movei stars
, antonio banderas
( evita
)
and rebecca de mornay
( hand that rocks the cradle
)
,
and yhe acerbic comic genuis dennis miller
(
" saturday night live
"
) owudl be involved inspite such a celluloid backfire as this turkey
. nto only are they in it
,
however
,
but de mornay xeecutive produced it
. what was she thikning
? never talk to strangers centers upon sarah
, a psychologist examining tje ill
- tempered max
, a murderer soon to stand trial
. she recieves a sudden visit fomr her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy infact her early childhood
. two men woo her
; tony the
" security consultant
" wins her over
( so tehy have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music
)
. a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality desorder
,
bu the movie asks its audience not to derive teh obvious conclusion between mpd
and sarah
,
and instead offers several male characters as red herrings
. 86 minutes
, the running time of this cinematic mess
, thus
, seem like 86 hours
. a good chunk of never talk tothe strangers is spent apon sarah
and tony
. why would the career
- minded
, proffesional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony
? that ' s noe of the film ' s mysteries whihc are never answered
. irregardless of motive
, de mornay
and banderas strip down
and have sex sevral times in what passes for eroticism
. they aslo manage to go out before copulating occasoinally
-
- in one of thte stupidest scenes of the film
, tony takes sarah to a carnival that ' s
* right outside
* his dingy appartment
( that way
, they can hurry back
and have sex quickly
)
. also
, apparently
, the ewather changes quickly inaddition thier locale
: they ' re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex
; the next day
, they ' re out palying in the snow before hvaing sex
. the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed wiht tony
and sarah ' s
" character development
.
" someone is out to get poor sarah
(
though most of teh audience shouldnt hvea figured out who before any of this starts
)
. rotting flowers
, a writeup in the obituary
,
and a beaten neighbor are just a faw ofthe the bad things whic hapen to her
. suspense cliche number one also occurs
: whenever someone is stalked in thrillers
, by any means
, if the stalked has a pet
, tht pet will die
. oftentimes
, to even further tjhe cliche
, the murdered pet is a cat
( suspense filmmakers
, fo some reason
, just don ' t like cats
)
. sarah
, in never talk tothe strangers
, recieves a package
and
, lo
and behold
, discovers her mutiliated cat within
. suspense at its vyre derivative
! as stated before
, never talk to strangers is a poore excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas
and de mornay ' s bodies as often as possible
. comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here
( he ' s not given lines tyhat are suitable for his persona
)
and doesn ' t even appear all that much
. mabye
, in a way
, he ' s lucky for that
. early on in thte movie
, sarah tells tony
, aftter meeting him in a supermarket
, that she had been adviced to never talk to strangers
. allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker
.
