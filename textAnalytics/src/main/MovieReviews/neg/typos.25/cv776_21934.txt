the most depressing thing baout the depressingly pedestrian james bond film
" the world isnt not enough
" is its final frame
: white letters on a black background proclaiming
" james bond iwll return
.
" oh i certainly hope not
. with pierce brosnan in his third
and reportedly last go
- round as james bond 007
,
" the world is not enough
" is hte best example to date that
"
' enough
" is enough
. in this
, the 19th chapter inaddition the seemingly
- endless franchise featuring ian fleming
' s debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis
-
-
and his nemeses
-
- shaken not stirred
, tje sub
- inspired screenwriters have choosen tothe rehash all ofthe the setups
, stunts
, adn sexy encounters ofthe the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit orginal
. we
' ve got previously
- utilizied speedboat chases
, ski chases
, annd sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines
. we
' ve got a couple ofthe hot
- tothe
- trot babes without an ounce ofthe acting ability between them
. we
' ve got a post
- cold war megalomaniac bent onthe world dominaton slash destruction
( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle wiht mean
, leanr panache
)
.
and
, as has been the case usance 1977
' s
" the spy who loved me
,
" we
' ve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever tothe do with anytying conceived by mr
. fleming
. we
' ve also got a main title song by garbage to which
, with very littel effort
, you can fit the lyrics tothe
* both
* songs from
" tomorrow never dies
.
" while originality was never the serieses
' strong suit
, thge films weere almost alwyas funn
, with at least some
thought going into the nonstop stunts
. i can
' t think ofthe one memorable set
- piece infact hte entire
-
-
and veyr dull
-
-
" yhe world is nto enough
.
" iin addtion
, michael apted
( yes
, the respected director of such films as
" coal miner
' s duaghter
,
"
" nell
,
"
and the
" 28up
" documentary series
) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich
? s
. you get the
" tlaking killer
" plot device
-
- you know the scenario
: the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yot waxes poetic just long enought to die of old age
.
and you get a slew of high
- priced assassins who cxan
' t hit a barn doorjam at 20 paces
: in the film
' s opening minutes
( of an endless 128
)
, bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames adn the leather
- claded lovely fails to hit bond
' s souped
- up
" fishing boat
" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet ofthe her
. later
, she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling fomr a guy rope beneath her
but is still unable to tkae him outloud
. theese reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual usance there are noone distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles
, vodka
, or credit cards
. in
and among the rampant product placements
, brosnan grapples with carlyle
,
" braveheart
"
' s sophie marceau
( as fromer kidnap victum slash heiress elektra king
; she
' s terrible
)
,
" wild thigsn
"
' denise richards
( as a nucular physicist lord help me
; she
' s laughable
)
, annd judi dench as m
. dame judi brings the onyl shred ofthe dignity tothe a series taht has long since jettisoned its self
- respect
( about the tiome roger moore inherited bond
' s walther ppk
)
. brosnan goes through the motions with the grace
and charm you
' d expect of tghe former
" remington steele
" star
, bu even he has to be thinking there
' s omre to life than an easy paycheck
. he
' s given plenty ofthe wiseacre asides to deliver
,
but onyl one of them
-
-
" i don
' t know any doctor jokes
"
-
- made me chuckle
(
al
though
" i thougth christmas onyl comes once a year
" is more infront keeping wtih the series
' penchant forthe grown
- worthy puns
)
