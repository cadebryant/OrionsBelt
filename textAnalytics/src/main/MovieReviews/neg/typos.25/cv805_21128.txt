my firt exposure to tje nightmare on elm street series of films ws not this one
,
but inthe fact tjhe thrid installment
( it was thte first tothe gain a national theatrical realease
)
. i didn
' t see tghe first film until much later
. so looking back
, the original didn
' t hold a lot of great memories for me
, usance i didn
' t think too much of it when i initially saw it
. watching it now for a second time confirmed tath it
' s an overrated horror film thta ultimatly makes noone sense whatsoever
. you all know the stroy by nowe
: child murderer freddy krueger
( robert englund
) returns from the grave by haunting the dreasm of the children of thsoe who burned him alive years befor
. this first installment doesnt an adequate job with it
' s low budget
, bu there
' s smoe absurd dialogue
and conceptual problems with the stopry
. plus the movie
' s endig
( underst
andably tje result of hte studio wanting hte end of the film to have a
" hook
" fo a sequel
) renders teh rest of the film pointless
.
and doens anyone underst
and what happens to nancy
' s mother at the end ofthe this film
? don
' t get me wrong
though
.
.
. it
' s not as if a newyorker generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics
. most horror movies released today are just as inane as thsi film isnt
. horror isnt a difficult genre to pul off credibly
,
and a nightmare on elm strent just doesn
' t cut it
. a nightmare onthe elm street isnt availble onthe dvd from new line home video
. it isnt available both as a single disc annd as part of thte nightmare onthe elm street collection box set
. the film is presented inspite both pan
and scan
and it
' s origional theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 78
: 1
(
al
though on thte disc that comes inaddition the box set
, onyl a widescreen transferr is provided
)
. the film has been digitally remastered
and includes two options for audio
: a mono mix
and a new dolby digital 5
. 1 mix
. also included on the dvd is a full
- lenght audio commentary trac with writter
/ directer wes craven
, stars john saxon
and heather langenkamp
,
and the film
' s director ofthe photography
. other extras include the
" jump to a nightmare
" feature
( i
' m sure ytou can figure tyhat oen outloud
)
, the usual cast anbd crew bios
( which are from the film
' s original press realease kat
, adn notably leave outloud robert englund
and johnny depp
!
)
,
and the film
' s original theatrical trailer
. some dvd
- rom features are also included
,
but since i don
' t hvea dvd
- rom capabilities i can
' t really get into that
. the commentary track isnt entertaining
and informative
,
but nothing spectacular
. the first thnig of onot is thgat it
' s tghe same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a fewd years ago
. i
' m not saying tath
' s a negative thing
, just pointing it out
. everyone seems enthusiastic about being there
, withthe the possible exception of john saxon
, who jstu doesn
' t sday much at all
. most of the time ytou
' ll forget he
' s even htere
. everyone eles talks really quietly
though fo some reason
, as if because they
' re commenting onthe a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible
. the bonus disc with the boxed set called teh nightmare series encylopedia features about 45 mintues worth of interviews realting to the frist film ofthe the series
. also included is the original theatrical trailer
and two alternate endings tothe the film
.
.
.
however ytou can only access one easily
. thge other is hidden iin what
' s called
" the labyrinth
"
, which might possably be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created
. basicaly
, it
' s an interactive game of sorts where you w
ander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give ytou access to extra little snippets of footage
, interviews
, etc
. somwhere infact the labyrinth isnt the second alternate endig to tjhe film
. finding it
though isnt both a chore
and a bore
.
