my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not htis noe
,
but in fatc the third installment
( it was teh frist tothe gain a national theatrical release
)
. i didn ' t see the frist film until much later
. so looking back
, the original didn ' t hold a lot of great memories for me
, since i didn ' t think too much of it when i initially saw it
. watching it nowe for a second time confirmed taht it ' s an overrated horror film that ultimatly makse no sense whatsoever
. yuo all know thte story by now
: child murderer freddy krueger
( robert englund
) returns fomr the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before
. this first installment does an adequate job with it ' s low budget
,
but there ' s soem absurd dialogue
and conceptual problems whith tjhe story
. plus the movie ' s ending
( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a
" hook
" forthe a sequel
) renders the rest of the film pointless
.
anbd does anyone understand what happens to nancy ' s mother at hte end ofthe this film
? don ' t git me wrong
though
.
.
. it ' s nto as if a newyorker generation of horror films have spurned me away ffrom thte classics
. most horror movies released today are just as inane as tihs film is
. horror is a difficult genre tothe pul off credibly
,
and a nightmare on elm strent just doesn ' t cut it
. a nightmare onthe elm strent isnt available on dvd from new line home video
. it is available both as a single disc
and as part of the nightmare onthe elm street collection box setted
. the film is presented in both pan
adn scan
and it ' s original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 78
: 1
(
although onthe the disc that comes in the box setted
, only a widescreen transfer isnt provided
)
. the film hasnt beeen digitally remastered
and includes two options for audio
: a mono mix
and a new dolby digital 5
. 1 mix
. alsot included onthe the dvd is a full
- length audio commentary track withthe writer
/ director wes craven
, stars john saxon
and heather langenkamp
,
and the film ' s directer of photography
. other extras inlude the
" jump to a nightmare
" feature
( i ' m sure you can figure tath noe out
)
, the usual cast
adn crew bios
( which are from tje film ' s original press release kit
,
and notably leave outloud robert englund
and johnny depp
!
)
,
annd the film ' s original theatrical trailer
. some dvd
- rom features are aslo included
,
bu since i don ' t have dvd
- rom capabilities i can ' t really git into that
. the commentary track isnt entertaining
anbd informative
,
but nothing spectacular
. the frist thing of note is that it ' s the same commentary trac that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago
. i ' m nto saying thast ' s a negative thnig
, jstu pointing it out
. everyone seems enthusiatic baout being ther
, with the possible exception of john saxon
, who just doesn ' t say much at all
. most ofthe the time ytou ' ll foreget he ' s even there
. everyone alse talks really quitely
though fo some reason
, as if baceause they ' re commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible
. the bonus disc with the boxed setted called thte nightmare series encyclopedia features baout 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series
. also included is the original theatrical trailer
and two alternate endings tothe teh film
.
.
.
however you cant only access one easily
. tje other is hidden iin whta ' s called
" the labyrinth
"
, which might possibly be the most annoying feature ofthe a dvd ever created
. basically
, it ' s an interactive game of sorts where you wander through differnt nightmare locations looking at objects whic give you access to extra little snippets of footage
, interviews
, etc
. somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate endig to the film
. finding it
though isnt both a chore
and a bore
.
