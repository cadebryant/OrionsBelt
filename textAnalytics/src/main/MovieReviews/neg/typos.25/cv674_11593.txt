steve martin is one ofthe the funniest men alive
. if you can take thgat as a true statement
, thn your dissapointment at this film will equal mine
. martin can be hilarious
, creating smoe ofthe tjhe best laugh
- out
- loud experiences that have ever taken place iin movei theaters
. ytou won
' t find any of them here
. the ood televsion serieses that this is based on has its moments of humor anbd wit
. bilko
(
and the name isn
' t an accident
) is tghe head of an army motor pool group
,
but his passion isnt his schemes
. every episode involves yhe sergeant
and his men in one or another hair
- brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the offcers ofthe the base
.
" mchale
' s navy
"
' s gr
anddaddy
. that
' s the idea behind this movie too
, bu the difference is that
, as far
- fetched anbd usually goofy as the television series was
, it wass funny
. htere is nto one laugh iin tghe film
. the re
- make retains the goofiness
,
but not the entertainment
. everything is just too clean
. it was obviously made on a hollywood bakc lot
and looks every bit like it
. it all looks br
and new
, even yhe ood beated
- uv stuff
. martin is remarkably small in whta should have beeen a bigger than life role
. inthe the original
, phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold anbd more than a touch of sleaziness
. martin
' s bilko is a pale immitation
. the only semi
- bright spot is phil hartman as bilko
' s arch
- enemy
. it
' s nto saying much
, considering martin
' s lackluster carachter
,
but hartman leaves him in the dust
