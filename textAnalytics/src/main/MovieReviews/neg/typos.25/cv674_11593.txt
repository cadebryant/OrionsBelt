steve martin is one ofthe the funniest men alive
. if you can take that as a true statement
,
then your dissapointment at tihs film iwll equal mine
. martin cant be hillarious
, creating some of the best laugh
- out
- loud experiences that have ever taked place in movie theaters
. you won ' t fidn any of them here
. the old television series that tihs is based on has its moments ofthe humer
and witn
. bilko
(
and the name isn ' t an accident
) is the head ofthe an army motor pool group
,
but his passion is his schemes
. eveyr episode involves the sergeant
and his men in one or another hair
- brained plan to git rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base
.
" mchale ' s navy
" ' s granddaddy
. tht ' s the idea behind this movie too
,
but hte diference is taht
, as far
- fetched
and usually goofy as tje television serieses was
, it wass funny
. htere is not one laff in tje film
. the re
- make retains the goofiness
,
but nto the enteratinment
. everything is jsut too clean
. it was obviously made on a hollywood bcak lot
adn looks every bit like it
. it all looks brand new
, even the old beat
- uv sutff
. martin isnt remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role
. iin tghe original
, phil silvers played tje huckster with a heart ofthe gold
and more than a touch of sleaziness
. martin ' s bilko is a pale imitation
. tjhe only semi
- bright spot is phil hartman as bilko ' s arch
- enemy
. it ' s not saying much
, considering martin ' s lackluster character
,
but hartman leaves him inaddition the dust
.
