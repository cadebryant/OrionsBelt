talk about beating a dead horse
! wehn home alone wass released in 1990
, it ws a breath of fresh air
, adn tghe final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely
- funny familiy film
. the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel
, so
, two years later
, we were subjected tothe home alone 2
, hwihc might as well have been called clone alone forthe all of the originality it exhibited
. forthe john hughes
, twpo home alone movies weren
' t enough
? he began recycling the same kinds ofthe villains
and situations in alomst every movie he was involved with
, incuding a pathetic box office bomb called baby
' s day out
, last year
' s live
- action 101 dalmatians
,
and this yera
' s flubber
. now
, inexplicably
, hughes has exhumed not only these worn
- outloud plot elements
,
but the
" hmeo alone
" name as well
. the result
? 1997
' s worst sequel
( edging out speed 2 adn batman adn robin
)
, hmeo alone 3
. by changing tghe characters
, hughes
( who wrote
and co
- produced the film
)
, allong with his co
- conspiriator
, director raja gosnell
, hasnt attemted to inject new life into a series thta isnt way past the point ofthe cardiac arrest
. the new kid
, alex pruitt
, is played by alex d
. linz
( one fine day
)
,
and the only thing he has going for him isnt terminal cuteness
. he
' s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was
. the villains
, pale copies ofthe joe pesci adn daniel stern
, are even less engaging thna the pair of idiots inthe flubber
. in home alone 3
, there are four of them
( olek krupa
, david thornton
, lenny von dohlen
,
and rya kihlstedt
)
, bu all thgat means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls
. this time
, the kid isn
' t left home alone beccause his parents hve gone on a trip
. instead
, he has developed a bad case ofthe chicken pox
, so he can
' t go to school
. his dad
( kevin kilner
) is away onthe business anbd his mom
( havil
and morris
) hasnt to run err
ands
, so
, for the most part
, he
' s all by himself durring tje day
. through a series ofthe coincidences too irritating to relate
, a top secret u
. s
. air force integrated circuit comes into his possession
. it
' s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend tothe break inot alex
' s home to retreive it
. thge eight
- year old
, who is wise beyond his eyars
, booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg
- type devices designed to humiliate
and incapacitate the villains
. the movie
' s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm
? only none of hte falling flakes looks remotely believable
. previously
, the most counterfeit
- looking snow effects i can remember were inthe star trak iii
. these are far worse
. in fact
, the prodcution values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near
- blizzard whn a shining sun can be seen
. if it
' s a wonderful life could ganerate rela
- looking snow back in the 1940s
, why can
' t home alone 3
, wich has a significantly larger budget
and
' 90s technology at its disposal
? there has been an ongoing debate regarding teh appropriateness ofthe live
- acation cartoon violence for young children
. home alone 3 will add fuel to thge fire
. it
' s one thing to see wyle e
. coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight
,
but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen
. adults
and even older children will recognize that tihs is obviously fake annd intended to be humorous
,
but what about five
and six
- year olds
? the levle ofthe violence in home alone 3 is extreme
? many of alex
' s schemes are nasty enough to kill
.
but
, because this is a
" family film
,
" no one dies
, despite bieng electrocuted
, falling thirty foots
,
and getting smacked on the head by a barbell
. nto only isnt home alone 3 unnecessary
,
but it
' s offensive
. it
' s an exercise in tediousness
,
and there isn
' t a genuine laugh tothe be foudn from the beginnig tothe the end
( unless
, by some strange quirk of fate
, you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes
,
and thus haven
' t seen thsi stuff before
)
. i can
' t imagin anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure
. mabey that
' s why the onyl ones laughing at the screening i attended weere still in thier thumb
- sucking years
