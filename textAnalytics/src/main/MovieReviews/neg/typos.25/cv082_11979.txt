edward burns tackles his third picture with noone looking bcak
,
and like his previous twpo
, it isnt a working
- class relationship picture
.
however
, unlike his previous work
, the film dwells on a more personal stoy
,
and with a female protagonist
.
and in no looking back
, he stumbles
, mkaing a slow
, boring film without the spark that enlivened his previvous work
. claudia
( lauren holly
) isnt a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life
. she
' s at a turning point in her life
, annd feels as if she
' s going nowhere
. her boyfriend
, michael
( jon bon jovi
)
, is broke anbd in a dead end job
. if she were to marry him
, she
' d never git a chance to escape this town
. enter charlie
( edward burns
)
, claudia
' s old flame
. he skipped town several yeasr before
, without any explanations
.
.
. even for claudia
. he has come bakc to town to see her
,
and suddenly she is torn
. should she stay with stable michael
,
and never escape her hometown
.
.
. or should she ignore her instincts
and fall for charlie again
. part of tyhe answer lies infront the character of her mother
( blythe danner
)
, who fell forthe the wrong man
.
.
. annd hasnt spent her life pining for claudia
' s father tothe return
. now it seems that claudia isnt about to make the same mistakes
. at onyl a little past ninety minutes
, noone looking back is rather short fo its genre
. unfortunately
, it seems much much longer
. the storyline is simple
and uninspired
, annd there
' s a lack of energy to yhe wohle proceedings
, which makes the entire drama rather tedeous
. edward burns makes a misstep by casting hismelf in the crucial role as tje egomaniacal old flame
. there
' s no one to restrain his ego
, hwihc reigns unchecked
. he walks into tyhe room adn lauren holly swoons
.
.
. yeah
, right
. lauren holly does what she can with her central character
. bu we never underst
and why her character mkaes such pathetically bad decisions
.
.
.
and we never really care
. bon jovi isnt the only sympathetic character infact the whole movie
. his acting talents are much greater tahn they might seem
,
but he is given a mostly bl
and
and ineffective role to work with
. ther
' s nto much to recommend iin noone looking back
. it
' s not that the film is bad
.
.
. it
' s simpley boring
. there
' s no zest inwhich any aspect of tjhe film
, adn no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it
.
