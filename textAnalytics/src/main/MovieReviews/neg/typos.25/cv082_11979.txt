edward burns tackles his third picture with noone looking back
,
and like his previous two
, it is a working
- class relationship picture
.
however
, unlike his previvous work
, the film dwells on a more personal tsory
,
and whith a female protagonist
.
and in no looking back
, he stumbles
, making a slow
, boring film wihtout the spark that enlivened his previous work
. claudia
( lauren holly
) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life
. she ' s at a turning point infact her life
,
and feels as if she ' s going nowhere
. her boyfriend
, michael
( jon bon jovi
)
, isnt broke
anbd in a dead end job
. if she were to marry him
, she ' d never get a chance tothe escape this twon
. enter charlie
( edward burns
)
, claudia ' s old flame
. he skipped town sevral years before
, without any explanations
.
.
. even for claudia
. he hasnt come bakc to town to see her
,
and suddenly she is torn
. should she stay with stable michael
,
and never escape her hometown
.
.
. or should she ignore her instincts
and fall for charlie again
. part of the answer lies in the character of her mother
( blythe danner
)
, who fell for the wrong man
.
.
.
adn has spent her life pining for claudia ' s father tothe return
. now it seems that claudia is baout to make the same mistakes
. at onyl a littel past ninety minutes
, no looking back is rather short for its genre
. unfortunately
, it seems much much longer
. thge storyline is simple
and uninspired
,
and ther ' s a lack of energy to the whole proceedings
, whcih makes the entire drama rather tedeous
. edward burns mkaes a misstep by casting himself in yhe crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame
. htere ' s noone oen to restrain his ego
, which reigns unchecked
. he walks inot the room
anbd lauren holly swoons
.
.
. yeah
, right
. lauren holly does what she can with her central character
.
but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions
.
.
.
and we never really care
. bon jovi is tjhe only sympathetic character in the whole movie
. his acting talents are much greater tahn htey might seem
,
but he is given a mostly bland
anbd ineffective role to work wih
. there ' s not much to recommend inspite no looking bakc
. it ' s nto that the film is bad
.
.
. it ' s simpley boring
. ther ' s noone zest infact any aspect of the film
,
and no reason to spend ninety mintues watching it
.
