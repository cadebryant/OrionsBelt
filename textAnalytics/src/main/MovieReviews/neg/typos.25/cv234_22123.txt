five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king ' s writings called tje shawshank redemption
( 9
/ 10
)
, writter
/ director frank darabont returns to the big screen with anyother prision film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king
. unlike the latter film
, thsi oen isnt a big
, long
, laborious bore
. plot
: a seven
- foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers
. critique
: this film is slow
, drawn
- out
, boring
, uninteresting
, unexciting
, predicatble
annd topped with a couple ofthe one
- dimentional
" evil
" cahracters
. its only positive attribute lies iin its actors who all do credible jobs
and its message of hope
and belief in miracles
. the real miracle ofthe my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward
, unimpressive film about a guy with spacial powers who we never truely understand or care about
. ofthe course
, much like all other death row cell blocks
, this one is filled with decent inmates who all happn to be
" misunderstood
"
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guy who is evil personified
.
and let ' s nto foreget all the guards on death row
, who also happn to be angels fomr the heaven above
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified
(
and is htere any reason why there are baout six guards when there appears to be no more tahn threee inmates
?
?
?
)
. am i suppossed to idenify iwth anyone in this film
? or even more importantly
, am i supposed to give a rat ' s ass about anyone in this film
? well
, if i was
, i sure missed thast boat
, because the only thign that i ended uv caring about during this entire picture was thte obscene amount ofthe fat that tom hanks has beeen able tothe burrow under his loose chin
. futhermore
, there is absolutely no reason in tje world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours
and ten minutes out ofthe anyone ' s life to present this storey
. inwhich fact
, the story is empty withing itself
. i truly did nto git anything outloud of the film other than tje fact tht there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal
,
and we are left wondering if he shoudln still be executed or not
. wow
. how intresting
. the plot ' s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film
( we are told thast one certain lady hasnt a tumor early on iin the movie
)
. whip out thsoe thinking caps
, kids
! hmmm
,
and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie
- cutter
" evil
" guys who have nothing infact thier system
bu hate
and negativity
. hmmmm
, now think hard here
, boys
and girls
. what a crock
! i am guessing that this film ws supposed to be some threee
- hour exersize in spirituality
,
but unfortunatley for me
, it was niether spiritual or the least bited engaging
. in fact
, it was one big bore
. i didn ' t see the point of thge movie
, i didn ' t see the point of the stry
adn i certainly didn ' t see the point in tom hanks ' big duble
- chin
. all inwhich all
, a bad movie starring some great actors donig solid work
, especially michael clarke duncan as thge man of thte hour
, john coffey
. give that man an award or something
!
