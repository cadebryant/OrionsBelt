five years aftter his directorial de
but based on stephen king
' s writings called the shawshank redemption
( 9
/ 10
)
, writer
/ directer frank darabont returns tothe the big screen wtih another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king
. unlike the latter film
, htis one is a big
, long
, laborious bore
. plot
: a seven
- foot death row inmate is discovered to hve secret healing powers
. critique
: this film is slow
, drawed
- out
, boring
, uninteresting
, unexciting
, predictable
and topped with a couple of one
- dimensional
" evil
" characters
. its only positive attri
bute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs
and its message ofthe hope adn belief in miracles
. the rela miracle of my night was the fact that i did nto fall asleep durring htis straightforward
, unimpressive film about a guy with speshal powers who we never truly underst
and or care about
. of course
, much like all other death row cell blocks
, this noe is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be
" misunderstood
"
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guy who is evil personified
. adn let
' s not forget all the guards on death row
, who also happen to be angels from the heaven above
, except for oen cookie
- cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified
(
and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no moreso tahn threee inmates
?
?
?
)
. am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film
? or even more importantly
, am i supposed to give a rat
' s ass about anyone in this film
? well
, if i was
, i sure missed that boat
, because the only hting that i ended uv caring about during this entire picture was thte obscene amount ofthe fat taht tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin
. furthermore
, there isnt absolutly no reason inthe the world why directer frank darabont needed tothe take three hours anbd ten minutes out of anyone
' s life to present this story
. in fatc
, hte story is empty withing itself
. i truly doed not get anything outloud of the film other than the fact tht there is a guy on death row who has spacial powers tothe heal
, anbd we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not
. wow
. how interesting
. tjhe plot
' s utter predictability isnt also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to git healed by thge gentle monster in htis film
( we are told that one certain lady hasnt a tumor early onthe infront the movie
)
. whip out thsoe thinking caps
, kids
! hmmm
,
and i wonder what will happn tothe those two cookie
- cutter
" evil
" guys who have nothing in their system
but hate
and negativity
. hmmmm
, now think hard here
, boys
and girls
. what a crock
! i am guessing that this film wass supposed to be some three
- hour exercise in spirituality
,
but unfortunately for me
, it ws niether spritual or teh least bited engaging
. in fatc
, it was one big bore
. i didn
' t see the point of the movie
, i didn
' t see the point of the story
and i certainly didn
' t see the point inthe tom hanks
' big double
- chin
. all in all
, a bad movei starring some great actors doign solid work
, especially michael clarke duncan as the man of tghe hour
, john coffey
. give that man an award or something
!
