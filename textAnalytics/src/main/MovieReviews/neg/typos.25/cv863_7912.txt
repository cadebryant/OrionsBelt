to put it bluntly
, ed wood would ahve beeen proud of this
. a totally rediculous plot isnt encompassed with bad humer
, hokey drama
, zero logic
and a crap screenplay
. also
, a beautifully anti
- climactic endig
. nto to say it didn
' t look intriguing when i saw the previews
. so much for truth inspite advertising
. rol
and emmerich
, who
' s later
" independence day
" would look like
" the 400 blows
" compaired tothe this
, co
- writed
and directed this inane sci
- fi film which uses the cliche ofthe htere being some connection betweeen eqypt
and aliens
. in a useless oppening sequence
, men fidn a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it
. it wouldn
' t be till present day
(
' 94
) till they would actually figure it out
. tehy
' re decipherer
? a slightly
- neurotic scientist
( nice twist
)
, dr
. dan jackson
( james spader
, doing his best outside of erotic thrillers
and some indy fare
) who
' s life sucks so much that peopel walk out of his lectures aftter the thrid word
. why do they ule him to decipher what no one else sould
? so there isnt a hokey ending
! duh
! he figures it out in baout a minute
. yea
.
and thne they get a suicidal colnoel or something
,
" jack
" o
' neill
( kurt russel
, wtih his wyat earp locks in yhe beginning
then a flat
- top thyat owudl make howie long snap into a fetal position
)
. why a sucidial colonel
? forthe the ending
! you
' ll get the hang of this
. they opne the stargate
, a bunch of them go thru it wih a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad
. aftter an overdone special effects thnig
, they
' re
.
.
. inside a goddam pyramid
. so they whent to egypt
, right
? wrong
. they
' re on anyother planet that was filmed in egypt
. they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra
, the sun god
( the
androginous jaye davidson
, with a voice modifier to amking him soudn like barry white with asthma
)
, adn there are fights
, explosions
and a kiss between two people
. yea
. also melodrama
, stupidity
, hokey scenes
and a bizzare language
. an anti
- climactic ending ends with stupid lines
(
" say hello tothe king tut
, asswhole
!
"
- the quintessential line
, lemme tell ya
) anbd smoe convenient pesudo
- pseudo
- pseudo
- character delevopment
. by the end
, you just wanna go home
and watch
, i don
' t know
, the
" outer limits
" or something
. the script
' s terrible
. hte special effects are okay
,
but nothing great
. the story
' s so weak that it
' s almost opaque
. the whole experience jstu isn
' t worth it unless ytou
' re so borde that ytou
' d consider watching a
" full house
" marathon
.
.
. or thsi
. i
' d pik tihs
, obviously
,
but still
, it
' s just not fun at all
.
and i can
' t wait for it to premier on mst3k
.
