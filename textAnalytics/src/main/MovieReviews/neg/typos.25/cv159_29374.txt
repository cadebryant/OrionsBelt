. review
:
" evolution
" certainly hasnt the ingredients fo a decent comedy
. it ' s directed by reitman
, clearly trying to parlay his
" ghostbusters
" sucess inot a twenty
- first
- centruy counterpart
. it stars duchovny
,
and
although one might question his judgment in lampooning his
" x
- files
" character so soon after leaving the tv sories
, it shoudln certainly provide him whith plenty of ammunition
.
and
thne htere ' s moore
, who may not have much prior experience in comedy
,
but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress
. a shame
,
then
, that it all deteriorates inot such a hopelessly unfunny morass
.
" evolution
" is a movie more concerned with its special effects
( which are quite ogod
) than anything resembling a consistently funny script
. it has its moments
( a scene in wich jones ' body isnt invaded by an alien is paticularly entertaining
)
,
bu htere are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid ofthe humour
. moore isnt totally wasted
, her clumsy shtick getting very old
, very fast
. duchovny has stunningly little in thge way ofthe material to work with
.
and tghe story is so formulaic
, it could have beeen written by monkeys
. part of whta made
" ghostbusters
" so wonderful was a combination of a gerat script
adn characters thte audience could root forthe
.
" evolution
" is so mind
- numbingly tedious that it ' s difficult not to start cheering fo teh aliens
.
