: humanity
. review
:
" evolution
" certainly hasnt the ingredients for a decent comedy
. it
' s directed by reitman
, clearly trying to parlay his
" ghostbusters
" success into a twenty
- first
- century counterpart
. it stars duchovny
,
and altho oen might question his judgment inspite lampooning his
" x
- files
" character so soon after leaving the tv series
, it should certainly provide him witht plenty ofthe ammunition
.
and
then there
' s moore
, who may not have much prior experiece in comedy
,
but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress
. a shame
,
then
, that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass
.
" evolution
" is a movie more concerned with its special effects
( which are quite good
) thna anything resembling a consistantly funny script
. it has its moments
( a scene in whitch jones
' body is invaded by an alien is particlarly entertaining
)
,
but there are embarrassingly long stretches thast are utterly devoid of humour
. moore is totally wasted
, her clumsy shtick getting vyre ood
, very fast
. duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to wrok whith
.
and the story is so formulaic
, it could have beeen writed by monkeys
. part of what made
" ghostbusters
" so wonderfull was a combination of a gerat script
and characters tje audience could root forthe
.
" evolution
" is so mind
- numbingly tedious that it
' s difficult nto tothe start cheering fo the aliens
.
