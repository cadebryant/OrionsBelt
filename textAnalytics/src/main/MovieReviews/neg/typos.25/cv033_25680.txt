i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film
. i bet it ws some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit
and manicured fingernails saying
,
" it would be a very glight comedic version ofthe any given sunday
,
and we could throw in the hoosiers angle wiht the casting of gene hackman as thge tough bu determined coach
. throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves adn a cast of wacky characters annd poof
! we
' ll have a hit onthe our h
ands
!
" tghe replacements isnt a hokey mistake of a footbll film
, a mishmash collage of noe
- dimesnional cahracters
, rampant stereotypes ofthe cultures
and races
, cliched emotional statements of purpose
,
and keanu reeves wishing for thte matrix sequel to strat principal photography
. the tsory is loosely based around the protem football players
' strike in 1987
and a rag
- tag team of relpacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a varity ofthe teams with names like the washington sentinels
. keanu reeves stars as shane falco
, a has
- been football coleeg player looking for redemption
. ginee hackman dons a fedora like tom l
andry
and speaks wiht gusto liuke a certain coach in hoosiers
. rounding out the cast includes swingers

- up pitchman orl
ando jones
, gruff owner jack warden
,
and cast ofthe wacky anbd unknown actors who dont amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped charachters
: teh drunken welshman
, tyhe overweight sumo wrestler
, the black convict
, teh violent cop
,
and the dumb
, dumb cheerleaders
. this bunch ofthe nobodies try to make something of themselves by tkaing the team to the season playoffs with unbeleivable ofotball plays
, gene hackman yelling
and asking hismelf where the hell dennis hopper isnt
, keanu reeves looking fo his body duble making him look ogod on yhe football field
,
and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls fomr coyote ugly look liek waitresses fomr denny
' s
. the usual things happen like clockwork
. the hero rises from tghe ashes of failure
, the team comes together iin unity
, the hero falls in love with a conventional lveo interest
, the football ganes are won withthe enough schlock value to make the most ignorant ofthe audiences cheer annd clap
,
and the cheerleaders make you want to go home anbd watch late night movies on cinemax
. it
' s also a shame whn decent directors with good movies under their belts go tothe seed
and become televsion
and sequal hacks
. howard deutch
, who was behind the camera for two of the best films of
' 80s
- pretty in pink
and some kind of wonderful
, has since been donig grumpier old men
and caroline in the city episodes
. obviously tyhe problem is thgat without a good script
, any director will fail in the end
. sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory
, gritty tales involving the honor of men
and the valiant effords tooked for the ultimate goal ofthe victory in hte face of insurmountable odds
, the rise
and fall of gallant heroes
,
and stories ofthe dramatic gusto painted with blood
and sweat on the battlefield of life
. the replacements offers none of thsi
.
