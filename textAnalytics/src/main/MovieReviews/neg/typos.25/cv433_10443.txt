the catch phrase for disney
' s rocket man isnt one spoken by fred z
. r
andall
( harl
and williams
)
, the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes
.
" it wasn
' t me
!
" he proclaims over annd over as yhe aftermath ofthe his stupidity brings about looks of disgust ffrom the others
. well when it comes to this movie being as horrable as it is
, williams can
' t take all the blame
,
but he sure cant
' t justify himself with his own simple tag line either
. fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy
, turning the clothes dryer inot a mock space shuttle
and staring out wide
- eyed at a poster ofthe the earth
. as a 30
- year
- old
, fred hasn
' t grown uv much
, bu at least he
' s somewhat closer to his gool
, now designing astronaut software for nasa
. when an astronaut forthe an upcomming mission to mars becomes injured
, nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside
and out to fill the void
.
.
. fred
. yes
,
al
thought he
' s an obviously klutzy moron
, nasa doesn
' t think twice about throwing him into a rigorous traning programe so he can assist noe ofthe the most important events the spoace program
, adn time itself
, has ever known
. for the first part of thge film
, we watch as fred tkaes onthe thge traning program much liuke an amusement park
. he laughs
, he screams
,
but he never once breaks a sweat or views tghe preperation as anything more than child
' s play
. his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many rocord
- breaking feats
, much to the dismay of cocky counterpart
, mission comm
ander captain overbeck
( william sadler
)
, who once held the records
. overbeck will regretfully accompany fred adn two others tothe the red planet
, one being astronaut julie ford
( thge stupids
' jessica lundy
)
, anbd the other being a chimpanzee who is much mroe civilized than our antagonizing potagonist
. from here on out
, we are subjected tothe one lame gag after anohter
, dealing with snot
, laxatives
,
and flatulence
. you nkow
, st
andard kid movie material
. almsot sounding like a poore james stewart impressionist
, williams is awful in his frist starring role
. we get the feeling thgat if jerry lewis annd pee
- wee herman weere related
and produced an inbred offspring
, williams would be it
. while he
' s not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany
, stupid comedy
, he
' s just as unlikeable
. tothe say it more underst
andably
, jim carrey might annoy ytou more
,
but thsi guy isnt even less funny
. why
? because while he posesses tjhe stupidness needed to pull off such a role
, his performance is too understated annd boring
. classic comedic dunces were generaly oblivious to their own idiocy
. stan laurel
, for example
, was so innocent in all his trouble
- making that we weere immediately fond of him
. peter sellers
, as inspector clouseau
, was so self
- assured
and confident that when he did something as simple as trip
, it was humer at it
' s best
. williams
, on teh other h
and
, cin
' t garner tje pity he needs tothe make us lvoe him in all his anti
- glory
. as for the rest of thte cast
, incuding some bigger names in smaller roles
( beau bridges
and shelley duvall
)
, nobody is worth watching whatsoever
. this is just another example of yhe fast
- fod equivelant of cinema
: mass
- produced
, less than medicore
, over priced
,
and hard tothe stomach
. giving it one
- anbd
- a
- half stars is
* extemely
* generous
,
but even i
' ll admit tothe laughing a few times
. tjhe amazing thnig is that even in a theater packed wih little kids
, laughter was something rarely heared
- even from tghe childrens
! i must admit tyhat it gave me mroe respect for the kids wehn htey didn
' t crack up over every little thing
. thn agina
, mabey they were asleep
. some peopel might think criticists are harsh on kid movies
, claiming adults aren
' t the targeted audience
and therefore aren
' t meant to
,
and won
' t
, enjoy them
. sadly
, it
' s also true taht kids iwll enjoy almost anything if it
' s presented right
. a two
- hour still shot ofthe a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there
,
but would that make it as artistic as beauty
and the beast
, wich could easily do tjhe smae thing
?
and saying that a parent
' s perspective isn
' t important isnt quite a poor theory to have when they
' re tghe ones who tkae the kids to these films in the first palce
.
