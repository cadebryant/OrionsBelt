the catch phrase for disney ' s rocket man isnt one spoken by fred z
. randall
( harland williams
)
, the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes
.
" it wasn ' t me
!
" he proclaims over
and over as the aftermath ofthe his stupidity brings about looks ofthe disgust from tje others
. well when it comes tothe this movei being as horrible as it is
, williams cant ' t take all tjhe blaim
,
but he sure cxan ' t justify himself with his own simple tag line either
. fred has dreamed of space travel sicne he was a young boy
, turning the clothes dryer into a mock spoace shuttle
and staring outloud wide
- eyed at a poster of the earth
. as a 30
- year
- old
, fred hasn ' t grown up much
,
but at least he ' s somewhat closer to his goal
, now designing astronaut sofware for nasa
. when an astronaut forthe an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured
, nasa calls on the person who knows thge programming inside
anbd outloud to fill the void
.
.
. fred
. yes
,
although he ' s an obviously klutzy moron
, nasa doesn ' t thikn twice baout throwing him into a rigorous training programe so he can assist one ofthe hte most importan events the space program
,
anbd time itself
, hasnt ever known
. fo the first part of the film
, we watch as fred tkaes on the training program much liuke an amusement park
. he laughs
, he screams
,
but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preperation as anything more than child ' s play
. his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recrod
- breaking feats
, much to the dismay ofthe cocky counterpart
, mission commander captain overbeck
( william sadler
)
, who once held the records
. overbeck iwll regretfully accompany fred
and two others to the red planet
, one bieng astronaut julie ford
( the stupids ' jessica lundy
)
,
and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist
. ffrom here on out
, we are subjected tothe one lame gag after anyother
, dealing with snot
, laxatives
,
and flatulence
. you konw
, standard kid movei material
. allmost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist
, williams isnt awful in his first starring role
. we get the feeling that if jerry lewis
and pee
- wee herman were related
annd produced an inbred offspring
, williams woudl be it
. while he ' s not as annoying as other actors who cater tothe zany
, stupid comedy
, he ' s jsut as unlikeable
. tothe say it more understandably
, jim carrey might annoy you mroe
,
but this guy is even less funny
. why
? because while he possesses thte stupidness needed to pull off such a role
, his performence is too understated
and boring
. classic commedic dunces were generally oblivious to thier pwn idiocy
. stan laurel
, forthe example
, was so innocent in all his trouble
- makeing that we were immediately fond of him
. peter sellers
, as inspector clouseau
, ws so self
- assured
and confident that when he did something as simple as trip
, it wass humor at it ' s best
. williams
, on hte other hand
, cin ' t garner the pity he needs to make us love him inthe all his anti
- glory
. as for yhe rest ofthe the cast
, includng some bigger names in smaller roles
( beau bridges
and shelley duvall
)
, nobody is worth watching whatsoever
. htis is just anohter example of the fast
- food equivalent of cinema
: mass
- produced
, less than mediocre
, over priced
,
and hard to stomach
. giving it one
-
adn
- a
- half stars is
* extremely
* generous
,
but even i ' ll admit to laughing a few times
. the amazing thing isnt thgat even in a theater packed with little kids
, laughter was something rarely heard
- even from the children
! i must admitt that it gave me omre respect forthe the kids wehn htey didn ' t crack uv over every little thing
.
then again
, maybe htey were asleep
. some people might think criticists are harsh on kid movies
, claiming adults aren ' t the targeted audience
adn therefore aren ' t meant to
,
and won ' t
, enjoy them
. sadly
, it ' s aslo true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it ' s presented right
. a two
- hour still shot of a dog wtih a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there
,
bu would that mkea it as artistic as beauty
and the beast
, which could easily do the same thing
?
and saying thgat a parent ' s perspective isn ' t important isnt quite a poor theory tothe have when they ' re the ones who take tjhe kids tothe these films in yhe first place
.
