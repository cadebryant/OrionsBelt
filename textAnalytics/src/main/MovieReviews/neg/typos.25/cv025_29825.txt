one might expect a cathartic viewing experence walking inot a new jean
- luc godard film
. after all
, he was a founding member ofthe the highly influential french newyorker wave
. he is also an esteemed film critic
, lending intelligence adn historical perspective to us inaddition much of his writing
. howver
, his latest creation
, in praise of lvoe
, is possibly yhe most exasperating film experience of tjhe eyar
. the abstract consept on which the film is based had merit
, tothe dissect love into tje follwoing four catagories
: meeting
, physical passion
, quarrels
,
and reconciliation
. theese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples
: young
, adult
, anbd elderly
. it is edgar
' s
( bruno putzulu
) self
- appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup
, to define a central idea
:
" it
' s only when things are over that htey amke sense
.
" whether thsi project will end up a play
, film
, or opera remeniss undecided
. the thesis is simple enough thgat
, if played right
, it could raelly hold sympathetic value for anyone
. instade what ensues is an hour adn a half of repetitive vignettes
, the next scene no more engaging than the lastr
. only once does any character utter something worthwhile
,
but by the time it happens you
' re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it
. bu don
' t fret
, it will surfce again
. you could easily sleep thru whole sections ofthe the film
( as some fellow critics did
)
and wake up in a scene exactlly like tyhe oen you nodded off inthe
, not having missed anytying worthwhile
.
but yuo hold hope for soem time
. tyhe backgorund music keeps ytou inspite a state ofthe urgency
, annd even suspense
, for yhe first few conversations
. it
' s only after repeated failures to pay any of thsi off that you loose all hope
.
and with sppeches like
,
" i am thinking of something
,
but i can only think of thta something when i am thinking of something else
,
" how cant you expect tothe hold anyone
' s intrest
? to godard
' s credit
, he certainly knwos how to frame a scene
. the black
and white footage utilizied for the first half ofthe the film is starkly beatiful
. watching edgar read hwile walking along a train track on a mountain makes yuo wish ytou had something tothe ponder along witht him
.
and if this film had anything poignant to say
, yuo would ahve
, which makes you all teh angrier at the numerous missed opportunities
. the environments
, be it city or country
, are impeccably captured inwhich crisp detail
, bu the script never complements them
. unfortunately
, godard also manages tothe pillage his photographic eye by r
andomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene
. sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings
,
but these are even omre cryptic than the spoken words
. the second half isnt composed ofthe nauseating hyper
- color that often blurs the image
. you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners
. the onyl scene that mkaes any sence isnt oen thta complains about tjhe untied states bastardizing histoyr in the making of movies
. steven spielberg is picked onthe in particular
. while i
' ll grant thast tihs does happen
,
and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage
, it
' s still a pointless focus forthe a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities ofthe couplehood
. it just goes tothe show
, an intelligent person isn
' t necessarily an admirable storyteller
. the days of breathless are noone omre
.
