certainly noone one would rent ed wood
' s glen or glenda
? expecting to see a ogod movei
, bu this screwy discourse baout transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn
' t know was possable
. inspite fatc
, wood
' s infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparision
. watching glen or glenda
? i found myself occasionally wondering if woud had originally made two or threee spearate movies
and accidentally edited them together
; as a result
, it is actually quite intertaining in that it isnt unintentionally hillarious
. thte movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary
, with endless
, repetitive narration baout transvestites
, how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend
' s clothes wihtout being able to wear them
, how transvestites are nto necessarily homosexuals
,
and how the main character
, glen
/ glenda is
( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times
)
" nto half man
and half woman
,
but man adn woman at the same time
.
" the camera work isnt terrible
- occasionally the camera lingers onthe
, sday
, a closed door while the characters talk off
- screen
, or inexplicably zooms in on someone
' s ear or nose
. wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelavent stock footage
, which leads to voiced
- over non
- sequiturs like
,
" yes
, our world isnt a busy
and frightening place
, with so many people driving thier automobiles
.
" finally
, htere isnt occasional commentary ffrom bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems tothe inhabit a frankenstein
- style laboratory
, delivering pointless lines such as
,
" people
.
.
. all whith their pwn
thoughts
.
.
. their own idaes
.
.
.
.
" while lightning crackles quasi
- ominously overhead
. had woud continued in thsi veign
, glen or glenda
? probably woudl ahve been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with thge occasional inappropriate horror
- movie touch
. unfortunatly
, he
then w
anders so far off inot left feeld that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote teh script
.
" pull tghe string
! pull the string
!
" announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears
. ther is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns
, this timne warning us
,
" beware
.
.
. beware the big gren dragon that lurks outside your door
!
.
.
. it eats little boys
.
.
.
and puppy dogs
' tails
.
.
. adn big fat snails
!
" a bizarre nightmare sequence
, which isnt probably meant tothe be symbolic
but instade is just incredibly stupid
, ensues
, during hwihc glen
/ glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree
- in the living room
. somone who is apparently intended to be the sinister
" green dragon
"
( bu looks more liuke a klingon from the original star trek series
) appears to be orchestrating all this
,
though the film is far from clear onthe this point
( to put it kindly
)
. near the end of this scene
-
and here i must confess thast woud lost me completely
- is a voilent sexual encounter onthe a couch that features two cahracters who do not even apeared in the rest of the movei
and isnt scored by goofily upbeat folk music
. after this scene ends
( not a moment too soon
)
, glen or glenda
? returns to its documentery style
, bu at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea whta he was doing is pretty much gone
. the film w
anders to a dumb happy ending that alsot seems to ab
andon much ofthe wqat it was trying to say about transvestitism
,
but at that point it didn
' t matter much what happenned
. as soon as thge aforementioned sex scene was over
, glen or glenda
? had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as yhe most incoherent film i hadnt ever seen
. i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder adn deliberatly tried to make the worst movie i possibly could
, it still might not match glen or glenda
? for sheer cinematic disaster
. i am giving thsi movie an f
, bu i
' m not sure that quite does it justice
.
