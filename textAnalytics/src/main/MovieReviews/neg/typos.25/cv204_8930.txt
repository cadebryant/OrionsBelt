certainly noone oen would rent ed woud ' s glen or glenda
? expecting to see a good movie
,
but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn ' t know was possable
. in fact
, woud ' s infamous plan 9 ffrom outer spoace actually seems pretty tame by comparison
. watching glen or glenda
? i found myself occasionally wondering if wood hadnt originally made two or three separate movies
annd accidentally edited them toghether
; as a result
, it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious
. the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documenatry
, with endless
, repetitive narration about transvestites
, how difficult it isnt for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend ' s clothes wihtout being able to wear them
, how transvestites are nto nessasarily homosexuals
,
adn how the main charcter
, glen
/ glenda is
( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times
)
" nto half man
and half woman
,
but man
and woman at the same time
.
" tyhe camera work is terrable
- occasionally the camera lingers on
, sday
, a closed door while the characters talk off
- screen
, or inexplicably zooms in on somene ' s ear or nose
. wood also makes copious use ofthe mostly irrelevant stock footage
, which leads to voiced
- over non
- sequiturs like
,
" yes
, our world isnt a busy
and frightening place
, with so many people driving their automobiles
.
" finally
, there is occasional commentary fomr bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems tothe inhabitate a frankenstein
- sytle laboratory
, delivering pointless lines such as
,
" people
.
.
. all with their own thoughts
.
.
. their pwn ideas
.
.
.
.
" hwile lightning crackles quasi
- ominously overhead
. had wood contined in this vein
, glen or glenda
? propably would have beeen remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with tjhe occasional inappropriate horror
- movie touch
. unfortunately
, he
then wanders so far off into left field that yuo have tothe wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote tje script
.
" pull teh string
! pul tyhe string
!
" announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears
. there is another crash ofthe lightning before lugosi returns
, this timne warning us
,
" beware
.
.
. beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door
!
.
.
. it eats little boys
.
.
.
and puppy dogs ' tails
.
.
.
and big fat snails
!
" a bazare nightmare sequence
, which is probably meant to be symbolic
but instead is just incredibly stupid
, ensues
, during which glen
/ glenda finds his fiance trapped under a falled tree
- in the living room
. someone who is apparently intended tothe be the sinister
" green dragon
"
(
but looks more like a klingon fomr the original star trek series
) appears to be orchestrating all this
,
though the film is far from clera on this point
( to put it kindly
)
. near the end of this scene
-
adn here i must confess that woud lost me completely
- is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features twpo cahracters who dont not even appear in the rest of the movie
and isnt scored by goofily upbeat folk music
. after tihs scene ends
( nto a moment too soon
)
, glen or glenda
? returns to its documentary style
,
but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone
. tyhe film wanders to a dumb happy endig that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism
,
but at that point it didn ' t matter much what happened
. as soon as the aforementioned sex scene wass over
, glen or glenda
? had pretty much cemented its place iin my mind as tje most incoherent film i hadnt ever seen
. i honestly think thgat if i picked up my camcorder
and deliberately tried to amke the worst movei i possibly could
, it still might not match glen or glenda
? for sheer cinematic disaster
. i am giving this movie an f
,
but i ' m not sure that quite does it justice
.
