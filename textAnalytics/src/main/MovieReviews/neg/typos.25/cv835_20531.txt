under any other circumstances
, i would not be discusting tjhe endig ofthe a film tothe the extent that i will in this paticular review
. howver
, in order to fully explain exactly how anbd why this movie isnt so awful
, a minute dissection of the ending is necessary
. even
though i iwll not reveal the details of the lsat scenes
, dont proceed at your own risk
. the movie opens
( qutie poorly
, i might add
) as child psychologist malcolm crowe
( bruce willis
, looking like he ws dragged out of his trailer at the wee ohurs of the morning to shoot each scene
) annd his wief are intruded upon by one of malcolm
' s past patients
. distraught
, the suicidal man
( a cameo by newyorker kid onthe the block donnie wahlberg
) shoots malcolm
and
then turns the gun on himself
. cut to hte
" next fall
"
, as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case
, a trouble young man named cole
( haley joel osment
, one of yhe only child actors in a while i didn
' t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument
)
. after about 45 minutes of seamingly unrelated freak occurrences
, we learn that cole has
" the sixth sence
"
, the gitf of being able to communicate iwth the dead
. adn this
, as they say
, is where teh healing begins
. tghe sixth sence
and its unexpected popularity isnt founded apon a twist ending that i knew going into the film
( one of roger ebert
' s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of
" siskel annd ebert
"
)
.
al
though i was at firt enraged tht an established film criteak could so callously ruin a film for thous
ands of patrons
, i soon realized that htis turn ofthe events coudl iin fact have been a blessing in disguise
; i
' ve alwyas been a sucker for surprise endings
( my favorite movie is hte usual suspects
)
and rarely dislike a film thgat sports oen
. here
, since i knew teh major plot twist that wass coming at the film
' s conclusion
, the possably of bieng bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely beacuse of its ending
( something i
' ve fallen victim to inwhich thte past
) ws eleminated
. annd indeed
, my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment
. stripped of the element of suprize
, the film was put to the task of showing whta it really hadnt
, instade of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion
. after seeing its true colors
, i came to tghe conclusion that the sixth sense is
, despite what the many champions of the movie may say
, void of any real pwoer
. it
' s a neat concept
,
but not one taht justifies being made inot a feature
- length movei
. in fact
, thge sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale taht the rest of tjhe film develops as a sort of prelude tothe the supposedly earth
- shattering revelation thgat is yot to come
. anbd when the final moments do come
, it
' s a huge letdown
; hte end makes no sence at all
. it stupefied me with the heights ofthe its ineptitude
and is completely idiotic on a fundametal anbd very rare level
. i won
' t go into any details
, bu suffice to say that
, as far as i cin tell
, it negates to rest of the movei tothe such an extent taht anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention defecit disorder
. now
, inspite all fairness
, i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed thte endig
(
however stupid it may be
) had it not been revealed tothe me before h
and
. howver
, i feel veyr confident that i
, as well as anyone who had seen a few
" twilight zone
" episodes
, would have seen it coming a mile away
. the fact that movie
- goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped
. ironically
, to fully appreciate the best scene
( that of cole
and malcolm attending a little girl
' s funeral
)
, the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy
. i wouldn
' t have even known about htis mental disease if i hadn
' t
, by pure dumb luck
, caught
" dateline nbc
" the other week when they did a feature story onthe it
. despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography anbd a brauva peformance from osment
( where was tihs kid when casting calls were goign out for the phantom menace
?
)
, inthe the end
, the sixth sence is too chalk
- full of contradictions
and just isn
' t plausable anough tothe warrant even a slight recommendation
.
