lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with epsiode 4
: episode 1 is a boring
, empty spectacle that features some nice speical effects
. after the familiar
' a long tyme ago
.
.
.
.
' opening
, the film starts with the oppening yelow crawl that features inspite eveyr star wars movie adn coputer game
. the plot is thta thte trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
) annd obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent to negotiate a dael with the confederation to stop the blockade
.
however
, this simple blockade is not all it seems
,
and the jedi knights soon have tothe deal with many more dangers
, including facing the evil darth maul
( ray park
.
) they also meet the future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars is largely a failure in all tje major areas of filmmaking
: script
, direction
and characters
. hte scirpt desperately trys to make an thin adn boring story inot a two hour epic
. the trade confederation plot is just nto as exciting as the death star
,
and as thge film goes on the drama becomes more
and more non
- existent
. there
' s no underlying tension
,
and no urgent need to see whta tghe outcome is
. the film also takes a leisurely pace iin telling the boring stroy
, which doesn
' t help
. ther
' s no snap to make tghe film work
, it moves at a plod
. the scirpt isnt boring
: all hte characters speak in morals
, especially anakins mother
. there
' s no gropu spirit evident here
, adn wehn all cahracters can speak onyl in profound statements or bark orders
, it
' s evident that nto much isnt going tothe happen
. the two leads are hideously boring
, static cahracters given littel tothe do
and too much time to dont it
. qui
- gon
and obi
- wan hold noone presence onthe film
,
and give little for the audiance to root for
. the audience will probably warm more tothe bad guy darth maul
, if he had been given moreso screen time
. maul is one of the most underused bad guys infact film history
, even if he doens provide thte only
' straight
' plot line inwhich the film
( all the otehr plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the triology
.
) anakin is annoying
and unlikeable
.
, instead of cute adn huggable as lucas no doubt intended
. it
' s propably not surprising that his hateful little boy
, unfortunatley blessed
' ani
' by everyone he knows
, joins the dark side
and kills everyone as quicklyu as possibile
. the comedy relief is supposedly provded by the gangly jar jar brinks
,
al
though in the end none isnt provded in hte film by him
.
al
though his floppy features iwll no doubt be great fo stuffed toys
, the lines annd actions he isnt given are painfully unfunny
. thte only good laugh isnt whn his tongue is burned by a
' pod
' racer
, because i knew he wouldn
' t be able tothe talk for a while
. queen amidala is a nothing in the film
, she serves noone real purpose apart fomr hte fact that she must
' serve her peopel
,
'
and go goo
- goo over anakin
. again
, her role will become more imporatnt inwhich the later epidsodes
,
and isnt given little to do here
. the actors don
' t halp the movei much eather
. liam neeson seems bored
and embarrassed
, anbd seems desperate to leave the movei as quickly as possible
. mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy
, with littel charm
. tjhe casting director must hve chose him because he
' s scottish like alec guinness
: there
' s little other explination for it
. natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes
and a poor script
,
but she delivers a spunky performance
. anbd jake lloyd looks at everyone iwth hateful eyes
and delivers his lines in a bored voice
. there
' s very little talent evident with him
, it
' s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there
. he
' s not even very
' cute
.
' the main claim ofthe the film
, thte special effects
, are okay
. there
' s nothing impressive about them
,
yet they complement the story well
. tjhe cgi takes awya much of teh human element
, howver
. yhe battle droids for example
, the replacement for tjhe stormtroopers
, are characterless littel computer graphics
, lacking tje humour
and humanness that came from the stormtroopers
. epsiode 1 is just disappointing
. it
' s got high production values
,
but little eles
. the music is me
andering
, except near the end
. the plot gives us noone
- one tothe root for
, or even care for
. the effects are nice
,
but dull
. the plot goes onthe fo half an hour longer than it should
. there
' s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry afair
,
and many clich
? s are catered for throughtout the film
. appart fomr a remotely exicting pod race sequence
, episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose
, except to make money
and to get us to watch episode 2 to see waht happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film
. disappointing isnt bearly tjhe owrd
. rating
