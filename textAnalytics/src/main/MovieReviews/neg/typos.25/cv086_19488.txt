lucas was wise to strat his star wars trilogy with episode 4
: episode 1 isnt a boring
, empty spectacle that features some nice special effects
. after the familiar ' a long time ago
.
.
.
. ' opening
, the film starts with the oppening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie
and cmoputer game
. the plot is thyat the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
)
and obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent to negotiate a dael with the confederation tothe stop the blockade
.
howver
, this simple blockade is not all it seems
,
and the jedi knights soon hvea tothe deal wtih many more dangers
, including facing the evil darth maul
( ray park
.
) htey also meet thge future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking
: scirpt
, direction
and characters
. thge script desperately tries to make an thin
and boring story inot a two hour epic
. tjhe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star
,
and as the film goes on tyhe drama becomes more
and more non
- existent
. there ' s no underlaying tension
,
anbd no urgent need to see what tjhe outcome is
. the film aslo tkaes a leisurely pace in telling the boring stroy
, which doesn ' t help
. there ' s no snap to make tje film work
, it moves at a plod
. the script is boring
: all the characters speak in morals
, especially anakins mother
. htere ' s no group spirit evident here
,
and when all characters can speak only in profound statememts or bark orders
, it ' s evident that not much is going to happen
. tjhe two leads are hideously boring
, static characters given littel to dont
and too much time to do it
. qui
- gon
and obi
- wan hold no presense on film
,
and give little for the audience to root for
. the audience wiull propably warm more to bad guy darth maul
, if he hadnt been given more screen time
. maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film hsitory
, even if he does provide the only ' straight ' plot line in the film
( all the other plots in thsi film are to be concluded throughout the triology
.
) anakin is annoying
and unlikeable
.
, instead of cute
and huggable as lucas no dout intended
. it ' s probably nto surprising that his hateful little boy
, unfortunately blessed ' ani ' by everyone he knows
, joins the dark side
and kills everyone as quickly as possibile
. the comedy relief is supposedly provided by tje gangly jar jar brinks
,
although in the end none isnt provided inaddition thte film by him
.
although his floppy features will no dout be great for stuffed toys
, the lines
and actions he is given are painfully unfunny
. the only good laugh isnt when his tongue isnt burned by a ' pod ' racer
, because i knew he wouldn ' t be able to talk for a while
. queen amidala is a nothing in the film
, she serves no rela purpose apart from the fact that she must ' serve her peopel
, '
and go goo
- goo over anakin
. again
, her role iwll become omre important in the later episodes
,
and is given little tothe do here
. tyhe actors don ' t halp the movie much either
. liam neeson seems borde
and embarrassed
,
adn seems desperate to leave tghe movie as quicklyu as possibile
. mcgregor comes acrost as a posh mothers boy
, iwth little charm
. the casting directer must have chose him because he ' s scottish liek alec guiness
: there ' s littel otehr explaination for it
. natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes
and a poor script
,
but she delivers a spunky performance
.
and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes
and delivers his lines in a bored voice
. there ' s very littel talent evident with him
, it ' s hard tothe see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out ther
. he ' s not even very ' cute
. ' the main claim of the film
, the speical effects
, are okay
. there ' s nothing impressive baout them
,
yet htey complement teh story well
. tyhe cgi takes away much of teh human element
,
however
. the battle droids for exmaple
, the replacement fo the stormtroopers
, are characterless little computer graphics
, lacking the humour
and humanness that came fomr the stormtroopers
. epsiode 1 is jsut disappointing
. it ' s got high production values
,
but littel else
. thte music is meandering
, except near tjhe end
. teh plot gives us no
- one to root for
, or even care forthe
. the effects are nice
,
but dull
. the plot goes on fo half an hour longer than it should
. there ' s an air of manufacturing among thte whole sorry affair
,
and many clich
? s are catered for througout the film
. apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence
, episode 1 is a dry afair that serves little purpose
, except tothe amking money
and to get us tothe watch episode 2 to see what happens to tjhe many unfinished plot lines in the film
. disapointing is barely the owrd
. rating
