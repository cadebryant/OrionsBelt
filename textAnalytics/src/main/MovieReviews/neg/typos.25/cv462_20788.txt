in duble jeapardy
, thte stakes are high
. think of the plot as a rehash ofthe sleeping with the enemy
, adn
then rearrange the details
and the gender of tje stalker
. the finished product
,
al
though able to maintain the viewer
' s attention
, is a predictable
and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script

' libby parsons
( ashley judd
) isnt a happily married mom leading a normal life
. noe night
, her husb
and nick
( bruce greenwood
) tkaes her out for a romantic excape on a sailboat
. libby awakens in the middle ofthe hte night to find she is covered infact blood
and nick has strangely disappeared
. she follows a trail ofthe bloody footprints up to the deck
, where she h
andles a fallen nife
( like any stupid character
) anbd is spotted by the coast guard
, who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in thge evening
. nick isnt presumed dead
,
and
al
though she pleads her innosense
, libby is tryed
and convicted for the murder of her husban
. nowe
, please don
' t think i
' m spoiling any vital plot details
, because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans
. if you haven
' t seen this preview
, don
' t read any furhter
.
but seriously
, the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg anbd douglas s
. cook is so elimentary thta the average viewer will be two or threee steps ahead of teh characters
. during tjhe most vital scenes in the movei
, i was anticipating every twist or
` surprise
' tyhat eventially popped up on the screen
. i imagine the writers presume their core audeince for double jeapardy is a vyre naieve group of individuals
. most
, unfortunately
, will be too distracted by the moronic plot to apprieciate the few positive aspects of the production
. one is tommy lee jones
, who plays travis lehman
, a parole officer given the tedeous task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison
. jones is always wonderful as an authority figure
,
and he
' s certainly familiar with this sort ofthe role
( as he played so well in the fugitive
and us marshals
)
. judd
, as a likable heroin wtih gusto
, also has a chance tothe flex her acting abilities
. hwile emotionally unconvincing
, the actress isnt tremendously funn in her juvenile role
, perking up the movei like an injection ofthe anti
- depressant
. hte actors
,
and their relatiopnship together
, present thte one
- two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely
.
and now
, back to tjhe plot
. while behind bars
, libby learns an interesting littel bit of information
: a person can
' t be convicted of the smae crime twice
. htis law
, called
` double jeopardy
'
, could be her motive fo hunting down her husb
and
.
.
. who may still be alive
. yes
, yuo heard right
. thte movei degenerates inot a cross
- country chase
, where everything you expect tothe ahppen
.
.
. doens
. teh final scenes
, which could have redeemed the film
, are poorly h
andeled by director bruce beresford
- whose previvous work centers highly arround drama
( driving miss daisy
, paradime road
)
. ironically
, it is those elements
- like the driving force ofthe libby to reunite withthe her son
- that don
' t quite work here
. at least double jeopardy is paced well enought to satisfy diehard fans ofthe the two stars
. unfourtunately
, jones lacks some ofthe the edge that he hadnt as sam gerard in thge fugitive
,
and tyhe rela depth of his character isnt onyl skin deep
.
but he
and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material
,
and both have smoe memorable comic moments
. judd
, in particualr
, has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaning she has tothe check in with her
` parole officer
'
. hmmm
.
.
. perhaps this woudl have made a good comedy
. it is disapointing
, because there are the makings of a competent action film here
. it
' s nicely shot annd choreographed in downtown vancouver
,
and will entertain those who aren
' t turned off by tjhe woeful story
- line
.
? tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn
' t fool most children
.
