. tjhe millenium approachs
. an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city
. sectors ofthe the city are bieng sealed
, quarantined due tothe the onset ofthe a mysterious virus
. the virus causes people to act like insects
: tehy crawl about onthe all fours
, hide ffrom bright lights
, huddle in damp corners
. the water supply tothe the quarantined zones will be cutted off in a week
' s time
. recidents are adviced to evacuate the area
, asap
. this premise
-
- kafka by way of cronenberg
-
- is the background for the hole
, which could have been a gerat movei
,
but
, sadly
, ends up as a waste of good ideas
. thge quick sketch above suggests a dark
, absurd
, hallucinatory near
- future parable of life in the lite 20th centruy
; in execution
, howver
, it is nothing like that
. the virus
, the evacuation
, the visual possiblities of the deluge
: theese are all relagated to the background
. instead
, the hole focuses onthe the lives
-
- for want of a better word
-
- of a man
( lee kang
- sheng
)
and a woman
( yang kuei
- mei
) who live inwhich the smae apartment building
,
and who have noone personalities
. tjhe entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugli annd sterile
: the charmless rooms adn corridors of a post
- industrial apartment complex
, photographed to look as dim
and dingy as possibile
. it
' s a vivid setting
, bu an unappealing one
, especially with thge monotonous hiss ofthe falling rain
and hte gurgle of drainage pipes in tje backgorund
. the man lives in the apartment driectly above thge woman
' s
. noe day
, a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in teh floor ofthe thte man
' s living room
, opening into the ceiling of the woman
' s living room
. this hole
-
- symbol ofthe the solatary opening in the charachter
' s lonely
, compartmented lives
-
- allows them to interact in unusual
( annd mostly non
- verbal
) ways
. example
: the man
, suffering from the onset ofthe the virus
( or so i assume
-
- everyting is obscure in this movie
) vomits through the hole
. tje woman
, w
andering around inaddition the dark
, accidentally puts her h
and on his vomit
,
and
then cleans it up
. this is what passes for meaningful communciation
.
and tehy sday romance is dead
. much of the film does not even focus onthe their interactions
, such as they are
. there is almost no dialogue
and we leran next to nothing baout these people
. they are ciphers
. instead
, we are treated to long tkaes in which we wittness their miserable lives
; we watch
, for instance
, as the woman boils soem water
, pours it onto some noodles
,
then eats thge noodles
.
( this is as fascinating as it sounds
.
) offered as counterpoint
-
- or perhaps relief
-
- to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers
, fantasies inthe which the woman lip
- synchs to pop songs by grace chan
( popular
, so i
' m told
, in 1950s
' china
)
. she prances arund in grimy hallways
and grungy stairwells
, incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights
. sometimes
, in these fantasies
, she is joined by the man
. theese scenes are presumably intended to be bright
and fanciful
, sharply contrasting tyhe dreariness of reality
,
but they fail
. when the man
and the woman dance
, it seems half
- hearted
and listless
. astaire
and rogers this is nto
. even in imagination
, theese people are numb
, weary
, boring
. the hole is part of the
' collection 2000
' series
, a gropu of films commissioned by french tv staion la sept arte on the subject of the millenium
. others include canada
' s last night
, brazil
' s midnight
, annd american hal hartley
' s the book of life
. the book of life isnt the only other one that i have seen
,
and it isnt infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry
. witty
, energetic
, humane
, it mkaes the the hole seem
( ahem
) empty
. american movies with nothing tothe say try tothe disguise thier lack ofthe content with flashy movements
, quick cuts
, superficial emotions
. foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does
: htey point tyhe camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of tyme
,
and call it art
. the hole is self
- evidentally a film about alienation
,
and perhaps director tsai ming
- liang wants tje audience tothe share in his characters
' alienation
. if so
, he succeds
. perhaps it is a challenge
: he dares us to enjoy this movie
, despite his best attempts to ensure that we don
' t
. if it was a challenge
, i wasn
' t up for it
.
