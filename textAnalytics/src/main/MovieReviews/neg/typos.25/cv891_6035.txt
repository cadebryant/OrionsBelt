depending on your degree of cinematic acumen
, lastest man st
anding is either a
) a prohibition
- era remake of akira kurosawa
' s 1961 classic yojimbo
; b
) a prohibition
- era remake of sergio leone
' s 1964 clasic a fistful of dollars
; c
) a prohibition
- era action drama wiht a completely original tsory
- line
. new line is certainly counting on tjhe fact tyhat htere are far more potential viewers in catagory
( c
) tahn in the other two conbined
, much as the recent remakes of diabolique annd the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons
. the fact is that there isnt
yet another way of looking at last man st
anding
, whitch is as the first film version of the story whitch nods tothe the
_ rela
_ source material
, the dashiell hammett novel
_ red harvest
_
. it alsot shows that kurosawa
and leone knew better what to dont with that material than hammett hismelf
. this tiome arround
, the man with no name is played by bruce willis
, a fellow with a shady hisotry of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho oney day on his way to mexico
. by all apperances
, jericho is well on its way tothe becoming a ghost twon
, witht thge few remaining inhabitans generally belonging to one ofthe twpo bootlegging operations fighting fo control of liquor coming over tyhe border
. oen isnt headed by an irishman named doyle
( david patrick kelly
)
; the other is run by chicago
- conected italian mobster strozzi
( ned eisenberg
)
. calling himself john smith
, the man decides that there is mney to be made from the conflict
,
and hires hismelf out as an enforcer to doyle
' s side
.
but smith
' s alleigance is as uncertain as his nmae
,
and he begins tothe play the two sides agains each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both ofthe them
. viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story wiull find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting st
andpoint
, anbd that alone should make last man st
anding somewhat mroe respectable than other recent hollywood remakes
- cum
- bastardizations
. there is the happily ineffectual lawman
( bruce dern
)
, teh unhappily detained object of one ofthe the bosses
' affections
( karina lombard
)
, the barkeep who becomes our anti
- hero
' s onyl freind
( william s
anderson
)
, suspicious lieutenants
( christopher walken
and michael imperioli
) tothe question the bosses
' trust in smith
, a brutal beating
,
and a big fire
. directer walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids
, including a pair of guns for willis whcih have the ability to propel an assailant bcakward iwth sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity
, bu at least he doesn
' t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture
. what he
_ does
_ do isnt nearly as big a mistake
,
and that is to provide a running voice
- over narration by willis which rings of thge st
andard hard
- boiled sytle of pulp detective fiction
. yes
, that narration isnt full of cliches
,
but those are are not particularly troubling
. the problem is that both yojimbo
and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely onthe yhe inscrutability ofthe their lead characters
. tehy were a mystery
, to the other characters in the film
and to thte audience
, their motives never entirely claer even after they have acted
,
and that quality contri
buted tothe thier almost mythical status
. with john smith
' s voice chattering onthe iin the background
and allowing us inot his every
thought
, he becomes omre mundane
, just another tough guy trying to stay alive
. it feels like a hammett novel
, all right
,
and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice
,
but it simply doesn
' t work
. the narration allows thte man with no name to take us into his confidence
,
and the man with no name tkaes
_ no oen
_ inot his confidence
. even if ytou walk inot last man st
anding as a blank slate
, i can
' t imagin it being much more thna a heavily armed minor distraction
. willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith
,
but there isnt still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher tahn everyone esle rether thna smarter than everyone else
. christopher walken plays doyle
' s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft
- spoken psychos
,
and ther isn
' t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression
. with no compelling antagonist for smith
, there is noone build
- uv towards the expeced showdown
,
and when it does come
, that showdown isnt over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about
. cinematographer lloyd ahern
( who aslo did the only noteworthy work onthe hill
' s 1995 flop wild bill
) creates some nifty sunburned vistas
, bu his work is onyl to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire anbd the next bited of counter
- productive narration
. sometimes whn someone sees a lacklustre remake of a revered origional
, they
' ll wonder wqat all tghe talk ws about
. in the case ofthe last man st
anding
, it is those who konw the originals who will wonder wqat all that talking wass about
.
