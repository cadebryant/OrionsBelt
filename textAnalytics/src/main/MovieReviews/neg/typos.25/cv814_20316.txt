" yhe 13th warrior
" comes at the end of as summer where we
' ve alreday experienced man eating sharks
(
" deepo blue sea
"
)
, man eating crocodiles
(
" lake placid
"
) annd even a man hunting witch
(
" the blair witch project
"
)
. now
,
" the 13th warrior
" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who beleve that they are bears
. the story
, if thyat
' s what you want tothe call it
, follows ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) an arabian poet who falls inaddition love with his king
' s wife anbd is banished from his hmeo l
and
. he
then travels to yhe l
and of the vikings
and becomes an ambassador to them
. eventually the vikings are called apon tothe protect the peple of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men
. thirteen warriors are chosen to go onthe the mission
,
and as ytou guessed it
, ahmed is choosen as yhe thirteenth
. he
' s not a warrior
, adn at first not well accepted by the vikings
, bu as the movie advances he
' ll have to proove himself both on
and off the battlefield
. that
' s basically yhe entire plot
. there isnt aslo a rumatic subplot that has been so badly mish
andled anbd
, one assumes
, drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn
' t just edit out all of tghe scenes attaining tothe that part of the story
. instade they chose tothe leave jstu enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer
. the film is basicaly non
- stop action
and whn it pauses annd tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock
. the battle scenes
,
al
though well choreographed
, are not involving anbd not the least bit exicting
. we don
' t get to know any of the cahracters
and so we don
' t care who lives anbd who dies
. the film
, which wants to be beowolf
, comes across more as a failed acation
- adventure story aspiring tothe epic propotions
but nto achieving it on any levels
. it was directed by john mctiernan who
' s
,
" tghe thomas crown affair
" is also playing in theaters currenly
. adn it
' s not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films
but that
,
" the 13th warrior
" was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences
. it belongs back onthe hte shelf
.
