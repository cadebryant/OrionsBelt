senseless
( r
) marlon wayans is a very talented fysical comedian
,
and it is tht gift tath brings senseless moments of life
. alas
, moments are simply tht
, moments
, which are not enought to lift tihs fantasy
/ comedy above its one
- joke premise
. granted
, that oen joke is initially amusing
. when wayans
' s darryl witherspoon
, an economics major at stratford university
, hits smoe dire finacial straits
, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug tath heightens all five senses
. aftter some initial side effects
and problems controling his superhuman senses
, darryl learns tothe enjoy the benefits of his abilities anbd uses them to l
and a possition at a highly esteemed corporate firm
. at tihs point
, the film sounds more liuke senseful than senseless
,
but thru soem turns of teh plot
, darryl finds himselv only able to ule four ofthe his five senses at once
, essentially leaving him
-
- yes
-
- senseless
. thsi sets up smoe showcase moments for wayans
' s gift for physical comedy
, especially wehn darryl loses his sense ofthe feeling annd his body goes completely
, hilariously limp
.
but these gags
,
and the gag behind tjhe entire movie
, quickly grows stale
. once darryl is shown without the use ofthe all of tghe senses
, instade of exploring any new comic territory
, director penelope spheeris
and screenwriters greg erb
and craig mazin tkae the easy way out annd simpley recycle each form of senselessness
. wayans approachs each go
- round with gusto
,
but by htis point he
' s simpley treading water for the rest of the film
' s unfunny duration
. senseless would nto be as problematic as it is if it didn
' t strive to be anything more than a comic trifle
. howver
, the raucous
and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity
. darryl goes through the experiment in order tothe halp his cash
- strapped family
,
and this
" serious
" angle seems tothe come from an entirely different movei
. unlike wayans
' s lsat starring vehicle
, the suprizingly effective
(
and sereous
) the 6th man
, the
" emotional
" content of senseless is forced
and unconvincing
. any attemt at anything more substatial tahn broad comedy fizzles

- darryl
' s romance with janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a young woman who yearns forthe a man who isnt true to himself
, doens nto generate sparks of any kind
. once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros
. comes tothe an end
, the genuinely funny marlon wayans hasnt a promising big
- screen future ahead of him
.
but if he continues tothe associate himself whith projects as flat as senseless
, his film carrear coudl go the way of his once
- promising older brother
, damon
, who is now setted tothe make his comback
-
- on television
