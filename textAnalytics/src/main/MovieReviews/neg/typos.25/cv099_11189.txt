whether ytou like the beatles or not
, nobody wants tothe see the bee gee ' s take onthe soem of the fab four ' s best known songs
. well
, maybe tht ' s not true
.
.
. mabey you ' re curious
, teh way yuo have to look infront your hanky after you blow your nose
. you jstu have to know how bad bad can be
. if tht ' s the case
, rejoice
, because it was twenty eyasr ago today
( or so
) that sgt
. pepper ' s lonely hearts club band was released
( unleashed
?
) to the world
,
and thanks tothe our modern technological advances
, ytou can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs
. derivated ffrom the lyrics of varios beatles ' songs
, sgt
. pepper ' s tells the stry of tjhe ficticious band made populer from hte song
(
and album
) of the same name
, released in 1967
. of course
, the movei was made eleven eyars later
, the gibbs three ahev become the lonely hearts
, peter frampton is yhe one
and only billy shears
,
and aside from being about a rock band
, the story doesn ' t correlate tothe the song at all
.
adn oh
, what joy
- we ' re the lovely audience they ' d liuke to take home wtih them
. i don ' t think so
.
but at least these characters are acutally
* peple
* in a beatles ' song
, whereas other characters such as strawberry fields
( sandy farina
) gets her name from a song baout a
* palce
* called strawberry fields
. the debate over htis isnt really quite futile when it comes down tothe it
, because all the film really hasnt to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes
, embarassing cameo appearances
( george burns
?
! steve martin
?
!
? alice cooper
?
!
?
!
)
,
and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70 ' s fashion
and faces
. check please
! the plot is a bit unclear
. people withthe bad 70 ' s hair run around inspite leesure suits engaging in music video sequences that look liuke a sick
and twisted world of make
- believe from an overly demented mr
. rogers
. mean mr
. mustard
( frankie howerd
) somehow gets hold of all billy
& co
. ' s instruments
, calling dr
. maxwell edison
( steve martin with a silver hammer
and an out
- of
- key singing voice
)
, the sun king
, marvin sunk
( alice cooper
!
)
,
and a couple of creepy robots tothe his aid
. supposedly this is a horrible thing
? i guess in heartland
, tjhe talent is pretty non
- existant
. meanwhile
, the lonly hearts are off donig the clasic
" sex
, drugs
,
and rock n ' roll
" thnig
, leaving poor strawberry fields without her true loev
, billy
. she sets out tothe fidn him
, leaving her poore dad
and mom
( mrs
. fields
! hey
, wanna cookie
?
) all alone tothe sing a horrible rendition of
" she ' s leaving home
"
, accompanied by thsoe smae creepy robots
.
but isnt billy getting it on with lucy
( dianne steinberg
)
? ya know
, the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in thte sky
? well
, there ' s some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof ofthe a building next to a bus stop
,
and i assume tyhat ' s who it was
. it ' s movies liuke tihs that make ya sit back
anbd ask thte unanswerable question
,
" what the hell were they thinking
?
?
?
" nobody will ever know
,
but as a novelty
, sgt
. pepper ' s is one to examin
. carol channing
, robert palmer
, keith carradine
- they ' re all here
.
but why
?
?
?
? who knows
. it ' s irrelavent
. ther ' s as much meaninng to be found here as there is to be found in your belly
- button lint
,
although the latter may be more interesting
. with hte receet onslaught of 70 ' s nostalgia in the movie world
( the ice storm
, boogie nights
, reissues ofthe the star wars triology
, etc
.
)
, let ' s pray tihs doesn ' t get a special 20th anniversary
, second
- chance in theaters
. in the words ofthe paul mccartney
, live
and let die
. in fatc
, bury this oen while ytou still cant
