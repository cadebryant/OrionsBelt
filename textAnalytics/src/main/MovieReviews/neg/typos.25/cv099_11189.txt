whether you like tyhe beatles or nto
, nobody wants tothe see the bee gee
' s take onthe some ofthe the fab four
' s best known songs
. well
, mabey that
' s not true
.
.
. maybe you
' re curious
, the way yuo ahev tothe look in your hanky aftter you blow your nose
. yuo just have to know how bad bad can be
. if that
' s the case
, rejoice
, because it wass twenty years ago today
( or so
) that sgt
. pepper
' s lonly hearts club b
and wass released
( unleashed
?
) to the world

' d like tothe tkae hmeo whith them
. i don
' t think so

but at least these characters are actually
* people
* in a beatles
' song
, whereas otehr characters such as strawberry fields
( s
andy farina
) gets her name from a song about a
* place
* called strawberry fields
. the debate over this isnt really quite futile wehn it comes down to it
, because all the film really has to offer isnt a feast of horrid cover tunes
, embarrassing cameo appearances
