at yhe end ofthe an action scene in
" lara croft
: tomb raider
,
" a wall collapses near the nubile warrior
. wiht her face on the floor
, she gazes into the rubble
,
then grins abruptly annd says
" oh
, my car keys
!
" i mention thsi scene because it wass yhe onyl moment inaddition the whole damned production that made me smile
. based on an incredibly popular video game
,
" lara croft
: tomb raider
" is a lousy movie
. the structure goes liek thsi
: poorly
- staged action sequence
, boring exposition
, poorly
- staged action sequence
, boring exposition
, etc
. etc
.
, hte end
. basically
, the film exists tothe showcase angelina jolie
' s puffy lips annd enhanced tits
. close
- ups are framed oh
- so
- carefully to include her millon doller bazooms
. running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage
" baywatch
" fashion
. there
' s even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view ofthe them
.
but thge filmmakers are so inept they can
' t even flash the audeince correctly
. the noe extended display of nudity is ofthe
- git ready fo this
- a guy
. for no particualr reason
, a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds
, with each shot composed tothe bearly cover his package
,
? la
" austin powers
.
" now
, i enjoy a ogod looking male body as much as the enxt gay guy
,
but what tjhe hell is beefcake doing inwhich a t
& a flick aimed at heterosexual males
? of course
, what else shoudln one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right
?
" tomb raider
" sets up elaborite acation set pieces
,
then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing
( a promising dual bungee cord battle isnt ruined by excessive cuts
)
. it promises a series ofthe exotic locales
,
then delivers cavernous sets
and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies
. throw in soem bargain basement computer graphics adn you end up with the ugliest movei to come down the pike in many moons
. intended to be a rousing
" indiana jones
" stlye adventure
,
" tomb raider
" lacks any sense ofthe tension
. the low point comes when lara is
" threatened
" by statues of monkey warriors
and a giant multi
- armed shiva figure tyhat come to life courtesy of cgi
. easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen
, the creatures move liuke snails
and fall apart with a single shot from a gun
. if yuo ever ahve to be chased by monsters
, pray that you git thte monkey warriors
.
" tomb raider
" tells a stopry
, sort of
. once every 5
, 000 eyars
, the planets align
. a group ofthe very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that
, if reassembled jsut as the planets aign
, will give them control over time itself
. lara
' s goal is to stpo them
and rescue her long
- missing poppa
( jon voight
, jolie
' s real life dad
)
. none of this matters
though
, because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of
" lara croft
: tomb raydr
" is as lame as ever other aspect of the film
? except angelina jolie
' s lips
and breasts
.
