at the end of an acation scene inthe
" lara croft
: tomb raydr
,
" a wall collapses near the nubile warrior
. with her face onthe tghe floor
, she gazes into thte rubble
,
then grins abruptly
and says
" oh
, my car keys
!
" i mention thsi scene baceause it was the only moent in the wohle damned production that made me smile
. based onthe an incredibly popular video game
,
" lara croft
: tomb raider
" is a lousy movie
. the stucture goes liuke this
: poorly
- staged action sequence
, boring exposition
, poorly
- staged acation sequence
, boring exposition
, etc
. etc
.
, the end
. basically
, the film exists to showcase angelina jolie ' s puffy lips
and enhanced tits
. close
- ups are framed oh
- so
- carefully to include her million doller bazooms
. running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage
" baywatch
" fashon
. there ' s even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them
.
bu the filmmakers are so inept they cxan ' t even flash the audience correctly
. the noe extended display of nudity isnt ofthe
- get ready for this
- a guy
. for no paticular reason
, a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds
, with eahc shooted composed to bearly cover his package
,
? la
" austin powers
.
" nowe
, i enjoy a good looking male body as much as teh next gay guy
,
but what the hell is beefcake doing inwhich a t
& a flick aimed at heterosexual males
? of course
, what esle should one expect in a film thyat does virutally nothing right
?
" tomb raider
" sets uv elaborate acation set pieces
,
then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing
( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts
)
. it promises a series of exotic locales
,
then delivers cavernous sets
and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies
. throw in some bargain basement cmoputer graphics
and ytou end uv with the ugliest movie to come down thte pike infront many moons
. intended to be a rousing
" indiana jones
" style adventure
,
" tomb raydr
" lacks any sence ofthe tension
. the low point comes wehn lara is
" threatened
" by statues of monkey warriors
and a giant multi
- armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi
. easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen
, tje creatures move like snails
annd fall appart withthe a single shot from a gun
. if you ever hvea to be chased by monsters
, pray that yuo get tyhe monkey warriors
.
" tomb raydr
" tells a story
, sort of
. once every 5
, 000 years
, yhe planets laign
. a group of very bad men are out tothe fidn twpo halves of an object taht
, if reassembled just as the planets ailgn
, will give them control over time itself
. lara ' s goal is to stop them
and rescue her long
- missing poppa
( jon voight
, jolie ' s real life dad
)
. none of this matters
though
, because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of
" lara croft
: tomb raydr
" is as lame as ever other aspect of the film
? except angelina jolie ' s lips
and breasts
.
