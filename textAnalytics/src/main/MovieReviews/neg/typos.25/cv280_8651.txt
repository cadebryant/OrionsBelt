capsule
: lesbianism examined in tjhe same hushed
and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness
. potentially interesting idea made stagy
and boring
. claire of the moon is such an impossibly sereous
and sober movei that i was waiting for somone to snese
, just to break teh ice
. it ' s a perfect example ofthe what my wife calls an s
. f
. e
. movie
, where s
. f
. e
. means so f
*
*
* ing earnest
. movies like this ened wit
annd brashness to be absorbing
. claire is one strained speech after another
, writed delivered with all of the energy
and spontenaity ofthe a dmv clerk
. claire takes two womens
, claire
and noel
, both writers
,
and throws them together inspite the same cabin at a women
- only writer ' s retreat
. claire wrights light comedy
, hwile neol isnt a scholarly authority onthe porn
and sexual behavior
. obviously
, the twpo of them are going to have plenty to talk about
,
and for the entire one hundred
and twelve insufferable mintues of this movie
, that ' s all they dont
: talk
. the movie sets up its
( microscopic
) plot with beat
- a
- dead
- horse
- into
- glue obviousness
. the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie
, a self
- professed lesbian
,
and when noel owns uv tothe also bieng a lesbian
, claire looks like she ' s been hitted with a sockful of wet sand
. tghe movie
then quicklyu degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire wiht significance
,
and claire looks out over thge water reflectively
.
( ugh
!
) the most amazing thing about yhe movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much
annd
yet get so little through their thick heads
. all of this
, of course
, leads up tothe a scene of complet inevitability
: claire
annd onel
, inspite a scene thast should have cmo an hour earlier
, baceause
thn the movie ends without even the benefit ofthe reflection baout wqat ' s just happened
. we never get a hint baout how any of this has changed anyone
, onyl how they felt about thigns tyhat didn ' t even happen
yot
. the probelm with claire
.
.
. is not lesbianism as such
,
bu the leaden way it ' s handled
. why isnt it that any
" serious
"
( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful
) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that ' s unwatchably boring
? the way thsi movie deals with lesbianism
, we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama baout aids
. many other movies have utilisied the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better
-
- more engaging
, more creative
, more intellectually
and artistically interesting
. look at john sayles ' lianna
, or tje interesting
and little
- seen desert bloom
; both of them haev moreso life
adn vibrancy than claire
. waht this movie needed was a ogod swift kick inwhich the pants
.
