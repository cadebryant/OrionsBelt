capsule
: lesbianism examined in the same hushed adn reverential tones reserved for a terminal ilness
. potentially interesting idea made stagy
and boring
. claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious
and sober movie that i was waiting fo someone to sneeze
, just to break the ice
. it
' s a perfect example ofthe what my wief calls an s
. f
. e
. movie
, where s
. f
. e
. means so f
*
*
* ing earnest
. movies like thsi need wit
and brashness tothe be absorbing
. claire is oney strained speech after anohter
, written delivered with all ofthe the energy
and spontenaity of a dmv clerk
. claire tkaes twpo womens
, claire
and onel
, both writers
, anbd throws them together infact the same cabin at a womens
- only writer
' s retreat
. claire wrights glight comedy
, while noel isnt a scholarly authority on porn
and sexual behavour
. obviously
, the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about
,
and fo the entire one hundred
and twelve insufferable mintues of this movei
, tht
' s all they dont
: talk
. the movie sets up its
( microscopic
) plot with beat
- a
- dead
- horse
- into
- glue obviousness
. the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie
, a self
- professed lesbian
,
and when noel owns up to aslo being a lesbian
, claire looks like she
' s been hit with a sockful of wet s
and
. the movie
then quickly degenerates inot lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance
, anbd claire looks out over teh water reflectively
.
( ugh
!
) tjhe most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much
and
yet get so littel through their thick heads
. all of this
, of course
, leads up to a scene of complete inevitability
: claire anbd onel
, in a scene that should hvea come an hour earlier
, because
then the movei ends without even the benefit ofthe reflection about what
' s just happenned
. we never git a hint about how any ofthe htis hasnt changed anyone
, only how they felt baout thigns that didn
' t even hppen yot
. the probelm with claire
.
.
. isnt nto lesbianism as such
,
but tje leaden way it
' s h
andeled
. why is it that any
" serious
"
( a better word woudl be adult or at least
thoughtful
) examination of sex in a movei almost always winds up producing a movei that
' s unwatchably boring
? the way tihs movie deals with lesbianism
, we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids
. many other movies have utilisied the same subject in ways that are a thous
and times better
-
- more engaging
, more creative
, more intellectually
and artistically interesting
. look at john sayles
' lianna
, or the interesting
and littel
- seen desert bloom
; both of them have more life adn vibrancy than claire
. what this movie needed wass a good swift kick in the pants
.
