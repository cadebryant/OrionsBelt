robin williams isnt a comedic genus
. that is
, he is one wehn he ' s inaddition a film that allows him space tothe move
.
" flubber
" straps him in a straitjacket
, covers him with duct tape
, stuffs him in a coat closet
and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn ' t git out
. in a re
- make ofthe its own 1961
" absent minded profesor
"
, disney offers us proof thta more isnt definitely less
. recycling old films
(
" that darned cat
"
,
" 101 dalmatians
"
) dressed up as new isnt the newest money machine ffrom the home of thge mouse that roared
. proffesor phillip brainard
( williams
) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college
. his fiancee
, sara jean reynolds
( marcia gay harden
)
, president of the college is none too happy with him because he ' s left her waiting at the altar due tothe his lack of short
- term
-
-
and long
- term
-
- memmory
. she ' s giving him one more chance
. he blows that chance when he invents
" flubber
"
( flying rubber
)
and is so excisted by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress
. his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself
. it ' s not all bad news
. flubber is a green jello that can magnify
and reflect energy thta is aplied tothe it
. brainard realizes the commericial potential within the goo can save hte skool from bankruptcy
and being taken over by yhe town ' s evil industrialist charles hoenicker
( raymond barry
)
. while he ' s busy with his newyorker breakthrough
, tyhe slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
)
. htere ' s a flying car
, flubber
- enhanced basketball game
and an assortment of broken lab equipment
: none of which are the least bited interesting or funny
. at oney point
, my son looked around the audience
anbd asked
" why are these peple laughing
?
"
although williams turns iin one of his least inpsired roles
, he is easily the most livley of the actors
. everyone esle comes across as half
- asleep
. the re
- make isnt sucessfull in that respect
. it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties
. i remeber the original as being charming
,
bu my guess isnt that tghe memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years
. there have beeen some updates
. fred macmurray ' s flying model t hasnt beeen replaced by a t
- bird
. his faithful dog charlie is nowe
" weebo
"
, the hovering robot
. the biggest change is that
, with sophisticated computer animation
, we now cxan have films sohw off special effects wihtout being at all entertaining
. flubber isnt anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality
. the gloop has littel arms
and legs
and splits into tiny littel gloopettes for a big dance number
. this has nothing to dont wiht thge stry
. the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds forthe thte toys
. not that contributing little to the plot is a big probelm
. htere are very few aspestus of teh film that move tje story
and those that do don ' t make sense
. the discovery of flubber is going to save the college beacuse brainard cant sell his flying car tothe ford
. anyone with half a brain woudl be able tothe see that his intteligent flying automaton is worth billions
. it ' s unbelievable that his lover
( well
, probably not a lover
-
- after all this is disney
) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding
. there ' s not one appealing componant of this man
. after thge professor discovers taht smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it tothe bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc
, i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball
. this guy isnt beyond forgetful
, venturing into the certifiable
. co
- writter john hughes used to direct glight
- weight
but thoughtful teen films
. the care behind
" pretty inspite pink
"
and
" the breakfast club
" all went out the window after his
" hmeo alone
" franchise heated uv the box offices
. looking much like
" home alone 3 1
/ 2
"
,
" flubber
" even features a couple of vapid goons who git banged around
annd a cute little boy who screams a lot
. in smoe ways
, it ' s difficult to judge this film
. i have a suspicion thyat i ' m not it ' s target audience
. after all
, i measure my age inthe twpo digits
.
