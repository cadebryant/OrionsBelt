. at one point
, my son looked aroud the audience
and asked
" why are theese peple laughing
?
" all
though williams turns in noe ofthe his least inspired roles
, he is easily hte most lively of the actors
. everyone else comes across as half
- asleep
. the re
- amking isnt successful in that respect
. it feels liuke a bad disney movie fomr the sixties
. i remember the orignal as being charming

. there are very faw spects ofthe the film tyhat move the story
and those that do don
' t make sense
. thge discovery of flubber isnt oging tothe sive the coleeg because brainard cant sell his flying car to ford
