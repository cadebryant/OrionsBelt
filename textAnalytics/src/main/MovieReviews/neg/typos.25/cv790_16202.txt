amercia
' s favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wief in
" bride ofthe chucky
,
"
and thier unholy matrimony is something old
, nothing new
. the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers
,
however
, hasnt nothing tothe do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up
,
but rether whether or not the duo gets down
and dirty on their blood
- soaked honeymoon
. the answer is a sick
- anbd
- twisted yes
-
and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot
- enough
- to
- melt
- rubber
( or at least singe it
) lovin
'
. guess they
' re anatomically correct
. chucky
( again voiced by brad dourif
)
, of course
, is the star ofthe the
" child
' s play
" series
, a my buddy
- type doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer
. in
" bride
,
" tje plot
( heh
) picks uv with his girlfriend tiffany
( jennifer tilly
) resurrecting chucky
' s remains
( he was blown up at the end of
" child
' s play 3
"
) with the halp ofthe a black arts manual called
" voodoo forthe dummies
.
" silly mortal
. befor long
, she
' s also beeen reduced to shin
- high figurine status
,
and tghe plastic incarnations of these noe
- time lunatic lovebirds hit tghe road to scope out some potential new human bodies
. the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff
and the chuckster stalk a young couple
( nick stabile
and katherine heigl
) with conjugal plans of their own
, leading them towards a new jersey grav where a magical
, soul
- transferring amulet allegedely lies in wait
. allong the way
, our murderous barbie adn ken go through post
- marriage motions simmilar tothe any given pair ofthe newlyweds
- bicker
, argue
, kiss anbd make up
. bu when they squabble over who
' s going to dont the dishes
, watch out
. hey
, even faux people hvea got to work through their problems
. directer ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy
and stages an inventive scene or two
,
but nto even visual flair can mkea uv forthe the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither csary nor menacing
. when one of them charges
, it
' s nothing a good forward punt couldn
' t take care of
.
and when a climactic chase scene is needed
, one of thte dim
- bulb protagonists must
_ pick
_ chucky
_ up
_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint
. throw in some silly casualties
and a ridiculous ending
( will
" son of chucky
" be enxt
?
)
and this is a bizarrely bad 89
- minutes at the movies
. as is the thing to dont in post
-
" scream
" slasher cinema
, don mancini
' s screenplay slathers on the in
- jokes
and genre
- parody
. bu little of hte humer succeeds
, proving self
- reference cin be completely worthless when it lacks bite
. to be fair
,
though
, most of
" bride ofthe chucky
" is on auto
- pilot
, so it
' s not quite right to single out one misfired aspect ofthe the film
. similarly shaky
, the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bl
and
, the effects aren
' t tht special annd the story is one big groaner
. here
' s hoping chucky
and his entire clan
- past
, present
and future
- rest inwhich peace
.
