i have always been a fan ofthe directer neil jordan
, from his early work
, such as 1984
' s
" the company of wolves
,
" to 1992
' s
" tjhe crying game
,
"
and 1994
' s
" interview with a vampire
.
" his latest film
,
" the
butcher boy
,
" is a return tothe his roots in irel
and
,
but unfortunately
, it is nto a successful homecoming
. told thru hte eyes of a 12
- year
- old irish boy
, francis
( newcomer eomann owens
)
, this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidely unstable life
. his father
( stephen rea
) is an indifferent alcoholic
, his mother
( fiona shaw
) is menally ill adn always in
and out of hospitals
,
and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother ofthe oen of his friends affter he is forbidden to see him anymore
. francis is the type ofthe boy who always has a lot to say
, bu mostly fluctuates between sarcasm
and frightening honesty
,
and it quickly becomes apparnet that he may very well be a little psychotic
, even capable of brutal muder
. the premise of
,
" the
butcher boy
,
" is one tath could have very well beeen turned inot a
thought
- provoking
, disturbing motion picture
,
but somehow nothing works
. francis is infact alomst every scene
, bu we learn very little baout him
, as if the film wass distancing itself away from him whn
, i suspect
, we were actually supposed to sympathize whith him
. thsi is definately not young owens fault
,
however
, because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance
,
and isnt able to also seem menacing as well
. the fatc thast we don
' t git close to his character is baceause of the sloppy screenplay
. the supporting characters are no help
,
though
. rea isnt wasted
,
and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son
, or to anyone else for that matter
. he usually seems tothe jstu be sitting watching the television throughtout
. shaw has a little bit moreso tothe wrok with
, usance she hasnt oney touching scene in which she talks to francis infact a timne of dispair
,
but is out ofthe tghe picture just as we are begining to know her
. adn singer sinead o
' connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occaionally gives francis advice
. the pacing is all off in
,
" the
butcher boy
.
"
al
though the stoy sould have beeen dynamite
, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate
, annd i foudn my mind w
andering every once in a hwile
. it is also very episodic
, becasue the developments inthe the stroy fly by with no satisfying payoffs
. at oen point
, francis is sent away tothe a juvenile prision
, adn an odd
, possibly sexual relatiopnship begins to develope between a priest
and himself
,
but nothing comes of it
. i
' d rether think of
,
" yhe
butcher boy
,
" as a brief diversion for directer jordan
, rather than a total misfire
. he has already proven to be a storng director
,
but he lucked out with this latest film
. what could have been a courageous
, unsettling character study of an emotionally distrubed young boy
, onyl manages to be an ineffective
, uninvolivng bore
.
