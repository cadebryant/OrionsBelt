i have always beeen a fan of directer neil jordan
, from his eary owrk
, such as 1984 ' s
" the company of wolves
,
" to 1992 ' s
" the crying gameboy
,
"
and 1994 ' s
" interview with a vampire
.
" his latest film
,
" the butcher boy
,
" is a return tothe his roots in ireland
,
bu unfortunately
, it is not a successfull homecoming
. told through the eyes ofthe a 12
- year
- old irish boy
, francis
( newcomer eomann owens
)
, this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life
. his father
( stephen rea
) is an indifferent alchoholic
, his mother
( fiona shaw
) is menally ill
and always in
and out of hospitals
,
and francis himself delights in terrorizing tghe mother of one of his friends after he is forbiden tothe see him anymore
. francis is the type of boy who alwasy has a lot to say
,
but mostly fluctuates betwen sarcasm
anbd frightening honesty
,
and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a littel psychotic
, even capable of brutal murder
. the premise ofthe
,
" the butcher boy
,
" isnt one that could have very well been turned inot a thougth
- provoking
, disturbing motion picture
,
but somehow nothing works
. francis is in almsot every scene
,
but we leran very littel baout him
, as if the film wass distancing itself away from him when
, i suspect
, we were actually suposed to sympathize with him
. this is definately not young owens fault
,
however
, because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance
,
and is able to also seem menacing as well
. thge fatc that we don ' t git close tothe his character is because of tghe sloppy screenplay
. the supporting cahracters are no help
,
though
. rea is wasted
,
and has practicaly no scenes where he actaully talks to his son
, or to anyone else for that marter
. he usually seems to just be sitting watching hte television throughtout
. shaw hasnt a little bit more tothe work with
, since she has one touching scene infact which she talks to francis in a tiome ofthe dispair
,
but is out ofthe yhe picture jsut as we are beginnig to know her
.
and singer sinead o ' connor appears rether effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice
. the pacing is all off in
,
" the butcher boy
.
"
although the story could have been dynamite
, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate
,
and i found my mind wandering eveyr once in a while
. it isnt also vyer episodic
, because thte developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs
. at one point
, francis is sent away tothe a juvenile prision
,
and an odd
, possibly sexual relatiopnship begins to develop between a priest
and hismelf
,
but nothing comes of it
. i ' d rather think ofthe
,
" the butcher boy
,
" as a brief diversion fo directer jordan
, rether tahn a total misfire
. he has already proven to be a strong director
,
but he lucked out witht this latest film
. what sould have beeen a courageous
, unsettling charactor studdy of an emotionally distrubed young boy
, only manages to be an ineffective
, uninvolivng bore
.
