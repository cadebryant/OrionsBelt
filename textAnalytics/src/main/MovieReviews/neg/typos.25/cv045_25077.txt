whn it comes to the average teenage rumatic comedy
, i expect negative reviews from criticists left
and right
. predictable
, unoriginal
,
and forgettable wiull most likely be the threee adjectives tothe haunt the down to yuo
' s
and the drive me crazy
' s released by the dozens these lastest couple of yeras
. what i really look for in htis kind of movie is the entertainment value while i
' m sitting in the theater
. am i enjoying myself
? is thsi a comfortable break from my week of finals
? this is why i have given films liek fianl destination or road trip high marks
; i had a party ofthe a time wasting my monye on something i won
' t remember enxt week
. so last week i oppened up the new york times
-
and
, no surprise
, boys
and girls got a negative review
. daily news
? negative
. reelviews
? negative
. epinions
. com
? negative
. this ws nothing new
. american py
, final destination
, road trip didn
' t get such hot reviews
and i loved those guilty pleasures
. same goes for she
' s all that
, a formulaic
but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded
. since boys
and girls reunites she
' s all thyat director robert iscove
and actro freddie prinze jr
.
, i predicted d
? j
? vu al over again
.
but
, still curious
, i asked around my skool
and from the one or two peple who had seen it
, hte reactions were far ffrom positive
. i had made up my mind
; i
' ll catch it on video or cable in a couple ofthe years
.
but
, soon after
, folowing a series ofthe unexpected events
( we couldn
' t git into shaft beccause it is rated r
)
, i foudn myself watching boys annd girls
. whoops
. boys anbd girls is about a
" nerdy
, smart
" boy named ryan
( prinze jr
.
)
and a
" popular
, flirt
" girl named jennifer
( claire forlani
)
. breifly meeting as pre
- teens
and nowe attending teh smae college
, the two bump inot each other so many times that eventually they become best friends
.
but infact the movies
, a male
and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other
. with advice fomr their roommates
( am
anda detmer
, jason biggs
)
, ryan
and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of theri relationship
. the film definitely lives up tothe the dreaded threee adjectives
-
and mindless enteratinment is nowhere tothe be found
. i coudl hardly sit through tyhe 93 minute runnung time for severeal reasons
. tjhe dialogue isnt probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie
, mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script
and the ridiculous words theese characters use is waht hollywood thikns kids cin relate to
. it is almost offensive
. an example ofthe an insightful conversation
:
" you
' re dumb
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb
, dumb
.
"
" noone
.
"
( followed by a m
andy moore
- esque tune background
)
( well it
' s not as bad as wing comm
ander i guess
) the supporting casted is also painfully useless
. detmer anbd biggs st
and infront the way for anytying interesting to happen with their own boring
, pointless subplots
. annd
al
though htis is supposted to be fomr both perspectives of the human sex
, prinze jr
' s ryan dominates the screen while forlani
' s jennifer simpley acts as a dilemma for him to work with
. we never learn anything about jennifer whlch is a shame too because forlani is the only actor tothe bring any life into her character
. teenager or not
: yuo
' ll hate this movie
, i gaurantee it
. maybe i should rent she
' s all that again
. isnt it really as good as i think it is
?
