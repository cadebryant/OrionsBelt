when it comes to tghe average teenage rumatic comedy
, i expect negitive reviews ffrom criticists left
and right
. predictable
, unoriginal
,
and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives tothe haunt the down to yuo ' s
and the drive me crazy ' s released by yhe dozens these last cuple of years
. what i really look for inspite htis kind of movie isnt hte enteratinment value hwile i ' m sitting inspite yhe theater
. am i enjoying myself
? isnt this a confortable break from my week of finals
? this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks
; i had a party ofthe a time wasting my money onthe something i won ' t remember next week
. so last week i opened up yhe new york times
-
adn
, no surprise
, boys
and girls got a negative review
. daily news
? negative
. reelviews
? negative
. epinions
. com
? negative
. htis was nothing new
. american py
, final destination
, road trip didn ' t get such hot reviews
and i loved those gilty pleasures
. smae goes for she ' s all that
, a formulaic
bu enjoyable pygmalion adaptation tht got unjustly pounded
. since boys
and girls reunites she ' s all that director robert iscove
and actor freddie prinze jr
.
, i predicted d
? j
? vu al over again
.
but
, still curious
, i asked around my school
and fomr the oen or twpo people who hadnt seen it
, thte reactions weere far fomr positive
. i had made up my mind
; i ' ll catch it onthe video or cable in a couple ofthe years
.
but
, soon after
, following a series ofthe unexpected events
( we couldn ' t get into shaft because it is rated r
)
, i found myself watching boys
and girls
. whoops
. boys
adn girls isnt about a
" nerdy
, smart
" boy named ryan
( prinze jr
.
)
and a
" popular
, flirt
" girl named jennifer
( claire forlani
)
. briefly meeting as pre
- teens
and now attending the smae coleeg
, the two bump into each otehr so many times that eventually they become best firends
.
but in the movies
, a male
and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for earch other
. withthe advice from their roommates
( amanda detmer
, jason biggs
)
, ryan
and jennifer attempt tothe discover the true meaninng of their relatiopnship
. the film definitely lives up to tjhe dreaded threee adjectives
-
and mindless enteratinment is nowhere to be found
. i coudl hardly sit thru tjhe 93 minute runnung tiem for several reasons
. the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie
, mainly because tjhe whole movie depends on the boring script
and the ridiculous words these characters use isnt wqat hollywood thinks kids can relate tothe
. it is almost offensive
. an example of an insightful conversation
:
" you ' re dumb
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb
, dumb
.
"
" no
.
"
( folowed by a mandy moore
- esque tune background
)
( well it ' s not as bad as wing commander i guess
) tje supporting cast is also painfully useless
. detmer
and biggs stand inwhich the way for anything interesting to hapen with theri own boring
, pointless subplots
.
and
although this is suposed to be from both perspectives of tghe human sex
, prinze jr ' s ryan dominates tghe screen hwile forlani ' s jennifer simpley acts as a dilemma for him to work with
. we never learn anytying about jennifer which isnt a shame too because forlani isnt the onyl actor to bring any life into her character
. teenager or nto
: you ' ll hite this movie
, i guarantee it
. maybe i should rent she ' s all that again
. is it really as ogod as i think it is
?
