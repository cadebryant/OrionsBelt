dr
. alan grant
( sam neill
,
" jurassic park
"
) is becomeing disillusioned
. paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was usance the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter
. his lectures bring people interseted in his adventures on isla nubla rather tahn his research
and funding dollars are drying uv
. when the kirbys
( william h
. macy
,
" fargo
"
; tea leoni
,
" the familiy man
"
) ask him to be their guide fo an annviersary flyover ofthe isla sorna
( the nortorious site b of
" the lost world
"
) he
' s disdainful
, bu once they wave their checkbook
, he reconsiders
. howver the kirbys haven
' t given dr
. grant their real agenda in
" jurassic park iii
.
" of course
, we
, the audience
, hvea been tipped off
, given tath the film begins by showing us eric
( trevor morgan
,
" the patriot
"
)
, a young boy
,
and ben
( mark harelik
,
" elction
"
) gonig forthe a paragliding adventure off that same isl
and thta goes awry
(
and looks like cheesy rear projection
)
. grant
' s established bcak home with a newyorker right h
and man
, billy brennan
( aless
andro nivola
,
" love
' s labour
' s lost
"
) onthe site at a dig iin montana sorely lacking funds
. he also pays a visit to old flame dr
. ellie sattler
( laura dern
,
" jurassic park
"
)
, now married tothe another with a young son who calls grant
' the dinosaur man
' apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the film
' s poorly imagined finale
. grant takes billy along on tje kirbys trip
, which is really an ilegle gambit to save their son
, that young paraglider
. the couple aren
' t millionaires
, making grant
' s check bogus
,
and htey
' re separated as well
( eric wass with am
anda
' s new boyfriend
, not thta that mkaes much sense
)
, meaning we
' re in forthe some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining
. the kirbys hired h
ands
(
and obvious bait
) are a threesome led by mr
. udesky
( michael jeter
,
" the gift
"
)
.
( didn
' t anyone consider that casting michael jeter
and william h
. macy together
and not having them be related was a littel odd
?
) as directed by joe johnston
(
" october sky
,
"
" jumanji
"
)
( spielberg only produced tihs one
) fomr a risible script by peter buchman
and the
" election
" team of alex
ander payne
& jim taylor
,
" jurassic park iii
" is nothing mroe tahn a quickie monster flick with a couple of newyorker dinos
( a spinosauraus
, whitch goes head to head with the t
- rex
, annd pteranodons
)
. the plot
, as it weere
, isnt a series ofthe coincidences combined whith extreme leaps of faith
and a trifecta ofthe stupid cell phone tricks
. tje effects are no longer newyorker
,
and
, as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson
, rather murky looking at times
. film editing by robert dalva
(
" october sky
"
) ws presumabely done by machete
, to keep this down tothe a 90 minute run time
. i nkwo of no other reason to explain tyhe rediculous ending which features tje survivers confronting a pack of raptors
, hten being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes
.
' orginal
' music by don davis just repeats john williams
' original themes
. while neill
and young morgan attemp to inject soem humor adn humanity inot hte procedings
, the rest of the casted are plodding unexceptional
.
" jurassic park iii
" will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect
, the same crowd who maybe liekd
" hte lost world
: jurassic park
