" the red violin
" isnt a cold
, sterile feature taht leaves you uninvolved
and detatched
. it
' s a movei that seems almost clinical
, as it traces the 300
- plus
- years istory ofthe the legendary musical instrument of thte title
. opening in tje 17th centruy
, the story shows how violin
- maker nicolo bussotti creaeted the instrument as a gift for his unborn son
. bu when tragedy strikes
, tghe violin becomes the personification ofthe its maker
' s grief
. from there the violin comes into the h
ands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastry
. again
, tradgedy strikes as the child is striked down at hte moment of his triumph
. we follow the violin thru tyhe centruies as it finds a home in engl
and
and infront mao
' s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its au
thenticity
. the violin becomes morritz
' s obsession
, just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house tothe bid on it
. morritz
,
however
, is the onyl one who konws the sercet of the instrument
and can underst
and
and appreciate its creator
' s intention
.
" the red violin
" could have beeen a touching
, inspirational stoyr
, as soaring as a beethoven synphony
.
however director francois girard fails tothe make any emotional connection with the viewer
. here is a story that could have made use ofthe vairous camera angles
and lighting tothe heighten its inpact
. girard
, for some unknown reason
, uses mostly master shots
, keeping his camera
- annd thus us
- at a distance
. we get noone feel forthe the miracle tyhat is the violin
. it
' s resonance
, its purity ofthe sound are not emphaised enought to make an impression
. nor are any of the performances memorable
. it
' s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle tothe his violin
.
" the red violin
" promises much
, bu delivers little
. it is dull at times
, a bited pretentious annd a might murky
. teh movie
' s music soars over its story annd performers
. anbd that is its only saving grace
