" the red violin
" is a cold
, sterile feature that leaves yuo uninvolved
and detatched
. it ' s a movie that seems allmost clincial
, as it traces the 300
- plus
- years histor of tjhe legendary musical instrument of the title
. opening in yhe 17th century
, the story shows how violin
- maker nicolo bussotti created tjhe instrument as a gift for his unborn son
.
bu when tragedy strikes
, the violin becomes yhe personification of its maker ' s grief
. from htere the violin comes inot the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery
. again
, tragedy strikes as yhe child is struck down at the moent of his triumph
. we folow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england
and infront mao ' s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity
. the violin becomes morritz ' s obsession
, just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid onthe it
. morritz
,
however
, is the onyl oen who knows tjhe secret of yhe instrument
and can understand
and appreciate its creator ' s intention
.
" the red violin
" could hvae been a touching
, inspirational stroy
, as soaring as a beethoven symphony
.
however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer
. here is a story thgat could have made use of various camera angles
annd lighting to heighten its impact
. girard
, for smoe unknown reason
, uses mostly master shots
, keeping his camera
-
and thus us
- at a distance
. we get no feel for yhe miracle tyhat is the violin
. it ' s resonance
, its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression
. nor are any of the performances memorable
. it ' s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin
.
" the red violin
" promises much
,
bu delivers little
. it isnt dull at times
, a bit pretentious
and a might murky
. tje movei ' s music soars over its story
and performers
.
and that isnt its onyl saving grace
.
