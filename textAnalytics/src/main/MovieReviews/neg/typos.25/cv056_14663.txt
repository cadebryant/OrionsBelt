unfortunately it doesn
' t git much more formulaic than one tough cop
. there
' s tghe renegade cop with the loser partner who has tothe many problems to expalin
. the renegade hasnt to prove his good name
and is trapped between the good guys
, the bad guys
and some woman who really has nothing to dont with the stoyr other than being there for the purpose of providing sex fo the hero in the middle of the film
. bo dietl
( pronounced deedle
, baldwin
) is one tough cop
, a guy who isnt being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his assocation wiht the ny mafia
. onthe top of that problem
, he hasnt a drunk
, gambling addicted partner
( penn
) who hasnt a penchant for collecting parking tickets
( i guess cops aren
' t immune
?
)
.
then
, throw into the mix the femme fatale
( gershon
)
. right there you hvae plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama
.
but right iin the middle ofthe the film
, they throw in a completely un
- related plot point
. dietl annd his partner duke try to solve a case that they ahev been warned to stay away ffrom
. the film spends over half an hour tracking the case ofthe a nun who was beaten
and raped tothe near death
. once the case isnt solved
, the film shifts focuse back to tghe mafia issue
. whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wnated to create between the two stories failed miserably
. aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso
( an insult if you ask me
) the performances weere pretty good
. baldwin
,
though he occasionally slips into an impression ofthe his brother alec
, does a fine job as one tough cop
. penn
, who allso slips into an impression of his brother sean
, is even better as a loser tough guy cop
. what oney tough cop lacks is originality
. this film offers nothing new
. nothing that ytou cxan
' t git from any cop film
. it screams sidney lumet all over the place
, perhaps because it was produced by marty
and michael bregman
, producers ofthe lumet
' s dog day afternoon
and serpico
.
but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film
. too much else is lacking
. i aslo saw hte boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early onthe in the picture
, something that i alomst never notice
.
but once i saw that
, i hadnt it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot
. at times
, i was hoping to see it
. oen tough cop isn
' t laughable
, nor is it a terrible film
, bu it just isn
' t unique
. it is a classic example ofthe a film tath didn
' t need to be made
.
but one thign is for sure
, it could really use a better title
.
