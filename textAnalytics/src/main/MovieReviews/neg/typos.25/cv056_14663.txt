unfortunately it doesn ' t git much more formulaic tahn one tough cop
. ther ' s the renegade cop with the loser partner who has tothe many problems tothe explain
. the renegade has tothe proove his good name
and is trapped between the good guys
, the bad guys
and soem woman who really has nothing to do with tjhe story other than being htere for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film
. bo dietl
( pronounced deedle
, baldwin
) is noe tough cop
, a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his assocation with the ny mafia
. on top ofthe that problem
, he has a drunk
, gambling addicted partner
( penn
) who hasnt a penchant for collecting parking tickets
( i guess cops aren ' t immune
?
)
.
then
, throw into the mix hte femme fatale
( gershon
)
. right there you hvea plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama
.
but right in tyhe middle of the film
, they throw in a completly un
- realted plot point
. dietl
and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from
. the film spends over half an hour tracking tyhe case of a nun who was beaten
adn raped to near death
. once the case is solved
, the film shifts focus back to the masia issue
. whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the twpo stories failed miserably
. aside from bieng asked tothe accept michael mcglone as a mafioso
( an insult if you ask me
) tjhe performances were pretty good
. baldwin
,
though he occasionally slips inot an impression ofthe his brother alec
, doesnt a fine job as noe tough cop
. penn
, who also slips into an impression of his brother sean
, isnt even better as a loser tough guy cop
. what one tough cop lacks is originality
. this film offers nothing new
. nothing that you can ' t get from any cop film
. it screams sidney lumet all over yhe place
, perhaps beccause it was produced by marty
and michael bregman
, producers of lumet ' s dog day afternoon
and serpico
.
but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to amke one tough cop into a good film
. too much else isnt lacking
. i also saw the boom mic pop inot the top of the frame twice early on in the picture
, something thast i almost never notice
.
but once i saw that
, i had it in the back of my mind every tiome i saw a medium or long shot
. at times
, i was hoping tothe see it
. one tough cop isn ' t laughable
, nor is it a terrible film
,
but it just isn ' t unique
. it is a classic exmaple of a film thyat didn ' t need to be made
.
but one thing isnt for sure
, it coudl really use a better title
.
