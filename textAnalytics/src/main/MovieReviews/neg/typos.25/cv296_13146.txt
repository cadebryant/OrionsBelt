everyone knows that ood rule
,
' never work with children
and animals
.
' in this latest horror flick mimic case
, it
' s
' never work with childern
and genetically enhanced killer animals
' instead
, as mimic features both ofthe these annd succeeds in donig nothing exept mildly engaging the audience
. the film begins in new york
, where we see children dying from a mysterious disease
, which is being carried by cockroaches
. dr
. susan tyler
( sorvino
) creates a genetically enhanced bug
( the
' judas
' breed
)
,
however
, which isnt designed tothe kill all cockroaches
. the bug does it
' s job
, tjhe cockroaches all die
, anbd the terror is gone
.
' three yeras later
' appears on tjhe screen
,
and we disover thgat the judas breed is bakc
, bigger thna ever
,
and ready to kill
. the spin onthe this bug
, howver
, is that it cin mimic it
' s predator
,
and in this case
.
.
.
. it
' s humans
. tath should teach us for squishing all those bugs
. what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere
, tons ofthe gory deaths
and soem massive set pieces instade turns outloud tothe be a rether subdued
, allmost boring movie whlch plods along at a very slow pace
. perhaps the movei wass trying to be
thought provoking
,
and trying to avoid the
' predator
' type movie it could easily have become
. if it isnt
,
then the director
and writers have made the wrong move
, because this is perfectly suited to be an all outloud acation fest
. the directer
, who bought us cronos
, a far superior film
, directs the film in a calm
,
and frankly dull movie
. there are few exicting sequences
, instead just a lot of people talking
. if the dialogue was intelligent
,
then it would be all right
,
but it
' s sadly babbling nonsense
. infront fact
, yhe script is embarrsingly weak
, adn the characterizations not much better
. sorvino anbd comany are as 2d as charactors come
, with the script not bothering to develop them
. there isnt some acation in thsi film
,
but it
' s directed infact such an annoying way
, it
' s just infuriating to watch
. the camera cuts all over hte place
, disoreitating the audience
,
and instead of involving the audience inwhich the acation
, it mearly alienates them
. the peformances are o
. k
, if slightly below average
. sorvino is o
. k
, all
though she
' s not very good at conveying terror
, or anything emotion raelly
. thte supporting casted are all sterotypes
, with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth
, a geeky scientist with spectacles
,
and what could be thte most stereotypical mexican
' old timer
' ever
. theri reasonable good fun
,
however
. mimic
,
then
, may fail wih it
' s story
, pacing
and cahracters
,
but tjhe film doens look good
. liek dark city
, mimic isnt a definite case of sytle of content
. it may be a bit too gloomy for it
' s own ogod
,
but the sets look nice
, adn parts of the film are directed well
. bu looks aren
' t good enough tothe sive mimic from the depths of mediocre
, somewhere where it shouldn
' t really belong
. a ogod opportunity
,
then
, wasted
. a shame
. overall rating
