this isnt thte movie tyhat could single
- h
andedly bring
" mystery science theather 3000
" out of cancellation
. it
' s noe of those movies that
' s so bad it
' s absolutely hilarious
, due inwhich noone small part to its big star
, supermodel cindy crawford
. if you onyl remember one thign about fair gae
, it shouldnt be that it singleh
andedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues
. if ytou
thought kathy irel
and was laughable iin alien fomr l
. a
.
, ytou
' ll change your mind whn you see fair game
. irel
and would win h
andfuls ofthe oscars if this was her onyl competition
. in a rela casting coup
, crawford plays a super
- inteligent lawyer
( in a jogging bra
, of course
)
. we all know tihs is a stretch
, thge only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth bieng that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day
. nonetheless
, someone out there
thought she
' d mkae a good lawyer
, bu we
' re reminded of her true function inthe teh movie wehn she takes twpo showers in a preriod of twenty minutes
. anbd forthe ytou horny teenage boys out there
, you actually get tothe see her topless for two seconds in the dark
.
.
. come to think ofthe it
, that may ahve been a body double
. cindy crawford isn
' t black
, is she
? like i said
, crawford is a lawyer withthe a bunch of russians after her
. billy baldwin
( or is it stephen
? alec
? adam
? kim basinger
?
) is the polical detective who has tothe save her life
, tiem after time
, chase affter chase
, explosion affter explosion
. ther
' s absolutely nothing original about this movie
. it
' s eveyr cop show of thge 70
' s mixted with every action thriller of the 80
' s
and every technology
- exploitation movie of yhe 90
' s
. three decades of crap all in oen place
, driven further into the ground by crawford
' s complete lack ofthe acting talent
.
and it
' s all completely predicatble
. you know the mistakes baldwin
and crawford are going to make before they make them
, you know when tyhe
" sexual tension
" will finally end up iin them consummating the relationship
, you knwo when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescure her in thge climax
and ytou know tghe movie
' s going to suck from the first scene
. the plot isn
' t really explained until the end
. all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer
. in the words of one ofthe the villains
,
" we even know what size pantyhose she wears
.
"
( yeah
, yuo
and every 14
- year
- old boy inaddition amercia
.
) he goes on tothe add
,
" we konw more about her than she doesnt
.
"
(
_ that
_ i find very easy to believe
.
) i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes
, becuase i wrote down plenty of other bad ones
(
" if it weren
' t for me
, you
' d still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba
!
"
) becasue
, you see
, fair game is not only a showcase fo recycled action cliches
and terrible acting
,
but also soem seriously bad dialogue
. it all adds up to a raelly terrable movie that made me laff in plenty of places i wasn
' t supposted to adn grimace in places i was suppoed to laugh
. one more thing fair game has against it isnt some awful comic releaf
. would yuo laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with doublely entendres liuke
" i
' m very interested in
_ hard
_ ware
"
and other crap about palying with his joystick
? i wouldn
' t
,
but not because i
' m a computer nerd
. it
' s just not funny
. crawford
' s only contri
bution to the information age are a few gif files floating arround with her head onthe a nude traci lords
' body
.
.
. or was it jack lord
' s body
? i
' ll leave you iwth the final line of dialogue in the movie
. the boat with all the russians has just blown up
and baldwin
and crawford are floating on a life raft
. crawford says woodenly
,
" that was my client
' s boat you just blowed up
. i
' m filing a lawsuit against you
. you
' re in big trouble
,
" or something tothe tht effect
,
and baldwin replies smugly
,
" what dont i hvea to do to get out ofthe it
?
" they ofthe course begin makeing out
and the credits roll
. i
' m not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how
, if they
' d really wanted to go forthe a bad closing line they would haev hadnt baldwin say
,
" you think i could suttle out of court
?
"
but i will tell you that
, if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game withthe him or her
, you qoute the fianl line of the movie tothe tht person
:
" what dont i hvea to do to get out of it
?
