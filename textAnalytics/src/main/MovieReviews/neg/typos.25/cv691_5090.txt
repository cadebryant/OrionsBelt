this is the movie tyhat sould single
- handedly bring
" mystery scinece theater 3000
" out of cancellation
. it ' s one ofthe thsoe movies that ' s so bad it ' s absolutely hillarious
, due in noone small part to its big star
, supermodel cindy crawford
. if you only remember one thnig about fair game
, it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick tothe teh sports illustrated swimsuit issues
. if yuo thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l
. a
.
, ytou ' ll change your mind when you see fair game
. ireland woudl win handfuls of oscars if this was her onyl competition
. in a rela casting coup
, crawford plays a super
- intelligent lawyer
( in a jogging bra
, of course
)
. we all know tihs is a stretch
, the only legal oppinion crawford hasnt ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day
. nonetheless
, someone out there thought she ' d make a good lawyer
,
but we ' re reminded of her true function in the movie when she tkaes two showers in a preiod of twenty minutes
.
and for you horny teenage boys out there
, you actually get to see her topless for two seconds infact the dark
.
.
. cmo to think ofthe it
, that may ahve beeen a body double
. cindy crawford isn ' t balck
, isnt she
? like i said
, crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians affter her
. billy baldwin
( or is it stephen
? alec
? adam
? kim basinger
?
) is thge police detective who has to save her life
, timne aftter time
, chase aftter chase
, explosion after explosion
. there ' s absolutly nothing original about this movie
. it ' s every cop show of the 70 ' s mixed with every acation thriller of thte 80 ' s
and every technology
- explotation movie of the 90 ' s
. threee decades of crap all in one place
, driven further inot the ground by crawford ' s complete lack of acting talent
.
and it ' s all completely predictable
. you konw tjhe mistakes baldwin
annd crawford are going tothe make before they make them
, you know when the
" sexual tension
" will finally end up in them consummating the relationship
, you nkwo wehn the villains wiull capture crawford so baldwin has to rescure her in tje climax
and you konw the movie ' s gogin tothe suck from tyhe first scene
. the plot isn ' t really explained until the end
. all we konw is these russians hvea eveyr detail about crawford infact their computer
. in the words ofthe one ofthe the villains
,
" we even knwo what size pantyhose she wears
.
"
( yeah
, yuo
and every 14
- year
- ood boy in america
.
) he goes on tothe add
,
" we know more baout her than she does
.
"
(
_ that
_ i find very easy to believe
.
) i hope you enjoyed thsoe two sample dialogue quotes
, because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones
(
" if it weren ' t for me
, ytou ' d still be pulling bananas outloud of your ass in cuba
!
"
) because
, you see
, fair gmae is nto only a showcase for recycled action cliches
anbd terrible acting
,
but also smoe seriously bad dialogue
. it all adds up tothe a raelly terrible movei that made me laff in plenty of places i wasn ' t supposed tothe
and grimace in places i was suppossed to laugh
. oen more thign fair gaem has against it is some awful comic relief
. would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like
" i ' m vrey interested in
_ hard
_ ware
"
annd other crap about palying withthe his joystick
? i wouldn ' t
,
but nto because i ' m a computer nerd
. it ' s just not funny
. crawford ' s only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords ' body
.
.
. or wass it jack lord ' s body
? i ' ll leave you with the final line of dialogue infact the movie
. the boat with all the russians has just blown up
adn baldwin
and crawford are floating on a life raft
. crawford sasy woodenly
,
" that was my client ' s boat you just blew uv
. i ' m filing a lawsuit against you
. you ' re in big trouble
,
" or something to thgat effect
,
and baldwin replies smugly
,
" what dont i haev to do tothe get out ofthe it
?
" they of course begin makeing out
and the credits roll
. i ' m not going to talk baout how stupid the line is or how
, if they ' d really wnated tothe go for a bad closing line they would have hadnt baldwin say
,
" ytou think i coudl settle out of court
?
"
but i will tell yuo that
, if anyone ever suggests you watch fair gaem with him or her
, you quote the final line of the movie to that person
:
" what do i have to do to get out ofthe it
?
" serving america forthe over 1
/ 50th of a century
!
