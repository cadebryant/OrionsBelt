' s review of
" session 9
"
( usa films
) sometimes you just git more tahn your bargained for
.
.
. like when boston
- based hazmat elimination
, run by scottish actor peter mullan
and his trusty assitant
, david caruso
, assures a twon engineer
( paul guilifoyle
) that tehy can remove insidious asbesots fibers ffrom a victorian hospital facility in a week
. erected in 1871
, deserted
and decomposing since 1985
, yhe danvers mental hospital
, is oney ofthe the most malevolent
" locations
" ever chosen for a film
. tjhe structure isnt so massive
- with its labyrinth ofthe rubble
- strewn corridors
, collapsing floors
, stagnant pools of water
, isolation cells
, annd ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre
- frontal lobotomies were performed
- taht their task seems impossible within that tiome frame
.
and each memeber of their inexperienced crew
( stephan gevedon
, br
andon sexton iii
,
and josh lucas
) isnt coping wtih his own personal demons as
, one by one
, thier minds seem tothe be affected by teh grim areas inwhich which they
' re wokring
. the film
' s title isnt derived from salvaged reel
- to
- reel audio
- recorded sessions involving the demonic possesison ofthe a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities
. by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters
. filmmaker brad
anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw
- massacre
- type ghost story
but the scirpt lacks stucture
and isn
' t particularly scary
. the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing
. on yhe granger movie gaug of 1 to 10
,
" session 9
" is a dark
, gloomy 4
. silly me
.
.
. at first
, i thougth that the origonal nmae ofthe the danvers lunatic asylum bore some referenc to mrs
. danvers
, the creepy housekeeper palyed by judith
anderson in alfred hitchcock
' s truly terrifying
" rebecca
" taht also involved a cavernous mansion called m
anderley
.
