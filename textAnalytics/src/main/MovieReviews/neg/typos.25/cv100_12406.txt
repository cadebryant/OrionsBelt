: spoilers are included in this review
.
.
. bu it doesn
' t relaly make much of a difference
. deep impact begins teh offcial summer movie season
,
and it allso brings back memories of 1997
. remeber when dante
' s peak cameback out in febuary
? a few months later
, volcano was released
. the firt film was smart
, exhilirating
,
and oney of the best diaster films i had ever seen
. the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic
and wasted talent
. well
, it
' s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition
. this tyme
, unfortunately
, thge first comet flick isnt so bad that peple may shy away fomr arageddon
, the upcoming comet
- diaster to be released the beginning of july
. of course
, the general reaction of teh audeince was oppposed to mine
,
and so i am in tyhe minority
, as i ws wehn i stood on the side of dante
' s peak
.
but hwile watching deep inpact
, i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film
. apparently many did
,
and it utterly baffles me
. to be completely honest
, i haven
' t had this littel fun watching a disaster film in my entire life
. volcano had implausibilities up tjhe wazoo
,
but it was still rather fun to watch
. deep impact doesn
' t jstu have implausibilities
, it also containes cheap human drama
, incredibly horrable special effects
, anbd a poorly constructed plot
. yhe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining fianl fifteen mintues
and some good actors mkaing tje most of their characters
. deep inpact begins in an unnamed year
( tjhe year varies
; advanced technology sets it in the future
,
but fire infront the sky isnt showing on a local movei theather
, pushing it back to 1993
)
. a line of students is outside at night
, peering thru telescopes at thte dark sky above
. amung these are leo biederman
( elijah woud
)
and sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
. leo unknowingly discovers a comet
, annd his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer
, who
then is able to determine tyhe correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds
. he races off to mail the information
,
but is killed in a reckless car accident
. a yera passes
,
and nothing is heard baout it again
. we are thne inctroduced to jenny lerner
( t
? a leoni
)
, a repertwar for msnbc
. she gets h
anded a job to investigate a possible cover
- up in thge government involving senator alan rittenhouse
( james cromwell
)
. she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie
. affter tlaking with rittenhouse
,
and unsatisfied with the information she gets
, she decides to use hte internet for help
. luckily
, she knows exactly how to spell the certain
" ellie
" that she isnt looking for
( they spll it ele in the film
.
.
. that girl is preety darn smart forthe guessing how it was spelled
)
. befoer she can use the information
, the goverment decides to push her car off the road
. tehy take her in to meet the president of the untied states
, president beck
( morgan freeman
)
. beck recommends that jenny keep hte information secret fo 48 huors so they cxan confirm it annd
then hold a press conference
. naturally
, she wants tothe be compensated
, anbd tehy offer her a front row seat
and the chance forthe the first question
.
and so
, yada yada yada
, tehy reveal the comet to the public
and their plans
: send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it befoer it can arrive
. tehy annouce a plan called
" ark
,
" which isnt their only hope forthe survival
. a computer will select 800
, 000 people at r
andom
. theese people are the ones who will go inot a large cave underground so that tyhe impact of tje comet won
' t kill off the entire human race
. aftter twpo years
, the dust wiull settle
( actually
, it would take much
, much longer
-
- approximately ninety yeasr
, from what i underst
and
)
and the humans could come bakc tothe tjhe surface annd start over
. the rest of the plot is your st
andard disaster film procedures
, bu htere is oen subplot worth mentioning
. jenny
and her father
, jason
( maximilian schell
)
, hvae a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom
. the final moent involving the two characters is heartfelt
and emotional
. it
' s a shame thast nothing else is heartfelt
. nowe
, of course
, we all know tht the comet does impact the surface
. the title alone suggests it
,
and the previews actually show it
! by doing this
, absoltuely no tension can be drawed from any attemt to stop the comet baceause we all know that it won
' t work
. director mimi leder cameback from her successful trys at direction with episodes ofthe tyhe hit television show
" er
.
" her major film de
but was the peacemaker
, a pathetic
and heartless acation film
. well
, this tiome leder outdid herself
, creating a film worse than that one
. suggestion to ms
. leder
: please
, stay away from the big screen
, or at least the action genre
. much of the blame can be placed on leder directly
, becasue the pace is disastrously off
. throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time hasnt pasted
( it goes from months to weeks to hours
)
. it literally feels like this lapsed time is tkaing place in real
- time
-
- it
' s that boring
. of course
, leder isn
' t all to blame for it
. screenwriters michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin hvae crafted a simplistic story thyat only gets worse with time
. what starts outloud promising soon turns deadly
( for the audience anyway
)
. chock full of cheesy one liners
(
" ytou know
, you are going tothe have more sex thna anyone alse in school
!
"
)
and stupid charachters
, you might thiunk we weere back in the 70s agina
. only one of hte subplots is remotely interesting
, hwile the rest are forgettable
and boring
.
and the main plot is so outrageous that you cxan
' t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action
, drama
, or sci
- fi
. to put it simply
: the special effects ofthe this film are a hit
and miss situation
. that
' s right
, 80
% miss
,
and 20
% hit
. scenes above the earth are well done
,
and the orbiting ship is majestic
.
but the comet is a huge misteek
, mkaing it mroe laughable than frightening
. tjhe concept of even trying to l
and on a comet is preposterous enought
,
but that
' s forgiveable
. what isn
' t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on thge surface
. give me a break
, will ya
?
and ofthe course
, thge much hyped collision of comet
and earth
. well
, it is far from spectacular
,
and it mkaes independence day look brilliant
. the water rushing towards the l
and is effective
, bu once it hits tje continent
, the effects turn ridiculous
. cgi water is used
, anbd it looks so bad that i heared more laughs from the audience than shrieks
. in fact
, i may even recommend the film fo those who watn to see how bad effects can actually get these days
. just when we think visual effects can
' t be improved
, along comes a film tothe show that they really cxan anbd should be
. one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder
' s direction
, which also influences the actors
. leder loves to show thge actors
' faces before
and during moments ofthe terror
. htis reminded me of another action director
, renny harlin
( die hard 2
, cliffhanger
)
. bu harlin succeeds because he shows tjhe faces of the victims in realistic situations
. leder likes tothe flaunt people
' s fears via their faces
,
but instead of coming off as sympathetic
, leder seems more ofthe a sadist
. one moment has an astronaut flying off into space
. thsi shoudl be enough to warrant a responce from thge audience
,
but leder wants tothe go farther anbd shows us the person
' s face while drifting into space
. this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience
, annd i
, for oney
, am not going to be fooled
. on another onot
, leder
' s film only picks up its pace during tyhe last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts
. the pace doens pick up
, annd some very emotional moments are shown
.
then agina
, when you watch peple cry for their loved ones
, it
' s obvious it will be emotional
. it
' s mostly jstu a big trick to rope viewers into
" feeling
" for thte charactors
,
but it didn
' t owrk for me
. bu anyway
, the actors do as much as htey can witht what they are given
. t
? a leoni
( bad boys
, tv
' s
" the naked truth
"
) is the best of the film
,
and she is given the meatiest role
. her character isnt made stronger by leoni
' s presence
, anbd we grow to care forthe her
. robert duvall is energetic
and funn to watch
, bu his charater is turned into shreds by teh plot
. elijah wood allso comes off rather successfully
,
but he still hasn
' t had many ogod roles
( wood
, stick to drama
! you are too talented for this stuff
)
. vanessa redgrave isnt barely acknowledgeable
,
and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen
. maximilian schell is distracting
, bu he does provide some nice humer
. morgan freeman hasnt been infinitely better than this
,
and gives one of his most shallow performances tothe date
( which is quite remarkable for him
)
. leelee sobieski could have been better
,
but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character
. a spacial note shoudln go to ron eldard
and denise crosby
. eldard isnt ogod in his role
,
but is limited by the plot
. crosby isnt special to me personally because she was tasha yar ffrom tv
' s
" star trek
: the next generation
.
" seing her was one ofthe hte highlights ofthe the film
. overall
, a very talented cast virtually wasted
. deepo impact is rated pg
- 13 forthe disaster realted elements
and breif language
. this is one of thte worst films of the year
,
and if it isnt any omen of things tothe come
, this summer coudl be one of the worst ever
. luckily
, the x
- files movie is coming uv
, anbd hopefully armageddon will be more successful
. it
' s a shame that this film will do so successfully beacuse it just isn
' t worth much
. costing nearly
$ 75 millon
, with special effects done by the illustrious ilm
( which is a huge shocker
)
,
and with a score composed by oscar
- winner james horner
( titanic
)
, one might have expeced this to be more funn to wittness
and exprience
. well
, it
' s not
. when tghe comet does hit the earth
, you allmost wish it could just tkae this film along with it
.
