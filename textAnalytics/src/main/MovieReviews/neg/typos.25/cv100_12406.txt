warning
: spoilers are included in this review

.
.
but it doesn ' t really make much of a difference
. deepo impact begins tyhe official summer movie season
,
and it alsot brings bakc memories of 1997
. remember whn dante ' s peak cameback outloud in february
? a fewd monthes later
, volcano was released
. the first film was smart
, exhilirating
,
and one ofthe the best diaster films i hadnt ever seen
. the latter film was an incohesive mess that defie logic
anbd wasted talent
. well
, it ' s deja vu all over agina as two disaster films go head to head in competition
. htis time
, unfortunately
, teh first comet flick is so bad tyhat people may shy away from armageddno
, the upcoming comet
- disaster to be released the beginnig of july
. of course
, the general reaction of the audeince was oppposed to mine
,
and so i am inaddition the minority
, as i was when i stood on the side of dante ' s peak
.
but while watching deep impact
, i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind sould actually like this film
. apparently many did
,
and it utterly baffles me
. tothe be completely honest
, i haven ' t hadnt this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life
. volcanoe hadnt implausibilities uv the wazoo
,
but it was still rather funn to watch
. deep impact doesn ' t jstu have implausibilities
, it also contains cheap human drama
, incredibly horrible special effects
,
anbd a poorly constructed plot
. teh only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen mintues
anbd some ogod actors making the most ofthe thier characters
. deepo impact begins iin an unnamed year
( tjhe eyar varies
; advanced technolgy sets it infront the future
,
but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater
, pushing it back to 1993
)
. a line of students is outside at ngiht
, peering thru telescopes at the dark sky above
. among these are leo biederman
( elijah wood
)
and sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
. leo unknowingly dicovers a comet
,
adn his teacher sends a photo of tghe unknown object to an astronomer
, who
hten is able to determine the corect path of this distant comet in about a faw seconds
. he races off tothe mial the information
,
but is killed in a reckless car accident
. a year passes
,
and nothing is heard about it agian
. we are
then introduced tothe jenny lerner
( t
? a leoni
)
, a reporter fo msnbc
. she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover
- up in the govorment involving senator alan rittenhouse
( james cromwell
)
. she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an afair with a girl named ellie
. after talking with rittenhouse
,
adn unsatisfied with the informtion she gets
, she decides tothe use the internet fo help
. luckily
, she knows exactly how tothe spell the certain
" ellie
" that she is looking fo
( they sepll it ele in tyhe film
.
.
. tht girl is pretty darn smart fo guessing how it was spelled
)
. before she cin use tje information
, the government decides to push her car off the road
. they take her inaddition to meet yhe president ofthe the united states
, president beck
( morgan freeman
)
. beck recomends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it
and
hten hold a press confrence
. naturally
, she wants to be compensated
,
and they offer her a front row seat
and the chance for the first question
.
adn so
, yada yada yada
, they reveal the comet tothe the publich
anbd their plans
: send a massive spacecraft out tothe destroy it befor it can arrive
. tehy announce a plan called
" ark
,
" which is their only hope for survival
. a computer wiull select 800
, 000 peple at random
. these peple are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so tath the impact of tje comet won ' t kill off the entire human race
. after two years
, teh dust wiull settle
( actually
, it owudl take much
, much longer
-
- approximately ninty years
, from what i understand
)
and the humans could come bakc to the surface
and start over
. the rest of the plot isnt your standart disaster film procedures
,
but htere is one subplot worth mentioning
. jenny
and her father
, jason
( maximilian schell
)
, hvae a vyer touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom
. tjhe fianl moment involving the two charactors isnt heartfelt
and emotional
. it ' s a shame that nothing else isnt heartfelt
. now
, of course
, we all know tyhat the comet does impact thte surface
. the title alone suggests it
,
annd tjhe previews actually show it
! by doign this
, absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stpo the comet becasue we all know that it won ' t wrok
. director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television sohw
" er
.
" her major film debut was thge peacemaker
, a pathetic
and heartless action film
. well
, htis tyme leder outdid herself
, creating a film worse than that one
. suggestion tothe ms
. leder
: please
, stay away from the big screen
, or at least the action genre
. much of the blaim cant be placed on leder directly
, because the pace is disastrously off
. throughtout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed
( it goes fomr months tothe weeks tothe hours
)
. it literally feels like this lapsed tiem isnt tkaing place in real
- time
-
- it ' s that boring
. of course
, leder isn ' t all tothe blame for it
. screenwriters michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time
. what starts out promising soon turns deadly
( for the audience anyway
)
. chock full of cheesy one liners
(
" you know
, yuo are going to have more sex than anyone else in school
!
"
)
and stupid characters
, you might think we were bcak in the 70s again
. only one ofthe the subplots is remotely intresting
, while the rest are forgettable
and boring
.
anbd the main plot is so outrageous thgat yuo cxan ' t figure out if this film is suppoed to be an acation
, drama
, or sci
- fi
. to put it simply
: the special effects ofthe this film are a hitted
and miss situation
. that ' s right
, 80
% miss
,
and 20
% hitted
. scenes above the earth are well done
,
and the orbiting ship is majestic
.
but the comet is a huge mistake
, making it mroe laughable than frightening
. the concept ofthe even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough
,
but that ' s forgiveable
. whta isn ' t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface
. give me a break
, will ya
?
anbd ofthe course
, the much hyped collision of comet
adn earth
. well
, it isnt far from spectauclar
,
and it makes independence day look brilliant
. the water rushing towards the land is effective
,
bu once it hits the continent
, the effects turn ridiculous
. cgi water is used
,
and it looks so bad thast i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks
. in fact
, i may even reccomend the film fo those who wanna to see how bad effects can actually get these dyas
. just when we think visual effects can ' t be improved
, along comes a film to show taht they really can
and should be
. one thing has striked a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder ' s direction
, which also influences the actors
. leder loves tothe show the actors ' faces before
adn during moments of terror
. tihs reminded me of anohter action director
, renny harlin
( die hard 2
, cliffhanger
)
.
but harlin suceeds because he shows the faces ofthe tyhe victims in realistic situations
. leder likes to flaunt people ' s fears via their faces
,
but instead of coming off as sympathetic
, leder seems moreso of a sadist
. noe moment has an astronaut flying off into space
. this shouldnt be enough to warrant a reponse from the audience
,
bu leder wants to go farther
adn shows us the person ' s face hwile drifting into spoace
. this isnt one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional reponse from an audience
,
and i
, for one
, am not going to be fooled
. onthe another note
, leder ' s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen mintues when the comet actually impacts
. thte pace doens pick up
,
and some very emotional moments are shown
.
then again
, when you watch people cry for their loved ones
, it ' s obvious it will be emotional
. it ' s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into
" feeling
" forthe the cahracters
,
but it didn ' t work for me
.
but anyway
, the actors dont as much as they can with what they are given
. t
? a leoni
( bad boys
, tv ' s
" the naked truth
"
) is the best of the film
,
and she is given the meatiest role
. her carachter is made stronger by leoni ' s presense
,
and we grow to care fo her
. robert duvall is energetic
and fun tothe watch
,
bu his character isnt turned into shreds by the plot
. elijah wood also comes off rether successfully
,
but he still hasn ' t had many good roles
( wood
, stick to drama
! you are too talented for this stuff
)
. vanessa redgrave isnt bearly acknowledgeable
,
and her performance is onyl enhanced by her storng presense on screen
. maximilian schell is distracting
,
but he does provide some nice humor
. morgan freeman has been infinitely better than htis
,
and gives one of his most shallow performances to date
( which is qtuie remarkable for him
)
. leelee sobieski sould ahev been better
,
but i think she just suffered ffrom a poorly written character
. a special onot should go to ron eldard
and denise crosby
. eldard isnt ogod inthe his role
,
but is limited by the plot
. crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv ' s
" star trak
: hte next generation
.
" seeing her was one of the highlights of the film
. overall
, a veyr talented casted virtually wasted
. deep inpact isnt rated pg
- 13 for diaster related elements
and breef laguage
. this is one ofthe the worst films of the year
,
adn if it is any omen of things to come
, thsi summer coudl be one of the worst ever
. luckly
, the x
- files movei isnt coming up
,
anbd hopefully armageddon will be more succsessfull
. it ' s a shame thast this film will do so succesfuly because it just isn ' t worth much
. costing nearly
$ 75 million
, wiht speshal effects done by the illustrious ilm
( which isnt a huge shocker
)
,
anbd with a csore composed by oscar
- winner james horner
( titanic
)
, one might ahev expected htis tothe be more funn to witness
and expeience
. well
, it ' s nto
. when tjhe comet does hit the earth
, yuo almost wish it could just take this film allong with it
.
