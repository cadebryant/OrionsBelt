there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do
. i delighted in hte sneaky
- smart entertainment of ron underwood
' s big
- undreground
- worm yarn tremors
; i even giggled at last yera
' s critically
- savaged big
- underwater
- snake yarn anaconda
. something about theese films causes me to lower my inhibitions
and return to the saturday afternoons ofthe my youth
, spent in teh company of ghidrah
, the creature from the black lagoon
and the blob
. deep rising
, a big
- undersea
- serpent yarn
, doesn
' t quite pass the test
. sure enough
, all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place
: a conspicuously multi
- ethnic
/ multi
- national collection of bait
.
.
. excuse me
, characters
; an isolated location
, here a derelict cruise ship in teh south china sea
; some comic relief
; a few cgi
- enhanced gross
- outs
;
and at least one big explosion
. there are too
- cheesy
- tothe
- be
- accidental elements
, like a sleazy shiping magnate
( anthony heald
) who allso appears to hvea a doctorate in marine biology
, or a slinky international jewel thieve
( famke janssen
) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold
. as it happens
, deep rising isnt noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in wich it spits out all thsoe ingredients
. a terrorist crew
, led by squinty
- eyed mercenary hanover
( wes studi
) adn piloted by squinty
- eyed boat captain finnegan
( treat williams
)
, shows uv tothe loot the cruise ship
; the sea monsters show up to eat teh mercenary crew
; a few survivors amking it to the closing credits
.
and up go the lights
. it
' s hard tothe work up much enthusiasm fo this sort of joyless film
- making
, especially wehn a monster moview should make you laugh every tyme it mkaes you scream
. here
, the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j
. o
' connor
, generally amusing as the crew
' s fraidy
- cat mechanic
. writer
/ director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone ofthe action
- horror menace
-
- something over
- populated with gore
- drenched skeletons
, something where the gunfire
and special effects are taken a bit too seriously
. deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we
' re expected to have a ridiculous good tyme
, not hide our eyes
. case it point
, comparing deepo rising to its recent cousin anaconda
. inwhich deep rising
, one of the creature
' s victims is regurgitated back into veiw
, parshally digested
and still alive
. he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance
and pain
, in a moment a bited too disturbing to be laughable
. in anaconda
, we aslo see a regurgitated victum
, parshally digested anbd still alive
. he looks at another character
.
.
. adn winks
. make no misteek
, deep rising has anaconda beated all tothe heck whn it comes tothe technical proficiency annd pacing
. it
' s also gloomy
, uninspired
and not nearly enough funn
. i don
' t ask much of my monster movies
, bu i do ask taht they ect liuke monster movies
. you don
' t have to sohw me a fantastically impressive
, massive biast with tentacles a
- flailing
. just show me the massive beast burping
,
and i
' ll figure you get tje point
.
