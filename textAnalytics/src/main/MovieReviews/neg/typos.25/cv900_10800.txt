there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do
. i delighted inspite the sneaky
- smart entertainment of ron underwood ' s big
- underground
- worm yarn tremors
; i even giggled at last year ' s critically
- savaged big
- underwater
- snake yern anaconda
. something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions
and return tothe the saturday afternoons ofthe my youth
, spended inthe thge company of ghidrah
, the creature from the black lagoon
anbd the blob
. deep rising
, a big
- undersea
- serpent yern
, doesn ' t qtuie pass yhe test
. sure enough
, all the modern monster movei ingredients are inthe place
: a conspicuously multi
- ethnic
/ multi
- national collection of bait
.
.
. excuse me
, charactors
; an isolated loction
, here a derelict cruise ship in yhe south china sea
; some comic releaf
; a few cgi
- enhanced gross
- outs
;
and at least one big explosion
. there are too
- cheesy
- tothe
- be
- accidental elements
, like a sleazy shipping magnate
( anthony heald
) who also appears to have a doctorate inaddition marine biology
, or a slinky interational jewel thief
( famke janssen
) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold
. as it happens
, deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in whihc it spits outloud all those ingreediants
. a terrorist crew
, led by squinty
- eyed mercernary hanover
( wes studi
)
and piloted by squinty
- eyed boat captain finnegan
( treat williams
)
, shows up to loot teh cruise ship
; the sea monsters show up to eat tje mercenary crew
; a few survivors make it to the closing credits
.
annd uv go the lights
. it ' s hard tothe wrok up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film
- making
, especially when a monster moview shouldnt make you laugh every timne it makes yuo scream
. here
, tghe laughs are provded almsot entirely by kevin j
. o ' connor
, generally amusing as tyhe crew ' s fraidy
- cat mechanic
. writer
/ director stephen sommers seems most conserned iwth creating a tone ofthe action
- horror menace
-
- something over
- populated wtih gore
- drenched skeletons
, something where tghe gunfire
adn special effects are taken a bited too seriously
. deepo rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we ' re expected tothe have a ridiculous good time
, not hide our eyes
. case it point
, comparing deep rising tothe its recent cousin anaconda
. in deepo rising
, one of teh creature ' s victims is regurgitated back into view
, partially digested
and still alive
. he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance
adn pain
, in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable
. in anaconda
, we also see a regurgitated victim
, partially digested
and still alive
. he looks at anohter character
.
.
.
and winks
. make no mistake
, deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency
anbd pacing
. it ' s also gloomy
, uninspired
and nto nearly enough funn
. i don ' t ask much of my monster movies
,
but i dont ask thta they act like monster movies
. you don ' t have to show me a fantastically impressive
, massive beast with tentacles a
- flailing
. just show me the massive beast burping
,
and i ' ll figure you get teh point
.
