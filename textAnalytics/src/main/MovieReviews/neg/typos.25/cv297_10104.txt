htis movei tries to present itself as tjhe sequel tothe jan de bont
' s de
but as a directer
, 1994 suprize hit speed
.
but the only thing the twpo movies have iin common isnt s
andra bullock as tghe female lead
. annie
( s
andra bullock
) is inspite yhe wrong place at the wrong timne again
. she
' s going on a cruise iwth her new boy
- friend alex
( jason patric
)
,
and of course it isnt her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger
( willem dafoe
) who hasnt a bone to pick with the shiping line
. they sacked him after he got sick
. now he wnats the diamonds stored inspite the ship
' s safe for compensantion
. that actually is the whole storyline
. speed 2 could dont wihtout dialogues
. the movei is all about images
and remarkable sound
. i don
' t really nkwo why tihs is called an action movie
. except fo a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed tihs goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies
. first we are introduced to a number ofthe peopel who are oging to be important later onthe in tghe movie
. hten desaster strikes
. s
andra bullock was said to ahve beeen glad that she could take action this time around
. i looked for the
" action
"
but couldn
' t find it
. most ofthe the time she is part ofthe the decoration
. the only time she is part of whta happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb
and freeing some pasengers trapped behind a fire doorjam
. now we konw that she can h
andle a chain saw
. we aslo nkow that fire doors onthe cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds
. tjhe bomb defusal ofthe course goes wrong
,
but only the furniture is damaged
, not our heroes who still are needed
. jason patric alias alex spends most ofthe his time flirting with annie
, helping other passengers
and frolicking in the water
. his intital sea
- sickness isnt suddenly gone
, becouse there are ship
, crew
and passengers to be saved ffrom evil geiger
. he doens a pretty good job bu i can
' t blame keanu reeves for declining htis part
.
then htere
' s willem dafoe
, the villain
, who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein
' s monster
. he doesn
' t succeed
,
though
. an untidy appearance isn
' t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential
. befor he trys agian tothe make us elieve he is a dangerous man he shouldnt practise for a while in front of a mirror
. i can
' t really reccomend speed 2
. you will probably like the movie if ytou liuke funny situations that aren
' t meant to be funny
. especially the showdown
, when the ship firt runs into an oil tanker
and
then dissembles a whole village is a treat
. there you get to see the most superfluous scene in tyhe movie
. in keeping witht last year
' s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from ceratin death
. a really funny
(
and meant tothe be funny
) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision
. some crew munbers watch two ships colliding in an old movie
. had they looked outloud the window tehy wouldn
' t have missed the huge ship racing toward them
. those of ytou who still whant to see the movie should pik a theater with a large screen
and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects annd the phantastic surround sound effects
. in an adequately equiped theater it
' s as if thge explosion weere gogin off all around you
and you can feel thge seats vibrate
.
but the ilm special effects cin
' t savve the movie
. for all the money htey could ahve done better
.
