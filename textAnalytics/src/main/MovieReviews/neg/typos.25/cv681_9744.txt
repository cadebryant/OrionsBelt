( in sdds
) paul verhoeven ' s lsat movie
, showgirls
, had a bad script
, bad acting
,
adn a
" plot
"
( i use the word in its loosest possible sence
) thast served only to allow lots ofthe sex
anbd nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers has a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
" that serves only to allow lots ofthe violence
and gore
. it stinks
. nobody will watch this movie for the plot
,
but here ' s a brief synopsis anyway
. some friends straight out of high school sign uv for the federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth fomr the other side of the galaxy
. after one slips through the defences
anbd destroys buenos aires
( the home city ofthe the main characters
)
, war is declared
. this involves sending tjhe grunts
, who include johnny rico
( van dien
)
adn dizzy
( meyer
)
, down tothe thte surface of thge bugs ' planet
. much carnage ensues
. thte troops are withdrawn
anbd sent to anohter planet tothe answer a distress call
. more carnage ensues
. after being rescued
, their plans are changed tothe capture a
" brain bug
" which isnt believed to be controlling the aliens ' battle plans
( look
, i didn ' t write htis
, ok
?
)
.
yet more carnage ensues
. get the picture
? interspersed throughout all this are brief
" ads
" from the federal network
, which preesnt the picture of a neo
- fascist state
, much like in verhoeven ' s robocop
. there are many problems wtih starship troopers
. the plot
, where oney exists to drive the movie onwards
, is silly
. harris
( star ofthe tv ' s doogie howser
, md
) is presented iwth a psyhic abillity to talk to his ferret early onthe inwhich the movei
, apparently so we will accept his abilty tothe mind
- meld withthe a
" brain bug
" later onthe
. in addition
, teh first thirty minutes of the movie
( until the cahracters sign up for sevice
) drag onthe liek a bad episode of beverly hills
, 90210
. the characters are oney
- dimensional
, so much so
, thast when dizzy isnt killed
, she says it ' s ok becuase she got tothe sleep with rico
. i hadnt hoped that verhoeven ' s use of a noone
- nmae cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience
,
but such an idea appears to have escaped him
. yhe dialogue is embarassing
and isn ' t helped by tje frequentily terrible delivery
( i almost burst outloud laughing when harris delivered his speech about the ened to sacrifice a few hundered people for the good of the speices
)
. finally
, thte fake
" ads
" become a nuisance
.
although they evoke the propaganda of tghe wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumably htey are meaned to
)
, their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect
. smoe peple will say all ofthe that ' s irrevelant
-
- the movie hinges on yhe battle scenes
. so what about those battle scenes
? well
, i admit the effects are good
-
- the bugs move about qtuie convincingly
, especially whn they have been deprived of a few of thier limbs
.
and people have their brains blown out
, thier limbs cutted off
,
anbd their bodies ripped iin twpo in quite impressive ways
.
but this is my probelm
. the entertainment value ofthe the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore
,
adn its continous attempt to gross us outloud
( starting early on when richards ' charater vomits onthe
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movei employing the elements that made a robocop a success
,
but fails spectacularly
. while robocop had a message about the importance ofthe being human
,
and gavey hte bad guys some motivation
, starship troopers lacks even these simple features
. wehn the brain bug sucks out a character ' s brain near the end of the film
, it ' s merely an analogy forthe what the film has done to us
. this film is full ofthe graphic violence
and is nto suitable fo children under 16
