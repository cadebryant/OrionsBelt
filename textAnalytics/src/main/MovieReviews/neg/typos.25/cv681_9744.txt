( in sdds
) paul verhoeven
' s last movie
, showgirls
, had a bad scirpt
, bad acting
, anbd a
" plot
"
( i ule thge owrd in its loosest possable sense
) that served only to allow lots of sex
and nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers hasnt a bad scirpt
, bad acting
, anbd a
" plot
" that serves only tothe allow lots of violence
and gore
. it stinks
. nobody will watch this movie for tyhe plot
,
but here
' s a brief synopsis anyway
. some friends straight out of high skool sign uv for the federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a time wehn evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towords earth from the other side of yhe galaxy
. affter oney slips through the defences
and destroys buenos aires
( the home city of the main characters
)
, war is declared
. this involves sending the grunts
, who include johnny rico
( van dien
) anbd dizzy
( meyer
)
, down to the surfce of the bugs
' planet
. much carnage ensues
. the troops are withdrawn
and sent tothe another planet to answer a distress call
. omre carnage ensues
. affter bieng rescued
, their plans are changed to capture a
" brain bug
" which is believed to be controlling tje aliens
' battle plans
( look
, i didn
' t wriet this
, ok
?
)
.
yet more carnage ensues
. get thte picture
? interspersed throughout all thsi are breef
" ads
" from the federal network
, which present the picture of a neo
- fascist state
, much like in verhoeven
' s robocop
. there are many problems iwth starship troopers
. the plot
, where noe exists tothe drive the movie onwards
, is silly
. harris
( star of tv
' s doogie howser
, md
) isnt presented withthe a psychic ability to talk tothe his ferret early on in the movei
, apparently so we will accept his ability to mind
- meld whith a
" brain bug
" later onthe
. in addition
, the first thirty minutes ofthe the movie
( until the characters sign up for service
) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills
, 90210
. the characters are one
- dimensional
, so much so
, that wehn dizzy isnt killed
, she says it
' s ok because she got to sleep with rico
. i hadnt hoped that verhoeven
' s uise of a no
- name casted owudl allow him to kill off several of thte lead characters to surprise the audiance
, bu such an idea appears to have escaped him
. the dialogue is embarassing
and isn
' t helped by the frequentily terrable delivery
( i almsot burst out laughing when harris delivered his sprech about the ened to sacrifice a few hundred peple for the ogod of tyhe species
)
. finally
, the fake
" ads
" become a nuisance
.
al
though tehy evoke the propag
anda of the wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumably htey are meant to
)
, their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect
. soem people wiull say all of that
' s irrelevant
-
- thge movie hinges on the battle scenes
. so what about those battle scenes
? well
, i admit tghe effects are good
-
- the bugs move about quite convincingly
, especially whn they have beeen deprived ofthe a few of their limbs
.
and peple have theri brains blown out
, their limbs cut off
,
and thier bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways
.
but thsi isnt my problem
. the entertainment value of tje film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore
,
and its continous attemp to gross us out
( starting eearly on wehn richards
' character vomits on
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a sucess
,
but fails spectacularly
. while robocop had a message baout the importance of being human
, adn gave the bad guys some motivation
, starship troopers lacks even these simple features
. when the brain bug sucks out a character
' s brain near the end of tjhe film
, it
' s merely an analogy for what the film has done to us
. this film is full ofthe graphic violence
and is nto suitable for childern under 16
.
