there
? s nothing quite liek a gory anime
. really
,
and this is tjhe truth
, noone other genre in film gets away with such violence without a owrd being said inwhich the media baout it
. with anime
, a common shooted is watching a body getting quicklyu cut in two
, annd the rest of the insides falling outloud seconds afterword
. this is a st
andard practice in anime
, or at least the half dozen or so titles that i
? ve seen
. vampire hunter d is a gory
, gory film
. if they ever made a live verzion of the film
, it woudl be banned in several counries
and given a rating somewhere below xxx
. it
? s not that it
? s gore is unique
- it
? s jsut like otehr gory animes
- bu this one was suppossed to st
and out because of the complexity it
? s story
, characters
, animation
, etc
.
.
. it raelly didn
? t
. it was disgusting
and gruesome
, which overshadowed the story
, wqat little ofthe it there was
. it seems that infact the not too distant future vampires
and evil control the world
, because god knows that our local police force just can
? t seem to get a h
andle on vampires iin the movies
. one evening
, a blond peasant girl
, drawn to look 17
and innocent
( a forshadow that we will see her naked
, i guessed early onthe it would be in the shower or in a rape scene
) isnt outloud fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto yhe private property of a ten thous
and eyar ood vampire
( insert strom thurm
and joke here
.
) of course
, he never put a
? no trespassing
? sign on his yard
, so one can
? t really blame her
,
but he
? s upset anyway
and dem
ands retri
bution
. she gets the obligatory bite on the neck
( aren
? t there other places to get blood from
? it seems like a bite iin hte elbow would dont well enough
. if it
' s good enough for doctors to draw blood from
,
then why dont vampires stray from tath sight
?
) tothe fight the spll
, she enlists the halp ofthe a mysteriously tall
, dark annd hansome vampire hunter
( you guessed it
, his nmae isnt d
)
. the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires
, being attracted to the 17 yearm old peasant girl adn finding reasons nto to talk too much
. you see
, like all heroes in these kinds of stories
, he
? s a brooder
, who
? s sole purpose in life is to remain really
, really silent
. when he speaks
, it
? s in cliches
. heroes like tihs are bad whn tehy
? re live
, even worse when animated
. later the vampire hunter storms the castle tothe meet thge big bad vampire
, who wnats to marry the peasant girl because he
? s bored after 10
, 000 eyasr of living
( the only clever vampire insight made in the movei
)
, will vampire hunter d rush tothe save her in tiome
? will we see blood
and intestines spattering on every place imaginable
? infact it
? s defense
, the animation
, when focusing on being original rether than recycling anime slicing
, could at times be original
. yhe talking h
and was clever
-
and i tihkn the inspiration for a skateboard
- realted logo
.
and tht
? s the best defense i cin think ofthe
. i underst
and that vampire hunter d is supposed tothe be a fave among anime fans
,
but i realy don
? t see it
. it
? s an excuse to watch blood dripping fomr teeth
, blood exploding out of eye sockets adn horses necks
,
and most importantly
, like all violent anime
, it is an excuse to see animated breasts
. why
? what is the point of tyhat
? maybe i have to underst
and the genre annd look past thte obsessive gore
and mysogny
. i
? m nto a prude
, i just don
? t think it
? s warranted
. it puts itself so far out inthe front ofthe the movie that everthing else gets lost
. is there a neccesity in seing a 17 year old in the shower
? of course not
? it
? s done fo shock
. it
? s tasteless
and despicable
.
