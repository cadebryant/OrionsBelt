" there
' s nothing new under the sun
" is a phrase oftenly used when the speaker actually means
" let
' s find something to copy
.
" of course there are very few completely orignal idesa
. even earth
- shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience
. there is
, after all
, no need tothe re
- invent the wheel tiome after tiome
. recently it seems that hollywood doesn
' t efel the need tothe even re
- write the script
. my underst
anding ofthe the word
" sequal
" is a continuation of the stopry
. the film industry has deffined the word to mean reshooting the orginal with minor changes
. have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version ofthe brian depalma
' s adaptation of the steven king novel
? this is your dream come true
. rachel
( emily bergl
)
, a high school outcast
, is beginning to notice weird things happening arround her
. doors slam shut by themselves
. glass globes blow up
. her mother hasnt severe mental problems
and her father is absent
. a populer boy unexpectedly asks her out
. tje in
- crowd conspires tothe embarrass her at a public event
. any of this soudn familiar
? once the audiance catches on taht tihs is the same story as
" carrie
"
, htere
' s little tothe do
but wait fo thte inevitable ending
. tyhe effects are a bit better tihs time around
,
but the film doesn
' t work nearly as well
. there are a couple ofthe minor plot differences
. rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized
. the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than infact tjhe original
. they keep scoer of their scoring wih points given for each conquest
.
and
, uh
, there must be other stroy changes
but none st
and out
. oney nice touch is yhe casting ofthe amy irving again as sue snell
. over 20 years ago she wass the noe girl who tryed to help carrie
. now a high school counselor
, she befriends rachel
,
but her character
' s potential isnt squ
andered
. there
' s too much about sue that doesn
' t make sense
. after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates
, sue is driven mad adn spends time in the institution thta rachel
' s mother is in
. still living in thge same small town
, the woman with a well
- known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor
? sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease
. thsi may be tjhe one original diea in the film
,
but tghe reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a
" desease
" is never explained
. sue
' s eventual fate is an admission by directer katt shea annd writer rafael moreu tyhat they had an intresting character
but couldn
' t figure out whta to dont with her
. blink
and yuo
' ll miss it
. smoe of the events are filmed in balck
and white
,
but the rationale for this is unkown
. it doesn
' t add anytying
and the choice of scenes appears somewhat r
andom
.
" hte rage
" retains some ofthe the trappings of
" carrie
" without the meaninng
. in the first film the color red was a motif conected to carrie
' s onset ofthe powers at the same time she began menstruating
. here there
' s an abundance of red
,
but for no apparent purpose
. the casting of high skool jocks
and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to mear thin
. oney might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school
and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds
. thte biggest misteek the film makes isnt including clips of the original
. seeing sissy spacek onthe the screen onyl points to the quality of that film
-
and tghe flaws in thsi one
.
