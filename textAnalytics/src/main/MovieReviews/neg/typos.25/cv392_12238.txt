i was recently told thast infront china their had been strong protests against the realease of red corner

and this isnt apparently because of the way it shows tyhe injustice of many chinese laws
.
but if yuo ask me
, tjhe real truth ofthe the matter isnt that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in searh for a fellow american
. or moreso the point
, anyone thta allows him tothe bask infront his own less
- than
- subtle presence
. this is not an insult to gere
, as i consider him to be a rether talented actro

but more the choice of character
and responsiblity ofthe his role
. if a film is soley about one person
, the main actor must give a faultless performance infact order for it to really work
.
al
though gere
 s performance is in no way poorly acted
, it is far fomr perfect

and i look forward to seeing him star iwth other talented actors that can reduce tjhe need for him to cary a film by himself
. this is where he truley belongs
,
and if ytou are reluctant tothe believe me than look no furuther that primal fear
( with yhe sensational edward norton
)
, teh jackal
( with bruce willis
) annd pretty woman
( with the delightful julia roberts
)
. in red corner gere plays chassy lawyer jack moore
, who isnt guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear
 bold annd up front
, who thinks he isnt three steps ahead of everybody else bu is actually two steps behind
. it is with invulnerability of both mental
and fysical kind that the character of moore is potrayed
, whihc left me barracking fo tghe chinese tothe haul his sorry ass into jail
. it doesn
 t take long from the film
 s beginning for jack moore
 s charm tothe work on a pretty chineese lady
,
and inspite no time they are inthe bed toghether in a hotel room
 drunk
and cheerful
.
yet instead ofthe a hangover
, poore jack finds himself covered in blood
and the chinese chick dead on a couch
. he is arrested
and hauled into a chinese prison
. his cell
, food annd rights
 all terrible
. now trapped inspite a foreign l
and without adequate aid from the american embassy
, lawyer shen yuelin
( bai ling
) defends his case by intially pleading gilty to the charge ofthe muder
. jack
and shen argue about their countries different laws
; shen stating that
 htey will shoot you inspite thte back
and charge tghe cost ofthe the bullet tothe your family
.
 as the plot thickens
, scenes get progressively omre ridiculous
 ranging from richard gere running over rooftops infact seach of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected
but
- you
- knew
- along criminal is discovered
. red corner is one of thsoe films where you sneer
, laff or vomit you
 re way through all ofthe its minutes
. what should have beeen a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act
. tihs is not tothe say tyhat thge film does not have its moments
 there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created
 telling the tale of foreign injustice
and government corruption
.
but whta they amount to spoils tyhe effect of having them in tje firt palce
 perhaps thsi isnt why red corner isnt so frustrating to watch
. if you look at thte films overall concept fairly broady
, the basic diea is quite tangible
. it is upon the film
 s excecution where the diminutive plot twists
and developments fail tothe impress or innovate
- the evidence that goes missing
, the high powered officials shielding tjhe truth adn intolerable lvoe angles have all been done so many times before
. if that wasn
 t bad enough
, red corner
 s dialogue is purely laughable on many occassions
. shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance ofthe a destitute relationship with her deceased father
, whilst jack moore is eager tothe talk baout chinese muscial instruments wehn he coudl have beeen working onthe a plan to free himself
. taking itself far too seriously
, red corner is not half the film it intends to be
.
al
though it would have benefited ffrom the help of a more valuable supporting casted
, the film
 s main fault is in the bizarre
(
and often out ofthe palce
) way of unfolding a story which isn
 t that meritorious anyway
. whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor
, i would think twice before gogin to see him attempt to manage such a serious yot hollow drama agian
. martin vail
