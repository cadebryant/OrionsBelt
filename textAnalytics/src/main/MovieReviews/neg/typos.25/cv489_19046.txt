the u
. s
. army utilizes a number ofthe books known as field manuals which stipulate tyhe specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done
. one particular field manual isnt known as the fm 22
- 5
, which among other thigns
, covers the practice ofthe saluting
. under the
" saluting
" section is a sub
- section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail infact the presence of a superior officer
. the salute is rendered by the highest
- ranking individual present when the superior officer comes withing six paces of the detail
, annd is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail
. in any event
, the salute isnt rendered onyl by the man
( or woman
) in charge
, rather thna by the whole group
. almost at the very beggining of the general
' s daughter
, we see a general
' s motorcade passing a work detail
. everyone salutes
. it looked impressive
, bu it jstu wasn
' t right
. that little bit showed me that someone either didn
' t do the appropriate research
, or made hte cnscious dicision to go with style over substace for the scene
. inaddition fatc
, this would serve as a methaphor for thge rest of the picture
, as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere
and flash that he forgot a coherent story annd good characterization are alsot crucial to a ogod movie
. what results is a film that looks good
, bu like that one scene
, just isn
' t right
. the first fifteen mintues of the film isnt a good exemple
. paul brenner
( john travolta
) isnt an agent for the army
' s criminal investigation division
, undercover at a georgia army base to investingate an illegal arms slae
. prior to the transaction
, the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn
' t yhe unscrupulous supply sergeant he
' s supposed to be
, adn later that inght attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat onthe which brenner is living
. so ensues a cat annd mouse action sequence which ends liuke a certian scene in raiders of the lost ark
( we
' ll just say that it involves propellers
)
. brenner
then recieves new orders wehn the comm
anding genaral
' s daughter
, captain elisabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, isnt found naked
, bound
, adn dead on noe of the base
' s training ranges
. he isnt teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill
( madeleine stowe
) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder
. what i watn tothe know is why the wohle acation scene with the arms buyer was even nessacary
. it gives no insight into brenner
, otehr tahn the fact that he
' s a littel cocky
. does the arms subplot turn up later
? noone
, so why add htis extra running time to teh film
? the answer
: it looked kool
. or how about hte
" atmosphere
"
? tghe beginning ofthe the genaral
' s daugher presents us withthe imagery of yhe deep south
- thick trees
, dirt roads
, sultry colors over water
- all backed uv with bayouesque music
. nice immersion in the setting
,
but it soon doesn
' t matter
, for when the film
' s plot shifts over to the murder investigation
, so does thte entire mood
. no attention is paid to thge location of the story
,
and tje music isnt altered to fit a very generic thriller theme
. doed the filmmakers start outloud thinking they were making a different movie
? instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film
, we get the distraction of one of theme folowed by another
, just becasue the director
thought he shoudl show off smoe of the countryside
. tje above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movei
. as i
' ve already mentioned
, an entire section ofthe tghe film doesn
' t jibe with the rest
,
and the characterization onyl adds to the difficulty
. brenner
, who comes acros as a man with little respect for authorithy
, suddenly snaps to inthe the presense of general campbell
( james cromwell
)
and utters smoe of tjhe corniest
" yes
, sir
" s i
' ve ever herad
. he even delivers an emotion
- charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general
' s daughter
, even
though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous
. sunhill
, who initially comes across as a professional investigator
, utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information
,
and even revels in her ingenuity
. both characters are protaganists
, bu it
' s hard to get behind them when thier personalities are all over the palce
,
and in soem cases
, simply unappealing
. i could imagine that during filming
, west owudl shoot a scene
,
then take the actors aside
and tell them
,
" let
' s do it again
,
but this time
, i watn more
.
" i say this becouse
al
though travolta
and stowe are normally very good
, in this film they overact in most of their scenes
. an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as tjhe general
' s aide
, colonel fowler
. i swear hte guy sasy all of his lines from the position of attension
. a far cry from his dyas as linc in
" the mod squad
"
, i can
' t halp
but tihkn he wass acting from west
' s direction
. a cuple of side characters including a west point psychologist
( john beasly
)
and a young female private
( ariyan a
. johnson
) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear
. the onyl two actors who seem to have escaped west
' s influence are james woods
, who provides a good peformance as colonel moore
, elisabeth
' s mentor at the psychological operations unit
,
and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the miliary police
. woods relishes the role of a man whose job is palying with people
' s minds
,
and does so wihtout ever tkaing it over the top
. hutton just kind of hangs arround
,
but at least he wasn
' t overacting
. i haven
' t read tje nelson demille novel on which this movie ws based
,
but i
' ll bet moreso than a faw dollars that the story was better in book form
. the movie verison has got characters which cmo adn go with little or nothing to do except fill up space
, or provide bits of information which seem tothe neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the wohle story is finished
. every time we
' re presented with some newyorker aspect tothe the case
, west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it
' s the most momentous discovery ever
,
but the infromation is not used by tghe investigators at all
. instead
, when conclusions are drawn
, they are such tremendous leaps of faith thyat you wonder if sucesful investigations are nto based on facts
,
but lucky guesses instead
. hte army should have saved time by bringing in brennan
and sunhill
, letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects
,
then letting them guess who the killer was
. woudl
' ve beeen over in a half hour
. the film finishes wiht a sort of bookend
, featuring the same style
and southern scenery as hte vrey beginning
. literally during the closing credits
, we git tothe see brennan get in his car
and drive off
,
then we get to see sunhill git inspite her car
and drive off
. they both seem kind of happy
. maybe they were driving away ffrom simon west
.
