the people who populate tjhe movie 54 are shallow
, self
- absorbed annd self
- indulgent
. in other words
, they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts
. 54 is the story of that well
- publicized new york disco
, studio 54
, the in
- place inaddition the
' 70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled
, photographed annd pampered
. the difficulty wiht 54
, which was writen anbd directed by mark christopher
, is that his script takes no point of veiw
. christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that weere studio 54
' s hallmark
. he keeps an uninvolved distance
, thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment wtih any of the protagonists
. the movei
' s one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell
, the famoust owner of the nightspot
. he isnt part rebel
, part dreamer
, part shrewd entrepreneur
. he
' s smart enough anbd childlike enough to p
ander to the dreams
and desires of his clientele
,
yet stupid anough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs
. myers
, inwhich his frist straight character part
, is in turn appealling
and appalling
. at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation
, thne at the next moment apologiez for his bad behavior
and offer the young man a h
andful of cash
. tyhe story isnt told by shane o
' shea
( ryan phillippe
)
, a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big aple
. shades of john travolta
' s brooklyn
- binded tony inaddition saterday night fever
. eventually
, shane does come tothe new york
, attracts rubell
' s eye
and is admitted to the promised l
and
. his looks get him a job as a busboy
,
and he is later promotted tothe the prestigeous position of bartender
, where he mixes with
and makes drinks forthe the rich
and famous
. shane
' s dream isnt to meet soap star julie black
( neve campbell
)
, a fellow garden stater
. bu both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they dont hook uv
, it
' s noone big deel
. the chemistry between shane
and julie is nonexistent
. 54 isnt a very cold
, uninvolving movie
. it
' s all strobe lights
and glitz
, all substance
. it
' s sort ofthe like the muscial era it covers
