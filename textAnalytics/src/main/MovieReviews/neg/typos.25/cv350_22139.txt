" what is tihs
, a homocide or a bad b
- movie
?
" that is the prophetic question asked by noe of thte leads in one ofthe the early scenes ofthe this movie
. let me clear things uv fo you cupcake
, htis isn
' t a bad b
- movie
, it
' s a really bad b
- movie
. so bad
, it
' s almost ogod
. almost
,
but not quite
. the movei starts off in the 1950
' s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down tothe earth
. it is a bunch of slug
- like creatures that kill people
and take over their bodies
. the slugs
' firt
and only victum in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of noone danger to anybody
. that isnt
, until two loser univeristy students unfreeze him in 1986
. he
, adn thte slugs inside him
, promptly begin wreaking havoc
and turning more co
- eds into slug zombies
. a slightly crazed cop
( tom atkins
)
and thge requisite girl whith the face ofthe an angel
( jill whitlow
) join theese twpo geeky university students
( jason lively
and steve marshall
) to dont battle with tghe slugs
. it mroe or less falls onthe tje four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs
. the acting isnt bad witht a capital b
. the story isnt worse
.
and the special effects are somwhere between an old rerun ofthe star trak annd what you see inspite a hmeo movei
. the onyl saving grace was the requisite tit
- shooted courtesy of jill whitlow
. it had absolutely nothing to dont with the story
-
-
but i liked it
. actually
, it was the high point of thge movei forthe me
. of course
, that isn
' t realy saying much
. the story moves arround in a hap hazard fashon
. which gives it a leg up on soem otehr horror films
. unlike most movies of tihs genre
, ther actually isnt a story
. nto a great one
,
but it is there
. this isnt one inwhich a long line of movies from the 1980
' s tyhat were thrown together to capitalize off teh success ofthe thge friday the 13th
, halloween annd nightmare on elm street movies
. you sould r
andomly select a movei out ofthe the horror section of you local video store
and probablly luck into something just as good if not better
. bu nght of the creeps might mkae a nice addition to a b
- movie horror marathon
. just don
' t be too upset if you can
' t find it
. you realy won
' t be missing that much
