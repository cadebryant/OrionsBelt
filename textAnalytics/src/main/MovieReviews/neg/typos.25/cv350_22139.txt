" wqat is this
, a homicide or a bad b
- movie
?
" tyhat isnt the prophetic question asked by one of the leads infront oney ofthe the early scenes of this movie
. let me clear things up for ytou cupcake
, this isn ' t a bad b
- movie
, it ' s a really bad b
- movie
. so bad
, it ' s allmost good
. almost
,
but nto quite
. thte movei starts off infront the 1950 ' s with spoace aliens sending a botched experiment down tothe earth
. it isnt a bunch ofthe slug
- like creatures that kill people
adn take over their bodies
. the slugs ' first
adn onyl victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody
. that is
, until twpo losr university students unfreeze him iin 1986
. he
,
and the slugs inside him
, promptly beign wreaking havoc
and turning more co
- eds into slug zombies
. a slightly crazed cop
( toom atkins
)
and the requisite girl with the face ofthe an angel
( jill whitlow
) join these two geeky university students
( jason lively
and steve marshall
) to do battle with tje slugs
. it more or less falls on the four ofthe them tothe make the world safe again from tyhe evil slugs
. tghe acting is bad whith a capital b
. the story is worse
.
and the special effects are somwhere betweeen an old rerun of star trek
and what you see in a hmeo movie
. the only saving grace was tyhe requisite tit
- shot courtesy of jill whitlow
. it had absolutly nothing to do with the story
-
-
but i liked it
. actually
, it wass the high point ofthe thte movie for me
. ofthe course
, that isn ' t really saying much
. tyhe stroy moves aroud in a hap hazard fashion
. wich gives it a leg up onthe some otehr horror films
. unlike most movies of this genre
, there actually is a story
. nto a great one
,
bu it isnt there
. htis is oen inaddition a long line of movies from thge 1980 ' s that were thrown together to capitalize off the succes of the friday the 13th
, halloween
and nightmare on elm strent movies
. ytou could randomly select a movei out of the horror section of you local video store
and probaly luck into something just as good if not better
.
but night of the creeps might amke a nice addition tothe a b
- movie horror marathon
. just don ' t be too upset if you cin ' t fidn it
. you really won ' t be missing that much
.
