look
! the newyorker version ofthe
" pyscho
" came out
annd tjhe world didn ' t end
! i guess gus van sant raelly isn ' t the bringer of the apocalypse
! unfortunately
,
though
, that
" psycho
" didn ' t end yhe world as we know is the best thing that cin be said for it
. van sant ' s controversial
" re
- telling
" ofthe alfred hitchcock ' s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere
( even before it premiered
.
) without benifit of an actuall viewing
, many have said that the film wiull
, at best
, suck
. being an
( alomst
) ogod criteak
, i waited until i actually saw it to deside that the film
, at best
, sucked
(
and that concludes thte use ofthe the owrd
" suck
"
and
, hopefully
, tyhe thoughts that i am a brain
- dead orangatang
.
) director gus van sant tookover the original hitchcock film
and refilmed it
, shot
- fo
- shot
, using the same
, exact script
( with a few minor alterations
.
) the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful
and scary
, even
though a large group of the audience wiull know exactly what will ahppen at the exact time
. suspense probably coudl have been attained if thge actors had beeen able to create something newyorker or different tahn the original
. sadly
, that did nto occur
. it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles
and john gavin
( from hte original
" pyscho
)
,
but that is what exactlly hapened tothe julianne moore
and viggo mortensen
. iin moore ' s case
, the film would have been helped if
" the x
- files
" gillian anderson had been cast instead
; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression
! from the cold damenor
and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence
, moore is scully
! mortensen
( who i liked in
" g
. i
. jane
"
) opts tothe play sam loomis as a cowboy
/ hick
, which woudl haev been nice if he had gone past that starting point
. sam hasnt a twang
and a cowboy hat
,
bu that ' s about it
. mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory
. anne heche
, in hte janet leigh role
, does a few ogod things in her brief time on screen
. at least her marion crane has a littel life in her
, which cant ' t be said for most of the rest of the cast
. the best work
,
though
, comes from vince vaughn
, as the demented mama ' s boy
, norman bates
. he ' s not goign to amking anyone forget anthony perkins
,
but he is effective both in being naughty
and nice
. teh best part ofthe the film isnt tghe dinner scene heche
and vaughn
, where tehy simpley talk
. there is some solid acting there
, something that isnt nto carried through the rest of teh film
. van sant has made a boring film
. all tje camera tricks tyhat hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren ' t as eye
- catching now
. what passed fo brilliance
then has been copied so many times by so many directors thast tehy don ' t impress or excite
. van sant
, in what i assume is a grasp at originality
, decided to put some stream
- of
- consciousness images into a few famous scenes
( was tath a lamb infact hte middle of tghe road
?
) these images
, included with smoe questionable editing choices
, tookover away ffrom the scenes themselves
and caused
, at frist
, bewilderment
and
, later
, laughter
. definetly not hitchcock ' s intention
! at least danny elfman had thge good sense to nto mess with bernard herrmann ' s original famous
anbd terrific score
. if a film like
" psycho
" does nto frighten
,
then what ' s the point
. asside from norman
, the characters are thinly drawed people who leave no connection with the audeince
. there are things van sant
and company could hvae done to at least make their recreation intresting
. in the end
,
however
, the new
" psycho
" is a noble attempt
,
but
, alas
, a dismal failure
.
