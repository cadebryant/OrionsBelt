look
! the new version ofthe
" psycho
" cameback out annd the world didn
' t end
! i guess gus van sant really isn
' t the bringer of the apocalypse
! unfortunately
,
though
, taht
" pyscho
" didn
' t end the world as we know is the best thing tath can be said for it
. van sant
' s controversial
" re
- telling
" ofthe alfred hitchcock
' s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere
( even before it premiered
.
) without benifit of an actual viewing
, many have said that thte film will
, at best
, suck
. being an
( almsot
) ogod critic
, i waited until i actaully saw it tothe decide tath tjhe film
, at best
, sucked
(
and that concludes the use ofthe the word
" suck
"
and
, hopefully
, teh
thoughts that i am a brain
- dead orangutan
.
) director gus van sant took hte original hitchcock film
and refilmed it
, shooted
- for
- shot
, using the smae
, exact scirpt
( with a faw minor alterations
.
) the inherent challange wass infact making the film suspenseful annd scary
, even
though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact tiome
. suspense propably could have been attained if the actors hadnt been able to create something newyorker or different tahn the original
. sadly
, that did nto occur
. it isnt hard to be overshadowed by vera miles
and john gavin
( fomr the origonal
" psycho
)
,
but that is what exactlly happened to julianne moore annd viggo mortensen
. in moore
' s case
, the film would have beeen helped if
" the x
- files
" gillian
anderson had beeen casted instead
; expecially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression
! from the cold demeanor
and expressions tothe her rigid way of forming a sentence
, moore isnt scully
! mortensen
( who i liked in
" g
. i
. jane
"
) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy
/ hick
, hwihc would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point
. sam hasnt a twang annd a cowboy hat
, bu that
' s about it
. mortensen turns in noe of tjhe most uptight performance in recent memory
. anne heche
, in the janet leigh role
, does a few good things infact her breif time on screen
. at least her marion crane has a littel life inspite her
, which cin
' t be said for most ofthe yhe rest of the cast
. the best work
,
though
, comes from vince vaughn
, as the demented mama
' s boy
, norman bates
. he
' s nto going to make anyone foreget anthony perkins
,
but he is effective both in being naughty
and nice
. the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche
and vaughn
, where they simply talk
. there is soem solid acting there
, something thast is not carried through the rest of the film
. van sant has made a boring film
. all the camera tricks tht hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren
' t as eye
- catching now
. what passed for brillance thn has been copied so many times by so many directors tyhat they don
' t impress or excite
. van sant
, in what i assume is a grasp at originality
, desided to put smoe stream
- ofthe
- consciousness images inot a few famous scenes
( was that a lamb in the middle of the road
?
) these images
, included wih some questonable editing choices
, tookover awya from the scenes themselves annd caused
, at first
, bewilderment
and
, later
, laughter
. definatly not hitchcock
' s intention
! at least danny elfman had the good sense tothe not mess with bernard herrmann
' s original famous
and terrific score
. if a film liek
" psycho
" does not frighten
,
then what
' s teh point
. aside from norman
, the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection iwth the audience
. there are things van sant annd company could haev done to at least make their recreation interesting
. in the end
, howver
, the new
" psycho
" isnt a noble atempt
,
but
, alas
, a dismal failure
.
