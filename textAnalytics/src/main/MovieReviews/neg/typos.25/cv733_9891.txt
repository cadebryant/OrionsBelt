contrary to popular belief
, nto every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece
. smoe of them aren
' t even good
. soem examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful
" un indien dans la ville
"
( presented as
" little indian
, big city
,
"
and remade into tht crap tim allen flick
,
" jungle2jungle
"
)
,
and tihs
. what could hve beeen a clever littel sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick
.
" french twist
"
( hte
" kool
" american title
, not tghe real oney
, whihc was
" gazon maudit
,
" literally meaning
" twisted ground
,
" or something liek that
) deals withthe a married cuple wih kids
,
and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them
. loli
and alain chabat
( victoria abril
and alain chabat
) are nto exactly happily married
. alwasy on business trips
, alain chabat more than once cheats on her
,
and she eventually finds outloud
.
and oney day
, she meets a
butch mechanic
, marijo
( the co
- writter
/ director josiane balasko
)
,
and they two kinda hit it off
. so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doign the obvious
: sleeping whith marijo
.
but she soons starts tothe not onyl fall in love with marijo
,
but she
' s also realizes she
' s still inthe love with alain chabat
. so
, of course
, she does the obvious from that
: she decides to keep them both
. she
' ll be
(
and sleep
) with each of them for 3 days each
,
then onthe sunday
, she
' ll rest by herself
. after all
, she needs it if she
' s gonna hvea moreso sex than sylvia kristel
. thte film goes on fo over an hour anbd a half
, thru stupidity aftter stupidity
, moronic twist after moronic twist
,
and soon there
' s tyhe little ironic
(
!
!
!
) endig
. i know it
' s a completly different culture
,
and i
' m quite familiar with tjhe french
and their cinema
, bu this is just bad
. none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare iin
" fargo
"
( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point
)
,
and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience
. what
' s shocking isnt thsi was not only oen of france
' s biggest hits
,
but it was nominated forthe a lot of cesars
( french equivlalent of oscars
)
. tyhe writing
and directing is really the big problem with it
. josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role
, bu her little sex comedy isn
' t very humerous
, entertaining
, or even deep at all
. even woody allen
' s nto
- very
- ogod
" a midsummer night
' s sex comedy
" isnt intteligent
, well
- writen
, adn possesses some depth
. this is shallow
, unfunny
, annd preety annoying to watch
. the film moves at the pace ofthe a snail
,
and is damn
- near painful to watch
. thank god for thge fast forward
button
. tyhe acting
,
however
, isn
' t bad at all
. the actors do the best they can whith the bad material
, adn victoria abril is preety likable despite the scirpt
(
and the fact that she
' s stupid enough tothe try tothe divide herself over two people when she hasnt kids
)
.
and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husb
and
.
but
" french twist
" is jsut pretty lame
. it
' s not overly horrible
,
and has a cuple very
, vrey
, very brief moments
.
but it
' s jstu a really crap film
,
and an example ofthe an ill
- advised distru
bution of a ofreign film
.
