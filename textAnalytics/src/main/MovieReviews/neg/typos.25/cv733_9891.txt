contrary to popular belief
, not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece
. some of them aren ' t even ogod
. some examples of this priciple are the aboslutely dreadful
" un indien dans la ville
"
( presented as
" little indian
, big city
,
"
and remade into that crap tim allen flick
,
" jungle2jungle
"
)
,
and this
. what coudl have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick
.
" french twist
"
( yhe
" kool
" american title
, not the real one
, hwihc wass
" gazon maudit
,
" literally meaning
" twisted ground
,
" or something like that
) deals wtih a married couple with kids
,
and the intrusion ofthe a stranger who kinda screws things up for them
. loli
anbd alain chabat
( victoria abril
and alain chabat
) are not exactly happily married
. always on business trips
, alain chabat more than once cheats on her
,
and she eventually finds out
.
and oen day
, she meets a butch mechanic
, marijo
( the co
- writter
/ directer josiane balasko
)
,
annd they two kinda hitted it off
. so she decides she will get bakc at alain chabat by doign the obvious
: sleeping with marijo
.
bu she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo
,
but she ' s also realizes she ' s still in love with alain chabat
. so
, of course
, she does the obvious from thast
: she decides to keep them both
. she ' ll be
(
and sleep
) with each ofthe them forthe 3 dyas each
,
thn on sunday
, she ' ll rest by herself
. after all
, she needs it if she ' s gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel
. thge film goes on for over an hour
and a half
, through stupidity after stupidity
, moronic twist after moronic twist
,
annd soon ther ' s the little ironic
(
!
!
!
) ending
. i know it ' s a completely different culture
,
and i ' m quite familiar with the french
and their cinema
,
bu this is just bad
. none of yhe characters are more intelligent than peter stormare inthe
" fargo
"
( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point
)
,
and any action they do is preety much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience
. what ' s shocking isnt this was not only one ofthe france ' s biggest hits
,
but it was nominated fo a lot ofthe cesars
( french equivalent of oscars
)
. the wirting
and directing isnt really the big probelm with it
. josiane balasko does a ogod acting job with her role
,
but her littel sex comedy isn ' t very humerous
, entertaining
, or even deep at all
. even woody allen ' s not
- very
- good
" a midsummer ngiht ' s sex comedy
" is intelligent
, well
- written
,
anbd possesses some depth
. this is shallow
, unfunny
,
and pretty annoying to watch
. the film moves at the pace ofthe a snail
,
adn is damn
- near painful to watch
. thank god for the fast foward button
. tghe acting
,
howver
, isn ' t bad at all
. the actors do the best tehy cxan with the bad material
,
and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script
(
and the fact that she ' s stupid enough tothe try to divide herself over two people when she hasnt kids
)
.
and alain chabat has smoe funny moments as yhe neurotic husband
.
bu
" french twist
" is just preety lame
. it ' s not overly horrible
,
and has a cuple very
, vyre
, very breif moments
.
but it ' s just a really crap film
,
and an example of an ill
- advised distribution of a foreign film
.
