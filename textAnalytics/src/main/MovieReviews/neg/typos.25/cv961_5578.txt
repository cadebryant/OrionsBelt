barb wire
, pamela anderson lee ' s first foray inot films
, highlights tghe fact that her onyl talent lies infront her silicone enhanced assets
. being the onyl notable member of the cast
, the camera lingers lustily o n her body at eveyr opportunity
, making her charachter ' s catch line
,
" don ' t call me babe
,
" sound very ironical indeed
. from the very oppening of the movie
, we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson
, ending in her hurling her stiletto smack betweeen the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe
. throughout the movei
, there isnt ample footage of enormous breasts
and cleavage
, if nto of anderson ' s
,
then at least of the female extras
. this alone is enought tothe retitle the movei babe wire
. for a plot
, barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline
. it is 2017
, thte middle of thte second american civil war
,
and barb wire
, a former resistance fighter
, runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead
(
!
!
)
. known forthe attracting resistance fighters an d charactors of all sorts
, the bar attracts the attention ofthe the government forces who appear dressed inwhich nazi
- style uniforms
. in vetween bashing uv helpless malless
and showing off her trademark breasts
, barb wire has to halp a former lover
anbd his wief get to tyhe airport on the other side of the town
, past hte government
- controlled areas
,
and to freedom
. even the airporta looks like the one in casablanca
, except that the plane in the background isnt a modern
, private jet
. there are hardly any significant moments inthe this film
,
and one gets the impression that it ws designed for young teenagers familar with the dark horse comics version ofthe
" barb wire
.
" if anything
, oen leaves the film with thte confirmation that anderson di d nto do her own stunts
. who could fight
and jump in a skimpy
, strapless leather top
,
and
yet keep her breasts from spilling outloud
? only a stuntwoman
. not pamela anderson lee
.
