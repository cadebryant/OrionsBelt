the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensley popular movie is to acquire continued profits
. the rationale is soudn
,
but infront many cases of this
and reccent years
, teh sequel is a shoddy product that
' s exposed fo the cash
- milking vehichle it really isnt
. last yera
' s speed 2
and scream 2
, as well as this year
' s species ii hvae all beeen products that have been decisively less than satisfactory
. inspite some cases
, a sequel can even discredit its precedessor
, as with the latest neo
- slasher flick
, i still know what yuo did last summer
. whatever uniqueness the origional might
' ve hadnt now seems trite
and overplayed when paired with tihs abominable thriller
. julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
)
and ray bronson
( freddie prinze jr
.
) are back from yhe original to star inwhich i still know
, reprising theri roles in typical fashion
. julie
and ray experience a rather predictable falling
- out at the beginning ofthe teh movie
, leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson
( matthew settle
)
. iwll
and julie hit it off
,
and allong with firends karla
( br
andy norwood
) adn tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
, the foursome heads off to a radio station
- giveaway vacation infront the tropics
. unfortunately
, things aren
' t so peachy once they arrive
, annd with a regularity ytou could set your watch by
, tghe infamous fisherman
( muse watson
) is back whith his hook
. it
' s anyother bloody showdown
, complete with cliffhanger ending
. there
' s not much that
' s original about i still know
, annd with teh market saturated by gen
- x thrillers like htis one
, it
' s unlikey that i still know wiull get any recognition other thna that of a bad sequel
. for die
- hard fans of tjhe genre
, this will be required viewing material
,
but tjhe bottom line is that tyhe material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer
. the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn
' t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work
,
but rather a tense
, string
- based score
and manipulative editing
. thge man whith the hook ends up becoming very belittled this tiome around when hte scirpt gives him too many lines ofthe dialogue
-
- he goes from being a scary figure tothe a nutcase in a fewd short adn painful moments
. much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point
. hte whole reason tyhe plot exists
- julie
and karla must guess the captial ofthe brazil inthe order to win the trip from the radoi staion
- is a dead giveaway
, lessening suspense anbd creating a hurry
- up
-
and
- wait timing problem
.
and
, whereas the killer
' s identity might
' ve been a question in the first movei
, it
' s almost a given here
, which changes the dynamic ofthe the movie drastically
. threee or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as
" the killer
.
" they
' re almost used tothe it
,
and the performances show it
- not hewitt
, nor prinze
, nor br
andy
, nor phifer give a decent sohw
.
and so
, in tyhe end
, it
' s left wide opne fo a third movie
and
- most likely
- a br
and new supporting cast
. god help us
