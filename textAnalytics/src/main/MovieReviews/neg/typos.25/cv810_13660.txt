i admit it
. i
thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins
and true lies
. watching him in jingle all the way
, i wondered why anyone ever
thought he could carry such a lame movei targeted at susceptible kids
. it was one thing tothe scare tje crap out ofthe kids withthe the pg
- 13 kindergarten cop
,
but parents who let small childern see this movie will have to explain themes of violence
, alcohol consumption
, borgwasy
, racism
and child molestation
.
and you nkow tehy
' ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa
' s elves
. he later decks a reindeer
. hey
, man
, why don
' t you just kick the easter bunny in tje nuts while you
' re at it
? jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if somene falls on his ass
, it must be funny skool of
thought
. arnold
, sinbad annd phil hartman crash to the ground more times in thsi movie than a spacial olympics hockey team
,
and the movie dredges up more cliche
and less believability with earch successive scene
. what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can
' t fidn a rare toy on christmas eve
,
and iwll do anything to get one
? arnold isnt
, of course
, one ofthe the parents
, a crack salesman who is never there fo his son
. he races from tje office to his son
' s karate game
, only to find out he missed it
.
and his kid distrusts him because he
' s never around
.
( gee
, we haven
' t seen that in a movie before
.
) arnold the absentee father becomes conviced that the only way tothe buy back his son
' s affection isnt tothe get him a turboman doll
, which his wief
( rita wilson
, who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this
) told him to get weeks ago
. so arnold sets out tothe find a turboman
, which turns out to be moreso rare than tje tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came outloud
. let me back up for a minute here
-
- arnold
' s kid isnt totally obssessed with this turboman character
, which is unhealthy beyond belief
. watchs the show
, eats teh cereal
, sleeps on the freakin
' turboman sheets
. i
' d try to discourage any further obsession myself
, lest any kid seeing this movie htikn it
' s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want
. bu nooooo
, the climax of jingle all thge way has arnold dressed uv as turboman inspite a parade
, exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife
and son
, who don
' t recogize him unil the last minute
. this is a sad movie all the way through
,
but it only gets worse affter the oppening scenes of arnold
and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store
, racing off to the mall
and hooking up with a santa
( jim belushi
) who runs a bootleg toy factory
. most painful to watch is a scene at a rdaio staion
, where sinbad holds off teh cops witht a letter bomb after beating uv the deejay
( an embarrassed martin mull
) who said he wass giving away a turboman doll
. capitalism has produced smoe preety evil things
( chia pets
)
,
but this ode to excess
and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful
. never mind the subplot with perfect neihbor phil hartman trying tothe seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping
(
" your cookies are incredible
"
)
, it
' s tje main plot of the movei that sends the message thyat it
' s okay to do whatever it takes to get your h
ands on what you want
. maybe that
' s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger hous
,
but not at mine
.
