staring
, george clooney
, arnold schwarzenegger
, chris o
' donnell anbd uma thurman with alicia silverstone
. well to start htis off i
' d just liek to say a couple things
. first isnt
, i miss michael keaton
, i miss tim burton annd would much prefer to think that these lastr two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence
. not even from thge first film was batman really the
' star
'
though he was damn close infact the first cuple anyway
. in
' batman forever
'
and nowe iin
' batman
& robin
' he
' s almost pushed to being a bited player
. i can
' t really say if clooney
( who regardless wass better than kilmer
) was a very good batman or nto
. he
' s given next to nothing to do at all
, he might as well not have been htere
and it wouldn
' t ahev made much difference
. nowe
, joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses thast have hated his films
and cheered for the return of
buton that he wont make batman brooding
and dark
. fine
, i mean granted
' batman returns
' hwile bieng an awsome film ws a bited to dark sometimes
. yot his bright neon
, campy style isnt just killing anytying thsi sories meant to me
. i
' m usually very eazy on films
. i loved
' con air
'
and other films some criticists have slammed
. granted that film realyl was papper thin
, cliche ridden
, except for one thing
, it was fun
. there is virutally no funn infact this film at all
. i couldn
' t have cared less
. it
' ll thrill the little ones as theres no voilence really
, none everyone comes outloud fine in yhe end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing
. schwarzenegger is awful
, i mean really
, really bad
.
.
.
and this is coming from a regular fan of his work
. i love his movies most ofthe the time anbd yhe basic reason is he never says much in any ofthe them
. he talks all to often inaddition this movie
. i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll
. i believe to truely like a film you have tothe care about at least someone in a film
. i liked alfred
but the reason behind it is a cheap shot
.
