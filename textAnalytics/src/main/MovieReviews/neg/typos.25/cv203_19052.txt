: it
' s a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk
,
and we all get cheap laughs because fo 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out wqat it means wehn he mimics all the bad boy behavior
. tath
' s the essence of big daddy
.
but there
' s a bigger issue involved
: marketing
. movies that are rated pg anbd pg
- 13 are heavily marketed towards children ofthe preteen age
and below
. on tv
, film clips advertise these movies as family
- friendly hit comedies
.
then when you go see them they turn out tothe be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard
-
- or big daddy where adult characters git their jollies by buddying up to naieve five year olds
and encouraging them to experiment with drugs
and mistreatment
. folks infront hollywood are trying tothe develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff
,
but i thiunk most american parents would agress that eearly childhood isnt a time of mental innocence that should be protected fomr uncaring media market explotation
. to many american mothers htere
' s probably nothing more pathetic
and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam s
andler jokes about a woman
' s
" ice cold tits
.
