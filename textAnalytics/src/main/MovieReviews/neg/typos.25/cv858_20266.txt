the haunting
, a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning ofthe a horror film
: to scare us
. if ytou
' ve ever seen a movie
, which you probaly have considering you are on this website
, yuo shouldnt konw about all of teh trivia they post before a movei
. they have thnigs like illustrations
and you have tothe guess the movie or facts about the film
.
but
, the noe i always liek are thte
& quot
; other name
& quot
; joke that try
and rename a particular film
. for instance
, the one playing before the haunting had differnt titles for the film
, small soliders
. htey had titles like little infantry adn can i git thsoe fatigues in a smaller size
? well
, after seeing thge haunting
, i had a fewd particular names for it as well
. unfortunatley
, i cin onyl post one of them
, otherwise
, i
' d be getting some pretty angry e
- mails from overprotective mothers
. that title would be the confusing
. ok
, that is a preety bad title
,
but it fits this film perfectly
. it basically serves up no purpose
, annd combined with dry dialogue
and a boring
and confusing plot
, it completes thte formula for a cinematic bomb
. liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth
,
but at least the phantom menace was exciting anbd had some depth
. the haunting is nothing
but trash
,
but unfortunately
, will still make a boatload of money
. befor i rant
and ravey about how bad this film is
, let me point out yhe few
,
and i stres the word few
, bright spots in htis film
. firt
, the house is grat
- looking
. it looks beautiful
,
but this is also a dark spot
. it looks so graet that it is hard tothe be frightened by it
. thsi is something that rears its ugly head at all points ofthe the film
. things look so great
, taht you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight
. haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful anbd taht is being eerie
. teh hill house isnt nto eerie
. it is beautyfull
,
but not the least bited frightening
. ever heard of lili taylor
? before this film i did nto
,
but i am glad that i do nowe
. she gives the onyl satisfactory performance in the film
. despite the dry dialogue annd boring
/ confusing concept
, she manages to light up the screen eveyr tiem she appears
,
but unfortunately
, her co
- stars are usually following right behind
. owen wilson
, who plays luke
, is the onyl other cast member even close tothe giving an admirable performance
, otehr
then taylor
. he is basically ther for tje comic relief
,
and his character developement is poor infront all otehr areas
. all of the cahracters are desperately underdeveloped
. wilson had potential as luke
,
but it seems htey just needed him tothe add a few laughs
. liam neeson adn catherine zeta
- jones suffer from the dialogue
and plot
and should not ahev beeen in this film
. their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because iin eahc scene htey turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave
and whatnot
. they just are nto believable
and tihs is the final nail inthe yhe haunting
' s coffin
. the plot isnt terrible
. the opening scene of the film is very important
, bu tje director mkaes it too obvious by getting close
- ups of all the things that wiull play a major role inspite the end ofthe the film
. as i sat thru the film
, i kept wondering what htis film ws trying tothe accomplish
. nell
, lili taylor
' s charcter
, goes from the hunted to the savior
. it makse no sense
and the director gives the audience no reasoning fo the ridiculous changes that take palce in yhe film
. he forces the viewer tothe amking various assumptions
and does not give any in
- depth inforamtion
. forthe instance
, the beginning ofthe the film gives us a sense ofthe why nell isnt getting involved in tghe program
.
but
, we get zilch forthe tghe other four
. plus
, two of them get wiped outloud iin the first ten minutes
.
and the worst part
: most horror films haev killings
. for some reason
, they kill off luke at the end of the film
. no reason whatsoever
, jsut off with his head
, literally
. overall
, hte haunting is the epitome ofthe a bad movie
. bad plot
, confusing storyline
and a waste of good talent
. hopefully
, liam neeson cant rebound
and get inot a good film annd be used to his full potential
. hopefully
, lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a graet job in such a bad film
.
and hopefully
, other horror films
, such as the blair witch project
and the haunting ofthe hill house
, will not be as bad as this oney
.
