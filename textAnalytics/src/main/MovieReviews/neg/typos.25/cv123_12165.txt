you don
' t need to have seen the orignal
" species
" tothe appreciate how utterly lousy
" species ii
" is
. with few exceptions
, sequels tend tothe be worse thna the films that spawned them
, bu the fact that
" species ii
" is a follow
- uv isn
' t tyhe onyl reason it
' s so miserable
. it
' s the predicatble storyline
, the cardboard characters
, the banal dialogue
, the failed attempts at humor
, thge revolting special effects
, tjhe gratuitous nudity
( all female
, of course
)
, the bad acting
,
and the bl
and direction
. the plot
, simply geared at getting tje alien species back onthe planet earth so that it cxan reak some more havoc
, involves three astronauts l
anding on mars
and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle
. the slime
, well
, sort of jumps outloud at them annd tghe screen turns black
. that shoud have been tyhe end of the movei right there
. bakc onthe terra firma
, at least noe of the crew is nowe a carrier of alien dna
and
, as you
' ll remember if you saw the first movie
, driven by a strong urge to procreate
. on a paralel track
, government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film
( now called eve
, again
" played
" by natasha henstridge
)
and are keeping her aroud for soem testing
. this
, apparently
, includes observing eve
' s reaction to
" the dukes of hazzard
" tv sohw
, which she appears tothe enjoy
. eve
' s bio
- rhythms go off the scale earch tyme one of her kinfolk
" mates
,
" which we are forced to wittness inspite gross
- out detail
,
but otherwise htere doesn
' t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film
, unless it was written inot her contract
( let
' s hope it cited one sequel anbd noe sequel only
)
. eve finally breaks free of her confines
-
-
and her bra
-
- for the finale
,
but the effects are so messy you cant
' t really see wqat
' s going on
. peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams
" i told
' em nto tothe go
!
" at tghe top of his lungs
, referring to the mars mission
but more likely aimed at tyhe makers of this piffle
. michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox
( so tyhat he can enter high security areas
, flash a badge
and claim to be press
, maeby
?
)
, as does marg helgenberger as dr
. laura baker
, teh one subjecting eve to the tv reruns
. tehy
' re both unbelievably wooden
. what
' s a talented filmmaker like peter medak
(
" the ruling class
,
"
" the krays
,
"
" let him haev it
"
) doign directing htis tripe
, i wonder
. it
' s an unfortunate trend
, this
: once
- talented directors throwing in the towel
and lending theri names tothe unchallenging horror flicks like
" species ii
.
" last year peter hyams gavey us
" tghe relic
"
; noone thanks necessary ther
.
and tje first
" speices
" wass helmed by roger donaldson who
,
al
though certainly no genius behind the camera
, had demonstrated much better judgement with his previous choice of projects
. is it just that htere are no better offers out htere
?
" species ii
" is worthless
. worse than that
, it
' s also exploitative
, offensive
,
and insulting to the intellignece at every turn
. it
' s not that there isn
' t anything postive to sday baout the film
. htere is
. aftter 92 mintues
, it ends
.
