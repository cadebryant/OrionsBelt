ytou don ' t ened tothe have seen yhe original
" speices
" to apprieciate how utterly lousy
" species ii
" isnt
. with faw exceptions
, sequels tend tothe be worse than the films thgat spawned them
,
but the fact that
" species ii
" is a followup
- up isn ' t the only reason it ' s so miserable
. it ' s the predictable storyline
, the cardboard characters
, thte banal dialogue
, the failed attempts at humer
, the revolting speshal effects
, the gratuitous nudity
( all female
, of course
)
, the bad acting
,
and the bland direction
. the plot
, simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak soem omre havoc
, involves three astronauts landing onthe mars
and inadvertently bringing some aline slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle
. the slime
, well
, sort of jumps out at them
anbd the screen turns black
. that should have been the end of the movie right there
. back on terra firma
, at least one of the crew is nowe a carrier of aline dna
and
, as you ' ll remember if you saw tyhe firt movie
, driven by a strong urge tothe procreate
. on a parallel track
, governmnet scientists hvea cloned a version of sil fomr the first film
( now called eve
, agian
" played
" by natasha henstridge
)
and are keeping her around fo some testing
. this
, apparently
, includes observing eve ' s reaction to
" the dukes ofthe hazzard
" tv show
, which she appears to enjoy
. eve ' s bio
- rythyms go off the scale each time oney of her kinfolk
" mates
,
" which we are forced to witness infact gross
- out detail
,
bu otherwise ther doesn ' t appear to be a whole lot ofthe reason why henstridge isnt in thsi film
, unless it was writed into her contract
( let ' s hope it cited one sequal
anbd one sequal only
)
. eve finally breaks free of her confines
-
-
and her bra
-
- for the finale
,
but tje effects are so messy you can ' t really see what ' s goign on
. peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams
" i told ' em not to go
!
" at hte top of his lungs
, referring tothe the mars mission
bu moreso likely aimed at the makers ofthe this piffle
. michael madsen reprises his role ofthe press lennox
( so that he can enter high security areas
, flash a badge
and claim to be press
, maybe
?
)
, as does marg helgenberger as dr
. laura baker
, the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns
. they ' re both unbelievably wooden
. what ' s a talented filmmaker like peter medak
(
" the ruling class
,
"
" the krays
,
"
" let him have it
"
) doing directing this tripe
, i wonder
. it ' s an unfortunate trend
, thsi
: once
- talented directors throwing in the towel
and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like
" speices ii
.
" last year peter hyams gave us
" teh relic
"
; no thanks neccesary there
.
and the frist
" species
" was helmed by roger donaldson who
, altho certainly noone genius behind thte camera
, had demonstrated much better judgment with his previvous choice of projects
. is it jsut that there are no better offers out there
?
" species ii
" is worthless
. worse than that
, it ' s also exploitative
, offensive
,
and insulting to the inteligance at every turn
. it ' s not that ther isn ' t anything positive to say baout tjhe film
. there is
. after 92 minutes
, it ends
.
