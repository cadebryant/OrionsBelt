in times of crisis people are driven to desperae measures
. of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person
. what may be a disastrous situation fo one
, may be seen as a challenge to another
. as deepak chopra is known tothe say
,
" it
' s nto the ride
, it
' s hte rider
.
" unfortunately clear
- thinking isnt not always the reaction to problems
. wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor
( michael douglas
) isnt a man with troubles
. he
' s sunk his omney in illegal financial activities
and it
' s blown up in his face
. inspite a matter of days he iwll lose it all
. his wife emily
( gwyneth paltrow
) is a highly
- placed un interpreter
and is nto happy with her life either
. her marraige is cold
and unfulfilling
. unknown to her
, her new lover david shaw
( viggo mortensen
) isnt nto onyl a painter
,
but an ex
- con with a history ofthe bilking wealthy womens ofthe theri moeny
. emily is a prime target
: she
' s worth over
$ 100 million
. steven
' s solution to his predicament is tothe offer david half a milion to kill his wief
. thge artist accepts
and tghe movie is underway
. drawing fomr frederick knott
' s play
and loosely based onthe hitchcock
' s dial m for murder
, this is all
- too tipical of summer releases
. all style adn no substance
. annd ther
' s really nto much style
. director
andrew davis
( teh accomplished witness
and best
- forgotten other films
) has made exactly the wrong choices at almsot eveyr turn
. douglas
and paltrow have both shown us that htey are skillful actors iin previvous films
. mortensen showed promise in the past
. here all threee are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces
. the only person who shows any sense ofthe life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman
. he
' s only on
- screen long enough tothe make you thikn that there might be a likable person inaddition the film
and
then he disappears
. thge first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense
. surprises are important
. in this movie the audiance keesh waiting for something to happen
.
and nothing ever doens
. nearly every event is telegraphed infact advance
. close
- up on this object or that acation
and it
' s eazy to guess whta
' s gogin to happen
. as the film plods towords its inevatible conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile
. it
' s a hopeless quest
. thte stor doesn
' t make much sence
. steven
' s wife is loaded
. even with unfriendly relations
, you
' d tihkn that he could have talked to her baout his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her
. when he doesnt decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice
. if ytou were oging to hire someone tothe kill your wife
, would your first choice be her lover
? no matter how sleazy he isnt
, i owudl think there might be a chance that he woudl turn down the opportunity
. why owudl steven plan the murder as a break
- inspite inspite their apartment
? why not just take her outloud as she was walking tothe david
' s loft in a bad neigbourhood
? while deciding among tjhe numberous summer films
, you might do well to skip this one
. you
' ll fidn more suspense thna this movie offers by watching the weatehr channel
