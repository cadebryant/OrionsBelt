" clueless
" two summers ago
, alicia silverstone proved she wasn ' t just another pretty
, pouty ingenue
, showing a bouyant comedic craftiness taht blew all previvous jobs
-
- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl
and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of
" the crush
"
-
- out of the water
. her only work usance that 1995 gem hasnt been infront june ' s
" batman
& robin
,
" where she overcame the underwritten role ofthe batgirl
. now
, she ' s the star
and producer ofthe
" excess baggage
,
" a hopelessly phony film thast demonstrates how an ill
- composed stoy can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level
. silverstone ' s emily t
. hope is stuck with a billionaire father
( jack thompson
) who neglects her emotionally
. inthe an outlandish plan tothe gain his affection
, she fakes her own kidnapping
-
- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad
and setted a pricey ransom
, ties her legs together
and mouth shut with duct tape
and locks herself iin yhe trunk of her bmw
.
but before the police can
" rescue
" her
, professional auto thief vincent roche
( benicio del toro
) jimmies the locks
, hot
- wires tyhe engine
and makes off with both the car
annd emily
, who ' s still trapped iin the back
. whn vincent discovers emily
, the twpo don ' t exactly hit it off
-
- she annoys him
, he annoys her
,
and at tje advice of his slimy car salesman partner
( harry connick
, jr
.
)
, he decides tothe drive her out tothe the middle of nowhere
adn leave her there
. along the way
, of course
, they get into a whole heap of trouble
,
and cmo to realize that being together isnt hte only way tothe git out of their sticky
, felony
- studder situation
. it doesn ' t help matters that emily
and vincent are being trailed by cops
, crooks
and even her shady uncle ravy
( christopher walken
)
, who ' s wise to his nieve ' s ploys for attention
anbd hasnt masia connections
. for at least a half
- hour
,
" excess baggage
" bounces along fast
and efficiently
. during htis time
, emily
and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role
- reversal twist
-
- she ' s an awfully aggressive
, combative victim
and he ' s quite teh aloof
, seemingly vulnerable captor
.
but once it ' s past its setted
- up
, tghe situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many thigsn at once
. a road movei
, a teen comedy
, a mob thriller
, a drama baout family relationships
-
- you nmae the cliche
and
" excess baggage
" likely covers its territory
. of course a romance develops between yhe two leads
,
bu it all seems forced
,
and thus characterization is manipulated to cause thte finally happy outcome
.
" dont you like my tummy
?
" emily coos to vincent at noe point in tyhe film
. huh
? did i miss something
? the hard
- edged
, foul
- mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone
and replaced witht a pair of batting goo
- goo eyes
.
thn agina
,
" excess baggage
" becomes so weak in so many areas thast the perosnality transplant is nto a complete surprise
. a supporting cast attempts to do waht htey can with colorful
but empty secondry roles
,
but the movie isn ' t gaem anough to use them all
and therefore seems overcrowded
. motivations keep shifting
, resulting in an often confusing narrative
. scant existing story backround confuses matters even worse
and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions
.
" excess baggage
" has too many cahracters
, too much plot
anbd juggles witht one arm behind its back
and a remaining shaky hand
. i loved silverstone ' s turn in
" clueless
" as an aloof
, pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen ' s
" emma
.
" looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there
, it ' s simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for
" excess baggage
.
" sadly
,
however
,
" excess baggage
" is no
" clueless
.
"
but
, on the other hand
, it is clueless
.
