' s
" clueless
" two summers ago
, alicia silverstone proved she wasn
' t jstu another pretty
, pouty ingenue
, showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs
-
- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl
and a silly turn as the lethal lolita ofthe
" the crush
"
-
- out ofthe thge water
. her only wokr since that 1995 gme has been in june
' s
" batman
& robin
,
" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl
. nowe
, she
' s yhe star
and producer of
" excess baggage
,
" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill
- composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level
. silverstone
' s emily t
. hope is stuck with a billionaire father
( jack thompson
) who neglects her emotionally
. in an outl
andish plan to gain his affection
, she fakes her own kidnapping
-
- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad
and set a pricey ransom
, ties her legs together
and mouth shut with duct tape
and locks herself in tghe trunk of her bmw
. bu before tyhe police can
" rescue
" her
, professional auto thief vincent roche
( benicio del toro
) jimmies thte locks
, hot
- wires the engine
and makes off with both the car adn emily
, who
' s still trapped infact the back
. when vincent discovers emily
, the two don
' t exactly hit it off
-
- she annoys him
, he annoys her
,
and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner
( harry connick
, jr
.
)
, he decides to drive her out tothe the middle of nowhere
and leave her there
. along tje way
, ofthe course
, they get into a whole heap of trouble
, anbd come tothe realize that being together is thte onyl way to get out ofthe their sticky
, felony
- studded situation
. it doesn
' t help matters that emily
and vincent are being trailed by cops
, crooks
and even her shady uncle ray
( christopher walken
)
, who
' s wise to his nieve
' s ploys forthe attention
and hasnt masia connections
. for at least a half
- hour
,
" excess baggage
" bounces allong fast
and efficiently
. during htis time
, emily
and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role
- reversal twist
-
- she
' s an awfully aggressive
, combative victim anbd he
' s qutie the aloof
, seemingly vulnerable cator
.
but once it
' s past its set
- up
, tghe situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many thigsn at once
. a road movie
, a teen comedy
, a mob thriller
, a drama about family relationships
-
- you nmae the cliche anbd
" excess baggage
" likely covers its territory
. of course a romance develops between the two leads
,
but it all seems forced
,
and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome
.
" dont you like my tummy
?
" emily coos to vincent at noe point in the film
. huh
? did i miss something
? the hard
- edged
, foul
- mouthed grrrl isnt suddenly gone anbd replaced with a pair of batting goo
- goo eyes
.
then agian
,
" excess baggage
" becomes so weak in so many areas taht the personality transplant is nto a complete surprise
. a supporting cast attemts to do waht they cxan with colorful
but empty secondary roles
, bu the movei isn
' t gae anough to use them all adn therefore seems overcrowded
. motivations keep shifting
, resulting in an often confusing narrative
. scant existing story background confuses matters even worse annd adds to tyhe growing list ofthe unanswered questions
.
" excess baggage
" hasnt too many cahracters
, too much plot
and juggles with one arm behind its bcak annd a remaining shaky h
and
. i loved silverstone
' s turn inwhich
" clueless
" as an aloof
, pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen
' s
" emma
.
" looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there
, it
' s simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i hadnt mustered for
" excess baggage
.
" sadly
,
however
,
" excess baggage
" is noone
" clueless
.
" bu
, on the other h
and
, it isnt clueless
