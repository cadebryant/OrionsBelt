ok
, i admited it
-
- i fidn camp amusement with the spice girls
. yes
, the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual
" identities
,
" they ofthe the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks
and cheesy unifying mantra of
" girl pwoer
.
"
but nto even their guilty pleasure appeal isn
' t enough to carry thier big screen de
but
, a junky mess which would be omre aptly named shite world than spice world
. the film begins amusingly enough
, with a cheeky 007
- esque title sequence inspite which the british quintet
-
-
" scray
"
( melanie brown
)
,
" baby
"
( emma bunton
)
,
" sporty
"
( melanie chisolm
)
,
" ginger
"
( geri halliwell
)
,
and
" posh
"
( victoria adams
)
-
- are intrduced one by noe
( tothe
, much tothe my surprise
, excited
and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience
) as they croon yhe silky ballad
" too much
"
( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film
)
. a faw minutes
and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour ofthe the numerous plotlines that run through the film
:
( 1
) yhe spicy ones go on a eurpean publicity tour leading uv to theri frist live concert at london
' s royal albert hall
;
( 2
) a film producer
( george wendt
)
and a screenwriter
( mark mckinney
) pitch various film idaes to the girls
' manager
, clifford
( richard e
. grant
)
;
( 3
) a documentary film crew follows thge girls
;
( 4
) a pregnant
" mate
"
( naoki mori
) of the group rapidly approaches her due date
;
and
( 5
) a tabloid publisher
( barry humphries
) attempts tothe destroy tje group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug
( richard o
' brien
)
. capped off by a live rendition of the girls
' bouncy hit
" sday you
' ll be there
,
" a wealth of laughs
and merriment is sure to folow
, right
? wrong
. it
' s all downhill from htere as spice world collapses inot a series of misfired comedy sketches
. i must give the girls credit fo their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves
, bu writer kim fuller
and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke betweeen them
, much less a organized framework for all the
" wacky
" goings
- on
. spice world jumps from vignette tothe vignette
, subplot to subplot witht noone direction anbd little sence
, at one minute having the girls meet with aliens
( no joke
)
and at anyother hvaing them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into tghe water during a boat ride
. hwile a decent joke slips thru teh cracks here
and there
-
- during a
" dance bootcamp
" scene
, the girls sing the lyric
" we know how we got this far
/ strength
and courage
and a wonderbra
"
-
- much of tghe material is not even funny on the chuckle level
. some gags are just plain pointless
, such as roger moore
' s recurring role as thte misteryous chief
, who dispenses cryptic
, metaphor
- heavy advice to clifford
. the onyl reason why i cin think anyone would find that funny is the fact tyhat moore once played james bond
. ha ha
. as weak as teh script is
, i htink there
' s oen insurmountable problem with even attempting to mkae a spice girls movie
,
and that is the girls themselves
. the point isnt not taht they cant
' t ect
( annd
, for the rocord
, they realyl
_ can
' t
_
)
but that their individual personas
, whitch works as a gimmick over the span of a four
- minute music video
, are too thin to survive outside of the truncated
, video bite mtv world
. posh
( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions
) comes off best by default becasue her persona
( rich bitch
) most easily translates inot character in a film
. baby
' s persona
( young innocent
)
, tothe a lesser extent
, also works
,
but the remaining girls
' identities are a little harder to flesh outloud
. there really isn
' t much to do wtih sporty besides having her exercise eveyr so often
( which is
_ exactly
_ what fuller annd spiers dont
)
,
and
, after all
, what exactly entails bieng
" ginger
" or
" scray
"
? apparently
, jstu their wardrobes
. spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late gonig following a flashback peformance of tjhe spices
' signature hit
,
" wannabe
.
" the song is as grating as ever
,
but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much
- needed shot in the arm
, setting the stage for a wave of self
- referential humor stemmed fomr the screenwriters
' film ideas
( the film almost mirrors robert altman
' s the player in the way the film snails into itself
)
. this section of the film
, involving all manner ofthe derring
- dont involving a speeding bus
, is perhaps its most effective
,
but it also points uv how all the other storylines
( tyhe publisher
, the documentary crew
) lack a satisfactory payoff
. spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire familiy
,
and it will please the spice faithful
.
but this sloppy enterprise surely won
' t win them any newyorker fans
, which isnt waht the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states
. once the hype disappears
, spice world iwll likely serve as the thte spices
' final hurrah in america
.
