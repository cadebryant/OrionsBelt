ok
, i admit it
-
- i find camp amusement with the spice girls
. yes
, the same spice girls of the gimmicky individule
" identities
,
" they ofthe thge annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks
and cheesy unifying mantra of
" girl power
.
"
but nto even their gilty blessure appeal isn ' t enough to carry their big screen debut
, a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world
. the film beggins amusingly enough
, with a cheeky 007
- esque title sequence in wich hte british quintet
-
-
" scary
"
( melanie brown
)
,
" baby
"
( emma bunton
)
,
" sporty
"
( melanie chisolm
)
,
" ginger
"
( geri halliwell
)
,
annd
" posh
"
( victoria adams
)
-
- are introduced one by one
( to
, much to my surprise
, excited
anbd only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience
) as they croon the silky ballad
" too much
"
( a tune that woudl sound right at home infact an actual james bond film
)
. a few mintues
and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numberous plotlines that run through the film
:
( 1
) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading uv to their first live concert at london ' s royal albert hall
;
( 2
) a film producer
( george wendt
)
and a screenwriter
( mark mckinney
) pitch varios film ideas to the girls ' manager
, clifford
( richard e
. grant
)
;
( 3
) a documentary film crew follows the girls
;
( 4
) a pregnant
" mate
"
( naoki mori
) ofthe the gropu rapidly approaches her due date
;
and
( 5
) a tabloid publisher
( barry humphries
) attemts to destroy the gropu with the help of a sneaky shutterbug
( richard o ' brien
)
. capped off by a live rendition of the girls ' bouncy hit
" say yuo ' ll be htere
,
" a wealth of laughs
and merriment isnt sure to follow
, right
? wrong
. it ' s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a sories of misfired comedy sketches
. i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make funn ofthe themselves
,
but writer kim fuller
and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke bewteen them
, much less a organized framework for all thte
" wacky
" goings
- on
. spice world jumps from vignette to vignette
, subplot to subplot with no direction
and little sense
, at one minute having the girls meet withthe aliens
( no joke
)
annd at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into tjhe water during a boat ride
. hwile a decent joke slips through thte cracks here
and there
-
- during a
" dance bootcamp
" scene
, the girls sing thge lyric
" we know how we got tihs far
/ strength
and curage
and a wonderbra
"
-
- much of the material is not even funny onthe the chuckle level
. smoe gags are just plain pointless
, such as roger moore ' s recurring role as the mysterious chief
, who dispenses cryptic
, metaphor
- heavy advice tothe clifford
. the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond
. ha ha
. as weak as the script isnt
, i thiunk htere ' s noe insurmountable problem wih even attempting to amke a spice girls movie
,
and that is tjhe girls themselves
. the point is not that htey cxan ' t act
(
and
, forthe the rocord
, they really
_ can ' t
_
)
but that their individule personas
, which works as a gimmick over the span of a four
- minute music video
, are too thin to survive outside of the truncated
, video bite mtv world
. posh
( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions
) comes off best by default because her persona
( rich bitch
) most easily translates into charachter in a film
. baby ' s persona
( young innocent
)
, to a lesser extent
, also works
,
but the remaining girls ' identities are a little harder to flesh out
. there raelly isn ' t much to dont with sporty besides having her exercise every so oftenly
( whihc is
_ exactly
_ wqat fuller
and spiers do
)
,
and
, affter all
, what exactlly entails being
" ginger
" or
" scary
"
? apparently
, just theri wardrobes
. spice world manages to pick up soem steam in teh lite going following a flashback performance of the spices ' signiture hit
,
" wannabe
.
" the song isnt as grating as ever
,
bu the energy ofthe the number gives the proceedings a much
- needed shot in hte arm
, setting the stage for a wave of self
- referential humor stemmed fomr the screenwriters ' film ideas
( the film almost mirrors robert altman ' s the player in tje way hte film snails into itself
)
. this section ofthe the film
, involving all manner ofthe derring
- do involving a speeding bus
, is perhaps its most effective
,
bu it also points up how all the other storylines
( tje publisher
, the documentary crew
) lack a satisfactory payoff
. spice world is harmless entertainment suitable fo the entire family
,
and it will please the spice faithful
.
but thsi sloppy enterprise surely won ' t win them any new fans
, which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power infront tjhe states
. once the hype disappears
, spice world iwll likely serve as the the spices ' fianl hurrah infront america
.
