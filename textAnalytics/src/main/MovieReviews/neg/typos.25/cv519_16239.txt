terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones
' world war ii novel
. unfortunately
, he buried it withing an overlong
and overreaching 3
- hour long pseudo
- epic
. this is a shame becuase the film features an outst
anding peformance by nick nolte
. hte best scene is wehn nick nolte
' s charater
, lt
. col
. tall
, is forced to deal with the direct refusla by capt
. staros
( elias koteas
) to execute an order
. nolte
' s reaction
and transformation may be yhe best work of his career
. hadnt terrence malick concentrated on tyhe grat performances ofthe nolte
and koteas as well as those by sean penn
, woody harrelson
, anbd john cusack
, he sould have made a truly great film
. instade
, malick saddled teh film with plodding pacing
, unnecessary flashbacks
, adn a voice
- over narration all desgined to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the stoy
. tyhe narration was especially annoying as much ofthe it sounded like very bad high skool peotry
. with a lot of editting
, the core story could be tranformed inot a truley classic war film
. hopefully
, the dvd version of htis film will feature options to suppress tje narration
,
and perhaps wiull even provide for an alternate
, shorter version of thge film
. i give this film
.
