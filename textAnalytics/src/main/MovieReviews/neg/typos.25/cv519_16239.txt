terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones ' world war ii novel
. unfortunately
, he buried it within an overlong
and overreaching 3
- hour long pseudo
- epic
. this is a shame because tje film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte
. the best scene is when nick nolte ' s character
, lt
. col
. tall
, is forced to deal whith tyhe direct refusal by capt
. staros
( elias koteas
) tothe execute an order
. nolte ' s reaction
annd transformaton may be hte best work of his career
. had terrence malick consentrated onthe yhe great performances of nolte
anbd koteas as well as those by sean penn
, woody harrelson
,
anbd john cusack
, he could have made a truely graet film
. instead
, malick saddled the film wtih plodding pacing
, unnecessary flashbacks
,
and a voice
- over narration all designed to telegraph the graet philosophical underpinnings of teh sotry
. the narration was especially annoying as much ofthe it sounded liek veyr bad high school poetry
. wih a lot ofthe editing
, the core story sould be transformed into a truly classic war film
. hopefully
, tyhe dvd version of this film will feature options tothe supress the narration
,
and perhaps wiull even provide fo an alternate
, shorter verison of the film
. i give htis film
.
