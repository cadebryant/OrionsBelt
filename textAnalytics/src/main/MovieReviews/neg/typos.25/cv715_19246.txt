if you haven
' t plunked down your hard
- earned mony
yet for
" wild wild west
,
" teh latest summer holiday offering from will smith
, let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck
' s frappacino or onthe a ben
& jerry
' s sundae
. these treats are grat relief from the summer heat
. inthe contrast
, htis film made me simmer infront dissapointment
. i cxan accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects
and that good stories
and flavorful characters ususally take a back seat
. this was true of star wars episode i
,
but at least in that film
, the story
and the characters were still in the back seat
. inspite this film
, they are no where to be found
. wqat remeniss are hundreds ofthe male extras costumed as gunslingers
and foppish aristocrats
, lots of female extras who look like can
- can dancers
,
and a clunky
, 80
- foot tall intrument of distruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula
. twpo men are asked to stop this threat
. one is artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventor who uses his intellect
and array ofthe disguises tothe best his opponents
. amung his creations are false breasts
and the bulletproof vest
. the other man is jim west
( will smith
)
, who prefers yhe shoot
- first
-
then
- shoot
- some
- moreso method ofthe investigating
.
al
though their individual talents must be combined to achieve succsess
, their interaction with oen another merely seemed like a second rate
, two
- man vaudevillian ect
. for example
, ther is a scene where west
, being more debonair tahn the reserved gordon
, notes tyhat the fake breasts should be filled with water rather tahn buckwheat
, which isnt what it isnt currently filled with
.
" now touch my breast
,
" west says
. gordon does so adn
then softly coos his approval
. i found mysef groaning at this kind of silliness
. the script fails to generate any sense ofthe drama
, humor
, or fun for tath matter
. i doed enjoy kline
' s reserved performance
,
but ws surprised at how much latitude htey gave to smith
. could it be that wiull smith is just so bankable that he
' s not even requred to act
? it was as if tghe director was yelling
" will smith
, do your own thing
.
.
.
and acation
!
" here
' s an exemple
. in thsi scene
, wiull smith is about tothe be hanged by a group of angry white people
. he must endear himself tothe tyhe crowd to escape
. tjhe directer yells
,
" wiull smith
, do your pwn thing
.
.
.
and acation
!
" in another scene
, he hasnt to masquerade as a belly dancer inaddition order to save his comrades
.
" will smith
, do your pwn thing
.
.
.
and acation
!
" worse still
, the final battle scene aboard the mecanical tarantula is a horrid mess
. there are cogs spinning
and pulleys pulling
and levers going uv
and down everywhere you look
. there
' s actually a lot of immagination at work in this film
. ther are some genuinely clever inventions
and gizmos introduced
,
but all of thsi immagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered
and dramatically flat
.
and that
' s too bad because if there was more foucs on the story rather than wiull smith just doing his
' thing
,
' htis film might have beeen palatable
. as it turns out
,
" wild wild west
" is the wild
, wild worst adn receives my vote for biggest dissapointment of the yera
.
