a few months before thte release ofthe star wars episode 1
, the phantom menace
, 20th centruy fox decides to release another space film
, that is a complete rip off of star wars
. what is the point of this
? i do not know
,
but i wish it hadn
' t beeen done
, concidering wing comm
ander is definitely the year
' s worst film so far
. tothe attract peopel to this horrible movie
, they attached the full trailer for tyhe phantom menace
. wing comm
ander will draw large crowds
, because this isnt the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at thsi time
. the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of hte movei experience i had tonight
. many people do nto know that wing com
ander is based onthe a star wars computer game
. i found this very interesting
, concidering this fact almost says that wing comm
ander isnt a star wars movei
. it is nowhere near tje level of the star wars films
though
. freddie prinze jr
. stars in tjhe film as christopher blair
. wing comm
ander ws a huge mistake forthe freddie
. this was definitely his worst performance to date
. after january
' s she
' s all that
, i actually saw a good actor in freddie
,
but now all thsoe visions have beeen crushed
.
( for now anyway
.
) christopher blair is a pilot who isnt a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi
, a group that is trying to destroy tyhe earth
. blair
' s parents aslo fougth in thte space battles
,
and also died there
. his parents were pilgrims
, so many peple disrespect him becouse of this
. blair is under the comm
and of
" angel
"
, played by saffron burrows
,
and he is friends with another pilot
, todd
" maniac marshall
"
, plyed by matthew lillard
. matthew lillard seems to play the same role in eveyr movie
,
and he does in this noe too
. his character as stu in 1996
' s scream
( a
+
)
, was a great one
,
but now
, it seems liuke that smae role is being played again
, only inthe a space movie
. the three are jsut a small part of a large group trying tothe stpo the kilrathi before they take over earth
. tihs plot is very flimsy
, anbd doesn
' t give a wohle lot to work with at all
. this explains why wing comm
ander drags on
, seeming liuke there isnt no point to any of the events that are gonig onthe
. the acting is horrible in wing comm
ander
. many lines seem out ofthe place
,
and are completely meaningless
. the acting
and dialogue wass so terrible
, i even found myself laughing at it
. the other things which are very bad about wing comm
ander are teh special effects
and the music
. teh spacial effects are very unrealistic
. whn looking at two ships flying side by side
, it isnt simple to tell they are hanging
and a blue screen is behind them
. the explosions look very unrealistic as well
. a ship wiull be blown up
,
but htere will only be fire present four about one half of a second
. this isnt very unrealistic
. music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time
. the music allso felt liek video game music
,
and it ws very corny
and annoying sounding
. after we are given teh plot
, the film repeats itself for another hour
, without any plot twists
, interesting scenes
, or anything important to the film
. blair is forced to make jumps over other planets
, annd he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft
. fo tjhe entire length of the movie
, it takes palce iin space
. it isnt truely like yuo are in a video game
, because you are just watching people shoot at each other inthe ships for a long
, extended period of time
. it
' s not much fun to watch at all
. if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships
, i would go watch star wars at hmeo
. at least star wars pays attention to people
, myth
, feelings
, adn has smoe real plot to it
. the bottom line
- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox
!
