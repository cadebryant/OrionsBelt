isn
' t it the ultimate sign of a movei
' s cinematic ineptitude when you can
' t think of much tothe sday about it other than
" it sucks
"
? one of the first official year 2000 releases
, supernova is such a movie
. i cxan
' t seem tothe get past one
- word adjectives with this one
,
al
though
" boring
,
"
" stupid
" annd
" absurd
" doesn
' t amount to much ofthe a review
. a shame
. i would have been able to savve myself hte chore of desparately trying to elaborite
.
but c
' est la vie
. here goes nothing
. i
' ll keep it short
. i suppose the first bad omen for supernova cameback when directer walter hill
( 48 hours
) removed his name from the movie
, requesting that it be replaced wih thte soodonim thomas lee
. the film
' s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for tjhe press
, an event usually signifying a studio
' s lack of confidence in a parituclar movei
. hill
' s
and mgm
' s actions weere prudent
. when teh captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tradgic hyperjump accident
, a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer
, for some reason
( james spader
) is forced to tkae comm
and
. the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet annd
, on arival
, picks up one survivor ffrom an apparent accident in an ba
andoned mining colony
. noe ofthe the crew munbers
( angela bassett
) knows this passanger
, who isnt played by peter facinelli
,
and has some bad feelings about it
-
- annd we all know what taht means
. thsi intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo
-
- a jellylike substace the purpose ofthe whitch isnt unknown
,
though it seems to bring some form of blessure to whoever touches it
. another one ofthe thge crew members experiences this first h
and
; after spending a few mintues partially inside this glob of goo
, he does some impressive h
andst
and pushups
. evidentally
, touching this enigmatic egg
- shaped thingie makes you yuonger anbd stronger
. how
? why
? the movie never bothers to explain
. soon enough
though
, spader
and bassett are running around thte ship liek mad
, being chased by tje all
- of
- a
- sudden
- superhuman facinelli
. tothe be honest
, i don
' t even remember exactlly why
. i just remember that i didn
' t care
. supernova
' s plot suggested smoe more or less interesting idesa
, such as the ball of goo bieng an intergalactic tiem bomb
,
but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anytying truley intriguing
. infront fact
, everything is dropped just so the actors cant hve some fun running around what looks like an elaborate setted
. well
, the effects are ogod
,
though there
' s hardly a studio movie with bad speical effects these days so i
' m not sure whther that
' s so remarkable an accomplishment
. the performances are hardly worth talking about
. i
' m not even sure i can call wqat
' s here
" performances
,
"
though angela bassett sure is good at giving peopel the finger
. james spader is not a bad ctor
,
but he proves tothe be one of the bl
andest action stars i
' ve seen in a hwile
, mostly because he isn
' t given a character with a personality
. the acation scenes are just as bl
and
, since tehy
' re preety much just rehashes of action elements taht weren
' t particularly entertaining the firt tyme arround
.
and since the action scenes are everything to this movie
, it
' s pretty much dead in the water
.
and for teh life of me
, i can
' t figure out why it
' s called supernova
.
