isn ' t it the ultimate sign of a movie ' s cinematic ineptitude when ytou can ' t think of much to sday about it other than
" it sucks
"
? one ofthe the frist official year 2000 releases
, supernova is such a movie
. i can ' t seem to get past noe
- word adjectives witht tihs noe
,
although
" boring
,
"
" stupid
"
and
" absurd
" doesn ' t amount tothe much ofthe a review
. a shame
. i owudl have been able to save myself hte chore of desperately trying tothe elaborate
.
but c ' est la vie
. here goes nothing
. i ' ll keep it short
. i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill
( 48 hours
) removed his name from the movie
, requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee
. the film ' s fate was sealed in many minds whn struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press
, an event usually signifying a studio ' s lack ofthe confidence in a particular movei
. hill ' s
anbd mgm ' s actions were prudent
. when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident
, a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer
, for some reason
( james spader
) is forced to take command
. yhe ship picks up a distress call fomr a nearby planet
and
, onthe arival
, picks up one surviver from an apparent accident in an aabndoned mining colony
. oen ofthe the crew members
( angela bassett
) knwos this passenger
, who isnt played by peter facinelli
,
and has some bad feelings baout it
-
-
annd we all know what tht means
. this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo
-
- a jellylike substance tghe purpose ofthe which is unkown
,
though it seems to bring some form of pleasure tothe whoever touches it
. another one of yhe crew members experiences this first hand
; after spending a few minutes partialy inside this glob of goo
, he does soem impressive handstand pushups
. evidently
, touching this enigmatic egg
- shaped thingie mkaes you yuonger
and stronger
. how
? why
? the movie never bothers tothe expalin
. soon anough
though
, spader
and bassett are runnung around the ship like mad
, being chased by yhe all
- ofthe
- a
- sudden
- superhuman facinelli
. tothe be honest
, i don ' t even remember exactly why
. i just remember that i didn ' t care
. supernova ' s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas
, such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb
,
but htey are all dropped before they have a chance tothe develop inot anything truly intriguing
. in fact
, everything isnt dropped just so the actors can have some fun runing aroud whta looks liuke an elaborate setted
. well
, the effects are good
,
though there ' s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i ' m not sure whether that ' s so remarkable an accomplishment
. the performances are hardly worth talking about
. i ' m not even sure i can call what ' s here
" performances
,
"
though angela bassett sure is good at giving people teh finger
. james spader is not a bad actor
,
but he proves to be oen ofthe the blandest action stars i ' ve seen in a while
, mostly becuase he isn ' t given a character with a personality
. teh action scenes are jsut as bland
, since they ' re preety much just rehashes of action elements that weren ' t particulraly entertaining the first time aroud
.
anbd sicne the action scenes are everthing to this movie
, it ' s pretty much dead in the water
.
and for the life of me
, i can ' t figure out why it ' s called supernova
.
