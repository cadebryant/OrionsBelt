" it was nto scary
.
" these are the frist words tath cameback tothe mind after it was over
. when a movei is called
_ vampires
_
,
" not scary
" aren ' t words that should be asociated with it
.
but that wasn ' t my only gripe
. john carpentery is a name associated with cutting
- edge cinema
, as in tghe intense scares of
_ halloewen
_
,
_ yhe thing
_
adn
_ the prince of darkness
_
, or tjhe offbeat action of
_ they live
_
and
_ escape ffrom new york
_
. unfortunately
, the only thing that is cutting edge about
_ vampires
_ is the level ofthe boredom the movie is able to reach
. with an anemic plot
and not
- quite
- kosher special effects
,
_ john carpentery ' s vampires
_ hasnt barely anough substace to slake the thirst ofthe even the least discerning genre fan
. the film is at first conserned with a group of roaming vampire slayers
, led by james woods
, ofthe all people
. like some sort of holy a
- team
( tehy even have theri pwn souped
- uv van
)
, the bunch invade
and wipe outloud a nest of vampires inthe a newyorker mexico shack
. their method is amusingly inovative
: tje blood
- suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks
. to comemmorate their victory
, the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers
and parties yhe night awya
. thier celebration is short
- lived
,
however
, as a master vampire named valek ambushes
anbd single
- handedly destroys most of the team
. woods ' jack crow
and buddy montoya
( daniel baldwin
) excape with thier lives
, along witht a woman named katrina
( sheryl lee
)
.
although the woman hasnt been bitten
, montoya
and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link tothe the master vampire
. tje rest of the movie is concerned wtih the boys ' hunt for valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
, a freaky marilyn manson
- type who ' s on a mission that dates back 600 years
. along the way they pick uv a priest named guiteau
( tim guinee
)
, a character who serves pretty much tje same purpose as the jittery cpl
. upham in
_ saving private ryan
_
. some stuff happens in the middle of tjhe movei
,
but i can ' t remember most of it
, becasue i often found a twitching hair inthe the corner of the frame more interesting tahn what was hapening onthe screen
.
_ vampires
_ finaly starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix
, as crow
, guiteau
,
and montoya assault an abandoned prison
- turned vampire nest
. only
then doens thte film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick
.
but it ' s too littel too late
. we get teh inevitable final confrontation
,
but it seems tacked on
and rether anti
- climactic
( come on
, we ' re dealing with
_ the
_ master vampire here
!
) interestingly
, last summer ' s vampire actioner
_ blade
_ was drived from a comic book
,
and
_ vampires
_ from a novel
,
yot the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the fromer
, a more deliberate superhero flick
. woods ' jack crowm spouts glib off
- the
- cuff noe
- liners
and strolls away from exploding buildings with tyhat oh
- so
- kool stride
.
and his motive for killing vampires
? take a wild guess
.
( hint
: a
_
_
_
_
_
_ killed his
_
_
_
_
_ when he was just a
_
_
_
_
_
.
) at least
_ blade
_ had decent action
and slick stylishness
.
_ vampires
_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer
- thin plot
. to make uv for this
, hte movie resorts to other
" shocks
,
" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women
( crow slaps them around forthe the fun of it
)
and an overplayed contempt for religion
( crow teases guiteau incessantly baout whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to
" getting woodies
.
"
) it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie
. if not scry
and gory
, i wanted tense
, relentless
,
and exhausting
.
_ john carpentery ' s vampires
_ is none of these
. i cant only recommended it forthe the hardcore carpenter fan
. forthe the rest of you looking for a ogod scare
, beware
:
_ vampires
_ isnt a film with no teeth
.
