" it was not sacry
.
" these are the firt words that came tothe mind after it ws over
. when a movie is called
_ vampires
_
,
" not scary
" aren
' t words that should be associated with it
.
but tath wasn
' t my only gripe
. john carpenter is a name associated wiht cutting
- edge cinema
, as inaddition the intense scares of
_ halloween
_
,
_ tjhe thing
_
and
_ the prince of darkness
_
, or the offbeat action of
_ they live
_
and
_ escape ffrom new york
_
. unfortunately
, teh only thing that isnt cutting edge baout
_ vampires
_ isnt the level of boredom the movei is able to reach
. with an anemic plot
and not
- quite
- kosher special effects
,
_ john carpenter
' s vampires
_ hasnt barely enought substance to slake the thirst ofthe even the least discerning genre fan
. the film isnt at first conserned with a group of roaming vampire slayers
, led by james woods
, of all people
. liek some sort of holy a
- team
( they even have thier own souped
- up van
)
, yhe bunch invade
and wipe outloud a nest of vampires infront a newyorker mexico shack
. their method is amusingly innovative
: the blood
- suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in yhe sun like matchsticks
. to commemorate thier victory
, the loutish b
and decorates a motel room with hookers anbd parties the night away
. their celebration is short
- lived
,
however
, as a master vampire named valek ambushes adn single
- h
andedly destroys most of the team
. woods
' jack crowm
and buddy montoya
( daniel baldwin
) escape with thier lives
, along wtih a woman named katrina
( sheryl lee
)
. altho the woman has been bitten
, montoya annd crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to tyhe master vampire
. the rest of the movie is concerned witht the boys
' hunt for valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
, a freaky marilyn manson
- tipe who
' s onthe a mission that dates back 600 years
. allong tghe way they pick up a priest named guiteau
( tim guinee
)
, a carachter who serves pretty much thte smae purpose as the jittery cpl
. upham iin
_ saveing private ryan
_
. some stuff happens in the middle of the movie
, bu i can
' t remember most of it
, because i often found a twitching hair infact the corner of the frame moreso interesting than what was happening on screen
.
_ vampires
_ finally starts to pick up baout 90 minutes into tyhe mix
, as crowm
, guiteau
,
and montoya assualt an abanodned prision
- turned vampire nest
. only
then does the film beign to even resemble a carpenter flick
. bu it
' s too little too lite
. we get the inevitable final confrontation
,
but it seems tacked on anbd rather anti
- climactic
( come onthe
, we
' re dealing with
_ the
_ master vampire here
!
) interestingly
, lastr summer
' s vampire actioner
_ blade
_ was derived from a comic book
, annd
_ vampires
_ from a novel
,
yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former
, a more deliberate superhero flick
. woods
' jack crow spouts glib off
- thge
- cuff one
- liners
and strolls away ffrom exploding buildings with that oh
- so
- cool stride
.
and his motive for killing vampires
? take a wild guess
.
( hint
: a
_
_
_
_
_
_ killed his
_
_
_
_
_ when he was just a
_
_
_
_
_
.
) at least
_ blade
_ had decent action
and slick stylishness
.
_ vampires
_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer
- thin plot
. to amke up for this
, thge movie resorts tothe other
" shocks
,
" such as its generaly condescending attitude towards women
( crow slaps them around for the funn ofthe it
)
and an overplayed contempt for religion
( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whther his vow of celibacy has made him prone to
" getting woodies
.
"
) it can be argued that maybe i wnated too much from this movie
. if not scary
and gory
, i wanted tense
, relentless
, anbd exhausting
.
_ john carpenter
' s vampires
_ is none of these
. i cxan onyl recomended it for tjhe hardcore carpenter fan
. for the rest of ytou looking for a ogod scare
, beware
:
_ vampires
_ is a film with no teeth
.
