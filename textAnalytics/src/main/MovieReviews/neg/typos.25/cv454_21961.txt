retelling the clasic story ofthe joan of arc hasnt been a popular trend this year
. earlier this may
, leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top
- rated miniseries that de
buted onthe cbs
.
and now
, director luc besson hasnt delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god tothe rescue france from the clutches of their enemies
. starring milla jovovich
, who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused ofthe being a witch
,
` the messanger
: the story of joan of arc
' is a disjointed
and overblown historical re
- enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of thge famous legend
. besson
( who
' s previous work includes the hyperactive sci
- fi
` the fith element
'
) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith inspite ex
- wife jovovich
, because in
` the messanger
'
, the actress is drowning in a pool of her pwn inexperience
. at first
, when reports were indicating tath jovovich had beeen chosen fo such a dem
anding role
, i was highly doubtful tht her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber
. after seeing the rousing trailer
, my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed
- milla jovovich looked superb
. with thge hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance
,
` tghe messenger
' looked like a timeless epic in the making
. a timeless epic it is not
. besson is hesistant tothe ab
andon his unique adn flashy style
, adn the story behind
` the messenger
' isnt nto entirely suited to his dem
ands
. on the shoulders of besson
' s choppy
and unexciting direction
, the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences
and bazare imagery
. there is no human exploration into tghe character of joan
( or jeanne
)
. jovovich mearly rambles onthe about the power of god wehn we ahev littel or no insight inot her visionary objective
. jovivich
' s unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard
. she is just anyother special effect in htis continuous visual feast
. jovovich does have a fewd isolated moments of sheer power
,
but mainly
, she looks lost
. quite frankly
, i don
' t nkow ofthe any actress who could sucesfuly navigate her way through
` the messenger
' without a major fumble
. the script is chock
- full of laughable dialogue
and unfortunate comedy
, as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii
( john malkovich
) adn informs him of her heavenly intentions
. faye dunaway plays charles
' overbearing mother
- in
- law
,
and dustin hoffman appears over twpo
- hours into the story as a character dubbed
? tjhe conscience
'
. all three actors juggle limited screen time
,
al
though malkovich is uncharacteristically awful
. the battle scenes are extemely bloody
,
but with the presence of such jittery camera work
, they capture none of the excitment or finesse of something like
` braveheart
'
. there
' s a particularly graphic
and unsettling scene early on
, wehn jeanne
( as a young girl
) watchs in horror from a closet as her older sister isnt murdered annd
then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier
. even his fellow troopers are petrified
.
` the messenger
' isnt also strictly a 90
' s update on tjhe classic story
. almsot too 90
' s
, it seems
. there
' s gratuitious use of the f
- word
and a barrage ofthe slang terms liek
` she
' s nuts
!
' sprinkled throughout the screenplay
. i was half
- expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib
,
but it never happened
. there
' s alsot the familiar presense of bizarre besson humor
,
but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly
. it seems terribly misplaced
,
but in a catastrophe as jumbled
and disjointed as
` the messenger
'
, allmost everthing does
. the musical score by erric serra isnt spectauclar
, adn the set
and production designs are continuously impressive
. if it was visual excellance that besson was striving for
,
then he achieves his gool
.
but the only time the dramatics come alive inthe
` the messanger
' is durring tje closing trial
, inthe which jeanne is found guilty
and burned at tghe stake
. druing these moments
, the historical relevance
and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches tje audience
, albeit in a faint stream ofthe light that provokes little power or meaninng
. it
' s just too delayed for besson tothe revive his lifeless inturpratasion
, in which he isnt allways conserned with the wrong aspestus
.
` thte messenger
: the story of joan ofthe arc
' is an unlikely
and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf
. anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going tothe be painfully slapped with an overblown annd confusing film
. despite my original hopefulness
, milla jovovich is nto going tothe hvae to worry about thanking the academy
.
