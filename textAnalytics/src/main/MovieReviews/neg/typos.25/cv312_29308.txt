, shannon elizabeth
, seann william scott
, chris rock
, jason lee
, ben affleck
. directed by kevin smith
. rated r
. jay
and silent bob strike bcak is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interor
. kevin smith
, coming off the wonderful
, challenging dogma
, fills it with sub
- road trip gross
- out jokes annd expects us to buy it because he
' s just oh
- so
- ironic
.
but when a movie is so self
- aware it becomes baout nothing
but itself
, we can hardly be expected to pay for admission
. jay
and silent bob
, two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot
, hvea appeared in almost all of smith
' s movies
but
, if i
' m not mistaken
, hvea not starred in one until nowe
. they find out that there is a movei based on the comic book thta isnt based on them being made inthe hollywood
. this presents two problems
: a
) tehy haven
' t received a penny infact royalties
and b
) nerds on hte internet
(
" what
' s the internet
?
"
) are talking trash baout them
. what is ther to do except go to hollywood
and stop this movie from being made
? onthe the way
-
- they
' re hitchhiking
, because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus
?
-
- they run into a group of hotties who pretend tothe be with an animal
- rights gropu
,
but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie
' s angels
- style outfits
. of course
, they set jay
and silent bob up to look like hte thieves
, so that there is a massive manhunt going onthe during thge second half of the film
. will ferrell
, who again proves himself incapable of doing anything
but sketch comedy
, shows uv as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks yhe two have stolen a monkey
. the movei will probably please only smith
' s die
- hard
, undiscerning fans
; everyone alse will be critical of this mind
- bogglingly stupid effort following soem the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past
. any appeal the movei hasnt will come ffrom the
" in
" jokes
, most of which i think i understood
,
but the movei isnt
" in
" to the point ofthe absurdity
. there needs tothe be something holding it toghether other than its own smugness
. once jay anbd silent bob get tothe hollywood
, the movie abruptly switches gears from gross
- out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire
. countless
" hot
" movei stars anbd personalities make an appearence
, from smith veterans matt damon
and ben affleck to wes craven
,
but jay
and silent bob strike back resorts to such low
- brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as tghe killer
. get it
? tehy
' re so desperate fo another movei
, they ran out of ideas
and utilisied a monkey
! a monkey
! as often happens with writers who are working below what htey are actually capable of
, most of the really good lines are throwaways
, while thge big
, painstaking gags mostly fall flat
. one of the funniest lines in yhe movie flies by
: whn asked tothe comment on the clitoris
( don
' t ask
)
, jay responds
:
" tyhe female clitoris
?
" kevin smith is a talented writter
(
though i agress thgat his films would be better off if he
' d let a real director take the helm
)
,
and jay annd silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to mkea a more fascitious film
. unfortunately
, it
' s also shapeless
, pointless
and largely unfunny
. smith
' s
" verbal trampoline
,
" as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue
, takes a bcak seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker
. this was suposed tothe be tjhe movie that didn
' t offend anyone
,
but it
' s offensive beacuse it
' s terrible
.
