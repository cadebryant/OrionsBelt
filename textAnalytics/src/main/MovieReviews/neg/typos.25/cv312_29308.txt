. rated r
. jay
adn silent bob strike bakc is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interor
. kevin smith
, coming off the wonderful
, chalenging dogma
, fills it with sub
- road trip gross
- out jokes
and expects us to buy it because he ' s just oh
- so
- ironical
.
but whn a movie is so self
- aware it becomes baout nothing
but itself
, we can hardly be expected tothe pay for admission
. jay
and silent bob
, two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot
, hvea appeared in almost all of smith ' s movies
but
, if i ' m not mistaken
, ahve nto starred in one util now
. tehy fidn outloud that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made inspite hollywood
. this presents two problems
: a
) tehy haven ' t recived a penny in royalties
and b
) nerds on the internet
(
" what ' s tjhe internet
?
"
) are talking trash about them
. whta is htere to do except go to hollywood
anbd stop this movie from being made
? onthe yhe way
-
- they ' re hitchhiking
, because who knew ytou needed tickets tothe take a bus
?
-
- they run into a group ofthe hotties who pretend to be with an animal
- rights group
,
but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie ' s angels
- stlye outfits
. of course
, they set jay
and silent bob up to look like the thieves
, so that there is a massive manhunt gogin on during tyhe second half ofthe the film
. wiull ferrell
, who again proves himself incapable ofthe doing anything
but sketch comedy
, shows uv as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey
. the movei will probably please only smith ' s die
- hard
, undiscerning fans
; everyone else will be critical of this mind
- bogglingly stupid effort following some the suphisticated cinema that he churned out inthe years past
. any appeal the movie has wiull come from tyhe
" infact
" jokes
, most of which i htikn i understoon
,
but the movie is
" iin
" to tjhe point ofthe absurdity
. ther needs to be something holding it together otehr than its own smugness
. once jay
annd silent bob get to hollywood
, the movie abruptly switchs gears from gross
- outloud comedy tothe ridiculously broad hollywood satire
. countless
" hot
" movie stars
and personalities mkea an appearance
, from smith veterans matt damon
and ben affleck tothe wes craven
,
but jay
and silent bob strike bakc resorts to such low
- brow gags as another scream sequel with a monkey as the killer
. get it
? they ' re so despearte fo anyother movie
, they ran outloud of idesa
and utilizied a monkey
! a monkey
! as oftenly happens witht writers who are working below what they are actually capable ofthe
, most of the really good lines are throwaways
, while tghe big
, painstaking gags mostly fall flat
. one of the funniest lines infront the movie flies by
: when asked to comment on the clitoris
( don ' t ask
)
, jay responds
:
" tje female clitoris
?
" kevin smith is a talented writer
(
though i agree that his films woudl be better off if he ' d let a rela director take the helm
)
,
anbd jay
and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to mkea a more facetious film
. unfortunately
, it ' s also shapeless
, pointless
anbd largely unfunny
. smith ' s
" verbal trampoline
,
" as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue
, tkaes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker
. this was supposed tothe be the movie taht didn ' t offen anyone
,
but it ' s offensive becasue it ' s terrable
.
