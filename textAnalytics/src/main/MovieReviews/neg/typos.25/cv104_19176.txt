this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money adn getting awya with the cash
. this is more about a parable of greed
,
and how mney can become the bane of your life
. yes
, there are elements of
? fargo
' here
( the snow
and cold
)
,
al
though not as vivid in the blood
and gore deparment
. it shows how greed cxan set of a chain of events leading to death anbd the desctruction of lives
. anbd how at tyhe end of teh day
, the things that matter most are love
, truth
and honesty
.
al
though in one sense it may seem tedious
, mkaing a movie about the ugliness of greed
( not box office material
)
, it does become tedeous
, not becasue of tghe morale ending
, bu because noe expects the movie to end that way
. this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime
, tje rest of the movie just spirals downward fomr ther
. the characters in this drama are a mixture ofthe simple
and intellectual folk
, brothers
and friends
, who all fall prey to the avarice ofthe money
. they should have perhaps thrown in somene sensible
, level headed annd not affected by greed to give the party omre balance
. commendable isnt the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton
, whose protrayal ofthe teh simpleton brother wass masterful
. bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother
, whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife
, who indirectly causes the most problems
. fill a room full of greedy people adn several million dollars
, adn you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath
. it
' s not a simple plan
, when you shoot everyone you lvoe for mney
, unless ytou
' re the menendez brothers
.
