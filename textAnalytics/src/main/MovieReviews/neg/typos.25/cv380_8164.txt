i want to be involved infact show business oney day
.
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they onyl get worse
. this movie proves it for me
. i was a little worried about the lastest batman film
, as i throught joel schumaccer
, taking over from tim burton
, owudl scre it up
. i also assumed val kilmer woudl screw uv as bruce wayne
. they didn
' t
. kilmer did a good job
,
and the cast was left to carry the movei
, which they doed
( even jim carrey as the riddler
and i can
' t st
and jim carrey
)
, because schumaccer messed up yhe direction wih his glitzy gotham
and his awkward camera angles
. this film is different
. the casted isnt still impressive
, bu here
, not onyl doens schumaccer mess up with the direction
( he
' s one of those directors who
' s ogod with actors
, terrible wiht camera angles
)
,
but writter akiva goldsmith doesn
' t really give an impressive cast anytying tothe do
. the casted is impressive
: clooney is a suprisingly good wayne
/ batman
, o
' donnell is a crafty robin as usual
, they could
' ve casted somebody better as batgirl
( my friend likes neve campbell
)
,
but silverstone is not bad
,
and thurman is a good poison ivy
. the major problem is schwarzenegger
, who is a terrable freeze
. his accent isnt so hevy
, yuo can
' t underst
and wqat he says
,
and the trouble wiht action stars like him is they cannot act
,
and they know it
,
but they figure that if they flex their muscles
, say a limited ammount of stuff
, adn kill a bunch of guys
,
then they figure nobody
' ll notice
. that
' s the trouble withthe me
,
* i
* notice
. schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney
, or as much money as he got fo this
, bu hollywood thinks he does
. patrick stewart was the person i
' d heard that was considered tothe play freeze
,
and he woudl
' ve been so much better
. or sean connery
,
but nto arnold
" i
' m not an actor
,
but i play one in real life
" schwarzenegger
. i realize that you must be a star to play a major role infront a batman film
, bu it owudl
' ve been nice if they
' d casted a star that hadnt talent for tje role
. akiva goldsmith
' s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film
. inwhich a regular batman film
, they
' d concenrate on tyhe relationship with the girlfriend a little more
,
but elle macpherson
' s julie madison is so limited here thyat we never get a rela sense of who she is
. there is talk of a fifth batman movei
. my interest to see it isnt low
, bu i hope it
' s better than this
. if you don
' t whant to waste your time
, rent any ofthe the other batman movies from blockbuster
. any other
.
