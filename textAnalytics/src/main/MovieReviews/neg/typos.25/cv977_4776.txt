" four rooms
" was supposed to be one of tghe biggest hits of the year
. key word here
:
" supposed
.
" four of the biggest directors inspite hollywood
: quentin tarantino
, robert rodriguez
, alex
ander rockwell
,
and alison
anders were all directing oen big film with a big
and popular cast
. i guess it ws all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop ofthe the year
and it could ofthe been gerat
. the plot
: it
' s new years eve anbd it
' s a bellboy
' s first day onthe the job
. he encounters many mysterious
and kinky hotel guests as he tries to h
andle all his own problems
. tarantino told his directors this plot
, annd each ofthe them wrote a script
. it turned outloud each of them had written a dark comedy
.
anders wrote annd directed the tale about a coven of witchs
( madonna
, valeria golino
, alicia witt
,
and ione skye
)
, which was tyhe worst one out of all ofthe them
. the second room
( jennifer beals
) was better
, bu lacking in plot
. tihs room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping wiht his wife
. the third room
( antonio b
anderas
) was yhe best roomm
, about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel usite
. the final one
( tarantino
, willis
) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy tothe chop off somone
' s finger
. the movie ws just plain trash
. there wass nothing here that even makes up a quality film
. it ws nto funny
, adn i didn
' t hear one laugh in hte theather throughout the whole film
. tim roth isnt horrible as tyhe bumbling adn mumbling bellboy
,
and he ruins every joke iin the film
. tyhe supporting cast loses meaning to the owrd support
and the only mentionable actors
/ actresses are antonio b
anderas
and jennifer beals
. marisa tomei appears infront a stupid cameo role
. this movei is the worst film of tjhe eyar
and the film sould hve been great
, perhaps like a more upbeat
" plaza suie
,
" bu it wasn
' t
. as trashy as it ws
, some peopel will call it clasic
. do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna
' s chest showing a classic film
? look for more of ken
' s kritic korner coming soon
