possibly the years the most anticipated film annd finally it arrives here in the uk
. it smashed u
. s box office office records in it
' s oppening weekend
and wiull noone doubt do the same here
.
but isnt it any ogod
? iin a word
, no
. i
' ll elaborate further
. the story is as follows
. apparently htere were two isl
ands with dinosaurs on
. one where the dinos lieved untouched by mankind anbd the otehr a tourist attraction whihc failed before it even opened
.
( see jurrasic park
.
) imgen
, the comany taht funded jurrasic park
, wanna to reccover their losses by tkaing more dinos off the other isl
and annd move them to a new attraction in san diago
. realizing what a bad idea this is
, proffessor john hammond
( richard attenborough
) decides to send a team to doccument the dinosaurs
, so as to rally publich support to preserve tyhe isl
and
. enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees tothe go when told his girlfriend is already there
. so
, basically
, wqat you have is this
. two teams
, oen sent to catch
and move some dinosaurs tothe the mainl
and
and the other
, trying tothe document them
, being forced to work toghether
, fighting for survival against the dinosaurs
' firm intentions on eating them
. a fairly good idea
,
however it
' s let down by one slight probelm
. it
' s crap
. over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring
, way too quiclky
. add to this a terrable script
and soem feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation anbd you end up very disinterested
. it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things liuke
,
' what
' s for tea
?
' adn
' should ytou cut the lawn later
?
'
( yes
, you should
)
. it
' s a shame
then really
, tyhat spielberg has lowered himself into making whta essentially is a blatant cash infact
, which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park
. with only a few creative
and genuinely tense scenes adn fabulous c
. g
. i dinosaurs
( thte t
. rex
' s hve to be seen to be believed
)
, there is nothing else to recommend the lost world
. a very dissapointing sequel
, indeed
.
