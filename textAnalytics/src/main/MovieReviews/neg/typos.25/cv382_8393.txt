possibly the years the most anticipated film
and finally it arrives here in the uk
. it smashed u
. s box office office records inaddition it ' s opening weekend
and will no doubt do the same here
.
but is it any good
? in a word
, no
. i ' ll elaborate futher
. the story is as follows
. apparently there were two islands whith rinosarus onthe
. one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind
anbd the other a tourist attraction wich failed befoer it even oppened
.
( see jurrasic park
.
) imgen
, the company that funded jurrasic park
, want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island
and move them to a new attraction in san diago
. realizing what a bad idea this is
, proffessor john hammond
( richard attenborough
) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs
, so as tothe rally publich suppost to preserve the island
. enter familliar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there
. so
, basically
, what ytou have is this
. twpo teams
, one sent to catch
and move smoe dinosaurs to the mainland
and the other
, trying to document them
, bieng forced to work together
, fighting for survival against the dinosaurs ' firm intentions on eating them
. a fairly ogod idea
,
however it ' s let down by oen slight problem
. it ' s crap
. over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring
, way too quiclky
. add to thsi a terrible script
annd some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation
adn yuo end up very disinterested
. it becomes background noise hwile your mind starts concentrating onthe thigsn liek
, ' what ' s fo tea
? '
and ' shoudln you cut the lawn later
? '
( yes
, you should
)
. it ' s a shame
then really
, that spielberg has lowered himselv into making what essentialy is a blatant cash in
, which adds practically nothing to hte far superior jurrasic park
. with only a few creative
anbd genuinely tense scenes
and fabulous c
. g
. i dinosaurs
( the t
. rex ' s have to be seen to be believed
)
, htere is nothing else to recommend tjhe lost world
. a very dissapointing sequel
, indeed
.
