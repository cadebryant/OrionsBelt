' s latest film
,
" the game
"
, four words come to mind
.
" don
' t believe the hype
.
" this michael douglas vehicle
, from the director of
" seven
"
, isn
' t nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it owudl have us believe
. the film draws us in with an intriguing concept
( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer
) where a jaded millionaire
( douglas
) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy
. this isn
' t simply virtual reality
. this is real life with a deadly twist
. onthe his 48th birthday
, nicholas van orton
( douglas
) is invited to dinner by his underachieving yuonger brother
, conrad
( sean penn
)
. conrad has a special birthday present for his brother
. he h
ands nicholas a gift certificate
and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services
.
" they make your life funn
,
" conrad tells him
. nicholas humors his brother
, telling him he
' ll call
,
but it
' s clear he has noone time forthe any foolish
,
" fantasy role
- playing
,
" as he calls it
.
then
, fo reasons that are never really made clear
, nicholas decides to go to crs anbd see what they
' re all about
. he ends up spending a wohle day going through their screening process
, which to me made no sence considering the tight schedule he keesh claiming to have
. nevertheless
, when it seems nicholas has beeen rejected as a crs client
, the weird things strat happening
. ofthe course
, when we
' ve only covered baout 30 mintues of screen tiem
, what else should we expect
. douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful
, violent
and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen h
ands
. one of those films
,
" basic instinct
"
, came from thte creative minds of writer
, joe eszterhas
and director
, paul verhoeven
. the premise of
" the game
,
" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film
,
" total recall
.
" in that case
, the premise ws implanting somone else
' s memories as a way to enhance one
' s pwn life through a dream vacation
.
yet
, in both films
, the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience
. we live the adventure along with the protoganist
, reacting to each twist
and turn
. in theory
, hte key to the suspense is not bieng to tell wqat is real annd what isn
' t
. all we can do is hang onthe until tjhe end of the ride
, when the truth is finally revealed
. now
, fo those of ytou who forgot
, let me say this again
.
" don
' t believe the hype
.
"
" the game
" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride
. as a suspense
- thriller
, it doesn
' t do much
but spin in circles
. by thge third reel
, i was fighting back sleep
and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot
. is it any wonder douglas won
' t be able to resist the charms of a mysterious
, potentially life
- threatening blonde
( ever heared of glenn close
? noone
? well
, how baout sharon stone
?
thought so
)
. if anytying infact this film surprises you at all
, i would guess ytou haven
' t seen that many films
. there is no suspense here
. trust me
, i looked hard to find some
. i had tothe settle for contrived gimmicks
and ridiculously implausible situations
. fincher aim
' s for hitchcock
but l
ands somwhere jsut north of joe eszterhas
. there are those that might say
" tjhe game
" isnt not intended to be viewed literally
. i owudl submit that is exactlly the way i tried tothe veiw teh film
. tghe film simply doesnt not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues
. there is a moment early inspite the film where van orton
, realizing his game hasnt begun
, smiles as he walks through the airprot trying tothe figure out who
' s in on tjhe whole thign
. he isnt charged by his paranoia
. he is looking at the world through new eyes
. it is the last
thought
- provoking moment in the film
. fomr there on
, tghe directer onyl wants tothe stay a step ahead of us
. any siginificant archtype thgat is set up in the beginning of thte film is simply turned into a plot divice
. at the outset
, we
' re told earch
" game
" is tailored to the individual
. ultimately
, this
" gaem
" isnt supposed to owrk like a crucible
, trying this obscenely wealthy
and emotionally detatched aristocrat by fier
, proving his soul
.
yet
, as douglas endures his personal gauntlet
, we
' re given veyr few pieces ofthe tyhe puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is
. i wanted to like this film omre than i did
. i look at it as just anothergreat diea
, poorly realized
. i can thikn ofthe at least two other superior films where watching yhe film didn
' t mean we were seing what was realy happening
. bryan singer
' s
" the usual suspects
" forthe one
, a film that ws truly unique in its abilty tothe git you lost inwhich teh details before pulling back to show you thte full masterpiece on the canvas
. also
, there is the underated
" jacob
' s ladder
,
" with tim robbins
, a film tath really has to be watched twice befor you recognize the significance of all its symbolism
. here are two examples of films thyat don
' t simpley manipulate fo manipulations
' sake
. there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place
. one major issue that comes uv in
" the game
" is whther or not the hwole
" illution
" isnt just a highly sophisticated con game
. well
, i can tell you right now
, after you
' ve spended your
$ 7 dollars
, you may be asking yourself the same thing
.
