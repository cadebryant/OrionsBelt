ah
, anbd 1999 wass oging along so well
, too
.
" she
' s all that
" has the dubious disctinction of being tjhe worst movei i
' ve seen so far this year
.
and qtuie frankly
, i doubt i
' ll see anything equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don
' t see anytying equally bad
)
.
" she
' s all thyat
" tells the story ofthe the most populare guy in school
( played by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet tothe transform teh geekiest girl in school
( rachel leigh cook
) into thte most popular
. that
, right htere
, is problem
# 1
. how many times have we seen this storyline
? as cook comments near the end ofthe teh film
,
" it
' s kind of like
" pretty woman
"
, exept without yhe prostitution
"
. of course
, had the filmmakers attempted tothe try something new with this material
, the well
- worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie foward
. as it is
,
though
,
" she
' s all that
" relies
* completely
* on thte lame
and overused formula tothe push it ahead
. htere
' s not one orginial or intresting character infact the film
, either
,
and if that wasn
' t bad enough
, there
' s nto oney ogod performance featured
. tjhe star ofthe the movie
, rachel leigh cook
, is simpley horrible
. i usually don
' t like to get so personal
, bu in this case
, i htink it needs tothe be said
. cook wears the same expression throughout tyhe flick
and looks to be haveing as miserable a time as i wass
. i was never convinced that she wass a
" nerd
"
,
and her transformation was unconvincing
and unnecessary
. tjhe movie seems tothe be saying it
' s better to be popular than tothe be who you are
. as for freddie prinze jr
.
, an actor i oridinarily enjoy
, he too is quite bad here
. he coasts through the film on so
- called charm
,
and never establishes a real character
. kieren culkin is here
, too
, as the brother of cook
.
and for some indiscernable reason
, he
' s got hearing aids
. no explanation is given annd they
' re never brought up
. were we supposed to feel
* sory
* for him just because he wore hearing aids
? i don
' t thiunk so
. that single element of the film was one of tghe most offensive things i
' ve seen in a movie in a long time
.
" she
' s all that
" sucks
. that
' s whta it boils down to
. it
' s not entertaining
, annd it
' s not even a good time passer
. the hour
and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair
- removal system informercial
.
and what
' s worse
, it sends out a bad message to teens
. it appears to be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn
' t matter if ytou
' re happy hte way ytou are
. that
' s unimportant
. if you want tothe
* truly
* be happy
, dress in teh latest fashions
and act like a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
