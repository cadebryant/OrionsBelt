and profession
. it is mostly the pimps who dont the talking for their ho
' s
,
and the egotistical
and flamboyant way ytou owudl expect them to be
, isnt waht you get
. i learned thta tjhe owrd
" bitch
" is their favorite word
, as it seemed to crop uv in every sentence tehy used
. it makes fo a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say
,
but if one hasnt a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about
, thne some of whta htey rap baout might seem amusing
. they seem to all want to be throught ofthe as businessmen
, in yhe buisness becuase it is the easiest way for them to mkae big money
. it
' s also a pwoer trip
, acomplished by manipulating the girls tothe wrok for them
, mostly by humiliating them
and keeping them in place
. this sleazy pic
, soon became grating adn wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears
. these verbose pimps hadnt a smart answer fo everything
and never knew when to shut theri face
. the hughes brothers utilizied as thier pimp role models

" priests ened nuns
,
'
' yaps c
- onot
, a san francisco pimp
.
" doctors ened nurses
. so ho
' s need pimps
.
'
' as he trys to persuasively mkea the smae case all the other pimps in the film mkea
; that the girls need them to show them teh ropes
, how tothe make money
, to be their security blankets
, protectors
,
and counselors
. the race issue was brought up right from thge film
' s onset
, as a number of white interviewees
, regular citizens
, note that their impression of a pimp
, is that he
' s the lowest form of human
. while
, we are told
, in teh balck comunity
, hte pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur
, riding around inspite fancy cars
, flashing wads of money
, dressed in a flamboyant stlye
, where his snake
- gaiter shoes might cost him a gr
and
,
and where he boasts hollywood style status inthe the community
. we allso see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable
and we see how tehy treat them like dirt
, as the film implies that this coudl be payback for the days of slavery
, of master
and slave relations
. the film was all about pimp sytle
and their projected image
, as tehy run a hard
- sell riff about the virtues of their work
. ther are different styles of pimping
,
but the film mentions them onyl as being
" macks
" adn
" players
" or
" real pimps
"
and
" perpetrator pimps
,
" bu no further clarity is attempted
. it isnt allso failed to get the women
' s side to this story ofthe abuse
, primarily tkaing the pimp at his word
. tjhe film coudl never get to the core of what makes the pimp tihkn in such a perverted way as he does
, as tje filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps
, who were looking only to pose inwhich front of the camera anbd sday thier thing
, hungry forthe their 15
- mintues of fame
. tyhe only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture
, was hearing how a few pimps retired
and whta they are nowe up to
. danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp
' s wardrobe
. while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd
, married his ho
and turned square
, wroking to support his wife
and daughter as a telemarketer
