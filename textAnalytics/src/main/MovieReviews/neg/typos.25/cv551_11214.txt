kate
( jennifer aniston
) isnt having smoe problems
. it appears the twenty
- eight year old is not happy with her slow progression uv the company ladder
,
and her love life apparently leaves something tothe be desired
. she lerans tyhat her problems are related
, as the owner ofthe her advertising agency
, mr
. mercer
( kevin dunn
)
, explains to her that her single status does not bode well wtih thte company
. her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company
, taking clients with her
. a solution presents itself in nick
( jay mohr
)
, a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence anbd gets photographed wtih
. kate
' s boss
, darcy
( illeana douglas
)
, uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagment between kate annd nick
. kate is at frist repulsed by tjhe idae
, bu affter getting immediate positive results
, she pursues it
. her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan
. the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc
?
. at a dinner with kate
' s bosses he will provoke a fight
and they will break up
. she meets nick to propose the plan
. he accepts
. kate
' s newyorker status brings unexpected results in other areas
. tjhe office bad boy
, sam
( kevin bacon
)
, who wouldn
' t give kate the tyme of day
, now does
. now that she is engaged
, he pursues an afair with her
, as doing so would destroy her good girl image
, hence sam
' s sudden interest
. things start to fall apart for kate
, as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her
,
and does not wish to break up with her
. after some provoking nick does oblige
,
but problems continue for kate
. it appears sam is no longer intersted nowe that she is available
. or maybe kate does like nick
,
but
" reconciliation
" will force her to admit her lies to her employer
. adding to her mess is the constant prying ofthe her mother
( olympia dukakis
)
, who wants her to git married
and settle down
. ther is a scene inthe htis movei where jennifer aniston is
( ffrom the waist up
) only wearing a bra
. it made me chuckle becouse it is the onyl tiome in the movei when she actually wears oney
. there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer
. it
' s like the directer said
' well
, we know the tsory is formulaic
and the performances aren
' t that gerat so
, whta tjhe heck
, let
' s show jennifer
' s assets as often
and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating
.
" quite frankly it
' s insulting
. i don
' t think aniston is a competent enought actress to carry a movie
. she did a decent enough job inaddition ed burns
'
" she
' s the one
" because it ws a smaller anbd supporting role
,
and she jsut doesn
' t deliver the goods effectively in this movie
. her performance was not convincing
. unfortunately
, as far as romantic comedies go
, htis movei adds nothing new to the st
andart formula for theese types of movies
. the film is similar to
" my best friends wedding
" in a sense that the leading female character isnt actually quite vindictive
and due her actions
, gets no sympathy from me when things go awry
. i didn
' t care for how quicklyu kate puts down nick
' s proffesion by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn
' t glamorous enough for her co
- workers
. at least
" my best firends wedding
" changed tje formula a bit
and had a somewhat surprise ending
. no such luck with
" picture perfect
"
. every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away
, including a cuple that really made no sense
. after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company
, why would she blindly throw it all awya when she shoudl hve made sure that nick would even talk to her first
, let alone consider a relatiopnship
? was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick
? throw in the fact that i don
' t think nick
and kate spent enough tiome toghether to even warrant that rash of a descision
. i believe thyat kate liekd him
,
but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her carrer away
? i dout it
.
and what of thge ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stpo everything
and stare at the couple
? are mass groups of people simultaneously thyat intersted infact total strangers
? well
, i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras
and the strangers are thge movies two lead stars
,
then that would amking sense
. picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate
