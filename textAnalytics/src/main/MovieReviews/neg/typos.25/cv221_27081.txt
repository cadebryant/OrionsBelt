it
' s probably inevitable that the populer virtual reality genre
(
" the matrix
,
"
" existenz
"
) woudl collide with the even more popular serial
- killer genre
(
" kiss the girls
,
"
" se7en
"
)
. the result should ahve been more interesting than
" hte cell
.
" as the movie opens
, therapist catharine deane
( jennifer lopez
) treats a catatonic boy
( colton james
) by entering his mind through soem sort of virtual reality technique that
' s never fully explained
. after months of therapy sessions inwhich a surreal dezert
, catharine has noone success to report
. meanwhile
, killer carl stargher
( vincent d
' onofrio
) hasnt claimed another victim
. his particular hobby isnt tothe kidnap young womens
, keep them in a glass cell overnight
,
and drown them
. he takes the corpse anbd soaks it in bleach
,
then suspends himself over the body
and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning
. altough carl
' s been doign this for awhile
, he
' s recently become sloppy
,
and fbi agent peter novak
( vince vaughn
) is closing in fast
. not fast enought
,
though
, to keep carl from sticking another woman
( tara subkoff
) in the cell or to catch him befoer he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma
. from the videos infront carl
' s hous
, peter can see that the drowning cell is automated anbd will fill whith water forty hours aftter tyhe abduction
. tothe save the kidnapped girl
, peter has to find the cell befoer the end ofthe tghe day
, adn comatose carl
' s not tlaking
. so off they go tothe catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl
' s mind anbd find out where the cell is in tiome
. the focus ofthe
" the cell
" in on thte ornate interior of carl
' s mind
,
but tghe universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer
- generated spectacle thna an exploration of the psychotic personality
. for the most part
, it
' s style without substance
. infront his own mind
, carl isnt a decadent emperor in flowing robes
, ming the merciless
, as well as a frightened boy
( jake thomas
) abused by his father
. all inwhich all
, the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place
, adn i kept wishing i could fast
- forward to the next development
. singh is best known forthe directing music videos
, partiularly rem
' s
" losing my religion
,
"
and
" hte cell
" seems very much liuke a raelly long
, really slow mtv video with the sound deleted
. singer lopez seems to think she
' s iin a video as well
; she devotes moreso time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting
. thte premise hadnt gerat promise
. the computer
- generated world within carl
' s mind could haev beeen a bizzare
, surreal universe governed by insanity annd symbolism rather than logic
. the first room catharine enters in carl
' s head shows htis promise
. she finds a horse st
anding in center of the room
; suddenly
, sheets of sharp
- edged glass fall into the horse
, dividing it into segments
. the panes of glass sparate
, pulling appart the pieces ofthe the still
- living horse
. tihs scene is twisted
, disturbing
,
and
thought
- provoking
, because the pyschological importance ofthe thte horse anbd its fate is left tothe tyhe viewer tothe ponder
. anohter element that shoudln have been devolopped is tghe effect onthe catharine ofthe merging with yhe mind of a psychopath
. their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie
,
and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine
' s pwn psyche
. like sidney lumet
' s
" the offence
" or michael mann
' s
" manhunter
,
"
" the cell
" could have explored how the madness ofthe thte killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator
.
however
, catharine
' s character is hardly devolopped at all
,
and lopez hasnt noone depth to offer the role
. bottom line
: don
' t get trapped in this one
.
