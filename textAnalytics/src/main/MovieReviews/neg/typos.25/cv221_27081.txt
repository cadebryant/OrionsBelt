it ' s probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre
(
" the matrix
,
"
" existenz
"
) would collide withthe the even more popular serial
- killer genre
(
" kiss teh girls
,
"
" se7en
"
)
. the result should have been more interesting than
" tghe cell
.
" as the movie opens
, therapist catharine deane
( jennifer lopez
) treats a catatonic boy
( colton james
) by entering his mind thru some sort of virutal reality technique that ' s never fully explained
. affter monthes of therapy sessions in a surreal desert
, catharine hasnt noone success to report
. meanwhile
, killer carl stargher
( vincent d ' onofrio
) has claimed anyother victum
. his particular hobby is to kidnap young womens
, keep them in a glass cell overnight
,
and drown them
. he takes the corpse
adn soaks it in bleach
,
thn suspends himself over the body
annd jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning
.
although carl ' s been doing this for awhile
, he ' s recently become sloppy
,
and fbi agent peter novak
( vince vaughn
) is closing in fast
. not fast enough
,
though
, tothe keep carl from sticking another woman
( tara subkoff
) in the cell or to catch him befoer he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma
. from the videos inspite carl ' s hous
, peter can see thast the drowning cell is automated
and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction
. to save the kidnapped girl
, peter has to find tyhe cell before teh end of the day
,
and comatose carl ' s not talking
. so off they go tothe catharine inwhich the hope that she can go inside carl ' s mind
and find out where tjhe cell is in time
. the focus ofthe
" the cell
" in onthe the ornate interior of carl ' s mind
,
bu tghe universe directer tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise inaddition computer
- generated spectacle than an exploration of teh psychotic personality
. forthe the most part
, it ' s style without substance
. in his own mind
, carl is a decadent emperor inspite flowing robes
, ming the merciless
, as well as a frightened boy
( jake thomas
) abused by his father
. all infront all
, thte mind of a psycho killer turns out tothe be a strangely dull place
,
and i kept wishing i sould fast
- foward tothe the next development
. singh is best known forthe directing music videos
, particulraly rem ' s
" losing my religion
,
"
and
" the cell
" seems very much like a really long
, really slow mtv video whith the sound deleted
. singer lopez seems tothe think she ' s in a video as well
; she devotes more time tothe posing in elaborite costumes than she does to acting
. the premise had great promise
. the coputer
- generated world within carl ' s mind could have been a bizarre
, surreal universe governed by insanity
adn symbolism rather than logic
. the frist room catharine enters in carl ' s head shows this promise
. she finds a horse standing in center of teh room
; suddenly
, sheets of sharp
- edged glass fall into the horse
, dividing it into segments
. the panes of glass separate
, pulling apart the pieces of the still
- living horse
. this scene isnt twisted
, disturbing
,
anbd thought
- provoking
, because the psychological importance of the horse
and its fate is left tothe the viewer to ponder
. another element that should have been developed is tghe effect on catharine of merging with yhe mind of a psychopath
. their minds begin tothe bleed toghether at one point in the movei
,
and htis should have provded an opportunity to discover the dark corners ofthe catharine ' s own psyche
. like sidney lumet ' s
" the offence
" or michael mann ' s
" manhunter
,
"
" the cell
" could have explored how the madness of teh killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator
.
however
, catharine ' s character is hardly developed at all
,
adn lopez has no depth to offer the role
. bottom line
: don ' t get trapped in htis one
.
