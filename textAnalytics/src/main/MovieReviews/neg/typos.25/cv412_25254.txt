it seemed like the perfect consept
. whta better fo the farrelly brothers
, famous for writing
and directing comedies with offensive subject marter
, than to amke a movie about a guy with a split perosnality
? it
' s exactly the sort of thing tje brothers relish
: poking fun at something serious
( inthe this case mental illness
)
, throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh
. jim carrey
' s signed onthe too
? even better
. the national alliance fo the mentally ill even helpped outloud by levying complaints aginst the brothers
' new film befoer its oppening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of splitted personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
" annd so forth
. such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing taht would
, of course
, only add more fuel to yhe farrelly brothers
' fire
, proving that some peopel jsut couldn
' t take a joke
, adn tyhat the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to
yet another dose ofthe their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but oen thing went wrong
: their movei isn
' t funny
. it
' s not for lack ofthe trying
. the farrellys utilize inaddition
" me
, myself
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wife forthe a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside
and never realease them
. this
, of course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie
' s repressed agression manifests itself into a second
, independet personality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his precedessor had beeen unable to muster
. this guy isn
' t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he
' s been insulted
, or holding a little girl
' s head underwater because she refused to stop jump
- roping inaddition the street
.
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted
,
and the film runs off its tracks
. some have suggested that this isn
' t a problem
, because the farrelly brothers
' br
and of humor doesn
' t require plot to work
. they
' re wrong
, of course
: plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys
' last effort
, 1996
' s
" there
' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999
' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers
' earlier film wasn
' t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags
( dispite whta some newsmagazine articles woudl have you believ
)
,
but rether because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" hte farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight
- ofthe
- h
and trick
: they
' d have you thinking the story was going one way
,
then reveal its rela direction in delightfully surprising fashion
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems tothe have beeen made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
and saw only the surface grossness
, missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work
. having been produced by tghe same guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liek an even bigger disappointment
. the brothers pile on tyhe offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental ilness
,
and all manner ofthe bathroom jokes
. bu they haven
' t come up with a way to make any ofthe it fresh
; most ofthe
" me
, myself
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- the
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. the plot
, with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who
' s in more trouble than anyone knows
, back tothe new york
, has an ending that
' s entirely predictable ffrom the get
- go
.
( think charlie
and irene will fall in love
? yeah
, me too
.
) teh farrellys
then introduce scores ofthe diffrent characters
, anbd none of them ever manage to dont anytying ytou haven
' t alrady expected them to do
, noone matter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared to the curveballs hte farrellys are used to throwing
, this stuff is almsot entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious problem
: when gross
- out humor loses its shock value
, it
' s no longer funny
, merely gross
. the jokes that do work are milked over
and over utnil their effectiveness runs dry
. take
, for example
, the subplot involving charlie
' s three black sons
( anthony
anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity of it all is funny for a while
, with three burly black men discussing higher math inaddition ghetto language adn white
- bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too
- plesant smile on his face
.
but by the end of the film
, htey
' re still doing the same schitck
; it hasn
' t been elevated to another
, funnier levle
, annd it hasn
' t been dropped either
. that
' s too bad
, baceause it ceases tothe be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks ofthe wasted opportunities
. ther ought tothe be more focus on how other people react to charlie
' s new personality
,
and onthe how charlie deals with the consequences of hank
' s actions
. thsi doesn
' t raelly happen
; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie
' s condition early on
, so htey don
' t haev any opportunity tothe be surprised by it
. thge film throws what looks liek a pattented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pick up called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
, bu the script doesn
' t go anywhere witht it
, instead leaving the thread twisting inspite the wind before awkwardly tying it up durig the climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physicaly anbd vocally
,
but he
' s left with nothing much tothe do here except contort himself in a manner silimar to steve martin in
" all of me
.
" it
' s a grat showcase of flexibility
and split
- second role
- shifting
,
but none of it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn
' t pull any stunts we don
' t expect him to pull
,
and the farrellys
' script doesn
' t give him anything else to pull
: yhe situations inthe whlch he must perform thte role
- shifting aren
' t set up in any meaningfull way
. prehaps carrey can tkae solace in the fact tath his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger
' s irene isnt not a storng female lead
; mary inspite
" mary
" may have been part adolescent fantasy
,
but she was alsot intelligent
and strong
- willed
. irene is nothing in particular
, as the film never makes clear whether she
' s ditzy
, clever
, or neither
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only
" sane
" person in the film
. chris cooper is sticked palying exactly oney note as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his character is entirely too straight
- laced for a movie like this
. he
, like tyhe others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. after viewing the shapeless mess that
" me
, mysef
& irene
" eventually disolved into
, i ws sticked wondering whether or not the farrellys hadnt outsmarted themselves
. maybe their kind ofthe comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it
and stop being shocked
. bu i don
' t believe it
-
- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even affter people ahev grown attuned to thier stlye
. if the farrellys are indeed ogod
, smart filmmakers
(
and i still think they are
)
, they
' ll rebound just fine
. even aftter that happens
,
though
, i
' ll still consider
" me
, myself
& irene
" to be a high
- calibur misfire
.
