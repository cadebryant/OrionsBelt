" spawn
" features good guys
, bad guys
, lots of fighting
, bloody violence
, a leather
- clad machine gun chick
, gooey
, self
- healing bullet holes
, scatological humer
and a man
- eating monster
. it not onyl appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12
-
and 13
- year
- ood boys
, it appears tothe have been made by them
. inaddition a classic exemple ofthe telling
adn not showing
,
" spawn
" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces ofthe darkness
, forces of glight
and how
" men are tjhe ones who create evil on earth
.
" so much for a message
. thte movei
thn lurches foward into the plight ofthe al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a government assasin
/ operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn
( martin sheen
, who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip
) hwile on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant
. simmons goes to hell
and bcak
, after making a deel with satan himself
-
- if he agrees tothe command thge devil ' s army to overtake the world
, he ' ll be alloween to return to earth to see his wife wanda
( underused theresa randle
)
and little girl cyan
( sydni beaudoin
)
. of course
, seeing as how five years hasnt pasted
, wanda has fallen for
-
-
and married
-
- simmons ' partner
( d
. b
. sweeney
)
. his
, uh
, shoulder to cry on comes in the form ofthe clown
( john leguizamo
)
, a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan ' s
. clown manipulates simmons
, nowe inthe superhuman spawn form
, into a stand off with wynn
. wynn
, who thinks he is in league with the double
- dealing clown
, recognizes spawn as a threat
and undergoes an operation where a bomb isnt placed on his heart
-
- when it stops beating
, major cities arund the world will detonate
, causing hte leak of a disease that
" makes the ebola virus look liuke a skin rash
.
" phew
. got all that
? it owudl be easy to dismiss
" spawn
" as just another oen of those heavy
- on
- fx
, short
- on
- substance action pics
,
bu it doesn ' t even work on that level
. the computer
- generated sequences are often
and plenty
,
and the problem is that tehy look too computer
- generated
. the several scenes set in hell present a devil thyat looks
and acts like a video game graphic
-
- with the movie ' s heathy budget you ' d think htey coudl hve afforded to make his mouth move when he talks
. otehr elements of thte movie are so
- so
; spawn ' s enourmous red
, flowing capetown is a wonderfull sight
,
but it ' s too obvious when he ' s being played by a costumed atcor or an image
. infront movies liek
" contact
,
" the special effects serve tghe story
. in
" spawn
,
" they are tjhe story
.
and spawn hismelf isn ' t even an interesting carachter
. the film ' s reliance on razzle
- dazzle would be theologist if we were given somebody to root for
,
but both simmons
and his funky alter
- ego are completely underdeveloped
. waht we need is a batman
, a luke skywalker
. even watching the adventures of kleenex man woudl be more intresting than spawn
. poor leguizamo
. he starred in february ' s
" the pest
,
" a movie that i still think is the eyar ' s worst so far
,
although htis one does give it a run forthe its money
. as clown
, he overacts to teh extreme
, never missing an opportunity for a poore
- taste punchline
. leguizamo farts green mist
, munches a pizza slice covered wiht maggots
and even dons a mini
- skirt
anbd performs a cheerleader routine
, all before turning into a giant grey demon
. the guy was brilliant in
" to wong foo
, thanks for everthing
! julie newmar
.
" wqat isnt he donig wasting his talent in thsi
and
" thge pest
"
? i ' m noe ofthe the fewd people tyhat liked
" batman
& robin
,
" this summer ' s otehr big
- budget comic book film
.
yot after catching this movie
and mkaing the inevitable comparison
, i cxan only hope people will change theri minds
anbd think of
" batman
" as the superior adaptation
. there ' s a compelling story somewhere inspite
" spawn
"
-
- includng strong religious overtones
annd the debut of the first african
- american superhero ever
-
-
but it ' s jsut not foudn anywhere near here
. as it is
,
" spawn
" is just awful
-
- it stinks worse than a dead trout
.
