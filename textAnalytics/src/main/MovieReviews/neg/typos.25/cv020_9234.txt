" spawn
" features ogod guys
, bad guys
, lots of fighting
, bloody violentce
, a leather
- clad machine gun chick
, gooey
, self
- healing bullet holes
, scatological humor
and a man
- eating monster
. it nto only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12
-
and 13
- yera
- old boys
, it appears to have beeen made by them
. in a clasic exemple of telling
and not showing
,
" spawn
" opens with a truckload ofthe mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness
, forces of light
and how
" men are the ones who create evil on earth
.
" so much for a message
. the movie thn lurches forward into thte plight of al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a government assassin
/ operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn
( martin sheen
, who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip
) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant
. simmons goes to hell
and back
, after making a dael with satan hismelf
-
- if he agrees tothe comm
and the devil
' s army to overtake the world
, he
' ll be allowed tothe return to earth tothe see his wife w
anda
( underused theresa r
andle
)
and littel girl cyan
( sydni beaudoin
)
. of course
, seeing as how five years has pasted
, w
anda hasnt fallen for
-
-
and married
-
- simmons
' partner
( d
. b
. sweeney
)
. his
, uh
, sholder to cry on comes in the form of clown
( john leguizamo
)
, a disgustingly disproportiate minion of satan
' s
. clown manipulates simmons
, now in superhuman spawn form
, into a st
and off wtih wynn
. wynn
, who thinks he is inwhich league with tje doulbe
- dealing clown
, recognizes spawn as a threath adn undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart
-
- whn it stops beating
, major cities aroud thge world will detonate
, causing the leak of a disease thgat
" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash
.
" phew
. got all thyat
? it would be easy to dismiss
" spawn
" as just another noe of those heavy
- on
- fx
, short
- on
- substance acation pics
,
but it doesn
' t even work onthe that levle
. the computer
- generated sequences are often
and plenty
,
and the problem is that they look too cmoputer
- generated
. the severeal scenes set in hell present a devil that looks
and acts like a video game graphic
-
- wtih the movie
' s heathy budget you
' d think htey could have afforded tothe make his mouth move when he talks
. other elements of tje movei are so
- so
; spawn
' s enormous red
, flowing cape is a wonderful sight
,
but it
' s too obvious when he
' s bieng played by a costumed actor or an omage
. in movies like
" contact
,
" the special effects serve hte stor
. in
" spawn
,
" they are the story
.
and spawn himself isn
' t even an interesting character
. the film
' s reliance on razzle
- dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for
,
but both simmons anbd his funky alter
- ego are completely underdeveloped
. what we need is a batman
, a luke skywalker
. even watching the adventures ofthe kleenex man would be more interesting tahn spawn
. poore leguizamo
. he starred in february
' s
" the pest
,
" a movie that i still htikn is tyhe year
' s worst so far
,
al
though this oen does give it a run for its moeny
. as clown
, he overacts to tghe extreme
, never missing an opportunity for a poor
- tast punchline
. leguizamo farts green mist
, munches a pizza slice covered iwth maggots adn even dons a mini
- skirt anbd performs a cheerleader routine
, all befoer turning into a giant grvey demon
. tje guy ws brilliant in
" to wong foo
, thanks for everything
! julie newmar
.
" what isnt he doing wasting his talent in this
and
" the pest
"
? i
' m one of the few people that liked
" batman
& robin
,
" htis summer
' s other big
- budget comic book film
.
yet after catching this movie
and making the inevitible comparison
, i can only hope peopel wiull chanage their minds
and think ofthe
" batman
" as thte superior adaptation
. there
' s a compelling stopry somwhere in
" spawn
"
-
- including strong religous overtones
and the de
but of thge first african
- american superhero ever
-
-
but it
' s just nto found anywhere near here
. as it is
,
" spawn
" is just awful
-
- it stinks worse than a dead trout
.
