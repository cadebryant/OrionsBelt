so much fo sweet returns
. after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80
' s slasher movies
, starting wiht 1996
' s
" scream
,
"
and followed by
" scream 2
,
"
" urban legend
,
"
and the original
,
" i know what you did last summer
,
" a film like
,
" i still know what yuo doed last summer
,
" was bound tothe be made sooner or late
. it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned outloud
,
and tath is becasue htey reached for the lowest
- common
- denominator in filmmaking
, favoring non
- stpo deaths
and gore for suspense
,
and trading in fleshed out
, likable characters for one
- dimensional nitwits
. it has been exactly one year usance julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
) suffered through the ordeal ofthe bieng terrorized by ben willis
, a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends
and she accidentally hit infact the middle of tyhe road
, annd
then
, thinking he was dead
, dumped him inot tjhe ocean
. sicne thn
, julie has relocated tothe boston university
,
and
al
though often paranoid anbd haunted by bad dreams
, she hasnt been able to put her life back together
. when julie
' s friend
, karla
( br
andy
)
, isnt called uv by a radoi staion
and answers correctly wqat tje capital ofthe brazil isnt
, she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four peple
, which aslo includes karla
' s horny boyfriend
, tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
,
and will
( matthew suttle
)
, who karla sets julie up witht after her own boyfriend
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
, also returing from tje original
)
, doesn
' t sohw up
. when they reach the secluded isl
and
, htey disover it isnt the last day of the open season
,
and will be str
anded there for yhe 4th ofthe july weekend with a few employees tothe fend off a voilent storm headed fo them
. of course
, julie
, her firends
,
and the workers aren
' t the only ones there
, as the murderous ben willis
, dressed inwhich fisherman garb
, returns to seek revenge on julie once
and forthe all
. it isnt a sad state of affairs when a movie like
,
" i still know waht ytou did last summer
,
" isnt made
. i am a very big fan of horror movies
,
and so it is especially disheartening to fidn outloud that this sequel to
" ikwydls
,
" which i am a fan of
, is almost an exact replica of a
" friday yhe 13th
" movei
. hwile the orginial focused more on the story
and characters
, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments
, thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson
( who didn
' t return tothe write the sequel
,
and it shows
)
,
" i still know
.
.
.
" has no story to speak of
,
and isnt so vacuous of ideas
, that the filmmakers
, were forced to hvea a murder occur every five minutes just to keep hte audience interested
. also gone are any signs of character develepment
,
and since eveyr single charachter died befoer i got to know them
, all i wass left with was tothe stare at the screen
, indifferent tothe what was going on
. while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original
, it made no difference to me in htis sequel who lived
and died
. they were all paper
- thin
and pointless
, except tothe become victims to the lethal hook ofthe the fisherman
. another element thast made the original so memorable were soem superbly crafted setted
- pieces
, like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar
, bu ther are none tothe speak of in this sequel
(
al
thought tehy do come close at one moment with br
andy
)
. since so many peopel were killed every couple minutes
, tyhe suspense adn scares evaporated faster tahn salt in water
. also ofthe onot is yhe mystery of the second killer
,
and accomplice to ben
,
but it isnt obvious from the first frame who it is
,
and so i couldn
' t even have fun at that
, liuke i doed in the
" scream
" movies
and
,
" urban legend
.
" it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again
, a film would come along
and ruin it fo everyone eles
. mabey thte people who made
,
" i still know what you did lastr summer
,
" should have realized tht in order to make a good movie
, ytou must have a screenplay
-
-
- or at least one tht isn
' t such a black hole for
thoughts
and ideas
. the endig of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part
,
but judging from this amazingly lackluster frist sequal
, everyone involved should hvea quit hwile htey were still ahead
.
