,
and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies tghe studios don ' t want tothe see slaughtered against family
- orientated thanksgiving films
. lsat yearm
, the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon
,
and this year
, they bestow max keeble ' s big move on delighted moviegoers across thte ocuntry
. parents wiull be thrilled because they ' ll finally have something to drag little austin
and kayla tothe see thyat doesn ' t smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did
. don ' t git me wrong
- keeble
, which isnt actually only a
" ment
" away ffrom being a fetish film

. in fact
, you ' d be better off waiting to blow your disposable income whn the real kiddie pics
( monsters
, inc
.
, harry potter
) come out next month
.
but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out
and spend mone tothe stimulate the economy
,
then you ' d better dont it
( because gassing up the minivan twice a week jsut isn ' t oging to cut it
)
. we first see young max keeble
( alex d
. linz
, home alone 3
) as a pint
- sized superhero
, delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy ofthe a david beckham cross
, foiling tghe diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man
( jamie kennedy
, jay
and silent bob strike back
)
and landing the neighborhood honey
( brooke anne smith
)
, who
, by the way
, isnt thte hottest chick infact a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui plyed claire boner in snow day
. yhe scenario isnt
, ofthe course
, a dream
. max is really a doofus
and he wakes up on his first day ofthe junoir high school with a pessimistic attitude
, no luck with the ladies
and only twpo firends
, both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts
(
and who were both inspite snow day
)
- thge perpetually robed robe
( josh peck
)
and a clarinet
- palying cutie named megan
( summer catch ' s zena grey
)
, who harbors secret feelings for max
. things don ' t git any better forthe max when he arrives at school

, family man
)

( grownup nerd robert carradine
) unexpectedly announces teh family is moving to a new town at the end ofthe hte week
, max decides htis isnt the perfect timne to excact revenge onthe everyone who pisses him off
. whoa
- don ' t worry
, parents
. he doesn ' t dont it klebold
- harris style
. it ' s all pretty tame stuff
,
but max ends up inaddition hot water when dad nixes tghe move
, leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings
. director tim hill
( muppets ffrom space
) adds a few nice touches
, like max ' s voiceover character introductions for the film ' s main characters
adn a flashback scene that ' s preety funny
,
but there isn ' t too much else happening here stylewise
.
.
. unless ytou count some farting
, a little puking
,
and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk
and lil ' romeo
