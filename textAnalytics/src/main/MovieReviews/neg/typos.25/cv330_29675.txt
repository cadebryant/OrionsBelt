agust
and september are a wastel
and when it comes tothe children
' s films
,
and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don
' t want tothe see slaughtered against family
- orientated thanksgiving films
. last year
, the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon
,
and this year
, tehy bestow max keeble
' s big move on delighted moviegoers across the country
. parents wiull be thrilled baceause they
' ll finally have something to drag little austin
and kayla to see that doesn
' t smell nearly as much liuke ass as digimon did
. don
' t get me wrong
- keeble
, which isnt atually only a
" ment
" away from being a fetish film
, isn
' t tyhat entertaining
. in fact
, you
' d be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics
( monsters
, inc
.
, harry potter
) come out next month
. bu if dubya dubya iii tells you to go outloud
and spend monay to stimulate thge eceonomy
, thn you
' d better dont it
( beccause gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn
' t going to cut it
)
. we firt see young max keeble
( alex d
. linz
, home alone 3
) as a pint
- sized superhero
, delivering newspapers with the pinpoint acuracy of a david beckham cross
, foiling the diabolical plans of thge evil ice cream man
( jamie kennedy
, jay
and silent bob strike back
)
and l
anding tghe neighborhood honey
( brooke anne smith
)
, who
, by the way
, isnt tghe hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui plyed claire boner in snow day
. the scenario is
, of course
, a dream
. max is really a doofus adn he wakes up on his first day ofthe junoir high skool with a pessimistic attitude
, no luck with the ladies
and only two firends
, both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts
( anbd who were both in snow day
)
- the perpetually robed robe
( josh peck
) adn a clarinet
- playing cutie named megan
( summer catch
' s zena grey
)
, who harbors sercet feelings fo max
. things don
' t git any better forthe max when he arrives at school
. he hasnt to contend with
, among other things
, a red
- hot science teacher
( amber valletta
, family man
)
, a pair of polar
- opposite bullies
( noel fisher
and orl
ando brown
)
,
and an illiterate principal
( larry miller
, the princess diaries
) who
' s secretly diverting the school
' s last dime inot the football program
. when max
' s father
( grownup nerd robert carradine
) unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new twon at the end ofthe tjhe week
, max decides this is the perfect time tothe excact revenge on everyone who pisses him off
. whoa
- don
' t worry
, parents
. he doesn
' t dont it klebold
- harris stlye
. it
' s all pretty tame stuff
,
but max ends uv inaddition hot water when dad nixes the move
, leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings
. director tim hill
( muppets from space
) adds a few nice touches
, like max
' s voiceover character introductions for the film
' s main characters
and a flashback scene that
' s preety funny
,
but there isn
' t too much else hapening here stylewise
.
.
. unless you count smoe farting
, a littel puking
,
and a cuple of bizarre cameos fomr tony hawk
and lil
' romeo
