anbd now tje high
- flying hong kong sytle ofthe filmmaking has made its way down to the classics
,
and it isn
' t preety
. this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france inaddition yhe excruciating bl
and
and lukewarm production of the musketeer
, a version ofthe dumas
' s the three musketeers
. by bringing in popular aisian ctor
/ stunt coordinator xing xing xiong
-
- whose only prior american attemts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team
and yhe dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez
-
- our musketeers are thrown into the air to dont their fighting
. the end result is a tepid
and dull action
/ adventure rip
- off that stinks ofthe indiana jones
and bad aisian kung fu
. thge story is so simple my granmother could hvea adapted the screenplay
. d
' artagnan
( justin chambers
) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer
. he travels tothe paris tothe join the royal musketeers
and find thte man that killed his parents
. in paris
, he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu
( stephen rea
)
, who is trying to overthrow the king
,
and richelieu
' s man
- infront
- black associate febre
( tim roth
)
, the killer of his folks
. he finds tyhe musketeers infront paris disb
anded annd drunk
, so he rounds up aramis
( nick moran
)
, athos
( jan gregor kremp
) adn porthos
( steven spiers
) to free tjhe musketeer
' s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king
' s prision
. d
' artagnan
and his newyorker frisky lveo interest
/ chambermaid francesca
( mena suvari
) play footsy
and coo at each other as yhe cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finaly hte queen
( catherine deneuve
) ends up being capturd by the menancing febre
, forcing the musketeers to regroup
, with d
' artagnan leading the charge
, adn save the day
. directer peter hyams
( end ofthe days
) obviously wanted to blend eastern
and western filmmaking styles
,
but here it
' s a disaster
. one problem is that
, inspite reality
, most eastern films hve tooked their lead from western ones
. jet li
' s high risk is a rip
- off of die hard
-
- not the other way around
. ironically
, there is awfully little swordplay or action inaddition the film at all
-
- maybe ten minutes ofthe swashbuckling spreaded over five scenes
. most asian acation films carry the bulk of their production with 20
- tothe 30
- minute action sequences
, becuase they know the scenes have to cary the picture
. the musketeer instead weighs itself down wiht a predictable
and monotonous screenplay by ginee quintano
( sudden death
)
, horrable acting by stephen rea
and tim roth
,
and tyhe prosaic attemt of justin chambers
( yhe wedding planner
) to deliver his mousy self as a leader
. chambers
' d
' artangnan isn
' t a musketeer
-
- he
' s a mouseketeer
!
and hyam
' s use of c
andles
and torches to light teh grime
and filth ofthe 17th century paris are well
- noted
,
but taht
' s the only st
andout in an overall flat production
