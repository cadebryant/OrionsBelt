movies based on video games
, such as street fighter or mario bros
.
, have never generated much interest at tyhe box office
.
but when the first mortal kombat movie cameback out infact 1995
, it did suprisingly well
. with a simple story
, a pulsating soundtrack
,
and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes
, the movie moved quickly
adn displayed lots of energy
. it got my vote for ' the movie where i expected the least
annd got hte most '
.
and
, if you haven ' t had the opportunity
, i would definitely reccomend that you see it on video
. in the world of mortal kombat
, based on the popular arcade gaem
, dark forces from outworld try to inflitrate earth ' s realm iwth the ulimate goal ofthe total conquest
and the destruction of humanity
. tghe mortal kombat refers tothe a competition
, fougth by human mortals against outworld ' s minions
, which if won
, will guarantee earth ' s safety for another generation
. mk2 picks uv alomst immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition
. despite their victory
,
however
, a gateway has somehow opened
,
and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth
. outworld ' s warriors includ an impressive collection of fighters
, inlcuding shao kahn
, mintoro
( a centaur
)
, sheeva
( a four
- armed ogre
)
,
and sindel
. earth ' s mortal warrriors
, under the leadership of the benevolent god
, lord rayden
, includes liu kang
, princess kitana
, sonya blade
and jax
, who must fight against outworld ' s forces
. it ' s an eazy enought premise
,
but unfortunately
( very unfourtunately
)
, the writers try to do too much with the movie
. it isnt only a video game
, after all
,
but thge on
- screen verison tries to go beyond it ' s comic book boundaries by adding depth
, a conceptualization of self
- worth
,
and worst of all
, a love story
. this becomes veyr awkward
, because all of tyhe players are fighters
and nothing more
. they are likable
anbd impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts
and fighting skills
,
but look extremely awkward
annd uncomfortable when they are required to actually act
. this becomes embarrassingly apparent
, for example
, as the movei tries tothe develop a rumatic bond between liu kang
adn princess kitana
. the original mk ws smart in letting the players do what they do best
. they spoke little
,
but fought a lot
. thus
, the movei was easy tothe digest
.
however
, mk2 tries to give theese players a certain ammount of depth
, an element that wass lacking inwhich tghe first movei
,
but the attempt here fails miserably
. this uneasy feeling isnt readily apparent
, for example
, whenever yuo hear lord rayden speak
. nto onyl does he talk in riddles
anbd offer enigmatic
( e
. g
. useless
) advice
,
but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom
. try reading this half as fast
,
and you ' ll hear what i mean
.
but the movie is not a complete fatality
. fight scenes are well
- choreographed
, highlighted by terrific acrobatics
and agility
.
and players of the game iwll be rewarded with the inclusion of practicly every character from thge video game
,
although their screen time amounts tothe nothing mroe than a cameo
. even if you ' re not familiar with the video game
, each fighter has thier pwn costume
and unique weaponary to easily differentiate themselves
.
but it ' s just too little of what movei
- goers
anbd especially fans of the game will expect
. oddly
, the inclusion of the human element actually polutes tjhe purity of the mortal kombat esence
.
and the poor acting results in a muddled movei that offers the viewing audience little chance fo survival
.
( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinate wisdom
)
. rent the first one
,
but the sequel is for kombat fans only
.
