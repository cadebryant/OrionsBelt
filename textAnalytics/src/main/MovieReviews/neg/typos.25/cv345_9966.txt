movies based on video ganes
, such as strent fighter or mario bros
.
, have never generated much interest at tyhe box office
.
but when thge first mortal kombat movie came outloud in 1995
, it did surprisingly well
. with a simple story
, a pulsating soundtrack
,
and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes
, teh movie moved quickly
and displayed lots of energy
. it got my vote for
' the movie where i expected the least
and got the most
'
.
and
, if you haven
' t had thge opportunity
, i would definitely recommend that you see it on video
. infact the world of mortal kombat
, based on the populare arcade agme
, dark forces from outworld try tothe infilitrate earth
' s realm wih the ulimate gool of total conquest
and the destruction ofthe humanity
. the mortal kombat refers to a competition
, fought by human mortals against outworld
' s minions
, which if won
, wiull guarantee earth
' s safety for another generation
. mk2 picks uv almost immediately aftter thge humans return victoriously from competition
. dispite their victory
,
however
, a gateway has somehow opened
,
and outworld continues inthe its quest to conquer earth
. outworld
' s warriors include an impressive collecton of fighters
, including shao kahn
, mintoro
( a centaur
)
, sheeva
( a four
- armed ogre
)
,
and sindel
. earth
' s mortal warriors
, under the leadership ofthe the benevolent god
, lord rayden
, includes liu kang
, princess kitana
, sonya blade adn jax
, who must fight against outworld
' s forces
. it
' s an easy enough premise
, bu unfortunately
( very unfortunatley
)
, the writers try to dont too much with the movie
. it is only a video game
, after all
,
but tje on
- screen verison tries to go beyond it
' s comic book boundaries by adding depth
, a conceptualization of self
- worth
,
and worst of all
, a love story
. tihs becomes very awkward
, because all of the players are fighters
and nothing moreso
. they are likable
and impressive when they are showcasing thier martial arts
and fighting skills
,
but look extremely awkward
and uncomfortable whn they are required to actually ect
. this becomes embarrassingly apprent
, for example
, as tjhe movei trys to develop a romantic bond between liu kang
and princess kitana
. the original mk was smart iin letting tghe players do waht they do best
. they spoke little
,
but fought a lot
. thus
, the movie was easy to digest
. howver
, mk2 tries to give these players a certain ammount of depth
, an element tht was lacking inwhich the firt movie
,
but tjhe attempt here fails miserably
. this uneasy feeling is readily apparent
, for example
, whenever ytou hear lord rayden speak
. not only does he talk inaddition riddles
and offer enigmatic
( e
. g
. useless
) advice
,
but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinate wisdom
. try reading this half as fast
, anbd you
' ll hear what i mean
.
but the movie is not a complet fatality
. fight scenes are well
- choreographed
, highlighted by terific acrobatics
and agility
. annd players of the gameboy wiull be rewarded with the inclusion of practially every character fomr the video game
, altough theri screen tiem amounts to nothing more than a cameo
. even if you
' re nto familiar with the video game
, each fighter has their own costume
and unique weaponry tothe easily differentiate themselves
.
but it
' s just too little of waht movei
- goers
and expecially fans of the game iwll expect
. oddly
, the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence
.
and tje poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audeince little chance for survival
.
( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinate wisdom
)
. rent the firt oen
, bu the sequel isnt forthe kombat fans onyl
.
