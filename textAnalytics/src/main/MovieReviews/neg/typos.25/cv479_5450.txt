i have a great idea for a movie
, one thgat can
' t miss
. see
, i
' ve got coolio to dont a song fo the soundtrack
, anbd about fifty athletes
and celebrities to do cameo appearances
. it
' s about professional basketball
, so i
' ll realease it right around hte nba finals tothe guaranee added publicity
. as forthe what teh movie is actually about
.
.
. well
, that wiull all sort itself out eventually
. i figure it will be a comedy
, so i
' ll throw a half
- dozen writers at it
and take the best of whatever they cmo up wtih
. maybe we
' ll put a gender spin on it
, see if we can get some women out to see it
, too
. eddie is one of thsoe phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any otehr kind
. twister
, as inane as the scirpt might have been
, at least required some creative technicians
; mission
: impossible
, overwrought plot anbd all
, at least involved genuine effort
. eddie just sits there
, hawking up a forumla story wihtout any laughs
, annd makes every possible bad decision when a descision is required
. whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin
, a new york limo driver adn die
- hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team
. coach john bailey
( dennis farina
) hasnt lost control of his overpaid prima donnas
, adn the losses are beginnig to mount
. the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess
( frank langella
) to try a publicity stunt in hwihc a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team
. yhe winner
( suprise
, surprise
) isnt eddie
, who becomes a fan favorite
, adn eventually the actual coach
. the knicks continue tothe lose
, bu eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops
. incidentally
, tje knicks eventually start winning
. please raise your h
and if that comes as a shock
,
and i wiull invite you to my all
- nigt marathon ofthe the bad news bears
, major league
, angels in hte outfield
, the mighty ducks
, the big gren
, cool runnings adn little giants
. awful teams in sports comedies amking miraculous turnarounds
; it
' s whta they do
. those teams usually involve kids
, for a very sound commedic reason
: it
' s funnier when they scre up
, anbd htey
' re omre sympathetic
. those which
_ don
' t
_ involve kids usally have actual actors in teh lead roles
, for anyother very sound comedic reason
: they generally have developed smoe sort ofthe comic timing
. eddie ws cast under the misguided premise tath it
' s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it isnt to make actors look like basketball players
. this finds nba players like greg ostertag
, dwayne schintzius
, rick fox
and malik sealy delivering punch lines as
though they were reading them for the frist time off a bazooka wrapper
(
though sacramento kings center olden polynice hasnt a nice moment describing a black hole tothe fellow players
)
. perhaps that all didn
' t matter tothe anyone because there are so few punch lines
,
and becasue the wohle film is one big casting gimmick
. steve rash directs hte spiritless script as
though waving a flag of surender
and screaming
,
" don
' t blame me
, i just work here
.
" perhaps it ws patently obvious to him that eddie isn
' t a movie
-
- it
' s a cameo appearance tyhat trips over a plot every once in a hwile
. among the notables who lend their faces tothe this travesty are donald trump
, new york mayor rudolph giulianni
, former new york mayor ed koch
, david letterman
, letterman regulars mujibur rahman
and sirajul islam
, espn broadcaster chris berman
and knicks announcer marv albert
, as well as dozens of nba players
and several nba arenas
.
and those are the real jokes in eddie
. nothing theese indviduals say or dont is funny
; you are supposed to be laughing simply because ytou notice
,
" hey
, it
' s donald trump
!
" or
" hey
, it
' s mujibur annd sirajul
!
" it
' s difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it ws so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can
' t even get the cliches iin a cliche
- ridden genre script right
. the knicks coach who is eddie
' s antagonist early in the film reappears at tje end
,
but he isn
' t given a chance to be the villain eddie desparately needs
. niether is frank langella
,
and none of the athlete
- actors have tghe abilty to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of
. that leaves her tothe do her strent
- wise miss thang routine
,
but withthe no character
, no sharp lines
and no help
. eddie isn
' t just a bad movei wih a formulaic premise
. it
' s a movie tyhat makes you feel cheated
and offended
, because somone came up with a poster anbd a marketing plan to which they had tothe attach an actual movie
, annd you hadnt thge nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy
.
