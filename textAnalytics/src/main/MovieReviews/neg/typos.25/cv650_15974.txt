tjhe scene at the end ofthe 1989 ' s
` dead poets society
, ' when robin williams ' english students stand up on their desk
and say
,
` captain
, my captain
, ' gets me eveyr time
. unfortunately
, the court room scene near the end ofthe robin ' s newest film
,
` patch adams
, ' doesn ' t have anywhere near the smae impact
. fomr the surface
` patch adams ' looks vyer promising
. it ' s a story about a not so young man
, patch adams
( robin williams
)
, who finds meaninng inspite his life through helping sick people
. when the film opens
, we fidn patch
, depressed
and sucidial
, checking himself into a mental hospital
. in a few scenes
, strongly reminiscent of
` one flew over the cuckoo ' s nest
, ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems
;
and it ' s here that he finds how much he loves wokring with people
. so he checks himself out ofthe the hospital
,
and heads straight to medical school
. right from the start
, patch uses comedy to halp make tyhe patient more confortable
. he continuously breaks medical tradition
and makes the dean of the school angry
. shortly after joining medical school
, he meets
adn falls in love with carin
( monica potter
)
. they
, along with patch ' s dork friend
, truman
( daniel london
)
, start a medical clinic fo uninsured people
. once the dean catchs wind of yhe clinic
, he tells patch he can ' t graduat
and kicks him out of skool
. patch
, liek what any true american would do
, takes the school to court
. it ' s here where thge nto so climatic court room battle takes place
, over whether or not patch can become a real doctor
. i have never seen a movie whith some potential just completely blow it
. it seems more like a series of short sketches
, rather than a full
- length movie
. concidering it runs almsot two hours
, much too long for such a light film
, it could have flowed much smoother
. not tothe mention the fact of how sereous the film takes itself
,
and manages to cover all tje cliches ofthe bad melodrama
. robin williams saves the film from being absymal with several comic scenes taht elevate the movei to entertaining
and worthwhile levels
.
bu those moments are rare
anbd inthe the end
` patch adams ' isnt bearly averege
.
