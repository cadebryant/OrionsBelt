tjhe scene at tjhe end ofthe 1989
' s
` dead poets society
,
' when robin williams
' english students st
and up on their desk
and say
,
` captain
, my captain
,
' gets me every tiem
. unfortunately
, the court room scene near the end of robin
' s newest film
,
` patch adams
,
' doesn
' t have anywhere near tje smae impact
. from tje surface
` patch adams
' looks very promising
. it
' s a story about a not so young man
, patch adams
( robin williams
)
, who finds meaninng in his life through helping sick peple
. when the film opens
, we find patch
, depressed
and suicidal
, checking himself into a mental hospital
. in a few scenes
, strongly riminicent ofthe
` oen flew over the cuckoo
' s nest
,
' he ends up helping the patients through their problems
;
and it
' s here thgat he finds how much he loves working wiht people
. so he checks himself out of tyhe hospital
,
and heads straight tothe medical skool
. right from the start
, patch uses comedy to halp make the patient more confortable
. he continuously breaks medical tradition
and makes the dean of tje school angry
. shortly after joining medical skool
, he meets
and falls in love withthe carin
( monica potter
)
. they
, along wiht patch
' s dork friend
, truman
( daniel london
)
, start a medical clinic for uninsured people
. once the dean catches wind of tyhe clinic
, he tells patch he cin
' t graduate anbd kicks him out of skool
. patch
, like waht any true american would dont
, tkaes the school to court
. it
' s here where thge not so climatic cout room battle tkaes place
, over whether or not patch can become a real doctor
. i have never seen a movei iwth some potential jsut completely blow it
. it seems moreso liuke a series ofthe short sketches
, rather than a full
- length movie
. considering it runs almost two huors
, much too long for such a light film
, it could haev flowed much smoother
. not tothe mention the fact of how sereous the film takes itself
,
and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama
. robin williams saves hte film from being abysmal witht several comic scenes thgat elevate the movie to entertaining
and worthwhile levels
. bu those moments are rare
and in yhe end
` patch adams
' is barely average
.
