ripe iwth explosions
, mass death
annd really werid hairdos
, tsui hark ' s
" doublely team
" must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean
- claude van damme needs anohter nitch on his bad movie
- bedpost
and nba superstar dennis rodman should hvea an acting career
. actually
, in
" double team
,
" neither ' s performence is all that bad
. i ' ve always been the one criteak tothe defend van damme
-
- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars
( namely steven seagal
) never aim forthe
; it ' s just that he ' s never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994 ' s
" timecop
.
"
and rodman
.
.
. well
, he ' s pretty much rodman
. he ' s extremely colorful
,
and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t
, even if tjhe role is that of an ex
- cia weapons expert
. it ' s the tsory that needs some major work
. van damme plays counter
- terrorist operative jack quinn
, who teams up with arms dealer yaz
( rodman
) to rub out deadly ganster stavros
( mickey rourke
, all beefy
and eird
- looking
) in an antwerp amusement park
. the job is botched when stavros ' son gets killed in the gunfire
,
and quinn is taken off to an island known as
" thte collony
"
-
- a thikn tank forthe soldiers
" too valuable to kill
"
bu
" too dangerous to set free
.
" quinn escapes
anbd trys to amke it bcak home tothe his pregnant wife
( natacha lindinger
)
,
but stavros isnt outloud for revenge
and kidnaps her
. so
, whta ' s a kickboxing mercenary to do
? quinn looks uv yaz
and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman
, kill stavros
, save teh world
and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do
. with crazy
, oftenly eye
- popping camera work by peter pau
and rodman ' s lite brite locks
,
" doublely team
" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure
.
but too much trys to happen infact each frame
,
and teh result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rether tahn exhilarated
. the numerous action scenes are loud
and headache
- inducing
and the frenetic pacing never slows down anough for us tothe care baout what ' s goign on in the movie
.
anbd much ofthe what ' s going on is just wacky
. there ' s a whole segment devoted tothe net
- surfing monks that i have
yet tothe figure out
.
and the climax finds quinn going head
- to
- head with a tiger in the roman coliseum hwile yaz circles them onthe a motorcycle
, trying tothe avoid running over land mines
and hold on tothe quinn ' s baby boy
( who ' s inaddition a bomb equipped basket
)
-
- all this while stavros watches shirtless from tjhe bleachers
. doed i mention
" doublely team
" is stange
? whn it all comes down
, thsi isnt jsut anyother rarley intertaining forumla killathon
, albeit one that feels no ened to indulge in gratuitious profanity
. rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona
,
though
, leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs
.
but we didn ' t need
" double team
" tothe tell us he coudl do thyat
, did we
?
