' s
" double team
" must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch thgat decided jean
- claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie
- bedpost annd nba superstar dennis rodman should haev an acting career
. actually
, infact
" duble team
,
" neither
' s performence is all that bad
. i
' ve always beeen the noe criteak to defend van damme
-
- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars
( namely steven seagal
) never aim fo
; it
' s just that he
' s never made a movie so exuberantly witty sicne 1994
' s
" timecop

"
and rodman
.
.
. well
, he
' s pretty much rodman
. he
' s extremely colorful
,
and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t
, even if tje role is that of an ex
- cia weapons expert
. it
' s the story that needs soem major work
. van damme plays counter
- terrorist operative jack quinn
, who teams uv with arms dealer yaz
( rodman
) to rub outloud deadly gangster stavros
( mickey rourke
, all beefy
and weird
- looking
) infact an antwerp amusement park
. the job is botched when stavros
' son gets killed inthe thte gunfire
, annd quinn is taken off to an isl
and known as
" the collony
"
-
- a think tank for soldiers
" too valuable to kill
" bu
" too dangerous to set free

" quinn escapes
and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife
( natacha lindinger
)
, bu stavros is out forthe revenge
and kidnaps her
. so
, waht
' s a kickboxing mercernary to do
? quinn looks up yaz
and the two travel tothe rome so tehy can rescue the woman
, kill stavros
, save the world
and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do
. wiht crazy
, often eye
- popping camera owrk by peter pau
and rodman
' s lite brite locks
,
" double team
" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure
.
but too much tries to happen inaddition earch frame
,
and yhe result is a movie that leaves yuo exhausted rather tahn exhilarated
. teh numerous acation scenes are loud
and headache
- inducing
and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what
' s gogin onthe in yhe movie
. adn much ofthe wqat
' s going on is just wacky
. htere
' s a whole segment devoted tothe net
- surfing monks that i have
yet to figure outloud
.
and the climax finds quinn oging head
- to
- head with a tiger iin the roman coliseum hwile yaz circles them on a motorcycle
, trying to avoid running over l
and mines
and hold on tothe quinn
' s baby boy
( who
' s inthe a bomb equipped basket
)
-
- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers
. did i mention
" double team
" isnt stange
? when it all comes down
, this is jstu another rarely entertaining forumla killathon
, albeit one that fiels no need to indulgue inwhich gratuitous profanity
. rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona
,
though
, leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between teh legs
. bu we didn
' t ened
" doulbe team
" to tell us he could do that
, doed we
?
