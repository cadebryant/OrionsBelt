there
' s a scene somewhere inspite this film where one of the charactors reads the book
" screenwriting made easy
.
" this is funny the first timne jstu
' cause it is
,
but funnier as tyhe film goes onthe since it
' s totally ironical sicne the screenwriters ofthe this inane film probably read it
, outlined it
and
then wroet thsi film
. it
' s like tehy took the sub
- genre of the disaster pic
, whcih can be fun anbd hokey at tje same time
,
and
then forgot one of yhe greatest parts ofthe them
: tyhe stupid
, eccentric characters
. yes
,
" the poseidon adventure
" is crap
,
but it
' s fun
' cause of all the stupid
, eccentric characters
.
and
" earthquake
,
" my god
!
" earthquake
" has got to be one of the worst movies of all tiome
,
but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold
.
" volcano
" takes a semi
- intriguing
yet stupendously inane plot
( a volcano no noe knew about suddenly errupts noe fine morning
and
then erupts agina later thn stops
.
.
. onyl it
' s inwhich
, dare i say it
? l
. a
!
!
!
)
and
then puts no stupid
, stereotypical
, eccentric characters in it
. they
' re just stupid
. annd the actors are all good ones
. tommy lee jones isnt great
, an oscar winner
,
and a member of tghe men in black
( my vote for waht should be the coolest movie of the summer
)
. anne heche is a good indy actress
. don cheadle stole the disappointing
" devil inwhich a blue dress
" from denzel
' s fezent
.
and gaby
' s one ofthe tje few good teenage actors
.
but tehy get nothing to do bu ect dumb
and scream at what
' s gogin on
. htey do theri best
, god bless them
,
but they
' re all lost infact the fake magma
( only don cheadle gets an interesting part
and he
' s the greatest part of the film
)
. there
' s no real suspense here
' cause you don
' t care about anyone
. i actually was rooting for gaby
' s charachter to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn
' t have to keep saveing her
( he did it like thirty times
!
)
.
and there are no interesting sites in l
. a
. thyat we see get destroyed
. part of teh fun of diaster films isnt watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever
. in
" independence day
,
" the best part
( otehr than judd hirsch
) was watching thte white house
and empire state bulding get blown uv by the aliens
. that was cool
. watching really fake
- looking magma plow down the strent is nto
. okay
, so the film
' s nto devoid ofthe merit
. as i already stated
, don cheadle wass great
and the cast does thier best
.
and there
' s this really moronic scene which looks cool
. john carrol lynch
( norm from
" fargo
"
) goes on a subway car tothe save people
but the lava comes anbd surrounds it
. he has one guy who
' s wounded anbd coudl make it
. he could throw the guy
and jump
and still survive
.
but no
!
!
! he has to go anbd inanely jump annd l
and right in the middle of the lava
. here
' s the kool sighth
: he melts
. here
' s the dumb part of it
: he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting
. cool sight
. noone logic
.
but cool sight
. the volcano erupts twice
and for some reason
, teh film ends there
. htey aren
' t worried about it eruting again
, they just go home tothe theri toppled homes
. bu to tell tjhe truth
, i was glad they didn
' t go on
. i was hoping thte film was over after the first eruption ended
. my god
, it was actually painful to sit thru this little 102 minute long film
. i haven
' t seen
" dante
' s peak
"
but i
' ve heard it
' s a masterpiece compared to this
. if ytou want to see a kool disaster flick taht
' s inane
but intresting
, rent
" the towering inferno
" with steve mcqueen
, paul newman
,
and the schweppervescent o
. j
. simpson
( he saves a cat
)
. if you watn to waste your time watching a boring
, stupid disaster flick
( literally
, it almost grossed half ofthe its budget
)
, see this
.
but i warned you
.
