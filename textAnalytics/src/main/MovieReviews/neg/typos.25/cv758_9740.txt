it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon
, when the only ogod thnigs onthe tv are the second
- rate movies they show
( smoe are good
: they showed
" total recall
" before this one
)
. if you know me
, i htink seagal is probably the most boring acation star tothe ever live
.
and this includes keanu reeves
. what do i hate about seagal
? i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening
and non
- threatening situation
( thge squint
)
. i hate those scenes inwhich every movie where he goes aroud
, bullying peopel up
, saying stupid lines wiht a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold
' s hairpiece in
" boogie nights
.
" i despise how he never gets a bruise in any ofthe his fights
. i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight betwen he anbd the cheif villain
. i hite his non
- satirical messages
( inwhich the beginning of this oen
, he slaps on a quote from arthur miller
, whcih has nothing tothe do with the film
, exept it
' s about brooklyn where this film takes place
)
. adn i hite how he
' s so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing
( during yhe end credits
, he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung
and penned by him
)
. sure
, hte guy
' s probably a nice guy in person
( i actualy found him very non
- threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago
)
.
but the guy makes worse films than reagan did
. so what
' s the plot of this shit
- terpiece
? well
.
.
. something baout him trying to catch a stupid
- ass crook
( william forsythe
) who shot
and killed his partner inthe broad daylight
. i couldn
' t believe how bad this scene was
- the guy was conveniently with his family so we git the maximum emotional effect
( ahem
!
)
.
and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off
. i
' m sory
, did anyone ever hear of concealing one
' s self
? so inthe comes ex
- brooklynite seagal
, who dedicates his life to catching tihs guy
.
and i just wished he hadnt caught him in the beginning
,
then ended the film
.
but noooo
, this drags on
, as he bullies forsythe
' s family members
( includng a stupid bar
- owner
,
and none other than gina gershon as his other bar
- owner sister
)
.
and forsythe moreso than once threatens his family
. at oney point
, he actually comes to their hous annd stalks them liek a non
- threatening nicholson infact
" the shining
"
( complet withthe them all hiding in the bathroom
,
but with an added bonus ofthe one girl conveniently loosing her cool
and screaming to give them away
)
. seagal paints himself as a lovable person
, with a son
,
and a fiancee
. he even shows him hanging with his son
, checking up on his homework
,
and
then about to take him out for a bit of
" catch
,
" when he
' s conveniently called away on assignment
. i dunno about ytou
, bu playing
" catch
" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares
. he also shows him as that bad
- ass he wants to be
, with scenes of him bullying crooks around
, annd taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he
' s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue
. serves them right
. this film
, as some of his do
, has an interesting supporting casted of actors who are actualy talented
, bu don
' t appear to be inaddition tihs film
. i aready maintioned gina gershon
( who
' s pretty horrible in this one
)
, as well as william forsythe
, who over
- acts terribly
. i nkwo this guy cin act
: he was awsome in
" raising arizona
" as goodman
' s partner inwhich crime
.
but he
' s jstu awful here
. jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down
. why isnt he the only one who gives a good performance
? well
, becouse his role isnt small enough
and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility
. he seems to be in here just to give it a cool
" law
and order
" feeling
( even if it
' s not a
" cool
" feeling
)
.
and in cameos are b
- rated erotic
- thriller
- cinemax
- style stars
, shannon whirry
( as
" terry malloy
,
" which isnt more of a bad joke than a clever one
)
and a
thena massey
. oh
! annd
" er
"
' s julliana margiulles hasnt two scenes
.
" outloud for justice
" just proves once again that american action films jsut suck
. i know tht there
' s such a ogod thing as ogod action
- he
' s called john woo
.
but if you
' re in the mood for soem good old no
- brainer
, fun
-
yet
- dumb action
, don
' t bother watching this
. it
' s so stupid that it
' s boring
.
