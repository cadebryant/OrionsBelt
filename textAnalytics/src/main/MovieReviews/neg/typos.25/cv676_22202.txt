bad
. bad
. bad
. tyhat noe word seems tothe pretty much sums up beyond the vallay ofthe the dolls
. if that sumary isn
' t anough for ytou
, how about t
& a
, t
& a
, t
& a
? still haven
' t got tghe point
? other than director russ meyer
' s predilection for casting attractive larg breasted women who ultimately expose the afore
- mentioned anatomical areas
, there is really only one other reason tothe recommend even taking a look at this movie
. that is the fact that it ws co
- written by famed film critic roger ebert
, who also ws resposible for the screenplay
. after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through anyother one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing iwth a straight face
. this movei stinks out loud
. quite frankly
, this movie deserves a
.
but ther are parts of it tath are so bad they are almost funny
. so i
' m giving it a
.
and maybe that is too generous
. right from the opening credits
, i knew that i had a class
- a bomb on my h
ands
. not onyl are thge way the credits actually shot distracting
,
but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform
. i had absolutely no idea why the hell thgat was happening
( it does get explained later
)
and as soon as the first scene is over
, we cut tothe a completly unrelated scene
. to be honest
, as i sat through thsi movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it wass
, i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later infact the film
. witht the quality of the writing during hte rest of tjhe film
, it wouldn
' t haev surprized me if the opening had never beeen explained
. so what is thsi movei baout
? you ask
. like it really matters
. ok
, here goes
. this all
- girl b
and headed by kelly macnamara
( dolly reed
)
and her friends go to hollywood tothe try to gain a foothold in the music industry
. once htere
, they do manage to find success
( due as much to their hooters as anytying else
? it sure wasn
' t for their brutally bad singing voices
)
, adn thte movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as tyhe pressures ofthe fame git to them
. everything from big egos
, tothe booze
and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral
. there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for ogod measure
,
but the fame isnt the oney that pretty much sums up this thing
.
> from a creative st
andpoint there is nothing redeeming here
. other than hte above
- mentioned obession withthe big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have
. the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it litterally is funny inaddition parts
. mr
. ebert has generously thrown in helpings of
" hey man
"
,
" dig
"
and my all timne favorite
-
-
" thsi isnt my happening
,
and it freaks me out
"
. now i ask you
, with lines liek that how can you go wrong
? ebert hadnt tried to inject as many big words as possable inot the dialogue
. mabey he
thought it woudl mkea the movie seem smarter
. i don
' t know
,
but all yhe big words in the world wouldn
' t be able to disguise the bad writting adn even worse acting
.
but the wretched dialogue goes along well with tjhe wretched qualtiy ofthe everything eles infront htis movie
. i
' ve seen home movies directed better tahn meyer managed with this turkey
. in fatc
, ther is one scene
-
- thte oen in which htey are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes
-
- during which i realyl hadnt to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered sereous head injurys
. add to the directing
and writing thte music in this movei
. i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken
, ther was such a pile ofthe crap emanating from tyhe speakers
.
then we have the casted
. frist lets start david gurian who played harris
, the manager of the b
and
. this hasnt got to be the goofiest looking guy thast has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera
. sadly
, his acting doesn
' t cmo close to making up forthe his looks
. if you haev been follwoing along up to tihs point
, this shouldn
' t suprize you
. meyer
' s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of bieng fairly attractive to go along whith their other assets
. dolly reed plays kelly
, thge leader of the b
and
.
and no surprise here
, she was cast for her cup size
, not her talents
. annd yes
, she does loose the shirt a few times
and display her impressive talents
. sadly
, her ass is almost as large as her chest
. hey
, it a sexist movei
, so i
' m writing a sexist review
.
then we ahve former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey
, one of tjhe other b
and munbers
. this goes along with the rest ofthe the idiotic thinking in the movie
. meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for annd who obviously hasnt no acting talent at all
,
but her nude scenes are the biggest dissappointment of all
. sure russ
, now isnt yhe time to get artsy adn throw infact some well placed shadows
. on thge up side
, she does have a fun lesbo scene
. i sound like i
' m writting a review in a porn magazine
.
but hey
, i
' ll admit it
; teh only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was tothe catch a look at cynthia myers naked
. annd since that was a huge disappointment
, i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turky
. the onyl thing that i can say about this movei is that ytou shoudl stay away from it
. unless of course yuo want tothe feel good baout yourself by knowing thta even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too
. annd if ytou are thinking ofthe checking it out for the double d
' s
-
- you are better off jstu downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet
. this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs
. an even better diea might be to recquire video tsores to place a warning on thge box of beyond the valey of yhe dolls
-
- beware
: htis movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense
. procede with extreme caution
