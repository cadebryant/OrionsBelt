i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films
. when done right
, with at least slightly evident resturaunt
, tehy can be engaging
, sweeping
, appealing
.
but it
' s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle
, a hollow
, boring romance tht should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers
; the ones willing tothe buy inot ephron
' s whiny views of life
and romance
. tom hanks annd meg ryan
, two ofthe hollywood
' s most likeable stars play sam baldwin
and annie reed
, repectively
. baldwin
' s wife recently died anbd he moved to seattle withthe his son
, jonah
, seeking tothe get awya from the familiar surroundings which remind him ofthe his late spouse
. jonah senses tension
and calls a talk radio sohw to tell teh world about their problems
. sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show
, bu when he gets on the phone he beigns pouring his heart out
. ephron has him dont thsi so tyhat annie reed
( meg ryan
) cxan hear it
. annie is a happy woman
. she is engaged to walter
, an allergy
- prone working man
and seems tothe be perfectly content
.
but after hearing sam tjhe widower onthe thte radio show
, she becomes conviced that he is her destiny
and is willing to risk her engagement for it
. five years aftter this movei hit theaters
, hanks
, ryan
and ephron would team up agian inwhich the far better
,
al
thought still sub
- par rumatic comedy you
' ve got mail
, which is baout people who hite each other in rela life falling in lveo on the internet
. at least that movie hadnt a sence of spontaneity
. here it seems tht the firt one hundred mintues exist souly to set uv forthe the last five
. the fact thgat sam
and annie wiull finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything alse is perfunctory
. sleepless in seattle is full of wonderfull performers
; from its two leads tothe supporting stars like bill pullman
and rosie o
' donnell
.
but none of them can save the film ffrom being a bore
. its charactors are dull
and empty
, its script isn
' t funny or particularly charming
. the script has a fundamental problem
: annie gives up
, for little reason
, her life with walter tothe persue
" sleepless in seattle
,
" whom she hasnt never even seen
. it
' s the kind of life descision that real people don
' t amke
,
and its a major
, unforgiveable plausibility sacrifice
. in essence
, this movie
' s purpose is to head towards a gool that shouldn
' t even exist
. it
' s a ten minute short film with ninety
- five minutes of filler
. if you weere to show me sleepless in seattle
and i didn
' t have tothe review it
, you sould jsut call me
" asleep inaddition philadelphia
.
