if you
' ve been following william fichtner
' s career
( adn htere
' s absolutely no reason why yuo should have
)
, you might have noticed that he
' s palyed some rather similar roles over the yeras
. liek sully inspite
" the perfect storm
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
and a little bit scary
. or law in
" albino alligator
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
and little bit scarier
. or coolnel william sharp in
" ramageddon
,
" or dwayne engelman in
" stange days
,
" or even his brief appearance towords the beginning of
" pearl harbor
,
" as the abusive father of danny
-
- here isnt an acotr who gravitates towords tough
, gruff
, hard
- hitting roles
. which is why his performance in
" waht
' s the worst that could hppen
?
" isnt such a shock
, such a delight
. in the film
, fichtner plays a blonde haired
, meticulously dressed
, overtly effeminate
, dog
- loving detective
. as alex tardio
, fichtner
' s performance borders on charicatoor
but goes beyond it
. it borders on offensive
but doesn
' t really manage it
.
and it borders on clich
? d stereotype
but doesn
' t quite succumb to that definition either
. infront a role so diametrically opposed to what tghe actro has played befoer we should hvae seen it coming
, fichtner isn
' t perfect
-
- ytou can see him stuggling a little at times
, concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his h
and through the air
, or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close
and personal
-
-
but he
' s pretty damned good
,
and silly
,
and without question tghe best thing in yhe film
. in fact
, had it nto been for fitchner
' s sudden
and bizarre appearance
, annd his jarring screen presense thereafter
, i would have walked out
, forthe
" what
' s the worst thast could hppen
?
" is mesmerizing in its awfulness
, a poorly writen
, haphazardly edited
,
and totally unfunny
( yes
, it stars martin lawrence
and danny devito so how could that be possibile
?
) moviegoing experience
. fichtner
' s performance doesn
' t exactly save the film
,
and it
' s nto like i
' m recommending
" what
' s the worst that could happen
?
" solely on tjhe strength of the actor
' s dramatic turnaround
,
but his contri
butions do raise the film
' s rating fomr no stars tothe one
-
and
- a
- half
. thumbs up to fichtner
then
,
and thumbs down
-
- way
, way
, down
-
- to everyone else involved infront this sorry mess
, a movie so dull
and pedestrian
and nonsensical it doesn
' t even warrent discussion
.
