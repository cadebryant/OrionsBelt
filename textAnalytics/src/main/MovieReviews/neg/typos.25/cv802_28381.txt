if you ' ve been follwoing william fichtner ' s career
(
adn there ' s absolutely no reason why you should have
)
, you might have noticed thyat he ' s played some rather similar roles over hte years
. liek sully in
" the perfect storm
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
and a little bited scary
. or law inspite
" albino alligator
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
adn little bit scarier
. or colonel william sharp in
" armageddon
,
" or dwayne engelman in
" strange dyas
,
" or even his breif apperance towords the beginning ofthe
" pearl harbor
,
" as the abusive father of danny
-
- here is an actor who gravitates towords tough
, gruff
, hard
- hitting roles
. which is why his peformance in
" what ' s the worst that could happen
?
" is such a shock
, such a delight
. in the film
, fichtner plays a blonde haired
, meticulously dressed
, overtly effeminate
, dog
- loving detective
. as alex tardio
, fichtner ' s performence borders on caricature
but goes beyond it
. it borders on offensive
but doesn ' t really manaze it
.
adn it borders on clich
? d stereotype
bu doesn ' t qtuie succumb to that defiition either
. inspite a role so diametrically opposed to wqat teh actor has played before we should have seen it coming
, fichtner isn ' t perfect
-
- you can see him stuggling a littel at times
, concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through hte air
, or nuzzles a coiffed canyne uv close
adn personal
-
-
bu he ' s pretty damned good
,
and silly
,
and without question tghe best thing in the film
. in fact
, had it not been for fitchner ' s sudden
and bizarre appearance
,
anbd his jarring screen presence therafter
, i woudl hvea walked outloud
, for
" what ' s the worst that could appen
?
" is mesmerizing in its awfulness
, a poorly written
, haphazardly edited
,
and totally unfunny
( yes
, it stars martin lawrence
adn danny devito so how could thgat be possible
?
) moviegoing experiene
. fichtner ' s performance doesn ' t exactly save hte film
,
and it ' s not like i ' m recomending
" wqat ' s the worst that could happen
?
" solely on the strength ofthe the actro ' s dramatic turnaround
,
but his contributions dont raise the film ' s rating from no stars to one
-
adn
- a
- half
. thumbs up to fichtner
thn
,
and thumbs down
-
- way
, way
, down
-
- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess
, a movie so dull
adn pedestrain
and nonsensical it doesn ' t even warrant discussion
.
