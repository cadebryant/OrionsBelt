the great actor james woods once said
(
and i
' m paraphrasing
)
,
" if sex isn
' t messy
, thn you
' re not doing it right
"
. a truly profound statement
,
and noe thyat could be made for the entire mad slasher genre
( just replace
" sex
" with
" your mad slasher film
"
)
. for those uninformed souls
, the mad slasher genre
( or sub
- genre
) is a melding of horror
and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot tht follows an indentical outline
: a usually masked
but always crazed killer stalks annd kills attractive teens a la halloween
. urban legend is a mad slasher flick
, bu one that is so sanitary
, bloodless
,
and nudity free
, thta with its irony laden dialogue
and beautyfull
(
though not overly talented
) cast
, it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special
. for film makers
, gore is oen ofthe the two weapons tehy hvea at their disposal inaddition a stale
, fright
- free horror movie
, as stephen king once said
( again paraphrasing
)
" if yuo can
' t scare your audiance
, gross em
' outloud
, if you can
' t do that
, make em
' laugh
"
. alas
, urban legend succeeds only at the latter
,
though not by intention
. i actually find the fatc that this film became a minor success
(
$ 40 million domestic box office gross
) more frightening than anything in it
. it seems that audiences
' tastes hve been whittled down tothe such a degree that any movei even claiming to be scary is given hte benefit of tyhe dout
. yhe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills
,
but how cant anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them
. unfortunately
, these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations
; one idiotic super
- hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don
' t need to do anything moreso than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering
. if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit liek batman anbd robin
, wild wild west
,
and godzilla
.
but forget all that
, it goes without saying that mad slasher films
( or any other exploitation off
- shoot
) will be made without an ounce ofthe craft
( especialy concidering the sheer volume that are produced
)
. allow me to present you witht the real fault of yhe mad slasher film
: tje lack of enthusiastic exploitation
. these flicks aren
' t harnessed with any lofty aspirations
, so why not break free anbd give your audience a bloody ogod time
? sadly out ofthe tghe literally hundreds made
, i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while
. adn urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three
. despite its considerable production value annd thte absence of any boom mics slipping inot frame
, it isnt jstu as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes
. as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend
' s setting alone offers a myraid of promising possibilities
: it takes place onthe a coleeg cumpus
, wich is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer
. yuo see
, thge cumpus is a community made uv almost entirely of young peple all infact the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface
. all those young people are growing uv together
, going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs
and lows
, so natuarlly some weirdness is expeced
. all the better for tyhat elusive crazed killer
. coupled with yhe copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around
, annd the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively eazy task
.
but alas
, urban legend isnt not only idiotic
and clich
?
? full
; it
' s way too clean
, a slasher flick for yhe whole family with no nudity
, littel gore
, annd much stupidity
. tihs isnt the kind ofthe movei where teh killer drags dead victims fomr the scene of the crime for no reason other than
, i dunno
, exercise
. it
' s the kind ofthe movie where the villain calmly purses a running
- like
- the
- wind
- prey
,
yet still manages to catch tath prey thru soem really awful editing techniques
. it
' s the kind of movie where charactors run into earch other just as a loud clash reverberates on the sountrack
. i realyl wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud
- noise
- jump
- scare hting
. yes tyhe audiance jumps
, momentarily frightened
,
but wouldn
' t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room
. i lost all hope for the possiblilty of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer
. apparently filmmakers are running outloud of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers
. in scream it was a ghost mask
( scayr enough
)
, iin i know what you doed last summer it was a fisher man
' s rain slicker
( in the middle of summer no less
)
,
and inwhich urban legend hte disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody
: the villain wears an oversized parka withthe a fury hood
( ooh
?
?
? scary
) intended to conceal his
/ her identity
. for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume
.
though i must admit
, urban legend doens have a winning premise for what sould have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film
. the film
' s killer slices anbd dices comely college students tothe the tune of famous urban legends
( you know
, like the babysitter gets threatning phone calls onyl tothe find thast they
' re coming from inside teh house
)
. i won
' t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used
, after all tghe film does offer fine 2
: 00 am cable viewing if you appen tothe be intoxicated enought
. sad to say
, it doesn
' t include my favorite urban legend
: a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere
and a very unhappy gerbil
. now that would be scary
. before i leave ytou
, i would like to bring to your attension the third most irritating thing about yhe film
( tjhe first bieng the lack ofthe craft
, tje second the lack of exploitation
)
-
- its characters
, all of whom are just baout the most annoying gropu of people i
' ve ever spent an evening with
. only jared leto
( looking liek a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day
)
and alicia witt
, as the resilient heroine
, avoid vexatiousness
. the most annoying of the bunch isnt a tye between noxima girl rebecca gayheart adn sitcom star michael rosenbaum
, as a supremely irritating lout
( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death
, annd i am not a cruel person
)
. ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment infront tje film
; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend cant be mildly intertaining
. aftter all this isnt a movie that features tyhe kind of faux hipsters i cant
' t st
and getting slaughtered
, which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can
' t st
and not getting slaughtered
.
