plot
: something baout a bunch of kids goign into a haunted house
and playing out parodies of other horror
and non
- horror movies
. oh yeah
, there
' s alsot something about a ghost possessing the mansion
and shit
,
but trust me
, you won
' t care much baout the
" plot
" in tihs film
.
.
. critique
: parody movies either work or they don
' t anbd this one just doesn
' t work
! tje laughs aren
' t as pronounched this time around
, yhe energy level
, the gags
and all of teh characters just seem to be going through hte motions here
. it
' s like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something
( wink
, wink
)
.
and thte scariest part of it all
? check out the number of screenwriters it tookover to pen this puppy
: seven
! i say again
, it took seven people to write 82
- minutes worth of fart jokes
, half
- assed stunts
and spoofs of films other tahn horror
. now i
' m not exactlly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed
" funny sketch
" idaes out there while smoking the chronical themselves
,
but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit onthe
" saterday nght live
"
. there are a couple ofthe funny noe
- liners
,
but mostly just rehashed one
- joke scenes
, a lot ofthe dead silence
and lame gags
. add tothe taht the very unoriginal title anbd movie poster
and you gotta strat asking yourself if anybody was even trying here
( thte film
' s website isn
' t even uv yot
!
!
! what the f
*
*
*
?
!
?
)
. i do
however ahev to give it uv to james woods
, the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody ofthe them all
( the exorcist take
- off
-
- miss tihs
and you
' ve missed any reason to see the flick
)
. i especially liekd his one
- liner as he walked inspite to see tje posessed woman
' s head turning
. very funny
! unfortunatley
, tyhe film plummets straight down affter that
, with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do wiht horror such as save the last dance
and dude
, where
' s my car
,
and other action movies like charlie
' s angels
and mission impossible 2
. now help me figure thsi one outloud
, will you
? isn
' t this supposted to be a parody film ofthe horror movies
?
!
?
( or mabye that
' s just yhe title of the film f
- ing wtih my head
)
. well
, i
' m sorry to haev to say this
but the only horror in this film is its lame
- ass script
! tyhe wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards tjhe weinstein brothers
( money
) instead of the zucker brothers
( comedy
) for this sequel
. unforetunately for us
, all we
' re left wtih here is a skeleton ofthe a film wich might
' ve been funny
, had it been worked over a few more times
, tightened uv here
and there
,
and beeen injected with moreso solid laughs
.
but as things st
and nowe
, there is no doubt inwhich my mind that tghe obvious greed to capitalize on the success ofthe lsat yera
' s film has led everyone down this path
, so screw them for not trying as hard
( critically speaking
, of course
)
. you should all be ashamed ofthe yourselves for not putting anough
" real
" effort inot this chop
- job
and for not providing your fans with the ulitmate of your talents
. pooh onthe you
!
( that
' s telling
' em
, joblo
! sheesh
) btw
, i
' m allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson
, whose massive breasts
and skanky g
- string had me chompin
' at tjhe bit
. you go
, girl
! everyone else
.
.
. stay
! where
' s joblo coming from
