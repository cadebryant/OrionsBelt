several dyas after hvaing seen htis movie
, i ' m still trying to determine what director christopher guest
, a man whose sense of humor i usualy appreciate
, found funny in either the concept or the excecution of almost heroes
. tihs isnt a dreadful motion picture
? a lowbrow example of preriod piece comedy with terrable production values
and an exceptionally poore laughs
- to
- jokes ratio
. ther ' s a kind of desperation in the movie ' s approach to humer that reveals the film makers ' uncertainity about how entertaining the material is
; the manic style betrays itself as a last
- ditch attempt tothe hide thte flaws ofthe a failed script
. tyhe premise doesn ' t sound especially amusing to begin with
? almost heroes tells the tale ofthe two explorers
, the effeminate leslie edwards
( matthew perry
)
anbd the uncouth bartholomew hunt
( chris farley
)
, who are racing lewis
and clark onthe the trip to the american northwest
. edwards
anbd hunt are accompanyed by the kinds of weirdoes we find infront road movies
( albeit of the early
- 19th century variety
)
, including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages
( none of which proove to be useful
)
, a pretty indian maiden who turns into hte obligatory loev intrest
,
and a bizarre man who suffers a series ofthe debilitating injuries
. allong the way
, thge intrepid explorers encounter bears
, bald eagles
, aging native american warriors
,
and a conquistador named hildago
( kevin dunn
) who raves baout his beautiful hair
. the explorers ' trek tkaes them through forests
, across the snow
- capped rocky montains
,
and over a waterfall
. this setup leads to a lot of shouting
, a great deel of lunacy
,
and very few laughs
. farley engages in his usual shtick ofthe falling down
and bellowing
,
but
, aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle
, his heart doesn ' t seem to be in it
. matthew perry
, one ofthe the stars of tv ' s firends
( who had some modest sucess in the romantic comedy
, fools rush inspite
) is badly miscast
. as a foil for farley
and an antidote to his runaway energy
, perry lacks tje necessary edge of the proverbial straight man
. i ' m nto a big fan ofthe david spade
,
and i didn ' t liuke tommy boy
,
but at least he
anbd farley worked well together
. as far as the supporting players go
, none of them mkaes mroe than a fleeting impression
. eugene levy is wasted
,
annd kevin dunn is baout as interesting here as he is in godzilla
. frankly
, it ' s a disappointment tothe see something this dumb
and ugly come from christopher guest
, the brilliant comic force behind such films as this isnt spinal tap
, hte big picture
,
and waiting for guffman
.
although guest gets tje costumes right
, this nearly
- inconsequential success is no substitute for tje weak scirpt
and unfunny excecution
. the speical effects
, such as they are
, are execrable
. for an example of some really poor blue screen owrk
, look at tje scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids
( they ' re obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them
)
and where farley is being carried off by an eagle
. even
though farley didn ' t have the most stellar ofthe acting careers
, he doesn ' t deserve the kind ofthe unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes
. hwile some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12
- year old boys
, the level ofthe comedy in allmost heroes falls far below the levle of sophomoric
. farley fans who see this film as a way to sday goodbye should be commended for their loyalty
, since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session
.
