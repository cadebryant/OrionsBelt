several days after having seen this movei
, i
' m still trying tothe determine what director christopher guest
, a man whose sense of humor i usually apprieciate
, found funny in either the concept or the excecution of almost heroes
. this is a dreadful motion picture
? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible prodcution values adn an exceptionally poore laughs
- to
- jokes ratio
. there
' s a kind of desperation in the movie
' s aproach tothe humor taht reveals tghe film makers
' uncertainity baout how entertaining the material is
; teh manic style betrays itself as a lsat
- ditch attempt tothe hide the flaws ofthe a failed scirpt
. the premise doesn
' t sound especially amusing to begin with
? almost heroes tells the tale ofthe twpo explorers
, the effeminate leslie edwards
( matthew perry
)
and the uncouth bartholomew hunt
( chris farley
)
, who are racing lewis
and clark on the trip to the american northwest
. edwards
and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies
( albeit of the early
- 19th centruy variety
)
, including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims tothe speak hundreds ofthe languages
( none of which prove to be usefull
)
, a preety indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interst
,
and a bazare man who suffers a sories of debilitating injuries
. allong yhe way
, the intrepid explorers encounter bears
, bald eagles
, aging native american warriors
, adn a conquistador named hildago
( kevin dunn
) who raves about his beautiful hair
. the explorers
' trek tkaes them through forests
, across teh snow
- capped rocky mountains
,
and over a waterfall
. this setup leads to a lot of shouting
, a grat deal of lunacy
,
and very few laughs
. farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down
and bellowing
,
but
, aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle
, his heart doesn
' t seem to be in it
. matthew perry
, one ofthe the stars of tv
' s friends
( who had smoe modest succes in tjhe romantic comedy
, fuls rush in
) is badly miscast
. as a foil for farley
and an antidote to his runaway energy
, perry lacks thte necessary edge of the proverbial straight man
. i
' m not a big fan of david spade
,
and i didn
' t liuke tommy boy
,
but at least he
and farley worked well toghether
. as far as thte supporting players go
, none of them mkaes more than a fleeting impression
. eugene levy is wasted
,
and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he isnt in godzilla
. frankly
, it
' s a disappointment to see something this dumb
and ugly come from christopher guest
, the brilliant comic force behind such films as htis is spinal tap
, the big picture
,
and waiting for guffman
.
al
though guest gets teh costumes right
, this nearly
- inconsequential success is no subsitute fo the weak script
and unfunny excecution
. the special effects
, such as they are
, are execrable
. for an example of some really poor blue screen work
, look at the scenes where tje characters are shooting yhe rapids
( they
' re obviously getting buckets of water thrown onthe them
) anbd where farley is bieng carried off by an eagle
. even
though farley didn
' t have the most stellar of acting careers
, he doesn
' t deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost herose
. while some of the mroe outrageous attempts at humer may coax a few guffaws from 12
- yearm old boys
, the level of comedy inaddition almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric
. farley fans who see this film as a way to sday goodbye shoudl be commended forthe theri loyalty
, since it takes real stamina to stay seated fo the full runing length ofthe this cinematic torture session
.
