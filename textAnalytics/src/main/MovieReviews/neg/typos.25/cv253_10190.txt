hey
, i
' ve got a great diea for a movei
! ok
, here it is
: we
' ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about twpo hours or so
! what
' s tath
? soudns too boring
? ok
, how about this
then
: we still ahve tim allen pull faces for about two hurs
,
but half ofthe them are angry looks
and half of them are
" i
' m inwhich pain
!
" looks
! waht
' s that
? that still doesn
' t sound funny to you
? how about if we through in some
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still not funny
? if you answered
" no
, that doesn
' t sound funny
"
,
then
( ding ding ding
!
) you
' re absolutely corect
! fo richer or poorer isnt a moronic farce about a rich married couple
( played by tim allen
and kirstie alley
) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best know as newman on tv
' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them in trouble for tax evasion
. whta ensues is a badly scripted
and horribly directed 114 mintues of cinema hell
. what mkaes this all wrong isnt that nobody seems to have what tghe film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing uv
, the married cuple is brad annd caroline sexton
( allen
and alley
)
, a popular snobby duo who seem totally in lveo to everyone alse
,
but infact reality are onthe the brink of divorce
. just as their marriage seems to be hanging ffrom it
' s final thread
, brad discovers that his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton
' s names
. the irs catches onthe
,
but since everything points back tothe the sexton
' s
and not lachman
, there is nothing much to do
.
.
. except run awya
and join an amish community
. first timne screenwriters jana howington
and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle
- outloud
- loud moments
,
and even some decent laughs here
and
* way
* over there
,
but ther isnt so much tothe cringe at iin this horribly made film taht yuo
' ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn
. alley is absolutely unwatchable
,
and the chemestry between her annd allen isnt about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade
( hwihc
, i inform you
, was total b
. s
.
)
. allen
and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons
, nor are they very convincing as an amish cuple
! this entire movie is noe bad ill
- conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the veyr beginnig
! the amish infact this movie are also flimsy annd unconvincing
. it
' s such a trite
, stereotypical script that i imagin the actors that were casted
( noticing that they
' re all predominantly tv figures
) were probably hte only ones they coudl get
! bryan spicer
' s directing doesn
' t help one bit
, either
. in fact
, listing spicer
' s filmography
( which includes the first
" pwoer rangers
" movie
and the big screen adaption of mchale
' s navy
) is more of an insult than a r
? sum
?
! now that i
' ve pretty much run for richer or poorer inot the ground
, i will let you in on the best thing about it
. it bumped seven films up a notch on my
" worst ofthe
" 1997 movie list
. tyhat
' s right
, thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for tghe year
' s worst
, six films are now not seemingly as bad
, adn a smile like yours
, previously inhabiting the number ten spot
, now doesn
' t have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list
. if you look at it in that respect
, for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all
