hey
, i ' ve got a great idea forthe a movie
! ok
, here it is
: we ' ll get tim allen tothe pull angry faces for about two hours or so
! what ' s that
? sounds too boring
? ok
, how about htis
then
: we still hvae tim allen pull faces for baout two hours
,
bu half ofthe them are angry looks
anbd half ofthe them are
" i ' m in pain
!
" looks
! what ' s that
? that still doesn ' t sound funny tothe you
? how about if we through in some
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still not funny
? if ytou anwsered
" no
, that doesn ' t sound funny
"
,
then
( ding ding ding
!
) you ' re absolutely correct
! for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple
( played by tim allen
annd kirstie alley
) who seek refuge infact an amish community after thier bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best know as newman on tv ' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them in trouble for tax evasion
. what ensues is a badly scripted
anbd horribly directed 114 mintues of cinema hell
. wqat makes thsi all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing up
, tje married cuple is brad
and caroline sexton
( allen
and alley
)
, a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone eles
,
but in reality are on the brink ofthe divorce
. just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it ' s final thread
, brad discovers that his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton ' s names
. thge irs catchs on
,
but since everthing points bakc to the sexton ' s
adn nto lachman
, there is nothing much tothe do
.
.
. except run awya
and join an amish comunity
. first timne screenwriters jana howington
and steve lukanic give us a cuple ofthe chuckle
- outloud
- loud moments
,
and even some decent laughs here
and
* way
* over there
,
but there isnt so much to cringe at in this horribly made film taht ytou ' ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn
. alley is absolutely unwatchable
,
annd the chemistry between her
and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade
( which
, i inform you
, was total b
. s
.
)
. allen
and alley are infact noone way convincing as tycoons
, nor are they very convincing as an amish couple
! this entire movie isnt oen bad ill
- conceived notion that shoudln have beeen curtailed ffrom yhe very beggining
! the amish in this movie are aslo flimsy
and unconvincing
. it ' s such a trite
, stereotypical script that i imagine the actors thgat were casted
( noticing that they ' re all predominantly tv figures
) weere probably the only ones they could get
! bryan spicer ' s directing doesn ' t help oen bit
, eather
. in fatc
, listing spicer ' s filmography
( which includes the first
" power rangers
" movie
annd the big screen adaption of mchale ' s navy
) is moreso of an insult than a r
? sum
?
! now that i ' ve preety much run for richer or poorer into tghe ground
, i will let yuo in on the best thnig about it
. it bumped seven films uv a notch on my
" worst of
" 1997 movie list
. that ' s right
, thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the eyar ' s worst
, six films are nowe nto seemingly as bad
,
and a smile liek yours
, previously inhabiting the number ten spot
, nowe doesn ' t have tothe suffer tje ridicule of mkaing my bottom ten list
. if you look at it inaddition that respect
, for richer or poorer will end up making somene happy after all
!
