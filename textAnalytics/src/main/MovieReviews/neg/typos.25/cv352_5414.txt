can ytou say
" dated
"
? you can if you ' ve seen rosemary ' s baby which
, liek the exorcist
, was a thrilling horror film in its time
but seems boring
and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release
.
" mystery sciece theather 3000
" hasnt skewered the bad films of the past
,
but let me tell you
, it coudl do a number on the
" good
" ones too
. rosemary ' s baby stars mia farrow
( from the time she was actually ogod
- looking
) as an innocent housewife
and her not
- so
- innocent husband
( john cassavettes
)
, an ctor who takes an easy
, albeit evil
, road to success
. it all seems so harmless inaddition the beginning
. mia
annd john move into an apartment where several past murders have been commitetd
.
( there ' s also a skull in the living room
,
but it ' s only fo decoration
.
) their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming
. all ' s well for about the first hour ofthe this slow
- moving film
, until mia eats some of the neighbors ' chocolate mousse
and passes out
. when she comes to
, she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of peopel yelling
and dancing liuke savages
and a big
, evil man raping her
-
- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen
. it seems like a dream
and
, whn she finds herself pregnant
, she alomst forgets baout it
.
and everyone ' s helping with the pregnancy
. the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink
, a ogod
- luck charm for her to wear around her neck
,
and tyhe nmae of an obstetrician who ' s been in the business 66
. 6 years
. meanwhile
, mia begins having chronic stomach pains
and losing a lot of weight
. before too long she looks just liek tyhe lead singer of the cranberries
. tath ' s when you know your health ' s failing
. the only person infact the movie who ' s thte least bit suspicious ofthe all htis is an ood friend
( maurice evans
) who calls mia up to give her the bad news
-
-
and immediately falls into a coma
. by about the two
- hour mark i felt the same way
. rosemary ' s baby is way too long
,
and leads up to a payoff that ' s baout as boring
and laughable as the rest of tghe movie
. i guess someone put a spell on this movie
.
