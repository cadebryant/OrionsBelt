, like the exorcist
, ws a thrilling horror film in its tiome

.
" mistery sciecne theater 3000
" has skewered the bad films of tjhe past
, bu let me tell you
, it sould do a number onthe the
" good
" ones too
. rosemary
' s baby stars mia farrow
( from the time she wass actually good
- looking
) as an innocent housewife adn her not
- so
- innocent husban
( john cassavettes
)
, an ator who takes an eazy
, albiet evil
, road to success
. it all seems so harmless in the beginning
. mia annd john move inot an apartment where several past murders have been cmmitted
.
( there
' s also a skull infront the living room
, bu it
' s only fo decoration
.
) thier elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming
. all
' s well fo about the first hour of this slow
- moving film
, until mia eats some ofthe the neighbors
' chocolate mousse adn passes out
. when she comes to
, she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling adn dancing like savages adn a big
, evil man raping her
-
- a foreshadowing ofthe her future life with woody allen
. it seems like a dream adn
, when she finds herself pregnant
, she almost forgets baout it
. anbd everyone
' s helping with tghe pregnancy
. tjhe neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions forthe her to drink
, a good
- luck charm for her to mear around her neck
