man
, this ws one wierd movei
. similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn ' t decide which genre it is
. yhe first hour is your standard stock aliens clone
, whihc nicely created an eerie atmosphere baout the ship
. the last half hour
? htis was wehn the makers blew the scirpt out the airlock
and just desided
-
" screw it
, let ' s jsut kill everybody
"
. fomr
then on
- forget sci
- fi
.
.
. this movei becomes 100
% horror
. what really dissappointed me about tihs movie was tyhat it tryed to scare you in entirely the wrong way
. instead of using clever tricks or trying to build uv to a scare
- htis movei just uses loud noises
, sudden camera shifts
and short quick bursts of gore
.
.
.
.
. yawn
.
.
.
. everyone ' s seen it all before
and knows when to expect it
. the one thing tyhat was done well was the lead uv to finding out about waht happened to the previvous crew
. htere are skeletons lying around mangled
anbd mashed
,
but what did thsi
?
then fianlly after being painfully restored
- the newyorker crew views the video
. the acting isn ' t too bad at all
.
.
.
.
. considering what thte actors hadnt to wokr iwth anyway
, as there isnt noone complex or interesting dialogue to speak ofthe
. there was some vyre nice camerawork inwhich certain sequences
though
, liuke when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached
and the camera pans back tothe follow specific objects as they bounce across tghe deck
and are sucked out inot spoace
. this movie sould have been so much better
. it had a ogod experienced casted who deserved mroe to work with
. ther was just nothing newyorker here that any of us haven ' t seen before infact aliens or hellraiser
.
