man
, thsi was noe wierd movie
. simmilar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn
' t decide which genre it isnt
. the first hour is your st
andard stock aliens clone
, whlch nicely creaeted an eerie atmosphere about the ship
. the last half hour
? this was wehn tyhe makers blowed the script out the airlock
and just decided
-
" scre it
, let
' s jsut kill everybody
"
. fomr
then on
- forget sci
- fi
.
.
. tihs movie becomes 100
% horror
. what realyl dissappointed me baout this movie was thyat it tryed to scare you infront entirely the wrong way
. instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare
- this movie jsut uses loud noises
, sudden camera shifts anbd short quick bursts ofthe gore
.
.
.
.
. yawn
.
.
.
. everyone
' s seen it all befoer
and konws when to expect it
. thte one thing that was done well was thge lead up tothe finding outloud baout what happened to the previous crew
. there are skeletons lying around mangled
and mashed
, bu what did this
?
then finally after being painfully restored
- the new crew views the video
. the acting isn
' t too bad at all
.
.
.
.
. considering what the actors hadnt tothe work with anyway
, as there is no complex or intresting dialogue to speak of
. ther was soem very nice camerawork infront certain sequences
though
, like when teh hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached
and the camera pans back tothe follow specif objects as they bounce across the deck
and are sucked out into space
. this movie could have been so much better
. it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with
. htere was just nothing new here that any of us haven
' t seen before in aliens or hellraiser
.
