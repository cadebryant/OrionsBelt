walt disney studios may have finaly met its match wiht the lush animation inthe twentieth century fox
' s anastasia
.
but judging by thte latest efforts from tje don bluth studios
, the visuals are the only thing fox hasnt to brag baout
. disney
' s reccent classics hve occasionally stretched credibility inspite such films as pocahontas
, tjhe hunchback of notre dame
,
and to a lesser extent
, hercules
. with anastasia
, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out yhe window
. some may say
- so what
? it
' s just a kid
' s movei
. well
.
.
. if you have young kids
, beware
, as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse
- rotting rasputin zombie
, whose body parts continually fall off inthe a disconcertingly rela way
. consider yourselves warned
. neverthless
, the animation is quite stunning at times
. don bluth hasnt used computer animation extensively throughout
, occasionalyl rivalling photographic quality
.
and
yet in otehr scenes
, the h
and
- drawn material seems of the saturday
- morning tv crowd
, whcih leads me to wonder
.
.
. wass this rushed tothe market tothe combat disney
? the plot
, as anyone who had read history befoer knows
, concerns the attemp tothe return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs infront 1916
. not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened
. as for the plot
