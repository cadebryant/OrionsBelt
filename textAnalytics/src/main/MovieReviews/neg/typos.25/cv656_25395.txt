it seemed like the perfect concept
. waht better for the farrelly brothers
, famouse for writing anbd directing comedies wih offensive subject matter
, than to mkea a movie about a guy with a split personality
? it
' s exactly tje sort of thing tyhe brothers relish
: poking fun at something sereous
( in tihs case mental illness
)
, throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh
. jim carrey
' s signed on too
? even better
. teh national alliance for the mentally ill even helpped out by levying complaints agianst the brothers
' new film before its opening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed like just the sort ofthe thing tht would
, ofthe course
, only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers
' fire
, proving that some people jsut couldn
' t take a joke
,
and thta the farrellys would be helping the moreso enlightened viewers tothe
yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but oen thnig whent wrong
: thier movie isn
' t funny
. it
' s nto for lack of trying
. the farrellys utilize in
" me
, mysef
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wife fo a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his agresive feelings deep down inside
and never release them
. this
, of course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enought
, charlie
' s repressed aggression manifests itself inot a second
, independen personality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his precedessor had been unable to muster
. this guy isn
' t above crashing a car through tyhe wall ofthe the barber shop in wich he
' s been insulted
, or holding a little girl
' s head underwater because she refused tothe stop jump
- roping in the street
. hten things start getting lost in the most complicated plot tyhe farrellys have ever attemped
,
and teh film runs off its tracks
. some have suggested tht htis isn
' t a problem
, because the farrelly brothers
' br
and ofthe humor doesn
' t recquire plot to work
. they
' re wrong
, of course
: plot was greatly instrumental in buidling up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys
' last effort
, 1996
' s
" there
' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999
' s
" outside providence
" wass technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers
' earlier film wasn
' t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags
( despite what some newsmagazine articles woudl have you beleave
)
,
but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. inwhich
" mary
,
" hte farrellys managed severeal times to pull off a neat sleight
- of
- h
and trck
: they
' d have you thikning the story was going one way
, thne reveal its rela direction inthe delightfully surprising fashion
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems tothe have been made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
and saw onyl the surfce grossness
, missing all of hte subtle machinations that really made it work
. hvaing beeen produced by tghe smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liuke an even bigger disappointment
. tyhe brothers pile on tje offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental ilness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
. bu they haven
' t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most ofthe
" me
, mysef
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- the
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. thge plot
, with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who
' s in more trouble than anyone konws
, back tothe new york
, hasnt an ending thyat
' s entirely predictable from the get
- go
.
( think charlie adn irene will fall in love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
then introduce scores of different characters
,
and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven
' t already expected them to do
, no matter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared to the curveballs the farrellys are utilisied to throwing
, this stuff is almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious problem
: when gross
- outloud humer loses its shock value
, it
' s noone longer funny
, merely gross
. the jokes thast do work are milked over
and over until their effectiveness runs dry
. take
, fo example
, the subplot involving charlie
' s three balck sons
( anthony
anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity of it all is funny for a while
, with three burly black men discussing higher math inaddition ghetto language
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too
- pleasnat smile on his face
.
but by tyhe end of the film
, they
' re still donig the same schitck it hasn
' t been elevated tothe another
, funnier level
,
and it hasn
' t beeen dropped either
. that
' s too bad
, because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks of wasted opportunities
. there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie
' s new personality
,
and onthe how charlie deals with the consequences ofthe hank
' s actions
. this doesn
' t really happn nearly every supporting character learns about charlie
' s condidtion easly on
, so they don
' t have any opportunity tothe be surprised by it
. the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie adn irene pick uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but the script doesn
' t go anywhere with it
, instead leaving the thread twisting infront the wind befor awkwardly tying it up durring thge climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physically
and vocally
,
but he
' s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself infront a manner simular to steve martin inwhich
" all of me
.
" it
' s a great showcase ofthe flexability
and splitted
- second role
- shifting
,
but none of it isnt terribly funny
. carrey doesn
' t pull any stunts we don
' t expect him to pul
,
and the farrellys
' scirpt doesn
' t give him anytying alse to pull
: tyhe situations in which he must peform the role
- shifting aren
' t set up in any meaningful way
. perhaps carrey cxan tkae solace infront the fatc that his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger
' s irene is nto a storng female lead mary infront
" mary
" may have been part adolescent fantasy
,
but she was also intelligent annd strong
- willed
. irene is nothing in particular
, as the film never makes clera whether she
' s ditzy
, clever
, or neither
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only
" sane
" person in thge film
. chris cooper is stuck playing exactlly one onot as a corrupt fbi agent
, anbd his character is entirely too straight
- laced forthe a movie like this
. he
, like the others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. after viewing the shapeless mess that
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventually dissolved into
, i was sticked wondering whether or nto hte farrellys had outsmarted themselves
. maybe theri kind ofthe comedy cin only work forthe so long until audiences get wise to it
and stpo being shocked
.
but i don
' t believe it
-
- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to thier stlye
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
(
and i still think they are
)
, they
' ll rebound jsut fine
. even after that happens
,
though
, i
' ll still concider
" me
, myself
& irene
" to be a high
- caliber misfire
.
