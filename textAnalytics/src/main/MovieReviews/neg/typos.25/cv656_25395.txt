it seemed like the perfect concept
. what better for the farrelly brothers
, famous for writing
and directing comedies with offensive subject matter
, than tothe make a movei about a guy with a split personality
? it ' s exactly the sort of hting the brothers relish
: poking fun at something serious
( infront this case mental illess
)
, throwing all care tothe the wind to git a laff
. jim carrey ' s signed on too
? even better
. the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped outloud by levying complaints against the brothers ' new film before its opening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that woudl
, ofthe course
, only add more fuel to tyhe farrelly brothers ' fire
, proving that some people just couldn ' t take a joke
,
and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to
yet anyother dose ofthe their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
bu one thing went wrong
: their movei isn ' t funny
. it ' s not fo lack of trying
. tyhe farrellys utilize infact
" me
, myself
& irene
" theri most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who aftter being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver
, decides tothe bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside
adn never realease them
. this
, of course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie ' s repressed aggresion manifests itself inot a second
, independent personality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking yhe assertive actions his predecessor had been unable tothe muster
. this guy isn ' t above crashing a car thru the wall of teh barber shop infront which he ' s been insulted
, or holding a little girl ' s head underwater because she refused to stop jump
- roping in tghe street
.
then things start getting lost inwhich the most complicated plot the farrellys haev ever attempted
,
and the film runs off its tracks
. soem ahve suggested tht tihs isn ' t a problem
, because the farrelly brothers ' brand of humor doesn ' t require plot to work
. tehy ' re wrong
, of course
: plot wass greatly instrumental in building up hte kind ofthe rollicking comic energy that infused teh farrellys ' last effort
, 1996 ' s
" htere ' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999 ' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers ' earlier film wasn ' t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags
( dispite what some newsmagazine articles would hvae you bleieve
)
,
but rather because its most outrageous gags weere entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed severeal times tothe pul off a neat sleight
- ofthe
- hand trck
: tehy ' d have you thinking the storey ws going one way
,
then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems to hve been made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
adn saw onyl the surface grossness
, missing all of the subtle machinations tyhat really made it wrok
. haveing beeen produced by the same guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems like an even bigger disappointment
. yhe brothers pile on the offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
.
but they haven ' t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of
" me
, mysef
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- yhe
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. the plot
, with carrey forced tothe drive alledged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who ' s in more trouble than anyone knows
, back to new york
, hasnt an ending that ' s entirely predictable fomr the git
- go
.
( think charlie
and irene wiull fall infront love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
then introduce scores of different characters
,
and none ofthe them ever manage to do anything you haven ' t already expected them to do
, noone marter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared to the curveballs hte farrellys are utilizied tothe throwing
, this stuff isnt almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: when gross
- out humer loses its shock value
, it ' s noone longer funny
, merely gross
. tghe jokes tht do work are milked over
and over until their effectiveness runs dry
. take
, for exemple
, the subplot involving charlie ' s threee black sons
( anthony anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity of it all isnt funny forthe a while
, whith three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too
- plesant smile onthe his face
.
but by the end of the film
, they ' re still donig the same schitck it hasn ' t been elevated tothe anyother
, funnier level
,
adn it hasn ' t beeen dropped either
. that ' s too bad
, becuase it ceases tothe be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks ofthe wasted opportunities
. ther ought to be omre foucs on how otehr peopel react to charlie ' s newyorker personality
,
and on how charlie deals with teh consequences ofthe hank ' s actions
. this doesn ' t really happen nearly eveyr supporting chracter learns about charlie ' s condition early on
, so they don ' t have any opportunity to be suprised by it
. the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towords the midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pick uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but thge scirpt doesn ' t go anywhere with it
, instade leaving the thread twisting in the wind befoer awkwardly tying it up durig the climax
. jim carrey isnt a gifted comedian
, both physically
and vocally
,
bu he ' s left with nothing much tothe dont here except contort himself in a manner simmilar to steve martin infront
" all ofthe me
.
" it ' s a great showcase ofthe flexibility
and split
- second role
- shifting
,
but none ofthe it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn ' t pull any stunts we don ' t expect him to pull
,
adn the farrellys ' script doesn ' t give him anything else to pull
: the situations in which he must perform the role
- shifting aren ' t set up in any meaningful way
. perhaps carrey can take solace infact the fact that his supporting actors fare noone better
. zellweger ' s irene is not a strong female lead mary in
" mary
" may have beeen part adolescent fantasy
,
but she was also intelligent
and strong
- willed
. irene is nothing in particular
, as the film never makes clear whether she ' s ditzy
, clever
, or neither
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only
" sane
" person in yhe film
. chris cooper is stuck playing exactly oen onot as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his character isnt entirely too straight
- laced for a movie like this
. he
, like the others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. after viewing the shapeless mess that
" me
, mysef
& irene
" eventually dissolved into
, i was stuck wondering whther or nto the farrellys had outsmarted themselves
. mabey theri kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise tothe it
and stop bieng shocked
.
but i don ' t believe it
-
- ogod filmmakers fidn ways of surprising thier audiences even after peopel have grown attuned to thier style
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
(
annd i still think they are
)
, they ' ll rebound just fine
. even after that happens
,
though
, i ' ll still consdider
" me
, myself
& irene
" tothe be a high
- calaber misfire
.
