there isnt a scene early in jakob tyhe liar that hints at how much better it coudl have been
. the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in pol
and circa 1944
, where a one
- time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely thru the streets
, fists stuffed into coat pockets
. to one side ofthe him
, residents scavenge for food in the street
; tothe the other side
, german troops beat a gropu of jews
. jakob
,
however
, never stops moving
. it
' s an efficient
, effective set
- up for tghe character
, who is clearly nobody
' s idea of a hero at the outset
. he is a man who hasnt responded tothe the horror of his suroundings by withdrawing ffrom them
, excising his moral peripheral vision
. the setted
- up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior
. after a visit tothe a german comm
andant
' s office
and a moment alone with a turned
- on radio
, jakob learns that russion troops are qtuie near
. when he brings this first news of the war inthe years to his fellow jews
, tehy become convinced that he must have a rdaio
, which isnt a punishable offense in the ghetto
. the good news brings hope to yhe ghetto
; the everyday specktor of suicide vanishes
. a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress jsut to keep his neighbors alive
. htis promising story ofthe an ordinary person doing hte extrodinary is burdened from hte outset by casting
: the
" ordinary person
" infront question
, jakob heym
, is played by robin williams
. i am ofthe thge depressing opinion thyat williams is growing less assured as an actor inwhich his
" serious
" roles wiht every passing eyar
. compare his dramtic scenes in the world according to garp adn moscow on thge hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams
,
and see how much mroe mannered he has become
( or
, at the very least
, how much less sensable at choosing material
)
. jakob hte liar depends on the notion that jakob hasnt tothe struggle to craft his fictions
,
but williams always looks liek he
' s struggling
_ nto
_ to craft them
. wehn he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10
- year
- old orphan lina
( hannah taylor gordon
)
, he seems relieved that he cin finally get wacky
. oh yes
, adn
then there
' s thgat little girl
. some viewers wiull undoubtely consider the hero
' s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful
, bu those scenes aren
' t problematic because they
' re familiar
. they
' re problematic because they
' re jarring
and distracting
, introducing a cutesy relationship into a film tath shouldn
' t have been about cutesy relationships
. jakob
' s character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benifit of others
,
but there are plenty ofthe others without poor littel lina
. every scene with her feels contrived
, pulling jakob the liar away from its central tsory of hope coming to a previously hopeless people
. it is a pleasant suprise tothe find that jakob tghe liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood
- ized holocaust
, combining the weighty subject matter with dark humer inwhich some effective ways
. directer peter kassovitz
, working from jurek becker
' s novel
, crafts some nice scenes beetwen jakob
and thge other townspeople
,
and draws solid performances from armin mueller
- stahl
( as a once
- revered doctor
)
and bob balaban
( as a barber drifting into depression
)
. htere are just too many things going on thta proove distracting
, whether it
' s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter
, or williams
' incongrous presence
, or a sweet
but utterly irrelevant little girl
. jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject forthe such fumbling
,
and has too compelling a central character to waste
.
and aftter one wonderful eearly scene
, you cxan see the film wasted
and fumbled awya
.
