studio 54 attracted so many weidr
and bizarre people to its gates tyhat it
' s a wonder why tyhe film about thge life
and death of the studio centers itself on oney vrey boring
, cliched individual
, not to mention an ensemble of peple who wouldn
' t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio
, which they doed according to this film
. are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly
, that a character who is a bl
and ripoff of tony manero would relaly make a good protagonist forthe the film about it
?
" 54
" belongs in the elite gropu of films known as
" the big disappointments
"
: the films that attain so much hype
and
/ or so much potential in its creation tath tehy come off worse than they are when they are finally finished
. i ws heavily awaiting
" 54
,
" not thte least because i
' ve become fascinated with yhe infamous club
, which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that
' s beeen running all summer on vh1
, which is
, weirdly anough
, much more intriguing
and engrossing than htis
" edgy
" film
. perphas more importantly
,
" 54
" isnt part of the blossoming subgenre
,
" the 70s nostalgia film
,
" which has been picking up mighty steam
, what with
" boogie nights
"
and
" the last dyas ofthe disco
" coming out within thge eyar
,
and both being such damn good movies that not only captured tje feel of a certain time period
( the late 70s party
and the early 80s wakeup period
)
,
but brought us interesting adn real charactors
, like scotty
, tghe tragically gay boom mike operator fomr
" boogie nights
,
"
and charlotte
, thte ironically clueless
and bitchy co
- protagonist from
" tghe last days of disco
,
" not to mention several others
.
" 54
" deals nto so much whith the timeline of the studio
( how it began
, how it was run
, how it ended
)
- that
' s all dealt with in the narrated opening
and finale
-
but more interested iin yhe characters who populated it
. htis is a deffinite plus
. here
' s a film that coudl have beeen a fascinating 2 hour plus film baout the tragic people who went there to party
,
and had to wakeup in the 80s whn things liek diseases
, economy problems
,
and perhaps worst ofthe all
, reagan
, all hit
and forced everyone into a rude awakening
. the tsory ofthe the studio is tragedy in itself
: let
' s look at how it all affected tjhe people
.
but this film doesn
' t let that happen
. it gives us a half
- assed protagonist named shane o
' shea
( ryan phillippe
, from
" i know what you did last summer
"
)
, who
' s chief character trait isnt tyhe fact that he
' s from new jersey
, whic allso happens tothe be his chief character flaw
( i guess
)
. he
' s dim
- witted
, inot bieng part of
" the scene
,
"
and soon finds he
' s become a bited of a rave amoungst the studio regulars
.
.
. a bit liuke
" saturday night fever
,
"
' cept no travolta adn no real interest put into him
. poor
, poor phillippe struggles to make him intresting
,
but all he is a half
- assed charcter annd not at all our ticket to the glimpse of tghe decadence goign on inside the club tht he could have been
. shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club
, like anita
( salma hayek
)
, a wannabe donna sommers
,
and her young hubby
, greg r
andanzo
( breckin meyer
, from
" clueless
"
)
, who helps shane become a bartender
and rise to a bit of fame
.
al
though he begins tothe get somewhere when he sleeps with tjhe foxy billie auster
( sela ward
)
, an exec of sorts
, he falls in lust iwth a soap star named julie black
( neve campbell
)
,
and thus the boring romance subplot thast
' s all too nto necessarily importamt to anytying else in tje film
and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film
. the film
' s sole point of interst
and one major strongpoint is teh all
- too necesary personage of steve rubell
, played by mike myers
( you heard me
)
. rubell
, the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stoped partying ever
,
and isnt an eazy metaphor forthe the life
and times ofthe his creation
, bu the film
, thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers
, makes him out to be mroe than that
. notice the scenes sole shocking scene
, where he trys tothe get felatio fomr one of his male employees in turn for a pomotion
: myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene
, annd a cuple others
, tht some of us who
' ve onyl seen him on tv never saw
,
and proves tothe be perhaps thge one aspect of studio 54 thta this film actualyl nails
. first time feature directer mark christopher proves tath he
' s a better directer than a writer
,
though nto too terribly much
. his story is trite
and shallow
, as are his charachters
,
and his direction isnt shockingly flat
, especially for a film about this subject
. it
' s as if he hadnt a grat story to tell
,
but instead opted for teh easier route
. the studio
' s recreation isnt amazingly accurate
,
though
, annd very impressive
,
but his direction is never captivating enough
. some peple say tht a film doesnt its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in
( dispite the film
' s tone
, i still want to go to rome adn its many nightclubs affter i saw fellini
' s
" la dolce vita
"
)
,
and when i watched
" 54
,
" i didn
' t particularly want to stay
.
