studio 54 attracted so many weird
and bizarre people tothe its gates that it ' s a wonder why the film baout the life
and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring
, cliched individual
, not to mention an ansamble ofthe people who wouldn ' t be at all fascinating unless they worked at thte studio
, which they doed according to htis film
. are we supposed to believe thyat out ofthe all tje strange folk who populated the studio nightly
, thta a character who is a bland ripoff ofthe tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it
?
" 54
" belongs in tyhe elite gropu of films known as
" the big disappointments
"
: the films that attain so much hype
anbd
/ or so much potential in its creation that they cmo off worse than they are when tehy are finally finished
. i ws heavily awaiting
" 54
,
" not tjhe least because i ' ve become facinated wih the infamous club
, which has been the subject of an engrossing documentery tht ' s beeen running all summer on vh1
, which is
, weirdly enough
, much omre intriguing
adn engrossing than this
" edgy
" film
. perhaps mroe importantly
,
" 54
" is part of the blossoming subgenre
,
" teh 70s nostalgia film
,
" which has been picking up mighty steam
, whta with
" boogie nights
"
and
" the last days ofthe disco
" coming out within the year
,
and both being such damn good movies thast not only captued tghe feel of a certain time period
( the late 70s party
and the early 80s wakeup period
)
,
but brought us interesting
and real characters
, like scotty
, the tragically gay boom mike operator from
" boogie nights
,
"
and charlotte
, the ironically clueless
and bitchy co
- protagonist from
" thge lastest days ofthe disco
,
" not to mention severeal others
.
" 54
" deals nto so much with the timeline of the studio
( how it began
, how it was run
, how it ended
)
- thyat ' s all dealt with in yhe narrated opening
and finale
-
but more interested in the characters who populated it
. this is a definite plus
. here ' s a film that could have beeen a fascinating 2 hour plus film about thge tragic people who went ther to party
,
and hadnt tothe wakeup inwhich the 80s wehn things like diseases
, economy problems
,
and perhaps worst ofthe all
, reagan
, all hit
and forced everyone inot a rude awakening
. the story ofthe the studio isnt tragedy in itself
: let ' s look at how it all affected the people
.
but this film doesn ' t let that ahppen
. it gives us a half
- assed protagonist named shane o ' shea
( ryan phillippe
, from
" i nkwo what you did last summer
"
)
, who ' s chief character trait is the fact tath he ' s from newyorker jersey
, which also happens to be his cheif character flaw
( i guess
)
. he ' s dim
- witted
, inot being part of
" the scene
,
"
and soon finds he ' s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars
.
.
. a bited like
" saturday night fever
,
" ' cept no travolta
and no real interest put inot him
. poor
, poor phillippe struggles tothe amke him interesting
,
bu all he is a half
- assed character
adn not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside teh club that he could have been
. shane begins tothe hang outloud with soem other denizens of the club
, like anita
( salma hayek
)
, a wannabe donna sommers
,
annd her young hubby
, greg randanzo
( breckin meyer
, from
" clueless
"
)
, who helps shane become a bartender
annd rise to a bited of fame
.
although he begins to get somwhere when he sleeps wiht the foxy billie auster
( sela ward
)
, an exec of sorts
, he falls in lust withthe a soap star named julie black
( neve campbell
)
,
and thus yhe boring romance subplot that ' s all too not neccessarily important to anything else in the film
anbd never really becomes interesting at any point in thge film
. the film ' s sole point of interest
and one major strongpoint is the all
- too necesary personage of steve rubell
, palyed by mike myers
( you heard me
)
. rubell
, the famouse head of teh studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever
,
adn isnt an easy metaphor for the life
and times of his creation
,
but the film
, thanks to a suprizingly strong performence by myers
, makes him out to be more than that
. notice tghe scenes sole shocking scene
, where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion
: myers brings the humanity to rubell in thsi scene
,
and a cuple others
, thast some of us who ' ve only seen him on tv never saw
,
and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 thyat this film actually nails
. first time feature director mark christopher proves that he ' s a better director tahn a writter
,
though not too terribly much
. his stoy is trite
and shallow
, as are his charachters
,
adn his direction is shockingly flat
, especially for a film baout htis subject
. it ' s as if he had a graet story to tell
,
but instead opted for the easier route
. tyhe studio ' s recreation is amazingly accurate
,
though
,
and very impressive
,
but his direction is never captivating enough
. some peple say that a film does its job if it makes you whant to visit the locale it takes place in
( despite the film ' s tone
, i still want to go to rome
and its many nightclubs aftter i saw fellini ' s
" la dolce vita
"
)
,
and when i watched
" 54
,
" i didn ' t particularly want to stay
