would you believe
-
- inthe rela life
, i mean
-
- that if you weere julia roberts
, tht you ' d be the ugly underdog to your sister
, yhe creepy catherine zeta
- jones
? let me tell you what reality isnt
. reality is thgat you are megastar julia fricking roberts
and your brother is eric roberts
,
and he picks up whatever crumbs ofthe stardom fall off your coattails as yuo blaze across yhe sky in a golden chariot
. that ' s reality
. america ' s sweethearts is the opposite ofthe reality
, a train wreck that trys to sell julia as a scruffy aslo
- ran
, presumably because she wears horn
- rimmed glasses
annd used to be overweight
( uh
- huh
)
. thte plot follows two married
, mega
- movei stars
, gwen
and eddie
( zeta
- jones
and poor
, poor john cusack
, whose material gets worse every year
)
, onthe the eve of thier newyorker star vehicle ' s release
, a film called timne over time
. the onyl problem
: gwen
and eddie haev gone through a nasty separation
,
anbd the press
and public have not been forgiving
( think meg
and dennis
)
. gosh
,
and the director has vanished wih the film
, holding the only print hostage
. veteran pr agent lee
( billy crystal
) is called upon to clean up hte mess
, throwing a press junket inspite the nevada desert tothe woo them whith the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen
and eddie
, presumably distracting the stupid
, stupid film critics into forgetting they haven ' t seen hte movie at all
.
( note tothe sony
: any studio executive that thikns this plot is going tothe win points wiht the reviewing press needs to check into rehab
.
)
and did i mention gwen ' s sister kiki
( roberts
) isnt along forthe the ride
?
and thgat she
and eddie just might fall inwhich love allong the way
? oh billy
, you ' re a scamp
! the script you ' ve co
- written iwth peter tolan
( what planet are yuo from
?
and bedazzled
-
- need i say moreso
?
) is a roast of hollywood
and celebrity
, sure
,
but it ' s not a funny oen
. yes
, crystal tells us
, hollywood is lieing to our faces
! if you are surprised by this
, ytou might whant to check on your subscription tothe people magasine
. it ' s about to expire
. asside from a scant few zingers
( yeah
, se
? or winces rules
!
)
, america ' s sweethearts ' jokes aren ' t funny
, its pace is choppy
,
annd tje wohle afair comes off as a vanity project
-
- nto for headlining star julia roberts
-
-
but forthe billy crystal to deliver a bunch ofthe lame punch lines that he wroet himself
. i didn ' t time it
( the movei ' s not that bad
)
,
bu it ' s crystal who really has the most screen tiome
and isnt the unequivocal focus of teh film
. bad move
, billy
-
- your jokes suck
. the crotch humor is outpaced only by tyhe meanness of the movie ' s gags
-
-
and with unsubtle sexual inuendo dripping from every scene
, how thsi movei earned a pg
- 13 rating isnt a mystery to me
. julia overcame a lot ofthe spiteful wirting
and acting tothe make my best friend ' s wedding into a winning film
,
but not even that 90
- tooth smile can save her here
. obviously aware of the ugliness before him
, director joe roth turns tothe goofy supporting characters like hank azaria
( as a lisping spaniard
)
, christopher walken
( the insane time over time director
)
,
and alan arkin
( a newyorker age guru in a fright wig
) tothe crack wise
. none of the stereotypes is sucessfull exept for walken
; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he ' s supposed to be macho
. as forthe roth
, in case you don ' t know
, went ffrom direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movei studio
, revolution
, whic produced thsi wrok
. he ' s back behind the camera for hte first time inthe 11 years
. it ' ll probably be anohter 11 before he ' s back agian
. i could drone onthe baout how america ' s sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth
- breathing morons who talk on thier cell phones during the movies
,
bu thta would get old
. instade
, i ' ll settle for discussing the movie ' s worst sin
: thyat sweethearts is painfully contrived
and wholly unbelievable
, not just in its plot
but in its sentiment
. every single character iin this film
( with the arguable exception ofthe kiki
) is simply hateful
,
and puting them infact a romantic comedy isnt a waste of a bunch of villains
. wehn you leave tghe theater
, ytou ' ll ask youself
, too
: why would i want any of theese jerks to be happy
?
