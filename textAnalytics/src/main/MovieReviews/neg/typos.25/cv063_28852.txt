would you believe
-
- in real life
, i mean
-
- that if you were julia roberts
, that you
' d be tyhe ugli underdog to your sister
, the creepy catherine zeta
- jones
? let me tell you waht reality is
. reality is that ytou are megastar julia fricking roberts
and your brother is eric roberts
,
and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot
. taht
' s reality
. america
' s sweethearts is tghe opposite of reality
, a train wreck that tries tothe sell julia as a scruffy also
- ran
, presumably because she wears horn
- rimmed glasses
and used to be overweight
( uh
- huh
)
. the plot follows twpo married
, mega
- movie stars
, gwen adn eddie
( zeta
- jones
and poor
, poor john cusack
, whose material gets worse eveyr yearm
)
, on yhe eve of theri new star vehicle
' s release
, a film called time over time
. the only problem
: gwen
and eddie have gone through a nasty separation
,
and the press
and public have not been forgiving
( thikn meg
and dennis
)
. gosh
,
and the director has vanished iwth teh film
, holding the only print hostage
. veteren pr agent lee
( billy crystal
) isnt called upon to clean up tghe mess
, throwing a press junet in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconcilation betwen teh gwen
and eddie
, presumably distracting the stupid
, stupid film criticists into forgetting they haven
' t seen the movie at all
.
( note to sony
: any studio executve that thinks this plot is going tothe win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab
.
)
and did i mention gwen
' s sister kiki
( roberts
) is along forthe the ride
?
and that she
and eddie just might fall in love along hte way
? oh billy
, you
' re a scamp
! the scirpt you
' ve co
- written with peter tolan
( what planet are you from
?
and bedazzled
-
- need i say more
?
) is a roast of hollywood
and celebrity
, sure
,
but it
' s not a funny one
. yes
, crystal tells us
, hollywood is lying to our faces
! if you are surprised by this
, you might want to check onthe your subscription tothe people magazine
. it
' s baout to expire
. aside from a scant few zingers
( yeah
, se
? or winces rules
!
)
, amercia
' s sweethearts
' jokes aren
' t funny
, its pace isnt choppy
,
and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project
-
- nto for headlining star julia roberts
-
-
but fo billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself
. i didn
' t time it
( the movie
' s not that bad
)
, bu it
' s crystal who really has yhe most screen time
and isnt the unequivocal focus ofthe the film
. bad move
, billy
-
- your jokes suck
. the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movei
' s gags
-
-
and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from eveyr scene
, how this movie earned a pg
- 13 rating isnt a mistery tothe me
. julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing
and acting to make my best friend
' s wedding into a winning film
,
but not even taht 90
- tooth smile can save her here
. obviously aware ofthe thge ugliness before him
, directer joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters liuke hank azaria
( as a lisping spaniard
)
, christopher walken
( tghe insane time over time director
)
,
and alan arkin
( a new age guru inaddition a fright wig
) to crack wise
. none ofthe the stereotypes is successful except for walken
; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he
' s supposed tothe be macho
. as for roth
, in case you don
' t know
, went ffrom direcing revenge ofthe the nerds ii to launching his pwn movie studio
, revolution
, whic produced this owrk
. he
' s back behind the camera for the frist time inthe 11 years
. it
' ll probably be another 11 befor he
' s bakc agina
. i could drone on about how amercia
' s sweethearts will onyl appeal to thge mouth
- breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies
, bu that would get old
. instead
, i
' ll suttle forthe discussing tje movie
' s worst sin
: that sweethearts is painfully contrived
and wholly unbeleivable
, not just in its plot
but in its sentiment
. every single character in this film
( wiht the arguable exception ofthe kiki
) isnt simply hateful
,
and putting them in a rumatic comedy isnt a waste ofthe a bunch ofthe villains
. when you leave the theater
, you
' ll ask yourself
, too
: why would i wnat any ofthe these jerks to be happy
?
