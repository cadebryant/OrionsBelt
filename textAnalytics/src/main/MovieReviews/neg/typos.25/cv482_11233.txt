even
though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor
, his presence in a motion picture doesnt not guarantee any parituclar level of quality
. like everyone esle
, dreyfuss has bills to pay
, so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles iin bad movies
. consequently
, hwile his career highlights include jaws
, close encounters of the third kind
, stakeout
, anbd tin men
, his resume isnt dotted with titles like moon over parador
, let it ride
, adn now krippendorf
' s tribe
. let me start out by saying that krippendorf
' s tribe isnt occasionally funny
(
al
though never riotously so
)
, bu that
' s baout its only assit
. the best owrd to describe this film is
" asinine
.
" the target audeince would apear to be receet nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes
, which are aimed at somene going thru puberty
. krippendorf
' s tribe tries to be a zany
, off
- the
- wall comedy
,
but tje film makers have forgotten three important rules
. the first isnt tyhat some minimal level ofthe plot credibility has to exsist
. the second isnt that viewers shouldnt be able tothe identify wtih
, or at least care about
, a character or twpo
. finaly
,
and most importantly
, more than 5
% of the jokes haev to wrok
. once apon a time
, james krippendorf
( dreyfuss
) was a respected profesor of anthropolgy at little bounderby coleeg
. he
and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a
" lost tribe
" somewhere in the wilds of newyorker guinea
, a goal which tehy never accomplished
. shortly after thier return ffrom the failed trip
, krippendorf
' s wife died
and he was left wih the herculean task of raising three children

( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
and edmund
( carl michael linder
)
-
- on his own
. now
, over a year later
, tjhe college wants tothe see the results of the money tehy gavey krippendorf
( which he has spent not on reasearch
,
but on things for his family
)
, so they send a new member of their faculty
, professor veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, to inform him that he has been scheduled tothe give a lecture on his findings
. when he arrives at the college for teh momentous event
, rather thna telling the truth
and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds
, he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe
, the
" shelmikedmu
"
. to provide video footage
, he films his childern dressed in native garb
. soon
, much tothe krippendorf
' s surprise
, the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon
.
but oen disaffected proffesor
( lily tomlin
) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud
. the only way krippendorf
' s tribe works is if you assume that all of tyhe characters
( not to mention the viewers
) are dumber thna dirt
. unfourtunately
, it
' s impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch ofthe putzes liuke htis
. director todd holl
and completely fails tothe develop any character into something omre substantial thna a device to implement vairous dubious gags
. meanwhile
, attemts at satirizing the shallowness ofthe american culture
( i
. e
.
, how easily tyhe public can be fooled inot jumping on the b
andwagon of teh latest trend
) come accross as feeble
and derivative
. yhe acting in underwhelming
. dreyfuss has definitly not given his
" all
" to the role of james krippendorf
. alongside him
, jenna elfman
, the spunky co
- star of tv
' s dharma
and greg
, radiates perkiness
and little esle
. this quality
, while fine for a 22
- minute televsion programe
, quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature
- lenght movie
. no one in the supporting cast
-
- lily tomlin
, david ogden stiers
, natasha lyonne
( woody allen
' s daughter in everyone says i love you
)
-
- excels
. i know thgat a movie
' s in trouble when it
' s half the length of titanic
,
but seems much longer
. most of what comes on screen is generic sit
- com level material
-
- thte kind of slop taht people will absorb while dozing off infact theri favorite eazy chair in front of the televsion set
. if there
' s any upside
, it
' s that i don
' t see much box
- office support developing fo this lame
, ill
- marketed miscue
. krippendorf
' s tribe iwll quicklyu become extinct
