directer doug ellin ' s kissing a fool
, released earlier this year
, is an aptly titled comedy baout twpo plastic couples housed in an artifical stopry
. like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it
, tjhe movei meanders along insulting the viewers ' intelligence in almost every frame
. the script by james frey
and the directer is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you ' ve heard befoer
.
(
" i ' m nto wearing any underwear
,
" the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster
, max
, in what she assumes wiull be a sure
- fire come
- on line
.
) max
, chicago ' s biggest playboy
, decides to get married affter a whirlwind love affair wiht sam
, short for samantha
. max
and sam posess two irritating personalities
,
and htey hold littel chemistry for each other or the audeince
. max isnt played wihtout any sytle by david schwimmer
. schwimmer
, whose acting talent isnt palying characters devoid of personality
, makes an unlikey lover
. his costar
, mili avital as sam
, isnt cut ffrom the same cloth
, so they cin be argued tothe be a matched pair
. after all
, people of the same intlligence are naturally drawn to each otehr
, ditto for similiar looks
, so why shouldn ' t tje personality
- challanged be attracted
? the implausible plot has max asking his best friend
, jay
( jason lee
)
, tothe hitted onthe sam as a test
. jay is suppoed to try to get her tothe sleep with him
,
bu stop short of the actual ect
. max
, being promiscuous by nature
, worries that his future bride may ahev the smae need to sleep aroud as he doens
. the idea ofthe flirting with thte beatiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable tothe eat or owrk
. neither the script nor the actors make this test believeable
.
" the 64
, 000 question is
: how dont yuo know you ' re whith tje wrong person so ytou can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life
?
" jay asks in oney ofthe the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness tothe the film
. finally
, there is yhe film ' s attempt at fysical comedy
. jay ' s ex
- girlfriend natasha
( vanessa angel
) becomes infatuated wtih jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else
. natasha rips jay ' s shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa
. as she throws her hair on his bare chest
, she demands he pull it
. tihs is suppoed to be funny
? most films have soem saving grace
. smoe bit part was done expecially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn ' t
. kissing a fool
, onthe the other hand
, has nothing to reccomend it
. kissing a fool runs 1
: 45
. it isnt rated r fo profanity
and sexuality
and would be acceptable for most teenagers
