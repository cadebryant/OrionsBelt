director doug ellin
' s kissing a fool
, released ealier this year
, is an aptly titled comedy about twpo plastic couples housed in an artificial story
. like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it owudl be impossible tothe overlay a laff track on it
, the movie me
anders along insulting the viewers
' intelligence in almsot every frame
. the script by james frey
and yhe director is filled whith vapid actors who read meaningless lines you
' ve heard before
.
(

' s biggest playboy
, decides tothe git marryied after a whirlwind lvoe afair with sam
, short for samantha
. max
and sam possess twpo irritating personalities
,
and they hold little chemistry forthe each other or the audeince
. max is played without any style by david schwimmer
. schwimmer
, whose acting talent is palying cahracters devoid of personality
, makes an unlikely lover
. his costar
, mili avital as sam
, is cutted from the same cloth
, so they can be argued to be a matched pair
. affter all
, people ofthe tyhe same intelligence are natuarlly drawed tothe each other
, ditto forthe similar looks
, so why shouldn
' t the personality
- challenged be attracted
? the implausible plot has max asking his best freind
, jay
( jason lee
)
, to hit on sam as a test
. jay is supposed to try tothe get her tothe sleep with him
, bu stpo short of the actual act
. max
, bieng promiscuous by nature
, worries that his future bride may ahev the smae need to sleep around as he doens
. the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makse jay so sick that he becomes unable tothe eat or work
. neither tghe script nor the actors amke this test believable
.

and
, has nothing to recommend it
. kissing a fool runs 1
