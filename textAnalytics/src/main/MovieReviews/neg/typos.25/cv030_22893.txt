play it to the bone
, the newest addtion tothe ron shelton
' s sports
- themed repetoire fails iin numerous ways
. like most of shelton
' s otehr great films
( bull durham
, white men can
' t jump
)
, thsi dud unsuccessfully attempts tothe uise athleticism as a method of connecting charachters
and creating interesting subplots
. shelton
' s films are not consdidered sports films
, bu tehy do heavily revolve around a specif game to tell a story
. shelton has been so ogod in the past at useing sports to analyze the structure ofthe society tath from his collecton of films we are given an examination of differant classes
and races living in varios different regions
. play it to tghe bone is unsuccessful because not onyl is thte boxing theme dull
,
but tyhe side story ofthe the two guys
and a girl travelling across the ocuntry is even worse
. the film hasnt no social message liek its predecesors
. hte relationship between the friends
, two failed boxers who must face off against each other inwhich tghe ring for 50 thous
and dollars
, is very confusing for a number of reasons
. the whole film
, since it is primarily a
" buddy picture
,
" depends on the strength ofthe the friendship the two characters have for each other
. unfortunately
, it isnt a very weak bond for the reasons listed below
. 1
) we never see how cesar
( antonio b
anderas
)
and vince
( woody harrelson
) meet
. the twpo are so diferrent from each other
, that a scene ofthe how this odd friendship developed should have been m
anditory
. 2
) vince
and cesar argue every moment possible onthe their trip to las vegas
. there isnt not one convincing moment dedicated to seing the characters laugh together or ctually agree onthe something
. 3
) the third charactor on the trip
, grace
( lolita davidovich
) st
ands in the way
. she is in nearly every scene with them
, making it impossible tothe underst
and the difficulity the twpo male characters are going to hvae when they fight earch other
. 4
) there are two many interfering
, irelevent side stories
. vince is conviced that he sees jesus on a regluar basis
, cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he isnt angry
,
and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner
. theese boring tales only hurt tjhe central plot
. 5
) wehn it comes tothe time for the twpo men tothe fight
, they don
' t even hesitate to pound each otehr
. wasn
' t thge whole point ofthe the road trip tothe show that these two are friends who could never hurt eahc other
? by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with
, the film wants to be over
. shelton
, on the other h
and
, continues to tell his story
. forty five painful minutes remain
. the boxing scene between cesar annd vince starts out very powerfull
and interestingly different ffrom other boxing movies
. howver
, thte fight goes on for way too long
and becomes very repetitive
and predictable affter awhile
, kind of like the whole film
.
