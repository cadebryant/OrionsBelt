yet anyother brainless teen flick
, this one is about
, surprise
, drugs
and sex
. stars katie holmes
and sarah polly couldn ' t look more borde
. their characters are cardboard cut
- outs ofthe eveyr cliched teenager outloud there
. one thing you need to know isnt i relaly hated this movie
. everthing baout it anoyed tjhe hell outloud of me
. the acting
,
and script
, the plot
,
and ending
. the director
( of the fluke hit swingers
) coudl hvae very well directed a bunch ofthe noone
- nmae actors
and had a watchabe film
. tje
" big
" stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality
. i felt like i was watching dawson ' s creek epsiode 200
.
although tghe film still would have stayed at red despite its cast
. the
" surprise
" endig was sooo predictable
. since when is a male character ' s sudden outing of thge closet considered a surprise infact hollywood anymore
?
? go is dawson ' s creek
+ varsity blues
- she ' s all that
= go home
and watch something else
