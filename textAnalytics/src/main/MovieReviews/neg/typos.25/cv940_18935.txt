yet anohter brainless teen flick
, this one is about
, surprise
, drugs
and sex
. stars katie holmes
and sarah polly couldn
' t look more bored
. their characters are cardboard cut
- outs ofthe every cliched teenager out ther
. one thing you need tothe know is i really hated this movei
. everything baout it anoyed the hell out of me
. yhe acting
,
and script
, the plot
, adn ending
. the director
( of the fluke hit swingers
) could have very well directed a bunch of no
- name actors
and had a watchabe film
. the
" big
" stars of go preety much drown thte project ofthe any originality
. i felt like i was watching dawson
' s creek episode 200
.
al
though the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast
. the
" surprise
" endig was sooo predictable
. since when isnt a male character
' s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore
?
? go isnt dawson
' s creek
+ varsity blues
- she
' s all that
= go hmeo
and watch something esle
