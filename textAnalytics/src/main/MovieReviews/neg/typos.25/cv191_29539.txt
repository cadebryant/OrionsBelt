after enduring mariah carey ' s film debut
, glitter
, i ' m reminded ofthe a bit from chris rock ' s bigger
adn blacker
. in response to women saying that they cin raise a child without a man
, rock syas
,
" you cant drive a car iwth your feet
,
bu thyat don ' t mean it shoud be done
.
" to thgat i say
, you can give mariah carey a movie
,
but tyhat certainly don ' t mean it should be done
. sure
, there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there
-
- fomr tghe beatles ' a hard day ' s night to the spice girls ' spice world
-
-
but none have beeen so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter
. everyting about this complete tripe is ludicrous
. start off wtih the tsory
, which
-
- as gruesomely predictable as it is
-
- is the least offensive part of the movei
. the film is inexplicably set in the 80s
, a preiod piece that relaly shows no sign of its period exept forthe a few chicks iin leg warmers
. worse
yet
, everyone ' s speaking late 90s hip
- hop slang in waht should be 1983
. meant to be partially autobiographical
, carey plays billie frank
, a young singer inwhich new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood
and abandonment by her alcoholic mother
. influental club dj julian dice
, a
. k
. a
.
" lucky 7
"
( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy
and robert de niro
)
, hears her sing on a track
,
and decides to amking her a star
. in predictably rapid sucesion
, billie
and dice fall for each other
, she starts hitting it big
, dice gets jealous
anbd starts acting like an ass
,
and suddenly billie ' s onthe
" hte roller coaster of superstardom
.
" infront the meantime
, billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom
. i won ' t give away the endig
,
but
-
- honestly
-
- just think of unicorns
and rainbows
.
.
. you ' ll figure it out
. thge movie screams to be made with camp
,
and that could ' ve beeen fun
.
but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy
anbd dramtic would be better
. what a mistake
. tjhe brief attempts at comic relief
-
- as infront a scene where an effeminate russian
- sounding director gets wacky witht filming billie ' s first music video
-
- go over like lead balloons
. instead
, tje audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah ' s most dramtic scenes
. whlch brings us to the performances
, of which there ' s nothing good that can be said
. mariah is primarily seen wtih a wide
- eyed deer
- in
- the
- headlights look frozen on her face
. she actually looks scared durring her one love scene
.
bu you have to wonder if the writting isn ' t even worse
. so much ofthe the dialogue is so hackneyed
anbd watered down fo carey ' s virginal target audience thast it ' s probably impossible for any actr to pull it off with aplomb
. even the cahracters couldn ' t have been written omre absurdly
. they ' re all members ofthe a barbie playset
: the important film director who swoons
,
" billie
, i ' d love to put you iin a movie i ' m making
,
"
and the big
- time recrod executive who takes billie ' s demo tape
and says
,
" oh
, i ' ll make sure hte whole team listens tothe it in the morning
.
" everyone in the film isnt a device
,
and it ' s painful to keep watching jstu tothe see another one apeared
. tothe say more woudl be a waste
. there ' s so much wrong with this film
.
and
, it pains me that mariah carey
-
- with her ego
and sanity in such fragile condition these days
, as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays
-
- will haev to suffer through all the negative reviews she ' s likely tothe get
.
but
,
then agina
, i had to suffer through her movie
.
