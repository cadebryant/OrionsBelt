after enduring mariah carey
' s film de
but
, glitter
, i
' m reminded ofthe a bit from chris rock
' s bigger annd blacker
. in response tothe women saying that tehy can raise a child without a man
, rock says
,
" ytou can drive a car with your foots
,
but that don
' t mean it should be done
.
" tothe that i say
, ytou can give mariah carey a movei
,
but thgat certainly don
' t mean it should be done
. sure
, there are plenty ofthe pop star film vehicles outloud there
-
- from thge beatles
' a hard day
' s night tothe the spice girls
' spice world
-
- bu none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter
. everthing baout this complete tripe is ludicrous
. strat off with the story
, which
-
- as gruesomely predictable as it is
-
- is the least offensive part of the movei
. the film is inexplicably setted inwhich the 80s
, a preiod piece that really shows noone sign of its period except for a fewd chicks in leeg warmers
. worse
yet
, everyone
' s speaking late 90s hip
- hop slang inwhich whta shoud be 1983
. meant to be partially autobiographical
, carey plays billie frank
, a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood adn ab
andonment by her alcholic mother
. influencial club dj julian dice
, a
. k
. a
.
" lucky 7
"
( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy annd robert de niro
)
, hears her sing onthe a track
,
and decides tothe make her a star
. in predictably rapid succession
, billie
and dice fall for each other
, she starts hitting it big
, dice gets jealous
and starts acting like an ass
, anbd suddenly billie
' s onthe
" the roller coaster ofthe superstardom
.
" in yhe meantime
, billie isnt on an emotional hunt for her missing mom
. i won
' t give away the ending
,
but
-
- honestly
-
- jstu think ofthe unicorns anbd rainbows
.
.
. you
' ll figure it out
. the movei screams to be made with camp
, adn thyat could
' ve beeen fun
.
but tjhe filmmakers
thought making thge bulk of glitter weepy adn dramatic woudl be better
. what a mistake
. tje brief attemts at comic relief
-
- as in a scene where an effeminate russina
- sounding director gets wacky wih filming billie
' s frist music video
-
- go over liuke lead balloons
. instade
, hte audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah
' s most dramtic scenes
. whihc brings us to the performances
, of whihc there
' s nothing good that can be said
. mariah isnt primarily seen with a wide
- eyed deer
- in
- the
- headlights look frozen on her face
. she actually looks scared during her one loev scene
.
but you have to wonder if tyhe writting isn
' t even worse
. so much ofthe the dialogue is so hackneyed
and watered down for carey
' s virginal target audience taht it
' s probaly impossible for any actor to pul it off with aplomb
. even the charactors couldn
' t ahve been written more absurdly
. tehy
' re all members of a barbie playset
: tghe importan film directer who swoons
,
" billie
, i
' d love to put you inthe a movie i
' m making
,
"
and tyhe big
- time record executive who tkaes billie
' s demo tape
and says
,
" oh
, i
' ll make sure the whole team listens tothe it in the morning
.
" everyone inaddition the film isnt a divice
,
and it
' s painful to keep watching jstu tothe see another noe appear
. to sday more owudl be a waste
. there
' s so much wrong with this film
.
and
, it pains me that mariah carey
-
- with her ego anbd sanity inspite such fragile condition these days
, as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays
-
- will have to suffer through all the negitive reviews she
' s likely to get
.
but
, thne again
, i hadnt tothe suffer through her movie
.
