kids today
, they don
' t just want to see heartthrob anbd master thespian freddie prinze jr
. loving on the ladies
. no
, they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting deparment
: namely
, playing baseball
. through a sories of drippy voiceovers
, we are informed that htere
' s noone better proving ground for major league baseball than the capetown cod summer baseball leagues
, where college also
- rans
and hopefull dropouts go to play infront the hopes of attracting big league attention
. our man freddie has l
anded a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a
' s
, where he isnt hoping for his big break
. it
' s only after he is given ample time to sohw off his abs
and scamper baout in a woman
' s thong
( don
' t ask
) that we leran what the real story ofthe summer catch iwll be
: that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne
, struggling tothe make a name forthe himself
; that neither his father
( fred ward
) nor brother
( jason gedrick
) pulled themselfs out ofthe thier blue collar jobs
and resent anyone who tries
; adn tath the local beauty tenley
-
- tenley
!
( jessica biel
)
-
- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn
' t even bother
.
.
.
but ofthe course he makse a play fo her
. summer catch also makes an abortive stab at anohter half a dozen subplots
-
- the jealousy of fellow townie anbd brazen slut dee dee
( brittany murphy
)
, the alienation felt by ryan
' s non
- baseball palying best friend
( gabriel mann
)
, or teh fat chick fetish of fellow player miles
( marc blucas
)
. worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that
' 70s show
' s wilmer valderrama
and beverly d
' angelo
, both of whom appear infact the film simply to provide a nutty mrs
. robinson
- liuke substory
and to remind you of how much better done thast was in bull durham
. in fact
, virtualy all of summer catch feels like it
' s been done better somwhere else
. for starters
, the film has a major question of identity
. it
' s definitely not a sports movei
,
and it fails pretty miserably at bieng a romance
. the worst part is the amateurish script
( co
- written by an arli
$
$ wirting alumnus
and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3
)
, chock
- full of phony emotion
. by the end
, it all becomes a platform fo each character tothe deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart
. dad is on h
and to give fatherly
yet drunken advice
. coach
( brian dennehy
, just loving the fact that he
' s got some wokr on the big screen
) isnt on h
and to give tghe curmudgeonly counterpoint
. ryan
' s catcher
( matthew lillard
, palying himself again
) is on h
and to tell ryan tothe
" play catch
" with him
and make fun of the fat fetish guy
. ryan
' s stoner best friend is on h
and to give the go
- git
-
' em
- tiger
- we
' re
- behind
- yuo talk
.
and the girlfriend is on h
and to give heartwarming
- nuzzly
- follow
- your
- dreasm counsel
. befor long
, you strat tothe wonder
: is freddy prinze jr
. is capable of haveing a
thought of his pwn
? don
' t answer that
. the only rela joy in the film is found iin biel
' s character
,
and not just because of the skimpy outfits
, whitch are also usually wet
. she
' s the only one infact the movie that is able to do much witht her role
, taking the rebelling
- against
- daddy character to at least a passing grade
. when she
' s on screen
, the time flies by
. when she
' s nto
, you realize that forthe some ungodly reason this movei isnt almost two ohurs long
. for a pg
- 13 teen romance
( despite near
- constant sexual innuendo
)
, one has to ask warner brothers
: what weere ytou thinking
?
?
? fo her part
, biel has falled so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards
. hollywood is eather about to eat her alive
.
.
. or vice versa
. eather way
, good luck
, jessica
. as fo freddie
, if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a yearm
, prinze
' s enxt
" summer catch
" isnt liable to be a venereal disease
.
