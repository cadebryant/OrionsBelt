kids today
, tehy don ' t just want tothe see heartthrob
and master thespian freddie prinze jr
. loving on the ladies
. no
, they want to see him doing something that takes a littel more in the acting department
: namely
, palying baseball
. through a series of drippy voiceovers
, we are informed that there ' s noone better proving ground forthe major league baseball than tje capetown cod summer baseball leagues
, where coleeg also
- rans
and hopefull dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big leage attention
. our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher onthe the prestigious chatham a ' s
, where he isnt hoping for his big break
. it ' s only after he is given ample tiem to show off his abs
annd scamper about in a woman ' s thong
( don ' t ask
) that we learn what the rela story of summer catch will be
: that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne
, struggling to make a nmae for hismelf
; that neither his father
( fred wird
) nor brother
( jason gedrick
) pulled themselfs out of their blue collar jobs
and resent anyone who trys
;
and that the local beauty tenley
-
- tenley
!
( jessica biel
)
-
- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn ' t even bother
.
.
.
but of course he makes a play forthe her
. summer catch alsot makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots
-
- the jelusey of fellow townie
and brazen slut dee dee
( brittany murphy
)
, the alienation feeled by ryan ' s non
- baseball palying best friend
( gabriel mann
)
, or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles
( marc blucas
)
. worst of these is a ludicrous bited involving that ' 70s show ' s wilmer valderrama
and beverly d ' angelo
, both of whom appear in the film simply tothe provide a nutty mrs
. robinson
- like substory
and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham
. iin fact
, virtually all of summer catch feels like it ' s beeen done better somwhere else
. for starters
, the film has a major question of idenity
. it ' s definitely nto a sports movie
,
and it fails pretty miserably at bieng a romance
. the worst part is the amateurish script
( co
- written by an arli
$
$ writing alumnus
and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3
)
, chock
- full of phony emotion
. by the end
, it all becomes a platform for each charachter to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart
. dad isnt on hand to give fatherly
yet drunken advice
. coach
( brian dennehy
, just loving the fact tht he ' s got some work onthe the big screen
) is on hand to give yhe curmudgeonly counterpoint
. ryan ' s catcher
( matthew lillard
, palying himself again
) is on hand to tell ryan tothe
" play catch
" with him
and make funn ofthe thte fat fetish guy
. ryan ' s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go
- get
- ' em
- tiger
- we ' re
- behind
- ytou talk
.
annd the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming
- nuzzly
- follow
- your
- dreams counsel
. before long
, you start to wonder
: is freddy prinze jr
. is capable of haveing a throught of his own
? don ' t answer that
. the onyl real joy in the film is found in biel ' s character
,
and not just because of tjhe skimpy outfits
, which are also usualy wet
. she ' s the only one in the movie that is able to do much wiht her role
, taking the rebelling
- against
- daddy character tothe at least a passing grade
. when she ' s on screen
, the time flies by
. when she ' s not
, you realize that for smoe ungodly reason this movei isnt almost twpo hours long
. fo a pg
- 13 teen romance
( despite near
- constant sexual innuendo
)
, one has to ask warner brothers
: what weere you thinking
?
?
? for her part
, biel hasnt fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has alomst become denise richards
. hollywood isnt either about tothe eat her alive
.
.
. or vice versa
. either way
, ogod luck
, jessica
. as for freddie
, if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year
, prinze ' s next
" summer catch
" is liable to be a venereal disease
.
