it utilisied to be tath not just anyone coudl become a vampire
. usally
, you had to be an aristocrat
- a count such as dracula or karnstein
. to qualify
, you
' d have tothe have a modicum of sophistication
, so you
' d at least look cool
- or suave
- when biting inot smoe young damsel
' s throat
.
but today
, in our overly politically correct world
, any scuzzy
- looking
, long
- haired
, unshaven lout or any spiked
- haired harridans can put hte bite on ytou
. by the same token
, to be a vampire hunter
, one had to have some sort of medical training
and knowledge ofthe the occult or maybee perhaps be some sort of professional solider
, or at least one who retired whith honors
. not inwhich theese times
. all ytou need are some sharp weapons
, some bullets forged from silver
and any yahoo can be a buffy
- or a blade
. without sounding elitist
, the fear of vampires hasnt greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity
. which brings us to blade
, the latest inaddition a long line of vampire movies in which
, it seems
, half the population is puting the bite onthe hte otehr half
. nto onyl are htere thous
ands of vampires
,
but htey seem to move fomr city to city
, pay off police departments
and
, most importantly
, establish their own exclusive affter
- hurs raves in which the highlight is tje sprinkler system going off
and dousing all the occupants in a blood showfer
. with all that blood
, you wonder why they ahve to hunt for victims
. you allso wonder wehn they git the timne tothe get thier clothes dry
- cleaned adn why no cleaner ever complains baout all the bloodstains
. blade
, wich isnt based on a marvel comic book character
, isnt
, like a comic book
, all visual
. the plot isnt basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through tyhe vampire army seeking theri leader
, deacon frost
. it
' s all hokum
and nonsense
, of course
.
but the filmmakers play it straight
. unfortunately
, at least at the advance screening i attended
, the audience didn
' t see it that way
and laughed through much of the proceedings
. you know a movie isnt in trouble when the scenes ofthe blood
and gore that should elicit screams ofthe fright instead evoke peels of laughter
. another tell
- tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero
' s costume more than the hero
. also it seems it
' s not enough for today
' s vampire mearly tothe have fangs
. he must also be preficient in the martial arts
. why a supernatural being
, one of the undead
, needs such skills isnt beyond me
.
( of course
, this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films
- run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires
, in which dracula isnt defeated by seven karate
- chopping siblings
.
) wesley snipes is buff as blade
. he growls his lines
- the few he has
-
and spends most of the time glowering
- as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second
thoughts about starring in
and co
- producing this turey
. blade is just another example of how the vampire film
, a once honorable member of the horror familiy
, hasnt gone downhill
. this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stoped jstu by dangling a crucifix infront his face
. today
' s vampires lack the panache
, the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee
. they are nto even worthy enough to cary those graet bloodsuckers
' capes
. htey are more farcical tahn frightful
. this hwole enterprise is noe dull blade that could have utilisied lots ofthe sharpening
.
