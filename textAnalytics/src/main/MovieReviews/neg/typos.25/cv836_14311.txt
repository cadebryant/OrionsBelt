brian de palma
' s snake eyes stars nicolas cage
' s evil twin
, who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother
. like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english tothe ensure that he will be understood
, cage yells wih the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffiene overload
. de palma
, whose lastr great film
, the untouchables
, wass crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic
. in snake eyes
, he manages to elicit soem of tyhe worst performances possible out of a skilled cast
. only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material
. thte rest of the actors become caricatures in thsi by
- tghe
- numbers thriller
. ryuichi sakamoto
' s atmospheric
and melodramatic music dominates almsot every scene
. heavy on the long violin notes
, its rhythm is punctuated by thunder
.
( the script by de palma anbd lost world
' s david koepp sets the action during a hurricane iin an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level
and the noise
. only the latter isnt achieved
.
) cage plays rick santoro
, a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money
. the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held
. witht a flashy
, bad wardobe
and a gold cell phone
, rick isnt an obnoxious cop who doesn
' t konw when to shut up
. spouting cliched
and ridiculous dialog
, he screams such lines as
,
" i was made for tghe sewer
, baby
!
" actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a wohle
. sinise plays kevin dunne
, a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy
, who has come to watch the fight
.
but most peple in the film are not who they seem tothe be
,
and the thin script makes all of them eazy to guess
. thte plot
, hwihc isnt told inaddition endless flashbacks
, concerns the assassintation ofthe the secretary through a scheme set uv by soem malevolent businessmen
? that adjative is
, ofthe course
, redundent in hollywood thrillers
. tjhe flashbacks become repetitious iwth the same scene shown again
and again
, sometimes from a different perspective adn sometimes nto
.
al
though a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence
, htis one is remarkably tame forthe yhe man who became famouse when he made carrie
. the movie
' s outline has some promise
,
but tje movie itself is leaden
. the film takes itself all too seriously
. at best
, it is a 1940s
- sytle b movie
. a little humor would have helpped thte script some
,
but a complete rewrite owudl have been better
.
and
,
al
though i hate to sday it
, a different director would have been the biggest improvment
. snake eyes runs 1
: 39
. it is rated r for violentce
and would be acceptbale forthe teenagers
.
