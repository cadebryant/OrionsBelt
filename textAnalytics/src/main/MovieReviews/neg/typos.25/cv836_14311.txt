brian de palma ' s snake eyes stars nicolas cage ' s evil twin
, who confusingly uses hte smae stage name as his talented brother
. liek a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english tothe ensure taht he iwll be understoon
, cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffiene overload
. de palma
, whose lsat great film
, the untouchables
, was crafted over a decade ago seems to hvae lost his magic
. in snake eyes
, he manages to elicit some of thte worst performances possibile out ofthe a skilled cast
. only gary sinise rises slightly above tje hackneyed material
. the rest of tghe actors become caricatures in this by
- the
- numbers thriller
. ryuichi sakamoto ' s atmospheric
and melodramatic music dominates almsot eveyr scene
. hevy onthe the long violin notes
, its rhythm is punctuated by thunder
.
( the scirpt by de palma
and lost world ' s david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump uv the adrenaline level
adn the noise
. only the latter isnt achieved
.
) cage plays rick santoro
, a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money
. the movie takes palce over a single evening wehn a world championship fight is being held
. with a flashy
, bad wardrobe
and a gold cell phone
, rick isnt an obnoxious cop who doesn ' t know when to shut up
. spouting cliched
and rediculous dialouge
, he screams such lines as
,
" i was made fo hte sewer
, baby
!
" actulaly the line isnt more apropos for thge movie as a whole
. sinise plays kevin dunne
, a naval officer who isnt in charge of tghe security forthe the secretery ofthe the navy
, who has come to watch tghe fight
.
but most people in the film are not who they seem to be
,
and the thin script makes all of them eazy to guess
. tyhe plot
, hwihc is told inspite endless flashbacks
, concerns yhe assassintation of the secretary through a scheme setted up by smoe malevolent businessmen
? that adjective isnt
, of course
, redundant in hollywood thrillers
. the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown agian
and agian
, sometimes from a different perspective
anbd sometimes not
.
allthough a brian de palma film requires a certian amount of gratuitious violence
, this one is remarkably tame fo the man who became famous wehn he made carrie
. the movei ' s outline has soem promise
,
bu the movei itself isnt leaden
. teh film tkaes itself all too seriously
. at best
, it is a 1940s
- style b movie
. a little humor would have helpped thge scirpt smoe
,
but a complete rewrite would have beeen better
.
annd
,
although i hate to say it
, a different director owudl have been the biggest improvement
. snake eyes runs 1
: 39
. it is rated r for violence
and woudl be cceptable for teenagers
.
