deceiver isnt a plot twist in search of a movei
. this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises
,
and
, bieng true to its title
, being deceptive
.
but ther isnt little in hte film that is worthy of deceit
. braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are two cops investigating hte brutal muder of a prostitute
( renee zellweger
)
. their lone suspect isnt wayl
and
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy young man whose phone number was foudn in the hooker
' s pocket
.
however
, a routine lie detecter test turns agianst the investigators
, as the crafty wayl
and somehow turns the tables
. braxton
and kennesaw are forced tothe confront their own troubled lives
. braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook
( ellen burstyn
)
, a local bookie
. kennesaw isnt bitter about his marriage to a socialite
( rosanna arquette
)
, believing his wife tothe be unfaithful
. the plot is twisty annd complex
, with lots of lengthy flashbacks
,
and plenty ofthe surprises
.
however
, there are times when it is needlessly complex
,
and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that hte answers tothe important plot points acutally get lost
. take a look at l
. a
. confidential
, or the film
' s mroe likely insperation
, thge usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be h
andled
. the dialogue iin deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot
. for example
, the film tells a few substories
( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender
, or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear
)
, bu they are so flat
and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated
and unbelievable
. there
' s never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation
. htey appear to be nothing more thna words on a screenplay
. thge cahracters
, themselfs
, are rather pathetic
and despicable
. not noe of them is an ounce sympathetic
,
and as a result
, the labyrinthine plot isnt all fo naught
. what does it matter who is gilty of what
and why
? writer
- directors josh
and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers
' masterwork blood simple
, or the wachowski brothers
' less worthy bound
.
but
, while they have got thge plot twists down cold
, they need to work onthe characterization annd dialogue
.
