burnt money is the perfect festival film
. it will sohw once or twice
,
and
then no one
, thankfully
, will ever haev to hear from it again
. this film from the seattle international film festival 2001
' s emerging masters series isnt easily one of the year
' s worst
. billed as a gay
` bonnie
and clyde
'
, this gritty film from director marcelo pi
? eyro has its only highlight in a well
- designed title sequence
. twpo gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader
, whose plan tehy screwed up
, angry
. this causes the gang leader to send his boys outloud to git the gay guys
, oen of whom may not actually be gay
. hiding out in a prostitute
' s apartment
, the two men must fight off police anbd gang members in a vyer long showdown for teh movie
' s conclusion
. if caught
, they risk losing all the money
,
and their love
. as an added emotional bonus
, one of the gay men is dying
. or something like that
. everything that happens is so quick
and confusing i ws completelyl lost
. clarity isn
' t exactly thsi movie
' s striving virtue
, so it was a littel hard to pick uv
. not much could have really happened
though
. tje main events in this long twpo
- hour film are explicit homosexual anbd heterosexual sex
, graphic drug ule
, extreme violence
, anbd strong language
. lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when htere
' s a reason
,
but there
' s no purpose to anytying in this film
. most of hte sex
and violence scenes come off as silly
, while the heavy drug use comes off as rediculous adn depressing
. it appears pi
? eyro
( who co
- wrote wtih marcelo figueras
, fomr a novel by ricardo piglia
) purposefully adds moreso blood annd lovemaking fo his own amusement
. he makse the actors as sweaty
and dirty as possible
, makes them snort cocaine
, gives them guns
and condoms
,
and lets them go
. burnt money is pointless
. the performances are bad
. it tries tothe thrill
and shock
,
but only causes boredom
. god forbid it will ever get a distri
butor
. anohter disappointing film from this year
' s so
- called emerging masters sories
. pass on by
.
