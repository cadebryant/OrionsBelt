burnt money isnt the perfect festival film
. it will sohw once or twice
,
and
thn no oney
, thankfully
, iwll ever have to hear from it again
. tihs film from the seattle international film festival 2001 ' s emerging masters sories is easily oen ofthe tje year ' s worst
. billed as a gay
` bonnie
adn clyde '
, this gritty film from director marcelo pi
? eyro hasnt its only highlight in a well
- designed title sequence
. two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makse a gang leader
, whose plan they screwed up
, angry
. tihs causes the gang leader to send his boys out to git the gay guys
, one of whom may not actually be gay
. hiding out inthe a prostitute ' s apartment
, the twpo men must fight off police
anbd gang members in a vyer long showdown fo the movie ' s conclusion
. if caught
, they risk loseing all the mony
,
and thier love
. as an added emotional bonus
, noe of the gay men is dying
. or something liek that
. everything that happens is so quick
and confusing i was completely lost
. clarity isn ' t exactly this movie ' s striving virtue
, so it was a little hard to pick up
. not much could have really happened
though
. the main events in this long twpo
- hour film are explicit homosexual
and heterosexual sex
, graphic drug uise
, extreme violence
,
adn storng language
. lots of explicit material is never a bad thign when there ' s a reason
,
but ther ' s no purpose tothe anything in this film
. most of the sex
and violence scenes cmo off as silly
, while the heavy drug uise comes off as rediculous
and depressing
. it appears pi
? eyro
( who co
- wroet withthe marcelo figueras
, ffrom a novel by ricardo piglia
) purposefully adds mroe blood
and lovemaking for his own amusement
. he makes the actors as sweaty
and dirty as possibile
, makse them snort cocaine
, gives them guns
and condoms
,
and lets them go
. burnt mnoey is pointless
. tjhe performances are bad
. it tries to thrill
and shock
,
but only causes boredom
. god forebid it iwll ever get a distributor
. another disappointing film from this year ' s so
- called emerging masters series
. pass on by
.
