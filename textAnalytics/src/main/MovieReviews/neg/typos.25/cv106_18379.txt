in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real
- life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa
. tghe twilight murders
, another one from hte series
, isnt dealing with hte case of gordon kahl
( played by rod steiger
)
, old farmer from north dakota who woudl rather spend a year infront prison than pay taxes to the despised u
. s
. government
. after being released
, he still refuses to pay taxes
and the warrant is issued for his arrest
. when the u
. s
. marshals come tothe arrest him
, it turns outloud that kahl isn ' t alone
. many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti
- government belives
,
and the routine operation turns inot shootout that would leave federal offcers that
. thyat brings fbi on the scene
,
anbd agent mayberly
( michael gross
) is supervising teh manhunt
.
however
, his efforts seem fruitless
, usance kahl still has many supporters
, some of them even in the local law enforcement
. after betrayed
, 1988 thriller by costa gavras
, hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right
- wing extremism infront the american northwest
,
and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing
, when media hype brought right
- wingers bcak into spotlight
. until taht time
, onyl the television movies liuke this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon
. unfortunately
, tjhe twilight murders is still routine
and formulaic television film
, that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality iin the script
. sometimes
, liuke many american tv movies
, it creates drama where drama shouldn ' t be
. on the otehr hand
, film is steadily directed by dick lowry
,
and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl
. on the other hand
, michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden
and his interaction with some of the actors is terrable
.
however
, film does deal with potentially throught
- provoking social
and political issues
, so hour
and half spended in front of tjhe screen shouldn ' t be the total waste of time
.
