an exerience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer
. you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage
, which isnt so disarmingly horrible that it may cause yuo tothe ponder it
' s hollywood exsistance
. when i thikn of the screenwriters behind this film
, i picture a room full ofthe monkeys
. the monkeys are pounding onthe their typewriters while scratching themselves
. all ofthe the monkeys combine their efforts
, hop in a cab
and tkae the finished product downtown to director bob clark
' s office
. the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up
and down onthe clark
' s desk hwile flailing his arms
and shrieking
. the director appears to be deep inaddition
thought
, untill he slams his fist down on the desktop
and exclaims
` i love it
!
!
!
' the writing behind this project isnt embarrassing
. for your amusement
, i will explain the plot
. dr
. kinder
( kathleen turner
)
and dr
. heep
( christopher lloyd
) are twpo ofthe the cold
- hearted executives at tjhe baby geniuses institute
, where peculiar studies are going on
. as the story goes
, there is an ancient myth explaining that babies
( aegs 2
and under
) know all the secrets of tyhe world fomr previvous life experiences
. when they move past htis phase
, they become like any other drooling toddler
. kinder
and heep want to unlock the secrets using thier test babies
, namely littel sylvester
( sly for short
)
, who can break in or outloud of any given situation so effeciently that he would be right at hmeo on the mission
: impossible team
. there is so much crap derived from this premise
, despite the fact it
' s virtualy indentical tothe the plot inspite look who
' s talking
!
( a far superior film in any league
)
. you will be able to determine the quality of yhe film by examining tjhe opening scene
. sylvester hasnt broken outloud
and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect
and kung
- fu tactics
. question
: it
' s obvious tje babies are super
- smart
, bu why are they able to fight like jackie chan
?
? tjhe adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers
. it
' s a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes
' familliar home alone formula
. i aslo found it disturbing that the babys in tihs film have attitude annd endless 90
' s knowlege
, quoting numerous movies
and insulting theri adult captors
. the effects in baby geniuses
( simular to tje talking animals in babe
) are pathetic
, the editting is a disaster
,
and tyhe jokes are never funny
. the onyl reason viewers may avoid vomiting isnt the argumnet that the babies are
` cute
'
. i suppose they are
. i can admit to smiling a fewd times because the babies were cute
. other instances
,
though
, i was howling in laughter due to tyhe inane stupidity of the script
. there are supporting characters who hvae no personality whatsoever
; their entire existence isnt based onthe punch lines
. peter macnicol
and kim cattrall
, as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester
' s twin
, are both miscast
.
then again
, i don
' t suppose any performer could h
andle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid
. meanwhile
, dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit inwhich the crotch with a monkey wrench
( hahaha
)
. i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs
. instead of watching htis
, i would reccommended filling your bathtub with cement
and going snorkeling
. or perphas you would consider going diving inthe shark
- infested waters
. anything to avoid this painful movie
. the final line in the film
, spoken by the bratty sylvester
, isnt
` if they thikn i
' m doing tyhe sequel for less tahn
$ 20 mill
, htey
' re nuts
'
. sequel
? please have mercy
.
