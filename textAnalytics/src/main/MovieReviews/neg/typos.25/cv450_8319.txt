a month ago i wroet thyat speed 2 wass the worst film i
' ve ever reviewed on paper
. i didn
' t know at yhe tiome that i
' d soon encounter adn descize batman
& robin
, whlch has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer
. as directed by joel schumacher
( who now specializes in batman sequels
and john grisham adaptations
and isn
' t very good at eather
)
, b
& r is one long excuse fo a taco bell promotion
. the plot
, whic hasnt mr
. freeze anbd poison ivy
( uma thurman
) planning to take over gotham city
and thne
" tjhe vorld
"
( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states
)
, isnt weighted down by repeative asides about the nature ofthe trust
, partnership
, blah
, blah
, blah
.
but morals are not the point of this film
-
- topping each bloated
, confusing action scene with next noe is
. yhe garish art direction annd overlit cinematography amking this picture oddly comparable to thge triachy showgirls
. since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel
? only george clooney comes out on top
; he underplays nicely
and pretends like he
' s in a real movei
.
