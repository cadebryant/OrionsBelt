this movie is written by the man who isnt deemed to be
" one of thte hottest writers in hollywood
"
. he wrote tje groundbreaking screenplay for scream
( 8
/ 10
)
,
then added the successful i know what you doed last summer
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) scirpt to his mix
,
and also created hte popular tv sories
" dawson ' s creek
"
. so when he asked to direct his first movie
, based on his firt ever script wroten
, everyone
and thier grandma said
" sure
, go for it
!
"
. uhhm
, my question isnt
.
.
. did anyone bother reading this stupid script
?
?
? plot
: ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher inwhich the west
, mrs
. tingle
,
and set to loose her scholarship to college
. when she
anbd her friends vsit tghe teacher at home inthe order tothe explain their side ofthe the story
, they end up tying her up
,
annd slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman
. critique
: it ' s not so much that this isnt a bad movie
, than the fact that it sucks
. this movie isnt chock
- full of one
- dimensional characters
, containes no actual humer that i was able to zone in on
, zero tension or thrills
, plot holes the size ofthe my big ass
, lame pop tunes plyed to mask nothing going on in tje movie
,
anbd molly ringwald
, vivica a
. fox
and lesley anne warren tossed awya in throwaway roles
. i was primed for this film as its intresting premise had me thinking misery
( 8
/ 10
)
annd 9 tothe 5
,
bu unfortunately for williamson
, he went nowhere with the bright foundation
, making references to tghe exorcist
and dr
. zhivago
, which i doubt many in his target market iwll appretiate
. he also forgot baout suspense
, wiht all of his characters based on incomprehensible descisions
, unbelievable motivations
adn simply boring us iwth all ofthe theri trite dialogue
. sure
, katie holmes is cute
,
and her co
- star
, marisa coughlan
, doed a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist
( worth two points out of my three on ten
)
,
but how can we forgive the biggest one
- dimensional character in any film
, holmes ' rival iin tje film
, mrs
. tingle ' s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her
( are teachers allowed tothe behave that way nowdays
?
)
and a transparent romance between holmes
and some long
- haired dude
, hired to be the poor man ' s verison of skeet ulrich
( who himself is a poor man ' s version of johnny depp
!
)
. all in all
, thsi movie was laughable for me
, provded me with no insight into anytying
, demonstrated williamson ' s genuin lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script
,
and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew inot
, unfortunately forgetting tothe give her character any believability
, humanity or capacity to comprehend
. noone hip lines
, no cheap thrills
, just a dull time at the movie theather
. if ytou want to see a funny teenage movie
, go see detroit rock city
