thsi movie is written by the man who isnt deemed to be
" one of the hottest writers in hollywood
"
. he wroet the groundbreaking screenplay for scream
( 8
/ 10
)
,
then added the successful i know wqat you did lsat summer
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) scirpt to his mix
,
and also created thge popular tv series
" dawson
' s creek
"
. so whn he asked to direct his firt movie
, based on his first ever script written
, everyone adn their gr
andma said
" sure
, go for it
!
"
. uhhm
, my question isnt
.
.
. did anyone bother reading this stupid script
?
?
? plot
: ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west
, mrs
. tingle
, anbd set tothe loose her scholarship tothe college
. whn she
and her friends visti the teacher at hmeo in order to explane theri side ofthe tje story
, they end uv tying her uv
,
and slowly trying to talk smoe sense inot the hardheaded woman
. critique
: it
' s not so much that htis isnt a bad movie
, than the fact that it sucks
. this movie is chock
- full of one
- dimentional characters
, containes noone actual humer that i was able to zone in on
, zero tension or thrills
, plot holes thte size of my big ass
, lame pop tunes played to mask nothing goign on inwhich thte movie
,
and molly ringwald
, vivica a
. fox anbd lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles
. i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery
( 8
/ 10
)
and 9 to 5
,
but unfortunately for williamson
, he went nowhere with the bright foundation
, making references tothe the exorcist
and dr
. zhivago
, wich i dout many in his target market iwll appreciate
. he also forgot about suspense
, with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions
, unbelievable motivations
and simpley boring us withthe all ofthe their trite dialogue
. sure
, katie holmes is cute
,
and her co
- star
, marisa coughlan
, doed a reasonably amusing impression of thge exorcist
( worth two points outloud of my threee on ten
)
, bu how cxan we foregive the biggest oen
- dimensional character in any film
, holmes
' rival in tghe film
, mrs
. tingle
' s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others arround her
( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays
?
)
and a transparent romance between holmes
and some long
- haired dude
, hired to be the poor man
' s version of skeet ulrich
( who himself is a poor man
' s verzion of johnny depp
!
)
. all inaddition all
, this movie wass laughable for me
, provided me with noone insight into anytying
, demonstrated williamson
' s genuine lack ofthe directorial skills alongside a juvenile script
,
and provded helen mirren with a grat role to chew into
, unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability
, humanity or capacity to comprehend
. no hip lines
, no cheap thrills
, just a dull time at tghe movie theater
. if you want tothe see a funny teenage movie
, go see detroit rock city
