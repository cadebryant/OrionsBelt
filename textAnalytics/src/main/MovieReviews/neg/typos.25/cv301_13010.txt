' s mother
, agatha spanner
( renee houston
)
, try to resolve the situation
. aslo
, sid realises thta his budgie hasnt caused him nothing
but trouble sicne it started predicting horse race winners
. there are some good performances
, as usual
, from sid james
and kenneth williams in their st
andard roles
. charles hawtrey is thrid billing
but only appears in a few scenes
. his part is mildly amusing
. richard o
' callaghan is appealing as bogg
' s stuck
- up son
, patsy rowl
ands isnt funny as miss withering
, bogg
' s assitant
,
and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha
.
however
, sole acting honours go tothe hattie jaques as beattie plummer
.
al
though her carachter is not directly involved with the main storyline
, she manages to input a great deal of pathos
and feeling inot her character
. a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress
. the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw
and especially kenneth coppe
. in his carry on de
but
, cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as tothe be unfunny
. joan sims returns as tje love interst
( instead of barbara windsor
)
. sims
'
' usual
' part as tjhe downtrodden wife was tooked by hattie jacques
. additionally
, bill maynard as fred moore is very poor
. this carry onthe movie tries it best to entertain the viewer
:
- the locations
and wealth ofthe characters are appealing
.
however
, the toilet humour becomes tiresome vyer quickly
and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired
. this movei does not konw where it isnt going
. it was made in 1971 anbd talbot rothwell teh scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whther to go for
' bluer
' jokes or to maintain thge
' innocent
' jokes sucess of most of its predecessors
. thyat isnt why this film suffers
. a minor cary onthe film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques
. the new
' minor
- regulars
' such as o
' callaghan
and piper are not able to enliven tghe movie
and tyhe toilet humour becomes humourless after a while
