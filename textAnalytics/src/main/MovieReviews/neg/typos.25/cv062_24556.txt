there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs
. noe is letting an ambitious actor convert oney of his or her favorite novels into a feature film
. two isnt never greenlight a sci
- fi film starring john travolta
. tothe wit
, we preent the disaster that isnt battlefield earth
. a science
- fiction opus starring teh barbarino of the actors guild
, battlefield earth shoudl be shown only at maximum
- security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary forthe bad behavior
. sci
- fi is always a tricky biast
: tight script
, a ogod director
, an ensemble cast ofthe decent actors
, anbd the abillity to suspend even the most difficult ofthe disbeliefs
. battlefield earth fails at achieving even noe of these attri
butes
. here
' s the
` plot
.
' the year is 3000
. mankind has beeen become an endangered species thanks to tghe conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos
( sounds like either the latest clown act fomr cirque de soleil or a white rap group
)
. a small b
and of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies inthe fear ofthe the
` demons
' who dwell in tghe cities below
. the psychlos are strip
- mining the earth for its resources
and terel
, played by travolta
, is the head ofthe security for the minning
/ slave base located iin denver
. a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler
, played with dramatic flair by barry pepper
, ventures ffrom the safety of the caves into hte city to uncover the truth about tghe
` demons
.
' he is promptly capturd anbd taken to the alien base
. aftter sevral attempts at excape
, johnnie is placed in the middle of an underh
anded subplot of terel
' s
, involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end
. jonnie
, assumed leader ofthe the mining slave group
,
then manages to attain all psychlo
and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to ule
.
then the story just runs along untl jonnie teaches the rest of tje humans the basics of trigonometry
, the bill of rights
, how tothe use a machine gun
,
and how to fly a harrier jet
. the whole mess concludes with a big
, loud
, obnoxious gun
- adn
- plane battle that had me praying for the end credits
. roger christian
, tyhe directer of this lumbering beast
, must have rented dune
, blade runner
, planet of the apes
, independence day
, stargate
, beastmaster
, the airwolf episodes
, the
` v
' miniseries
, the matrix
, adn thte omega man
.
.
.
and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth
. christian even shoots eveyr scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for eveyr frame of the movie
!
and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe
-
- really
. the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players whith bad teeth
and bloated h
ands
and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit
. travolta
' s acting hasn
' t been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect
. jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace whith lines liuke
` you can have your freedom if ytou fight
!
'
then there
' s the script
: yhe film jstu never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight
and
` take back the planet
' would be a difficult task tothe achieve
. why
? because terel provides all the necessary tools tothe incite a revolt
-
- for noone particular reason beside the fact tht
` humans are stupid
.
' terel may be right
, you know
. humans made tihs movei
.
