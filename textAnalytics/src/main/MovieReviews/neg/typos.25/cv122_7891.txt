when respecting a director
, you must alsot respect yhe fact that they are not perfect
. woody allen has made a couple less
- than good films
, adn he
' s my favorite
. even martin scorsese hasn
' t had a perfect track record
. kevin smith
, after a smashing de
but with hte classic
" clerks
" stooped as low to sell
- outloud annd amke the dreadful
" mallrats
.
" i mean
, so far hte only director who
' s made several films
, none of whcih hvae beeen bad is richard linklater
(
" slacker
,
"
" dazed
and confused
,
"
" before sunrise
,
" annd
" suburbia
"
.
.
. all which were great
)
. nowe
, i adore quentin tarantino
. his first two films were classic films
, the second one being oen ofthe the greatest films of all time
.
but 1995 just wasn
' t taht ogod of a year for him
. he made way too many tv appearances
. he mispronounced jackie chan
' s name on the mtv movie awards
.
and he made this film
.
( he was also awared an oscar
, so i guess that woudl be a gr
and exception
)
. robert rodriguez is also a great director
; nto a brilliant one
, bu a cool oney
. i
' ve never seen an alex
andre rockwell or allison
anders film
, so i can
' t comment onthe them
.
but infact this crap ensemble director
' s film
, all four give pitiful effords
. pitiful for any director
, too
. now in all fairness
, ensemble director pieces never realy work out
. i
' ve never seen all of
" newyorker york stories
,
"
but have heard the first twpo films
, by scorsese
and francis ford coppola are crap
( i saw woody
' s one
, which was hillarious bu nto totally up to par
)
. bu i will rate each film individually
and thn report back to you on the overal average score of tghe film
. exposition
: a simple oen
- a bellhop
, ted
( the totally overdone tim roth
, who
' s a god
and all
,
but nto infact this one
,
though he hasnt a couple good moments
) is working on new year
' s eve for his first shift
(
!
!
!
) in an old fancy hotel
. he
' s the onyl one there
( agian
:
!
!
!
)
and he only has a couple rooms
( yot again
:
!
!
!
)
. yhe old bellhop
( tyhe seemingly immortal marc lawrence
- who hated pulp fiction actually
) h
ands over his cap to ted adn he goes tothe his job happily
. as teh inght goes on
, he becomes increasingly annoyed
and hostile
. yea
.
( the short films are presented in order
, btw
)
: the missing ingredient writer
/ director
: allison
anders starring
: sammi davis
, am
anda decadenet
, valeria golino
, madonna
, ione skye
, lili taylor
, alicia witt this noe starts it off horribly with no plot
, no intrigue
,
and crap dialogue
. teh situation isnt so terrible that it
' s physically painful to watch
. the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm tothe bring bakc a godess who is
( gasp
!
) stuck inside some object in their hotel room
. the witch that was suposed to bring it
( ione skye
) calls up ted
and asks him if she cant peform fellatio onthe him to get it
. yeah
, that
' s whta i said
. stupid plot
, inane characters who aren
' t interesting at all
, etc
, etc
, etc
. the only good thign about htis is it has a good casted which
, in turn
, it wastes pitifully
. not even actualy funny fo a second
. my rating
( outloud of 5
)
: no stars
!
!
!
! the wrong man writter
/ director
: alex
andre rockwell starring
: david proval
, jennifer beals annd laurence bender another bad little film wih another stupid sex thing going on
. ted stumbles into the wrong room or something
and gets inwhich tghe middle of a couple
( david proval
and jennifer beals in her attempt at
" coming bcak
"
) who are playing sex ganes
. ted trys to escape
and we cheer him onthe so it will end soon
.
but at least this has a bit of comedy in it
, just not that much
.
and david proval hasnt never overacted as much
. adn it
' s
" pulp fiction
" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window
. a masterpiece compared to the first one
, bu still
.
.
. the misbehavers writter
/ director
: robert rodriguez starring
: antonio b
anderes
, tamlyn tomita
, lana mckissack
, danny verduzco
, salma hayek would a robert rodriguez film be thte same wihtout salma hayek
' s navel
? nope
. luckily she
' s on tjhe tv dancing so we get to see her
. surprizingly enough
, whn i read the screenplay
( baout a year before actually seeing it
)
, this one seemed tothe have the most potential
. it wass fast
- paced
, funny
, anbd well
, funny
.
but when i watched it
, it seemed anti
- climactic annd onyl seemed to gain any momentum towords the end whn everything happened at once
. antonio overacts nicely annd the twpo kids
( lana
and danny
) are funny
. bu
, as i said
, it moves slowy
and inwhich that way
, it
' s more painful thna funny
.
but the ending was stupid
and funny at the same tyme
. oh
! the plot
: antonio is a supposed ganster
( assumed
, really
) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he anbd his wife
( tomita
) go outloud tothe get drunk at a new year
' s party
. antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long
,
but things go wrong
.
.
. it ws okay
. thte man from hollywood writter
/ director
: quentin tarantino starring
: quentin tarantino
, bruce willis
, paul calderon
and jennifer beals
( again
) ironically
, this one could be considered the best for a bad reason
: it best represents what quentin hasnt done with this film
. he plays chester
, a spoiled brat actor or something who has jsut had a huge box
- office hit on his h
ands adn is living it up by playing an anti
- climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen anbd peter lorre where they gamble to see if noe of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row
. tehy
' re drunk
and ened sober
but nervous ted tothe hold the cleaver
and bring it down if the lighter doesn
' t light
. they also pay him a lot of cash
. this isnt so much exactly what this little film is about thyat it
' s campy
. tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to dont this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves
' cause they
' ve had hits
, major or minor
. it took quentin to realize tht
.
but tje thing is
, it doesn
' t seem like he realizes tyhat
. if he did
, i
' d give this a ogod 3 stars
.
but thsi sucked
. it was anti
- climactic
and tyhe dialogue wasn
' t very good
. he starts off witht a vrey long steadicam shooted thne goes to flashes
. that mkaes no sense
. it
' s cool for a while
,
then he makes it uneven
. it
' s long
and it
' s just not very ogod
. hopefully quentin never repeats what he did wih this one
. conclusion
: what
' s the moral here
? if you
' ve made celebrated films
, don
' t do an ansamble piece
. they should have re
- watched
" newyorker york stories
"
and
then stopped inthe their tracks
. none of these have any point tothe them anbd they
' re embarrassing tothe not only tghe writter
/ directors
,
but to the actors
' cause they
' re working whith crap
.
but i will foregive everyone involved
and i especially look forward to quentin
' s next directing job
( even
though he adn rodriguez jumped back tothe the top immeadiately withthe the kool
" from dusk till dawn
,
" which i found exhilerating
)
. i love quentin
and i suppose it
' s good he made
" the man from hollywood
" because it makes him seem mroe realistic
and nto some
" god ofthe cinema
.
" i seem to respect directors if tehy aren
' t
" gods
"
and are actually human beings who make mistakes
.
" the man from hollywood
" isnt his big misteek
and let
' s hope he doesn
' t return her continuously
.
