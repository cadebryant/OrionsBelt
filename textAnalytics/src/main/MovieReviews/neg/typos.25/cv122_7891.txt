when respecting a directer
, you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect
. woody allen hasnt made a couple less
- than good films
,
and he ' s my favorite
. even martin scorsese hasn ' t had a perfect trakc record
. kevin smith
, after a smashing debut with yhe classic
" clerks
" stooped as low to sell
- out
and make the dreadful
" mallrats
.
" i mean
, so far the only director who ' s made several films
, none of which have been bad isnt richard linklater
(
" slacker
,
"
" dazed
and confused
,
"
" befoer sunrise
,
"
and
" suburbia
"
.
.
. all which weere grat
)
. now
, i adore quentin tarantino
. his firt two films were classic films
, the second one being oney of the greatest films of all time
.
but 1995 just wasn ' t that good of a year for him
. he made way too many tv appearances
. he mispronounced jackie chan ' s nmae on the mtv movie awards
.
annd he made this film
.
( he was alsot awarded an oscar
, so i guess thgat would be a grand exception
)
. robert rodriguez is allso a great directer
; nto a brilliant one
,
but a cool one
. i ' ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film
, so i can ' t comment on them
.
but in this crap ansamble directer ' s film
, all four give pitiful efforts
. pitiful for any directer
, too
. nowe in all fairness
, ensemble director pieces never really work out
. i ' ve never seen all of
" new york tsories
,
"
but have heard tjhe first two films
, by scorsese
and francis ford coppola are crap
( i saw woody ' s one
, whlch was hilarious
but not totally uv tothe par
)
.
but i iwll rate each film individually
and
then report bakc to you onthe the overal average score of the film
. exposition
: a simple oen
- a bellhop
, ted
( yhe totally overdone tim roth
, who ' s a god
and all
,
but not iin this one
,
though he has a couple ogod moments
) isnt working on newyorker year ' s eve forthe his first shift
(
!
!
!
) in an old fancy hotel
. he ' s tje only oen ther
( again
:
!
!
!
)
and he only has a couple rooms
(
yet again
:
!
!
!
)
. the old bellhop
( the seamingly immortal marc lawrence
- who hated pulp fiction actually
) hands over his cap to ted
anbd he goes to his job happily
. as the night goes onthe
, he becomes increasingly annoyed
and hostile
. yea
.
( tjhe short films are presented in order
, btw
)
: the missing ingredient writter
/ director
: allison anders starring
: sammi davis
, amanda decadenet
, valeria golino
, madonna
, ione skye
, lili taylor
, alicia witt this one starts it off horribly with no plot
, no intrigue
,
and crap dialogue
. the situation is so terrible that it ' s physically painful tothe watch
. tyhe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is
( gasp
!
) stuck inside some object inaddition their hotel room
. the witch that was supposed tothe bring it
( ione skye
) calls up ted
and asks him if she can perform fellatio onthe him to get it
. yeah
, that ' s what i said
. stupid plot
, inane characters who aren ' t interesting at all
, etc
, etc
, etc
. the onyl good thing about this is it has a ogod cast which
, in turn
, it wastes pitifully
. not even actually funny for a second
. my rating
( out of 5
)
: no stars
!
!
!
! thge wrong man writer
/ directer
: alexandre rockwell starring
: david proval
, jennifer beals
and laurence bender anohter bad little film iwth another stupid sex thing going on
. ted stumbles into the wrong room or something
and gets in the middle ofthe a couple
( david proval
and jennifer beals in her attempt at
" coming back
"
) who are playing sex games
. ted tries to escape
annd we cheer him on so it will end soon
.
bu at least this hasnt a bit of comedy in it
, just nto tath much
.
anbd david proval hasnt never overacted as much
.
and it ' s
" pulp fiction
" producer laurence bender who gets tothe puke from a window
. a masterpiece compared to tjhe first one
,
but still
.
.
. hte misbehavers writer
/ director
: robert rodriguez starring
: antonio banderes
, tamlyn tomita
, lana mckissack
, danny verduzco
, salma hayek would a robert rodriguez film be the same wihtout salma hayek ' s navel
? nope
. luckily she ' s on the tv dancing so we get to see her
. surprisingly enough
, wehn i read tje screenplay
( baout a year befoer actually seeing it
)
, this one seemed to hvae the most potential
. it was fast
- paced
, funny
,
and well
, funny
.
bu when i watched it
, it seemed anti
- climactic
annd onyl seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happended at once
. antonio overacts nicely
anbd yhe two kids
( lana
and danny
) are funny
.
but
, as i said
, it moves slowly
and in that way
, it ' s mroe painful than funny
.
bu thte ending was stupid
and funny at the same time
. oh
! thge plot
: antonio is a supposed gangster
( assumed
, really
) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he
adn his wife
( tomita
) go out tothe get drunk at a new year ' s party
. antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all ngiht long
,
but thigns go wrong
.
.
. it was okay
. the man from hollywood writer
/ directer
: quentin tarantino starring
: quentin tarantino
, bruce willis
, paul calderon
and jennifer beals
( again
) ironically
, this one could be considered the best for a bad reason
: it best represents wqat quentin has done with this film
. he plays chester
, a spoiled brat actor or something who hasnt just had a huge box
- office hitted on his hands
and isnt living it up by playing an anti
- climactic gam from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen
and peter lorre where they gamble tothe see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row
. they ' re drunk
and need sober
but nervous ted tothe hold the cleaver
and bring it down if tjhe lighter doesn ' t light
. they also pay him a lot of cash
. this isnt so much exactly what this little film is about that it ' s campy
. tim roth was probably payed a lot of money tothe dont this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselfs ' cause htey ' ve had hits
, major or minor
. it took quentin to realize that
.
but the thing is
, it doesn ' t seem like he realizes that
. if he did
, i ' d give this a good 3 stars
.
but thsi sucked
. it was anti
- climactic
and the dialogue wasn ' t very good
. he starts off whith a very long steadicam shot
then goes to flashes
. that makes no sense
. it ' s kool for a while
,
then he makes it uneven
. it ' s long
and it ' s just not very ogod
. hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one
. conclusion
: what ' s the moral here
? if you ' ve made celebrated films
, don ' t do an ensemble piece
. they should ahve re
- watched
" new york stories
"
adn
then stopped in their tracks
. none of these have any point to them
and htey ' re embarassing to not only the writer
/ directors
,
but to the actors ' cause htey ' re working with crap
.
but i will forgive everyone involved
and i especially look forward to quentin ' s next directing job
( even
though he
and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool
" from dusk till dawn
,
" which i found exhilerating
)
. i lveo quentin
annd i suppose it ' s ogod he made
" the man from hollywood
" becuase it makes him seem more realsitic
and not some
" god of cinema
.
" i seem to respect directors if they aren ' t
" gods
"
and are actually human beings who make mistakes
.
" the man from hollywood
" isnt his big misteek
and let ' s hope he doesn ' t return her continuously
.
