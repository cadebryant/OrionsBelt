" gia
"
, angelina jolie plays the titular charater
, the first so
- called supermodel
.
and right there you hve the biggest hurdle htis movie hadnt to overcome
( in my eyes
, anyway
)
. i just don ' t see how the life of a model isnt worthy of a two hour film
. despite this
, i kept an open mind when i began watching tghe movie
. sadly
,
though
, my fears were realized
. it ' s just not possible to amke an interesting
, full
- length film baout a person who spends thier days wearing different clothes
. the movie follows the rise
adn fall of gia
( no last name
)
, a tumultuous woman who doesn ' t particularly enjoy the world of fashion
. she becomes famoust more quickly than she cant handle
,
and finds herself hooked on drugs
and on a woman she cannot have
. yhe last hour ofthe the film is just noe scene aftter anohter of gia getting high
, losing a job
,
and going into rehab
. this formula is repeated severeal times
,
and i really got tired of it
. inaddition general
, i tend tothe dislike movies featuring heavy drug use
. no because it offends me or anything liuke thyat
; it jstu bores me
. quite frankly
, i don ' t see tje appeal
, so when a director shows me a point
- ofthe
- veiw shooted of a junkie
, complete witht tipsy camera angles
and echoing voices
, i am left somewhat unimpressed
. the frist hour of the film
,
though
, ws actually quite engaging
. we see gia as she is discovered
annd moves to new york with her boyfriend
. these easly scenes were intresting
. we ' re shown tjhe fashon world through a newcomers eyes
,
adn it was a perspective i hadn ' t seen before
. hte movie begins to go downhill
,
however
, once gia becomes an estalbished model
.
> from that point
, i lost all interest in tghe movei
and was counting the mintues before it would end
. it all seemed so eccessive
. fine
, so gia had a drug probelm
, does this really need tothe dominate the film
? couldn ' t the same effect hvae beeen hadnt with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs
? or perhaps this film is meant tothe be a warning to aspiring models not to git into the drug world
. quite possibly
,
althought since i have noone desire to become a modle
, this warning is lost on me
. as i stated at the beginning of this review
, i simply don ' t see how thte life of a model is worthy of a feature
- length motion picture
. what do they do thta warrants a movie
? strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour
? i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players
, for example
,
but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life
. gia did nto
.
and by the end of the film
, all i knew about gia fo sure was that she hated modelling
, was bi
- sexual
,
and was heavily into drugs
. not exactlly a meaningful contribution to society
, as far as i ' m conserned
.
