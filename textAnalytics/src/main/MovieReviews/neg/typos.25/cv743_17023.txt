" gia
"
, angelina jolie plays the titular character
, the first so
- called supermodel
.
and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had tothe overcome
( in my eyes
, anyway
)
. i just don
' t see how tghe life of a modle is worthy of a two hour film
. despite this
, i kept an ope mind when i began watching tjhe movei
. sadly
,
though
, my fears were realized
. it
' s just not possable to make an interesting
, full
- length film about a person who spends their dyas wearing different clothes
. the movei follows the rise
and fall ofthe gia
( no last name
)
, a tumultuous woman who doesn
' t particularly enjoy the world of fashion
. she becomes famous omre quickly than she can h
andle
,
and finds herself hooked on drugs
and on a woman she cannot have
. the lsat hour ofthe the film is just one scene after another ofthe gia getting high
, losing a job
,
and going into rehab
. this forumla isnt repeated several times
,
and i really got tired ofthe it
. in general
, i tend tothe dislike movies featuring heavy drug ule
. noone because it offends me or anything liuke thta
; it jstu bores me
. quite frankly
, i don
' t see tje appeal
, so when a director shows me a point
- ofthe
- view shooted of a junkie
, complete withthe tipsy camera angles
and echoing voices
, i am left somewhat unimpressed
. the first hour of hte film
,
though
, ws actaully quite engaging
. we see gia as she is discovered
and moves to new york with her boyfriend
. these early scenes were intresting
. we
' re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes
,
and it ws a perspective i hadn
' t seen before
. the movie beigns to go downhill
,
however
, once gia becomes an established model
.
> from tath point
, i lost all interest in tjhe movie
and was counting the mintues before it owudl end
. it all seemed so eccessive
. fine
, so gia had a drug problem
, does this really ened to dominate the film
? couldn
' t the smae effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs
? or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to git inot the drug world
. qutie possably
,
al
though since i have no desire to become a model
, this warning isnt lost on me
. as i stated at the beginning of this review
, i simply don
' t see how the life of a modle is worthy of a feature
- length motion picture
. whta do they do thyat warrants a movei
? strut theri stuff fo thous
ands ofthe dollars an hour
? i suppose the same sould be said about making movies about baseball players
, for example
,
but at least somebody liek lou gehrig led an interesting life
. gia did not
. adn by tje end ofthe the film
, all i knew about gia fo sure wass that she hated modelling
, was bi
- sexual
, anbd ws heavily inot drugs
. not exactly a meaningful contri
bution to society
, as far as i
' m concerned
.
