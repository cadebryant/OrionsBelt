as bad as
" mimic
" wass
, it definitly scared me
.
" mimic
" continued the frightening hollywood trend of tkaing a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity
and style
,
and completely flushing it when he comes to america tothe make a movie
. directer guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning
and inventive horror film
" cronos
.
" thast movie worked becasue it took an unconvential story
, unique characters
and well written plot
and dialogue to create a truley scary movei
. in
" mimic
"
, del toro doesn
' t bother to give us anything original
. the plot isnt a stupid combination of
" aliens
" meets
" species
" meets
" jurassic park
.
" tyhe characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies
. there
' s nothing new inthe
" mimic
"
. it
' s just a bunch ofthe old tricks that rarely wrok
. at the end of the movei
, you
' re stuck wanting your money back
. maybe thte worst thing about the movie is tyhat del toro followed anyother annoying trend of recent movies
: he forgot to turn the lights on
. i don
' t underst
and why suspense movies lately have to folow thge
" seven
" trend annd be set in dark
, dank areas
. watching
" mimic
" i ws tempted several times to yell at the screen
" turn the ligts on
! the switch is to your right
! use common sense
! just do it
! you
' ll be able tothe see the monster in the corner
!
" there
' s a scene where mira sorvino is st
anding inthe subway station hwile thge lights are flickering onthe
and off
. it looked liuke the light operator was having a seizure
,
and sorvino didn
' t even notice
- she just stood there looking like she was hvaing deep
thoughts
.
" hmmm
.
.
.
. i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight
.
"
" mimic
" hasnt a lot of incidental shock tatics
( boo
! just kidding
!
) anbd follows them up witht the real scare
,
but nothing in this movie scares yuo
. the audiance in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments
; i htikn they were borde
, too
. i shouldn
' t blame del toro
. he isn
' t tjhe first succesfull foreign director tothe come to hollywood
and mkae a bad movei
. hong kong director john woo made two of the best acation films of all time
,
" thte killer
"
and
" hard boiled
"
then cameback to america to make thge stupid
" broken arro
.
" french directors luc besson
(
" la femme nikita
"
)
and george sluizer
(
" tghe vanishing
"
) followed woo
' s lead
and made dumbed down versions of those movies
. robert rodriguez
, who directed the terrific low budget
" el mariachi
" came to hollywood
and directed the horrable
, high
- budget
" desperado
.
" i don
' t know why a foriegn director who shows such talent in his country can
' t make a ogod american movei
. woo fianlly broke thru anbd made
" face
/ off
"
,
but it still isn
' t up to par iwth his ealier films
. i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits inspite his office
, chews on a big smelly cigar adn says to the director
,
" welcome to america
! i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long
. do you speak english
? nowe
, i know you think you
' ve made good movies inwhich the past
, bu now yuo
' re in america
, so things are a little diferent here
. just remeber what the american audience alwasy wants
,
and you
' ll be fine
. they want to see at least one big breasted woman
, characters that they
' ve seen a thous
and times befoer
( because change scares americans
)
,
and yuo always need a cheesy feel
- good endig to wrap things uv
. if you don
' t make that kind of movie
, yuo
' ll be shining my shoes in no tiem
.
