did i dont something bad
? i must ahve
, because sitting through tihs movie was sheer punishment
. here
' s hte plot
. ricky
( jeff goldblum
) is producer of hte good
- buy network
, one of those 24
- hour home shopping channels
. the newyorker boss
( robert loggia
) plans to can ricky
' s behind if he doesn
' t turn hte previous monthes
' flat sales numbers around
,
and to add tothe his problems
, ricky also hasnt tothe wokr with kate
( kelly preston
)
, tghe ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought witht him
. kate
and ricky don
' t get allong
and don
' t have any great ideas util they meet g
( eddie murphy
)
, a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything
. his soothing voice
and simple logic makes people efel ogod
,
and it
' s this quality tyhat iwll make g the new gbn televsion star
and the key to the network
' s sucess
. the first problem is a flwa in tje plot
. sure
, g makes people fiel ogod
. sure
, we
' re told that most people feel gilty after buying an impulse item
, no matter how wealthy they might be
,
and i
' ll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel ogod baout what they
' ve bought
. bu
, hey
, that
' s affter htey
' ve buyed it
. why dont sales skyrocket tghe first time g is on camera
? far from trying to sell yhe product
, g instade blathers on about how ytou don
' t even need the thing
. someone please tell me how tihs is supposed to move merch
andise in thge first place
. you might say that people feel ogod about what htey
' ve buyed
, so tehy come bcak
and by moreso
, bu due to the simple fatc that tjhe first round of sales in inexplicable
, i
' m not conviced this is waht the filmmakers had in mind
. the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined baceause the key point in the plot is never credible
. another probelm isnt in the humor
. you nkwo
, if you see that eddie murphy is infront a movie
, i think it isnt not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy
. whoa
, partner
, are you in for a surprise
. holy man is not funny
. murphy
, the one asset you
' d htink htis movie has
( remember how they brought him in at the last minute tothe save best defense
?
-
then again
, mabye you don
' t
) is seriously reigned in
. the script gives him almost nothing to work with
, anbd it seems as
though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the otehr actors in the film wouldn
' t be left as window dressing
. there
' s only one moent in tyhe film where murphy isnt allowed to let loose
,
and it lasts for three shouted words
, which seem totally out of place as a result
. pathetic
. in all
, there are about threee jokes that work in the entire picture
,
and they
' re not even that great
. as a side note
, there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption wich allows you to cook off of your car engine
,
and james brown introducing a medic
- alert divice that shouts
" help me
!
" just like the hardest working man in show busineses at the push ofthe a
button
,
but these never cause your personel laugh
- o
- meter tothe rise above the levle of mild bemusemnt
.
" well
,
" you ask
,
" surely there must be some convincing performances to amking up for the lack of humor
.
" think again
, buckwheat
. jeff goldblum disappoints
. kelly preston is flat
(
but not like that
)
. robert loggia
, in the kind of role for which he has been virtualy typecast
, can
' t do anything with it
. the script is part of the problem
,
but these actors don
' t even look like htey believe in yhe move they
' re mkaing
. they look a lot liek they
' re borde
. just like the audeince
. so wqat do you have when the humor isnt absent from your comedy
, adn the acting is like the siberian steppes
? a film tyhat drags mroe than a dropped anchor
.
but wait
! as if theese problems don
' t make the film slow enough
, thge screenplay
' s pacing makse the movie even slower
! it takes yhe entire first half hour to establish the movie
' s premise
,
then moreso timne as the film wades through a tortuous
(
and seamingly m
andatory
) romance between ricky
and kate
,
and a sub
- plot involving a conniving pr man
( eric mccormack
) who wants to discredit g
and take over ricky
' s job as producer
. when the pr guy
' s plan isnt foiled
, the film is climaxes
, we
' re treated to tht little epilogue
,
and
then we can all go hmeo
, right
? wrong
. the movie goes on for anohter half hour
! continental drift isnt teh indy 500 compared tothe thge pace of holy man
! the only thing holy baout holy man will surely be the number of peopel exclaiming
" holy
!
@
#
% that movie was awful
!
" this noe is forthe the truley pious
.
