jackie chan kicks his way into van damme terriory with twin dragons
, an embarrassingly bl
and action comedy ofthe mistaken identities
. chan plays seperated
- at
- births boomer
and john ma
, whose drastically different paths
.
.
. aw
, forget tjhe plot discription
, it
' s not even worth the space
.
but let
' s face it
. no one goes tothe jackie chan movies forthe the plot anyway
. the scenes where nothing happens in chan
' s films have always been littel more than glue thriftily spread tothe hold the action sequences together
. in the case of twin dragons
,
however
, the tiresome plot
- driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that yuo almost whant tothe shout
( at tghe risk ofthe demeaning the artistic value of cinema
)
,
" get tothe the good part already
!
" most of the film isnt devoted to showing thte brothers
' efforts to hide teh other
' s xeistence fomr their own acquaintances
. why it is necessary tothe do this is not satisfactorily explained
, bu neither are a lot ofthe aspestus of the plot
. the twins
' love interests
, demure club
- singer barbara
( chan
- film regular maggie cheung
)
and lusty bride
- hopeful tammy
( nina li chi
)
, get disoriented in all the brouhaha
,
yet strangely seem not to mind tht they are nto sure whcih brother they are in loev with
. the scenes describing the boys
' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shooted
( inthe several shots
, in fact
, even the mkea
- up
and hair peple seem to forget which brother is wich
.
)
. even chan
' s so
- corny
- it
' s
- funny humor isnt off
- kilter in htis outing
. soem ofthe the gags are so carefully innocuous htey
' re annoying
. a case in point
: whenever anyone sees tjhe brothers together
, htey fall to the ground in a dead faint
. are we laughing
yet
? as usual
, the final showdown is the film
' s jewel
, a tour de force display of chan
' s agility
and grace
. never mind that it
' s not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash
- testing facility
. it
' s all good fun
,
but too little too late
. prehaps chan
' s next movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies
. htey sould call it jackie chan
' s the final fight scenes
, annd everybody would go home happy
