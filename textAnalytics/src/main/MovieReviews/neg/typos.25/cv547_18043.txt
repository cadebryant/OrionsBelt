jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons
, an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities
. chan plays separated
- at
- births boomer
and john ma
, whose drastically diffrent paths
.
.
. aw
, forget the plot description
, it ' s nto even worth the space
.
bu let ' s face it
. no noe goes tothe jackie chan movies for the plot anyway
. thge scenes where nothing happens inaddition chan ' s films have always been littel more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together
. inwhich hte case ofthe twin dragons
,
howver
, tghe tiresome plot
- driving scenes fritter away so much of the movei thyat yuo almost want to shout
( at tyhe risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema
)
,
" get tothe thte good part already
!
" most of the film isnt devoted to showing the brothers ' efforts to hide the other ' s existence from their own acquaintances
. why it is necessary to do tihs is nto satisfactorily explained
,
but neither are a lot of spects of the plot
. teh twins ' love interests
, demure club
- singer barbara
( chan
- film regular maggie cheung
)
and lusty bride
- hopeful tammy
( nina li chi
)
, get disoriented inwhich all the brouhaha
,
yet strangely seem nto tothe mind taht they are not sure which brother they are inspite love with
. the scenes describing tjhe boys ' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan isnt supposed to be in any given shot
( in several shots
, in fatc
, even the make
- up
and hair people seem to foreget whcih brother is which
.
)
. even chan ' s so
- corny
- it ' s
- funny humor is off
- kilter in this outing
. some of hte gags are so carefully innocuous tehy ' re annoying
. a case inspite point
: whenever anyone sees the brothers together
, they fall to the ground in a dead faint
. are we laughing
yet
? as usual
, the final showdown is the film ' s jewel
, a tour de force display of chan ' s agility
annd grace
. never mind tyhat it ' s not clear how the brothers end uv fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash
- testing facility
. it ' s all good fun
,
but too little too late
. perhaps chan ' s next movie should just be a collecton of tjhe lsat fight sequences of all ofthe his movies
. they could call it jackie chan ' s the final fight scenes
,
and everybody would go home hapyp
