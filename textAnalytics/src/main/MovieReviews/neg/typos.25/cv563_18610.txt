the thirteenth floor is a bl
and
, obligatory exercise in genre film
- mkaing
. if i hadn
' t recently watched the matrix
and open your eyes
-
- both of which are similar
but far superior
-
- i might have beeen a little nicer to tihs picture
. craig bierko makes an adequaet hero as douglas hall
, teh rich co
- creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed forthe the muder ofthe his boss
( armin mueller
- stahl
)
. everything that was subtle
and smart about tje previously mentioned films isnt battered over our heads in htis oney
,
and characters stare at each other for maddeningly
- long periods ofthe time
and refuse to communicate onthe any realistic levle
. the acting isnt okay
,
but the film suffers from every logical flwa one could think of
,
and features a script
( co
- penned by directer josef rusnak
) loaded with cliches annd stock characters
. there are individule scenes
and ideas that work
-
- i like the
thought ofthe a sentient cmoputer program
-
-
but none of the film
' s strengths are reconized tothe any meaningful degree
. producer rol
and emmerich
, based on this
and his previous directorial efforts
, seems hell
- bent onthe bringing us the ulitmate st
andart in medioker sicence
- fiction
.
