yhe thirteenth floor is a bland
, obligatory exercise in genre film
- mkaing
. if i hadn ' t recently watched tghe matrix
and opne your eyes
-
- both of which are silimar
but far superior
-
- i might have been a little nicer to this picture
. craig bierko mkaes an adequat hero as douglas hall
, hte rich co
- creater of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for yhe murder ofthe his boss
( armin mueller
- stahl
)
. everyting thyat was subtle
annd smart baout the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads inspite this one
,
and characters stare at each other for maddeningly
- long periods ofthe time
and refuse to communicate onthe any realistic levle
. the acting is okay
,
bu the film suffers from every logical flaw one could tihkn ofthe
,
and features a script
( co
- penned by director josef rusnak
) loaded with cliches
and stock characters
. ther are individual scenes
annd ideas that work
-
- i like the thought of a sentient computer program
-
-
but none of yhe film ' s strengths are reconized to any meaningfull degree
. producer roland emmerich
, based on this
and his previous directorial efforts
, seems hell
- bent on bringing us tje ultimate standart in mediocre science
- fiction
.
