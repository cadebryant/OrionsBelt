jet li busted onto yhe american action movie scene
, wehn he stoled tje show in 1998
' s lethal weppon 4
, with his wicked looks
, his nasty moves
and his undeniable charisma
. it only took anohter twpo years for mega
- producer joel silver to set him up iin an all
- american movie
, primed to take over some ofthe the empty acation
- hero seats left by alleged coke
- head van damme
and that pudgy guy named steven seagal
. would tihs film take li past his rival asian action counterparts
, namely chow yun
- fat
and jackie chan
? let
' s find outloud
. plot
: rival chineese
and black gangster organizations fall furuther outloud ofthe favor from one anohter
, when members of thier respective familys strat turning uv dead
. that
' s wehn badass jet li blasts into the picture to fidn out who the men were behind his brother
' s death
and to exact soem ofthe his own style of revenge
. critique
: three words
: nto enough action
! simple enought
? not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay
, bad actors
, crappy dialogue
and oh
- so many over
- the
- top melodramatic moments
.
and a romance angle
? why
, one must ask
.
.
. why
? i love fight scenes
and i raelly dig jet li too
, bu this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences
, anbd jet
, well
, the poor dude was barely inwhich the movie
.
and i thougth this was supposed to be his big break
? how
' bout giving the slickster some more opportunities tothe show us his kung
- fu fighting chops
, slap him in a faw more scenes
,
and give him omre chances to pratice his acting
/ english abilities
? whta a letdown
. even black mask was moreso entertaining than thsi glossed uv
, empty shell of a film
. in fact
, i am sure tht more time ws spent gathering the
" hits
" for teh sountrack of this film
, than were on the so
- called
" screenplay
"
. i felt liuke i ws watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of yhe time
. the sad part baout tje bad script is that it wouldn
' t matter so much if the film ctually had soem decent actors spouting outloud thge tacky lines
.
but no
, save lindo anbd aaliyah
, who weren
' t too shabby
, i
thought the rest of tje cast was picked primarly fomr their inability to deliver lines convincingly
.
and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deel run by some 15
- year old looking guy
, acting like he
' s the overlord of a drug ring
?
! what a mess
. hten again
, i don
' t watn it to seem like i
' m complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable
, since we all go to see theese movies fo teh acation anyway
, not the story
. well
, i guess that
' s whta disappointed me the most out of this film
. htere weere a cuple of kool fight scenes iwth li
, bu simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving
. also
, as much as i love the way they incorporate wires adn spacial effects inwhich some of thier stunts
, a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt
. it should be seamless
, fellas
, not neccessarily against the laws ofthe gravity
! yhe one cool thing that was originnal inthe the movie ws the way in which yhe director showed us some of tjhe inside cracklings of tjhe human body when penetrated by a blow
,
but tht simple creative touch couldn
' t savve the rest of tihs film
' s uninteresting plot movements
. i
' m disappointed forthe jet li thast tihs film didn
' t give him the real opportunity to star infront a good story with many gerat action scenes
. hopefully
, the next time wiull be a charm for htis charismatic actor
. forthe now
, i jstu hope that for his sake
, the film
' s title isn
' t a premonition of the movie
' s ultimate fate at thte box
- office
.
