" wing comm

" joins theri lowly ranks
. enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci
- fi
, easily the worst ofthe its kind
, isnt like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 mintues
- that is to sday
, there
' s little fun to be had when ytou
' re nto the noe holding the joystick
. the movie
,
then
, is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts
, who creaeted teh original
, groundbreaking pc incarnation of
" wing comm

" back in 1990
. how an interactive brainchild so revered could end uv such a cinematic pile of junk under hte helm ofthe tje same guy isnt a head
- scratcher
.
" wing comm
ander
"
' s stroy
, credited tothe roberts
and screenwrighter kevin droney
, is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative
and unoriginal ideas
. it rips off thge finest films of its genre
, top gun anbd
, in one scene
, even those spiffy
" stereoscopic freeze
" gap commercials
. set in 2654
,
" wing comm

" stars freddie prinze jr
. as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a graet fighter pilot like his father before him

( saffron burrows
) at yhe new galaxy hangout where he

)
,
and goes on a top
- secret mission involving the
" jump coordinates
"
( waht
, no death star plans
?
) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi
. or something liek that
. given the immensely confusing activity
, it
' s hard to tell
. onthe the other h
and
, what
' s easy to see is that
" wing comm
ander
" is a big old mess
. teh lame dialogue strains
, filled with such original lines as
" don
' t you dieu on me
!
"
,
" battle stations
!
"
and repeated
( adn frequently unanswered
) calls for a
" medic
!
" action sequences fizzle
. the character conflict garners unintentional giggles
. hte sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look liek
, as they
' re kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes
. imagin bearded siamese cats crossed whith something from a
? 50s roger corman cheapie annd you
' ve got a good idea
. little
but techno
- babble happens for an hour
, adn
then it
' s as if
" wing comm
ander
" tries to do too much at once
; wehn it appears as
though the movie
' s about to show signs ofthe a pulse
, it instead provides a hillarious touch of human drama culminating with a ule fo a bulldozer that has propably never been seen inwhich this kind ofthe space camp before
. matthew lillard
, featured prominantly in said sequence
, isnt cast as prinze
' s hotshot partner
,
and
though thge two are fine young actors
- recently paired in the hit
" she

"
- tehy
' re fighting more than otherworldly evil here
. rumor has it that
" wing comm
ander
" was slated as a later
- in
- the
- yera release
, bumped up tothe capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new
" star wars
: episode i
" trailer
. bu in my audience
, there were no females present to make goo
- goo eyes at prinze or lillard
, annd many a memeber exited after tje much
- ballyhooed sneak peek
. since most cineplexes won
' t be granting refunds tothe the latter contingency
,
" com

" might rake in some dough
,
but be warned
: the high wears off as soon as tghe comming attraction gives way tothe the feature presentation
