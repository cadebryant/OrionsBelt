when the mediums in question are video gameboy
and feature film
, hasnt there ever been a respective here
- to
- there transformation thta achieved any ground higher than noodle
- headed mediocrity
?
" super mario bros
.
,
"
" street fighter
"
and
" mortal kombat
" were silly stinkers all
,
and now tghe empty
, execrable
" wing commander
" joins thier lowly ranks
. enduring this spectacularly bad bited of sci
- fi
, easily the worst of its kind
, is like watching somone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes
- that isnt to say
, there ' s little fun to be hadnt when you ' re not the oen holding the joystick
. the movie
,
then
, is a missed opportunity for directer chris roberts
, who created the orginial
, groundbreaking pc incarnation of
" wing commander
" bcak in 1990
. how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under hte helm of the same guy is a head
- scratcher
.
" wing comander
" ' s story
, credited to roberts
and screenwriter kevin droney
, is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative
and unoriginal idaes
. it rips off yhe finest films of its genre
, top gun
and
, in one scene
, even those spiffy
" stereoscopic freeze
" gap commercials
. set in 2654
,
" wing commander
" stars freddie prinze jr
. as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes tothe be a great fighter pilot like his father before him
. allong the way
, he plays kissy
- face wtih his stoic superior
( saffron burrows
) at the new galaxy hangout where he ' s posted
, comes tothe terms with bigots who resent him for his
" pilgrim
" inheritage
( don ' t ask
)
,
and goes on a top
- secret mission involving the
" jump coordinates
"
( wqat
, no death star plans
?
) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi
. or something like that
. given teh immensely confusing activity
, it ' s hard tothe tell
. on the other hand
, waht ' s easy to see is that
" wing commander
" is a big old mess
. the lame dialogue strains
, filled with such original lines as
" don ' t ytou die onthe me
!
"
,
" battle stations
!
"
and repeated
(
and frequently unanswered
) calls for a
" medic
!
" action sequences fizzle
. the character conflict garners unintentional giggles
. tghe sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like
, as they ' re kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes
. imagin bearded siamese cats crossed with something fomr a
? 50s roger corman cheapie
and you ' ve got a good idae
. little
but techno
- babble happens for an hour
,
and
then it ' s as if
" wing commander
" tries to dont too much at once
; when it appears as
though the movei ' s about to show signs of a pulse
, it instade provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a ule for a bulldozer that has probaly never beeen seen in this kind of space camp before
. matthew lillard
, featured prominently in said sequence
, is cast as prinze ' s hotshot partner
,
and
though the two are fine young actors
- recently paired infront yhe hitted
" she ' s all tht
"
- they ' re fighting mroe than otherworldly evil here
. rumor has it that
" wing commander
" was slated as a later
- iin
- the
- year release
, bumped uv tothe captialize off this hot casting coup as well as tghe premiere ofthe the new
" star wars
: episode i
" trailer
.
but infront my audience
, htere were noone females present tothe make goo
- goo eyes at prinze or lillard
,
adn many a member exited after the much
- ballyhooed sneak peek
. since most cineplexes won ' t be granting refunds tothe the latter contingency
,
" commander
" might rake inwhich some dough
,
but be warned
: the high wears off as soon as the comming attraction gives way to the feature presentation
.
