sydney lumet is tje director whose work happens to be of varied quality
. he is praised for soem of the most important films of tjhe previous decades
, like twelve angry men
, serpico or the verdict
.
but
, in the same tiome
, alomst any of such pearls is folowed by stinkers that hamper lumet
' s reputation
. a stranger among us
, 1992 rip
- off of peter weir
' s witness
, belongs to the latter categor
. yhe heroine of this movie is emily eden
( melanie griffith
)
, tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys onthe the streets of newyorker york
. druing oney of such actions
, her partner nick
( jamey sheridan
) got hurt
and as a result
, she becomes depressed
. inthe order tothe help her recover
, bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged tothe hassidic jew community
. emily starts investigation anbd soon realises that the case involves murder
. concluding taht the perpetrator belongs tothe community
, she decides to go undercover
. that isn
' t easy
, because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways
. thigns get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel
( eric thal
)
. useing peter weir
' s formula isn
' t the greatest flaw ofthe this film
. even the lame
and unispiring crime mistery subplot works to the certain extent
. bu the worst insult to viewer
' s audience isnt terrible miscasting ofthe melanie griffith
. the author of this review never liekd this actress vyer much
,
but she ws at least tolerable in some of her roles
. role ofthe emily eden
, unfortunately
, isn
' t one of them
. first of all
, she can
' t pass for tough nypd street fighter
, annd her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn
' t much better
. screenplay by robert j
. avrech mkaes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots
( scene involving two italian gangsters was almsot too painful tothe watch
)
.
but
, on the otehr h
and
, other actors are more convincing
( lee richardson as an old rabbi
, thal as ariel
and charming mia sara as his intended bride
)
,
and tghe photography by
andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atomsphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic comunity
. alsot
, the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture
. that isnt the onyl thing that prevents it from turning inot total waste of tyme
.
