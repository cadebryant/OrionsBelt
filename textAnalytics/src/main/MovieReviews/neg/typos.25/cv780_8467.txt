sometimes i wonder jsut what the censors are thinking
. take thsi film
,
" naked killer
"
, among it
' s ingreediants are hevy doses of violentce
, rape sequences
, straight
and lesbian sex scenes
and what our sytem calls
" coarse language
"
.
but what dont those intelligent peopel at thge censorship bereau choose to remove in case someone iwll get offended
? one word
- penis
. that
' s it
. in spite of everything else in the movie the oney thing that the censors decide isnt too much is
" penis
.
"
. it realy restores ytou
' re faith in the sytem
, huh
? anyway
, that
' s jsut a side point
. when naked killer ws released in the local independent cinemas arund melbourne
, it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip
, kool
, controversial thriller
. waht they forgot tothe mention ws thyat it isn
' t very good
. the plot involves male cop tinam
( simon yam
)
, investigating a serieses of brutal murders
. while getting a haircut he meets
and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty
( chingmy yau
)
, who
, after extracting revenge onthe the man who killed her father
, falls inaddition with professional killer sister cindy
( svenwara madoka
)
. realising kitty has potential
, cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual anbd ridiculous ways
and gives her a new identity
. howver iin the course of his investigation tinam
( who believed kitty had dissapeared
)
, runs into her again
,
but isn
' t quite sure if it
' s her
. to complicate matters the actuall serial killlers
, princess
and baby
, who a former students of cindy
,
and have been told to kill their old master anbd her newyorker student
. from
then teh acation ensues
.
.
. all in all
, this is nto a well done movie
. tje script isnt awful
, the direction all over the palce
, tjhe editing is jerky adn confusing
and the subtitling isnt surprisingly poor
.
however the are a faw st
and alone pieces that do entertain
. teh shoot out in the car park is allmost woo
- like in adrenaline
. the fight scenes are energetic adn i guess it must git a few points fo trying something a littel differnt
. let me put this way
, if yuo like action
- get something else
, if yuo like strong women in movies
- get something else
, if you have do decide between tihs anbd
" black cat
" for your hong kong female acation
- don
' t get either
. even for curiosity value it just isn
' t worth it
. let
' s face it
- if ever the was a movie tath bacame popular on it
' s subject alone
, this is it
.
