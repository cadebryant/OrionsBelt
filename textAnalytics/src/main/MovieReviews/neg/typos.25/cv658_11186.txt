senseless is a prime example of whta can happn whn you try to push a oen
- joke concept a bit too far
. director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this
, having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies
. marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon
, a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage
. howver
, he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition
, scott thorpe
( david spade
, in the smarmy sort of role he cxan deliver in his sleep
)
: an atheletic recrod
, sponsorship by a fraternity
,
and
, most of all
, a wealthy family to back him up
. inthe fact
, darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet
.
but there may be a ight at tjhe end ofthe that tunnel
. he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university
' s dr
. wheedon
( brad dourif
)
. as a result
, his senses are magnified tenfold
. using his newfound abilities
, he sets himself infact complet persuit of the job
( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side
- effects to having super senses
)
. naturually
, marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle
, giving jim carrey
- ish amounts ofthe physical humer
. the probelm is
, aside from a faw genuinely inspired bits
, there
' s nto much that
' s funny here
. the film hasnt it
' s one central gag
,
and pads outloud the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor
. there obviously wasn
' t much
thought put into teh plot
. the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous
. i mean
, why tjhe emphasis on extra
- curricular activities if the entire job is goign to come down tothe a single
- elimination quiz anyhow
?
and is this the onyl job being offered to economics majors htis semester
? to give it credit
, senseless does try to create a secondary joke withthe darryl
' s roomate
, tim laflour
( matthew lillard
)
. apparently
, he is supposed to be faddish
,
but the film never does anything with him
, leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie
. his
" intervention
" scenes wiht darryl
,
however
, do provide a rare
,
and welcome
, laugh
. annd
then there
' s the lveo interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this noe
. inthe thsi case
, the object of darryl
' s amor is janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a fellow student who won
' t have anytying tothe do with darryl until he gains his super
- senses
. needless tothe say
, the romance is completely extraneous
,
and adds little to the film
. thsi is a film that desperately needed something esle
. be that a good plot
, more jokes
( or simpley funnier ones
)
, or a storng charater or two
, anytying would hvae helpped senseless get off the ground
. as it isnt
, all the manic exuberant mugging in tjhe world can
' t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground
.
