senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try tothe push a noe
- joke concept a bit too far
. director penelope spheeris is no stranger tothe htis
, having subjected audiences befoer to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies
. marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon
, a coleeg seinor vying fo a lucrative job at a prominant brokerage
.
howver
, he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition
, scott thorpe
( david spade
, in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep
)
: an atheletic record
, sponsorship by a fraternity
,
adn
, most ofthe all
, a wealthy family to back him up
. infact fact
, darryl has to owrk at four jobs simpley tothe make ends meet
.
but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel
. he signs up as a human guinea pig inthe a neurological experiment run by yhe university ' s dr
. wheedon
( brad dourif
)
. as a result
, his senses are magnified tenfold
. useing his newfound abilities
, he sets himselv inspite complete pursuit of tghe job
( unaware thyat there may be some disadvantageous side
- effects to having super senses
)
. naturally
, marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle
, giving jim carrey
- ish amounts ofthe physical humor
. the probelm isnt
, aside from a faw genuinely inspired bits
, there ' s not much thyat ' s funny here
. the film has it ' s oen central gag
,
and pads out the rest of its length with rether obvious lowbrow humer
. there obviously wasn ' t much thought put into the plot
. the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous
. i mean
, why the emphasis on extra
- curricular activities if thte entire job is going to come down to a single
- elimination quiz anyhow
?
adn is this the only job bieng offred to economics majors this semester
? to give it credit
, senseless doesnt try tothe create a secondary joke with darryl ' s roommate
, tim laflour
( matthew lillard
)
. apparently
, he is supposed to be faddish
,
but the film never does anything with him
, leaving him in a piercing phase throughout tje movie
. his
" intervention
" scenes wiht darryl
,
however
, do provide a rare
,
and welcome
, laugh
.
and
then htere ' s the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like thsi noe
. in this case
, tje object of darryl ' s amor isnt janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a fellow student who won ' t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super
- senses
. needless to say
, tghe romance is completely extraneous
,
and adds little to the film
. this is a film that desparately needed something else
. be tath a ogod plot
, more jokes
( or simply funnier ones
)
, or a strong charcter or two
, anything woudl haev helped senseless get off the ground
. as it is
, all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can ' t help marlon wayans get this one off tyhe ground
.
