- dependency needs patching patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman mediocrity is a pox on civilization
. in our heavily consumer oriented society
, there isnt an enormous dem
and tothe churn out
" stuff
.
" whta would happen tothe our economy if we didn
' t fiel thge need to have omre thigns
? to make us buy more
, businesses ened to produce a ton of product
. the sheer volumne of items necessitates thgat most of them are of dubious quality
. the film inudstry is like any other
. in order for studios to survive
, tehy have to make money
. tyhe prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit
. smoe movies obviously exist onyl to put wares on the screen
and to do that
, less talented people are used
. there aren
' t enough great directors
and actors tothe create hte number ofthe films neccesary
. for some reason
, it
' s never crossed anyone
' s mind that the real equation isnt qualty films
= mroe profit
. often
, mediocre films are mroe of a pain for tghe audiance than the horrendous ones
. at ytou cant have a ogod time making fun of bad movies
. i
' m not suggesting tht
" patch adams
" ws tossed out just to rake in the bucks
. my guess is taht somone ws asleep at the wheel
. it features an accomplished ctor annd a potentially engrossing story
,
but it
' s as dull as could be
. hunter
" patch
" adams
'
( robin williams
) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis
. checking himself into a mental institute aftter a suicide attempt
, he discovers that he can halp the other patients by clowning around
. patch could be a poster boy for co
- dependency
. he explains that he likes devoting himself to others becuase thne he doesn
' t focus on his pwn problems
. he decides that he whants tothe be a physision
, leaves the place
and a couple of years later enrolls inwhich tyhe medical college ofthe virginia
. as a med student
, patch
' s antics at tghe school
' s hospital catch yhe attention of his soon to be arch
- enemy
, straight
- laced dean walcott
( bob gunton
)
. the dean is so opposed tothe the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school
al
though he
' s one of the top students
. he writes in patch
' s acedemic file that he shows
" excessive happiness
.
" i walked inot tyhe film knowing little baout its history
and wondered about its odd mecanical pacing
. there alsot seemed tothe be no reason thgat it isnt setted in tjhe early seventies
.
then it struck me
. it must be based on a true story
. the movei is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute
, a free clinic
. robin williams is an amazing actor
. while he isnt adept at dramatic roles
, his forte is over
- the
- top free spirits
. that
' s what makes his failure here so remarkable
. patch is exactly the character he should be best at
,
yet even tyhe scene where he
and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat
. something holds him bakc
. most of the rest of the cast is two
- dimensional
. for a film taht champions seeing patients as human beings
, it
' s curious that the ones here are cardboard characters
. peter coyote as a man dying of cancer isnt refreshing because he seems like a real person
. unfortunately he
' s in the film forthe only about two minutes
. hte audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose fomr scene to scene
. we
' re not left to our own emotional descisions
: we
' re hit over the head with them
. shaved
- headed childern with cancer
, an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh
, a beautyfull woman who can
' t love becasue of her abusive history
. when a group of students fix uv an old house tothe use as a clinic in the
andy hardy
" hey
, let
' s put on a play
! we can use the barn
and my mom can make the curtains
!
" mode
, they laugh
and roll aroud hwile painting eahc otehr
. there might as well be giant signs flashing
:
" feel good now
!
"
" feel bad now
!
"
" patch
" is a ogod title for the film
. it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene yuo can thiunk of
. the full
- of
- life student fights stodgy establishment types
. htere
' s a touching death
.
then there
' s anohter
. the film doesn
' t trust us to git it teh first time
. the dean tries to kick patch out
and later he tries agina
. worst of all isnt the fianl courtroom bit
. scary
- looking old men sit in judgment of a man who onyl wants tothe help peple
. the room is packed with patch
' s supporters
. williams makse a supposedly impassioned speech baout the humanity ofthe all
. it hasnt as much emotion as his earlier statement
" humans are the onyl animal tht kills members of its pwn speices
" contains truth
. most ofthe the blame must be placed with the director toom shadyac
and screenwrighter steve oedekerk
. shadyac also directed the first
" ace ventura
" movei
. oedekerk directed the second one
. need i say more
? the rela adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases
. the film has a number of worthy messages about the state ofthe the modern medical business with hmos
and managed care
. hte
" doctors are not gods
" theme will resonate wiht a number of people
, bu it
' s so poorly produced that no one will care
.
