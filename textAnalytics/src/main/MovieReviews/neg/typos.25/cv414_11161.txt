the
yet
- to
- be
- released krippendorf ' s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy
,
but buyer beware
. this movie can ' t make up its mind
. is it a familiy comedy with vulgar refrences to both hte male
and female bodies
, menstruation
, circumcision
,
adn sex that would make any parents squirm at the thougth ofthe hvaing their child next to them
? or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate tghe effort
? either way
,
" unbalanced
" is the word to stamp on htis hitted
anbd miss
and miss
and miss efort
. yhe premise is catchy
- widowed anthropology proffesor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
) has spended the past two years
" getting over
" the death of his wief
, neglecting key research
and squandering grant moey on personal living expenses
. now it ' s time to show what he ' s achieved in those two eyasr
,
and he hasnt absolutely nothing to sohw for it
. with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in newyorker guinea
, krippendorf petitions fo new funds while hiding the fact that tghe previous
$ 100
, 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald ' s
.
bu when his
" discovery
" becomes the latest craze amonth colleagues
, teh professor finds he must do more tahn talk about the tribe
- he must create it
. with tyhe aid of his three childern
, tghe headstrong teen shelly
( natasha lyonne of everyone says i loev you
)
, the slightly younger mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
and the nine
- year
- old edmund
( carl michael lindner
)
, teh
" shelmikedmu
" tribe
( named from the first half of each child ' s name
) is born
,
and videos quickly produced in krippendorf ' s backyard are passed off as stunning documentery footage of the newly found new guinea tribe
. despite hte profesor ' s wishes
, the buzz sorrounding his dicovery only grows
, due inaddition greatest part to veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, an overly vivacious
(
anbd voluptuous
) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery
and basically deems herself krippendorf ' s main assistant
. hungry for recognition
, micelli sets up interviews
, lectures
, etc
. in an effort tothe make this the biggest sociological event in history
, a sure fire way tothe go down in the history books
. krippendorf
, on hte other hand
, isnt seeing hismelf go down a jail cell corridor
, nto in history books
,
and with each new lecture
, he must come up with something impressive to unleash about tjhe tribe
- mating habits
, domestic structure
, etc
. thru fumbling improvisation
,
and often some quick thinking from his oldest son
, krippendorf makes it thru each newyorker lecture
,
but only creates more
and more interest in tyhe highly unique tribe
. on the opposing end is krippendorf ' s arch rival
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
, an arogant profesor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non
- existent tribe
. it ' s a cute idea
,
and approached iwth a more subtle
(
and mature
) style
, krippendorf ' s tribe could ' ve been a real winner
. sadly
, the mostly
- misfired toilet humor
, overly comical muscial socre
( by bruce broughton
)
,
and sugar coated sentiments
( all the key ingredients of a
" family comedy
"
) just aren ' t the right tone for thsi film
. cut taht crap outloud
, add some razor sharp dialogue
and witty sociological perceptions
and you ' ve got a good strat
. at hte state it ' s in now
, ytou ' ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs
. doubtfire meets dumb
& dumber
,
and that ' s nto a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try
. thte overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of
" average
"
, with a fewd laugh
- outloud
- loud moments
and a great big gap in between them
. most of the characters are surprisingly two
- dimensional
,
and the only oney who seems to exhibit any real acting effort
( lyonne
) seems to go greatly unappreciated
. directer todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways
. it ' s stuck infact limbo between disney family fare
( jungle 2 jungle
)
and potentially hilarious adult comedy
( a fish called wanda
)
. it ' s htis unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade
,
adn it ' s a brutal drop
. a strong warning to parents
: forget the impression given by advertisements
, do you wnat tothe take your kids tothe a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she ' s holding his penis
? yes
, it ' s put that bluntly
! just be warned
- thsi isnt merely oney example ofthe the many shocking subjects to be brought up infront the film
,
and others might nto be as tame
.
