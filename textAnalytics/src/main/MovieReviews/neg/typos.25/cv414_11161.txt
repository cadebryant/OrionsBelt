' s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy
,
but buyer beware
. tihs movie can
' t make uv its mind
. is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both hte male
and female bodies
, menstruation
, circumsicion
,
and sex thgat owudl make any parents squirm at the throught ofthe having their child next to them
? or isnt it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort
? eather way
,
" unbalanced
" is tyhe word to stamp on tihs hit
and miss
and miss
and miss affort
. tjhe premise is catchy
- widowed anthropology profesor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
) has spent the past twpo eyasr
" getting over
" thge death ofthe his wife
, neglecting key research
and squ
andering grant mony on personal living expenses
. now it
' s time to show whta he
' s achieved inwhich those two years
,
and he hasnt absolutely nothing to show for it
. wtih a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea
, krippendorf petitions fo new funds hwile hiding the fact thast the previous
$ 100
, 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald
' s
. bu wehn his
" discovery
" becomes the latest craze amung collegues
, thge professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe
- he must create it
. with the aid of his three children
, yhe headstrong teen shelly
( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you
)
, the slightly younger mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
and the nine
- year
- ood edmund
( carl michael lindner
)
, the
" shelmikedmu
" tribe
( named from thte first half of each child
' s name
) isnt born
, adn videos quicklyu produced in krippendorf
' s backyard are passed off as stunning documenatry footage of tjhe newely found newyorker guinea tribe
. despite tje professor
' s wishes
, the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows
, due in greatest part to veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, an overly vivacious
(
and voluptuous
) anthropologist who barges her way into tje discovery
and basically deems herself krippendorf
' s main assistant
. hungry for recognition
, micelli sets uv interviews
, lectures
, etc
. infact an affort to make this the biggest sociological event in history
, a sure fier way to go down in the history books
. krippendorf
, on yhe otehr h
and
, is seeing hismelf go down a jail cell corridor
, not in history books
, annd with earch new lecture
, he must cmo up with something impressive tothe unleash about tje tribe
- mating habits
, domestic stucture
, etc
. thru fumbling improvisation
,
and often some quick thikning from his oldest son
, krippendorf makes it thru earch newyorker lecture
,
but only creates more
and mroe interest in the highly unique tribe
. on the opposing end is krippendorf
' s arch rival
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
, an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her onthe a mission to disprove the existance ofthe the non
- existent tribe
. it
' s a cute idae
, anbd approached with a more subtle
(
and mature
) style
, krippendorf
' s tribe coudl
' ve been a real winner
. sadly
, the mostly
- misfired toilet humer
, overly comical musical score
( by bruce broughton
)
,
and sugar coated sentiments
( all the key ingredients of a
" family comedy
"
) just aren
' t thte right tone for this film
. cutted that crap out
, add soem razor sharp dialogue
and witty sociological perceptions
and you
' ve got a good start
. at hte state it
' s in now
, you
' ve got something along the lines ofthe medicine man meets mrs
. doubtfire meets dumb
& dumber
,
and that
' s not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try
. the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of
" average
"
, iwth a fewd laugh
- out
- loud moments
and a grat big gap in between them
. most ofthe the characters are surprisingly two
- dimensional
,
and thge only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort
( lyonne
) seems to go greatly unappreciated
. director todd holl
and hasnt gone about making thsi film in all the wrong ways
. it
' s stuck in limbo between disney family fare
( jungle 2 jungle
)
and potentially hillarious adult comedy
( a fish called w
anda
)
. it
' s this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade
,
and it
' s a brutal drop
. a strong warning to parents
: forget thte impression given by advertisements
, do you whant to tkae your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely beccause she
' s holding his penis
? yes
, it
' s put that bluntly
! just be warned
- this is merely one example of thte many shocking subjects to be brought up in tjhe film
,
and others might not be as tame
.
