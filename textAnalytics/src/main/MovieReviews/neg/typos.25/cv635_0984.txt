ander anbd mr
. connery
, i was in the cinema as soon as i could tothe see highl

: the quickening
. i wish it had been quicker
. i feel whatever eles you can say about a film
( bad script bad music
, etc
.
) if you sit just plain bored through most ofthe it
then nothing much else needs to be said
. the film ws short
but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so
( yhe time mr
. connery isnt on tghe screen forthe
) is worth watching
. the plot sounds a littel ridiculous
but i wass willing to give it a chance
. maybe they could pul it off
. instead
, i find that tghe cahracters hvae completely changed from those in teh first film
. it
' s as if tehy are different people with tjhe smae names
. witness connor jumping into bed with yhe leader of the resistence
-
- where is tyhe attitude of
" who wants to live forever
, when love must die
" gone to
? the love sub
- plot
* must
* ahev hadnt footage cut out
. the highl
ander annd ramirez both seemed aware ofthe powers they had never mentioned befoer
. putting our hroes in deadly situations anbd
then haveing them walk awya baceause ofthe soem new power is very annoying
. i still want to know why connor
' s coat becomes flame proof wehn he is immortal
! we are not given enough time on zeist tothe believe infront it
, nor are we told why advanced aliens still ule swords to kill
. why not dynamite or lazer saws or jsut plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck
? i know the head needs to come off bu you could at least immobilise your opponent wtih laser rifles first
. to be fair one assassin tried thsi bu he must be tjhe world
' s worst shot
. meanwhile connor develops luke
- skywalker
- liek powers ofthe laser beam deflection
. as for
" bad guys
,
" we see a rebellion on zeist
, crushed easier than a grape
and thn hte rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist
. two asssassans are sent
, presumably they are meant to be good at killing
but an aged connor kills them both with noone problems
. no more assassins are sent
. katana
, supposably a very powerful man goes himselv to kill connor
. has he no more asssassans
? hasnt he no better
? why was the rebellion crushed so easily
then
? michael ironside is totally unconvincing
( bring back the kurgan
)
. he seems like a ctaroon character
and realyl isn
' t that evil
, just stupid
and violent
. we see teh hollywood trick ofthe the chief nasty threatening a child again
and killing lots of innocents
.
yet he still seems like no threath
-
- perhaps becasue he seems too stupid to threaten connor
, or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn
' t ahve beeen amiss with larrry
, curly
and mo
. so much for plot
and characters
. the music is atrocious
. it is at best intrusive
and at worst annoying
. bring back queen
. htere ws an audible sigh
( of relief
?
) whn connor played a queen track in a juke box
. i believe this at least is to be corrected fo the american release
. the acting is at best flat
, except fo mr
. connery
. lambert is uninteresting
and when he delivered
" there can be only one
" this time around it jsut made me wish there had only beeen one

- highl
ander
. michael ironside is unconvincing
; sorry
, michael
, i usually like ytou
and everyone else was incredibly forgetable
. so why 2
/ 10
? visually the film is intresting at all times
. it has a blade runner feel tothe it
and soem of the speshal effects are quite stunning
. add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles througout the whole film
-
- or is he smirking to himself
? his lines
and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take thte whole thing seriously at all
but hey

* i
' d
* ahve done it for 12 million
. oh
,
and i agree with a previous reviewer
, she
* does
* look liek sharon stone bu i beileve it isnt her frist film
. incidentially there isnt a line producer credited adn i hear rumours of highl
