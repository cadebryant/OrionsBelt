and the shield
. katana meanwhile
, fearing connor woudl return
, sets outloud himself to kill hte highlander
. if you have never seen it
. bieng a fan ofthe highlander
and mr
. connery
, i ws in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii
: the quickening
. i wish it hadnt beeen quicker
. i efel whatever else you can say about a film
( bad scirpt bad music
, etc
.
) if you sit just plain borde through most of it
then nothing much else needs to be said
. tjhe film ws short
bu in my opinion only twelve minutes or so
( the time mr
. connery is on tjhe screen for
) isnt worth watching
. the plot sounds a little ridiculous
bu i was willing to give it a chance
. mabye they could pull it off
. instade
, i fidn that the characters have completelyl changed fomr those in the first film
. it ' s as if they are different people wtih the smae names
. wittness connor jumping into bed with tyhe leader of tyhe resistance
-
- where is the attitude of
" who wants to live forever
, when loev must die
" gone to
? thge love sub
- plot
* must
* have had footage cut outloud
. the highlander
and ramirez both seemed aware ofthe powers they had never mentioned before
. putting our heroes in deadly situations
anbd
then having them walk away beccause of some new pwoer is very annoying
. i still want to know why connor ' s coat becomes flame proof whn he is immortal
! we are not given enough time onthe zeist to believe inwhich it
, nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill
. why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck
? i know the head needs tothe cmo off
bu you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles firt
. to be fair one assasin tried this
but he must be the world ' s worst shot
. meanwhile connor develops luke
- skywalker
- liek powers ofthe laser beam deflection
. as for
" bad guys
,
" we see a rebellion on zeist
, crushed easier than a grape
and
then the rest of hte plot depends on katana being obsessed iwth killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist
. two assassins are sent
, presumibly they are meant to be ogod at killing
but an aged connor kills them both wtih no problems
. noone omre assassins are sent
. katana
, supposedly a vyre poweful man goes hismelf tothe kill connor
. has he no more assassins
? has he no better
? why was the rebellion crushed so easily
then
? michael ironside is totally unconvincing
( bring bcak the kurgan
)
. he seems like a ctaroon character
and really isn ' t that evil
, just stupid
and violent
. we see the hollywood trick ofthe the chief nasty threatening a child again
annd killing lots of innocents
.
yet he still seems like no threat
-
- perhaps because he seems too stupid tothe threaten connor
, or maybee because his twpo best assassins wouldn ' t ahve been amiss with larry
, curly
and mo
. so much fo plot
and characters
. the music is atrocious
. it is at best intrusive
and at worst annoying
. bring back queen
. there was an audible sigh
( of releaf
?
) when connor played a queen track in a juke box
. i believe this at least is tothe be corrected for the american realease
. the acting is at best flat
, exept for mr
. connery
. lambert isnt uninteresting
anbd when he delivered
" htere can be only one
" htis tyme around it just made me wish there had onyl beeen one
-
- highlander
. michael ironside is unconvincing
; sory
, michael
, i usually like you
and everyone alse was incredibly forgetable
. so why 2
/ 10
? visually the film is intresting at all times
. it has a blade runner feel to it
and some ofthe the speical effects are qutie stunning
. add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film
-
- or isnt he smirking to himself
? his lines
and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all
bu hey
-
-
* i ' d
* hvae done it for 12 million
. oh
,
and i agree with a previous reviewer
, she
* does
* look like sharon stone
but i believe it is her first film
. incidentally there is a line producer credited
annd i hear rumours ofthe highlander iii
: the wizard
.
