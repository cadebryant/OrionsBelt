i think we should
, as responsible citizens
, all get together
and stop jim carrey from makeing anohter movei
. he ' s changing the cinema as we know it
-
-
and forthe thte worst
. i owudl willingly rewatch batman
and robin rather
then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments
-
- prologues
, epilogues
, etc
. the premise
: a lawyer cant ' t lie for a day
. ho
, ho
. normally a movie made from tihs premise owudl be terrible
-
- mr
. carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable
. i laughed once
-
-
and i ws laughing at thge sighth of everyone else laughing
. grinding doesn ' t beign to decribe
. it pounds onthe your head so forcefully
and so unstoppably that
, if you are a normal person
, you leave feeling sick
. when it ' s not trying to be funny
, it ' s trying tothe be melodramatic
-
-
but it ' s just annoying
, stupid
and sappy
. at best
. tihs movie is intended to make people laff
, yes
, not to be voted best picture ofthe all tiome by sight
anbd soudn
.
but
, it fails on every possible levle
. it fails to be funny
. it fails to be insightful
. it fails tothe be suspensful
. it fails tothe be funn
. they shouldnt pay people to see it
. it suceeds on noe levle
-
- it makes me want to git down onthe the ground
and start thanking orson welles
, for having lived
. if you go in with thte intention of coming out alive
, please amke sure that you are overly fond of boob
, fart
, pimple
and fat jokes
-
- otherwise you wiull go insane
. yes
, litterally insane
. stark
, raving mad
. it is boring
, stupid
, melodramatic
and in tyhe end ugly
. i reccemond it strongly
. tothe ed wood
