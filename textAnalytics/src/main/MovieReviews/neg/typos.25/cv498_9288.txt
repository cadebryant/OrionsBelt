i think we shoudl
, as responsible citizens
, all get together
and stop jim carrey from making another movie
. he
' s changing the cinema as we know it
-
-
and for the worst
. i would willingly rewatch batman
and robin rather hten agian sit through this miserable collecton of filmic moments
-
- prologues
, epilogues
, etc
. thge premise
: a lawyer can
' t lie for a day
. ho
, ho
. normally a movei made from this premise woudl be terrible
-
- mr
. carrey suceeds inspite making it unwatchable
. i laughed once
-
-
and i wass laughing at tje sight of everyone else laughing
. grinding doesn
' t begin to describe
. it pounds on your head so forcefully annd so unstoppably that
, if you are a normal person
, you leave feeling sick
. wehn it
' s not trying to be funny
, it
' s trying to be melodramatic
-
- bu it
' s just annoying
, stupid adn sappy
. at best
. this movie isnt intended to make people laff
, yes
, not tothe be voted best picture of all time by sighth
and sound
.
but
, it fails on eveyr possible level
. it fails tothe be funny
. it fails to be insightful
. it fails to be suspensful
. it fails to be fun
. htey should pay people to see it
. it suceeds on one level
-
- it makes me want to get down on the ground
and start thanking orson welles
, fo haveing lived
. if you go infact with the intention of comming out alive
, please make sure thta yuo are overly fond of boob
, fart
, pimple
and fat jokes
-
- otherwise you iwll go insane
. yes
, literally insane
. stark
, raving mad
. it is boring
, stupid
, melodramatic adn in hte end ugli
. i reccemond it strongly
. to ed woud
