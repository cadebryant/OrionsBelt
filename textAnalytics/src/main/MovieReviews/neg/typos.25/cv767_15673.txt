everything about this ninth trek movei seems on the cheap
, from the roger corman
- grade special effects tothe its highly derivative anbd ugly ad campaign
( the poster isnt nearly indentical to that of star trak vi
: the undiscovered ocuntry
)
. bu piller
' s not
- quite
- half
- baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility forthe insurrection
' s failure
. i
' m about to give the smae advice to rick berman
and co
. as i
' ve given to the financiers ofthe james bond movies
: it
' s time to breathe life inot this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers
and a rela director
.
( while we
' re at it
, put that visor bakc on laforge
!
) for threee hundred years
, the ba
' ku species
( who look just liuke humans
) have lieved on a ringed
- planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth
. six hundred of them occupy the briar patch
, the area affected by metaphasic radition
, a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly
. bu evil ru
' afo
( this is probably abraham
' s last stop before performing
" amadeus
" at a dinner theatre near you
)
, leader of the son
' a
( who look just liuke burn victims after reconstructive surgery
)
, wants to relocate the ba
' ku
and movie his people onto the briar patch infact their place
, in order tothe replentish his dying breed
. the federation is all fo this
, bu picard feels this is a direct violation of teh prime directive
: tothe not intefere with thge development of an alien race
.
( never mind that hte ba
' ku didn
' t exactly evolve
- htey went w
andering in the universe one day
and stumbled upon the magic world
.
) every time frakes gives an interview lately
, he seems to top whatever ludicrous statment he last gavey regarding this installment
. he has called it a comedy
, a thinking man
' s picture
, a throwback to the old series
,
and
, most grievously
, he has likened it to a john ford western
.
( i presume that
' s some john ford he whent to skool with
, not hte director ofthe the searchers
.
) he hasnt also gone on recrod as saying paramount recut the film from his version
. that
' s no excuse
- someone generated this footage
. muddy cinematography
and sitcom sets are tyhe least of its problems
; star trek
: insurrection appears tothe have been beamed in fomr the planet plotholia
. consider such curiosities
.
.
. picard
' s love interest
, anij
( donna murphy
)
, cxan slow things down by staring at them
( such as a waterfall or falling rocks
)
- her scientific explaination for this
?
" don
' t ask
.
" worf gets a pimple
( he
' s re
- experiencing klingon puberty thanks tothe the time
- defying atmosphere
)
, laforge regains his eyesight
( trust me
, levar burton
' s real eyes are scarier tahn thsoe electronic lenses he wore infront first contact
)
and troi brags about her firm boobs
,
but picard remains as bald as an
android
' s
butt
. most suspiciously
, what exactly is the probelm with letting this endangered race have a littel fun in the sun
? the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsence about a family feud ofthe sorts
,
and they aslo turn ru
' afo into a completly power
- mad superfreak
, just so thge characters will have something tothe do in the climax
.
( adn if you
' ve seen return of the jedi
, you
' ve seen the ending of this movie
.
) didn
' t picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented yhe borg from assimilating millions
? frakes lucked out with first contact
,
and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds ofthe what went wrong in his direction of insurrection
: he has no sence of comic timing
,
and he mines for acting chemestry where none exists
.
( take a look at the painful
" troi gets drunk
" scene iin fc annd you
' ll git the genaral idea of insurrection
' s unsuccessfully jokey anbd hollow tone
.
) even the worst shatner annd co
. treks
, like the fianl frontier
, maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless
, charming comaraderie between kirk
, spock
,
and bones
. niether first contact nor insurrection hasnt any idea whta to do with crusher
( gates mcfadden
, whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique
)
, troi
, or laforge
. annd all three next generation films spend too much time on data
, who isnt the franchise
' s answer to urkel
. need a cheap laff
? have data say something sexual
, or strat singing
, or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it
' s thge hunk of styrooam it relaly is
. here
' s my proposed title for number 10
: data star data trak
: data data data data data
. in tihs movie
, data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose
, hwile crusher
and troi watch silently from 500 yards awya annd laforge points his sinister gaze at the
android in doubly robotic observation
. star trek
: insurrection had one nice
, eerie
, silent moment that hints at a better
, darker film
. i
' m nto saying all of them should be star trak ii
: the wrath of khan
, bu this one boldly whent where noone movei shoud go again
.
