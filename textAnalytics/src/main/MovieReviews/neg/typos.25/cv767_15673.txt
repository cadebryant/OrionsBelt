everything about this nineth trak movie seems on the cheap
, from the roger corman
- grade special effects tothe its highly derivative
and ugli ad campaign
( the poster is nearly identical to that ofthe star trek vi
: the undiscovered country
)
.
but piller ' s nto
- qutie
- half
- baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection ' s failure
. i ' m baout to give the smae advice to rick berman
and co
. as i ' ve given tothe the financiers of james bond movies
: it ' s time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers
annd a rela director
.
( hwile we ' re at it
, put thast visor back onthe laforge
!
) forthe threee hundered years
, the ba ' ku speices
( who look just like humans
) have lived on a ringed
- planet thgat might as well be called the fountain of youth
. six hundered of them occupy the briar patch
, thte area affected by metaphasic radition
, a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly
.
but evil ru ' afo
( tihs is propably abraham ' s last stop before performing
" amadeus
" at a dinner theatre near you
)
, leader of teh son ' a
( who look just liuke burn victims after reconstructive surgery
)
, wants to relocate the ba ' ku
and movei his peopel onto the briar patch in thier place
, in order to replenish his dying breed
. the federation is all fo this
,
bu picard feels this is a direct voilation of the prime directive
: to not interfear wtih the development of an alien race
.
( never mind tath the ba ' ku didn ' t exactlly evolve
- they whent wandering inspite tje universe one day
annd stumbled upon the magic world
.
) every time frakes gives an interview lately
, he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment
. he has called it a comedy
, a thikning man ' s picture
, a throwback to teh ood series
,
adn
, most grievously
, he has likened it to a john ford western
.
( i presume that ' s some john ford he went to school withthe
, not the directer of the searchers
.
) he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut tyhe film from his verison
. that ' s no excuse
- someone generated htis footage
. muddy cinematography
anbd sitcom sets are the least of its problems
; star trak
: insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia
. consider such curiosities
.
.
. picard ' s love intrest
, anij
( donna murphy
)
, cxan slow things down by staring at them
( such as a waterfall or falling rocks
)
- her scientific explanation fo this
?
" don ' t ask
.
" worf gets a pimple
( he ' s re
- experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the tiome
- defying atmosphere
)
, laforge regains his eyesight
( trust me
, levar burton ' s real eyes are scarier than those eletronic lenses he wore iin first contact
)
and troi brags about her firm boobs
,
but picard remains as bald as an android ' s butt
. most suspiciously
, what exactlly is thte problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun
? teh filmmakers cloud yhe issue iwth some nonsense about a family fued of sorts
,
anbd they also turn ru ' afo into a completely power
- mad superfreak
, jsut so hte cahracters wiull have something to dont in the climax
.
(
and if yuo ' ve seen return ofthe the jedi
, you ' ve seen the ending of this movei
.
) didn ' t picard hismelf previously disobey tghe prime directive when he prevented thte borg from assimilating millions
? frakes lucked outloud with first contact
,
and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection
: he hasnt no sense of comic timing
,
and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists
.
( take a look at the painful
" troi gets drunk
" scene in fc
and you ' ll git the genaral idae of insurrection ' s unsuccessfully jokey
and hollow tone
.
) even the worst shatner
anbd co
. treks
, liek the fianl frontier
, maintained a watchability thanks tothe the effortless
, charming comaraderie between kirk
, spock
,
anbd bones
. neither first contact nor insurrection hasnt any idae whta to dont with crusher
( gates mcfadden
, whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique
)
, troi
, or laforge
.
annd all threee next generation films spend too much time onthe data
, who isnt hte franchise ' s answer to urkel
. need a cheap laugh
? have data say something sexual
, or start singing
, or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it ' s the hunk ofthe styrofoam it relaly is
. here ' s my proposed title for number 10
: data star data trek
: data data data data data
. in htis movie
, data will become preoccupied iwth learning to blow his nose
, while crusher
and troi watch silently from 500 yards awya
and laforge points his sinister gaze at tje android inaddition doubly robotic observation
. star trek
: insurrection hadnt noe nice
, eerie
, silent moment that hints at a better
, darker film
. i ' m not saying all of them should be star trek ii
: the wrath of khan
,
but this one boldly went where no movei shoudln go again
.
