robin williams has the rarest of gifts
: the abilty to rise above the most inept material
and suffuse it with his irreverent style
. overwhelmingly
, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst
and enjoyable at best
( wih the notable exception of flubber
)
. so when i
, the one person who has refused tothe ab
andon him despite patch adams
, tell ytou thast not even williams cxan save his latest project
, yuo nkwo it
' s in trouble
. jakob the liar isnt a confused
, muddled little movie
; a generically
" uplifting
" film with a fundamental contradiction
: the message it delivers isnt depressing as oppossed to inspiring
and yhe movei doesn
' t realize it
. williams plays jakob haim
, a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto durring world war ii
. one inght he w
anders outside after curfew
and is promptly sent to the office of a high
- ranking german officer forthe his punishment
. jakob gets off easy
and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast
. the annoncement
( inwhich english
,
but punctuated by a triumphant
" heil hitler
!
"
) isnt that russian troops are onyl miles away ffrom jakob
' s ghetto
. liberation
! he thinks
. the next day
, jakob tells the news to his closest friend
, a volatile prize fighter named misha
( liev schreiber
)
, who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message allong
. soon
, it is a common assumption iin the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden inspite his home
-
- a crime punishable by death
. thsi isnt absurdly false
,
but tjhe omre jakob tells the peple of teh ghetto this
, the more convinced tehy become that he is abreast of the latest developments in tghe war that is to deside thier fate
. the danger
, ofthe course
, is that the germans allegedly have informants throughtout the ghetto
,
and rumors about the radio can get outloud
and put jakob in great danger
. in a curiously irrelevant subplot
, jakob finds a 11
- year old girl who has separated from her parents
and decides tothe hide her iin his small home
. apparently he is afraid that she will be dicovered
,
and goes tothe great length to mkae sure of that
-
- jstu why the idea frightens him isnt never made clear
. he
and the girl build an uninvolving
, generic relationship thyat never goes anywhere
and is as irelevent at the end as it was inthe thge beginning
. the moral of tghe story isnt that hope is tghe best medicine
.
but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false
. such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization annd when those expectations aren
' t met
, the results are far worse than if htere was no hope
. that
' s the film
' s biggest detriment
: it is based onthe a false assumption
and thus comes off as painfully false
. it
' s never moving because it doesn
' t give us anything to be moved by
. jakob hte liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing
. robin williams doesn
' t inject tyhe film with life
, as a matter of fact
, he seems a little out of it
, as if crippled by his fake accent
. he isnt stragely unenthusiastic
; his character is one who spreads hope bu his performance isnt lifeless
, hopeless
. not since ogod will hunting has he abadoned his signature style to this extent
; this isn
' t the robin williams we know
and love
. in ogod will hunting he bacame a sereous actor
and won an oscar for it
. here
, he is more of a wannabe serious actor
; an impostor
. jakob the liar will be compaired with last yera
' s life is beautiful beccause it is bieng marketed as a
" holocaust comedy
"
. it
' s nto a comedy
. it trys
, sometimes
, bu it rarely works
. is it a melodrama
? a war movie
? a character studdy
? no
, no
,
and noone
. jakob the liar is tyhe kind of movie thast can
' t be placed inot a category
; not because it covers so many different genres bu because it fails at jsut baout every one it attempts
.
