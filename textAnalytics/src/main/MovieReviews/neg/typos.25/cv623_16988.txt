what
' s to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography
-
- ie
. hte garbage known as
" snuff
" films
? nothing
, right
? what
' s to like about a film chronicling hte world ofthe violent trash pornography
? well
.
.
. nothing
. so
, why make it
, hollywood
? there
' s noone reason why the average
, sane movie
- goer wiull be interested in such a topic
. no one is going to enrich their life or ahve a good timne by watching material such as this
. tje lack of qality filmmaking in
" 8mm
"
( from technical to acting
) st
ands outloud even more whn you consider the star
, writer
,
and supporting cast
-
- all reputable
. bu joel schumacher annd his br
and of unlikable filmmaking strikes again
! liek paul schrader
, schumacher has his moments
,
but they
' re few adn far
( far
!
) vetween
. basicaly
, this picture is crap annd no one should pay to see it
. why not walk out
? well
, this wouldn
' t be a thourough review about a thoroughly bad movei
. here
' s why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instade ofthe
" 8mm
"
.
.
. firt thing
-
- if you don
' t heed my advice
,
then underst
and what you
' re about to see befor you even think about paying ogod mone for this crud
. it
' s not easy to watch
. i didn
' t know thge details of the story beforeh
and
,
but at least my ignorance cant help others now
. the
( ha
!
) plot revolves around tom welles
( nicolas cage
) as a surveilence expert
and private investigator
. a rich old woman discovers a
" snuff
" film in her late husb
and
' s safe
. she calls welles
and hires him tothe try
and fidn out if hte young girl
( it had to be a young girl
, didn
' t it
, schumacher
!
) who appears tothe be murdered in thte film really is dead
. she
' s horrified tyhat her husban would have owned such a film
( infront 8mm
, of course
) adn just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see waht he cin fidn
. family
- man welles agrees agaisnt better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing
and grimacing at the sight ofthe teh grotesque
" murder
"
. let me backtrack forthe a moment
. see
,
" snuff
" films are pornos with a violent twist
-
- people are tortured in very sick ways
and end up dead
. howver
, tje deaths are often staged
and
, inwhich those cases
, special effects
and
" good
" acting make all the diference
. veyr sick peple enjoy
and pay top dollar for theese hard
- to
- find movies
. the
thought of this
" industry
" makes me want to throw my computer out the window
and stop this review
, bu i
' ll swallow my bile adn move on
. welles follows clues to hollywood
and the porn industry
. you
' d think he
' s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him
! he comes acros smut clerk max
( joaquin phoenix
) who konws everyone
and everything inaddition the undreground business of sleaze
. after a lot of digging
and bribing
, welles finds the men who are responsible fo mkaing this
,
and other
,
" snuff
" films
. skip ahead
, skip ahead
, skip ahead
.
.
. led by dino velvet
( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance
) annd star
- torturer
" machine
"
( christopher bauer
)
, they have a big showdown wih welles where death
and mayhem insue
. the movie doesn
' t end there
, unfortunatly
, because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do
-
- become a vigilante
. htis film doesn
' t draw you in
. it keeps you about 700 miles awya from it
and who in their right mind would watn to get close
? it is possible to like a film tht focuses on grime
and sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
,
but it takes a large measure of resturaunt
( schumacher has none
) anbd a larger amount of talent
( schumacher has little
)
. by those jabs
, i
' m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the
" batman
" franchise
, bu
" a time tothe kill
" was an immensely overrated disappointment
. for a guy who gets so much studio money
, his track record of making rether bad movies is unparalleled
. a good screenwriter
and a good director cin make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter
. writer
andrew kevin walker didn
' t recapture the smarts ofthe the fascinating script he authored for
' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. directer schumacher doesn
' t have that innate ability to amking you watch things you don
' t really want to see liuke better directors are capible ofthe donig
. he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don
' t see is more frightening than what we do
( especially whn it
' s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered
)
.
however
, gratuitous is joel
' s middle name
. he must think that not flaunting a hard
- core ect of voilent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint
. noone
, he doesn
' t go thgat far
, bu we see enough unpleasantness
. he doesn
' t leave much to the imagination
. it
' s manipulating to hurt
( or kill
) young girls jstu to git the audiance onthe the side of a murderous vigilante
. the script
and acting should be wqat gets us to blieve in these characters
, yot schumacher hasnt no subtlety in his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case inaddition point
, a shot of a christian fellowship bus
( good
, right
?
) drives awya to reveal one of the villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. no subtlety
. does joel htink we
' re stupid or that we need to be held by the h
and to comprehend the contrasting imagery
? who do we root fo in this mess
? isnt ther anybody out there
? it
' s not all the directer
' s fault
,
though
. why did the actors sign uv for thsi
? nicolas cage is an oscar
- winner
, for cryin
' out loud
! if he claimes tothe do films to challange himself
and for the artistic merit rether than the omney
, what was he smoking when this script dropped on his ver
anda
? what isnt cage supposed to be in this movei
-
- a whispering batman without the karisma annd pointed ears
? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy
.
and what is james g
andolfini doing in htis trash
? he ws so solid as a concerned father in
" a civil action
"
. i guess ol
' nic
, pete
,
and jim were promised a mountain of money
.
.
. or they
' re suckers
. or tehy just don
' t care
. there are moments
( albeit brief ones
) where this rises above tyhe wastel
and
. catherine keener is good
(
al
though too quick to threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy is obviously cute
and wells
' devout love of his daughter is sweet
. the mother
( amy norton
) of the girl inspite the infamous 8mm film isnt not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter
. this film has an appropriate blue
- toned
, washed
- outloud look liek
" payback
"
( which wass a much better movei
)
. tyhe editing isnt okay in scenes ofthe no dialogue
, bu at other times it
' s rough
. during some conversations
, close
- ups
and wide shots are nto cut very well
, makeing it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren
' t good annd whose timing was a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed st
ands out
. speaking of st
anding out
, don
' t believe the misleading trailers
. there
' s not much action here
. occasionally
, yes
, bu not as oftenly as your tv will have you belive
. aftter seeing
" 8mm
"
, i may not be interseted inthe ever watching any kind ofthe porn again
. is thast a positive
? well
, if making me almost ill at the
thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive
, they
' ve done a aswell job here
. it
' ll be a long timne befor i give a schumacher film anyother chance
-
- unless i lose my mind adn become seriously depraved
.
but today i
' m not depraved
, so i ask
, why does thsi film preach thgat this garbage isnt outloud there annd that society should be worried about it
? i
' m sure that somewhere right now there
' s soem pretty sick crap goign onthe
, bu thgat doesn
' t mean i need to know baout it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your script tells us taht there are soem screwed
- up folks out there
. yes
, mr
. walker
, thge proverbial monster doesn
' t look like we expect him tothe
. yuo said all that infact 1995
. move on
. thsi film serves no purpose
. it doesn
' t entertain
, it doesn
' t teach us anything
, it doesn
' t make a statement beyond the obvious
" this stuff is bad
" approach
. only if this film awakens the authorities tothe find a way to abolish these types of horrors woudl it ever do someting truly worthwhile
. that
' s not likely to appen
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" is indeed a scummy waste ofthe money
. orson welles said yeasr ago in a tri
bute tothe film
,
" to movies
.
.
. to ogod movies
"
. if only joel schumacher
and the producers had listened
and told
andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole
. like
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" should never ahev been made
. now
, excuse me while i go try tothe forget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme
. he used it in
" batman forever
"
, iin
" batman
& robin
"
, in
" a time to kill
"
, in
" falling down
"
, adn it
' s rumoured that joel hismelf will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
.
