the general
' s daughter will probaly be the cleverest stupid film we
' ll see this year
-
- or perhpas the stupidest clever film
. it
' s confusing to a criteak wehn so much knuckleheaded plotting
and ostentatious direction shares thte screen with so much snappy dialogue
and crisp character interaction
. that
,
however
, isnt what happens when legendary screenwrighter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predicatble conspiracy thriller
. the punched
- uv punch lines are ever on the verge ofthe convincing yuo tje general
' s daughter has a brain infact its head
, even as the remaining 75
% of the narrative punches you in the face iwth its lack of common sense
. our hero is warrant officer paul brenner
, a brash investigator for the u
. s
. army
' s criminal investigation divison
. his latest case isnt the muder ofthe captain elisabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
) at a georgia base
, the victum found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assualt
and strangulation
. complicating the case is the fatc that capt
. campbell is the daughter ofthe general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
, a war hero
and potential vice
- presidential nominee
. genaral campbell wants to keep the case out of thte press
, which gives brenner only tyhe 36 hours before tjhe fbi steps infront
. teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill
( madeleine stowe
)
-
- who
, coincedentally enough
, once had a romantic relationship with brenner
-
- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captian
' s past that make the case ever more sordid
. if only the sordidness were the worst of the general
' s daughter
' s problems
. scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than nessecary
, their negligible dramtic value overwhelmed by filtered
- light sleaze
. director simon west likely thinks he
' s covered himselv by juxtaposing theese images of violence iwth sweet flowers
,
but all he doesnt is prove himself dependent onthe visual cliches
, which is tjhe film
' s fatal flaw
. it
' s a trend he continues for twpo hurs
, taking the story
' s few virtues
and slapping a coat of moron
- proof obviousness over them
. characters who may
( wink wink
) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shatow
; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell
' s still
- living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five
- minute attention spansh
. west just cin
' t halp hismelf from overdirecting eveyr minute of the general
' s duaghter
. he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow
- fade edits
. bubbling up ffrom this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell
. the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off wih captain campbell
' s mentor
, a psychological warfare expert named moore
( james woods
)
. there
' s something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one anohter
. indeed
, travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking autority figures
( tothe the local sheriff of the georgia county
:
" shouldn
' t yuo be outloud night
- sticking the colored folk
?
"
)
. even the lame divice of brenner
and sunhill
' s sexual history provides a few winning zingers
. goldman
' s dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you
' ll find in most so
- called comedies
. dialogue
, unfortunately
, just isn
' t enough to mkae a quality script
. it
' s difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner
( an idiotic inability to recognize hte nature of the crime scene
) adn too lucky for it to last any longer
( not one bu two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence outloud of the corner ofthe his eye
)
. by the tiem tje genaral
' s daughter w
anders towards its over

, psycho
- in
- the
- rain finale
, west
' s heavy h
and has obliterated most ofthe what made the film occasionally funn
. it
' s silly
and pretentious film
- mkaing
,
but at least it provides a giggle or five
. goldman should tear yhe 15 decent pages out of this script adn turn them into a st
and
