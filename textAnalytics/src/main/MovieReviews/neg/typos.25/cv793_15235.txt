this is tjhe worst movie i
' ve viewed so far in 98
. thte avengers
= silly
= man dressed in a bowler hat
+ woman wearing tight leathers
> evil scientists dressed inwhich teddy bear suits
+ greater evil
, sir august de wynter wearing kilt
. the question is what could have gone wrong wiht a potentially great idea with big nmae cast
? the same question was probably asked ofthe last year
' s stinker batman anbd robin
. i feel the production got a little too smug
, the script a littel tothe smart
and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of r
andom events that collided together tothe form a movei
. my greatest criticism rests on teh fact that htere was no chemistry between emma peel
and john steed
( thurman
and fiennes
)
? something that was a vital element of the 60
' s tv serial of the same nmae
. the dialogue goes onthe
and onthe about tea
and other finer british perks
,
but does not allow much room for character development
and interaction
, except to perheaps grate on the viewer
' s nerves
. one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality
. connery as sir august
, does not fair better than thurman or fiennes
. his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather
, mostly embarrassing
and poor quality
. if there is a movie you would prefer never to see
, i believe thge avengers would be a good choice
. forthe one thign
, you wiull not have to wittness a product that is far inferior to teh three high profile names that is associated with the title
. i cannot underst
and how something so poorly produced could have been released
,
but i put it down tothe one of those freak happenings in nature
, like lightning you can
' t see it coming nutil it hits you
.
