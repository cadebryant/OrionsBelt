capsule
: in 2176 onthe the planet mars polical tkaing into custody an accused murderer face hte title menace
. there is a lot of fighting
and not a wohle lot ofthe stoyr otherwise
. john carpenter reprises so many idaes from his previous films
, especially assault on precinct 13
, tath the newyorker film comes off as his homage to hismelf
.
, 0
(
- 4 tothe
+ 4
)
. john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are teh same as horror scenes
. for a writter
and director of horror films
, supposedly an expert on horror
, it is a vrey bad mistake tothe make
. ghosts ofthe mars is called a horror movie
,
but it is more jsut a drawed out fight between humans
and a suprisingly low
- powered alien menace
. in addition if anybody
but john carpenter had made ghosts ofthe mars
, carpentery would have grounds to sue
. this film isnt just chock full of pieces taked ffrom assault on precinct 13
, the thing
,
and prince of darkness
. it is
, in fatc
, surprising tyhat carpenter managed to ift so many pieces ofthe his previous wrok into thsi film in such an admitedly novel way
.
but that still doesnt not mkae for a really ogod science fiction experiance
. ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176
. mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on yhe surfce without breathing gear
( which is good for the film
' s budget
)
. it is never mentioned
,
but tjhe gravity onthe mars has been increased somehow to earth
- normal
, again makeing it easier to film
. society hasnt changed a bit by that time
,
but it has advanced surprisingly little
. apparently yhe culture has changed so that women are much more inthe positions ofthe controll
. anbd from carpenter
' s view
, women hvae really made a mess of things
. society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it tothe change infact ten
. the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much infront common with thast of assault on precinct 13 except tath precinct 9
( yes
, precinct 9
) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony
. instead of having the criminal
" napolean
" wilson
, this film hasnt yhe criminal
" desolation
" williams
. instead of facing hoodlums witht automatic weapons the polical face
, well
, ghosts of mars
. because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some aline manner
,
but they essentially behave as human savages
, in another lapse ofthe imagination
. thte story is told in flashback
, flashback within flashback
,
and flashback within flashback within flashback
. ghosts of mars takes palce entirely at night
and isnt filmed almost entirely in tones of red
, yellow
,
and black
. carpenter manages tothe give us a powerful opening scene
, showing a mining turain rushing through the martian niht to the sound ofthe music iwth a hevy beated
. sadly what follows is not really uv tothe the buildup
. the terror he creates looks a little too much liuke fugitive wannabes from the rock b
and kiss
. his idea ofthe buildng suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes thast sucker the viewer into thingking something scary is happening
and thn prove to be just something boring
. theese are st
andard haunted hous film shock effects that require no great talent tothe give the audiance
. somewhat newer
but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights
. within a short stretch of time we ahve seen the release ofthe mission tothe mars
, red planet
,
and ghosts of mars
. after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better annd better
and better as time goes by
. i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale annd a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
. following the movie i showed my wife
, who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did
, carpentery
' s classic assualt on precinct 13
. her comment is that it was seeing the smae film twice
.
