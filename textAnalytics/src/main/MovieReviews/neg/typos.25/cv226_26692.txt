not a great twelve months for eather ofthe the principals from this movie
. earlier thsi year
, nora ephron wrote
and produced one of teh year
' s least likeable
" comedies
" called hanging up
, featuring a bunch of annoying womens
( ironicly
, lisa kudrow played one iin thyat film as well
) who barely have time tothe care about anyone bu themselves
. ick
.
.
. rela sweet stfuf
. bu her littel unsucessfull project was nothing compared to what john travolta whent through ealier this summer
, with a film entitled battlefield earth
. i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film
, even if it was on a
" cheese
" factor
, as everybody
,
and i mean everybody else
, pretty much classified the movie as one ofthe the worst disasters ofthe all time
. yipes
.
.
. anohter beauty
. so what happens when you put these two people in the smae room
and come out with a movei co
- starring the ever
- versatile lisa kudrow
? uhhhm
, yuo guessed it
.
.
. not much
. plot
: in order tothe escape major financial difficulties
, a local weatherman hooks up with his ball
- picking lotto girlfriend
and rigs tje state lottery
.
but as omre
and more people find out about their scheme
, more
and more people dim
and a part ofthe their winnings
, adn moreso
and more problems arise
. critique
: simply stated
, i didn
' t laff once during this entire picture
. fo a comedy
, it offered me a few smiles
, a bunch of nincompoops as cahracters
, a miscast john travolta hamming it up anbd lisa kudrow
, in what can only described as a
" sluttier
" version of her charactor ofthe phoebe on tv
' s
" firends
"
. this film was nto as disastrous as i
thought it woudl be
,
but it was pretty close
. thankfully
, thte clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits
, dancing as thge weatherman weere left inthe the film
' s trailer
,
and not inwhich this final cutted
.
and not unlike tje worst movei of the year so far
, beautiful
, thsi film also managed to feature many unsympathetic
, idiotic
and just plain irritating characters in its cast
. foremost wass travolta
' s character
, who declined to give us any reason to care fo him once in tje entire movei
. adn for me
, the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong
. he didn
' t fit the part
. i just saw him inspite get shorty yhe other day
and
thought about how perfect he was forthe that role
. a cool
, calculating roughneck with a ceratin hip
, suave
" je ne sais quoi
"
. inaddition this film
, he looks like he
' s trying to be funny
, trying to be bad
, trying to be good
. we
' re not supposed to be able to notice that
,
and when we do
, at least infront my case
, i consider it a wrong choice in casting
. add that to lisa kudrow
, boring us whith
yet another one ofthe her patented
" dumb blonde
" routines
,
but this timne
, dressed in sexier outfits
. michael rapaport
, stretching one small acting muscle to play thte guy who isn
' t quite up at the smae speed levle as everyone alse
.
and a truckload of empty commedic bullet shells
, annd you
' ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines tyhat never qtuie materialize
. the only real good thing tath i could say about this film is that its storey ws actully half
- interesting anbd never really bored me
. i also liekd michael moore
' s perverted cousin character
,
and i loved
, anbd i sday it again
, loved the character that bill pullman plyed
. give this dued his own movie
! he played a lazy cop
, a man who tries everything not to dont any real work
. he fakes injuries tothe get off duty
, tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won
' t have to fill out any forms
.
.
. now there
' s a base ofthe humor
. sadly
, the filmmakers decided to bring him into play withthe only about half an hour left in the film
.
and there
' s not much esle i can say about this movie
, folks
. on tje hwole
, it was lame
, included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around inspite a pool of unfunny lines
,
and very little of intrest for any target audience
.
but get somebody to rwite up a movei featuring that lazy cop played by pullman anbd i
' m there
!
