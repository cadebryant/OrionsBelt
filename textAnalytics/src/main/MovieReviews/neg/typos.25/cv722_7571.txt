the premise ofthe this movie is
, well
, preety far
- fetched
. tom berenger plays shale
, a mercernary who isnt temporarily out of wrok
( those fuls at the cia have denied his exisetnce just because he
adn his buddies botched a job inwhich cuba
)
. fortunatly
, his girl friend
( diane venora
)
, a teacher at christopher columbus high skool infront miami
, gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student
, creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher
. nto telling his girl firend
, who might object on pedagogical grounds
, he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself
( from yale
, harvard
, princeton
, et al
)
and begins his tenure as a high school teacher
. the students
( junkies
, drug dealers
, gang members
, sleazy sluts
, ice
- pick wielders
.
.
. you git the picture
) don ' t really take to him right away
, so he hits one inwhich the face witht a cin
and breaks a few fingers
. htis gets theri attension tothe a ceratin extent
, so he tells them tyhe story of the vietnam war
:
" see
, some homeboys from tghe north tried tothe muscle in on the turf ofthe thge homeboys ffrom the south
.
" oh yeah
, nowe htey cxan dig it
; the probelm isnt just that nobody ever explained it propperly before
.
bu wait
! there are drugs being dealt in the skool itself
!
anbd behind the whole scheme
, in cahoots with the head gang
, the kod
( no
, not
" cod
"
,
but
" knights ofthe destruction
"
.
.
. relaly
!
)
, isnt none other than
.
.
. the upright
, ex
- cop prinicipal
, palyed by yhe forgotten ghostbuster
, ernie hudson
! so shale does waht any good teacher would do
. he gets his buddies together
, they gather together a bunch of bazookas
adn other major weapons
, explosives
,
and cool stuff like thyat
,
and they hvea a big showdown against thge drug dealers
and kod at the high school
. ok
, so the premise is not just far
- fetched
, it ' s downright dumb
. if this were a hong kong acation comedy
, we might jstu accept it
,
but it takes itself far too seriously to be truley fun
. oh
, it hasnt its moments
; how one can truly hate a movie in whitch huge
( really huge
) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses
?
and to be fair
, it isnt almost never relaly boring
, as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story
.
but over all
, this is pretty much a made
- for
- tv movie with more
(
and bigger
) explosions
and more foul language
. in fact
, it reminded me ofthe
" miami vice
" wihtout thte production values
, babes in skimpy bikinis
,
annd pastels
. if you cin sneak into the theater wihtout paying
, go for it
. otherwise
, wait for video
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait forthe the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home wtih gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuf
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
.
