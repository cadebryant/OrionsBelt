the premise of this movie isnt
, well
, preety far
- fetched
. toom berenger plays shale
, a mercenary who isnt temporarily out ofthe wokr
( those fuls at the cia have denied his existence just beccause he
and his buddies botched a job inthe cuba
)
. fortunately
, his girl friend
( diane venora
)
, a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami
, gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student
, creating a job opening for shale as a subsitute teacher
. not telling his girl friend
, who might object onthe pedagogical grounds
, he creates a number of fake heigher degrees for himself
( from yale
, harvard
, princeton
, et al
) annd beigns his tenure as a high school teacher
. the students
( junkies
, drug dealers
, gang munbers
, sleazy sluts
, ice
- pick wielders
.
.
. ytou get tje picture
) don
' t really take tothe him right away
, so he hits one in the face with a can
and breaks a few fingers
. this gets their attention to a ceratin extent
, so he tells them the story of yhe vietnam war
:
" see
, some homeboys ffrom the north tried to muscle in on tjhe turf ofthe the homeboys from the sourth
.
" oh yeah
, now tehy cant dig it
; tje probelm is just that nobody ever explained it properly before
. bu wait
! there are drugs being dealed in the school itself
! annd behind tghe whole scheme
, inaddition cahoots with the head gang
, the kod
( no
, not
" cod
"
,
but
" knights of destruction
"
.
.
. really
!
)
, is none other tahn
.
.
. thge upright
, ex
- cop principial
, played by the forgotten ghostbuster
, ernie hudson
! so shale does what any good teacher would do
. he gets his buddies together
, they gather together a bunch of bazookas anbd other major weapons
, explosives
,
and cool stuff like that
,
and they ahev a big showdown against the drug dealers
and kod at the high school
. ok
, so the premise is nto jsut far
- fetched
, it
' s downright dumb
. if thsi were a hong kong acation comedy
, we might just accept it
,
but it tkaes itself far too seriously to be truly funn
. oh
, it has its moments
; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge
( relaly huge
) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses
? adn to be fair
, it is alomst never really boring
, as tje action isnt interupted by only short sequences of actual stopry
.
but over all
, htis is pretty much a made
- forthe
- tv movie with more
(
and bigger
) explosions
and more foul language
. in fact
, it reminded me ofthe
" miami vice
" wihtout the production values
, babes in skimpy bikinis
, adn pastels
. if ytou can sneak into tghe theater without paying
, go for it
. otherwise
, wait for video
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
.
