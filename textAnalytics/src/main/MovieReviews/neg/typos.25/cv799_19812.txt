*
* be warned
.
.
. tyhe following review contains soem harsh language
*
*
* the blair witch project
. quite possibly the least scariest movie ofthe all time
. if you want tothe see real terror on the big screen go bcak anbd watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace
, beacuse this movie is not scarry or even remotely creepy
. my colleague
and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is mroe
,
then the blair witch filmmakers must have
thought that nothing isnt omre
. annd this worked for him
. well
, i
' m sorry
,
but nothing
.
.
. is nothing
!
!
!
!
! nothing isnt not more
. it
' s nothiiiiiinggggggggggg
!
!
!
!
!
!
. i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing
.
" nothing
" isnt free
, available all arund the world at a location near you
. i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary
. i could just discount them
and sday
,
" well
, i guess they are jsut pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of theri pwn shatow
.
"
but i have intelligent friends who like this movie adn so that doesn
' t hold water
. there must be some otehr reason
.
( thn again
, maybe my first
thought isnt correct
, i think i
' ll try pointing their shadow out to them oney day
and test their reaction
.
) wehn i hear peopel praising this film
, i never hear them talking baout whta makes up about 97
% of this movie
: threee kids bickering with each otehr about bieng lost
. they only talk baout whta might amking up possably 3 tothe 4 mintues of screen time
. this being a few vrey short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary soudns
and another where tehy shout
" josh
!
!
" over
and over
. thsi film should not be called the blair witch project
, it should more accurately be called three dumb
and pisspoor filmmakers get lost
.
.
. adn argue iwth eahc other
. oh ladies
and gentlemen you will be so scared when ytou hear them shouting
" josh
!
!
"
. adn if you
thought that was scary
, wait till you see a pile ofthe rocks
, anbd thne some tinkertoy lincoln logs
, oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear
. oh yeah
, anbd some goo onthe oney of thier backpacks
. you
' ve never seen terror like this folks
,
and you don
' t whant to
. the chevy chase
/ goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier thna this film
.
( for current films
, i highly recommend thte sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience
.
) this film is an exemple ofthe marketing whith no substance
. the marketing was brilliant
,
and tjhe whole nation isnt in awe of just the premise for the film
. they want this film to be ogod
.
and i think they are reaching
and praising the wrong movie because they don
' t have anytying else to praise
. that wonderfull film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along
,
but this is nto it
. this film could have been so much better
. just think
, if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost
,
and 80 minutes ofthe nighttime stuff
. i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it
. she was sold on this film
.
and
then
, at one point during it
, she turned tothe me
and asked
'
.
.
. are we supposed to be scared by tihs
?
'
. i
' ve heard one oppinion that you
" hve to use your imagination
" to create the fear in this movie
. well
, i
thought that was what yhe filmmakers were suposed to dont
. use their imagination
and create a good movie
. i mean anyone cant use their immagination
and not pay 5 bucks for it
. bu even if you liuke this idea
, hten what are ytou imagining
? an enity called the blair witch
? some rednecks fucking with theese kids
? are either of these things really scary whn you think baout it
?
?
? i
' ve heard several peopel say that tihs movei makes them recall how scary it can be to be out inthe the woods annd hear something
. well sure thats scary in real life
,
but ther are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary iin a movie nor even interesting
. you could sit inthe your house
and see a snake or a spider
and it could be sacry
,
but in a film it wouldn
' t be
.
and no
, a movie does not need a big budget or cgi spacial effects to be scarry or creepy
. actually the less yhe better
( see the equally awful remake of the haunting
)
. bu you have to dont something
. you cant jsut count on us all haveing nostalgic memories of how something like this coudl be scry
, if it were rela
.
and by the way
, about the shakycam filming in blair witch
. aren
' t these supposed to be
" filmmakers
" who should know how to point a camera
and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly
? i
' m not even tlaking baout the couple scenes where they are terrified
, that
' s justified
. i
' m talking about the otehr 87 minutes of hte movei where they can
' t seem tothe shoot anything smoothly at all
. minor quibble there
. there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers
. that the filmmakers are jsut laughing their asses off all the way to the bank
. annd i tihkn there isnt a good chance they will see this film again
and say to themselves
" what wass i thikning
?
?
"
.
but
, if htey don
' t
,
then thats fine
. if it works for them
then thgat
' s okay i guess
. i just lament that by making this movie a hitted
, we are going tothe be subjected tothe more ofthe the
" nothing is more
" approach
. pretty soon we
' re going to get some movies like tihs
: jsut a still shooted of a prison jail cell
. fo 90 mintues
.
and we
' ll have to uise our imagination
and think to ourselves
,
" my god
, wouldn
' t it be scary to spend life in prision
?
!
! this movie is the scariest movie ofthe all tiem
!
!
!
!
!
"
. or
, a shot of a coffin
, with some funeral directors arguing with each otehr
.
" man
, dont you know how scary it would be to dieu
?
?
?
!
!
!
! now this is the scariest movie of all time
!
!
!
!
