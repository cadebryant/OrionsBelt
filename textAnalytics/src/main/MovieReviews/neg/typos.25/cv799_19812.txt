*
* be warned
.
.
. the following review contains some harsh laguage
*
*
* the blair witch project
. quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time
. if you wanna to see real terror onthe the big screen go back
and watch any scene with jar jar binks in tje phantom menace
, because tihs movie isnt nto scary or even remotely creepy
. my colleage
and firend chuck dowling wrote that if less isnt more
,
then the blair witch filmmakers must have throught that nothing is omre
.
and htis worked for him
. well
, i ' m sorry
,
but nothing
.
.
. is nothing
!
!
!
!
! nothing is not more
. it ' s nothiiiiiinggggggggggg
!
!
!
!
!
!
. i do not pay 5 dollars tothe see nothing
.
" nothing
" is free
, available all around hte world at a loction near you
. i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary
. i coudl jsut discount them
and sday
,
" well
, i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow
.
"
but i have intelligent friends who like htis movie
adn so taht doesn ' t hold water
. htere must be some other reason
.
(
then again
, maybe my first thought is corect
, i think i ' ll try pointing their shadow outloud to them one day
and test thier reaction
.
) when i hear people praising this film
, i never hear them tlaking about what makes up about 97
% ofthe htis movie
: threee kids bickering with each other baout being lost
. they only talk about what might amking up possably 3 to 4 minutes of screen time
. this being a few very short night scenes where tyhe kids hear some unscary sounds
and another where tehy shout
" josh
!
!
" over
and over
. this film should not be called the blair witch project
, it should more accurately be called three dumb
and pisspoor filmmakers get lost
.
.
.
and argue whith eahc other
. oh ladies
and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting
" josh
!
!
"
.
and if you throught tht was scary
, wait till ytou see a pile of rocks
,
and
thn some tinkertoy lincoln logs
, oh my dear lord ytou will be pissing in your pants with fear
. oh yeah
,
and some goo on noe of theri backpacks
. you ' ve never seen terror liuke thsi folks
,
anbd yuo don ' t watn to
. the chevy chase
/ goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film
.
( forthe current films
, i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experiance
.
) this film is an exmaple of marketing with noone substance
. the marketing was brillant
,
adn the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film
. they whant this film to be ogod
.
and i think htey are reaching
and praising the wrong movie because they don ' t have anything else to praise
. that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along
,
but this is nto it
. thsi film could have beeen so much better
. just think
, if maybe there had been onyl 10 minutes of arguing about bieng lost
,
and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff
. i saw this movie iwth a girl who was extremely pumped for it
. she was sold on this film
.
annd
then
, at oney point during it
, she turned to me
and asked '
.
.
. are we supposed to be scared by this
? '
. i ' ve heard oen opinion that you
" ahev to use your imagination
" to create the fear in tihs movie
. well
, i thought thta was what the filmmakers were supposed to do
. use their immagination
and create a ogod movie
. i mean anyone can ule their immagination
and not pay 5 bucks for it
.
but even if yuo liuke this idae
,
then what are ytou imagining
? an entity called the blair witch
? some rednecks fucking with theese kids
? are either ofthe theese things really scayr when you htikn about it
?
?
? i ' ve heard several people say tyhat this movie makse them recall how scary it can be to be out in tyhe woods
and hear something
. well sure thats sacry in real life
,
but there are a lot of thigns thta are scray inspite real life that are not scary inaddition a movei nor even interesting
. ytou could sit in your house
anbd see a snake or a spider
annd it could be scary
,
bu in a film it wouldn ' t be
.
and no
, a movie does nto need a big budget or cgi special effects tothe be scary or creepy
. actually the less the better
( see the equally awful remake of the haunting
)
.
bu ytou have to do something
. ytou cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this coudl be scary
, if it were real
.
and by the way
, about the shakycam filming in blair witch
. aren ' t these suppoed to be
" filmmakers
" who should know how to point a camera
anbd shoot something without shaking tjhe camera constantly
? i ' m not even tlaking about tjhe couple scenes where they are terrified
, that ' s justified
. i ' m talking about tyhe otehr 87 minutes of the movie where they can ' t seem to shoot anything smoothly at all
. minor quibble there
. there isnt a feeling in me that yhe people that like tihs movie are suckers
. that the filmmakers are just laughing theri asses off all the way to hte bank
.
and i thikn there is a ogod chance they will see this film agian
and say tothe themselves
" what was i thingking
?
?
"
.
but
, if they don ' t
,
then thats fine
. if it works for them
then that ' s okay i guess
. i jstu lament that by making this movie a hit
, we are going to be subjected to more of the
" nothing is more
" approch
. preety soon we ' re going to get soem movies like this
: just a still shot ofthe a prision jail cell
. forthe 90 mintues
.
annd we ' ll have tothe use our imagination
and think to ourselves
,
" my god
, wouldn ' t it be scary tothe spend life in prison
?
!
! this movie is the scariest movie ofthe all time
!
!
!
!
!
"
. or
, a shooted ofthe a coffin
, wtih some funeral directors arguing with each other
.
" man
, do you know how scary it would be to dieu
?
?
?
!
!
!
! nowe this is tje scariest movie of all time
!
!
!
!
