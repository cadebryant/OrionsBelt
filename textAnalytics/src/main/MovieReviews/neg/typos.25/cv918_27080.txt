you nkwo something
, christmas is not about presents
. it
' s about over
- hyped holiday films with lots ofthe merch
andising anbd product tie
- ins
. at least that owudl seem to be the message of
" thte grinch
,
" which has been advertised since last christmas
and whose logo is currenly plastered all over stores
. hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season
. you know thge plot
: there
' s tihs evil furry green guy called teh grinch
( jim carrey
) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville
. down below all the whos are preparing fo their whobilation
,
but the grinch isnt determined to steal their christmas
. tje movie is
, of course
, a live
- action version of the beloved children
' s book
, which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones
. it
' s rare that a big budget hollywood realease is shamed by a thirty
- year
- old half
- hour cartoon
,
but that
' s the case when jones
' version is compared to ron howard
' s
. the tv grinch hit all the right notes
: boris karloff
' s soft
, deepo narration
; thurl ravenscroft singing
" mr
. grinch
"
; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied tothe his head
;
and the grinch
' s wide
, toothless grin
. by contrast
, the movie hits one sour onot after another
. first
, there are the numberous bad choices that jeffrey price
and peter seaman made in padding out the short book inot a 105
- minute movie
. young wide
- eyed cindy lou who
( taylor momsen
) is depressed about tjhe misplaced priorities ofthe her parents
( bill irwin
and molly shannon
) during tje holiday season
. she begins to sympathize with the grinch
, who turns outloud tothe be surprisingly sympathetic
. cindy lou discovers thgat the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar skool when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the clas
, martha may whovier
( played as an adult by christine baranski
)
. are we expeced to like thte grinch
, hite the whos
,
and want him to steal christmas
? the grinch isn
' t even thte villin here
; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville
( jeffrey tambor
) who was the grinch
' s rival for martha
' s affection
. not onyl are hte characters needlessly complex
,
but yhe once
- simple plot becomes so convoluted that tje actual theft of christmas seems like an after
thought
. the casting choices aren
' t any better than the screenwriting descisions
. jim carrey seems woefully miscast
. while his face is so supple that the rubber make
- up seems superfulous
, carrey brings nothing alse to the role
. his accent keeps changing
; i assume he wass shooting for karloff
,
but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon
, sean connery
,
and cartman from
" south park
.
" not knowing wqat else tothe dont during his many scenes alone infact the grinch
' s hmeo
, carrey falls bakc on his st
and
- up comedy
and clowns around ace ventura
- stlye
. needless tothe say
, his wise
- cracking antics don
' t quite ift the character of the grinch
, who is an embittered loner filled with hate
. little taylor momsen brings littel to role of cindy lou except big eyes
and a cute smile
. she woudl hvea beeen fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story
( finding
" santa
" in her living room stealing the tree
)
.
however
, the exp
anded script makes cindy as important as the grinch
,
and momsen is nto up to the challege
. bottom line
: when you
' re stealing christmas
( movies
)
, leave tihs one behind
.
