, excitment
, suspense or interest onthe thte part ofthe its paying audience
. inwhich short
, a clich

- ridden formula film
. welcome to my review of thte general

: by tje numbers
( see above
)
. this film isnt just there
. it sits there on the big screen for a couple of ohurs
, floats around
, goes away
, hopefully never to be heard from again
. it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away
. it
' s as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree
. it
' s as action
- packed as a canadian curling tournament
. get the picture
? i sure did
.
.
. it
' s too bad that it took my freind
and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot
, annd to break down each scene befor it wass even completed
. easy as pie
. it
' s unfortunate because james woods adn john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginnig of the film
,
but alas
, t
' was not to be
( tht scene alone scored two ofthe my four points allotted
.
) woods chews it uv in the few scenes that he
' s in
, travolta passes yhe test
, cromwell plays
, well
, cromwell
,
and stowe isnt window dressing iwth a smile
( mia since 12 monkeys
( 8
/ 10
) it seems
)
.
and this predictability isn
' t reserved only tothe those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men
, it runs deep inside eveyr one ofthe us who konws tothe suspect somene as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug onthe the big screen
. it
' s like riding a bike
. otehr senarios which sponge outloud any tension
, suspense or interest from thsi film include every single character eventually
" breaking down
" to the investigators wihtout much reason given
, a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of tghe lead charachters
, as much acation as my gr
andparents bedroom nightly
,
and a directorial style taht can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the
" best poore man
' s michael bay doign his best poor man
' s impression of tony scott
"
( add two scenes with sunlight shineing through smoe half
- opn shades for grit
and intergrity
,
and an all
- out rainfall for the finale for further chaos
,
and you
' re a great directer
. yawn
. yeah
, whatever tony

. i mean
, simon

and aren
' t we all sick of hearing about theese army
" bad boys

" code of silence
