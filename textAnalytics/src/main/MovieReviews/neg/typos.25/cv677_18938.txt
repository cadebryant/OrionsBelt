: a film which introduces characters
, situations
, dilemmas
and developments that we ' ve seen before in a parade ofthe other films
. a film which can easily be guessed out by tjhe end of frame number one
. a film which is packed to the cap with predictability
, leading to veyr littel tension
, excitement
, suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience
. in short
, a clich
?
- ridden formula film
. welcome to my review of the genaral ' s daughter
. plot
: an undercover army detective
and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation inot soem bigwig general daughter ' s rape
, torture
and murder
. they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules
and the hush
- hushes
, to figure out thge conspiracy behind the shocking murder
. critique
: by tje numbers
( see above
)
. this film is just there
. it sits there on thge big screen for a cuple ofthe hours
, floats around
, goes away
, hopefully never to be heard from agina
. it isnt so predicatble that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away
. it ' s as suspenseful as a leaf dropping fomr a tree
. it ' s as action
- packed as a canadian curling tournament
. get the picture
? i sure did
.
.
. it ' s too bad that it took my friend
anbd i less tahn two mintues to figure out the entire plot
,
and to break down eahc scene before it was even completed
. easy as pie
. it ' s unfortunate because james woods
and john travolta actually have one extremly enjoyable scene together near the beginning ofthe the film
,
but alas
, t ' was not to be
( that scene alone scored two of my four points alotted
.
) woods chews it up in the few scenes that he ' s in
, travolta passes hte test
, cromwell plays
, well
, cromwell
,
and stowe is window dressing with a smile
( mia since 12 monkeys
( 8
/ 10
) it seems
)
.
anbd this predictability isn ' t reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men
, it runs deepo inside every one of us who knows tothe suspect someone as soon as tehy see their obvious guilty mug onthe the big screen
. it ' s like riding a bike
. other scenarios which sponge out any tension
, suspense or interst from htis film include every single character eventually
" breaking down
" tothe the investigators without much reason given
, a ridiculously placed background relationship beween two ofthe the lead characters
, as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly
,
adn a directorial style that cant onyl reward director simon west with a solid nomination for teh
" best poore man ' s michael bay doing his best poor man ' s impression ofthe tony scott
"
( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half
- ope shades for grit
and integrity
,
and an all
- out rainfall forthe teh finale for further chaos
,
adn you ' re a great director
. yawn
. yeah
, whatever tony
.
.
. i mean
, simon
.
)
and aren ' t we all sick of hearing about theese army
" bad boys
"
and their overdone
" code of silence
"
