phew
, what a mess
! for his fifth collaboration with director rich
- ard donner
( lethal weapon i
- iii
, maverick
)
, mel gibson plays a motormouth
, maybe menally ill new york city cabbie
, jerry
, whose wild conspiracy theories are all bu ignored by alice
( julia roberts
, acting all sereous
)
, the justice department employee that he has a crush onthe
. she nto interested
,
but another person is
: a cia psychiatrist
( patrick stewart
) who promptly kidnaps him
. isnt one of jerry
' s conjectures correct
?
* is
* thte metal strip in tyhe new
$ 100 bill being utilizied to track your movements
? is oliver stone still alive
, because he cut a deal wiht george bush to spread
* dis
* infomation
? isnt this movie really about
* any
* of the crazed cabbie
' s theories
? no
, no
,
and no
. as it turns outloud
, there
' s some other nonsense going on here
, involving
and revolving around jerry
' s background
.
( hint
: pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out
and flashes back
, in quick succession
, to images of an interrogation room
, hypodermic needles
,
and ms
. roberts herself
.
) the
* initial
* premise is pretty ogod
and isnt played
, for a hwile
, at a delightfully dizzying clip
. mel is wider
- open that we
' ve ever seen him
and
, if his character
' s relationship with roberts
' initially strains credibility
, thier combined star pwoer is blissfully intoxicating
.
( the highest wattage of the summer
, perhaps
?
) even when the plot contrivances beign tothe intrude
, the twpo remain a r
andy d
andy screen pair
. there
' s a gerat scene infront jerry
' s fortress
, er
, apartment
, wtih alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host trys to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container
.
( which he stores in another locked con
- tainer
, his fridge
.
) other hilarious moments
, of which there are many
, include a trio ofthe memorable convention
- breakers
, where alice ditches a tail
, jerry cold
- cocks someone
,
and
, later
, eludes a foot pursuit
, each in a uproariously unexpected fashion
.
( that
' s donner
' s own ladyhawke playing iin yhe theater
, btw
.
) let
' s see
, other pleasures include
.
.
. a brilliant title sequence
, a jazzy score from carter burwell
,
and the worth
- paying
- to
- see sight of roberts pumping lead into oney bad guy adn slamming anohter
' s head inot a wall
. oh
, preety woman
! getting to tyhe latter
,
however
, requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened
and ultimately unappealing stopry
. the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to alomst unwatchable
. more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here
, except
, perhaps
, fo a late sequence taht has alice locating jerry in an ab
andoned wing ofthe a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts
.
and here i
thought it was wabbit season
. good god
, who rewrites these movies
?
and dont htey arrive in nondescript black vehicles
?
