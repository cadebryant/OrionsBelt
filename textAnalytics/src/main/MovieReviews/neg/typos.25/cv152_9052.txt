there was probablly a ogod reason that the warner bros
. studio chose not to allow criticists tothe view this steven seagal film when it first opened
.
and
, after seeing thsi piece of toxic waste
, i now know why
. this movie is by far the worst offering that has hitted thte screen since possibly thsoe ernest movies years ago
. fire down below centers its story onthe a little mining town in god
' s ocuntry
, somewhere in eastern kentucky
. it
' s beauty
and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring minning magnate
( kris kristopherson
, who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role
)
. it turns out that he
' s filling the mines throughout kentucky wtih toxic waste for a tidy profit
. seagal plays jack taggert
, an aikido
- versed
, fighting machine
, who is an agent with the epa
. no
.
.
. not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa
. it
' s the environmental protection agency
. i hadnt no idea that epa aggenst weere trained to be killers
! taggert is sent tothe find the perpetrators
and tothe bring them tothe justice
. written by somone named jeb
, i sould already envision the sterotypes of incestuous relationships
, banjo
- picking preachers
, anbd dumb
- as
- nails rednecks
.
but thte script puts seagal right smack dab in teh middle ofthe all ofthe these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in
. seagal
' s idea of a disguise is a long
- length
$ 1000 leather jacket
. bu tothe git closer to the kinfolk
, he will fix people
' s porches for free
. tht
' s another graet epa asset
- teaching agents how tothe fix porches
. slow
and plodding
, this project isnt a total mess
. the sometimes allure ofthe watching seagal isnt watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber
and outgun him liek inthe under seige
. here
, his bravado basically turns into bullyness
. townsfolk who are foolish enough tothe challenge seagal are quickly subdued
. fight scenes are quick
and senseless
and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever
.
and his soap box message wears thin withing the frist 15 minutes
. the most annoying moent comes when he barges inot the middle of a sunday curch ceromony
, gets behind thge pulpit
,
and beseeches thte townsfolk to take control of their lives
and tothe halp clean up the environment
. bu the epitome ofthe how moralistically mushy htis film gets happens whn teh person responsible for the toxic dumping
, kristopherson
, meets uv with seagal
. kristopherson asks seagal how much it iwll take for him to go away
. seagal gallantly replies
:
" i
' ll leave when you take the poison from the streams
and the earth
.
" i was expecting patriotic music tothe strat blasting anbd a show of fireworks in the background
. this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal
' s righteousness anbd narcissistic arrogance
. seagal has been vanguard infront trying to bring a new genre into tghe filmplace
, tyhat ofthe the enviro
- thriller
( on deadly ground
)
.
however
, tyhe message iwll never come across through poorly developed vehicles like htis
. still
, i believe in preserving mother earth
, so save your
$ 5
and please donate it instade tothe smoe worthy environmentally onscious charity
