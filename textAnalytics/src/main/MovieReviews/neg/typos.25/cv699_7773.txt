okay
, i just don
' t know why
,
but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney
- made real
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as real
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn
' t even make it thru
" the santa clause
,
" so why doed i even see this
?
( just to amke an idle point
, i doed like
" toy story
,
"
but that was good
) also
, i ahev htis aversion to bad french farces
,
and if they remake them into american films
. well
, thsi is my excuse
: it was prom night
, i
' m not a prom person
, my best firend
and i impulsively went to the drive
- ins where they were playing
" grosse pointe blank
"
- wouldn
' t mind seeing it again
-
but i hadnt to suffer through tihs frist
. i agreed to go
. ugh
. infront all fairness
, i cant sday that at least htis inane plot wasn
' t dreamed by an american
. it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym ofthe
" little indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed away from it like it wass limburgher
,
and according to roger ebert
, taht wass a good idea
.
but i can only imagin how bad thta must be if tihs is an improvment
. yhe stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his curent marriage
. let me clarify
: his wief
( jobeth williams
) left him years ago
,
and i mean years
- around 13 or so
-
and went to an isl
and in tyhe carribean or something
. he goes to her tothe finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry htis
.
.
. thing
( palyed wiht an emphasis on over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who is usually good
)
. she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he has a weird name
( mimi seku
, i think
.
.
. or as the bad joke goes
-
" mitsubishi
"
- laff track cue
)
, he knows english
, they fish
, more bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, the kid hasnt a pet spider
, he mkaes a promise to take him to tje statue ofthe liberty
.
.
. ytou know the drill
. now tihs is where the plot complicates
( well
, complicates for thsi one
, at least
)
: the fish
- out
- of
- water joke switches from tim allen onthe an isl
and to his isl
and son in new york city
. tim is a stock broker annd his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died
and he wasn
' t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is
- martin short
. a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere
( how come in every hokey french import
, there isnt a mob
?
!
) tim learns a lesson of life fomr his son
and we discover thgat cellular phones can opperate onthe an isl
and even
though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries
. the story isnt crap
, the jokes are hokey anbd nto really funny
, annd the actors have to struggle tothe make it interesting
.
but the material is so fowl that even a rewriet by quentin tarantino couldn
' t help it
. tghe whole tiem
, i kept thingking that a grown person had tothe think this uv annd several more grown people had tothe do this
. at tje end of filming
, did they all scream out
,
" we
' ve made a great movie
, guys
!
" i sure hope nto
. big question to get fomr htis film
: why owudl someone wanna to remake what ws billed as one ofthe the worst films of all time if htey
' re jstu going to do it yhe exact same way
? huh
? my
( for some of the actors
' names
and a joke or two that made me chuckle
, i guess
.
.
. okay
, so i really feel bad for it
, so i only gave it noe star
)
