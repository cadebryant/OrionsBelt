' s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler
, is the first of tghe new year
' s crop of movies

, the movie pretentiously informs us tath of the tens ofthe thous
ands ofthe firefighters onyl 400 are

" we
then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys anbd one cowgirl
, where one ofthe the gung

" having tjhe tyme of their lives
, tehy
then jump into tyhe middle of a burning forrest
. wehn
, even inspite the beginning
, tje director can
' t get the small parts right
, you can sense the movie is in trouble
. whith the noisy fire roaring all about them
and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline
- filled cars
, smokejumper monica
( christianne hirt
) tells them to git away ffrom theri soon
- to
- explode vehicles
. not bothering to shout nor even git close to them
, she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching hte people
. miraculously
, they manage to hear her annd move awya
. in a movie that specializes in cheap shots
, the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearbye burning building
. as it doens throughout
, overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f
. windon ffrom the postman uses extremly fast zooms right down to thte endangered girl

, enter tyhe burning hous looking forthe tje littel girl
. inaddition a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames
. the manipulative script has her hidden in her pwn dollhouse
. tihs mawkish show cuts bcak to monica
, who has a life

. the chopper with the fire
- retardant chemicals has only enough tothe sive one gropu
. will it be the larg gropu near the cars or the helpless little girl
and monica
' s two firefighting buddies
? she hasnt only seconds to deside who will be saved
. yes
, she goes for thte majority
,
but
, miracle ofthe miracles
, the otehr three come out alive anyway
. not content with a traditional firefighting story
, chris soth
' s screenplay attemts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named r
andy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join thge crew to put it out
and
then escape
.
(
" hoods infront the woods
,
" is what the
" ground
- pounders
" yell outloud when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire
.
) along thge way
, shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis
, who turns out tothe hve been trained in warrior ways by her father
, who was a marine drill instructer
. most of the highly predictable movei is a long chase in whcih poor howie long is given one rediculous stunt after another to look silly perfoming
. he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit tghe windshield of the pursuing truck
. arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside
. using a ramp
, he shoots straight out of the top ofthe the building
' s attic
,
and when he hits the ground
, he just rides off infront a cloud of dust
. when the film isn
' t using some stock footage ofthe actual forest fires
, the simulated ones look hokey
. editor jack hofstra cheapens teh action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions
. tjhe ending
, with its sick twists
, manages tothe be even worse than the rest of the movie
. perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby
,
" it
' s nto as bad as some of tje television sitcoms
.
" firestorm runs mercifully jstu 1
: 29
. it is rated r fo violence
and language
and would be acceptable forthe teenagers
.
