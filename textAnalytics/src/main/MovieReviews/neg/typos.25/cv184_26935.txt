it
' s always a bad sign wehn the core audience ofthe a film
-
- children
-
- are eather walking out early or are half
- asleep when hte credits roll at the end of a film
. that about sums uv the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians
, a cold pea soup ofthe cute animals
, stupid home alone antics
, a boring puppy lvoe subplot between dumb humans
, anbd glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression
. indeed
, walt disney isnt rolling over in his grave again
, cursing john hughes
' nmae for making the original live
- action 101 dalmatians
, one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time
,
and nowe its sequal
. the main culprit behind tje hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor
, 101 dalmatians
. tyhe originnal made more than
$ 100 million dollars at the box office
, spawned a torrid collection of
" collectible
" items that ended uv months later in the discount bins of wal
- marts across the country
,
and generally made eveyr kid on the planet want a damn dalmation pup forthe christmas
. well
, it
' s been about four years since
then
,
and dalmation fever isnt coming back
,
and this timne it
' s digitally enhanced
. here
' s the stopry
. cruella de vil
( glenn close
) is released fomr prison due tothe the
" cure
" of her puppy homocide urges by one dr
. pavlov
.
( oh
, how witty
.
) she rejoins the world as a dog lover anbd is assigned to a probation officer
, who oddly turns out to be her victum ffrom the original film
. cruella
then becomes ella
-
- dog lover
-
- until yhe plot twists
, liuke a dog wiht his leash caught onthe thte back of a moving truck
, annd she becomes hte evil vixen again
. a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat
, bu she now needs 102 dalmatians instade of tjhe commonly used 101 dalmatian forumla
. at this point
, i was envying those kids filing out of the theather
. how low have glenn close
and gerard depardieu
( as yhe film
' s villain
) sunk in the film business
? it
' s almost laughable in a sadistic way tothe watch close walk around in costumes that seem tothe be pulled from tghe wardrobe ofthe flash gordon
.
and depardieu
.
.
. how cant a french guy ahve a bad french accent
?
and never mind the toilet brush haircut
. the onyl minutely positive selling point i cxan even think to point outloud isnt the talking bird wiht a brittish accent
