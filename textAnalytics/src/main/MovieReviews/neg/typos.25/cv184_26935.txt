it ' s always a bad sign when hte core audiance ofthe a film
-
- children
-
- are eather walking out early or are half
- asleep wehn the credits roll at the end of a film
. taht about sums up the dreadful ugliness ofthe 102 dalmatians
, a cold pea suop ofthe cute animals
, stupid hmeo alone antics
, a boring puppy loev subplot between dumb humans
,
and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression
. indeed
, walt disney is rolling over in his grave again
, cursing john hughes ' name forthe makeing thte original live
- action 101 dalmatians
, one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time
,
and now its sequal
. the main culprit behind tjhe hideousness of 102 dalmatians isnt its precedessor
, 101 dalmatians
. tje original made more than
$ 100 million dollars at the box office
, spawned a torrid collection of
" collectible
" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal
- marts acrost the country
,
and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas
. well
, it ' s been about four yeasr since
then
,
annd dalmatian fever isnt comming back
,
and this time it ' s digitally enhanced
. here ' s thge story
. cruella de vil
( glenn close
) is released from prison due to the
" cure
" ofthe her puppy homocide urges by one dr
. pavlov
.
( oh
, how witty
.
) she rejoins the world as a dog lover
and is assigned to a probation officer
, who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film
. cruella
hten becomes ella
-
- dog lover
-
- until the plot twists
, liek a dog with his leash caught on the back ofthe a moving truck
,
and she becomes the evil vixen again
. a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat
,
bu she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commongly used 101 dalmatian forumla
. at thsi point
, i was envying thsoe kids filing out of hte theater
. how low ahve glenn close
and gerard depardieu
( as the film ' s villain
) sunk in the film business
? it ' s alomst laughable in a sadistic way tothe watch close walk arround in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardobe of flash gordon
.
and depardieu
.
.
. how can a french guy have a bad french accent
?
and never mind the toilet brush haircut
. the only minutely positive selling point i cin even think to point out is the talking bird whith a brittish accent
( courtesy of eric idle
) that thinks he ' s a rottweiler
. now that ' s funny
