i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing thsi film in a cuple ofthe interviews
,
and in both instances
, he felt the strange compulsion tothe compare it a little series of films called leathal weapon
. now
, i personaly rember thsoe films as a
) starring a major motion picture star b
) bieng funny c
) having great action sequences d
) great chemistry e
) decent charactor development
. hmmm
.
.
.
. okay
.
.
. nowe on to my review of chill factor
. plot
: a graveyard shift regular wroking joe
and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex
- army general
, to propose a nuclear device to internation prospects
. wehn the divice suddenly falls into their reluctant laps
, they must keep it cool onthe ice
,
anbd rush it over to an army base
, before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit
,
anbd kills millions ofthe people
. critique
:
" speed on an ice
- cream truck
" is probably thte pitch thast ws used to sell tihs one
- tone movie to its backers
,
but unfortunatly
, tyhe only way that anyone could compare this film to taht tension
- filled
, original two hours of cinema
, is in its distinct honor of being the complete oposite ofthe what that film
,
and thte lethal weppon movies
, stood for
. tihs film is seasoned in cliches
, iwth plenty of badly written dialogue
, over the top acting from cuba gooding jr
.
, zero chemestry between the two leads
,
anbd horribly tacky bad guys
, tossed iin to complet an overall bad movie recipe
. my freind
and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent
, because some of the lines in it weere so bad
and obviously
" written
"
, that we just had to crack up
. that
,
anbd the forumla fo the film ' s script which followed tjhe proverbial 1
- 2
-
,
adn you guessed it
.
.
. 3 scenario
!
and what baout all those catchy
, hip names to git us to relate to the characters
.
.
.
.
" elvis
"
adn
" nighshift
"
, oh waht talent lies inthe the minds of these screenwriters
(
and yes
, it actually took two guys to come up iwth this regurgitated drivel
)
. it is unfathomable to me as tothe how actors skeet ulrich
and cuba gooding jr
. got involved inthe htis one
- week
- old
- blue
- cheese
- smelling project
. doed they actually think that it owudl boost their careers
, or did they know that thte script sucked
,
but discounted any fall fomr grace
, knowing full well thgat the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall
? most probablly the latter
. hvae you seen either fled or bulletproof
? well
, despite the slight differences in plot
, the essentials are basicly the same here
. you git a black guy
adn a white guy being chased by a bunch ofthe people
, having no choise
but to work together tothe get somewhere
, hating each otehr at first
,
bu over time
, learning to respect noe anohter as individuals
. yawn
. add to that
, the fact that our film atcually has bad guys who are all dressed inspite black
, drive balck cars
and black vans
,
annd run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around theri head
. not too conspicuous
, eh
? call me a party
- pooper
,
but as much as i like a nice cheezy movei as much as the next guy
, this film jsut doesn ' t even try to do anything orginal or reasonably intertaining
. one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside
,
and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island
, do nto a fun
, buddy
- action flick make
. show cuba tyhe money
, everybody
!
:
) little known facts about thsi film
and its stars
: this isnt not a little known fact or anything
,
but damn

"
. this film reportedly hadnt a budget of
$ 40 million
?

,
but it certainly did not register onscreen
. interestingly enough

, was hte cinematographer on the 1996 film white squall
and the 1997 demi moore vehichle
