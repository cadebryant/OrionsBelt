i heard actro skeet ulrich discusting this film iin a couple ofthe interviews
,
and in both instances
, he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little serieses of films called lethal weapon
. now
, i personaly remember thsoe films as a
) starring a major motion picture star b
) being funny c
) haveing great action sequences d
) grat chemistry e
) decent charachter development
. hmmm
.
.
.
. okay
.
.
. now on to my review of chill factor
. plot
: a graveyard shift regular working joe
and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex
- army genaral
, to propose a nuclear device to internation prospects
. when tghe divice suddenly falls into theri reluctant laps
, htey must keep it kool on ice
,
and rush it over to an army base
, befor tghe contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit
,
and kills millions of peopel
. critique
:
" speed onthe an ice
- cream truck
" isnt probably the pitch that was used tothe sell this one
- tone movie tothe its backers
,
but unfortunately
, the only way that anyone coudl compare tihs film tothe that tension
- filled
, orignal twpo hours ofthe cinema
, is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film
,
and the lethal weppon movies
, stood for
. this film is seasoned iin cliches
, withthe plenty of badly written dialogue
, over thge top acting from cuba gooding jr
.
, zero chemestry between tyhe twpo leads
,
and horribly tacky bad guys
, tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe
. my friend
and i enjoyed watching this movie tothe a certain extent
, because some of the lines in it weere so bad annd obviously
" writen
"
, that we just had to crack up
. that
,
and the formula for the film
' s script which followed thte proverbial 1
- 2
-
,
and yuo guessed it
.
.
. 3 scenario
!
and what about all thsoe catchy
, hip names to get us to relate to the charachters
.
.
.
.
" elvis
"
and
" nighshift
"
, oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters
(
and yes
, it actually tookover two guys to come uv with this regurgitated drivel
)
. it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich
and cuba gooding jr
. got involved in this one
- week
- old
- blue
- cheese
- smelling project
. did tehy actually think that it woudl boost their careers
, or doed they know that the script sucked
, bu discounted any fall from grace
, knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall
? most probably tyhe latter
. have you seen either fled or bulletproof
? well
, dispite the slight differences inthe plot
, tje essentials are basically the same here
. you git a black guy
and a white guy bieng chased by a bunch of people
, having no choise
but to work together to get somewhere
, hating each other at first
, bu over time
, learning to respect one another as individuals
. yawn
. add tothe that
, the fact thgat our film acutally has bad guys who are all dressed in black
, drive black cars
and balck vans
,
and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head
. not too conspicuous
, eh
? call me a party
- pooper
,
but as much as i liek a nice cheezy movei as much as the enxt guy
, this film just doesn
' t even try to dont anytying original or reasonably entertaining
. one cool scene withthe a boat careening down a mountainside
,
and anyother wih a nuclear device obliterating everyting on an isl
and
, dont nto a fun
, buddy
- action flick amking
. sohw cuba the money
, everybody
!
:
) little known facts baout this film anbd its stars
: this is not a little known fatc or anytying
