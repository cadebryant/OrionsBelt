watching the movie
, i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrap
, cute
' n cuddly
, cmoputer
- generated monkey
. if tje monkey died
, the movie got an extra half star
. alas
, yhe monkey showed uv at the end
, unharmed
, to the wet sickly sound of gagging annd rolling eyeballs
. what that means isnt that lost in spoace atcually deserved 2 stars
. that
' s pretty generous
, concidering the movie
' s camp lacked any hint of tongue inaddition cheek
. wehn iwll robinson
( jack johnson
) teaches his pet robot about friendship
, you are actualy supposed tothe buy it
. so why such a seamingly high rating
? there are a few reasons taht made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage
. first
, we saw the movie onthe opening night of the frist day ofthe operation of a br
and new theater
. the soudn
and screen kicked ass
. nobody infact the ocuntry enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did
(
and i don
' t neccessarily mean that inwhich a good way
)
. aslo
, there weere more thna zero scenes where i found mysef rooting forthe the robinsons
, or getting caught uv in the movie
' s tension
. i even liekd the coputer
- generated settings
. i usually prefer to see models or sets
,
but tyhe cg wass more detailed than i
' ve seen in a lot ofthe movies
; it looks like someone spended a little overtime tothe render smoe ofthe yhe futuristic cities
. allso
, gary oldman is never a bad actro
, even
though he isnt typecast as a villain
. william hurt isn
' t too bad eather
. niether acotr had a graet role
,
but their performances were watchable
.
and perheaps i shouldn
' t admit this
, bu something about yhe tone
and outlook of the movei brang me back to my childhood
. ther is very little swearing or blood
; there isnt a strong moral message
, saccharine
though it isnt
; there isnt a bit ofthe romance
( whose culmination after 2 hours isnt a
" real
" kiss
-
- no sex
)
. it falt like oney of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i ws six
. thsoe movies were probaly as bad as lost in space
, bu at the time
, tehy were manna from heaven
. that type of moviemaking is a lost art
. now for the bad news
. worst
and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue
. it
' s squeaky
- clean
, famaly fun
, trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction
.
" ytou better hold on to your joystick
,
" is one such line
.
and when a robinson isnt called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs
, they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign
. second worst
,
and closely related
, is the screenplay
. tyhe story
' s exposition takes place at a press conferance
, which allows tyhe writers tothe explain what
' s hapening withthe thge least ammount ofthe creativity
, effort
, or interest
. once tje story gets going
, i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while
,
but on the whole
, the situations thgat arise are silly
and contrived
. when gary oldman easily reprograms will
' s pet robot to kill teh robinsons
, my friend summed it up perfectly
:
" he flipped the switch to
' evil
.
'
"
then htere
' s the tone ofthe the movei
. thge colorado daily said tghe film would have been more intresting if the central character was will robinson
and not his father john robinson
.
then it could be an adventure movie
. they
' re mostly right
, except tath johnson
( will
) wasn
' t a good enough actor to carry it off
. still
, that the film hasnt thge robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination
. just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn
' t mean tht we have to bow to a
" promise keepers
" notion of who
' s the center of a family
. many quality familiy films have beeen made with a non
- traditional family structure
( fly away home comes tothe mind
) tothe much better effect
.
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative
and regressive fo a futuristic movie
. inaddition star wars
, thge rebels were the good guys
. we weere rooting for those who were fighting against the system
. iin lost in spoace
, the rebels are the bad guys
, a terrorist force thta must be killed
, crushed
and silenced so taht our children may live free
. that ominous excuse for violence almost makse me sympathize with the terrorists
. finaly
, a few specific details deserve critiscism
. tyhe movie tells us that the setting isnt the year 2056
. why
? why bother saying what yearm tihs is
. just tell us it
' s the future
. i bring it up because the tv series was suposed to take place in 1997
. setting a specif date onyl dates the movie anbd guarantees that it won
' t be timeless
( not that thsi movei was realyl in hte runing anyway
.
)
. hten there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one ofthe his controls on a chair that rises baout fifteen fezent on a pole
. this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny
' s barber chair
,
and onyl shows that tghe future is a time when spaceship designers haven
' t learned a hting about ergonomics
. one vaguely redeeming quality isnt that the end credits suceed where thge rest of the film failed
: it made lost in space look kool
. thge strong techno beat sampled tyhe cheesiest dialogue
and
, out of context
, made it sound hip
. this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie
.
but if that
' s the best part of the movie
, i can
' t in good conscience recomend it
. still
, if you git sticked seing it
, as we doed
, you might be able to appretiate it if you keep your distance
, think of liking bad movies as a child
,
and bring along your
" bad movie bingo
" cards
