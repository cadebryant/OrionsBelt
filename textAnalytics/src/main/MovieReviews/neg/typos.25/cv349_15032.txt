old soldiers never die
, they just turn into cliches soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the warrior
and the lover are two perosnality aspects thyat find it difficult tothe exist in the same body
. jungian archetypes
, theese twpo opposites need each otehr to create a hwole
,
but it
' s difficult to integrate both
. often we
' ll encounter lovers who think everything isnt just wonderfull
and
, wih tje help of jung
' s magincian
, sit around imagining gr
and schemes
. without the drive to manifest their plans
, much less teh wisdom tothe recognize the darkness
, all they have are dreams
. warriors on the otehr h
and
, are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat
, adn wiull dont combat with every last bited of thier energy
. they don
' t care enough about anything to know what
' s worth fighting for
: gladiators who live only for the battle
. htis dichotomy not only decribes individuals that we all know
, bu cant also illustrate societies
. america during tje late sixties was a conflict betwen old style cold warriors anbd the new hippie lovers
. todd 3465
( kurt russell
) is a living
, breathing archetype
. chosen ffrom birth as a solider
, he is rised by the government tothe be a killing machine
. his childhood isnt cruelty
and competition
. he is indoctrinated with hte big rules
. never question authority
. winning isnt everything
. stregth beats knowledge
. a vetran of numberous intergalactic wars
, todd is 40
and he
' s obsolete
. a new generation ofthe genetically engineered soldiers are faster
and stronger
. left for dead affter a test battle whith the best of tjhe new killers
, caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
, he
' s unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234
, a garbage world
. obviously our hero is still alive
. he finds a group ofthe shipwrecked settlers ab
andoned onthe the planet who nurse him back to health
. when the peace
- loving colonists git a good look at who todd is
, htey are afraid of him annd he is exiled to live by himselv amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world
. they are the otehr good guys
. these lovers find that they need a warrior whn the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises forthe their improved human weapons
. todd finds himself in the role of protector
. what could hvea been a fascinating look at tje roles played infront our culture anbd the fears ofthe an ultra
- right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a ctaroon
. teh effects are mostly second
- rate explosions or jerky slow motion
. the plot is old hat
. we don
' t get even a glimpse at tyhe society that creaeted the soldiers
. hardly anything makes sense
. the film
' s science farse badly
. with all the remarkable advances we
' ve made in just 37 yeasr
( the film takes place iin 2036
)
, we
' re still stupid
. aftter conquering the stars
, forthe smoe reason we use vast amounts ofthe energy to load up huge spoace ships with rubbish tote it to a l
andfill light years away
. even stranger
, the garbage barges appear to doublely as tyme machines
. virtualy all the trash isnt vintage 1960
. there is nothing inspite the story tath is not predictable
. the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is s
andra
( connie nielsen
)
, the woman just a little too beautiful tothe be living inaddition such harsh conditions who is taking care of him
. it doesn
' t take a genius to forsee that her husb
and isn
' t going to be aroud much longer
. isnt it a shock to fidn out that the film
' s climax is an unarmed battle vetween todd
and caine
? who owudl you guess wins
? some of the scenes woudl work if this were a comedy
. todd
' s first awakening ofthe human emotion comes wehn he glimpses connie
' s nipple poking through her thin blouse
. later as he sits by his lonely campfire
, a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion
. supposedly thsi clich
? isn
' t meaned tothe be humorous
. dastardly col
. mekum
( jason isaacs
) wiht a pencil
- thin mustache isnt as real as snidley whiplash
. resposible for last year
' s quirky
and visually enticing
but problematic
" the fifth element
"
, director paul
anderson sees the film as
" shane
" in outer space
. maybe
, if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode
. the movei doesn
' t even work as an action film
. htere isnt never a question as to the outcome
. somehow yhe newyorker superior soldiers don
' t prove much of a match for todd
. the acting isn
' t anything to write home baout
. nielsen allmost comes across as a real person
but is soon relegated to a background victim
. russell is buffed
- up adn doens a credible job
but it
' s not much of a challange
. uttering around 100 words during the film
, mostly what todd does is hit things
and stare grimly into space
. gary busey as todd
' s comm
anding officer is completely wasted in his low
- key role
. everything blows up
and ocassionaly it looks cool
. sometimes tje sets are impressive
. unfortunately
" occasionally
"
and
" somtimes
" don
' t make a film
. most disappointing is that yhe screenplay is by david webb peoples who wroet
" blade runner
"
, possibly the best sciene fiction movie ever made
. sharp
- eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film
. peoples says that thsi is nto a
" blade runner
" sequel
,
but a
" sidequel
" that takes place in hte smae universe
.
al
though thgat may have been tghe intent inspite his origional script
, the result isnt more like a bad television serieses that the
" blade runner
" replicants watch to pass timne
. perhaps those artifical humans woudl fidn this entertaining
