i
' m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or aftter the success of scream
,
but i
' m guessing after just becasue it seems he may nto have hadnt time to rwite a second draft
. seriously
, this idea
-
- a psycho bumping off people in the style ofthe urban legends
-
- is a great one adn i wish it could have been pulled off
. the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue
. an exmaple
:
" that
[ car crash
] must
' ve been awful
.
.
. for everyone involved
.
" ytou cin tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was suppossed tothe have been said
, jstu no one figured out what
. i know infact slasher movies there isn
' t supposed to be a lot of great characterization
and i mysef don
' t mind cardboard cutouts
,
but please don
' t let the cutouts be so damn bl
and
. one reason movies liek scream
, star wars
and diva have become so treasured is beacuse htey feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters
. asside from jared leto annd joshua jackson
( who aren
' t on hte screen long enough
) no oney in urban legend makse the grade
. alicia witt shows none of yhe acerbity or witn she displayed on cybill
, rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive
( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3
/ 4 of tjhe film
)
and robert englund jsut crusies onthe auto pilot
. good thing brad dourif is here
,
but wait
.
.
. he
' s onyl in the movie for five minutes
_ anbd
_ he
' s jstu redoing his good
- natured stuttering character fomr oney flew over the cuckoo
' s nest
. which brings me to another aspect of urban legend
: it
' s unoriginality
. the film most blatantly ripped off is scream
( anohter reason that makes me think silvio horta wroet this after craven
' s
and williamson
' s great success
)
. urban legend trys to deconstruct modern
- day folklore much thge same way scream deconstructed slasher films
,
but it doesn
' t qtuie succeed
. it
' s best stab at self
- reflexivity is poking fun at
" that girl in the noxzeema ad
"
( ie
, rebecca gayheart
) we also have another killer
- taunting
- his
- victim
- on
- the
- phone routine in urban legend anbd quick
, wqat movie is htis exchange ofthe dialogue fomr
: female protoganist
: why
? villain
: why
? why
?
!
? congratulations tothe those ofthe you who anwsered scream anbd
/ or urban legend
. like i said
, this movie could
' ve beeen great
. if only silvio hadnt worked or been allowed to owrk a little longer on the script
. still
, at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes
and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what yuo did last summer
.
