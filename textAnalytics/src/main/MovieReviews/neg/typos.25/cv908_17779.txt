teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood
. eveyr eyar countless films will be made targeting taht audience inaddition particular
,
and rely on the entire teenage populatio tothe turn out onthe friday
and saturday nights
, wallets in h
and
. the forumla is very simple
, ytou make a film with a big name young actor or actress whith sex appeal
. yuo add a high school environment that features everyone fomr prom queens tothe math club nerds
,
and
then a vrey simple relationship conflict that cxan be worked out inspite 90 minutes
, the typical teenage attention span
. the response is enormous as htis part of the population wiull waste it92s monye on almost any
= film set in an enviroment they can relate to
,
and
, most importantly
, they don92t care to judge films
= 92 quality
, so any piece of trash wiull
= due
. taht is just what never been kissed
, the latest film from director raja gosnell
, is
; trash
. josie geller
( drew barrymore
) is the youngest copy editor in tje history ofthe the chicago sun times
. she hasnt her own personal assistant
, unlimited supplies
,
and her own office
.
but she is very much dismayed with her postion in life
. there is nothing she wants more than tothe be a repertwar
and go out inot the field
, where she cant play a more active role inwhich the chicago media
. so when an assignment is qtuie literally thrown at her out of nowhere
, she jumps at it withthe eletion
. constanly smothering josie in the work place is her freind anita
( molly shannon
)
and her amicable superior
, gus
( john c
. reilly
)
. teh two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news ofthe her first assignment
, as htey both deem her to be an office worker
and not a reporter
.
however
, since thsi film isnt aimed at a teenage audiance with little paitience for character conflict
, thsi otherwise intresting senaireo is resolved withing two minutes
, annd josie is headed forthe tyhe field
. obviously
, the field assignment involves a high skool
. specifically
, she isnt to become an undercover repertwar at a high school
, by enrolling in tyhe senior class
and
" becoming one of them
.
" i don92t think that i
= need to even begin tothe explain all the impossibilities ofthe thsi situation ever occurring
, so i won92t
. tjhe movie develops into josie trying tothe find hte life that she never led infact high school
. interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truely was
,
and she appears to be heading down tath road again
. fortunately for this lame prodcution
, other characters do apear that mkea some of these high school scenes both humoorus
and remotely interesting
. they include the predictable love stories
, between both a student
( jeremy jordan
) anbd a teacher
( michael vartan
)
, to show thta josie is really two people in oen body
. also
, her younger brother
and opposite
, rob
( david arquette
) comes into her new foudn life
and even causes a rare scene thyat is mildly provocative
. the humor found in this film is actually qutie amusing
. typcial for teenage films
, it isnt chalk full of sexual innuendoes adn condom humer
. noe scene in particualr features a certain classroom activity involving bananas annd latex that isnt absolutely hysterical
. most ofthe tyhe other jokes are straight forward high school humor thast anyone who has ever been tothe high school can appreciate anbd will enjoy
.
but thsoe still don92t
= recover for the total lack of uality in thsi movie
. following thsi trend of high school movie rules
, comes the general acting
. it is even worse than teh trend of overplaying a scenerio ffrom film to film
. in this case
, drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch
. she is recquired tothe play her charcter on two levels
, hvaing soem vrey black
and white transitions
.
and altho smoe scenes are writen to be particular shades of gray
, she seems to hold that color throughout all ofthe her screen tiem
. at one point she isnt alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel
,
and is expected to him onthe an adult level
, since he is one
, her teacher
. bu she never seems to get outloud ofthe thte gray area
, adn in doing so she makes a mockery outloud ofthe his otherwise good performance
. following barrymore is yhe pitiful molly shannon
( saturday night live
)
. she seems tothe be limited tothe playing an ecstatic charachter that noone one can relate tothe
,
and draws thge attention of an audience as simply unrealistic
. it is these
" qualities
" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the faw decent
. luckly there is one great performance to emerge out of thsi otherwise bleak film
. david arquette
( scream
) takes home the prize for being able to st
and out in an ansamble performance thgat is absolutely pathetic
,
and not have his brilliant acting ruined
.
and as a central charactor he gets tothe take onthe his own mini
- plot
, which is one of the faw well done parts ofthe never beeen kissed
. inthe a dazzling cherry
- onthe
- the
- sundae tipe piece ofthe owrk
, he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression ffrom the 1983 hit
, risky business
. never beeen kissed is a mediocre film at best
. the predictable plot has become so overplayed iin hollywood
, that it is sickening to watch time
and again
,
and this film is noone exception
. teh acting is just as bad
,
but ther isnt tjhe oney positive presence of david arquette to add some light
. unforetunately
, hte bottom line is that tghe movei will be a success
, baceause teenagers iwll pay to see any trash
.
