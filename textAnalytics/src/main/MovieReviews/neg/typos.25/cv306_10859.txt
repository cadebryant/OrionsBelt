here
' s something to chew on
: what
' s the favorite food of big
, cheesy
- looking spacial effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising
? the obvious answer to this question is cardboard
, because that
' s tyhe depth of the most fully
- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature
. deepo rising demonstrates all tje originality
and vitality of something scripted by a computer
. in fact
, considering the rigid adherence tothe tjhe expeced formulas
, perhaps it was
. the most astonishing thign about deep rising is thge exceptionally high levle of gore
. not since starship troopers hve this many chunks of flesh
( both human adn non
- human
) beeen scattered iin all directions
. we leran some bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sae monster spraypaints in red
( it drinks a human being thn spits outloud tghe liquefied remains
)
and what it does wtih half
- digested leftovers
. i suppose deep rising
' s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for thsoe who love the macabre
,
but it doesn
' t dont much for me
. on the surface
, anbd that
' s about tyhe only levle at which this film can be analyzed
, deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone alse isnt citing tje equally valid aliens
/ titanic connection
, since james cameron directed both
)
. in going for the big disaster angle of titanic adn tghe tongue
- in
- cheek mayhem ofthe tremors
, deepo rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin
. teh film isnt not humorous
, tense
, or exciting
. in fact
, it
' s downright boring
, annd
, despite being half the length of cameron
' s currrent box
- office champ
, deep rising feels like the longer movie
. isnt it really neccessary to say anytying about teh plot
? probably not
, since it
' s easy to guess
,
but i
' ll go ahead
and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis
. the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship
. in addition tothe the usual cast ofthe psychopaths annd lunatics
, there
' s finnegan
( treat williams
)
, the boat
' s pilot
, who
' s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff
; joey
( kevin j
. o
' connor
)
, the inept sidekick who
' s supposed to be lovable annd funny
(
but is realy just irritating
)
;
and hanover
( wes studi
)
, the
" mastermind
"
(
and i use that term lightly
) of the operation
. thier goal
: attack a cruise ship
, clean out the safe
,
then sink it using some illegaly
- adquired torpedos
. the problem is
, by the timne they reach the argonautica
, the titanic
- like luxury liner has turned inot the marie celeste
. aside fomr a beautiful jewel theef
( famke janssen
)
and a couple of crew members
, htere
' s noone one on board
. the reason soon becomes obvious
-
- the ship hasnt been taken over by a bad spacial effect thyat isnt supposed tothe resemble an octopus iwth teeth
and more than eight tenacles
. tghe cast
, which is led by treat williams
, is primarily comprised of has
- beens adn probably
- never
- will
- bes
( two exceptions
: wes studi
, best known as the villain iin the last of tjhe mohicans
,
and djimon hounsou
, amistad
' s cinque
)
. williams
, once a
" cxan
' t miss
" prospect inspite hollywood
, has falled so far out of favor that the best he cxan do these days forthe a lead role is a film like deep rising
,
and his inability tothe create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career
. famke janssen
, who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye
, is the perfect bl
and match for williams
. given her limited acting abilities
, it
' s likely thyat she ws chosen for thsi part primarily on the basis ofthe her physical attri
butes
. unfortunately
, a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee
- shirt for half of the picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o
' connor
, who has entirely too much screen time
, exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard
. these dyas
, audiences are becomeing mroe difficult tothe impress whith cmoputer
- generated special effects
. this isnt a lesson tyhat writer
/ director stephen sommers
( who previously helmed the live
- action jungle book
) needs to leran
. the dyas ofthe jurassic park
, wehn viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big
and imposing on screen
, are past
. now
, movie
- goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic
-
- visuals that are so well
- incorportaed that it
' s impossible to tell where they end
and where
" reality
" beigns
. in deepo rising
, thte monster
, like everything
, isnt artificial
and unconvincing
. unfortunately
, the fundamental probelm audiences are faced with here isn
' t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture
,
but the poor quality of hte entire bankrupt genre
(
al
thought
, tothe be fair
, deep rising is a particlarly bad entry
)
. even once this film hasnt sunk out of sighth
, tghe knowledgeable viewer knows it won
' t be the last ofthe its kind
. like the slimy
, slithering things that inhabit the air vents
and pipes of theese movies
, more are waiting just arround the corner in ambush
.
and that consideration
, unlike anything on screen
, is truly horrifying
.
