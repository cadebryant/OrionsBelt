if i were to plot a graph ofthe eyar agains movie
- plot
- ridiculity for
= hollywood movies
, yuo ' ll probably see a line with constatn gradient
.
= now
, if i weere to plot thast smae graph for the movies tht the michael
= bay
/ jerry bruckheimer has made over the last 4 eyasr
, that line would be
= exponential in growth
. the team started out with the will smith vehicle
= bad boys which was no more than a 2hr long action
- music
- video
,
= nevertheless entertaining
.
then came the rock
, where audiences flocked
= tothe see nicholas cage team up with sean connery aginst some terrorizing
= general fighting over soem stupid cause
. con
- air wass ridiculousy dumb infront
= its premise
but it doed have fun moments
,
and who can forget the nursery
= rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi
. while these
= movies worked because there wass something better to cover
- up tjhe dirt
,
= rmageddon does not
. vyre much like deep impact
, a meteor is heading towards earth
adn they
= didn ' t relize it nutil 18 days from inpact
. deep impact settled with
= thge modest meteor size as large as the city of new york
but armageddon
= jstu hadnt to be bigger
.
.
.
. well about the size of texas
( tath kinda meteor
= whould propably knock earth out ofthe its orbit
!
)
. the panic of thsi
= sighting spurs thte idea of landing peopel on the meteor
, drill it
then
= nuke it
( sounds familiar
)
and who better tothe dont such a job than harry
= stamper
( bruce willis
)
, your very own oil
- driller extraordinaire
and
= his team of macho
- misfits
, nursing the tagline
` there ain ' t nothin ' onthe
= this planet that harry cant ' t drill
! '
. in that 18 dyas
, harry ' s group ws
= split into 2 teams
, trained for deep
- spoace flight
and finaly blasted
= into space in with special drilling vehicles onthe 2 new space shuttles
. the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the
= relatiopnship of harry
, a
. j
.
and grace
. to give you an idea
, a
. j
. works
= for harry
,
and loves grace
, harry ' s daugter
. the problem is
, harry
= hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt liuke himselv
= for the rest ofthe her life
. so while a
. j
.
and harry struts it out
, grace
= is place in a position where she is unable to take sides
, so she remeniss
= seated in the nasa control tower
, crying over both of them in about 80
%
= of thge movei
. the human elements this movie tries tothe inject proves to be nothing more
= tahn just an excuse for more slow
- mo ' s
and gold
- tinted photography
. thge
= anguish of the world isnt potrayed with scenes ofthe people praying
, runing
= for theri lives or just sitting still staring at the sky
, soudns fine
= right
? i know
,
but it looks too outloud of place on screen
, too staged
. if
= ytou were tothe ask yourself
,
` waht ' s thte difference between armageddon
and
= a r
& b music video
?
" ytou ' d probably jstu said
` the music
.
"
. not
= surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry
and has
= actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully
. his
= foray into arageddon just proves that he doesn ' t when to stpo
. well htere ' s really nothing much to sum up here
. the
= stock
- aitken
- waterman of hollywood movies have projected their art
- form
= into ridiculity
, beyond the plane believability
, where people still
= accept even if htey didn ' t belivee
. deep impact was ridiculous in most
= aspects
and i belive the makers know this
. tjhe thing is
, they decided
= tothe shroud myth
and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of
= suffering
and comming in terms witht ones problems
, which ultimately
= brought it above the ashes which it hadnt initially put itself in
.
= armgaeddon
, is an overcrowded
, loud
, messy
, preposterously manipulative
= waste ofthe money
and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash
.
.
= 20 if you haev planned tothe watched this over deepo impact becouse of liv
= tyler
, bruce willis or tyhe tagline
" from the makers of
` the rock '
!
!
"
.
= please catch deep impact before it finishes its run
, it may be the onyl
= meteor worth watching in long
- long time
. if ytou have to see it
, please
= bring ear
- plugs
and some aspirins
( for the vertigo
)
. expect armageddon
= ld ' s to retail at s
$ 19
. 90 at carrefour cmo release time
. gee
.
.
.
.
