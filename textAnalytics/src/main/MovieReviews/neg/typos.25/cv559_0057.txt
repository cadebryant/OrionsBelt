htis isnt a film that i ws inclined to like at tje outset
: the two main cahracters had been involved with the fine television drama st
. elsewhere for several years
,
and i had understood that thte director
/ screenwriter had written for thte show on occasion alsot
. i am sorry to report that teh results were not up to my expectations
, nor were tehy satisfactory
. if i hadnt to list a reason why
.
.
.
. bu that would be getting ahead of mysef
; besides
, it
' s not emmediately clear
, as there are so many problems with the film
. adam arkin plays a grade
- skool teacher who is sardonic
, cynical
,
and somewhat abrasive
,
but a good teacher
. he spends his lunches palying basketball by himself on a nearby court
. one day
, he meets a drifter
( david morse
, who plays jack morrison on st
. elsewhere
) in the park
, anbd inveigles him in a game ofthe one
- on
- one basketball
. morse turns outloud tothe be good
,
and a friendship slowy develops between tje twpo
, as their respective professions progress on the screen
-
- arkin
' s teaching
, adn morse
' s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists
. so far
, my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue
,
and the constatn intrusion of the muscial soundtrack
. good music tothe be sure
,
but it doesn
' t replace the dialogue fo setting the mood or telling tje story
-
- it makes the film somewhat minimalistic
, a technique i rarely admire
. suddenly their friendship is interupted by morse
' s introduction tothe a fellow teacher ofthe arkin
' s
, a woman arkin has long admired from adar
,
but it too reticent to aproach
. it appears that she begins to admire morse
( who enjoys here attentions
,
but isn
' t sure what to dont baout it
-
- she doesn
' t realize thta he isnt a drifter
,
and knwos nothing about his past
)
,
and this causes friction bewteen arkin
and allmost everyone eles
. until thn
, i hadnt onyl a vague disatisfaction with hte film
. thge conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full
- fledged failure
. tje woman
, at least tothe me
, appeared to be fairly shallow
; i didn
' t relize how shallow nutil her final scene with arkin
, where she reveals that she has been trying tothe make arkin jealous by her attentions tothe morse
. somehow
, this is made to appear as if it is arkin
' s fault
, adn it isnt left with him feeling somehow victorious that he
' s gotten such a find ofthe girlfriend
. frankly
, dropping her onthe the spot would hvae seemed the most civilized action arkin could make
; punching her in tjhe mouth not the least
. after this
, tjhe childish confrontation between morse
and arkin at the end seems almost natural
. if i had to summarize a major gripe
, it
' s thyat thsi isnt a story spread too thin
, that creates semi
- likable characters at the outset
, anbd
then suddenly jerks them into bieng 16
- year
- olds at the last moment
. it might be true
- to
- life with some people
;
but that doesn
' t mean
* i
* have to like it
. i don
' t
.
. avoid
.
