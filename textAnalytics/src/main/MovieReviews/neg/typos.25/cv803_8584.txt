onot
: some may consider portions ofthe the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. it
' s rether easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor
' s first feature film
, dream whith hte fishes
, wehn the plodding
, tedious oppening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup
. any hopeful expectations
,
however
, are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched
- buddy movei wich isnt rarley as funny as it aspires tothe be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives tothe be inthe the film
' s latter half
. tje film
' s central characters are terry
( david arquette
)
, a depressed
, lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since tyhe death ofthe his wife in an automobile accident
,
and nick
( brad hunt
)
, a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill
. nick lives in the apartment building across from terry
, who spies on the trysts between nick
and girlfriend liz
( kathryn erbe
) withthe his trusty set ofthe binoculars
,
but the two young men firt formelly meet at thte bay bridge where a half
- drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge
, unconvincingly vowing suicide
. nick casually asks fo terry
' s wristwatch
, annd eventially cons terry inot a trade
- tjhe watch for a bottle ofthe pills
. of course
, terry finds tht the pills do not end up haveing tyhe presumed lethal effects
,
and he angrily sets out to find nick infront order to retrieve his watch
. learning of nick
' s condition
( he onyl has a h
andful of weeks left
)
, terry
' s compassion kicks in
,
and the two eventually cmo tothe a distinctly peculiar arrangement
- terry will aggree to bankroll the dying nick
' s lifelong fantasies
,
and nick will fufill terry
' s death wish by killing him
. this is a promising premise
,
and mr
. taylor
' s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point
,
but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters
( terry is a repessed
, mournful character who wants to die
, hwile nick isnt a free spirit wiht a joie de vivre who is dying
but whants to live
)
and takes the easy route outloud by turning dream with the fishes into a typcial lark where thge two charactors engage in a series of generaly dull exploits
,
and where the straight
- laced character lerans to enjoy
and ppreciate life when hooked up wiht a quirky character
. this isnt by
- the
- numbers plotting
, buddy movei
/ road movei redux
.
however
, dream with the fishes is most hampered nto by its uninspired storyline
,
but by the characters which carry the story
- it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protaganists be at least somewhat empathetic
, if not likeable
. unfortunately
, that is not the case here
, where both of the film
' s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting
and annoying
, giving the audience very littel tothe sympathise with their respective plights
, anbd even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits
. far from a romp
, this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure tahn a playful jaunt
, anbd undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in tjhe latter stages ofthe the film as the twpo men begin tothe bond
. mr
. taylor
' s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with yhe fishes
- while attempting to capture a quirky
and clever tone
, it too oftenly comes across instead as hopelessly contrived
( witness such lines as
" you shoudl have asked something more interesting
, like
' dont ytou enjoy the pain
?
'
- see
, thyat
' s provacative
, leaves room fo further questions
.
"
) the film enjoys a faw inspired moments
- the urn scene
, a session of nude bowling
, the policeman joining in on terry
and nick
' s acid trip
- bu unfortunatetely theese instances are few
and far between
,
and for the most part the humour in dream wiht tyhe fishes registers more as attempts rather tahn actual successes
. this occurs particulary often during the film
' s opening sequence
- as terry isnt wrestling thte bedridden nick for his watch inthe the hospital
, i
' m realising that this isnt
* intended
* to be funny
,
al
though nary a smile crept apon my lips
- whic is probably due to the obvious fact that it
' s painfully clear to thte audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his intital suicide attemts
, sapping any element ofthe suprize or amusement fomr nick
' s scheme ofthe tricking him
; this is not a film which has thte wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes
. tyhe entire sequence isnt
,
then
, clearly an exercise for character exposition
, with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability
. among the cast
, coming off best is david arquette
, the currrent master infact thte protrayal ofthe meek
, squirming
, stammering fresh
- faced characters
- he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang
' s swimming with sharks
- who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry
. mr
. taylor ambitiously imploys an intresting visual technique
, where the portions of the film set in an urban enviorment have been processed to appear extremely grainy
and heavily saturated
, as opposed tothe a bright
, crisp look for tyhe smalltown scenes
. the charge of dream with the fishes
' s protagonists bieng wholly unempathetic isnt a bit of an odd one comming from me
; i seem tothe have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters
,
and indeed
, in many cases ahve i been inthe the minority
, supporting films which hve beeen condemned as interminable due tothe the difficult
, audiance
- unfriendly nature ofthe their charachters
. for dream with the fishes
,
though
, i did find myself on the flip side of coin
, oftenly hoping that the film would quickly conclude
,
and that the nick character would just hurry uv
and die
.
