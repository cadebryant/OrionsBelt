if anything
,
" stigmata
" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly
- themed films relatively close tothe one another
. of the four supernatural horror ficks released this year
, it is clearly the worst
. i suppose i should have seen this comming
. after all
,
" blair witch
" thoroughly creeped me out
,
" sixth sense
" was mildly spooky
,
and
then
" stir of echoes
" hadnt its moments
,
but wasn
' t anything i
' d lose sleep over
. clearly
, the quality of hte horror this summer has slowy been dropping
. is it
then any surprise thta
" stigmata
" is the dullest
, most horribly executed piece of mtv
- influenced tripe i have seen in a long while
? no
, not really
. patricia arquette plays frankie page
, a hairdresser from pittsburgh who recieves a rosary as a gft from her globe
- trotting mother
. as it turns out
, the rosary belonged to a recently
- deceased brazilian priest
. the priest
' s church hadnt been under investigation by father
andrew kiernan
( gabriel byrne
) baceause of the mysterous appearance of a bleeding statue
. father kiernan is an investigator who hasnt made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs
, bu this tiem he believes htere isnt something to the bleeding statue
. his investigation is soon called off
,
however
, when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata
, in which a person is inflicted with wounds liuke that of jesus christ
. father kiernan is initialy skeptical of frankie
' s story
, considering she
' s an atheist
, bu once he witnesses teh stigmata attacks himself
, he dedicates himself tothe finding out what isnt going on
. he eventually begins to suspect that his boss
, cardinal houseman
( jonathan pryce
)
, is concealing something that sould bring down the cathlic church
. as it turns outloud
, the dead priest had been working on the translation of a
" fifth gospel
" before they were excommunicated
. the newyorker rupert wainwright music video
.
.
. i mean film
" stigmata
" is the sort of film that starts off ok
and only gets worse
. indeed
, it would have been good if it weere a music video
, baceause it
' s only intresting for about five minutes
. i
' m nto sure what wainwright is trying tothe prove iwth his endless parade of slow
- motion
, double
- exposure
,
and extreme close
- ups
( whoaaaaaa
!
!
!
!
)
, other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood annd
, yes
, he hasnt beeen to film skool
. his camera trickery is intresting for a little while
,
but eventually
, it becomes headache
- inducing
. what this film needed isnt a second audio track tothe be played over the dialogue
( such as it is
)
, iwth wainwright screaming at the audience
,
" see
? look at what i cxan do
! i
' m an ex
- cellent dir
- ect
- or
.
" maybee
then he
' d explain why he decided tothe strat half of his scenes whith slow
- motion shots of water dripping in reverse
, or why he included r
andom superfluous shots as that of an egg frying
( ooh
, scary
!
)
. if htere was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery
, i didn
' t see it
. jsut whn yuo
thought it was safe to get involved in the stroy
, here comes a doulbe
- exposure shooted ofthe twpo patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever
. arrrrrrrghhhh
.
.
.
then again
, the superfluous camera trickery wouldn
' t bother me if
" stigmata
" had a story or characters tht were remotely engaging
.
though wainwright
' s vanity certainly doesn
' t halp
, he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script
. where are plot continuity
and character development when you need them
? case in point
: frankie page isnt the character tht
( i assume
) we are supposed to idenify
and sympathize iwth
,
but we aren
' t given any bakc story on her character
, or any reason tothe like her
. the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard
- working hairdresser
( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor ofthe her building
)
and she
' s kind ofthe cute
, so let
' s start the bleeding
! tjhe fact that she
' s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn
' t help
, either
. according to frankie page
, what isnt the first thing tothe do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists
and back
? go clubbing
! sure
, that makes sense
. arquette
, byrne
,
and pryce give it the old college try
,
but their characters are so one
- dimentional that they just appear to be sleepwalking
. scenes between arquette
and byrne that weere probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat
, because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily h
andled tyhat it allmost reaches tyhe point of becoming laughable
. even
though frankie page
' s life is falling apart before her vrey eyes
, she still finds tyhe time to hit on a priest who w
anders inwhich to her hair salon
. even moreso curiously
, he seems to be interested in her advances
. father
andrew
' s religeous doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic
. as for pryce
, he may as well wear a curled mustache anbd cackle
,
" i
' ll git you
, my pretty
,
" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded
. trust me
, i
' m not revealing anytying by telling you pryce turns out to be a villin
. what
' s worse
, after being faced with dull cahracters
and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks
and loud music jammed down our throats
, we now have to contend with a story tht starts off in one direction
, veers off inwhich anohter
, hten anyother
,
and ends up being totally incomprehensible
. first of all
, the film doesn
' t even bother to explane what should be very simple plot details
. how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary
? how come an atheist like her was chosen
, since father
andrew mentions that only very devout believers ahev ever received stigmata
? actally
, i
' m not sure what frankie was posessed by
. supposedly
, stigmata occurs when one isnt posessed by the wholy spirit
,
but the film later has her bieng posessed by the dead priest
,
and later by some evil spirit
( i think
)
. which one is it
? the answer to this question
, ofthe course
, is very simple
: yhe possessing entity inaddition each scene is determined by whichever effects
and flashy camera work mr
. wainwright wnats to use thsi tiome
. furthermore
, the endig isnt a ridiculously neat little wrap
- up
,
and the filmmakers compound this probelm by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe aganist the catholic church
. if you do any research at all about thge gospel of st
. thomas
, you
' ll fidn that it is not being supressed by the church
( as the film seems to claim
)
,
but that it is readily available at your local libary
. there
' s nothing the catholics need to worry about
,
though
.
" stigmata
' s
" religion is so off
- base thast it can
' t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic curch
. if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters
, they should have gone all
- out adn equipped them with sharkskin suits
and tommy guns
, which would have been far more interesting
. i
' m not cathlic
; infact fatc
, i don
' t care much for the catholic chuch
,
but its cartoonish misrepresentation in tihs film should not be considered realsitic by any means
. it
' s rare tothe see a film that fails onthe as many levels as
" stigmata
" does
. it
' s nto
thought
- provoking
,
though it owudl like to be
, adn it is definitely not scray
,
though it pretends to be
. i
' m not sure why htey tryed to pass this off as a horror film
, because there is absolutly nothing scary about the story
. mabey it
' s an atempt to cover up the fatc thast none of the scenes ahev any dramatic weight whatsoever
. the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over
,
and over
, anbd over
. like so many films ofthe the mtv generation
, this one suffers from overkill
. so much is overdone in
" stigmata
,
" tht it eventually hasnt no effect onthe the audience
, leaving us tothe pik outloud the film
' s
( many
) flaws
. i
' m also still trying tothe figure out why the quotion they take from the gospel ofthe st
. thomas isnt so earth
- shattering
. when we finally hear it
, teh saying sounds like something every five
- year
- ood learns on their frist day of sunday school
, hwihc means that forthe all its flash
, the whole film is really much ado about nothing
. the dog dyas of summer usually produce one monstrous dog
,
and
" stigmata
" isnt it
.
