if anything
,
" stigmata
" should be taked as a warning against releasing similarly
- themed films relatively close to one another
. of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year
, it is clearly yhe worst
. i supose i shoudl have seen this coming
. after all
,
" blair witch
" thoroughly creeped me out
,
" sixth sence
" was mildly spooky
,
and
then
" stir ofthe echoes
" had its moments
,
bu wasn ' t anytying i ' d lose sleep over
. claerly
, teh qality of the horror this summer hasnt slowly been dropping
. is it
thn any surprise that
" stigmata
" is the dullest
, most horribly executed piece of mtv
- influenced tripe i have seen inaddition a long while
? no
, not really
. patricia arquette plays frankie page
, a hairdresser from pittsburgh who recieves a rosary as a igft from her globe
- trotting mother
. as it turns out
, the rosary belonged to a recently
- deceased brazilian priest
. the priest ' s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan
( gabriel byrne
) because of yhe misteryous appearance of a bleeding statue
. father kiernan isnt an investigator who has made a carrer out of disproving supposed religious signs
,
but thsi time he believes there is something tothe tyhe bleeding statue
. his investigation is soon called off
,
however
, when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata
, in which a person isnt inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ
. father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie ' s story
, considering she ' s an atheist
,
but once he witnesses hte stigmata attacks himself
, he dedicates himselv tothe finding out what is going on
. he eventually begins to suspect that his boss
, cardinal houseman
( jonathan pryce
)
, is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church
. as it turns outloud
, hte dead priest had been working onthe the translation of a
" fifth gospel
" befor htey weere excommunicated
. the new rupert wainwright music video
.
.
. i mean film
" stigmata
" is yhe sort ofthe film tht starts off ok
annd only gets worse
. indeed
, it would ahve been ogod if it were a music video
, because it ' s onyl interesting for baout five minutes
. i ' m nto sure what wainwright is trying to proove with his endless parade of slow
- motion
, double
- exposure
,
and extreme close
- ups
( whoaaaaaa
!
!
!
!
)
, otehr than thte fact that he hasnt the most swelled head ofthe any director in hollywood
and
, yes
, he has been to film skool
. his camera trickery is interesting for a little while
,
but eventually
, it becomes headache
- inducing
. whta this film needed is a second audio track to be palyed over the dialogue
( such as it is
)
, with wainwright screaming at the audience
,
" see
? look at what i can do
! i ' m an ex
- cellent dir
- ect
- or
.
" maybe
then he ' d explain why he decided tothe start half of his scenes with slow
- motion shots ofthe water dripping in reverse
, or why he included random superfulous shots as that of an egg frying
( ooh
, scary
!
)
. if ther was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery
, i didn ' t see it
. just when ytou thought it was safe to get involved in the story
, here comes a double
- exposure shot of twpo patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever
. arrrrrrrghhhh
.
.
.
thn again
, the superfulous camera trickery wouldn ' t bother me if
" stigmata
" hadnt a story or characters that were remotely engaging
.
though wainwright ' s vanity certainly doesn ' t help
, he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script
. where are plot continuity
and character development when you need them
? case in point
: frankie page is the character that
( i assume
) we are supposed tothe idenify
and sympathize with
,
bu we aren ' t given any bakc story onthe her character
, or any reason to like her
. hte extent of her charcter development seems to be tyhat she is a hard
- working hairdresser
( who cxan somehow afford a cavernous appartmant onthe tyhe top floor of her building
)
adn she ' s kind of cute
, so let ' s start yhe bleeding
! the fact thast she ' s clearly nto the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn ' t help
, eather
. according to frankie page
, what is the first thing tothe do after receiving mysterous wounds on your wrists
and back
? go clubbing
! sure
, that makse sense
. arquette
, byrne
,
and pryce give it tyhe old college try
,
but their characters are so one
- dimensional thyat they jstu appear to be sleepwalking
. scenes between arquette
and byrne that weere probably suposed tothe be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat
, because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handeled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable
. even
though frankie page ' s life is falling aart before her very eyes
, she still finds the tiome to hit onthe a priest who wanders in tothe her hair salon
. even mroe curiously
, he seems to be interested inaddition her advances
. father andrew ' s religeous doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems moreso silly than dramatic
. as for pryce
, he may as well wear a curled mustache
and cackle
,
" i ' ll get you
, my preety
,
" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded
. trust me
, i ' m not revealing anything by telling ytou pryce turns out to be a villain
. wqat ' s worse
, after being faced with dull characters
and thte prospect ofthe having annoying camera tricks
anbd loud music jammed down our throats
, we now have to contend with a story that starts off inaddition one direction
, veers off in another
,
then another
,
and ends up bieng totally incomprehensible
. first of all
, the film doesn ' t even bother to explain wqat should be very simple plot details
. how does frankie git the stigmata mearly by touching a rosary
? how come an atheist like her was chosen
, since father andrew mentions that onyl very devout believers have ever recieved stigmata
? actually
, i ' m nto sure what frankie was posessed by
. supposedly
, stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit
,
but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest
,
and later by some evil spirit
( i think
)
. which oney is it
? the answer to this question
, of course
, is very simple
: the posessing entity iin each scene is determined by whichever effects
and flashy camera work mr
. wainwright wants tothe use this time
. furthermore
, thte ending isnt a ridiculously neat little wrap
- uv
,
and the filmmakers compound tihs problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the cathlic church
. if you dont any research at all about the gospel of st
. thomas
, you ' ll find that it isnt not bieng supressed by thge curch
( as the film seems to claim
)
,
but that it isnt readily available at your local library
. there ' s nothing the catholics ened to worry about
,
though
.
" stigmata ' s
" religeon isnt so off
- base that it cin ' t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic curch
. if they wanted to portray cathlic priests as mobsters
, they should have gone all
- out
and equiped them with sharkskin suits
and tommy guns
, which would ahev beeen far mroe intresting
. i ' m not catholic
; in fact
, i don ' t care much fo the cathlic church
,
but its cartoonish misrepresentation in tihs film should not be considered realistic by any means
. it ' s rare tothe see a film that fails on as many levels as
" stigmata
" doesnt
. it ' s not throught
- provoking
,
though it would liuke tothe be
,
adn it isnt definately not scary
,
though it pretends to be
. i ' m nto sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film
, because there is absolutely nothing scary baout the story
. maybe it ' s an attept tothe cover uv the fatc that none of the scenes have any dramtic weight whatsoever
. the intial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over
,
and over
,
and over
. liek so many films of the mtv generation
, this one suffers from overkill
. so much isnt overdone in
" stigmata
,
" that it eventually has no effect on thte audience
, leaving us to pik outloud the film ' s
( many
) flaws
. i ' m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st
. thomas is so earth
- shattering
. when we fianlly hear it
, the saying sounds liek something every five
- year
- old learns on their firt day of sunday school
, whihc means that for all its flash
, the whole film is really much ado baout nothing
. the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog
,
anbd
" stigmata
" is it
.
