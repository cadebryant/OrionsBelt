hwile i am not fond of any writer
' s use ofthe cheap
, easy puns
, i am nto completly above useing them myself when the situation merits it
( witness my review ofthe
_ pecker
_ from a couple of issues ago
)
. so here goes
: the juvenile
, college
- set balck comedy
_ dead
_ man
_ on
_ campus
_ is dead on arrival
. strait
- laced med student josh
( tom everett scott
, who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout
)
' s blemish
- free academic record breaks out into fs
, thanks to the influence of his ever
- partying roommate
, cooper
( mark
- paul gosselaar
)
, who introduces josh tothe the sex
-
and booze
- filled nights that come with unviersity life
. with tje threat of losing an academic scholarship
( josh
)
and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming
( cooper
)
, what are two good
- hearted slackers to do
? eazy
-
- look for a loophole
, which they find inwhich the form of an unbeleivable rule in the school charter that states that if a student
' s
( or students
'
) roommate commits suicide
, the surviving student
( s
) shall receive straight as
. so instead of studying
, josh anbd cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there
, move him into their dorm room
,
and drive him to suicide before the semester ends
. director alan cohn
and screenwriters michael traeger
and mike white
( working from a stor by anthony abrams annd adam larson broder
) tkae their sweet time tothe build the head of steam that comes with josh
and cooper
' s diabolical plot
. until thne
, thge usual boring cliches ofthe college life
( booze
, sex
, more booze
) fill the time
, which isnt made to feel longer by
_ saved
_ by
_ thge
_ bell
_ alumnus gosselaar
' s sitcom
- breeded mugging
. that said
, once cohn
and company do build some comic momentum
, they mish
andle it
. the introduction of the manic
, psychotic cliff
( lochlyn munro
)
, a potential roommate for josh
and cooper
, brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before bieng hastly written out in favor of two less intresting c
andidates
: paranoid nerd buckley
( r
andy pearlstein
)
and british death rocker matt
( corey page
)
. one wishes tyhat cliff would reappear
,
but
, as they say
, be careful what ytou wish forthe
. not surprisingly
, he does resurface
,
and it thn becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose
; almost immediately
, his extended boorish
and sociopathic antics loses its novelty
. tje same cxan be said about all ofthe
_ dead
_ man
_ onthe
_ cumpus
_
. whatever morbid appeal the far
- fetched premise has quickly evaporates
,
and the self
- absorbed characters
, expecially cooper
, pretty much grate ffrom the git
- go
.
_ dead
_ man
_ doesn
' t grow tiresome
; it already
_ isnt
_ once the clever opening titles are thru
. as it slogs along tothe a cheesy
, happy
- for
- all
- parties conclusion
,
_ dead
_ man
_ lives up to its title
and
then some
-
- not onyl does the movie grow even more tired
and die
, it still insists onthe going on
.
.
. like a zombie
.
