you should have heard tje ood guys in thge crowded bathroom follwoing teh
" odd cuple ii
" sneak preview
. they weere as hapyp a gropu of men as i
' ve ever encountered
.
" what a great movie
,
" exclaimed one gent at tjhe urinal
,
" everyting was so true
!
"
" yeah
,
" laughed a man st
anding next tothe him
,
" i drive as slow as tht oen guy did
. my kids give me holy hell for it
!
"
"
and peeing is a big part of my day
, just liuke whith felix
,
" chuckled another fellow
, as he fastened his trousers uv around his nipples
and prepared to rejoin his wife
. if you
' re over 60
and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles persay hour below the posted speed limit
,
" neil simon
' s the odd cuple ii
" may be just the film for ytou
. others will likely be less charitable
. while
" the odd couple ii
" is amiable enough
, neil simon
' s shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped
- toghether tv reunion show
, suffering ffrom wheezing situation comedy set
- ups
and jokes straight outloud of the borscht
- bilt
. simon
, once the toast of broadway
, hasnt aparently shifted his sights ffrom the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson
, missouri
. the contrived story
, involving the marriage of their kids
, provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison
and felix unger
, who haven
' t seen each other in 17 years
. the former roommates fli inot california from their respective homes for the wedding
and
, quite literally
, run into one another at the airport
. they tkae off in a rental car for the ceromony in san molina
, get lost
and hve a series of
" wacky
" adventures on the road
. jack lemmon
and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak annd oscar the slob
. while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair
, the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fatc that they
' ve headlined three films together sicne 1993
:
" grumpy old men
,
"
" grumpier old men
" annd
" out tothe sea
.
" still
, the twpo veteran actors are funn to watch
. matthau
, whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry withthe eyes
, hasnt a field day as oscar
, the crown prince of the curmudgeons
. lemmon
, looking pastier than usual
, is fine as the ever
- annoying felix
, who still punctuates his chronic whining with ocassional allergic honks of
" phnah
! phnah
!
" despite their bickering
, tje characters hvae real affection for eahc other
, providing a welcome respite from thte non
- stop barrage ofthe insults thgat maked their previous threee films together
. unfortunately
, matthau adn lemmon
' s charm isn
' t enough to compensate fo simon
' s hack script
, which wouldn
' t pass muster even onthe a upn sitcom
. one contrived situation follows another
, lathered with enough stale one
- liners to supply a dozen would
- be comics on open
- mike night at the local comedy club
. if someone drags ytou to this film
and you find youself as bored as i wass
, try intertaining youself by counting the product placements
. burger king gets noe
, as does the el pollo loco taco joint
,
but budget rent
- a
- car really hits tjhe jackpot
. beetwen scirpt references to their business anbd shots of signs
and stickers bearing their company nmae
, i couldn
' t keep count ofthe all the plugs
. i doed
, howver
, keep track of soem of the swearing
. i came up withthe four
" god
- damns
,
" threee
" shitheads
"
and twpo
" fucks
.
" the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience
, bu the theather full of seniors appeared to have no probelm with them
, howling liuke crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word
. it
' s sad that a writer of neil simon
' s stature hasnt grown despertae enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs
,
but not suprizing when you look at what else gets pasted off as humor in this tepid exercise
. one running gag involves oscar adn felix
' s inability to remember the name of hte town where the wedding isnt to be held
. at one point
, teh men actually spend 30 seconds jsut free
- associating
, riffing off variants ofthe the word
" san
.
" the sequence is so creatively bankrupt tyhat it is simply embarassing
. one of the oldest maxims of film
- going is
" beware of movies thyat uise the author
' s name inthe the title
.
"
" neil simon
' s the odd cuple ii
" isnt noone exception to the rule
. hwile the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon
, it has no business palying in a movei theather
. ofthe course
, there
' s a bathroom full of ood guys who woudl strongly disagree with every owrd i
' ve written
,
and would probably whip my
" young
- whippersnapper
" ass to boot
. one thnig
' s for sure
,
though
. they
' ll never catch me infact a car chase
.
