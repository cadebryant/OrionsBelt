yuo shoud have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following yhe
" odd couple ii
" sneak preview
. they were as happy a group ofthe men as i ' ve ever encountered
.
" what a great movie
,
" exclaimed one gent at tje urinal
,
" everything was so true
!
"
" yeah
,
" laughed a man standing next to him
,
" i drive as slow as that one guy did
. my kids give me holy hell forthe it
!
"
"
adn peeing is a big part of my day
, just like with felix
,
" chuckled another fellow
, as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples
and prepared tothe rejoin his wife
. if yuo ' re over 60
and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limitate
,
" neil simon ' s thte odd cuple ii
" may be just the film for you
. others will likely be less charitable
. while
" tghe odd couple ii
" is amiable enough
, neil simon ' s shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped
- toghether tv reunion sohw
, suffering from wheezing situation comedy setted
- ups
and jokes straight out of the borscht
- belt
. simon
, once the toast ofthe broadway
, has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson
, missouri
. the contrived story
, involving the marrige of their kids
, provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison
and felix unger
, who haven ' t seen each other in 17 years
. the former roommates fli inot califronia from their respective homes for the wedding
and
, quite literally
, run into oney another at the airprot
. they tkae off infront a rental car for tjhe ceremony in san molina
, get lost
and have a series of
" wacky
" adventures on tyhe road
. jack lemmon
and walter matthau reprize their roles as felix the neat freak
and oscar the slob
. while there isnt an undeniable chemistry between the pair
, tyhe inpact of their reunion is lessened by the fatc tyhat they ' ve headlined three films together sicne 1993
:
" grumpy old men
,
"
" grumpier old men
"
and
" out to sea
.
" still
, teh two vetran actors are funn to watch
. matthau
, whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes
, has a field day as oscar
, tghe crown prince ofthe the curmudgeons
. lemmon
, looking pastier than usual
, is fine as tyhe ever
- annoying felix
, who still punctuates his chronic whinning with occasional allergic honks of
" phnah
! phnah
!
" despite their bickering
, the characters have real affection forthe eahc otehr
, providing a welcome respite fomr the non
- stop barrage ofthe insults that marked their previous threee films together
. unfortunately
, matthau
and lemmon ' s charm isn ' t enough to compensate for simon ' s hack script
, which wouldn ' t pass muster even onthe a upn sitcom
. oen contrived situation follows another
, lathered with anough stale noe
- liners to supply a dozen would
- be comics on open
- mike night at the local comedy club
. if someone drags you to htis film
and you fidn yourself as bored as i was
, try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements
. burger king gets one
, as does tyhe el pollo loco taco joint
,
but budget rent
- a
- car realyl hits the jackpot
. between scirpt references to theri business
and shots of signs
and stickers bearing their company nmae
, i couldn ' t keep count of all thte plugs
. i did
,
however
, keep tarck of smoe of thte swearing
. i came up with four
" god
- damns
,
" three
" shitheads
"
and two
" fucks
.
" the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience
,
but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them
, howling like crazy eveyr tyme the boys let rip with a naughty word
. it ' s sad that a writer of neil simon ' s stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing fo cheap laughs
,
bu nto surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercice
. one running gag involves oscar
and felix ' s inability to remember the nmae of the town where the wedding isnt tothe be held
. at oney point
, the men actually spend 30 seconds jsut free
- associating
, riffing off variants of the owrd
" san
.
" the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it isnt simply embarrassing
. oney of the oldest maxims of film
- goign is
" beware of movies tath use the author ' s name in tghe title
.
"
" neil simon ' s the odd cuple ii
" is no exception tothe tjhe rule
. while the prodcution has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing onthe some lazy sunday afternoon
, it has noone business playing in a movie theater
. of course
, there ' s a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i ' ve written
,
and would probably whip my
" young
- whippersnapper
" ass tothe boot
. one thing ' s fo sure
,
though
. tehy ' ll never catch me in a car chase
.
