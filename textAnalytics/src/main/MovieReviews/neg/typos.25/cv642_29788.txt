the one question that eats at me aftter seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much moeny marketing this throwaway film
. since june
, i haven
' t beeen able tothe turn on the tv or go to yhe movies without getting hitted by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky
, shrieking outloud a
- ha
' s
" tkae on me
" in his yelow miata
. why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine
? honestly
, i was hoping tath all tje goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie
. man
, was i wrong
. corky romano is oney of those throwaway
, clich
?
- ridden tv
- star
- tothe
- film vehicles builded upon the most rickety of plots
. fortunately for chris kattan
' s precariously positioned career
, corky does have some good laughs
, even if most of them are of teh lowest
- brow variaty
. kattan plays thte title charcter
, the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who hasnt a penchant for sunshiny
' 80s tunes
, bright ties
,
and banal coffee mug slogans
(
" ytou don
' t have to be crazy to work here
, bu it sure helps
.
"
)
. when his mob boss dad
( peter falk
) is about tothe be put away on murder charges
, his bungling
, lughead brothers
( peter berg
and chris penn
) rope inspite innocent
, black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent anbd steal tyhe evidence
. predictably
, hijinks insue
. if the basic plot sounds bad
, wait until you get into teh inner
- workings ofthe this clunker
. yhe writers will amaze you with the depth ofthe their inanity
. corky
' s fbi agent idenity is named corky pissant
(
" thyat
' s pronounced pees
- ahn
. it
' s french
.
"
)
. he becomes a frist
- rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr
. magoo
- style onto the proper clues
and tlaking his way iin
and outloud of situations
, which plays like something out of a sitcom
.
and not a good sitcom
, i mean
. teh romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in earch other
' s face
. anbd in a scene taken straight fomr there
' s something about mary
, corky gives a dachshund mouth
- to
- mouth resuscitation
. bu it
' s not a complete diaster
. the manic kattan does occasionally rescure some comic moments
, includng a bit featuring a cat inwhich a fat suit named jesus
and another involving schoolchildren
, a german shephard
,
and a kilo of cocaine
. plus
, berg
-
- whose carrer has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction
and chicago hope
-
- gives a gerat turn as the illiterate brother paulie
.
and
, it
' s nice to see that richard roundtree ofthe shaft fame isnt getting work
. unfortunately fo those out there who can
' t truly appreciate animal or fart jokes
, corky won
' t haev much to offer you
. so the enxt time oney of those pesky ads appears on your tv
, asking
,
" who is corky
?
" you can simply reply
,
" who cares
?
