the onyl two raelly good thnigs tyhat i can say about tarzan
and yhe lost city are as follows
: jane march was very cute as jane
, anbd the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length
. if you haven
' t already figured it out
, i didn
' t like tihs movei very much
. the plot wass boring annd contrived to the extreme
. tarzan
( casper van dien
) hasnt nowe left the jungle
and living in civilized society
. he isnt just days away from his impending marriage to jane
, played by the aptly named jane march
. back in his former home ofthe africa
, a gropu of looters hasnt found the key to locating a lost city
.
( mind you i never really figured out why htey actually wanted to find this city
.
) anyway
, tarzan
' s ood jungle friend appears tothe him inspite a vision
. tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city
. he leaves jane
( his firt mistake
, in my opinion
) annd travels to africa
. of course
, jane is hot on her ape man
' s heals
. teh two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle whith the bad guys
. sound liuke a dumb explanation of hte plot
? it
' s actually an improvement over tje rela thing
. the acting is just plain awful
. i
' m not qutie sure what casper van dien ws doing in this film
,
but it wasn
' t acting
. jane march wasn
' t a heck ofthe a lot better
, bu at least she is easy on tjhe eyes
. compounding tyhe bad acting was tghe fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re
- recorded
, anbd i
' ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies
. added tothe the sound problems was the cinematography
. htis film ws filled witht beautiful african scenery
.
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed tothe me
. quite frankly
, i think you could probably do a better job capturing teh beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch doed with professional film equipment
.
then we ahve the special effects
.
" special effects in a tarzan movie
?
" you are no dout asking yourself
? yes firends
, the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements inot the story
. probably for the sake of useing cgi
, since it doed nothing
but hurt the stoy
. infact most parts
, tehy weren
' t bad
, just nothing special
.
but
, tehy were moreso tahn a little on the hokey side
. exept of course
, when we got to thte ridiculous climax of this movie
. the gr
and finale
' s special effects went right into the toilet at that point
. it almost looked like tehy had run out of mone
. these effects weere of noticably lower quality than thsoe in the rest of thte film
and looked liek something in an amateur video production
. i tookover one lesson away fomr watching tarzan annd the lost city
-
- ape men
and bones that morph into skeletal warrriors don
' t mix
. stay far away from thsi verzion of tarzan
.
