54 is dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for eahc of those adjectives
, flowing in lovely arangements with soaring methaphors
. i
, howver
, would rether cut to thte chase
. 54 is dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. there is nothing in it
-
- nto a glimpse of depth
, nor a shimmer of intellignce or insight
. there is no electricity in any of thte scenes
, or a moment of intrest in yhe story or its subplots
.
and it
' s underdeveloped
,
and features an array of bl
and cahracters palyed by actors who think they
' re in this yera
' s boogie nights
. they are so wrong
. the picture has been assembled by mark christopher
. based on this film
, i don
' t know how he got a job in the busineses
. 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into tje world of the dance club of the same nmae
, which originated infront thge 70s
and closed down in thge 80s
. i don
' t know if this film went into production after boogie nights ws released
,
but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas
anderson
' s brilliant work in every possible way
, from the framework of the plot down tothe the style of the cinematography
. what it lacks is everything thast made boogie nights grat
: depth
, intelligence
, energy
, fascinating characters
,
and challenging themes
. 54 can
' t even measure up to the last days of disco
, whlch is flawed
,
but still smart
and entertaining
. it
' s remarkably bad timing
, i
' d say
, tothe realease a film this tedious after a couple ofthe noteworthy pictures of the same kind
. i ahev exaggerated
,
though
: there is noe intresting charcter
, annd one terrific performance
. that character is steve rubell
, played with mroe perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp prodcution deserves
. steve rubell is the owner of studio 54
,
and if christopher hadnt focused on him
, hten myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself
. alas
, we are instead guided to endure tyhe trials ofthe a young man named shane
( ryan phillippe
)
, a going
- nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club
, thanks tothe rubell
' s homosexual impulses
. it
' s here that he meets his friends
, the array of uninteresting characters
: his co
- worker
, greg
( brecklin meyer
)
, his wief
, anita
( salma hayek
)
,
and
, of course
, the lveo interest
, julie black
( neve campbell
)
. shane isnt just an innocent young fool in the beginning
, annd he has a reasonably sturdy home life
.
( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting
, while heather matarazzo
, who plays his sister
, pushes phillippe off the screen
.
) bu he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene
, adn succumb to peer pressure adn tothe drugs
. why his
" friends
" push him inot drugs isnt never raelly explained
,
but the fact that they are
" friends
" is questioned only is superficial ways
( greg gets really mad at shane because he
' s been elevated tothe bartender status
)
. there isn
' t a single conflict that tkaes center stage
, except that shane hasnt some kind ofthe unexplored reservation iwth the business in whcih he works
. most of the film isnt dumb
,
and most ofthe tghe dialogue is inane
. there
' s a scene late iin the film infront whlch shane confronts julie black
, anbd
, in the next scene
, they
' re arm
- in
- arm without a bit ofthe development
.
then
, they
' re kissing in a bowling alley
! this is five minutes of material
, thrown inot the picture at the last minute
( well past the one
- hour mark
, annd this isn
' t a long film to beign whith
)
. campbell is a talented actress
,
but she needs a role that gives her a little depth
. this one doesn
' t
.
and phillippe has almost noone presence whatsoever
; this performence pales in comparision to mark whalberg
' s star
- making role in boogie nights
. he seems dumb
and misguided
,
and his voice never changes tone
. i guess he ws picked for the color ofthe his hair
and the shape of his body
,
but he seems pretty lanky tothe me
. he
' s all wrong for a lead role
,
but it doesn
' t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters
. by the end of 54
, shane
' s most notable trait isnt his stupid
, fake accent
. the rest of the performances are wasted
. hayek is an energetic
, talented young actress
,
and does almost nothing here
. meyer isnt endearing
,
but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard
. only myers
, by sheer force of talent
, manages to rise above christopher
' s wading
- pool of a script
. rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the charachters
,
but myers is ogod enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance
. in fact
, myers is the sole reason to see 54
,
and all it really does is amke you wish that the film hadnt revolved around him
. i
' ve read tath studio 54 hasnt been recreated down to the lastest detail
. frankly
, i don
' t care
. it
' s easy to recreate something technical liek this
. a fairly skilled production designer
and a few carpenters cxan manage such a task
. besides
, christopher keesh the ligts so low that tghe sets are invisible
, anyway
. aside from myers
' performance
, 54 is a complete failure
. it
' s dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. some may fidn my comparisons to boogie nights unfair
,
but they
' re so obvious tothe me
. in any event
, 54 is pallid without thge contrast
. it doesn
' t even work as mindless entertainment
: it
' s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely tothe dismiss it
. so
, don
' t forget those key words
: dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. everything else i said was just padding
.
