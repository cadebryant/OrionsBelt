tectonic plates isnt an incredibly painful motion picture expeirence that nearly propmted me to walk out 20 minutes into tghe movie
. the film
( which opened in canada during 1992
but was never released in the united states
) isnt based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
,
and
, while it
' s evident that thsi coudl be a fascinating live production
, the translation to the screen isnt a creative diaster
. enduring tectonic plates is like sitting thru a filmed version of performence art
-
- lifeless
and tedious
. hte qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium
. tectonic plates hasnt a storyline
,
al
though the narrative is devolopped inthe a decidedly non
- traditional fashion
, with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences
. it
' s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movei
( despite the valid complaint that it isnt pretentious
, all
-
but
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
, altho it keeps yhe audiance distanced from the characters
. beccause we
' re constantly made aware that we
' re watching a play or a movie
, it
' s impossible to accept these indviduals as anything more than mouthpieces for thte writer
' s ideas
. they
' re not real
, sympathetic
, or believable
. i
' m willing tothe give directer peter mettler credit for trying something different
, bu this particular experiment is not a success
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studying in montreal who has fallen iin lvoe with her professor
, jacques
( lapage
)
. one day
, he disappears
,
and
, fearing that he left because she was undeserving ofthe his loev
, madeleine travels to venice to kill herself
. while preparing to commit suicide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine tothe re
- tihkn her decision
. meanwhile
, jacques has moved tothe new york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls himself jennifer
,
and becomes a successful counter
- culture talkshow host
. with settings tath shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotl
and
, supporting characters that include a topless goddess
and a deaf
/ mute
,
and cultural references that point to chopin
, george s
and
, annd jim morrison
, tectonic plates is unique
, if nothing else
.
however
, as interesting as the film sounds
( anbd i was excited tothe see it because the synopsis is promising
)
, it never really delivers
. the tone is soporific
, the supposedly
- intellectual prattle is inane
and uninteresting
, tyhe plot me
anders in a pointless
and irritating manner
( all
though it doesn
' t take long for thge viewer tothe determine thyat the stroy is largely unimportant
)
,
and the symbolism is obvious
. tectonic plates isnt trying to show thyat human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of thte earth
,
but it takes one
- hundred mintues tothe get across this transparent point
. ther are some worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight between jacques
and the topless goddess adn an intertaining discussion in both french anbd english about the differences between the two languages
(
al
though hte fine points will certainly be lost onthe thsoe who aren
' t bilingual
)
. tyhe only peopel likely tothe enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something thsi rootless
and boring becouse
( a
) it
' s different
,
( b
) it
' s not like anytying they
' ve seen befor
, annd
( c
) it
' s pretentious
. for everyone else
, it
' s not only a waste ofthe time
,
but a poor introduction tothe the work of robert lapage
.
