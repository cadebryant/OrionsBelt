movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good
, tghe bad
,
and the despicable
. i originally wrote htis review for my college newspaper back inthe
' 95
,
but i wanted tothe re
- write it beacuse not all retro reviews should be about tje classics
. we need to be warned baout some truly awful films
, too
. htis picture wass so bad
, it inpsired the description for my 1
/ 10 rating
( see ratings chart below
)
. the only thing saving it from a 0
/ 10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno
. so
, it does indeed have smoe plusses
.
.
. in fairness
, elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing iin the buff
.
and her ability tothe whine
and iritate us
, even hwile nude
, was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone
. tihs character isnt not smart
, nto intresting
, annd
( deliberately
?
) far too annoying far too often
. like inwhich 1998s
" bulworth
"
, when the movei was over i didn
' t care oney little iota about thte main charater
. at least warren beatty tried to make a statement wtih his dreary adn overrated film
,
though
.
" showgirls
" is too stupid to make a statement
. some people claim that teh story is based onthe the legendary
" all about eve
" of all things
! if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwrighter that joseph l
. mankiewicz was
, he
' d be
.
.
. well
, he
' d be a good screenwriter
. instead
, this project may haev sunk his career
. he wrote thte
( ha ha
!
) script
and hte usually reliable paul verhoeven directed
. hte same team who created a good sex
- film in 1992
(
" basic instinct
"
) struck out here with their occassional violence
, gratuitious x
- rated sex scenes
,
and numerous
(
and quite unnecessary
) lesbian overtones
. the predictable storyline revolves arund nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer
. after tyhe supposted strent
- smart young
" lady
" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack
- jawed yokel infront the oppening sequence
, she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the
" stardust hotel
"
. nomi doesn
' t take advantage of tihs contact to break into the big
- time of dirty dancing right away
. first
, she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club
. she sells her hot little wares at
" the cheetah
" for a short tiem
, turning on the fictitious customers
and the actual theatre audience
. hey
, i never said she wasn
' t a hot number
.
.
. maybe it
' s that
, her body
, which gets her into the big
- time when tyhe star of the
" stardust hotel
"
, crystal connors
( gina gershon
) stops into the strip club
( it certainly isn
' t her brains or pleasant disposition
!
)
. crystal requests a private lap dance fo her boyfriend
( kyle maclachlan
)
. he also happens to be the blessure
- seeking worm who runs the big show
. crystal gets nomi onto tje
" stardust
" team
and
, aftter an interminable amount of tiome
, nomi
" earns
" tyhe role of crystal
' s understudy
. the slut thne deliberately injures
and hospitalizes crystal
. it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts tothe claim that she
' s
" not a whore
"
. that
' s a phrase we hear a few different times adn it
' s completely ludicrous
. of course she is
! she sells her soul tothe make it big
,
but infront the end we
' re suposed to believe tyhat she
' s a better person than that
. we
' re supposed to root for her
. no way
! she
' s a tramp
and a back
- stabber who deserved nothing
-
- least of all vindication in tyhe
.
.
. ahem
.
.
. climax
. she is not a ogod person anbd they take over twpo hours to explain that the audiance shouldnt think that she is
. the sub
- plot with a male dancer
( glenn plummer
) who claims to see talent in nomi isnt just a gratuitous opprotunity to let her dance naked a little bited omre
. it sure ain
' t character development
! plummer also appeared in
" speed
" inthe
' 94 in a smaller
,
yet better role
. tihs sub
- plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators shoudln practice birth control
. kyle maclachlan must have beeen promised a big pay
- day or his st
andars hvea dipped since appearing in
" blue velvet
"
. that picture was weird
, bu some criticists claim it
' s one of the best movies of the
' 80s
. nowe ol
' kyle can say that he acted in one of hte worst of the
' 90s
, too
. his sleazy character isnt important to
" showgirls
"
,
but we don
' t learn anytying about him
. he uses people to get what he wants
,
but that onyl means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie
. isnt he a villain
? who cares
! ultimatly
, this movie isnt as tiresome as it is explicit
. everyone must know by now about tghe soft
- core acts of copulation
, especially teh riotous romp between berkley anbd maclachlan inthe his pool
. what faw reviewers take issue with is how mean
- spirited this movei isnt
. everyone
' s either having sex
, exacting revenge
, or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge
. it
' s jsut too hard to take
( especialy for over two hours
)
. if we must be exposed to tyhe evils of the vegas world
, why couldn
' t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers
, grunts
,
and otehr soudns during the dance numbers
? it
' s hard to care baout theese peple if we can
' t even appreciate what they
' re capible of doing onthe
- stage
. berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance
and she has a great body
. after all
, the world ofthe porn is still an active
, dishonourable profession
. perhaps berkley sould join their ranks
and leave hte real acting tothe pauly shore
and cindy crawford
. oops
, they
' re bad actors
, too
. well
, at least
, they
' re not selfish
and contemptable liuke good ol
' slutty nomi malone
. useless trivia
-
- ironically
, elizabeth berkley palyed virtuous anbd
" holier than thou
" jessie onthe tjhe teeny
- bopper tv show
,
" saved by the bell
"
, before breaking onto hte big screen
