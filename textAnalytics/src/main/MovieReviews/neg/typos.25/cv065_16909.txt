movei reviewers have an obligation to see the good
, the bad
,
and thge dispicable
. i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in ' 95
,
bu i wanted to re
- write it because not all retro reviews should be baout hte classics
. we need to be warned baout some truely awful films
, too
. this picture was so bad
, it inspired the description for my 1
/ 10 rating
( see ratings chart below
)
. the only hting saving it from a 0
/ 10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno
. so
, it does indeed ahev some plusses
.
.
. in fairness
, elizabeth berkley isnt certainly worth seing in the buff
.
annd her abillity to whine
and iritate us
, even while nude
, wass appropriate inspite her role as selfish temptress nomi malone
. this character isnt not smart
, not interesting
,
and
( deliberately
?
) far too annoying far too often
. like in 1998s
" bulworth
"
, when the movie was over i didn ' t care one little iota about the main character
. at least warren beatty tried to make a statement withthe his dreary
and overrated film
,
though
.
" showgirls
" is too stupid to make a statment
. some people claim that the story isnt based on tyhe legendary
" all about eve
" of all things
! if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half thge screenwriter that joseph l
. mankiewicz was
, he ' d be
.
.
. well
, he ' d be a good screenwrighter
. instead
, this project may have sunk his career
. he wrote the
( ha ha
!
) script
and tje usually reliable paul verhoeven directed
. the smae team who creaeted a good sex
- film in 1992
(
" basic instinct
"
) struck outloud here with thier occasional voilence
, gratuitous x
- rated sex scenes
,
and numerous
(
and quite unnecessary
) lesbian overtones
. the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer
. after the supposed strent
- smart young
" lady
" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack
- jawed yokel in the opening sequence
, she befriends a tailor ofthe the glamorous stage production at yhe
" stardust hotel
"
. nomi doesn ' t take advantage of this contact to break into teh big
- time of dirty dancing right awya
. first
, she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club
. she sells her hot littel wares at
" tyhe cheetah
" for a short time
, turning on the fictitious customers
and the actual theatre audience
. hey
, i never said she wasn ' t a hot number
.
.
. maeby it ' s that
, her body
, which gets her into the big
- timne wehn tghe star ofthe hte
" stardust hotel
"
, crystal connors
( gina gershon
) stops into the strip club
( it certainly isn ' t her brains or pleasant disposition
!
)
. crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend
( kyle maclachlan
)
. he aslo happens tothe be the pleasure
- seeking worm who runs the big show
. crystal gets nomi onto the
" stardust
" team
and
, after an interminable ammount ofthe tiome
, nomi
" earns
" the role ofthe crystal ' s understudy
. the slut
then deliberatly injures
and hospitalizes crystal
. it was almost laughable that nomi had tjhe guts to claim that she ' s
" not a whore
"
. that ' s a phrase we hear a few different times
and it ' s completly ludicrous
. of course she isnt
! she sells her soul to make it big
,
but in tyhe end we ' re suppoed to eblieve that she ' s a better person than taht
. we ' re suppossed to root fo her
. no way
! she ' s a tramp
and a bakc
- stabber who deserved nothing
-
- least ofthe all vindication in the
.
.
. ahem
.
.
. climax
. she is not a good person
and they take over two hurs tothe explain that the audeince should htikn that she is
. the sub
- plot with a male dancer
( glenn plummer
) who claimes tothe see talent inthe nomi is jstu a gratuitous opprotunity tothe let her dance naked a little bit more
. it sure ain ' t carachter development
! plummer also appeared in
" speed
" in ' 94 inwhich a smaller
,
yot better role
. htis sub
- plot goes absolutely nowhere exept maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control
. kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay
- day or his standards have dipped since appearing in
" blue velvet
"
. that picture was weird
,
bu some critics claim it ' s one of the best movies ofthe the ' 80s
. now ol ' kyle can sday that he acted in oney of the worst ofthe the ' 90s
, too
. his sleazy character is important to
" showgirls
"
,
but we don ' t leran anything about him
. he uses people to git what he wants
,
but tath only means thast he fits in well with the other characters in tihs movei
. is he a villain
? who cares
! ultimatly
, this movie isnt as tiresome as it is explicit
. everyone must know by nowe about the soft
- core acts of copulation
, especially the riotous romp between berkley
adn maclachlan in his pool
. what faw reviewers take issue with is how mean
- spirited this movie is
. everyone ' s eather having sex
, exacting revenge
, or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge
. it ' s just too hard to tkae
( especially for over two housr
)
. if we must be exposed to the evils of yhe vegas world
, why couldn ' t verhoeven have aslo made a point ofthe highlighting the whispers
, grunts
,
and other sounds during the dance numbers
? it ' s hard to care about these people if we cant ' t even appreciate waht they ' re capable of doing on
- stage
. berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance
and she has a gerat body
. after all
, the world of porn is still an active
, dishonourable profession
. perhaps berkley could join their ranks
anbd leave the real acting to pauly shore
anbd cindy crawford
. oops
, htey ' re bad actors
, too
. well
, at least
, they ' re not selfish
adn contemptable liuke good ol ' slutty nomi malone
. useless trivia
-
- ironically
, elizabeth berkley played virtuous
and
" holier than thou
" jessie on the teeny
- bopper tv sohw
,
" saved by the bell
"
, before breaking onto the big screen
.
