the most interesting part of
" can
' t hardly wait
" just happens to be not only the most human
,
but for many of us
, the one part that many of us can easily relate to
. that is the character of denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, the film
' s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything taht goes on in the film
,
and at one point sits down on a couch annd looks totally bored
. the film wisely holds over this moment
, nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high skool party
.
.
. almost too nicely
. for some members of the audience
( read
: me
)
, this is basically a mirror of what
' s going on iwth them watching this film
. we sit there wondering why we
' ve even bothered to see a film about a long high skool party we probablly never felt the desire to go to infront tghe frist place
. i woudl actually highly reccomend this film if it satirized all of tihs
. affter all
, this film isnt filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much ofthe which i went tothe high skool iwth
. everyone
' s here
: the jock
, the homecoming queen
, the nerd
(
and his dominions of trekkies adn x
- philes
)
, tyhe alienated wannabe writer
, the school spirit girl
, the pothead
( s
)
, the wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
,
and weirdly anough this film shows them as superficial
, lame
, adn basicaly as a bunch ofthe losers
. except for denise
, who rolls her eyes at everything
, annd easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something which isnt done for each main charcter
, quotes oscar wilde
- definite pointers there
)
. unfortunately
, the writers
and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable
and even likable film
. the film
, as i said
, portrays most ofthe its charachters as superficial
and jsut totally ignorant to everything
.
however
, instade of sticking with this
, perhaps even going a bit further with it
, they let this lie
,
and actually make theese characters into our heroes
. we folow several of them
, all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity
and realism
,
and tries to tell boring
and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actualy cared
and
/ or identifed iwth them
.
and if we doed
, we certainly don
' t wanna tothe revisit thyat state of being
. here
' s a quick low
- down
: it
' s graduation
, anbd we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night
, otherwise known as the
" american grafitti
" or
, to a lesser extent
, the
" dazed adn confused
" cliche
. thte formal just followed them as htey drove aimlessly
; the latter doed a little bit ofthe that
and featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" cin
' t hardly wait
" just opts for a big indoor keg party
,
and a little bit of aimless driving
, albeit of the i
' m
- whining
- because
- i
- cxan
' t
- get
- a
- girl
- i
- want br
and
. we followup many peopel around
,
but mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, ofthe
" that thing you do
!
"
)
, tjhe alienated writer
, who
' s been pining over the homcoming queen
, am
anda
( tjhe totally overrated jennifer love hewitt
)
, for tghe entirety ofthe high school because he thikns they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart
. now that she
' s broken up with her football player boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides tothe go to the party with a note he
' s written declaring his
" love
" forthe her in tyhe hopes he
' ll build up the guts to give it to her
.
.
. even
though he
' s leaving for a multi
- week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut
( okay
: tjhe ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. since that plot is incredibly lame annd a track record of what goes onthe with it wouldn
' t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film
,
and because it
' s a party
, there are some more main characters
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, finally surfacing after
" dick tracy
"
)
, the nerd
(
and his dominions
) who has cmo uv with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike
, who
' s humiliated him for years
,
but gets too caught up inthe drinking to do it
; kenny
( seth gren
)
, thte wigger
, who has decided that this party will be where he wiull finally get laid
( uh huh
)
;
and denise
, the only exeptional character
, who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom
( don
' t ask
) with kenny where the two charactors let down their characters
and are alowed to follow the laws of plot cliches ffrom point a to point b with nary a bit ofthe characterization involved after awhile
. ugh
. the main comparison this film is getting to anohter film isnt actually not
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed adn confused
,
" twpo films that embraced annd ultimately made humans out ofthe many of its high schoolers
( not to mention were extremely entertaining
)
,
but to john hughes films ofthe the 80s
, most notably
" sixteen c
andles
.
" the big difference in the two is thta that film managed to not only embrace
but even satirize its main characters
,
and did so equally
and in an intertaining fashon
. this film forgets to satirize its charachters
,
and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes
.
.
.
and
then says thyat it
' s all okay
. we can
' t take this film seriously
, nor can we tkae this as funn
, so really waht ogod is it
?
but i will tell you some things i did like
: i liked the direction
, except for a couple too
- over
- the
- top features
, liek way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it
' s like an oxymoron
)
and other obscurities
. generaly
,
though
, elfont
and kaplan do have gracefull camera movement
,
and even manage to capture an altman
- esque fiel to their film from time tothe time
( a thnig with a onot
,
though
, is too hokey to really be admirable
)
. i acutally did like seth green
, for once in baout a decade
( when he played a very young woody allen in
" radio days
"
)
- his desintegration ofthe his wigger charachter ws almost believable
.
.
. almost
. annd
, of course
, lauren ambrose is wonderfull as denise
, the one character we could have used some more of
, even
though it owudl have changed hte entirety of tyhe film
. howver
, the character of denise really doesn
' t work with the film
, when raelly
thought about
. she
' s far too witty annd realized
( at least for yhe first half
) to belong infact tihs film
,
and whenever she appears
, she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone
. she
' s not just the cynic or tje intelectual
; she
' s just a very interesting chracter who provides enteratinment even if it further damages other already damaged characters
. she may ruin the film moreso
,
but at least when she
' s on screen we cant sit up
and thiunk to ourselves
" well
, at least we
' ll be entertained
.
" a couple other things tht just don
' t work
: mike
' s charactor
, who suffers an epiphany throughtout thge film
but inaddition hte end acts as
though he has forgotten everything
: too much tyhe sacrificial lamb for the film inwhich genaral
; the aimless
, bitchy driving by preston to try
and get over his inability to shack up with am
anda
- give me a break
;
and perhaps the one thing that just doesn
' t work at all
: jenna eflman
' s uncredited cameo as an angel
- jstu didn
' t work
,
but nice try
. basically the worst thing about this film
, tyhe rela reason i
' m giving this such a low rating
, is becasue it refuses to give us any fully realized characters
and
then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doign thigns that are inane
and unlike anything we
' d do
. we don
' t feel for these characters because for most of us
, we aren
' t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots
. the acid test for high school movies isnt
: does it at all capture the feel of what it
' s portraing
? yhe answer fo this film is no
. nice try
,
though
.
