around the end ofthe 1998
, a japanese cartoon came to the usa television
, annd really wasn
' t that big
. infront fact not many people even knew what pokemon was
,
but infact 1999 it hit big with kids
and adults aplikay
,
and became one of the biggest franchises
and merch
andise seller ofthe all time
. in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon
: the frist movie which forthe what it was
, wasn
' t all that bad
. it grossed
$ 31 million in its opening weekend
, annd went onthe to make almost
$ 90 million
. fans thougth it was great
and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: the movie 2000
" which is far inferior tothe the original animated movie
. first up is the plot
, whic there realy isn
' t much of
, inthe fact the plot what there isnt
: a bad guy trying to destory the ancient never befor seen pokemon
, lugia
, is about it
, except the fatc thgat ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try
and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever
. well there yuo go
, ofthe course ash is folowed by his friends misty
, brock
, gary
and his pokemon firends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, the usual
. even
though the frist movei wasn
' t a gerat film
, it was definately an enjoyable well
- made movie with an actuall thin storyline
. this newyorker movei howver isnt nothing
but garbage
, there is nothing good to it storywise
, anbd its only good thing comes from some plush animation adn colors
. compaired to the frist film
, this movei is awfully bl
and
, from its opening titles
, to the end titles it tries its best to work
,
but fails miserably at every corner
. the characters are 1
- dimentional
, the story thin as chicken broth
, adn the writting very lame
. even the so called action scenes are extremely lame
, annd falls before it even gets a chance to go
. the voices even aren
' t tyhat ogod
and allmost feels liuke tjhe stars don
' t want to be there
, liuke they cxan tell that htis is an extremel bad movie
. which it certainly is
. the film hasnt one thing gonig for it
and that isnt the animation
,
al
though not up to disney st
andards
, it is still very good with some interesting cgi
' s
and very colorful animation
, the colors jump out at ytou very fast
,
and seem very nicely put on film
. why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered
, hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash
. forthe now watch the first one
. its much much better
.
