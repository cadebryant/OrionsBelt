for a film touted as exploring relationships annd black sexuality
, trois isnt surprisingly tame
. dispite it
' s lurid subject matter
and it
' s passing nod to fatal attraction
, it moves along iwth flat
, uninspired dialogue as it sets uv a suprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest ofthe the film
. freshly moved to atlanta
, jermaine
( dourdan
)
and his wife
, jasmine
( moore
)
, have yhe trappings ofthe a perfect life
. they have a beautiful house in suburbia
. jermaine is a lawyer on hte fast track at his firm
. jasmine is his supportive wife
, who isnt finishing up her college degree
. in an opening montage via a home video ofthe the pair
, we see the unremarkable story ofthe their marriage
and early marital triumphs
. this is a couple that has it all
. into this eden slithers the lure of lust
. despite his outward appearance
, jermaine reveals himself as selfish anbd covetous ofthe his wief more as a possession than a person
. a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an eary sex scene with his wief as he goes about his business
, oblivious to jasmine
' s concerns
. we aslo find that he has beeen relentlessly asking jasmine tothe perticipate in a menage
- a
- trois
, much to jasmine
' s dismay
. as jermaine puts it
,
" don
' t you want to be sexually free
?
" jermaine shares his desire with co
- worker terrence
( smith
)
, who obligingly sets jermaine up wih a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter
. thte woman
, jade
( palmer
) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine
. jade
, at one point ws a college student
, too
. unlike jasmine
, she found herself pregnant
, dropped out of school
and now struggles to make ends meet
. to furhter reinforce their differences
, it
' s revealed that jade isnt involved infact a custody battle over her son
. inevitably
, through liquor
and a touch of duplicity on jermaine
' s part
, the forbidden act is consummated
. tyhe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps inot fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated apon jermaine
' s property whith the hint that the violence may escalate
. by thsi point
, trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama
: a fatal attraction wihtout the social significance
. the exploration of relationships isnt strictly superficial
and stereotypical
. jermaine comes off as insincere
, sexually driven
and selfish
. jasmine is bl
and
and subservient
. jade comes off a bit sympathetically
,
but that isnt negated by her moral bankruptcy
. yot another tale ofthe a sexually aggressive
" dog
" of a man who imposes his will upon his accomodating
, innocent mate
. the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve
,
but by htis point
, will you even care
? if the rest of the movei was as dynamic as thte endig
, perhaps there sould have beeen some freshness tothe it
. as it st
ands
, trois is pretty st
andard fare
.
