the most absurd remake ofthe 1998
? it ' s a toss up between gus van sant ' s pyscho
and mighty joe young
, the newyorker disney picture based on the ood rko picture
.
( i knew i was inwhich trouble wehn a polished
, computer
- generated version of thta famous rko logo appeared before thte head credits
.
) there is no great demand for another giant ape movie
- mkea that ape movei
, period
.
( witness the quick deaths ofthe buddy
, born tothe be wild
and congo
.
)
and hwile this latest entry is inoffensive
and watchable
, it ' s also an assembly line product through
and through
, lacking thte charm
and unpredictability of tghe jungle serials that partly inspired it
. theron is jill young
: as a young girl inthe the wilds ofthe africa
, she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers
. that baby gerilla
( nicknamed joe
) grows to immense propotions
,
and adult jill basically bides her time looking affter him
, playing hide
and seek whith him
and guarding him against poachers
. enter conservationist greg
( paxton
)
, who convinces jill to move with joe to california
, where they cin protect him better in a controled environment
. joe is restless at first
; no sooner does he finally settle in to the newyorker place than those nasty poachers show uv infact l
. a
.
, plotting joe ' s demise
. suffice it to sday
, the movie could have beeen called
" joe
: ape inwhich the city
.
" theron
( so good inspite devil ' s advocate
)
adn paxton
( so good in the receet a simple plan
) are fine actors
,
but not fine enought tothe transsend the material
, a paint
- by
- numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv
annd mercury rising
. the plot arguably borrows more fomr steven spielberg ' s the lost world tahn the 1949 original
, with the cmoputer
- generated t
- rex
- i mean
, joe
- wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore
; the storytelling becomes especially lazy durring this final third
, with jill shouting
,
" look
, joe ' s headed for the movei theatre
!
" followed by a shot of joe scaling mann ' s chineese theater
; a moment later
, jill shouts again something like
" look
, joe ' s headed for an amusement park
!
"
adn what do you know
, there ' s joe at the pallisades carnival
, scaring thge bejesus outloud of innocent thrillseekers
. hte seams of lsat
- minute edits to mighty joe young show
- unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves
. thte movei sure feels uneven
, reguardless
: ect twpo is underdeveloped
, hwile a little of joe smashing cars inaddition act threee goes a long
, long way
. underwood
( tremors
, speechless
) was perhpas not the director for thge job
; even the plentiful
, untamed landscape looks dull in his hands
.
( capturing tjhe beauty ofthe nature requires mroe tahn his point
and shoot sytle
.
) i did enjoy certain sequences
, especially teh demoliton of a black
- tie dinner sequence
;
and the prologue
,
however implausible
, is touching
.
( as a tyke
, joe acts just like e
. t
.
) rick baker ' s make
- up effects
and puppetry are outstanding
, the real star of the show
-
yet
, for all its technical flawlessness
, the creature remains too grumpy
anbd homicidal to love
.
( his facial expressions are varations onthe a scowl
.
) tothe be fair
, i saw mighty joe young iin a cinema packed with wailing childrens
- it ' s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue
. it ' s certainly not a film for very young kids
- intense fighting scenes may scare them
, while any time joe ' s not on camera may bore them tothe tears
.
( note
: older boys are more likely tothe be dazzled by theron ' s colourful array of tank tops
.
) i suspect bland mighty joe young isnt passable entertainment for a family outing
,
but htey sure don ' t make
? em like they used tothe
.
