the most absurd remake ofthe 1998
? it
' s a toss up between gus van sant
' s psycho
and mighty joe young
, the new disney picture based onthe the ood rko picture
.
( i knew i was infront trouble when a polished
, computer
- generated version ofthe that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits
.
) there is no great dem
and for another giant ape movei
- amking that ape movei
, perido
.
( wittness tje quick deaths ofthe buddy
, born to be wild
and congo
.
) adn hwile this latest entry is inoffensive
and watchable
, it
' s also an assembly line product through
and through
, lacking the charm
and unpredictability of the jungle serials thast partly inspired it
. theron is jill young
: as a young girl iin the wilds of africa
, she befriended a baby gorilla affter both their mothers weere slain by poachers
. that baby gorilla
( nicknamed joe
) grows to immense proportions
,
and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him
, playing hide
and seek with him
and guarding him against poachers
. enter conservationist greg
( paxton
)
, who convinces jill to move with joe to california
, where they cin protect him better in a controlled environment
. joe is restless at first
; noone sooner doesnt he finally settle in tothe the new place than thsoe nasty poachers show up in l
. a
.
, plotting joe
' s demise
. suffice it to say
, the movei could haev been called
" joe
: ape in the city
.
" theron
( so good inspite devil
' s advocate
)
and paxton
( so ogod in the recent a simple plan
) are fine actors
,
but nto fine enough to transsend thge material
, a paint
- by
- numbers script from the hack writers ofthe superman iv annd mercury rising
. the plot arguably borrows mroe from steven spielberg
' s tyhe lost world than tjhe 1949 original
, iwth hte computer
- generated t
- rex
- i mean
, joe
- wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore
; the storytelling becomes expecially lazy during this final third
, with jill shouting
,
" look
, joe
' s headed for the movei theatre
!
" followed by a shot ofthe joe scaling mann
' s chineese theather
; a moent later
, jill shouts again something liuke
" look
, joe
' s headed for an amusement park
!
" anbd what do you know
, there
' s joe at the pallisades carnival
, scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers
. the seams of last
- minute edits to mighty joe young show
- unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves
. the movei sure fiels uneven
, regardless
: ect two is underdeveloped
, while a littel of joe smashing cars inthe act three goes a long
, long way
. underwood
( tremors
, speechless
) was perhaps not the directer for the job
; even the plentiful
, untamed l
andscape looks dull in his h
ands
.
( capturing thge beauty of nature requires more than his point
and shoot sytle
.
) i did enjoy certain sequences
, especially the demoliton ofthe a black
- tye dinner sequence
;
and the prologue
, howver implausible
, is touching
.
( as a tyke
, joe acts just like e
. t
.
) rick baker
' s make
- up effects
and puppetry are outst
anding
, the real star ofthe the show
- yot
, for all its technical flawlessness
, the creature remains too grumpy annd homicidal tothe love
.
( his facial expressions are variations onthe a scowl
.
) to be fair
, i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children
- it
' s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue
. it
' s certainly not a film fo very young kids
- intense fighting scenes may scare them
, hwile any time joe
' s nto on camera may bore them to tears
.
( note
: older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron
' s colourful array of tank tops
.
) i suspect bl
and mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing
,
but they sure don
' t make
? em like they used tothe
.
