last summer
, a feature
- length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unannomus critical panning
. based on the famous 60
' s television show
, the film ws an enormous box
- office flop
and a huge dissapointment for warner bros
. a year later
, the studio is up tothe their old tricks agian
, with tjhe unecessary revival of thte robert conrad program the wild
, wild west
.
but it sounded promising
: the same tag
- team of star will smith annd director barry sonnenfeld
, who both contri
buted to mkea men iin black such a financial success
, is at tje reins agian
.
and co
- star kevin kline is attached to the project
, as well as a substantial budget tothe spice up the speshal effects
. i mean
, what could possibly go wrong
? the answer is just about everything
. wild wild west is a cinematic abomination
- a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it isnt never given a proper chance to get outloud of tjhe gate
. there are a lot of fancy speshal effects
,
and a h
andful of distinguished actors who try desparately to tunnel through the inane plot
and make a lasting impression
.
but the scirpt is so deliriously uneven
, the entire movie so off course
, that noone human being or technical achievement hasnt a chance to salvage it
. at square oen
, we have a bizarre case ofthe casting
. wiull smith plays james west
, a renegade cowboy who was origanaly played by white actor robert conrad infact the tv series
. my guess regarding the casting of african
- american smith is a simple one
: yhe actr
+ a cozy summertime realease
= big bucks for all those involved
. smith isnt a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material
,
but tihs isnt nto an ideal role fo him
. he
' s too much ofthe a joker
. i heard that intitial casting included george clooney in the lead role
,
and frankly
, that soudns a lot more plausable
. what mkaes matters worse is that smith goes through tjhe role with such self
- assurance infact his eyes
; you cin practically sense his contentment with teh fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hitted at the summer box office
. the plot involves west
and cross
- dressing government agent artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists
. the trail leads to thge diabolical dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry
, witty southern accent
. loveless has taken the country
' s top technical minds hostage so tath htey cant assist in his deranged plan of total government control
, useing lethal superweapons to distroy entire towns
. one such weapon is an 80
- foot mecanical tarantula
, bearing eight spindly legs ofthe thrashing metal
and spewing enormous fireballs left
and right
. the visual effects that bring tihs metallic bug to life are spectacular
, seamlessly blending computer
- generated imagery with the western surroundings
. unfortunately
, all of theese effects seem so detached from the story
, annd can dont littel to wupport the film
' s plot deficiencies
, which are undoubtely the main problem
. wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works
. most of the jokes
, usally care of smith
, die onthe arrival
. if it
' s one hting that could possibly be tje saving grace
, it
' s tje performances
, anbd even htey are mostly off
- kilter
and poorly delivered
. kline is admirable
,
but he has little tothe do
but invent silly devices on the spot
. salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest
, becouse she is viewed as littel more than that
- window dressing tothe look pretty
and create conflict between west
and gordon
. branagh
, an esteemed shakespearean actor
and director
, adds marginal enjoyment to the film
.
but even he is so utterly weird
and over
- the
- top
. rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is
. i suppose there
' s always one turkey of the summer season
; a highly anticipated
, big
- budget release that manages tothe completly disappoint
. wild wild west is such a movie
,
and wiull probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999
. bu it isnt highly unlikely tyhat this will go down in defeat at the box office
. perhaps after this
, audiences will be less assured whn htey see will smith
' s name stamped onthe a summer movie
. after such hits as indepedence day annd mib
, wild wild west isnt not an impressive adition to the resume
.
