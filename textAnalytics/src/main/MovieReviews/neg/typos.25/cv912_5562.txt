my intertube flag ws at half
- mast last year when nick at nite pulled
" dragnet
" reruns off teh air
. sure
, i
' d seen them all at least once
, bu i could allways count on at least a few inadvertent laughs fomr ultra
- serious jack webb when ther wass nothing else on tv
. even
though
" dragnet
" isnt out of circulation at thge moment
, we webb anti
- fans still have the d
. i
.
, a 50
' s propag
anda piece for the military thta is almost as hillarious as the famouse
" blue boy
" episode of
" dragnet
.
" for anyone like me who got laughs out ofthe webb
' s rapid
- fire speeches adn straight
- faced seriousness
, thiunk of the d
. i
. as wqat would happen if sgt
. joe friday ever enlisted
, because he plays exactly the smae character here
, a no
- nonsense ood fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation anbd loves to give long
- winded
, melodramatic speeches on any topic
. in this election year
, i
' m more conviced tahn ever thast webb annd bob dole were separated at birth
. the movei opens in characteristic fashion as oen recruit after another knocks onthe webb
' s office door
and enters
. he gives each one a different series ofthe cranky criticisms befor the credits come up
. the
" produced adn directed by jack webb
" card pretty much goes without saying
. this is his movie all teh way
,
and after thte firt twenty mintues of him chewing out his recruits for no reason
, i was wondering if there would even be a plot
. i certainly woudl have been entertained by an hour
and a half of trademark webb rants
, bu the d
. i
. gives us mroe
-
- much more
. webb
' s mission is tothe mkae a man outloud of private owens
, the local screw
- up
. the captain gives webb threee days to convert owens into marine material or
, tje captain will
" personally cut the lace off his panties
and ship him out myself
.
"
( whether the
" lace panties
" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered
.
) this
, ofthe course
, gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on mkaing owens
' life a living hell
. fo those of you who haven
' t beeen indoctrinated into tjhe pleasures of webb watching
, here
' s a reprint of a typical monologue of his
. i can
' t duplicate his hillarious delivery on pappr
, bu the words should at least partialy convey what i
' m talking about
.
.
.
" now you listen to me
, youngster
. someday you
' ll wake up fighting on a beach
and you
' ll pray to god somebody doesn
' t get killed because of your foolishness
.
.
. i
' ve got a headline for ytou
: eveyr time you mkea one of those little mistakes of yours
, you
' re gonna turn around
and i
' ll be st
anding right there
.
" i couldn
' t write down all tghe reprintable dialogue from the d
. i
.
( nearly all ofthe it belongs infact tyhe bad movie hall ofthe fame
)
,
but i tryed tothe include some ofthe tjhe moreso notewothy lines
, liuke one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day
' s work by going to the local bar
( where he orders a tomato juice
)
. he meets a woman who
, coincidentally
, also orders tomato juice
but walks awya from a typically
- stimulating conversation whith webb to flirt with his arch
- rival
, anohter marine d
. i
. webb marches over to the table
, gets up inaddition her face
and sasy
,
" just what kind ofthe a dame do yuo think yuo are
?
" bogart he ain
' t
. tyhe other d
. i
. gets one of the few memorable non
- webb lines when he confesses tothe the girl
,
" he
' s a damn good d
. i
.
.
.
. i guess i
' m just a little jelous
.
" join tjhe club
, we
' re all jealous of jack webb
' s way with women
, whcih is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene
, as webb finds his way to the woman
' s place of employment
, a lingerie store
,
and st
ands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display
.
" you expect me to talk to ytou
.
.
. in
_ here
_
?
!
" he exclaims
, noone doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras
. the woman goes off to help a customer
, leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen
. a little girl spots him in hte sotre
and dem
ands
,
" what are you doing in here
.
.
. yuo
' re a man
, aren
' t you
?
" he doesn
' t reply
,
but you know he
' s thinking inaddition his head
,
" whta an odd speices of human
-
- so small
. must be oen of those children everyone
' s been talking about
.
" this poor girl
, scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb
, would later swaer off tjhe male gender entirely
, just one ofthe the many lesbian conversions he
' s responsible for
. the movie doesn
' t focus too closely onthe webb
' s romance
, it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie
, where webb forces his platoon tothe spend tyhe entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills
. after twpo privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea
, webb asks owens
,
" wass that flea you killed a male or female
?
" owens replies
,
" a male
, sir
.
" webb yells to tghe platoon
,
" thsi ain
' t the one
!
" that such a scene
( along with the rest ofthe teh movie
) wass intended tothe be tooked seriously defies comment
.
but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation iin tghe making of the d
. i
.
,
but for iwo jima
, guadalcanal
and every otehr major battle of tyhe frist half of tje 20th century
. webb held the miliraty in such high esteem thta all the soldiers in the movie
( wiht the exception of owens
) were played by actual marines
. somene wanting to parody this movie couldn
' t do a more comical job than webb did
. it makes it all teh more ironical
( like raeeyain on your wedding day
) that the man hadnt no sence of humor himself
. htere
' s a scene inaddition the movie where tje guys are on their break time discusting something
and one of them breaks into laughter
. webb bursts in the room anbd shouts
,
" whta did i tell you baout laughing
?
!
" to whic the private replies
,
" sir
, only nine
- year
- old girls laugh
, sir
!
" adn let me tell you
, i was as happy as a nine
- year
- old girl while watching this movie
