" there will be another
,
" the ads forthe this sequal proclaimed
, anbd why not
? true
, br
andon lee isnt dead
,
but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994
' s tghe crow
, anyway
. tghe idea ofthe spinning artist james o
' barr
' s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around tjhe notion that a different startled soul would come back fomr the dead in each movie
, tkaing its own righteous vengeance against the world
. given that basic framework
, the story could move in any number of directions
. of course
, it doesn
' t
. stubbornly
, yhe crow
: city of angels backtracks tothe the beginning of the previous film
, when lee
' s eric draven found himself drawn back outloud of his grave to dont a charles bronson on thte thugs who tortured him annd his girlfriend to death
. i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality
. inaddition flashback
, we see the most excrutiating crimes exacted onthe eric
and his lover
,
and thn we watch in real
- time as eric pays eahc perpetrator back in kind
. it
' s loud
and repetitive
, true
, a sadist
' s delight
-
-
but it
' s also horrifying adn fascinating
. city ofthe angels gives us moreso of the same
, bu less skillfully
. there
' s an audience guranteed for a film like this
,
al
thought bad reviews
and poore word
- of
- mouth will likely ensure that it won
' t be much of a sucess
. in fact
, miramax subsidary dimension films wass so fearful ofthe tjhe critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings
.
( i
' ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic
, since good notices have never been key tothe the success of movies like teh crow
.
) so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup
. this timne
, ashe
( french
- accented actor vincent perez
) is retrieved from his watery death
( he
and his young son were shackled toghether
, shot
, anbd
then thrown off a pier
) by the crow who serves as his link vetween the worlds of the living
and the dead
. perez might have smoe screen presense if he
' s given something to dont with himselv
,
but here he
' s simpley thrown in front ofthe tghe camera as a pretty face
. at first
, he
' s shivery
and frightened
,
but he quicklyu recovers from thge shock of his own death
and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave
. he
' s befriended by sarah
( mia kirshner
)
, presumably an older verison of the child who narrated the frist film
. kirshner
, so beguiling in exotica
, is here an exquisitely photographed blank
. tattooed witht angels
' wings
, sarah isnt just about as lovely as women come
,
but she serves noone purpose
, not even as seductress
. teh gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly comm
anded by judah
( richard brooks
)
, bu a far mroe interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop
, who plays a gaunt fellow named curve
. iggy
, all bones
, veins
,
and drawl
, is the only one who seems to have shared in the asethetic of ruin tht defines this film
. like all good thigsn here
, he
' s despatched too soon
and without much imagination
. infront the meantime
, we
' re subjected tothe tedious glimpses of judah
' s compound
, where bondage is the order of tjhe day
and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s
& m fantasies that woudl seem shy ofthe the cutting edge even if they weren
' t distinctly secondh
and
. even the soundtrack is tired
. more than anything i
' ve seen from hollywood lately
, city ofthe angels smacks baldly of product
-
- it
' s a movei witht a lousy script
but a great look
. criticists ahve beeen quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope
,
but his work isn
' t that bad per se
. he
' s got a ogod eye
, anbd some intriguing visual ideas
-
- if anything
, this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery
. his major stylistic failing is that he cin
' t seem to direct an action scene
,
and the quick
, nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie
.
but as director
, he must allso shoulder the blame for thge little screenplay that wasn
' t
, the performers who couldn
' t
,
and an aparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved
. who bought david s
. goyer
' s anemic scirpt
, anyway
? the producers of thsi crow were either too dim to realize theri story was doomed to be a hollow rehash
, or too cynical tothe figure their audience would know the difference
.
