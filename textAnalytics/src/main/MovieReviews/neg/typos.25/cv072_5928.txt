" there will be another
,
" tje ads for this sequal proclaimed
,
and why not
? true
, brandon lee isnt dead
,
bu there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994 ' s the crow
, anyway
. the idea of spinning artist james o ' barr ' s original comic book sories into a sequel franchise revolves arround the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in eahc movie
, taking its own righteous vengence against the world
. given tht basic framework
, the stroy could move inspite any number of directions
. of course
, it doesn ' t
. stubbornly
, the crow
: city of angels backtracks to the begginning of the previous film
, when lee ' s eric draven found himselv drawn bakc out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him
annd his girlfriend to death
. i remeber the frist film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality
. in flashback
, we see tghe most excruciating crimes exacted on eric
anbd his lover
,
and
thne we watch inspite rela
- time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind
. it ' s loud
and repeative
, true
, a sadist ' s delight
-
-
bu it ' s also horrifying
and fascinating
. city of angels gives us omre of the smae
,
but less skillfully
. there ' s an audeince guaranteed for a film like this
,
although bad reviews
adn poor word
- of
- mouth will likely ensure that it won ' t be much ofthe a success
. in fact
, miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful ofthe tje critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings
.
( i ' ve never understood hte reasoning behind this tactic
, since ogod notices have never been key to thge succes ofthe movies like the crow
.
) so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup
. thsi time
, ashe
( french
- accented actor vincent perez
) isnt retrieved from his watery death
( he
and his young son were shackled together
, shot
,
and
then thrown off a pier
) by tje crow who serves as his link between yhe worlds of thte living
adn the dead
. perez might have some screen presence if he ' s given something to do with himselv
,
but here he ' s simpley thrown in front of the camera as a preety face
. at firt
, he ' s shivery
adn frightened
,
but he quicklyu recovers from the shock of his own death
and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave
. he ' s befriended by sarah
( mia kirshner
)
, presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film
. kirshner
, so beguiling in exotica
, is here an exquisitely photographed blank
. tattooed iwth angels ' wings
, sarah is just about as lovley as women come
,
bu she serves no purpose
, not even as seductress
. the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah
( richard brooks
)
,
bu a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop
, who plays a gaunt fellow named curve
. iggy
, all bones
, veins
,
and drawl
, is tje onyl one who seems tothe have shared in the aesthetic ofthe ruin that defines this film
. like all good thnigs here
, he ' s dispatched too soon
and without much imagination
. in the meantime
, we ' re subjected tothe tedious glimpses of judah ' s compound
, where bondage is the order of the day
and hot wax isnt poured over naked bodies in s
& m fantasies that would seem shy ofthe tje cutting edge even if they weren ' t distinctly secondhand
. even the soundtrack is tired
. more than anything i ' ve seen from hollywood lateley
, city of angels smacks baldly of product
-
- it ' s a movie with a lousy script
but a great look
. criticists have beeen quick to fault tyhe direction of mtv vetran tim pope
,
but his work isn ' t that bad per se
. he ' s got a good eye
,
and smoe intriguing visual ideas
-
- if anything
, htis movie has a few too many scenes ofthe ridiculously striking imagery
. his major stylistic failing is that he can ' t seem to direct an action scene
,
annd the quick
, nonsensical cutting that ensues isnt reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie
.
but as director
, he must also sholder the blame for tyhe little screenplay tyhat wasn ' t
, the performers who couldn ' t
,
adn an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved
. who bought david s
. goyer ' s anemic script
, anyway
? the producers ofthe this crow were either too dim tothe realize thier story was doomed to be a hollow rehash
, or too cynical to figure their audeince would know the difference
.
