apparantly money talks
.
.
.
and uses quite a bit ofthe obscenities doing so
! i
' ve always considered myself preety oepn about the gratuity a film can possess
, whether in language
, violence
, sex
, or wqat have you
. i find that thsi fact gives me a little more leverage to complain wehn a movie goes overboard
,
and omney talks definetly doesnt
! it
' s not so much tht the movie sweared nearly constanly
(
and i mean constantly
!
)
,
but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent
and way too staged
. perhaps if noe character were foul mouthed
,
but in this film
, everybody swears nearly eveyr otehr owrd
. money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett
( played less annoyingly thna expeced by chris tucker
)
. franklin is your typical con
- man annd ends up with mroe tahn one person out to git him
. wehn the plot finally gets underway
, htere
' s no less than three people
( or groups
) that watn him
, dead or alive
. the frenchman who
' s somewhat responsible for franklin
' s escape from a prisoner
- packed bus
, a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven gr
and
,
and hte cops who wrongly suspect him of murder
. franklin
' s only hope
: james russell
( charlie sheen
)
, an investigative reporter for the local news who
' s out to prove himself a worthy journalist
. james offers to halp clear franklin
' s name if franklin iwll jstu allow him an exclusive report tothe help channel 12 conquer sweeps week
. both of theese elements are completely lost along the way
however
, annd never do reappear
. as expected
, yhe odd couple ofthe franklin
and james do wind up friends at thge end
, which is anyother wasted element seing as how they sohw no signs of becoming friends at any point along tghe way
. there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film
,
and so many developments are either non
- relevant
, or just plain forgotten about
. money talks is a paint
- by
- numbers movei that lacks any real involvment whith the audience
. frivilous dialogue
, a predicatble
, flat storyline
, adn two
- dimensional characters make money talks a reason tothe save your mnoey
