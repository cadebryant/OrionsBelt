as with any gen
- x mtv movei
( like last eyar
' s dead man on campus
)
, the movie is marketed for a primarily male audiance as indicated by its main selling points
: sex
and football
. those two items
, wrapped inaddition a gilty
- blessure package
, are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially
,
but sales iwll decline for twpo reasons
. first
, teh football sequences are nothing new
, nor can tehy be
; the sports genre isn
' t mainstream
and it
' s been retread tothe death
. second
, the sex is just bad
. despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or teh all
- night strip
- club party
, there
' s nothing even remotely tantalizing
. thge acting is mostly mediocre
, nto including the fantastic jon voight
. cultivating his usual sliminess
, voight gives an unexpectedly st
andout performence as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer
. kilmer is thte driving force behind the coyotes
' twenty
- two conference championships
and two state titles infact thirty years
; this year he plans to make it twenty
- threee
. unfortunatly
, when his star quaterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, goes down for the count
, he
' s got to rely onthe the unreliable abilities ofthe backup john moxon
( james van der beek
)
. moxon leads the team through its last four games
, adn
then must coppe with his newfound stardom
, the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie
( amy smart
)
,
and other temptations that abound in football
- crazy west canaan
. most regions of the country are not nearly as football
- crazy as texas
,
and so the atomsphere is likely to be lost on most
. similarly
, the set design isnt wrong for a high school setting
: the teams are decked outloud with sparkling uniforms
, radeo headsets
( which never seem to work
,
however
,
and instead require coachs to signal plays manually
)
, annd even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer
. theese elements
( as well as the heavy drinking
and carousing
) might be mroe appropriate onthe a college cumpus
-
-
but mtv
' s core audeince is the high school demographic
. this focus isnt furuther emphasized by the casting
: james van der beek
, ofthe tv
' s
" dawson
' s creek
,
" is an underst
andable choise for tyhe reluctant hero
,
al
though he never manages to do anytying with the role
. other stars are similiarly young
and unmemorable
. there
' s not much that goes right baout varsity blues
,
and there
' s not much tothe like about it
, either
. everthing herein has already been done
,
and if it hasn
' t
, tjhe movie manages to botch it one way or another
. tihs isnt certainly missable
.
