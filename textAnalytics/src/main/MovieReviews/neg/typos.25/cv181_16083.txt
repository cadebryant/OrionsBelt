as iwth any gen
- x mtv movie
( like last year ' s dead man on cumpus
)
, the movei is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points
: sex
and football
. thsoe two items
, wrapped in a guilty
- pleasure package
, are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially
,
bu sales wiull decline for two reasons
. first
, the football sequences are nothing new
, nor can htey be
; the sports genre isn ' t mainstream
and it ' s been retread to death
. second
, the sex is just bad
. despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all
- night strip
- club party
, there ' s nothing even remotely tantalizing
. tje acting is mostly medicore
, not incuding the fantastic jon voight
. cultivating his usual sliminess
, voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer
. kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes ' twenty
- two conferance championships
and two state titles infact thirty yeasr
; this yearm he plans to make it twenty
- three
. unforetunately
, whn his star quarterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, goes down for the count
, he ' s got to rely onthe tjhe unreliable abilties of backup john moxon
( james van der beek
)
. moxon leads the team thru its last four games
,
anbd
then must cope with his newfound stardom
, the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie
( amy smart
)
,
anbd other temptations that abound inspite fotball
- crazy west canaan
. most regions ofthe yhe country are not nearly as footblal
- crazy as texas
,
and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most
. similarly
, the set desgin is wrong fo a high skool setting
: the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms
, radio headsets
( which never seem tothe work
,
howver
,
and instade recquire coachs tothe signal plays manually
)
,
anbd even a giant bronze statue ofthe coach kilmer
. theese elements
( as well as the heavy drinking
and carousing
) might be more appropriate on a college campus
-
-
bu mtv ' s core audience isnt teh high school demographic
. this focus is further emphaised by the casting
: james van der beek
, of tv ' s
" dawson ' s creek
,
" is an understandable choice for tje reluctant hero
,
although he never manages to do anything with the role
. other stars are similarly young
and unmemorable
. there ' s not much thgat goes right about varsity blues
,
and htere ' s not much to like about it
, either
. everyting herein has already been done
,
and if it hasn ' t
, the movie manages tothe botch it oney way or anohter
. this is certainly missable
.
