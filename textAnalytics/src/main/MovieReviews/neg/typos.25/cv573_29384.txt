. review
: ther is noe reason why
" jurassic park iii
" is better tahn its immeiate predecessor
,
" the lost world
: jurassic park
"
. the latter wasted 129 mintues ofthe my life
; the former
, only 94
. the first
" park
" was a marvellous film
, full of awe
- inspiring sights
, interesting cahracters
, adn genuine thrills
. its two successors have been pale imitations
, amounting to hundred
- million
- dollar b
- grade horror movies
. at least this third entry realises it
; whereas
" the lost world
" tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous
and overextended plot
,
" jurassic park iii
" simply sticks its characters on an isl
and with a bunch ofthe rinosarus
and lets the mayhem beign
. there is a dsperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie
; the cmoputer
- animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting
, annd even the first
- tiem presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation
. remember tht wondrous first trolley ride thru the park in the orginal movie
? nothing in this rehash even comes close
. add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman
, payne adn taylor
,
and phoned
- in performances by the normally capable macy annd leoni
,
and it is difficult to reccomend the film to anyone
but dino enthusiasts
. at least neill mkaes soem effort tothe retain the dignity of his character
,
and htere is much less gore than infact
" the lost world
"
, making this installment more suitable for children
.
