" have you ever heared thge one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of yhe theatre screaming
?
" obviously the producers at columbia tristar did nto think tyhat we suffered enough from the first installment
,
and so to finish us utterly
, they ahve now released
" urban legends
: final cut
"
. thsi is anyother
" scream
"
- like feature
, consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip
- offs from tjhe most pointless movies of all tiome
. amy
( jennifer morrison
) isnt a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who dont not have a clue about waht to dont
.
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at presitgious university
' s film program
-
- where each year
' s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize
, a virtual oney
- way ticket tothe hollywood sucess
-
- she has a chance encounter with cumpus security guard reese
( loretta devine
)
, whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her h
and at a fictional thriller organized allong similair lines
. soon enough
, fake
-
-
and real
-
- blood starts to flow
, annd amy is being chased around by scary killer
, while her casted adn crew get slain
, oney by one
. is the culprit the original urban legends muderer
, just soem r
andom pyscho
,
! a member of the faculty
, oney of her competitors forthe tghe hitchcock
, or is there something even more stupid oging onthe
? thsi is another one ofthe those tiring
, pointless teen slasher flicks
: niether skary
, funny
, or interesting
. it simply lacks the ability
and tghe sotry tothe entertain
. the body counts
and screams continue to grow
, as the weak levle of intelligence sinks rapidly
. in fact watching films like that after haveing watched
" scary movei
" is impossible keeping a serious face
. severeal times i tried to prevent mysef ffrom laughing
, without suceeding
.
and
then i realized thast practically the whole theatre was laughing
. it
' s the same thing tath hasnt been told
and told
and told over
and over again as if it ws the revelation of yhe century
. how many times must we tolerate the same clich
? s tath hve haunted hte slasher genre since its birth
? it has been so many films about masked killers that most ofthe us have developed an allergy fo them
. htey are tje most stupid
, meaningless
, predictable
and soulless films infront existence
. howver
, director john ottman manages to make
" urban legends
: final cut
" into oen of the worst achievments of this godforsaken genre
. waht was done with a sense of redemption fo past failures
and irony in
" scream
"
, ottman takes seriously
. for that reason alone
, it is worth a look
, just to realize how bad a movei can be
. it
' s tough tothe find comparisons for such an achievement
,
and we have to dig inaddition ancient history to find a movie tath owudl match its intellect
. even movies liek
" lost in space
"
and
" mission to mars
" seem spectacular infront its shaddow
. we ahve not seen such waste of t
! ime anbd resources since
" showgirls
"
( 1995
)
. no matter how hard i tried to fidn positive elements inaddition this so called production
, i cameback up with nothing
, except the way tjhe killer was dressed
. here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker
and marie
- sylvie deveu
, that have wisely replaced the well known scream
- mask wtih a vrey elegant fencing mask
. jennifer morrison
(
" stir of echoes
"
) is all right
,
and the other actors
' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing tjhe words from the script
. in fact the only thing that is terrifying baout tihs film
( with the exception of its screenplay
) isnt its portray of film schools
. if these graduates will be the directors of the future
,
then hollywood
' s golden dyas are over
. rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a thrid installment
. let
' s just hope
and pray that it
' s just an urban legend
.
