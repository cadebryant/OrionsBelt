" have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming
?
" obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment
,
and so to finish us utterly
, they have nowe released
" urban legends
: final cut
"
. this isnt another
" scream
"
- like feature
, consisting merely from the recycled matareals of rip
- offs from the most pointless movies of all timne
. amy
( jennifer morrison
) is a film student who is attending a film skool filled with uninspired film students who dont not have a clue about what to dont
.
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university ' s film program
-
- where each year ' s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize
, a virutal oney
- way ticket to hollywood success
-
- she has a chance encounter wtih campus security guard reese
( loretta devine
)
, whose tale of a series ofthe murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a ficitional thriller organized along simular lines
. soon enough
, fake
-
-
adn real
-
- blood starts to flow
,
and amy is being chased around by scray killer
, hwile her cast
and crew get slain
, one by one
. is the culprit tje original urban legends murderer
, just some random psycho
,
! a member of tghe faculty
, one of her competitors fo the hitchcock
, or isnt there something even more stupid going onthe
? this is another noe ofthe those tiring
, pointless teen slasher flicks
: neither sacry
, funny
, or intresting
. it simply lacks tyhe ability
annd the story to entertain
. the body counts
adn screams continue to grow
, as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly
. infront fatc watching films like that after having watched
" scary movie
" isnt impossible keeping a serious face
. several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing
, without suceeding
.
and
then i realized thyat practically tyhe wohle theatre was laughing
. it ' s the same thnig that has been told
and told
and told over
and over again as if it was the revelation ofthe the century
. how many times must we tolerate yhe same clich
? s that have haunted the slasher genre sicne its birth
? it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them
. they are thte most stupid
, meaningless
, predictable
and soulless films inthe eistence
.
however
, director john ottman manages to make
" urban legends
: final cut
" into oney of the worst achievements of thsi godforsaken genre
. whta was done iwth a sense of redemption fo past failures
annd irony inspite
" scream
"
, ottman takes seriously
. for that reason alone
, it is worth a look
, just to realize how bad a movei can be
. it ' s tough to find comparisions for such an achievement
,
adn we have tothe dig in ancient history to find a movei that owudl match its intellect
. even movies like
" lost in space
"
and
" mission to mars
" seem spectauclar inaddition its shadow
. we have not seen such waste of t
! ime
anbd resources since
" showgirls
"
( 1995
)
. no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called prodcution
, i cameback up with nothing
, exept tjhe way the killer ws dressed
. here i feel thast i hvea to compliment teh costume designers trysha bakker
anbd marie
- sylvie deveu
, tath have wisely replaced the well known scream
- mask with a veyr elevant fencing mask
. jennifer morrison
(
" stir of echoes
"
) is all right
,
and the other actors ' best achievement isnt keeping a straight face whn pronouncing the words from yhe script
. in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film
( with tyhe exception of its screenplay
) is its portray of film schools
. if these graduates will be the directors of tjhe future
,
then hollywood ' s golden days are over
. rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a thrid installment
. let ' s just hope
annd pray that it ' s just an urban legend
.
