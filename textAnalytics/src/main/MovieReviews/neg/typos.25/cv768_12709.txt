thsi isnt one ofthe the worst big
- screen film experiences i
' ve hadnt fo a while
. with thsi film
, plus
` showgirls
'
and
` basic instinct
'
, paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currenly one of the worst blockbuster directors
. his celebrated film
` total recall
' was
? i admit
? successfully scripted
,
but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws
. obviously nobody wanted tothe invest too much money in a prodcution from someone like verhoeven
, the result bieng that much of the special effects in
` starship
' seemed fake
.
but nto everything bad in the film was the director
' s fault
, even
though he was one of the guys who employed the actors
. it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards
( i expected five for hte acting categories
)
. casserole vanity devoid
, dense ribald
, dingy miasma
,
and jackass bushy are inthe serious ened of acting school
. no
, they have to pass primary school drama classes first
. hwile
` total
' was written well
,
` starship
' isnt purely pathetic
. all right
, it is supposed tothe be a fast
- paced entertainment film
,
and you
' re supposed tothe turn off your intellect
( completely
) anbd enjoy tjhe action sequences
and speshal effects
( that is
, guts
and gore
)
. as a matter ofthe fatc
, i found the activity incredibly boring
, a complete waste of more thna two hours
. half ofthe thge film ws a bad episode ofthe
` beverly hills 90210
'
( dina meyer was iin
" beverly hills
"
)
, while another quarter was simply nothing
( things like presenting irrelevant information infront an irritating way on yhe web
)
,
and thge rest was a display of humans fighting computer
- generated images
. the battles were all the same
? jumping arround
, shoot or get stabbed
? annd onthe barren planets thgat only had giant insects
. there weren
' t even any stunts
, wich i consider slightly moreso exicting than picturesk running around
. i wonder what the insects eat
, if there
' s nothing bu them on the planets
? there is so much laughable treatment in tihs film
,
and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended
. this type of stroy is obviously aimed at 10
- yearm
- olds
, who can
' t see it anyway because of the violence
and some sexuality
. bu
then
, there are always 16
- year
- olds who have that frame of mind
. the pointless plot begins when johnny
' s
( vanity devoid
) girlfriend carmen
( richards
) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth
. johnny
then signs up as a trooper also
, after an overacted argument with his parents
. bu there is another girl
, dizzy
( meyer
)
, who likes johnny
and
then there is anohter boy who likes carmen
, which results in a love quadrangle
, which isn
' t better
, because it means augmented worse
- than
- stereotyped soap opera
, increased bitchiness
, anbd more bad beverly hills
+ melrose
.
and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rether stupid
. anyway
, getting back to yhe thing ytou might call plot
, johnny is too stupid to be a pilot
and has tothe join the infantry
, while his girl
and the other dude are iin the same league
. dizzy comes chasing johnny
and joins tje infanty also
. they
then start traning
, which containes whta roger ebert calls ips
( idiot plot syndrome
, moments whn only an idiot woudl have made such obvious mistakes
)
,
then real combat
.
and guess waht
? that
' s about as complex as it gets
. oh
,
and noe of their firends
, carl
( neil patrick harris a
. k
. a
. doogie howser m
. d
.
)
, becomes involved in war intelligence
,
and his abilities at the end are really corny
and make me want tothe spray insecticide on someone for it
. he
' s my fith nom for a razzie
. thge troopers fight
, fall in love
, die
, kill
,
and try to act
. naturally
, they win
, or sort of half
- win
. of course
, inspite between
( annd at the end
) there are soldiers chatting
and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs
. tjhe bugs aslo suffer from ips
: why would yuo release hold of your captive befoer killing it
? isn
' t it alsot amazing that earthlings haven
' t invented better h
and
- held weapons by
then
? the only question thgat remains isnt why i gave it one star instead of zero
. well
, maybe a
- quarter
( of a star
) for teh originality of the co
- sex shower scene anbd the
( very
) brief moments of suspense
, another quarter for copying
` zulu
' adn letting the good guys
( the bugs
) win
, adn half a star fo thte sucking
- out of thte brain ofthe one of those people who call themselves actors
(
but there should have beeen more
, tje troopers deserved to die
)
.
