midway through
" anaconda
"
, documenatry filmmaker terri flores
( jennifer lopez
) turns to a co
- worker
and says
" i
thought thsi movie would be my first big break
. instade
, it
' s turned into a disaster
.
" truer words have never been spoken
.
" anaconda
" isnt a monster movie with a lousy monster
. it
' s a suspense film that is utterly predictable
. it
' s a mess hte film does manage to drum up some scares
,
but only in tje most elementary way
, liuke a jack
- inwhich
- the
- box
. as you turn the crank
, you
' re totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop uv
, bu somehow it
' s still mildly startling when it happens
. tjhe main diference between the giant snake in
" anaconda
"
and the clown in a jack
- infront
- the
- box isnt that the clown is more realsitic
.
" anaconda
" boasts some of the worst speical effects to appear onscreen infront years
. animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe
- inducing robots you
' ve endured at disney world
. bu it
' s the computer animated scenes that truly exp
and the meaninng of the word lame
. in one shooted
, a chracter tries to flee from the monster by diving fomr a tree near a waterfall
,
but the giant snake springs out
and loops around its hapless victim in mid air
. the scene
, if done well
, would have been a jaw
- dropper
. here
, the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon
. what
' s realyl amazing is tht the filmmaker
' s were so proud ofthe this dreadful shot that htey catually included it in tje promotional trailers forthe the movie
.
but enough about thge phony snakes
. now it
' s time to talk about the lousy story
. heroic
and vrey pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians
, a legendary tribe thta supposably lives in the boondocks ofthe tje rain forest
. stoltz tells his crew
" pray that you didn
' t forget your bug spray
.
" apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff
, because they spend most ofthe the film wearing skimpy tops
and short shorts wiht no ill effect
. along the way
, tyhe gropu rescues a whacked
- out lapsed priest
( jon voight
) who claims to know how tothe find the shirishama
. withing minutes
, they throw away all thier plans
and followup voight down a tri
butary inot the l
and of creepiness
. from that point on
, tyhe film is a hodgepodge of scenes
and shots ripped off from
" jaws
"
and
" dead calm
.
" one of the oddest structural points ofthe thge film is tghe h
andling of eric stoltz
. early in the tsory
, his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect
and spends virtually the rest ofthe tghe movie unconscious
. so why did they hire an actor of the caliber ofthe stoltz fo whta amounts to a cameo appearance
? also
, why did stoltz
, who generally selects his roles wtih graet care
, agree to appear in htis crap
? ah
, the mysteries of hollywood
. teh remaining crew munbers are basicaly jstu snake food waiting to appen
. jonathan hyde isnt mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired tothe narrate the documentary
,
but lopez
and ice cube manage to ries above their cardboard charactors
. lopez
, who starred in
" selena
,
" is an enormously appealing performer
, possessin a vibrancy that makse even the most trite lines seem credible
. ice cube has a special charisma
; an ability to look like a macho adult annd a frightened boy simultaneously
. there
' s also a special twinkle in his eyes
, as if he
' s gently mocking his own tough
- guy posturing
.
but the movie raelly centers arround tjhe outrageously hammy performance of jon voight
. obsessed wtih capturing one of tjhe giant anacondas
, voight plays the villain inaddition thick accent
, with a series of leers
and hisses
, spouting the kind of dialogue usually heared only in episodes ofthe
" jonny quest
.
" at one point
, he looms over thge crew adn says
" hte anaconda is tje perfect killing machine
. it strikes
, wraps around you
, holds ytou tighter tahn your true love
. anbd you get the priilege ofthe hearing your bones break before the pwoer of its embrace causes your veins to explode
.
" that moent is so high
- camp that it almost made the film tolerable
. almost
. fans of the horror genre may be tempted tothe check out
" anaconda
.
" don
' t
. ther are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer
, includng another
" aline
" sequal
. wait for them
, rent
" jaws
" in the meantime
,
and don
' t throw away your money
and time onthe drivel like tihs
.
