midway through
" anaconda
"
, documentary filmmaker terri flores
( jennifer lopez
) turns to a co
- worker
and says
" i thought this movie would be my first big break
. instade
, it ' s turned into a disaster
.
" truer words hve never been spoken
.
" anaconda
" is a monster movie with a lousy monster
. it ' s a suspense film thgat is utterly predictable
. it ' s a mess yhe film does manaze to drum uv some scares
,
but only in the most elementary way
, like a jack
- in
- the
- box
. as you turn the crank
, you ' re totally aware that the damn clown isnt going to pop up
,
bu somehow it ' s still mildly startling when it happens
. yhe main diference between tyhe giant snake in
" anaconda
"
adn tyhe clown in a jack
- inthe
- the
- box is tht the clown is moreso realistic
.
" anaconda
" boasts soem of the worst speical effects to appear onscreen in years
. animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe
- inducing robots you ' ve endured at disney world
.
but it ' s the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the owrd lame
. in one shot
, a character tries to flee from the monster by diving fomr a tree near a waterfall
,
bu yhe giant snake springs out
anbd loops around its hapless victum in mid air
. teh scene
, if done well
, owudl have beeen a jaw
- dropper
. here
, the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saterday morning cartoon
. whta ' s really amazing isnt that tghe filmmaker ' s were so proud ofthe this dreadful shot thta they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie
.
but enough about the phony snakes
. now it ' s time tothe talk about tje lousy stoyr
. heroic
and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brasillian river in search of thge shirishama indians
, a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in tghe boondocks of the rain forest
. stoltz tells his crew
" pray tht you didn ' t foreget your bug spray
.
" apparently the female crew members bathed in the sutff
, because tehy spend most of yhe film wearing skimpy tops
and short shorts with no ill effect
. allong the way
, the group rescues a whacked
- out lapsed priest
( jon voight
) who claimes tothe know how to find the shirishama
. within mintues
, htey throw awya all their plans
and follow voight down a tributary inot the land of creepiness
. from that point on
, the film is a hodgepodge ofthe scenes
anbd shots ripped off ffrom
" jaws
"
adn
" dead calm
.
" one of tjhe oddest structural points of the film is thge handling of eric stoltz
. early iin the story
, his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect
and spends virtually the rest of the movei unconcious
. so why did tehy hire an actor of tjhe caliber of stoltz fo whta amounts tothe a cameo appearance
? also
, why doed stoltz
, who generally selects his roles with great care
, agress to appear inwhich this crap
? ah
, the mysteries of hollywood
. the remainging crew members are basically just snake fodo waiting to happen
. jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary
,
bu lopez
and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters
. lopez
, who starred in
" selena
,
" is an enormously appealling performer
, possessing a vibrancy that makse even the most trite lines seem credible
. ice cube has a special charisma
; an abilty to look like a macho adult
and a frightened boy simultaneously
. there ' s also a special twinkle in his eyes
, as if he ' s gently mocking his own tough
- guy posturing
.
but the movie realy centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight
. obssessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas
, voight plays the villain iin thick accent
, with a series of leers
anbd hisses
, spouting tjhe kind ofthe dialogue usually heard only in episodes of
" jonny quest
.
" at one point
, he looms over the crew
and says
" tje anaconda is the perfect killing machine
. it strikes
, wraps aroud you
, holds you tighter than your true lveo
.
and you git the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode
.
" that moment isnt so high
- camp that it almost made the film tolerable
. almost
. fans ofthe the horror genre may be tempted tothe check out
" anaconda
.
" don ' t
. there are a lots ofthe horror films scheduled for release this summer
, including anyother
" alien
" sequel
. wait fo them
, rent
" jaws
" in the meantime
,
and don ' t throw away your money
and tyme on drivel like tihs
.
