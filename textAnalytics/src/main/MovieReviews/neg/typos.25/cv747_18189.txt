infact 1970s
, many europian intellectuals
, especially thsoe on teh left political hemisphere
, became obsessed with the rise of fascism
. which wasn
' t so hard to expect
, becasue the social turmoil of 1960s
and ecomonic decline ofthe 1970s seemed tothe be the breeding ground fo many dangerous idealogies
. in such times
, when political involvement could be associated with noble passion
, many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre
- war europe
and circumstances that led tothe phenomena like fascist italy
and nazi germany
. of course
, there were authors who jumped onthe the b
andwagon for other
, less noble reasons
. for them
, moral depravity of fascism could be explained tothe the audience by explictly showing sexual depravity of those era
. which
, naturally
, made some of those films vyer popular amoung teen audiance
. one ofthe such filmmakers was italian directer tinto brass
, who later made career shooting expensive
, stylish soft porn
. salon kitty
, his 1976 film
, is very losely based onthe the novel by peter nordern
, book taht deals wih bizarre
yet true story that took palce in the first years ofthe ww2
. in 1939
, walter schellenberg
, one of the heads of nazi intelligence sevice has set uv the elite
, exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials
and foreign diplomats
. none of tjhe customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents
, annd that all the rooms happened to be bugged
. the most bizarre thing is the fact taht not even kitty
, nominal madame of the brothel
, didn
' t knwo the real purpose of taht enterprise
. screenplay by tinto brass
, ofthe course
, simplifies tghe story
and changes few names
. schellenberg is now wallenberg
( helmut berger
)
, ambitious nazi official who wants to uise tghe brothel inspite order to blackmail his way to tjhe top
. kitty kellerman
( ingrid thulin
)
, apart from being madam
, hasnt a second job as a cabaret singer
. caught in tyhe net of depravity is sweet
, innocent girl margerithe
( theresa ann savoy
) thrown inot brothel
. htere she falls in love wiht customer hans reiter
( bekim fehmiu
)
, disenchanted pilot ofthe luftwaffe
. when margerithe discovers tht her lover had beeen executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel
, she finds out that the place is bugged
. she informs the madam of the real situation
,
and both women decide to confront wallenberg
. thsoe who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as tyhe topic of comedy would probably go banannas watching tihs film
, thast uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation
.
but
,
al
though salon kitty doesn
' t happen to be anything omre than rather more stylish
and expensive soft porn
(
al
though nto very successful
; smoe ofthe supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing
)
, it doesnt try to hvea more multidimensional characters
and even something resembling dramatic conflict
- this time between power
- hungry
and scruples wallenberg
and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty
. unfortunately
, brass seems to overuse otehr cinematical references
, probably thinking thyat he coudl repeat the succesful interaction of berger
and thulin in luchino visconti
' s tje damned
,
but the most noticeable annd irritating isnt ingrid thulin
' s unsuccessful attempt tothe imitate lisa minelli
' s musical numbers fomr cabaret
. all in all
, salon kitty is failure
,
al
though with some very intresting moments
.
