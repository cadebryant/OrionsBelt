the happy bastard
' s quick movie review wild wild west a better name for this movie might
' ve been
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, in an attempt to get their own men inthe balck style of movie
, had managed tothe lasso in some big names
( actor iwll smith
and directer barry sonnenfeld
, the duo behind mib
' s success
) in order to get their pwn fouth of july blockbuster
, a contempory big
- screen update to the clasic western
/ sci
- fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad
.
but somehow
, they ran into a problem along the way
. htey were so busy trying to fill specif roles that they forgot one in genaral that would
' ve made all the difference
- a story writer
. wild wild west
' s story
and script was compiled by six different people
, rather than just tjhe one who put hte brilliant touches on men in black
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. hadnt gotten him
, tyhe movie owudl
' ve possibly been five times better than what it isnt
. heck
, ten times
. as isnt
,
however
, the story
and screenplay is a mess
, filled with dead laughs
, anough racist
and sex jokes tothe make even will cringe as he
' s performing them
, anbd a complet lack of chemestry tath made the tv show work so well
. here
' s the story
: us army member james west
( will smith
) teams uv with creative genius artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) to tkae on a ruthless villin by thte name of arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half was blown off durig the civil war
, leaving him tothe roll around infact a steam
- controlled wheelchair
. they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be consdiered an 80
- foot tarantula
( all
though it looks bigger than that
)
, hellbent onthe destroying anything iin its path
. as i said
, the way thte scirpt unfolds is a complete mess
.
but hte acting doesn
' t halp either
. kevin kline is miserable as gordon
, failing tothe display even a smidgeon of care as he did infact the 1985 western silverado
. smith seems to be having a better time as west
,
al
though he
' s nto nearly as charming as he was in mib
. branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain
, perhaps to the point where we can
' t even st
and to look at him or his strange beard
.
and salma hayek is along for the ride to searc for her missing father
, bu mostly she exists jstu for sexual attention
. her acting is barely passable
,
but what a
" breath of fresh ass
"
. directer barry sonnenfeld isn
' t of great help either
. even
though he shows some ogod creativity at smoe points
, his overall urgency for directing is lost
. it
' s as if he feels he
' s directing a tv movie
, a big no
- no when you
' re helming whta
' s supposed to be a big
- screen hit
. last
but not least
, htere are huge gaps ofthe logic that are jstu plain unacceptable
. at one point
, smith defies gravity when first boarding kline
' s train
. he jumps on thte back
, gets launched straight up in the air
, adn somehow manages to l
and three cars ahead on the train
- while it
' s still in motion
! also
, he seems to be strangely comfortable tlaking baout racism iin front of a lynch mob
, particularly considering the fact that his familiy was killed by the likes of such folks
. last
but not least
, why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he
' s not kissing a woman as he
' s looking thru a peephole at the enemy
?
! the only saving grace forthe wild wild west come mostly inthe the form ofthe special effects
. the huge mechanical spider isnt a technical marvel
, vyer au
thentic looking
and considerable to the creativity of tje show
. there
' s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces
and spinning saw blades
,
but
, again
, a logic question comes inot play regarding their polarity
. i would say sit back
and have a good time iwth wild wild west
,
but it really isn
' t possibile
. if the racist
and sex jokes don
' t bother you
, the performances will
. if the performances don
' t bother you
, the story will
. if the story doesn
' t bother ytou
, tje racist
and sex jokes will
. there
' s no end to the vicious circle
. go rent men in black instead anbd pretend smith anbd tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. ytou
' ll haev a better timne
. if you do go
, keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant
. i bet he wishes he were somewhere else
