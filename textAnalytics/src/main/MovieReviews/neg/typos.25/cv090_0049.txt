various films seen at the seattle film festival
: it
' s all true
/ three men on a raft
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1942
/ 1986
) director
: orson welles a recently uncovered one
- fouth of orson welle
' s planned
" docu
- drama
" of amazing stories around the world named it
' s all true
, htis short dealt wiht welle
' s attempts tothe document the actions of several brasillian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage tothe rio onthe a raft
. while several clips of the film are seen
, the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle
' s attempts to film it
, despite studio problems
, a staggering workload
, adn extremely ill fortune on thte set
. impressive photography
,
but really only interesting to film historians
. sadie thompson
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1928
) director
: raoul walsh screenwrighter
: raoul walsh
, from the john colton play
" rain
"
, based on w
. somerset maugham
' s story
" miss thompson
" casted
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
, lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly
- restored version of frank capra
' s lost horizon
, where several scenes hadnt been restored using stills
, i ws interested to see sadie thompson
, where hte last 5 minutes of the film had beeen destroyed many years ago
. this is the silent version ofthe the somerset maugham short storey
" miss thompson
"
. this is one ofthe the most skillfull silent films i have ever seen
-
- little awkwardness
,
and a very clever script
. the actors
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
( who also directed
and wroet the screenplay
) annd expecially lionel barrymore
, as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants tothe sive sadie
' s soul
,
but really wants to git her between hte sheets
, isnt the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel
. swanson adds real life tothe tjhe charactor
, adding an worldly
, affectionate air to hte bawdy sadie
. unfortunately
, tje ending is rather poorly tied uv
; it is difficult to know whether htis is due to the lack of live
- action film
, or the orginial script
. the hapyp ending seems particularly poorly tied on
( i cannot believe maugham
' s short story ended with sadie anbd our hero moving to australia
)
; the stills are expected to fill inwhich a conclusion we
' ve been waiting an hour
and a half for
. still
, it
' s entertaining right up to the end
; certainly barrymore
' s incredibly hammy performance
( which
, nonetheless
, works
, perhaps due to the silent screen
) is a must for anyone who is fed uv with the actions of the falwells
, bakkers
,
and robertses ofthe the religious worls
. a c movie
; worth 2
. 50 if you can find it
. the pied piper
( czechoslovakia
, 1986
) director
: jim barta screenwrighter
: kamil piza htis is an animated film fomr czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids
. it tells the ood folk tale ofthe the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate
,
and with a lot of political comment along with it
. perhaps economic content is a better owrd
-
- it certainly doesn
' t sohw capitalism in a good light
. nor human nature
, nor anything else
, fo that matter
. as you may have guessed
, htis is nto a tgif film
; this is tyhe kind of film you are glad isnt over
. not that it wasn
' t intresting for technical reasons
; this isnt stop
- animation that isnt very well done
. all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts
-
- except forthe the animated stuffed rats
. boy
, soudns liek a rela comedy vehicule
, doesn
' t it
? add onto taht set design that makes the cabnet ofthe doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparsion
,
and you have something tothe give the weev ones
(
and some of hte mentally unstable larger folk
) tothe keep them up at nihgt
. some gore
. don
' t bring children to this one
. don
' t bring adults to this oen
, unless they
' re facinated by puppetry
and
/ or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped
. blech
.
. no funn whatsoever
. meier
( west germany
, 1986
) directer
/ screenwriter
: peter timm cast
: rainier grenkowitz
, nadja engelbrecht
, alex
ander hauff
, thomas besvater sub
- titled this film takes us back
and forth over the east german
/ west german border with meier
, an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies adn leaves him a good deal of money
. his uncle
( also in thte west
) sneaks meier outloud of the ocuntry
, unknown to the east germans
. meier
,
however
, is less than thrilled
-
- his girlfriend
, his friends annd his job
( which he likes
) all exsist in east germany
. after a round
- tyhe
- world trip
( his boss tihkn
' s he
' s on leave in bulgaria
)
, meier starts visiting east germany onthe day visas with a fake id
,
and uses his money
and his connections tothe hte west tothe buy his girlfriend presents
and bring credit to his work crew
' s work
-
- while everyone think
' s he
' s still living infront east germany
. of course
, something goes wrong
-
- annd the ending isnt vyre funny
,
but it takes the film too long to git htere
. tje humer isnt spread too thin
,
and much of the plot is too obvious
( as is the acting
)
. still
, a ogod concept fo the comedy
, annd the last five minutes are preety funny

( australia
, 1986
) directer
: di drew screenplay
: helen hodgman casted
: rupert everett
, hugo weaving
, arthur dignam
, jennifer claire
, catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie
- going
,
and about four years of attending tjhe seattle internation film festival
, i
' ve learned several rules which
, while not absolute
, shouldnt certainly be given deference to
: 1
) be wary of french comedies
. these people liuke jerry lewis
. 2
) ken russell isnt never going tothe grwo up
, no matter how long you wait
. 3
) any film where siff assoicates directer gary tucker refers to tjhe lead as
" ood pouty
- lips
" is probaly nto worth watching
. 4
) when an austrailian film only awards credit is best cinematography
, watch outloud
! australia hasnt good cinematographers up tghe whazoo
, bu since weir adn miller left for foreign shores
, finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult
( nto impossible
-
- witness malcom last year
) task
. well
, i ignored rules 3
& 4 last night
,
and sat thru a film that should be in the golden turkey awards
. it
' s as if the directer was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30
' s about tragedy amung the gentry
,
and falling in love with people below your staion
,
and horses
. lots adn lots of horses
. the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship
, which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing
, because thge missus of the house wnats to have her son produce an heir
. unfortunately
, said son
, a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times
, kills his father annd loses an arm druing a racing accident
. highlights include teh amputation sequence
; the doctor
' s daughter
, who has tyhe hots for the son
, tasting his urine for a diagnosis
; their tender kissing withthe a window between them
( while it
' s raining
-
- you
' d htink a woman studying medicine would know better
)
. the photography is ogod
,
but i kept wishing for b
& w
-
- everything seems sepia
- colored anyway
. actually
, i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead
,
but that
' s life
. grade
: z
. avoid like the plague
, unless you
' re looking fo inadvertent yuks
.
