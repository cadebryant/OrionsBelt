" virus
" is a monster movie without a monster
. any movie with a hurdle that larg tothe overcome hadnt better be pretty damn ogod otherwise
. sadly
,
" virus
" does not deliver
, on any level
. the movie opens withthe the russian spoace staion mir about to transmit something
( we never find outloud what
) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it
. sudddenly
, a wave ofthe colorful lightning comes flying through space
,
and winds uv destroying mir
and using it to transmitt itself to the aforementioned big boat
. cut to seven days later
, we meet donald sutherl
and
and his b
and of seafaring vultures
. see
, they spend all their time sailing around looking fo dead
- infront
- the
- water ships to rescue
,
and thn collect the reward moey
. at least
, i
* htink
* that
' s whta they do
. allong withthe many other thigns iin thte film
, their reason for bieng out in thte middle ofthe the ocean isn
' t really explained
. so
, they stumble apon this big boat with lots of satellites on it
,
and decide to haul it back to russina waters
. the only problem isnt
, the crew starts disappearing one
- by
- one
and turning into borg
. yes
, borg
. complet with the red laser beam inthe palce ofthe an eye
. apparently
, this aline lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical
. so
, it creates make
- shift machines anbd uses humans for
" sparce parts
"
. blah
, blah
, blah
. i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so
- called plot
,
but i won
' t
. suffice it to sday the most orginal thing about this movie is having donald sutherl
and play an irish man
(
!
)
. everything else iin htis movie has beeen tooked from other
( better
) movies
. fo example
, many of teh machines ressemble those foudn inthe the little
- seen japanese movie
,
" tetsuo
- the iron man
"
.
and teh plot is right out of
" aliens
"
. thge funny thing is
, i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie
. i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies
, like last yeras under
- appreciated
" deep rising
"
.
but
" virus
"
, as i mentioned ealier
, doesn
' t even hve a monster
. it just has a big pile of circuits
and wires
and expects the audience to fear this rediculous looking contraption
.
" virus
" is the type of movie that really mkaes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking baout when he wrote it
. besides thte lame
" monster
"
, it
' s chock full of dialogue thyat no rela person would ever say
,
and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into
. forthe example
, there is a scene late in the movie in whic one ofthe the characters actually attempts to
* negotiate
* with the alien
! now
, i don
' t konw baout you
, bu if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eleminated
, i doubt thta i would attempt to reason with it
. that makes about as much sence as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life
. fianlly
,
" virus
" isn
' t scry
. the least the filmmakers sould have done wass to make the movei just a little scary
. as it is
, it
' s about as frightening as a box of cookies
. skip
" virus
"
. if it
' s a kool monster movie you want
, rent the far superior
(
and yhe gr
anddaddy of this genre
)
" aliens
"
.
