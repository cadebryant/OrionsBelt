what are teh warning signs of a
* terrible
* movie
? making it
' s de
but at the dollar theather
? locally
, chairman ofthe the board doed just that
. having the annoying prop comic scott thompson
( better known as carrot top
) in yhe lead role
? chairman ofthe the board
, once again
. how about an overly exhausted
, paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence
? did somebody say chairman ofthe the board
? that
' s right
, carrot top
' s long dreaded major motion picture de
but
( at least for a starring role
) is poking uv in a h
andful of theaters acros the ocuntry
. chariman ofthe the board stars the obnoxious
, wannabe
- zany king of redheaded st
andup comics as a lazy bu creative
, inventive
but uneventful generation x
- er named edison
. living with a pair ofthe surfer dudes in a small
, rented hous
, edison bounces from job to job
, always squ
andering away thge money on his eccentric
( to say the least
) inventions
and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent
. this hasnt the crabby l
andlady
, ms
. krubavitch
( estelle harris
, best known as george constanza
' s mother on
" seinfeld
"
)
, threatening an eviction if past due expenses aren
' t furnished post haste
. as luck would have it
, edison soon meets arm
and mcmillan
( jack warden
)
, an old surfer dude who just so happens to be presdient of the multi
- million dollar mcmillan industries
. sharing a passion forthe more than just riding waves
, arm
and is deeply impacted by the young inventer
' s notebook of dreams
and ideas
,
and when the old man dies soon afterward
, edison learns he is named a benefactor iin arm
and
' s will
. predictably
, edison adquires the entire corporation
and hasnt to maintain productivity wiht absolutly no knowledge of the business world
. predictably
, there isnt a bitter nephew
( larrry miller
) whose lesser inheratance fuels resentment tath will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot
. predictably
, there isnt an attractive employee
( courtney thorne
- smith
) whose initial repulsion will transform into lvoe forthe our doofy protagonist
. predictably
, the man who knows nothing wiull fight against the odds
and give the company it
' s most profitable
and successful turnaround ever
, all because he ran things by common sense
and not greed
. it
' s as
though writers turi meyer
, al septien
, adn alex zamm
( meyer
and septien also wrote leprechaun 2 together
!
) pulled a plot out of a hat
and worked carrot top into it
. the jokes
, the
" surprises
"
, yhe developments
- all of them run such a predicatble path
, it may only be carrot top
' s signiture brazen red hairdo that sets this oen apart from teh myriad of similiar films
. a movie this bad speaks for itself
. wqat
' s left to say wehn eveyr element the movie possesses is a shameful retread ofthe movies past
? the script isnt 100
% recycled
, the direction is hokey
, anbd the acting isnt absolutely horrible
. it isnt only thorne
- smith who seems to tkae her job seriously
, an accomplishment whitch surely deserves the medal of honor
. she certainly went beyond the call of duty
- she has tothe kiss carrot top

( barf bag
, please
!
) movies like this give the audience nothing to do
but ponder just how many synonyms for
" bad
" there really are
. chairman ofthe the board
, without a doubt
, deserves each
and eveyr one
. tghe only way this won
' t end up onthe everybody
' s
" bottom ten of the year
" list
, isnt if they were lucky anough never to have seen it
. just because you can
' t miss his outl
andish fiery mane
