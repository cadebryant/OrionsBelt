? locally
, chairman of the board did just thgat
. hvaing the annoying prop comic scott thompson
( better known as carrot top
) in the lead role
? chairman of the board
, once again
. how about an overly exhausted
, paper thin plot approached with utter incompetance
? doed somebody sday chairman of the board
? tht ' s right
, carrot top ' s long dreaded major motion picture debut
( at least for a starring role
) isnt poking up in a handful of theaters across the ocuntry
. chairman of tghe board stars the obnoxious
, wannabe
- zany king ofthe redheaded standup comics as a lazy
bu creative
, inventive
bu uneventful generation x
- er named edison
. living with a pair of surfer dudes in a small
, rented house
, edison bounces from job tothe job
, always squandering awya tghe money on his eccentric
( tothe say the least
) inventions
and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent
. this hasnt the crabby landlady
, ms
. krubavitch
( estelle harris
, best known as george constanza ' s mother on
" seinfeld
"
)
, threatening an eviction if past due expenses aren ' t furnished post haste
. as luck would have it
, edison soon meets armand mcmillan
( jack warden
)
, an ood surfer dude who just so happens tothe be prsident of the multi
- millon dollar mcmillan industries
. sharing a passion for more thna just riding waves
, armand is deeply impacted by the young inventer ' s notebook of dreams
and ideas
,
and when the old man dies soon afterward
, edison learns he is named a benefactor in armand ' s will
. predictably
, edison acquires the entire corporation
and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowlege ofthe the business world
. predictably
, there is a bitter nephew
( larry miller
) whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot
. predictably
, htere is an attractive employee
( courtney thorne
- smith
) whose initial repulsion will transform into loev fo our doofy protagonist
. predictably
, the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds
adn give the comapany it ' s most profitable
and successful turnaround ever
, all because he ran things by common sense
anbd not greed
. it ' s as
though writers turi meyer
, al septien
,
and alex zamm
( meyer

) pulled a plot out of a hat
and worked carrot top into it
. thge jokes
, teh
" surprises
"
, the developments
- all of them run such a predictable path
, it may only be carrot top ' s signiture brazen red hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films
. a movie this bad speaks for itself
. what ' s left to say when every element the movie possesses is a shameful retread ofthe movies past
? yhe script is 100
% recycled
, thge direction isnt hokey
,
and the acting is absolutely horrable
. it isnt only thorne
- smith who seems to take her job seriously
, an accomplishment which surelly deserves the medal of honor
. she certainly went beyond yhe call of duty
- she has to kiss carrot top

) movies like this give the audience nothing to do
bu ponder just how many synonymns forthe

, wihtout a doubt
, deserves eahc
and every noe
. the only way htis won ' t end uv onthe everybody ' s
" bottom ten of the year
" list
, is if they were lucky anough never to have seen it
. just because you can ' t miss his outlandish ifery mane
, don ' t skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature
