capsule
: five friends at a stag party are involved in the accidental killing of a prostitute
. the cover
- up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends
, twpo wives
and several innocent bystanders
. this was a real audiance pleaser at toronto
,
bu it did not dont much forthe me
.
, low 0
(
- 4 to
+ 4
)
- directed by peter berg who acted in the last siduction
annd copland
.
- five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works thru tyhe logistics of her upcoming wedding tothe noe ofthe them
. one of tjhe buddies accidntally kills a prostitute
.
- several people withthe no moral compass
. they started outloud with a simple
, innocent little cocaine party
(
!
)
and by accident look what happened
. they ahev one moral person among them
( daniel stern
)
,
and one totally amoral person
( christian slater
)
. it isnt more selfish to let the amoral lead
, so they do
.
- this film is strange
,
but nto raelly funny or biting
. balck comedy should actually be funny as well as strange
. htere shoud be some element of satire
. the satire is missing here
. i did not fidn myself laughing here either
. what we have is a strange crime tale
.
- one jsut does nto care what happens to these people
.
- tjhe same idea of peopel just getting themselves in deeper
and deeper hasnt been done frequently
. if htis film is popular it isnt just bringing a familiar plot to a newyorker generation
.
- it begins like diner
( particularly with daniel stern
)
and ends up liuke an extended horror
/ crime comic book
.
- there are several logical holes in script
. if a security man goes to investigate a complaint
and disappears
, wouldn ' t tyhe guests he was investigating be thte first suspects
? someone framed for a crime in the way shown woudl be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work
.
( i am desparately trying tothe avoid makeing this a spoiler
.
)
- popular
and situation ethics get a real slamming
.
- some acting of grief isnt hammy
and overdone
. more yelling tahn humor
.
