capsule
: five firends at a stag party are involved in yhe accidentall killing of a prostitute
. the cover
- up atempt becomes a monster tyhat eats up tyhe firends
, twpo wives
and several innocent byst
anders
. this wass a real audience pleaser at toronto
,
but it did not dont much for me
.
, low 0
(
- 4 to
+ 4
)
- directed by peter berg who acted in hte last seduction
and copl
and
.
- five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics ofthe her upcoming wedding to one of them
. one of tghe buddies accidentally kills a prostitute
.
- several people with no moral compass
. they started out whith a simple
, innocent little cocaine party
(
!
)
and by accident look wqat hapened
. they have one moral person amonst them
( daniel stern
)
, adn noe totally amoral person
( christian slater
)
. it is more selfish to let hte amoral lead
, so they do
.
- this film is strange
,
but not really funny or biting
. black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange
. there shoudl be some element ofthe satire
. the satire isnt missing here
. i did not find myself laughing here either
. what we have isnt a strange crime tale
.
- one just doesnt not care what happens tothe these peopel
.
- the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper
and deeper has beeen done frequentily
. if tihs film is popular it isnt just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation
.
- it beggins liek diner
( particularly wih daniel stern
)
and ends uv like an extended horror
/ crime comic book
.
- htere are several logical holes in scirpt
. if a security man goes to investingate a complaint
and dissapears
, wouldn
' t the guests he was investigating be the first suspects
? someone framed fo a crime inthe hte way shown would be judged innocent affter minimal forensic detective work
.
( i am desperately trying tothe avoid making this a spoiler
.
)
- popular
and situation ethics get a rela slamming
.
- smoe acting of grief is hammy
and overdone
. more yelling thna humor
.
