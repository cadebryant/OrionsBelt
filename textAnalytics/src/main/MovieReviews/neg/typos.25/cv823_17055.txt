; ricky paull goldin
; kevin dillon
& billy beck the blob isnt teh remake of teh 1960
' s classic
( a term that i uise veyr loosely to define the orginial
) baout a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets inaddition its way
. now the original version has the virtue ofthe cheesy special effects whlch give it a kind ofthe nostalgic campy feel
. the fact that steve mcqueen was yhe star of the film doesn
' t exactly hurt it either
. fast foward to the late
' 80
' s
. steve mcqueen isn
' t in the remake
( this might have something to dont with the fact that he hadnt been pushing up daisies for years
)
. nor isnt there any hollywood heavy hitters inwhich the lead role
. that is unless you count matt dillon
' s brother kevin as a hollywood hevy hitter
. tghe otehr thing that works agaisnt this new blob is taht special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original
. yhe only things you ened now tothe have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets
. it looks as if the produces of the newyorker blob hadnt a couple of holes in their pockets
. the special effects in this movei are cheesy
, liek the original
' s
. unlike the origional
, they don
' t look campy
, they just look cheap
. noe bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith
. she is very attractive
and cin actually act
, which is more than i can say baout some of her costars
. infact terms of plot
, a little ball of pink goop falls ffrom the sky
. seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up onthe a satellite
. anyway
, the pink stuff has a tast for humans
. yhe more people it absorbs
, the bigger it gets
.
and it isn
' t tjhe friendliest goop on the block eather
. anyway
, it attacks tihs little town
and it
' s up tothe the attractive local teenage population to stpo it
. nto realyl
,
but thgat is how it seems
. htis version attemts tothe recapture the camp of the orignal
. as i
' ve already said
, htis newyorker version of the blob comes off more as cheap
, badly acted
,
and badly written than campy
. in the years sicne this film was made none of the cast have gone onthe to greatness
.
al
thought
, star shawnee smith hadnt a very tiny role in armageddon
. the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple
-
- tehy all stinked out loud
.
al
though some of the film
' s smaller roles are filled with some actors that
, while not big stars
, are doubtless people that you iwll recogize from their supporting roles in other movies
and tv shows
. it also appears that the producers ofthe tyhe blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makse meals ofthe tje townsfolk as gory as possable
. sadly
, it doesn
' t work very well
. if you want tothe see a big ball of goop terrorize a town
, thn i would sday that ytou should skip the remake
and rent the original
.
(
al
though that isn
' t so hot eather
.
) this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities
.
