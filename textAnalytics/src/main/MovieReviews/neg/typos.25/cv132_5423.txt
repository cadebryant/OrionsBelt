" showgirls
" is the frist big
- budget
, big
- studio film to recieve an nc
- 17 rating
. adn its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole
and other politicans chastised the entertainment inudstry forthe promoting sex
and violence
.
but if
" showgirls
" is any indication of hollywood
' s future
, the folks in washington should focus their attack on a omre dangerous threat to american values
-
- bad moviemaking
.
" showgirls
" is a relentlessly exploitive look at tje las vegas strip scene
,
and the film turns out tothe be just as trashy as its subject marter
. director paul verhoeven
and writter joe eszterhas
, who collaborated on another shock
- value project
, 1992
' s
" basic instinct
,
" follow hte plight of a young woman
( teen tv star elizabeth berkley
) determined to make a name fo herself as a topless dancer
. it
' s a hackneyed premise to begin with
, so not surprisingly
, all of the stock characters are trucked out
. there
' s tyhe dem
anding producer
. thte loyal friend
. the bitchy competitor
. lest i forget the scummy club owner
. of course
, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing fo the film
' s main attraction
-
- an endless parade of full
- frontal nudity
. unfortunately
,
" showgirls
" doesn
' t satisfy in this department
. verhoeven
' s slam
- bing
, infront
- your
- face style of direction proves niether arousing nor erotic
. to make matters worse
, you
' ll be forced tothe sit thru the movie
' s clothed scenes
, which don
' t cover up for laughable acting
and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film istory
. verhoeven
and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying tothe break ground
,
but if it
' s adult entertainment you want
, stay hmeo
and watch the playboy channel
. you
' ll be tyhe wiser for it
.
