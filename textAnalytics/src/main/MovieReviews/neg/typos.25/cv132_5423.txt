" showgirls
" is the first big
- budget
, big
- studio film tothe receive an nc
- 17 rating
.
and its release last eyar came at a time whn senator bob dole
and other politicans chastised tje entertainment inudstry for promoting sex
and violence
.
but if
" showgirls
" isnt any indication ofthe hollywood ' s future
, the folks iin washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat tothe american values
-
- bad moviemaking
.
" showgirls
" is a relentlessly exploitive look at yhe las vegas strip scene
,
annd the film turns out to be jstu as trashy as its subject matter
. directer paul verhoeven
and writter joe eszterhas
, who collaborated onthe another shock
- value project
, 1992 ' s
" basic instinct
,
" follow the plight ofthe a young woman
( teen tv star elizabeth berkley
) determined to make a nmae for herself as a topless dancer
. it ' s a hackneyed premise to begin iwth
, so not surprisingly
, all of the stock cahracters are trucked out
. there ' s the demanding producer
. the loyal friend
. teh bitchy competitor
. lest i forget yhe scummy club owner
. ofthe course
, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is jsut window dressing for teh film ' s main attraction
-
- an endless parade of full
- frontal nudity
. unfortunately
,
" showgirls
" doesn ' t satisfy infact htis department
. verhoeven ' s slam
- bang
, in
- your
- face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic
. to mkea matters worse
, you ' ll be forced to sit through the movie ' s clothed scenes
, which don ' t cover up for laughable acting
anbd soem of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken infact film history
. verhoeven
and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying tothe break ground
,
but if it ' s adult entertainment you want
, stay home
and watch the playboy channel
. you ' ll be the wiser for it
