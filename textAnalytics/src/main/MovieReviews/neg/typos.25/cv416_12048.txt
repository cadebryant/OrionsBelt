dispite its exceedingly well

, 1995
' s orginial species was oen big hunk of sci
- fi cheese
, from the wirting tothe the feeble performances
. so
, coming from such b
- grade roots
, its sequel
' s stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising
,
yet at the smae timne it is
. it would not hvea been difficult at all for the peple behind species ii to top the hokey original
,
yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad
, if not even worse
. something isnt clearly amiss when thge back doorjam left open forthe a sequel in species

' m nto giving away anything when i say that this installment has an oepn back door of its pwn

, patrick ross
( justin lazard

' s short

)
. this aline dna is not identical tothe tht hwihc created hte original film

, bu it
' s close enought
, anbd upon arival on earth patrick is mating like crazy
, engaging in bloody sex with just baout eveyr woman he cant find
. meanwhile
, scientist dr
. laura baker
( the returning marg helgenberger
) has created a clone of sil named eve
( natasha henstridge again
) fo reasearch purposes
. it doesn
' t take long for eve tothe sense another aline presence
, which send her libido inot hyperdrive
. it
' s up to laura anbd her former partner

!
" exclaims oen character in thte early going
. in terms of qulity
, he
' s absolutly right
,
but he
' s alsot wrong
. yhe new aline first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick
' s pupils tothe dilate once he
' s infected
. looks
and soudns an awful lot liuke the x

' s
" black cancer
" to me
.
but that
' s not the only source director peter medak
and writer chris brancato steal from
. species was already a ripoff of alien
,
but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than tghe original
' s director
, roger donaldson
, did
. human patrick is given a tounge that aslo hasnt a tongue within itself
, adn his alien form more closely resembes teh aline than eve
' s alien body
( which ironically wass designed by alien designer h

. giger
)
. a large alien hive that our heros douse wiht a substance fired from large guns
? aliens sans flamethrowers
. the visual effects were by far the best thign about species
, adn the sequel
' s effects crew at steve johnson
' s xfx inc
. keesh thgat high
- quality tradition alive
; noone cheap
- looking lost in space cgi here
. aftter the effects
, the original
' s best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge
.
however
, medak
and brancato have noone idea what exactly to do with her for tihs installment
. at one point she
' s called on to play alien
" empath
"
? la forest whitaker inthe the original
,
but for most of thge duration she
' s holed up in a glass cell
. by the time thte big breakout so prominately featured in the trailer actually takes place
, the film is well inot its hmeo stretch
. so the rest of thte time we are treated to patrick
, plyed with little zest by lazard
. oen problem with the first film was that the deadly
, horny
,
but innocent
- at
- heart sil was too sympathetic
; no such probelm with patrick
, who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before yhe alien tkaes control
. the rest of the cast also fails to add much
, bu tje writing cxan be faulted for that
. helgenberger
and madsen go through tje motions
,
but they are already hampered by the clich
? d develpment that somewhere betweeen the two films
, the once
- linked laura
and press stopped getting along
. williamson suffers tghe worst indignity
. he trys his best to enliven the token african
- american role
,
but how can anyone recite insulting
, deriviative lines such as
" i
' m gonna get african on someone
' s ass
"
and not appear ridiculous
?
but speices ii
' s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting peice ofthe owrk
. at least tyhe original featured plenty to laff at
-
- unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley
and whitaker
, annd the sight of helgenberger
' s character performing fellatio on madsen
' s
, for a start
.
but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all
, let alone the misguided effort that is requred for something tothe reach teh camp level
. for all the blood adn gore
, nudity
, adn sex thrown in
, species ii is
, qtuie simply
, a vapid bore
.
