outloud of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles thge hell out ofthe us all in hte limey
, a cold
, uninvolving
, confusing new thriller
.
though the plot description may at first seem like it cameback from tjhe pen of elmore leonard
( autor ofthe out ofthe sight
, as well as jackie brown
, get shorty
and pulp fiction
)
, after you watch it
, ytou relize that it
' s nto nearly good enough
. in an aggressively non
- linear fashion
, the limey
( li
* mey
, noun
: an english gentleman
) tells thte story of wilson
( terrence stamp
)
, a british ex
- con jstu released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery
. he hasnt come to the us to seek vengance fo the death ofthe his daughter jenny
. he doesn
' t know much about the circumstances of her demise
, all he has isnt a name
: terry valentine
. valentine was jenny
' s former boyfriend
, a wealthy
and corrupt record executive
. he
' s played by peter fonda
, in his first major role usance the terrific ulee
' s gold in 1997
. seeking valentine
' s reclusive place of residance turns out to be noone easy task for wilson
. he finally finds the impressive abode high in tyhe mountains anbd sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party
. he winds up breaking his cover eventually
, setting off valentine
' s head ofthe security
and valentine himself
, who decides to run for it
. what a mess
. i hvea no problem whn films refuse to be constricted by tyhe linearity of time
-
- pulp fiction
, whcih twisted time every which way
, was a masterpiece
-
-
but i do take exception to movies that deside to play around with it for no reason other tahn to confuse the viewer
. the limey doesnt exactly that
. the plot isnt permeated wiht flashbacks
, flash
- forwards anbd what can onyl be described as r
andom tyme
- travel
, without any evident purpose
. there is noone method tothe this movie
' s madness
. it uses a fancy way tothe tell a story that woudl be better off told more conventionally
and more comprehendably
. the plot isn
' t particularly interesting infront the firt place
: traditionnal
, mildly hackneyed
and not very involving
. htis isnt a sort of brooding film
-
- our protagonist doesn
' t speak much
and the action sequences are done wih an annoyingly perfunctory attitude
. i felt like tjhe directer wasn
' t very interested inthe the proceedings himselv
, almost like he made this film forthe a paycheck
. ditto for the editing
, which seems tothe be deliberately sloppy
and unpleasant
. sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal
. he
' s not much in tjhe way ofthe stature bu he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here
. peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor
: he
' s shy
, quiet
but always effective
. he
' s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression
: his feelings don
' t always show on his face by you can always tell what they are
. this is basically a convetional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion
. why soderbergh couldn
' t just parrot down adn tell a story
, i don
' t know
,
but what he does do certainly doesn
' t work
. the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount tothe precisely ntil
-
- even the action scenes don
' t work
. 1999 may have signified tyhe death of thte traditional ect one
- act two
- ect three storyline
,
but obviously some movies ahev not
yet trancended it
. shall we go back to basics
?
