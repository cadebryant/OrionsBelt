bob the hapyp bastard
' s quickie review
: tjhe odd couple ii grumpy old men
, it ain
' t
. hell
, my fellow americans
, it ain
' t
. walter matthau
and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of theri films over the past faw years
. odd couple ii fiels terribly generic
, where inspite the firt movei
, made thirty one years ago
, feels like a wonderfull tale
. thyat
' s like repackaging campbell
' s soup in a generic food can
, really
. how writer neil simon could
' ve made such a horrible misteek in screen writing is beyond me
. throughout the movie
, i really didn
' t laugh once
. honestly
. i mean
, htere weere dumb situations
, yeah
, liuke the cropduster who let these ood geezers ahev it without any notice
,
but they just really didn
' t seem funny to me
.
and that car rolling off the cliff
? hte only way i would
' ve seen humor in that is if they were still in it
.
and the ending gets all super
- mushy
, too
. in the final twenty mintues or so
, lemmon meets a girl he thikns is the one
,
then loses her
; matthau talks to his son
( a wasted jonathan silverman
) about his amrriage to lemmon
' s daughter
;
and
, ofthe course
, lemmon annd matthau have another roomie situation onthe their h
ands
. ooh
, i relaly gave a lot awya there
, i
' m sure
. consider it a hospitible gester
, you won
' t waste your timne renting this muck
.
