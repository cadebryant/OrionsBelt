bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review
: tje odd cuple ii grumpy old men
, it ain ' t
. hell
, my fellow americans
, it ain ' t
. walter matthau
and jack lemmon team up agina for an even more worn out vehicle than any of theri films over the past few years
. odd couple ii feels terribly generic
, where inwhich the first movie
, made thirty one years ago
, fiels like a wonderful tale
. that ' s like repackaging campbell ' s suop in a generic food can
, really
. how writer neil simon coudl ' ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me
. throughout the movie
, i really didn ' t laugh once
. honestly
. i mean
, there were dumb situations
, yeah
, liek the cropduster who let these ood geezers have it without any notice
,
but they just really didn ' t seem funny to me
.
and that car rolling off the cliff
? the only way i would ' ve seen humor in that is if htey were still infront it
.
and the ending gets all super
- mushy
, too
. in the final twenty mintues or so
, lemmon meets a girl he thinks isnt the one
,
then loses her
; matthau talks to his son
( a wasted jonathan silverman
) about his amrriage tothe lemmon ' s daughter
;
and
, of course
, lemmon
anbd matthau hvea another roomie situation on their hands
. ooh
, i really gave a lot away there
, i ' m sure
. consider it a hospitable gester
, you won ' t waste your time renting htis muck
.
