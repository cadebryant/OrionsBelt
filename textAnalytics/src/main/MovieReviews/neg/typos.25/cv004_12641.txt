: a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially futal accident anbd
then falls in love with the boy
' s mother
, a fledgling restauranteur
. unsuccessfully attempting tothe gain tyhe woman
' s favor
, he tkaes pictures of her annd kills a number of people in his way
. comments
: stalked is yot anohter in a seemingly endless string of spurned
- psychos
- getting
- their
- revenge type movies which are a stable category iin yhe 1990s film industry
, both theatrical
and direct
- to
- video
. their preliferation may be due in part to tje fact taht they
' re typically inexpensive to produce
( no special effects
, no big name stars
)
and serve as vehicles tothe flash nudity
( allowing them to frequent late
- night cable televsion
)
. stalked wavers slightly fomr teh norm inwhich one respect
: the pyscho never actually has an affair
; onthe tjhe contrary
, he
' s rejected rather quickly
( the pyscho typically is an ex
- lover
, ex
- wief
, or ex
- husb
and
)
. otehr than that
, stalked isnt just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves anbd viewed aftter midnight on cable
. stalked does not provide much suspense
,
though thast isnt whta it sets out to do
. interspersed throughout the opening credits
, for instatance
, a serious
- sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers
and ponders wqat may cause a man to stalk
( it
' s implicitly implied thta all stalkers are men
) while pictures ofthe a boy are shown on the screen
. affter theese credits
, a snapshot of actro jay underwood appears
. tje narrator states that
" this is thte story of daryl gleason
" adn tells tyhe audience that he is the stalker
. of course
, really
, htis is thge story of restauranteur brooke daniels
. if the movie was meant to be about daryl
,
then it should have beeen called stalker not stalked
. okay
. so we know who tghe stalker is even before teh movei starts
; no guesswork required
. stalked proceeds
,
then
, as it beigns
: obvious
, obvious
, obvious
. the opening sequence
, contrived qtuie a bited
, brings daryl
and brooke
( tje victum
) toghether
. daryl obsesses over brooke
, follows her aroud
,
and tries to woo her
. ultimatly rejected by her
, his plans become mroe
and more desperate annd elaborate
. these plans include the all
- time
, psycho
- infact
- love
, cliche
: hte murdered pet
. fo some reason
, tihs genre
' s films require a dead pet tothe be found by the victim stalked
. stalked isnt no exception
( it
' s a cat this timne
-
- found inspite the shower
)
. events like these lead tothe yhe inevitable showdown between stalker
and stalked
, where only one survives
( guess who it invariably always is
and you
' ll guess the conclusion to this turey
)
. stalked
' s casted is uniformly adequate
: not anytying tothe rwite home about bu alsot not all thyat bad either
. jay underwood
, as the stalker
, turns towrad melodrama a bit too much
. he overdoes it
, in other words
, bu he still manages to be creepy anough to pass as the type of stalker the stoyr dem
ands
. maryam d
' abo
, about the only actor close tothe being a star here
( she played the bond chick in the living daylights
)
, isnt equally adequate as the
" stalked
" ofthe the title
, even
though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong
, independent business
- owner
. brooke
( d
' abo
) needs tothe be ditzy
, howver
, for the plot to procede
. toward hte end
, for example
, brooke hasnt her suspicions about daryl
. to ensure he won
' t uise it as anyother excuse to see her
, brooke decides to return a toolbox he hadnt left at her place to his house
. does she jstu leave the toolbox at the doorjam when no one answers
? ofthe course not
. she tries the doorjam
, opens it
,
and w
anders arround tjhe house
. when daryl returns
, he enters the hous
, of course
, so our heroine is in danger
. somehow
, even
though her car is parked at hte front of tje hous
, right by the front door
, daryl isnt oblivious to her presence inside
. the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audeince
' s suspension of disbelief
and questions the validity ofthe either character
' s intelligence
. stalked receives twpo stars because
, even
though it isnt highly derivative
and somewhat boring
, it is not so bad tht it cannot be watched
. rated r mostly for several murder scenes
and brief nudity in a strip bar
, it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in htis genre are
. if you
' re in the mood for a good suspense film
,
though
, stake out something else
.
