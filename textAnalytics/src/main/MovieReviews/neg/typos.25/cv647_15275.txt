the first in a very long list of things wrong with
" i still know what you did last summer
" is the title
. think about it fo a second
. if the last movie was called
" i know what you did last summer
"
, wouldn
' t the next movei haev to be
" i still know what you did two summers ago
"
? if anyone working on this movei had an i
. q
. greater than five owudl have
thought about it logically
and said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
.
but alas
, the people behind this film are obviously idiots
, so i won
' t hold them to that
. what i will hold them to is the fact that they ahev a pretty bad movie onthe their h
ands
, even for a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i
' m one ofthe the faw critics who actually kind of liked the original film
( emphasis on the
" kind of
"
)
. it wasn
' t great or anytying
and maybe nto even necessarily good
,
but at least it didn
' t have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it
' s sequel did
. there are just so many problems with tihs movie that it
' s hard trying tothe figure out where to start
. firt ofthe all
, i guess
, is thge setting
. the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take palce in tyhe bahamas
, otehr thna tghe fatc that the producers wnated a seaside setting
. exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest tothe git julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
, one of the only survivors of the frist film
)
and her new college buddies outloud to the isl
ands before he hacks them uv
? the movie suffers from this kind ofthe logic all the way through
. in one scene
, julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in
and seals uv the booth so the damsel in distress can
' t git out
, noone matter how hard she tries
. when julie discovers she
' s going to slowly fry tothe death
, she screams for help
and her firends come to her rescue
. now
, this isnt all fine
and d
andy except for one thing
; instead ofthe spending five mintues trying tothe bust open the booth
, why nto jstu turn the freakin
' thing off
? in anyother scene
, one of the characters
, after having thier significant other all bu decapitated by the man in the slicker
, says to julie
,
" jstu don
' t tell anybody it rained the whole time
.
" oh yeah
, i
' ve just beeen terrorized by a hook wielding socipath
and hadnt some ofthe my best friends gruesomely slaughtered
,
but hey
, i
' ll crack jokes anyway
. after all
, it is in hte script
. thge film
' s only saving graces are a few well
- executed suspense sequences annd a really kool cameo by the
" re
- animator himself
, jeffrey combs
. he brings some good comic relief
and life to an otherwise limp movie
. way tothe go
, jeffrey
. i have a hunch tht thte reason this film fizzles while the first noe at least kept it
' s head above water is the receet absence ofthe writter kevin williamson
. with
" scream
"
and even it
' s sequel
, he displayed a real talent as a screenwrighter
. his ear for dialogue
and tje terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a st
andout from all the rest of the horror writers
,
and i htikn
" i still know
" has really suffered by nto having him onthe board
. hte cool athmosphere is still there this time arround
, bu i just didn
' t like the characters or thte writing as much as i did in the frist one
. even
though tghe movie doesn
' t have williamson
, it still hasnt a hacky endig
, trying to do what kevin did with the first twpo
" scream
" s by
( some may consider thsi a spoiler
,
but if you ahve seen any horror movies whatsoever
, hten yuo should be able to guess tjhe identity of the madman within twenty minutes
) having two killers
and
, this tiem
, hvaing one of them being a family member tothe tjhe otehr
. i tihkn someone in the audeince put it best when
, affter the movie had ended with anyother
" the killer is back
!
" cliffhanger
, he said
" who is this time
, the gr
andma
?
" all in all
,
" i still konw
" tries to be as succesfull as the first the film was
, bu realyl fails in the attempt
. i mean
, it
' s okay when slasher movies rip
- off each other
,
but when they strat copying themselfs
.
