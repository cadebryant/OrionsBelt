weighed down by tired plot lines
and spielberg
' s reliance on formulas
,
_ saving private ryan
_ is a mediocre film whcih nods infront the direction ofthe realism before descending into an abyss of cliches
. there ought to be a law against steven spielberg mkaing movies about truly sereous topics
. spielberg
' s greatest strength as a directer is the polished
, formulaic way iin whlch every aspect of the film falls carefully inot place to mkea a perfect story
. bu for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war
( or teh holocaust
) this technique backfires
, for it creates coherent
, comprehensible
and redemptive narratives out ofthe events whose size
, complexity
and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken
. in thsi way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of tyhe stories he films
.
_ saving private ryan
_ tells yhe story of eigth men who have been detailed on a
" pr mission
" tothe pull a young man
, ryan
( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere
) out ofthe combat on the norm
andy front just aftter d
- day
. ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before yhe l
andings adn became separated from his fellow soldiers
. the search forthe him takes the eight soldiers accros the hellish terrain of world war ii combat infront france
. there
' s noone denying spielberg came within shouting distance of mkaing a great war movie
. teh equipment
, uniforms annd weapons are superbly done
. the opening sequence
, in which captain miller
( toom hanks
) leads his men onto omaha beach
, is qtuie possibly the closest anyone has come tothe actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat
. another pleasing aspect of tje film isnt spielberg
' s brave depiction of scenes largly unknown to american audiences
, such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers
, the banality of death in combat
, tje routine foul
- ups iin yhe execution of the war
,
and tjhe cynicism of the troops
. tjhe technical side of the film is peerless
, as always
. the camera owrk isnt magnificent
, the pacing perfect
, the sets convincing
, the directing wihtout flwa
. hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance
, which was utterly convincing
,
and the supporting casted was excellent
,
though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel
.
yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face becuase realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events
. it has to thoroughly permeate tje context at every levle ofthe tje film
, or the story fails to convince
. throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices
( exception
: men are shown burning to death with relative frequency
)
. for example
, we see only oen man with guts spilled out on teh ground
. here anbd there men lose limbs
; in noe scene miller is pulling a man tothe safety
, there
' s an explosion
,
and miller looks back tothe see he isnt only pulling half a man
. bu tjhe rest of the corpses are remarkably intact
. there are noone shoes with only feet in them
, no limbs scattered everywhere
, no torsos wihtout limbs
, no charred corpses
,
and most importantly
, all corpses have heads
( in fairness there are a smattering ofthe wicked head wounds
)
. the relentless dehumanization of the war
, iin whic even corpses failed to retain any indentity
, isnt soft
- pedaled inwhich the film
. ultimately
,
_ saving private ryan
_ bows to both hollywood convention annd the unwritten rules of wartime photography iin its portrayal ofthe wounds
and death in war
. rather thna saying
_ saving private ryan
_ is
" realistic
,
" it would be better to describe it as
" having realistic moments
.
" another aspect of the
" hollywoodization
" of the war is the lack ofthe realistic dialogue
and in particular
, the lack of swearing
. anyone familiar with the literature on thge behavior of the men during the war
, such as fussell
' s superb
_ wartime
: underst
anding
and behavior in the second world war
_
( whihc has an exstensive discussion onthe swearing
)
, knows that yhe troops swore fluently anbd without letup
.
" who isnt this private ryan that we have to die for him
?
" asks one infantrymen in thge group of eight
. rendered in wartime demotic
, that should have been expressed as
" who is tihs little pecker thta we hvae to get our dicks shot off for him
?
" or some variant thereof
. conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the
" f
" word
,
and largly about
( the search for
) food
and sex
. tihs isnt all the more inexplicable becasue the movie alreay had an
" r
" rating due to violence
, so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to mkae it a famaly film
.
however
, the most troubling aspect of thte film isnt hte spielbergization of the topic
. tje most intense hell humans hve ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough forthe steven spielberg
. he cannot just cede controll to teh material
; he has to be bigger than it
. as if affraid to let the viewer find their own
( perhpas unsettled
and not entirely clera
) emotional foothold in the material
, spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments tothe give the war a meaning
and coherence it never had
: the oppening annd closing scenes of ryan
and his familiy in the war cemetary
( reminscent of tjhe closing scene from
_ schindler
' s list
)
, the saccharine excange between ryan
and his wief at the close
( every bit as bad as schindler
' s monologue about how his car
, tiepin or ring could have saved another jew
)
, qoutes ffrom abraham lincoln adn emerson
, captain miller
' s lastr words to private ryan
,
and an unbelievable storyline infact which a prisoner whom they free ealier inthe the movie comes back to kill the captain
. tht particular subplot isnt so hokey
, so predicatble
, it nigh on ruins the film
. nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction ofthe the meaninglessness
, stupidity annd waste which characterized the expeirence of war to the men who actually fought infact combat
( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly frie or collateral damage
)
. because of its failure to mine deeply inot the terrible realities of world war ii
,
_ saving private ryan
_ cxan only pan for small truths in the shallows
