lauded as a genuis by many
, stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically
- acclaimed films as
" 2001
: a space odyssey
,
"
" a clockwork orange
,
"
" lolita
,
"
and
" dr
. strangelove
, or
: how i learned to stop worrying
anbd love the bomb
.
" now
, sadly
, he ' s added
" eyes wide shut
" to that impeccable body ofthe wrok
and his fianl film is the first
adn only blot on his near
- flawless copybook
. kubrick
, alas
, shoud have quit hwile he wass ahead
. this much
- publicized psycho
- sexual tease
- a
- thon
, with its star billing of real
- life marrieds tom cruise
and nicole kidman
, is nothing more than one long
( two
-
and
- a
- half huors long
) boring exersize that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut
. kubrick
, faithless to arthur schnitzler ' s 1926 novella
" dream story
,
" has confused eroticism with nudity
. he has confused intellectualism with tlaking slowly
. he hasnt confused profundity with pretentiousness
. in addition
, teh director has made some strange casting choices
, leaving sydney pollack in
and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel
and jennifer jason leigh out
. pollack
, the directer of such box
- office hits as
" tootsie
"
and
" out of africa
,
" is normally solid in his occasional acting stints
bu here he ' s miserably out ofthe his depth
.
.
.
and there isn ' t much depth tothe begin with
! unhappily
, there ' s nto likely to be a director ' s cutted of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel
and leigh was the right one
. in fatc
, withthe thte exception of tghe stark black
-
and
- white credits
, snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack
,
and many
, many grainy tracking shots down lavishly
- decorated corridoors
, there ' s none of kubrick ' s trademark brilliance in thsi film
. it doesn ' t help that the stry
, as delivered
, is rediculous
. cruise
annd kidman
, who bring little more than marital torpor to the project
, play well
- to
- dont newyorker yorkers bill
adn alice harford
. he ' s a doctor
and she ' s an unemployed art gallery director
and htey share a central park west address
. at an opulent party hosted by thier freind victor ziegler
( pollack
)
, alice gets a little tipsy
and starts dancing with a jeremy irons
- like hungarian
, who ' s singularly determined to get her in tje sack
. bill
, too
, is seen arm
- infact
- arm iwth a cuple of models before he ' s pulled awya to deal with an overdoser
. back hmeo
, bill
and alice smoke a littel pot before alice ' s aggressive jealousy kicks inwhich
. as retribution
, she confesses to her husband thta she once hadnt deep feelings forthe a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she
annd bill once stayed
. this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin
; he pounds the streets of tje village in his hevy balck overcoat struggling wiht balck
-
and
- white images ofthe alice in the grip of a horny midshipman
. it ' s all way too much for him
. fo revenge
, bill almost hasnt sex wih a hooker
. he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store
.
then he almsot doens the hooker ' s roommate
.
annd he ' s allmost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum ofthe his tips him off tothe a mysterious
, password
- protected party where everyone wears masks
and
" tjhe women are incredable
"
( i
. e
.
, naked
)
. thsi
" erotic
" set piece
, a cult
- ish bacchanal complete with chanting
, icense
,
and lots of strategically
- placed partygoers covering uv the dirty
, might impress the likes ofthe hugh hefner
,
but it ' s a lot less shocking than it ' s intended to be
. what ' s the big deal
? bill doesn ' t exactly
* dont
* anytying
( otehr thna throw his monay
and credentials around
)
,
and alice onyl ever lusted in her heart
. whoop
- dee
- doo
. still
, tehy mkae up at the same agonizingly slow pace
-
- was kubrick
, notorious for multiple takes
, paying them at an hourly rate
? even geniouses hvea their bad days
.
" eyes wide shut
" just happens to be kubrick ' s bad day
, an unerotic
, disappointing
,
and alltogether pointless end tothe an otherwise memorable carrer
