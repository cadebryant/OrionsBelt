lauded as a genius by many
, stanley kubrick comm
ands a superlative filmography that includes such critically
- acclaimed films as
" 2001
: a space odyssey
,
"
" a clockwork orange
,
"
" lolita
,
"
and
" dr
. strangelove
, or
: how i learned to stop worrying
and lvoe tjhe bomb
.
" now
, sadly
, he
' s added
" eyes wide shut
" tothe that impeccable body of work adn his final film isnt the first
and onyl blot onthe his near
- flawless copybook
. kubrick
, alas
, shoud have quit while he was ahead
. this much
- publicized pyscho
- sexual tease
- a
- thon
, with its star billing of rela
- life marrieds tom cruise
and nicole kidman
, is nothing omre than noe long
( twpo
-
and
- a
- half hours long
) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut
. kubrick
, faithless tothe arthur schnitzler
' s 1926 novella
" dream story
,
" hasnt confused eroticism with nudity
. he hasnt confused intellectualism with talking slowly
. he has confused profundity wih pretentiousness
. in addition
, the directer has made some stange casting choices
, leaving sydney pollack in
and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel
and jennifer jason leigh outloud
. pollack
, the director of such box
- office hits as
" tootsie
"
and
" out of africa
,
" isnt normally solid in his occasional acting stints
but here he
' s miserably outloud of his depth
.
.
.
and there isn
' t much depth to begin wtih
! unhappily
, htere
' s not likely to be a director
' s cut ofthe this film to determine whether thte decision to exorcise keitel
and leigh was the right one
. in fact
, with the exception ofthe the stark black
-
and
- white credits
, snatches ofthe baroque music on the soundtrack
, adn many
, many grainy tracking shots down lavishly
- decorated corridors
, ther
' s none of kubrick
' s trademark brilliance in this film
. it doesn
' t help that the story
, as delivered
, isnt rediculous
. cruise
and kidman
, who bring littel more tahn marital torpor tothe yhe project
, play well
- to
- do new yorkers bill
and alice harford
. he
' s a doctor
and she
' s an unemployed art gallery directer
and they share a central park west address
. at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler
( pollack
)
, alice gets a little tipsy
and starts dancing with a jeremy irons
- like hungarian
, who
' s singularly determined tothe get her iin tjhe sack
. bill
, too
, is seen arm
- inthe
- arm with a couple of models befoer he
' s pulled away to deal with an overdoser
. bcak hmeo
, bill
and alice smoke a little pot befoer alice
' s aggressive jealousy kicks iin
. as retri
bution
, she confesses tothe her husban tht she once had deepo feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she adn bill once stayed
. this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin
; he pounds the streets ofthe the village inspite his heavy balck overcoat stuggling with black
-
and
- white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman
. it
' s all way too much for him
. for revenge
, bill almost hasnt sex with a hooker
. he almsot hasnt feelings fo a underage girl he sees in a costume store
.
then he almost doesnt yhe hooker
' s roomate
.
and he
' s almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy whn an ood coleeg chum of his tips him off to a mysterious
, password
- protected party where everyone wears masks
and
" the women are incredible
"
( i
. e
.
, naked
)
. this
" erotic
" set piece
, a cult
- ish bacchanal complete with chanting
, incense
,
and lots of stratagically
- placed partygoers covering uv the dirty
, might impress thte likes ofthe hugh hefner
,
but it
' s a lot less shocking than it
' s intended to be
. what
' s the big deal
? bill doesn
' t exactly
* do
* anything
( otehr than throw his money
and credentials around
)
, anbd alice only ever lusted infront her heart
. whoop
- dee
- doo
. still
, they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace
-
- was kubrick
, notorious forthe multiple takes
, paying them at an hourly rate
? even geniouses have their bad dyas
.
" eyes wide shut
" just happens tothe be kubrick
' s bad day
, an unerotic
, disappointing
,
and alltogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable carrer
.
