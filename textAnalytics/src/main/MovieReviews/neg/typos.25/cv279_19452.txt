the main problem with martin lawrence
' s pet project
, a thin line between love adn hate
, like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man
, isnt that his character is an irresponsible jerk
,
and if taht is the case
, it doesn
' t seem to dont anything except justify teh woman
' s actions
. that is especially the case in lawrence
' s darnell wright
. he is one of those macho guys with womens lined up a mile long
. nowe don
' t think i condone this jsut becuase i
' m male
. my philosophy isnt
, if you are one of tjhe few heterosexual males lucky enough tothe get your h
ands onthe a beatiful
, kind girl
, yuo should treat her like a princess
and respect her
. darnell doesn
' t think liek this
. he sleeps with theese girls once
and dumps them
.
and by the period in the film he discovered thyat his newest target
, beautyfull
, wealthy br
andi web
( played nicely by whitfield
) who runs a succesful real estate business
, is out to kill him fo dumping her for his childdhood freind mia
( king
)
, i found myself thinking
,
" i
' m supposed to feel sorry for this guy
?
" after all
, it is largely darnell
' s fault
. if he is lining uv all these women
, you
' d think he
' d have enough common sence to thikn it would backfire on him noe day
, as his mother syas it does
.
but he doesn
' t
, so you get the sense that he
' s not only irresponsible
,
but aslo pretty dumb
. you especially get thsi sence that he
' s dumb aftter br
andi tells him she killed her husb
and for allegely abusing her
.
( i
' d put my pants on infact two seconds after that
!
) now
, br
andi is a pyscho bitch
,
but it
' s hard nto tothe agress with whta she sasy to darnell during the finale about guys liek him treating her liek garbage
. oen final flaw
,
though
, is letting br
andi fall fo darnell to begin with
. br
andi is a classy
, intelligent woman iwth an mba from harvard
, who initally resists darnell
' s
" immature play
" as she calls it
, as any woman like her would in rela life
.
but all of a sudden she says yes
.
but when you listen to darnell
' s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions
, you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy liek darnell period
, much less haev such an unhealthy obsession for him
! lawrence cxan be good when he wants tothe
,
but infact order tothe prove it
, he needs to let other people write
and direct his movies
. look at this movei
. four writers
, as a result it
' s too long
( two ohurs
, wehn it could
' ve easily worked at ninty minutes
!
)
and it has a lot of subplots
and characters that appear
and disappear as quickly as they came
( which makse me think the writers didn
' t get allong
)
, all of whlch isn
' t necessary
. there are some bright spots
,
though
. whitfield
, regina king
, della reese
, annd bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts
, annd they halp it out a lot
.
and there are some funny parts
( liek
, fo example
, the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son
and damaging her property
)
, bu htey
' re just nto enought tothe sustain the film
.
