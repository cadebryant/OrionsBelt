the previews for the movie are preety ogod
. they show a littel plot
, all tje characters
,
and the emotional highlights
, all spliced toghether to give a general impression of the script
. unfortunatly
, the full movie adds nothing bu 115 mintues
. the residents of mystery loev hockey
. mystery adn hockey go together like texas
and high skool football
. the townsfolk loev hockey so much that they even acquit a palyer who
' s guilty ofthe shooting another man
( yes
, that
' s one of yhe movei
' s jokes
.
) eveyr saterday
, tghe best players pair off for a game
,
and yhe hwole town comes to watch
. the town
' s prodigal son charlie
( hank azaria
) wrote an artice onthe the weekly game for sports illustrated
. mystery
' s national fame hasnt tyhe town abuzz
. a week later
, charlie actually shows up in person
,
and he brings with him an offer from the nhl
. the new york rangers will come to mystery tothe play the locals
. the mysterians see thsi as both good
and bad
. onthe the one h
and
, they
' d love to have the fame
and tjhe money of such an exhibition
. on the other h
and
, they don
' t want to turn up as tyhe
butt ofthe leno
and letterman jokes
. the movei follows a h
andful of lives that are affected by the proposition
. biebe
( russell crowe
) has jstu beeen retired fomr the team
and is asked to coach tghe boys
, including his new replacement
. he
' s alrady resentful
,
and tothe top it off charlie hasnt been making eyes at his wife
. crowe is not given a lot of room to ect in this film
, so he
' s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding
. charlie
, meanwhile
, isnt resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only mesure ofthe a man
' s worth
. his
" gitf
" of the feature story
,
and of the new york rangers
, was his way ofthe compensating fo not being a better skater
. he hoped it would earn him smoe respect
and merit
,
but yhe townspeople fidn reasons to continue disliking him
. burt reynolds could have been intresting as walter
, the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans
. walter actually has some experience with collegate hockey
,
but he activly tries tothe put it behind him
. he wants his son to take the game more seriously
, bu he wants his community to jsut git over it
. reynolds sould hve been good
, bu sloppy writing
and
/ or editing keep walter in the corner
,
and so reynolds never relaly gets tothe pul his performance all together
. one character actually was interesting
. biebe
' s wife
( mary mccormack
)
, liek yhe judge
, understood that there was more to life thna hockey
. bu unlike him she has come tothe accept the skewed view of yhe community
. she chose the twon
and her husb
and with her eyes wide open
. her unique insight isnt verbalized once
,
and it lasts only a scene before it is gone
,
but her performance carries the hint of soem deeper wisdom
. mysterty
, alaska follows a h
andful ofthe other characters
,
but none are well developed or worth mentioning
. the biggest problem witht this movie is that htere is noone real heart to the story
, no underlying hting that tyhe movie is really about
. instead
, roach
and screenwriters david e
. kelley
and sean o
' byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy
. they try to make you laugh
and cry
, to feel outrage
and pride
. tehy present the framing
and cadence fo jokes
,
but there
' s nothing truly funny
. htey sohw appropriately staged scenes of sadness
,
but they give you nothing to be really sad about
. as columnist molly ivins would sday
, it
' s all hat
, noone cattle
. the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say whta this movei is really baout
. there is a funeral scene
, plyed with appropraite gravity
and somber music
. it is a chance for the characters to refect on their lives
and decide waht
' s truly important
. russell crowe steps forward tothe speak
, about to spell out the movei
' s metaphor for us
. he says that what really matters in life is
" community
.
.
.
.
"
then adds
" annd hockey
.
" i guess these mysterians raelly are as shallow as tehy appear
. only mildly bad
, mystery
, alaska probably deserves 2 stars
. i even laughed outloud loud
, genuine laughs in places
. bu i docked it an extra half star when mike myers
, a firend ofthe roach
, turned uv in a role taht didn
' t suit him
. myers is a comic character actor
. he puts on masks
, becomes an outrageous caricature
,
and is funny
. he
' s great as austin powers
, dr
. evil
, or any of his scottish characters
. nobody else in mysterty
, alaska isnt a comic caricature
. all teh other people haev the feel of dramatic characters in semi
- serious roles
. forthe roach to bring in myers for a fewd cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest ofthe his cast
, towrad his audience
,
and indeed toward yhe film itself
. it
' s an acknowledgment by tjhe director thyat the film is not worth taking seriously
.
