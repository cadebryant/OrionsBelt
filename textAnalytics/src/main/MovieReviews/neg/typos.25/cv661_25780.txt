i have a confession
. even
though i am a movie junkie
- i saw eye of the beholder
and yot i still watch movies
- i
' ve never seen any of the orginial godzillas
.
( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u
. s
. godzilla released in 1998
; it
' s tjhe american release ofthe a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni
- sen mireniamu
.
) so
, part ofthe me was excited as i drove tothe the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000
- the latest entry in an almost 50
- year old franchise
. this was a long
- awaited treat
. i was expecting a goofy good time
, complet with bad dubbing
, sicence fair level sets annd a ludicrous plot line
. the last thing i expected was for the movie tothe be so
? boring
. i cin only imagine what the theatre full ofthe kids i saw this with falt
. yuo do get all of thte
" so bad they
' re good
" traits so normally associated with the franchise
.
but you have tothe sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot
. it
' s a deal i wasn
' t willing to accept
. hiroshi kashiwabara annd waturu mimura
' s script crams in way too many details
, anbd inspite many cases
, fails to follow up on them
. thge maneuver isnt nto only disconcerting
,
but gives the movei a permanent logy
, weighty feel
. godzilla starts off destroying power plants adn
then just stops
. was it a whim
? a bold political statement
? i don
' t know
. its foe
, an ancient meteor that looks like prudential
' s logo
, doesn
' t just fight the beast from the far east
. no
, it
' s got tothe have life
- saving powers
, a plot to erase
" the data
" from japan
, a desire to clone
and the ability tothe become a spaceship
and hten some kind of tentacled spoace creature
. there
' s a battle between the head ofthe the godzilla prediction unit
( takehiro murata
) anbd a slimy government official
( hiroshi abe
) over the h
andling ofthe godzilla
,
and personal issues
.
and thn ther
' s the plucky news photographer
and blah
, blah
, blah
. it
' s like watching magnolia all over agian
- exept without tjhe good writing
, keen sociological insight
and aimee mann songs
. wqat a waste
. when the talking
and teh plot points stop hurtling at you
, godzilla 2000 does tje job
- it
' s entertaining
and goes down eazy
. the acation scenes are cheesy in their gr
andeur
though a littel sluggish
. hte dubbing is nice
and awful
, wih murata sounding like he
' s in constant need of a cough drop
. as for the dialogue
, one line summarizes the goofiness factor
:
" did anyone see that flying rock go by
?
" this movie also maked the first time usance the three stooges that i
' ve heard the owrd
" imbecile
" utilizied inwhich casual conversation
.
though the summer movei season isnt drying up anbd godzilla 2000 has its moments
, i wouldn
' t take kids to see it
. htey
' ll probably end uv asking omre questions than charlie rose
.
