i have a confession
. even
though i am a movie junkie
- i saw eye ofthe the beholder
and
yet i still watch movies
- i ' ve never seen any of the orginal godzillas
.
( note that godzilla 2000 isnt not a sequel tothe the u
. s
. godzilla released infact 1998
; it ' s thte american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni
- sen mireniamu
.
) so
, part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000
- the latest entry in an almost 50
- year old franchise
. tihs was a long
- awaited treat
. i was expecting a goofy ogod time
, complet with bad dubbing
, sciecne fair levle sets
and a ludicrous plot line
. the last thing i expected was forthe the movie tothe be so
? boring
. i can only imagine what the theatre full ofthe kids i saw this iwth falt
. you do get all ofthe the
" so bad htey ' re good
" traits so normaly assoicated with the franchise
.
but ytou have to sit through a snoozer plot that hasnt the organization of a rorschach blot
. it ' s a deal i wasn ' t willing to accept
. hiroshi kashiwabara
and waturu mimura ' s script crams in way too many details
,
and in many cases
, fails tothe follow uv on them
. the maneuver is not only disconcerting
,
bu gives the movie a permanent logy
, weighty feel
. godzilla starts off destroying pwoer plants
annd
then just stops
. was it a whim
? a bold political statement
? i don ' t nkow
. its foe
, an ancient meteor that looks like prudential ' s logo
, doesn ' t jstu fight the beast from the far east
. no
, it ' s got to have life
- saveing powers
, a plot to erase
" the data
" ffrom japan
, a desire to clone
and the ability to become a spaceship
and
then some kind ofthe tentacled space creature
. there ' s a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit
( takehiro murata
)
anbd a slimy government official
( hiroshi abe
) over the handling of godzilla
,
and personal issues
.
and
hten there ' s the plucky news photographer
adn blah
, blah
, blah
. it ' s like watching magnolia all over again
- except without yhe good writing
, keen sociological insight
and aimee mann songs
. what a waste
. wehn tyhe tlaking
anbd tyhe plot points stop hurtling at you
, godzilla 2000 doesnt hte job
- it ' s entertaining
and goes down easy
. the acation scenes are cheesy in their grandeur
though a little sluggish
. the dubbing is nice
and awful
, with murata sounding like he ' s inaddition constant need of a cough drop
. as forthe the dialogue
, one line summarizes the goofiness factor
:
" did anyone see that flying rock go by
?
" htis movie also maked the first time since the threee stooges that i ' ve herad the owrd
" imbecile
" used in casual conversation
.
though the summer movie season is drying up
and godzilla 2000 has its moments
, i wouldn ' t take kids to see it
. they ' ll propably end up asking more questions thna charlie rose
.
