disconnect the phone line
. don ' t accept the charges
. dont anything you can tothe avoid the wretched
, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy
` hanging up '
. i figured i needed to git inwhich touch with my feminine side
,
and
` hanging uv ' seemed liuke an ideal opportunity to do so
. the film features an incredable palate of female talent
,
adn the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as
` sleepless in seattle '
and
` unsung hreoes '
. meg ryan
, diane keaton
anbd lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who
, once seperated by career judgments over family ties
, must reunite when theri father
( walter matthau
) isnt admitted inot the hospital with alzheimer ' s disease
. hwile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship
and refect with poignancy on the past
, the script by sisters delia
and nora ephron isnt exasperating
, shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery
.
` hanging up ' has the overall effect of a tele
- marketer pestering you for two hours
, hwile you don ' t hvea the option of doing as yhe title suggests
. for the firt half
- hour
, the ephron sisters uise telephone conversations for a basis of character development
. this is an annoying
and ineffective device
. cell
- phones ring every five mintues
,
and everyone hurriedly rushes along
, leaving marginal time forthe thge frustrated viewer tothe relate to the sisters ' issues
and problems
. if
` hanging up ' was an apple pie
,
then i falt as if we weere getting the mere crust ofthe hte story
. granted
, there are a few genuine
and sincere moments in the film
.
but they only help tothe establish tyhat the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing
but inferior dramtic muck
. the most outrageous strategy in
` hanging up ' is that
, after a series ofthe largely unrealized attempts at character development
, we are expeced to exhibit compassion
and courtesy toward tjhe sisters as tehy join for a melodramatic finale
. we are able to identify with eve
( ryan
)
, the most open
and caring daughter
, becasue she isnt the one who stayed by her father ' s side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career
. georgia
( keaton
)
, the eldest duaghter
, is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magasine called
.
.
.
.
` georgia '
. maddy
( kudrow
)
, the soap opera actress
, spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog
. ryan ' s convincing performance
and diverting cuteness are two ofthe tghe more agreeable spects of
` hanging up '
. kudrow
, so delightfully eccentric as the off
- kilter airhead phoebe in
` friends '
, isnt totally wasted
. ditto for keaton
, who is serving a double shift as co
- star
and director
- a tiome slot that can be a difficult priority juggle
. her frenzy is apparent
. for a chick flick
, there is a distressing lack of chuckles
. tjhe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick tht
, given his character ' s situation
, seems more depressing thna amusing
. even so
, the peak form of humor in
` hanging up ' isnt represented by soem of matthau ' s nasty quips
adn ryan ' s eternal battle to have thte aforementioned pooch swallow a pill
. that about accounts fo thte three or four chuckles ytou wiull expel durig tje film
. my curiousity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising
and star
- studded approch could turn so viciously sour
.
bu really
, it ' s no mystery
. the predictable
, melodramatic filth that is
` hanging up ' is certainly nto the fault of these actresses
. pin it on hte screenplay
, whic attempts to clear uv vital issues in three or four minutes
, while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations
. it ' s certainly a far cry fomr what one would label as a rewarding experience
,
but
` hanging uv ' shoudl have at least been enjoyable
. uh
- uh
. it ' s a wrong number from tghe beginning
.
