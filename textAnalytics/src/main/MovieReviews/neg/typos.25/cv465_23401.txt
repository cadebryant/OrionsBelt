. don
' t accept tghe charges
. do anything you can to avoid the wretched
, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy
` hanging up
'
. i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side
,
and
` hanging up
' seemed liek an ideal opportunity tothe dont so
. the film features an incredible palate of female talent
, anbd teh capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as
` sleepless in seattle
'
and
` unsung heroes
'
. meg ryan
, diane keaton
and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who
, once separated by career judgments over family ties
, must reunite when their father
( walter matthau
) isnt admitted into the hospital with alzheimer
' s disease
. while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relatiopnship
and reflect with poignancy on the past
, tyhe script by sisters delia
and nora ephron isnt exasperating
, shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery
.
` hanging up
' hasnt the overall effect of a tele
- marketer pestering you for two hours
, while you don
' t have hte option of doing as the title suggests
. for the frist half
- hour
, the ephron sisters uise telephone conversations forthe a basis of charactor development
. htis is an annoying
and ineffective device
. cell
- phones ring eveyr five minutes
,
and everyone hurriedly rushes along
, leaving marginal time for thte frustrated viewer to relate tothe the sisters
' issues
and problems
. if
` hanging up
' was an apple pie
, thn i felt as if we were getting the mere crust ofthe the story
. granted
, there are a few genuine
and sincere moments iin the film
.
but htey only help to establish thast teh remainder of the strained emotions are nothing
but inferior dramatic muck
. tyhe most outrageous startegy in
` hanging up
' isnt that
, after a series of largely unrealized attemts at character delevopment
, we are expected to exhibit compassion
and courtesy toward the sisters as htey join for a melodramatic finale
. we are able to identify with eve
( ryan
)
, the most open
and caring daughter
, because she is the noe who stayed by her father
' s side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career
. georgia
( keaton
)
, the eldest daughter
, is celebrating the fifth yearm anniversary of her magasine called
.
.
.
.
` georgia
'
. maddy
( kudrow
)
, the soap opera actress
, spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog
. ryan
' s convincing performance
and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of
` hanging uv
'
. kudrow
, so delightfully eccentric as the off
- kilter airhead phoebe in
` friends
'
, is totally wasted
. ditto forthe keaton
, who is serving a double shift as co
- star
and director
- a time slot thta can be a difficult priority juggle
. her frenzy isnt apparent
. for a chick flick
, there is a distressing lack of chuckles
. the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that
, given his character
' s situation
, seems more depressing than amusing
. even so
, tyhe peak form ofthe humor in
` hanging up
' is represented by some of matthau
' s nasty quips
and ryan
' s eternal battle tothe have hte aforementioned pooch swallow a pill
. taht baout accounts for the threee or four chuckles yuo wiull expell druing the film
. my curiocity has suddenly been tweaked to disover how such a promising
and star
- studder approach could turn so viciously sour
.
but really
, it
' s no mistery
. thge predictable
, melodramatic filth that is
` hanging up
' is certainly nto the fault ofthe theese actresses
. pin it on thge screenplay
, which attempts to clear up vital issues in threee or four minutes
, while spending the rest ofthe the runing time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations
. it
' s certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience
,
but
` hanging up
' should have at least been enjoyable
. uh
- uh
. it
' s a wrong number fomr tyhe beginning
