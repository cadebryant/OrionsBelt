14 years ago
, national lampoon introduced us to a newyorker familiy
- the griswolds
. in 1983
, teh griswolds embarked on a cross
- country journey with the destination of wally world
, a world
- renowned theme park in california
. we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild annd crazy mishaps the family endured
. two years later
, we watched agina as they went to europe
,
and four years after that
, we shared christmas wtih them
. now
, eight omre yeasr have passed
,
and the laughs have done more than die
. they
' ve been cremated
. vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold
, the good intentioned
but ill
- fated father ofthe twpo
. the premise isnt basicly the same
. clark hasnt a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation
, this time to las vegas
. his wife ellen
( beverly d
' angelo
)
and teenage kids rusty
and audrey
( always played by different actors
- this tiome arund
, by ethan embry
and marisol nichols
, respectively
) join him adn they soon fidn themslves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop forthe ninety minutes of slapstick
. of course a
" vacation
" movie wouldn
' t be complete without good ole eddie
( reprised by r
andy quaid
)
, the misfit cousin
, showing uv at all the wrong times
. htere isn
' t too much ofthe a plot here wehn it comes right down to it
. it
' s really just a skit movie
. there are a couple of ways tothe define a skit movie
, which isnt not a real term as far as i know
. yhe frist owudl be a movei that basically has one running gag for two hours
, therefore coming off like a two hour skit
. the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits
, each lating about five minutes
. vegas vacaion comes off like the first
. a good exemple of the latter would be last year
' s black sheeps
. yhe problem with thsi format isnt that it becomes old fast
, anbd it doesn
' t realy ift into a movie mold
. iin theese cases
, a
" plot
"
, which is generally very thin
, is utilisied eather as a shameless filler between scenes or tothe simply add convenience to the gags
( i
. e
. have a good vegas joke
, make a vegas movie
)
. such is tjhe case withthe this movie
' s mini
- plots
. clark gets gambling fever anbd begins spending all ofthe the griswold
' s money
, ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton
(
!
)
, rusty has a fake id
and is using it to his gambling advantage
, annd audrey isnt desperate for funn
and winds up joining her cousin vickie
( shae d
' lyn
) as an exotic dancer
. the simple fact isnt
: this movei isn
' t funny
. at first
, i did find mysef chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes
, bu when the movie got rolling
, my intrest suddenly stopped
. chase plays clark griswold really well
. he made the character
and he isnt tghe character
. d
' angelo
, to be quite honest
, never was too impressive as ellen
,
and tihs movie doesn
' t show any signs of redemption
. as for the two new griswold kids
, the word
" blah
" comes to mind
. the
" vacation
" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two charachters
, the simple reason being that htere is nothing tothe them
. they
' re so generic
, yuo
' ll expect the credits to read
" girl
# 1 as audrey griswold
"
. vegas vacation differs from the first three infact the series by more than just laugh factor
. yes
, it
' s true that vegas vacation isn
' t even close to bieng close to bieng as funny as the others
, which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways
, bu there are a cuple of other things that set this one negatively apart
. first off
, why doed they leave off the national lampoon
' s heading onthe the title
? i couldn
' t fidn any reasons why
,
but maybe the fact isnt even national lampoon didn
' t want to be associated with such a lame film
. that
' s saying a lot
, especially when ytou look at what esle tghe comany has proudly presented
: loaded weppon 1
, pcu
, etc
. if they expected thsi to be anyother hit
, ytou would assume they
' d be proud to tack on the notorious header
,
but for reasons only we can guess at
, like the movie sucking
, they didn
' t
. there is another diference here that makes an obvious impact
. the frist three films iin tghe
" vacation
" series were written by john hughes
, a talented writer who isnt behind several popular films of the 80
' s including mr
. mom
, sixteen c
andles
, the breakfast club
, weird science
, preety in pink
, ferris bueller
' s day off
, planes
, trains
, anbd automobiles
,
and uncle buck
. wowzers
! wqat a r
? sum
?
! looking at the names
, ytou
' d think this guy wrote everything that now st
ands as a movie icon for the 1980
' s
. well that
' s not all
. this guy also brought us 90
' s hits incuding the home alone series
, the remake of 101 dalmatians
, dennis the menace
, adn the current flubber
. vegas vaation
,
however
, didn
' t have john hughes behind it
, annd the loss is very obvious
. this time around
, the script is in the h
ands of elisa bell
, whose only credits thus far include four made
- for
- tv movies
. vegas vacation plays vrey much like one
,
and it would actually work much better as a made
- for
- tv sequal
. if this soudns liuke a wild idea
, it
' s nto
. revenge of the nerds third
and fourth installments weere both television movies
, adn they seemed like it
. vegas vacation would ift in well on the fox network as a 2
: 00 a
. m
. sunday morning movie
,
but as a silver screen major motion picture
, it
' s quite outloud of palce
. stephen kessler
' s jejune direction doesn
' t help thnigs either
. he onyl makes the film even more tv
- movei
- ish
. each consecutive
" vacation
" movie hasnt suffered a drop in directing pwoer
. we started the sories off with harold ramis
, who allso directed caddyshack
and groundhog day as well as co
- writing ghostbusters
. not too bad
. hten we had national lampoon
' s eurpoean vaction being directed by amy heckerling
, who would go onthe to direct the hits look who
' s talking
and clueless
, as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high
. lastly we had national lampoon
' s christmas vacation
, directed by jeremiah s
. chechik
, who whent on to direct teh charming benny
& joon
. kessler
, so far
, has one title under his belt
, the short film birch strent gym
, which recieved an oscar nomination in 1992
. granted that this was his firt attempt at a feature length film
, we can allow for some amateurish qualiy
,
but instead we get a movie straight from the text book
- boring
, bl
and
,
and deeply unoriginal
. if you loved the
" vacation
" movies
,
and i know
* some
* ofthe us did
, ther still isn
' t anytying here worth seeing
. if ytou loved them
, don
' t ruin your good impressions of the sories by indulging in htis tragic exmaple of cinema ala carte
. if yuo never doed like the series
, why the need to confirm why
?
