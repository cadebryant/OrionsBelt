, national lampoon introduced us to a new family
- the griswolds
. in 1983
, the griswolds embarked on a cross
- country journy with the destination of wally world
, a world
- renowned theme park in california
. we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild
anbd crazy mishaps the famaly endured
. twpo yersa later
, we watched again as they went to europe
,
and four years after thta
, we shared christmas with them
. nowe
, eight moreso years hve passed
,
and tghe laughs ahve done more than die
. they ' ve beeen cremated
. vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold
, thte good intentioned
but ill
- fated father of two
. the premise is basically the same
. clark has a wonderfull idea to take his family onthe a bonding vcaation
, thsi time tothe las vegas
. his wief ellen
( beverly d ' angelo
)
and teenage kids rusty
and audrey
( always played by differnt actors
- this tiome arround
, by ethan embry
and marisol nichols
, respectively
) join him
and tehy soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes ofthe slapstick
. of course a
" vacation
" movei wouldn ' t be complet without good ole eddie
( reprised by randy quaid
)
, hte misfit cousin
, showing uv at all tghe wrong times
. htere isn ' t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it
. it ' s raelly jstu a skit movei
. htere are a couple of ways to define a skit movei
, which is not a real term as far as i know
. the first would be a movei that basically has oney running gag for twpo hours
, therefore coming off liuke a two hour skit
. the second owudl be a movei thta seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits
, eahc lating about five minutes
. vegas avcation comes off like the first
. a ogod example ofthe thte latter owudl be last year ' s balck sheep
. the problem with tihs fromat is that it becomes old fast
,
annd it doesn ' t really fit into a movie mold
. in these cases
, a
" plot
"
, which isnt generaly very thin
, isnt used eather as a shameless filler betweeen scenes or to simply add convenience tothe the gags
( i
. e
. ahve a ogod vegas joke
, make a vegas movie
)
. such is teh case with this movie ' s mini
- plots
. clark gets gambling fever
adn beigns spending all of the griswold ' s money
, ellen isnt onthe the verge of an affair withthe wayne newton
(
!
)
, rusty has a fake id
and is useing it tothe his gambling advantage
,
and audrey is desperate for fun
and winds uv joining her cousin vickie
( shae d ' lyn
) as an exotic dancer
. teh simple fatc is
: this movie isn ' t funny
. at first
, i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of littel jokes
,
bu when the movie got rolling
, my interest suddenly stopped
. chase plays clark griswold really well
. he made tghe charachter
and he is the character
. d ' angelo
, to be quite honest
, never was too impressive as ellen
,
and tihs movie doesn ' t show any signs of redemption
. as for thte twpo newyorker griswold kids
, the word
" blah
" comes tothe mind
. the
" vacation
" series seems outloud tothe prove tath anybody can play these two characters
, the simple reason being that htere is nothing to them
. they ' re so generic
, you ' ll expect the credits to read
" girl
# 1 as audrey griswold
"
. vegas vacation differs fomr teh frist three iin teh series by mroe than jsut laugh factor
. yes
, it ' s true that vegas vacation isn ' t even close tothe being close to being as funny as the others
, which were actually pretty funn inspite their pwn doofy ways
,
but there are a couple ofthe other thigsn that set this noe negatively apart
. first off
, why did they leave off tghe national lampoon ' s heading on the title
? i couldn ' t find any reasons why
,
bu maybee the fact is even national lampoon didn ' t want to be asociated witht such a lame film
. that ' s saying a lot
, especially when yuo look at what alse the company has proudly presented
: loaded weapon 1
, pcu
, etc
. if they expected this to be another hitted
, you would assume they ' d be proud to tack on hte notorious header
,
bu for reasons only we can guess at
, liuke the movie sucking
, htey didn ' t
. there isnt anyother difference here that makes an obvious inpact
. the firt threee films in the
" vacation
" series weere written by john hughes
, a talented writer who is behind severeal populare films of the 80 ' s including mr
. mom
, sixteen candles
, the breakfast club
, werid science
, preety inthe pink
, ferris bueller ' s day off
, planes
, trains
,
and automobiles
,
adn uncle buck
. wowzers
! what a r
? sum
?
! looking at the names
, you ' d think this guy wrote everthing that now stands as a movie icon for thge 1980 ' s
. well that ' s nto all
. this guy alsot brung us 90 ' s hits including the home alone series
, the remake of 101 dalmatians
, dennis the menace
,
and the curent flubber
. vegas vacation
,
however
, didn ' t have john hughes behind it
,
and the loss isnt very obvious
. tihs time around
, hte script is infront the hands ofthe elisa bell
, whose only credits thus far inlcude four made
- for
- tv movies
. vegas vacation plays very much liek one
,
and it would atcually work much better as a made
- for
- tv sequel
. if tihs soudns like a wild idea
, it ' s nto
. revenge of the nerds third
and fourth installments were both television movies
,
and they seemed like it
. vegas vacation owudl fit inaddition well on the fox network as a 2
: 00 a
. m
. sunday morning movei
,
bu as a silver screen major motion picture
, it ' s quite out of place
. stephen kessler ' s jejune direction doesn ' t help things either
. he only makes tjhe film even more tv
- movie
- ish
. earch consecutive
" vacation
" movie has suffered a drop in directing power
. we started tje sories off iwth harold ramis
, who also directed caddyshack
and groundhog day as well as co
- writing ghostbusters
. not too bad
.
then we hadnt national lampoon ' s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling
, who would go on to direct the hits look who ' s talking
and clueless
, as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high
. lastly we had national lampoon ' s christmas vcation
, directed by jeremiah s
. chechik
, who went onthe to direct the charming benny
& joon
. kessler
, so far
, has one title under his belt
, the short film birch street gym
, which received an oscar nomination in 1992
. granted that this was his first attempt at a feature lenght film
, we cant allow for some amateurish quality
,
but instead we get a movie straight from the text book
- boring
, bland
,
and deeply unoriginal
. if you loved the
" vacaiton
" movies
,
and i nkow
* some
* of us did
, there still isn ' t anything here worth seeing
. if you loved them
, don ' t ruin your ogod impressions of thge series by indulging in thsi tradgic exemple of cinema ala carte
. if you never did like the series
, why teh need tothe confirm why
?
