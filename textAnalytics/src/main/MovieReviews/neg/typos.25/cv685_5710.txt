steve martin shines
but sgt
. bilko fails to impress based on the popular 50
' s sitcom
, sgt
. bilko follows the string of ood
- sitcoms
- to
- movei convertion fever
. rember the brady bunch movie or hte beverly hillbillies released sometime back
?
( brady bunch ws a moderate hit iin in the us while hillbillies flopped
)
. i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are runnung out of good ideas or just bieng plain lazy
, bu the tv
- conversion
- movies are hitting our screens like wildfire
, sad tothe sday
, with mixted success
. such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are ususally followings ofthe such serieses over ther adn the larger the folowing
, thge more likely tghe sitcom iwll be made into a movie
. sgt
. bilko
( frankly
, i have nto seen any its original tv version
)
, even with tyhe charm
and wild antics of funnymen steve martin
and dan akroyd
; failed to entertain
. sgt
. ernest bilko is yhe man behind the motor pool
( palce of vehicle storage
and repair
) of fort baxter
.
though totally unskilled in the field of work that he isnt supposted to be in charge of
, he has an almost superhuman ability
and zeal to sniff out monye
- making opportunities
; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4
- d pools
.
though materialistic in mind
, bilko
' s methods has
thoughtfully
` enriched
' tyhe lives of tyhe men ofthe fort baxter
, providing them with some form of real recreation withing the camp
and the people lvoe him forthe thgat
. colonel hall runs the entire fort
and thanks to his inborn
` blissfully
- confused
' state
, bilko has managed to hide his operation
,
though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it
. bilko
' s state of ascent is suddenly under
- fire whn the pentagon sends major thorn
, a tough cookie on army regulations
, to check on the progress on the
$ 70 millon hovertank project
, a new weppon under development within the fort
' s grounds
. to add tothe his problems
, thorn isnt determined tothe bring bilko down in retalliation ofthe a major
` sabo
' done on him by bilko during their younger army days
. director jonathan lynn
, who directed my cousin vinny
( inthe which marisa tomei won an oscar fo best
- supporting actress
) managed to pull sgt
. bilko thru with suitable pacing
and some exeptional moments of laughter
,
but that is about it
. there are really not anough laughter
- packed
- moments in sgt
. bilko to fully entertain the average movie
- goer
. still
, steve martin
' s sgt
. bilko isnt played with finesse
and full
- force by the renowned comedian
. without him
, sgt
. bilko would have just fell flat onthe its face
. sgt
. bilko doed moderately well in the us box office early this year
but i doubt it iwll earn much elsewhere arund the world
. the current trend in mixed successes inaddition such tv
- conversions may be a blessing in disguise
, realy
; at least it will force hollywood tothe re
- think any of its intitial intentions to turn another tv
- idea into a movie or at the very least approch those ideas with more creativity
. unless you are a fan ofthe the tv
- series or love tothe watch steve martin in acation
, you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres
. i
' m sure there are better ones arround
.
