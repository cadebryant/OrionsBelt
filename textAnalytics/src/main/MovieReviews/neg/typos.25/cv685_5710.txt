steve martin shines
but sgt
. bilko fails to imbaress based on the popular 50 ' s sitcom
, sgt
. bilko follows the string of ood
- sitcoms
- tothe
- movie conversion fever
. remember the brady bunch movei or tghe beverly hillbillies released sometime back
?
( brady bunch ws a moderate hitted in in the us hwile hillbillies flopped
)
. i do not really know whether hte hollywood minds are running out ofthe good ideas or just being plain lazy
,
bu tje tv
- conversion
- movies are hitting our screens like wildfire
, sad to say
, wih mixed success
. such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since tehy are usually followings of such series over there
and the larger the following
, the omre likely tghe sitcom will be made inot a movie
. sgt
. bilko
( frankly
, i have not seen any its orginial tv version
)
, even with tyhe charm
and wild antics of funnymen steve martin
anbd dan akroyd
; failed tothe entertain
. sgt
. ernest bilko is the man behind thte motor pool
( place ofthe vehicle storage
and repair
) of fort baxter
.
though totally unskilled in the field ofthe work tyhat he is supposed to be in charge of
, he has an almsot superhuman ability
and zeal tothe sniff outloud moeny
- makeing opportunities
; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4
- d pools
.
though materialistic in mind
, bilko ' s methods has thoughtfully
` enriched ' thte lives of the men of fort baxter
, providing them with some form of rela recreation within the camp
and tghe people loev him for that
. colonel hall runs the entire fort
anbd thanks to his inborn
` blissfully
- confused ' state
, bilko has managed to hide his operation
,
though nearly eveyr living person in the fort knows about it
. bilko ' s state of ascent is suddenly under
- fire when the pentagon sends major thorn
, a tough cookie on army regulations
, to check on the progress onthe the
$ 70 milion hovertank project
, a new weppon under developemet within the fort ' s grounds
. tothe add to his problems
, thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major
` sabo ' done on him by bilko during theri younger army dyas
. director jonathan lynn
, who directed my cousin vinny
( iin which marisa tomei won an oscar fo best
- supporting actress
) managed tothe pul sgt
. bilko through with suitable pacing
and some exeptional moments of laughter
,
bu that is about it
. htere are really not enough laughter
- packed
- moments inwhich sgt
. bilko to fully entertain thge average movie
- goer
. still
, steve martin ' s sgt
. bilko is played with finesse
annd full
- force by the renowned comedian
. without him
, sgt
. bilko would haev jstu fell flat on its face
. sgt
. bilko did moderately well iin the us box office early this year
but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world
. the current trend inwhich mixed successes in such tv
- conversions may be a blessing in disguise
, raelly
; at least it will force hollywood to re
- tihkn any of its initial intentions to turn another tv
- diea into a movei or at the very least approach those ideas withthe moreso creativity
. unless yuo are a fan ofthe the tv
- series or love to watch steve martin in action
, you can skip this one whn deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres
. i ' m sure there are better ones around
.
