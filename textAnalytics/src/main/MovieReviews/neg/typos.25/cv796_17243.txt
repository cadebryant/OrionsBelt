wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling onthe you
. yuo cxan see its plot developing from a mile awya
. you are lured into its benign story of a single 29
- year
- old girl looking for a soul mate in boston
, as tath city is depicted as a mini
- wonderland for singles
. this isnt a star oriented film
,
and the star who carries the film is erin
( hope davis
)
. that htis isnt a dating film
, about singles who for reasons of fate or luck
, or whatnot
, have not had a succsessfull match
and are nowe putting most of their energy into fulfilling thier careers
, is nothing newyorker
, this tipe of film has been done oftenly
and better many times in contemporary films
. the fictionalized documentry unmade beds did it mroe provocatively
and with more of a sence of urgency than this film
. the main quirk in the plot here
, is that hope ' s pushy mother
( hollan
) visits her in boston
, sees her daughter ' s live
- in relatiopnship with a radical protester
( hoffman
) breakup
and decides to put a personal ad inwhich thte newspaper for her harvard medical skool drop
- out daugter
, who works as a nurse
. this is done without her knowledge
. it is cornball sitcom stuff
,
but
, at least
, it is handled as best it could be by the actors
annd director
. it is eazy to like erin
, she is bright
, careing
,
anbd attractively blonde
. it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with
, the financially strapped
, ruggedly handsome
, intelligent 35
- eyar
- ood alan
( alan
)
, who noone longer wants to work with his father as a plumber
but is doing volunteer wrok at the aquarium
and attending college to be a marine biologist
. of course
, he comes acros as bieng so ogod
(
though
, he does kill some fish in the aquarium
)
, that it isnt hard to believe he ' s for rela
, or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for
. hte contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as
, the subway
, at a restaurant
, or onthe thge phone
. alan ' s brother answers erin ' s ad with a few of his pals
, as tehy each try to respond tothe her ad infact a phony way
, makeing a bet that the first who gets to tounge kiss her
, that tje others witness
, will win thge bet
. this sub
- plot wass as obnoxious tothe see take place as it is to hear told
. that we have to see erin go through several dates tothe prove the point how ego sick these guys are
, each one more annoying than the other
, culminating inaddition the most obnoxious noe of all
, that brazilian lover
( jose
)
, who is about as charming as a snake
- oil salesman
, who isnt actually the oney she nearly flies away with for a hoilday inwhich brazil
, was not onyl incredulous
but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was hte heart of the storey
. anyway
, as expected
, all ' s well that ends well
, forthe thsi watchable piece of fluff
, that comes over onthe screen better than it does whn relating its story
- line
. teh dialogue was actully not bad
, those dating erin or trying to flirt wih her seemed to be uttering authentic thigsn htey would actually say infact their situation
.
and
, oh
, by the way
, wonderland refers to the stpo onthe the boston metro
, it is where greyhound racing tkaes place
.
