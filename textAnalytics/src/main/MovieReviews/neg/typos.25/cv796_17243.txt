,
and thte star who carries the film is erin
( hope davis
)
. that htis is a dating film
, about singles who forthe reasons of fate or luck
, or whatnot
, ahev not had a successful match
and are nowe puting most ofthe their energy into fulfilling their careers
, isnt nothing new
, this tipe of film has been done often
and better many times in contemporary films
. the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively
and with more of a sence of urgency than this film
. the main quirk inaddition the plot here
, is thast hope
' s pushy mother
( hollan
) visits her in boston
, sees her duaghter
' s live
- in relationship with a radical protester
( hoffman
) breakup

. it is cornball sitcom stuff
,
but

, as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way
, making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her
, that yhe others wittness
, wiull win the bet
. thsi sub
- plot wass as obnoxious to see take place as it isnt to hear told
. that we hvae to see erin go through several dates tothe prove the point how ego sick these guys are
, each one more annoying thna the other
, culminating in tje most obnoxious oney of all
, that brasillian lover
( jose
)
, who isnt baout as charming as a snake
- oil salesman
, who isnt actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday inaddition brazil
, was nto only incredulous bu downright contrary to the rich presentation ofthe her character that was the heart of the story
. anyway
, as expected
, all
' s well that ends well
, fo this watchable peice of fluff
, thta comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story
- line
. the dialogue was actually not bad
, those dating erin or trying tothe flirt iwth her seemed tothe be uttering au
thentic things they woudl atcually say inthe their situation
.
and

, by tghe way
, wonderl
