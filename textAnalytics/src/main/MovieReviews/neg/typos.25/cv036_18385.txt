among multitude of erotic thrillers
, that had been released in the early 1990s
, woman of desire is interesting only baceause it was directed by robert ginty
, star of tjhe b
- grade action films of the previous decade
. thsoe who tend not tothe be nostalgic baout 1980s cin find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star
. as directer
, ginty did very little tothe improve that impression
. tje protagonit of the movie is jack
( played by jeff fahey
)
, yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford
( palyed by bo derek
)
.
however
, she has relatiopnship with rich
and powerful jonathan ashby
( steven bauer
)
. one stormy night
, the tragedy occurs
and jack is accused of rape anbd murder
. howver
, his ogod firend walter j
. hill
( robert mitchum
) happens tothe be very ogod lawyer
, so jack might even prove his innocence in the end
. belonging omre to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller
, woman ofthe desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all charactors behaving like total idiots
. unfortunately
, this film isn
' t comedy adn any laugh is unintentional
. the characters are totally antipathetic annd irritating
and soon we stpo caring what would happen tothe them
. the actors that play them don
' t help either
. that is especially the case with jeff fahey
, whose jack is so stupid that even the charachter played by fahey in lawnmower man looks liek a genius inwhich comparison
. his partner bo derek
, onthe the other h
and
, shows that she didn
' t age enought to cease being thge sex godess
,
but that isnt small compensantion for her appraent lack of acting talents
. ginty
, onthe the other h
and
, tries to bring soem life in the movie by using many flashbacks
and strange angles ofthe shooting
, bu in hte end it gets only irritating to the laready borde
and dissatisfied viewer
.
