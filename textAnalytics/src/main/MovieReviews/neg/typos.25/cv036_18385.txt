among multitude of erotic thrillers
, that had been released in the early 1990s
, woman ofthe desire is intresting onyl beacuse it was directed by robert ginty
, star of yhe b
- grade action films of the previvous decade
. those who tend nto to be nostalgic baout 1980s cant find very good reason in the tipe of movies that made ginty the star
. as director
, ginty did veyr little tothe improve that impression
. tjhe protagonist ofthe teh movie is jack
( played by jeff fahey
)
, yatch skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford
( played by bo derek
)
.
however
, she has relationship wtih rich
and powerful jonathan ashby
( steven bauer
)
. noe stormy night
, the tragedy occurs
and jack is acccused ofthe rape
and murder
.
however
, his good firend walter j
. hill
( robert mitchum
) happens tothe be very ogod lawyer
, so jack might even prove his innosense in the end
. belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller
, woman of desire distinguishes itself from similair films by having allmost all characters behaving liek total idiots
. unfortunately
, thsi film isn ' t comedy
anbd any laugh isnt unintentional
. the cahracters are totally antipathetic
and irritating
and soon we stop careing what woudl happen to them
. the actors thgat play them don ' t help either
. taht isnt especially the case with jeff fahey
, whose jack is so stupid that even tyhe character plyed by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison
. his partner bo derek
, on yhe otehr hand
, shows thgat she didn ' t age enough to cease being the sex godess
,
but that isnt small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents
. ginty
, on the other hand
, tries tothe bring some life in tje movei by using many flashbacks
and stange angles of shooting
,
bu in the end it gets only irritating to hte already bored
and dissatisfied viewer
.
