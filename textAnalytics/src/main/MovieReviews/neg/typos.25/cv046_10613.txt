' s other

and shifted the release date by nearly a yera
.
but
, to paraphrase the bard
, swill
, by any other name
, owudl smell as rank
. no number of name changes cin help htis picture
. it
' s not just about a disaster
, it is a disaster
. hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute
. the best shot occurs during the oppening credits
, as the camera pans over the streets
and byways of huntingburg
, indiana as thte water levle slowy rises
. tghe community
, protected by an overworked dam
, isnt bieng evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud
- choked skies

, it
' s all downhill
. whatever inital enteratinment value hte film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point
. it takes forever to git to the end credits
-
- this is one ofthe the longest
- seeming 95
- minute motion pictures i have recently endured
. basicly
, hard rain is one extended
, dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot
- outs
. there
' s a lot ofthe water
, broken glass
, gunfire
,
and explosions
. it
' s all very routine
and uninteresting because there aren
' t any real charactors
and the plot only occasionally makes sence
. the film
' s conclusion isnt so preposterous that it
' s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers deside tothe resolve the myraid subplots that are floating aroud
. acation films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion
. graham yost

and hard rain

, neither he

( a far off place
)
, applies it
. thge acation in hard rain grows tedious through repetion
. we see the same kinds ofthe things
-
- speedboat chases
, flood damage
, shoot
- outs
, etc
.
-
- over
and over again
. the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad tyhe running time outloud tothe an acceptable movei length
. the storyline gives us a number ofthe paper
- thin characters inwhich contrived circumstances
. there
' s toom
( christian slater
)
, the noe

. he
and his partner

)
, git stuck onthe a street that
' s rapidly turning inot a river
. a group of men
, led by jimmy

but as robbers

, who are on h

and the easily
- corrupted sherif
( r
andy quaid
)
, whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives
. there isn
' t any real acting in this film
. christian slater utters a few lame one
- liners
and doesnt a lot of mugging for the camera
. toom is easily noe of tje most lifeless characters the actor has brang tothe the screen
. r
andy quaid sneers a lot
, annd is totally unconvincing
. morgan freeman
and minnie driver both attempt to give ligitamate performances
, bu tehy are defeated by tje script
. freeman
, one of the best cinematic thespians wokring todya
, looks suitably embarrassed to be here
, bu i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time

. following in the wake of twister
, this isnt
yet another natural diaster movie tht doesn
' t trust nature
' s fury as the cheif engine of conflict
. as a result
, we are saddled wih an idiotic good guys
/ bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had
. titanic proved that there can be a wealth ofthe drama in a movie where everyting goes under water
. hard rain successfully demonstrates that the oposite is equally possible
. thus far this year
, hollywood has already subjected us to its unique br
and of moronic mayhem by fier
( firestorm
)
and water
( hard rain
)
. fortunatly
, ther are only two elements left
