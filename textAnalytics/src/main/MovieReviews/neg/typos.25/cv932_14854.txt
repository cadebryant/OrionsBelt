? what happened to our dreams
? with the new millennim
, our colelctive big birthday
, just aroud the corner
, smoe people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with thier existence
. the old st
andbys of traditionnal religon
and science aren
' t doign it for many anymore adn they
' re looking forthe something eles
. we
' ll be seeing more
and more films with a mataphysical theme over the next fewd years
. ricky hayman
( jeff goldblum
) is having a career crisis
. the programming director for the ogod buy home shopping network
, he
' s going to be fired unless sales increse dramatically

, they almost run down newyorker age pilgrim
" g
"
( murphy
)
. g w
anders onto the televsion set
and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don
' t really want all that commercial crap
. in some unexplained manner
, htis causes sales to sour
. ricky is saved
. the movie tries to be too much at once
and fails at it all
. it
' s nto an over
- tje
- top comedy or a heart
- warming message ofthe humanity
. it
_ is
_ a mish
- mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialouge
. i am willing to put up with preaching from a film
, bu the messages here are old hat
. ytou should tkae time tothe smell thte roses
. selling your soul forthe cash is a bad idea
. golly
. i
' m glad i saw the movie
. i never would have
thought ofthe these
. the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed
. wehn g takes a chainsaw to the set
, there
' s an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious
. it doesn
' t happen
. the bits are so subdued anbd overly
- long that there
' s only a hint ofthe laughter from the audience
. murphy has changed his roles in recent yeasr adn not fo the better
. there are hints of promise in tihs one
. teh onyl time the film picks up even a little isnt wehn his shaved
- headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up onthe screen
. the others are horrendous
. goldblum hasnt episodes ofthe brilliance in his career
,
but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his
" invasion of tje body snatchers
"
. his relationship with kate makes no sense
. htey move from antagonism to love somwhere off screen
. preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be
. somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is baout ten minutes of value
. an attempt to satirize stupid television
, we git a self
- parody instead
.
