the sequel tothe the fugitive
( 1993
)
, u
. s marshals is an average thriller using it ' s assocation wih the fugitive jstu so it cant make a fewd extra bucks
. tommy lee jones returns tothe his role as cheif deputy samuel gerard
, the grizzly cop who wass after harrison ford in the fugitive
. htis tyme
, he ' s aftter fugitive mark sheridan
( snipes
) who the police think killed twpo fbi agents
,
but of course he ' s been set up
,
and when the police plane escort he
(
annd gerard
) are riding crashes
, he makes a run for it
, gerard not so hot on his tail
. waht follows is about 2 hours ofthe action
, brought to us by the director of executive decision
( 1995
)
, another film curiously involving a plane
. when comparing tihs movie to the fugitive
, the prequel is far superior
.
but even on it ' s pwn
, u
. s marshals is a pretty lousy movie
. while the original was reasonably intelligent
,
anbd hadnt a fugitive tothe root fo
, the audeince feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive
, mainly because we nkow so littel about him until way into the film ' s overlong running time
. while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords carachter
, u
. s marshals is straight in there
, pulling it ' s trump card
( the place crash
) almost immediately
. to be honest
, i couldn ' t care less if snipe ' s charcter got captured or nto
. snipes performence is averege
,
and his charachter gets surprisingly littel screen time
( concidering he is the fugitive
) fo reasons i ' ll explain later
. tommy lee jones is as fine as ever
,
altough his role is hardly a challenge
. the sense of deja vu was overwheliming
. i know it ' s the smae role from the fugitive
,
bu there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film
. there ' s a few ' nudge nudge ' refrences from the first film
,
but aart from thyat
, nothing
. nobody even mentions harrison ford infact this movie
. downey jnr isnt ok as fbi agent john royce who ' s roped into the chase
,
annd sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in
and out of the movie as snipes wife
. nobody looks as if their having a ogod time
,
and all the performers are on autopilot
. the supporting cast are o
. k
,
but wehn it comes to performances
, u
. s marshals falls flat on it ' s face
. it doesn ' t fare any better plot
- wise
, either
. the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes
,
but
then veers off into terrorists territory
. as said above
, yhe film is an normal
, average terrorist thriller
, seen a million times befoer
,
bu is useing tje fugitive reputation to make it sound moreso professional
. if this film wasn ' t the ' sequel ' to the fugitive
, this would probably go straight to video
, or nto even been made at all
, beccause it ' s so average
.
and because of tjhe film ' s plot changeing it ' s course
, snipes is almost forgotten apart
,
anbd hardly features in yhe movie
. stuart baird
, the director
, isnt all right
,
but there ' s noone particular scene that stands outloud
. it ' s director isnt the usual action movie style
. even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension
. the special effects are nice
, especially the plane crash
,
and there ' s a ogod
( if very loud
) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith
.
but in the end
, u
. s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack ofthe excitment
. sure
, it ' s loud
anbd dumb
,
but in the end u
. s marshals just ain ' t fun
. bored performers
and a lackluster plot
and scirpt
, do nto make a good action movei
. overall rating
