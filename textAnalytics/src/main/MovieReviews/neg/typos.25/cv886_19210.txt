i am continually amazed at movies like thsi
. thgat some producer would waste an abundance of talent
and money on a scirpt as abysmal as this one is mind
- boggeling
,
but it seems to happen a lot nowadays
.
" wild wild west
" isnt a beautifully filmed
, well acted
,
and well directed piece of garbage
; anbd its insipid screenplay is completely at fault
. in short
, this movie is a comedy without laughs
. so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal
. the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco
, bu it
' s still preety boring
. will smith stars as jim west
, an old western
, r
& b veriasion of the james bond character
. west is teamed up with artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, annd they
' re preety much polar oppisites
: west prefers to solve his problems with an array ofthe bullets
, gordon tradtionally favors a more pacifistic aproach
. talk about deeply developed characters
. at any rate
, thsi leads tothe the inevitable conflicts between methodologies
, none ofthe wich are funny
. the year is 1869
. several top scientists have beeen abducted
,
and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate genaral
, bloodbath mcgrath
( ted levine
)
. president grant sends west anbd gordon tothe investigate
. htere
' s evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion inthe louisiana
. west
and gordon show up
and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, another disgruntled former confederate
. as it turns outloud
, loveless plans tothe use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon
, which he iwll use to conquer thte united states
. i
' d go further with the plot
,
but there isn
' t any point
. this film
' s narrative is littel omre thna a jumbled
, unfunny mess
. i onyl laughed at a couple of jokes
,
and
then only lightly
. there isn
' t oney truly uprorously funny moment in this film
,
and that
' s pretty disasterous wehn you consider that it
' s primarily a comedy
. as i said
, the fault is totally that of the scirpt
. when you consider their respective roles
, will smith anbd kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done
. tje leads coudl
' ve been played samuel l
. jackson
and robert de niro
and the film still owudl
' ve been awful
. no one
,
and i mean no one
, can make a line like
" bye bye
, mr
. knife guy
!
" sound good
. still
, htis film has a lot goign forthe it visually
. tghe set design isnt fantastic
, mabye even oscar worthy
. thte cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus
( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese
' s briliant
" goodfellas
"
)
, is absolutely stunning
. he lends hte film a much needed exciting
, comic bookish look
. i won
' t fault barry sonnenfeld either
. he does a fine job of directing the proceedings
, bu
, like the rest of the peple involved with yhe film
, htere relaly isn
' t anything taht he can do to corect its one major flaw
. despite being beautifully made
,
" wild wild west
" becomes quite boring after tghe half
- way point
. the appeal ofthe the visuals ends long before the film does
. if
" wild wild west
" didn
' t look so good
, it would be almost insufferable
. as it is
, it
' s somewhat tolerable
,
but not very entertaining
. it hurts tothe give such a well made movei a score htis low
, bu htere isn
' t anything much worse than an unfunny comedy
.
