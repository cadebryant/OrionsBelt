i
' ve never written a review for a movie i haven
' t watched all the way through
,
but i hadnt to make an exception with powder
. i was about forty
- five minutes into this one at a friend
' s house when he
and his brother got into a huge shouting match thast would have ended in voilence had we not left the house
. so i never got to finish the movie
and i
' m sure as hell nto going to pay three more bucks tothe watch half ofthe a bad movie
. bu i cxan at least get a partial review out ofthe it
, because i saw enough to know this one wasn
' t worth finishing inthe the firt place
. the movie centers around a freaky teenager who
' s spent his entire life living in the cellar ofthe his gr
andparents
' house
. when gr
andpa dies
( taking his deparment store down with him
)
, social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder
( first
and middle names
? gold bond
) to a state home
, where we find outloud he
' s a different fomr the other kids
. acutally
, we find outloud he
' s different when we firt see him
, because he
' s the most pale individual we
' ve ever seen
and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever
. whn powder isnt born in the oppening minutes of thte movie
, the father takes one look at him
and says
" he
' s not my son
.
" obviously
. all i want tothe know is where the pillsbury dough boy wass nine months ago
. so the white
- faced freak leaves his neverl
and ranch fo tjhe state home
and faces the redicule of other kids
. that is
, until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him
" wear
" his spoon
(
" you can either mear it on your nose or up your ass
.
" decisions
, decisions
.
.
.
) adn he uses telepathic powers to draw all tjhe silverware in the room into a giant pile in hte middle of the table
. so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy
, his mother must be sissy spacek
' s carrie character
.
and you have to factor in twpo more thigns from the subsequent scenes
, as we find out pewder hasnt some sort ofthe super
- intelligence
(
" your i
. q
. tust went straight off teh chart
!
"
)
and attracts electrical power
. tihs firt shows up as powder visits tje world ofthe high school
( if he
' s such a genius already
, why would he ened a high school education
?
) anbd sits through a demostration in jeff goldblum
' s science clas
. goldblum plugs infront a
" jacob
' s ladder
" device that shows current running up two wires annd immediately the current flows across the room
and into pewder
' s chest
.
but goldblum just st
ands there for about thirty seconds watching
, instade ofthe just unplugging the damn thing
. i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing inwhich his third bad movie in a row
( folowing hideaway adn nine months
)
. that
' s about all i saw befor the big fight began anbd
, let me tell you
, that was twice as interesting as yhe movie itself
.
but liek i said
, i saw enough to know thsi would be oen of thsoe terrable melodramas about the isolation ofthe people who hvae superior abilities adn how hard it isnt for those peopel to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization
. none of these movies ever h
andle the subject properly
, instead introducing thge feeble beauty
and the biast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in lvoe with the guy
' s personality
, overlooking his peronal appearance
. i already hadnt teh female chracter picked outloud
( the girl who wass sitting enxt to him inthe the back of the room during tje electrocution scene
)
,
but i guess i
' ll never nkow for sure what happened
