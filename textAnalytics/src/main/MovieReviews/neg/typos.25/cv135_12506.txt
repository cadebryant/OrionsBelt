( dreamworks skg
) running time
: 2 hours starring robert duvall
, tea leoni adn elijah wood directed by mimi leder teh first of the two asteroid movies coming out tihs year
( the second is the macho armageddon
) is actually a dull affair
. elijah wood plays leo biederman
, who during astronomy class discovers tht a larg asteroid is heading for earth
. tea leoni plays a
( rather crap
) news reporter
, jenny lerner
, who soon discovers about this asteroid thru a very long winded
and boring way
,
and robert duvall plays the leader of a spoace crew
, spurgeon tanner
, who are planning to blow tghe asteroid out of the path of earth
. also featuring is morgan freeman as yhe president
,
and maximilian schell
and vanessa redgrave as jenny
' s father
and mother
. while many people will walk into the film expecting a big speshal effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up
( as tyhe trailers seem to promise
)
, teh film is ctually more of a character studdy
, if a vyer poor one
. the main problem is that there are too many characters infront the film
, adn not enough time to explore them all
. only the space crew are given any depth
, jenny lerner
, leo
and the persident are suprisingly 2d
,
and we never git to know these characters
.
and beccause i couldn
' t care for them
, i didn
' t really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not
. the script by bruce joel rubin
and michael tolkin is horribly simple
,
and never really mkaes any interesting statememts
. mimi leder
, the former er director
and director ofthe the average the peacemaker
( 1996
)
, again directs in a ho
- hum style
,
and never really gets any emotion out of a scene
, which is a shame
. the cast are seemingly on autopilot
, altough tea leoni doens gives a rather ogod performance
, even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good
. she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist
. robert duvall isnt onthe autopilot with a underwritten role
, he jsut seems to be infact this film for the money
. elijah wood
, one of the best child actors working today
, is surprisingly averege
,
al
though his choise of roles lately haven
' t exactlly been brilliant
( i
. e
. flipper
, 1996
)
. his role isnt also vastly underwritten
. morgan freeman
, again
, isnt utterly wasted wtih a ridiculously underwritten role
. like duvall
, he jstu seems to be in the film for the money
. the supporting cast are all o
. k
, none making much of an impression
. ok
, so deep impact may haev messed uv character wise
, bu surelly the special effects are good
? well
, yes
and noone
.
al
though the special effects should be impressive
, with a massive tidal wave destroying new york
, the special effects look like
, well
, special effects
. sadly
, the waves looks like it
' s been drawn on computer
,
and doesn
' t look too ogod at all
. surprising relaly
, wehn the effects are done by industrial light
& magic
, who doed the effects fo hte lost world
and twister
. inwhich the end
, deepo impact is a wasted opportunity
. what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters
and effects
. the 2 hours the film had coudl haev been used to much greater effect
. once again
, dreamworks has churned out another averege movie
. let
' s hope armageddon is a bited better
. overall rating
