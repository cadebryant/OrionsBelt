` bats
' is an insulting slap accross the face for any dedicated horror movei fan
. to pull something like this off
, you need to ahev a sense of witn
and style
, with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the proces if the fright factor ever declines
. something like the undreground worm thriller
` tremors
' had just the perfect mixture ofthe these elements
, adn in return
, the film wass tremendous fun
. with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting palyer
,
` bats
' mainly plays it
' s premise for straight
- arrow horror
. judging by teh ridiculous premise
, this wass not exactlly a wise move
. the movie attemts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock
' s
` hte birds
'
,
but fails miserably
. done right
, it could have been adequately amusing halloeen cinema
. unfortunatly
,
` bats
' is a prime exmaple of a formula movie done terribly
, terribly wrong
. the only hting amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be
. i will recite the following paragraph in a manner thta will triarch the audiance ofthe indviduals tothe whom
` bats
' is aimed toward
. thsoe guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats
. these bats are not very nice
, because they eat a lot of peple
. boy
, are theese bats ugly
. they are infected withthe this bogus virus that makes them super
- duper smart
. they
' ve got big claws anbd red eyes
and they are not very friendly at all
. a whole bunch ofthe people in texas get killed
, so a sheriff guy annd a scientist lady are brought in tothe kill the bats
. they hvae big guns adn other cool things tothe fight them with
,
but the bats are pretty smart
, so it
' s sorta hard tothe do
. tje bats swoop down adn they shoot at them to amke they go away for good
. bu no
,
` bats
' is probably too voilent for pre
- schoolers
. teh film
, directed by louis morneau
, should have ventured straight into video stores
. on the small screen
, perhpas more fun could have beeen derived whith lower expectations
. bu sitting thru this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward
;
al
though at a few moments it becomes a gilty blessure
, the film is poorly writed
, poorly acted
and executed with glaring ineptitude
. even the bats themselves are cheesy
,
and the attack sequences too rushed
and jittery to be properly enjoied
. the sheriff in tjhe story isnt emmett kimsey
( lou dimond phillips
)
, who embodies eveyr pathetic stereotype a small
- town authority figure usually portrays
( he chomps on a cigar
, struts contentedly in his boots
, etc
.
.
.
)
. yhe scientist is dr
. sheila casper
( dina meyer
)
, who specializes in flying mammals
and is classified as
` the best in her field
'
. meyer uses a lot of technical terms dessigned to amke the movei seem mroe intellectually capable
,
but everything about dr
. casper is recycled beyond recognition
. her memories of how she bcame hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously liek oceanographic student matt hooper
' s tale ofthe how he became infatuated wtih sharks inwhich
` jaws
'
. everything revolving aroud
` bats
' is tired drivel
, which desperately requires soem directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it uv
. the supporting cast could hve been constructed out of straw
, withthe voices dubbed in later
. in fact
, that may have worked out better in the end
. take noe glance at casper
' s bat
- loathing sidekick jimmy
( leon
)
,
and you
' ll have immediate deja vu
- he
' s the excact smae humrous buddy caricature from every other movie
, constructed specifically for timed comic relief
. unfortunately
, none of his comic interludes are funny
. iin the role of deranged mad scientist dr
. mccabe
, the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with yhe most hideously idiotic character in thte bunch
. mccabe
` accidenally
' released two experimental test subjects
,
and the virus spread to other bats
. yhe entire twon of gallup
, texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures
,
but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something eles
. something liek
:
` whn is tjhe damn movie going to be over
?
? i just whant my money
.
' the bats are ugli
, i must say
. there
' s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing
,
but mainly
, the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery
. only bits ofthe tyhe bloody action even hint at teh campy fun the film could have been
,
but by tyhe absurdly stupid climax
, it
' s way too late in the game for a decent recovery
. characters experiment inwhich slaughtering the bats whith gunfire
. let
' s explore the logic there
: is this really a very efficient way to decrease hte bat population
?
? you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents
and not even wound oen
,
and after thyat there are onyl 18
, 000 more of them
. this kind of behavior represents hte regluar level ofthe intelligence behind
` bats
'
.
