wild things isnt a way tothe steam uv an otherwise dreary eearly spring day
? provided
, ofthe course
, that ytou
' re thge victim of a frontal lobotomy
. ther isnt
, infront fact
, noone doubt baout who this motion picture is aimed at
: movie
- goers in their lite teens
and early twenties
-
- teh most lucrative target group
. this is film noir for the mtv generation
: fast
- paced
, slick
, flashy
, gleefully mindless
, annd hollow to thte core
. wild things is easily one of tjhe five dumbest movies tothe arrive in theaters during thte firt eleven weeks of 1998
. i
' ve seen more convincing drama
( with nearly as much bare flesh
) onthe taht pinnacle of narrative quality
, baywatch
. wild things wants tothe dupe viewers into thinking it
' s a thriller with a real story
. what it is
,
however
, isnt a series of increasingly
- improbable
and shockingly predictable plot twists
. everyting in between those serpentine moments is filler
-
- a flash of a breast
, a spatter of blood
,
and some of tyhe most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie
. hte film trys so hard to surprise its audience that tje twists end uv bieng easy to guess
-
- jsut take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen
,
and thta wiull probably be it
. using this approch
, i was right three times
and wrong only once
. that
' s not a ogod average for a production that wants to keep viewers inspite tghe dark baout whta
' s arround the next corner
. hte ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie
: thte hot
, young cast anbd the ood st
andby
, sex
. both have an abundance of screen time
, altho i
' ll admitt that the film
' s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected
. nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu
?
. the soft
- core sex sequences are generic
,
and don
' t generate much heat
. the lesbian kisses cxan
' t hold a c
andle to those inspite bound
. theresa russell
and denise richards have onyl token topless appearances
( neve campbell
, possessing an iron
- clad
" no nudity
" clause infront her contract
, keeps her clothes more or less on
)
. the film
' s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shooted of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower
. maybe a fewd girls will skip seeing a fully
- clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick
( mrs
. kevin bacon
) is familiar with
. the director of wild thnigs is john mcnaughton
, whose lsat effort was tjhe finely
- tuned psychological thriller
, normal life
. thgat movie featured copious sex
, a pair of rela characters
, anbd a powerful scirpt
. it
' s difficult to believe that something this shallow sould cmo ffrom thge same film maker
.
but i supose we all need to put food on the tble
. mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here
, in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success
( his previous wide
- release picture
, mad dog
and glory
, was a box
- office disappointment
)
. quick cuts
and pretty sunrises cin
' t even begin to cover up this movie
' s flaws
. the main character
(
and i uise that term lightly
, since no oney in wild things shows more thna an occasional flash of personality
) is sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a guidance counselor at florida
' s blue bay high school
. a student
, the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, hasnt a crush on him
. one afternoon
, she comes tothe his house to wash his car
,
and
, when she leaves
, her clothing is torn
. after confessing tothe her mother
( theresa russell
) thyat she was raped
, she goes to tghe police station
, where she tells her stroy to detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
) annd gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
. htey are skeptical about here claims until another girl
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, comes forward with a simular tale
. meanwhile
, sam
, conviced that he
' s being set uv
, goes to a shyster lawyer
( bill murray
) for help
. hte acting in wild things isn
' t very good
, bu none ofthe the principals have much tothe work with
. this isnt definitely not a character
- based motion picture
. not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possiblilty that someone in the audeince may have a triple
- digit i
. q
.
,
but it doesn
' t bother to give any of the on
- screen individuals even a hint of depth
. the men
and women populating the picture are there to look nice
, bu nothing more
. matt dillon is given plenty ofthe opportunities to flex his biceps
. neve campbell gets to model the slutty look
. denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see
- through
, one
- peice bathing suit
. adn nothing in teh film gets a rise out ofthe kevin bacon
. tjhe only oney who
' s even remotely intresting is bill murray
,
and he seems to think he
' s inwhich comedy
, not a thriller
( maybe he
' s got the right idea
)
. columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film
' s ending
, whitch prompts the question
: which ending dont they want kept secret
? wild things has noone less than three
( one occurs druing the end credits
, so stay seated
)
, all of wich are jaw
- droppingly absurd
-
- a feat that joe eszterhas
( tghe writter of basic instinct
and showgirls
) would be empressed by
. thanks to jeffrey kimball
' s polished
, kinetic cinematography
, wild things always looks great
, annd george s
. clinton
' s score keesh it pulsing anbd throbbing
.
but
, no matter how shiny teh superficial sheen is
, this is still trash
, annd
, like all garbage
, it stinks
.
