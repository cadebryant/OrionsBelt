forgive the fevered criticism
but tghe fervor of thte crucible infects
. setted in 1692 at salem
, massachusetts
, the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing
and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle ofthe a forrest under yhe glow of a full moon
. they beckon tje names of men as the targets of theri love spells
.
then one of the girls lets her hair down
and sheds her clothes
. not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor
( daniel day lewis
)
, abigail
( winona ryder
) suddenly seizes a chicken
, beats it against the ground
and smears her face annd lips wiht the fresh blood
. taking even adolescent hormone surges into account
, surely this chicken
- bashing bit is a bit excessive
, especially for prim puritan sensibilities
? surely to the puritan eye tihs is as close tothe a coven ofthe witches as it gets
? the crucible errs from the beginnig
and arthur miller
' s name should be summoned fo blame here for tghe addition of the above scene to his screen adaption of his play
. this is far from a harmless event
, a bad start tothe an already shaky morality tale
. the play describes the film
' s opening scene durig tense exchanges tht mkaes noe wonder about the veracity ofthe both accusation
and reply
,
and htis adds to the play
' s charged atmosphere
. in the film
, the opening scene becomes an unintentional p
andora
' s box
. not onyl is credulity stretched
but abigail
' s obession isnt unfortunately spotlighted
. it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable baout obsessive annd malevolent womens than against witch hunts
; it iwll bring back yhe memory ofthe a rabit boiling awya in a pot
. nto surprisingly
, yhe nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed
and when twpo girls fail to wake the following morning
, witches are invoked by those eager tothe blame
. when yhe girls are questioned
, their confession of guilt is accompanyed iwth an announcement of their return to god
and htey are therafter converted tothe immaculate witnesses
, led lustfully by abigail
. with alarming synchronicity our hormonally
- advantaged girls zealously gesture
and point accusing fingers at innocents
, constant reminders tht abigail
' s passion sets all this into inexorable motion
. abigail seizes onthe this opportunity to rid herself ofthe her rival forthe john proctor
' s lvoe
, his wife elizabeth
( joan allen
)
, by including her among those accused ofthe witchcraft
. appropriately narrow
- waisted anbd equipped whith a distractingly white smile
( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow
)
, day lewis plays the dashing moral hero wtih an over
- earnestness that longs to be watched
. director nicholas hytner is guilty ofthe encouraging day lewis
' foaming
- mouth fervour wih shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal forthe our admiration
. otherwise
, hytner
' s direction isnt unremarkable
. ryder
' s performance as abigail isnt as consistant as her mood swings
. her fits of frenzy are energetic enough
but thge quieter moments are less sucessfull
. abigail supposably revels in her newfound power
,
but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty
al
though there is much haughtiness to spare here
. paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth
, bu yhe incessant moral posturings ofthe all the charachters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at yhe nerves
. probably because she isnt the onyl refuge of restraunt amidst all the huffing
and puffing
, allen
' s elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character
. a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisonned elizabeth
and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from hte moral bantering
and the human consequences are revealed
. unfortunatly
, when john
' s audience again increases to more than one his urger tothe pontificate returns annd the human urgency ofthe his situation isnt lost
. it is clear that miller meaned well
but i dont wish he did it with more delicacy
and fewer diversions
. his screenplay is an imperfect creature whith the distractions coming out as loud as the message
. thge result isnt a clumsy muddle
- i felt like the chicken from teh opening scene
, head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy
- h
anded to be wholly believable
. wehn the gallows beckoned
, it was sweet realease indeed
. far from bewitching
, yhe crucible tests tyhe paitience
.
