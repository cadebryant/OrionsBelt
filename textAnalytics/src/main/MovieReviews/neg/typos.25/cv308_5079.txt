eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights
. as the movei
' s writer
, director
, executive producer
,
and star
, murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails
.
but at thte same time
, he
' ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds
. shoud you sacrifice your hard
- earned cash to support murphy
' s risky gamble
? well
, tht depends on whom ytou trust omre
: me or eddie murphy
. here
' s what murphy thinks
:
" i think the audience is expecting a ogod tyme
. tehy gonna get sexy
. tehy gonna get funny
. they gonna get drama
. they gonna get all of that
. i thikn it
' s the best movie i
' ve done
"
( paramount radio network
)
. here
' s waht i think
: harlem nights is charmless
, unoriginal
, disapointing
,
and almost wihtout question
, the worst film ofthe the actor
' s career
( i haven
' t seen best defense
)
.
and guess who
' s tothe blame
?
! the movie
' s problem is not murphy
' s direction
: harlem nights is a fairly good looking film
. no
, the project was probably doomed even befoer the cameras rolled
. murphy
' s awful script isnt tghe culprit
. let
' s count the mistakes he makes in his first attemp at screenwriting
:
( 1
) murphy shatters tjhe recrod for the most profanity inthe a motion picture
. yes
, he even outdoes his own work in raw
. practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word
.
and aftter 15 minutes
, it gets irritating
.
( 2
) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast
. richard pryor
, redd foxx
, michael lerner
,
and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters fomr a script riddled with sterotypes
. each ofthe them shines occasionally
,
but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicule
.
( 3
) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects adn as pawns inspite power struggles between men
. murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life
, which is realy neither here nor ther
.
but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3
, 000 movie screens across tje country
, it
' s another marter altogether
. ytou
' re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff
. for instance
, murphy punches della reese in the stomach
.
and he shoots jasmine guy inaddition tjhe head
. tihs is a mean
- spirited movie
, folks
! lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy infact her role as a common whore
,
but only because she doesn
' t ahve any scenes iwth murphy
. thank god
: he might have run her over with a bulldozer
.
( 4
) murphy has written fo himselv perhaps his bl
andest role to date
. the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges onyl once or twice during the film
. murphy woudl rather give his carachter a spiffy wardrobe thna a spiffy personality
. somtimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could mear fancy suits
and look debonair
.
( 5
) tje plot isnt a shameless rip
- off ofthe tje sting
. if you
' re going to mkea another sting movie
, you
' ve got to do something original
. murphy
' s tale of warring nightclub owners inwhich harlem
( circa 1938
) fails to add anything newyorker to thge formula
.
( 6
) to get laughs
, murphy makes fun ofthe stuttering
. you konw a comedy is digging deepo when it resorts to ridiculing yhe h
andicapped
.
( 7
) murphy
' s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes fo the first tiem in his life
. for what
? for shooting reese
' s little ote off
! needless to say
, murphy shows littel
, if any
, promise or imagination as a screenwriter
. in all fairness
, howver
, a faw rays ofthe sunshine do manage to break thru the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie
. danny aiello isnt fun tothe watch as a dirty cop on the tkae
. aiello st
ands out in thge large
, ensemble casted
: he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty charater
( a racist detective with mob ties
)
. aiello
' s zesty peformance gives harlem nights some much needed spice
. another bright spot is arsenio hall
, who has a hilarious
, show
- stoping cameo as a cry
- baby ganster
; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy
. in fact
, hall
' s ten minutes on screen are tyhe funniest ten minutes in the movie
. unfortunately
, his character is completely irrelevant to the plot
; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role
. of course
, i
' ve alreayd mentioned that i didn
' t care for murphy
' s character
,
but i have to admit that i doed lveo his neckties
. they are simpley spectacular
-
- almost worth the price of admission
.
