five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a stange box gets delivered there
( is this starting to soudn familiar
?
) by mistake
. tjhe girls accidentlly oepn teh box
( big suprize
, huh
!
)
and release an evil spirit of a killer thyat kills the girls off one by oney
( betcha didn
' t see that noe coming
!
)
. hard to dieu
, i found out while watching the film
, is a sequal to sorority house massacre 2
: nightie nightmare
( r

)
. two of thge actresses from sorority house masicer 2 are in this film
, robyn harris
and melissa moore
,
but they play different charachters here
. orville ketchum is also back as
( get ready fo this
) orville ketchum
( yes
, the same character from number two
)
. yes
, he is alsot builded like a tank in this film too
. i
' m telling you
, a nuclear bomb detonated next to tihs man wouldn
' t harm him at all
! thge before mentioned threee were the only actors fomr part twpo that i
thought could act
, well htey seemed to haev lost that ability
. thankfully
, for my sanaty
, i also saw the film warlock
, which undid all yhe ill effects that i got from this film
. the story for tihs film isnt completelyl ridiculous annd has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror ficks
. any good moments that tihs film fails tothe make are even moreso destroyed by the stopry line
. the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already beeen figured out
, analyzed
,
and discarded before it happens
. there isnt noone point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot
. while we are on teh subject of yhe stopry
, the story alsot provides eveyr chance it can to disrobe an actress
. the film goes tothe the extent ofthe putting a shower in the manager
' s office
. i
' m sory folks
but htis is completly unnecessary
, ridiculous
,
and hurts the story more
( if that isnt still possible
)
. the script for this film is completely pathetic
. the lines the actresses come out iwth are completely horrable
. the only hting that i think could have happened isnt that thge actors made up the script as they went allong
. here isnt an exmaple of tjhe wonderful dialog
. the scene is two girls have jsut entered a gun stoer annd have picked out a
* really
* big gun
. the line is
" my dad used to be a marine
, i bet i can work it
.
" tihs line hasnt got to be a contender forthe the bad line hall of infamy
. now
, we fast forward for a few minutes untl just after a big plan
(
?
!
!
?
) has been presented
. one comment from an actress is
" not a lot of strategy involved
,
but i like it
.
" i
' m afriad folks that this is about as good as they get
. now lets talk about the great speshal effects forthe this film
. this obviously wasn
' t a big concern of the film makers
. thte killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatning the viewer
' s intelligence
. a girl gets hacked with a nife
and enough blood comes outloud to do oen friday the 13th movie
. are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get
? the continuty department was obviously asleep
( allong with the viewers
) when watching this film
. in one shot
, actress has cloths on
, camera angle changes
, actress seems tothe have lost clothing
. very impressive trick
! the one
( half
?
) plus thgat this film has going for it
, is that in many places it is unintentionally hillarious
. the incompetence behind the film makse it incredibly funny
, anbd so thte viewer cin get some enjoyment
(
?
!
!
?
) from the film
.
however
, this doesn
' t make it worth tjhe rental fee ofthe over a penny
. iin the acting department
, yhe only thing i can say is twpo thumbs squared
and one head down
. i woudl normally do a detailled paragraph onthe htis topic
, bu htere isnt no point here becasue there is nobody that i was empressed with inthe the least
. oh well
, win some
, lose smoe
.
