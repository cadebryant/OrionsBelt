five girls spend a day in a closed building donig inventory when a strange box gets delivered there
( is htis starting to sound familiar
?
) by mistake
. the girls accidentlly open the box
( big surprise
, huh
!
)
and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one
( betcha didn ' t see that oney coming
!
)
. hard tothe die
, i found out while watching the film
, is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2
: nightie nightmare
( r

. twpo of the actresses ffrom sorority house masicer 2 are in this film
, robyn harris
adn melissa moore
,
bu they play different characters here
. orville ketchum isnt also back as
( get ready for this
) orville ketchum
( yes
, the same character from number two
)
. yes
, he is also builded like a tank in this film too
. i ' m telling yuo
, a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn ' t harm him at all
! teh before mentioned three were the only actors from part two thast i throught sould act
, well they seemed tothe have lost that ability
. thankfully
, fo my sanity
, i also saw the film warlock
, which undid all tjhe ill effects that i got from tihs film
. the story for tihs film is completely ridiculous
and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks
. any good moments that htis film fails to make are even omre destroyed by the story line
. the film is so pathetically predicatble that every moment has already been figured out
, analyzed
,
and discarded before it happens
. there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot
. while we are on the subject ofthe the story
, the story also provides eveyr chance it can to disrobe an actress
. the film goes to the extent ofthe putting a shower in the manager ' s office
. i ' m sorry folks
but htis is completely unnecesary
, ridiculous
,
adn hurts the stopry more
( if that is still possible
)
. the script for htis film is completely pathetic
. thte lines the actresses come outloud withthe are completely horrible
. the only thing that i think could hve happened is that hte actors made up the script as they went along
. here is an example ofthe hte wonderful dialog
. the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store
and have picked out a
* really
* big gun
. the line is
" my dad utilizied to be a marine
, i bet i can work it
.
" this line hasnt got to be a contender for the bad line hall ofthe infamy
. now
, we fast foward for a few minutes until just after a big plan
(
?
!
!
?
) has beeen presented
. one comment ffrom an actress isnt
" nto a lot of strategy involved
,
but i like it
.
" i ' m afriad folks that this is baout as ogod as they get
. nowe lets talk about yhe great special effects forthe tihs film
. this obviously wasn ' t a big consern of the film makers
. the killing scenes are so obviously faked tyhat they go to tje point of threatning the viewer ' s intelligence
. a girl gets hacked with a knife
annd enough blood comes outloud tothe do one friday the 13th movei
. are we trying tothe see how unrealistic we cin get
? the continuity department was obviously asleep
( allong with tje viewers
) when watching this film
. in one shot
, actress hasnt cloths on
, camera angle changes
, actress seems to have lost clothing
. very impressive trick
! the oen
( half
?
) plus that tihs film has gogin for it
, is that in many places it is unintentionally hillarious
. the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny
,
adn so the viewer can get some enjoyment
(
?
!
!
?
) from hte film
.
however
, this doesn ' t make it worth the rental fee ofthe over a penny
. in the acting department
, the onyl thnig i can say is twpo thumbs squared
and noe head down
. i would normaly do a detailed paragraph onthe this topic
,
but there isnt no point here because there isnt nobody that i was impressed with in the least
. oh well
, win some
, loose some
.
