' s a love it or hite it film
. i simpley hated it
. on its menu forthe fun
, is a violent feast served up as charm
and done in a tounge
- adn
- cheek manner
. it
' s a serial killer
/ horror film farce of nonstop over
- yhe
- top action anbd sleaze
, involving decapitations
, vampires
, biker fights
, extended gun play
, annd an array of gore that hasnt tothe be seen to be believed
. a film that regales in its vulgarity
and campiness forthe blood
- annd
- gore
, as it goes out of its way tothe gloss over the clich
? s of yhe conventional b
- films
. it
' s geared only for hte cult film crowd
,
and will make its mark there one way or the other
. tje plot involves two psychopath brothers
, the older professional bank robber
and killer seth gecko
( clooney
)
and hte perverted psychopath killer
, richie
( tarantino
)
, who kills forthe pleasure
and is also a rapist
. tehy escape jail
and go on a killing spree in wichita annd thn flee tothe a liquor store in a small texas border town
. htey ahev jstu robbed a bank
and killed a number of cops
, they have aslo taken a middle
- aged bank teller as a hostage
. in the liquor sotre they kill a texas ranger adn the store clerk
,
and burn down thge stroe
. stopping off inthe a flop
- house motel
, richie rapes
and slaughters the hostage
. these scenes are all done whith an eye fo comedy annd parody
, if that
' s possible
. on the tv news
, it says they hvae killed 16 so far annd most are texas rangers
. the brothers plan tothe get to mexico
and meet carlos
( cheech
)
, who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take
. wtih road blocks
and car searches at the border
, the brothers comm
andeer a motor home ofthe a vacationing family who stopped at theri motel so that the father coudl sleep in a real bed
. there is the father
, jacob fuller
( keitel
)
, who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident
; his sexy 20
- year
- old
, innocent daughter
, kate
( lewis
)
; adn
, her shy brother scott
( liu
)
. it
' s nto explained how he happens to be chinese
. the story really becomes bizarre when they git across tyhe border
and get ready to meet carlos in a bar
/ whorehouse forthe truckers
and bikers called the titty twister
. the place is open from dawn to dusk
, thus thge film
' s title
. here
' s where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window
and have some absurd fun
, as tghe place turns out to be a vampire hangout
. it sells sex to its patrons
,
and has exotic stripper santanico p
andemonium
( hayek
) do her alluring strip befor turning into a vampire
. teh brothers
and their hostages have to fight their way outloud of the palce
, as tghe vampires keep coming
and the killings become the film
' s staple
. this supposedly clever script doed nothing
but turn me off
,
though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects
and spent most of its script inspite finding novel ways tothe showcase its killings
. i
' ll take a pass onthe this one
, it
' s just nto my style of a film
. teh characters were as empty as thge story
,
and the film wass an easy one to forget
.
