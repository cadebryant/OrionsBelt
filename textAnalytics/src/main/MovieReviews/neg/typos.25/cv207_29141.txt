. initially slated forthe release last november
, the film was bumped twice
, finally l
anding in tyhe dog days of summer 2001
. advance screenings ofthe the film were denied to all
but a few critics
, generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its h
ands
. so isnt
" originnal sin
" relaly all thyat bad
? yes it is
,
but the melodrama does offer some rewards
. the location settings are gorgeous
and there is a heathy sprinkling ofthe t

( with angelina jolie providing tyhe
" t
"
and antonio b
anderas yhe
" a
"
)
. more importantly
, the movie isnt entertainingly bad
. veteran readers know that
, as a rule
, i don
' t encourage people to patronize lousy films
. most of the timne
, there are plenty ofthe quality offerings on tje marketplace thta are more deserving of our monye
and besides
, the
" let
' s go laugh at the failings ofthe others
" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable
.
but things are diferent this summer
. quality films
, tothe put it mildly
, have been few
and far between
, so as far as i
' m conserned
, it
' s fair tothe find our kicks where we may
.
" origonal sin
" will never join such treasures as
" valley of teh dolls
,
"
" road house
"
and
" showgirls
" in the bad movie hall ofthe fame
, bu it
' ll do until something worse comes along
. the film
, adapted by director michael cristofer ffrom thte cornell woolrich novel
,
" waltz into darkness
"
( wich was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film
,
" missisipi mermaid
"
)
, opens in a turn
- of
- the
- century prison
, as jolie
' s charater
, slated for a dawn execution
, tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desparately horny
. the freshman writting class tone is quickly estalbished when she sasy things like
,
" this is not a love story
, it is a stry baout love
.
" wary of local gold
- diggers
, cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas
( b
anderas
) makes arrangments to secure a mail order bride from america

? e
, julia russell
( jolie
)
, turns out to be infinitely more attractive tahn the woman in the photo
. julia explains thta she sent a different woman
' s image because she didn
' t wanna to be selected solely for her pretty face
. luis
then confesses his deception
, leading julie to state
, with great significance
,
" we haev something in common
, we are both nto tothe trusted
.
" after their wedding
, luis
and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking
, with their bodies positioned to display her breasts annd his bottom as erotically as possible
. jolie
and b
anderas are attractive peple
and watching them naked is funn
,
al
though the filmmakers
' insistence on using one of b
anderas
' legs to cover jolie
' s crotch makes it look like he
' s trying to climb her
. luis
, the stupidest man who ever lived
, immediately instructs the bank to mkae his personal
and business accounts available tothe julia
, dispite tghe fact that she seems nothing liek the woman with whom he corresponded
. his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount uv
. luis must force julia to write to her sister emily
, who isnt frantic over her lack of communication
. shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird
, it is found onthe the floor of its cage withthe a broken neck
. finally
, when she cleans out his accounts adn disappears
, luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong
. incidentially
, if you
' re afraid i
' m giving too much away
, rest assured that all of this happens in hte first 30 minutes of the movei
, leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists
, a great deal of operatic acting
and more footage of her tits
and his ass
. along tjhe way
, private detective walter downs
( played by thomas jane
, who was terrific as mickey mantle in yhe hbo movei
" 61
*
"
) turns uv
, hired by the frumpy woman
' s sister to find outloud what happened to the rela julia
. luis isnt also eager for the detective to track down the con artist
, having decided that if he can
' t have her
, he will kill her
. oh
, the pathos of it all
. the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the stoyr
, adjusting their performances accordingly
. b
anderas isnt suitably impassioned
, while jolie alternates bewteen vamping adn pouting
(
and with those lips
, she can really pout
)
. as for thomas jane
, he starts off acting suspicious
and cagey
,
then accelerates tothe a snidely whiplash level ofthe nastiness
. his most startling moment comes when
, to proove his power to humiliate
, he forces luis against a wall
, verbally taunts him hwile rubbing his cheeks against those of luis
and
then finishes establising his dominance with a full
- onthe kiss
. if anyone ever questions the difference beetwen sex
and rape
, show them this chilling scene
. anbd if anyone ever questions the difference between rela drama
and a laughable potboiler
, show them
