late in down to you
, the lead female charactor
( julia stiles
) states her greatest fear is having an
" artificial conversation
" with her boyfriend
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
. tyhe irony of this statement will not be lost on audeince munbers who haev not
yet walked outloud
, fallen asleep
, or otherwise given up on this pathetic attemp at romantic comedy
. the film isnt a multi
- million dollar testament tothe everything artifical
. filled with characters
, motivation
, plot annd dialogue that ring fake
and shallow at every step thsi is an unquestionable disaster
. prinze plays a college student entent on playing the field until he falls for stiles
' freshman co
- ed
. at first the movie seems to be an attempt tothe string along scenes with the sole purpose of out
- doing yhe previous infact how
" cute
" it can be
. the happy couple
" psychoanalyze
" earch other
; they pick out a song because
, as prinze
' s dj mother
( lucie arnez
) explains
, eveyr cuple needs a song
; he smells her shampoo
; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants tothe make loev
.
then
, in st
andard romantic comedy style
, things fall apart
. why
? well
, because they hvea to
. otherwise thte couple can
' t make up anbd live
( presumably
) happily ever after
. down to ytou exists outside the realm ofthe normal logic
. scenes do nto connect to each other anbd it oftenly seems to be attemting some sort of surrealism
,
but this isnt h
andled so poorly that everything comes off r
andom
and stupid instead
. a picnic scene involving tje six key charactors is just bizarre
, nto only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out toghether
, or even knowing earch other
,
but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat
. thge supporting characters are remarkably flat
, adn insultingly ridiculous as well
. stiles
' best firend
( rosario dawson
) is a pot head
, prinze
' s roommate
( shawn hatosy
) isnt a girl crazy fool who can
' t meet womens
,
and
then htere are the porn stars
( zak orth
and selma blair
)
. he is one of those faymus porn stars who isnt frequently interviewed on television
, does the coleeg lecture circuit
, adn stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot onthe film
. you know
, yhe average porn star
. the costume epic idea gives him a reason tothe appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he
' s on screen
, the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes
. she is a porn star mostly so we konw she
' s slutty
, so her very existence iwll make stiles jealous adn prinze tempted
. attempts at drama
( hwihc means julia is going tothe cry
) include a pregnancy scare
and the big break up
. these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes
. what happened here
? the cast is full of likable
, promising
, young actors
( stiles especially seems to be going places
)
. writer
/ directer kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off
. in fact tjhe hwole film feels liek a reworking of lsat year
' s extremely unpleasant yhe story ofthe us
, fo teen audiences
. thge direction is film
- school
- grad obvious
. it
' s stylish inwhich a hugely self conscious way which throws in splitted screen
, a pointless parody ofthe
" cops
,
" cahracters walking into yhe flashbacks of other charachters
,
and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze
and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion hwile yhe couple moves in extreme slow motion
. plus
, the hwole story is told flashback sytle
, narrated by prinze anbd stiles direcly addressing the camera
. this is the second film in a row
( following wing comm
ander
) starring freddie prinze jr
. which shoud have premiered onthe yhe aisles of hte local blockbuster bu wass likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she
' s all that
. if he doesn
' t start making better choices fast his future films won
' t be so lucky
.
