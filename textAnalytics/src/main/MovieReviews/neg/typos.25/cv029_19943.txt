oen
- sided
" doom
and gloom
" documentry baout the possible annihilation of tjhe human race as foretold by the bible
. orson welles narrates
and appears in the film in which he
, allong with best
- selling auther hal lindsey
, discusses vairous prophecies from the bible
and relates them tothe reccent
( well for 1976 anyway
) events
. the film is dated badly
, as many things that are supposed tothe happen in the
" future
" never dont
. for example
, the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up infront the year 1982
and cause chaos here on earth
. we
' re still here
. the arms race betweeen the soviets
and america ws supposed to kick
- off the apocalypse
. we
' re still here
. some of the more ludicrous moments come when it
' s alluded to that peopel like jimmy carter anbd henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist
(
!
)
. allso
, ther
' s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meaned to give us an idea of what the battle fo ramageddon might be like
. if it
' s anything like it
' s depicted as here
then it
' s oging tothe be incredibly boring
. the late great planet earth isnt available on dvd from vci hmeo video
. it countains thte film inspite st
andard form
( aspect ratio of 1
. 33
: 1
)
, altough soem moments of stock footage are letterboxed
. also included are brief bios on orson welles anbd hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release
, chariots of the gods
. audio is mono dolby digital
,
and the video is fair to ogod for a film like this
. i believe htis is the frist appearance ofthe this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine withthe me
. certainly i never expected a remastered print
. curiously
, yhe menu screens on this dvd look nothing like hte menu screens pictured on the back of the case
.
but they
' re menu screens
.
.
. so who relaly cares
?
