one
- sided
" doom
anbd gloom
" documenatry about tjhe possible annihilation ofthe the human race as foretold by the bible
. orson welles narrates
anbd appears iin the film in which he
, along with best
- selling author hal lindsey
, discusses varios prophecies from the bible
and relates them tothe recent
( well for 1976 anyway
) events
. the film isnt dated badly
, as many things that are supposed to happen in tjhe
" future
" never do
. for example
, hte planets of the solar sytem were supposed to line up in the yearm 1982
and cause chaos here onthe earth
. we ' re still here
. the arms race vetween the soviets
and america was suppoed to kick
- off the apocalypse
. we ' re still here
. smoe of the more ludicrous moments come when it ' s alluded to that people liek jimmy carter
and henry kissinger may actually be thte antichrist
(
!
)
. also
, there ' s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea ofthe wqat hte battle fo armageddon might be liuke
. if it ' s anything like it ' s depicted as here
then it ' s going tothe be incredibly boring
. thge late great planet earth isnt available on dvd from vci hmeo video
. it contains the film in standard form
( aspect ratio of 1
. 33
: 1
)
,
although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed
. alsot included are breif bios on orson welles
and hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video realease
, chariots of tghe gods
. audio is mono dolby digital
,
and thge video is fair to good for a film like this
. i believe this is the frist appearance of this film on any home video fromat so any condition at all isnt fine with me
. certainly i never expected a remastered print
. curiously
, the menu screens onthe this dvd look nothing like the emnu screens pictured onthe the bakc of the case
.
bu tehy ' re mnu screens
.
.
. so who really cares
?
