, hot of tghe heels of entrapment
( 6
. 5
/ 10
)
and zorro
. a big remake of the haunting
.
and big special effects
. so what do they all ammount to
? unfortunately for us

, spooky mension for contolled testing
. unbeknownst tothe the patients
, the good doctor is actually conducting his pwn cover project that has to dont wtih the psychology of fear
. critique
: tihs movie jstu didn
' t scare me noe bit
. sure
, it creeped
and spooked me outloud a littel here
and there
,
but onthe the whole
, it took waaaaay too long to get going
, provded very little meat in the plot
, went way past its pwn bedtime
,
and basically relied onthe grunts
, the muttering of children
' s voices anbd over
- the
- top spacial effects
, to scare us
. well
, this film didn
' t do much for me
.
and they might as well ahev called it the
" haunting ofthe lily taylor
"
, since she
' s basically the only character who had any real depth
, background or reason to be in tghe hous in yhe first place
. don
' t git me wrong
, catherine zeta was sweet window dressing
( despite my contined preception of her faint mustache
- see entrapment
)
,
and owen wilson was good as the st
andard
" comic relief
"
, bu come on people
, if you
' re going to have us sit through twpo hours in a theater witht these folks
, how
' bout giving them a little omre than one
- liners as dimension
. neeson was also wasted as thte smart
, british guy
. it
' s all too sad
, cause certainly the
" idae
" seemed like a good one
( see the shineing
( 9
/ 10
) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry
)
,
but thge story was thin
, thge conclusion ws laughable
( be gone
.
.
. poof
!
)
and the special effects
? well
, they sure were nice to look at
,
but not for a moent doed one ofthe them scare
, or even fo a split
- second
, have me believe that they weere anything moreso than hollywood special gadgetry
. see it for zeta
- jones
, or if you liek special effects adn skary movies that take forever to get going
, annd provide very littel payback
, otherwise skip it
and check outloud the original or tje ulitmate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld
, the shineing
