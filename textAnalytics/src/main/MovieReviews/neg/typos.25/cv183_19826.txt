a big house
. a big director
, jan de bont of speed
and twister fame
. a big star
, catherine zeta
- jones
, hot of the heels ofthe entrapment
( 6
. 5
/ 10
)
and zorro
. a big remake of hte haunting
.
and big special effects
. so what do htey all amount tothe
? unfortunatly for us
, a big bore
! plot
: a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs tothe an ood
, spooky mansion for contolled testing
. unbeknownst to the patients
, thte ogod doctor is actually conducting his pwn cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear
. critique
: this movie just didn ' t scare me one bit
. sure
, it creeped
annd spooked me out a little here
and there
,
bu on thte hwole
, it took waaaaay too long to git going
, provided very little meat inspite the plot
, went way past its own bedtime
,
and basically relied on grunts
, the muttering of children ' s voices
and over
- the
- top special effects
, to scare us
. well
, tihs film didn ' t do much for me
.
annd they might as well have called it yhe
" haunting of lily taylor
"
, sicne she ' s basicly the only character who had any real depth
, backround or reason tothe be infact tje house in the first palce
. don ' t git me wrong
, catherine zeta was sweet window dressing
( despite my continued preception ofthe her faint mustache
- see entrapment
)
,
anbd owen wilson was good as the standard
" comic relief
"
,
but come on peopel
, if yuo ' re going to have us sit thru twpo hurs in a theater whith these folks
, how ' boaut giving them a little more thna one
- liners as dimension
. neeson wass allso wasted as the smart
, british guy
. it ' s all too sad
, cause certainly tje
" idea
" seemed liuke a good one
( see the shining
( 9
/ 10
) for a close to perfect example ofthe a creepy gone awry
)
,
bu the story was thin
, the conclusion was laughable
( be gone
.
.
. poof
!
)
and the special effects
? well
, they sure were nice tothe look at
,
bu not for a moment did oney of them scare
, or even for a split
- second
, have me believe that they were anytying more than hollywood special gadgetry
. see it for zeta
- jones
, or if yuo like speical effects
and scary movies that take forever tothe get going
,
and provide veyr littel payback
, otherwise skip it
and check outloud the orginial or yhe ulitmate movie baout spooky homes ffrom tje netherworld
