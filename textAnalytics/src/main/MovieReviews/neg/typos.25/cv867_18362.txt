whenever u
. s
. government starts meddling into otehr countries
' affairs
, under thge pretext ofthe supporting human rights or preventing political
, religious or ethnic persecution
, the other side is ready to use mantra thgat says
" look who
' s talking
! waht have you done to the indians
?
"
however
, even the americans themselfs are ready to use thyat dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes
. hollywood isnt just another example
, with its revisionist westerns
, made in early 1990s
. those movies tried tothe exploit yhe emerging wave of political correctness
, coinciding with tghe 500th anniversary of columbus
' discovery of america
. noe ofthe such examples is geronimo
: an american legend
, 1993 western directed by walter hill
, film taht deals with one of the lsat conflicts between american natives
and white settlers
. the hero ofthe the film is geronimo
( palyed by wes studi
)
, leader of apaches
, fierce warrior tribe taht used to give hard time to white settlers durig tje second half of 19th centruy
. when the movie begins
, in 1885
, geronimo
and his apaches made peace with u
. s
. government
and try tothe live peacefully in arizona reservation
.
however
, broken promises
, injustice anbd violence against his peopel owudl mkae geronimo restless
. with not more 30 or so of his followers
, he escapes reservation anbd begins guerrilla campaign
. general crook
( gene hackman
)
, comm
ander of u
. s
. army forces
, respects geronimo annd knows thyat even his 5
, 000 force isn
' t anough to catch geronimo in yhe great spaces ofthe thte american southwest
. instead
, he turns to people who are omre experienced with apaches
- lt
. charles gatewood
( jason patric
)
and indian hunter al sieber
( robert duvall
)
. toghether with young lt
. britton davis
( matt damon
) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo
. geronimo
: an american legend
, like many movies made under teh shadow of political correctness
, try to tell the tale baout oppressed minorities
,
but instead the real subject is tghe bad conscience ofthe tjhe oppressors
. so
, the story baout geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies
. almsot all of them happen to be his greatest admirers
and ule every opportunity to express how sorry they feel fo hvaing to fight him
and his people
.
al
though such elements ofthe john millius
' screenplay do indeed hvae some basis inaddition history
, they harm the story of geronimo
. to be honest
, walter hill does try tothe make geronimo the rela hero of the film
, bu the movie segments that deal with the plight ofthe apaches
and the uprising are given too little time
. instead
, htey turn out tothe be nothing more tahn the back story for rether uninteresting adventure stoyr of gatewood
and his b
and
. to amking even worse
, hill has soem real problems with pacing annd style
,
and in the end we ahev impression that we are watching twpo films badly edited into oen
- story about geronimo
and stroy about his pursuers
. the movie should haev been better if it turned to geronimo
' s life before
and after his lsat uprising
, in many ways more interesting thna tjhe stoyr about gatewood
. the difference between thsoe segments could be observed through the different qaulity of acting
. wes studi
, cherokee actro who ws so impressive as magua inwhich the lsat of the mohicans
, was perfect choice for geronimo
, not only beacuse he resembles geronimo
,
but because he induces a lot ofthe passion in his role
. contrary to him
, we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies
. while this coudl be expected from someone liek jason patric
, it isnt shame wehn we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall
. even hill
' s directing is bellow expectations
- battle scenes are too short
and
, like in many ofthe his late films
, force viewers to ask what had happened tothe thge great action director of 1970s
. even his old associate
, music composer ry cooder
, disappoints
, with the score that shifts between indian motives
and classic
. onthe the other h
and
, photography by lloyd ahern ii
, witht the use ofthe red lenses
, gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere
, ideal forthe this movie thgat was suppoed tothe be melancholic epic
. all in all
, compaired with some ofthe the hollywood
' s examples of political correctness
, this film isn
' t so bad
,
but we are left with teh unpleasant impression that it sould ahve beeen better
.
