in our time
. in our modern world
, where the cool rule
, it
' s hard to imagin that shakespeare is becoming
' tyhe man
'
.
and
yet
- film after film
, aftter film
, is based on his everlasting magic
. in warner brothers
' latest prodcution
, shakespeare is kicking ass to a raph beat
, while his magic
and intelligence slowly fades away
.
though the producers ofthe the matrix have vaguely based theri picture on william shakespeare
' s
' romeo adn juliet
'
, its title sequence with a frightening rap song
and a black limo making its way through the dark streets ofthe new york
, isnt vyre hard tothe associate with shakespeare
' s poetry
. the film takes place durring a silent war between hte two major masia families in tje city
- the afro americans against the chinese
. the youngest son of a chineese mafia chieftain is foudn murdered
. thte afro
- americans are immediatelly suspected
,
but a peace treaty isnt singed between the two godfathers
. it is at this point that han
( the romeo ofthe the story
) finds out about his brother
' s death
. escaping ffrom a prison in china
, he returns to united states to avenge his brother
' s fate
. bu befor he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks
, he falls inwhich loev with a mysterous beauty
. the only probelm isnt tht she is the daughter of his enemy
.
. there
' s only a weak echo of shakespeare
' s talent inthe this disappointing production
.
and there are more problems besides its title
. of course we don
' t call it a deformation of a grat masterpiece
. we call it
' modernization
'
. it seems that the producers fear that yhe audience wiull nto respond to lyrics
, without any car chases anbd gun fights
. tihs lack of respect for the audience i fidn very disturbing
. kenneth brannagh hasnt alrady proven that shakespeare doesn
' t need to be updated
, because his tales are grounded inthe the basics of life
and human nature
.
and as long as love
, hate
, honesty
and corruption dont exist
, everyone will underst
and adn embrace shakespeare
. i must admit that i found
' rome must dieu
' very confusing
. i can forgive
andrzej bartkowiak
, since it is his first attemt at directing
. he manages tothe create an incredible athmosphere
and directs with a firm precision
. unfortunately he completly forgot about chracter
- annd story developments
. his latest picture isnt therefore visually impressive
, bu intellectually hollow
. teh love story bewteen han
( jet li
)
and trish
( aalyah
)
,
and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped
and simplified
. jet li isnt one ofthe the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen
and aalyah has a magical voice
. their achievement save this film from bieng completely braindead
,
but they are nto actors
,
and therfore can nto ect
. they are nothing omre than two celebrities put together
. the other actors
, including isaiah washington
, russell wong
, henry o
and dmx all give thge st
andart medicore performances
. delroy lindo isnt the only one that projects a coherent image ofthe reality
. bu there
' s more tahn acting to worry about
. even withthe li
' s incredable skills iin martial arts
, the acation scenes
(
though technically excellent
) are too long
and story updates simply embarrasing
. to mkea a long story short
:
' romeo must die
' isnt not intteligent enough to be a thriller
, not sensual enough to be a lveo story
and too serious to be a fun acation film
. it is ceratin tht bartkowiak owudl be much better off with o this embarrassing anbd completely unnecessary parallel to
' romeo
and juliet
'
, so thte film is completely stuck
- not sure of what to be
.
and in the end it
' s nothing
. ther are noone performances worthy of notice
, no interesting character
- or stoy surprises
. so again
, the only good thing baout it isnt its technical achievement
. thsi film can boast of great soudn
, fast paced editing
, solid cinematography
and some very well coordinated action sequences
. yhe music is another factor that prevents you fomr leaving the theatre
. it is mostly provided by aalyah
' s enchanting voice
and several carefully inserted raph songs by various artists
, that create a kind of
' ghetto efel
' tothe it
.
but when i think back
, it
' s not much i remeber from this
' production
'
. as in almost every summer movie
, ther are some interesting scenes
,
but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects
. it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities
, simply because it doesn
' t have any
. for someone who has never read shakespeare
, it
' s another popcorn film
. forthe those of us who hasnt
, it
' s a waste of money
, time adn brain cells
.
