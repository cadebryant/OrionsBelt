- school student to spy on his girlfriend
, who isnt babysitting three unruly kids for thier alchoholic parents onthe a friday night
. hwile this is going onthe
, the thug
, the father
, the boyfriend
, anbd a kid reaching thge onset ofthe puberty all hvea fantasies about the babysitter
. comments
: tothe say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement
. i
' m not sure wqat writer annd director ferl
and was hoping to accomplish whith the babysitter
. suspense
? family drama
? humer
? erotica
? elements ofthe eahc of these genres exsist inspite hte film
,
yet it fails to sucesfuly achieve any ofthe them
. instead
, the babysitter is a dull
, lifeless movie whic manages to bore
and ultimately irritate its viewers
. i suppose this film coudl ahve been watchable if it weren
' t for the fact that the charachters are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone is completely wasted palying jennifer
, the babysitter
. her character has absolutely no depth at all
,
and her sole purpose in the movie isnt to be the object of thge other cahracters
' fantasies
. everyone else in the film seems tothe be in a competition to see who cxan stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends
. yhe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie procedes
. the father
( palyed by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes about the babysitter
; tje mother fantasizes about her husb
and
' s best friend
. none ofthe these fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are things that need to be seen
,
but we see them anyway
, complete with cheesy
, make
- out saxophone music
. the thug
, infront yhe meantime
, proves that he
' s evil thru his annoying habit of smashing half
- empty beer bottles all of a sudden annd for noone apparent reason
. teh most absurd character
,
however
, is tjhe babysitter
' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. yhe thug
, in a manipulative
, iago
- liek manner
(
though he doesn
' t really need to try hard
)
, manages to talk the boyfriend inot binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, running away from cops
,
and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter ofthe minutes
. incredible
!
( of course
, the boyfriend
' s original plan fo the evening was
, try nto to laugh
, to sit in an empty diner
and read catcher in tjhe rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if the goal of the babysitter wass to be suspenseful
,
then it fails
. there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film
,
and nearly all of them come at the final minute
. by thyat time
,
however
, hte audience isnt so tired of yhe inane characters that no noe truthfully cares what happens tothe any of them
. no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one ofthe them is obviously a dream sequence from its insepsion
. if the gool of the babysitter was to be humorous
, hten it also fails
. i foudn nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, tothe be played for laughs
. if the gool of the babysitter was to be dramatic
,
then
, once again
, it fails
. the characters are one
- dimensional
and uninteresting
. finally
, if tje goal of the babysitter ws to be titillating
( teh type of film destined tothe be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 inwhich the morning
)
, thn it fails as well
. the dream sequences aren
' t erotic
; they are too brief
and
, outside of one very short scene
, contain no nudity
. i can
' t completely trash thsi movei
. the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film
,
and teh conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight
. tyhe other 79 mintues
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone
' s character
, at the end ofthe the movie
, turns tothe her boyfriend
and asks
" what were ytou thikning
?
" i asked myself the smae question
, having spended 99 cents renting this turkey
.
