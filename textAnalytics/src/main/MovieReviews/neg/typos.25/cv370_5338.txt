upon first viewing ofthe this movie
, tghe phrases
" been there
"
and
" done that
" come quickly to mind
. spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films
, the most populare of whihc are airplane
and the naked gun series
. stealing stuff cant be profitable in this inudstry
,
bu only when you steal the right stuff
. waht littel plot there isnt involves dick steele
, aka
. agent wd
- 40
( leslie nielsen
) trying to save the world fomr an allmost deranged madman palyed by andy griffith
. allong the way to it gool
( goal
?
)
, the film manages tothe spoof mainly the james bond type films
,
but also manages tothe hit onthe films such as hmeo alone
and sister ect
. the trick baout spoofing is thgat you ahev tothe actually be funny
, or at the least
, satirical
. spy hard achieves neither
, as it borrows all ofthe hte wrong elements from hte superior zucker brothers films
. the
" dick
, the world is in danger
. wqat is it
? well
, it ' s a big roundish ball floating in spoace aroud the sun
.
.
( i ' m paraphrasing
)
" type ofthe exchange is used at least four times inaddition the opening ten mintues ofthe the film
, each tiome getting progressively less funny
. whta they should have stolen were tjhe background sight gags which weere so effective in the zucker brother ' s films hwile writing their own dialogue
. director rick friedberg focuses more on hte mug shots of his actors
( especially nielsen
, who cant do thsi quite well
) than on the delivery
and context ofthe thier lines
, much of the timne cutting the punchline short
. hte whole film seems to be inspite a race with itself to be over
, as is evident in the final sequence
, where htere is noone comedic denouement after tjhe climax
. as wass usual in the zucker brothers films
and infact spy hard
, the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context
. one of tje more amusing was
,
" captain of the enterprise
.
.
.
.
.
. james t
. kirk
"
. overall
, i thought this was a very weak effort
. while all of the right films tothe spoof were chosen
, they used none of tyhe right spoofing methods
. enxt tiome they should
" spy
" a little bit harder
