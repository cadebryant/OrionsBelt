these dyas
, we are witnessing teh deluge of films based on old
, cult tv shows
. most of the times
, the fans ofthe theese shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks ofthe the present dont with yhe memories ofthe their past
. bu
, some five or six eyars ago
, there weren
' t thgat many movies
and the trend didn
' t look that depressing
. so
, the peopel who
, like yhe autor of this review
, grew up watching flintstones
, popular 1960s animated series about
" modern stone age
" family
, weren
' t particularly worried when the word came about live action remake
. after all
, the producer behind the project was steven spielberg adn
, if anything eles
, at least tje special effects would be good
. the plot revolves about flintstones
, familiy set in fictious stone age
" town
" ofthe bedrock
, whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america
. fred flinstone
( john goodman
) works in the quarry
,
and one day he helps his best friend
and neighbour barney rubble
( rick moranis
) anbd his wief betty
( rosie o
' donnell
) to adopt a baby
. tothe return the favour
, barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred
,
and
, based onthe thta
, fred gets well
- paid job inwhich managment
.
but
, ofthe course
, this is just a sham
- corrupt official cliff v
andercave
( kyle maclachlan
)
and his sultry secretary sharon stone
( halle berry
) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme
. infact the meantime
, fred
' s wife wilma
( elizabeth perkins
) must face her mother
( elizabeth taylor
) who cxan
' t st
and fred
. onthe teh superficial level
, the flintstones doed tghe excellent job inthe bringing the animated serieses to life
. computer effects are flawless
,
and the costumes
, settings
and other details are au
thentic for all tje fans of the sohw
. unfortunately
, problems wih tihs film start with inadequate casting
- rick moranis isnt too thin fo the role ofthe barney
, while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier thna rosie o
' donnell
.
but the greatest problem of all is plot
, or tothe be precise
, the lack ofthe plot
. some thirty six screenwriters made sure that teh plot ofthe the film is lame
, originnal characters oen
- dimensional
, annd many elements of the tsory
, like embezzlement
and inter
- office politics
, totally incomprehensible for tghe little children
, the main targeted audience of tihs film
. result is almost unwatchable mess
, ocassionaly saved mostly by excellent acting
( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma
)
and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood desease known as
" high consept
"
. after great hype
, movie quickly sank into oblivion adn the fans of thte sohw retured to thte animated version
. all in all
, film isn
' t that bad
, bu onyl the hard core fans
and nostalgics can find moreso than guilty pleasure in it
.
