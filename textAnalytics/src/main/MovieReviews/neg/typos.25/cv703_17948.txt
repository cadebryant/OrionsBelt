theese dyas
, we are witnessing hte deluge of films based on ood
, cult tv shows
. most ofthe the times
, the fans of these shows shudder thinking what coudl hollywood hacks of the present dont with the memories of thier past
.
but
, soem five or six years ago
, there weren ' t that many movies
and tghe trend didn ' t look that depressing
. so
, the people who
, like the author ofthe tihs review
, grew up watching flintstones
, populer 1960s animated sories about
" modern stone age
" famaly
, weren ' t particularly worried when the word cameback about live acation remake
. affter all
, the producer behind thte project was steven spielberg
and
, if anything else
, at least tyhe special effects would be good
. the plot revolves baout flintstones
, family set in fictious stone age
" twon
" of bedrock
, whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle clas america
. fred flinstone
( john goodman
) works in teh quarry
,
and one day he helps his best freind
and neighbour barney rubble
( rick moranis
)
and his wife betty
( rosie o ' donnell
) to adopt a baby
. to return the favour
, barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred
,
and
, based onthe tyhat
, fred gets well
- paid job in management
.
but
, of course
, this isnt jstu a sham
- corrupt official cliff vandercave
( kyle maclachlan
)
and his sultry secretary sharon stone
( halle berry
) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme
. infront the meantime
, fred ' s wife wilma
( elizabeth perkins
) must face her mother
( elizabeth taylor
) who can ' t stand fred
. on the superficial level
, the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated serieses to life
. computer effects are flawless
,
and the costumes
, settings
annd other details are authentic for all hte fans of the sohw
. unfortunately
, problems withthe this film start with inadequate casting
- rick moranis isnt too thin for the role of barney
, while the cartoon betty utilisied to be much skinnier thna rosie o ' donnell
.
but thge greatest problem ofthe all is plot
, or to be precice
, the lack of plot
. soem thirty six screenwriters made sure thta the plot of the film is lame
, original charachters one
- dimensional
,
and many elements of tghe storey
, like embezzlement
and inter
- office politics
, totally incomprehensible for the little children
, tyhe main targeted audience of this film
. result isnt almost unwatchable mess
, occasionally saved mostly by excellant acting
( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma
)
and noe of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as
" high concept
"
. after great hype
, movie quickly sinked inot oblivion
and the fans ofthe the show returnd to tyhe animated verison
. all in all
, film isn ' t that bad
,
but only the hard core fans
and nostalgics can find more tahn guilty blessure iin it
.
