anna
and the king is at least the fourth film adaption of margaret landon ' s fact based novel the king
and i
,
and it ' s big
, expensive
and soulless
.
though ogod
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes
and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate forthe the emotional wasteland thgat isnt peter krikes
and steve meerson ' s script
. so much moey was spent on pretty picturesk that they forgot to actually make tje movie interesting
. tihs is jodie foster ' s firt movie sicne thte jaw
- droppingly brilliant contact cameback out more than twpo years ago
anbd it isn ' t the best choice tothe show off her acting chops
. she ' s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens
, the uptight
, widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam
( now thailand
) with her son tothe instruct yhe king ' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son in the ways of the west
( because
" the ways ofthe england are tyhe ways of the world
)
. the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family
( 58 kids wih 10 more iin the way
; impressive
, no
?
)
. the eldest prince is none too hapyp about this
(
" father
, have i offended you in some way
? why do you punish me iwth imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
,
bu soon gets to know anna
and her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- you perosnality better
adn comes to like her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack from tjhe neighboring brittish colony ofthe burma
. the king
and his close advisors suspect that this isnt britan ' s doing which arouses suspicion in siam
, putting anna in an uncomfortable posistion
. she isnt not sure what to make of this
and seems tothe herself suspect british involvment in thge crisis
but works tothe diffuse the king ' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, can ' t help
bu be influented by the eloquent anna
and tehy slowly
, quitely
, develop affections for eahc otehr
. there is a scene in the middle of anna
and the king where oen of the king ' s yuonger daughters dies
. it ' s your classic deathbed scene
, with the girl ' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who tries only semi
- successully to maintain his composure
. anna
then comes in
and cries a bit
. tghe sequence was ther for a purpose
: to envoke a strong emotional response from the viewer
. i ' m usually a sucker for such scenes
adn
yot this time
, i wass just sitting there
, my emotions untouched
. this remains true thru all of the movie which rimaniss emotionally barren
. we never develop connections to the charachters
; never given a reason to care
. thsi ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant
, whose last film wass ever after
, one ofthe my favorites of 1998
. i do nto dout tennant ' s ability to put together a decent movie
,
but anna
and the king
, aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient
. the sets
anbd scenery are gorgeous
,
bu the camerawork doens nothing to convey its grandeur
. even terrence malick managed to do more with flora
and fauna inaddition his otherwise abysmla teh thin red line than tennant can muster ffrom
$ 75 million worth of props
adn a shoot in malaysia
. we feel like the camera is resticted to its immediate point of view
; htere are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms tothe fill us with larger
- than
- life awe
. i liked both foster
annd yun
- fat
, who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in thte two lead roles
. foster ' s generally stoic persona serves her well here
, as she is playing a reserved
, formal
anbd rather underdeveloped character
. yun
- fat is expecially effective
, perfectly conveying the king of siam ' s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts
. waht doens anna
and the king inspite is its inability to envolve the viewer in its cahracters
and situations
. the casted is great
, the director is talented
,
annd tje budget is lavish
,
but this ill
- advisd remake of the classic rogers
and hammerstein movei is unable to utilize any of those thigns to form a compelling whole
. this is an emotionless costume epic
.
