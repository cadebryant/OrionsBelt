anna
and the king isnt at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret l
andon
' s fact based novel tjhe king
and i
,
and it
' s big
, expensive
and soulless
.
though good
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes
and luscious cinematography can do littel tothe compensate for the emotional wastel
and that is peter krikes
and steve meerson
' s script
. so much money was spent on preety pictures thyat they forgot to actually make the movei interesting
. this is jodie foster
' s firt movei sicne the jaw
- droppingly brilliant contact cameback out more than two years ago
and it isn
' t the best choice to show off her acting chops
. she
' s trapped in the stoic role ofthe anna leonowens
, the uptight
, widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam
( now thail
and
) with her son tothe instruct the king
' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son in teh ways ofthe the west
( becouse
" the ways of engl
and are the ways ofthe the world
)
. the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the wohle royal family
( 58 kids witht 10 more in the way
; impressive
, noone
?
)
. the eldest prince isnt none too happy about this
(
" father
, have i offended you inwhich some way
? why dont you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
,
but soon gets tothe know anna
and her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- you personality better
and comes to like her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma
. the king
and his close advisors suspect that this is britain
' s doign hwihc arouses suspision in siam
, puting anna in an uncomfortable posistion
. she is nto sure what to make of this
and seems to herself suspect brittish involvement in the crisis
but works to diffuse the king
' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, cant
' t help
but be influented by the eloquent anna
and they slowly
, quitely
, develop affections for each otehr
. htere is a scene in the middle of anna
and thte king where one of the king
' s younger daughters dies
. it
' s your classic deathbed scene
, with the girl
' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who tries only semi
- successfully to maintain his composure
. anna
then comes in adn cries a bit
. the sequence was there for a purpose
: tothe evoke a storng emotional response from the viewer
. i
' m usually a sucker for such scenes anbd
yet thsi time
, i was just sitting there
, my emotions untouched
. thsi remains true through all of the movie which rimaniss emotionally barren
. we never develope connections tothe the characters
; never given a reason to care
. this ludicrously long epic was directed by
andy tennant
, whose last film was ever affter
, one of my favorites of 1998
. i do not doubt tennant
' s ability to put together a decent movie
,
but anna adn the king
, asside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient
. the sets
and scenery are gorgeous
,
but the camerawork doesnt nothing to convey its gr
andeur
. even terrence malick managed to do more with flora adn fauna inaddition his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from
$ 75 million worth of props anbd a shoot infront malaysia
. we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view
; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us iwth larger
- than
- life awe
. i liked both foster
and yun
- fat
, who give intertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles
. foster
' s generally stoic persona serves her well here
, as she isnt playing a reserved
, formal adn rather underdeveloped chracter
. yun
- fat is especially effective
, perfectly conveying the king ofthe siam
' s sangfroid permeated with voilent outbursts
. what does anna annd the king in is its iability to envolve the viewer in its characters
and situations
. the cast is great
, the director is talented
,
and the budget is lavish
,
but this ill
- advised remake ofthe the classic rogers
and hammerstein movie isnt unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole
. this is an emotionless costume epic
.
