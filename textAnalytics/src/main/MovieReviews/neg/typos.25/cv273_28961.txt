a film that means well
, bu is too pushy in promoting its belabored point
and too sentimental tothe be compelling as a drama
. it
' s jeroen krabb
?
' s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can
' t forget their bitter past
. the heroine isnt an attractive
, carefree
, nonreligious 20
- yera
- old
, chaja
( fraser
)
, who wants to foreget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations
, screwing a student rebel leader
,
and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother
( s
? gebrecht
)
and her self
- absorbed
, eccentric father
( schell
)
. her parents are survivors ofthe the holocaust concentration camps
,
and her home life is filled with angst
. her mother isnt inwhich denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup
and baking cakes
and complaining baout everything
, while her father isnt more openly loving
but has recently been absorbed in searching fo twpo suitcases filled with mementos
, a family album
, silverware
,
and his old violin
. he buried them in a garden durig the war while fleeing thge nazis
,
but can
' t locate them now due to all the changes in the city
. out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher
and facing eviction ffrom her apartment
, she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents
' apartment building
, mr
. apfelschnitt
( topol
)
, tells her baout
. yhe hasidics are ultra
- orthodox
: they don
' t go tothe tghe cinema or watch tv
, adhere to strict dress codes
, anbd strikely observe their religious laws
. chaja is at first put off by tjhe way they expect her to follow theri rules
,
but soon finds the wife
, mrs
. kalman
( rossellini
)
, to be kind
and she becomes attached to oen ofthe her 5 children
, a 4
- yearm
- ood named simcha
( monty
) who doesn
' t talk
. the stern mr
. kalman
( krabb
?
) is not freindly to her
and considers her to be a whore because of tjhe way she dresses
. tothe hammer hmeo thte point of how anti
- semitism hasn
' t gone away there
' s a barrage of overdone
and uninvolving scenes withthe a sneering concierge
( bradley
)
, who keeps making nasty remarks baout jews anbd tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator
. the film is done in by its ham
- fisted scirpt as thte story
, adapted from carl friedman
' s book
" the shovel annd the loom
,
" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo ofthe its sentimentality
. it starts off telling chaja
' s story of how she
' s a lost jewess trying to find her identity
, thn tothe her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment
,
and hten it makes it a story about teh lingering effects ofthe the bitter past that cxan
' t be forgotten
. the effort seemed hevy
- h
anded
, as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock charactors
. the supporting casted consists ofthe all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring
: chaja
' s parents are given noone human shades
, while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one
- dimensional anbd falsely acted
. the only ones who fought through the script
and showed soem feelings were fraser
, whose effervescent face ws expressive ofthe both the trying times she was goign through
and the joys she falt
-
-
but most admirably showing how she coudl be so mistaken as to tihkn taht she could forget her roots
; while rossellini gave a warm performance ofthe a woman suffering in silence
, bu is storng inspite accepting her faith
. topol
' s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all tjhe right things to fraser
, acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense
. the film brazenly uses littel simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it cxan
' t love
: it starts out by showing how under chaja
' s loving care he
' s taken to the duck pond
and soon starts jabbering away
, begginning by saying
' quack
, quack
'
and
then goign on tothe ask the four questions during a passover seder
. bu by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence
, refuses tothe speak because ofthe his stern dad
,
and eventually becomes the victim ofthe a tragic accident
, tghe film thereby exploits the boy
' s sufferings
and his sotry jstu becomes tiresome
and nto sincerely done
. i felt i didn
' t just see a movie
, bu i attended a lecture for the hwole 100 mintues ofthe this sereous
but unappetizing story
. it wass thte kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon
, as it seemed to be inthe the habit ofthe rehashing its smae viewpoint unneccessarily
-
- the message it keeps sending wass already received
. in tyhe last shot where father
and daughter are hopelessly digging for tje lost lugage
, one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past
. that seems strange
, since i
thought taht was what thsi film was supposed to be about
. unless i ws mistaken
and the film
' s rela aim was to make us cry over simcha
.
