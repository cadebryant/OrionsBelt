whn critics attack seemingly well
- intentioned films liek patch adams or mroe recently pay it forward as i am baout to dont
, thier opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e
- mails
, sometimes even mock death threats from those who
( i suppose
) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their enteratinment
. even politicians
(
!
) tend tothe dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on ogod
- hearted films while praising
" filth
" like pulp fiction
. these
[ fill in the derogatory term taht you are comfortable with
] tend to forget that a film critic
' s job is to review the movei
, nto the message
, howver sweet
and endearing that message may be
. thusly patch adams isn
' t a bad film baceause it
' s about a doctor who cares for his patients
; it
' s a bad film beccause it
' s a calulated peice of brazen audience exploitation
. similarly while pay it foward may have its heart in the right place
(
though i even doubt that
, stay tuned
, an explanation isnt forthcoming
)
, it
' s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess
. the picture isnt about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher
( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey
)
, with a burn scared face
and equally singed attitude
, who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doign oney hting over yhe course of thge semester taht will change the world
. 12 year ood trevor
( haley joel osmet
)
, a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother
( helen hunt
)
, comes up with the notion to pay it foward
; this entails a person doing one good deed
( call it an uber favor
) for threee others
,
then telling them to do thte same for three others adn before long we
' re all living iin a frank capra movie
. meanwhile in a paralell story
, a weasely reporter
( jay mohr
) tracks the
" movement
" which has apparently begun tothe grow
. pay it forward has odd ideas baout tone
; at certian points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be tjhe appropriate antidote to teh unrelenting sappiness at its core
. it
' s as if directer mimi leder didn
' t have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended
, adn compromised out of fear that her film wasn
' t
" gutsy
" anough to earn tghe acclaim it has claerly been made for
. so the picture adds grit
( a child molester propositions trevor
, a homeless man returns tothe heroin after bieng
" saved
"
, a character is knifed while doing a ogod deed
, etc
)
though it seems shallow
, incorporated into the proceedings baceause the film itself isn
' t qtuie sure if it
' s ready to buy into its pwn utopian blather
. pay it forward offers
" crowd pleasing
" elements for general audiences
; jay mohr
' s umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball
, angie dickinson
' s earthy alcoholic bag woman
,
and thte jive
- talking
" black hoodlum with a heart ofthe gold
"
( comming on the heals of the black
, god
- like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled
, thsi may jsut be the beginnings of a br
and new guilty white liberal clich
?
. hurray for hollywood
) who actually calls the mohr character a
" nigga
"
and says things like
" can yuo efel me
?
" leave it to pay it forward to happily include a littel minstrel act for our further enjoyment
.
( mabey spike
' s flick wasn
' t so misguided after all
)
. these scenes efel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with fiel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you
' ll find yourself trapped inthe should you not heed my warnings
. hwile tghe filmmakers have stressed inwhich interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place
, tothe me the final product hasnt the oily feel of a cynical politican contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audeince
. it
' s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration
, with the main players
( all previous oscar winners or nominees
) given big emotional scenes that are practically varations onthe their most lauded turns
. oen scene in whic a slightly de
- glamed helen hunt
( de
- glamed here means taht not only isnt she a fasion victim
[ her look is somewhere between goth queen
and trailer park mama
]
, hunt
' s hair is also natty
and badly bleached
) verbally castigates spacey
, feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip
. spacey
, of course
, responds in his cultured monotone
, that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance
. maybee the actor should get an award for comming off the least self consciously irritating
;
though how cxan he nto
, even when he
' s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference
. the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender
. iin noe atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet
, immediately covering her mouth with the guilty h
and inwhich tht very smae stroke
,
and with said h
and still on said mouth
, she actually begins convulsing
( dry heaving raelly
)
,
then
(
and i
' m not making this up
) she scurries tothe the kitchen tearing the place appart in a frenzied search for alcohol
. the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow
- ups
; it
' s all very theatrical
, especially hunt
' s peformance
, which feels liuke a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar
. pay it forward has the dubious distiction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn
' t get academy awards
. the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent inot overwrought expressionists
. even haley joel osemt
, tghe wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense
, seems more divisive about his expressions
and inflections
. his acting has become broader
, less intimate
; it
' s as if we cin make out the little munchkin
' s
thoughts
:
" boy this outta floor em
"
. naturally osmet isnt made to play one ofthe those only
- in
- thte
- movies childern
, a martyr
- figure who cleans uv aftter his mother
, lectures her on tghe ills of drinking
,
and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher
. never mind that the two couldn
' t be more dissimilar
; his mother isnt trailer trash dopey
, annd tyhe teacher is one of those dennis miller
- ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary
. nevertheless this little nudnik goes out ofthe his way tothe bring the pair toghether in a scene that recalls parent trap
- ish cornball antics
.
but oh how we lveo bright
, articulate
, self
- sacrificing children who pick adults up by theri bootstraps adn guide them through life
. they
' re so adorable
. of course hte blaim can
' t all be hoisted onto the actors
(
though wtih the exception of the little kid
, they probably should hve known better
)
, instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder
, who directed noe of the most thrilling episodes of er
,
then went on to make two awful genre films in a row
. tjhe first being the peacemaker
, a witless post
- cold war george clooney vehicle
, adn deep impact
, one of the twpo films ofthe 1998 to squ
ander the premise ofthe earth
' s possible demise by a crazed meteorite
. the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich
? s
,
and a complete absence of any kind ofthe emotional involvement
, not aided by an ending whihc actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out
( apparently present for an invisibl audience
)
. deep impact has more in common with pay it foward
; it
' s a movei that treats earth
' s impending destruction inthe awfully simplistic terms
, completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet woudl be a goner within dyas
. the film was full of unoperational speeches where peple really said nothing
,
though the sappy csore swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching
. in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermitent dollops ofthe cynicism seeming almost like a re
buttle
:
" see my movei isn
' t as na
? ve as you might htink
" she seems to be saying
. noone
, it
' s just horribly confused
.
