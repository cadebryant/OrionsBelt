ugh
. that about sums this movei up
. jstu
, ugh
. the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic
,
and wehn reviewing the previvous films
, each film hadnt a certain degree ofthe inteligence
. anbd that was teh reason they found such an enviable cult following
; inaddition spite of bad special effects
, horrible dubbing
,
and a man in a lizard suit
, htey mantained a certain degree ofthe
.
.
. how to put this
?
.
.
. dignity
? not quite the word i
' m looking for
. you underst
and
, right
?
and in 50 years
, godzilla has maintained that degree of
' whatever
'
. leave it to amercia tothe scre tghe whole thing up
.
> from tjhe
' geniuses
' that brought us
" independece day
"
, argubly the worst sci
- fi movie of all time
, to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had
. while they do bring us eye
- popping special effects that will amaze you
, they lost what was at tje center of all the original godzilla movies
-
- a storyline
. summing uv the movei isnt simple
. heck
, i can dont it infront one sentence
: giant lizard attacks a giant city
and a bunch ofthe nobodies stop it
. simple as that
. matthew broderick stumbles over his lines
, adn it
' s hard to picture hank azaria inwhich any role besides his classic dog
- walking character onthe the television show
" mad about you
"
. the dialogue seems to be improvized
, almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all
. i can see tje scene on tjhe set right now
.
" all right
! we spended all of this money making big speshal effects
,
and we
' ve gotta git htis movei out by summer or it
' s goign to bomb inthe our faces
. so
, you actors jstu sday whta ever comes to thge top of your head
, all right
? make up something
, m
' kay
? ogod
. roll film
!
!
" the special effects are anough to keep yuo interested through one viewing
,
and smoe of the cinemtography is well
- done
( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind
)
. still
, an hour into it
, you will become antsy
, wondering how long htey can drag it outloud
.
and drag it out they do
!
! i have to laff
. yhe slogan for the film is
,
" size does marter
"
. i think they cut this too short
. it should read
,
" size does matter
. acting doesnt not
.
