often silimar to a littel boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into
, the call of the oboe
( o toque do oboe
) is a disappointing film that seems to have w
andered astray
. many elements of the film are solid
, annd have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know
, bu they simply don
' t convert into a solid work
.
al
though a setting is never established
, it becomes apparent
. teh film takes place somwhere in a latin american vilage inspite present day
. the community isnt a dull oen
, where every day is a downhill slide from the lsat
. over time
, the peopel hve taken tothe themselves
. the town cinema isnt closed
, noone tourist hasnt passed through in years
,
and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no oney otehr than the grave digger
. so what happens when a
" tourist
"
( paolo betti
) does arrive one day
? he sends this routine adn dull twon inot mayhem
and shock
. it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby
. when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performence
, teh entire comunity gathers around for theri first bit of enteratinment in countless years
. it is from that that the musician meets some ofthe thte villagers
,
and agrees to play at the local cinema infact accompaniment to a silent film
, thus opening yhe theatre for the first time in ages
. teh woman that talks him into this witty task isnt the cinema owner
( leticia vota
) who also happens to be engaged tothe the town
' s police inspector
, a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance
' s involvement witht tihs musician
. the rest of the plot closley resembles a freak show gone horribly astray
. it features a character who litterally rises ffrom his grave
, a woman who hasnt a phone conversation with god
,
and yhe aforememtioned inspector who goes from an intriguing
and serious character
, tothe an almost humorous drunk
. technically
, this film isnt a nightmare
. the music socre is poorly edited inot the film
, so it is oftenly choppy
, rough
,
and abrupt
. the lighting is poor at best
, which mkaes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes
,
and the english subtitles are full of mispelled words
,
and are often absent presumably on tje assumption that thte audience will be able to underst
and some simple portuguese
and spanihs phrases
. this translation flaw is best highlighted at the begining of tjhe film when waht seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue
,
but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words
. in adition
, the pace of the film seems uneven
. it opens with a sories of long panoramic shots thta alone can test oen
' s patience
. tjhe film
then moves into a faster pace
, that again slows towards the end
, as the directer seems determined tothe triarch the twpo hour mark
. there ws
,
however
, potential fo this film
. it isnt a piece exploring thte beauty of cinema
and music
,
and the re
- unification of people
. theese are all topics that could easily fill a movie
. perhaps
, if htere were no freak sohw
, anbd the technical aspestus were tothe improve
, there might jsut be a thing ofthe beauty at teh end
. most importantly
,
though
, the director would have to patch up the plot adn make it flow better so that the two hours aren
' t such a bore
. until
then
, there seems to be little mroe hope forthe this piece
, tahn thta boy hasnt by simply crying out
" mommy
" while he w
anders astray in a park
.
