plot
: set in the future
, a courier hasnt uploaded some data into a
" hard drive
" that resides in his head
,
and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information
. since he overloaded his
" hard drive
"
, he
' s alsot racing agaisnt the clock before the information seeps into his brain
and kills him
. critique
: incoherent
, boring
, one
- ect drivel with no suspense
, horribly unbeleivable futuristic environment
, bad dialogue
, career
- defining bad acting by keanu reeves
and a hillarious ending
. it
' s too bad because the premise of the film was interesting
,
but unfortunately for my firends
and i
, this movie turned out tothe be just as bad as everyone had warned us
. it
' s one of those films that makse you strat laughing half
- way through
, when ytou relize that most ofthe the actors in it suck
, tje loction shots are filmed in dark
" junkyard
" type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic
( whatever
.
.
.
)
, anbd all tje sets look like
.
.
.
. well
, sets
. there is also absolutly no arc to this storey
. it basicly starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain
,
and
then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop tothe teh former uneventful proceedings
. gibson should stick to writing novels
and
" x
- files
" epidsodes
, since his segue into thge paranormal tv series was much mroe entertaining than any of this garbage
. some other hilarities of this film includ dolph lundgren as soem futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass
, henry rollins as a pumped
- up cyber
- doctor or something
,
and ice
- t as smoe kind of a hobo dued with paint all over his face
( don
' t ask
)
. teh ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin
and a stupid ghost
- lady ffrom inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by thta point
. i
' m ashamed tothe say thsi film was shooted infact my hometown of montreal
, canada
,
but sadly enough for us all
, it was
. some of the cyber
- travelling special effects were okay
( hence
, the 2
/ 10
)
, bu overall
, it
' s one of those bad movies that
' s just funny to watch
and cringe at
. thankfully fo keanu
, he redeemed his sci
- fi career with 1999
' s the matrix
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. it
' s too bad that he hasnt
yet tothe redeem his lack of acting talent
. little known facts about this film
and its stars
: as ofthe 1999
, director robert longo never directed anohter full
- feature film
. hmmm
.
.
. now isn
' t that odd
