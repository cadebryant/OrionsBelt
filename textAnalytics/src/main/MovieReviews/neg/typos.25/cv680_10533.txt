. he doesn
' t haev a hard
- to
- decipher accent
, 2
. he doesn
' t always speak in a monotone
,
and 3
. his face doesn
' t always wear the same impassive expression
. in short
, hte former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too ogod to be bad
,
but too bad to be good
. unfortunatley
, the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle
, firestorm
, whic isnt jsut plain awful
. oney of tjhe most glaring problems with long
( who made his acting de
but infront john woo
' s broken arrow
) is that he
' s so medicore tath he often blends in with the scenery
. as ace firefighter jesse graves
, long is supposed to be playing a bigger
- tahn
- life action hero
-
- tyhe kind ofthe he
- man who will kresh through a flaming doorjam to savve a child or parachute into a burning clearing tothe rescure soem stupid campers
. unfortunately
, despite the best effords of first
- tiem director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner
' s owrk in tghe postman look stark
, jesse turns out to be a preety boring good guy
. to put it kindly
, this is nto a well
- written motion picture
. firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines setted against a backdrop ofthe diaster movie clich
? s which
, taken together
, form something that requires a level ofthe viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot
. tghe only reason this film is getting one star
( instade ofthe something lower
) is thast most of the fire sequences are realistic
,
and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been neccesary to stage them effectively
. we
' re introduced to our big burly hero oen afternoon when he
and some colleagues jump into the midst ofthe a forest fire tothe sive a group of peple
. during this sequence
, our big burly hero proves thta he
' s allso a sensitive guy by risking his life tothe save a little girl adn her dog
( yes
, the dog lives
) from being broiled alive
. flash
- forward a year
. nowe
, our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers assosication
, replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins
( rela actor scott glenn
)
.
but this day
, our big burly hero
' s first in charge
, isn
' t going to be busineses
- as
- usual
. a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forrest allight to aid theri flight to freedom
. led by r
andy earl shaye
( william forsythe
)
, the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
, they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across teh border
. along the way
, they meet
and take hostage tje damsel in distress
( suzy amis
)
. eventually
, our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire
, rescure the damsel inaddition distress
, defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really dieu
,
and restore order tothe the galaxy
. firestorm
' s directer
, dean semler
, is a former cinematographer
( he won an academy award for his wokr onthe dances iwth wolves
)
, so it
' s no surprise that the film looks ogod
. unfortunately
, that
' s firestorm
' s lone asset
, annd it falters near the end
, whn computer
- generated special effects fill up the screen
. these are of about equal quality to waht you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game
. tje action sequences
, which includ a variety of chases
, are occasionally interesting
,
but never invigorating
. everyone
, incuding long
, appears to be going through hte motions
. there isn
' t a memorable performence to be found from beginning to end
, unless you count the forest fire
, which generates smoe heat
. as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
, william forsythe lacks panache
. he
' s worse than a generic bad guy
; he
' s a boring generic bad guy who doesn
' t have any snappy oney
- liners to hurl at our big burly hero
. my advice to scott glenn
( absolute power
) annd suzy amis
( titanic
) is to accidentally forget this film the next tyme they
' re making outloud a resume
. there
' s some small comfort in knowing this early in the yearm that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list
.
( at least i hope htere aren
' t 10 worse films than this
.
) anbd i know i wasn
' t the onyl oen who really disliked this movie
. as the audience ws filing out of the screening
, i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments
. tjhe general consensus seemed to be that
,
al
though the movie sucked
, the promotional key ring wass cool
. hte probelm is that fox won
' t be giving outloud key rings to regular movie
- goers
, so that nixes any reason to see firestorm
.
