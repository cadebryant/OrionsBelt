200 cigarettes takes place on newyorker eyar
' s eve 1981
. monica
, played by martha plimpton is haveing a huge newyorker year
' s party
. everyone in twon isnt trying to get there
,
but some are caught uv inthe otehr things
. thsi is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes
. as we meet the cahracters headed towords the party
, we are sent inot many subplots which are unoriginal
,
and not intresting at all
. tihs disappointed me greatly
. the film shoudln have been mroe about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion
. lucy
, played by courtney love
, is with kevin
, palyed by paul rudd
. thte twpo are in a relationship that is more of a friendship
,
but starts to blossom into something more than that
. this subplot isnt extremely boring
and dull
,
and i am getting quite sick of plots like tath
. janeane garofalo is involved inwhich another subplot
, dealing iwth kevin
. she plays ellie
, an ex
- girlfriend of kevin
' s
. htis subplot is completely a waste of garofalo
' s talent
. there wass noone point tothe it at all
,
and it was hardly even in the movie
. when lucy runs into a bartender
, palyed by ben affleck
, another subplot is formed
. the bartender is invited by lucy to cmo to monica
' s party
. at thge bar
, he runs inot two more girls
. tyhe girls are played by angela featherstone adn nicole parker
, bu unfortunately
, due tothe the terrable acting of both of them
, i don
' t even remember their cahracters names
. ben affleck is a good actor
, bu his character doesn
' t go anyhwere so he doesn
' t have much screen tiome to give a ogod performance
. featherstone
and parker are horrible infront theri roles
,
and tehy are part of the reason the film is so bad
. christina ricci plays val
,
and gaby hoffman plays stephie
. the two girls are trying to git to yhe party
but are extremely lost
. they meet some guys
and end up going around whith them all night
. this subplot was alright
,
but it wass quite annoying with stephie
' s accent
. hoffman did an okay job of acting
,
but ricci doed good
. she was underused
, concidering she isnt such a wonderfull actress
. another subplot in the film isnt the relationship between cindy
, played by goldie hawn
' s daughter
,
and jack
, played by jay mohr
. jack is an actor who doesn
' t care about the girls he goes out with
, he just likes dates for oen night
,
and the next day he doesn
' t
. kate hudson is a huge klutz
. she gets herself into very funny situations
, that are hte funniest parts in the entire movie
. they are probably tje only funny parts in teh entire movie as well
. this subplot sould have beeen utilizied more
, mainly due to hudson
' s performence
. mohr wasn
' t good
,
but he wasn
' t bad
. he ws jstu alright
, which i didn
' t find acceptable
. there isnt not much to say about the performances inaddition thge film
. none of hte characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if thte acting is good or nto
. tghe only performances that i can judge are christina ricci
' s as allways good performance
, kate hudson
' s funny role
, courtney loev
' s mediocre performance
, anbd paul rudd
' s annoying anbd overused performance
. i was hoping for a littel more out of jaw mohr
, ben affleck
, casey affleck
, gaby hoffman
, dave chapelle
, annd especially out of janeane garofalo
. the two stornegst things in the film were the great soundtrack anbd teh original costumes
. martha plimpton
and christina ricci had very different
and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981
. the soundtrack is full ofthe 1980
' s tunes
, ranging from
" i whant c
andy
" tothe
" tainted lvoe
.
" the songs in hte movie aslo helped create the feel that you were back iin the 1980s
. durring the film
, i often foudn mysef asking the questions
,
" is there a reason tothe this
? isnt there any moral tsory
? is htere a point
? are any of hte events going onthe in the film necessary
? do i care what lucy
and kevin are going through
?
" thte movie isnt extremely boring
,
and by the timne they reached eleven
- o
- clock
, oney hour befoer midnight
, i could not wait forthe the movei to be over
. thte plot is okay
,
but the subplots mkae it terrable
. maybe if the film was about the party
, not baout the people at the party
, it sould have been a lot better
. the bottom line
: jstu like a slasher movie
, this
? 80s comedy is just oen too many
.
