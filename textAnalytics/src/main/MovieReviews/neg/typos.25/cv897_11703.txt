. the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist
and his secretary
, while his wife disapproves
. meanwhile
, a loan shark in need ofthe a shave trys to leave his proffesion
. comments
: why is this movie called posessed by the niht
? it
' s hard to speculate
. most of this film tkaes place during hte day
, adn the only thing possessing anyone is an icky
, pulsating
, bubbling brain thingie in a jar
. in case yuo haven
' t picked up on this
yet
, possessed by the night is a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
" thriller
"
( i use the term
" thriller
" loosely here
) which is really cheap
and bad
. the plot
, which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction storey from the 1950s
, actually serves one purpose
: to exploit nude womens as often as possible
. writting a movei review for a film like this proves oddly chalenging
. there
' s really not much to say
. the acting is lousy
;
al
though
, occasionally
, the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two fomr the audience
. most humorous is frank sivero
, who plays murray
, thge novelist
' s agent
. he is so horrible in this role thyat noe can
' t halp bu be ammused
. the plot sucks
. nearly half tjhe film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession
, even
though he hasnt only limited relevance tothe the movie as a whole
. the dialogue stinks
. a loan shark
, fo instatance
, tells another how much he loves bimbos
, which is something the audeince really doesn
' t need tothe know
. everything about possessed by the nigth is second rate
, even the film credits
. as the names of thte not
- so
- talented film crew scrolled by at the end
, joseph scales came up
, credited as being
" assistsant tothe foley artist
.
" someone could have used an editor
! to be honest
, the film isnt basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity adn show some sex scenes
. playboy playmate shannon tweed
, after all
, is the star here
. i supose that if one wanted this sort of thnig
, he would like this movie
. why did i give this turkey twpo stars
and not one
? as a bad movie
, it is unintentionally funny enough tothe keep someone passingly intersted in the film
. if you feel possessed to see posessed by hte inght
,
however
, i
' d recommend you exorcise this impulse
and watch something else
.
