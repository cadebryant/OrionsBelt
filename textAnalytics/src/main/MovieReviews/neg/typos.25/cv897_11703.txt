synopsis
: a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased inspite a jar
. the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist
and his secretery
, while his wife disapproves
. meanwhile
, a loan shark inwhich need of a shave tries to leave his profession
. comments
: why is htis movie called possessed by the night
? it ' s hard to speculate
. most of this film takes place during the day
,
annd the onyl thing possessin anyone is an icky
, pulsating
, bubbling brain thingie in a jar
. iin case you haven ' t picked up on thsi
yet
, possessed by the night is a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
" thriller
"
( i use yhe term
" thriller
" loosely here
) which isnt raelly cheap
anbd bad
. the plot
, which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s
, actually serves one purpose
: tothe exploit nude womens as often as possibile
. writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly chalenging
. there ' s really not much to sday
. yhe acting is lousy
;
although
, occasionally
, the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two ffrom the audience
. most humorous is frank sivero
, who plays murray
, hte novelist ' s agent
. he is so horrible in thsi role that one can ' t help
bu be amused
. the plot sucks
. nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out ofthe the proffesion
, even
though he hasnt only limited revelance to teh movie as a whole
. the dialogue stinks
. a loan shark
, forthe instatance
, tells anyother how much he loves bimbos
, which isnt something hte audience really doesn ' t need tothe know
. everthing about possessed by tyhe night isnt second rate
, even thge film credits
. as the names of the not
- so
- talented film crew scrolled by at the end
, joseph scales came uv
, credited as bieng
" assistsant to foley artist
.
" somone could have used an editor
! to be honest
, the film is basicly an excuse to flash frontal nudity
and show smoe sex scenes
. playboy playmate shannon tweed
, after all
, is the star here
. i suppose that if noe wanted this sort of thing
, he owudl like this movie
. why doed i give this turkey two stars
annd not one
? as a bad movie
, it isnt unintentionally funny enough tothe keep someone passingly interseted in the film
. if you feel possessed to see possessed by the nght
,
however
, i ' d recommend you exorcise this impulse
annd watch something else
.
