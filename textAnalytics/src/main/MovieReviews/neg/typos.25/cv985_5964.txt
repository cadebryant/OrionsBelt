boy
, what a great movie
!
! keanu reeves
and morgan freeman acting toghether
, the director of the fugitive
(
andrew davis
) back again to give us another thriller
,
and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot
. how coudl htis not be a blockbuster
? all die
- hard keanu reeves fans
, read on
. ol
" much ado about nothing
" plays eddie kasalivich
, a machinist studing at the university of chicago
. to help pay for the rent
, he takes on this job makeing tjhe machinery for a hydrogen project bieng conducted by the university
. by happy coincidence
, he alsot happens to stumble onthe the solution to the final problem
and thus is the only oney who knows the key to performing this feat of miricle physics
. this project holds great promise
: taking hydrogen from water
and giving outloud more energy than is put in
. a potential solution to tje earth
' s energy problems without the polution cost
. surely nobody could have any problems iwth that
? morgan freeman is paul shannon
, the project
' s sponsor
. he works forthe a very powerful organistion that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quicklyu technology should be released to the publich
. he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quicklyu
. so he murders tjhe project leader
, blows up tyhe project
( great bu short scene here
, sort of liek a mini id4 city
- devastation hting
)
and trys to simulate yhe experiment at some other hi
- tech hush
- hush location
. unfortunately
, our intrepid machinist
and an english physicist
( weisz
) manage to get away
and now follows a fugitive
- like chase useing a not too dissimilar rehash ofthe that movie scirpt
. thsi movie is jsut dying for a comparision wtih
" the fugitive
"
. both movies uise chicago as the main city
and since the place doesn
' t chanage much
, i guess we can
' t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere
. thge trouble here is that where thte fugitive had harrison ford
and tommy lee jones
, chain reaction onyl has keanu reeves
and fred ward
. credit to them
,
but we aren
' t really given much of a chance to empathise with thte characters
. where ford ws able tothe wokr within the confines of tjhe movie to envoke simapthy
, eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable
and reeves
' charachter is never given the tiome tothe develop
. it might have beeen a better investment in film to give the characters more depth
and spend less time on the chase sequences
, whcih frankly
, git quite boring after a while
. harrison ford was
" tyhe man against the world
.
" he was alone in a world where he didn
' t know who to trust
and it came across real well
. iin chain reaction
, keanu reeves isn
' t alone
. nowe that would be fine if hte fleeing couple had some chemistry anbd sould really portray some paranoya
, vulnerability
and confusion
. we don
' t get thsi
. we git him thingking he
' s still in speed
, onyl now our s
andra bullock has an english accent
, probably doesn
' t drive a bus
,
and hardly contri
butes anything to the movie
. the producers here probaly throught
,
" hey
, what if keanu anbd rachel don
' t hit it off too well
? let
' s rope in that morgan tothe help us out
.
" well
, keanu
and rachel didn
' t hit it off well on the screen
, adn most unfortunately
, morgan freeman doesn
' t help much either
. teh only thing we come to really knwo of paul shannon is thast he alwyas has a full load of cigars infact his cigar holder
. it
' s not really his fault
. once again
,
andrew davis just doesn
' t take the time to build his characters
. someone must have convinced him that thsi time round
, cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
