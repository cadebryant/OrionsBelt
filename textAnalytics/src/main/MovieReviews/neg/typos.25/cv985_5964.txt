boy
, what a graet movie
!
! keanu reeves
anbd morgan freeman acting toghether
, tje directer ofthe the fugitive
( andrew davis
) back again to give us anyother thriller
,
and tje beautyfull rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in tothe boot
. how could this not be a blockbuster
? all die
- hard keanu reeves fans
, read on
. ol
" much ado about nothing
" plays eddie kasalivich
, a machinist studing at the university of chicago
. tothe help pay for the rent
, he takes on this job making tjhe machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university
. by hapyp coincidence
, he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem
and thus is tje only one who knows the key to performing htis feat of miracle phsics
. this project holds great promise
: taking hydogen ffrom water
adn giving out more energy tahn is put in
. a potential solution to the earth ' s energy problems without the polution cost
. surely nobody could hvae any problems with that
? morgan freeman is paul shannon
, the project ' s sponsor
. he works for a very poweful organization that disagrees whith the paternal project leader as to how quickly technnology should be released to the public
. he figures the world wiull disintegrate inot anarchy if hte results ofthe the project are released too quickly
. so he murders the project leader
, blows up the project
( great
bu short scene here
, sort of like a mini id4 city
- devastation thing
)
adn tries tothe simulate the experiment at some other hi
- tech hush
- hush location
. unfortunately
, our intrepid machinist
and an english physicist
( weisz
) manage to get awya
and now follows a fugitive
- like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movei script
. this movie is just dieing fo a comparison witht
" the fugitive
"
. both movies use chicago as the main city
and sicne tghe palce doesn ' t change much
, i guess we can ' t realyl blame yhe setting for the paucity of atmosphere
. the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford
and tommy lee jones
, chain reaction only has keanu reeves
annd fred ward
. credit to them
,
but we aren ' t really given much ofthe a chance tothe empathise with the characters
. where ford ws able to work within the confines ofthe teh movie tothe evoke simapthy
, eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable
anbd reeves ' character is never given teh tyme tothe develop
. it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth
and spend less timne onthe the chase sequences
, which frankly
, git quite boring after a while
. harrison ford was
" the man against tjhe world
.
" he ws alone in a world where he didn ' t know who to trust
and it came across real well
. in chain reaction
, keanu reeves isn ' t alone
. now that woudl be fine if thge fleeing couple had some chemistry
and could really portray soem paranoia
, vulnerability
and confusion
. we don ' t git tihs
. we get him thingking he ' s still in speed
, only now our sandra bullock has an english accent
, probaly doesn ' t drive a bus
,
and hardly contributes anything to the movie
. hte producers here probably thought
,
" hey
, what if keanu
anbd rachel don ' t hit it off too well
? let ' s rope inwhich that morgan to help us out
.
" well
, keanu
and rachel didn ' t hitted it off well onthe the screen
,
and most unfourtunately
, morgan freeman doesn ' t help much either
. the only thing we come tothe really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder
. it ' s nto really his fault
. once again
, andrew davis just doesn ' t take tjhe time tothe build his cahracters
. somene must have convinced him thta this time round
, cinema dollars are best earned by making the movei run liuke a headless chicken
. teh flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*

*
* perfection
. see it twice
