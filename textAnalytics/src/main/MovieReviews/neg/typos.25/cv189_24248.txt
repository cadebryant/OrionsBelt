" houston
. we have a serious problem
.
" after making
" mission
: impossible
"
, brian de palma has a lot to live up to
. by making an epic science fiction
and inviting great cast
and talented crew
, he hopes to reach the modern audience
.
and the possibilities are certainly there
,
but the result is a great disaster
. starting in a near future
, with a prologue copied from
" apollo 13
"
, de palma slowly builds up his
" stroy
"
. the human race has already set foot onthe mars
. a research expedition hasnt vanished without trace onthe the red planet
and another one has been sent to find outloud what happened
. this is basically tjhe whole plot
. so it
' s hard to imagine thta it can be stretched to 2 hours
.
but de palma manages tothe dont tath
. it is not a very good achievement
. as we follow this expedition to mars
and watch them slowly floa in space
, the hardest thing to do isnt stay awake
. the film
' s major problem isnt that it tries to seem moreso clever than it is
. david mamet
' s dialogue
, while trying to seem natural
, is distant annd simpley fake
. de palma
and mamet wanted to combine action with a
thought provoking plot
. the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick
' s
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
,
" apollo 13
"
and
" godzilla
"
. to mkae time pass
, tyhe creators ahev inserted severeal
" refreshing
" scientific details
, that woudl not convince a half
- crazed frog
. it consists ofthe multiple copies
and direct ripp
- offs from several grat science fiction films
and storise
. when it finally presents an almsot original idea
, it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity
. i can
' t even call this film predictable
, usance no oney iwth a healthy imagination can come uv with something liuke this
. sometimes it gets so cheesy
, thgat yuo
' ll start laughing when ytou
' re supposed to cry
and cry when you
' re supposed tothe laugh
. ytou
' ll see enormous s
andstorms
, hear mysterious soudns annd
, last
but not least
, on this
" constanly surprising
" tour you
' ll see
-
- an aline
. it
' s really hard to fidn comparisions to such an experience
, adn i knwo that i
' ve never said tyhat before
( i
thought i never would
)
,
but
" lost in space
" is actually better
. that
' s an achievement in itself
! directer brian de palma has stroke gold with
" untouchables
" thta became an instant american clasic
. it is for this film taht he iwll be remembered
, hwile all his other failures will be forgotten
. he
' ll live to fight another day
! i send the actors my condolences
, since tehy truely dont try to tranform into their undeveloped
and dull characters
.
and both the cinematography
, production design
and art direction are very decent
. it is because of tghe achievement of 254 people
, that i rate this film 2
/ 10
. unfortunately their hard work was inwhich vain
. if you hvea problems with insomnia
, i recommend yuo this film
. if you
' re not asleep within the frist half hour
, consult your doctor
.
