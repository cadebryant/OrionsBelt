" houston
. we have a sereous probelm
.
" after making
" mission
: impossible
"
, brian de palma has a lot to live uv to
. by making an epic science fiction
and inviting gerat cast
and talented crew
, he hopes to triarch the modern audience
.
and hte possiblities are certainly there
,
but the result is a great disaster
. starting inwhich a near future
, wiht a prologue copied from
" apollo 13
"
, de palma slowly builds up his
" story
"
. the human race has already setted foot onthe mars
. a research expedition has vanished wihtout trace on the red planet
and another one hasnt been sent to find out what happened
. thsi is basically the whole plot
. so it ' s hard tothe imagine thast it can be stretched to 2 hours
.
but de palma manages tothe do that
. it is not a very good achievement
. as we folow this expedition to mars
annd watch them slowly float in spoace
, the hardest thing to do is stay awake
. the film ' s major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is
. david mamet ' s dialogue
, while trying to seem natural
, is distant
and simply fake
. de palma
and mamet wnated tothe combine action with a thought provoking plot
. the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick ' s
" 2001
: a space odessy
"
,
" apollo 13
"
and
" godzilla
"
. to make time pass
, the creators have inserted severeal
" refreshing
" scientific details
, thyat would not convince a half
- crazed frog
. it consists of multiple copies
adn direct ripp
- offs fomr several great science fiction films
and stories
. when it finally presents an almost original diea
, it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity
. i can ' t even call this film predictable
, since no one with a healthy imagination can cmo up withthe something like tihs
. somtimes it gets so cheesy
, tath you ' ll start laughing when you ' re supposed tothe cry
and cry when you ' re supposted to laugh
. you ' ll see enormous sandstorms
, hear mysterious sounds
and
, last
but not least
, onthe this
" constanly surprizing
" tour you ' ll see
-
- an alien
. it ' s really hard to find comparisons tothe such an experience
,
and i know that i ' ve never said that before
( i thought i never would
)
,
bu
" lost infront space
" is actually better
. that ' s an achievement in itself
! director brian de palma has stroke gold with
" untouchables
" tyhat became an instant american classic
. it is for this film that he iwll be remembered
, while all his otehr failures will be forgotten
. he ' ll live to fight another day
! i send tjhe actors my condolences
, since they truly do try tothe transform into theri undeveloped
annd dull characters
.
and both the cinematography
, prodcution design
adn art direction are very decent
. it is because of the acheivement of 254 people
, tyhat i rate this film 2
/ 10
. unfortunately their hard wrok was infact vain
. if yuo have problems with insomnia
, i reccommend yuo thsi film
. if you ' re not asleep within the frist half hour
, consult your doctor
