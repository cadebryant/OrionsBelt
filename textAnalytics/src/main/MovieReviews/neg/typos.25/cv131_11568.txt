baout an hour or so into
" the jackal
,
" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence
,
adn one of the audiance members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out
" i hope she gets killed now
!
" at that point it hitted me
: i didn ' t care for any of the characters bieng palyed by actors i didn ' t realyl liuke
. when the sole reason ytou care about a character being palyed by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he ' s being played by sidney poitier
, you know something ' s rotten in hte state ofthe denmark
. every year
, a couple films like this are released
. you know
: the cheap
, action packed international espionnage film
, featuring a semi
- promising premise
, some big
- name actors
( usually bruce willis
)
,
and the hopes that some audience members will foreget the cold war ended sevral years ago
. this wass the third oen ofthe ' 97
, follwoing tghe very lackluster
" the saint
,
" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe
;
and the surprisingly fun
" tghe peacemaker
,
" featuring clooney
and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villian
.
" the jackal
" tries to mix both elements
.
and you thought
" the saint
" was bad
.
" the jackal
" isnt loosely
( vrey loosley
, i hope
) based on tjhe 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i ' ve
yet tothe see
,
" tyhe day of the jackal
,
" which featured
( aparently
) a suave hitman called tje jackal
, plyed by edward fox
, trying to assasinate charles degaule
. well
, welcome to the 90s
, where a sorta suave hitman
, aslo called the jackal
( bruce willis
)
, trying to kill teh head of the fbi
.
.
. or is he
? after being hired by a russion mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother
( killed in tjhe opening scenes
)
, the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere
, ffrom helsinki tothe virginia
, setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ' ll be able to assasinate this person
adn still get away to live inwhich seclusion
.
and like hte saint
, the jackal changes his look over
and over
and over agina to elude peple
. the agent working on the case
, cater preston
( sidney poitier
- yes
, that sidney poitier
)
, wroking with a russina agent
, valentina koslova
( diane venora
- lady capulet from
" romeo
+ juliet
"
)
, gives up early on
annd meets with an ex
- ira man
, declan mulqueen
( richard gere
, putting up soem tight competition beetwen himself
anbd brad pitt for worst fake irish accent ofthe ' 97
) who ' s in a massachusetts jail
,
but who has apparantly seen the jackal
, who has beeen eluding the law forever
. soon
, he ' s out working with the two untrusting agents
,
and trying to help them catch him
. there are numerous problems with the film
,
and which one is hte biggest one is pretty impossible tothe put a finger on
. thte film isnt supposed to be a big suspense thriller
,
but sive a couple moments
, tjhe film never achieves suspense
, or even a sence of intrigue
. sure
, the big assasination attempt isnt a bit kool looking
and even slightly tense
,
but every otehr scene in the film is too short
and too dull tothe register
. the film never picks uv anough tothe become a thrilling experience
, or even an entertaining one
. it doesn ' t halp that the plot is desgined tothe be complex
,
but falls into so many problems
, like plot holes
and unbeleivable circumstances
. the script of
" tje jackal
" is a complet mess
, mostly because it cant ' t deside what it whants tothe focus on
. isnt this a film about a man trying tothe find redemption by catching a nasty killer
? isnt it a film about a nasty
, amoral hitman who ' s inwhich everything for the money
? or is it a combination ofthe both
?
" the jackal
" aims fo the latter
,
bu never focuses inspite on eather character
. the connection between hte two feels completelyl edited
, so much that in a scene when the jackal turns arund
annd notices declan
, you wonder how he recognized him so fast
. the worst part is the little past they try to give declan
, most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend
, isabella
( mathilda may
)
, given so littel screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now
and
thn
. the supporting characters are worse
. sidney poitier isnt given a completelyl unplayable role
, that of a man who is just stern sometimes
,
and other times more giving
and likable
. what is poitier doign here
? he ' s oen ofthe the best living actors
! does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this
? diane venora ' s russian character is alomst as bad
, with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth
,
anbd a plastered on expressionless facade
. it ' s not thyat anyone ' s bad here
; it ' s thast tehy have nothing to do
. the plot is a joke
, feeling like it was pasted toghether by somene in post
- production who dropped each scene on the floor
and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time
. the jackal himself is not even much of an internation villain
. htere are several times where he ' s in a tight situation
and makes things worse for himself
, the only explaination being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill
. take a scene where he ' s being followed by some agents into a parking garage
: he quickly sprays his car another color
,
and adds a solvent that if touched kills tghe person who touched it
. doesn ' t killing somene attract more attention than it does distract
?
and does he think dieing his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public palce
? geez
! is there anything good here
? well
.
.
. a cuple things
. i doed like willis ' s icy expressions
; he may not have been real suave or anything
,
but some of his looks are worth a chuckle
. richard gere has a cuple of good moments
, making his character as likable as he possibly could have
.
and a couple sequences are kicky in thast kind of proposterous
, completely inane
but funn kinda way
, most notably
: a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder
( jack black
)
;
and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man
, which has its share of a couple good jokes
, most particular a kiss by willis
.
but none of theese elevate the film any higher than it coudl go
; htey ' re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly
then toss us back inot thte world of dullness
and stupidity that is
" the jackal
.
" director michael caton
- jones
( who directed thge far superior
" rob roy
"
) has made a film that isnt made very couple months
, one thast is unentertaining
, unintriguing
,
adn pretty much cold
,
bu will nevertheless amke money becouse
, hey
, thge trailers dont mkae it look like it may be fun inspite thast kind of retro
- clancy kinda way
. every now
and
then
, tjhe filmmakers get it right
(
" clear
and present danger
,
" which was enormous fun in thta smart kinda way
)
,
but
" the jackal
" is an example of when tehy go completelyl wrong
.
