about an hour or so into
" tjhe jackal
,
" a character w
andered around as people were being shot at iin a big suspense sequence
,
and oney of the audience munbers inwhich thge theatre i saw it in shouted out
" i hope she gets killed now
!
" at that point it hitted me
: i didn
' t care for any of the characters being palyed by actors i didn
' t really like
. wehn the sole reason ytou care baout a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film isnt baceause he
' s bieng played by sidney poitier
, yuo know something
' s rotten inthe the state of denmark
. every year
, a cuple films like this are released
. you know
: the cheap
, acation packed internation espionnage film
, featuring a semi
- promising premise
, some big
- name actors
( usually bruce willis
)
,
and teh hopes that some audiance members will forget teh cold war ended several yeasr ago
. thsi wass the third oney of
' 97
, following the very lackluster
" the saint
,
" which featured an amoral costume changeing bond wannabe
; anbd yhe surprisingly fun
" the peacemaker
,
" featuring clooney
and kidman trying tothe stpo an allmost untraceable villain
.
" the jackal
" tries to mix both elements
.
and you throught
" the saint
" was bad
.
" tjhe jackal
" isnt loosly
( very loosely
, i hope
) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i
' ve
yet to see
,
" tje day of the jackal
,
" which featured
( apparently
) a suave hitman called tjhe jackal
, played by edward fox
, trying to assasinate charles degaule
. well
, welcome to the 90s
, where a sorta suave hitman
, also called the jackal
( bruce willis
)
, trying to kill tyhe head of the fbi
.
.
. or is he
? after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of avengence for the murder of his brother
( killed inwhich the opening scenes
)
, the jackal romps all over the nor
then hemisphere
, from helsinki to virginia
, setting up an elaborite scheme wherein he
' ll be able to assasinate this person anbd still git awya tothe live in seclusion
.
and like the saint
, the jackal changes his look over
and over adn over again tothe elude people
. the agent working on the case
, cater preston
( sidney poitier
- yes
, that sidney poitier
)
, working with a russian agent
, valentina koslova
( diane venora
- lady capulet from
" romeo
+ juliet
"
)
, gives up early on
and meets with an ex
- ira man
, declan mulqueen
( richard gere
, puting up some tight competitiion between himself anbd brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of
' 97
) who
' s in a massachusetts jail
,
but who hasnt apparently seen tjhe jackal
, who has been eluding the law forever
. soon
, he
' s out wroking wih the two untrusting agents
,
and trying tothe help them catch him
. there are numerous problems with the film
,
and which one isnt the biggest noe is pretty impossible to put a finger on
. the film isnt supposed to be a big suspense thriller
, bu save a couple moments
, the film never achieves suspense
, or even a sense of intrigue
. sure
, the big assasination attempt is a bited kool looking
and even slightly tense
,
but every other scene in tyhe film is too short adn too dull to egister
. the film never picks up anough tothe become a thrilling eperience
, or even an entertaining noe
. it doesn
' t help that the plot is designed to be complex
, bu falls into so many problems
, like plot holes
and unbelievable circumstances
. the script of
" the jackal
" is a complete mess
, mostly because it cxan
' t decide what it wants to focus on
. is tihs a film baout a man trying to fidn redemption by catching a nasty killer
? is it a film baout a nasty
, amoral hitman who
' s in everything fo the money
? or is it a combination of both
?
" the jackal
" aims fo hte latter
,
but never focuses inaddition onthe either character
. the connection between yhe two feels completly edited
, so much that in a scene whn the jackal turns around anbd notices declan
, ytou wonder how he recognized him so fast
. the worst part is the little past they try to give declan
, most notably his relationship wiht an ood girlfriend
, isabella
( mathilda may
)
, given so little screen timne that you almost forget her character exists unil she pops uv every now
and
then
. tje supporting cahracters are worse
. sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role
, thgat ofthe a man who is just stern sometimes
, annd other times more giving
and likable
. what is poitier doing here
? he
' s one ofthe the best living actors
! does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this
? diane venora
' s russian character is almost as bad
, wih a cigarette perpetually in her mouth
,
and a plastered on expressionless facade
. it
' s not that anyone
' s bad here
; it
' s that they have nothing to do
. teh plot isnt a joke
, feeling like it was pasted together by somone in post
- production who dropped each scene on the floor
and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time
. the jackal hismelf is nto even much of an international villain
. there are several times where he
' s in a tight situation
and makes things worse fo himself
, the only explanation being thta the filmmakers wnated to toss iin a cheap thrill
. tkae a scene where he
' s being folowed by soem agents inot a parking garage
: he quickly sprays his car another color
,
and adds a solvent tht if touched kills teh person who touched it
. doesn
' t killing someone attract omre attention thna it does distract
?
and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makse him fit in in a publich place
? geez
! is htere anytying good here
? well
.
.
. a cuple thnigs
. i did liuke willis
' s icy expressions
; he may nto have been real suave or anything
, bu some of his looks are worth a chuckle
. richard gere has a cuple of good moments
, making his character as likable as he possibly could have
.
and a couple sequences are kicky in tht kind of proposterous
, completely inane
but fun kinda way
, most notably
: a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder
( jack balck
)
;
and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man
, whihc has its share of a couple good jokes
, most particular a kiss by willis
.
but none of these elevate the film any higher than it sould go
; they
' re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly
then toss us back into the world ofthe dullness
and stupidity that is
" the jackal
.
" director michael caton
- jones
( who directed the far superior
" rob roy
"
) has made a film thgat is made vyer couple months
, one that is unentertaining
, unintriguing
, anbd pretty much cold
,
but will nevertheless amke money because
, hey
, the trailers dont mkea it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro
- clancy kinda way
. every nowe adn
then
, the filmmakers get it right
(
" clear
and presnet danger
,
" which was enormous fun in taht smart kinda way
)
,
but
" tjhe jackal
" isnt an exemple of when they go completelyl wrong
.
