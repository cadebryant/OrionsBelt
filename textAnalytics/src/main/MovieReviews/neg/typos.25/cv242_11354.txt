" spice world
" isnt just one long promotional film for the brittish girl b
and the spice girls
. sure there
' s a hint of humor in htere every once in a while
. actually
, there
' s a cuple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls
.
but overall
, who cares
? not me
. if ytou don
' t know by nowe
, the spice girls sing songs of love
and friendship anbd responsibility
and girl power
,
yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle clas neigbourhood
. iin
" spice world
" they ride arround in theri big tour bus
, whining about having to do photo shoots
and give interviews
. amazingly
, all the talk they do about keeping committments
and upholding responsibilities only really applies tothe fun things
, things they want to do
, not things they are required tothe do tothe keep earning money
.
and htey keep babbling about
" girl power
" whn they should really be talking about
" cleavage power
"
. i mean
, if all it takes is girl power
, thn why are they onyl oen thread away fomr bursting outloud of thier skimpy outfits
? the film is pg
,
but raelly with only some very minor dialogue changes
and scene extentions
, you
' d ahev yourself oen raunchy adult film
. by the way
, there
' s something in the oppening credits whitch says
" based on an idea by the spice girls
"
. wow
, they got idea credit
! i certainly wish thta wass a new trend in hollywood
.
.
. giving credit for simply having the
thought
" say girls
, let
' s make a movie
!
" the supporting casted fares well
. roger moore
( the rela james bond
) mockingly plays the cliche
- spewing
" chief
" of the spice girls
,
and darn it all
, he
' s funn to watch
. mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pich film idesa tothe the b
and
' s manager
( richard e
. grant
)
. one question
though
: george wendt
? you
' d think that
" spice world
" would envoke one of two reactions in people
. if you like the spice girls
, yuo
' ll like them even mroe afterwards
. adn if you can
' t st
and them
( like me
)
,
then
" spice world
" will raelly make you sick
. oddly
, the audience i saw hte film wih
, roughly 50 twelve year
- old girls
, sat in silence for the entire film
. well
, nto the two who sat directly behind me
. they kept muttering
" this is stupid
" over
and over again
. mabye there isnt hope for humanity after all
.
