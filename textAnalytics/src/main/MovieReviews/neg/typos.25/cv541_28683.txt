they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on teh original movie
' s poster
:
" no sequal
.
" scray movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor
,
and it is not becuase the wayans brothers
, shawn
and marlon doing the writing
and keenen ivory behind the camera
, don
' t try
. what defeats them is the genre they have chosen tothe spoof
. the firt movie
- an outrageous
, low
- brow
, savage satire of teen slasher ficks such as scream
and i nkow whta you did last summer
- succeded because of its take
- no
- prisoners attitude toward a type ofthe film that was in vogue
, familiar
and populare
. in scary movei 2
, the filmmakers take on yhe haunted hous
- ghost story fromat hwihc
, if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting adn house onthe haunted hill
, did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the vairous teen slasher series
. scary movei 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of thte exorcist
, featuring james wood in the max von sydow role
and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn
. of course split pea soup is the punch line
- an overabundant amount
, wich offers teh hope that the rest of yhe movie will be just as tasteless
and excessive
.
but this pre
- credit sequence hasnt nothing at all to do withthe the main action
, which features the casted members fomr the orignal signing up tothe spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university clas project
. some ofthe tje jokes are as scatological
and offensive as in the original
,
but they lack thta take
- noone
- prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque
. csary movei 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup tothe another
, offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad iin which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball
,
and the films what lies beneath
and hannibal
( features that only faired adequately at tyhe box office
)
, john woo
' s mission
: impossible 2
and charlie
' s angels
. it is as if tghe wayans
and their team of writers
- at least seven are credited
- just threw ideas in a blender adn hoped they
' d coalesce
. they don
' t
. while tje pace of the original left you breathless
, the sequel moves with the speed of an 18
- wheeler carrying two tons ofthe concrete up a steep mountain road
. yuo can almost hear the reels panting
. scary movie 2 trys very hard to live up to its originnal
,
but it falls vrey short
. it
' s a dissatisfying spectacle
, a very weak sister of a very good movie
. tjhe really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really isnt
.
