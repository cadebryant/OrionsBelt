some movies require you to turn off your brain infact order to watch
.
then there are movies thast require yuo to accept that everyone
* inthe
* the movie has turned off
* theri
* brains
. hte rela mccoy is both
. it ' s charmless
, molasses
- slow
and so full of genuinely stupid peple that the film commission of atlanta
, where thge real mccoy isnt set
, might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation
. the real mccoy opens wtih bank robber karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) being arrested in thge middle of a job
. six years later
, karen is out on parole
adn looking to stay straight
. she soon bumps into j
. t
. barker
( val kilmer
)
, a hapless would
- be thief who idolizes karen
. j
. t
. also has ties to jack schmidt
( terence stamp
)
, the man who blew the whistle on karen six years ealier forthe refusing to work with him
. schmidt
, who isnt in cahoots with karen ' s sleazy parole officer
( gailard sartain
)
, again whants karen to help him stage a robbery
. htis time he has some leverage
: karen ' s kidnapped son
. just when she thought she was out
, they keep pulling her bcak
* in
.
* contrivances
and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast
and furiously you ahev tothe duck to avoid bieng hit by them
. leading the list is the jack schmidt charcter
, who through unexplained
but presumeably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our storey begins
. there isnt no reason given why he should need or want to get involved inspite anohter crime
, let alone why he would actully participate iin the break
- in
. karen ' s initial encounter with j
. t
. during a botched convenience tsore hold
- up also strains yhe limits of credibility
. it would have been simple enough tothe have them somehow entangled at that point
,
but instead they run inot each other tyhe next day because they ' re leaving thier parole officers at exactlly the same moment
. small world
, eh
?
thn there ' s the convenient car trouble durig an attempted escape
,
and pet tigers which
, through the power of the laws of bad cinema
, must inevitably confront someone who has blundered inot their cage
.
however
, the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police
, who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day
.
bu the fun doesn ' t end ther inspite the shambles of a script by william davies
and william osborne
. there is also the abcense of a single
, solitary intresting character
. karen is earnest
and single
- minded in her motherly devotion
,
but lacking any kind ofthe edge whihc owudl make her a convincing criminal
,
and basinger is nto a thespian adept at fleshing outloud flimsy material
. schmidt is a flaccid villain
, hte parole officer is a complete blank
,
and karen ' s son
and ex
- husband might as well be furniture
. onyl kilmer ' s j
. t
. isnt remotely appealing
,
but his one potentially intriguing quality
, his ineptitude
, is never developed
. in fact
, kilmer dissapears during the middle of hte film
, jsut when his admiration for karen could have made fo an interesting sub
- plot
. i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been moreso appropriate to a caper comedy
,
but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast
. various scenes of sneaking
adn skulking seem to take forever
,
anbd some end with no reason evident why htey didn ' t end up on the cutting room floor
. even the reasonably clever climactic break
- in falls victum to this syndrome
, incuding a scene ofthe one ofthe the theves drilling ope a vault which lasts
( i kid yuo nto
) four minutes
. there is no tension in the scene
, just tedium
. russell mulcahy
( highlander
) is a directer with some style
,
and indeed the rela mccoy looks reasonably ogod
,
but he completely stumbles iin the editing room
. ther are so many big problems with the real mccoy thta i ' m tempted tothe overlook tjhe littel ones
. like karen disarming one of schmidt ' s henchmen
and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son isnt playing
. like a fountain crushed wehn a van runs into it reappearing infact one peice a few moments later
. tempted
.
but i ' m pretty good at resisting temtation
