ever since wargames
, the first rela coputer hacking movie
, hollywood has attempted to produce moreso
and more films about hacking
. these films usally sohw the audeince a look into computers that raelly is nto impossible
and isnt usually ridiculous
. if it
' s nto htis
, the exaggeration baout what isnt real isnt usually greater than you owudl expect
. hackers is guilty of all of these crimes
. to anyone familliar withthe computers
and
/ or the internet
, most of the movei is so incredibly stupid that you can
' t take it anymore
. thsoe of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web
, the internet movie database
, are propably aware of the section for movies entitled
" goofs
"
. htis is the section for mistakes iin the movies
. well
, imdb sums up hackers extrememly well iwth tje first goof listed
:
" generaly ill
- informed
and ridiculous tothe thge extreme regarding thge capabilites ofthe computers
and technolgy
"
.
and truthfully
, htis is oney
- hundered percent correct
. tje plot
, obviously
, centers around computer hacking
. more specifically
, it follows the exploits ofthe dade murphy
, a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller
. miller should be extremly thankful for the film trainspotting
, because if it were not for tyhat
, who knows where his carrer would be now after hackers
. tghe film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems
. he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old
. tyhe film
then picks up at that point
, an eighteen year ood dade murphy hacking away at the computer
. dade later meets uv with fellow hackers acid burn
( angelina jolie
)
, cereal killer
( matthew lillard
)
, lord nikon
( laurence mason
)
,
and the phantom phreak
( renoly santiago
)
, who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible
: hack the gibson computer annd not git caught by the fbi
. oh
,
and as a little sub
- plot
, dade also tries tothe woo acid burn
, yhe onyl female hacker inwhich the film
. really
, i cxan
' t tihkn ofthe much more to sday about the film
' s plot aside fomr what i
' ve said
. it
' s just a bunch of computer geeks
( no
, obsessive compulsive coputer geeks a little too adavanced for reality
) running arround hacking computers
and staying away from the fbi
. thanks tothe this movei
, the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint ofthe computers
and what tehy can do
. tihs movie makse computers look a little bited too advanced fo theri time
,
and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many tothe list
. to sum it uv
, hackers is a terrible cmoputer film
. if yuo
' re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes onthe in yhe real world
, i suggest sneakers
.
al
though at times it too may seem a littel far fetched
, it should be much mroe believable tahn hackers to regluar coputer users
. hopefully
, this film didn
' t influence too many young computer users outloud to think they cin do what is protrayed in this 105 minute waste of time
.
