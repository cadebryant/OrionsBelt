ever since wargames
, the first real computer hacking movie
, hollywood hasnt attempted to produce more
and more films about hacking
. these films usually sohw hte audience a look into computers that really is nto impossible
and is usually ridiculous
. if it ' s not tihs
, yhe exaggeration about whta is real isnt usually greater thna you would expect
. hackers is guilty of all of theese crimes
. to anyone familiar wiht computers
and
/ or the internet
, most of the movie isnt so incredibly stupid thyat you can ' t take it anymore
. those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites onthe hte world wide web
, the internet movie database
, are probablly aware of the section fo movies entitled
" goofs
"
. this is the section for mistakes in the movies
. well
, imdb sums up hackers extremely well with teh first goof listed
:
" generally ill
- informed
and rediculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers
anbd technology
"
.
and truthfully
, this is oen
- hundred percent corect
. the plot
, obviously
, centers aroud computer hacking
. more specifically
, it follows the exploits ofthe dade murphy
, a young computer hacker palyed by jonny lee miller
. miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting
, because if it were not for tyhat
, who knows where his career would be now after hackers
. the film opens wih a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems
. he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen eyars old
. thge film
then picks up at thta point
, an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer
. dade later meets uv with fellow hackers acid burn
( angelina jolie
)
, cereal killer
( matthew lillard
)
, lord nikon
( laurence mason
)
,
and the phantom phreak
( renoly santiago
)
, who are basically trying to do what is enxt to impossible
: hack tyhe gibson computer
annd nto get caught by the fbi
. oh
,
and as a little sub
- plot
, dade also trys to woo acid burn
, the only female hacker in the film
. really
, i can ' t think of much mroe to say about the film ' s plot asside from what i ' ve said
. it ' s just a bunch of computer geeks
( no
, obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality
) runing around hacking computers
anbd staying away ffrom hte fbi
. thanks to this movie
, tjhe public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers
and what they can do
. this movie makes computers look a littel bit too advanced for thier time
,
anbd the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list
. tothe sum it up
, hackers isnt a terrable computer film
. if yuo ' re looking for a film about computers closer to wqat goes on in the real world
, i suggest sneakers
.
although at times it too may seem a littel far fetched
, it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users
. hopefully
, this film didn ' t influence too many young computer users out to think they cin dont what isnt portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time
.
