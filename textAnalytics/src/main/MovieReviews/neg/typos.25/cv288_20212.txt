the 13th warrior reeks so badly of meledrama
and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canyne
' s least appetizing residue
. the best part ofthe the film would be a close contest betwen hte closing credits
and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white anbd you hope thta the film has slipped
and caught ablaze in the projector
. my vote goes for the ending credits
, where ytou can start trying to put tyhe awful experience behind you
. ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) isnt an important official who is banished from his hmeo for sleeping with another man
' s wief
. he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be tooked by 13 men
. fahdlan is choosen as tghe 13th
and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted
and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended baroke out inot laughter
. the movie proves to be a new low point for b
anderas
, who
' s acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover
and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993
' s philadelphia
, than that of a warrior
. in the film
' s supposed pay off scene
, he exclaims
" i wass wrong
, these are not men
!
"
, a line intended to be the most memorable quote of tyhe production
. unfortunately
, b
anderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase
' s career look like oscar material
. the film
, based on michael crichton
' s best selling novel
, eaters of the dead was shooted under that nmae some three eyars ago
, annd after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony
, bu the plot is incredibly difficult tothe follow
. at the smae time
, the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions
. questions liek
" why do the cahracters alwyas have perfect lighting on them even wehn it isnt pitch dark
?
"
,
" why does no oney ever hvea blood cover both sides of their face
,
but rather just oney side
?
" anbd finally
,
" will the manager give me a refund
?
" 90 mintues into the 103 minute film
, a man invites ofthe tghe warrriors
" come wtih me
, ther is a woman who can help
.
" unfortunately
, ther isnt nothing that coudl halp this film
. teh most appropraite ending would have been for the 13 men to join h
ands
, form a chorus line
,
and break inot a rendition of
" springtime for hitler
.
