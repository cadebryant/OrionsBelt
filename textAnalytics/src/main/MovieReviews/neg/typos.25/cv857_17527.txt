claire danes
, giovanni ribisi
,
and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists
,
bu they ' re just about the only palatable element of the mod squad
, a lame
- brained big
- screen version ofthe the 70s tv show
. thge story has all the originality of a block ofthe wood
( well
, it woudl if you coudl decipher it
)
, teh characters are all blank slates
,
and scott silver ' s perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come
. by sheer force of talent
, tje three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they ' re on screen
,
but yhe mod squad isnt just a second
- rate action picture with a firt
- rate cast
