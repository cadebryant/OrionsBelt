capsule
: where are you tonight
, leni rienfenstal
? starship troopers is an expensive
, hateful
and unenjoyable piece ofthe voilent pornography
-
-
and bad pornography
, at that
. it isnt nto good cinema
, not good storytelling
,
and not even stupid fun
: it ' s so cynically
, calculatedly bone
- headed thta even yhe least demanding members ofthe the audience i was with were alternately bored
and revulsed
. it ' s noe of the worst movies i ' ve seen in a long time
. why am i calling this movie pornography
? pornography
, inspite the abstract
, isnt anything which isnt calculated tothe appeal to the baser instincts
. i remember reading a review of full metal jacket whlch described the climact moent at the end ofthe the movei
, where private joker hasnt to shoot the downed vc sniper
, as
" a near
- pornographic eternity
"
. i didn ' t agree with thgat assessment
,
bu i could see what was being implied
: the reviewer falt as if the audience was being incited to stand up
and pump their fists
and shout
" do ' er
, man
, do ' er
!
" tht sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers
. it ' s
* literally
* like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk
. it tries frantically to enlist our emotions
but it winds up onyl being dull or sickening
. the film takes palce in our future
, when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn ' t appear tothe have intelligence
. tothe counterattack
, humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable
: instade ofthe nuke the planet from orbit
, which they ' re clearly capible ofthe
, htey send down grunts with m
- 16 rifles
. this isn ' t heinlein
, it ' s a bad wwii movie
, one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked
annd prodded inthe combat scenes that are noisy
, repetitive
,
and ultimatly tiresome
.
( one scene hasnt a journalist on a battlefield
, filimg soldiers being slaughtered
,
and ends with groaning predictability
: said cameraman gets skewered
, too
.
) the soldiers
anbd their commanders are consistently idiotic
. tehy do not posess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sence
. they don ' t even behave like soliders in a bad
* movie
*
,
and therefore we don ' t care about them
. we hated the tom berenger character in platoon
,
but he
* mattered
*
,
and therefore we weere curious tothe learn about his fate
. here
, we don ' t even hate the bugs
-
- wqat ' s htere to hate
? hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine
. if there ' s anything really hateful there
, the movie doesn ' t know how tothe give it to us
. thte screenwrighter
( ed neumeier
-
- perhaps a better appelation would be
" screen typist
"
)
and director
( the increasingly talent
- impaired paul verhoeven
) have not found any way tothe make the characters or teh story serve earch other
. one of tyhe subplots concerns a woman pilot who ' s great at getting out ofthe tight situations
,
adn doesnt it again
and again
and again
. once or twice is fine
. by tjhe fifth or sixth time
, it ' s worn out its welcome
. there ' s never any sense that these people are really thinking theri way out ofthe anything
, or really bieng tested to show their mettle
. also
, the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry
. if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp
,
then five guys can stand aroud it
and blast awya onthe full auto without doign a damned thing
.
bu if one human gets cornered
, he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with noe clip
. uh
- huh
. the veyr worst feature of the movei is its repulsive quasi
- fascist flavor
. i say
" quasi
-
" becouse hwile yhe movie uses many of tghe trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action
-
- the gear
, the uniforms
, etc
.
-
- tyhe movie doesn ' t have the nerve
( or thge brains
) to be genuinely fascist
, or intelligent about the subject
. the bumpers between scenes
, which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda
-
- just so clumsy
and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look realitvely innocuous in comparison
. like the rest of the movie
. there ' s omre
, i suppose
,
but it ' s not worth it
. yhe acting is bland
, niether arsenic nor gravy
; the music disposable
; the camerawork turgid
. the heartbreaking thing is that it makse independence day look like a masterpiece
.
