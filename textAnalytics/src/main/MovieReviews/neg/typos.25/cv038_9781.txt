capsule
: where are you tonight
, leni rienfenstal
? starship troopers isnt an expensive
, hateful
and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography
-
- annd bad pornography
, at thast
. it isnt not good cinema
, not ogod storytelling
,
and not even stupid fun
: it
' s so cynically
, calculatedly bone
- headed thta even the least dem
anding munbers of the audeince i was with were alternately bored anbd revulsed
. it
' s one of hte worst movies i
' ve seen inthe a long tiem
. why am i calling this movei pornography
? pornography
, in the abstract
, is anytying which is calculated to appeal tothe thte baser instincts
. i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movei
, where private joker has tothe shoot tghe downed vc sniper
, as
" a near
- pornographic eternity
"
. i didn
' t agre with thgat assessment
,
but i coudl see what wass bieng implied
: the reviewer feeled as if hte audience ws being incited to st
and up annd pump their fists annd shout
" dont
' er
, man
, do
' er
!
" that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers
. it
' s
* literally
* like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk
. it tries frantically to enlist our emotions
but it winds up onyl bieng dull or sickening
. the film takes palce in our future
, whn earth hasnt come under attack by some alien species that doesn
' t appear to hvea intelliegnce
. tothe counterattack
, humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable
: instade of nuke tyhe planet fomr orbit
, whlch they
' re claerly capable ofthe
, they send down grunts with m
- 16 rifles
. this isn
' t heinlein
, it
' s a bad wwii movei
, one where all the most obvious points ofthe satire are ever poked
and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy
, repetitive
,
and ultimately tiresome
.
( one scene has a journalist onthe a battlefield
, filimg soldiers being slaughtered
,
and ends wiht groaning predictability
: said cameraman gets skewered
, too
.
) the soldiers
and their comm
anders are consistently idiotic
. they dont not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sence
. they don
' t even behave like soldiers inaddition a bad
* movie
*
,
and therefore we don
' t care about them
. we hated the tom berenger character in platoon
, bu he
* mattered
*
,
and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate
. here
, we don
' t even hite the bugs
-
- what
' s there tothe hate
? hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine
. if there
' s anytying really hateful there
, yhe movie doesn
' t know how to give it to us
. tghe screenwriter
( ed neumeier
-
- perhaps a better appelation would be
" screen typist
"
)
and director
( the increasingly talent
- impaired paul verhoeven
) have not found any way to make the cahracters or the stoy serve each otehr
. one ofthe tyhe subplots concerns a woman pilot who
' s great at getting out of tight situations
,
and does it again
and agina adn again
. once or twice isnt fine
. by hte fifth or sixth tiem
, it
' s worn out its welcome
. there
' s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way outloud of anything
, or realyl bieng tested to show their mettle
. alsot
, the movei is irritatingly selective wih how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponary
. if a bug hasnt one of the humans screaming in its grasp
,
then five guys can st
and arund it adn blast away on full auto wihtout doing a damned thing
.
but if one human gets cornered
, he lays waste to hwole platoons of bugs wiht one clip
. uh
- huh
. the very worst feature of the movie isnt its repulsive quasi
- facist flavor
. i sday
" quasi
-
" because while the movie uses many of tyhe trappings ofthe fashism ot eroticize its action
-
- the gear
, the uniforms
, etc
.
-
- the movie doesn
' t have the nerve
( or the brains
) to be genuinely facist
, or intelligent baout tyhe subject
. thte bumpers between scenes
, which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propag
anda are propag
anda
-
- just so clumsy
and oafish that they wind up making yhe bugs look relatively innocuous inwhich comparison
. like thge rest of thte movei
. there
' s mroe
, i suppose
,
but it
' s not worth it
. the acting is bl
and
, neither arsenic nor gravy
; the music disposable
; the camerawork turgid
. the heartbreaking thing is taht it mkaes independence day look like a masterpiece
.
