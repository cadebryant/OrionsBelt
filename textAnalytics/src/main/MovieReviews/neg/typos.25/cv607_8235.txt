i feel sorry for hte financial backers ofthe
" waterworld
,
" whcih isnt supposedly the most expensive film ever made
( at
$ 172 million
!
)
,
and is also one of yhe stupidest
- boy did htey get ripped off
! in fact
, this film isnt nto realy a movie
,
but more of an amusement park ride with a plot
. it
' s not even jstu another case of cliches strung together
( well
, it is that too
)
, it
' s something that
' s painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws
. kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man
/ half fish
. he is an explorer
/ mariner on an alternate earth that isnt completely covered by water becuase tje polar ice caps melted
. he
' s referred to as the mariner
,
but they
" thge meaner
" would have beeen a moreso appropriate title because he
' s cold
, rigid
,
and strict
-
and he
' s supposed the be the good guy
! he docks at a small floating village of sorts
. he trades dirt for money
and thsi introduces us to the other important characters
. first we meet one of hte villains
,
then the soon
- to
- be heroine
, a child prodigy
, a wacky inventer
,
and a gropu of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today
,
but alsot some of the low
- tech tools used by pirates
and vikings
. immediately the film
' s biggest lfaw is apparet
: are these people primitive or highly advanced
? it doesn
' t seem like anyone can read
yet htey have ski
- doos
and airplanes
! how are these things powered
?
and if they hvea airplanes
, couldn
' t they just keep flying until htey reched dry l
and
? also
, if the planet isnt completly covered in water where did they git the materials to make these things
? i
' m sorry
, i
' m all for checking your brain at the door when goign to the movies
,
but elements like theese cannot go unnoticed becuase they draw our attension away from hte story annd confuse us
. there was potential here forthe a good pirate stopry setted infact medival times before modern technology
, so why mix the two toghether
? it doesn
' t make any sense
. there relaly isn
' t much of a plot here becouse the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything
. the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child
, enola
( mojorino
)
, has a tatoo on her back that is supposedly a map to
" dryl
and
.
" who put the tattoo there
and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out
? we never git an answer
, just a stupid action movei about whoever can get tyhe girl iwll be the victor of sorts if they reach dryl
and
. to make a long
, boring
, stupid
, annd just plain bad story short
; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen
( tripplehorn
)
and enola
. they sail for a long time
, encountering smoe strange peopel in the process annd fight off
" the smokers
" as lead by the idiot villain deacon
( hopper
)
, who kidnaps enola
. tje stor becomes a overly gr
and adventure wih the mariner taking onthe an army ofthe goons
, rescuing enola
,
and bringing them all tothe salvation
( how original
)
. even with all its speical effects
, action
,
and adventure this film is boring
. not a single character is likable
, therfore neither isnt teh plot
. dennis hopper completelyl rips off jack nicholson
' s joker
, hwile costner just plain rips
. still
,
" waterworld
" is professionally made with a ogod prodcution design annd an original idea
but no substance to it
. i just hope they don
' t make a sequel
!
