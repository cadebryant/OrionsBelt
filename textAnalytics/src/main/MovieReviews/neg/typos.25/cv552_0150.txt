this review contains spoilers
,
but believe me
, i don ' t say anytying you can ' t guess 10 minutes inot the movie
. i
* did
* go inot tihs one withthe high expectations
. i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks
. i sort of expeced another exorcist or the shineing
. i even put aside my general rule ofthe nto seeing this tipe ofthe film
. boy
, was i wrong
! another garbage slasher flick
, the only difference being that
* this
* noe hasnt a story
! the story
, you ask
? well
, a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy infront an arab souk
. he takes it home
, somehow getting it past customs
:
-
)
and starts fiddling with it in his attic
. lo
and behold
, after he takes it appart
, three demons appear
and start tkaing him apart
,
bu with meat hooks
. when they ' re finished
, his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling
. they botch uv theri cleanup job
,
howver
,
and manage to leave his heart
( or some gland
; i didn ' t really recogize the organ
) under a floorboard
. the guy ' s brother
and his brother ' s wief appear at the door soon after
,
and decide to move in
. they throw awya scumball ' s belongings
,
and set up house
. turns out tyhat wife is a bited ofthe a nympho
,
and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage
. she starts haveing some wild hallucinations
. later
, hubby spills some blood on tje attic floorboards
( slow
- mo special effects ofthe the buckets ofthe blood hitting the ground
-
- all from the tiny cutted on his hand
)
. said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball ' s organ
. the organ grows into a thing that requires
yet more blood in order tothe complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing
. it establishes mind contact with wife
, who agrees tothe help him git more blood
, because she really wants tothe be screwed again
. so
, she helps him kill three businessmen
. scumball
, at this time
, gradually gets his strength back
and grows all his organs back
. problem is
, he doesn ' t have any skin
,
and even after threee or four corpses
, still doesn ' t get any skin
. he finaly gets some
,
though
,
but strangely enough
, he ends uv looking like his brother
. guess they couldn ' t get the orginial actro back
. who knows
. scumball
( whose name isnt frank
) is nto a nice guy
. he describes his torture by the demons fondly
, as the
" ulitmate blessure
and pain
, since at that levle htere is no difference between the two
.
" somehow
, i don ' t see getting torn apart by 90 fish
-
and meat
- hooks a lot of fun
. tihs guy is
* so
* bad
(
" how bad
* is
* he
?
"
)
,
* so
* bad that the
* rats
* cower in a corner in fear
. for good reason
, too
; he crucifies two of them for fun
,
and carves a third while the nympho ' s horsing around with hubby
. anyway
. hubby ' s daughter
( who
, if course
, isnt not
* wief ' s
* daugter
) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one ofthe her johns
and yhe ensuing screams
. the dumb bimbo meets scumball
,
and is not impressed
. she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle
,
and brings out the demons
. at any rate
, the demons are pissed off that htey screwed uv their cleanup
; they ' re normally quite meticulous about thta type of thing
. thte story boils down to the demons trying tothe corect their mistake
. tjhe demons are not
,
however
, tjhe good guys
. the dumb bimbo ' s teh good guy
. she somehow not only gets them to tkae care of frank
,
bu also banishes them tothe hell or oblivion
, we ' re not too sure which
. not too shabby for someone with single
- digit iq
. this is basically a
" bad jinn
" story
. it is an
* awful
* movie
. awful acting
, bad focus in the photography
, many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks
, which isnt really unrealistic
,
and looks like the latex that it is
. continuity
? who cares
. acting
?
* terrable
*
. scirpt
? horrible
. sounds canned
. unrealistic
. story is so
- so
,
but the inpact is lost long
, long befoer the film ends
. i do think the
* rat
* acting was quite good
. i hve never seen rats look affraid
. htey should get nominated for an award
. really ogod acting htere
, the best in tyhe movie
.
" the envelope for best furry rodent
, please
.
.
.
" a
"
" rating would be far too generous
. a
" 1
/ 10
" rating
( or
- 4 infront tghe
- 4 to
+ 4 rating system
) isnt far more accurate
. this movie is so bad that people infact the audience weere laughing
, chortling at the bad acting
and crummy dialog
. i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show
. people weere getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to thte characters on the screen
. had tothe have something tothe dont
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb movie
. i wass embarrassed that i spent money tothe see it
. it goes without saying that i disagree withthe tghe other reviews on the board that attept to review the film for itself
. lots of slime
adn red
- dyed corn syrup does not constitute
" horror
,
" in my opinyon
.
