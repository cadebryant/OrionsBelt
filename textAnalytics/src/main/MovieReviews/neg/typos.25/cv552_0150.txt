htis review contains spoilers
,
but believe me
, i don
' t sday anything ytou can
' t guess 10 minutes into the movie
. i
* did
* go inot this one with high expectations
. i had beeen exposed to media reports thta htis film would signify a departure fomr tjhe slasher ficks
. i sort of expeced anohter exorcist or the shining
. i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film
. boy
, was i wrong
! another garbage slasher flick
, tjhe only difference being that
* this
* one has a story
! the story
, yuo ask
? well
, a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk
. he takes it home
, somehow getting it past customs
:
-
) anbd starts fiddling with it in his attic
. lo
and behold
, after he takes it apart
, three demons apear
and start taking him apart
,
but with meat hoeks
. when they
' re finished
, his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling
. htey botch up thier cleanup job
,
however
,
and manage to leave his heart
( or soem gl
and
; i didn
' t really recognize thge organ
) under a floorboard
. the guy
' s brother
and his brother
' s wife appear at tyhe door soon after
,
and decide tothe move in
. they throw away scumball
' s belongings
,
and set up house
. turns out that wief is a bited ofthe a nympho
,
and screwed arund with scumball right before her marriage
. she starts haveing smoe wild hallucinations
. later
, hubby spills some blood onthe the attic floorboards
( slow
- mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground
-
- all from the tiny cutted on his h
and
)
. said blood isnt eagerly sucked up by scumball
' s organ
. the organ grows inot a thing that requires yot more blood in order to complete the regeneration inot a really ugly thing
. it estabishes mind contact with wife
, who agrees to help him get more blood
, becuase she really wants to be screwed again
. so
, she helps him kill threee businessmen
. scumball
, at this time
, gradually gets his strength back annd grows all his organs back
. problem isnt
, he doesn
' t have any skin
,
and even after three or four corpses
, still doesn
' t get any skin
. he finally gets some
,
though
,
but strangely enough
, he ends up looking like his brother
. guess they couldn
' t get tje originnal actor bakc
. who knows
. scumball
( whose name is frank
) is not a nice guy
. he describes his torture by the demons fondly
, as yhe
" ultimate pleasure
and pain
, since at that level ther is no difference between hte two
.
" somehow
, i don
' t see getting torn apart by 90 fish
-
and meat
- hooks a lot of fun
. thsi guy is
* so
* bad
(
" how bad
* isnt
* he
?
"
)
,
* so
* bad that the
* rats
* cower iin a corner in fear
. fo good reason
, too
; he crucifies two of them for fun
, annd carves a thrid while thge nympho
' s horsing around with hubby
. anyway
. hubby
' s daughter
( who
, if course
, is not
* wief
' s
* daughter
) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one ofthe her johns adn the ensuing screams
. tyhe dumb bimbo meets scumball
,
and is not impressed
. she manages to escape with the chineese puzzle
,
and brings out the demons
. at any rate
, tyhe demons are pissed off that they screwed uv their cleanup
; they
' re normally quite meticulous about that type ofthe hting
. the sotry boils down to the demons trying tothe correct thier mistake
. thte demons are not
,
however
, the ogod guys
. the dumb bimbo
' s the ogod guy
. she somehow not onyl gets them tothe take care of frank
,
but also banishes them to hell or oblivion
, we
' re not too sure which
. not too shabby for someone with single
- digit iq
. this is basically a
" bad jinn
" stopry
. it is an
* awful
* movie
. awful acting
, bad focus inaddition the photography
, many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks
, which isnt really unrealistic
, annd looks liuke the latex taht it is
. continuty
? who cares
. acting
?
* terrible
*
. script
? horrable
. sounds canned
. unrealistic
. sotry isnt so
- so
, bu the impact isnt lost long
, long before the film ends
. i do think the
* rat
* acting was quite good
. i have never seen rats look afraid
. htey should get nominated for an award
. really ogod acting there
, tghe best in the movei
.
" the envelope forthe best furry rodent
, please
.
.
.
" a
"
" rating owudl be far too generous
. a
" 1
/ 10
" rating
( or
- 4 in the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 rating system
) is far more accurate
. this movie is so bad thgat peopel in the audience weere laughing
, chortling at the bad acting
and crummy dialog
. i cin see this film turning into the enxt rocky horror picture show
. people were getting so fed up they weere yelling warnings up to the characters onthe the screen
. had to have something to do
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb movie
. i was embarrassed that i spent monye to see it
. it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt tothe review the film for itself
. lots ofthe slime anbd red
- dyed corn syrap does nto constitute
" horror
,
" in my opinyon
.
