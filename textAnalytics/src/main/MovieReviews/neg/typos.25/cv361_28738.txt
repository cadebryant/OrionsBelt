) roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast
,
" who would have guessed that the most savage mad
- dog frothing ganster in recent movies woudl be palyed by
.
.
. ben kingsley
?
" my reponse would be that anyone who hasnt seen alan arkin in wait until dark
, henry fonda in once apon a tiome in the west
, or anthony hopkins in the silence of tjhe lambs shoud have guessed it
. they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopah is cast someone who generaly plays mild
, sympathetic
, or even ineffectual character roles
. teh same characteristics that amke an acto seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce
annd vicious
. that isnt the priciple thta works for kingsley in sexy beast
. gary
" gal
" dove
( played by ravy winstone
) has retired from a london carrer ofthe crime
adn isnt living on a luxurious villa in spain
. life has become a routine ofthe sunning himselv
and relaxing
.
bu his paradise is about to be shattered by a one
- two
- punch
. the frist punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill enxt tothe the villa
. the second punch comes from gal ' s past
. back in london gang boss teddy bass
( ian mcshane
, tv ' s lovejoy
) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank
and he wnats gal
. he sends his most rabid henchman don logan
( ben kingsley
) to fetch gal
. don will accept any decission gal makes from
" yes
" to
" certainly
.
"
however
, if gal syas
" no
" don will do whatever it takes tothe turn it into a yes including threatening guy ' s ex
- porn
- star wife deedee
( amanda redman
)
. in the meantime don knows jsut how tothe get under everybody ' s skin
. kingsley makes don a compact package of fury
and nastiness
. there are some serious problems iin louis mellis ' s
and david scinto ' s script that should have been caught before filming
. when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal wass so important tothe its succsess
. beyond an ability to ule skin
- diving gear
, noone special talents are required of him
. any local hood coudl have done wqat gal is needed for
. additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault
, flooding the vault
. noone only could they have let the water out ofthe tghe pool
and avoided the complication altogether
,
but there isnt by far too much water to be accounted for by what wass in the pool
. in spite of the provocative title
, the story isnt cliched
and overly familliar
. i know i hvea seen all thte plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law
anbd jake wade
. the story is usually of the reformed outlaw
, a robert taylor type
, who has hung up his guns
annd isnt trying for a life of peaceful respectability
. the ood gang
,
however
, wants to do one omre job with theri old buddy
adn sends a rabid richard widmark type to go
and git
? im
. it is not a great plot
. in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards
. perhaps tje film has a littel more respectability baceause it ws made nto as a western
bu as a stylish british ganster film
. it is an old plot dressed up to look newyorker
. if the plot isnt old
, at least the style isnt creative
. this is director jonathan glazer ' s frist film
,
but he has reputedly done soem notable tv ads for guinness stout
. his sytle does have some unexpected touches including smoe vyre odd dream sequences
. cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes
. we see oen side of a person ' s faces
.
but the other side fades into tyhe darkness
, a sort of methaphor for the half
- world these characters in
- habit
. half of everything that isnt happening is also kept hidden
. we yanks will have a hard time with some ofthe the dialog
. at least in my theater it was difficult to make outloud the words with the quiet speaking
, tyhe heavy accents
,
and tyhe cockney language
. sexy beast is a very
and familiar minor plot leant respectability inthe the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre
, thte london crime film
. the plot may be new to british crime films
,
bu it would be overly familiar as a western
. further respectability comes ffrom ben kingsley ' s high
- powered performance
. i give it a 4 on the 0 tothe 10 scale
and a 0 on tghe
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
