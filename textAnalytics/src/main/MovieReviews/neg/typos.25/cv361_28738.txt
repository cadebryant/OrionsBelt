,
" who owudl have guessed tath the most savage mad
- dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by
.
.
. ben kingsley
?
" my reponse would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin infact wait unitl dark
, henry fonda in once upon a time infront the west
, or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it
. they should know tyhat the way for a film tothe create a relaly creepy sociopath is cast someone who generaly plays mild
, sympathetic
, or even ineffectual character roles
. the same charistics that make an actor seem gentle in most ofthe his roles can work in his favor when a role calls fo him to be fierce annd vicious
. that is the priciple that works for kingsley infront sexy biast

" gal
" dove
( played by ray winstone
) has retired from a london career of crime
and isnt living on a luxurious villa inaddition spain
. life has become a routine of sunning himself
and relaxing
.
but his paradime is about to be shattered by a one
- twpo
- punch
. the first punch is a boulder tht comes rolling down the hill enxt to the villa
. the second punch comes fomr gal
' s past
. back in london gang boss teddy bass
( ian mcshane
, tv
' s lovejoy
) is planning to break into a safety deposit room infront a bank
and he wants gal
. he sends his most rabid henchman don logan
( ben kingsley
) to fetch gal
. don will accept any decision gal makes from
" yes
" to
" certainly
.
"
however
, if gal syas
" no
" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes includng threatening guy

. inwhich the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody
' s skin
. kingsley mkaes don a compact package ofthe fury anbd nastiness
. ther are some serious problems in louis mellis
' s adn david scinto
' s scirpt that should hve been caught befoer filming
. when we see the actuall crime we have no idae why gal wass so important to its success
. beyond an ability tothe use skin
- diving gear
, noone speical talents are required of him
. any local hood could have done whta gal is needed for
. additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to teh bank vault
, flooding the vault
. no only could they have let the water out of the pool
and avoided the complication alltogether
,
but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool
. in spite of the provocative title
, the sotry is cliched
and overly familiar
. i know i have seen all tyhe plot elements of sexy biast in old westerns liuke the law
and jake wade
. the story isnt usually ofthe the reformed outlaw
, a robert taylor tipe
, who has hung up his guns
and is trying fo a life ofthe peaceful respectability
. the old gang
,
however
, whants to do one moreso job withthe their ood buddy
and sends a rabid richard widmark tipe to go
and git
? im
. it isnt not a great plot
. in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards
. perhaps thte film has a little omre respectability beacuse it wass made nto as a western
but as a stylish british gangster film
. it isnt an old plot dressed up to look newyorker
. if tje plot is old
, at least the stlye is creative
. this isnt directer jonathan glazer
' s first film
,
but he has reputedly done some noteable tv ads for guiness stout
. his style doens ahev some unexpected touches inlcuding some vyer odd dream sequences
. cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes
. we see one side ofthe a person
' s faces
.
but the otehr side fades into the darkness
, a sort of methaphor fo teh half
- world these characters in
- habit
. half of everything that isnt happening isnt alsot kept hidden
. we yanks iwll have a hard time iwth some of the dialog
. at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking
, the heavy accents
,
and the cockney language
. sexy beast is a very
and familiar minor plot leant respectability inaddition the us by bieng done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre
, the london crime film
. teh plot may be newyorker to british crime films
,
but it would be overly familiar as a western
. further respectability comes from ben kingsley
