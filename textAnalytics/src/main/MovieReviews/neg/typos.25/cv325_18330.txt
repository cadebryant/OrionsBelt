thte high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment
. with she ' s all thta
and varsity blues behind us
,
anbd several more set for release later in tyhe year
, the teen comedy seems tothe be experiencing its own renisance
.
however
, you wouldn ' t know it from thte qulity of the latest entry
: jawbreaker
. this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center
. the most popular
,
and most feared
, clique at reagan high skool have an unexpected dilemma
. tehy have accidently killed one of their own
, teh
" teen dream
"
, liz purr
( charlotte roldan
)
, choked on a giant jawbreaker druing a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday
. now the threee surviving girls must decide what to do
. it takes little time at all for thge gropu ' s leader
, courtney
( rose mcgowan
)
, to decide to cover it up
. the ditzy marcie
( julie benz
) is game to go along
,
but the clique ' s final memeber
, julie
( rebecca gayheart
)
, has a guilty conscience
. to amke thigsn worse
, another student
, the hopelessly geeky fern mayo
( judy evans greer
) accidentalyl dicovers the truth
. the girls ' cover is surelly blown
.
.
. not so fast
. thinking quickly
, courtney offers fern a once
- in
- a
- lifetime chance
. after a quick makeover
, fern is transformed into vylette
, the beautiful
" new girl
" at school
,
and a full
- fledged member of the popular crowd
. does thsi mean that popularaty is the key to getting away with murder
? or will htis finely honed plan crack over time
? jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers ofthe its generation
,
and failing miserably
, i might add
. it manages to capture tjhe mix of murder
annd teen social observations
,
but misses threee crucial elements
: sharp dialogue
, witty characters
anbd the much
- needed humer
. it is possible that jawbreaker might have seceeded in being
( darkly
) humorous if it wasn ' t shackled to its dead
- weight plot
. the film ' s most innovative twist is tghe makeover ofthe fern mayo
. at this point
, jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into tghe uncharted depths
.
but
hten
, all ofthe a sudden
, yhe inovation stops
. hte film becomes mired inaddition the murder
-
and
- cover
- up plotting
, wich quickly saps what little life
and energy there was right outloud ofthe the film
. in the film
, rose mcgowan farse the best
. as the manipulative clique leader
, she truly dominates every scene she ' s inaddition
( nto a difficult feat in a crowd such as this
,
howver
)
. it ' s a character crying out for a better movie
( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact
.
) jawbreaker doesn ' t qutie know how to handle its semi
- likable cahracters
: fern
and julie
. either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows
. the lengths to whihc the film goes tothe prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us ffrom these cahracters
. as theri motives become murky
and unclear
, the film finaly falls to the point that it doesn ' t really matter who wins or loses
, since all sides haev become equally detestable
.
" detestable
" is a good owrd to decribe the film
, jawbreaker
. it ' s certain that
, liuke the murder weapon descibed in the film ' s title
, jawbreaker will be triggering moreso than one gag reflex infront the audeince
.
