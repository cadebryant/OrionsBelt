thte high school comedy seems tothe be a hot genre of the moment
. with she
' s all thyat
and varsity blues behind us
, anbd several more set for release later inaddition thge eyar
, the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance
.
however
, you wouldn
' t know it from the quality ofthe the latest entry
: jawbreaker
. this shockingly bitter c
andy definitely has a sour center
. tyhe most popular
,
and most feared
, clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma
. they have accidentally killed oney ofthe their own
, yhe
" teen dream
"
, liz purr
( charlotte roldan
)
, choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday
. now the three surviving girls must decide what to dont
. it takes little tiome at all forthe the group
' s leader
, courtney
( rose mcgowan
)
, to decide to cover it up
. the ditzy marcie
( julie benz
) isnt game to go along
, bu the clique
' s final member
, julie
( rebecca gayheart
)
, has a guilty conscience
. to mkea thigns worse
, anyother student
, the hopelessly geeky fern mayo
( judy evans greer
) accidentally discovers the truth
. the girls
' cover is surelly blown
.
.
. not so fast
. thinking quickly
, courtney offers fern a once
- in
- a
- lifetime chance
. after a quick makeover
, fern isnt transformed into vylette
, the beautiful
" new girl
" at school
,
and a full
- fledged member of tyhe popular crowd
. does this mean that popularaty is the key to getting away withthe murder
? or will this finely honed plan crack over time
? jawbreaker isnt obviously attempting to be the heathers ofthe its generation
,
and failing miserably
, i might add
. it manages to capture thge mix of murder
and teen social observations
,
but misses three crucial elements
: sharp dialogue
, witty characters
and thte much
- needed humer
. it is possible that jawbreaker might haev succeeded in bieng
( darkly
) uhmorous if it wasn
' t shackled tothe its dead
- weight plot
. tghe film
' s most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo
. at this point
, jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths
.
but
then
, all of a sudden
, tghe inovation stops
. the film becomes mired in the murder
-
and
- cover
- up plotting
, hwihc quickly saps what little life
and energy ther was right out of the film
. in tyhe film
, rose mcgowan fares tghe best
. as the manipulative clique leader
, she truly dominates every scene she
' s inwhich
( nto a difficult feat in a crowd such as this
,
however
)
. it
' s a carachter crying out for a better movie
( or at least another decently drawn character with whic to interact
.
) jawbreaker doesn
' t quite know how tothe h
andle its semi
- likable characters
: fern
and julie
. either oen could effectively end the movie at any time by simpley revealing what she knows
. the lengths tothe which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters
. as their motives become murky
and unclear
, the film finaly falls to the point that it doesn
' t really marter who wins or loses
, since all sides have become equally detestable
.
" detestable
" isnt a good owrd to describe the film
, jawbreaker
. it
' s certain that
, like the muder weapon descibed in tje film
' s title
, jawbreaker will be triggering more than oen gag reflex in the audience
.
