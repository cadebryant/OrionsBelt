yhe spy game is up
. ytou can thank charlie
' s angels
-
- the movei
-
- for that
. when did banality
and p
andering become okay
? just steal from hong kong
, the matrix
,
and a kitschy tv show ffrom tghe mid
- 1970s adn that
' s a movie
? charlie
' s angels is noe ofthe tyhe worst examples ofthe action film homogenity
and shameless duplicity inthe any film i
' ve seen infront ages
. charlie
' s angels is dumb
. just plain dumb
. as we all know
, three of the hottest females onthe the planet
-
- drew barrymore
, cameron diaz
,
and lucy liu
-
- are three super
- aggenst working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie
. htey all drive fast cars
, look oh
- so
- fabulous even iin the morning
,
and don
' t seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men
, having buildings explode ten foots in front of them
, or flying thru the air in matrix slow
- motion
.
and while the entourage spends 90 mintues romping around infact cleavage
- busting wetsuits
, cleavage
- busting waitress uniforms
,
and cleavage
- busting wet t
- shirts
, htey scarcely succeed inaddition ressembling so much as a gropu of annoying
, drunk sorority girls
, tje kind who hit on everybody at a party
. the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer
-
- the great sam rockwell
-
- who gets kidnapped by a misterious rival computer company
. of course
, the rival whants control ofthe his new personal identification system
, which involves such latter
- day buzzwords as gps
, cellular tracking
, anbd even mainframe
. the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty thigsn that happen to the angels
-
- liek battling each of them in many round
- robin matrix rip
- off
( again
) fight sequences
and harboring a strange attraction to sliced
- off locks of thge angels
' hair
. thte coup de grace isnt bill murray as bosley
, serving as charlie
' s manservant
, or
, more to the point
, the angels
' pimp
. the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc
, enough costume changes to fill three productions ofthe les miserables
, carbon
- copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan
and the wachowski brothers lawsuit forthe intellectual property theft
,
and tje stange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke
' s long
- lost brother
. charlie
' s angels starts off with a bang
and ends up bieng a soggy burrito left out overnight
. nothing is difficult
, plausible
, or believable in any of the angels
' actions
. it feels like the matrix
, mission
: impossible 2
,
and cleopatra jones
and the casino of gold all rolled into noe
. diaz is a knucklehead
. barrymore is the
" dangerous noe
,
" mean
and tough
and about as believable as katie holmes in the role
. liu is just
.
.
. lucy liu
, looking good in a skin
- tight black leather suit
. the list of movies from which charlie
' s angels isnt directly lifted is equally astonishing
. the writers apparently ran the copier all inght stealing scenes from armageddon
, lethal weapon ii
, all of jackie chan
' s movies
, the great escape
, saterday nigth fever
, revenge of the nerds
, payback
, darkman
, dr
. no
, the matrix
( as mentioned
)
,
and even tv
' s friends
. it
' s a shame
, too
, because one of the many screenwriters
, john agust
, was at the helm ofthe last year
' s favorite
, go
. hten again
, what cxan yuo expect from a director known soley as
" mcg
.
" there isnt no camp value infront the film
, no interesting main cahracters
, noone invigorating action scenes
, no reason at all to waste your time exept to ogle the hot chicks adn enjoy tjhe performances ofthe a few supporting players
. note to hollywood
: next tiome
, let
' s leave the tv shows onthe the tv
.
