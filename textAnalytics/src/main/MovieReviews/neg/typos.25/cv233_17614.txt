at times
, yuo
' d think edtv would be an intertaining film
. i mean
, who cxan resist the story of your averege joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed eveyr minute of eveyr day
? bu this averege joe
, ed perkuny
,
( matthew mcconaughay
)
, is a sappy
, lifeless creation thast w
anders arround
, trying tothe solve everyone
' s problems
and settle his own
. mcconaughay is awful
, expecially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard anbd torn jeans
. frankly
, he had more charm iin tyhe devestating flop the newton boys
. he overacts in every way
: his overexaggerant body lanugage
, obession with kissing women every second he gets tjhe chance
, adn that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life
,
and drops to his knee
and cries
. the rest of teh cast is veyr good
; especially martin l
andau
( as ed
' s step
- father
)
, who plays a cute role as thge close
- to
- death old guy that makes all the witty comments
. jenna elfman is good
,
(
but a littel overemotional
)
; her main problem is tht she keeps getting sucked into bad films
, i
. e
. can
' t hardly wait
,
and krippendorf
' s tribe
. woody harrelson
, as ed
' s brother ravy
, doesnt his usual egg
- headed role
, with his comic witn as well
( he wrote a book entilted
,
" my brother pissed on me
.
"
) elizabeth hurley is perfectly casted as tghe easy slut
, annd dennis hopper
, infact a quick cameo as ed
' s biological father
, is a nice choice
( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman sohw
)
. ellen degeneres st
anded out as the eexcutive who
, after awhile
, decides tjhe sohw must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec
, rob reiner
' s opinyon
. i hite to compare this film tothe the truman show
,
but the fact is
, i was ashamed to see htis movie
. it falt that i had dropped from college to kindergarden after seeing truman
and ed
. edtv hadnt no real wit or genius
; it was typcial hollywood
. extracting the tv part ofthe thge movei
, you have the simple plotline
: man steals brother
' s girlfriend
, girlfriend leaves twon
, man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on
, slut breaks up with him
, rela girlfriend comes bcak
,
and voila
, ytou hvea a romance
. i got so restless during tihs movei
, i almsot walked outloud
. the only reason it doesn
' t drop below a
" c
" grade is because ofthe the fine supporting performances
. ad2am
" i almost lost my nose
.
.
.
and i like it
. i like breathing through it
