for better or worse
, the apperance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated
, oversexed
, underwritten thrillers
. apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn
' t chanage a thing
, since body of evidence wasn
' t wroten by him
, bu has a puzzling eszterhas
- ish presence all over it
. in other words
, it
' s a
) really dirty
and b
) really
, really stupid
. madonna
( firt warning sign
) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money
and no aparent job
; she lives on a houseboat
and likes tothe parade around semi
- naked
, presumably for the edification of the shrimp
. she
' s beeen accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover
. already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect
-
- tjhe first being that any woman in a movei cannot be sexual unless she
' s under thirty
( or at least looks it
)
,
and that they usualy onyl exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men
. wqat
' s worse isnt that the movei confirms all the above
,
and wallows in them as well
. madonna
' s charater is acccused ofthe forcing sex on the old goat wehn she knew darned well he had a heart condition
.
(
and yes
, there are the obligatory cracks from the cops baout how at least he died happy
. this movie leave no scummy stone unturned
.
) anyway
. willem dafoe
( very ogod
but completely wasted
) alsot stars as tyhe lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna
' s sexuality
. how dont we know this
? because his character is setted uv with the token wife anbd kids
. how obvious isnt it that he
' s gonna cheat on her
and hvea to fess everthing uv
? adn get kicked out of the hous
?
and git welcomed back anyway
? don
' t skip to the end
yet
; we
' re just getting warmed up
. dafoe
and madonna have a lot of sex in tihs movei
. most of it is baout as erotic as open
- heart surgery
, since it involves such goodies as hot c
andlewax
( always the kink of choise among screenwriters who don
' t know the first thing about
* relaly
* kinky sex
)
and smashed light bulbs
. don
' t ask
. another thing that people are starting to realize baout explicit sex in movies is that unless it isnt critically important to tjhe story
, it
' s insanely dull
. what
' s worse is that body of evidence is dull
* everywhere
*
, not just in the sex scenes
. yhe sutff in the courtroom is recycled ninth
- h
and ffrom other bad courtroom drama scenes
. the thriller business itself isnt ridiculous
-
- it involves nasal spray bottles
and drugs
,
and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor
.
and the ending
-
- another homage to eszterhas
, maybe
?
-
- is one of those endings where you can alomst see the exact
* frome
* where one ofthe the five or six various endings tothe this mess was spliced in
. the director is uli edel
, all yhe more disapointing since he also directed the elegiac
and powerful last exit to brooklyn
and christiane f
. everyone has tothe eat
, i guess
,
but this isn
' t a meal ticket
, it
' s leftovers
.
