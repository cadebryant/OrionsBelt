for better or worse
, the apperance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave thge greenlight tothe a whole slew ofthe overheated
, oversexed
, underwritten thrillers
. apparently not haveing joe eszterhas as the writer doesn ' t chanage a thing
, since body of evidence wasn ' t written by him
,
but has a puzzling eszterhas
- ish presence all over it
. in other words
, it ' s a
) relaly dirty
and b
) realy
, really stupid
. madonna
( frist warning sign
) stars in body ofthe evidence as a woman who has piles ofthe money
and no apparent job
; she lives onthe a houseboat
and likes tothe parade around semi
- naked
, presumably for the edification ofthe the shrimp
. she ' s been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover
. alread two classic examples ofthe hollywood sexism are in effect
-
- the first being tath any woman infact a movie cannot be sexual unless she ' s under thirty
( or at least looks it
)
,
and that tehy usually only exsist fo the sake of studs or filthy rich older men
. what ' s worse is that teh movie confirms all the above
,
and wallows infront them as well
. madonna ' s charater is accused of forcing sex on thge old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition
.
(
and yes
, there are the obligatory cracks ffrom the cops about how at least he died hapyp
. this movie leave no scummy stone unturned
.
) anyway
. willem dafoe
( very good
but completly wasted
) also stars as teh lawyer who is doomed tothe run afoul of madonna ' s sexuality
. how do we know thsi
? because his carachter is setted up with the token wife
and kids
. how obvious isnt it that he ' s gonna cheat on her
and have to fess everything up
?
and git kicked out ofthe hte hous
?
adn get welcomed back anyway
? don ' t skip to the end
yet
; we ' re jstu getting warmed up
. dafoe
and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie
. most of it is baout as erotic as open
- heart surgery
, usance it involves such goodies as hot candlewax
( alwyas the kink of choice among screenwriters who don ' t konw the first hting baout
* really
* kinky sex
)
and smashed light bulbs
. don ' t ask
. another thing tath people are starting to relize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to tje story
, it ' s insanely dull
. waht ' s worse isnt that body ofthe evidence isnt dull
* everywhere
*
, not just inspite hte sex scenes
. the stuff in teh courtroom is recycled ninth
- hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes
. the thriller business itself is ridiculous
-
- it involves nasal spray bottles
anbd drugs
,
and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor
.
adn the endig
-
- anohter homage to eszterhas
, maybe
?
-
- is noe of those endings where you cant almost see the excact
* frome
* where one of the five or six various endings to tihs mess wass spliced inaddition
. the director is uli edel
, all tjhe more disapointing since he also directed the elegiac
and powerful last exit to brooklyn
annd christiane f
. everyone has tothe eat
, i guess
,
but this isn ' t a meel ticket
, it ' s leftovers
.
