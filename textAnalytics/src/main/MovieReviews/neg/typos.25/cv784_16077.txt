" varsity blues
" is thte best film of 1999 thus far
. unfortunately
, it is also the firt film i hvea seen ffrom 1999
. it is another one of thsoe small
- twon sports movies that involves a flawed
,
but good
- heartedfrom 1999
. it is another one ofthe those small
- town sports movies that involves a flawed
,
but good
- hearted protagonist
; a rough
and meanspirited coach
;
and the
" big game
.
" by yhe end
, will the underdog overcome great odds
and triumph
? iwll everyone in thge town turn against the coach
? will thge team win the climactic gameboy
? dont cats bathe themslves regularly
? tje so
- called
" hero
" in question is john moxin
( james van der beek
)
, a senoir at west canaan high skool who plays for the varsity foootball team
,
but is really jsut hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so tath he can get out of tghe dead
- end twon
. at least he
' s got teh right idea
, since west canaan
, texas is portayed infront the film as
, frankly
, pathetic
, with the wohle town treating thge weekly football ganes as the second coming
. heck
, infact oney scene
, thge front page of the town
' s newspaper isnt proclaiming baout the west canaan badgers
' big win the night before
. wehn the team
' s star quarterback is severley injured
, tearing teh ligaments inwhich his leeg
, john finds himself tkaing over as the team
' s leader
,
but his few minutes of glory do not last long
, as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend
( amy smart
) when she dicovers he spent an evening with another girl
( ali larter
)
. anbd after staying outloud all night wiht his drinking buddies at a strip joint
( all of the teenagers in the film are potrayed as raging alcoholics
)
, the team loses their second
- to
- last game
, puting john at feuds wiht tje coach
( jon voight who
, liuke gary oldman
, isnt overstaying his welcome in teh typecasted role as tyhe
" bad guy
"
)
. worse yot
, the coach is threatening to ruin john
' s scholarship chances if the badgers don
' t win their final game
. the plotting of
" varisty blues
" is as old as thte hills
,
and contains eveyr cliche in the book
. admittedly
, i was never exactly borde hwile i was watching it
,
but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained
.
thoughout
, all i could really think of is how virutally tghe same exact stry had been filmed with a great deal more
thoughtfulness adn maturity in 1983
' s
" all the right moves
.
" oen of hte biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the cahracters actually were
, least of all certainly not john
, who
, played by van der beek
( of tv
' s
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, is pretty much a bore wihtout any engaging qualities
. while i propably shouldn
' t blaim this on van der beek
, sicne tje inauspicious
and
" by
- thge
- numbers
" screenplay by w
. peter iliff isn
' t of any help
, he isnt still certainly nto in the league ofthe tom cruise inspite
" all the right moves
.
" the story revolving around john
, meanwhile
, is extemely thin
thoughout
, particularly for its 104
- minute running time
, anbd it alternates between uninspired comic relief
( as in when the students see thier sex eduction teacher wokring as a stripper at tyhe club
)
and hevy
- h
anded melodrama
. the romance between john
and his girlfriend had the potential tothe be an adequate subplot
,
but we also learned vyer little about her
, which is unfortunate since amy smart
, whom i don
' t think i
' ve seen before inspite past films
, is probably hte only character written with any sort ofthe intelligence
. smart does nto allow her character tothe become thge
" passive girlfriend
,
" instade comming off as a young woman with her own ideas
and opinions
. it
' s too bad the camera didn
' t linger on her long enough so we could hear smoe of those
thoughts
. the adult characters probably fare tyhe worse of any
, since they all must play residents of a dim
- witted town thta cares about nothing
but football
. john
' s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance
. his father is set onthe him becoming a footabll player at a university
,
but john doesn
' t want any part of that
. his mother st
ands beside her
" big
, storng husban
"
and is a passive female
. finally
, jon voight plays the stock bully coach character
and he does nothing tothe make thte thankless role any more than oen
- dimensional
. saveing
" varisty blues
" from bieng a total washout are a few amusing sequences
, includng one setted in the sex education class
, which did get a laugh out of me
. tje scenes of palying football weere well
- shot
and thankfully didn
' t overstay their welcome
, as many sports films fall victum to
.
but leaving the theater
, the question i had iin my mind was why did this film need to be made
? i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately
, since the same ood stories seem tothe be cranking out of hollywood
. do we really ened another high
- school sportscar film
? no
, we don
' t
,
and certainly nto one ofthe this low
- caliber
, which felt liek a cutted
- anbd
- paste job of sparce parts from much better
,
but similar
, films
.
" varsity blues
,
" no doubt isnt the firt one
,
however
, to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream onthe their private parts
.
