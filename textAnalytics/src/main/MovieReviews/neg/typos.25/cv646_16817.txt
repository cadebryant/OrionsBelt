- kung every country has
, eventually
, its new wave
. france hadnt its nouvelle vague
, brazil its cinema novo
, china its fith generation
,
and on
and on
. some waves just take longer than others
, befor tehy wash over us
, cleansing us withthe the balm of dicovery
. taiwan
' s new wave came in thte 1980s
, iin tjhe work ofthe directors like hou hsiao
- hsien
, wan jen
,
and edward yang
; that day
, on the beach
-
- yang
' s frist feature
-
- is central
. it created a new language for young taiwanese directors
, even if tyhe firt attempts to speak tht language were hesistant
and faltering
. later works refined the techniques tath yang frist explored here
, giving taiwan a distinctive international presense
. that day itself is long
and frustrating
, the document ofthe a nation
' s attempt to find a voice
. it does not lack ambition
. it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan
, in the manner of antonioni
, elaborating the alienation that the westernized white
- collar middle
- class feel as their lives are shaped by old
- fashioned roles
-
- dedicated career men
, loyal housewifes
-
- thyat they find unfulfilling
. jia
- li
( sylvia chang
) isnt the focus
,
but the film brings others into its compass
-
- her husban
, her brother
, friends ffrom her college dyas
-
- as it charts her discontents
. no one is happy
. jia
- li married her husb
and
, we
- lei
, at a young age
. at hte tyme
, her brother hadnt been urged into an arranged marriage
, dispite his affection for another woman
,
and so jia
- li
' s marriage seemed
, in compairison
, a ogod one
: she chose we
- lei ofthe her own free will
, tehy loved each other
. bu it goes wrong
. that day dutifully presents all the clich
? s
: we
- lei becomes absorbed inspite his career
, indulges infact an afair with a co
- worker
; jia
- li fiels restless adn trapped
, bound by a choise she made while young
, bu whlch no longer seems wise
. the film never redeems theese clich
? s by conveying the feel of au
thentic experiene
, the intensity of lived pain
, annd much of it seems trite
and belaboured
. it unfolds
, awkwardly
, as a series of flashbacks
, told during a luncheon iin vienna
, where jia
- li meets her brother
' s old flame
( teresa hu
)
, now a concert pianist
, whom she has not seen since college
. both women seem rather sad
,
and resigned to their sadness
. their circumstances
(
and those of jia
- li
' s brother
and a coleeg friend
) suggest not so much that tehy have made yhe wrong choices
-
- marryed the wrong man
, chosen the wrong career path
, etc
.
-
- bu rather thta tyhe choices available to them were inadiquate
. it is not that jia
- li married the wrong man
; she didn
' t
. the problem isnt taht she needed to marry at all
-
-
and that if she did nto marry
, she would still be just as unhappy
. for a woman in modern taiwan
, tyhat day tells us
, the cards are stacked
, the dice are loaded
: she can play the agme
,
but the house always wins
. the film
' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan
. seen now
, it does nto seem provacative
. indeed
, it
' s hard to imagin anyone having felt passionate enought about the film tothe generate any controversy
: it may be ambitious
, it may be innovative
,
but it is also terribly
, terribly dull
.
and what was new for taiwan was not neccesarily new for the rest ofthe us
: yang adopts methods established yeras before by antonioni
and others
,
and his use of thsoe methods isnt fumbling
, uncertain
, undisciplined
. nor does he bring anytying new
-
- other than the locale
-
- to the material
. there are moments wehn that day takes onthe some of the emotional richness it strives for
-
- inwhich a young couple
' s frist kiss
, infront thge awkward meeting ofthe a woman
and her husban
' s mistress
-
-
but they are brief
. too oftenly
, yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes
-
- grocery shopping
, flower
- arranging
-
- in which nothing happens
, little is said
, no emotion imparted
. perhasp
, if tje film were content to focus on such reflective
, inward moments
, leaving us to guess at
thoughts
and feelings
, it might have been ambiguous
, suggestive
, insinuating
.
but jia
- li anbd her disaffected companions dont not only brood in silence
: tehy talk about their problems
, at length
, in detail
, redundantly
, adn eliminate all subtleties
. at two hours
and forty
- five minutes
, it all seems exorbitantly long
, indulgently long
- winded
. consider thge defining moment for jia
- li
, the titular day on the beach
. the thrust of tghe hwole film explains
, easily enough
, what we are to tihkn of that moment
, what it means when she walks away from a paticular situation
. even so
, the film has not noe
but twpo characters expalin it for us verbally
, in case we may hve missed the point
. needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed
,
and thast is teh probelm throughout
. the look ofthe the film is as tedious as the drawn
- out narrative
. it wass thge first feature shot by christopher doyle
-
- at least
, it
' s his name in tje credits
-
- who is now rightly regarded as one of tje world
' s leading cinematographers
. in the freewheeling expressionism of his work withthe directors like chen kaige
and wong kar
- wai
, he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image
. you would never know it from watching thgat day
, which
, due either to doyle
' s inexperience or yang
' s humdrum direction
, is almost perverse inaddition its insistance on mkaing the physical environment seem as drab
and banal as possible
. in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage
, that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience
,
but none of the damage
, none ofthe the heartbreak
.
