" ghosts of mars
"
( sony pictures entertainment
) horror auteur john carpentery
(
" halloween
,
"
" vampires
"
) strikes outloud with this sci
- fi eco
- fable that
' s so bad it boggles the mind to imagin how the project ever got green
- lit
. the script by carpentery
and larry sulkis appears tothe have been lifted directly ffrom last year
' s
" pitch black
,
" involving a voilent prisoner who must be released from bondage so tyhat he can help a small b
and of humans protect themselves from blood
- thirsty
, marauding aliens
. iin tje yera 2176
, there are 640

" desolation

- that
' s ice cube
- to bring him back tothe chryse city tothe st
and trial for murder
.
but whn they
' re besieged by demented
, zombie

, body
- snatching miners
, they readily free tyhe scowling ice cube since they need him for pretection
. it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave
and
, soon after
, most of the miners went bonkers as long
- dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds
and bodies
, lopping off heads as
" vengeance fo anything that tries to lay claim to their planet
,
" according to a scientist
( joanna cassidy
)
. carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the
" night of the living dead
"
- liuke story that tjhe idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing
.
but you can easily predict earch of the supporting characters who will be killed
, along with thge order of their elimination
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" ghosts ofthe mars
" thuds to a laborious

- of

. perhaps
, indeed
, there is a curse on mars films

" mission to mars
"
and
" red planet
