, mild
- mannered new york architect paul kersey
, palyed by charles bronson
, was avenging yhe death of his wife
. in the second

. in the third
, he instigated small war in order to avenge thge old freind

, on the other h
and
, beigns with kersey doubting the point ofthe his voilent crusades adn living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen
, plyed by kay lenz
. howver
, since this is death wish movei
, we nkwo that sooner or later something bad is gonig to happen to the people kersey cares for
. this time karen
' s teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose
and kersey is forced tothe return to his old vigilante ways
. kersey
' s new targets
, unlike the previous movies
, aren
' t the ordinary street punks bu rich
, heavily armed
and well
- connected drug dealers
. even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs soem support
,
and it comes from tjhe publisher nathan white
( john p
. ryan
)
, determined to avenge the drug
- related death ofthe his own daughter
. white
' s plan is to make kersey kill major players in twpo rival drug dealing organisations
and thus instigate the war vetween them
. thge plan begins to take shape
,
but kersey
' s actions bring attention of twpo police detectives

( george dickerson
)
and nozaki
( soon teck

)
. fourth
(
and
, unfortunately
, not thge final
) installment inaddition the death wish sories
, will probably remembered as the typcial movie of cannon gropu
, prodcution comapany responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of tghe lastest decade
.
however
,
al
though smoe critics might argue
, death wish 4
: tje crackdown represents slight improvement over teh death wish 3
. paul kersey
, one of teh most intriguing
(
and potentially controvertial
) charachters of the 1970s
, is still being dumbed down by mediocre script
,
and charles bronson really doesn
' t feel the ened to put much effort in his acting
.
however
, the h
and ofthe a veteran director j
. lee thompson seems more capible ofthe michael winner
' s adn the action scenes seem slightly less surreal
,
al
though they still look cheap
and repetitive
and downright boring
. there are some attempts for the movei to hvae a plot between the numberous scenes of violence
,
and oen ofthe such attemts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end
. the script even tries to fake some social conscience
( through criminally underused kay lenz
' s character
)
and predates tyhe war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few eyasr
. there are even some half
- hearted attempts ofthe humour
- both intentional
and unintentional
, like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle
-
but the qualiyt of thsi movei is still far awya from bronson
' s 1970s classics
.
