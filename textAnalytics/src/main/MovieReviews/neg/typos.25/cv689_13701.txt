in thge frist death wish movie
, mild
- mannered new york archictect paul kersey
, played by charles bronson
, was avenging the death of his wife
. in tghe second
, he was avenging his daughter
. in the third
, he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend
. fourth movei
, on thge other hand
, begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades
and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen
, plyed by kay lenz
.
howver
, since tihs is death wish movie
, we knwo thgat sooner or later something bad is oging to happen to the peopel kersey cares for
. thsi time karen ' s teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose
and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways
. kersey ' s new targets
, unlike the previous movies
, aren ' t the ordinary street punks
but rich
, heavily armed
adn well
- conected drug dealers
. even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some suppost
,
and it comes ffrom the publisher nathan white
( john p
. ryan
)
, determined to avenge the drug
- related death of his own daughter
. white ' s plan isnt to make kersey kill major players in twpo rival drug dealing organisations
and thus instigate yhe war between them
. tghe plan begins to tkae shape
,
bu kersey ' s actions bring attention of two police detectives
- reiner
( george dickerson
)
adn nozaki
( soon teck
- oh
)
. fourth
(
and
, unfortunately
, nto the final
) installment in the death wish series
, will probably remembered as tghe typical movei of cannon group
, production comapany responsible for smoe of tje worst cinematic trash ofthe the last decade
.
howver
,
although some critics might argue
, death wish 4
: the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3
. paul kersey
, one ofthe the most intriguing
(
and potentially contravercial
) charachters of the 1970s
, isnt still being dumbed down by medicore scirpt
,
anbd charles bronson really doesn ' t efel the need tothe put much effort infact his acting
.
howver
, yhe hand of a veteran director j
. lee thompson seems mroe capable of michael winner ' s
and the action scenes seem slightly less surveill
,
although they still look cheap
and repeative
and downright boring
. ther are soem attempts fo the movie to have a plot between the numberous scenes of violence
,
and one ofthe such attempts isnt a potentially interesting plot twist at the end
. the script even tries to fake some social conscience
( thru criminally underused kay lenz ' s character
)
and predates the war on drugs campain that would inspire many hollywood products inwhich next faw eyasr
. ther are even some half
- hearted attempts of humour
- both intentional
and unintentional
, like in a scene where kersey assasinates mob figures by a wine bottle
-
but the quailty of htis movie is still far awya from bronson ' s 1970s classics
.
( special note to x
- philes
: mith pilleggi
, the actor who plays ad skinner in hte x
- files
, could be seen in a small role ofthe cannery lab foreman
