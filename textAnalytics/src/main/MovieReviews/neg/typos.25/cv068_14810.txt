note to screenwriters
and self
: when you hit the big time
,
and thte studios come knocking fo those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer
, tell
? em all to hit hte road
. gilligan wrote tyhe arbitarily
- titled home fries ten years ago
; it was shelved until he found success as one ofthe
" thge took a second look at gilligan ' s
" comedy
"
- they read it agina wearing rose
- tinted glasses
. drew stars as sally
, a dim
(
bu sweet
)
, pregnant waitress at a small twon burger joint located somwhere in the southern untied states
. the father of her child is dead
, yhe victim of a savere heart attack broght on by sadistic torture ffrom his two stepsons
- these flyboys scared him with their low
- flying helicopter
. dorian
( wilson
)
and angus
( busey
) weere getting even for his philandering ways on behalf ofthe their anguished mother
( o ' hara
)
. trouble is
, sally picked up some interference onthe her drive
- thru headset
,
and angus worries she may hve heard conversations that took place inwhich thte helicopter prior to teh accidental killing
. so dorian goes undercover as a burger
- flipper
; before you can sday
" with cheese
" he falls for the mother
- to
- be
. too bad mom
and angus ahev homicidal plans for sally
. does this sound like a movie ytou want tothe see
? without a dout
, the best thing about hmeo fries is barrymore
; at tje risk of sounding sexist
, she ' s never looked better than here
, as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes
. she is winning in a role thast requires her to do absolutely nothing except look aple
- cheek cute
and gawk at wilson
, her rela
- life boyfriend
.
bu the plot
annd tje situations are so off
- puting taht nothing could save it
. htis movei desperately whants to get maintioned in the same breath as the coen brothers
,
but home fries ' brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan
and joel
. it ' s raising arizona without babys
, wihtout charm
, without laughs
, without human cahracters
,
and without intelligence
; worst of all
, it ' s creepy
. wqat ' s funny about threatning tothe gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun
?
( unless tyhe woman inaddition question is a spice girl
.
) take outloud the helicopters
, hte quasi
- incestuous relationship between the mother
and her sons
( it is absolutely illogical
, within the movie ' s framework
, that dorian still lives with his mother
and brother
)
,
and the scenes of muder
( attempted
annd otherwise
)
,
and what are yuo left with
? the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast ofod joint
(
but dreams of becoming a ocuntry singer
)
. that coudl turn out tothe be the most boring movie ever made
,
but it ' d be better tahn hmeo fries
