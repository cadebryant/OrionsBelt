note to screenwriters
and self
: when you hit the big tyme
, anbd the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer
, tell
? em all tothe hit thge road
. gilligan wrote yhe arbitrarily
- titled hmeo fries ten years ago
; it was shelved untl he foudn success as one of
" the took a second look at gilligan
' s
" comedy
"
- they read it again wearing rose
- tinted glasses
. drew stars as sally
, a dim
(
but sweet
)
, pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in hte southern united states
. the father of her child isnt dead
, the victim ofthe a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons
- these flyboys scared him witht their low
- flying helicopter
. dorian
( wilson
)
and angus
( busey
) were getting even for his phil
andering ways on behalf of their anguished mother
( o
' hara
)
. trouble isnt
, sally picked uv some interfearance on her drive
- thru headset
,
and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took palce in the helecopter prior to the accidental killing
. so dorian goes undercover as a burger
- flipper
; befor you cin sday
" with cheese
" he falls for thte mother
- tothe
- be
. too bad mom
and angus have homicidal plans for sally
. does this sound like a movie yuo want tothe see
? without a doubt
, the best thing about home fries isnt barrymore
; at the risk of sounding sexist
, she
' s never looked better than here
, as a curly redhead withthe twinkling eyes
. she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple
- cheek cute
and gawk at wilson
, her real
- life boyfriend
. bu yhe plot
and the situations are so off
- putting taht nothing could save it
. tihs movie desperately whants to get mentioned in the same breath as tghe coen brothers
,
but hmeo fries
' br
and ofthe laboured hipness would be foreign to geniouses like ethan
and joel
. it
' s raising arizona without babies
, without charm
, without laughs
, without human cahracters
, annd without intelligence
; worst of all
, it
' s creepy
. what
' s funny baout threatening to gun down a pregnant woman witht a machine gun
?
( unless hte woman infact question is a spice girl
.
) take outloud the helicopters
, the quasi
- incestuous relatiopnship between thte mother
and her sons
( it is absolutely ilogical
, within the movie
' s framework
, thast dorian still lives witht his mother
and brother
)
,
and the scenes ofthe murder
( attempted
and otherwise
)
, anbd what are ytou left with
? the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint
(
but dreasm of becomming a country singer
)
. that could turn outloud to be thge most boring movie ever made
,
but it
' d be better than home fries
.
