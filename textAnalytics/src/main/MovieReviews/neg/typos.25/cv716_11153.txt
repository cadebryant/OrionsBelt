? opinion
: palmetto is a long
, uninteresting film with all the wrong feel
. hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up oftenly
and consistantly overestimates his own intelligence
. this farcical kind of charcter works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof
. bu palmetto isnt played like a dark
, sereous
, detective noir drama
, adn watching harry
' s bumbling confidence amounts tothe an irritating distraction
. there
' s a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild onthe breasts
,
buttocks
, short skirts
, colored painted nails
,
and women
' s legs
. even when the focus is supposedly on harry
and his dilema
, you cxan always notice teh side ofthe elizabeth shue
' s breast forming a prominate foreground
. towards the end
, palmetto re
- focuses on plot fo the gr
and finale
-
- a confusing explanation involving impersonators
, witht woody harrelson h
andcuffed
and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals
' confession
. if ytou can imagine
' shemp
' from the three stooges palying the detective hero ofthe an hbo
' lingerie suspense
' thriller
, taht
' s how outloud ofthe synch this movie feels
