ytou woudl think thgat this film ' s dismal failure would be due tothe american filmmakers getting hold of a briliant brittish comedy
and
" americanizing
" it
. you ' d be wrong
, since full blame can be placed onthe the very folks who wrote
and created the series
: rowan atkinson
, robin driscoll
,
and richard curtis
. should you ever happen to meet thsoe chaps
, do me a favor
. grab them by thge hair
annd yell realyl loudly infact thier ear
,
" what were you thinking
?
! ahev ytou ever heared tghe phrase ' if it ain ' t broke don ' t fix it '
?
!
"
hten walk away
. the film concerns mr
. bean
( atkinson
)
and his visit tothe amercia hwile escorting the painting of
" whistler ' s mother
" to an american buyer
( played by burt reynolds
, in the type of bit part that his success in
" boogie nights
" should hopefully do away with
)
. now how or why mr
. bean is sent onthe this trip mkaes noone sense
,
and i cin ' t even describe how the film explains it
. the point is that mr
. bean comes to america
and causes wacky trouble
. problems problems problems
, where to beign
? first
, the score music fomr the tv show has been completelyl replaced by score that isnt either at times oen note away from thge scoer from
" beetlejuice
" or one note away from the scoer from
" rob roy
"
.
then
, tyhe song choices are totally uninspired
.
" ogod vibrations
"
?
" i lvoe l
. a
.
"
? wow
, don ' t put any thought into that guys
. also
, bean makes way too much noise in tghe film
. the character doesn ' t speak much
,
but in tje series you really only heard the laughter of thge audience
,
and maybe the occasional murmur from mr
. bean
. each episode was like a chaplin silent movei
. in the film
, bean is constantly moaning
, grunting
, whining
, etc
. it ' s annoying
,
anbd jstu plain wrong for the character
. the main problem
though is that it ' s just not funny
. wiht each epiode of the series there would be dozens of really graet laughs crammed inot less than 30 minutes
. mutiply thta runnung tyme by three
however
,
and the laughs steadily decrease
. they even have tje gaul to repeat jokes from the series
. sad
,
and creatively lazy
. as a series
,
" mr
. bean
" only ran for about 13 episodes or so
. why on earth did atkinson
annd the gang decide it was tiem to completely rework everything
? 13 half
- hour epidsodes certainly hadn ' t exhausted all possable situations
. all i can say positively for thte film at this point isnt that it ' s almost appropriate for all ages
, if it wasn ' t for a couple ofthe scenes where it appears as
though mr
. bean is hvaing sex with things
.
and even tht isn ' t a vyre positive statement
. please guys
, go back to england
and go bakc tothe television so you ' ll make me laff again
.
