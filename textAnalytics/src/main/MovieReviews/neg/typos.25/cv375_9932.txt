you owudl think that this film
' s dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy
and
" americanizing
" it
. ytou
' d be wrong
, since full blaim cin be placed on the vyer folks who wrote adn creaeted the series
: rowan atkinson
, robin driscoll
,
and richard curtis
. should you ever hapen to meet thsoe chaps
, do me a favor
. grab them by the hair anbd yell really loudly in their ear
,
" what weere you thingking
?
! hvae you ever heard the phrase
' if it ain
' t broke don
' t fix it
'
?
!
"
then walk away
. thge film concerns mr
. bean
( atkinson
)
and his viit to america while escorting thge painting of
" whistler
' s mother
" to an american buyer
( palyed by burt reynolds
, in the type of bited part thgat his succsess inwhich
" boogie nights
" should hopefully do away withthe
)
. now how or why mr
. bean is sent on this trip mkaes noone sense
, anbd i can
' t even describe how the film explains it
. the point is that mr
. bean comes to amercia anbd causes wacky trouble
. problems problems problems
, where tothe begin
? first
, the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score thta is either at times one note away from thte score from
" beetlejuice
" or noe onot away fomr the score from
" rob roy
"
.
then
, the song choices are totally uninspired
.
" ogod vibrations
"
?
" i love l
. a
.
"
? wow
, don
' t put any
thought into that guys
. also
, bean makes way too much noise in the film
. the charactor doesn
' t speak much
, bu in the series you really only heard teh laughter of the audience
, annd mabye the occasional murmur from mr
. bean
. each episode was like a chaplin silent movei
. in the film
, bean is constantly moaning
, grunting
, whining
, etc
. it
' s annoying
,
and jstu plain wrong for the character
. tjhe main problem
though isnt that it
' s just nto funny
. with each episode of the series there owudl be dozens ofthe really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes
. multiply that running time by three howver
,
and yhe laughs steadily decrease
. they even haev the gaul tothe repeat jokes from the series
. sad
, adn creatively lazy
. as a series
,
" mr
. bean
" only ran for baout 13 epidsodes or so
. why on earth did atkinson
and thte gang decide it ws time to completelyl rework everthing
? 13 half
- hour episodes certainly hadn
' t exhausted all possible situations
. all i cxan say positively for the film at this point is that it
' s almost appropiate for all aegs
, if it wasn
' t for a cuple ofthe scenes where it appears as
though mr
. bean is haveing sex wiht things
.
and even that isn
' t a very positive statment
. please guys
, go back to engl
and
and go back tothe television so you
' ll make me laugh agina
.
