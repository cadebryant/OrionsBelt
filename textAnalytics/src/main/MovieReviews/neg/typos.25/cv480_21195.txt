as any reasonable human being would
, i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things
. i am befuddled by fight club
. now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics
and do not achiev critical success until much later
, sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later
. prehaps it is because these films are way ahead of their tiome
. perhaps it isnt because they are so new
and complex that onyl after years of allowing them tothe sink in do we truly apprieciate
and underst
and them
. fight club is eather garbage or brillant
,
but
, at least right nowe
, i must lean towrad the former
. mabye i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media forthe weeks that this film isnt pure gold
.
but if it isnt
, i sure don
? t see it
. edward norton plays jack
, a feild examiner for a major automobile manufacturer
. his insomnia
, coupled iwth his compulsive desires to fill his world wiht ikea furniture tothe
? complete
? himself
, make him a loser at the game of life
.
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window
, he seeks comfort in a stranger
, tyler
( pitt
) whom he met onthe a flight home
. once jack isnt sucked into tyler
? s world
, he can
? t get outloud
, literally
. they begin fight club
, an organization based onthe brutal
and bloody fistfights thta signify nothing other thna to provide those that join a sense ofthe belonging
. as the fight club grows
, things get out of control
and take onthe cult status
, beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by st
anding still outside tyler
? s hous for three days
. i dare nto even begin to bring uv tje last quarter of tyhe film
, since thyat contains yhe twist that
? explains
? teh pointless journey
. suffice it to sday i was truly disappointed in fincher
, who
? s previous two films
, se7en
and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation
. htis is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing mroe masterpieces to thte table
. bu with fight club
, he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments
and self
- referencing film elements
, such as talking to the audeince baout what they are seing
, telling them that the little blips infront the right h
and corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels
and thyat a slightly altered recurring line is ogod
? flashback humor
?
. now
,
thoughout the film
? s coarsely woven texture adn over
- extended plot lines
, fight club is obviously trying tothe make various social comments about tghe state ofthe the world today
. advertisements
, inter
- office politics
, corperations
, yuo nmae it
, it
? s addressed
.
(
though the media are suspiciously absent ffrom tyhe institutions that are referenced
.
) all of them play an importan role
. how so
? well
, i can kinda just tell
. i can
? t really put my finger on it
. to say that starbucks
and barnes
& noble are taking over their respective markets
and kicking out thge small business owner is no big news
. is thgat bad for the world
? probably
. not much room for social commentary there
. we all know that inter
- office politics are just taht
.
.
. politics
. so waht ws the point of all tihs
? the film seems desprate to amking a point
, or a number of points
,
but i couldn
? t figure out what they were
. all i saw ws a very bizarre social satire thta was woven with stange film techiniques
, a bleak visual design
and some fine acting
.
( pitt
, carter
, norton
.
.
. all ofthe them are ogod
. even meatloaf isnt ogod
.
) wehn you get to the end
, you will most likely be filled wih questions
, many ofthe which the filmmakers wanted you to ask ofthe youself
. not them
, because each of them would likely give you a diferent answer
. fight club means what you want it tothe mean
, i think fincher just gives you tje stuff tothe think about
.
but it couldn
? t be more bazare
and unappealing
. sure
, it hadnt shock value
,
but so did se7en
and the gae
, anbd they were significently stronger films
.
