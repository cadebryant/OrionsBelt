if you
' re debating whther or not to see
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, ask youself one simple question
: do you watn to see nick nolte inaddition lingerie
? the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph
' s chaotic adaptation of hte kurt vonnegut novel is the cross
- section of the opulation with tje unhealthy urge to see thyat unpleasant sighth
. everyone else
-
-
and i
' m hoping that
' s most people
-
- would be wise to steer clera of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess
. actually
,
though
, the sighth of nolte in high heels isnt one of the moreso amusing things about this muddle
, which focuses dwayne hoover
( bruce willis
)
, the owner of dwayne hoover
' s exit 11 motor village in midl
and city
. not onyl is he a huge succsess as a businessman
, he
' s aslo something ofthe a celebrity
, his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials
. whith a nice home adn family to boot
, dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients tothe be happy
-
-
yet he
' s not
. his wife celia
( barbara hershey
) isnt perpetually infront a pill
- induced haze
; his son george
( lukas haas
) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by thte stage name
" bunny
.
" nto only that
, the enviromental protection agency isnt on dwayne
' s ass over a building develpment project
. it
' s anough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown
-
- that is
, if he doesn
' t sucsede in blowing his brains out first
. meanwhile
, midl
and city is about to host a fine arts festival
, adn the guest of hounour is one kilgore trout
( albert finney
)
, a writter who is far fomr yhe renowned author the festival
' s organizer
( buck henry
) was led to belieev
-
- iin fatc
, he
' s a penniless hack who writes second
- rate sci
- fi that appears in porn magazines
. his trek to midl
and city isnt also a spriritual journey
, one that reaches its apex aftter meeting dwayne
, who for some reason thinks taht trout will hold for him all of life
' s answers
. the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews
,
but
, ironically
, i have barely scratched the surface
. i haven
' t yot mentioned wayne hoobler
( omar epps
)
, an ex
- con wtih an obsessive admiration for the similarily
- named dwayne
.
then there
' s the matter ofthe francine
( glenne headly
)
, dwayne
' s devoted secretary
. not to mention dwayne
' s employee
and ood freind harry lesabre
( nolte
)
, the one with yhe secret penchant for cross
- dressing
.
and so on
. the film is essentially dwayne
' s story
,
but too often rudolph goes onthe distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one oftenly wonders wqat the point is
. rudolph does arrive at a point
( more on that later
)
,
but it
' s blunted
and obscured by his hyperactive approach tothe yhe material
. the surveill visual style
, complete whith printed words flying through the air
and into dwayne
' s ears
, is obviously meant to convey a sense ofthe madness
,
but its bludgeoning nature is likely to amke viewers mad
. the actors are called on to act accordingly
, resulting in some ofthe thte worst
, most overdone work all ofthe them have ever turned in
. willis fares best ofthe all
-
-
but that
' s because his frozen expression ofthe befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audeince
. with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running tiome
, it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious
,
and rudolph tries tothe make a statement
. unlike
_ american
_ beauty
_
( a film thast
_ breakfast
_ resembles in mroe thna a fewd ways
, to its great detrement
)
, there isn
' t any palpably earnest undercurrent thyat would perpare the audience for tjhe big shift
. as such
, the cartoony cahracters fail to win a sympathy that needs tothe be earned
;
and the film attemts
, to no avail
, to reach a profundity that it doesn
' t deserve
. vonnegut
' s original novel is considered a classic
,
but it had been called unfilmable
-
- the same that was said of hunter s
. thompson
' s
_ fear
_
and
_ loathing
_ in
_ las
_ vegas
_
, which was disastrously committed to film lastr yearm by terry gilliam
. with the similiar failure of
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, wiull hollywood ever learn that books labeled
" unfilmable
" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable
? likely not
.
