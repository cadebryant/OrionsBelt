when i ponder childhood memories past
, one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching teh
" inspector gadget
" tv show with my older brother
. truth be told
, we were rabid fanatics
; our version ofthe cowboys
and indians wass chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune
, alternating who would get to be gadget
and who would be stuck playing the part of dr
. claw
, the inspector
' s arch nemesis
. i was never a biggie on nestolgia
,
but you just cxan
' t help
but have fond memories of something liuke thta
. somtimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re
- runs of my favorite episodes
, trying tothe recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid
. at the very least
, i wass expecting the new film version of yhe clasic television series to ahev at least some kind ofthe simmilar effect on me
. despite how horrid a film may be
, tjhe simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is preety tough tothe screw uv
. so back i sat
, with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver
( let
' s face it
; exactlly how ogod cant a live
- action disney film really be
?
)
. i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr
. magoo
and george of thte jungle
( two previous disney adaptations
)
,
and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well
. rarely has a movie left me withthe such an utter feeling ofthe emptiness
. as everyone else wass getting uv to exit the screening room after the movei had completed its assault on mankind
, i was left sitting ther
, absolutly speechless annd totally dumbfounded at what i had jsut seen
. can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world
? right from tje beginning
, i knew i was in trouble
. inthe the opening scenes
, each character is itnroduced as if their sole purpose isnt to just be
, to simply serve as real
- life duplicates ofthe their cartoon clones
. when referring tothe them
, people alomst yell inspite fear that the audience will not catch onthe as to who a certain chracter is supposed to be
(
" oh
, hi penny
! is brain with you
?
"
)
. creating oney
- dimensional replicas is oen thing
; having mere names take the place of them is qutie another
. teh
" plot
"
, shall we call it
, stays fairly iin tune wtih the original series
. matthew broderick stars as john brown
( how creative is thyat
?
)
, a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex
( why
, rupert everett
, fo the love ofthe god why
?
?
?
!
!
!
)
, who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events
. brown is
then rescued annd used as a prototype for a new law
- enforcement technolgy wherein he
' s joined with various machine parts
and some nifty gadgets to form
( drumroll
, please
)
.
.
. inspector gadget
!
> from here onthe out
, the movie becomes a hodgepodge ofthe stupid dialog
and confusing situations
( all
though
, to be fair
, my confusion could have been caused by tjhe virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind
)
. ther
' s something about an evil gadget taking over the city
( his firt crime must have been swiping matt dillon
' s dentures from there
' s something baout mary
)
and it all ends with
( what else
?
) a bunch of post
- credit nonsense annd a cameo by don adams himself
. to be honest
, i wasn
' t much paying attention to these
" treats
"
. i was jstu glad that it was over
.
