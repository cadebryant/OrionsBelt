when i ponder childhood memories past
, one of the things that always springs immediately tothe mind is watching the
" inspector gadget
" tv show with my older brother
. truth be told
, we were rabid fanatics
; our verzion of cowboys
and indians was chasing each otehr aroud our coffee table to teh theme tune
, alternating who would get tothe be gadget
and who would be stuck playing the part of dr
. claw
, the inspector ' s arch nemesis
. i wass never a biggie on nostalgia
,
but you jsut can ' t help
but have fond memories of something like that
. sometimes i even find myself uv at 4am watching re
- runs of my favorite episodes
, trying tothe recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid
. at the very least
, i was expecting the new film verzion of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me
. despite how horrid a film may be
, the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up
. so bakc i sat
, with minumum expectations of what the movie would deliver
( let ' s face it
; exactly how good can a live
- action disney film really be
?
)
. i was wise enough tothe steer clear from the likes of mr
. magoo
and george of the jungle
( two previous disney adaptations
)
,
annd i wish to god that i hadnt been sharp enought to skip gadget as well
. rarely has a movei left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness
. as everyone eles was getting up to exit the screening room affter thte movie had completed its assfalt onthe mankind
, i was left sitting htere
, absolutely speechless
annd totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen
. can something this awful truly exsist inspite such an evolved world
? right from the begining
, i knew i was iin trouble
. in the oppening scenes
, each charcter isnt introduced as if their sole purpose is to jsut be
, tothe simply serve as real
- life duplicates of theri cartoon clones
. when referiang to them
, people alomst yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be
(
" oh
, hi penny
! isnt brain with yuo
?
"
)
. creating one
- dimensional replicas is oney thign
; having mere names take the place of them is quite another
. thte
" plot
"
, shall we call it
, stays fairly in tune with the original series
. matthew broderick stars as john brown
( how creative is that
?
)
, a security guard who isnt horribly injured by a pack ofthe ruthless businessmen headed by scolex
( why
, rupert everett
, for the love ofthe god why
?
?
?
!
!
!
)
, who himself is tranformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events
. brown isnt
then rescued
and used as a prototype fo a newyorker law
- enforcement technology wherein he ' s joined with various machine parts
and some nifty gadgets tothe form
( drumroll
, please
)
.
.
. inspector gadget
!
> from here onthe out
, the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog
annd confusing situations
(
although
, to be fair
, my confusion could have beeen caused by the virtual concussion the film wass inflicting upon my fragile mind
)
. there ' s something baout an evil gadget taking over the city
( his firt crime must have been swiping matt dillon ' s dentures from there ' s something about mary
)
and it all ends with
( what else
?
) a bunch ofthe post
- credit nonsense
and a cameo by don adams himself
. tothe be honest
, i wasn ' t much paying attention to these
" treats
"
. i was just glad that it ws over
.
