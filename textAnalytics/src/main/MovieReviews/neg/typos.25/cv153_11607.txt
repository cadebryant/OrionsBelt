tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy baout superficial peple in superficial careers
, all searching fo deeper meaning
. howver
, they won
' t find much meaning inthe the rela blonde
, annd not enough real humor
, either
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a struggling acotr
, or he claims to be one
, even
though he has noone credits under his belt
. his girlfriend
, mary
( catherine keener
) has noone pretensions baout her career
: she
' s a makeup artist
, working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
and supermodel of the month
, sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
. sahara
, who has adquired a new age spirituality fomr repeated viewing ofthe the little mermaid
, has an on
- again
, off
- again relationship with joe
' s best firend
, bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
.
however
, bob has gotten his biggest break
yet
: a starring role onthe a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly
( daryl hannah
)
, who may be that illusive woman he
' s always pursued
: a real blonde
. there are smoe moments of ogod humer in tjhe rela blonde
,
but not enough
. the best stuf is inspite throwaway details inthe the backgorund
, such as sahara
' s perfume ads
:
" depression
- it
' s not jsut a state of mind
"
.
but to find humor in the superficiality ofthe models
and actors is to shoot fish inthe a barrel
.
and
, unfortunately
, the film
' s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic
. take fo example thge film
' s framing device ofthe an old lady
and her dog
. the story serves absolutely no purpose
, makse little sense
, annd is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie
. matthew modine
and catherine keener hvea the most sympathetic characters in the film
,
but they
' re stuck infront the most boring plotlines
. modine whines
and complains adn woudl be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley
, who appears as anohter stuggling actor
. keener
' s chracter has a stronger edge
,
but teh insult self
- defense clas
( taught by denis leary
, no less
) she is stuck in makes little sense
. the movie
' s running time isnt under two hours
,
but it seems liuke it isnt well over it
. there
' s jstu nto anough humer to speed things along
,
and not enough meaning to propel any drama
.
