walken stars as a mobster who isnt kidnapped
and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids
. it seems that a woman has also been kidnapped
-
- she is the sister of one of them
( e
. t
.
' s henry thomas
)
and the girlfriend of another
( flannery
)
-
-
and tjhe asking price is
$ 2 million
, which said snots are unable to cough up alone
. they even cutted off walken
' s finger to show they mean busineses
, beccause they are despearte to save the woman
' s life
. suicide kings is a terrible film
. walken asside
, there isn
' t a single appealing casted member
. o
' fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance
. in an amusingly unironic scene
, walken plays poker with tyhe foursome
and describes each ofthe theri personalities to a tee
-
- it
' s as if he was reading the summary sheet forthe a casting director
. the plot isnt anohter issue entirely
. o
' fallon is someone whom i
' m betting hasnt seen reservoir dogs
and the usual suspects too many times
, for not onyl does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return
( do we really ened teh scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster
, which is entirely unrelated to both the story
and leary
' s character
, or thge numerous anecdotal sequences
?
)
,
but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess
, filled wtih crosses annd doulbe crosses annd triple crosses
.
.
. by tghe fourth big revelation
/ twist
, i hadnt completely tuned out
, wondering what on earth attracted these actors tothe the material
. recently a peer
, a fellow young filmmaker
, informed me that he had an idea for a movei about four guys
, the mob
,
and the fbi
. it occurred to me
then what
' s wrong with indies like suicide kings
: i suspect o
' fallon has never met a mobster
, is not a rich man
, doesn
' t deliver endless
" clever
" monologues to his friends about his favourite types ofthe boots
.
.
. in short
, these guys are just riffing on otehr movies
,
and in doing that
, making the same film over
and over anbd over again
. tarantino found his niche adn now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying tothe find tarantino
' s niche instead of carving theri own
