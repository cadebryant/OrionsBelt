infront this re
- make ofthe yhe 1954 japanese monster film
, godzilla is transformed into a
" jurassic park
" copy who swims fomr the south pacific to new york for noone real reason
and trashes the town
.
although smoe of the destruction is entertaining for a while
, it gets ood fast
. the film often makes no sense
( a several
- hundred foot tall biast hides in subway tunnels
)
, sports second
- rate effects
( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen
)
, lame jokes
( mayor ebert
and his assistant gene are never funny
)
, horrendous acting
( even matthew broderick is dull
)
and an unbelievable love story
( why would anyone want tothe git back together with maria pitillo ' s charachter
?
)
. there are other elements of the film thta fall flat
,
but going on would just be a waste of good words
. onyl for die
- hard creature feature fans
, this might be fun if yuo could check your brain at thge door
. i couldn ' t

( michael redman has written this colunm for 23 years
and has seldom had a mroe disorienting cinematic experience than seing both
" fear
adn loathing
"
adn
" godzilla
" in the same evening
