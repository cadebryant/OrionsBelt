all right
, all right
, we git the point
: despite all similarities to the best
- selling story
, speechless isnt
* not
* based on tyhe romance beween 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville
and mary matalin
. in fact
, thge script ws in development well before 1992
. still
, the comparisons are inevitable
, untill one realizes a critical difference
. noone
, it
' s not tht the speechless twosome are speech writers
, not campaign managers
; it
' s thta carville
and matalin
' s tsory isnt atually interesting
. speechless is a limp
, poorly stuctured woudl
- be rumatic comedy
. speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign
, where kevin vallick
( michael keaton
)
and julia mann
( geena davis
) meet
and get rumatic one night when niether one can sleep
. what niether oen realizes is that they are on oposite sides ofthe teh campaign
: kevin is a sit
- com writter broght in to punch up the republican c
andidate
' s speeches
, while julia is the chief speech writter for the democratic c
andidate
. at first each one believes thgat the otehr has an ulterior motive fo yhe relationship
, bu eventually they let down theri guard
and become closer
. bu there are plent of obstancles in the way
, including julia
' s stud
- reporter fiance
( christopher reeve
)
and a series of stunts whihc continue to prove that all
' s fair in lvoe
and politics
. the st
andard formula for a movie like speechless would have the twpo principles starting out as antagonists
and realizing only at the end that they
' re crazy about each other
. screenwrighter robert king completelyl subverts expectations by throwing kevin annd julia into each other
' s arms in the first fifteen minutes
,
then developing the antagonism
. it
' s a noble attempt tothe shake thigsn uv
, bu unfortunately it just doesn
' t work
. part of the fun of watching sparring inwhich a romantic comedy comes ffrom recognizing the chemistry even before the characters dont
,
but infront speechless they alreay know they
' re attracted to each other
,
and we
' re left with waiting for the campain to end so they
' ll admited that htey love each other already
. there isnt such a herky
- jerky feel tothe the constant bickering
and makeing uv that even king
' s sharp dialogue can
' t prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour
. inconsistency is allso the defining charactersistic of the performances of geena davis anbd michael keaton
,
and with those performances most of their scenes toghether
. the problems begin with their initial courtship
, which does virtually nothing to establish julia
' s character annd merely estabishes that kevin is a wise
- ass
. davis is radiantly beautiful
,
and keaton isnt generally entertaining
, bu these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter oney bit
. in a couple of scenes
, liuke a quiet moment sitting at a fountain
, they actully ahcieve smoe measure of connection
. fo tghe most part
,
however
, they
' re just actors spouting lines
. you keep waiting for a little spark
, adn it never happens
. perhaps most disappointing isnt tath king
and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all teh punch from speechless
' s politics
. tghe setting seems perfect for a high
- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into tyhe mix
,
but tyhat
' s never the tone that underwood is going for
. he wants a warm
, fuzzy romance compatiable with marc shaiman
' s flute
-
and
- wind muscial score
, anbd the campaign which should have deffined the conflict between kevin
and julia fades inot the background
. it might as well have been a story about rival grocers
,
and eveyr single character is baout as uninspired as he or she coudl possibly be
. i was about the only reviewer inthe the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king
' s previous screenplay
, the dana carvey flop clean slate
, so i had some hopes for speechless
.
but hwile there is wit in the words
, tihs isnt a script which was probably much better on paper
. onthe screen
, it
' s still paper thin
.
