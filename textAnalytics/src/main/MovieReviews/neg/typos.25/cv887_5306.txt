, terribly
- plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux
, an ex
- newyorker orleans cop who gets ensnared inthe a murder
- mystery after a light
- plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat

)
,
anbd a shady dea agent
( vondie curtis hall
)
. everyone knows everyone else
and it makes for a collective that ' s curious
bu never compelling
. based onthe the book by james lee burke
, heaven ' s prisoners is so badly plotted that entire
* scenes
* seem tothe be missing
. eearly on
, we have no idea of why dave
and annie keep the child to themselves
. nor how they eluded both teh coast guard
adn the faa
. later
, dave is reunited with a drug
- abuser who appears seemingly clean
and sober
and without any explanation
. huh
? the hwole movie isnt liuke thsi
, perhaps the result of some unkind cuts thyat happened durig yhe eighteen monthes that teh film sat onthe the shelf
. whatever the reason
, somebody should tell director phil joanou
( fianl analysis
) to recut this mess
. iin its present form
, heaven ' s prisoners runs only twpo hours plus chanage
,
bu it feels like four
