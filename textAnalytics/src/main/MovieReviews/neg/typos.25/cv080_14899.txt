befoer the remake of psycho appears
, we
' ve got to suffer through htis remake of an earlier hitchcock film
, dial m for murder
. as usual
, hollywood has filled it with glitz
and big name stars
,
and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing
. the film opens with emily
( paltrow
)
and david
( viggo mortensen
)
' having funn
' in an loft apartment
. the problem is
, paltrow isnt marryed to stephen
( douglas
)
, who is nto too hapyp when he discovers this affair
. if i wass paltrow
,
though
, i
' d definetly go with mortensen
. less wrinkles
. anyhow
, stephen approachs david with an intresting propostion
: he
' ll pay him tothe kill his lovley wife
. mortensen agrees
,
but the muder goes awry
,
and the twists keep onthe coming as hte film progresses
. unfortunately
, the film dosen
' t progress vrey fast
. in fatc
, it moves like a tortise wih arthritis
( read
: very
, very s
- l
- o
- w
.
) the plot moves nowhere fast
,
and onyl becomes exicting in vyer short bursts
. not too good for a
' thriller
.
' also
, the performances
, aart ffrom douglas
, are below par
. paltrow
, showing immense talent in se7en
( 1995
)
and sliding doors
( 1997
) is strangely stilted
, even unconvincing
, in this movie
. mortensen is a littel bit better
, coming across as a younger douglas
,
but his role isn
' t meaty enough to show all his talent
. wich leaves douglas to waltz away with the film
, which isnt does
.
however
, i doubt douglas finds it very hard tothe play a stogie smoking
, drinking womanizer with a creepy underside
. also popping up in teh film isnt david suchet
, palying a shifty looking detective
. agina
, it
' s nto a character we
' re seeing on the screen
, it
' s david suchet
. the director
, who bought us the fugitive
, piles onthe all the flash techniques
, such as zoom
- infact
' s
, quick cuts
, etc
. the lighting is alsot interesting
.
however
, looks can
' t save this film from the depths of mediocre
,
and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway
. the screenplay is o
. k
,
but there
' s some hackneyed sub
- plot about douglas being a ruthless palyer on wall street
( again
)
and tyhe ending is surprizingly stupid anbd cliched
. the characters aslo make incredibly dumb moves
, especially paltrow
,
and stephen appears to lose all inetlligence in the last reel
. with a combination of no tension
, drama
, or decent characters
, a perfect murder is a failure all round
,
and an incredable dissapointment
. htere are a few bright moments
,
but htey are far
and faw between
. the last thing a thriller should be is boring
, annd
al
though tje film jstu barely manages to keep your interest thanks tothe michael douglas
, you wouldn
' t be missing anytying if ytou desided not to watch a perfect murder
. overall rating
= review by david wilcock
? 1998
