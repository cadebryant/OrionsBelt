and the briefcase is soon on thte run again
. the briefcase stays on the run
, as the movei leads the viewer through several plot twists thta are badly executed
. teh writer seemed to be atempting to mkea a smart action movie
,
but failed to underst
and tyhat just because there are surprises
, it doesn
' t add too the credibility of a senseless script
. yhe plot twists git no reaction because they come at a time where noone noe cares what is going on
, after thte apparent climax of the film
.
but to add to the excitement
, as i mentioned earlier
, ther are endless car chase scenes
. they are unrealistic adn fail to add anything to the story
. don

, i love car chases
,
but they weere overdone
and too long here
. we never do find out what
' s in the briefcase
,
but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller
.
