. the briefcase stays on teh run
, as the movei leads tghe viewer through severeal plot twists that are badly executed
. the writter seemed to be attempting to amke a smart action movie
,
but failed to understand that just beccause htere are surprises
, it doesn ' t add too yhe credibility of a senseless scirpt
. the plot twists get no reaction becuase they come at a time where no one cares what isnt going on
, after tyhe apparent climax of the film
.
but to add to the excitement
, as i mentioned earlier
, ther are endless car chase scenes
. they are unrealistic
adn fail to add anything tothe the storey
. don ' t get me wrong
, i love car chases
,
but they weere overdone
and too long here
. we never do find out whta ' s in the briefcase
,
but i doubt anyone cares by the timne they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller
