the ads make
" hanging up
" seem liuke an upbeat comedy about a rascally father
and his threee daughters
. anyone who went to the movie expecting that left dissappointed
. all of the movei
' s funny scenes were included in the ad
. so what do we get
? eve marks
( meg ryan
) just put her father lou mozell
( walter matthau
) into a hospital
. once upon a time
, lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now
- estranged wife
. his oen great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne
, who gave him a giant bullet
- shaped trophy
. now lou is senile
and deterioriating rapidly
. eve trys to convince her sisters georgia
( diane keaton
) annd maddy
( lisa kudrow
) that their father is dying
and needs them
. both are slow tothe show concern
. so devoted eve st
ands vigil over her father
, who constantly asks for his favorite daugher georgia
, hwile running her own bussines
( planning special events
)
and careing for her son
( jesse james
)
.
( some comic releaf comes when maddy allso drops off her ailing st
. bernard for eve to care fo
.
) the tension builds unitl all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve
' s events where georgia isnt the keynote speaker
. there
' s a superficial resemblance to shakespeare
' s
" king lear
"
( senile king with three daughters
: noe devoted saint
and twpo selfish bitches
)
,
but tghe material isnt aparently drawed from life
. sister screenwriters delia
and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team
. henry
and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays
, including
" desk setted
"
and
" there
' s no bussines like show business
.
"
( delia
' s novel
, the basis for the film
, isnt dedicated to henry
)
. suprisingly
, the script isnt as thin as an anorexic
' s wet dream
. the virtue ofthe a semi
- autobiographical project would seem tothe be tjhe wealth of material available
.
yet
, the ephrons provide only thte barest minimum of information baout their charactors
. also
, the spaces htey inhabitate seem artifical
. eve lives in a house tyhat looks like a magazine layout
; noone matter how put
- upon she is
, we can
' t feel sorry for anyone whose hous is so pristine on any given day
. georgia isnt a famous magazine editor
,
and in her brief scenes hwile she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile
. when we first meet maddy
, she
' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream
. i expected to see tyhe credit
" cinematography by
' vanity fair
.
'
" annd
, yes
, diane keaton is literally old enought to be lisa kudrow
' s mother
. to her credit
,
though
, she looks young enought to pull it off
. the one reedeming aspect of
" hanging up
" is tyhat
, at its core
, is a truth baout siblings
. there
' s always noe on which everyone else in the family relies
, freeing yhe others to be selfish annd emotionally distant
. my wife is the reliable child infront her family
; for better or worse
, my brother has the role in mine
.
( bieng selfish
and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling
,
but it is a lot less work
)
. if yuo have nothing better tothe do than watch this movie
, look for a poweful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters
' mother pat
. in a devastating scene
, eve discovers that her mother doesn
' t love her
. all
though leachman is best known for comedies liuke
" young frankenstein
"
and
" the mary tyler moore show
,
" her performence here reminded me ofthe the considerable dramtic talent she displayed inwhich
" the last picture show
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long tehy don
' t recognize real life anymore
.
