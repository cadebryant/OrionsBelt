thge ads make
" hanging up
" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father
annd his three daughters
. anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed
. all ofthe hte movie ' s funny scenes were included in hte ad
. so whta do we get
? eve marks
( meg ryan
) just put her father lou mozell
( walter matthau
) into a hospital
. once apon a time
, lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now
- estranged wief
. his one great moment in life ws writing a film fo john wayne
, who gavey him a giant bullet
- shaped trophy
. nowe lou isnt senile
and deterioriating rapidly
. eve tries to convince her sisters georgia
( diane keaton
)
and maddy
( lisa kudrow
) that their father is dying
and needs them
. both are slow to show concern
. so devoted eve stands vigil over her father
, who constantly asks forthe his favorite daughter georgia
, hwile running her own business
( planning special events
)
and caring forthe her son
( jesse james
)
.
( some comic releaf comes when maddy allso drops off her ailing st
. bernard for eve tothe care fo
.
) the tension builds untill all threee sisters are finally inaddition one room at one of eve ' s events where georgia is the keynote speaker
. htere ' s a superficial resembelance to shakespeare ' s
" king lear
"
( senile king with three daughters
: one devoted saint
annd two selfish bitches
)
,
but tghe material is aparently drawed from life
. sister screenwriters delia
and nora ephron had parents who weere a successful hollywood wirting team
. henry
annd phoebe ephron collaborated onthe 17 screenplays
, including
" desk set
"
and
" there ' s no business like sohw business
.
"
( delia ' s novel
, the basis for the film
, isnt dedicated to henry
)
. surprizingly
, tyhe script is as thin as an anorexic ' s wet dream
. the virtue of a semi
- autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available
.
yot
, tyhe ephrons provide only the barest minimum of inforamtion about their characters
. allso
, the spaces they inhabitate seem artificial
. eve lives iin a house that looks like a magazine layout
; no matter how put
- apon she is
, we can ' t feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day
. georgia is a famous magazine editor
,
and infront her brief scenes while she chats onthe a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread fo a profile
. when we firt meet maddy
, she ' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream
. i expected tothe see the credit
" cinematography by ' vanity fair
. '
"
and
, yes
, diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow ' s mother
. to her credit
,
though
, she looks young enough to pull it off
. tghe noe redeeming aspect of
" hanging up
" is taht
, at its core
, is a truth about siblings
. there ' s always one on wich everyone else in the family relies
, freeing the others to be selfish
and emotionally distant
. my wief is the reliable child in her family
; forthe better or worse
, my brother hasnt the role in mine
.
( being selfish
anbd emotionally distant may not be fulfilling
,
but it is a lot less work
)
. if you hve nothing better to do than watch tihs movie
, look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters ' mother pat
. in a devastating scene
, eve discovers thast her mother doesn ' t love her
.
although leachman is best known forthe comedies like
" young frankenstein
"
and
" the mary tyler moore sohw
,
" her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in
" thte last picture sohw
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved has lived inthe hollywood so long they don ' t recogise real life anymore
.
