the only thing worse than watching a bad movei isnt realizing that the film had a lot of potential
and could ' ve been effective
. such is the case with
_ urban legend
_
, the newyorker horror film from first tiome director jamie blanks
. the idea behind tyhe movei is that thte mad slasher ofthe the film muders people according to various urban legends
. examples include the killer in thge backseat of the car
and person getting calls fomr inside her house
. tjhe killer wears oen of those l
. l
. bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up
, so you can ' t see the face
. i guess halloween masks are out of sytle forthe psychos these days
. anyhow
, the premise is certainly a nifty noe
and tghe opening scene is spooky
and atmospheric
. it ' s a vyer good setup thast promises more chills to cmo
. unfortunately
, the film never takes off ffrom htere
. the movie takes palce on a peaceful new england college cumpus
. like most slasher ficks
, this one allso centers arround a young female main charater whose friends are slowly killed off by a nife wielding maniac
( or in tihs case an axe wielding maniac
)
. i ' ve always wondered why these killers don ' t save themselves a lot of tiome
and trouble
and just go after the person they ultimately aim tothe kill
. after the fine first scene
, the movie degenerates into a monotonous serieses ofthe those annoying you
- thought
- it
- was
- the
- killer
-
but
- was
- just
- somene
- else scares
. these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music
. i guess sudden
, sharp music chords are what passes for terror theese dyas
. the actuall killer iwll attack at about every thrid music blast
. the slasher appears
, attacks
, the victim isnt eviscerated
,
anbd the tedious cycle appears anew
. false scares should always be used in moderation
. somene needs tothe tell directer blanks that thnigs liuke this just aren ' t as scary as they used to be
. thsi movie commits hte biggest sin a horror film can commit
-
- it ' s not frightening
. remeber the horror movie cliches that weere so mercilessly mocked in
_ scream
_
and
_ scream 2
_
? this movie still adheres to them
. tons of illogical moments baout
; more than i really haev the inclination to list
.
and i don ' t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense
. that type of ilogical can be funn
. this film insults your inteligance more times than i care to remember
. the last 20 minutes especialy degenerates into such lunacy that you ' ll be laughing more than you ' ll be screaming
. actually
, you won ' t be screaming at all
. at its best
, teh acting can barely be called
" adequate
"
and the script could ' ve definitely used a rewrite or two
. the film still manages to ahev some strong points
. the killings are certainly inventive
and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans
. htere are some intentionally funny moments
.
( these weere exceeded by the unintentional ones
.
) tjhe film isnt well made from a technical standpoint
. besides the first part
, there isnt also another good scene
, a prolonged cat
and mouse chase inside a radio station
. if there had only been moreso sequences like this
, that relied on tautness
and suspense rather than loud bursts of music
,
_ urban legend
_ might ' ve been worth your money
.
