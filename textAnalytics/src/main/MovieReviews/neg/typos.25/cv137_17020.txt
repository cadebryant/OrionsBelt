the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that teh film hadnt a lot of potential
and could
' ve beeen effective
. such is the case with
_ urban legend
_
, yhe new horror film from first tiome director jamie blanks
. thge idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends
. examples include thge killer in tje backseat of the car
and person getting calls from inside her house
. tje killer wears one of those l
. l
. bean parkas witht yhe hood drawn completely up
, so you cin
' t see the face
. i guess hallwoeen masks are out ofthe style fo psychos these days
. anyhow
, the premise is certainly a nifty one
and thte opening scene is spooky
and atmospheric
. it
' s a very good setup thyat promises omre chills tothe come
. unfortunately
, the film never takes off from ther
. hte movie takes place onthe a peaceful newyorker engl
and college campus
. like most slasher flicks
, this one also centers around a young female main carachter whose friends are slowly killed off by a nife wielding maniac
( or in tihs case an axe wielding maniac
)
. i
' ve always wondered why these killers don
' t savve themselves a lot of time
and trouble
and just go affter tyhe person they ultimately aim to kill
. affter the fine first scene
, the movie degenerates into a monotonous series ofthe those annoying you
-
thought
- it
- was
- the
- killer
-
but
- was
- just
- somene
- else scares
. these are always accompanyed by loud bursts ofthe music
. i guess sudden
, sharp music chords are waht passes for terror these dyas
. the actuall killer will attack at baout eveyr third music blast
. tjhe slasher appears
, attacks
, the victim is eviscerated
,
and the tedious cycle appears anew
. false scares shoud alwyas be unsed in moderation
. someone needs to tell director blanks thyat thigsn like this jstu aren
' t as scary as they used tothe be
. this movie commits yhe biggest sin a horror film can commit
-
- it
' s not frightening
. remeber thge horror movei cliches that weere so mercilessly mocked in
_ scream
_
and
_ scream 2
_
? this movie still adheres to them
. tons of illogical moments about
; more than i really ahev tje inclination tothe list
.
and i don
' t mean ilogical inwhich the summer popcorn movie sence
. tyhat type of illogical can be fun
. this film insults your intelligence more times than i care tothe remember
. the last 20 minutes especialy degenerates into such lunacy that you
' ll be laughing more thna you
' ll be screaming
. actually
, you won
' t be screaming at all
. at its best
, the acting cin bearly be called
" aequate
"
and the script could
' ve definitely used a rewrite or two
. hte film still manages to have some strong points
. tjhe killings are certainly inventive
and plentiful enought to satistfy most gore fans
. there are some intentionally funny moments
.
( these were exceeded by tyhe unintentional ones
.
) thge film isnt well made from a technical st
andpoint
. besides the first part
, ther isnt also another ogod scene
, a prolonged cat
and mouse chase inside a radio station
. if there had only been more sequences liek thsi
, that relied on tautness
and suspense rether than loud bursts of music
,
_ urban legend
_ might
' ve been worth your money
.
