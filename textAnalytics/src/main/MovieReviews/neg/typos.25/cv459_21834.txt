( bob gunton
)
, in response tothe why he created evil bats
. alright folks
, stop me if you
' ve heard this one
: genetically altered animals wreak havoc onthe a town
and a small b
and of locals
, assisted by a specialist in the parituclar animal
' s field
, must team up to stpo the mutant creatures befor they can mutiply
and spread acros the earth
. oh yeah
, yhe military isnt on their way to bomb the twon as well
, so htey are runnung short on time
. sound familiar
? such is teh plot of the destination films release of bats
. dina meyer stars as tghe
" bat specialist
" sheila
, who is pulled fomr her reasearch
( along with her annoying sidekick
, played wtih irritating deftness by leon
) inaddition order tothe help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens
and animals have beeen chewed to death recently
. wiht thge help of the local sheriff
( lou dimond phillips
)
, a cdc official
( carlos jacott
)
,
and a scientist
( bob gunton
)
, sheila discovers it isnt indeed bats
( who have beeen genetically altered by gunton
' s character tothe be moreso ggressive annd omniverous
, in order tothe be used as a military weppon
!
)
. i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film
. there
' s not a frome of promotional footage i ahve seen forthe the film that would have led me tothe believe it ws going tothe be any good
. in thsi respect
, tje film never disapointed me
. this film reaches a level that transcends the
" so bad it
' s good
" level anbd borders on tyhe downright insane
. teh effects are awful
, the script is contrived
,
and for most of the feature i was laughing at things thyat were supposed to be taken seriously
( i thikn
)
. i challenge anyone to sit thru the scene
, where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while anyother bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner
, wtih a straight face
. thankfully
, tje performances are as ogod as they can be considering the material the actors hadnt tothe perform wiht
. dina meyer has always been thte highlight of any ofthe the films she has been in
( johnny mnemonic
, dragonheart
,
and starship troopers
.
.
. the latter being the only film out of thgat batch with any actual merit
)
,
and this one is no exception
. while one never really gets the impression that meyer
' s chracter could be a bat expert infact reality
, one never really cares to doubt it either
. she gives as good a performance as sould be expected
, plus she
' s nice to look at for an hour adn a half
. lou dimond phillips is also serviceable here
, as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero
.
al
though when we first meet his charater he knows bats are the reason forthe what
' s going on in town
, for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn thgat the actual cause ofthe the deaths in town are because of bats
. the only bad performance in the film is that ofthe leon
' s
. he is relegated to hte
" i
' m not sticking arund here
!
" charachter
and proceeds to repeat varations of taht line for the majority ofthe the film even
though he stays
. anyone who can
' t immediately tell that bob gunton
( the bad guy infront patch adams anbd countless other films
) is going to eventually turn on the gang adn side whith his creations before his emminent death will probably be suprised
,
but i highly doubt it
. even if he hadn
' t been the villain in just about every film he
' s ever been infact
, so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious ect that it holds no shock whatsoever
. in fatc
, his death is welcome
, because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale
. if the plot doesn
' t soudn ridiculous to you yot
,
then check out these little tidbits
: a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses wehn a polical officer cocks his pistol
. an entire town disregards tyhe sheriff anbd doctor
' s orders tothe stay indoors after a curfew is instigated
, causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force
, killing several townsfolk
. a govenment official blows off shelia
' s instructions
( to wait until dawn tothe install a cooling unit in yhe bats
' cave that will kill all of them off
) by pulling a night job
, resulting inthe tjhe death of an entire military unit
. a cavren full ofthe bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it
. finally
, to top it all off
, this little texas town is showing nosferatu inaddition it
' s single screen theather
( for reference
, our town has over a million people in it whith nearly 150 movie screens
,
and we
' re lucky to even get kevin smith
' s dogma
)
. the most laughable part of the movie
though comes ffrom the ill
- conceived bat puppets
. while the actuall bat attack scenes are shot witht repid fire editting
( makeing tjhe scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what
' s going on
)
, tje scenes where a bat is called upon tothe interact with a live ator are usally shot more low
- key
. therefore we the audiance git loving close
- ups of tyhe most unrealistic
, rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film
. bieng able to see the puppeteer
' s arms would be thge onyl thnigs that could have made these creations worse
. aftter all ofthe this
, if ytou still decide bats might be the movei forthe you
, don
' t say yuo haven
' t beeen warned
. trust me wehn i say that it
' s a lot more fun tothe trash than it is to sit through
. i just wish that dina meyer woudl be cast inwhich more roles or at least choose better films tothe appear in
. she
' s definitely a talent thyat is going to waste in films like these
.
