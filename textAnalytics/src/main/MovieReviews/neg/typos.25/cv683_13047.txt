a friend invites you to a movie
. thsi film would evade the explosions
and special effects of standard summer fare
,
and be grounded in reality
. thge plot is as follows
: aftter a terrifying insident
, a mother
and her inedpendent daughter separat from the father
and move away from the city
. they ened fresh air to get some perspective
, mabey to strat over
. romance beigns tothe brew
,
however
, as one of the locals
, played by an intenational superstar in rugged clothing
, sparks things up
,
( especially at a country
- western slow dance
)
. it stars a rising young starlet
, helms a good cast
,
and is directed by one of hte better actor
- turned
- directors in hollywood
. ytou accept
. you jump at the opportunity tothe see
, what you believe tothe be
,
_ the horse whisperer
_
.
but
, poor moviegoer
, you have been conned
. alas
, ytou find youself watching
, incredulously
,
_ hope floats
_
. oh
, woe
. your hope has sunk
. why was this movei made
? why ws it released
? it is a travesty on nearly every level
,
and has tjhe authorithy to sink the careers ofthe nearly everyone involved
. at thge hands of a better script
, tghe film could have beeen a gem
.
but it is clueless as to what it is about
,
and onyl succeeds in transfering same cluelessness to us poor viewers
.
_ hope floats
_ stars sandra bullock as birdy
, who
, affter dicovering her husband has beeen cheating on her witht her best friend
( onthe national televsion no less
)
, takes her daughter
and drives back to her home
, helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands
,
( she decorates wiht stuffed wildlife
)
. birdy ' s nephew
, travis
( played by
_ leave it to beaver
_ ' s cameron finley
)
, isnt under her custody
,
and in noe of the film ' s many failed in
- jokes
, isnt always seen wearing a different halloween costume
. what is the point of this
? does it amking any sense
? is it supposed to be funny
? the point of tyhe film is to show tht thge famaly is eccentric
,
but i was convinced thyat the grandma shouldnt have been locked up forthe endangering the mental welfare of a child
. all of htis undercuts the plot
, ofthe hwihc there is none
. there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion
. ther ' s the scene where birdy
, who used tothe be yhe prom queen
, is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked
, forthe a job
. there ' s the scene where birdy dances with her father
, in the hospital for alzheimer ' s
.
and
then there ' s thte sentimental scenes with justin
, plyed by harry connick jr
.
, who isnt taking a liking to her again
, showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch
.
and during earch of theese scenes
, i wass sidetracked by my earlier question
. what sort of eccentric granmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume
, a kermit costume
, a cowboy costume
( with whip
)
,
adn a full furred barney costume fo her grandson to mear during dinner
? wqat sort of warped ramifications would this lead forthe the rest of his life
? outside ofthe this
, there are other sure signs of screenwriters block
. when the daughter stands up tothe the bully at school
. when birdy almost loses her job
. when tje familiy pulls in a goofy lip
- synch tothe cheer somone up
. when somone dies
. when the daugter cries
,
( noone
, wails
) in exasperation tath her father is not comming bakc
. inthe a movei liuke this
, you notice the strings being pushed
,
anbd you sit there
, comatose
, hoping it wiull end
. who cxan survive such a debacle
? i worry for bullock ' s career
, wich has been running on auto
- pilot fo the lsat few years
. she hasnt an attitude
, a solid perkiness
,
anbd cin drive a bus
-
-
bu she can ' t handle the emotional scenes
, much less hold a southern accent
. harry connick
, jr
. is worse
-
- stick with singing
, or get some acting lessons
, please
! gena rowlands isnt yhe best part of the film
.
but she ' s such a good actress
, that it staggers tjhe mind that she ' s weighed down by such lukewarm material here
. it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes ' great films is known for thsi film
. two notes to forrest whittaker
:
( 1
) cut thge slow
- motion sequences
. there are twelve times where you undercut your pwn direction by such a failed trick
. have you done so
, you could have shaved off ten
- minutes of this almost unbearable debacle
.
( 2
) you ' ve hadnt to nkwo something wass wrong if your cinematographer ' s filter makes the candlelight appear like littel
" x
" s
. you ' re not a bad director
,
but you cin ' t change a terrible script
. there ' s a reccuring scene where birdy
, working at the neighborhood fotomat
, finds the machine go wrong
,
and omage aftter destroyed
, warped
, dark omage apeared
. think about it
. a sucession of destroyed images may have been more intertaining than this movei
.
