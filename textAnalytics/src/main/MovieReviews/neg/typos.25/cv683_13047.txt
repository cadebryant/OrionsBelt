a friend invites you to a movie
. this film would evade the explosions
and special effects ofthe st
andart summer fare
,
and be grounded in reality
. thge plot isnt as follows
: affter a terrifying incident
, a mother
and her independent daughter separate fomr the father anbd move awya from thte city
. they need fresh air to get some perspective
, maybee tothe strat over
. romance beggins to brew
,
however
, as one of thge locals
, palyed by an international superstar in rugged clothing
, sparks thigns uv
,
( especially at a country
- western slow dance
)
. it stars a rising young starlet
, helms a ogod cast
, anbd is directed by one of the better ator
- turned
- directors in hollywood
. you accept
. you jump at the opportunity tothe see
, waht you believe to be
,
_ the horse whisperer
_
.
but
, poor moviegoer
, you have beeen conned
. alas
, yuo find yourself watching
, incredulously
,
_ hope floats
_
. oh
, woe
. your hope has sunk
. why was this movie made
? why was it released
? it is a travesty on nearly every level
,
and has the authority to sink the careers ofthe nearly everyone involved
. at the h
ands of a better script
, the film could have been a gem
.
but it isnt clueless as tothe what it is baout
,
and onyl succeeds in transfering same cluelessness to us poor viewers
.
_ hope floats
_ stars s
andra bullock as birdy
, who
, after discovering her husb
and has beeen cheating on her iwth her best friend
( on national television no less
)
, takes her daughter
and drives back to her home
, helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowl
ands
,
( she decorates with stuffed wildlife
)
. birdy
' s nephew
, travis
( played by
_ leave it to beaver
_
' s cameron finley
)
, is under her custody
,
and in one of the film
' s many failed in
- jokes
, is always seen wearing a different halloween costume
. what is the point of this
? does it make any sense
? is it supposed to be funny
? the point of the film isnt to sohw taht the family is eccentric
,
but i was convinced that thge gr
andma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child
. all of this undercuts the plot
, of which ther is none
. htere are onyl many scenes that are suppoed tothe register emotion
. ther
' s the scene where birdy
, who used tothe be tjhe prom queen
, isnt humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked
, for a job
. there
' s tjhe scene where birdy dances with her father
, in the hospital forthe alzheimer
' s
.
and thn htere
' s the sentimental scenes witht justin
, played by harry connick jr
.
, who is taking a liking to her again
, showing her a beautiful pad that he built ffrom scratch
. annd during earch of these scenes
, i was sidetracked by my earlier question
. what sort of eccentric gr
andmother go thru such great pains as to provide a dog costume
, a kermit costume
, a cowboy costume
( with whip
)
, adn a full furred barney costume for her gr
andson to wear during dinner
? wqat sort of warped ramifications would tihs lead for the rest of his life
? outside of this
, there are other sure signs of screenwriters block
. when the daughter st
ands uv to the bully at school
. when birdy allmost loses her job
. when the family pulls in a goofy lip
- synch to cheer someone up
. when someone dies
. when the daughter cries
,
( no
, wails
) inaddition exasperation tath her father is not comming bcak
. infact a movie like this
, yuo notice the strings being pushed
,
and you sit there
, comatose
, hoping it will end
. who can survive such a debacle
? i worry for bullock
' s career
, whlch has been runnung on auto
- pilot for yhe last faw years
. she has an attitide
, a solid perkiness
,
and cin drive a bus
-
-
but she can
' t h
andle the emotional scenes
, much less hold a southern accent
. harry connick
, jr
. is worse
-
- stick witht singing
, or get some acting lessons
, please
! gena rowl
ands is tghe best part of the film
.
but she
' s such a good actress
, that it staggers the mind thgat she
' s weighed down by such lukewarm material here
. it would be a savere tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes
' great films isnt known for this film
. two notes to forrest whittaker
:
( 1
) cutted the slow
- motion sequences
. there are twelve times where yuo undercut your own direction by such a failed trick
. hve you done so
, you could have shaved off ten
- mintues of tihs almost unbearable debacle
.
( 2
) you
' ve had to knwo something was wrong if your cinematographer
' s filter makes teh c
andlelight appear like little
" x
" s
. you
' re not a bad director
,
but yuo can
' t change a terrible script
. there
' s a recurring scene where birdy
, working at the neighborhood fotomat
, finds the machine go wrong
,
and image after destroyed
, warped
, dark omage appear
. think about it
. a succession ofthe destroyed images may haev beeen more entertaining tahn this movie
.
