tje tagline for thsi film is
:
" soem houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn ' t expect too much from this
.
but i hadnt preserved a littel spark of ope as i entered the theatre
. i thought
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
anbd jan de bont
. i throught
, mabe it will be funn
?
and in fatc the beginning ws rather intriguing
.
but by the end of it i thought
: why liam neeson
and cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these great actors are basicly helpless withthe this muddled mess tath defies any rationality
. here isnt hte story
: in the monstrously over
- decorated mansion known as hill house
, vistors are tricked by an unknown doctor
( liam neeson
) inot being guinea pigs infront a fright experiment under tje guise of an insomnia investigation
. amonst them is a sophisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
adn a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. actually
, tghe doctor is researching the
" primordial fear reaction
"
and intends to plant disturbing idaes inthe his subjects
and watch what happens
.
bu he gets unexpected help from the house itself
. it rumbles
, hums
and belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
and billowy curtains
.
but the computarized spooketeria rarely fiels real
, placing an emotional wall betwen audience
and screen
. the second half of the film is basically baout the main heroine runnung back
and forth ffrom the sinister lamps
adn evil furniture
. is that exciting or wqat
? the worst thing about it is taht it didn ' t have to be bad
. it ' s based on a great book
,
`
` tjhe haunting of hill house
, ' ' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptation of the book was csary
and intteligent
. it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience
.
" the blair witch project
"
, that cost less than an old car
, managed to shock
and terrify the audiences from their senses
.
and with a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
and screenwriter david self make hash outloud of a perfectly lovely piece ofthe terror
. de bont has a style of filmmaking so outloud of line with the material thgat it is
, in itself
, frightening
. he is the master of tyhe extravagent speshal effect
and the big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a more serious material
? in the end
" haunting
" will onyl haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont ' s career as a director
.
yet it wouldn ' t be fair tothe sday that everything isnt bad
. the effects are truely impressive
adn the house is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautiful
, mysterious
, magical
and spooky
.
but this is where the good things end
. the music isnt blaring
, the floors moving
, the ceiling morphing
and the pictures on the walls screaming
-
-
annd all ofthe this
, eveyr second
, every moent of screen time
, is absolutely wihtout life
. it ' s nothing mroe tahn a special effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
bu intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn ' t engage
. at first you do not know what ' s going on
. is this part of hte experiment
? are theese hallucinations
? projections ofthe the subconscience
? paranoia
?
bu in the end it shows outloud that htis is actually happening
. the house is actually posessed
. it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment dissapears out of teh window
. for ever
, i sat in anticipation fo a decent climax
and that ' s what i got
? i believe hichock once said tath
" it ' s better to wait for a climax
, than to see one
"
. this may be true
,
and it might actually work
,
but htere is only oen probelm
-
- jan de bont isnt not hichock
and hte things that he shows are not scray
, only stupid
. tehy are impossible to take seriously
. any paralells that ytou might ahev herad befor
, linking this picture to kubrick ' s
" the shining
"
, are absolutely baseless
.
" shining
" had class
, sytle
, story
, acting
,
bu most of all talent
and originality
.
" haunting
" has only special effects
annd art direction to boast of
.
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film
. casting ogod actors for small
, pale parts onyl makes things worse
.
but i guess that no matter waht i or other critics say or write
, most ofthe you iwll see this film anyway
, even if the tagline would say
:
" some films are just born stupid
"
.
