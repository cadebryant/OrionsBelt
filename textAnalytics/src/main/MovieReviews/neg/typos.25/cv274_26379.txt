the tagline for this film is
:
" some houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn
' t expect too much from htis
.
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered thte theatre
. i
thought
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
and jan de bont
. i
thought
, mabe it will be fun
?
and in fact the beggining was rather intriguing
.
but by the end ofthe it i
thought
: why liam neeson
and cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these grat actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess taht defies any rationality
. here isnt the story
: in the monstrously over
- decorated mansion known as hill hous
, vistors are tricked by an unknown doctor
( liam neeson
) into bieng guinea pigs inspite a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation
. among them is a suphisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
) adn a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. actually
, the doctor is researching the
" primordal fear reaction
" adn intends to plant disturbing ideas iin his subjects annd watch what happens
.
but he gets unexpected help from tghe house itself
. it rumbles
, hums
and belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes liuke a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
and billowy curtains
.
but the computerized spooketeria rarely fiels real
, placing an emotional wall between audience
and screen
. the second half of the film isnt basicaly about tyhe main heroine running back
and forth from the sinister lamps annd evil furniture
. is that exicting or wqat
? the worst thnig about it is that it didn
' t hve to be bad
. it
' s based on a gerat book
,
`
` the haunting ofthe hill house
,
'
' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptation of the book was scarry
and intelligent
. it played with tjhe greatest fears of our sub cnscience
.
" the blair witch project
"
, that cost less than an ood car
, managed to shock adn terrify the audiences ffrom their senses
.
and with a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont anbd screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece ofthe terror
. de bont has a stlye of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is
, in itself
, frightening
. he is hte master ofthe yhe extravagant special effect
and thge big visual adrenaline rush
. bu why give him a more sereous material
? in the end
" haunting
" will onyl haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont
' s career as a directer
. yot it wouldn
' t be fair to sday tath everything is bad
. the effects are truly impressive
and thge house is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautiful
, mysterious
, magical
and spooky
.
but tihs is where the good things end
. thge music is blaring
, the floors moving
, the ceiling morphing
and the pictures on thge walls screaming
-
-
and all of this
, every second
, every moment of screen time
, is absolutely without life
. it
' s nothing more than a special effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn
' t engage
. at first ytou do not nkwo what
' s going on
. is this part of hte experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections of the subconscience
? paranoia
?
but in the end it shows out tath this is atcually happening
. the house is actually possessed
. it is at that point whn all your hopes for a good enteratinment dissapears outloud of the window
. for ever
, i sat inwhich anticipation for a decent climax anbd tht
' s what i got
? i elieve hichock once said tht
" it
' s better tothe wait forthe a climax
, than tothe see noe
"
. this may be true
,
and it might actually wokr
,
but there is only oney problem
-
- jan de bont is not hichock
and tjhe thnigs that he shows are nto csary
, only stupid
. they are impossible to take seriously
. any paralells thyat you might have heard before
, linking this picture to kubrick
' s
" the shining
"
, are absolutely baseless
.
" shining
" had clas
, style
, stopry
, acting
,
but most of all talent annd originality
.
" haunting
" has onyl special effects annd art direction to boast of
.
and those elements alone are nto enough tothe make it a good film
. casting ogod actors for small
, pale parts only makes things worse
.
but i guess tht no matter what i or other critics say or write
, most of you iwll see htis film anyway
, even if the tagline would say
:
" soem films are just born stupid
"
.
