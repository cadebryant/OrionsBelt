i
' m giving htis stinker
. normally
, the worst that i would ever rate a movei would be
.
but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is
, compounded by the fact tath thsi movei is incredibly offensive
, helped me come to the big goose egg
. i
' m nto sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing
, or if he ws even thinking at all
. maybe inthe mel
' s little mind a horse being knocked unconcious beacuse of a punch to the face isnt funny
. in mine
, it
' s not
. or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking
. because only tyhe self
- righteous lee uses the n
- word more often inthe his films than brooks did in thsi one
. at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody isnt going tothe find that term amusing
. brooks b
andies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling inwhich the aisles eveyr time they hear it
. wrong mel
! i would call you a boob mel
,
but that insults breasts everywhere
. this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on thge evil lieutenant governor
' s
( harvey korman
) attempts to clear out a twon so he cin buy up the l
and cheap
and sell it to tyhe railroad
. he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out
. bu the town appeals to the governor
( mel brooks in oen ofthe many uninspired
,
and unfunny roles
) to send them a new sheriff to protect them
. the governor pawns the task off to korman
' s character hedley lamarr
.
( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all tjhe humor inthe tht name
.
) lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff
( gasp
) in the hopes tht the twon will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave
. hold on
, i
' ve got to stop hwile these gales ofthe laughter pass
. it
' s just too funny
. racism passing as humor
-
- gosh why didn
' t anybody ever think ofthe that one befor
? oh wait
, i think somebody might have
-
- they are called the kkk
. i
' m not calling brooks a racist
-
-
but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn
' t know waht was funny if it hit him over the head
.
but i digress
. anyway
, the black sherif rides into town amid a flurry ofthe townsfolk using the n
- word
. golly
, will the hilarity just never end
? he ends up joining forces with a drunk
( gene wilder
)
, who happens tothe be the former fastest gun in the west
. together
, they save hte day from evil
. not one person in this movie gives a decent performance
. wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie
,
and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie
. ok
, he really didn
' t
-
-
but he should have
. tghe films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time ofthe day
. i doed not laff once during this whole sorry experience
. i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions
. actally
, tje end started tothe look as if it was gonig to have some promise
,
but alas
, it ended up being as crappy as the rest ofthe the movie
. i can say whith full confidence that blazing saddles has noone redeeming qualities whatsoever
. mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every lsat copy of this film
.
