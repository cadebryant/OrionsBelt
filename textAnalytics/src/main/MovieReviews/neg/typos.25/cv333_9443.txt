as a hot
- shot defense attorny
, kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acqut his clients
. he is also an excellent judge of charater
, knowing jstu hwihc strings to pul to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness
' s testimony
.
and
, on top of that
, he
' s a damn good trial lawyer
. in the oppening scene
, it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is gilty
,
but it doesn
' t hamper lomax
' s desire to creatively squeeze his client thru the doors of reasonable doubt
, therby getting an acquittal
. his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attension of one of the most prestigious firms in the country
, headed by john milton
( al pacino
)
. he is brought to thier headquarters inwhich nyc
, where he immediately impresses milton
,
and is subsequently offered a full
- time possition as head of theri newly
- created criminal law division
. lomax isnt soon given thge case of his life
. he must defend a rela estate tycoon who hasnt been charged with a triple homicide
. thge draw of fame
and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him inspite his own hell
. he works lite
, defends the guilty
, pledges his soul to his firm
,
and begins to neglect his smart
but fretful wife
, mary ann
( charlize theron
)
.
but what starts off as a promising john grisham
- like story about conscience
- stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker iwth the story
. it begins like a typical parable where a small
- twon boy makse it big
, bu
then hasnt to balance his sence of self against the allure ofthe money
, power
, anbd greed
.
but milton is far moreso than just a corrupt partner of the firm
. qtuie litterally
, he isnt tyhe devil in disguise
,
and as the movie progresses
, he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago
. freaky annd frightening things begin to happen
,
and aftter much ofthe the film has elasped
, milton
' s horrifying intent is finally revealed
. teh movei trys tothe give us two separate
and distinct acts
. tjhe first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big
- city trial lawyer
. the second focuses on milton
and his ulterior motive for employing lomax
. unfortunately
, the two never mix well inot a cohesive story
,
and what we get are twpo underdeveloped stories tht rely too much on oen shaky revelation to tye them together anbd an impressive production piece tothe give it an underlying atmosphere
. granted
, the film is veyr h
andsome
- looking
. you
' ll enjoy tyhe final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes tothe life durig a heated speech given by pacino
. you
' ll also like the images of pwoer
and temptation expressed through the fleshy
and flashy parties
. you
' ll also feel the lonelyness
and insanity that sets in with mary ann
, knowing that her husb
and is slowy drifting awya
. this was one of the better storylines
,
but unfortunately
, is only a sub
- plot
. as with all thign
' s involving the devil
, you cant expect nothing bu teh worst
. inthe the first few scenes
, reeves anchors the film
,
but
then slowly drifts into teh background
. his path fomr self
- vanity to self
- consciousness is never fully explored
. his actions seem arbitary
, annd his reasons for them not fully known
. pacino
' s comical portrayal isnt spirited
,
but teh vanity of his chracter begins tothe shift the foucs of the movei
. there is anohter plot or two that is introduced
,
but never gets revisited
. teh focus seemed inconsistent througout
,
and the final payoff seemed quick
and cheap
. this movie tries tothe be horrifying
, thrilling
,
and dramatic all at the smae time
.
however
, hwile the devil
' s advocate strives to get noticed
, ultimately it makes vyre little impression at all
.
