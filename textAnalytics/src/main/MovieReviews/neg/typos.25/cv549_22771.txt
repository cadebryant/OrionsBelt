cradle will rock is the latest effort from director
/ actor tim robbins
. while he may have hadnt an oscar worthy film back in 1995
( dead man walking
)
, he gets a little overconfident
and sloppy here
. the story is confusing
,
and filled with many subplots
, so i
' ll try my best
and explain it as simply as possible
. the film isnt based on a
" mostly
" true story about a federal theather in the 1930s
, that produced a play
( the cradle will rock
) that aparently was offensive to soem
, so the government shuts it down
. it
' s durring the time of the depression
,
and all this theater wants to do is entertain
and cheer up those who do nto have jobs
, or are poor
. betwen this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots
, about those who work in theater
, or those associated
. alsot allong tghe way are soem other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experienc
. tim robbin
' s just keesh piling on political views
,
and characters
, tath we just give up on tje film
, or infront some cases walk out
. for robbin
' s it may be a nice achievement
,
but to me it seemed more like a freindly get together wih slightly more sophisticated dialogue
, annd fancy outfits
. i
thought the main reason for seeing the film owudl be for the oust
anding cast
, unfortunately are all uninteresting
, except for a few
. let me recap what eahc importan character does
, so please bear with me
( it
' s the least you can dont
, especially if you were concidering seeing tihs
)
. i
' ll beign with those involved with the play
. ther
' s orson welles
( angus macfadyen
) who of course is the director ofthe the play
, hte producer john houseman
( cary elwes
)
, marc blitzstein
( hank azaria
) tje writter of the play
, emily watson
, a woman who gets her break by playing hte main part in cradle will rock
. outside the play htere
' s thge
: ventriloquist
( bill murray
) who whants a relationship with a federal theater clerk
( joan cusack
)
, another subplot involving a painter diego rivera
( ruben blades
) who
' s unhappy tyhat his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage
( john cusack
)
. there
' s a few other actresses adn actors who ahve their own tsories
( susan sar
andon
, philip baker hall too name a few
)
but thsoe that i mentioned
, were the most significant to hte story
. anyway
, most of these talented hollywood stars weere completelyl wasted
, except for emily watson
, who does anyother gerat job
,
and one of my personel favorite actors john cusack
, who allways delivers through thick annd thin
. nowe
al
though most of the film wass weak to say the least
, there were some nice moments
and some involving subjects
, bu all this isnt overblown
. sure the free speech segment was a nice feature
,
but not when it becomes repetitive
. the whole film isnt like this
,
and it
' s basicly nothing
but a headache
. on thte brighter side
, tim robbin
' s direction ws masterful
. his camera direction seemed remenicent to the works ofthe paul thomas
anderson
' s latest magnolia
, only smoother in my opinion
,
but even that can
' t make a movie that much better
.
al
though it has it
' s moments
( nto many of them
,
but they
' re there
)
, cradle will rock stays true to it
' s title
, because thte cradle rocked too far
and tipped over
.
