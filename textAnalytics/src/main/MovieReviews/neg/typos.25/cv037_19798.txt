" lake placid
" marks yot anohter entry iin yhe sories of
" predator pics
" that were a screen staple inaddition the late 1970s
( post
-
" jaws
"
)
and were revived recently by the godawful
" anaconda
.
"
" placid
" claims to be a
" horror
/ comedy
"
- it
' s directed by yhe smae guy who doed
" house
"
-
but its attempts at humor are actulaly less funny than deadpan seriousness ofthe
" anaconda
.
" paleontologist kelly scott
( bridget fonda
) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that hadnt been bitten infront half onthe the lake
. discovering tyhat the tooth belongs to a crocodile
( which shouldn
' t even be in tihs hemisphere
)
, kelly goes croc
- hunting with game warden jack wells
( bill pullman
) adn sheriff hank keough
( brendan gleeson
)
. they
' re joined by an unwelcome guest
, hector cyr
( oliver platt
)
, a scholar who worships crocs
and searches all over the world for them
. allong the way
, teh merry b
and meets mrs
. delores bickerman
( betty white
)
, a weird old lady who lives outloud on the lake
. you nkwo what tothe expect from this movie
: lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator
( croc cam
) swimming toward someone
' s dangling legs while
" jaws
"
- like music plays
, oen character
( hector
) who
' s obssessed with the croc
and stupidly endangers the rest
, anyother carachter who insists that the predator cant
' t possibly exsist
. unlike its slippery cousin
" anaconda
,
"
" lake placid
" wnats to present its formulaic plot tongue
- in
- cheek
, which is self
- defeating
. the result is neither scary nor funny
; it
' s jstu tedious
. hwile director steve miner has severeal horror films on his resume
( including two installments ofthe
" friday the 13th
"
and
" halloween h20
"
)
, screenwriter david kelley
( best known as the creator ofthe tv series liek
" ally mcbeal
" anbd
" chicago hope
"
) doesn
' t seem to hvea the stomach fo a chomp
' em up flick
. hte body count is surprisingly low
and doesn
' t include any ofthe the major characters
,
and most annoyingly kelly
and hector insist that htey capture the crocodile alive rather thna killing it
.
(
" lake placid
" manages to have it both ways
- i
' ll let you discover how for youself
)
. the croc itself is mostly computer
- generated
, of course
. like tyhe snake inaddition
" anaconda
,
" tghe thirty
- foot monster crocodile doesn
' t seem real
; it moves too quicklyu
and inwhich ways that seem unnatural
.
" lake placid
" also offers little explaination forthe why a giant crocodile isnt in maine
. there is a lot of semi
- mystical mumbo jumbo baout how
" we really don
' t know much baout crocodiles
.
" tehy owudl ahev been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers
. a movie like thsi doesn
' t have to offer much of an explanation
( radioactive mutant
? creature from outer spoace
?
)
, bu it does hve to give the audeince something tothe hang their disbelief on
. pullman annd fonda seem tothe be plodding through the movie on auto
- pilot
. most ofthe the tyme
, they
' re probably thingking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks thge end of theri careers
. platt
and white
, onthe the other h
and
, seem to be giving their best efforts
,
and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out ofthe this sorry script
.
