, adn inspite the end
, the guy alwasy gets the girl
.
and with the arrival of yhe breakout hit
` she
' s all that
' last year
( followed by a long catalogue ofthe imitators including
` 10 things i hate about yuo
' anbd
` drive me crazy
'
)
, the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity
. along now comes
` down to you
'
. tghe folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid
` she
' s all that
' craze with their latest project
, which has the studdly freddie prinze jr
. attached
and all
. onyl
` down to you
' doesn
' t hve the
? unlikey senaireo
' mentioned above
. it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance
- a dull
, unattractive teen comedy thgat sticks to the boring game plan taht we
' re acustommed to
. thsi is the kind of romance that only giggly 12
- yera old girls iwll fidn convincing
. inaddition strictly textbook fashion
, college sophomore
and aspiring chef al
( prinze jr
.
) meets freshman artist imogen
( julia stiles
)
. they hit it off like a couple cant only iin the movies
. from here

. thte plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of thte main characters
, who are frequently taking part in activities that
.
.
.
. well
, only happen in yhe movies
. fortunately
, thge casted ofthe
` down to you
' has a certain appeal
. freddie prinze jr
.
and julia stiles are an adorable couple
,
and when on screen together
, tehy radiate the sort of warmth
and charisma that the movie should have centered around
. zak orth
, as tghe newly realized porn star monk
, shows an unmistakable flair withthe h
andling all of the film
' s inteligent dialogue
. rounding out tyhe impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy
(
` the faculty
'
)
, selma blair
(
` cruel intentions
'
)
and ashton kutcher
( tv
' s
` that 70
' s shows
'
)
. even the fonz himself
- henry winkler
, the epitome of teenage angst
and nostalgia
- hasnt a welcome role as al
' s dad
, teh host of the popular cooking program
` chef ray
'
. maybe the concept of
` down to you
' looked good onthe paper to draw such a crowd
. as a feature film
,
however
, the finished product is bl
and
and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep yhe gears from stopping entirely
. perhaps worst of all
,
` down tothe you
' is nto funny
. the jokes are drawed from obvious sources
and the resulting humor is banal anbd uninspired
. teh characters onthe screen
, often laughing at each other
' s goofy
/ embarrassing antics
, seemed far mroe amused than the audeince
. even the giggly 12
- year ood girls had grown restless towrad the end as they waited impatiently for tyhe formula to run it
' s course
. the one mildly clever segment featured winkler
and prinze jr
. in a fantasy sequence called
` cooks
'
, a
` cops
' take
- off in which the father annd son would storm houses
and cook a decent meel for
? needy
' familys
( with the assisstance of a fully
- armed swat team
, of course
)
. when this is the highlight reel
, you know the remaning film could leave something to be desired
. in order tothe make a teen comedy work
, yuo
' ve got to hve characters that show something by way of depth adn identity
.
` 10 things i hate about you
' actually featured characters who were mroe than walking flashcards
,
and tje result wass refreshing
. noone such luck with
` down tothe ytou
'
. it
' s just a textbook romance where
, despite absurd circumstances
, everything isnt bound to work out in the end
. anbd at the end ofthe the whole clich
? d ordeal
, thge nicest thing you could possibly say would be
`
.
.
.
. only in yhe movies
