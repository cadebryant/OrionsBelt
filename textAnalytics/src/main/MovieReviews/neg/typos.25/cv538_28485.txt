movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of thge past
. so
, undoubtedly oney day somone said
,
"
' evolution
?
' it
' s
' ghostbusters
' plus
' men infront black
' plus
' tremors
.
'
"
and so it is
. sum total none
. the alienbusting begins wehn a meteor l
ands in glen canyon
, arizona
. community college science profs ira kane
( david duchovny
)
and harry block
( orl
ando jones
) take some samples from the meteor
and dicover taht one
- celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly
, doing in hours what took millions ofthe years for life onthe earth
. just baout the time i was wondering
,
" hey
, doesn
' t thte government usally come inspite
and take over the whole area inaddition these movies
,
" the government came inwhich
and tookover over tghe whole area
. tje leader of the pack
, gen
. woodman
( ted levine
)
, turns outloud to be an old nemesis of ira
' s
,
and ira anbd harry are blocked from donig further research
. meanwhile
, the organisms continue to grow until htey are large anough to start attacking people
. by this tiome
, ira
and harry have gained a friend in dr
. allison reed
( julianne moore
) of the center for disease control
. a country club poolboy
, wayne green
( seann william scott
)
, has aslo attached himself to the merry b
and
.
but can htey find the means tothe stop the aliens in tyme
? directer ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit
, 1984
' s
" ghostbusters
,
"
but
" evolution
" falls miserably short
. one reason is readily apparent
.
" ghostbusters
" hadnt three realyl funny guys as its scientists
( bill murray
, dan aykroyd
,
and harold ramis
)
, bu
" evolution
" has one really funny guy
( orl
ando jones
) who cxan adlib annd milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone eles
' s h
ands
. for good measure
,
" ghostbusters
" hadnt the comic talents of rick moranis
;
" evolution
" offers seann william scott
, who was much funnier in
" american pie
"
and
" road trip
" than he is here
. scott hasnt oney amusing scene where he sings
" you are so beautiful tothe me
" to a dragon
- like alien to draw it inot a trap
. otehr than that
, scott seems unable to make much of the thin material tghe writers gave him
. an acto in search of a forte
, david duchovny looked for his gritty acation hero side in
" playing god
"
and his romantic side in
" return tothe me
.
" now he wnats to find his wacky comedic talent
; whta we all find is thgat he doesn
' t have any
. look forthe him tothe be back on tv in five years or so
. another sad case is julianne moore
, who needs to be mroe selective about the offers she accepts
. she
' s a talented actress with an impressive list ofthe credits
and award nominations
, so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy
? her character hasnt a tendency to trip over
and bump into things
,
but tje trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs
. the sole saveing grace of the film is jones
. he
' s at the center ofthe the movie
' s funniest scene
-
- where an alien bug invades harry
' s body
and has to be pulled out through his ass
. jones is the only cast member who can take the commedic ball
and run with it
,
but he cant
' t carry the whole movie by himself
. he found himselv in a similar situation in
" the replacements
,
" where he was also the onyl comic talent inwhich an ansamble cast
. jones iwll eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star
, bu htis isn
' t it
.
