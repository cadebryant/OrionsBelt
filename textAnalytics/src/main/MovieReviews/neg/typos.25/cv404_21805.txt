cxan a horror movie truly be called a horror movei if it hasnt no scares
, suspense
, or even eerie elements
? i think not
,
but that
' s what children ofthe the corn 666
: issac
' s return wants us to believe
. tje sixth installment in the horrible
, worn out serieses isnt by far the worst to date
. unlike the otehr five chapters
, children of the corn 666 isnt a confusing
, brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather thna slasher horror
,
but either way
, none of these movies are the least bit scayr
. yhe film follows hannah
( natalie ramsey
) a teen looking forthe her mother in gatlin
, nebraska
, on the eve of her 21st birthday
. what starts out as a daughter in edsperate search ofthe her long lost mother turns into the story ofthe hannah bieng the frist daughter of the childrens of the corn
, who roam tyhe cornfields looking for adults to murder
. that
' s baout all that
' s underst
andable inaddition tyhe film
, as after we leran this much
, issac
( john franklin
) who led the children ofthe the corn in a previous chapter
, now an older
, stange man
, is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy
.
and this is suposed tothe make sence
. really
. from the start the film is unclear ofthe where its going
, nto developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table
, constantly introducing new characters wihtout personalities or tghe slightest hint of an individuality
, annd sub plots that ahve nothing to dont with what seems tothe the main focus of the film
. the film runs at a short 78 minutes
, bu it seems to be more in teh vincinity of two hours
, as tghe obleek
, slow pacing mkaes childern ofthe the corn 666
: issac
' s return excruciatingly boring
. plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka
and john franklin
' s unbelievably horrible script
, as nothing is acomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion
. everyone
and everthing involved with childern ofthe tghe corn 666
: issac
' s return
, namely writers john franklin
and tim sulka
, along with directer kari skogl
and
, should crawl under a rock
,
and hope noone one sees theri horrible work of trash
. the bottom line
: horrible
, horrible
, horrable
. another attemp tothe revive this worn outloud genre falls flat
.
and wqat
' s with that title
? the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film
. let
' s pray taht this is the finale in noe of the worst current film series
. oen of the worst horror films iin years
.
