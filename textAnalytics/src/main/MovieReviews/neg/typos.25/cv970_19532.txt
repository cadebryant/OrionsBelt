the

- to
- what
- you
- do
- best
" rule states that disney ' s animated features will invariably be sublime
bu whenever they try their hand at live
- acation kids ' enteratinment
, they will fail miserably
. this goes duble for ocasions when tehy try to make a live
- acation adaptions of a populare ctaroon
( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations
? i ' m still trying to foreget
)
. taht rule proves more dependable tahn ever iwth inspector gadget
, an insulting
, despicable
and
, worst ofthe all
, expensive peice of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children ' s film
. it iwll bore anyone over five
and should proove unbearable forthe adults
, even at its relitavely skinny running time of 80 minutes
. it ' s films like thsi that make me want tothe go to my local blockbuster
annd rent something from tyhe days whn brains were more important thna budgets
and wit compensated for lack ofthe fancy effects
. just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor
yot
, his carrer tkaes a nosedive to hell with his
" role
" as john brown
, a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes taht one day he can become a real policemen
and help the people aroud him
. he dreams of heroic deeds
and the subesquent admiration of his long time crush
, dr
. brenda bradford
( joely fisher
)
.
bu after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he hasnt to dream noone longer
. john breaks eveyr bone in his body while trying to sive dr
. brenda ' s father
. dr
. brenda has beeen working on a
" gadget project
,
" which would amke a half
- man half
- machine super
- policeman to fight crime
. feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject
, realizing his dream of becoming a policeman
. now
, when he says
" go go gadget
[ insert name ofthe gizmo here
]
" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks
, bang up bandits
anbd mangle murderers
. in tjhe meantime
, tjhe evil claw
( rupert everett
)
, the man responisble fo the murder of tyhe good doctor ' s father is building a gadget of his own
: a carbon copy ofthe our inspector gadget except evil
and john brown ' s worst nemesis
. claw has plans of world domination
, which leaves it uv to tghe inspector
anbd his gadget mobile
( voice of d
. l
. hughley
) to sive humanity ffrom his wrath
. state of the art effects fly at a mad pace inspite this
$ 90 milion doller movie
annd
yot directer david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere
. had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they woudl have wound up with the same effect
. waht we see onthe the screen is like the raw ingreediants of a meel
: all of the expensive f
/ x amounts to nothing
. part of the charm of the tv serieses was its sly irreverence which hasnt gone down the toilet in yhe condescending movie
. can kids raelly admire a hero so goody
- two
- shoes that he screams
" hey
! you ran a stop sign
!
" while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle
? i think that today ' s children will respond better to somebody dashing
, someone ultra
- kool
. they
( probaly
) receive enought preaching from thier parents
anbd its an insult to thier intellignce to asume that htey watn to go tothe an action movie tothe see a father figure kick butt
. iin addition tothe tjhe more complex complaints above
, there ' s also the simple stuff
: inspector gadget is boring
, formulaic
annd achingly implausible
. there ' s noone feeling that the director raelly cares about his story
: more than any otehr film i ' ve seen htis year
, this oney realy fiels liek it was made onthe an assembly line
. there ' s a popular commercial
( for sprite
,
bu that ' s irrelevant
) runing in movie theaters before features tyhat spoofs the way major studios deal with projects
. it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious
( thank god
) movie called
" death slug
"
. each executive gleefully presents a diffrent merchandise tye
- in
( slug taco
! slug on a stick
!
)
. at the end one of them asks
" what about the movie
?
" another answers
:
" well
, we don ' t hve a scirpt
yet
,
bu we can bang one out by friday
.
" they probably could have replaced
" death slug
" with inspector gadget
. this film contains the sort ofthe logical contradictions
and blatantly obvious adherance to forumla tath could have beeen eleminated had any attension been payed to teh scirpt
. it ' s noone coincidence that most good children ' s entertainment these dyas comes from animation
. animated features take so long tothe maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers
and they put care
and pride into their work
. theese kinds ofthe films are banged out quicker
and a good percentage turn out worthless
, sloppy
and impersonal
. the studios are becomming factories
adn films their assembled products
