" rule states thta disney
' s animated features will invariably be sublime
but whenever htey try thier h
and at live
- action kids
' entertainment
, tehy will fail miserably
. thsi goes double for occasions when they try to make a live
- action adaptions of a populer cartoon
( remember the 1996 verzion of 101 dalmations
? i
' m still trying to foreget
)
. that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget
, an insulting
, dispicable
and
, worst of all
, expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable childern
' s film
. it iwll bore anyone over five
and should proove unbearable fo adults
, even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 mintues
. it
' s films like this that make me want tothe go to my local blockbuster
and rent something from tghe days when brains were omre important than budgets
and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects
. jsut as matthew broderick began to convince me thgat there is hope forthe him as an actor
yet
, his career takes a nosedive to hell with his
" role
" as john brown
, a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that oney day he can become a real policemen
and help the peopel around him
. he dreams of heroic deeds
and tje subesquent admiration of his long time crush
, dr
. brenda bradford
( joely fisher
)
.
but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has tothe dream no longer
. john breaks every bone in his body hwile trying tothe save dr
. brenda
' s father
. dr
. brenda hasnt been working on a
" gadget project
,
" which would amke a half
- man half
- machine super
- policeman to fight crime
. feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him thte subject
, realizing his dream of becomeing a policeman
. nowe
, when he says
" go go gadget
[ insert name of gizmo here
]
" he can uise all kinds ofthe nifty gadgets to capture crooks
, beng up b
andits
and mangle murderers
. inthe tghe meantime
, tyhe evil claw
( rupert everett
)
, the man responsible forthe the murder of the good doctor
' s father isnt buidling a gadget ofthe his own
: a carbon copy ofthe our inspector gadget except evil
and john brown
' s worst nemesis
. claw hasnt plans of world domination
, which leaves it up to the inspector
and his gadget mobile
( voice of d
. l
. hughley
) to save humanity from his wrath
. state of teh art effects fli at a mad pace inwhich this
$ 90 million doller movie adn yot directer david kelogg never sets up a convincing athmosphere
. hadnt they replaced all the fancy gizmos wih dollar bills tehy would ahve wound uv with the same effect
. what we see on the screen isnt like the raw ingreediants of a meal
: all ofthe yhe expensive f
/ x amounts to nothing
. part ofthe the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in tyhe condescending movie
. can kids really admire a hero so goody
- two
- shoes thta he screams
" hey
! you ran a stpo sign
!
" hwile hanging off the back bumper of a quicklyu moving vehicle
? i think that today
' s children will respond better tothe somebody dashing
, someone ultra
- cool
. they
( probablly
) receive enought preaching fomr their parents anbd its an insult to their inetlligence tothe assume that they want to go to an action movie tothe see a father figure kick
butt
. inwhich addition to the more complex complaints above
, ther
' s also the simple stuff
: inspector gadget is boring
, formulaic anbd achingly implausible
. ther
' s no feeling thta thge director really cares baout his story
: more than any other film i
' ve seen this yera
, this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line
. ther
' s a popular commercial
( for sprite
,
but that
' s irrelevant
) runnung in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects
. it consists of studio suits discusting a fictious
( thank god
) movie called
" death slug
"
. eahc executive gleefully presents a different mech
andise tie
- in
( slug taco
! slug onthe a stick
!
)
. at thge end oen ofthe them asks
" what about tghe movei
?
" another answers
:
" well
, we don
' t hvae a scirpt
yet
,
but we can bang one outloud by friday
.
" they propably could have replaced
" death slug
" wtih inspector gadget
. this film countains the sort ofthe logical contradictions
and blatantly obvious adherence tothe formula taht could ahve been eleminated had any attention been payed tothe the script
. it
' s no coincidence that most ogod childrens
' s entertainment theese days comes from animation
. animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of loev forthe hte filmmakers
and they put care
and pride into their owrk
. these kinds ofthe films are banged outloud quicker
and a good percentage turn out worthless
, sloppy
and impersonal
. the studios are becomeing factories
and films their assembled products
