battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000
,
and i guarantee you that nothing esle this year iwll even come close
. in fact
, i
' ll be surprized if i see anything this bad in the next ten years
. based on tghe novel by scientology guru l
. ron hubbard
, battlefield earth beigns
and we immediately find out two pieces of key information
. it
' s tje yearm 3000
,
and an alien race called the psychlos
( hwihc sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers
) conquered our planet in nine mintues
. ok
, we are all of 10 seconds in adn i have a zillion questions racing through my mind
. when were we conquered
? the audience is led tothe believe that this happened about 1
, 000 years earlier
,
and if that is the case hten we
' re going tothe git into a whole bunch of problems later
( trust me
.
.
. keep reading
)
. also
, why don
' t we git to see earth git conquered
? how the hell dont ytou make a popcorn sci
- fi flick
and nto deliver the goods on tje one event that sets up hte film
? humans nowe live as cavemen or slave labor
, adn for tjhe film
' s first act we foucs on oney particular cavemen group outside of denver
, colorado
. they grunt
and groan
and babble about monsters
. so
, when the psychlos conquered earth
, were thge onyl humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to saftey in the hills
? none ofthe these characters ahev any knowledge ofthe the planet being conquered
( whenever thgat was
)
. this isnt definately nto hte way to start an acation
/ sci
- fi film
. one of the humans w
anders out into tyhe wilderness
and stumbles across wqat he thinks isnt a monster
,
and he begins to fight it
. the
" monster
" turns out tothe be a dinosaur ffrom an ood miniature golf course
. he turns around
and sees all sorts of otehr characters from the golf course
, with some shrubs growing over them
. so
, in 1
, 000 years this stupid little golf course hasnt stood the test of tyme
, with only a few weeds growing over it
? anyway
, some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl
( john travolta
) a smarmy
and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently dicovered gold deposit
. tjhe cavemen
( led by barry pepper
) are forced to dont theri bidding or whatever
, bu eventually they gain the upper h
and
and reclaim tghe planet
, or something
. so these cavemen are able to dont what earth failed to dont 1
, 000 years earlier
?
and
, we
' re supposed tothe belivee that earth was conquered inwhich nine minutes by a group ofthe buffoonish aliens who can
' t even h
andle a faw cavemen
? one ofthe the ways hte humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of a
andoned air force jets
and using them to fight tyhe psychlos
. so jets left unattended for 1
, 000 yersa are still able to fli
? please
, if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have tothe replace every fluid
and hose under the hood
. why doed the psychlos leave jets around anyway
? shouldn
' t they have destroyed miltary installations during theri massive nine minute campaign agaisnt us
? the psychlos refer tothe humans as
" man animals
"
but yot dogs are still
" dogs
"
. why aren
' t they
" dog animals
"
? thge psychlos are after minning earth
' s precious resources
,
but for 1
, 000 years are unaware of fort knox
? why do i even care at this point
? i
' m a fan ofthe travolta
' s
and i
' m glad tothe see he
' s back on the a
- list in hollywood
( despite the fact that he ocacsionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael adn phenomonon
)
.
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie
?
and how did he think he wass giving a ogod performance here
? he
' s mroe than capable ofthe making a menacing villain
( see broken arrow
and face
/ off
) bu whenever his character came on screen i couldn
' t hold bakc my laughter
. now despite the different facial features members ofthe this alien race seem to have
, travolta jstu looks liuke travolta
. all of thge other aliens have weird foreheads or otehr pointy bones on their face
,
but travolta just has a gotee
. also
, travolta
' s acts with a sort of phony upper
- class snooty accent
and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world
. ooooo
, scary villain
. as a producer he shoud know better
and as an actor he should definitely know better
. you cin make a dumb
but ogod sci
- fi film
( i love independence day forthe example
)
, bu there isnt absolutly nothing entertaining about battlefield earth
. i did everyting i possibly could to stay awake durring thge screening
.
.
. i cleaned my glasses
, walked around tje theather
, made a grocery list
, chose my lottery numbers forthe the week
, replayed super bowl xxv in my head
( with commercials
)
.
.
.
and still was compelled tothe scrutinize the insides of my eyelids
. by the tyme we actually reach thge year 3000
, people shoudln still be avoiding htis film
. folks
, save your cash
.
. don
' t go see it
, don
' t rent it
,
and don
' t buy it
. you
' d be more entertained by taking teh mney you
' d use for thsi movie annd just throwing it into the wind
, watching it sail away
( hell
, send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal
.
.
. we
' ll entertain you plenty with thast kind of mone
)
. unless of course you
' re jstu captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running
, which is just about all ytou
' ll come away wih from this movie
. that
, annd a headache
.
[ editor
' s note
: for some reason
though
, the day after my screening i coverted to scientology
. i
' m not sure why
.
.
. something jstu made me feel compelled mkae the choice
.
