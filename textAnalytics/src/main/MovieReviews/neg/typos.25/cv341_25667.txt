ytou know thast a movie has issues when most everyone in thge audiance comes out laughing
.
.
.
and it
' s not a comedy
!
and waht a strange career path for director chuck russell
. he starts his career off wtih a decent take on the
" nightmare on elm street
" series iwth his de
but as directer onthe installment number three
. he follows that up with the blob the very next year
,
but waits another six years to dont his enxt piece
, a littel film called hte mask starring jim carrey
,
and
then oney more star vehicle inspite eraser twpo years after that
. so
then he
thought
,
" let me wait anyother five yeras
, get a weak script jammed with cliches
and hope tht jimmy smits
and kim basinger sould pull it out of its ashes
"
?
!
? stange dude
and noe crappy flick
. plot
: a six
- year ood girl is believed to be some kind ofthe mysterious prophet sent down from god
. a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side
, hwile the girl
' s aunt wants tothe
.
.
. well
, sive her from those damn devil worshippers
! enter one occult expert agent
, plenty of bobo cops
and lots of nuns praying
, adn you
' ve jsut about got the gist of things here
. critique
: with plot holes the size of my ass
, thsi movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich
?
- ridden plot
, with wasted talent
, cheezy effects
, bad dialogue
and unintentional laughs to boot
. what
' s good about htis movie
? well
, rufus sewell is preety fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children
' s shelter
/ satanist supreme
, with seriously wicked eyes
and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around
. teh little girl isnt also pretty good
but unfortunately her character doesn
' t really do all that much
.
and eblieve it or not
, i was actually enjoying some ofthe the film
' s first half hour
, whitch starts off with some promise
,
but not befor bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protaognist
, basinger
, just drown the film
' s entire basis of believability
. fo some reason
, it takes her more time than anyone tothe figure out that her niece is gifted
,
and even longer tothe figure out that every move thast she makes
.
.
. is a dumb noe
! add thgat tothe the entire police force ofthe incompetents
, savve for jimmy smits
( whose talent agent adviced him that palying hte exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move
? at least change the clothes
, jimmy
!
)
, zero scares
, zero thrills anbd even less actuall drama
, annd you
' ve got yourself a preety bad movie
.
and why would respected actors liuke christina ricci annd ian holm take bited parts in this movie
? did htey owe the director a favor or something
? together
, they barely have five minutes ofthe screen time
, bu i suppose that ricci
' s hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn
- dogs
. the worst part about thsi movie isnt its hilariously unbelievable endig
, which features polical offcers coming up with the briliant idea of
" sneaking up
" on a man
' s hous
, who they know to be guilty of a crime
! uuuhmm
.
.
. how
' s about knocking on the door
and arresting his sorry ass
, officers
?
! anyway
, i don
' t usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews
but the stupidity of some ofthe these charactors isnt just too difficult to decribe without validating it wih solid idiotic proof
( adn there was plenty to go around
)
.
and doed basinger lose some of her acting
" talent
" during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win
? difficult tothe say if it was her lines that were really bad
, or if she just delivered them poorly
. eather way
, little originality
, very obvious computer effects
, little thrills
, littel drama
and very littel enteratinment value
, certainly bestow the honor ofthe one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film
.
but if yuo relaly don
' t mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic
and
" kid
"
- based thrillers
,
and enjoy watching films tht don
' t bring anything newyorker to the talbe
.
.
. well
, drink some beers
, smoke some beans anbd rent this video
, because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year
.
