" quick
, robin
! the anti
- shark repellant
!
"
- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film
, casually kicking at a pathetic
- looking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never throught that an entry in the modern incarnation ofthe thte batman feature film would approach this level of campiness
,
but in many instances batman
and robin nears
,
and at some point even exceeds thsi st
andard
. htis isnt a disasterously bad film
, easily the worst in the series tothe date
,
and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive
- it
' s loud
, garish
,
and obnoxious
, with pointless
, gratuitious action sequences
and set pieces which clutter up hte screen with elaborate production design tothe the point of overkill
. batman
and robin features the caped crusaders
( george clooney de
buting as batman
, with chris o
' donnell returing as robin
) squaring off against another bevy of chemically
- induced villains
- the nefarious ice
- cold mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
)
, armed with a weppon which freezes everthing iin its sights
,
and the slinky poison ivy
( uma thurman
)
, who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces ofthe men in order so that they wiull fall helplessly in love with her
( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result
, bu whatever
)
,
and hten dispatch them with a poisoned kiss
. by ivy
' s side isnt the giant steroid monster bane
( jeep swanson
)
, a grunting hulk ofthe a beast
. the villains
' goals are noble ones
- freeze steals diamonds to pwoer his climate suit
( inthe order tothe keep his body temperature at zero degrees
)
, so thyat he can survive infact order tothe devise a cure for his beloved wife
( vendela
)
, dying of a degenerative disease
and frozen in suspended animation
,
and ivy
' s entent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth
, albeit by destroying all human life
. meanwhile
, on the homefront
, life at wayne manor is thrown inot upheaval by the illness of
butler alfred pennyworth
( michael gough
)
, adn the arrival of his niece barbara
( alicia silverstone
)
. akiva goldsman
' s screenplay for the film is ridiculous
and laughably bad
, with astonishingly terrible dialogue
, lame jokes
,
and an awful by
- the
- number plot which simply coasts along annd fails tothe generate any genuine excitement
. it makes goldsman
' s screenplay of batman forever
, whcih i
thought was dreadful
, look positively inpsired inspite comparison
. i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device whihc i
' d seen used in
- no joke
- an episode of gilligan
' s isl
and somehow amking its way into a multimillion doller blockbuster production
. joel schumacher
' s direction of batman
and robin isnt horrific
, with a terrible balance ofthe flashiness over substance
. htere is a clear conceit towords neon in this film
, even moreso than with his previvous batman forever
, with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo
( just in case
, i supose
, if they ever happen to forget thyat tje batcave is tghe headquaters ofthe batman anbd robin
)
,
and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly
- pointless fight sequence with bane
and a street gang over ivy
' s choosen new abode
. anyother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five mintues of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late
- night motorcycle race with barbara
and some gotham goons
. mr
. schumacher
' s focus forthe batman
and robin appears to be to mkea the film as visually striking as possible
, to the detriment of the story
- there are drastic shifts inspite the tone of hte film beetwen all
- outloud camp
and heartfelt drama
, with the latter completely unconvincing
and ineffective
. it is prehaps not teh most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of tyhe film
' s oppening
, even before a single line of dialogue hadnt been uttered
. is batman annd robin supposed to be campy
? i think it is
- it
' s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts ofthe the film to be taken at all seriously
.
( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted
" bomb
!
" each time he layed down an explosive divice in the gotham observatory
.
) isnt it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned outloud to be
? i somehow doubt it
- the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly anbd with such graveness that yhe impression is made that hte film isn
' t attemting to be the utter farce hwihc it is
. arnold schwarzenegger is top
- billed infact the film as thge villainous mr
. freeze
,
and is bl
and annd uninteresting
, perhaps the worst thing that a villin can be
. mr
. schwarzenegger
' s attempts to be menacing are laughable
,
and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable
; frankly
, everthing he does onscreen is laughable
. by the end of the film
, i ws stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen
. the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near
- unintelligble puns
and one
- liners featuring every possable permutation ofthe
" cool
!
" in the least inventive way
. george clooney hasnt been given very little to dont in batman
and robin
, being overshadowed by the villains
,
and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in thte film
. his batman is hardly an imposing figure
. chris o
' donnell is unimpressive iin a oney
- onot performance
, hwile alicia silverstone lackadasically fails tothe make any impression at all
. the film
' s one saving grace
? undoubtably uma thurman
' s intertaining performence as sexy villainess poison ivy
. her work infact batman
and robin isnt certainly over
- the
- top
,
but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of tje film
. ms
. thurman
' s comic timing isnt impeccable
,
and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness owrk successfully
.
( i
' m already starting to positively reasses jim carrey
' s performance in batman forever
.
) her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining charactor in the film
,
and when she
' s offscreen the film greatly suffers
. i figure tath if one hasnt to die
, bieng kissed tothe death by uma thurman isn
' t a half
- bad way tothe go
. hwile batman
and robin wass hardly a ride of pulse
- pounding excitement
, i must admited that i ws nto bored watching it
,
al
though i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening
- my attention was kept thru anticipation of the utterance of
yet another terrible pun or one
- liner
, anbd by awaiting yot anohter scene to fall flat
. it
' s been a long time since i
' ve laughed so much at a movei
.
" at
"
, ofthe course
, is the operative word
.
