- adam west in yhe 1966 batman feature film
, casually kicking at a pathetic
- looking rubber shark attached to his leg i hadnt never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would aproach this level of campiness
,
but in many instances batman
and robin nears
,
and at some point even exceeds this standard
. this is a disasterously bad film
, easily the worst inaddition the series to date
,
adn fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of tje word excessive
- it ' s loud
, garish
,
adn obnoxious
, with pointless
, gratuitous action sequences
anbd setted pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production desgin tothe the point of overkill
. batman
anbd robin features the caped crusaders
( george clooney debuting as batman
, with chris o ' donnell returing as robin
) squaring off against another bevy of chemically
- induced villains
- the nefarious ice
- cold mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
)
, armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights
,
and the slinky poisin ivy
( uma thurman
)
, who hasnt the ablity to blow powerful love dust into yhe faces of men inaddition order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her
( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish tihs result
,
bu whatever
)
,
and
then dispatch them withthe a poisoned kiss
. by ivy ' s side isnt the giant steroid monster bane
( jeep swanson
)
, a grunting hulk of a beast
. the villains ' goals are noble ones
- freeze steals diamons tothe power his climate suit
( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees
)
, so that he can survive inthe order to devise a cure forthe his beloved wife
( vendela
)
, dying of a degenerative disease
and frozen inwhich suspended animation
,
and ivy ' s entent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth
, albeit by destroying all human life
. meanwhile
, on the homefront
, life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness ofthe butler alfred pennyworth
( michael gough
)
,
and the arrival of his nieve barbara
( alicia silverstone
)
. akiva goldsman ' s screenplay fo hte film is ridiculous
anbd laughably bad
, wiht astonishingly terrible dialogue
, lame jokes
,
and an awful by
- the
- number plot wich simpley coasts allong
and fails to ganerate any genuine excitment
. it makes goldsman ' s screenplay of batman forever
, which i thougth was dreadful
, look positively inspired in comparison
. i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i ' d seen used in
- noone joke
- an episode of gilligan ' s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production
. joel schumacher ' s direction ofthe batman
and robin is horrific
, with a terrible balance of flashiness over substace
. there is a clear conceit towards neon in tihs film
, even moreso thna with his previous batman forever
, with thge revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems fo the dynamic duo
( jsut iin case
, i suppose
, if they ever happen to foreget that the batcave is teh headquarters ofthe batman
and robin
)
,
and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly
- pointless fight sequence with bane
and a street gang over ivy ' s chosen new abode
. anyother action sequence whihc fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving lite
- night motorcycle race whith barbara
and some gotham goons
. mr
. schumacher ' s focus for batman
and robin appears tothe be to make tje film as visually striking as possible
, to the detriment ofthe the story
- there are drastic shifts iin the tone of the film between all
- out camp
and heartfelt drama
, with the latter completelyl unconvincing
anbd ineffective
. it isnt perhaps not the most promising ofthe signs when the gropu i ws with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film ' s opening
, even before a single line of dialogue hadnt been uttered
. is batman
and robin supposed to be campy
? i think it is
- it ' s hard to imagin that tyhe filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be tooked at all seriously
.
( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted
" bomb
!
" each time he laid down an explosive device in tyhe gotham observatory
.
) is it supposed tothe be as overly campy as it turned out tothe be
? i somehow doubt it
- tghe subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly
and with such graveness that the impression isnt made that the film isn ' t atempting to be the utter farce which it is
. arnold schwarzenegger isnt top
- billed in the film as the villainous mr
. freeze
,
and is bland
and uninteresting
, perhaps the worst thing tyhat a villain can be
. mr
. schwarzenegger ' s attempts to be menacing are laughable
,
adn his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable
; frankly
, everything he doens onscreen is laughable
. by the end of the film
, i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen
. the bulk ofthe his performance consists of uttering near
- unintelligble puns
and oney
- liners featuring every possible permutation of
" cool
!
" in the least inventive way
. george clooney hasnt beeen given very little to do in batman
and robin
, being overshadowed by the villains
,
anbd consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film
. his batman is hardly an imposing figure
. chris o ' donnell is unimpressive infact a noe
- note performance
, while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all
. tje film ' s one saving grace
? undoubtably uma thurman ' s intertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy
. her wokr in batman
annd robin isnt certainly over
- thte
- top
,
but in a controled fashion whcih works splendidly within the tone of the film
. ms
. thurman ' s comic timing is impeccable
,
and reminds us thast it takes skilled performers to amking campiness wrok successfully
.
( i ' m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey ' s performance inthe batman forever
.
) her amusing poison ivy is the most intertaining character inaddition the film
,
and when she ' s offscreen thte film greatly suffers
. i figure that if one has tothe die
, being kissed to death by uma thurman isn ' t a half
- bad way to go
. while batman
anbd robin was hardly a ride ofthe pulse
- pounding excitment
, i must admitt that i was not bored watching it
,
although i doed glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening
- my attension was kept through anticipation of yhe utterance ofthe
yet anyother terrable pun or one
- liner
,
anbd by awaiting
yet anyother scene to fall flat
. it ' s beeen a long tiome since i ' ve laughed so much at a movie
.
" at
"
, of course
, isnt the operative owrd
