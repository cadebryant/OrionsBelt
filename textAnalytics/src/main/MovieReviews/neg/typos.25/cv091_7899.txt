capsule
: the weakest
and least engaging of the alien movies
, dragged down by an uninvolving story
and no real tension
. alien 3
( tje
" 3
" should be in superscript
) is a sad annd wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen
. it continues the story ofthe ripley
, thge space
- trucker
- turned
- impromptu
- survivalist
, bu seems remarkably uninterested in her
. in fatc
, the movie seems lucky to be interested inwhich anything at all
, it
' s so elegaic adn limp
. a littel of this would ahve been nice for atmosphere
,
but the movie telegraphs its own tradgedy ffrom the begginning
. at tyhe end ofthe the last film
( aliens
)
, ripley
and two survivors were onthe their way home
. unfortunately
, an aline pod had beeen deposited in their ship
,
and wound up triggering off thier ejection in an excape pod
. yhe pod crashes on firorina 161
, a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent
. ripley lives through the crash
; the others do nto
. the prison is a grim place
, even as prisons go
-
- it
' s beeen built around thge remnants of an ab
andoned steelworks
, which provides no end of techno
- gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against
. lice are endemic
, annd so ripley
' s head isnt shaved
( another surreal touch
)
. at first it looks like she jsut has to hold outloud as an unwelcome guest until a comany rescue ship can arrive
,
but it doesn
' t stay that way
. oen of tjhe other eggs onthe board hte wrecked escape pod hatches
,
and soon a newly
- gestated alien is running amuck
. worse
, it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated
. wqat
' s weidr isnt how littel tension this generates
, exept near the end
, whn tyhe pressure is being troweled on through eveyr cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable
: loud music
, shaky camerawork
, etc
. sigourney weaver hasnt become confortable with the role
,
and she does well with it
,
but this tyme the role hasnt been underwritten
and left slack
. the supporting actors are also nto given a lot to dont
: yhe doctor
( charles dance
)
and another
, rather religous inmate
( charles s
. dutton
, very good
)
, hiave presence
,
but htey
' re not asked to do anything with it
. in light of yhe impending sequal
, which apparently plays fast
and loose withthe the ending of tihs movie
, i will not talk about the ending
-
- except tothe say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movei
. it
' s strange tyhat some of the desperat
and improvisational thingking thta they found tothe wind up this story couldn
' t have driven the rest of it
.
