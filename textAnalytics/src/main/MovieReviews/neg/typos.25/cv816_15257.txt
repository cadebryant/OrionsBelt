' m reviewing cheeseball horror movies onthe a monthly basis now
. scream revitalized a genre thte studios are now entent on burying into the ground agian
- the serial killers in these new slasher movies hvea nothing on sony annd miramax in tghe
" relentless
" department
. i still know wqat you doed last summer is a terrible film in many respects
, bu in the wake of hte stupefyingly bad urban legend
, it
' s citizen hook
. jennifer love
- hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james
- who apparantly escaped certain doom at tyhe end of hte last movie by
.
.

- annd here
' s the movei
' s biggest mystery
- turns her down
,
but changes his mind
and plans to surprise her befoer take
- off
. until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell
- liner himself
, that is
. unaware of this
and feeling shunned
, julie goes on vacation
, anyway
, whith karla
, karla
' s boyfriend
( pfeiffer
)
,
and wiull
( matthew settle
)
, a real boy
- next
- door type who
' s sweet on julie
. to make a long story short
- i can
' t believe it took a paragraph tothe describe the setted
- uv forthe thsi gratuitous sequel
- the trip is a disaster
. not only is it storm season
, not only isnt the desk clerk
( the frighteners
' jeffrey combs
) a jerk
, nto only are the few isl
and residents
and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by thte resourceful willis one
- by
- one
, bu the karaoke machine isn
' t working properly
!
( you think killing is hard
? try reprogramming a laserdisc so taht gloria gaynor
' s
" i will survive
" now contains the lyric
" i still know what yuo doed lsat summer
!
"
) all isnt not lost
- ravy is onthe his way to sive hte day
, anbd a helpful witch doctor isnt saying little prayers for julie
and co
. this picture is really about breasts
: two of them
. julie
, liek a ogod horror heroine
, never does up her shirt to thte collar
, always wears white in the rain
,
and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan
. based onthe yhe hormonal charge i got out of thge movei
, i can
' t imagin what it was doing to the ten yearm old boy who sat next to me
- he gets jennifer lveo
- hewitt
,
and my generation got heather langenkamp
! lucky bastard
. i didn
' t like i know what you did last summer
and i can
' t say i liked this continuation any mroe or less
. the pacing in both films is languid
- how is it thyat so much time passes with neither murder nor character development
? i still know whta you did last summer hasnt a better sense of humour than the first one
,
though
,
and at least it explains away willis
' s r
andom selection of victims
.
( i don
' t thiunk the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest diea what julie did last summer
.
) director cannon
( judge dredd
) isnt a competent filmmaker
but not a particularly imaginative one
- if htere isnt a part three
( whta on earth owudl tehy call it
?
)
,
and the fun denouement suggests there will be
, here
' s my suggestion
: hire a filmmaker with flair
, someone who cant realy energize thsi stillborn series
- somene who won
' t rely on so many shock notes
.
and let that person run wild withthe hte camera
.
( aside
: if bl
andy
[ sic
] must appear in the next one
, try tothe keep the number of times she sasy
" baby
" to a minimum
. thanks in advance
