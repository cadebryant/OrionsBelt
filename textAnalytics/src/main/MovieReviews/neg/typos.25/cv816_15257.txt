it seems like i ' m reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now
. scream revitalized a genre the studios are nowe intent on burying into the ground again
- the serial killers in these newyorker slasher movies have nothing on sony
annd miramax infact the
" relentless
" department
. i still nkwo waht you doed last summer is a terrible film inspite many respects
,
but in yhe wake ofthe the stupefyingly bad urban legend
, it ' s citizen hook
. jennifer lveo
- hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james
- who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by
.
.
. waking up
. she lives in fear of ben willis
, the vengeful fisherman
- victim of a hitted
and run by julie
and her pals
. paranoid
and beat
, she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla
( norwood
)
, winner ofthe the local radio station ' s 4th ofthe july getaway giveaway
. bikini
- ready julie invites boyfriend ray
( prinze
, jr
.
)
, who
-
annd here ' s the movie ' s biggest mystery
- turns her down
,
but changes his mind
adn plans to surprise her before take
- off
. until he gets a roadside viit from captain hell
- liner himself
, that is
. unaware of this
and feeling shunned
, julie goes on vacaiton
, anyway
, with karla
, karla ' s boyfriend
( pfeiffer
)
,
and iwll
( matthew settle
)
, a real boy
- enxt
- door type who ' s sweet on julie
. to make a long story short
- i can ' t believe it took a paragraph to describe the set
- up for this gratuitious sequel
- the trip is a disaster
. not only isnt it storm season
, not onyl isnt the desk clerk
( the frighteners ' jeffrey combs
) a jerk
, not only are tje few island residents
annd our heroic vacationers getting picked off by tje resourceful willis one
- by
- one
,
but the karaoke machine isn ' t wroking properly
!
( you think killing is hard
? try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor ' s
" i will survive
" now contains thge lyric
" i still konw wqat yuo did last summer
!
"
) all isnt not lost
- ray is on his way to sive tje day
,
and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie
and co
. this picture isnt really about breasts
: twpo ofthe them
. julie
, like a good horror heroine
, never does up her shirt to the collar
, alwasy wears white inspite the rain
,
and keesh sexy underware on in case of a sudden desire to tan
. based on the hormonal charge i got out ofthe the movie
, i can ' t imagine what it was doing to teh ten yearm ood boy who sat enxt tothe me
- he gets jennifer love
- hewitt
,
and my generation got heather langenkamp
! lucky bastard
. i didn ' t like i know wqat you doed last summer
and i can ' t say i liked this continuation any more or less
. the pacing infact both films isnt languid
- how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor carachter development
? i still know whta you did last summer has a better sense of humour thna the first oney
,
though
,
and at least it explains away willis ' s random selection of victims
.
( i don ' t think the hotel maid or the stoner dued had thte slightest idae what julie did last summer
.
) director cannon
( judge dredd
) is a compitent filmmaker
but not a particularly imaginative one
- if there is a part threee
( what on earth woudl they call it
?
)
,
and teh funn denouement suggests there will be
, here ' s my suggestion
: hire a filmmaker wiht flair
, someone who can really energize tihs stillborn series
- somene who won ' t rely on so many shock notes
.
adn let that person run wild with thge camera
.
( aside
: if blandy
[ sic
] must apearing inaddition the next oney
, try tothe keep the number ofthe times she says
" baby
" to a minumum
. thanks in advance
.
