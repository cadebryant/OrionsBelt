" twilight
" would seem vyer promising
.
however
, the script isnt tired
and predictable
. it would serve well as a tv

. the appeal of the project for its stars
and its director
, robert benton
, is nostalgia
.
" twilight
" whants very much to be a 1940
' s film noir witht alan ladd or dick powell
. all of the st
andard tropes are here
: a hard
- boiled p
. i
. among tyhe rich
and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets
, a femme fatale who tempts
and confounds tjhe hero
, shadowy figures shooting ffrom doorways
, dead bodies confronting thge hero at every turn
, cops dogging his path
and interfereing with his investigation
. the script offers little originality
,
and co
- authors benton
and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich
? in 1998
. elmer bernstein
' s scroe is hauntingly melodic
and could have been drawn note
- forthe
- note from a vintage noir
. the lead actors try hard
- none of the threee has eveyr made less thna a full effort
, even when burdened whith a bad script
. tehy try to invest every line anbd gesture with meaning
,
and they create a convincing sense of the relationships beween the main charachters
. harry is fond ofthe jack
but is in lvoe witht catherine
. jack is dying of cancer
and is jelous of harry
' s love for catherine
. catherine teases harry
and enjoys his attention
,
but her rela feelings are hidden beneath a carefully
- maintained veneer
.
