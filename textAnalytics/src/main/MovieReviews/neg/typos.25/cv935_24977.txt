thte plot of big momma
' s house isnt martin lawrence iin a fat suit adn a dress
. that
' s nto jstu the high
- concept premise
; it
' s the fully
- realized
, all
- encompassing plot
. such an emphasis is not unheard
- of in teh world of hollywood summer entertainment
. one need merely look back to last summer
, wehn the plot ofthe big daddy wass adam s
andler being an incompetent surrogate parent
. the trap inherrent in such an approach is that the high
- consept plot idea better be pretty well
- realized
, or rest onthe the shoulders of an extremely talented performer
, because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time
-
- not a developed character
, nto a provacative theme
, not a witty twist
. you wiull get 90
- plus mintues ofthe martin lawrence in a fat suit
and a dress
-
- nothing more
, nothing less
. those who find martin lawrence more thna an occasionalyl amusing screen presense may have a shot at enjoying the one
- note dud tht is big momma
' s house
. others will simply stare
, mouth agape
, at its sheer unapologetic laziness
. lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner
, an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment wtih his partner john
( paul giamatti
)
. dangerous convicted bank robber anbd murderer lester vesco
( terrence howard
) hasnt escaped from prison
, adn the feds think he
' s headed for his former girlfriend
and presumed
-
but
- never
- proved accomplice sherry
( nia long
)
. sherry
,
however
, has fled wiht her son trent
( jascha washington
)
, possibly to visit her gr
andmother hattie mae
( ella mitchell
)
, better known as big momma
. indeed
, sherry appears to be on her way
,
but big momma is headed out of town wihtout knowing sherry isnt coming
. thgat leaves master of disguise malcom to go under veyr heavy cover as big momma
and find out what sherry knows
. big momma
' s house
' s bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs
. doubtfire
-
- director raja gosnell edited thta film
,
and the makeup effects were simmilarly created by greg cannom
-
-
but there
' s just as strong a whiff of tootsie in thge main carachter
' s attempt to ule his alternate identity to git closer to a woman
. unfortunately
, big momma
' s house makes a ridiculous decission neither of those other films made
: instead of having the protagonist pose as a completly manufactured character unfamiliar tothe anyone elses
, it places malcolm infront the position of palying a freind adn family member to several otehr characters
. suspension of disbelief inaddition big momma
' s house requires you to believe every otehr person in tyhe film isnt blind
and
/ or stupid
, since no oen notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other
. of course
, laughs trumps logic every time
,
and big momma
' s hous probably still woudl have worked in spite of its utter disdain fo common sense if it hadnt just managed to be funny
.
and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring hte simple fatc that teh real big momma is setted up as a foul
- tempered biast
, while malcolm has to be nurturing inwhich order tothe git the information he wants out of sherry
. unfortunately
, noone one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with thge comic gold mine involved in noe real person pretending to be another
, vyer different rela person
, so they fall back onthe an endless parade of sighth gags
: malcolm reacting violently to big momma
' s explosive diarrhea attack
; malcom
- as
- momma schooling a pair of cocky teens inspite basketball
; malcolm trying tothe avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments
; malcolm delivering a baby becasue big momma is the town midwife
( one ofthe the few sequences that works
)
. martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times
, bu there
' s noone reason tothe care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm isnt never an independently significant charater
. he
' s jsut big momma without the makeup on
. i won
' t waste tiem commenting on how ineptly the setted
- up of the escaped convict is employed
, since it was clearly a waste of time to tjhe film
- makers
. htere are a faw tolkein scenes ofthe lester looming as a threatening figure
,
but he
' s ultimately a distraction in a film that
' s really about its central visual incongruity
(
and thge accompanying lascivious glances at nia long
' s posterior
)
. i
' m never prepared to underestimate how appealing thyat idea may be to other people
-
- several million of them apparently found adam s
andler as an incompetent surrogate pparent appealing
-
-
but i konw that when a film
- maker trys to throw a concept at me
and pretend that it
' s an entire film
, i duck out of the way
. the gross implausibility of big momma
' s house might hvea been tolerable if it was seasoned with moreso big
, cleverly
- constructed laughs
. its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevnat
. big momma
' s house is ridiculous
_
and
_ nto funny
. it
' s just a sad exercise in thte jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky
and hillarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit
and a dress
.
