the original
_ babe
_ wass my favorite movie ofthe 1995
, a sleeper hit that trancended its target audeince
. being a surprise commercial adn critical succes
, it had no marketting tie
- ins
, which limited its final take
. thus
, babe 2 arrives
, with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1
. plush dolls
, vending machines hawking t
- shirts
,
and macy
' s thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money
- grubbing
. too late
. this is a sad review to wriet
, because babe 2 not only does
_ not
_ live uv to the original
,
but it doesn
' t even come tothe a fraction of it
. i shouldn
' t expect taht sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors
' magic
,
but this film tries too hard
,
and loses its charm
. consider a driver applying thte accelerator with great intensity
, unaware thyat his car is in nuetral
. imagine with me
, if you will
,
_ scream
_
' s jamie kennedy
, explaining the
" rules
" for sequels liek babe 2
.
( 1
) there must be
_ more
_ talking animals
.
( 2
) there must be
_ omre
_ slapstick comedy
.
( 3
) there must be
_ more
_ songs for those mice to sing
: that
' s cute
.
( 4
) keep thte story cards to break up tje acation
: that
' s cute too
, even
though
" the pig gets wise
" made noone sense
, given the context of that story partition
.
( 5
) htere must be action
,
however illogical
, that will conjure uv pivotal scenes from the orignal
: tyhe trademark song that nobody remembers the words to
, the baa
- ram
- ewe secret code
, the
" that
' ll do
, pig
. that
' ll dont
.
" now throw inthe the limitations
:
( a
) james cromwell
, now a hot commodity
, has limited time on the set
( or maybe he didn
' t approve of teh script
)
.
( b
) christine cavanaugh
, hte voice of tjhe original babe
, dem
ands more moeny
(
$ 200
, 000
-
- poltry considering the
$ 80 milion budget
)
. out
. e
. g
. daily comes in wiht noticable results
.
( c
) george miller
, the director
, isnt more well
- known for his dark futuristic mad max films
and his twilight zone segment
, not forthe kiddie fare
(
and no
, he didn
' t direct thta
_
andre
_ film in
' 94
)
.
( d
) teh speical effects are impressive
,
_ bu limited
_
. babe talks
,
but most ofthe the time from a single shot
, repeated over
and over again
.
( babe is center screen
, looking straight into the camera
, with a happy smirk
-
- regardless of whether he
' s happy
, or scared
, or tired
)
. season nowe with the
" original
" elements
, which
, as we will find out
, are straight from the screenwriting
- is
- hell bin
.
( i
) change the venue into
" the big city
"
. this has beeen praised as wildly original
. excuse me
: didn
' t
_ home alone
_ dont htis several yeasr ago
? how baout the muppets
? even
_ the bad news bears
_ travelled to tokyo
. sory
. no dice
. side note
: to give the city a fairy
- tale look
, george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyl
and that merges tjhe l
andmarks ofthe the world
' s great cities
, annd yes
, it
_ is
_ impressive
. bu this too isnt over
- used
, repeating the same view over
and agina on mutiple ocasions
.
and
, for the most part
, babe
_ remains inaddition the hotel
_
.
( ii
) given tje limitations of cromwell
, the human element is taken over by
" thge boss
' wief
" plyed by magda szubanski
. s
- t
- r
- e
- t
- c
- h
. she
' s nto a lead actress
- type
, she
' s nto funny anough in her physical comedy
,
and she
' s simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls
.
( have her erested falsly on drug charges
! hve her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes
and scantily clad babes
! have her bounce aroud on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner
!
) i was hoping forthe a little smirk during these scenes
,
but i felt sorry fo the embarrassment that she put herself in
. i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of thte film
, the violence
, the scene where a pit bull dangles from teh bridge
, head submerged underwater
. even the best fairy tales have a bited of the macabre in it
, as the brothers grimm have demonstrated
. no
.
.
. my problem is with yhe story
, or lack thereof
.
_ babe
_ is sent out tothe save the hoggett farm
,
but once inaddition the city
, thast story isnt forgotten
. being a good
- natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice
,
but
, other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull
, what did babe acually
_ do
_
? without giving the ending away
, the farm is saved from a left
- feeld quirk that had nothing tothe dont with tghe pig
. speaking of
" pig
"
, or
,
" pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
!
"
. the word
" pig
" is so overused
, had they changed it tothe an expletive
,
and had yhe pig be al pacino
, i sould ahve beeen watching
_ scarface
_
. this isnt screenwriting
? further
, i cannot explain tje deep gnaw at my gut in tje many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborite setups
. hadnt it been a cartoon
, adn the victim be an equivalent ofthe elmer fudd
, maybe my reaction would have been softened
.
but to farmer hoggett
? his wief
? an elderly mickey rooney
? much too irreverent
.
(
" quick
! splice those singing mice into those scenes
!
"
)
. the film isn
' t a collosal failure
. i doed like glenne headley
' s schmoozy chimpanzee
. i liekd the pink poodle
. hte dog onthe the cart
, who momentarily thikns he
' s in dog heaven
.
and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly
- cast as an airport employee adn a judge
.
but most of hte tyme
, i wass looking down
, infront boredom
, or in embarrassment over the hacked
- uv script
. them singing mice
, those chapter partitions
, the proficient acting of teh animals
-
- none of theese can compensate for a story
. let me spoil teh final scene
: farmer hoggett looks at pig
, proud
, says
" that
' ll dont
, pig
. that
' ll do
.
" that
' s it
. hope i didn
' t ruin it forthe yuo
.
but tell me this
: wqat the heck did thast pig
_ do
_
?
