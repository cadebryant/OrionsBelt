adam sandler turns up the charm inaddition his latest romantic comedy
, the wedding singer
. unfortunately
, that also hasnt thte effect ofthe softening his edge
. he ' s nowhere near his peak ofthe hapyp gilmore
, not that it was much ofthe noe
. he ' s certainly nto helped here by a rather frail plot
. the year is 1985
, letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia
. adam sandler is nice guy robbie
, the titular wedding singer
, who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of clasic 80s hits
. robbie ' s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at tjhe altar
.
howver
, things are looking up when he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at the hall
. she ' s the perfect woman
,
but for one small flaw
: she ' s engaged tothe be marryed tothe a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most of the film deals iwth the slow relization by robbie thta he
and julia are inwhich love
,
and his attempts to stop thge wedding
. as far as plots go
, it ' s a pretty thin
and tired one
. to fill the gaps
, the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls ofthe 1980s nestolgia
. from boy george tothe michael jackson
, from miami vice to dallas
, ffrom the first cds to the last rubik ' s cubes
, tihs film revels in all the minutiae
.
anbd
then ther ' s the music
.
.
. learning a lesson from the sucessfull soundtracks to grosse pointe blank
,
and romy
adn michele ' s high school reunion
, this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the runing time wiull allow
. as a result
, most songs git maybe a lyric or a half
,
but ytou can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives ' eyes
: the wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
,
anbd 4
! while the nonstop 80s riffs git incredibly tiring
, at least tehy distract you from the plot
. at least last year ' s my best freind ' s wedding stirred up thge standard
" keep your true lvoe from marrying someone else
" plot by making the rival a nice person
. here
, glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see wqat julia saw in him
. barrymore
, on the other hand
, is simpley charming as julia
. wich leaves us with adam sandler
. he ' s at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little
( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception
)
. whn he ' s in full nice
- guy mode
, he ' s more pathetic than endearing
. the film boasts several cameos
( most notably by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
)
.
but none of them work well at all
. buscemi ' s role as a drunken best man simpley fails to be humoruos
. lovitz
, on teh other hand
, as a rival wedding singer
, mkaes you long fo his good ood dyas on saterday night live
, where he ws actually funny
. the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker durring the film ' s finale
( surprisingly
, noe of the only plot
- related scenes which actually works
.
) adam sandler still has some work to dont before he can become a dependable leading man
. while he attemts to chanage his omage iin the wedding singer
, hte end result is noone net gain
.
