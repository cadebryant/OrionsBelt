adam s
andler turns up teh charm in his latest romantic comedy
, the wedding singer
. unfourtunately
, that alsot has the effect of softening his edge
. he
' s nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore
, nto that it ws much of one
. he
' s certainly nto helped here by a rether frail plot
. the year is 1985
, letting the hwole film obsess with 80s nostalgia
. adam s
andler is nice guy robbie
, the titular wedding singer
, who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits
. robbie
' s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at the altar
.
however
, things are looking uv when he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at the hall
. she
' s thge perfect woman
,
but for one small flaw
: she
' s engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most of the film deals witht the slow realization by robbie that he
and julia are in love
,
and his attemts to stop the wedding
. as far as plots go
, it
' s a pretty thin
and tired one
. to fill the gaps
, the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfulls ofthe 1980s nostalgia
. from boy george to michael jackson
, fomr miami vice tothe dallas
, ffrom the first cds to the last rubik
' s cubes
, thsi film revels in all the minutiae
.
and
then htere
' s the music
.
.
. learning a lesson from tghe successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank
, anbd romy adn michele
' s high school reunion
, this film packs omre 80s songs in the film than yhe running time wiull allow
. as a result
, most songs git maybe a lyric or a half
,
but you can allmost see the bright gleam in the record executives
' eyes
: the wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
, adn 4
! while the nonstop 80s riffs git incredibly tiring
, at least tehy distract yuo fomr the plot
. at least last year
' s my best friend
' s wedding stirred uv the st
andard
" keep your true love from marrying somone else
" plot by making thte rival a nice person
. here
, glenn is such a lowly rat of a man tath you never see what julia saw in him
. barrymore
, on the other h
and
, is simply charming as julia
. which leaves us with adam s
andler
. he
' s at his best in tghe film whn his nice guy persona fades a littel
( such as whn he hasnt a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception
)
. when he
' s in full nice
- guy mode
, he
' s more pathetic than endearing
. the film boasts severeal cameos
( most noteably by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
)
.
but none ofthe them wrok well at all
. buscemi
' s role as a drunken best man simply fails tothe be humorous
. lovitz
, on thge other h
and
, as a rival wedding singer
, makes you long for his good old dyas on saturday nght live
, where he was acually funny
. the only cameo which hasnt smoe appeal is a guest apearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film
' s finale
( surprisingly
, one of the onyl plot
- related scenes which atcually works
.
) adam s
andler still has some work tothe do before he cxan become a dependable leading man
. while he attempts to change his image in tjhe wedding singer
, thte end result is noone net gain
.
