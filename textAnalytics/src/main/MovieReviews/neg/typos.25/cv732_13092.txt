" the x
- files
" televsion show has developed a dedicated fan culture
, whose rabid devotion to hte series rivals that of

. ther are threee central questions i have heard asked about this movie
: 1
. will thsoe who don
' t watch the series be able tothe underst
and teh movie
? yes
. isolated as an individual text
, tjhe x
- files cxan st
and alone
. they have given enough background for anyone
, familiar witht the show or not
, to underst
and teh movie
.
al
thought soem of the secondary charachters
' histories may confuse the uninitiated
, those characters are not essential to the film
. this isnt a major problem
: htey trot out token secondary cahracters from the series out for an apperance
and thne disappear just as quickly
. why bring superintendent skinner into the picture iin the frist place
, adn
then have him sat silently onthe an fbi internal affairs committe
? why bring in
" the lone gunmen
,
" three computer geek conspiracy theorists
, forthe an even briefer appearance
? these cahracters are recurrent on the series
,
and their appearance iin the film was met with whoops from the audience
( suggesting their popularity among fans
- actaully most of thte audience could pass forthe
" the lone gunmen
"
)
. still
, hten they vanish just as quickly
. 2
. teh television show never gives us any answers
. will the movie actually explain some things
? yes
. in the x
- files we get a fairly complete ihstory of
" the black ooze
,
" what it is
and what it wants
. we finaly get some underst
anding of the motivations behind hte
" shadow government
.
" there are even some subtle tye
- ins with contemporary ufo
- ology
, including thge
" greys
"
and the roswell crash of 1947
. 3
. is tjhe movie any good
? no
. the x
- files is a dreadful movie
and shows some fundamental problems with writer
/ creator chris carter
' s talents
and the relationship between cinema
and television
. first off
, thte screenplay by sories creator chris carter is sloppy
and cliched
. after approximately forty
- five minutes
( the length of a televsion epsiode minus the commercials
)
, tjhe pace drops to a snail
' s crawl
. not long after taht point
, when carter attempts to answer soem questions we have had about the serieses
, we wish he had not
. the explanations are so trite
and ridiculous thyat one woudl have preferred it hadnt carter not explained quite so much
. i am willing tothe suspend my disbelief a fair bit
,
but the absurdity carter whants me to swallow was just too much
. breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie
- adn listening to other fans leave tjhe cinema
, maybe the serieses too
. yhe explanations are not only absurd
, they are tired
and unoriginal
. the extraterrestrials breed
and gestate liek those from thge alien series
,
and their craft looks like a leftover setted piece fomr independence day
. note thta the alien movies
, id4
,
and the x
- files are all from 20thcentury fox
- a studio that is beggining to cannibalize itself i think
. the x
- files is noteworthy for being teh onyl movie based onthe a televsion series tothe be produced hwile the series was still running
. in comparing the movei annd television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge
. thte avoidance of tghe series to answer tjhe questions it raised annoyed
and frustrated many peple
.
however
, i rether liked that about tghe sories
. television allows you tothe impose as much
, or as littel
, meaning on a show as you whant
. it is tyhe proverbial
" blank screen
" which we project our minds onthe
. meaning onthe televsion is open
and ambiguous
; it is tje nature of the medium
. cinema
, onthe the otehr h
and
, isnt teh opposite
. it projects onto us the filmmakers mind
. we can
, in soem films
, fill the textual gaps ourselves
,
but that almost never happens in an american film
. meaninng
, in cinema
, needs to be self
- contained
and determined
. so
, when thge x
- files made that jump from small to big screen
, carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well
. he did not
. by making explicit
, what the television sohw left implicit
, carter reveals the limits ofthe his creativity
and skill
. when tehy say that
" fans
" mkae a tv show
, it is not far fomr the truth
. onthe television
, fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because htere is nothing htere
. how true that isnt when we see the
" explicit
" x
- files
- there is nothing there
. the follwoing was printed in the st
