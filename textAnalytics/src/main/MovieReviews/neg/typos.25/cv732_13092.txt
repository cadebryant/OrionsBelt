i thiunk thta saying that the x
- files isnt one of thsi summer ' s most anticipated films is safe
. for five years
,
" the x
- files
" television sohw hasnt devolopped a dedicated fan culture
, whose rabid devotion to the series rivals thgat of
" star trek
" fans
. tje premise of both the movie
and the television series is two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal
; fox mulder
( david duchovny
) isnt hte avid beliver whose quest tothe fidn hte truth baout extraterrestial life borders onthe the paranoid
,
anbd dana scully
( gillian anderson
) is the scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder ' s flights ofthe fancy
. outlining the plot ofthe the x
- files movie is virtually impossible
, sicne tothe be general would result inaddition confusion
,
yet to be specific would give too much awya
. neverthless
, i will try
.
" thge black ooze
,
"
and extraterrestrial
, virus
- like substance is threatening earth
. a
" shadow government
" is aware ofthe this
,
but trys tothe cover
- up the aline existenec
. mulder
anbd scully know
" the truth isnt out ther
,
"
and so try to expose both the invasion
annd the cover
- up
. htere are three central questions i have heard asked about this movie
: 1
. will those who don ' t watch the series be able to understand the movie
? yes
. isolated as an individule text
, the x
- files cin stand alone
. they have given enough backgorund for anyone
, familiar with the sohw or not
, tothe understand the movie
.
although some of the secondary cahracters ' histories may confuse the uninitiated
, those charactors are not essential to tje film
. htis isnt a major problem
: they trot out tolkein secondary characters from the sories out for an appearance
and
thne disappear jsut as quickly
. why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the first place
,
and
hten ahev him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee
? why bring in
" the lone gunmen
,
" three computer geek conspiracy theorists
, fo an even briefer appeareance
? these characters are recurrent on the sories
,
and their appearance in the film wass met with whoops from tjhe audience
( suggesting their popularaty amung fans
- actually most of the audience could pass for
" the lone gunmen
"
)
. still
,
then they vanish just as quickly
. 2
. tyhe television sohw never gives us any answers
. wiull the movie actually explane some things
? yes
. in the x
- files we get a fairly complete history of
" the balck ooze
,
" waht it is
and what it wants
. we finaly get some understanding of tjhe motivations behind the
" shadow government
.
" htere are even some subtle tie
- ins with contemporary ufo
- ology
, including the
" greys
"
and the roswell crash of 1947
. 3
. is the movie any good
? noone
. the x
- files is a dreadful movie
and shows soem fundamental problems witht writter
/ creator chris carter ' s talents
adn the relationship between cinema
adn television
. first off
, the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy
adn cliched
. after approximately forty
- five minutes
( hte length of a television episode minus the commercials
)
, the pace drops to a snail ' s crawl
. nto long after that point
, wehn carter attemts tothe answer soem questions we haev had about the series
, we wish he had not
. the explanations are so trite
and ridiculous thta one would haev preferred it had carter not explained quite so much
. i am willing tothe suspend my disbelief a fair bit
,
but the absurdity carter whants me to swallow was just too much
. breaking tyhe suspention of disbelief destroys the movie
-
and listening to other fans leave the cinema
, maybe the sories too
. tje explanations are nto only absurd
, they are tired
anbd unoriginal
. the extraterrestrials breed
and gestate like those from the alien series
,
anbd their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day
. note tyhat the alien movies
, id4
,
and the x
- files are all from 20thcentury fox
- a studio tath isnt beginning to cannibalize itself i think
. the x
- files is noteworthy for being the onyl movie based onthe a television series to be produced while tje serieses was still running
. in comparing hte movie
and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge
. the avoidance ofthe the series tothe answer hte questions it rised anoyed
and frustrated many peopel
.
howver
, i rather liked taht about tje series
. televsion allows you tothe impose as much
, or as little
, meaninng on a show as you want
. it is tghe proverbial
" blank screen
" which we project our minds on
. meaninng onthe television is oepn
and ambiguous
; it isnt thge nature of the medium
. cinema
, onthe tjhe other hand
, isnt the opposite
. it projects onto us thge filmmakers mind
. we can
, inthe some films
, fill the textual gaps ourselves
,
bu taht almost never happens inwhich an american film
. meaninng
, in cinema
, needs to be self
- contained
and determined
. so
, when the x
- files made tyhat jump from small to big screen
, carter needed tothe tkae into consideration the differences inthe the medium as well
. he did nto
. by making explicit
, what tghe television show left implicit
, carter reveals the limits of his creativity
and skill
. wehn they say that
" fans
" amking a tv show
, it is not far from the truth
. on televsion
, fan culture must impose its meanings on the text baceause htere is nothing htere
. how true that isnt wehn we see the
" explicit
" x
- files
- ther is nothing there
