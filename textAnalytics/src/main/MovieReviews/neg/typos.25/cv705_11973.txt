i think of i know what you did last summer as tyhe movei that scream anbd scream 2 sould hve been
. mind you
,
though
, i mean this in thge worst possible way
. i know what you doed last summer isnt a typcial slasher flic wihtout the smarts ofthe the scream
' s
. as a result
, it
' s even worse than some ofthe your better campy horror pictures
( see nightmare on elm street
) because it thinks it
' s about thirty times smarter tahn it is
. based onthe a teen book ofthe hte smae name adn
, disappointingly
, adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson
, i know what you did last summer beggins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined whith some startling cinematography ofthe a cliff along the ocean
and an angsty sort sitting at the top
. the appropriate mood being set
( this is angst
- horror for the 90
' s
)
, we cut over to tghe july 4th aprade in a small north carolina twon
. ffrom htere
, we see the blond
, female protagonist
, helen shivers
( woodenly plyed by sarah michelle geller
)
, getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male
" hero
,
" barry cox
( woodenly played by ryan phillipe
)
, anbd matched brunette pair of protagonists
, julie james anbd ravy bronson
( woodenly palyed by party of five
' s jennifer love hewitt
and freddie prinze jr
.
, repsectively
) cheer her on
. after getting drunk at a party
, going tothe a beach to wittily discuss urban legend annd indulge in soem foreshadowing
, anbd having soem meaningful sex
( if you believe what the characters say
)
, the four run down some guy crossing thte windy cliff road at niht
. his face is mangled so they can
' t tell who it is
,
and they come tothe the dicision to dump him in thge ocean so as to not ruin any of theri future chances for success in the world
. cut to one year later
. the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad
. main brunette female
, the bright one of tjhe bunch
, has been plagued with guilt
and almost failed outloud ofthe college
. blond female has forfeited her dreams ofthe starring on guiding light
,
and now works at the famaly store in town
. brunette male is a fisherman
, living off the l
and
. blond male has become a complet jerk
and quarterback on some college football team
.
then
, predictably
, their past comes back to haunt them
. it all begins wtih an irrational murder
, followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer
, bad acting by a good actress
( anne heche
)
, an improbable plot
, bad acting by the main bad actors
, some more killing
, concluding in a climactic scene
, mostly climactic in the relief at tjhe end of thte movei
. all the while
, the actors anbd actresses spout off bad lines
,
and main brunette male doesnt his best keanu reeves imitation
. nto that yhe movie was without blessure
. count tyhe illogical plot twists
and bad lines for some funn
. mostly
,
though
, onot the costumes of main females
and how trendily unattractive tehy make the otherwise eye
- catching pair look
.
