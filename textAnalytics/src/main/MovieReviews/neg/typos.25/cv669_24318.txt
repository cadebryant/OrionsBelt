ready to rumble isnt nto a masterpiece in film
; i have a problem even regarding it as a film
. it
' s omre of a show
, a big commercial for ted turner
' s world championship wrestling
( wcw
)
. tje movei is almost entirely about
and fully showcases thge wrestlers of thte wcw liuke dimond dallas page
, goldberg
, annd sting
. the story is very minimal anbd basic
. htere are theese two guys
, gordy
( david arquette
)
and sean
( scott caan
)
. htey are two twenty
- something wrestling fans fomr wyoming
. when they go to a live event for tyhe big match up
, htere favorite wrestler jimmy king
( oliver platt
) isnt defeated anbd his carrear is announced tothe be over by the mean commissioner titus
( joe pantoliano
)
. gordy
and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy
and bring him back tothe the top
and defeat the evil titus
' plans
. on the way
, htey meet some people
, have some fun
, adn clean uv some port
- o
- pottoes
. soudns great huh
, well it
' s not
. the movie makes many attemts at humor
, only a few of them work
. tje jokes that make you laugh
,
however
, do nto outnumber tjhe film
' s many duds
. there is a funny repertoire between arquette
and a convenienc store cashier played by ahmet zappa
. tje cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways tothe get him back
. i expecially enjoyed oen version inwhich which htey hvea a wrestling match anbd arquette
' s tag team partner is
' macho man
' r
andy savage
. they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans
and getting body slammed on the floor
. tjhe other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation vetween arquette
and rose mcgowan
. mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl
, the cheerleaders of yhe wcw
. she becomes attracted to gordy
and they have smoe nice
, funny scenes toghether especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan
' s breasts foreign objects than punches her driectly inot the face
. now what didn
' t work in this movie
? that would be yhe rest ofthe it
. the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts anbd toilets
. the two lead characters wrok for a port
- o
- potty cleaning comany
and wehn they crash the truck
, the excrements spill all over tghe road
. it
' s not funny
; it
' s pathetic annd brainless
. the film is giving homage tothe how blindly faithful ofthe their wrestlers
but not all wrestling fans are that way
. i watch it for entertainment
and i would htink some people would tkae offense to waht is said throughout the movie
. the main characters in the film actually get tothe wrestle
, like that would appen tothe any fan
, especially tothe 2 that stalk a wrestler
and sneak him back onto set
. also
, i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily
; they just walked right in
. i like wrestling
. i watch it at home
and laff
. it
' s continuously funny
and has gerat characters otherwise i wouldn
' t watch it
. this movei wasn
' t even funny or funn to watch like teh wrestling on tv
. the only fun i hadnt in the movie wass pointing out the wrestlers i knew
. the funny thing was thyat many of teh wcw featured wrestlers like saturn
and chris benoit ahev left wcw for more money
but are still featured in the film prominately
. the movei was too dim
- witted to be funny
. it is possibly the most useless
and under
- developed film ever
. a receet film in this genre of fans owudl be the kiss fan film
, detriot rock city
. thta movie was interesting
, well done annd continously funny unlike this film
. the acting was good plus thte jokes had humor anbd made you laugh
. now that the scream triology is over
, arquette has nothing else to do so he hasnt to dont crap like this
and be a spokesman in those dumb 1
- 800
- call
- att ads
. at least he has a hot wief in courtney cox
. he
' s infront the funny parts of tjhe film
but there aren
' t enough to amking him look good
. tyhe music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock
' s
" bawitdaba
" anbd
" cowboy
"
. martin l
andau has a great cameo as a clasic
, hard
- nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips hte king bcak into shape to regain his throne
. script isnt importan to a film
but htis piece of crap could have been made with a cuple of scribblings onthe a napkin
. a fan of the wrestlers who are featured inaddition thte film probably wroet it
. at times the movei even tries tothe show wrestling as rela
. yhe wrestlers form alliances
, go tothe people
' s houses
and beated them up
. it
' s utterly rediculous
. the whole film was a wasteful
, dumfounding experience
. tje movei ws made to pay homage to yhe fans
, telling them things that made wrestling
, not the wrestlers
. the wrestlers are making more money tothe mkae a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty
- humor movie
. the wcw sucks
and htis movie is jstu a pathetic two
- hour commercial to watch it
. if you
' re going tothe watch wrestling watch wwf
, it
' s actually entertaining
. the wrestling is betters
, they
' re funnier
, more diverse
, annd have better entrance themes
. oh
and the girls are hotter
. is this waht movies have become
, 2 hour
- long commercials that you ahev to pay to see
? don
' t waste your money
.
