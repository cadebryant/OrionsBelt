ready to rumble isnt not a masterpiece inaddition film
; i hvea a problem even regarding it as a film
. it ' s more ofthe a show
, a big commericial forthe ted turner ' s world championship wrestling
( wcw
)
. yhe movie is almost entirely about
and fully showcases the wrestlers of hte wcw liuke diamond dallas page
, goldberg
,
and sting
. the tsory is very minimal
anbd basic
. there are these two guys
, gordy
( david arquette
)
and sean
( scott caan
)
. they are two twenty
- something wrestling fans from wyoming
. when they go to a live event for tje big match up
, there favorite wrestler jimmy king
( oliver platt
) is defeated
and his career is announced to be over by the mean commisioner titus
( joe pantoliano
)
. gordy
and sean decide tothe go on a quest to find jimmy
and bring him back tothe the top
and defeat the evil titus ' plans
. on the way
, they meet some people
, have some fun
,
annd clean up smoe port
- o
- potties
. sounds great huh
, well it ' s nto
. tje movie makes many attempts at humor
, only a few of them work
. the jokes that make you laugh
,
however
, do not outnumber the film ' s many duds
. there is a funny repertoire between arquette
adn a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa
. the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways tothe get him back
. i especially enjoyed noe version in which they have a wrestling match
and arquette ' s tag team partner is ' macho man ' randy savage
. tehy wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans
adn getting body slammed onthe the floor
. the other good part ofthe the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette
and rose mcgowan
. mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl
, the cheerleaders of the wcw
. she becomes attracted to gordy
and they have some nice
, funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan ' s breasts foreign objects tahn punches her directly inot the face
. now wqat didn ' t wokr in this movie
? that woudl be tje rest ofthe it
. thte flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts
and toilets
. the two lead characters work forthe a port
- o
- potty cleaning company
and wehn htey kresh the truck
, the excrements spill all over tje road
. it ' s not funny
; it ' s pathetic
and brainless
. tyhe film is giving homage tothe how blindly faithful of their wrestlers
but nto all wrestling fans are tath way
. i watch it for enteratinment
and i would think some people owudl take offense to what is said thoughout the movie
. yhe main charactors inaddition the film actually git to wrestle
, liek that would appen tothe any fan
, especially tothe 2 that stalk a wrestler
and sneak him back onto set
. also
, i wondered how they got into tghe backstage so easily
; they just walked right in
. i like wrestling
. i watch it at hmeo
adn laugh
. it ' s continously funny
and hasnt grat characters otherwise i wouldn ' t watch it
. htis movie wasn ' t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv
. the onyl fun i hadnt in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew
. the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn
annd chris benoit have left wcw for more money
but are still featured inwhich the film prominently
. the movie was too dim
- witted to be funny
. it isnt possably the most useless
and under
- developed film ever
. a receet film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film
, detroit rock city
. thgat movie was intresting
, well done
and continously funny unlike this film
. the acting was good plus tyhe jokes had humor
and made you laugh
. nowe that the scream triology is over
, arquette has nothing alse to do so he has to dont crap like thsi
and be a spokesman in those dumb 1
- 800
- call
- att ads
. at least he has a hot wife inspite courtney cox
. he ' s in the funny parts of the film
but there aren ' t enough to mkea him look good
. the music was bad allso feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock ' s
" bawitdaba
"
and
" cowboy
"
. martin landau hasnt a graet cameo as a classic
, hard
- nosed wrestling trainer named sal tht whips tjhe king back into shape to regain his throne
. script is imporatnt to a film
but this piece of crap could have been made with a cuple of scribblings onthe a napkin
. a fan ofthe the wrestlers who are featured infront the film probablly wroet it
. at times hte movie even tries to show wrestling as real
. the wrestlers form alliances
, go to people ' s houses
and beat them up
. it ' s utterly ridiculous
. the whole film wass a wasteful
, dumfounding experience
. the movie was made tothe pay homage to the fans
, telling them things that made wrestling
, not the wrestlers
. the wrestlers are making mroe money to make a movie to thank the fans for beign fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty
- humor movie
. the wcw sucks
and this movie is just a pathetic two
- hour commercial tothe watch it
. if you ' re gogin to watch wrestling watch wwf
, it ' s actually entertaining
. the wrestling is betters
, htey ' re funnier
, more diverse
,
and have better entrance themes
. oh
and the girls are hotter
. is tihs what movies have become
, 2 hour
- long commercials that you have to pay to see
? don ' t waste your money
.
