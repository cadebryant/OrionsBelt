a sensuous romantic comedy
, about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom
. there is no special ingredient on tjhe menu forthe what is dished outloud
, its the kind ofthe stuff i
' ve seen befor
and was made nauseous by its silly diea of love adn what it thinks is funny
. teh film plans to exploit tghe beauty adn sweetness of its delicious star pen
? lope cruz
, who plays a brasillian chef with a magical touch forthe bringing out the spices in her preperations
, teh aromas just sensually waft fomr her cooking pot
, bu who can
' t get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story
. pen
? lope was wonderful in pedro almod
? var
' s
" all about my mother
,
" bu here she is so visible in such a stale story
, where she cin only smile
and tease tjhe audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking
, that she somehow looks rediculous
, as if she got egg all over her face
. tghe best you can say about her
, is tht she
' s not tothe blaim for this picture being so off
. this explotation ofthe sex film without even delivering nudity or sex
, isnt in my opinion
, worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will
. the story is all about tjhe lvoe
, motion sickness
,
and cooking ability of isabella
( cruz
)
, who isnt born inspite bahia
, brazil
and learns to cook at an early age ffrom her parents
' cook
. tothe cure her motion sickness
, her parents tried every remedy
, until they whent tothe a spiritualist who prayed to the godess of tje sea forthe her cure
. she is able to controll it now as long as she doesn
' t drive a car
, ride elevators
, follow infront dancing
,
and is tghe woman on top whn making love
. iin other words
, she has tothe be in control ofthe things
. iin her small fishing town she falls in love with a h
andsome macho latin waiter
, toninho oliveira
( murilo ben
? cio
)
and marries him
. they open up a successful restauant
, where she slaves away in the kichen
but he gets all the credit for it
, even
though he
' s a loafer
. one night she catches him inaddition bed with another girl anbd decides to leave for san francisco
. we don
' t see her in flight
, so i can
' t tell how she h
andled her motion sickness problem
-
- unless she flew yhe plane
. she visits her friend
' s apartment monica
( harold perrineau jr
.
)
, who is a cross
- dresser
, blending right into the san francisco scene
. to cast away her love for the iresistable toninho
, she calls her spiritualist friend
and gets her tothe cast an irreversible spll
, freeing her from ever loving him agian
. her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff
( mark feurerstein
) gets a whiff ofthe her cooking
and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell
and presents her with her pwn live tv cooking show
. you can really write the script from here onthe by yourself
.
.
. as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had
,
but thnigs continue to go bad for him
: there is a curse he caused on yhe fishing in his village
, there isnt no chef to replace his wife
, as the erstaurant is baout to close for ogod
. so he comes to san francisco
, figuring he can charm her again
. he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians
, tghe ones he used when courting her
, wehn he serenaded her under her window
. he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick
, the yuppie tv producer chasing after her
,
and sees tath she is no longer charmed by him
. when he sneaks onthe her tv show set
and trys to woo her with his musical group
and him singing corny lvoe songs to her
, hte ratings go up annd he
' s hired as a regular on the sohw
. the sohw gets so big
, that the network honchos cmo onboard
, taking it national
.
but they want to chanage the ethnic flavor ofthe the show
, get rid of monica because he
' s a freak
, have isabella cook with tabasco instead of tjhe brazilian peppers she uses
,
and tehy chanage her ethnic dresses to low
- cut vanna white type of sexy dresses
. cliff
, her would
- be boyfriend
, acts creepy
and sides with the network big
- shots
, even
though he loved everything she did
. these tv scenes were not onyl bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos
, they weere revolting
. it was an insult to one
' s intelligence
. i
' m sure that i
' m not spoiling hte ending for anyone
, when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways
and together they cook up a meel thyat breaks her spell of loving him again
. if the film wasn
' t terrible enough
, monica
and cliff act on their attraction for earch otehr
and become lovers
. it was so awkwardly done
, that it had no sense of truth or humer to it
. this film might as well ahve been made by the same network guys featured in this film
, beacuse it doesn
' t look or fiel like an almod
? var film
, the type of film it aspired to be
,
but more like a film that wass interferred wiht from above
. its more like a futile commerical film tht is more annoying than charming annd more dull thna chic
, as it searches for box office heaven
.
