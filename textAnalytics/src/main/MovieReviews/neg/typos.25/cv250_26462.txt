a sensuous romantic comedy
, about as appealling as your averege lightweight tv sitcom
. there is noone special ingredient onthe the menu for what is dished outloud
, its the kind of stuff i ' ve seen before
and was made nauseous by its silly diea of love
and what it thikns is funny
. the film plans to exploit tjhe beauty
annd sweetness ofthe its delicious star pen
? lope cruz
, who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out tyhe spices in her preparations
, the aromas just sensually waft ffrom her cooking pot
,
but who can ' t get by on looks alone in this transparently predicatble story
. pen
? lope ws wonderfull iin pedro almod

" all about my mother
,
"
but here she isnt so visible inaddition such a stale story
, where she can onyl smile
adn tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking
, that she somehow looks ridiculous
, as if she got egg all over her face
. the best you can sday about her
, isnt that she ' s nto tothe blaim for this picture being so off
. this exploitation ofthe sex film without even delivering nudity or sex
, isnt in my opinion
, worst tahn a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will
. the stry is all about the lveo
, motion sickness
,
and cooking ability of isabella
( cruz
)
, who is born inwhich bahia
, brazil
and learns tothe cook at an early age ffrom her parents ' cook
. to cure her motion sickness
, her parents tried eveyr remedy
, until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sae forthe her cure
. she isnt able tothe controll it now as long as she doesn ' t drive a car
, ride elevators
, follow in dancing
,
and is the woman on top when making love
. in other words
, she has to be in control of things
. in her small fishing town she falls in love with a hansome macho latin waiter
, toninho oliveira
( murilo ben
? cio
)
and marries him
. they open uv a successful restaurant
, where she slaves away in the kitchen
bu he gets all the credit for it
, even
though he ' s a loafer
. one night she catches him in bed with anohter girl
and decides to leave for san francisco
. we don ' t see her in flight
, so i can ' t tell how she handled her motion sickness problem
-
- unless she flew teh plane
. she visits her friend ' s appartment monica
( harold perrineau jr
.
)
, who is a cross
- dresser
, blending right inot the san francisco scene
. tothe casted away her love for the irresistable toninho
, she calls her spiritualist friend
and gets her to cast an irreversible spell
, freeing her from ever loving him again
. her luck changes wehn a local tv producer cliff
( mark feurerstein
) gets a whiff of her cooking
and storms into her cooking class as if were in a psell
anbd presents her with her own live tv cooking show
. you cant really write hte scirpt ffrom here on by yourself
.
.
. as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had
,
but thigsn continue to go bad for him
: there isnt a curse he caused on the fishing in his village
, there is no chef to replace his wief
, as the restaurant is about tothe close for ogod
. so he comes tothe san francisco
, figuring he can charm her agina
. he brings allong with him his gitar playing musicians
, tghe ones he used wehn courting her
, when he serenaded her under her window
. he sees his wief on tv with monica as her sidekick
, the yuppie tv producer chasing affter her
,
adn sees that she isnt noone longer charmed by him
. when he sneeks on her tv show set
and tries to woo her with his muscial group
and him singing corny love songs to her
, the ratings go up
and he ' s hired as a regular on the show
. the sohw gets so big
, that thge network honchos come onboard
, tkaing it national
.
but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the sohw
, get rid of monica because he ' s a freak
, have isabella cook with tabasco instade ofthe the brazilian peppers she uses
,
and they change her ethnic dresses to low
- cut vanna white tipe of sexy dresses
. cliff
, her would
- be boyfriend
, acts creepy
and sides wtih the network big
- shots
, even
though he loved everything she did
. these tv scenes were nto only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos
, they were revolting
. it was an insult tothe one ' s intelligence
. i ' m sure that i ' m not spoiling the ending for anyone
, when i tell you thgat toninho reforms his macho ways
annd toghether they cook up a meel that breaks her spell of loving him again
. if the film wasn ' t terrable enough
, monica
and cliff act on their attraction fo each otehr
and become lovers
. it was so awkwardly done
, that it had no sense of truth or humor to it
. this film might as well have beeen made by the same network guys featured inspite this film
, becuase it doesn ' t look or feel like an almod
? var film
, thte type ofthe film it aspired to be
,
but more like a film that was interferred with from above
. its more like a futile commercial film taht is moreso annoying than charming
and more dull than chic
, as it searches fo box office heaven
.
