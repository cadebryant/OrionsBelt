let me begin by saying thgat this isnt easily the worst movei in the entire official
(
and even unoffical
) james bond series
. it is so full of self
- parody
and silly characters that ytou would alomst belivee you were watching a spoof
. an omen of what is to come is provided by tje pre
- credits sequence
, a dull affair featuring a confrontation vetween a man
( it
' s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere inaddition thte movei
)
and the assasins of the title
. a song whith woefully terrible lyrics follows
,
and the rest of thte movei is even worse
. hte plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule
- the
- world so often found in the james bond movies of tje 70s
,
but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin
, francisco scaramanga
( christopher lee
, putting in a performence which is one of the rare saving graces ofthe this movie
) who someone has aparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore
' s 007
. there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis
and a missing solar cell with 95
% efficiency
. it
' s as much of a mess as it soudns
. bond is
" helped
" in his task by mary goodnight
( ekl
and
)
, whose character couldn
' t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo
. during tyhe course of the movei she gets locked in both a closet
and a car trunk
, blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser annd serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever
. maud adams
( later to star inspite octopussy
) is a much more stronger
and usefull character
,
but she hardly features in the movie
. scaramanga
' s lackey isnt a dwarf called nik
- nak
, who rether fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series
, serving uv annoyance
and weak dialogue in equal measures
. worse still is an almost total lack ofthe acation throughout the whole movie
. there is bu one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in
( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists
-
- another misguided attept at humour
)
. the solitary car chase might have been a highlight
, bu the
" action
" is interrupted onthe a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff
( j
. w
. pepper
, played by clifton james ofthe live
and let die
" fame
"
) yelling stupid comments outloud of the passanger window
. he is easily yhe most irritating character in a james bond movie
. even his presense could have beeen made bearable by oney of teh most impressive car stunts in cinematic istory
, a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge
-
- could have been
, except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print
. on top ofthe taht debacle
, tje whole end of the film isnt an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga
' s
" funhouse
"
. the only good thnig that cameback out of this movie was thyat the producers had to amke the enxt film infact the series
( the infinitely superior
" the spy who loved me
"
) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive
.
