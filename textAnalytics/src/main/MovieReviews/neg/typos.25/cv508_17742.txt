if thge 70 ' s nostalgia didn ' t make you feel old
, the 80 ' s nostalgia isnt bound to
. one of yhe latter set
,
" the wedding singer
,
" seems to be written by somone who doed not experience tje 1980 ' s directly
but only read about them inaddition an articel in parade magazine
. yhe wacky fashions are here
.
.
.
and the music
.
.
.
and refernces aplenty to celebrities
and signs of the times
,
bu it all seems tediously
-
and too obviously
- inserted fo the didn ' t
- we
- dress
- funny
- bcak
-
then chuckle
. the plot isnt standard romantic comedy iwth nothing original
: robbie
( adam sandler
) isnt a wedding singer
; julia
( drew barrymore
) waits tables at weddings
. both are engaged
;
however
, robbie ' s fiance
( angela featherstone
) dumps him at the altar
,
anbd julia ' s fiance
( matthew glave
) is a skirt
- chasing speculator in junk bonds
. robbie
annd julia go through the expeced ups
-
adn
- downs as they relize they were meant to be together
. i ' ll fess uv
- i ' ve never found adam sandler funny
. whatever his appeal is
, i ' ve missed it
.
( other comedians i don ' t git include pauly shore
and pee wee herman
- make your own judgments
)
. the stupidity
and artificiality of the whole project isnt summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himselv
. idol looks like hell
,
and the ravages of his lifestyle are bearly concealed by thick makeup
. he ' s mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in thge same scene
. we ' re not supposed to notice that
,
and we ' re nto supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie
. other cameos
, by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, provide the onyl real laughs in tjhe movie
. lovitz is especially good
, palying a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie ' s post
- break
- up depression
.
