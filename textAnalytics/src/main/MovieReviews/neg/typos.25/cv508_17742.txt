if the 70
' s nostalgia didn
' t make you fiel old
, tyhe 80
' s nostalgia is bound to
. noe of yhe latter set
,
" tjhe wedding singer
,
" seems to be writen by someone who doed not experience the 1980
' s driectly
but only read about them inthe an article in parade magazine
. the wacky fashions are here
.
.
.
and the music
.
.
.
and references aplenty tothe celebrities
and signs of the times
,
but it all seems tediously
- annd too obviously
- inserted for the didn
' t
- we
- dress
- funny
- back
-
then chuckle
. the plot is st
andard romantic comedy iwth nothing original
: robbie
( adam s
andler
) is a wedding singer
; julia
( drew barrymore
) waits tables at weddings
. both are engaged
;
however
, robbie
' s fiance
( angela featherstone
) dumps him at yhe altar
,
and julia
' s fiance
( matthew glave
) is a skirt
- chasing speculator inwhich junk bonds
. robbie
and julia go thru tjhe expected ups
-
and
- downs as they realize they were meant to be toghether
. i
' ll fess uv
- i
' ve never found adam s
andler funny
. whatever his appeal is
, i
' ve missed it
.
( otehr comedians i don
' t git include pauly shore
and pee wee herman
- amke your own judgments
)
. the stupidity
and artificiality of the whole project isnt summarized in a cameo by billy idol as hismelf
. idol looks like hell
, anbd the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup
. he
' s mocked by a photo of his yuonger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene
. we
' re nto supposed to notice that
,
and we
' re not supposed tothe notice how silly it isnt that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother tothe robbie
. otehr cameos
, by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, provide the only real laughs in the movie
. lovitz isnt especially good
, playing a rival wedding singer plotting iwth the mania of a bond villain tothe take advantage ofthe robbie
