- chuck dowling
, the jacksonville film jurnal i wrote tjhe above sentence in my review for 1997
' s batman anbd robin
. apparently
, no one herad my words
. oh
, how i wish you had heard them
. oh how i wish somone had stopped him
.
.
. because he
' s done it again
. teh plot ofthe 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a surprisingly decent
and engrossing tale
. in fatc
, it was everything that 8mm is nto
. inspite tje opening mintues of 8mm
, we see private detective toom welles
( nicolas cage
) wroking on a case for a prestigious member ofthe tjhe u
. s
. government
. keep this fatc in mind
, cage is trusted with an important case
, which he solves
. he returns home to his wife
and new daughter
, annd even finds tiem tothe rake his yard
( keep tht in mind too
, it
' s importamt as well
)
. he
' s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery
. after her husb
and
' s death she comes across a film in his private safe
. it appears to be snuff film
, a sort of urban legend ofthe the pornography industry inaddition wich someone is actually brutally murdered forthe the camera
. tghe woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film
, hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film
. so he sets off onthe a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film
. the main probelm wtih 8mm is tht the whole film is completely pointless
. welles is actually selected for thge case by the old woman
' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an actor who alwasy plays hte smae type of character
, thgat being a bad guy
)
. when you firt see him
, your first instinct is tht he
' s behind the whole thing
. the choice ofthe casting does the film in
.
then
, as welles beggins his investigation
, at times we will see a shadowy figure follwoing him
. tjhe only person it could possably be is the lawyer
( or someone sent by yhe lawyer
) because no one knows welles isnt even investigating anything
yet
. so your first instinct has now been confirmed
.
then
, whn it is in fact revealed that the lawyer isnt a part of the wohle thign
, he tells welles that he was chosen fo tje case because he was young
and inexperienced
( in one of those ridiculous
" since we
' re goign tothe kill you anyway
, why not tell you the whole thing
" moments
)
.
but ealier wehn we see welles bieng hired for the case he
' s told tht he was hired because he comes highly recommended
. huh
? also
, when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the hwole hting
, his main goal is to get hte film back
. so why did he give it up in hte first place
?
! the lawyer had the film yhe whole tiem
, hten gave it away to tyhe private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case annd return the film
?
! it
' s totally absurd
.
.
.
and this is the screenwrighter of seven
? lite in thte film ther
' s a confrontation vetween all the main characters
,
and after a struggle noe ofthe the character
' s guns ends up underneath a car
. cage
, who has beeen h
andcuffed tothe a bed
, is rapidly trying to get to his gun
, which is onthe a tbale
. james g
andolfini
' s character goes for the gun under the car inspite what isnt supposted to be a scene of
" suspense
"
. you see
, the gun isnt just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he
' s trying to reach it fomr
, annd so instead ofthe goign around hte car to thge otehr side
( where he can easily reach it
) he just keesh stretching
. go arround to the other side of teh car
!
! this goes on for minutes
.
then
, aftter cage gets his gun
, g
andolfini
then decides it woudl be best to go around to the other side of the car
. boy
, schumacher is really really getting on my nerves
. i thiunk the final straw would be wehn cage returns home
, devastated by everything taht he
' s seen onthe this case
,
and
then is noone longer able tothe rake his lawn
! we actualy see a shooted of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard
. other things that bugged me about 8mm
: one owudl be yhe music
, if yuo can call it that
. whenever the score starts up
, it sounds liek techno music
,
and
then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it
. awful decision ther joel
. anyother is cage
' s performance
. at this point he
' s capable of a wide range ofthe performances
, eather good or bad
. for 8mm
, he delivers a very wooden one
, adn onyl shines when he
' s interacting with joaquin pheonix
( who gives a graet performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart ofthe gold who helps cage with his case
)
. you
' re capable of much better mr
. cage
. now as for you mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i
' m starting tothe doubt if you
' re capable ofthe anything else besides urinating onto the insitution of american cinema
.
