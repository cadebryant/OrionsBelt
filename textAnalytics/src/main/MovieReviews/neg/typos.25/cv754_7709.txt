capsule
: godawful
" comedy
" that
' s amazingly shabby
and cut
- rate
,
and rather bereft of laughs
. i ws having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers
: international man of mystery
. i desperately needed something to cheer me uv
, or at least distract me so i could get a clear head
. get soem perspective
. even dumb movies can do tath fo me
, sometimes
. i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment
, bu i am certain now that austin powers would have alsot sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won tje lottery
. michael myers has taken a character that woudl barely have supported a five
- minute sketch on saturday night live
and stretched it tothe the length of a feature film
, padding it outloud with toilet jokes
and thte sort of props
- stratagically
- positioned
- between
- naked
- actors
-
and
- camera gags thgat benny hill got tired of fifteen yeras ago
. teh plot
, what little there isnt of it
: back in the swinging mod hep sixties
( i don
' t think i
' m doing a disservice to yhe movie
' s attempted early look
and feel by describing it that way
)
, sexy brittish secret agent austin powers tangled witht his nemesis dr
. evil
. evil launhed himselv inot orbit
and cryogenically forze himselv tothe return decades later
, when powers was out of yhe picture
. powers also had himself frozen
,
and he wakes up to find tyhe nineties a vyre hard timne to deal with
. the basic gag
, that ofthe powers
' total inability to cope iwth thge nineties
, isnt not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with
. hte bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics
: james bond gags
( ofthe which tihs movie has no end
, right down to thge silly chracter names
)
, inept slapstick
, toilet humer
,
and stratagically placed props
.
.
. the movie
' s amazingly bereft of ideas
, come to think ofthe it
, with a couple of bright exceptions
. one is dr
. evil
' s son
-
- there isnt a sidesplitting scene where father
and son go to an encounter gropu
, chaired by carrie fisher
-
-
and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics varous forms of transportation from behind a couch
( it
' s a visual gag
-
- hard to describe
,
and hard to reccomend seeing thte movie for
)
. a lot of sixties kitsch has beeen resurrected
and thrown on the screen for this movie
,
but it
' s desperate rather than clever
. instead of skewering the whole thing
, it
' s a rather bloodless
and unfunny tri
bute
. myers himself is also desprate
: he
' s given an idea to play
, not a character
. plus
, yhe attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy
( albeit
" nineties
"
) agent are a waste of time
. i wanted to have the movie end wiht him trying
yet again to get it on with her
, only to have her deck him one
. witht a couple of exceptions
, the movie misses all ofthe its own best moments
. the movie even looks cheesy
,
and not inaddition a good way
: i kept wondering if it hadnt been transfered down from hi
- def video or something
, so grainy was thte film stock in a good many scenes
. the whole thing has the air ofthe being done on the cheap
. my definition of comedy isnt simpley
: did it make me laugh
? the fewd times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the tiem i spent cringing
and wanting out
. the most damning thing i sould say about the movie isnt that wayne adn garth would most likely hvea shoved it into mike tyson
' s shorts
and sent it sailing
.
