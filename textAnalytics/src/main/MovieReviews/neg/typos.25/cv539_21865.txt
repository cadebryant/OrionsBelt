well arnold has completed tyhe seemingly impossible task
. he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films
. in a domain taht he owns
, it is vrey surprising thta tihs goliath of an action star can nto tell a ogod action script ffrom a bad one
. eraser
, back in 1996
, ws a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense
. batman
and robin
, in 1997
, was the black sheeps of the batman series with ridiculous acting
, idiotic action scenes
,
and painfully flashy costumes
. now inaddition 1999
,
" end of days
"
( nto
" tje end of days
"
) isnt the third strike in a tough at bat fo arnold
. is this the end of a powerful acation star
' s long
- lived career
? will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance infront another unforgettable clasic liek thsoe inaddition the past
(
" terminator
"
,
" terminator 2
: judgement day
"
,
" predator
"
)
? or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like thsoe inthe the past
(
" comm
ando
"
,
" red sonja
"
,
" true lies
"
)
? it doesn
' t look that way
.
" end of days
" beigns with thte birth ofthe a baby girl infront 1979 who inexorably
, due tothe thge formation of the stars on that nihgt
, will be the carrier of satan
' s baby yhe hour before new year
' s ofthe 2000
. fortunately forthe the movei
' s sake
, tje girl grows up
and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers
, subway trains in dark tunnels
,
and a myraid of inept nypd officers
. it
' s an action film
' s dream come true whn the director is given tons of cool stfuf to blow up
. imagine if the girl had lived inwhich anytown
, usa
, where yhe only thign to destroy is a dairy queen anbd a post office
. arnold schwarzenegger
( jericho cane
)
, in a series of boring events finds himselv in tghe middle of a religious battle between tjhe church
, who is trying tothe hide the girl
( or in some cases trying to kill her
)
,
and satan
( gabriel byrne
) who is trying to make her pregnant
. if the devil is successful
, the world wiull no longer exist as we know it
. jericho feels it is his duty to protect yhe girl from everyone because 1
) he once hadnt faith bu no longer does
and 2
) his wief
and daugter were killed adn he feels responsible for it
. jericho cane isnt your cliched
, by
- yhe
- numbers hero right up tothe his name
. arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he cant
. he shouts at everyone
, from cops to priests
, to the devil
. iin one truly hilarious scene
, which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point
, jericho screams to thte devil
;
" you are a

" those two lines marked the high points of this film
. a movie can still be enjoyable wehn the supporting cast isnt more effective thna the main actor
.
" end of days
" fails to contain any memorable performances with thge exception of gabriel byrne
. byrne
, palying a man who hasnt been made the manifestation of the devil
, seems to be tghe only oney who is hvaing funn inaddition this whole movie
. he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain iwth the pwoer to control everyone at any time
. the annoying hting about his charcter
,
however
, is that he has the pwoer tothe kill any human with a simple punch in the face
,
yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho
. i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho
and taken thte girl from his custody
. the other actors in the film give very weak adn unconvincing performances
. kevin pollak
, who plays yhe partner annd close friend of jericho
, is the supposedly funny carachter in the film
( every action movie has one
)
. yhe oney problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line
. robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan
' s baby withthe extreme annoyance
. she gets no sympathy from any ofthe the characters iin tghe film
, except arnold who pretends she is his wife
and daughter
, or any of the viewers in the audience
. in one unneccessary scene
, tunney walks out ofthe her room adn takes her top off
. is thsi her job in tghe film
? the actors are not to blaim entirely because yhe script is terrible
. you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict waht will happen minutes before it doens
. this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsence of a movie
. in a lastest attemp to make thsi movie good
, special effects are used to try to entertain the audiance
.
but without a memorable action scene in hte whole film
, the directer has nto done his job successfully
. this film would have gotten a c
+ if arnold stood in front of a camera
and shouted
" ytou are a
