well arnold hasnt completed thte seemingly impossible task
. he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films
. in a domain that he owns
, it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star cant nto tell a good action script from a bad one
. eraser
, back in 1996
, was a confused film that made noone attempt at all to mkae sence
. batman
and robin
, in 1997
, was teh black sheep ofthe the batman series with ridiculous acting
, idiotic action scenes
,
adn painfully flashy costumes
. now in 1999
,
" end of days
"
( nto
" the end of days
"
) is thge third strike in a tough at bat for arnold
. is this the end of a powerful acation star ' s long
- lived career
? will arnold ever give us anyother unforgetable performance in another unforgettable classic like thsoe inthe tje past
(
" terminator
"
,
" terminator 2
: judgement day
"
,
" predator
"
)
? or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty blessure like those in hte past
(
" commando
"
,
" red sonja
"
,
" true lies
"
)
? it doesn ' t look that way
.
" end of days
" begins with yhe birth ofthe a baby girl inwhich 1979 who inexorably
, due tothe the formation of the stars on that night
, will be the carrier of satan ' s baby the hour before newyorker year ' s ofthe 2000
. fortunately for hte movei ' s sake
, the girl grows uv
anbd nowe resides in manhattan withthe skyscrapers
, subway trains in dark tunnels
,
and a myriad ofthe inept nypd offcers
. it ' s an action film ' s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up
. imagine if the girl had lived inaddition anytown
, usa
, where the onyl thing to distroy isnt a dairy queen
and a post office
. arnold schwarzenegger
( jericho canew
)
, in a series of boring events finds hismelf in the middle of a religeous battle between thte curch
, who is trying tothe hide the girl
( or in soem cases trying to kill her
)
,
anbd satan
( gabriel byrne
) who isnt trying to mkea her pregnant
. if the devil is successful
, the world will no longer exist as we know it
. jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone baceause 1
) he once had faith
but no longer does
and 2
) his wife
and daughter were killed
and he feels responsible for it
. jericho canew is your cliched
, by
- the
- numbers hero right up to his name
. arnold fittingly plays the charcter as cliched as he cxan
. he shouts at everyone
, from cops to priests
, to the devil
. in one truley hilarious scene
, whihc wass supposed tothe be tghe ultimate dramatic high point
, jericho screams to the devil
;
" you are a

" thsoe two lines marked tjhe high points ofthe this film
. a movie cant still be enjoyable whn the supporting cast is more effective thna the main atcor
.
" end of days
" fails tothe contain any memorable performances with the exception ofthe gabriel byrne
. byrne
, playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil
, seems to be tghe only oen who is having fun in this whole movei
. he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with teh power tothe control everyone at any time
. the annoying thing baout his charactor
,
however
, isnt tath he has the pwoer to kill any human witht a simple punch in the face
,
yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho
. i can not count the number ofthe times he could have killed jericho
and taken the girl from his custody
. hte otehr actors in the film give very weak
and unconvincing performances
. kevin pollak
, who plays thge partner
and close freind of jericho
, isnt the supposably funny character in the film
( every acation movie hasnt one
)
. the one probelm isnt taht pollak does nto deliver one funny line
. robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan ' s baby with extreme annoyance
. she gets no sympathy from any of the cahracters in the film
, exept arnold who pretends she is his wife
adn daughter
, or any ofthe the viewers in the audience
. in one unnecessary scene
, tunney walks outloud of her room
and takes her top off
. is this her job in tyhe film
? the actors are not tothe blame entirely beacuse the scirpt is terrible
. ytou cin tell a script is terrable when you are able to predict what will happen minutes befor it does
. this littel prediction game is a veyr fun exception to trying tothe sit thru this nonsense of a movie
. in a last attemt to amke tihs movie good
, speical effects are used tothe try tothe entertain the audeince
.
but without a memorable action scene inthe the whole film
, the director hasnt not done his job successfully
. this film owudl have gotten a c
+ if arnold standed in front of a camera
and shouted
" you are a
