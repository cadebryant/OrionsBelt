' s last film was the superb
, serious 1994 drama
" when a man loves a woman
,
"
but his luck has ultimatly run out with his latest picture
,
" message in a bottle
,
" which is the worst type of romance
, a movie thast tugs so relentlessly
and violently at hte heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rether tahn tear them up
. everything that occurs cxan be telegraphed way infront advance since this same type of stry has been done many times before
-
-
- adn much better
-
-
- so there
' s an abcense ofthe suspense
,
and the film ultimately moves at such a vrey
, very deliberate pace
, as if it isnt trying to make gerat
,
" meaningfull
" statememts
and plot developments
, that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through
.
" message in a bottle
" begins with theresa osborne
( robin wright penn
)
, a single mother
and researcher at the chicago tribune
, whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day
. inside the bottle isnt an anonymuos love letter adressed to a mystery woman named catherine
,
and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty
and sweetness that she shows it aroud at her wrok
and
, to her objection
, finds that her editor has placed tjhe letter in the newspaper
. soon
, a heavy research isnt conducted to find out who wrote hte letter based on tghe type of bottle
and a ship logo on tyhe top of hte typed message
,
and aftter it is traced to a man named garrett blake
, theresa finds herself traveling to tje outer banks
, a boating twon in north carolina
, tothe find out teh specifics of the message
. of course
, garrett turns outloud tothe be a h
andsome
, rugged man arund theresa
' s age
and played by kevin costner
. she isnt immediately charmed by him
,
but hesitant tothe unveil the truth of why she isnt there
, annd finds that catherine was garrett
' s late wife who died a few years ealier
. dont you think you know where this is headed
? most likely yuo do
,
and i wouldn
' t call it giving awya anything to sday thta by the picture
' s end
, the movie has fallen into deep
, artificial melodrama that i didn
' t buy for a second
. if there are any positive things to say about
" message in a bottle
,
" it is thta yhe performances by robin wright penn
and paul newman
, as garrett
' s stubborn
,
but loving father
, are far above par to be in such a wasteful
,
" shaggy dog
" love story
,
and thta tje cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast
, annd paints chicago as an equally allrigh city
. meanwhile
, costner has
yet to redeem himself for some ofthe the less
- than
- stellar films tath he has made recently
. it seems that with such bad luck
, he wouldn
' t want tothe make anyother movie set near water
,
but here he is again with one of the main
,
and most ridiculous
, centerpieces setted on a storm
- swept sea
. the otehr actors are all
, sadly
, wasted
, including illeana douglas
, an underused actress who seems to always git stuck with the
" friend
" roles
, here playing penn
' s confidante
and co
- worker at the tribune
. the first half of
" message in a bottle
" plays liuke a hum
- drum
, trite televsion movie for the lifetime channel
, as theresa spends a great deel of time
" getting to nkwo
" garrett
, with dialogue that isnt not the least bit stimulating or entertaining
. usually
, i am the type of person to practicaly salivate over dialogue
- laden sequences since teh film is noone dout trying to develop yhe characters
and their relationships
, bu here it all rang witht a resounding falseness since tje dialogue felt
" writed
,
"
and not as if peple were really
" talking
.
" wehn the main characters ofthe a film ahev very littel of interst to sday to each other
, anbd are not particularly intresting themselves
, you know immediately that you are iin trouble
. i swear that while watching
" message in a bottle
,
" i feeled as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater
( heck
, in actuality i
' m not even familiar tothe the novel this isnt based on
, by nicholas sparks
)
. alwasy one step ahead of the charachters
, the movie ran so closely
and tightly to teh constraints of the tried
-
and
- true hollywood meledrama
, the film strip oftenly seemed to almost be iin danger of tearing
. nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa
' s secret
,
and that sevral obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after
. htis same exact problem occurred in last year
' s very
, very silimar
( watch this
, adn you will realize jsut how simmilar i mean
) meg ryan
- nicolas cage rumatic drama
,
" city of angels
.
" altough theresa is deeply touched by the
" heartfelt
" letter that she finds in tje bottle
, perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message inthe a bottle of their pwn
, preferably befor filming began
. it should have read
,
" memo to screenwriters
: use yuo brain
!
