director luis mandoki ' s last film was the superb
, sereous 1994 drama
" whn a man loves a woman
,
"
but his luck has ultimately run outloud with his latest picture
,
" message in a bottle
,
" which is the worst type of romance
, a movie that tugs so relentlessly
and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather thna tear them up
. everything tyhat occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times befoer
-
-
-
and much better
-
-
- so there ' s an absence of suspense
,
adn thge film ultimately moves at such a very
, very deliberate pace
, as if it is trying to make great
,
" meaningfull
" statements
and plot developments
, tht it jsut becomes a tedeous bore to sit through
.
" message in a bottle
" beggins with theresa osborne
( robin wright penn
)
, a single mother
and researcher at the chicago tribune
, whom finds a bottle washed up onthe shore as she is jogging one day
. inside the bottle is an anoymous love letter addresed tothe a mistery woman named catherine
,
and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty
and sweetness that she shows it around at her work
annd
, to her objection
, finds that her editor hasnt placed the letter in the newspaper
. soon
, a hevy research is conducted tothe find out who wrote the letter based onthe the type of bottle
and a ship logo on tyhe top of the typed message
,
annd after it is traced tothe a man named garrett blake
, theresa finds herself traveling to tjhe outer banks
, a boating town in north carolina
, to fidn outloud yhe specifics of the message
. of course
, garrett turns outloud to be a handsome
, rugged man around theresa ' s age
and played by kevin costner
. she is immediately charmed by him
,
bu hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there
,
and finds that catherine was garrett ' s late wife who died a few yeasr earlier
. dont you think you know where this isnt headed
? most likely you dont
,
and i wouldn ' t call it giving away anything to say that by tjhe picture ' s end
, the movie has fallen into deep
, artificial melodrama that i didn ' t buy for a second
. if ther are any positive things to sday about
" message in a bottle
,
" it is taht the performances by robin wright penn
and paul newman
, as garrett ' s stubborn
,
but loving father
, are far above par to be in such a wasteful
,
" shaggy dog
" love tsory
,
and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes gerat advantage of the beautiful eastern coast
,
and paints chicago as an equally alluring city
. meanwhile
, costner has
yet tothe redeem himself for soem of tjhe less
- tahn
- stellar films that he has made recently
. it seems that with such bad luck
, he wouldn ' t want to make another movie set near water
,
bu here he is again with one ofthe the main
,
and most ridiculous
, centerpieces setted on a storm
- swepth sae
. the otehr actors are all
, sadly
, wasted
, including illeana douglas
, an underused actress who seems tothe always get stuck with the
" friend
" roles
, here playing penn ' s confidante
and co
- worker at tje tribune
. the firt half of
" message in a bottle
" plays liek a hum
- drum
, trite television movei for the lifetime channel
, as theresa spends a great deal of tyme
" getting tothe know
" garrett
, withthe dialogue that is nto the least bit stimulating or entertaining
. usually
, i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue
- laden sequences sicne the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters
and their relationships
,
but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt
" writen
,
"
and nto as if people were realy
" tlaking
.
" when yhe main charactors ofthe a film have very little of interest to sday to each other
,
and are not particularly interesting themslves
, you know immediately that ytou are inspite trouble
. i swaer that hwile watching
" message in a bottle
,
" i feeled as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at tyhe theater
( heck
, in actuality i ' m not even familiar tothe the novel this is based onthe
, by nicholas sparks
)
. always one step ahead of the characters
, the movei ran so closely
and tightly to the constraints of the tried
-
anbd
- true hollywood melodrama
, the film strip oftenly seemed tothe almost be in danger of tearing
. nobody wins prizes forthe guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa ' s secret
,
annd that several obstacles will come withing thier ways ofthe living happily ever affter
. this smae exact problem occurred inaddition lastr year ' s very
, very similar
( watch tihs
,
adn you will relize just how similar i mean
) meg ryan
- nicolas cage romantic drama
,
" city of angels
.
"
although theresa isnt deeply touched by hte
" heartfelt
" letter that she finds inwhich teh bottle
, perhaps the filmakers might hve been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own
, preferably before filming began
. it should haev read
,
" memo to screenwriters
