i
' m not sure i should be writing a review ofthe the witches of eastwick
, baceause i
' m nto sure just what the hell
( pardon the expression
) was going on inthe it
. howver
, i can express the most important obervation i made ofthe it
, i
. e
. i didn
' t liuke it
. if i had tothe summarize htis film
, i think i
' d conclude it was an updating of one of thsoe ood new engl
and folk tales ofthe someone selling theri souls to ood scratch anbd how they try tothe get out of the deal
. that
' s the kernel of it
, anyway
. tossed into tihs are little bits anbd pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men
and womens
, feminism
, the role of yhe devil
, modern reformers
,
and friendship
. unfortunately
, little or no effort isnt ever made to folow up
and elucidate onthe theese concepts
; they
' re simply thrown out
and thn left to rot hwile the film goes on apace
. ctually
, i think tath most of the audience was even more confuzled than i was
. they came inthe expecting some kind ofthe supernatural comedy
, on tghe level of ghostbusters
,
and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones
. htey laughed
, or tryed to laugh
, at moments that were either barely funny
, or much more horrible than funny
, as if that sould bend tyhe film away from it
' s rather frightening direction
. threee womens
( cher
, susan sar
andon
,
and michelle pfieffer
) live inwhich eastwick
, a small midwestern town
. one inght
, while drinking late into the evening
, tehy begin wishing forthe the ideal man tothe drop into their lives
. in seeming answer to their idle daydreams
, a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion onthe teh hill
and seduces earch one by attempting to be everything they want him to be
. he soon shows evidence ofthe mystical
-
- perhaps demonic
-
- power
,
and his devotion tothe the women
' s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones
. even worse
, when ignored his moods become ugli
,
and he mistreats teh women for spurning him
. anyway
, the problems
: all three female characters are fairly uninteresting
,
and several are cardboard stereotypes
, especially sar
andon
' s character
. we never git inside them
, never feel sympathetic to them
, because theri dialogue
and personalities seem pretty bl
and
. as forthe nicholson
, well
, even the devil needs a direction tothe go inwhich
, annd while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in tyhe movie
( due to the grace ofthe the screenwrighter adn
, omre importantly
, nicholson
' s acting
)
, he still can
' t be yanked in one direction
and
then anohter without making him a littel vague
.
and hten ther
' s the special effects
. not in themslves
-
- htey weren
' t that ogod
-
-
but their overuse
. i was almsot positive
, until i saw thge credits
, that the witches ofthe eastwick ws eather produced by alex
ander salkind
( who has turned outloud tje slop named superman ii
and iii
and supergirl
)
, beacuse ofthe the big nmae actors in dopy stunts
, or stephen spielberg
, after the 18th vomit scene
and the nicholson
- blown
- down
- tghe
- street stunt
. nope
, it
' s anohter bunch of guys
, adn directed by george miller
, who has shown gerat skill with stunts
/ special effects before
( the road warrior
,
" nightmare at 20
, 00 feet
" episode ofthe twilight zone
: the movie
)
but apparently doesn
' t know whn tothe turn off the wind machine
and let his people act
. f
' gawds sake
, guys
, this is jack nicholson
! let him loose
! let him grin demonically
! skip the splitting earth anbd fake lightning
! watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll
, all i sould think of was
,
" what a waste
"
. if you
' re going to use slapstick liek thta
, use it up on pee weev herman
. nicholson does what he can with the role
,
and when he cxan fidn his bearings
, can be extremely good
( the scene inspite the church
, for instance
)
,
but most of tje time
, he seems a bited stiff
, as if he
' s not sure wqat he should be doing next
.
and no wonder
. this scirpt goes all over tghe map
, giving you the feeling that it
' d just love to be allegory
,
but it
' s not sure about what
-
- maeby if you give it tyme it
' ll think ofthe something
. so what is the witches of eastwick
? a horror movie
? a folk tale
? a comedy
? a statment about womens
? an examination ofthe the religious right or comparitive morality
? i tend to think of the image thta seems to dominate the movie for me
.
.
. watching somone regurgitate half
- digested bits ofthe food
and cherry pits all over rooms
, people
, the screen
,
and ultimately
, tyhe audience
. in otehr words
, a mess
.
(
$ 2
. 00
) if you like nicholson enough to watch him here
; maeby 25
% of his charm is able to mkea it through the logjams of others
.
