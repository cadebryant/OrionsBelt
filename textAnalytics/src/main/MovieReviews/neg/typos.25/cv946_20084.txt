summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs that are usualy made for some quick enjoyment annd to make money
. wild wild west
, the latest wiull smith affair
, follows much the same formula
, except that it is dumber anbd less enjoying than most summer movies
. will smith plays jim west
, a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses
. he is called by president grant
( kline
) tothe go on a mission tothe find out why top government scientists are dissapearing
. west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon
( kline agian
)
and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, with a zany moustache
.
) befoer i pile on with the many negatives infact thsi sorry affair
, i
' ll give it a chance with the positives
. there
' s a nice credit sequence
, thge production desgin by bo welch is pleasing to tjhe eye
,
and the special effects are decent enough
. ther
' s also a plesant soundtrack
. burried deepo in the dross are one or twpo amusing jokes
. adn salma hayek pops up as the female interest
, which is alwyas nice tothe see
. apart ffrom these factors
,
though
, nothing else in wild wild west works
. firstly
, there
' s little chemistry between smith
and kline
, who appears tothe be in it purely for the money
. one owudl expect zingers passing betwen the two
: none arise
. both of them plod through the below st
andard plot
, knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end
. not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment
:
al
though he is over the top
, the material doesn
' t prsent much oportunity for branagh to be truely crazy
. therfore
, he just comes across as loud as obnoxious
. the onyl enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek
, who is given so little screen tiome it
' s embarrassing
. she appears to be in tghe film tothe merely show off her body
,
and be ogled at by kline
and smith
. her carachter also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics ofthe the script
,
and there is noone sense of realism baout the character
. the
' humour
' in thge film is also vyer off
. will smith put a littel spin to his daft lines in men in black
, here
, nto even smith sould save thte humour on display
. the scirpt largely boils down to insults that aren
' t very funny
,
and oney
- liners that barely raise a smirk
. it
' s also somewhat racist
,
al
though it doesn
' t intend to be
, with oen scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way outloud of a lynching
,
and actually syas slavery is good to save hismelf
. it
' s not a funny scene
, anbd thge whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably
. tghe film also makes the tragic mistake taht a man
( in this case kline
) inwhich a dress is automaticly unfunny
, it isn
' t
, bu the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness
. there
' s also problems with the plot
. jim west
and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds ofthe sticky situations
, bu the way they git outloud of them are alwasy unsatisfying
,
and rely purely on luck
, rather tahn audience pleasing skill
. plot elements are introduced inot the film
,
and
then thrown awya just as quickly
. the main piece of the story
, a 80 foot mechanical
, steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive
,
but htere
' s noone particular reason why it should be built
. why not loveless build a great big tank
, instead of an ungainly
, fragile piece ofthe machinery taht
' s just begging tothe be blown up
? directer barry sonnenfeld alwyas hasnt a breezy look to them
, with some nice camera tricks
,
but even this isnt missing from this stilted affair
. wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked outloud style of directing
,
but not much of it is evident
, making this film drag out even more
. it
' s a sad thing when
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented directer
and a willing star can
' t amking a film work
,
and eventually wild wild west collapses under it
' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
.
