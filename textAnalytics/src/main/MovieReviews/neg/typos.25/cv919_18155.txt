but
, it wasn

ander ii
. infront this decade christopher lambert bacame associated with films with low budgets anbd even lower quality
. very often such films weere science fiction
, which meant that the fans of tath genre learned the hard way what tothe evade anytying starring christopher lambert
. whether it was because ofthe real lack of talent
, terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn
' t important
- the end result ws almost alwasy horrible
. the smae can be said fo fortress
, 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon
, director who creaeted cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator
and from beyond
. the movie is set in 2018

, baceause tyhe warden poe
( kurtwood smith
) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen
. after rather intriguing beginning
and some intresting special effects that depict the futuristic settings ofthe prision
, tihs film soon starts sinking inot mediocrity
. the reason is inwhich the screenplay taht quickly degenerates into wohle series ofthe prison movei clich
? s
and situations that are painfully predictable
. by tghe time brennick begins his excape ffrom fortress
, those situations not only beign tothe look predictable
,
but utterly implausible too
. of course
, film never tryed tothe explane why the country tyhat lacks resources to suppost its presetn populaion happens to spend bucketloads of money onthe ultra
- expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless
and dangerous members ofthe the society
. tjhe intially interesting plot isnt done even more wrong by stereotyped characters
, palyed by nto too interested or talented actors
. lori laughlin
,
al
though physically attractive
, shows the acting abillity ofthe sequoia
. kurtwood smith as prison warden isnt rather uninspired
, capable of solid
, yot forgettable performance
. lambert
' s performance is also good
,
but even thte bigger talent couldn
' t help this film
, destined to end in oblivion
