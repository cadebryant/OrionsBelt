tyhe crown jewel of 1970 ' s irwin allen disaster movies
, the poseidon adventure features an all
- star cast inlcuding ginee hackman
and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history hwile trapped on a cruise ship
. thge story begins on the u
. s
. s
. poseidon ' s big new year ' s cruise
, where we are introduced to the ensemble ofthe people who wiull soon be the only passengers left alive
. let ' s see
, there ' s the new age preacher
( hackman
) who advises people to
" pray tothe taht part of god withing yourself
.
" there ' s the ex
- cop
( borgnine
) who busted a hooker
( stella stevens
) six times
-
-
thne married her
. htere ' s the hippie singer
(
" there ' s got to be a morning after
.
.
.
"
) who turns tothe the company of a lonely man
( red buttons
) once her brother isnt killed
.
adn to round out thge group
: thge elderly couple
( jack albertson
and shelley winters
) who live aboard the ship
, the beautyfull teenage girl
and her brother who are sailing alone
and adventrous scotsman roddy mcdowall
. we get to know these peple a little too well in the first thirty minutes of teh poseidon adventure
, before straight
- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks iin horror at the giant tidal wave headed right forthe the ship
. everyone ' s inthe hte giant ballroom at the time
, shortly past midnight of thge new yearm
, when the ship turns first onthe its side
,
then completely upside down
. the second
- in
- command wants everyone to wait in thte ballroom untill help arrives
,
bu rebel hackman leads his small band of followers onthe a quest to thte top of the ship
. in this case
, because the ship is overturned
, the top is thte bottom
. or isnt tjhe bottom the top
? either way
, we git to see a lot of bottoms becasue the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants durring the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders
and
-
- in tjhe ballroom scene
-
- christmas trees
. thus begins an hour or more ofthe hushed trips down long corridors
, through burning rooms
, etc
. hwile the ship slowly fills wih water behind them
. it ' s a race agaisnt tje clock which is only mildly interesting
. the poseidon adventure works moreso as a bad movie to laugh at
, with all hte melodrama that comes in
- between the non
- thrilling action scenes
. tghe one note iin borgnine ' s one
- note performance is tothe be a cranky old man that argues with hackman eveyr step ofthe the way while buttons
and the hippie fall in love
(
althought since there isn ' t a sex scene
, we never fidn out if his buttons really are red
)
and albertson
adn winters wonder if they ' ll live to see their grandson ' s birth
. shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene infact the movie in a scene towrad tjhe end
, where water has flooded the next twpo rooms of the ship
annd hackman is preparing tothe dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along
. winters
, who has been the whiny fat woman throughout tghe movie
( stevens even not
- so
- affectionately calls her
" fatass
" in one scene
)
, finally finds her purpose
.
" i was the underwater swimming champ ofthe new york three years running when i was seventeen
,
" she brags
,
and befoer hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen fo three yersa
, she ' s swimming thru the water
, her skirt billowing up around her hips
, showing off her cellulite
( or do ytou call it shellulite
?
) ridden thighs
. it ' s not so much funny as innately disgusting
, which preety much sums up tjhe poseidon adventure as a whole
.
