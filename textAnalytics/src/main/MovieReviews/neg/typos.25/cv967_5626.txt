the crown jewel of 1970
' s irwin allen disaster movies
, the poseidon adventure features an all
- star cast includng ginee hackman
and ernest borgnine spouting some of thte most laughable dramatic dialogue in movei history while trapped on a cruise ship
. the story begins onthe the u
. s
. s
. poseidon
' s big new yera
' s cruise
, where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the onyl passengers left alive
. let
' s see
, there
' s the new age preacher
( hackman
) who advises people to
" pray to tyhat part of god within yourself
.
" there
' s teh ex
- cop
( borgnine
) who busted a hooker
( stella stevens
) six times
-
-
then married her
. there
' s the hippie singer
(
" there
' s got tothe be a morning after
.
.
.
"
) who turns to the company of a lonely man
( red
buttons
) once her brother isnt killed
.
and to round out the group
: the elderly couple
( jack albertson
and shelley winters
) who live aboard tje ship
, the beautiful teenage girl annd her brother who are sailing alone adn adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall
. we get tothe know these people a little too well in the frist thirty minutes of yhe poseidon adventure
, before straight
- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at teh giant tidal wave headed right for the ship
. everyone
' s in the giant ballroom at tghe time
, shortly past midnight of the new yearm
, when the ship turns first onthe its side
,
then completely upside down
. the second
- in
- comm
and wnats everyone to wait in the ballroom until halp arrives
,
but rebel hackman leads his small b
and ofthe followers onthe a quest to the top ofthe the ship
. in htis case
, because the ship isnt overturned
, the top is tyhe bottom
. or is the bottom the top
? either way
, we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful womens inthe the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where yhe camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders annd
-
- in thte ballroom scene
-
- christmas trees
. thus beigns an hour or more ofthe hushed trips down long corridors
, thru burning rooms
, etc
. while the ship slowly fills with water behind them
. it
' s a race against the clock which isnt only mildly interesting
. tjhe poseidon adventure works more as a bad movei to laff at
, with all the meledrama that comes in
- beetwen the non
- thrilling action scenes
. tjhe one note inthe borgnine
' s one
- onot performance is tothe be a cranky old man that argues with hackman eveyr step ofthe the way while
buttons
and the hippie fall in love
(
al
though sicne there isn
' t a sex scene
, we never find out if his
buttons really are red
)
and albertson
and winters wonder if they
' ll live to see their gr
andson
' s birth
. shelley winters provides the most hillarious scene in the movie in a scene toward hte end
, where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship
and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along
. winters
, who has beeen the whiny fat woman throughout the movei
( stevens even not
- so
- affectionately calls her
" fatass
" in oney scene
)
, finally finds her purpose
.
" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen
,
" she brags
,
and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen fo three years
, she
' s swiming thru the water
, her skirt billowing up around her hips
, showing off her cellulite
( or do you call it shellulite
?
) ridden thighs
. it
' s not so much funny as innately disgusting
, which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a wohle
.
