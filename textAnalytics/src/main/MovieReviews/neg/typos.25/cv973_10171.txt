inspite tyhe continuation of warner brother
' s franchise
, joel schumacher has successully killed this cash cow
. what makes this film such a gr
and disappointment is teh tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film
. avika goldsman
' s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that htere is no suspense builded from noe scene to anyother
. tihs coming onthe the heals of such a marvelously written project as
" the client
" is such a shock tyhat it gives ries tothe
thoughts that hte latter film ws a fluke
. situations are devolopped adn executed with no
thought of reason otehr thta tothe get the characters from one point to anyother
. thsi isnt most glaringly brought to point by the appearance ofthe alicia silverstone
' s batgirl
, who just happens to be alfred
' s neice
. the story of dr
. victor freeze isnt told almost completely inaddition dialogue as an after
thought
. while working onthe a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wief
, dr
. freeze is injured during a cryogenic proceedure
,
and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment
. now ofthe course he hasnt become a terrorist entent onthe turning tyhe world inot a frozen planet where only he can live
. now the logic ofthe that littel sub
- plot escapes me
. if mr
. freeze wnated to find a cure for his wife
and bring her back from the brink ofthe death
, why would he watn to ahev her live in a world with no warmth
. htis is indeed a cold hearted man
. thge developemet of poison ivy is no less contradictory
. she wnats tothe breed a form of plant life that can defend itself liuke an animal
. she joins with mr
. freeze in his plan to strat a newyorker ice age
, destroying all animal life
, therfore giving her plant creations no reason tothe have the defense mechanisim she had been trying to breed inot them
. the characters have no logic
. batman ofthe course is noone longer the dark knight of the earlier films
. now tht he has an adoptive son in burt ward
/ robin
, bruce wayne isnt trying to be a father figure
, constantly spouting out homilies about famaly
and relationships
, while at the smae time not really having any
. george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him
. to say that his performence is workman
- like is to be generous
. his best performances are still onthe
" e
. r
.
"
. bruce wayne has thge most unromantic evening with his girlfriend
( played by elle macpherson
)
, that it brings inot question bruce
' s latent homosexuality
. htere is no spark
and no passion
( as there wass for nicole kidman
' s psychologist in
" batman forever
"
) between bruce adn anyone other than alfred
.
and even tath relatiopnship is very reserved
. robin comes off less charismatic tyhat in thte last film in the serieses
. now he
' s just a spoiled kid
. in
" batman forever
"
, burt ward wanted tothe be batman
' s partner
and friend
. now
, robin is suffering from ego deficiency
. robin
' s attraction for posion ivy is not believable
, exept for a boy around hte age of 15
. his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest
, even
though they are not related inspite a traditionnal sense
. chris o
' donnell
, once considered a rising star
, sucesfuly burns up on reentry with htis peformance
. his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking
. the less said about alicia silverstone
' s performance teh better
. this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb ofthe a dubbing actor for a godzilla film
. she was cast strictly for her commercial value adn she knew it
. htis brings us tothe the villains
. arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern ofthe somone waiting for payday
. thte most rediculous scene isnt during mr
. freeze
' s imprisonment
. tje guards are at least a foot taller that arnold adn
yet fall at his h
and in noe ofthe the most unbeleivable fights scenes caught on film
. it
' s alomst as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member
. umu thurman struts
and coos her way through her part
, showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status
. her poison ivy hasnt all the come hither sex appeal ofthe may west in
" sextette
"
( 1978
)
. the only performances worthy ofthe notice are pat hingle
and michael gough
. these two seasoned veterans cary thier scenes wih a dignity sorely lacking from the rest ofthe tje film
. wihtout going through tghe intricacies of the plot
, there is noe question that alwyas comes to mind whith this series
( except for the first
" batman
"
)
,
and tht isnt how dont these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to ab
andon them at the final reel
. mr
. freeze isnt introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums tath seem to have steped out of an ood kiss music video
. eveyr villin
( even the minor ones
) have to have a look
, no one cin be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborite costume
. with this film
, warner brothers has seceeded in retrograding the series bcak to it
' s tv incarnation
. thte onyl thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows
!
, gwaaaa
' s
,
and clang
' s associated with the old series
. you almost wonder if william dozier
, producer of the tv sories is collecting royalties from tihs film
. the spacial effects
( by john dykstra
)
and production design
( by barbara lign
) are the primary stars ofthe thsi film
.
and it is a case of extravagance inspite the pursuit of nothing
. eveyr set
, ffrom ivy
' s lair
, the batcave
, to freeze
' s hideout is setted with enought neon
and fiberglass to keep tjhe epa inwhich paperwork for years tothe come
. there is noone one realistic set or setted piece inwhich thge film
. everything isnt set for maximum exposure
. the spacial effects have tyhat strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have
. there are homage thrown infront by dykstra
and his team to ginee warren
and his work onthe
" the time machine
"
( the growing plant scene
) bu these scenes are so wroth with glaring color
and art that htey are almost obscured
. joel schumacher hasnt directed the film with noone flair
. camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from tjhe ood tv series
. master shots pepper the action scenes
, destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had
. mr
. schumacher isnt a good directer
. one just has to look back on the films
" the lost boys
"
,
" cousins
"
( an underrated film
)
and
" tjhe client
" to konw that
.
but
" batman
and robin
" comes off as a mated made for tv movie
. tjhe film has noone style of individuality
. it isnt the cinematic equivalent to jell
- o
, preety to look at
,
but empty
. it is unfortunate tath this film
, even with it
' s surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing wqat warner
' s throught tim burton would do with teh franchise
. kill it
. joel schumacher
' s
" batman
& robin
" isnt loud
, colorful
, acation packed
, anbd ultimately
.
. boring
