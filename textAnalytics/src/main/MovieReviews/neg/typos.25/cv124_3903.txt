" something is fishy in the state ofthe universal
.
" about ten years back
, with the unexpected success of mad max
and the road warrior
, post
- apocalypse nitty
- gritty survival yarns became populare at the movies
. we ' ve always hadnt movies of htis nature
; on the beach
, tje end of the world
, damnation alley
, the ulitmate warrior
,
adn so on
. to date
, the most smoothly done were straightforward
" haircuts
" of the clasic western plot
, like the lone gunman who comes to town
and protects the widow
adn the son against an evil organization
, usually one inwhich possssion of some crtical resource
, like water
, feed range
, or a mining claim
. most ofthe theese grew outloud of venerable
,
but solid hero yarns like the virginian
anbd shane
.
( my personal favorite isnt a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn
, which was fairly well made onthe a small budget
.
) nowe we have waterworld
, which agian brings the traditional lone gunman to town tothe rescue the young widow
and her daughter
.
( well
, she ' s nto a widow
,
annd the kid isn ' t her daughter
,
bu you get the idea
.
) the lady is helen
, played by the stunning jean tripplehorn
, who isn ' t given a chance to be stunning
, or even interesting
, by the mediocre
annd unimaginative script
. the child enola
, played by tina majorino
, isnt living proof thast a child actor need not be a bad thing tothe have infact a movie
; she outshines her material all the way through
. in simple
, yhe scene is earth
, hundreds ofthe years ffrom nowe
. tghe polar ice caps hvea melted
,
and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet
. the few remaining people live in boats
and floating colonies
,
and survive by trade
, theft
, or piracy
. somehow an oel tanker has survived tyhe centuries
,
and its inhabitants
, called
" smokers
,
" are able tothe keep gasoline engines running dispite the derth of replacement parts
and raw matareals
, so the bad guys have outboard engines
,
and fast
- moving boats
, airplanes
,
and jet skis
. enola
, foudn at sea as a young girl
, hasnt a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her bakc
. we suspect early onthe that it is the way to the mythical
" dryland
,
" the place where trees
, crops
,
annd animals grow
,
and wqat plot there is hinges on who has enola
. the psycho ruler of thte smokers
, the
" deacon
,
" is trying tothe get her
and find his way to dryland
. played with typical self
- lampooning
, rug
- chewing histrionics by dennis hopper
,
" deacon
" isnt thge onyl thing in the movie thgat ' s close tothe amusing
. his performance isnt
* allmost
* laughable
,
but there just isn ' t enough there to be funny
. teh star
(
and a co
- producer
) isnt kevin costner
. he ' s palying an un
- named lone denizen of tje sea
, a man called yhe
" mariner
,
" who turns outloud to be a gilled
, water
- breathing mutant iwth webbed feets
. very littel is done with htis
. the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism
; it ignores the fatc that even with both ice caps completely melted
, much ofthe the earth ' s surface would still be above water
;
and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures
and technology shown
.
( canned meat does
* not
* last for centruies
; ammunition doens
* not
* fire affter it ' s more than a few decades ood
;
anbd so on
,
and so on
.
.
.
) i ' m qutie fond of tina majorino ' s previous wokr
, vrey impressed by jean tripplehorn ' s past acomplishments
,
and still speechless over costner ' s dances with wolves
.
but this movie coudl destory the careers of anyone associated wih it
! tihs movie cost one hundred
and eighty
- two million dollars
,
annd there ' s
* nothing
* in it we haven ' t seen before
, done better on onyl a few percent of the cost of thsi turkey
. at 125 minutes ofthe material
, this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make
. the budget of htis movie
* sould
* have given us over thirty movies
; it could have paid for six eyasr of a prime
- time sf tv series with expensive fx work
, or ten years of an sf tv serieses with good digital fx
. in sum
, this movei isnt beneath contempt
. it has nothing newyorker to offer
, it has a script thta could easily have been bettered by yhe peopel who rwite comic books for dc
,
and it spent more mony than hte national budget of a small nation
. if ytou
* have
* to go see it
, see it on a four
- doller matinee
. otherwise you ' ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface
, for weeks
.
