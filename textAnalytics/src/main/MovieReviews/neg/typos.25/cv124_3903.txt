" something is fishy in tyhe state ofthe universal
.
" about ten years back
, with the unexpected success of mad max
and thge road warrior
, post
- apocalypse nitty
- gritty survival yarns became popular at thge movies
. we
' ve alwyas had movies ofthe this nature
; on the beach
, the end of the world
, damnation alley
, the ultimate warrior
,
and so on
. tothe date
, the most smoothly done were straightforward
" haircuts
" of the classic western plot
, like hte lone gunman who comes to town anbd protects the widow
and the son against an evil organization
, usually one in possession of smoe critical resource
, like water
, feed range
, or a mining claim
. most of these grew outloud ofthe venerable
,
but solid hero yarns liuke the virginian
and shane
.
( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn
, which wass fairly well made on a small budget
.
) nowe we have waterworld
, hwihc agian brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow
and her daughter
.
( well
, she
' s nto a widow
, anbd tyhe kid isn
' t her daughter
,
but yuo get the idea
.
) the lady is helen
, played by the stunning jean tripplehorn
, who isn
' t given a chance to be stunning
, or even interesting
, by tyhe mediocre
and unimaginative script
. the child enola
, played by tina majorino
, isnt living proof that a child actro ened not be a bad thing to have in a movei
; she outshines her material all hte way thru
. in simple
, the scene is earth
, hundreds of years from now
. teh polar ice caps have melted
, annd somehow produced enough water tothe innundate the entire planet
. the few remaining peple live in boats anbd floating colonies
,
and survive by trade
, theft
, or piracy
. somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries
,
and its inhabitans
, called
" smokers
,
" are able to keep gasoline engines running dispite the dearth of replacement parts
and raw materials
, so teh bad guys have outboard engines
, anbd fast
- moving boats
, airplanes
,
and jet skis
. enola
, found at sae as a young girl
, has a misterious map no oen can read tattooed onthe her back
. we suspect early onthe that it is the way to the mythical
" dryl
and
,
" the palce where trees
, crops
,
and animals grow
,
and what plot there is hinges on who has enola
. the psycho ruler ofthe the smokers
, the
" deacon
,
" isnt trying tothe get her
and fidn his way tothe dryl
and
. played with typical self
- lampooning
, rug
- chewing histrionics by dennis hopper
,
" deacon
" isnt tghe only thing in the movie thgat
' s close to amusing
. his performance isnt
* almost
* laughable
,
but there just isn
' t anough there to be funny
. the star
(
and a co
- producer
) is kevin costner
. he
' s playing an un
- named lone denizen of hte sea
, a man called tghe
" mariner
,
" who turns out to be a gilled
, water
- breathing mutant with webbed feet
. very little is done wiht this
. the script ignores the ineffectuality ofthe gills infact supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism
; it ignores the fact tht even with both ice caps completly melted
, much of the earth
' s surface owudl still be above water
; annd it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures adn tecnology shown
.
( canned meat doesnt
* not
* last forthe centuries
; ammunition does
* not
* fire after it
' s more than a fewd decades old
;
and so onthe
,
and so on
.
.
.
) i
' m quite fond of tina majorino
' s previous work
, very impressed by jean tripplehorn
' s past accomplishments
, adn still speechless over costner
' s dances with wolves
.
but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone asociated with it
! this movei cost one hundred
and eighty
- two million dollars
,
and there
' s
* nothing
* in it we haven
' t seen before
, done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey
. at 125 minutes of material
, this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make
. the budget of this movie
* coudl
* have given us over thirty movies
; it could have paid fo six years ofthe a prime
- time sf tv series with expensive fx work
, or ten yeras ofthe an sf tv series with good digital fx
. inspite sum
, this movie is beneath contempt
. it has nothing new tothe offer
, it has a script that coudl easily have been bettered by the people who rwite comic books for dc
,
and it spent more money tahn the national budget of a small nation
. if you
* have
* to go see it
, see it onthe a four
- dollar matinee
. otherwise you
' ll find yourself sneering at you every tiem you pass a reflective surfce
, for weeks
.
