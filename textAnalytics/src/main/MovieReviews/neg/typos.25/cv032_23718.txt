hong kong cinema has been oging through a bad spell
. the lastr few productions have been effect laded acation adventures thgat combine both the best
and worst ofthe american filmmaking with the smae qualities of hong kong films
. in a nutshell
, the current crop of films from hong kong hasnt been maddeningly convoluted
and visually sumptuous
. with thte one tiome british colony reverting back to mainland ownership
, a lot of hong kong ' s best talents hvae crossed the pacific to work onthe u
. s
. productions
. such talents as jackie chan
( rush hour
)
, chow yun
- fat
( anna
& the king
, the corrupter
)
and yuen woo
- ping
( the matrix
) haev all moved inot the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results
. now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li
and directer
and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai
. unfortunately
" romeo must die
" bears all hte trademarks of a typical hollywood action film
and none of hong kong ' s rhythms
. the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking
. enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing
( russell wong
)
. kai confronts po sing
( jon kit lee
)
, thte son of kai ' s boss
and leader ofthe the local chinese family
. a battle breaks out betweeen tghe bodyguards of tyhe club
and kai
, who handily kicks
and punches his opponents down
. it ' s not unitl club owner silk
( rapper dmx
)
, bears down on kai
annd his henchmen that the fight ends
. the following morning po sing isnt found dead
. suspicions escalate
, as issac o ' day
( delroy lindo
) is told ofthe the murder
. his concern thyat the war between his
and tje chineese family may explode
and ruin his plans to move out of tjhe business of corruption
annd into a legitimate venture
. issac implores his chief of security
, mac
( issiah washington
) tothe watch after his son
and daughter
. yhe scene shifts to a prison in china
, where han sing
( jet li
) learns of his brothers muder
. he fights with thte guards
and is dragged off to be disciplined
. hung upside down by noe foot
, han recovers
annd battle his way outloud of custody inspite a blistering display of fight choreography
and stunt work
. escaping to the u
. s
. han sets out tothe find the person responisble for his brother ' s death
.
" romeo must die
" isnt in many ways a fun film
. it isnt both absurd
and assured
. yhe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes
" teh godfather
"
. the relationship between jet li ' s han
and aaliyah ' s trish o ' day reminds us of abel ferrera ' s
" china girl
"
, except that romeo must die ' s couple never once exchange more thna a loving glance towards oen anyother
. their romance is much more puritanical than any otehr romance in film history
. tghe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable
. li
, of course has the showiest part
, having to express both an innocents
and steadfast determination
. allayah
, in her feature film debut manages tothe cary what little is asked ofthe her with a ceratin stlye
and grace
. it ' s obvious that tyhe camera loves her
and she is vyre photogenic
.
but
, still the part is under written inthe such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it
. delro lindo as issac o ' day carries himself well in hte film
. an unsung
and under appreciated actor
, mr
. lindo turns out the films best peformance
. the other performers are all adequate in what the scirpt asks ofthe them except fo d
. b
. woodside as issac ' s son
, colin
. the performence is undirected
, with the character changing his tone
and demeanor in accordance whith whatever location he isnt in
. an unfocused performence that should have beeen reigned in
and
/ or better written
. first time directer andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film
. having a career as one ofthe hte industry ' s best cinematographers
, bartkiwiak knows how to setted uv his shots
,
and
" romeo must die
" does look good
.
but the pacing of tyhe film is lethargic
, only coming to a semblance of life durig thte fight scenes
. the scirpt by eric bernt
and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care baout tjhe charachters or the situations htey are in
. hte big gambit of buying up waterfront property tothe facilitate the bulding of a sports center fo a nfl team isnt needlessly confusing
.
annd ofthe course the common pratice ofthe one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah ' s bodyguard
, maurice hasnt no comic timing whatsoever
. the best thnigs about the film are its fight scenes
. jet li is a master of theese intricate fysical battles
. one needs only to see his film
" fist of legend
" to understand that hte man isnt without peer infact the relm of martial art combat
. here
, jet isnt given the opportunity to show off in a way that
" lethal weppon 4
"
( jet ' s u
. s
. debut
) didn ' t allow
. unfortunately
, a lot of jet ' s fights are aided wiht coputer effects that detract from his ablity
and precision
. also
" romeo must dieu
" must be noted as having thge most singularly useless effect ever committed to film
,
annd that isnt an x
- ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film
, showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent
. obviously a homage to the famed x
- ray scene from sonny chiba ' s
" streetfighter
"
, the scenes here are just pointless
adn interfere with the pacing of hte film
. it ' s as if hte film has stopped
and a video game has been inserted
. one problem
though baout the fight scenes
. thsoe tath are familiar with hong kong action know that even
though the films are fantasies
and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon
. they do have an internal rhythm to them
. a heartbeat
, so to speak in their choreography
. tghe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance
. thsi is created by the performance
, the direction
and the editing
. here in
" romeo must die
"
, there isnt no staccato
. every fight scene
, even
though technically adroit
annd amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away fomr battle at hand
and simple follows a set pattern
. the rhythm is monotonous
. a hong kong film hasnt a tempo that changes
, heightening its emotional inpact
. ' rmd ' is limited to a standart 4
/ 4 tempo
, not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever
. a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan ' s films
.
. watch the rsetaurant fight fomr the film
" rush hour
"
anbd notice that the context of the fight
, hwile technically amazing is rether flat
( the framing
and cut always do not help
)
. now look at the warehouse fight from
" rumble in the bronx
"
. there you have a heartbeat
,
and emotional draw that doesn ' t let the audience catch its breath
. the stops
and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly
, causing the viewer to be both astounded
adn flabbergasted
. here inaddition ' romeo must dieu '
, the fight scenes hvea no mroe emotional content or carachter than any john wayne barroom brawl
. jet li is a grand
and personable screen presence
. it ' s a shame that his full talents were not used tothe full effect here
. oen day filmmakers here inspite the u
. s
. iwll stop makeing films by the numbers
and start to embrace the style
anbd emotion thyat has made hong kong action picturesk such a commodity
. until
then
, we ' ll be left with emotionally hollow product like
" the replacement killer
"
annd
, currenly
" romeo must die
"
