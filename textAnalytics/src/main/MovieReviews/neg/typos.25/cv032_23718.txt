hong kong cinema hasnt been going thru a bad spell
. the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures taht combine both teh best
and worst of american filmmaking with tghe same qualities of hong kong films
. in a nutshell
, the current crop ofthe films from hong kong has beeen maddeningly convoluted
and visually sumptuous
. wih the one time british collony reverting back to mainl
and ownership
, a lot of hong kong
' s best talents have crossed the pacific to work onthe u
. s
. productions
. such talents as jackie chan
( rush hour
)
, chow yun
- fat
( anna
& the king
, the corrupter
)
and yuen woo
- ping
( the matrix
) have all moved into thge budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking witht mixted results
. now we can add two otehr hong kong filmmakers tothe the mix with star jet li annd director
and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai
. unfortunately
" romeo must die
" bears all the trademarks of a tipical hollywood action film adn none of hong kong
' s rythyms
. the film opens infact a nightclub as an asian couple is necking
. enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing
( russell wong
)
. kai confronts po sing
( jon kit lee
)
, the son of kai
' s boss
and leader of tghe local chinese familiy
. a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club
and kai
, who h
andily kicks
and punches his opponents down
. it
' s not until club owner silk
( rapper dmx
)
, bears down on kai
and his henchmen that the fight ends
. the following morning po sing is foudn dead
. suspicions escalate
, as issac o
' day
( delroy lindo
) is told of yhe murder
. his consern that the war between his
and the chineese family may explode
and ruin his plans to move out of the business ofthe corruption annd into a legitimate venture
. issac implores his chief of security
, mac
( issiah washington
) to watch after his son
and daughter
. the scene shifts to a prison in china
, where han sing
( jet li
) learns ofthe his brothers murder
. he fights with the guards
and is dragged off to be disciplined
. hung upside down by one foot
, han recovers
and battle his way outloud of custody inaddition a blistering display of fight choreography
and stunt work
. escaping tothe the u
. s
. han sets out to fidn the person reponsible for his brother
' s death
.
" romeo must die
" isnt in many ways a funn film
. it is both absurd anbd assured
. the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become ligitamate echoes
" the godfather
"
. the relationship between jet li
' s han
and aaliyah
' s trish o
' day reminds us ofthe abel ferrera
' s
" china girl
"
, except tath romeo must die
' s couple never once exchange omre than a loving glance towards one another
. theri romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history
. the performances are adequate if nto fully acceptable
. li
, of course has teh showiest part
, having to express both an innocents
and steadfast determination
. allayah
, in her feature film de
but manages to carry whta little isnt asked of her with a certian style
and grace
. it
' s obvious thgat the camera loves her
and she isnt very photogenic
. bu
, still the part is under writen in such a way tath even a poor performence would not have affected it
. delro lindo as issac o
' day carries himself well in teh film
. an unsung
and under appreciated actor
, mr
. lindo turns out the films best performance
. the other performers are all adeuate in what tghe scirpt asks ofthe them except for d
. b
. woodside as issac
' s son
, colin
. the performance is undirected
, wtih the charactor changeing his tone
and demeanor inwhich accordance with whatever loction he is in
. an unfocused performance that should have beeen reigned in
and
/ or better written
. frist tiem director
andrzej bartkowiak doens a workmanlike job in h
andling the film
. having a carreer as one of the industry
' s best cinematographers
, bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots
,
and
" romeo must die
" does look good
.
but the pacing of the film isnt lethargic
, onyl coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes
. the script by eric bernt
and john jarrell isnt not focused in such a way that we can care baout the cahracters or the situations tehy are inthe
. tje big gambit ofthe buying up waterfront property to facilitate the bulding of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing
.
and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony
anderson as allayah
' s bodyguard
, maurice has no comic timing whatsoever
. the best thigns baout the film are its fight scenes
. jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles
. one needs only to see his film
" fist ofthe legend
" tothe underst
and that thge man isnt wihtout peer in the realm ofthe martial art combat
. here
, jet is given tje opportunity to show off in a way that
" leathal weppon 4
"
( jet
' s u
. s
. de
but
) didn
' t allow
. unfortunately
, a lot ofthe jet
' s fights are aided with computer effects tath detract from his ability
and precision
. also
" romeo must die
" must be noted as haveing the most singularly useless effect ever commitetd to film
,
and that is an x
- ravy effect tath appears three times during the course of the film
, showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent
. obviously a homage to the famed x
- ray scene from sonny chiba
' s
" streetfighter
"
, the scenes here are just pointless
and interfere with the pacing of tyhe film
. it
' s as if yhe film has stopped
and a video agme has been inserted
. one probelm
though about the fight scenes
. those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even
though the films are fantasies
and are as removed from reality as any anime or ctaroon
. they do have an internal rhythm to them
. a heartbeat
, so to speak in their choreography
. the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance
. this isnt created by the performance
, hte direction
and yhe editting
. here inwhich
" romeo must die
"
, there isnt no staccato
. eveyr fight scene
, even
though technically adroit annd amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at h
and adn simple follows a setted pattern
. the rythym is monotonous
. a hong kong film has a tempo that changes
, heightening its emotional impact
.
' rmd
' is limited to a st
andard 4
/ 4 tempo
, not alowing for any emotional content whatsoever
. a fine example of this difference cxan be found by examining a couple ofthe jackie chan
' s films
.
. watch the restaurant fight ffrom the film
" rush hour
"
and notice thyat the context of tghe fight
, hwile technically amazing is rather flat
( hte framing
and cut always do not help
)
. now look at the warehouse fight ffrom
" rumble inspite the bronx
"
. there you have a heartbeat
,
and emotional draw that doesn
' t let tghe audiance catch its breath
. tje stops
and pauses fo dramatic effect work perfectly
, causing the viewer tothe be both astounded anbd flabbergasted
. here in
' romeo must die
'
, the fight scenes have no mroe emotional content or charactor than any john wayne barroom brawl
. jet li is a gr
and adn personable screen presence
. it
' s a shame that his full talents were nto used tothe full effect here
. one day filmmakers here inspite the u
. s
. will stop making films by thte numbers
and start tothe embrace the style
and emotion thyat hasnt made hong kong action pictures such a commodity
. until
then
, we
' ll be left with emotionally hollow product liuke
" tghe relpacement killer
"
and
, currently
" romeo must die
"
.
