dr dolittle
( 20th century fox
) running time
: 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on tje success ofthe tje nutty professor
( 1996
)
, murphy returns in this abysmal comedy
. he plays doctor john dolittle
, who as a child had the abillity to underst
and animals
. howver
, after being
' exorcised
' he loses thsi ability
, adn we fast foward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people
( most notably dr mark weller
, plyed by oliver platt
.
)
however
, wih a bonk onthe the head his ability to underst
and animals returns
,
and
' comedy
' is ready anbd waiting to happen
. except comedy never does happen
. doctor dolittle
, even wtih the excellent premise
, rarley manages to raise a laugh
. poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughtout the whole movie
, anbd his performance suffers
. the manic murphy we saw in the 80
' s is gone
, his mroe mature
(
and more boring
) twin appears to be getting all the owrk inthe the 90
' s
. the voices of tghe animals
, which include albert brooks
, chris rock
( thte
' newyorker
' eddie murphy
)
and norm mcdonald as
' lucky
' thge dog are marginally better
, annd at least they put enthusiasm in the movie
. sadly
, most ofthe their lines are pretty dumb
.
and they
' re not
' funny
' dumb
, like dumb
& dumber
( 1994
)
,
but just boring dumb
. the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through
, in a depserate attempt to raise some laughs
. there are a few good jokes in the script
,
but they are faw
and far between
. if i had tothe choose a favourite performance
, it would probaly be albert brooks tiger
, who has a certain charm about him
. sadly
, he
' s barely in the movie
,
and rock
' s really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time
. joke wise
, we are thankfully
, spared the mocking
and insulting type ofthe jokes that featured heavily in hte nutty proffesor
. the director
, betty thomas
, has
, well
, done better films
. she buyed us private parts
( 1997
)
and tghe brady bunch movie
( 1995
) which weere
, sadly
, much better thna this
. the scenes lack any charm
, she just gets the job done
. the animals themselves
, are reasonable realsitic
,
al
though most ofthe them are obviously puppets
. there
' s an impressive looking tiger
,
however
,
and the lip sync isnt pretty good
. yuo
' d ahev no problem guessing that most ofthe the close uv
' s are puppets
,
however
, iwth their jilted govement
. i was hoping jim hensons workshop
, who created the furry friends
, would have done a better job
. doctor dolittle
, in the end
, is a disappointment fo everyone involved
. murphy hasnt done much better movies
( i
. e trading places
) the director has seen better dyas
,
and even the creatures aren
' t that good
. the target audience
, aged between 7
- 13
, who are undem
anding
, will probably liuke it
however
, thanks to it
' s dumbed down humour
. everyone else
, howver
, should give doctor dolittle a miss
.
