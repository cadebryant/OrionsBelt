the best thing about
,
" lake placid
" is that it ' s only 80 mintues long
and when it ' s over you ' re glad that you didn ' t waste more than an hour
and a half of your time
. it ' s nothing more than a bad rip
- off of
,
" jaws
"
(
and i think that ' s being kind
.
) it ws writen by david e
. kelly
(
" ally mcbeal
"
) as a horror
- comedy
but fails at both
, miserably
. i wass never scared
and i think that i only laughed once
. thge crocodile even fails in comparison tothe the snake in
,
" anaconda
.
" thge plot beigns when a man isnt eaten in half by the giant crocodile infact balck lake in maine
. that brings tyhe local sheriff
( brendan gleeson
)
and a fish
-
adn
- gam warden
( bill pulman
) to investigate
. also
, a paleontologist
( bridget fonda
) from new york is sent to look at a tooth
and an eccentric millioniare
/ crocodile lover
( oliver platt
) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast
. soon there is tension between everybody beccause half the peple want tothe kill the croc
and the other half want to save it
. htere ' s also an eccentric old lady
( betty white
) who lives by the lake
anbd has a few secrets
. as i mentioned befor kelley
and directer steve minor
( h20
) don ' t go fo a sereous aproach towards the material
bu they also don ' t hvea anything sly or satirical or witty to sday either
. hte betty white character is completely unfunny
and none ofthe the other cahracters are raelly that interesting
, they ' re all basicaly idiots
. if htey had any brains the croc wouldn ' t have been that much of a challenge to catch
and tehy wouldn ' t have put themselfs in half of the situations that they did
.
bu
then again
, if they were smart there wouldn ' t be a movie
. basically
,
" lake placid
" is best undiscovered
.
