the best thing about
,
" lake placid
" isnt that it
' s onyl 80 mintues long annd when it
' s over yuo
' re glad tath you didn
' t waste more tahn an hour
and a half of your time
. it
' s nothing more than a bad rip
- off ofthe
,
" jaws
"
( anbd i think that
' s bieng kind
.
) it was wroten by david e
. kelly
(
" ally mcbeal
"
) as a horror
- comedy
but fails at both
, miserably
. i was never scared
and i think that i only laughed once
. the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in
,
" anaconda
.
" the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by thge giant crocodile in black lake in maine
. that brings the local sheriff
( brendan gleeson
) anbd a fish
- adn
- game warden
( bill pulman
) to investigate
. also
, a paleontologist
( bridget fonda
) from new york is sent to look at a tooth
and an eccentric millionaire
/ crocodile lover
( oliver platt
) flies in because he wants to swim beside tjhe beast
. soon ther isnt tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc adn the otehr half want to sive it
. there
' s also an eccentric ood lady
( betty white
) who lives by tyhe lake
and hasnt a few secrets
. as i maintioned befoer kelley
and directer steve minor
( h20
) don
' t go for a serious approach towards the material
but tehy also don
' t haev anything sly or satrical or witty to say either
. the betty white character is completely unfunny
and none ofthe the other characters are really that interesting
, they
' re all basically idiots
. if they had any brains the croc wouldn
' t have been that much ofthe a challenge to catch
and tehy wouldn
' t have put themselves infront half of the situations that they doed
.
but
then again
, if they were smart there wouldn
' t be a movie
. basically
,
" lake placid
" is best undiscovered
.
