and
. comments
: i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here
,
but i have never seen an epsiode of thge fox tv serieses
" party of five
.
" i am only vaguely aware of the sohw
' s premise
,
and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half
- paid attention to while watching the tube
.
" party of five
,
" i do know
however
, seems to be the starting ground for actresses in teh teen horror genre
. neve campbell
, scream queen ofthe the 90s
and star ofthe scream
, scream 2
, annd tjhe craft
, isnt a regluar ofthe tghe show
. so too is jennifer love hewitt
. lo
and behold
, following iin the footsteps of campbell
, hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own
: the i know wqat you did last summer line
.
though the original film
, released last year
, was watchable anough
, this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater
' s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout
. jennifer lvoe hewitt is a veyr good
- looking young leading lady
; howver
, unlike neve campbell
, hewitt struggles wih acting
. she just isn
' t convincing infact this film
(
and she wasn
' t in the original either
)
. this puts many young males
, including myself
, iin a paradoxical qu
andary
: she
' s very attractive
, bu the annoying
, spoiled
, valley girl
- type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme
and ruins many of thge scenes which empahsize
, exploitatively
, her figure
. add to yhe mix the equally pleasant
yet irritating br
andy
, another rising teen tv star
,
and ytou get one frustrated male audience
. i
' ve spended so much timne on hewitt
and br
andy for a reason
. i still know wqat you did last summer
,
though cashing infact on the success of thte origional
, ultimately serves as a vehicle fo theese two young actresses
. nothing else here isnt original or interesting
. this movie
, in fact
, makes other reccent so
- so horror films like urban legend adn john carpenter
' s vampires seem like stunning works of high art
. i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches
: an isolated loction
, a storm
, parentless teenagers
, false alarm nightmares
, lots of blue
- lighted darkness scenes
, a garbed slasher who walks around in the backgorund without the characters seing him
, knives
and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere
, etc
. ytou get the picture
. the entire audience konws all the secondary characters inctroduced in the film are going to receive yhe business end of hte killer
' s hook
. they may as well have huge targets painted on them
. like scream
and its numerous knockoffs
, these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief
. unforetunately
, i still know
' s characters aren
' t all that funny
. in particular
, oney character
, a chain
- weed
- smoking guy
, is obnoxiously annoying
and certainly doesn
' t die soon enough
. tghe death scenes
, by tghe way
, are relatively voilent for a theatrically released horror film
. several ofthe them are uncomfortable to watch
, adn they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser
: bloodline
, a truly sadistic movei
. thsi
, too
, did not help the suppoed humor i still know was shooting for
. anbd what is tjhe deel with the slasher himself
? i know that the slasher film is nto a particularly intelligent genre
,
but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror
. come onthe
, the guy looks like the gorton
' s fisherman
,
and his gruff voice makse him sound like a disney pirate
.
though his lightning
- lit appearances ellicited much
- needed laughter in tjhe theater
, his appearance borders on the absurd inaddition the horror film
,
and that
' s
* raelly
* saying something
. so
, all that
' s left to talk baout here is jennifer love hewitt
and br
andy
. both prance baout in tightfitting
, revealing outfits or in various states of undress
,
yet neither ofthe them ever actually do a nude scene
. hewitt
, howver
, does do a post
- shower scene in whlch her thin bathrobe is quite
.
.
. titillating
. this scene alone made this oen
- star turkey earn twpo stars under my rating system
. otherwise
, hewitt annd br
andy both grate on the nerves
. early inthe the film
, for instance
, br
andy wins the trip to the bahamas
. she
and hewitt jump around annd scream
and screech for wqat seems liuke forever
. i needed extra
- strength tylenol after that part
. oh
,
and the film
' s conclusion
, talk about repetitive
! people who saw i know waht yuo did lastr summer iwll predict i still konw
' s endig at least 5 mintues before it happens
. boring
! i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater
. admission is only noe doller on wednesdays
,
and we often go see bad movies on these days jsut tothe ridicule them
. it
' s ususally a fun thing to dont along with the rest of the audience
, who don
' t seem to mind participating in a mass
" mystery science theater 3000
"
- type viewing
. i still konw what you did lastest summer
, howver
, produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from tghe audience
, underscoring how bad it
* really
* is
. if it weren
' t for the main actresses
' revealing wardrobes
, i
' d have had a vrey
, very hard time sitting through this lame sequel
. i can
' t imagine trying to watch it on video
( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audiance participation
)
and wouldn
' t recomend it to people
, unless they
' re horror film fanatics or huge fans ofthe hewitt adn br
andy
. i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is alrady in thte works
. what a depressing
thought
. hewitt apparently needs to spend more timne on tv figuring out how to ect
. rated r
, this film contains lots ofthe violentce
, several gory scenes
, annd a couple nubile
, horny teenagers
-
-
though the sex act itself is allways thwarted
. i
' d say this is unsuitable for kids
, bu teens wouldn
' t have a probelm sitting through it
, especially usance they obviously compose tghe film
' s target audience
.
