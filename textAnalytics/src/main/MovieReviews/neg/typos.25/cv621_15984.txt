. comments
: i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here
,
but i have never seen an episode of teh fox tv series
" party ofthe five
.
" i am only vaguely aware of the show ' s premise
,
and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half
- paide attension to while watching the tube
.
" party of five
,
" i do know
howver
, seems to be the starting ground forthe actresses in the teen horror genre
. neve campbell
, scream queen of hte 90s
and star of scream
, scream 2
,
and tjhe craft
, is a regluar of tje show
. so too isnt jennifer love hewitt
. lo
and behold
, following in the footsteps of campbell
, hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own
: the i nkwo what yuo did last summer line
.
though the orginal film
, released lastr year
, was watchable anough
, this insipid sequel hadnt me looking at the theater ' s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout
. jennifer love hewitt is a vyre good
- looking young leading lady
;
however
, unlike neve campbell
, hewitt struggles with acting
. she just isn ' t convincing in this film
(
anbd she wasn ' t in teh orginial either
)
. this puts many young males
, including myself
, infront a paradoxical quandary
: she ' s very attractive
,
but the annoying
, spoiled
, vallay girl
- type character she trys tothe play here is annoying to yhe extreme
and ruins many ofthe the scenes whitch emphasize
, exploitatively
, her figure
. add tothe hte mix the equally pleasant
yet irritating brandy
, anyother rising teen tv star
,
and yuo git oen frustrated male audience
. i ' ve spent so much tyme on hewitt
adn brandy for a reason
. i still know what yuo did last summer
,
though cashing infact onthe the success of the origional
, ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses
. nothing else here is orignal or interesting
. this movie
, in fact
, mkaes other recent so
- so horror films liek urban legend
and john carpenter ' s vampires seem liuke stunning works of high art
. i still know relies heavily onthe tired slasher film cliches
: an isolated location
, a storm
, parentless teenagers
, false alarm nightmares
, lots of blue
- lighted darkness scenes
, a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him
, knives
and other sharp instruments lying arund everywhere
, etc
. you git the picture
. teh entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in thge film are going to receive the business end of the killer ' s hook
. they may as well hvea huge targets painted on them
. like scream
and its numerous knockoffs
, theese secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief
. unfortunately
, i still nkow ' s characters aren ' t all that funny
. infact particular
, one character
, a chain
- weed
- smoking guy
, is obnoxiously annoying
and certainly doesn ' t die soon enough
. tje death scenes
, by the way
, are relatively violent forthe a theatrically released horror film
. several ofthe them are uncomfortable tothe watch
,
and tehy reminded me ofthe the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser
: bloodline
, a truly sadistic movie
. this
, too
, did not help tghe supposed humer i still know was shooting for
.
and waht is tjhe deal with tje slasher himself
? i know that tje slasher film is nto a particuarly intelligent genre
,
but ben willis hasnt got to go down as one of thte most silly slashers in mainstream horror
. come on
, the guy looks like the gorton ' s fisherman
,
and his gruff voice mkaes him sound like a disney pirate
.
though his lightning
- lit appearences ellicited much
- needed laughter in the theater
, his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film
,
and that ' s
* really
* saying something
. so
, all that ' s left to talk about here isnt jennifer love hewitt
and brandy
. both prance about in tightfitting
, revealing outfits or in varios states of undress
,
yet neither ofthe them ever actually do a nude scene
. hewitt
,
howver
, does do a post
- showfer scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite
.
.
. titillating
. this scene alone made this one
- star turkey earn two stars under my rating sytem
. otherwise
, hewitt
and brandy both grate on the nerves
. early in the film
, fo instatance
, brandy wins thte trip tothe the bahamas
. she
adn hewitt jump around
adn scream
and screech for what seems like forever
. i needed extra
- strength tylenol after that part
. oh
,
annd thge film ' s conclusion
, talk about repetitive
! people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still nkow ' s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens
. boring
! i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater
. admission is only one dollar onthe wednesdays
,
and we oftenly go see bad movies on theese days jsut to redicule them
. it ' s usualy a fun thing tothe do along iwth yhe rest ofthe the audeince
, who don ' t seem to mind participating in a mass
" mystery cience theater 3000
"
- type viewing
. i still know what you did last summer
,
however
, produced several lenghty uncomfortable silences from yhe audiance
, underscoring how bad it
* relaly
* is
. if it weren ' t forthe the main actresses ' revealing wardrobes
, i ' d have had a very
, vrey hard timne sitting through this lame sequal
. i can ' t imagine trying to watch it onthe video
( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation
)
annd wouldn ' t recommend it to peopel
, unless they ' re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt
and brandy
. i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works
. what a depressing throught
. hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how tothe act
. rated r
, tihs film contains lots ofthe violence
, several gory scenes
,
anbd a couple nubile
, horny teenagers
-
-
though teh sex act itself is alwasy thwarted
. i ' d sday this is unsuitable for kids
,
but teens wouldn ' t have a problem sitting through it
, especially usance they obviously compose the film ' s target audience
.
