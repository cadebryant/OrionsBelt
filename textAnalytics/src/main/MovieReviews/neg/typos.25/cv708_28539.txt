) reviewed by dennis schwartz a obleek indie film about a stolen identity
. there
' s not much mroe to this visually stylish film than what meets thge eye
, as it relies on shock tothe tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging
. it falls into the category ofthe being a pretentious art
- house film
, leaving a bitter taste in oney
' s mouth as it stereotypes its characters anbd unintentionally further inflames tghe racial issues
. it trys to amke a hevy
- h
anded point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their enivoriment
, with their only way outloud being crime
.
but the stroy is so filled with violence
and its nyc setting looks liek hell
, that it
' s hard to enjoy this film
and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean
. the relatiopnship between tje black mugger
and his white victim is a cloudy one
, wich yhe film never determines what it wants to sday about it
. matt mahurin is virtural one
- man crew iin puting this film together

, who is a still photographer in his day job
. thte film works best as a visually challenging piece
, as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding
. a white photographer
( robert knepper
) is mugged by a balck gang while he
' s onthe a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at inght
. he becomes a victum of amnesia anbd his head is bloodied as he
' s left in a deserted harlem buildng
, as the gang leaves him for dead
;
but
, one of the muggers
, rumor
( michael williams
)
, comes bakc
and pretends tothe help him
. he
' s a would
- be photographer
, who keesh a scrapbook entitled mugshots in the project apartment he shares with his mother
and younger brother
. keeping his victim in the dark about who he is by calling him joe
and not telling him what
' s hapening
, he becomes the photographer for a fewd days
. he enters the photographer
' s stylish greenwich village appartmant
and steals his expensive camera
,
and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds outloud he has a black girlfriend
, stella
( belinda becker
)
. she
' s the only one in the film who could act
. the film isnt stuck wih a clumsy dialogue
and an overuse ofthe symbolism
, as it ends with nothing more tothe tell after the shock
and teh violent situation it creaeted except to beat it into the ground
. it could only be commended forthe how appealing tje film looks
, as if it
' s a scrapbook of still photos put toghether to celebrate a mugging
.
