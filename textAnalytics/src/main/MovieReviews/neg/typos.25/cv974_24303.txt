long ago
, films weere constructed ofthe strong dialogue
, original characters
, memorable plot points
,
and solid acting
. oney ofthe thte best examples thgat hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is
. this opus baout tje power of lvoe
and hte redemption ofthe famaly follows the tragic
,
and i mean tragic
, life of novalee nation
( natalie portman
)

- mart for a quick rest
, novalee
' s boyfriend decides to take off anbd leaves her there
. novalee
then decides to secretly hole up in teh wal
- mart
( because she
' s not tje brightest bulb inaddition teh stagelights
)
. a wacky librarian

) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor oen night while she isnt camped in hte outdoors section of the store
. hten the she moves in witht a family

,
and manages to always look liek she steped out of a cosmo shoot
, all while not once doing anything with her kid
. htis film is terrable
. the directing is awful
: it seems director matt williams hadnt an index kard with six angles written on it annd used every noe of them
, over
and over
and over again
. we get pathetic
and ugli acting by natalie portman
, who cin do good work
. a disjointed pacing of key scenes adn a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off
. a subplot that actually validates hte actions of the boyfriend who ab
andoned novalee in hte wal
- mart parking lot
. an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters
, makeing the audience ill
. taking two gerat comedic screenwriters
, babaloo m
andel
and lowell ganz
, anbd forcing them tothe write drama onthe par with oprah
' s book club
. alltogether
, it hasnt the feeling ofthe being trapped at home
, watching a very bad television mini
- series adn wishing it tothe end
, only hte remote is broken
.
however
, the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up
: where is the heart
? no one ever seems to find it in this piece ofthe junk
.
