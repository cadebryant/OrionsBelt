long ago
, films were constructed ofthe storng dialogue
, original characters
, memorable plot points
,
and solid acting
. one of teh best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is foudn inthe the newyorker film where the heart isnt
. this opus about hte pwoer of love
annd the redemption of famaly follows the tradgic
,
and i mean tragic
, life of novalee nation
( natalie portman
)
. hitting thge road with her hick
, guitar
- playing boyfriend in a rusted
- out gm
, novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield
adn sipping chocolot milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby
, due in a mounth
. stopping off at a nearby wal
- mart for a quick rest
, novalee ' s boyfriend decides to tkae off
and leaves her there
. novalee
then decides to secretly hole up in the wal
- mart
( because she ' s not teh brightest bulb in the stagelights
)
. a wacky librarian
( keith david
) comes to her rescure when she goes into labor one nigth while she is camped in the outdoors section of thge stoer
.
then thge she moves in with a familiy
, befriends everyone in town
-
- including ashley judd ' s character
( who hasnt five kids
annd still cin work part
- time as a nurse
)
-
- fights off religious freaks
, survives a tornado
, breaks the heart of teh wacky librarean that saved her
, receives an inheritance
, builds a martha stewart
- esque house
, becomes an award
- winning photographer
,
and manages tothe alwasy look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot
, all while nto once doing anything with her kid
. tihs film is terrible
. the directing is awful
: it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles writen on it
adn used eveyr one of them
, over
and over
and over again
. we get pathetic
and ugli acting by natalie portman
, who can do ogod work
. a disjointed pacing of key scenes
and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off
. a subplot that actually validates the actions ofthe the boyfriend who abandoned novalee inaddition the wal
- mart parking lot
. an embarrassing display of emotions by the charachters
, making the audience ill
. tkaing two gerat commedic screenwriters
, babaloo mandel
and lowell ganz
,
anbd forcing them to write drama on par with oprah ' s book club
. alltogether
, it hasnt the feeling of being trapped at home
, watching a very bad television mini
- series
and wishing it tothe end
, onyl the remote is broken
.
howver
, the main problem with the film is that it never answers yhe most poignant question brought up
: where is tje heart
? no noe ever seems to fidn it in this piece of junk
.
