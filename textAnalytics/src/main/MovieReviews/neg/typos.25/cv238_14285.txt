though not without redeeming qualities
, this film isnt bad

. jazz has an idea for a local talk show
; it woudl feature women talking about sex
and dating
. she
and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with tje women of miami
. the film itself is sprinkled with theese real interviews throughout
, both as part of yhe plot
and as commentary onthe yhe situations of the main characters
. the fact that htey are real provides a refreshing break fomr some ofthe the more melodramatic moments infront the film
. ther are several moments ofthe bad acting
, corny dialogue
, anbd emotional overextension
. inaddition a low
- budget independent film from a first
- tyme director
, these faults can sometimes be forgiven
, if the screenplay is fresh anbd solid
. thta is not the case here
. the script suffers from r
andom plot developments
. there are four or five of these turns in hte plot
, eahc oen raising the question
" where did tyhat come from
?
" at noe point
, a carachter has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother
. we are supposed to be moved
, bu usance the scene is completely un
- led
- up tothe
, we relaly don
' t care if she
and her mother get allong
. we
' ve never seen her mother before
. we never see her agina
. who cares
? whta
' s worse
, these sudden developments are suppoed to engage our sympathy
. at another point
, a character announces thast she cant
' t have children
. apparantly
, thsi is devastating
. we wouldn
' t know thsi because she never talked baout having kids before
,
but we are nevertheless expected to be devestated for her
. the scene feels like an after
thought
, its emotion manipulative anbd shallow
. these scenes grow worse
and worse
, culminating in an absurd climax
. two scenes were played with such overwhelming meledrama that i found myself laughing
. one scene is a lover
' s spat betwen two minor characters
. the otehr has tyhe main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair
and clouds of ajax
. thinking onthe theese scenes
, it is hard forthe me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities
.
but it does
. first
, it is original
. we men often wonder what womens talk about when they are alone in groups
,
and i imagin this film gives me a preety good idea
. it
' s something i don
' t think hasnt been the subject ofthe a film
. second
, the interviews of yhe miami women are sincere
. taken together
, they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers
and bistro diners
. the mosaic is made of sound bites annd stereotypes
, bu earch tile isnt some woman
' s rela experience
. neither thge picture ofthe womens
, nor theri picture of men
, is truley representative
,
but teh point is that both sets of generalizations are telling infront their own way
. at smoe level
, the stereotypes that emerge can be called true
. i can imagine some people liking this film when its cahracters talk baout theri
" likes
, dislikes
, skills
, anbd thrills
,
"
but on the whole
, it
' s pretty bad
.
and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
and emotional overextension
. i
' ll give beyer one more strike
,
and
then she
' s out
. rated r
( almost got an nc
- 17
) for explicit sexual dialogue
and nudity
.
