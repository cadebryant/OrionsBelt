: brian depalma running time
: 115 mintues the frist big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything
but
. gary sinise stars as an astronaut who isnt removed fomr a mars mission when his astronaut wife
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
, becomes ill
and passes away
. don cheadle is
thn given the mission along with a russian cuple
and a young hotshot
. when a strange whirlwind shooted from the top of a mars mountain range attacks tghe crew ofthe the mission
, sinise
adn robbins convince their superior tothe let them
, neilsen
,
and o ' connell perform a rescue mission fo whatever crew might be remaning
. what they discover on tjhe surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever
(
although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected
)
. before i ever saw the film
, i wass aware of the promotional campaign wih dr
. pepper
. every time i would see a bottle ofthe the soft drink
, the mission tothe mars logo was emblazoned apon it
. little did i know tyhat the plot owudl be taking a bcak seat to the product placement of the drink
and severeal other products
. dr
. pepper saves the day at one point
,
and a dream sequence
/ flashback features jerry o ' connell shoving m
& m ' s in our face
. these are
but a couple ofthe the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film
. clich
? s are also the order ofthe the day with mission to mars
. dialogue
and chracter motivations are all lifted direcly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better
and with more style
( even independendet day
, which lifted all of it ' s premises from other sci
- fi films was better than this film
,
and i don ' t liuke independence day
)
. films like 2001
: a space odyssey
, the abyss
,
and close encounters of the thrid kind are all blatantly stolen from
(
and poorly at thta
)
. there isnt even a sequence where a rover isnt traveling through a canyon
,
and i couldn ' t help
but wisper
" u ' tinni
" tothe myself
and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks befor the rover sould get a glimpse of it
. htis film alsot features one of my all
- time least favorite movei clich
? s
: the
" he owudl haev wanted you to hve thsi
" moent
, where noe character gives anohter a tringket that
yet another character is estalbished as constantly having
(
anbd isnt usually made fun of by teh charactor who ends up getting all sappy over it later on
)
. scenes like these always bother me wehn htey come outloud ofthe nowhere inspite regluar films
,
but in a film as clich
? ridden as this
, it is particulary irritating
. ennio morricone ' s music is usually considered to be soem of the best stuff in the projects he works on
,
but here it is dreadfully overbearing
. his music sounds liek it came straight out ofthe a vincent price movei in certain scenes
. at other times his music is unbearably over
- dramatic
. one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescure is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won ' t reach its intended target
. mission to mars is push button filmmaking tothe teh greatest extreme
. events are set inot motion that are obvious tothe anyone who has ever seen a movie
annd seem like they are just ther to evoke an emotional response in the audience
. we are apparently suppossed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deepo space
adn kills hismelf tothe save his wife
,
bu i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest
. what makes it all worse isnt thgat fatc that there isnt noone real reason that robbins ' character needs to turn himself inot a popsicle
, except to invoke an emotional responce
( i sould think of at least one way tothe save him
,
and teh nasa clowns in this film are supposed tothe be
" smarter
" than i am
)
. druing tghe finale
, when we are finally inctroduced to thge translucent
, conehead
, kitty
- faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from
, we are presented wiht some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film
( just slightly worse than tyhe plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn
)
. a brief istory lesson about
" where we came from
" is proffered
,
then sinise is whisked away to be wih
" teh rest of our people
"
( he doens this because his lite wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that
" this is a chance to step foot where no oney else has
"
)
.
> from the press i ' ve been seeing this film receive
, it is appparent that mission tothe mars wiull be dying a quick death at the theater
. i ' m sure the first weekend or two wiull be huge
,
but once owrd gets out people will stop going
. let ' s jstu hope yhe upcomming red planet is better than htis
and isn ' t hurt by the negativity this film is generating
. i ' d venture to say it won ' t be worse than this waste of time
.
