but
. gary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wief
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
, becomes ill adn passes away
. don cheadle is
then given the mission along with a russina couple

, sinise
and robbins convince their superior to let them
, neilsen
, adn o
' connell preform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining
. what htey discover on the surfce ofthe the planet will dramatically change their lives forever
(
al
though no one watching teh film will come awya profoundly affected
)
. before i ever saw yhe film
, i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr
. pepper
. every time i owudl see a bottle ofthe tje soft drink
, the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it
. little doed i know that the plot would be taking a bcak seat to the product placement of the drnik
and several other products
. dr
. pepper saves tje day at oney point
,
and a dream sequence
/ flashback features jerry o
' connell shoving m
& m
' s in our face
. these are
but a cuple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered
thoughout the film
. clich
? s are also the order of the day witht mission to mars
. dialogue
and charachter motivations are all lefted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better annd whith more style
( even independence day
, which lifted all of it
' s premises from other sci
- fi films was better than this film
, adn i don
' t like independence day
)
. films liuke 2001
: a space odyssey
, the abyss
,
and close encounters ofthe tjhe third kind are all blatantly stolen fomr
(
and poorly at taht
)
. there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon
, anbd i couldn
' t halp
but wisper
" u
' tinni
" tothe mysef
and wait forthe a jawa to quicklyu hide in the rocks befor thge rover could get a glimpse of it
. this film also features one ofthe my all
- time least favorite movie clich
? s
: the
" he would have wnated you to hvea this
" moment
, where one character gives anohter a tringket thyat
yet another character is established as constanly having
( annd is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later onthe
)
. scenes like these alwyas bother me when they cmo out of nowhere in regluar films
,
but iin a film as clich
? ridden as this
, it is particularyl irritating
. ennio morricone
' s music is usually considered to be smoe of the best stfuf in the projects he works on
,
but here it is dreadfully overbearing
. his music soudns liuke it came straight out ofthe a vincent price movie in ceratin scenes
. at otehr times his music is unbearably over
- dramatic
. one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particulalry cheesy sting when it isnt dicovered that the grappling hook divice used for the rescue won
' t triarch its intended target
. mission tothe mars isnt push
button filmmaking to thge greatest extreme
. events are set into motion that are obvious tothe anyone who hasnt ever seen a movie
and seem liek they are just there to evoke an emotional responce in the audience
. we are apparantly supposed to be upset that tim robbins chracter removes his helmet inspite deep space
and kills hismelf to save his wife
,
but i falt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest
. what makes it all worse isnt that fact thgat there is no real reason that robbins
' character needs tothe turn himself inot a popsicle
, except tothe invoke an emotional response
( i coudl think ofthe at least one way to save him
,
and the nasa clowns in htis film are supposed tothe be
" smarter
" thna i am
)
. during the finale
, when we are finally introduced to the translucent
, conehead
, kitty
- faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from
, we are presented with smoe of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film
( just slightly worse thna yhe plane kresh at the end of air force one or the hell scenes infront spawn
)
. a brief history lesson about
" where we came ffrom
" is proffered
, hten sinise is whisked away to be with
" tyhe rest of our people
"
( he does this becouse his late wife proclaims iin a video he watches early on that
" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has
"
)
.
> fomr the press i
' ve been seing this film receive
, it is apparent that mission to mars will be dieing a quick death at thte theater
. i
' m sure the frist weekend or two will be huge
,
but once word gets out peopel will stop going
. let
' s just hope the upcomming red planet is better tahn thsi annd isn
' t hurt by the negativity thsi film is generating
. i
' d venture tothe say it won
' t be worse than this waste ofthe timne
.
