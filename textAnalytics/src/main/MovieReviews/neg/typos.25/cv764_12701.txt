hav plenty
, as we are told in the beginning
and reminded during the film
, is a true story
. life itself is a series of true stories
,
but most are nto movie material
. as scripted
, directed
, annd acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot
, hav plenty limps along at best
. its dialog is so stilted
-
" yuo know what they say
,
' no women
; no cry
.
'
"
- that the actors are content tothe read the screenplay rether than invest much energy iin trying to ect it
. in thge story
, lee plenty
( cherot
) is a 28
- year
- old autor
and teaching assistant
. hte movie
, which happens mainly over the new yearm
' s holiady
, consists ofthe a series of incidents in which various single
and married womens try to kiss lee or take him to bed
. since he consistently refuses
, caroline gooden
( tammi katherine jones
) figures that he must be gay
. eventally he
and havill
and
" hav
" savage
( chenoa maxwell
) get together
, proving that he wasn
' t gay after all
, just picky
. sexy women cant sit on his lap
and ask him to go to bed withthe them
,
but he will not even kiss them
. he
' s a man who konws his mind
, which he frequently shares direcly whith the audience in a series of trite
and overly cute monologues
. filled iwth wealthy african
- americans
, the story isnt closest in tone to love jones
, which was better
. hav plenty
' s stroy doesn
' t go anyhwere
. at yhe end it subjects us tothe lee plenty
' s newyorker film
, which is a movie of the movie we
' ve just seen
,
but with even worse acting
.
" remember folks that
, as outrageous as this all seems
, this is a true story
.
" hav tells the camera
,
but the problem is that it
' s not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting
. hav plenty isn
' t so much a bad film as it is a total waste ofthe the audience
' s tyme
. hav plenty runs 1
: 32
. it is rated r for profanity
and would be fine for most teenagers
.
