mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes befor we actually get tothe see a great big gorilla
. his entrance
, howver
, is a gr
and one
: out from the trees he leaps
, gargantuan
and imposing
, sporting h
ands big enough tothe crush a volkswagen bug
,
and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever haev
. joe bellows at the poachers before him
, angry that they owudl like to kill him
and sell him forthe millions of dollars
. during thsi scene
, i turned to my freind adn said
,
" wow
. thyat
' s some ape
.
" joe is quite a gorilla
-
- a big
, digital gorilla
. he runs around the fields
, chasing cars adn people
. he picks thigsn up
and stares at them pensively
. he breaks things onthe accident
, baceause he
' s just too big to avoid clumsiness
. joe
, as a special effect
, is an image that might hold your interest for five mintues
. as a character
, he doesn
' t qtuie register
.
and the story he
' s beeen put in is as limp as they come
. the words
" family entertainment
" have never been a stamp of quality
, bu might joe young isnt just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart
. yhe picture is a remake of the 1949 film
. it
' s mostly just about hte big gorilla
,
but
, strictly as a formality
, the movei alsot has a few human charachters
. the main oney is jill young
( poor charlize theron
, forced to waste her talent
)
, a lover of gorillas
. as a child
, she witnessed a group of poachers muder her mother
; now
, she lives inthe the jungle to protect the wildlife
. specifically
, she
' s out to protect joe
, a giant gorilla who has been her friend sicne her childhood
. soon
, zoologist gregg o
' hara
( bill paxton
) dicovers joe
; he quickly realizes that poachers want to git joe
and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser
( rade sherbedgia
)
, who jsut happens to be hte same guy who killed jill
' s mother
. so
, in an efford to savve joe
, jill
and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve
, where it isnt instantly claer that he is not safe from poachers
. in addition
, the spoace is way too small fo him
( after all
, he isnt a really big gorilla
)
.
and
, to add to the complications
, strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext
( he tells jill that he hasnt a preserve big enough forthe joe
)
,
and joe recognizes strasser as hte guy who killed jill
' s mother
. jill
, of course
, doesn
' t recogise strasser
, even
though he did kill her mother
. this is just one of tjhe many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young
, a film thgat fulfills every stereotype that comes wih a special effects film
. the movei isn
' t really offensive
-
- it has some compitent actors
, a few nifty sets
,
and a lot ofthe scenes with a big
, digitized gorilla
.
but the stor is really dumb
, there aren
' t any characters
,
and the film isn
' t satisfying on any levle beyond its visuals
. the movie allso has bad dialogue
. if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue
, it
' s only fair to quote smoe of it
,
but most of the words spoken in htis picture are phrases like
" joe isn
' t happy
!
" adn
" joe isn
' t safe here
!
"
" we need to get joe out of here
!
"
" joe is way too big forthe thta cage
!
" i don
' t know if theese phrases are word forthe word
, bu htey
' re close
. as i said
, the characters here are onyl present as a formality
: htey do little more than state the obvious
( of
* course
* joe is too big for that cage
)
. paxton anbd theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters forthe them
. sadly
, mighty joe young wastes them both
. there are a few clever moments
(
al
though none of them are surfacing inspite my memory at the moment
)
,
and
, as i said
, the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes
. it
' s certainly not a bad film for kids
; i doubt joe iwll give them nightmares
.
but adults in the audience aren
' t likely to find much ofthe anything interesting about the big gerilla
. a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while
; after that
, something needs to be done with the big gorilla
. nobody ever figures out whta to do with tje big gorilla
.
