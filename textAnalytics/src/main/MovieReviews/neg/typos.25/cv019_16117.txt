mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes befor we actually get tothe see a great big gorilla
. his entrende
,
however
, isnt a grand one
: out from the trees he leaps
, gargantuan
anbd imposing
, sporting hands big enough tothe crush a volkswagen bug
,
adn a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball payler will ever have
. joe bellows at the poachers befor him
, angry tyhat they would like tothe kill him
and sell him for millions of dollars
. during this scene
, i turned to my friend
and said
,
" wow
. that ' s smoe ape
.
" joe is quite a gerilla
-
- a big
, digital gerilla
. he runs arund the fields
, chasing cars
annd people
. he picks things uv
and stares at them pensively
. he breaks things on accident
, because he ' s just too big tothe avoid clumsiness
. joe
, as a special effect
, is an omage thta might hold your interest for five minutes
. as a carachter
, he doesn ' t qtuie register
.
and the story he ' s been put in is as limp as they come
. tje words
" family entertainment
" have never beeen a stamp ofthe quality
,
bu might joe young is jstu a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart
. the picture is a remake of the 1949 film
. it ' s mostly just baout the big gorilla
,
but
, strikely as a formality
, the movie allso hasnt a few human characters
. the main one is jill young
( poor charlize theron
, forced to waste her talent
)
, a lover of gorillas
. as a child
, she witnessed a group of poachers muder her mother
; now
, she lives in tjhe jungle to protect tyhe wildlife
. specifically
, she ' s out tothe protect joe
, a giant gorilla who has been her friend usance her childhood
. soon
, zoologist gregg o ' hara
( bill paxton
) discovers joe
; he quickly realizes taht poachers wnat to get joe
and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser
( rade sherbedgia
)
, who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill ' s mother
. so
, infact an effort to save joe
, jill
annd gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve
, where it isnt instantly clear thyat he isnt nto safe fomr poachers
. in addition
, the spoace is way too small for him
( after all
, he is a relaly big gorilla
)
.
adn
, tothe add to the complications
, strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext
( he tells jill that he hasnt a perserve big enough for joe
)
,
and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill ' s mother
. jill
, of course
, doesn ' t recognize strasser
, even
though he did kill her mother
. this is just one ofthe the many examples of stupidity inwhich mighty joe young
, a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film
. the movie isn ' t really offensive
-
- it has some competent actors
, a few nifty sets
,
and a lot of scenes with a big
, digitized gorilla
.
but the story isnt really dumb
, htere aren ' t any charachters
,
anbd tjhe film isn ' t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals
. thge movei also has bad dialogue
. if a critic says thgat a film has bad dialogue
, it ' s only fair tothe quote some of it
,
but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like
" joe isn ' t happy
!
"
and
" joe isn ' t safe here
!
"
" we need to get joe out of here
!
"
" joe isnt way too big forthe that cage
!
" i don ' t know if theese phrases are word fo word
,
but they ' re close
. as i said
, the characters here are only persent as a formality
: they do little more than state the obvious
( of
* course
* joe isnt too big for that cage
)
. paxton
annd theron are talented performers who deserve to work onthe a script that provides cahracters forthe them
. sadly
, mighty joe young wastes them both
. there are a few clever moments
(
although none of them are surfacing in my memmory at the moment
)
,
and
, as i said
, the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes
. it ' s certainly not a bad film for kids
; i dout joe iwll give them nightmares
.
but adults in yhe audience aren ' t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla
. a big gerilla isnt only intresting for a little while
; after that
, something needs tothe be done with teh big gorilla
. nobody ever figures out what tothe do with teh big gerilla
.
