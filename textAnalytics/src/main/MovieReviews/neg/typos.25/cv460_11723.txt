the word tothe decribe sharon stone isnt
" wonder
"
. not that she
_ is
_ a wonder
,
but rather that i wonder how she cxan be so inconsistent
. she has a dynamic screen presense in
" basic instinct
"
, turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in
" casino
"
,
but possesses neither of those here
. stone teams up with private school headmaster
' s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani
' s thoroughly unlikable husb
and
( chazz palminteri
)
. in a comedy of errors
and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock
( as in
` homage tothe
'
[ read
" steal from
"
]
)
, it turns outloud thta someone saw them or he
' s not dead or mabey
.
.
. kathy bates turns in a credible
, if unspectacular
, performence as an investigative police detective
. her character is a bit dull
but realsitic
,
al
though her actions at the end are puzzling
. adjani isnt more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation
. it
' s stone that isnt a disappointment among tje actors
. how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films
and come off as a blank infront thsi one
? costumed in skin
- tight clothes
and looking down her nose at everyone
, she isnt someone you would want to avoid because she is boring
, not enticingly dangerous
. even the threat
( or promise
?
) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is onyl half played out
. on the positive side
, there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive
. that isnt if you cant put uv with stone
' s cardboard cut
- outloud character
and scenes directly lifted from hitch
' s movies
.
