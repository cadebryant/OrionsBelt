the owrd to describe sharon stone isnt
" wonder
"
. not that she
_ is
_ a wonder
,
but rather thgat i wonder how she can be so inconsistent
. she has a dynamic screen presence in
" basic instinct
"
, turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in
" casino
"
,
but possesses neither of thsoe here
. stone teams up with private school headmaster ' s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani ' s throughly unlikable husband
( chazz palminteri
)
. in a comedy of errors
and unexpected twists straight out ofthe hitchcock
( as in
` homage to '
[ read
" steal from
"
]
)
, it turns out that someone saw them or he ' s not dead or maybe
.
.
. kathy bates turns in a credible
, if unspectacular
, performance as an investigative police detective
. her character is a bited dull
bu realistic
,
althought her actions at the end are puzzling
. adjani is moreso than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation
. it ' s stone that is a dissappointment among the actors
. how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previvous films
and come off as a blank inaddition thsi one
? costumed in skin
- tight clothes
annd looking down her nose at everyone
, she isnt someone you would want to avoid because she is boring
, nto enticingly dangerous
. even the threat
( or promise
?
) of a lesbian relationship beetwen the conspirators is onyl half played out
. onthe thte positive side
, there are enough unexpected plot developments tothe keep your interest alive
. thyat is if you can put up wiht stone ' s cardboard cut
- out character
and scenes directly lifted from hitch ' s movies
.
