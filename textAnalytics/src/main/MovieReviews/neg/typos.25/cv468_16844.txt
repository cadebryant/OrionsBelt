" fab 4
" of ronald reagan high are four stuck
- up girls
, plyed by rose mcgowan
, rebecca gayheart
, julie benz
and charlotte roldan
, who overdress like 4 posh spice wannabes
. their daily ritual is to parade up
and down the school halls like royalty
,
and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so htey cxan check thier make
- uv
and pewder their cheeks
. under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in publich
. in writer
and director darren stein
' s jawbreaker
, it isn
' t as funny as it soudns
. in fact
, it isn
' t funny at all
. stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers
and stripped it of any intelligence
, wit or charm
. his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they don
' t hvae tiome to add any emotion
.
and all of his female characters have considerably mroe lipstick than brains
. the setup forthe the movie has one of the fab 4
, liz
, who is erferred to as
" the princess di ofthe reagan high
,
" be killed when a prank by tje otehr 3 goes wrong
. tyhe princess di refernce is in bad taste
, as is much of the movie
. granted
, bad taste can sometimes be funny
, bu tjhe mere presense of bad tast doesn
' t guaratee it
. liz
' s girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth
, tape her mouth shut
,
and stick her bound body in the trunk ofthe a car
. when they oepn the trunk later
, liz is dead
. they eventually put her blue
and bruised body into a sexual position
and make it look liuke liz was the victim of a brutal rape
. these realistic
and disgusting scenes of a dead
, seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget anbd iwll likely turn the stomach of many a viewer
. the film
' s dialog nto only isn
' t funny
, it
' s trite
. one nerdy young girl introduces herself with
" my name is fern mayo
, as in hold the mayo
.
" when fern dicovers what has happend
, the fab 3 make her an offer she can
' t refuse
-
- mkae
- up
! they cake it on her annd welcome her to yhe clan
. the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills fomr watching oprah
. the teachers fare noone better
, especially in tje ridiculous lines they are given
.
" miss shayne
, please cover your bosom
,
" one young teacher
, who has been made uv to look old
and ugly
, says without any conviction
.
" this is a learning institution
, not a brothel
.
" besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made
, there is one otehr question thyat i
' d liuke to ask the directer
. why do ytou have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of tghe number anyway
? in a cameo
, pam grier plays detective vera cruz
, who investigates liz
' s murder
. as she interrogates the other people
, she stares at them liek they are all idiots
, proving that she is the only oney that gets it
. i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movei
, she
' d walk out aftter about 5 mintues
,
and yuo
' d be well advised to do the smae if you should happen to find yourself in a theather showing it
. jawbreaker runs 1
: 27
. it is rated r for violence
, gore
, profanity
and sex
. i would advise everyone to avoid it
,
but if teenagers go they shoudln be older adn mature
.
