a pseudo
- intelectual film baout the pseudo
- intelectual world of art magazines
, high art isnt as wasted as its drug
- addled protaganists
. inwhich the onyl noteable part of the movie
, ally sheedy
and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles
, not that lisa cholodenko ' s script or direction makse you care much about eather character
. living inthe a world of heroin induced highs
, tehy float allong until they fall in love wtih each otehr
. this uninviting picture
, full of pretentious minor characters
, has a receptionist that reads dostoevski
and a woman in the restroom line who isnt a certified genius
, having recently been awared a prestigious mcarthur grant
. 24
- year
- old syd
( radha mitchell
)
, who has a rather bland
, live
- in boyfriend
, was jsut promoted to assistant editor at tghe artistic photography magasine
" frame
.
"
allthough the receptionist is impressed
, syd isnt mailny a gofer fo her boss unitl she meets famouse photographer lucy berliner
( ally sheedy
)
. for her tothe do photos for
" frame
,
" lucy demands that syd be promotted to editor
annd assigned to her sicne lucy fancies her
. lucy lives with her currrent lover
, a washed uv german actress named greta
, plyed iwth a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson
. the two ofthe them
and their friends wile away their tyme snorting
anbd shooting up dope
, usally heroin
. this does nto happen in a single episode
,
bu becomes moreso commonplace than sleeping in the picture
. syd
, who lives infact tje apartment below them
, joins in on the fun
and becomes a member of the zombie club
. lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs
, whitch apparently is funded by her mother
. lucy quit wroking professionally 10 yersa ago since she thought she was bieng
" pigeonholed
,
"
and
, since her mother hasnt money
, we can only assume thast that ' s how lucy supports her habbits
and procures her living expenses
. a typcial scene has thge editors arguing about whther a potential photographer ' s work is transcendental or mearly classical
. that noone one hasnt a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious
but not particularly funny
.
" your work hasnt a cultural currency tath is important nowe
,
" isnt the artist
- speak that the frame ' s manager uses tothe convince lucy to show her pictures infront tghe magazine
. when yhe big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves onthe syd
, her idea of a rumatic line is
,
" i want to git high with you
.
" infront lucy ' s world
, sex
and drugs come hand
- in
- hand
.
adn hte movei
, except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing
, shows drug usage as being a hip
adn natural part of the art scene
. this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions
. in anohter movie
, it might have worked
,
but in this noe the reaction is likely tothe be decidely muted
. high art runs 1
: 36
. it is rated r forthe explicit sex
, pervasive drug uise
and language
and isnt not appropriate for those yuonger than college age
.
