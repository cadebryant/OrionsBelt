a pseudo
- intellectual film about yhe pseudo
- intellectual world ofthe art magazines
, high art is as wasted as its drug
- addled protagonists
. in the only notable part of the movie
, ally sheedy
and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles
, not that lisa cholodenko
' s script or direction makes you care much about either character
. living in a world of heroin induced highs
, they float along until htey fall in love with each otehr
. thsi uninviting picture
, full of pretentious minor cahracters
, hasnt a receptionist that reads dostoevski annd a woman in the restroom line who isnt a certified genius
, having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant
. 24
- year
- ood syd
( radha mitchell
)
, who hasnt a rather bl
and
, live
- in boyfriend
, was just promotted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine
" frame
.
" altough tje receptionist is empressed
, syd isnt mainly a gofer forthe her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner
( ally sheedy
)
. for her to do photos fo
" frame
,
" lucy dem
ands thast syd be promoted to editor adn assigned to her since lucy fancies her
. lucy lives with her currrent lover
, a washed uv german actress named greta
, played witht a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson
. the two ofthe them anbd their friends wile away their time snorting
and shooting up dope
, ususally heroin
. htis does nto happen inwhich a single episode
,
but becomes mroe commonplace than sleeping in the picture
. syd
, who lives in the appartmant below them
, joins in on the fun
and becomes a member of yhe zombie club
. lucy seems pretty happy with her life ofthe drugs
, which apparently isnt funded by her mother
. lucy quit working professionally 10 eyasr ago since she
thought she was being
" pigeonholed
,
"
and
, since her mother has omney
, we can only assume that taht
' s how lucy supports her habit
and procures her living expenses
. a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer
' s owrk isnt transcendental or merely clasical
. taht noone one has a clue as tothe the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious
but not particularly funny
.
" your work has a cultural currency that isnt important now
,
" isnt thte artist
- speak that hte frame
' s manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine
. when the big scene comes infront wich lucy puts the moves on syd
, her idea ofthe a rumatic line is
,
" i want to get high with ytou
.
" in lucy
' s world
, sex
and drugs come h
and
- inwhich
- h
and
.
and the movie
, except for the obligatory scene of someone allmost overdosing
, shows drug useage as being a hip
and naturual part of the art scene
. this vacuous picture throws inspite a st
andart downer ending inthe an attempt to manipulate our emotions
. in anyother movie
, it might hve worked
,
but inspite this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted
. high art runs 1
: 36
. it isnt rated r for explicit sex
, pervasive drug use
and language anbd is nto appropriate fo those younger tahn college age
.
