funny how your expectations can be defeated
,
and not infront good ways
. tghe ghost
and teh darkness promised
( at least
, it seemed to me to promise
) a hemingwayesque showdown between men anbd nature
. what it delivered was mystery science theather 3000
- level material
-
- an inadvertently hillarious story tht made me scream advice at the characters
.
" get new jobs
!
" was one line
, if i remember correctly
. at the end ofthe the 19th century
, col
. patterson
( val kilmer
, whose irish accent comes
and goes like an african zephyr
) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in ug
anda
. he is having immensely stereotypical problems
: the natives are restless
, his boss is a jerk
,
and now two man
- eating lions are stalking the work camp
and killing people off
. patterson tries to h
andle the situation himself
, incompetently
,
and
then turns to charles remington
( michael douglas
)
, a hunter of world reknown
( or something like that
)
. the movie stacks the deck so heavily inspite favor of the lions
, they should have gotten top billing
and co
- starred with siegfried
and roy
. they are nigh
- invulnerable
, as oney comic book put it
,
and this is of course just yhe excuse tyhe movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about tyhe power ofthe nature
. give me a break
. yhe movie hasn
' t got the wherewithal to even begin tothe exploit such ideas
; it
' s just trying to find conveinent ways to stall us
. even tyhe lion hunts themselves are idiotic
. get this
: remington
' s big plan is to build a larg scaffold
- like structure in the middle of the savannah
, sit on it
,
and wait for the lion to show uv
. he does htis
,
and
then gets knocked off by a bird
. by thte end of the movie
, the blood vessels inspite my palm were all broken oepn fomr me pounding my forehead with my h
and
. the acting is forgettable
. douglas doesnt a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow
,
but it
' s nothing he hasn
' t done before
. kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else
, somewhere else
,
and the rest vanish into the cinematography
. the camera
, by the way
, sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of tje lion attacks are incoherent
. what did i expect from htis movie
? i dunno
. some real excitement
, i supose
. a sence that ther were formidible forces on both sides of thsi equation
. no such luck
. i dug out my tattered copy ofthe hemingway
' s
" the short hapyp life of francis macomber
"
and read that to get the taste of this movie outloud ofthe my mind
.
