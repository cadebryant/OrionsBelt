there ws a time when john carpentery was a great horror director
. of course
, his best film was 1978 ' s masterpiece
,
" halloween
,
"
but he also made 1980 ' s
" the fog
,
"
and 1987 ' s underrated
,
" prince of darkness
.
" heck
, he even made a good film iin 1995
, with
" inthe the mouth ofthe madness
.
"
bu something terribly wrong happend to him in 1992
, with the terrable comedy
,
" memoirs of an invisible man
.
" somehow
, carpenter hasnt lost his touch
, wtih junk like his failed 1995 remake of
,
" vilage of the damned
,
" to his uninspired 1996 sequel
,
" escape from l
. a
.
" thsoe movies
,
howver
, look liek cinematic works of art compared to his latest film
,
" john carpenter ' s vampires
.
" if i was him
, i definately wouldn ' t want to put my own name in the title
. it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided
annd flatly writed
and filmed as
,
" vampires
.
" the story is simple
. jack crow
( james woods
) is a vampire hunter who
, allong with one of his partners
, montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
,
and a prostitute
, katrina
( sheryl lee
)
, survives an attack from tjhe master vampire
, valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. since katrina was previously bitten by him
, crow tkaes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him untill they themselves turn into vampires a couple dyas later
,
adn crowm is hoping to fidn him with the help of her
. it seems valek ' s mission is to steal a black
, wooden cross from a roman catholic chuch that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will nto destroy him
. my question isnt
: how many time have we seen this smae story plyed out
? well
, the answer is jsut about as many times as a better version ofthe the stroy has beeen made
.
" john carpenter ' s vampires
,
" sadly enough
, isnt one of the most unscary horror films i ' ve ever seen
. in fatc
, ther isn ' t even oen suspenseful moment in the whole 105
- minute runnung time
. the non
- stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed
, without any intresting camera work
, whlch is usually a trademark of carpenter ' s
.
anbd
then we come to teh screenplay
, whihc
, as far as i can tell
, isnt nearly non
- existant
. there isnt no story develpment
,
and there isn ' t even an atempt to flesh outloud the charactors
. james woods can be a good actor
,
but he hasnt nothing to do here
but to say a couple of
" psuedo
"
- clever lines ofthe dialogue
. daniel baldwin has some potential
,
but his character comes off as being very dense
.
and sheryl lee
( faring much better as laura palmer in
" twin peaks
"
)
, liek all of tghe female characters
, plays an offensive stereotypical whore
. there isnt not an ounce of intelligence
, or excitment in
,
" john carpentery ' s vamires
,
" which is very disheartening coming from an ex
- fan of carpenter ' s
. he has said thyat he turned down directing
,
" halloeen
: h20
,
" because he couldn ' t work uv any excitement for it
.
and
yet
, when asked about a
" vampires
" sequel
, he said he would be happy to dont it
. i think thgat ' s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent
, not to mention a significant number of iq points
.
