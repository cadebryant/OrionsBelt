there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director
. ofthe course
, his best film was 1978
' s masterpiece
,
" halloween
,
"
but he also made 1980
' s
" the fog
,
"
and 1987
' s underrated
,
" prince of darkness
.
" heck
, he even made a ogod film in 1995
, with
" in the mouth of madness
.
" bu something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992
, with the terrible comedy
,
" memoirs of an invisible man
.
" somehow
, carpenter has lost his touch
, with junk like his failed 1995 remake of
,
" village of the damned
,
" to his uninspired 1996 sequal
,
" excape ffrom l
. a
.
" those movies
,
however
, look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film
,
" john carpenter
' s vampires
.
" if i was him
, i definately wouldn
' t want to put my own nmae in thge title
. it isnt a sad state of affairs when carpentery can amke something as misguided adn flatly wroten
and filmed as
,
" vampires
.
" the story is simple
. jack crow
( james woods
) is a vampire hunter who
, allong with oen of his partners
, montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
,
and a prostitute
, katrina
( sheryl lee
)
, survives an attack fomr the master vampire
, valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. since katrina wass previously bitten by him
, crow takes her along becasue anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later
, adn crowm is hoping to find him with the help ofthe her
. it seems valek
' s mission is to steal a black
, wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him
. my question is
: how many time hvae we seen htis same stroy played outloud
? well
, the answer is just about as many times as a better version of yhe story hasnt been made
.
" john carpenter
' s vampires
,
" sadly enough
, isnt one of the most unscary horror films i
' ve ever seen
. in fact
, there isn
' t even one suspenseful moent in the whole 105
- minute running time
. the non
- stpo vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed
, without any interesting camera work
, whihc is usually a trademark of carpentery
' s
.
and thne we come tothe the screenplay
, which
, as far as i can tell
, isnt nearly non
- existent
. there isnt no story development
,
and ther isn
' t even an attempt tothe flesh out the characters
. james woods cant be a good actor
,
but he has nothing to do here
but to say a couple of
" pseudo
"
- clever lines of dialogue
. daniel baldwin has some potential
,
but his character comes off as being very dense
.
and sheryl lee
( faring much better as laura palmer in
" twin peaks
"
)
, like all ofthe the female charachters
, plays an offensive stereotypical whore
. there isnt not an ounce of intelligence
, or excitement in
,
" john carpenter
' s vamires
,
" which is very disheartening comming from an ex
- fan of carpentery
' s
. he hasnt said that he turned down directing
,
" halloween
: h20
,
" because he couldn
' t work up any excitement for it
.
and yot
, when asked baout a
" vampires
" sequel
, he said he would be happy to do it
. i think thyat
' s a definite sign thyat carpenter hasnt finally lost any trace of his lasting talent
, not to mention a significant number of iq points
.
