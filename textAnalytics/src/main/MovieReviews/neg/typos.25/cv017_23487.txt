so whta dont you get when you mix together plot elements ffrom varous successful sci
- fi films such as close encounters ofthe the thrid kind
, 2001
: a space odyssey
, apollo 13
anbd contact
? well
, whatever it is
, you ' d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than tihs shoddy attempt at such a melange
, considering the disastrous results we ' re left wiht here
. this is a film that takes a little bit of everything
,
but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing
! it ' s liek i said
.
.
. htis movie sucks
. plot
: a rescure crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in thge year 2020
, after an unkown energy force leads to a loss of contact wih the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet
. critique
: extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie
. uneven
, owudl be another
. the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise
, tjhe buzz arround it had beeen so
- so
,
and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes
, all leading ytou tothe belivee that it ' s acutally going tothe go
" somewhere
"
.
bu it isn ' t long before the entire movie downshifts inot nutral
, features more spoace walks than anytying intresting onthe thte cherry
- colored planet
, trys too hard to git us into the
" pain
" of soem its characters
and unsuccessfully tosses some romance inot hte mix
. in a sci
- fi movie
? well
, i don ' t know
, much of it just seemed liek a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for baout an hour
annd a half
, only to figure out some big secret infact the end
, a secret which practically hadnt me yawning with excitement
. ultimatly
, this is a movei that starts off with a decent premise
, joins the crew in their
" misadventures in spoace
" for yhe main crux of its journey
,
and eventually settles down for one of tjhe most anti
- climactic endings htis side ofthe contact
. mind you
, if you enjoyed that film ' s shrug
- of
- hte
- shoulders ending
, ytou might jsut enjoy tihs frivolous ditty as well
. of course
, i don ' t remeber contact having such obvious
anbd painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end ofthe story
. ugh
. what a friggin ' mess
. films like this generally get me wondering baout the brass inaddition hollywood again
. didn ' t anybody recogise the crappiness in thsi script
? didn ' t they read the bad dialogue
, the cheezy lines
, the obvious deriviative nature ofthe the wrok
( mind you
, iwth a director like depalma at the helm
, that ain ' t saying much
!
)
. of course
, you can ' t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o ' connell infront tihs fine crew of thespians
. ' nuff said
. neither can you blame them for depalma cranking uv the juice onthe the film ' s musical score during the lastr fifteen minutes
, presumably in order to wake teh audience uv
( okay
, we get it brian
, this scene isnt supposed to be powerful
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so is anytying salvageable in this movie
? sure
. gary sinise does another great job
, as does cheadle
, the film doesn ' t completely bore you as much as it just moves allong slowly wihtout anything really interesting happening
,
and yes
, the
" sand
- twister
" effect that you see in the commerical isnt well done
. other than that
? i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies
.
.
. oops
, did i say
" admire
"
, i meant
" am disgusted
"
! all inthe all
, this movei delivers very little in actuall substance
, offers two
- bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci
- fi mumbo
- jumbo
, pretends to be deep when really it ' s just sappy
,
annd eventually just settles into an ending which
, other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story
, gives us little more to think baout than how we might be able tothe get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck
. go see the nineth gate
.
.
. now there ' s a great movie
!
anbd on a personel onot
, i think it ' s tiome for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12
- minute uninterruped film sequences
,
and strat worrying more baout how crappy his movies are getting
.
