so what do you git wehn you mix together plot elements ffrom vairous successful sci
- fi films such as close encounters ofthe tyhe third kind
, 2001
: a spoace odyssey
, apollo 13
and contact
? well
, whatever it is
, you
' d sure as hell hope that it would be a thous
and times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange
, considering the disastrous results we
' re left with here
. this is a film that tkaes a little bited of everything
,
but ultimately adds up to a lot ofthe nothing
! it
' s liek i said
.
.
. this movie sucks
. plot
: a rescure crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in thte eyar 2020
, after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previvous gang of space aviators to visit tjhe red planet
. critique
: extrememly underwhelming isnt tjhe best way to describe this movie
. uneven
, woudl be another
. the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise
, the buzz around it hadnt been so
- so
,
and even the film itself starts off wiht a decent first twenty minutes
, all leading yuo to believe that it
' s actually going to go
" somewhere
"
.
but it isn
' t long befoer the entire movie downshifts into neutral
, features moreso space walks thna anything interesting on the cherry
- colored planet
, trys too hard tothe git us into thge
" pain
" ofthe some its characters
and unsuccessfully tosses smoe romance into the mix
. in a sci
- fi movie
? well
, i don
' t know
, much ofthe it jsut seemed liuke a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for baout an hour adn a half
, only to figure out some big secret in the end
, a secert which practically hadnt me yawning witht excitement
. ultimately
, this isnt a movie that starts off with a decent premise
, joins teh crew in their
" misadventures infact space
" for tyhe main crux of its journey
,
and eventually settles down for one of the most anti
- climactic endings this side of contact
. mind you
, if you enjoyed that film
' s shrug
- ofthe
- the
- shoulders ending
, you might jstu enjoy this frivolous ditty as well
. of course
, i don
' t remember contact having such obvious
and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story
. ugh
. what a friggin
' mess
. films like this generally get me wondering about the brass inaddition hollywood again
. didn
' t anybody recognize the crappiness in thsi script
? didn
' t they read the bad dialogue
, the cheezy lines
, tjhe obvious derivative nature of tjhe owrk
( mind you
, wiht a directer liek depalma at the helm
, tath ain
' t saying much
!
)
. of course
, you can
' t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o
' connell infront this fine crew of thespians
.
' nuff said
. neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice onthe the film
' s musical score during teh lastr fifteen minutes
, presumabely in order to wake the audeince up
( okay
, we get it brian
, this scene is supposed to be powerful
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so is anything salvageable in this movei
? sure
. gary sinise doesnt anohter great job
, as doens cheadle
, the film doesn
' t completelyl bore you as much as it just moves along slowy wihtout anytying really intresting happening
,
and yes
, the
" s
and
- twister
" effect that you see in the commercial isnt well done
. other than tht
? i guess i could say thast i admire how filmmakers have become so much mroe devious infact their product placement strategies
.
.
. oops
, doed i say
" admire
"
, i meant
" am disgusted
"
! all in all
, this movie delivers very littel in actual substance
, offers two
- bited dialogue masked in a lot ofthe sci
- fi mumbo
- jumbo
, pretends to be deep whn really it
' s just sappy
,
and eventually just settles into an ending which
, other thna presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story
, gives us littel more to think about than how we might be able to git our money back forthe sitting through thsi rehashed dreck
. go see the ninth gate
.
.
. now htere
' s a great movie
!
and on a personal onot
, i think it
' s time for depalma tothe stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12
- minute uninterrupted film sequences
,
and start worrying more baout how crappy his movies are getting
.
