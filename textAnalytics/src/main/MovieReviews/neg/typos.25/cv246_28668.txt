darren
( jason biggs
)
, wayne
( steve zahn
)
, adn j
. d
.
( jack black
) have been best friends sicne thge fifth grade
. like the three musketeers
, they
' ve been together through thick
and thin
.
but
, wehn darren meets an attractive
,
but cold
- blooded
and manipulative
, psychiatrist
, judith
( am
anda peet
)
, the long tiome friendship is placed inthe danger
. it
' s up to wayne
and j
. d
. to rescue their best freind in
" saving silverman
.
"
" silverman
" has its heart in the right place
, bu the story
, by newcomers hank nelken anbd greg depaul
, is too lightweight to sustain tyhe tale of tjhe battle for darren
' s soul
. based on their experience of a freind making a major marital misteek
, teh stoy isnt centered on tje threee
, life long amigos
. wehn wayne introduces darren to judith
, he doesn
' t realize that he has opened a p
andora
' s box of disaster for himself anbd j
. d
. judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend wass tyhe dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match
. since
then
, she hasnt seeked a new mate
- somone she can boss around
and mold into her own vision
. enter darren silverman
. once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement
, wayne
and j
. d
. try everything they can
, including threats
and bribery
, to git judith tothe free darren
. nothing works until the duo come uv iwth a plan
- kidnap judith
and get darren back toghether wiht the girl he called his one annd only
, pretty s
andy perkus
( am
anda detmer
)
. tjhe only problem here is that s
andy is about tothe take her vows to become a nun
. things spiral outloud of controll as judith repeatedly attempts tothe escape while wayne annd j
. d
. play cupid
. the boys even bring thier idol
, neil diamond
, into the picture tothe help resolve things
. thinking baout it
, this is a real mishmash of contrivance anbd coinsidence that is held together solely by tjhe commedic efforts of steve zahn
and jack black
. thte pair isnt able tothe elicit the film
' s onyl laughs with their goofy antics
and child
- like behavior
. they are relagated to providing slapstick guy humor annd tyhe two are more than equal tothe the task
. steve zahn has beeen steadily honing his comedic acting skills anbd gives some complexity tothe wayne
, the
" brains
" ofthe the gang
. jack black has tyhe big
- guy moves of a chris farley
, giving j
. d
. an amusing fysical presence
. the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material
. the rest ofthe thge casted doesn
' t fare as well
,
though
. jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers
and gets veyr little to do
;
though hvaing watched his previous films
(
" american pie
" adn
" losr
"
) i
' m not sure wqat attraction biggs actually has
. am
anda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith
. there is no humanity at all to her character as she single
- mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind
' s image
. she
' s a monster that wayne
and j
. d
. must defeat to save their friend
. unfortunately
, ther is noone dimention to her charactor
. am
anda detmer brings nothing
( or gets nothing
) as darren
' s oen adn only
. r
. lee ermey
, as the psychotic coach
, made a bad decision taking this role
. tune
- meister neil dimond gives a ogod
- natured cameo perf as tjhe boys
' idol
and savior
. prodcution values are on par with the rest of the film
- lacklustre
and non
- involving
. directer dennis dugan has a trcak record for broad comedy with films like
" big daddy
"
and
" beverly hills ninja
,
"
but falls flat with
" saveing silverman
.
" tyhe 2001 movie year has
yet to provide us with a
" good
" film to sink our teeth into
. at least
, with
" saving silverman
,
" we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn
and balck
. too bad tyhat tghe rest ofthe yhe film lacks their levle ofthe humer
. kick boxing deaths
and conflicted nuns are not the makings ofthe a good comedy
. i give it a c
