thge first film produced by adam s
andler
' s hapyp madison production company
( clever title eh
?
) is essentialy a one joke movie
, much like the movies s
andler stars in himself
.
however the difference here is thta htis one joke jstu isn
' t very funny
. rob schneider stars as teh title character
, a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becomeing a
" man
- whore
" to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client
' s custom made fish tank
, which deuce destroyed while staying inwhich his hmeo
. deuce goes on numerous
" dates
"
, adn each woman he goes out with has a
" humorous
" quirk about herself
. oney has narcolepsy
, one has tourette
' s syndrome
, oen is a man
.
.
. etc
. etc
. my probelm is that we see all of theese women in the film
' s trailer
, so why dont i need to watch the movie
? seen tje trailer
.
.
. seen the film
. onyl a quick cameo from norm macdonald
(
and a follow uv joke during the closing credits
) generates any chuckles
. deuce bigalow
: male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video
( a division ofthe di
$ ney
)
. the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
,
and features the orginal theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for mistery alaska
, happy texas
, anbd outside providence
)
, an extremely brief production featurette
( wich containes footage not used infact the film
)
,
and storyboard
- tothe
- scene comparisons
. yep
, you read tyhat right
.
.
. ther are storyboard comparisons on this dvd
. twpo scenes are storyboarded
.
.
. niether of which are particularly exicting
. there are fight scenes inwhich thsi movei
, so why aren
' t we seing storyboards ofthe those segments
( especially teh parody moments from thte matrix
)
? i wonder what
' s funnier
: the fact thast any moment in tihs film required storyboards or that di
$ ney
thought fans ofthe this film would want to see them
? deleted scenes
