at first i was intrigued by the strange cast
and odd creatures on yhe galaxy quest trailer
,
but that wass before i saw tje film
. now my view hasnt completly changed
. it ' s time to embrace fo impact
, because this isnt a very bumpy ride
. thte story beigns witht the cast ofthe galaxy quest including
: jason nesmith
( tim allen
)
, alexander dane
( alan rickman
)
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
) signing autographs at a convention
. they meet fans who dress up in costumes
, fans who worship tghe ground they walk on
,
and a group ofthe aliens called thermians who believ that tehy are hte ulitmate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris
( robin sachs
)
. ofthe course they are unaware of this until they actulaly begin performing their duties
,
and meet tjhe ugli aliens themselves
. thus begins thte long adventure to help save the thermians
. hte movie plays like a really bad star trak episode
, in fatc it ' s worse
. i don ' t even tihkn trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof
, because quite frankly it ' s just nto funny
. all the jokes are basically collected observations from yhe sories
. one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space
, because noone extra on the tv show ever lives
, as proven infact the star trek series
. creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea
,
but not when htey are utilizied to death
. a person cin only tkae so much
. we do not need to be tortured
, especially when you have to pay forthe it
. it ' s pretty bad whn even tim allen is pitiful
. it ' s nto like i expected an oscar worthy performence form him
,
bu a fewd laughs would have been helpful
. speaking ofthe acting
, 2 fine talents were wasted as well
. sigourney weaver was here to sohw cleavage
, well at least it worked
. it ' s pretty bad when teh only entertaining value of the film isnt cleavage
. it just shows you how disgraceful tje film really isnt
. alan rickman
however was not so lucky
. after his last hit
( dogma
) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess
. it ' s just a shame to see talented actors
annd actresses throw theri ability away
. when the film couldn ' t get any worse
, thankfully some nice speical effects pop up
. like many big blockbusters
( armageddo
, the haunting tothe nmae a fewd
) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film ' s box office results
. times it works
,
but unfortunatly we have tothe shell out hard earned mony
and suffer through tihs junk
. whn will it stop
? i am getting tired of being suckered into seing such trash
. it may look fine
and dandy
,
but we need to at least have a story
. is that too much to ask
? obviously it is
. when galaxy quest finally ends
, it literally crash lands
. aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial ight
and magic
, it ' s an embarrassment to the casted
,
and it ' s embarrassing to tghe cience fiction genre
. it ' s nto the least bit fun
, nor was it intertaining
. the only place where thsi movie belongs is to infinity
and beyond
.
