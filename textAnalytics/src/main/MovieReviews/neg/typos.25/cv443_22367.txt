at first i wass intrigued by the stange cast
and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer
, bu thast was before i saw the film
. now my view has completely changed
. it
' s time to embrace for impact
, becuase this isnt a very bumpy ride
. the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including
: jason nesmith
( tim allen
)
, alex
ander dane
( alan rickman
)
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
) signing autographs at a convention
. htey meet fans who dress up in costumes
, fans who worship the ground they walk on
, anbd a group of aliens called thermians who believe that htey are the ulitmate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris
( robin sachs
)
. of course they are unaware of this until they actualyl beign performing thier duties
,
and meet the ugly aliens themselves
. thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians
. the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode
, in fact it
' s worse
. i don
' t even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof
, because qutie frankly it
' s just not funny
. all yhe jokes are basically collected observations ffrom the series
. one such continuous joke involves a simple crew memeber who believes he will die in space
, because no extra onthe tghe tv show ever lives
, as proven in the star trak series
. creative jokes liek this may seem liuke a clever idea
,
but not wehn they are used tothe death
. a person can only tkae so much
. we do not need tothe be tortured
, especially when you have tothe pay for it
. it
' s pretty bad whn even tim allen is pitiful
. it
' s not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him
, bu a few laughs owudl have beeen helpfull
. speaking of acting
, 2 fine talents were wasted as well
. sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage
, well at least it worked
. it
' s pretty bad whn tje onyl intertaining value of tyhe film is cleavage
. it jsut shows you how disgraceful tghe film realyl is
. alan rickman
however was not so lucky
. after his lsat hit
( dogma
) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess
. it
' s just a shame to see talented actors annd actresses throw thier ability away
. when the film couldn
' t get any worse
, thankfully some nice spacial effects pop uv
. like many big blockbusters
( armageddon
, the haunting to name a few
) they rely heavily on effects to halp boost thte film
' s box office results
. times it works
,
but unfortunately we have tothe shell outloud hard earned moey
and suffer through this junk
. when will it stop
? i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash
. it may look fine
and d
andy
,
but we ened to at least have a tsory
. isnt thyat too much tothe ask
? obviously it is
. when galaxy quest fianlly ends
, it literally crash l
ands
. asside ffrom the impressive looking creatures from indutrial light
and magic
, it
' s an embarrasment to the cast
, annd it
' s embarrassing to hte science fiction genre
. it
' s not the least bit fun
, nor was it intertaining
. the only place where tihs movei belongs is to infinity
and beyond
.
