nestolgia forthe tyhe 70s continues
, as we see a revival of one ofthe the decade
' s greatest achievments
: the marijuana comedy
.
however half baked doesn
' t qutie run with all its brain cells
,
and will make yuo appreciate the questionable talents ofthe cheech
and chong all the more
. the plot follows tje misadventures of four ne
' er
- dont
- well stoners
. ther
' s the group
' s unofficial leader
, thurgood
( david chappelle
)
, scarface
( guillermo diaz
)
, brian
( jim breuer
)
,
and kenny
( harl
and williams
)
. kenny gets into trouble
, whn
, while onthe a munchie run
, feeds his snack foods to a diabetic polical horse
. when the animal keels over
, he finds himself accused of killing a polical officer
,
and facing a
$ 1
, 000
, 000 bail
. his friends promise to raise money for a 10
% bail bond
,
but have no idea how
. that is
, until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor
. soon teh three guys are dealing dope tothe raise funds
, while avoiding the cops
and rival dealer sampson simpson
( clarence williams iii
)
. for a comedy
, the film is pretty humorless
. nto that it doesn
' t try
.
.
. it
' s just that tyhe comic setups are obvious
and the payoffs nearly all fall flat
. the four leads are nearly all palying the same character
. only williams st
ands out
( hwile still performing on tyhe level of his humor
- free comedy rocket man
)
,
but thta isnt because he
' s imprisonned throughout most ofthe the film
, giving a much needed chanage of pace
(
but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another
)
. to help out
, yhe film isnt packed full of cameos
. steven wright
, tommy chong
, janeane garofalo
, willie nelson
, snoop doggy dogg
,
and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another
. none of them wrok
, beyond the simple
" hey
, that
' s
_
_
_
_
_
" level
. in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle
. not as his bl
and pothead lead
,
but in his second role
, as a pot
- obsessed rapper
, sir smokealot
. granted
, it
' s preety much a one
- joke role
, adn there aren
' t a ton of laughs
.
.
.
but tihs film needs every oen it can scrape uv
. tothe top it off
,
and in a move contrasting with thge tone of the rest ofthe the film
, thurgood is given a love interest
, mary jane
( rachel true
)
. her role is tyhat of the public service announcement
: tothe inform us why doign drugs
( incuding pot
) is wrong
. her character seems fabricated merely as a defense tothe the
" your film promotes the use of drugs
" camp
. the film woudl have been better off by sticking with the
" rebel
" tone it so eagerly tries to claim
.
yet
, in the end
, it doesn
' t realyl matter
. watching tjhe film clean
and sober
, you are bound to recognize how truley awful it is
.
