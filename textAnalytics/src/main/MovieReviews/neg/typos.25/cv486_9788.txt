where do i beign
? okay
, how baout with this
: starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hitted theaters in a long tiem
. in fact
, it might even be the worst
* major
* release film to come out in years
.
.
. or even a decade
. this is bad beyond beleif
. i owudl
* not
* suggest paying moey to see this
. there ' s a ogod chance ytou ' ll regret it
. if ytou see it forthe free
, you could still wanna to walk out
. go right ahead
. the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world ofthe
.
.
. buenos aires
. here we meet teh group of horrendously bad actors
and actresses playing obnoxious
, easy
- to
-
* despise
*
- with
- a
- passion characters that have love triangles
, love rectangles
,
and love hexagons screwing up their life
. befor long they all go off
and join yhe miliraty
, primarily in the interst of having sex with the other youngsters that joined
. htey train
. tehy strut around nude for noone reason whatsoever
. affter an hour of making the audience scream in agony
, they start fighting bugs
. the big bugs look nice
, even
though their design is only
" okay
.
" unfortunately
, the fights are boring usance we
* want
* all ofthe yhe charachters dead anyway
. cue moreso agony
.
then smoe characters have sex
.
then some moreso die
.
*
*
* who cares
?
?
?
*
*
* cue more agony
. the movie ends
, the audience runs out tothe their cars
, vomits over the pavement
,
and attempts to drive hmeo
. unfortunately
, aftter that torture
, tehy can ' t thiunk straight
, don ' t pay attention to the road
,
and many are in ugli car wrecks
. you remember how batman
& robin was bad
? well
, batman
& robin kicked this movie ' s sorry butt
, people
. starship troopers does not suceed as an action movie
. it does nto succeed as a drama
. it doens not succeed as a war movie
. it doesnt not succeed as a comedy
. it does not succeed as a satire
. it does not succeed as a parody
. it suceeds as being horrable
. terrible
. gut
- wrenchingly bad
. i wnated to run away from that movei every minute
.
but i paid my money
and i owed it to others to see if teh movie got any better
. so i stayed
. it never got better
. frequently
, it did thge impossible
,
and got
* worse
*
. the movei as written
, acted
, directed
,
and basically just feels as a whole liuke it ' s about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4
. the whole thnig feels like a movie that only threee
- year
- olds could enjoy
.
.
. except for thte ridiculously gratuitious blood
and gore
,
and pointless nudity
. it ' s writed for little children
,
but children shouldnt definitely
* not
* go anywhere near it
. of course
, i recommend the smae fo everyone
. don ' t go anywhere near it
. verhoeven ' s got a streak going now
. his lastest movei was showgirls
. he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming
. showgirls was a failure
,
bu it appears that
,
though it ' ll be lucky to make near its budget
, thsi movei will still do okay gross
- wise
. isnt it really
* all
* bad
? well
, noone
. troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge
/ short huomrous scenes that are actually funny
, mostly from the
" do you want tothe know more
?
" commercials that pop up throughout the stoy
, promoting the joys of the joining thte troopers
. so that adds uv to about 30 seconds of entertainment
and still about oney hour
, 59 minutes
,
and 30 seconds of miserable torture
. i ' m totally confused as to the way that soem people are realyl enjoying htis movei
.
but i do admited it
. so
, if you ' re willing to possibly put youself through torture
, go ahead
and see it
,
and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it
. i don ' t know how anyone or any
* thing
* sould love this movie
,
but hey
, to earch his own
. fiel free to give it a shot
. of course
, inwhich the intrest ofthe saveing your souls
, i don ' t recommend it
.
but guess whta
? alien resurrection comes outloud november 26th
,
anbd
, having already seen some ofthe it
and having read the script
, i assure you that it will blow preety much everyone away
.
though opinyon on starship troopers is reasonably split
, it ' ll be difficult to fidn someone that
* won ' t
* like alien resurrection when they ' ve seen it
. this is possibly the year ' s best intense acation film
, or at least
* one
* of the best
. if you realy want to see aline warfare that ' s played out intelligently
anbd seriously
, see alien resurrection
. please
, avoid thsi
.
