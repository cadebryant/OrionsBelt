where do i begin
? okay
, how baout with this
: starship troopers is oen of the worst movies to hitted theaters in a long tyme
. in fact
, it might even be the worst
* major
* realease film to come out in years
.
.
. or even a decade
. this is bad beyond beleif
. i woudl
* not
* suggest paying money to see this
. there
' s a good chance you
' ll regret it
. if you see it forthe free
, you could still want to walk outloud
. go right ahead
. tje movei starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes setted inwhich the future world ofthe
.
.
. buenos aires
. here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors annd actresses playing obnoxious
, easy
- tothe
-
* descize
*
- with
- a
- passion characters thta have love triangles
, love rectangles
,
and love hexagons screwing uv theri life
. before long they all go off
and join the military
, primarily infront tjhe interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined
. tehy train
. they strut around nude forthe noone reason whatsoever
. after an hour ofthe making the audience scream inaddition agony
, they start fighting bugs
. the big bugs look nice
, even
though their design isnt onyl
" okay
.
" unfortunately
, tjhe fights are boring since we
* want
* all of the characters dead anyway
. cue more agony
.
then some characters have sex
.
then smoe mroe die
.
*
*
* who cares
?
?
?
*
*
* cue more agony
. tjhe movei ends
, the audience runs out to their cars
, vomits over tyhe pavement
, anbd attemts to drive home
. unfortunately
, after tht torture
, tehy can
' t think straight
, don
' t pay attention tothe the road
, anbd many are inaddition ugly car wrecks
. you remember how batman
& robin was bad
? well
, batman
& robin kicked this movei
' s sory
butt
, peple
. starship troopers does not succeed as an acation movei
. it does not succeed as a drama
. it does nto succeed as a war movie
. it doesnt nto sucsede as a comedy
. it does not succeed as a satire
. it doesnt not suceed as a parody
. it succeeds as being horrible
. terrible
. gut
- wrenchingly bad
. i wanted to run awya from taht movie every minute
.
but i paid my money
and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better
. so i stayed
. it never got better
. frequently
, it did the impossible
,
and got
* worse
*
. the movie as wroten
, acted
, directed
, anbd basicaly jstu fiels as a hwole like it
' s baout on tyhe mental maturity levle of a free willy 4
. teh whole thing feels like a movie that only three
- yearm
- olds coudl enjoy
.
.
. exept for the ridiculously gratuitous blood
and gore
,
and pointless nudity
. it
' s written for littel children
, bu children should definitely
* not
* go anyhwere near it
. of course
, i recommend the same for everyone
. don
' t go anywhere near it
. verhoeven
' s got a streak going now
. his last movie was showgirls
. he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop comming
. showgirls was a failure
,
but it appears that
,
though it
' ll be lucky to make near its budget
, thsi movie wiull still do okay gross
- wise
. is it really
* all
* bad
? well
, no
. troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge
/ short humorous scenes that are actualyl funny
, mostly from the
" do yuo want to nkwo more
?
" commercials that pop uv
thoughout yhe story
, promoting the joys ofthe the joining the troopers
. so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment annd still about noe hour
, 59 minutes
,
and 30 seconds ofthe miserable torture
. i
' m totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movei
. bu i do admit it
. so
, if you
' re willing to possibly put yourself through torture
, go ahead
and see it
, annd decide for yourself if you love it or hate it
. i don
' t nkwo how anyone or any
* thing
* sould love thsi movie
,
but hey
, tothe eahc his pwn
. feel free to give it a shot
. of course
, in thge intrest of saving your souls
, i don
' t recommend it
.
but guess what
? alien resurrection comes out november 26th
,
and
, having already seen some of it
and haveing read tjhe script
, i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away
.
though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably splitted
, it
' ll be difficult tothe find someone that
* won
' t
* liek alien resurrection when they
' ve seen it
. this is possibly the year
' s best intense action film
, or at least
* one
* of the best
. if ytou really want to see aline warfare that
' s played out intelligently anbd seriously
, see alien ressurection
. please
, avoid thsi
.
