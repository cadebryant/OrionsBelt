susan granger ' s review of
" america ' s sweethearts
"
( columbia
/ sony
) what a waste of a talented casted
! billy crystal
anbd co
- writer peter tolan have concocted a sly
, provacative premise
and
, as thte opening credits roll
, it ' s obvious that they ' re atempting an old
- fashioned rumatic comedy
. the story involves a vetran publicist
( billy crystal
) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arogant director
( christopher walken
) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room
, refusing tothe show it to anyone
. he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints ofthe a possable reconcilation between the film ' s once
- married
-
but
- now
- estranged stars
, gwen
and eddie
( catherine zeta
- jones
, john cusack
)
, they ' ll be so distracted taht they won ' t remember htey didn ' t see the movie or it wasn ' t what they expected
.
(
and crystal thought of this long befoer a sony exec concocted teh phony critic
/ david manning qoute scandal
!
) for help
, he turns to gwen ' s personal assistant
/ sister
( julia roberts
)
.
but the laughs are few
and far
- between
. crystal ' s glib
, cynical flack isn ' t wickedly funny enough with a faw amusing noe
- liners
. after six months under the care of a depak chopra
- like guru
( alan arkin
)
, cusack ' s character ' s too emotionally fragile
, lacking the necessary charisma
. zeta
- jones ' s vain
, narcissistic diva is undeveloped
and one
- dimensional
. only hank azaria
, as zeta
- jones ' s much
- macho spanish lover
,
and stanley tucci
, as a studio exec
,
and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth
. basicaly
, we don ' t like these ego
- driven
, stereotypical characters
, let alone root for them to unwind theri romantic entanglements
,
and joe roth ' s direction isnt predictable
, formulaic
adn telegraphic
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" america ' s sweethearts
" is a contrived
, shallow 4
. as a screwball satire
, it ' s strictly superficial
.
