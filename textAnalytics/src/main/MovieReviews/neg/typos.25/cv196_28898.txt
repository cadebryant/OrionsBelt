' s review of
" america
' s sweethearts
"
( columbia
/ sony
) what a waste of a talented casted
! billy crystal
and co
- writer peter tolan ahve concocted a sly
, provocative premise
and
, as thte opening credits roll
, it
' s obvious that they
' re attempting an old
- fashioned romantic comedy
. tje story involves a veteran publicist
( billy crystal
) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arogant director
( christopher walken
) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room
, refusing to show it tothe anyone
. he figures taht by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film
' s once
- married
-
but
- now
- estranged stars
, gwen
and eddie
( catherine zeta
- jones
, john cusack
)
, they
' ll be so distracted that they won
' t remember they didn
' t see the movie or it wasn
' t what tehy expected
.
(
and crystal
thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony criteak
/ david manning qoute sc
andal
!
) fo help
, he turns tothe gwen
' s personal assitant
/ sister
( julia roberts
)
.
but the laughs are few anbd far
- bewteen
. crystal
' s glib
, cynical flack isn
' t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one
- liners
. after six monthes under tyhe care of a depak chopra
- like guru
( alan arkin
)
, cusack
' s character
' s too emotionally fragile
, lacking the neccessary charisma
. zeta
- jones
' s vain
, narcissistic diva is undeveloped
and one
- dimensional
. only hank azaria
, as zeta
- jones
' s much
- macho spanihs lover
,
and stanley tucci
, as a studio exec
, anbd roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth
. basically
, we don
' t liek these ego
- driven
, stereotypical characters
, let alone root for them to unwind their rumatic entanglements
,
and joe roth
' s direction is predictable
, formulaic adn telegraphic
. onthe the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" amercia
' s sweethearts
" isnt a contrived
, shallow 4
. as a screwball satire
, it
' s strikely superficial
.
