. i

, hedwig starts writing music
and meets another confused boy
, who soon turns into a star
. that boy also turns his back on hedwig
,
and it isn
' t long before hedwig puts together his
/ her own b
and
and tours the states via seafood restaurants
. this is the story of his
/ her life
, told via flashbacks
and musical numbers
. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy muscial whith great songs
and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell
, doesn
' t really come together as a whole
, whith over
- the
- top symbolism
, incoherence
and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through
. in fact
, this isn
' t so much ofthe a realistic
, articulate
, behind
- thge
- scenes look at the ries ofthe a rock
' n roll star
, as it isnt an ambiguous
, overly poetic
and incomprehensible struggle of a man
, his sexuality annd his idenity as a whole person on this planet
. i guess that i ws expecting the former oging in
. tghe film is somewhat intresting tothe a point
,
but i was personally never able to involve myself too much
, as thge basic symbolic
and incongruent nature of tjhe film left me feeling cold
and distant
.
but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audiance
. chances are that if you are a fan of the wall
, the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla
, queen of the desert
, the elements tangled inwhich this movie iwll likely strike your fancy
( some of the characters infact tihs film even ask the audience to sing along at smoe point
,
and provide hte lyrics of their song
, on
- screen
)
. well
, i personally don
' t care for those films
,
and didn
' t really get into hte whole
" show
" athmosphere of this movei either
. i guess i might
' ve looked at it all too literally
,
but like i said ealier
, i just didn
' t care enough about the characters to delve inot the
" so thte
butterfly represents his freedom
?
" side of thigsn
. all i know isnt that the film left me with many questions unanswered
and didn
' t make me feel any more fulfiled
. what was hedwig
' s relationship with that other memeber ofthe his b
and
( witht tyhe beard
)
? what happened with hedwig
and tommy gnosis at the end ofthe yhe movie
?
( ws that an actuall sequence or a fantasy
?
) what ever happended to the lawsuit
? anbd more
.
.
. all of which were part of thge film
and interested me somewhat
. if the onyl idea behind the film was forthe the main character to uncover his
/ her sexuality
,
then thast
' s noe thing
, bu as many of tjhe relationships
and situations presented themselves iin this movei
, i wnated some resolution to thsoe pieces as well
. i didn
' t get it
. the film
' s humor allso didn
' t tickle my funny bone either
.
then again
, i
' ve seen many a film in theese art
- hous theatres in which patrons are rolling down teh aisles with laughter
, while all i see is a tiny bited of whimsy onthe the screen
. some ofthe these films are alsot better enjoyed with the added
" atmosphere
" of a plant called marijuana
,
and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements
, in order tothe jazz uv tath experience
.
but bieng sober as i was
and expecting a coherent
, funny
, musical with a transsexual twist
, i didn
' t leave the theater veyr satisfied
. i came out hvaing watched an existential story of a confused man caught uv inthe a musical lifestyle
, wrapped in methaphors
, dramatics annd more questions than answers
. i will
, on the otehr h
and
, definitely h
and smoe props out tothe thte lead in this film
, john cameron mitchell
, who is aslo thte man who wrote
, directed annd created the play on which this movie is based
,
and the tunes
, which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs thge sex pistols
, david bowie
and the whole 70s glam
- rock scene
. note
: btw
, it seems as
though pretty much every single
" mainstream
" criteak in tyhe untied states loved this movei from top to bottom
(
and
thought tath it was really funny to boot
!
)
, so you might watn to take that into consideration yourself
.
but having said that
, tghe main reason that i started this dinky website in hte first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the
" official
" critics
, while i
, a regular
" joblo
" inaddition the audience
, jstu wouldn
' t get what all hte fuss wass baout
. htis movei isnt a perfect example ofthe why i continue tothe write movie reviews
. where
' s joblo coming from
