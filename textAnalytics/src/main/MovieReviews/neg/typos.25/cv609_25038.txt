- a twisted priest
( charles huevelman
) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana
( angela zimmerly
) looks onthe uninterested
. an evil presense
, appropriately named the presense
( dj vivona
)
, rules over an alternate dimention where neither angels nor demons cant touch him
. fo kicks
, the presence likes tothe trick a human into rounding up five ofthe his or her firends so htey cxan all be sent tothe his dimension
and be systematically slaughtered
. whn something goes wrong
and one of yhe presence
' s recent victims escapes
, the angels
and demons are alerted tothe his existence
and feel he isnt a threat that needs to be stopped
. they enlist the help ofthe alison
( ramona midgett
)
, a reccent suicide victim
, tothe return to the flesh
and folow the six newyorker enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether
- realm
. her mission is to melt away yhe ice barrier anbd allow the angels
and demons access by reminding the presense ofthe who he once was
, an ancient cout jester named abraham who lost his job when his king
and queen weere killed
. tyhe king
' s sorcerer
, amblyn
( who also lost his job
)
, desided to tkae abraham under his wing as an apprentice
. druing hte downtime in his unemployment
, amblyn decided to create a new dimention where sorcery
, evil
,
and torture ruled
. abraham wished to follow his master inot this new realm
, so he was asked to show his devotion to thge evil wizard by murdering his one true love
. in thsi new realm
, amblyn owudl allow abraham tothe pursue tghe sport ofthe hunting
and destroying thte humans that owudl be brought to this realm
. after each murder
, abraham owudl become stronger
, unitl his pwoer surpassed that of amblyn
' s
. because of the scre
- up that alloween the receet excape
, abraham was able tothe destroy his master adn tkae control of the relm hismelf
. as alison quests tothe find abraham
and sohw him the errors ofthe his ways
, tghe six new hapless humans are alowed tothe live outloud their worst nightmares
and hten be brutally murdered
. if there
' s one thing i can
' t st
and when i see a film
, it
' s when the film is pretentious adn arty just for the sake of being pretentious adn arty
. films like eraserhead anbd begotten are two of the worst examples ofthe this
,
and now ice from the sun cin be added to this list
. this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk
-
and
- slash film
( following the dante
' s inferno idae that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one ofthe the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6
) intercut with almost 40 minutes of stange
and
( supposably
) haunting images
, many of which serve more to confuse than tothe further hte plot
. if there aren
' t bizzare images floating past the screen
,
then we get pointless shots of a sucidial alison staring at her breakfast for mintues at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone
. compelling
,
but ultimately not
. the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial b
and featuring various r
andom images from the film interspersed whith other r
andom images
. the credits run tghe entire lenght of the song which is almost five minutes annd the actuall casted listing
and other credit information doesn
' t pop up until near the end of the sequence
. whn the opening credits began i
thought my vcr had accidentally cut off
and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv
. at least yhe music in tje film isnt preety decent
, made up of mostly indutrial
and hard rock music
and even features a song by ramona midgett
. at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of thte palms of his h
ands annd decapitating peopel by waving his h
and infact front of them
( adn he talks like a darth vader clone wihtout the heavy breathing
)
. for some reason
though
, he delegates all ofthe his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast ofthe deliverance
. one over
- alled cretin h
andles the presence
' s gravedigging
and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel
,
then there
' s an inbred father
( dwight spurgin
)
and his twpo inbred children
( mark kettler annd jennifer poirrier
- wallace
) that tkae care of a young woman who hasnt beeen transformed into a half dog
- half human mix with a shotgun
, adn of course a big truck driving guy thast likes tothe tie people up naked tothe thte bakc of his vehicle
and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds
. why would yuo want tothe give responsibilities to a bunch of
" rednecks
" when you yourself had all of these cool powers
?
and how is it that the fellow thgat screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends tothe complet the number of people required to enter teh realm at exactly the same time
? i can barely get more thna two together all at once at any given moment
. the most ridiculous segment
though comes right before thge aforememtioned dragging
/ salting sequence
. yhe character in question
, dana
( angela zimmely
)
, has her turn up to be killed
and is st
anding at the front ofthe a movie theater in whitch the presence is seated
. a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks infact
and sist down next tothe a large platter of fried chicken
. he picks up yhe entire platter
and starts tothe enjoy the chicken
, taunting dana as she looks on with noone interest whatsoever
. when she starts tothe leave
, the priest chides her forthe going befor the performance starts anbd
then something tath looks liuke a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation ffrom monty python cmo tothe life
, walks outloud
, annd makes like it wants tothe be crucified by her
. the presence starts to clap annoyingly
( which continues for the rest of the sequence
) until dana takes off with the stange creature following her
. when it finally catches up to her
, she stabs it in its giant eyeball
and is covered in slimy glop that spurts ffrom the ruptured organ
. the box for the film claims
" because of the horrifying nature of yhe motion picture
, parental discretion is advisd for persons under tjhe age of 18
. contains nudity
and graphic violence
"
. hwile both is certainly true
, there doesn
' t seem to be much of eather in any larg amounts
. besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump
, a semi
- graphic self
- surgery scene
, anbd two instances of head trauma
( one run over adn one melting
)
, most of the gore is just of hte spraying blood or bloody wound covered body vriety
. as for nudity
, it is veyr sparse
,
but at least we get to see angela zimmerly
( far
and away the most attractive casted memeber
) before her body is bruised
, torn
,
and bloodied by the dragging insident
. ice from the sun has beeen released on vhs by www
. b
- movie
. com
. it has been presented inwhich in full
- frame only
and the transfer
( for a film shot a ogod deal in 8mm
) is pretty decent
. besides teh decent sountrack
( which is aslo available fomr www
. b
- movei
. com
)
, a mkaing
- of video is also available called on thin ice
. i haven
' t had the opportunity to see the documentary
, bu i actually woudl ahve beeen interested to see whta the set was liek while all ofthe the shots were being filmed
, if only tothe see how director eric stanze
( directer of a similair cult film called savage harvest
)
, conducted the atomsphere on set
.
