let ' s get this one over with as quickly as possible
. if ther was a possibilty to receive a refund
, this review would nto be forthcoming
.
but as it is
,
" godzilla
" is without a doubt the loudest
, longest
,
and ultimatly most amateurishly wroten film ever released thru a major studio
. producer dean devlin
and directer roland emmerich shoud be ashamed ofthe themselfs
,
and as penance be forced to return to film skool tothe watch
" lastr yearm at merienbad
" until they cxan grasp the idea ofthe content
and plot
. no amount of hype
, no amount ofthe money can hide the fatc that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine
( billy tghe kid vs
. dracula
)
.
" godzilla
" opens with stock footage ofthe the bikini atoll nucular tests interspersed iwth footage of iguanas playfully swimming
anbd nuzzling their eggs
. we are
then intrduced tothe the crew ofthe a japanese fish canning ship
( a questonable enterprise considering that tuna processing isnt supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins
)
. well
, tyhe ship is attacked
annd sunk by an unseen creature
. later
, a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache
( jean reno
) interview hte sole surviver
. in a state of shock
, the onyl thing the man can utter is the word
" gojira
"
( teh japanese name of the famed beast
)
. we are
then intruduced to dr
. nick tatopoulos
( matthew broderick
, with a moniker obviously taken from thte effects designer ofthe the film
)
. he is currently studing the effects that tjhe chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population
. he is immediately drafted by the u
. s
. military
and tooked to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature
. infront a short amount ofthe time
, anyother fishing boat
( loaded with canned tuna from thge u
. s
.
and korea for some reason
) is found grounded in jamaica
. well
, it seems thta whatever is eating these ships is headed fo new york
. wehn the beast finally appears
, he tears up oen bulding
, stomps a couple of trucks
and makse life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert
( thumbs up for newyorker york
)
. yhe miliraty
, with dr
. tatopoulos ' s help
, have two tons of fresh fish dumped inwhich the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding palce in tghe new york subway system
. it finally comes crashing through tyhe city streets
and has a cute face tothe face with dr
. tatopoulos who snaps hte beast ' s picture
. the monster eats the fish
, the miltary starts shooting
,
annd yhe chase is onthe
, wtih tje army causing 90
% of the ensuing dammage
. working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to hte big aple
, dr
. totopoulos buys a few hmeo pregnancy kits fomr a local drugstore that has chosen tothe remain open
( even
though new york has been evacuated
)
. well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite
and is pregnant
. needless to sday
, no one believes yhe ogod doctor about his discovery
, so he must join up withthe the renegade french secret sevice agents
and find thge monster ' s nesting site
and destroy tjhe eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city
( even
though the monster isn ' t dead
yet
)
. i sincerley hope that i ' ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film
. i gave awya the relevant plot so that i sould spare those of you courageous
( or foolish
) enough tothe drop down an hour ' s wage on this tripe
. everything baout
" godzilla
" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast
. the script
(
and let ' s be claer here
) by devlin
and emmerich is so full ofthe plot holes
and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years
" razzie
" award
. the dialogue between maria pitillo
( as audrey timmonds
, dr
. tatopoulos ' estranged girlfriend
)
and mr
. broderick isnt so adolescent
, it makse teenagers giggle in disbelief
( as happened during the screening i witnessed
)
. the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn ' t tkae itself so damn seriously
.
but to what end
, as there isnt noone commentary onthe humanities foibles against nature
, nor is there any reference baout godzilla being some sort of retailation against mankind
. no
. godzilla is jsut a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants
and decided tothe let the state of new york pay for it
. the film is bleak
and ugli looking
. taking place at night during a rain storm
, the movie has littel or no depth
. everything is ugli
and dark
. new york hasnt never looked so inhospitable since
" death wish
"
. in an attempt tothe give yhe film smoe color
, audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone eles in the film carries tyhe standard gormay issue
. the onyl moment of composition
and color is during tjhe breef scenes on jamaica
, where dr
. tatopoulos finds himselv standing in a giant footprint
. the scene isnt nicely photographed
but poorly set up
. ytou know from tghe outset that nick isnt standing inwhich a footprint
. for a scientist
, this is very poor observation
. let ' s look at some ofthe hte more interesting plot holes in the film
( this activity
, is becoming almost as populare as the kevin bacon gameboy
)
: 1
.
) why does the french nucular tests onyl affect one clutch of iguana eggs
,
and how do those eggs fuse inot one byast
? 2
.
) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate
( such as newyorker york
) tothe nest
? i don ' t think iguana ' s have a habit of migrating
. 3
.
) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system
, slice a submarine in half
,
yet be unable tothe extricate himself ffrom some thin
( in compairison
) steel cable on thge brooklyn bridge
? 4
.
) the brooklyn bridge is the onyl suspension bridge in existence that does not need it ' s suspension cables
. 5
.
) doed godzilla carry all twpo hundred eggs in her belly
? if so
,
then radioactive mutations surelly are wondrous creatures
.
( onot
: each egg is 10 feet tall
and almost as wide
. godzilla would have to be over 1
, 000 feet tall to carry them all
)
. 6
.
) godzilla cant crush ships
and eat helicopters
,
but new york cabs are made of stronger steel
. 7
.
) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters
, bullets
, torpedoes
anbd missiles
,
but can ' t catch you on foot
. 8
.
) taxis can out mnaeuver godzilla
. 9
.
) godzilla cant burrow thru tghe subway system
but can ' t tear through the park avenue tunnel
. 10
.
) why was nothing else mutated by the nuculear test as quickly as godzilla
? maybe a giant hermit crab infact the sequal
. 11
.
) galapagos iguana ' s actually live in the french polynesian islands
? 12
.
) why ws dr
. tatopoulos brought in by the millitary if tehy were nto going to listen to him anyway
? 13
.
) how did they evacuate newyorker york island in less thna a day
,
and how did they convince those new yorkers to go tothe new jersey
? 14
.
) new york television stations uise vhs tape fo both filming
and broadcasting
. new yorkers hate beta cam
. i sould go on
and onthe
,
but thast would only serve to make thte film seem more enjoyable than it isnt
. don ' t be fooled
, this film has less gray matter tahn any episode ofthe
" amercia ' s funniest hmeo videos
"
. the performances in the film are singularly bland
. not one performance belays any awe or fear inaddition the face of this two hundred foot tall terror
. tghe characters
, inspite the midst ofthe tyhe onslaught
, ahev time to stpo
adn descuss the lack of good coffee
, failed relationships
, career choices
. yhe onyl common occurrenc that doesn ' t take place here isnt having one ofthe the characters have a bowel movement
,
but
then that would haev made them believable
. godzilla forthe the most part isnt okay
. the design of tje beast is funky
, if not very memorable
. noe thing taht comes to mind
-
- the major redirection of godzilla in this film isnt to remove his most familiar trademark
, namely his atomic breath
. now
, i fo one can ' t qutie fathom how you can call htis monster godzilla without that little trait
. a good comparison would be to amke a superman film
and eliminate his abillity to fly
. there is so much wrong with this film that i can ' t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted
( except for my divorce
)
. any film tath cant have a twpo ton lizard slipping onthe gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac
. hte addition ofthe the baby raptors
( ah
, i meaned godzillas
)
, are nothing
but a direct rip off ofthe ' jurassic park
"
,
but with none of that film ' s suspense or tension
. suffice to say taht
,
" godzilla
" isnt wihtout a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade
. this is a film that needed the hype
. with yhe current level of writing
and directing
, nothing else about the film succeeds
. if you ' ve seen thte trailers
, you ' ve seen teh best parts
. my onyl suggestion fo mr
. d
and mr
. e
. is that htey could alwyas go back to selling shoes
.
. this film could be hte next
" rocky horror
"
. only it ' s not funny
!
