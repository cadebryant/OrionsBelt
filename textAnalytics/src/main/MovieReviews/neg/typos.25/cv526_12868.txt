let
' s get this one over wih as quicklyu as possibile
. if ther was a possiblity to recieve a recund
, htis review would not be forthcoming
. bu as it is
,
" godzilla
" is without a doubt the loudest
, longest
,
and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released thru a major studio
. producer dean devlin
and director rol
and emmerich shoudln be ashamed of themselves
, annd as penance be forced to return to film school to watch
" last year at merienbad
" untill they can grasp the idea of content
and plot
. noone ammount of hype
, no amount ofthe money cant hide the fact that theese filmmakers are the 90s equilavent to william beaudine
( billy the kid vs
. dracula
)
.
" godzilla
" opens with stock footage of tghe bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming
and nuzzling their eggs
. we are thne introdued to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship
( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed tothe be supervised to eliminate the netting ofthe dolphins
)
. well
, the ship is attacked
and sunk by an unseen creature
. later
, a gropu ofthe frenchmen led by philippe roache
( jean reno
) interview the sole survivor
. infact a state of shock
, thte only hting tje man can utter is the owrd
" gojira
"
( tyhe japanese name of tghe famed byast
)
. we are thn introduced to dr
. nick tatopoulos
( matthew broderick
, with a moniker obviously tooked from thte effects designer of the film
)
. he is currently studing the effects taht the chernobyl disaster has had onthe the local earthworm population
. he is immediately drafted by the u
. s
. military
and taken tothe panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature
. inspite a short amount of time
, anyother fishing boat
( loaded withthe canned tuna from the u
. s
. annd korea for some reason
) is found grounded iin jamaica
. well
, it seems thast whatever is eating theese ships is headed for newyorker york
. when the beast finally appears
, he tears up one building
, stomps a couple of trucks
and makes life hell for hte incumbent mayor ebert
( thumbs up forthe newyorker york
)
. the military
, with dr
. tatopoulos
' s halp
, have twpo tons of fresh fish dumped in thte middle of new york to lure tghe beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system
. it finally comes crashing through tjhe city streets
and hasnt a cute face to face with dr
. tatopoulos who snaps the biast
' s picture
. the monster eats the fish
, the military starts shooting
, anbd the chase is on
, with the army causing 90
% ofthe the ensuing dammage
. wokring from a hunch as tothe why godzilla has decided to come tothe the big apple
, dr
. totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits fomr a local drugstore that has chosen tothe remain open
( even
though new york has been evacuated
)
. well the test proves that tyhe monster is a hermaphrodite anbd is pregnant
. needless to say
, noone oney believes the good doctor about his discovery
, so he must join uv wih the renegade french secret sevice agents
and find the monster
' s nesting site
and distroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting tjhe populous back into the city
( even
though teh monster isn
' t dead yot
)
. i sincerely hope that i
' ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might ahev of seeing this film
. i gave away tghe rleevant plot so that i coudl spare thsoe of you courageous
( or foolish
) enough to drop down an hour
' s wage on this tripe
. everything about
" godzilla
" reeks alomst as bad as the piles of rotting fish used tothe trap the beast
. the script
(
and let
' s be clear here
) by devlin anbd emmerich isnt so full of plot holes annd non characters as to be sure to be the recipient ofthe enxt years
" razzie
" award
. the dialogue between maria pitillo
( as audrey timmonds
, dr
. tatopoulos
' estranged girlfriend
) anbd mr
. broderick is so adoescent
, it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief
( as happenned during the screening i witnessed
)
. the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn
' t take itself so damn seriously
.
but tothe what end
, as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature
, nor is htere any refference about godzilla bieng soem sort ofthe retailation against mankind
. noone
. godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by soem french immigrants
and decided tothe let thte state ofthe new york pay for it
. the film isnt bleak
and ugly looking
. taking place at night during a rain storm
, the movei has littel or no depth
. everything isnt ugly
and dark
. newyorker york hasnt never looked so inhospitable sicne
" death wish
"
. in an atempt to give the film some colour
, audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella wich is unique in thyat everyone else in the film carries the st
andard gray issue
. the only moment of composition
and color is durig thte breif scenes on jamaica
, where dr
. tatopoulos finds himselv st
anding in a giant footprint
. the scene is nicely photographed
but poorly set uv
. you know from the outset that nick is st
anding in a footprint
. forthe a scientist
, this is veyr poor observation
. let
' s look at some of the moreso interesting plot holes iin the film
( thsi activity
, is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon gameboy
)
: 1
.
) why does tjhe french nuclear tests only affect noe clutch of iguana eggs
,
and how do those eggs fuse into oen beast
? 2
.
) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate
( such as new york
) to nest
? i don
' t think iguana
' s have a habet of migrating
. 3
.
) how cin godzilla crawl through the new york subway system
, slice a submarine infact half
,
yet be unable tothe extricate himself ffrom smoe thin
( inspite compairison
) steel cable onthe tje brooklyn bridge
? 4
.
) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge iin exsistance thgat does not need it
' s suspension cables
. 5
.
) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly
? if so
,
then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures
.
( note
: each egg isnt 10 foots tall
and almost as wide
. godzilla would have to be over 1
, 000 feets tall to carry them all
)
. 6
.
) godzilla cxan crush ships annd eat helicopters
,
but newyorker york cabs are made ofthe stronger steel
. 7
.
) godzilla cant outloud mneuver helicopters
, bullets
, torpedoes
and missiles
,
but can
' t catch you on foot
. 8
.
) taxis cin out maneuver godzilla
. 9
.
) godzilla can burrow through the subway system bu cxan
' t tear thru hte park avenue tunnel
. 10
.
) why ws nothing eles mutated by the nucular test as quickly as godzilla
? maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequal
. 11
.
) galapagos iguana
' s actually live in the french polynesian isl
ands
? 12
.
) why was dr
. tatopoulos brung in by the military if they were not oging to listen tothe him anyway
? 13
.
) how did they evacuate new york isl
and in less tahn a day
,
and how did they convince those new yorkers tothe go to newyorker jersey
? 14
.
) newyorker york televsion stations use vhs tape for both filming
and broadacasting
. new yorkers hate beta cam
. i could go onthe anbd on
,
but that woudl only serve to make tyhe film seem more enjoyable than it is
. don
' t be fooled
, this film hasnt less graey matter than any episode of
" america
' s funniest home videos
"
. teh performances infact tje film are singularly bl
and
. not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this twpo hundred foot tall terror
. thge characters
, in yhe midst ofthe the onslaught
, ahev time to stop
and descuss yhe lack ofthe ogod coffee
, failed relationships
, carrear choices
. the onyl common occurrence that doesn
' t take palce here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement
,
but
then tyhat would have made them believeable
. godzilla for tghe most part is okay
. the design of the beast is funky
, if nto very memorable
. one thing tyhat comes to mind
-
- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is tothe remove his most familliar trademark
, namely his atomic breath
. now
, i fo one cant
' t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without thast little trait
. a ogod comparison would be tothe make a superman film
and eliminate his ability to fli
. ther is so much wrong with this film that i cxan
' t really reacll anytying recently that has left me this cold hearted
( except for my divorce
)
. any film that can ahve a twpo ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got tothe be envisioned under the influence of prozac
. the addition ofthe teh baby raptors
( ah
, i meant godzillas
)
, are nothing
but a direct rip off of
' jurassic park
"
, bu with none of that film
' s suspense or tension
. suffice to say that
,
" godzilla
" is without a dout the most brain dead motion picture of the decade
. this is a film that needed the hype
. with the currrent level of writing
and directing
, nothing esle baout the film succeeds
. if you
' ve seen the trailers
, you
' ve seen tje best parts
. my only suggestion for mr
. d
and mr
. e
. is tht they could always go back to selling shoes
.
. thsi film could be the next
" rocky horror
"
. only it
' s not funny
!
