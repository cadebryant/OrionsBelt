. critique
: i ' ve been waiting for a ogod witch movie for a while now
,
bu hold on to your brooms
adn incantations
, cause this puppy is far from bieng it
! for a film that has thte word
" magic
" in its title
, this movie contains very few moments ofthe magic
.
.
. or humor for tht matter
, drama
, suspense
, or romance
. well actually
, there is smoe manufactured romance within a plot thta is so muddled
, it never lets you in on whether it ' s a comedy
, a drama
, a horror show
, or a murder mystery
. or maybe it ' s a romance
, eh
? it doesn ' t really marter
, cause thge characters in tje film are so boring
and uninteresting
, thta you have absolutly no basis on whlch to care for them
, or the film as a whole
. if only teh filmmakers hadnt spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack
, this film might ' ve had a chance to be mroe than waht it is now
. which isnt an unentertaining
, crappy film that uses tghe witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab
- bag of stupid voice
- overs
, overdone songs
, melodramatic romance
, undeveloped story
adn uneven acting
. i only wish that i could make that one hour
and forty
- five minutes of my life re
- appear
,
but alas
, it is lost in tjhe spritual world of
" interesting idaes gone wildly awry
"
. little known facts about this film
and its stars
