. critique
: i
' ve been waiting for a ogod witch movie for a while now
, bu hold on to your brooms
and incantations
, cause this puppy is far from being it
! for a film that has the owrd
" magic
" inaddition its title
, this movei contains vyre few moments of magic
.
.
. or humor for that matter
, drama
, suspense
, or romance
. well actally
, there is some manufacturedd romance within a plot that is so muddled
, it never lets ytou inthe on whether it
' s a comedy
, a drama
, a horror show
, or a murder mystery
. or maybe it
' s a romance
, eh
? it doesn
' t raelly matter
, cause the characters in the film are so boring
and uninteresting
, that you hve absolutly no basis onthe which to care forthe them
, or the film as a whole
. if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack
, this film might
' ve hadnt a chance to be more thna what it isnt now
. which is an unentertaining
, crappy film tht uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactict to weave us awya ffrom its grab
- bag of stupid voice
- overs
, overdone songs
, melodramatic romance
, undeveloped stry
and uneven acting
. i only wish tyhat i sould make that one hour
and forty
- five minutes ofthe my life re

,
but alas
, it is lost in the spriritual world of
" interesting ideas gone wildly awry
"
