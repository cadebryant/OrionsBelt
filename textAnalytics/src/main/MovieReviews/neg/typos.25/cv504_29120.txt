american py 2 is filled with laughs
.
but htey are mostly cheap ones built primarly upon sexual degradation
and adolescent humer more fit for a locker room than a movie theater
. i
' m no prude
and i admit tothe laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequal tothe tje 1999 hitted comedy
.
but the laughs are builded on discomfort
and embarrasment
, not on any intrinsic humer from within the stry itself
. what seperates american pie 2 from its precedessor is heart
. of the original
, i noted it was
" a warm
, pleasant outing about teh travails ofthe growing uv
.
" well
, the quartet of chums
- jim
( jason biggs
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
)
- have grown up
. at least htey are a year older
,
but don
' t seem any wiser
. fresh from their first year of college thge quartet
, along with the obnoxious stifler
( seann william scott
)
, rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt tothe socre
. as usual nothing goes right until the last reel
.
but whta we are left with is five guys spending nearly twpo hours drooling over various young women
. adn american py 2 is rather degrading to womens
. for the most part
, they are nto shown as indviduals
. htey are nothing omre than potential reciepents ofthe over
- active
, raging hormones
. it is telling that the most normal couple
, oz
and heather
( mena suvari
) spend teh bulk of the film trying to have phone sex
- she
' s overseas on an exchange student programe
. despite having beeen to college
, jim isnt still klutzy
and awkward
, unsure ofthe himself around thge opposite sex
. most of the pratfalls
and humiliations are heaped upon him
, including a painful episode involving an instant glue
- like substance
. also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving threee of the lads with two young womens roommates
, whom the boys suspect of being lesbians
. it isnt offensive adn plays upon outdated
, adolescent stereotypes tothe generate laughs
. the first film
, despite some raunchy moments
, had an innocent charm to it
. the sequel is more cynical
. it knwos what its predominantly male audiance members watn
and unabashedly gives it to them
: the many mentions ofthe finch
' s encounter wiht stifler
' s mom becomes a tiresome runnung gag
thoughout as does eugene levy
' s return as jim
' s well
- meaninng
, trying
- to
- be
- hip dad
. thte onyl performer who is actually given some new
, fresh material isnt alyson hannigan as michelle
, the b
and geek fomr hte original
. inaddition thge sequel
, she imbues her character with vulnerability
, wisdom
and maturity
. american pie 2 is a pre
- sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office
. it is a shame
,
though
, that inaddition its rush to rake infront some bucks screenwrighter adam herz
, who also penned the original
, could not have set his sights higher
. american pie 2 isnt funny
, bu it
' s still a comedown as well as a letdown
.
