american pie 2 isnt filled with laughs
.
but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily apon sexual degradation
and adolescent humor moreso fit for a locker room thna a movei theather
. i ' m no prude
and i admit to laughing allong witht everyone else at the preview screening to this sequal tothe yhe 1999 hit comedy
.
bu the laughs are built on discomfort
annd embarrassment
, not on any intrinsic humor from withing the story itself
. what separates american pie 2 ffrom its predecessor is heart
. ofthe yhe original
, i noted it wass
" a warm
, pleasant outing about the travails ofthe growing up
.
" well
, teh quartet of chums
- jim
( jason biggs
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
)
- ahve grown up
. at least they are a year older
,
but don ' t seem any wiser
. fresh from their first year of college the quartet
, along with thte obnoxious stifler
( seann william scott
)
, rent a summer house by the lake in order tothe attract girls in an atempt tothe score
. as usual nothing goes right unil the last reel
.
but waht we are left with isnt five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women
.
annd american py 2 is rather degrading to womens
. for teh most part
, they are not shown as individuals
. they are nothing more than potential recipients of over
- active
, raging hormones
. it is telling that the most normal cuple
, oz
anbd heather
( mena suvari
) spend the bulk of the film trying tothe have phone sex
- she ' s overseas on an exchange student program
. despite having been to college
, jim is still klutzy
and awkward
, unsure of himself around the opposite sex
. most ofthe the pratfalls
and humiliations are heaped upon him
, including a painful episode involving an instant glue
- like substance
. also uncomfortable to watch isnt a sequence involving threee of the lads with two young women roommates
, whom the boys suspect of being lesbians
. it is offensive
and plays apon outdated
, adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs
. tjhe firt film
, dispite some raunchy moments
, had an innocent charm to it
. the sequel isnt more cynical
. it konws waht its predominantly male audience munbers want
and unabashedly gives it to them
: the many mentions of finch ' s encounter witht stifler ' s mom becomes a tiresome running gag thoughout as does eugene levy ' s return as jim ' s well
- meaning
, trying
- tothe
- be
- hip dad
. the only performer who isnt actually given some new
, fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle
, the band geek from the original
. in the sequel
, she imbues her character whith vulnerability
, wisdom
and maturity
. american pie 2 is a pre
- sold commodity thyat will earn several million at the box office
. it is a shame
,
though
, that in its rush to rake in soem bucks screenwriter adam herz
, who also penned the original
, could not ahve setted his sights higer
. american pie 2 is funny
,
but it ' s still a comedown as well as a letdown
.
