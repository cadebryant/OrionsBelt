and jstu wehn you
thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners
, nto rating anytying lower than your st
andard
" this movie sucks
"
, along comes this cinematic atrocity annd he
' s forced tothe take out his secret weapon
and spray it with a stench so thick
, even hte bravest movie
- goer would think twice about seeing this waste ofthe time
. yes
, despite bieng a third sequal to a successful original movie
, yhe latest highl
ander doesn
' t seem to have anytying going forthe it
. oh stinky movie
, let me count thee ways
.
.
. plot
:
( from what i understood
) a really bad highl
ander dude comes to the present looking tothe whack out tjhe nice highl
ander dudes in order to gain their power
and become the mightiest immortal
.
.
. or something along those lines
. critique
: a complete
and utter mess
. disjointed
, incoherent
, boring
, corny
, filled with bad dialogue
.
.
.
and taht
' s just the first thirty mintues
! this film doesn
' t seem to know what tothe dont with itself
. it
' s confusing tothe anyone who doesn
' t know the series
( i include myself in thyat group
) annd apparently idiotic to those who do know tyhe series
( i include die
- hard highl
ander fan tjhe arrow in that gropu
)
. the film doesn
' t explain anything about itself
.
.
. it jsut goes from one inexplicable situation tothe another
. one moment they
' re inaddition the present time
, the next moment
, they
' re in italy in thge 1600s
. why
? who knows
. what are they tlaking baout
? noone idea
. flashbacks mixed in with the present
, mixed in with a fewd spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now
and again
,
and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene
!
! hullo
.
.
.
?
!
? confuzled yot
? i was anbd i basically stoped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writter or director wass interested iin presenting me wiht any kind of semblance of a story
. r
andom swordplay
, mad max
- liuke dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s
? or were they in the rpesent at tyhat time
? who knows
.
.
.
and to be honest
.
.
. who seriously cares
! this series should have been shot in the head
and put out of its own misery a long time ago
,
but sadly
, somene at the studio decided that it still had a little life left inwhich it
. please
, please
.
.
. fo the love of god
and all thyat is wholy in the world of movie
- making
,
and mostly outloud ofthe respect for those who loved yhe original film
, put this series to bed adn end it
! even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one
. the director also tries to do the best he can wih tje muddled material
,
but all he could cmo uv with is plenty of slo
- mo acation
, some fast
- motion fight scenes
and lots ofthe smoke everywhere
.
and is there anytying spectacular about the sword
- play or fight scenes
? nope
.
and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close
- ups
.
.
. yipes
, the man is nto aging gracefully
, is he
? oh boy
,
and i haven
' t even gotten around to the greatest piece ofthe over
- acting tht i
' ve seen inaddition years
. the man who plays kell in tihs movei
, bruce payne
, should git a ham trophy fo litterally chewing up every peice ofthe scenery that he gets near
. overacting is not a hobby fo htis guy
.
.
. it
' s a living
! he
' s also very funny
, not purposely
though
. all inaddition all
, tje movei stinks
. nuff said
.
