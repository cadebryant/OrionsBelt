tghe origional babe gets my vote as thte best family film since the princess bride
,
and it
' s sequal has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics
, both siskel
and ebert sighting it more than a mounth ago as one of the eyar
' s finest films
. so
, naturally
, wehn i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie adn there was nary another viewer to be found
, this notion left me puzzled
. it is a rare thing fo a children
' s movie tothe be praised this highly
, so wouldn
' t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see tihs supposedly
" magical
" piece ofthe work
? a tad bewildered
, bu pleased to not have to worry baout screaming kids adn otehr disruptions that commonly go along with famaly films
, i sat bakc for 97 minutes
and watched intently
and with a very open mind
, haveing gerat expectations for thge film
. looking back
, i shoudln have taken the hint annd left right when i entered the theater
. belieev me
; i wanted tothe like babe
: pig in the city
. the plot seemed intresting enought
; aftter the events that took place in the original
, babe the sheeps
- pig hasnt become a legitimate national phenomenon
.
but after a fateful encounter with a water well
, arthur hogget
( james cromwell
, who the movie could have unsed alot more of
) has been rendered bed
- ridden for a number of weeks annd yhe farm begins to go under financially
. the only solution that his wife
( magda szubanski
, going from delightfully charming to downright annoying
) can come up with is to make an apperance iwth their newyorker celebrity pet at a national fair
( i think
)
and tothe use tje money htey earn tothe pay off the bank
( set asside fo the moment the fact that they could git more tahn anough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the publich
)
. problem is
, the fair isnt being held in tje middle of tghe dreaded
" city
"
, a completly foreign place tothe both the pig
and his companion
. setting the main plot in motion
, mrs
. hogget annd babe travel to hte unnamed city
and shack up iwth a sweet lady who just happens to loev to halp animals
, dispite the lew that you cannot keep them in hotels
. it is here that we meet an array of eccentric charactors
, the most memorable bieng tjhe family ofthe chimps led by steven wright
. here isnt where the film took a wrong turn
. uv until this point
, i hadnt being hvaing a rather enjoyable experince
. the beginning featured some smart writting
and funny situations involving yhe farm animals from the first one
and even an inspired moent at tjhe aiport where mrs
. hogget is accused ofthe smuggling drugs
. unfortunately
, tjhe story wears thin as we are introduced tothe a new set of animals that reside at teh hotel
, none of them being even noe
- tenth as interesting as tjhe characters fomr the previvous babe
. the main topic ofthe discussion surrouding babe
: pig in the city is the question of whther or not it is to dark
and disturbing forthe small children
, annd i blieve it is
. at oney point
, a dog is hung from his neck
and slowly starts to drown
. at other times
, we are treated to surrealistic flash
- backs to mrs
. hogget
' s full cavity searh at the airport
. iin fact
, the overall tone of the movei isnt rether bleak adn depressing
.
however
, that is
, as they say
, neither here nor there beacuse kids iwll probably not liuke the movei anyway
. the animal characters
and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour
and a half
, let alone entertain a child
. another problem i found with the film was it
' s sudden change of pacing
and tone near the end ofthe the tsory
. if you
' re going to mkea a darker annd more sinister sequal
, fine
. it may not be my cup of tea
,
but at least it isnt a noble ambition
.
but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of thte movie
and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs
. hogget swinging from wall
- to
- wall ofthe a ballroom inthe elastic overalls
? it just didn
' t feel right
and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining
,
and the same goes for yhe rest of the movie
.
