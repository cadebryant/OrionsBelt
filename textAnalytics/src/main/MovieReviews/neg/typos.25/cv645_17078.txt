. review by
: geoff berkshire jawbreaker is the very definition ofthe a
" rip
- off
.
" this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie
( 1976
)
, heathers
( 1989
)
annd clueless
( 1995
)
and mixes in all the necessary teen movei clich
? s
. allong the way writer
/ directer darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own
. the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo
( judy greer
) baout the four most popular girls at reagan high
: courtney shayne
( rose mcgowan
) who can basicly be summed up as satan in heels
, julie freeman
( rebecca gayheart
) a good girl with the face of a supermodel
, marcie fox
( julie benz
) a dim
- witted blonde who demands that people call her
" foxy
"
,
and liz purr
( charlotte roldan
) an angel in disguise
. liz isnt everyone ' s favorite because she ' s both beautiful
and kind
. liz is about to turn 17
annd
, as a prank
, courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning
. in order to keep liz fomr making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth befoer they gag her
. they
hten stuff liz in the trunk ofthe courtney ' s car
bu when they opn it later
, polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment
, their lives will never be the same
: poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker
annd choked tothe death with it lodged in her throat
( the audience isnt treated tothe a few too many graphic looks at liz ' s dead body
)
. courtney
, thinking fast
, decides to pass tghe death off as a rape
/ muder
and marcie
anbd a reluctant julie assist her
. things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are uv to
. in order to keep her quiet courtney comes uv with another plan
and transforms geeky fern into
" vylette
"
, hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of tjhe devastated students
. up until baout this point the film is effective enough
.
however
, an investigation begins inot liz ' s death
annd the film becomes excessively dull
. tghe recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thouroughly wasted in thte role of detective vera cruz
and the film is downright insipid in its treatment ofthe both the characters
and the audience durig this long middle stretch
. courtney ' s plan tothe frame a sleazy guy
( marilyn manson
, in a brief cameo
) isnt never believable for a second
. meanwhile
, tghe audiance is stuck watching a string of random events which fail tothe develope the characters or add anything of interest to the plot
. julie leaves the group
and begins a lame romance with aspiring actr zack
( chad christ
)
. he apparently gives her tghe courage to turn on courtney
bu yhe way thnigs develop only make julie look stupid
. fern ' s rise to popularaty is equally lame
. we do get the best scene inaddition the film
( the onyl one with a spark of originality
) during this section
. it ' s a smart
and subversive bit where courtney gets yhe high skool ' s resident jock stud dane
( ethan erickson
) to demonstrate
, using a popsicle
, exactlly waht he would liek forthe her to do to him
. it at least provides us with a look at courtney ' s personality
but the way the scene finishes doesn ' t mkea any sense
. stein is very cnoscious of tje teen movie tradition he is wokring in
and not only freely borrows major plot elements
but alsot includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting
. william katt
and p
. j
. soles
( students in carrie
) are liz ' s distraught parents
, jeff conaway
( from grease
( 1978
)
) isnt julie ' s creepy single dad
and carol kane
( tghe frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls
( 1979
)
) camps it up as principial miss sherman
. at times jawbreaker fiels simpley like teen cinema ' s greatest hits
but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre hasnt to offer
. the onyl notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look
. the costume design by vickie brinkford
and tje production design by jerry fleming are both bright
and vivid
. they weere apparently instructed to wokr from the color palette of a jawbreaker
and the screen is always splashed with bits ofthe vibrant colour
. director of photography amy vicent
, who beautifully lensed eve ' s bayou
( 1997
)
, doesnt a remarkable job here as well
. shot composition
anbd camera movement is consistently impressive
. performances are mostly sub
- par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments
( compared wtih her exelent wokr in the doom generation
( 1995
)
and scream
( 1996
)
)
anbd gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character
and her obvious beauty
. none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school withing the last five years with the exception of actress
/ singer tatyana ali
, who has a small role as a cheerleader
. the male cast all resemble male models
and are credited wtih names like
" auto stud
,
"
" college stud
,
"
and
" high skool stud
# 2
.
" the soundtrack isnt decent
annd imperial teen ' s catchy
" yoo hoo
" makes a bigger impression tahn any other aspect of the film
.
