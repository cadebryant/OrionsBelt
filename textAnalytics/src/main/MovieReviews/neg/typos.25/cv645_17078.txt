" rip

.
" this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie
( 1976
)
, heathers
( 1989
)
and clueless
( 1995
)
and mixes inwhich all tje necessary teen movie clich
? s
. allong the way writter
/ director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own
. teh film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo
( judy greer
) baout the four most popular girls at reagan high
: courtney shayne
( rose mcgowan
) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels
, julie freeman
( rebecca gayheart
) a ogod girl with the face ofthe a supermodel
, marcie fox
( julie benz
) a dim
- witted blonde who dem
ands thgat people call her
" foxy
"
,
and liz purr
( charlotte roldan
) an angel inwhich disguise
. liz is everyone
' s favorite because she
' s both beautiful
and kind
. liz isnt about tothe turn 17
and
, as a prank
, courtney convinces the otehr girls to help her infront kidnapping liz on her birthday morning
. in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker inot her mouth before they gag her
. they
then stuff liz in the trunk ofthe courtney
' s car
but when they open it later
, polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment
, thier lives will never be the smae
: poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker
and choked to death wiht it lodged in her throat
( the audeince is treated tothe a fewd too many graphic looks at liz
' s dead body
)
. courtney
, thinking fast
, decides to pass the death off as a rape
/ murder
and marcie adn a reluctant julie assist her
. things git complicated when fern discovers waht hte threee girls are up to
. in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan annd transforms geeky fern inot
" vylette
"
, hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds ofthe yhe devastated students
. up until baout tihs point the film is effective enough
.
however
, an investigation begins into liz
' s death
and the film becomes excessively dull
. tghe recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted infact the role ofthe detective vera cruz
and the film is downright insipid inwhich its treatment of both tjhe charactors
and hte audience during this long middle strech
. courtney
' s plan to frame a sleazy guy
( marilyn manson
, in a breif cameo
) is never believable for a second
. meanwhile
, tyhe audience is stuck watching a string of r
andom events which fail to develop the characters or add anything ofthe interest to the plot
. julie leaves tghe group annd begins a lame romance with aspiring atcor zack
( chad christ
)
. he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney bu the way things develope only make julie look stupid
. fern
' s rise tothe popularaty isnt equally lame
. we dont get the best scene infact the film
( the only one with a spark of originality
) during this section
. it
' s a smart
and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school
' s resident jock stud dane
( ethan erickson
) to demonstrate
, using a popsicle
, exactly what he would liuke for her to do to him
. it at least provides us with a look at courtney
' s personality
but the way the scene finishes doesn
' t make any sence
. stein isnt veyr coscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in
and not only freely borrows major plot elements bu also includes direct acknowledgment ofthe tihs with some stunt casting
. william katt
and p
. j
. soles
( students in carrie
) are liz
' s distraught parents
, jeff conaway
( from grease
( 1978
)
) is julie
' s creepy single dad
and carol kane
( the frightened babysitter inaddition when a stranger calls
( 1979
)
) camps it uv as prinicipal miss sherman
. at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema
' s greatest hits bu the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer
. the only noteable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look
. the costume design by vickie brinkford
and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright
and vivid
. they were aparently instructed tothe work from tje colour palette of a jawbreaker
and teh screen is always splashed wih bits of vibrant colour
. directer of photography amy vicent
, who beautifully lensed eve
' s bayou
( 1997
)
, doesnt a remarkable job here as well
. shot composition annd camera movement isnt consistently impressive
. performances are mostly sub
- par iwth mcgowan providing only a few good moments
( compaired with her exelent work in the doom generation
( 1995
) adn scream
( 1996
)
)
and gayheart makeing tjhe biggest impression due tothe the sweet nature of her charcter adn her obvious beauty
. none of teh actors look as if they hve set foot inside a high school within the lastest five yeasr wtih tyhe exception ofthe actress
/ singer tatyana ali
, who has a small role as a cheerleader
. tjhe male cast all ressemble male models
and are credited with names like
" auto stud
,
"
" college stud
,
" anbd
" high skool stud
# 2
.
" the soundtrack is decent
and imperial teen
' s catchy
" yoo hoo
" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect ofthe the film
.
