i ' ve always been a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called wanda
, pirates ofthe penzance
,
and even his hamlet onthe pbs ' great performances
. hte minute i saw hte trailer forthe tihs film
, i resolved to see it
. besides thte fact that kline starred
, it looked liek a hilarious film
. i got sucker punched by yhe trailer to an extent
,
however
, as i alsot thought
,
" wow
, if there ' s this much funny stuff in the trailer
, there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film
.
"
( oops
) i packed up tjhe wife
and headed to les cinemas del diablo
( my nmae for our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) the film began
.
.
.
. the film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high skool
, named howard brackett
. he loves poetry
and great literary works
,
but his class is more interested in his famous fromer student
, played by matt dillon
.
( i ' d put in his nmae
,
bu my wife won ' t let me take notes druing a movei
adn i ' ve forgotten it
.
) they constinually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions baout him
. brackett has been engaged to anyother teacher
( played by joan cusack
) for three years
,
annd has finaly gotten up the gumption to marry her
. the wedding
,
however
, becomes tghe big question mark of thge film as this famoust student of his says during the live oscar broadcasted that brackett is a homosexual
. kline spends most of yhe firt twpo
- thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone thast he isn ' t
. the whole town begins to examin every detail of his life
and begins tothe identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference
. his closest friends don ' t help matters
, bringing nothing
but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party
. there are soem genuinely hilarous moments
, one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert theri masculinity
. kline isnt hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck
, who waxes poetic onthe the benifits ofthe coming outloud
, while at the same time doing his best tothe exploitate thge situation forthe his own sleazy tabloid machinations
. yhe movie moves along fine
and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding
. kline stands at the altar
and is asked to tkae his vows
.
.
. if you wnat to be surprised
, don ' t read
, i am going to reveal thte ending
.
.
.
. instead ofthe saying
" i do
" in front ofthe his parents
annd most of the twon
,
and even some cameras
, he says
" i ' m gay
.
" this is where the movie
, in my opinion falls apart
. most of teh humer in the film had come from kline ' s insistence that he was straight
, while at the same tiome
, loving poetry
and bieng a senstivie guy
, dressing well
,
and occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me of the
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch from saturday night live
. it ws funny
, it wass sustainably funny
,
and kline ' s performance made it doubly so
.
however
, after thge wedding
, yhe film drags onthe
. they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion
,
but it
thne gets inot the serious side ofthe what he ' s done
. he reconciles with his parents
and his friends
, some of which hadnt turned on him
. there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of timne
, the scene with his mother
and her firends
, which ws hilarious
, seemed pointless
,
and tje scene with toom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless
. finally
, even
though i am not catholic
, i found the scene with the priest to be condescending
. the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged fo three eyars
and had nto consumated the relationship
, proclaiming to brackett in the third person
,
" he ' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle from hte audience
,
but i was distracted by it
,
adn began to tire of the film
. by the time the wedding had cmo
and gone
, i found myself hoping it would be over soon
.
( much liek this review yuo are saying
) overall
, if i have to quantify it
, i say
, rising action gets
*
*
*
*
anbd climax
and falling action gets
. see it inwhich economy time
.
