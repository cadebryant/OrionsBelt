i
' ve always been a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called w
anda
, pirates of penzance
,
and even his hamlet onthe pbs
' great performances
. the minute i saw yhe trailer for tihs film
, i resolved to see it
. besides teh fatc that kline starred
, it looked like a hilarious film
. i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent
,
however
, as i also
thought
,
" wow
, if there
' s this much funny stuff in the trailer
, there must be a ton ofthe laughs in tghe rest of the film
.
"
( oops
) i packed up the wife
and headed to les cinemas del diablo
( my name for our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) the film began
.
.
.
. tjhe film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high school
, named howard brackett
. he loves poetry
and great literary works
,
but his clas is more interested in his famous former student
, played by matt dillon
.
( i
' d put in his nmae
,
but my wife won
' t let me take notes during a movie adn i
' ve forgotten it
.
) they continually inturrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions baout him
. brackett hasnt beeen engaged to anohter teacher
( played by joan cusack
) for threee years
,
and has fianlly gotten up the gumption to marry her
. the wedding
, howver
, becomes the big question mark ofthe thte film as this famous student of his says durring the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual
. kline spends most of the first two
- thirds of teh film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn
' t
. the hwole town begins to examine every detail of his life adn begins tothe identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference
. his closest friends don
' t halp matters
, bringing nothing
but barbara streis
and laserdiscs to his stag party
. there are soem genuinely hilarous moments
, one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert theri masculinity
. kline is hounded by a gay repertwar plyed by tom selleck
, who waxes poetic on the benefits of comming outloud
, while at the same time doing his best to exploit tghe situation for his pwn sleazy tabloid machinations
. tjhe movie moves along fine adn slowy builds tothe the climax of the wedding
. kline st
ands at the altar
and is asked to take his vows
.
.
. if you want to be suprized
, don
' t read
, i am going to reveal tjhe ending
.
.
.
. instead of saying
" i do
" in front of his parents
and most ofthe the town
,
and even some cameras
, he says
" i
' m gay
.
" this is where the movie
, inaddition my opinion falls apart
. most of the humor in the film had come from kline
' s insistence thta he was straight
, while at the same time
, loving peotry
and bieng a senstivie guy
, dressing well
,
and occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me of the
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch from saturday night live
. it was funny
, it wass sustainably funny
,
and kline
' s performance made it doubly so
.
however
, after tghe wedding
, tyhe film drags on
. they should hvea attempted to come to a quick conclusion
,
but it
then gets into the serious side of what he
' s done
. he reconciles with his parents
and his friends
, some of which had turned on him
. htere are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time
, tje scene with his mother
and her friends
, which ws hillarious
, seemed pointless
,
and the scene with tom selleck infact the bar wiht joan seemed pointless
. finaly
, even
though i am nto catholic
, i found the scene with the priest tothe be condescending
. the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years
and hadnt not consumated the relatiopnship
, proclaming to brackett in the third person
,
" he
' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle from hte audience
,
but i wass distracted by it
, annd began tothe tire of tje film
. by yhe time teh wedding hadnt come anbd gone
, i found myself hoping it would be over soon
.
( much like this review you are saying
) overall
, if i hvae to quantify it
, i say
, rising action gets
*
*
*
* adn climax
and falling action gets
. see it in eceonomy timne
.
