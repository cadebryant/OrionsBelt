_ soldier
_ is h
ands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn
' t have jean claude van damme in it
. i could liken it tothe tje sci
- fi cheese that was thte hollywood product
- of
- choice back infront the early 80s
,
but thast would be too much of a compliment
. if there isnt a movei theater in hell
, this film isnt playing ther 24 hours a day
. the story
, such that there is
, revolves aroud todd
( kurt russell
)
, an automaton of a man who hasnt been rised ffrom birth tothe be a merciless solider in a nto
- too
- distant ultra
- conservative future
( is htere any other kind
?
) affter years of desensitization at a miltary academy full of other boys jsut like him
, todd becomes a ground fighter in a series ofthe wars all over the galaxy
. who the enemies infront these wars are isnt never revealed
,
but yhe few glimpses of todd inthe battle sohw that it doesn
' t matter
, because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys
. after ten mintues of tihs nihilistic trash
-
- yes folks
, there
' s moreso
-
- we see todd as a buff
, scarred adult
, now so accustomed to tyhe carnage that noone confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat
. there
' s a new wrinkle
,
though
. todd adn his bretheren are declared obsolete
,
and a new batch of soliders takes thier place
. after losing a sanctioned battle with
_ dragon
_
' s jason scott lee
, hte seamingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice
- cube tray
( well
, that
' s what is looked liuke
) onthe a remote garbage planet
. if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet
,
and that they b
and together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them
, you
' re way ahead ofthe the game
. the renegade society onthe this trash heap is so clich you half
- expect tina turner
and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute
. it
' s surprising thyat
_ soldier
_ is the brain
- child ofthe
_ blade runner
_ co
- writer david webb peoples
. unlike that mind
- twisting clasic
, this film contains just barely anough dialogue tothe fill about three double
- spaced pages
. add inot the mix tyhe
_ mortal kombat
_
' s paul
anderson inept direction
, anbd it
' s eazy to see how
_ solider
_ turned outloud so bad
.
and the special effects
! remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars
? gary busey is in this movie
.
' nuff said
.
_ soldier
_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting inthe its script vaults
. thyat this sad film made it to tjhe silver screen shouldnt encourage plenty ofthe aspiring screenwriters out there thta there is hope after all
. now if you
' ll excuse me
, i have to go weep for the future
.
