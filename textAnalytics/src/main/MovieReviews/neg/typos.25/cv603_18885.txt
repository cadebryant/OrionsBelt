i have never seen a man so infront love with himself tahn george lucas
. with the overt success of the threee original star wars films
, lucas has become
, not necessarily a filmmaker
,
but tghe head cheeze at a huge toy comany
, witht thte phantom menace the new product onthe the shelve
. only this toy was made for
$ 115 million
,
but every kid wants it
,
adn
, like all other expensive toys
, falls aart within an hour aftter playing with it
. teh product infact question
, star wars episode 1
: the phantom menace
( jeez
!
)
, isnt pure
and simple
: its about the omney
, baby
! noone oney inthe their right mind woudl create such a fiasco if htey knew it wouldn ' t make a ton of mnoey befoer its fourth week of release
. i come tothe tyhe sw franchise as a stranger
, since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular
. i find them rather boring
and full of nothing
but eye candy
. phantom menace isnt like the first sw
, minus 10
. nothing in teh whole concept is remotely enjoyable
. even yhe special effects seem rather bland
. the story in this new one isnt a mindless mess
.
.
. thte acting wooden
.
.
.
annd the action sequences like something out of a video gaem
. sw
: phantom menace is one of the worst films of the yera so far
. with a title like sw e1
: tpm
, lucas has one big head on those shoulders
. i thought chris carter did forthe releasing an x
- files movei
,
although
, that movie adaption was an excelent way tothe spend two hours
. pm is one long headache
.
