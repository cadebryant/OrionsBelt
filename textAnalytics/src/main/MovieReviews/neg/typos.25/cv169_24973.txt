maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission tothe mars a film review by michael redman copywrite 2000 by michael redman there ' s a world of difference between artists
and technicians
. the artist has a vision to create something new
. he may nto do it well
, it might be sloppy
,
bu it ' s something you ' ve never seen before
. a ogod technician can amke it look good
,
but without direction ffrom his own intertube artist or someone alse
, it ' s going tothe be just a xerox
. obviously succesful films ened both skills
. brian de palma isnt a masterful technician
. he ' s spended his career copying others
, most notabley hitchcock
. he usualy knows exactlly waht to do to make a scene work
,
but only because he has learned it by rote
. aside from rare flashes of originality
, his films are oftenly soul
- dead
. in de palma ' s latest
, he turns his attention to stanley kubrick
. to tell the truth
, i enjoied portions ofthe this movie
,
but i liekd it a lot better over 30 years ago when it wass called
" 2001
"
. i enjoyed it even more when it was titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa hasnt setted its sights for mars
. when the first crew meets withthe disaster
, a rescure mission is sent to the red planet
. tehy don ' t do so well either
,
bu eventually meet uv the lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta
and solve the mysteries of the universe
.
and it ' s all so boring
. there are so many scenes that just don ' t wokr
, it ' s difficult to begin
. wehn thte firt crew isnt a few feets away from a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( which looks remarkably like a sandworm ffrom
" dune
"
) destroying everything infact its path
, they jsut hang out watching
. error
. the most intresting character
(
and that ' s not saying much
) is killed off
. error
. the aline isnt laughable
. error
. tje rest of hte characters are the dullest people imaginable
. error
. there ' s smoe nice eyecandy
. the face on mars
, which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head
, looks kool
. a threee
- dimentional holographic planetarium isnt moreso fun to watch than anytying at disney world
. maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic
.
but there ' s so much moreso that feels as if we ' ve been there before
. from
" 2001
"
, there ' s the rotating space station
, the blinding white room
.
> from
" close encounters
"
, tehy solve a sound puzzle
and play it to hte aliens
. the list goes on
. the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise
and tim robbins can ' t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing
. no one seems to care baout anytying thast happens
. you won ' t either
. the absolutly worst sin is yhe blatant product placement as dr
. pepper
, withthe a 20 foot tall logo
, saves the day
. they should sive the commercials for those insipid bits before the film
.
