maybe this mission shoud have been scrubbed mission tothe mars a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman htere
' s a world of diference between artists
and technicians
. the artist hasnt a vision tothe create something newyorker
. he may not do it well
, it might be sloppy
,
but it
' s something yuo
' ve never seen before
. a good technician can make it look good
,
but wihtout direction from his own inner artist or someone else
, it
' s going tothe be just a xerox
. obviously successful films need both skills
. brian de palma is a masterful technician
. he
' s spent his career copying others
, most notabley hitchcock
. he usually knows exactly wqat to do tothe make a scene work
,
but onyl because he has learned it by rote
. aside ffrom rare flashes of originality
, his films are often soul
- dead
. in de palma
' s latest
, he turns his attension to stanley kubrick
. to tell the truth
, i enjoyed portions of this movie
, bu i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called
" 2001
"
. i enjoied it even more when it ws titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa has setted its sights for mars
. when the first crew meets with diaster
, a rescue mission is sent to the red planet
. htey don
' t do so well either
, bu eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta annd solve thge mysteries ofthe the universe
.
and it
' s all so boring
. there are so many scenes thta just don
' t owrk
, it
' s difficult to begin
. when the first crew is a fewd feet away from a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( which looks remarkably liuke a s
andworm ffrom
" dune
"
) destroying everthing inthe its path
, they just hang out watching
. error
. the most interesting character
(
and that
' s nto saying much
) is killed off
. error
. the alien isnt laughable
. error
. the rest ofthe the characters are tjhe dullest people imaginable
. error
. there
' s some nice eyec
andy
. the face onthe mars
, which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head
, looks cool
. a three
- dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun tothe watch than anything at disney world
. maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic
. bu there
' s so much more that feels as if we
' ve been there befoer
. from
" 2001
"
, there
' s the rotating space station
, the blinding white room
.
> from
" close encounters
"
, they solve a sound puzzle adn play it to teh aliens
. the list goes onthe
. the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise
and tim robbins can
' t muster enough emotion tothe convince us they are breathing
. no one seems to care about anything tyhat happens
. you won
' t either
. the absolutely worst sin is hte blatant product placement as dr
. pepper
, with a 20 foot tall logo
, saves the day
. they shoudln save the commercials for thsoe insipid bits before the film
.
