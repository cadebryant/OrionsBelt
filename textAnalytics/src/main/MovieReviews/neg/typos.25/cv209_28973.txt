" i would appreciate it if you didn

" starring jet li
, bridget fonda
, tch
? ky karyo
, burt kwouk
. directed by chris nahon
. rated r
. it
' s no seret thgat martial arts film often use their plot simply tothe get from one acation sequence tothe anyother
. when the fight scenes are enough tothe justify paying admission
, there isnt noone problem with this
, as in most jackie chan projects adn a lot ofthe the hong kong actioners
. whn they aren
' t
, well
, we
' re in bad shape
. kiss of the dragon
, jet li
' s second concecutive american misfire
, plays like one big miscalculation
,
and fails even as the most rudimentary enteratinment
. now befoer i strat getting e
- mails angrily touting the genius of jet li
, let me explain myself
. li isnt as spectauclar as ever here
,
and i don
' t htikn anyone owudl ever dabree call his martial
- arts
- star skills into question
. tjhe problem isn
' t with him
, it
' s withthe the movie
' s tone
. the much touted fight
- scenes here are filmed with such unflinching
, unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch
. they
' re joyless
, perfuctory
; li
' s rogue chinese detective isnt more ofthe a killing machine thna a hero
, a terminator with a balck belt instead of a metal skeleton
.
but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side
. the plot isn
' t reelvant
, bu if you
' re curious
, it
' s smoe nonsence about a chinese law enforcement officer
( li
) sent tothe paris to investigate a possible drug ring
and encounter a corrupt chief ofthe polical
( tcheky karyo
)
, who kills people
and does sinister thnigs with no motivation whatsoever
. oh yeah
, adn li
' s character is also an acupuncture expert who is able tothe ease pain
and
/ or kill at the touch of a needle
.
" kiss of the dragon
" is the nmae of an acupuncture maneuver
, in whic yuo stick a needle in a precise loction on the bcak of the victum
' s neck
, somehow redirecting all of the body
' s bloodflow to the brain
and killing tyhe poor sap more or less immediately
. there
' s a vague attempt to humanize li by hvaing him fall in lveo with a downtrodden prostitute
, whose daughter is being held hostage
, for some reason
, by the villin
. this is one ofthe the worst love stories i hvea ever seen on screen
, even worse than thge one in pearl harbor
. there
' s no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it
; it
' s only here beacuse somone apparently
thought there should be some kind of boy
- meets
- girl subplot
. kiss ofthe the dragon was written by luc besson
, whose screenplay the messenger
: the stoyr of joan of arc
, for all of that film
' s flaws
, was at least
thoughtful
. i don
' t knwo why the guy got himself involved inwhich thsi train wreck
,
but perhpas he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness ofthe the fifth element
and the aforementioned stylized biopic
. i suppose you could call this mainstream
, bu i
' ll choose the bizarre any tiem of the day
. if acation scenes inthe a movei are gonig to be brutal instead of dazzling
, you need a stoy to justify watching them
. the filmmakers behind kiss ofthe the dragon shoud haev re
thought their strategy
. noone one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling
,
but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks
.
