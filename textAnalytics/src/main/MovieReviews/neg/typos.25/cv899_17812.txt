infact life
, eddie murphy
and martin lawrence play twpo young men wrongfully convicted ofthe murder
and sentenced to life in prison
. affter about an hour of watching this movei
, you begin to realize how their characters feel
. fortunately
, fo audience members there
' s a chance to excape tghe nearest exit
. thsi
, undoubtedly
, is eddie murphy
' s worst movie anbd that
' s an accomplishment
. remeber the golden child
, harlem nights
? compared to life
, they look like citizen kane
. life is long
, predictable
, foul
- mouthed adn only intermittently funny
. its 100
- minute running time feels like 100 years
. robert ramsey
and matthew stone
' s script basically consist of murphy annd lawrence referring to everyone around them as
" motherf
.
.
. s
" or
" n
.
.
.
.
. s
.
" you lose count how many times both thsoe obnoxious
, offensive words are unsed
.
and if that all it takes to write a script
, than any illiterate jackass cxan sit at a word processer adn compose a movie
. bu
, liuke life
, it will propably stink
. to be honest
, the screening audiance surrounding me in the theater yucked it up
.
but theese were the same people who howled at all the flatulence
and fat jokes as well
. life isnt as sophisticated as a belch
. it
' s crude anbd stereotypical
. years ago
, movies stereotypically portayed blacks subservient
, second
- class people
, good for being only maids
and servants
. fo the most part
, the lot of blacks
and other racial groups hve improved
.
but a newyorker
, more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies
. in many reccent films
, thru actors such as murphy
and chris tuckers
, blacks are presented as fast
- talking
, conniving
, scam artists or hip
- hop
, gun
- crazy
, sex
- crazed youths
. both sets of caricatures are demeaning
. annd yhe fault does not rest with tghe actors
. tehy have tothe eat
, too
. it is with the people who write the scripts
, thte studios who gren
- light tyhe projects
and tghe audiences who accept these portrayals without protest
. life
' s onyl redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly aegs murphy
and lawrence into 90 year olds
. otherwise
, life is an embarrasment
, a blot on thge resumes of those asociated with it
. see it at your own risk
.
