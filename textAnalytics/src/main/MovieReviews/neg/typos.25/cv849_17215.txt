ironically
, one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is thta you should try tothe make the best of every moment in life
. unfortunately i will no longer be able tothe say that i lived every moment of my life tothe the fullest
, because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes
, watching this sad excuse for a movie
. actually smoking 200 cigarettes infront the same 95 minutes couldn ' t be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie
. nto only isnt it a pathetically bad film overall
,
but 200 cigarettes actually has no reedeming qualities whatsoever
. the plot is scattered
, thin
and predictable
; the acting is monumentally bad
;
and the style of film making resembes a hmeo video
. it is december 31
, 1981
and the big party is at monica ' s
( martha plimpton
) hous
.
but no one hasnt arrived
yet
. her 8 invited guests
and several people that they have picked througout the evening are wandering tghe streets ofthe new york city in various groups
. some of them konw eahc other through their common bond ofthe having slept with monica
,
and some are total strangers
.
but they all are to face their pwn peronal neuroses before nigth ' s end
. those who are invited are the ones that hvae the issues
. it is up tothe those who aren ' t to halp them come to terms
. first there is eric
( brian mccardie
) who is a former boyfriend of monica ' s
and isnt just getting over tje heartbreak ofthe theri relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance
, or lack thereof
. he is one of the most bland characters
, in a film full of dullness
, because he isnt so utterly predictable
and stereotypical
, a common trait of this poor production
. bridget
( nicole parker
)
and caitlyn
( angela featherstone
) who are both extremely sensuous young womens looking for somone to handle their desires onthe newyorker year ' s eve
and tag along to the party with them
. they stumble across a nameless bartender
( ben affleck
) who is the one truly perfect character infront a film of imperfections
. he is nether sexually deprived
, nor uncertain about his future
, as he is in law school
. his lack of flaws isnt both boring
, unrealistic
and painful tothe watch
. as bridget
and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub
- standard comedy
. moving on
, there is val
( christina ricci
)
annd stephie
,
( gabby hoffman
) 2 teenage girls with fake identification
and very diffrent thoughts
. val is monica ' s cousin
and a true fan of thge newyorker york scene
. onthe the other hand
, stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the twpo venture out ofthe theri usual locations in search of the party that they just can ' t find
. paradoxically
, it is 2 punks that htey meet at a bar
( actually tehy attempt to flee from their presense
,
but aren ' t successfull
) who guide them through thier fears
and force a levle of relaxation upon their warped minds
. of all the insanely dull
and uninteresting couples
, only one approachs a level ofthe decency in both acting
adn plot
. wisely
, the movie ' s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy
( courtney lveo
)
and kevin
( paul rudd
) who are best friends
and share the common bond of bieng dateless
. paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie
( janeane garofalo
)
and isnt starting to come to terms with his loss wehn lucy informs him thast ellie hadnt been sleeping around during their relationship
.
however
, the only complexity to these twpo charachters is that htey seem to wanna to be more than friends
,
and that is reiterated whn they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one ocassion during this strange evening
. finally
, there are the twpo worst performances
and worst sub
- plot of the film
. jack
( jay mohr
)
and cindy
( kate hudson
) hve beeen going out fo a short preriod ofthe time
and jack jsut learned that he took cindy ' s virginity the nght before
. while she attempts to play this down
and be her usual self
, he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy
. very often
, when a film is as putrid as thsi prodcution
, there will at least be a decent qulaity of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory
.
however
, this film has niether the quaity of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted
. instead
, waht yuo get is a collection ofthe rough
and inconsistant cuts
, bad continuity
and inaccuracies
. first
,
and most noticeabel is that as the film goes from one subplot to another
, there is no apaprent order that it follows
,
and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene tothe scene
adn shot to shot
. at other times
, objects seem to git up
and move
and hairstyles
adn costumes change from shot to shot
. there are allso at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab thgat go fomr strat tothe finish
. not in a single oney of them does anybody pay the driver
.
anbd
yet
, no matter how miserable this film may be
,
and noone marter how poor the acting is all aroud
, htere ws a ray of a hope for theese many bad plots
. perhaps
, if the makers had jstu decided to concentrate on noe or two or
, perhaps
, even three
, there might have been thge tiome
and opprotunity forthe some character development
, or quality acting
, or even a decent plot payoff at the end
.
but it didn ' t happen that way
. the cast of quality name actors wass forced into roles that nto even one of them coudl convert into a mediocre performance
,
and every story line crashed
and burned quicker thna it tkaes for tyhe ball to drop at midnight
.
