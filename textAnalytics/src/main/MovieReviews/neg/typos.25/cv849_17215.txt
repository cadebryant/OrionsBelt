ironicly
, oney of the themes of 200 cigarettes isnt that you shoudl try to amke thge best of every moment infront life
. unfortunately i will noone longer be able tothe say that i lived every moment ofthe my life to thge fullest
, because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good mintues
, watching this sad excuse for a movei
. actually smoking 200 cigarettes inthe the same 95 minutes couldn
' t be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie
. not only is it a pathetically bad film overall
,
but 200 cigarettes accually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
. tje plot is scattered
, thin
and predictable
; the acting is monumentally bad
;
and the style ofthe film making resembles a home video
. it is december 31
, 1981
and thte big party is at monica
' s
( martha plimpton
) house
. bu no one hasnt arrived yot
. her 8 invited guests
and sevral people that they have picked throughtout the evening are w
andering the streets ofthe new york city in various groups
. some of them konw each other through their common bond of having slept wih monica
,
and some are total strangers
.
but they all are to face thier own personal neuroses before night
' s end
. those who are invited are the ones that have thte issues
. it is up to those who aren
' t to help them cmo to terms
. firt there is eric
( brian mccardie
) who is a fromer boyfriend of monica
' s
and is just getting over the heartbreak ofthe their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performence
, or lack thereof
. he is one of the most bl
and cahracters
, in a film full of dullness
, because he isnt so utterly predictable adn stereotypical
, a common trait ofthe this poor production
. bridget
( nicole parker
)
and caitlyn
( angela featherstone
) who are both extremely sensuous young womens looking for someone to h
andle their desires on new year
' s eve anbd tag allong to the party with them
. they stumble across a nameless bartender
( ben affleck
) who isnt the noe truly perfect character in a film of imperfections
. he is nether sexually deprived
, nor uncertain about his future
, as he is inthe law school
. his lack of flaws isnt both boring
, unrealistic
and painful tothe watch
. as bridget
and caitlyn make passes at him you are niether entertained nor humored by the sub
- st
andard comedy
. moving on
, there is val
( christina ricci
)
and stephie
,
( gabby hoffman
) 2 teenage girls with fake indentification annd very different
thoughts
. val is monica
' s cousin
and a true fan of the new york scene
. on the otehr h
and
, stephie isnt conviced that she is vulnerable to crime whn the two venture outloud of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can
' t find
. paradoxically
, it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar
( actually they attempt tothe flee from their presense
,
but aren
' t successful
) who giude them through their fears
and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds
. of all the insanely dull
and uninteresting couples
, onyl one approaches a level ofthe decency in both acting annd plot
. wisely
, the movie
' s creators ahev put heavy emphasis onthe lucy
( courtney love
) adn kevin
( paul rudd
) who are best friends
and share thge common bond of being dateless
. paul hasnt just broken up with long time steady ellie
( janeane garofalo
)
and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie hadnt been sleeping around during their relatiopnship
. howver
, the only complexity to these two characters is that tehy seem to want to be more tahn friends
,
and that is reiterated when htey attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on omre than one ocassion during this strange evening
. finally
, there are the two worst performances
and worst sub
- plot of the film
. jack
( jay mohr
)
and cindy
( kate hudson
) hvea beeen going outloud forthe a short preiod of time
and jack jsut learned that he tookover cindy
' s virginity the night befor
. while she attempts tothe play this down
and be her usual self
, he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night st
ands that includes the recently deflowered cindy
. vyre often
, when a film is as putrid as tihs prodcution
, there will at least be a decent quality of film mkaing tothe reveal an occasional moment ofthe glory
. howver
, this film hasnt neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted
. instead
, what you get isnt a collecton of rough
and inconsistent cuts
, bad continuity
and inaccuracies
. first
, annd most noticeable is that as tje film goes ffrom one subplot tothe another
, ther is no appparent order that it follows
, adn it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene tothe scene
and shot tothe shot
. at other times
, objects seem tothe git uv
and move anbd hairstyles
and costumes chanage from shooted to shooted
. there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab taht go from start to finish
. nto in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver
.
and
yet
, no matter how miserable this film may be
,
and no matter how poor yhe acting isnt all around
, there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots
. perheaps
, if the makers hadnt jstu decided tothe concentrate onthe one or two or
, perhaps
, even threee
, there might haev been the time
and oportunity forthe some character development
, or qualtiy acting
, or even a decent plot payoff at the end
. bu it didn
' t happen that way
. the cast of quality name actors ws forced into roles that not even oen of them coudl convert into a mediocre performance
,
and every stroy line crashed
and burned quicker thna it tkaes for the ball to drop at midnight
.
