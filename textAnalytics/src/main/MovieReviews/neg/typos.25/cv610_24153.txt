` ready to rumble
' isnt not bieng helmed by the farrelly brothers
, nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer wiht anything even remotely clever or inspired
.
` ready to rumble

. which
, in fact
, sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy

but director brian robbins anbd screenwriter steven brill h

. oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure
? he
' s perhaps a bit chunky

but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in tje ring by calling him
