ther should be a requirment that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq inspite order to see
" mission tothe mars
.
" there are probably qtuie a faw people who are gonig to enjoy it
,
and most ofthe them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind
.
but there are those who will not
, adn thsoe will most likely be people who have aready seen one or more ofthe the follwoing movies
:
" 2001
: a space odyssey
,
"
" armagddon
,
"
" apollo 13
,
"
" the abyss
,
"
" close encounters of the thrid kind
,
"
" e
. t
. the extra
- terrestrial
,
"
" alien
,
"
and
" aliens
.
" why
? because htere isnt nto one original idea in
" mission to mars
.
" all ofthe it is cribbed from otehr films
(
and in most cases
, better films
)
. if this is tghe sort ofthe thing you don
' t mind
, yuo might like tyhe film
. of course
, there are other reasons nto tothe liuke
" mission tothe mars
,
" yhe main one being a scirpt written by peopel who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven
' t used their brains inthe some time
,
and who don
' t intend to start druing the film
' s running time
.
" mission to mars
" manages to be both stupid
and boring at thte same time
. the plot
, cribbed greatly from
" 2001
,
" concerns a team sent to mars
, the first manned trip ever made to tyhe red planet
. luke graham
( don cheadle
) leads the team
, jointly formed of americans
and russians
. the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a stange pulse
( this bieng nothing liek thte pulse
- emitting monolith in
" 2001
"
-
- thgat one was on the
* moon
*
)
, bu when htey try to study it
, a giant s
and tornado comes out of the top annd swallows them
( all except luke
, who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station
, whlch looks strangely liuke the rotating space station in
" 2001
"
)
. a rescure mission is planned wiht husb
and
& wife team woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and terri fisher
( connie nielsen
)
, obligatory pilot witht a troubled past jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
,
and extra crew member phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
) along for yhe ride
. aftter some zero
- gravity dancing
, htey run into problems whn one of their engines is blown
, forcing them to attempt a desperate l
anding aboard a suply vessel
. now str
anded onthe mars with minimal supplies
, the team must decide whether or nto it cin risk entering the monolith or if tehy should return home
. after all
, that monolith just might contain infomation baout how life originated on earth
.
" mission to mars
" is noe of those films that makes a critic wonder where tothe start when talking about all the things that are wrong witht it
, so let
' s start with one of the thigns that does work
: director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during tghe middle ofthe the film
. that
' s it
. everything else fails
. thge failure isn
' t de palma
' s fault
; he
' s wokring ffrom an atrocious script
. only during the sequence aboard the ship
( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel inthe
" 2001
"
) where the rescue team
' s air begins running out
and they must frantically search for tghe hole
and patch it up does
" mission to mars
" come to life
. a scene where htey atempt to save a comrade floating away into spoace also provides smoe tension
, until you realize that the entire danger
/ more danger
/ attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film
; it
' s jsut a contrived way to ganerate thrilling scenes
. take it out
,
and the plot isn
' t affected in any way
. tjhe sequence alsot suffers from a few plot holes
( as does the rest of the film
)
: why is the ship
' s computer
( wich sounds strangely like hal from
, uh
,
" 2001
"
) able to dectect a hole in the main chamber
but not one iin the engine
? why doed tim robbins
' charcter have to go outside the ship wehn the solution easily presented itself ffrom inside
? shouldn
' t the astronauts be better trained to deal iwth a hull breach
? why are the characters such idiots
? because thge script makse little attempt tothe propperly develope them
. all thge
" conflict
" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the oppening scene
( whlch rips off orson welles
and robert altman by utilizing a long oppening tracking shot
) during which the charactors repeteadly tell each other about things all ofthe them should already know
:
" jim
, it
' s too bad you can
' t go onthe htis mission because you were determined
' psychologically inadquate
' because your wife died right before yuo were to go on the mission toghether
"
-
- does anyone really talk liek this
? can
' t we find out these thigns inspite a less grating matter
, like maybe in a flashback
? thte whole film is like that
. the filmmakers are not content tothe merely show us something annd asume we know what
' s going on
; tehy must
* tell
* us exactly what we
' re looking at
* eveyr
* time
. sample dialogue from the film
:
( shot of mars
) astronaut a
:
" look
, there
' s mars
" astronaut b
:
" you sure that
' s mars
?
" astronaut a
:
" yeah
, that
' s mars all right
.
" astronaut c
:
" hey
, are you guys looking at mars
?
" that excange isn
' t actually in
" mission to mars
,
"
but i wouldn
' t be surprized if it were
. for all their cribbing from kubrick
, spielberg
, james cameron
,
and even ron howard
, the makers ofthe this film haven
' t learned to do something all those directors did very well
: sohw
and don
' t tell
. de palma used tothe know how
,
but seems tothe have forgotten
. this is mentally
- challanged filmmaking
; tehy assume the audience won
' t get waht
' s going on
, so they expalin everything five times over
. fouth
- graders may appretiate this
,
but omre learned viewers wiull hve their intelligence insulted
. the principal actors sleepwalk their way through
" mission to mars
,
" never managing to do away with an appraent
" i
' m just here to git a paycheck
" attitude
. cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines
. armin mueller
- stahl manages to thoroughly embarras himself in an unbilled cameo
. robbins puts his game face onthe
and phones inwhich his st
andart
" decent guy
" performance
.
and sinise hams it up with
" wistful
" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife
( palyed by kim delaney
, who onyl has one scene during whitch she still manages tothe deliver some rediculous dialogue in a heavy
- h
anded monologue about yhe meaning of life
)
,
and especially during the stolen
- from
- no
- less
- than
- three
- movies
( a lollipop tothe whoever names them
) conclusion
, which combines endless
, obvious explaination anbd sub
- par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality
and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying teh show up unil
then
.
and of course
, these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution ofthe life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in
" 2001
" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth
; those aliens weere ffrom an
* unknown
* world
. it could be said taht fans of brainless acation films might enjoy
" mission to mars
,
" bu such a comment ignores the fatc tath the film is allso incredibly slow
- going
. leisurely pacing might have helped a film wtih a little omre substance to it
, bu all of the substance ofthe
" mission to mars
" has been stolen from otehr films
,
and those other films dealt with thier ideas in a much more
thoughtful fasion
and generally contained more engaging charachters
. supposedly we
' re intended tothe choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one
( totally different from the one
- character
- decides
- not
- to
- return ending of
" armageddon
"
)
,
but i suspect most peopel iwll either be laughing or groaning
. me
, i alternated between the twpo
. ther is only noe good thing about tjhe way
" mission to mars
" finally ends
: the fact that the movie isnt over
.
