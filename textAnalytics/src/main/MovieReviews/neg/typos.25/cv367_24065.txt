there shouldnt be a requirement tath a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order tothe see
" mission to mars
.
" there are probably quite a few people who are gogin to enjoy it
,
and most ofthe them wiull propably be thsoe who hve seen veyr few films of its kind
.
but there are thsoe who will not
,
anbd those iwll most likely be peple who have alread seen one or more of the following movies
:
" 2001
: a space odyssey
,
"
" armgeddon
,
"
" apollo 13
,
"
" the abyss
,
"
" close encounters of the third kind
,
"
" e
. t
. the extra
- terrestrial
,
"
" alien
,
"
adn
" aliens
.
" why
? because there is not one original diea in
" mission tothe mars
.
" all ofthe it is cribbed from other films
(
and inaddition most cases
, better films
)
. if this is the sort ofthe thing you don ' t mind
, you might liek the film
. of course
, htere are other reasons not to liek
" mission to mars
,
" the main oney bieng a script written by people who seem tothe assume their audience is filled with people who haven ' t used their brains in some time
,
and who don ' t intend tothe start during the film ' s running time
.
" mission to mars
" manages to be both stupid
anbd boring at the smae time
. the plot
, cribbed greatly from
" 2001
,
" concerns a team sent to mars
, the first manned trip ever made to the red planet
. luke graham
( don cheadle
) leads the team
, jointly fromed of americans
and russians
. the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse
( this being nothing like tyhe pulse
- emitting monolith in
" 2001
"
-
- tyhat noe was onthe hte
* moon
*
)
,
but when they try to study it
, a giant sand tornado comes outloud of the top
and swallows them
( all except luke
, who survives long anough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station
, which looks strangely like the rotating space station in
" 2001
"
)
. a rescue mission is planned wiht husband
& wife team woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and terri fisher
( connie nielsen
)
, obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
,
anbd extra crew memeber phil ohlmyer
( jerry o ' connell
) along for the ride
. aftter smoe zero
- gravity dancing
, htey run into problems when one of their engines isnt blown
, forcing them to atempt a edsperate landing aboard a supply vessel
. now stranded onthe mars with minimal supplies
, the team must decide whether or nto it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return hmeo
. after all
, that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth
.
" mission to mars
" isnt oen of thsoe films that makes a critic wonder where to start wehn tlaking about all the things that are wrong with it
, so let ' s start with one of the things that doesnt work
: director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of thte film
. that ' s it
. everthing else fails
. the failure isn ' t de palma ' s fault
; he ' s working fomr an atrocious script
. only during thte sequence aboard yhe ship
( looking an awful lot liek the jupiter vessel in
" 2001
"
) where the rescue team ' s air begins running out
and they must frantically search for the hole
and patch it up doesnt
" mission to mars
" cmo to life
. a scene where they attemt tothe sive a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension
, until ytou realize that thge entire danger
/ more danger
/ attempted rescue sequence has absolutly nothing to do with the rest of the film
; it ' s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes
. tkae it out
,
adn hte plot isn ' t affected inthe any way
. the sequence allso suffers from a few plot holes
( as does tje rest of the film
)
: why is the ship ' s coputer
( which soudns strangely like hal from
, uh
,
" 2001
"
) able to detect a hole in the main chamber
but not one in thge engine
? why did tim robbins ' character have tothe go outside yhe ship whn the solution easily presented itself from inside
? shouldn ' t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach
? why are the characters such idiots
? becasue thte script makes littel attempt to properly develope them
. all thte
" conflict
" is clumsily delivered inthe excruciatingly obvious exposition in the oppening scene
( which rips off orson welles
and robert altman by utilizing a long oppening tracking shot
) during which the characters repeteadly tell eahc other about things all ofthe them should already know
:
" jim
, it ' s too bad you can ' t go on this mission because you were determined ' psychologically inadiquate ' because your wief died right before you were to go on the mission together
"
-
- does anyone really talk like this
? can ' t we find out these things in a less grating matter
, liuke maeby iin a flashback
? the whole film is like tht
. the filmmakers are not content to merely sohw us something
and assume we know wqat ' s going onthe
; tehy must
* tell
* us exactly what we ' re looking at
* eveyr
* time
. sample dialogue ffrom the film
:
( shot of mars
) astronaut a
:
" look
, there ' s mars
" astronaut b
:
" you sure that ' s mars
?
" astronaut a
:
" yeah
, that ' s mars all right
.
" astronaut c
:
" hey
, are you guys looking at mars
?
" tht exchange isn ' t actually in
" mission to mars
,
"
but i wouldn ' t be suprised if it were
. for all their cribbing from kubrick
, spielberg
, james cameron
,
and even ron howard
, the makers of this film haven ' t learned to do something all those directors doed very well
: show
and don ' t tell
. de palma used to know how
,
but seems to have forgotten
. this is menally
- challanged filmmaking
; they assume the audience won ' t get what ' s gonig on
, so htey explain everything five times over
. fourth
- graders may appreciate tihs
,
but more learned viewers will hve their intelligence insulted
. the principal actors sleepwalk their way through
" mission to mars
,
" never managing to do away with an apparent
" i ' m jsut here to get a paycheck
" attitide
. cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines
. armin mueller
- stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo
. robbins puts his agme face on
and phones in his standard
" decent guy
" performence
.
adn sinise hams it up with
" wistful
" facial expressions hwile watching tapes of his dead wife
( played by kim delaney
, who only has oen scene durring which she still manages to deliver smoe ridiculous dialogue in a heavy
- handed monologue about the meaninng of life
)
,
and especialy during the stolen
- from
- noone
- less
- than
- three
- movies
( a lollipop to whoever names them
) conclusion
, which combines endless
, obvious explaination
and sub
- par cgi effects withthe gagging sentimentality
anbd is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until
then
.
and of course
, these aliens ffrom mars who facilitated the evolution ofthe life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in
" 2001
" who facilitated yhe evolution of life onthe earth
; thsoe aliens were from an
* unknown
* world
. it could be said tyhat fans ofthe brainless acation films might enjoy
" mission to mars
,
"
but such a comment ignores the fact tath the film is also incredibly slow
- gonig
. leisurely pacing might have helpped a film wih a littel omre substance to it
,
but all of the substance of
" mission to mars
" hasnt been stolen from other films
,
and those otehr films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion
and generally contained more engaging characters
. supposedly we ' re intended tothe choke up when one character decides nto to return home at the end of this one
( totally different from the one
- carachter
- decides
- not
- to
- return ending of
" armgeddon
"
)
,
but i suspect most peple will eather be laughing or groaning
. me
, i alternated between the two
. ther is only oney ogod thnig about tghe way
" mission tothe mars
" finally ends
: the fact thast hte movie is over
.
