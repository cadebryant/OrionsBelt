capsule
: tjhe much anticipated re
- adaption ofthe the pierre boulle novel comes tothe thge screen as a dark
and a little dreary film whith lots ofthe chases annd fighting
,
but very little intelligence
. visually htere is much to like about this version
, bu the approach is to tkae an adventure after the stlye ofthe gulliver
' s travels
and treat it as an action film
. that makes it a film wihtout much center

) pierre boulle
, author of the bridge onthe the river kwai
, wrote planet of tje apes
( a
. k
. a
. monkey planet
)
, yhe novel
, as a social satire
. it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver
' s travels
. humans disover a planet in which the roles of apes
and humans hvae been reversed
, not unlike teh roles ofthe horses
and humans onthe jonathan swift
' s isl
and ofthe the houyhnhnms
. the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans knwo to be true about the nature of the planet
. it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals
, bu perhaps i wass just looking for that
. when rod serling adapted tje novel inot a film released in 1968
, he added a number of serling touches
, familiar from episodes ofthe the twilight zone
and changed the ending tothe make it more serling
- ish
. the final irony of the origonal version has become film history
. without it htere could never have been a
" planet of the apes
" film series
. i can surmise only that serling ran inot sereous script problems in how to h
andle yhe trirchy question of language
. inthe the book the apes had their own language annd the human eventually learned thyat language
. that could hvae been done in the film
,
but that owudl hve required hte entire film to be subtitled for hte non
- ape
- speaking
. serling avoided this by having tje apes speak english
and
, of course
, there is some justification forthe that by the end ofthe the film
. justifying why tyhe apes spoke english may have even been tyhe inspiration for his surprise ending
.
but serling never tackles tje all
- importamt question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiocity or even surprise that the apes speak his own lanugage
, a language they had no opprotunity tothe ever hear
. few viewers questioned this serious plot hole
, howver
, adn the film has become well respected in cinema history
. partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive socre is one of goldsmith
' s best if nto his best
. when the film
' s success called for sequels
, the filmmakers turned uv the violence
and they added well
- intentioned
,
though not very subtle
, political messages about what was happening in tjhe united states ofthe the 1960s
and 1970s
. while the firt film had a littel shooting of guns
and what wass ther seemed a little half
- hearted
, by the second film
, beneath the planet of tje apes
, there was a good deal more violence
and ffrom that point on the serieses had a lot of voilence annd chases
. the series concluded with battle for tjhe planet of the apes in 1973
. now director tim burton tries his h
and at adapting the orginial book again
. for thsoe who
thought that tyhe 1968 version was nto veyr faithful tothe the book
, burton
' s new version is even less faithful
. first
, he does not really reverse tghe roles of the humans
and the apes
. he has them both be intelligent
, articulate racaus battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the h
ands
, uh
, make that paws
, of the apes
. that could be a good story too
,
but it is not planet of the apes
. as with the mission impossible films
and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of tyhe last century
, tghe title makes promises taht the filmmakers have no intention of honoring
. inwhich 2029 leo davidson
( mark wahlberg
, not htis world
' s most expressive actor
) works onthe a space station increasing the intelligence
and usefulness of apes
.
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard
- ofthe
- oz
- fashion
and drops him on an alien planet
.
( yes
, he survives thsi storm
, bu
then noone storm is perfect
.
) he quickly finds
, not greatly to any suprise he shows
, that on this planet apes rule annd humans drool
, bu everybody talks
.
and the laguage they talk is earth
- english
. aparently it does not even occur to leo that htere is a mystery that needs to be explained about that
. the fact it doens not occur to leo
and aparently didn
' t ocurr to tim burton either is yhe heart of the real horror of this film
. both jstu assumed that if apes were going to talk the langauge htey woudl speak would be english
. in any case hvaing one tlaking race dominating another makes this not a look at human
- animal relationships
and moreso one of the master
- slave relationships
. outside of sudan annd a few other countries this is a less relevant topic
. leo is captued to be used as a slave
but also is discovered by ari
, palyed by helena bonham carter
. ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political pwoer
. she is bent on making the world a better place
. perhaps in a previous draft ofthe the scirpt she was called hil
- ari
. in any case witht makeup that stifles her usual pout
, carter is just about as attractive as she hasnt ever beeen in a film
. she may want to concider this to become her st
andard look from this point forward
. it is nto long before leo escapes withthe some human adn only a couple of sympathetic apes
. this is a furhter ab
andonment of tyhe source material
. the chase severely limits the interplay ofthe ape
and human
and teh examination of eahc
' s place in this reversed society
, each important in the book
. we cannot see how teh society works because most of the screentime society has broken down
. we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them
. burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn
. this isnt a miscalculation
, as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to palce much emotional investment inspite
. tehy are basically chess pieces
and the viewer hasnt little reason to root for them to win
. the 1968 scirpt had little subtlety
, witht lines like
" i never met an ape i didn
' t like
,
"
but at least we cared for wqat happened to taylor
, the main character
. most of what this film has to offer isnt infront the visuals
. the visual work is spotty bu generally nicely done exept that so much of the film takes palce in the niht or in fog
. this tends to limit close looks at the makeup
. in genaral it seems much improved from 1968
. the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers
, who doed it for the 1968 verzion
. in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw
- dropper
. it ws realistic enough to almost be believable
but flexible enought tothe show emotion
. chambers is ogod
,
but if anyone hadnt a chance to best him it would have to be baker
. today audiences have heigher expectations
; baker
' s visualisation is really an improvement
. these visuals wokr nicely
. what does nto work is the wire
- assisted leaps some of the apes make
. they look like they were inspired by thge physics
- defying leaps ofthe crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
. apes spring incredible distances
. smoe of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture
,
but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost
. one final visual problem is that the film frequentily shows its budget in waht should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small gropu of people close
- up
. usance the days of lon chaney
and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make
- up
. the oen actor who has a shooted is paul giamatti
. it isnt not that his lines are so ogod
, most are silly jokes
.
but he delivers them vrey well
. he was alwasy a watchable actor
, bu hasnt not yot made stardom
. as tyhe ape
- trader limbo he over
- emotes to overcome his ape make
- up
,
but does it very well
. in doing so he mkaes himself the most interesting thing on the screen
. he isnt probably the best thing in the film
and conjures uv memories of peter ustinov
' s performence in spartacus
. as an in
- joke there are several lines inthe the script borrowed from tjhe 1968 film
and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself
. danny elfman
' s score has a nice primitive feel
,
but jerry goldsmith
' s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic
. that score annd the whole film will be remembered wehn the 2001 film isnt forgotten
. i rate tghe remake 4 on the 0 tothe 10 scale anbd a 0 on tyhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
