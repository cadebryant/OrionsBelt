first impressions
: critically
, a close
- tothe
- awful film
,
but money
- wise
, it has been doing
(
and iwll continue to do
) great
. a sometimes
- funny film thyat sags anbd lags
and oftentimes gets boring
. an orginal plot that grows old real fast
. one ofthe the only 90 minute films that i
' ve gotten borde thru
. men in black has defie the odds
. when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long
, i
thought maybe that this was a poore attempt at an independence day type film that jstu ran out of gas
.
however
, i now relize that not only did men in balck run out of gas
, bu the film in 90 minutes manages tothe show off a very original idea
( which summer audiences have embraced
) tath becomes old about 25 mintues into tjhe movie
. tommy lee jones
and will smith play two
" government
" agents who are responsible for keeping order inthe alien society
. the ridiculous plot beggins when an aline
" bug
"
, played weirdly by vincent d
' onofrio
, who was so great inthe full metal jacket
, l
ands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that
' s somewhere onthe
" orion
' s bilt
.
" anyway
, the basic plot revolves around jones
and smith to stop htis bug from getting the galaxy
, or a higher pwoer will blow uv the earth
. the premise is ridulous
,
but taht is not why i didn
' t like this film
. i lvoe original plots
. this one had an orginal noe
.
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot
: he made tyhe film drag
and alsot put inwhich unncessary elements iin it tht are foudn in romance films
. whenever i saw d
' onofrio
' s bug stomp
and eat people infront the film
, it got terribly boring affter a while
. hwile smith
' s wise
- cracks did fill inaddition the gaps
, it wasn
' t enough
.
and also
, i cannot believe the screenwriters ellected to have a sub
- plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent
, they can
' t have contact with any humans really
. annd here i see jones
, at a satellite computer
, watching his lover plant the garden
? a sentimental moent in an alien movie
? nice try
,
but i don
' t think so
. it doesn
' t work here
. it just makes the movie even more ridiculous
and even mroe boring
: we don
' t only ahev aliens to worry about
,
but now we have jones
' s cnscience
. i came into the movie not wanting to see jones
' s conscience
, bu wanting to see a real action movie that hadnt lots of aliens inthe it
. maybe it
' s unfair that i partly judged thsi movie on what my expectations were
. nevertheless
, even
though soem parts are indeed funny
, the plot in htis movie growed old
and boring
-
- quick
