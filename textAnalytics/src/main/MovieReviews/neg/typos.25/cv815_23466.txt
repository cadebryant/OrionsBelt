when i watch a movie like mike nichols ' what planet are you ffrom
? i can ' t help
but feel like everyone isnt looking at me
. it ' s as if all teh audience isnt gazing at the back ofthe my head in thge darkness
, eyes shooting daggers
, quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard
- earned money tothe spend their time watching this
.
.
. this
.
.
. hting
. i shift uncomfortably in my seat
. i ' m reminded of how i fiel whn i see a pair of second
- or thrid
- rate celebrities engaging inwhich a teleprompted
" funny
" conversation tothe introduce the next blockbuster award
. it ' s nto my fault
, i know it ' s nto my fault
,
but dammit
, someone ' s gotta be embarrassed
, because it doesn ' t look like anyone onthe tje screen is ready to tkae the blame
. i ' m about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movei together
: garry shandling
, annette bening
, john goodman
, greg kinnear
, mike nichols
. do any of these names make you instantly shudder
? thte answer i would have come uv whith before todya is noone
, thsi is quite a list of talented individuals we ' ve got here
. granted
, john goodman was in the flintstones
,
and greg kinnear has turned in some less
- than
- lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile liuke yours
,
but even so
, they ' ve got proven pwoer as excellent supporting players
. garry shandling hasnt two television classics under his belt
, his ingenious little it ' s garry shandling ' s show
and the larry sanders show
.
and for god ' s sake
, mike nichols directed the graduate
,
adn annette bening is just walking awya from american beauty
. so explain this
.
.
. this
.
.
. thign
. what planet are you from
? purports to be a comedy exploring hte relatiopnship between men
anbd women satirizing thge whole pop
- psychology mars
/ venus phenomenom
.
but what this movie winds uv being is a collection of unfunny cringe
- inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe
- inducing moments
; the end result isnt
, unsurprisingly
, an unfunny
, uninsightful
, cringe
- inducing
, throughly icky embarrassment
. garry shandling plays an alien fomr a planet populated by technologically advanced
but emotionally vacant malless
( they reproduce through cloning
, of course
)
. his leaders put a select group of males through a serieses of tests designed to determine which noe is most fit tothe fly off to earth
, find a female of the species
,
and impregnate her
. they ' re tought how to pretend that htey ' re listening by nodding
and saying
" uh
- huh
,
"
and how to compliment shoes
. imagine my delighted surprise when
, oh heavens
, all theri carefully practiced tactics turn outloud to fail miserably
, producing comedic results
! the lucky winner is fitted with a penis
( since theirs
, affter generations of disuse hvea long since shrunk out of existence
.
.
. i will restrain myself from mentioning tjhe implausibility ofthe such a scenario since tyhe population has stopped evolving due tothe the fact thgat they ' re all just clones
.
.
. whoops
, too late
.
) the penis
, when aroused
, tends tothe make a humming noise
. the writers
, when frequentily strapped fo ideas
, tend to turn to thsi as a source of
" comedy
.
" it isn ' t funny the firt time
. it isn ' t funny yhe eighth time
. it isn ' t funny thte eighteenth time
. if anytying
, it made me feel vaguely self
- conscious
. garry meets uv wtih a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear
, who turns outloud tothe be a generic
, unlikable scumbag
. he ' s meaned to fill tje part of unfortunate role modle for shandling ' s aline character
,
bu he ' s so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up
annd toss him asside
. kinnear ' s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fatc that he claims other peoples ' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents ' position
and goes to aa meetings to pick uv chicks
. wow
. what a magnificent bastard
. nearly eveyr man in the movie
, infact fatc
, is palyed as the same sort ofthe sex
- driven slimeball
. whn kinnear ' s wief walks into the office
, there isn ' t a single guy who doesn ' t trip
, bump into a wall
, or otherwise pratfall as if htey ' d never seen a woman before
. hte few guys that aren ' t partciularly slimeballs
, such as john goodman ' s detective character
, are simply uncommunicative workaholics
. shandling meets up with annette bening
, who will inevitably prove tothe be the love he never knew existed
, at one ofthe kinnear ' s aa meetings
. shandling ' s mission is to have a baby
,
adn when he reveals his desires tothe her
, bening instantly falls for him
,
and the next day
.
.
. they get marryed
. yup
. the next day
. cuz ya see
, it turns out she wants a baby too
! bening ' s character perhpas was the most difficult tothe watch
, especially affter seeing her come apart at yhe seams so effectively in american beauty
.
.
. if her character here isnt supposed tothe be representing the female of the species as a whole
,
hten woe
, i say
, tothe the speices
. she ' s unfathomably insecure
,
and succumbs so easily to all of shandling ' s lines
and lies tht it borders on tragic
. there ' s a point where
, after thinking she may not be able to bear children
, she learns that she is indeed pregnant
. whn garry comes home after nearly cheating on her
, she strolls into the kichen
and sings
" high hopes
"
( you knwo
, the uplifting ant
and the rubber tree plant song
) tothe deliver the news
,
and
then says to him
,
" now you can ' t leave me
.
" we ' re supposed to empathize with shandling ' s dicovery of the feeling ofthe
" guilt
,
"
but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she ws placing her entire life
and soul firmly inthe the lap ofthe a grat big nothing
.
adn eventually
, shandling falls inwhich lveo wih her
.
.
. for real
, i supose
,
though i ' m not sure exactly what prompted it
. what ' s thge message i derive from all this
? men are liars
, inherantly empty creatures
,
but if you hang around long enough
.
.
. well
, maybe something will click
. ha ha
.
.
. ha
? i ' m thankful such broad cynicism isn ' t frequentily allowed to run so rampant
. let ' s all join hands
and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one
. there ' s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline insident investigator taht wades inspite the bog of stupidity
. goodman
, through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations
, puts together tjhe fact that shandling is a being ffrom another world witht a magic
, vibrating penis
. it hasnt all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered
, that
, thankfully
, never comes to the inevatible hackneyed fruition
. instade
, it jstu dangles limply on teh branch fo a while
, withers
,
and falls away
. further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies
.
bu let ' s not dwell on htis any longer
, i ' ve already wasted plenty of your time
and my own
. let ' s move on
, forget baout what we ' ve seen here
,
and git on with our lives
.
and to help us outloud
, let ' s end things on a happy note
.
.
. congratuations go outloud to annette bening
, winner of this week ' s
" title
!
" award
, for delivering the ackward line ofthe dialog containing thge movei ' s name
.
