when i watch a movei like mike nichols
' what planet are you from
? i can
' t halp
but feel like everyone is looking at me
. it
' s as if all the audience isnt gazing at the back ofthe my head in the darkness
, eyes shooting daggers
, quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard
- earned monay to spend their time watching thsi
.
.
. this
.
.
. thing
. i shift uncomfortably inwhich my seat
. i
' m reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second
- or thrid
- rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted
" funny
" conversation to inctroduce the next blockbuster award
. it
' s nto my fault
, i konw it
' s not my fault
, bu dammit
, someone
' s gotta be embarrassed
, beacuse it doesn
' t look like anyone onthe yhe screen is ready to tkae the blame
. i
' m about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together
: garry sh
andling
, annette bening
, john goodman
, greg kinnear
, mike nichols
. do any of these names amking you instantly shudder
? the answer i owudl have come up with before today is no
, this is quite a list ofthe talented individuals we
' ve got here
. granted
, john goodman was infact the flintstones
, annd greg kinnear has turned in smoe less
- than
- lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours
,
but even so
, they
' ve got proven power as excellent supporting players
. garry sh
andling has two television classics under his belt
, his ingenius little it
' s garry sh
andling
' s show
and tghe larry s
anders show
.
and for god
' s sake
, mike nichols directed the graduat
,
and annette bening isnt jstu walking away from american beauty
. so explain this
.
.
. htis
.
.
. thing
. what planet are you ffrom
? purports to be a comedy exploring the relatiopnship between men
and women satirizing the whole pop
- psychology mars
/ venus phenomenon
.
but what thsi movie winds up being is a collecton of unfunny cringe
- inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe
- inducing moments
; tyhe end result is
, unsurprisingly
, an unfunny
, uninsightful
, cringe
- inducing
, throughly icky embarrassment
. garry sh
andling plays an aline from a planet populated by technologically advanced
but emotionally vacant males
( they reproduce through cloning
, ofthe course
)
. his leaders put a select group of males thru a sories of tests designed tothe determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth
, find a female of yhe speices
,
and impregnate her
. they
' re taught how to pretend that they
' re listening by nodding
and saying
" uh
- huh
,
" annd how to compliment shoes
. imagine my delighted surprise when
, oh heavens
, all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably
, producing comedic results
! tje lucky winner is fitted with a penis
( since theirs
, after generations of disuse have long since shrunk outloud of existence
.
.
. i wiull restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario usance the population hasnt stopped evolving due to the fatc tyhat they
' re all just clones
.
.
. whoops
, too late
.
) the penis
, when aroused
, tends tothe make a humming noise
. the writers
, when frequentily strapped forthe ideas
, tend to turn to this as a source of
" comedy
.
" it isn
' t funny the first time
. it isn
' t funny tyhe eighth time
. it isn
' t funny the eighteenth tyme
. if anything
, it made me feel vaguely self
- conscius
. garry meets uv with a coworker at a bank plyed by greg kinnear
, who turns out to be a generic
, unlikable scumbag
. he
' s meant tothe fill the part of unfortunate role model for sh
andling
' s alien carachter
,
but he
' s so flatly drawn that even tghe writers quickly give uv
and toss him asside
. kinnear
' s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims otehr peoples
' work as his pwn to worm his way into a vice presidents
' posistion
and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks
. wow
. what a magnificent bastard
. nearly every man inaddition the movie
, in fact
, is played as the smae sort of sex
- driven slimeball
. whn kinnear
' s wief walks into the office
, there isn
' t a single guy who doesn
' t trip
, bump inot a wall
, or otherwise pratfall as if they
' d never seen a woman before
. the few guys that aren
' t particularly slimeballs
, such as john goodman
' s detective character
, are simply uncommunicative workaholics
. sh
andling meets up with annette bening
, who iwll inevitably prove to be hte love he never knew existed
, at one ofthe kinnear
' s aa meetings
. sh
andling
' s mission is to have a baby
,
and when he reveals his desires to her
, bening instantly falls for him
,
and tjhe next day
.
.
. they get marryed
. yup
. the enxt day
. cuz ya see
, it turns outloud she wants a baby too
! bening
' s character prehaps ws tjhe most difficult to watch
, especially after seeing her come appart at the seams so effectively in american beauty
.
.
. if her chracter here is supposed to be representing the female of thte species as a hwole
,
then woe
, i sday
, to thge species
. she
' s unfathomably insecure
,
and succumbs so easily to all of sh
andling
' s lines
and lies that it borders on tragic
. there
' s a point where
, aftter thinking she may nto be able to bear children
, she learns taht she is indeed pregnant
. wehn garry comes home affter nearly cheating on her
, she strolls into the kitchen
and sings
" high hopes
"
( ytou konw
, the uplifting ant
and the rubber tree plant song
) tothe deliver the news
, adn
then says to him
,
" now you can
' t leave me
.
" we
' re supposed to empathize with sh
andling
' s discovery ofthe teh feeling of
" guilt
,
"
but instead i wnated to weep fo bening that she was placing her entire life
and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing
.
and eventually
, sh
andling falls in love with her
.
.
. forthe rela
, i suppose
,
though i
' m nto sure exactly what prompted it
. whta
' s the message i derive from all this
? men are liars
, inherently empty creatures
,
but if you hang around long anough
.
.
. well
, maybe something will click
. ha ha
.
.
. ha
? i
' m thankful such broad cynicism isn
' t frequentily alloween to run so rampant
. let
' s all join h
ands
and pray that tghe planet theese folks are from isnt not this one
. htere
' s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity
. goodman
, through a series ofthe astoundingly implausible realizations
, puts together thge fact tyhat sh
andling is a being from another world with a magic
, vibrating penis
. it hasnt all the makings for a subplot of having sh
andling be discovered
, tyhat
, thankfully
, never comes tothe the inevitable hackneyed fruition
. instead
, it just dangles limply on the branch for a while
, withers
,
and falls awya
. further proof that goodman shoudl just stick to doing coen brothers movies
.
but let
' s not dwell on this any longer
, i
' ve already wasted plenty of your time
and my own
. let
' s move onthe
, forget about whta we
' ve seen here
, anbd get on with our lives
.
and to help us out
, let
' s end things on a hapyp note
.
.
. congratuations go out tothe annette bening
, winner of thsi week
' s
" title
!
" award
, forthe delivering the awkward line of dialouge containing the movei
' s nmae
