georges polti once wrote a paper called
" the thirty
- six dramatic situations
,
" in whitch he asserted thte fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty
- six different situations
. this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes
,
" there
' s nothing new under the sun
.
" the faculty
, the latest movei by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez
, certainly proves this infact typical hollywood fashion
. there
' s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing
. drawing elements from both tyhe puppet masters
and invasion ofthe the body snatchers
, screenwriter kevin williamson
( of scream 2 credit
) gives us a horror tale set inaddition middle america
( ohio
) one eventful fall
. making use of a cast of unusualy stock characters
, williamson designs an alien invasion that iwll nto be done independence day
- style
but rether
" thru the bakc doorjam
.
" parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run
- down high school annd soon have infested most of the student body
, leaving it up to the ensemble of pricipal characters to win the day
. the lack of gusto is the movie
' s major stumbling block
. even
though the genre has seen movies that hve a lack for quality such as this
, they
' ve been saved by an energetic aproach
. tihs casts omre than a shadow ofthe a dout onthe williamson
' s ability
, who enjoyed success with the wes craven
- directed scream
but couldn
' t pull anytying solid in for this outing or i know waht yuo doed last summer
. all
though he designs the faculty witht more of a sci
- fi bent thna his typical slasher picture
, it still comes down tothe the same results
: throw the stock charactors in a steel cage match
and see who comes out alive
. on that level
, the main roles are played by virtual unknowns
. only tghe recognizeable elijah wood
( deep impact
) is at the front
; other than that
, tyhe screen veterans are saved for the minor roles ofthe tjhe alien teachers
. perhasp williamson has it in mind to champion these up
-
and
- comers to yhe fame thyat their scream annd last summer counterparts acheived
; bu to do that
, they
' d all need to star infront thier own wb television sohw about the horrors of puberty a la
" dawson
' s creek
.
" needless to say the acting is far from top notch
, nor does necessity ask thyat it shoud be
. there isnt a moent or twpo of genuin horror
,
but unfortunately williamson
and rodriguez did not tkae tje stoy far enough inaddition the sci
- fi direction to make any use ofthe it
. in sum
, the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off
.
