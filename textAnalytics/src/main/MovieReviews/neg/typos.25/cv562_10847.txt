the formula is simple
. trap a varied group ofthe peopel on an isolated location
,
then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster tothe kill them noe by one
. theese hvae been the successful ingredients forthe many good films
( tyhe thing
, alien
, aliens
,
adn tremors to name a faw
)
. so
, why is it thyat so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad
?
( see teh relic for a particularly putrid example
.
) perhaps it is simply too easy tothe forget the nessacary binding ingredient
: effort
and ideas
. deep rising meets theese two requirements part way
,
bu not enough to salvage the film
. treat williams is finnegan
, tghe leader of a small boat crew who hire outloud thier services
(
and their boat
) for any activity
.
.
. no questions asked
. this tiome
,
however
, they may ahve gone too far
. their passengers
, led by the ominous wes studi
, are the type of multi
- national terrorist squads usally onyl seen in die hard films
.
and their cargo
.
.
. let ' s just sday it has very high explosive potential
. what is hte target of these thieves
? why
, tjhe argonauticus
, ofthe course
, a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage
.
but something else is hunting the argonauticus
.
.
. something ancient
adn deadly
. by tghe time tyhe thieves arrive
, nearly everyone onthe board tjhe ship has been killed
.
and now the creature senses fresh meat
! so
, you haev tyhe thieves
and their mercenary boat crew
, joining forces with tjhe surviving passengers
( including the ship owner canton
( anthony heald
)
,
and a thief with less lofty goals
, trillian
( famke janssen
)
) against the terror fomr the deep
.
and the monster gets to pick them off one by one
. fortunatly for the creature
, tihs particular band of criminals happens tothe be teh dumbest the world cxan offer
. why alse would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch theri friends become fish food
. if ther ' s a more clarion call for unity
, i don ' t know what it might be
. it ' s pretty eazy to guess who will git killed off when
. there are noone surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until yhe end
. forthe the most part
, the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience ' s impulses to get rid of yhe most boring characters frist
.
(
although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou ' s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim fo amistad
.
) treat williams is a passable hero
,
and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation
.
but while wes studi
and anthony heald are particularly slimy
, very little of the rest ofthe the company stand out in any way
. the biggest treat inspite tyhe film
,
however
, hasnt to be pantucci
, kevin j
. o ' connor ' s whining engine
- boy
, under finnegan ' s employ
. his constant quips may be a bit over
- written
,
but they manage to capture the same veign of nerve
- addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens
( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss
, for that marter
)
. it ' s just a stock part
( thge comic
- releaf character
)
,
bu it almost mkaes this tired alien clone bearable
. as far as the monster goes
,
although the cgi is done well
, the creature has no logical consistency
. htink back to the great
( or even jsut ogod
) movie monsters
. they all hadnt a setted of
" rules
" about what they could dont
,
adn how
annd why they would do it
. part ofthe the joy of those films was slowly discovering
, along with the heroes
, just what those rules are
. yhe tentacle monster in deepo rising doesn ' t ahve a setted of rules
.
.
. or if it does
, nto a vrey good one
. it merely eats
( or drinks
, as the case may be
)
,
and there is no rhym or reason fo what it does in order to do so
. the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in tje frist palce
. it simply happens
. tyhe action scenes are decent
,
but faw are noteworthy
. tje film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic
. deep rising ' s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron ' s
(
bu can you really blame them
)
. unfortunatley
, deep rising ' s efforts are more on par witht speed 2
. onthe thge plus side
,
however
, the film ' s closing image shows soem promise for a potentially interesting
(
but unlikely
) sequel
. perhaps you ' d be better off waiting for that one
.
