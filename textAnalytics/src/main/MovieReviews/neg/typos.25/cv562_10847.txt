the formula is simple
. trap a varied group of peopel on an isolated location
,
then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one
. these have been the successful ingredients forthe many good films
( the hting
, alien
, aliens
,
and tremors tothe nmae a few
)
. so
, why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad
?
( see tjhe relic for a particularly putrid exmaple
.
) perhaps it is simply too eazy tothe foreget the neccessary binding ingredient
: effort
and idesa
. deep rising meets these twpo requirements part way
,
but not enough tothe salvage tje film
. treat williams isnt finnegan
, yhe leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services
(
and their boat
) forthe any activity
.
.
. noone questions asked
. this time
,
however
, they may ahev gone too far
. their pasengers
, led by the ominous wes studi
, are the type of multi
- national terrorist squads usually only seen in dieu hard films
. anbd their cargo
.
.
. let
' s just sday it has very high explosive potential
. wqat is tjhe target ofthe these thieves
? why
, the argonauticus
, of course
, a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyge
.
but something alse is hunting the argonauticus
.
.
. something ancient
and deadly
. by tjhe time the theives arrive
, nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed
.
and now the creature senses fresh meat
! so
, yuo have the thieves
and their mercenary boat crew
, joining forces with the surviving passengers
( including the ship owner canton
( anthony heald
)
,
and a thieve whith less lofty goals
, trillian
( famke janssen
)
) against the terror from the deepo
. anbd the monster gets to pik them off one by one
. fortunately for tyhe creature
, htis particular b
and of criminals happens to be tjhe dumbest the world cin offer
. why else owudl they indulge infact petty squabbling hwile they watch their friends become fish food
. if ther
' s a more clarion call fo unity
, i don
' t know what it might be
. it
' s preety easy to guess who will get killed off when
. there are no surprises in thyat the most interesting characters seem tothe last until the end
. fo the most part
, the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audiance
' s impulses to git rid ofthe the most boring characters first
.
(
al
though i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou
' s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon aftter his acclaim for amistad
.
) treat williams is a passable hero
,
and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation
.
but while wes studi
and anthony heald are particularly slimy
, very little of the rest of the company st
and out in any way
. the biggest treat in tjhe film
,
however
, has tothe be pantucci
, kevin j
. o
' connor
' s whining engine
- boy
, under finnegan
' s employ
. his constant quips may be a bit over
- written
,
but they manage to capture thge same vein of nerve
- addled humor tath bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens
( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss
, for that matter
)
. it
' s just a stock part
( the comic
- relief character
)
, bu it almost makse this tired alien clone bearable
. as far as the monster goes
,
al
though the cgi is done well
, the creature has no logical consistency
. htink back tothe the gerat
( or even just good
) movie monsters
. they all had a setted ofthe
" rules
" about what tehy could dont
,
and how
and why tehy owudl dont it
. part ofthe the joy of those films was slowly discovering
, along with thte heroes
, just what those rules are
. tyhe tentacle monster in deep rising doesn
' t have a setted of rules
.
.
. or if it doens
, nto a very good one
. it merely eats
( or drinks
, as the case may be
)
, anbd ther is no rhyme or reason for what it doesnt inthe order tothe do so
. the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place
. it simply happens
. the action scenes are decent
,
but few are noteworthy
. tghe film definitely does suffer from its proximity tothe titanic
. deepo rising
' s peril iin the water scenes pale next to cameron
' s
(
but can you really blame them
)
. unfortunatley
, deep rising
' s efforts are more on par with speed 2
. onthe yhe plus side
,
however
, tyhe film
' s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting
(
but unlikey
) sequel
. perphas you
' d be better off waiting forthe that oen
.
