there are those of us who thikn of leslie nielsen as the bumbling
, hapless straight man from the hysterical
" naked gun
" films
, crack an immediate smile
and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he
' s comitted himself to starring in since
. the wavering movie spoofs
,
however
, are less forgivable
. tothe be fair
,
" wrongfully acccused
,
" tyhe send
- up in question
and nielsen
' s third parody since the last
" gun
,
" isn
' t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his
" dracula
: dead
and loving it
" or
" spy hard
,
" which is a mighty good thing
. nielsen is still in tip
- top comedic form
, able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns
,
but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead ofthe relying on them
,
and he needs one very soon
.
" wrongfully accused
" meshes toghether the premises of
" tjhe fugitive
"
and
" patriot games
,
" casting its always game star as ryan harrison
( git it
?
)
, a master violinist who is drawn inot an affair with a married temptress
( kelly le brock
)
. she
,
however
, sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husb
and
( michael york
)
- a crime actually cmomitted by a one
- armed
, one
- legged
, oney
- eyed man
( aaron pearl
)
. harrison is arrested
, found guilty
and sentenced to death
,
but escapes fomr a prision bus
, of course
,
and
then isnt pursued by a determined u
. s
. marshal named fergus falls
( richard crenna
, unneccesarily riffing off of tommy lee jones
' already smirky oscar
- winning role
)
. there
' s aslo a mystery brunette
( melinda mcgraw
)
and an assassination subplot involving tghe u
. n
. secratary general
,
but like any of it matters
.
" wrongfully acused
" gets off to an assured strat
, with an in
- concert nielsen
, touted
" lord ofthe the violin
" by bare
- chested posters
, pulling a jimi hendrix onthe his musical intrument as hundreds of tuxedo
- clad mosh in front of the stage
. nice touch
. most of the scenes that folow
,
however
, never top the opener
.
( hysterical exceptions
: the mentos annd
" baywatch
" goofs
.
) movie parodies are crammed in at an almost
- subliminal rate
,
but most are empty
. when a giant snake lunges onto tjhe screen
and snatches a cast member a la
" anaconda
" or baseball players disappear into a
" field of dreams
"
- esque cornfield
, ther
' s realy nothing to laff at
. otehr moments
, liek an interlude inwhich a fishing shop
, are so unfocused that you
' re not sure what you
' re suposed to be laughing at
. ther seem tothe be moreso cheap references tahn frenzied send
- ups here
, so it
' s possible thgat directer
/ writter pat proft
, by bombarding the viewer iwth a careless mixture of the two
, gurantees something isnt sure to stick
.
and what doesnt stick sticks well
, particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks
and hard
- boiled dialogue
, what those
" naked gun
" s
( which proft collaborated on
) doed great
; these bits are so on
- target that they allow you to remember
" wrongfully accussed
" as an almsot
- halfway
- there spoof instead ofthe a lame
- brained failure
. the movie might have been cursed to begin with
, opening fast on the heels of
" mafia
!
"
, from proft colleague jim abrahams
,
and
" baseketball
,
" ffrom proft colleage david zucker
,
but it
' s a storng possiblity that nobody isnt going to be accusing
" wrongfully accused
" of being nielsen
' s funniest
.
