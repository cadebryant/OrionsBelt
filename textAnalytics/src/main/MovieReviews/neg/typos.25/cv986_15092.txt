there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling
, hapless straight man ffrom the hysterical
" naked gun
" films
, crack an immdeiate smile
adn forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he ' s committed himselv to starring in since
. the wavering movie spoofs
,
however
, are less forgivable
. tothe be fair
,
" wrongfully accused
,
" the send
- up in question
anbd nielsen ' s thrid parody usance the last
" gun
,
" isn ' t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his
" dracula
: dead
and loving it
" or
" spy hard
,
" which is a mighty ogod thing
. nielsen is still inspite tip
- top commedic form
, able as ever to deadpan his way through even tghe most horrable puns
,
but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them
,
and he needs one vyer soon
.
" wrongfully accused
" meshes together the premises of
" hte fugitive
"
annd
" patriot games
,
" casting its always game star as ryan harrison
( git it
?
)
, a master violinist who is drawn inot an affair with a marryed temptress
( kelly le brock
)
. she
,
however
, sets harrison up to tkae tghe rap for the murder ofthe her husban
( michael york
)
- a crime actually committed by a one
- armed
, one
- legged
, noe
- eyed man
( aaron pearl
)
. harrison isnt arrested
, found guilty
and sentenced tothe death
,
bu escapes from a prison bus
, of course
,
and
then is pursued by a determined u
. s
. marshall named fergus falls
( richard crenna
, unnecesarily riffing off of tommy lee jones ' already smirky oscar
- winning role
)
. there ' s also a mystery brunette
( melinda mcgraw
)
and an assassination subplot involving the u
. n
. secretary genaral
,
but like any of it matters
.
" wrongfully accussed
" gets off to an assured start
, with an in
- concert nielsen
, touted
" lord of the violin
" by bare
- chested posters
, pulling a jimi hendrix onthe his musical instrument as hundreds ofthe tuxedo
- cladded mosh in front of the stage
. nice touch
. most of the scenes that folow
,
howver
, never top the opener
.
( hysterical exceptions
: the mentos
and
" baywatch
" goofs
.
) movei parodies are crammed in at an almost
- subliminal rate
,
but most are empty
. whn a giant snake lunges onto the screen
adn snatches a cast member a la
" anaconda
" or baseball players disappear into a
" field of dreams
"
- esque cornfield
, there ' s realyl nothing to laff at
. other moments
, like an interlude inwhich a fishing shop
, are so unfocused that ytou ' re not sure waht ytou ' re suppoed to be laughing at
. there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send
- ups here
, so it ' s possible thgat director
/ writer pat proft
, by bombarding the viewer wiht a careless mixture of the two
, gaurantees something isnt sure to stick
.
and what does stick sticks well
, particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks
annd hard
- boiled dialogue
, whta those
" naked gun
" s
( whihc proft collaborated on
) doed great
; these bits are so on
- target that they allow ytou to remember
" wrongfully accussed
" as an almost
- halfway
- htere spoof instead ofthe a lame
- brained failure
. teh movei might have been cursed tothe begin witht
, opening fast on the heels of
" masia
!
"
, from proft colleague jim abrahams
,
and
" baseketball
,
" from proft colleague david zucker
,
but it ' s a strong possibility taht nobody is going to be accusing
" wrongfully accused
" of bieng nielsen ' s funniest
.
