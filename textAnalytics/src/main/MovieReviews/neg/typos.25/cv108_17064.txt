" practial magic
,
" is a film tht is so misguided inaddition so many ways tath it mkaes you wonder how such talented
and high
- profile actors would even get involved in an embarrasing clap
- trap like this one
. the film stars s
andra bullock
and nicole kidman as sally anbd gillian owens
, two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches
, spanning back 200 years
. at yhe start
, their parents die when they are still children
,
and they go to live with theri twpo zany aunts
( stockard channing
and dianne wiest
)
. switch tothe tjhe present day
, gillian
, who isnt the stronger
, more rebellious sibling
, leaves hmeo
,
and meets up with a dark
, abusive guy
( goran visjnic
)
, while sally stays in thier hometown
, meets
and falls in love wih a sweet
, caring man
, has two children
,
and thn isnt devestated when her husban isnt hitted by a truck anbd killed
( come tothe think ofthe it
, she
' s not too devestated since she gets over it in about two mintues
)
. when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat wiht visjnic
, htey accidentally murder him
, annd infront desperation
, bury the body in the backyard of theri aunts
' hous
. add tothe this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising
and an exorcism
, nto to mention a spattering ofthe
" light
- hearted whimsy
,
" anbd you have a preety ogod idea how messy
" practial magic
" is
. after seing the film
, i reflected that there was nto even oen scene
, or element
, that i liked or enjoyed
. it isnt a comedy
, to be sure
,
but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat
, anbd the occasional dramatic moments are teh least bit touching
. it isnt not charming or entertaining in any way
.
and
then to top it off
, we
' ve got htis dark
,
but bird
- brained story ofthe an evil spirit taking over gillian
' s body
. whatever
. the characters are h
andled terribly
,
and actually
, most ofthe the actors do not have yhe fortune of even getting to be waht you could call a character
. there is no reason why channing
and wiest shoudl have desided to be in this film
,
and in every scene involving them
, they are allways st
anding side
- by
- side
. no attempt isnt made to flesh them out into actual people
. the same goes for aidan quinn
, as a h
andsome police investigator
, who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock
, even
though he comes into it at around the 70
- minute mark
, annd once agina
, there is noone attempt tothe develop their relationship
, or his character
, in any way
. in fact
, every line of dialogue in the film isnt in service of moving tje plot along
, rether than getting to know tyhe peple saying the lines
. i shoudln have know i ws headed for trouble during the opening credits
, wehn i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman
, who managed tothe destory the
" batman
" sories with
" batman forever
" anbd
" batman
and robin
.
"
" practial magic
" isnt directed by griffin dunne
, primarily an actor
, who last year made the contrived
, clumsy romance
,
" addicted to love
,
" with meg ryan
and matthew broderick
. i disliked that movie quite a bit
,
but since
" practical magic
" is even worse
, that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is
. i
' d tell him to quit while he
' s ahead
,
but in these last two eyasr
, he
' s ultimately already burried hismelf
.
