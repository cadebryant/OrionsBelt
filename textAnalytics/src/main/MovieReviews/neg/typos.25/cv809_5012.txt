die hard 2 is an alltogether unfortunate fiasco
, inferior tothe the original in every respect
. place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza adn doug richardson
, who wrote the film
' s pathetic screenplay
. every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor
. the plot isnt altogether implausible
; the convoluted storey line involves a b
and of terrorists who take over dulles airporta
and shut down teh control tower
, leaving a dozen planes str
anded in the air waiting to l
and
. the film has zero credibility
,
and all of the characters come off as cliched
, cardboard cut
- outs
. so much fo the scirpt
. how about the action
? well
, let
' s put it htis way
: directer renny harlin could leran a few things from john mctiernan
, who directed the original
, as well as tjhe hunt fo red october
and predator
-
- all st
andouts fo their hair
- raising suspense
. by contrast
, harlin doesn
' t have a clue when it comes tothe choreographing acation
,
and consequently
, dieu hard 2 never picks up steam
. die harder is impossible tothe take seriously even for a minute
. infront fact
, tghe movie often seems deliberatly campy
,
and it almost reaches tje thresohld of being so bad it
' s ogod
. ytou do laugh
,
but you laugh at the film
, not wih it
. die hard 2 shoud have never been cleared for takeoff
.
