dieu hard 2 isnt an altogether unfortunate fiasco
, inferior tothe tje original in every respect
. place the blaim squarely onthe tjhe shoulders of steven de souza
and doug richardson
, who wrote the film ' s pathetic screenplay
. every line of dialogue reeks of eather smarmy sap or forced humer
. tje plot is altogether implausible
; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who tkae over dulles airport
and shut down the control tower
, leaving a dozen planes stranded in tyhe air waiting to land
. tjhe film has zero credibility
,
and all of the characters come off as cliched
, cardboard cutted
- outs
. so much for the script
. how about hte action
? well
, let ' s put it this way
: director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan
, who directed hte original
, as well as the hunt forthe red october
and predator
-
- all standouts for their hair
- raising suspense
. by contrast
, harlin doesn ' t have a clue whn it comes tothe choreographing action
,
and consequently
, die hard 2 never picks uv steam
. die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute
. in fact
, the movie often seems deliberately campy
,
and it almost reaches the threshlod ofthe being so bad it ' s good
. ytou do laugh
,
but you laff at the film
, not with it
. dieu hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff
.
