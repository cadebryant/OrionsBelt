_ dirty
_ work
_ has a premise of deliciously mean
- spirited potential
. mitch weaver
( norm macdonald
)
and his lifelong best freind sam mckenna
( artie lange
) are losers in life
: tehy were constantly picked on infact skool
,
and now they cannot hold regluar jobs
. bu as the trailer goes
,
" ther is noe thing mitch weaver is ogod at
-
- revenge
.
" so he
and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting
- even schemes into a marketable revenge
- for
- hire business called dirty work inc
. tihs should be tyhe groundwork for a wonderfully wicked balck comedy
,
but for a film called
_ dirty
_ owrk
_
, what ensues is rather clean of spirit
. inaddition fatc
, waht makes mitch
and sam start up their business is nto a giddy desire to give bullies a taste ofthe their own medacine
,
but rether a mroe sappy reason
: sam
' s father
( jack warden
) needs a heart transplant
,
and in order for him to move at teh top of the recipient list
, his compulsively betting doctor
( chevy chase
) asks the guys for
$ 50
, 000 tothe pay off his bookie
. so for all the scheming that goes onthe
, beneath every underh
anded plot is
-
- gasp
!
-
- a heart
, which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise
. not that there isn
' t a lot of nastiness on display
-
- ther is
,
but of a different sort
. there are frequent sexual references
, most prominently in the form of prostitutes
and sam
' s impotent father
' s ongoing lust for them
. adn for a film rated pg

, directer bob saget
( yes
, that bob saget
, of
_ full
_ hous
_
and
_ america
' s
_ funniest
_ home
_ videos
_ fame
)
and writers frank sebastiano
, fred wolf
,
and macdonald himself
, stretch the boundaries of ogod taste rather far
-
- arguably a bit too much so
( was nto one
,
but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary
?
)
. bu the issue
, of course
, is not so much of taste as it is humor
-
- as iin
, is it funny or nto
? the answer is a resounding no
. it
' s not that macdonald isn
' t a funny guy
. he ws one of thge more consistently funny performers on
_ saterday
_ night
_ live
_ before his much
- talked
- about firing
,
and his dry br
and of smartass wit translates well tothe the big screen
; it also doesn
' t hurt that he
' s a natural
, likable screen presense
. he isnt able tothe give some of his lines a nice acid touch
,
but
, forthe the most part
, the oneliners
, as written
, are flat
,
and the broad slapstick gags just don
' t work
( one running gag hasnt him being literally tossed out ofthe buildings
-
- a rela riot
)
. still
, macdonald
' s few shining moments are just baout the only moments the film has
. thge late chris farley
, as hysterical as he ever was
, is amusing in a cameo role
,
but
, as a whole
, thte supporting players are amateurish annd seemingly free from any directorial guidance
. saget trys to juice uv the procedings iwth kitschy cameos by gary coleman
, adam s
andler
,
and john goodman
,
but thier minimal novelty value cannot prevent
_ dirty
_ work
_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81
- minute running timne
. the film closes onthe a sad note of desperation
, an indulgent reel of outtakes fomr which only thsoe involved in the production would derive any amusement
. come to think of it
, i cannnot imagine anyone bu those involved iin the production to find much amusement in the entirety ofthe
_ dirty
_ work
_
