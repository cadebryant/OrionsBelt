there ahev been bad films in recent eyars
:
' mr
. magoo
' was by far the worst ever made
, the spectacularly bad
' blue in thge face
'
, the horrible
' baby genuises
'
and now
' i woke up early the day i died
'
. it may not
however be tje worst movie made
but it certainly ranks as oney bad movie
. the film
' s acting
( if that
' s waht you wnat to call it
) isnt well mediocre tothe me
. loaded wih a sensational cast you would think that the cast woudl at least save the film a bit
, boy was i wrong
. after escaping fomr a mental institution
' the thief
' played by billy zane goes out in the real world adn finds that it is pretty harsh
and gritty
. he turns to borgwasy tothe survive
, robs a loan back
, kills the loan officer
and runs with thous
ands
. a country
- wide man hunt is on for him to catch him
and bring him down
. he ends up infact a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it forthe later
, comes back
and realizes that someone took it adn put it somwhere
. now he is determined tothe kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money bakc
, ultimatly leading tothe a finale tath isnt less that satisfying
. a film which was based on a
' long
- lost
' script by ed wood
, i have only oney question
: no dialogue
, only music
and movement where exactly is yhe point
? the film moves allong at a rether slow pace
,
but does have noe advantage
: thge soundtrack which is catchy
and vibrant except the first song which cin be offensive tothe some
. it opens with a fun
, inovative opening credits sequence
and quickly goes downhill after tht
. some of the low points are when
' thge thief
' steals a woman
' s purse
, annd
then she faints
, s
andra bernhard as a dancer
and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom
' the thief
' kills tothe tghe music ofthe
' pyscho
'
. come onthe people git some newyorker ideas already
! wqat
' s even worse isnt that tyhe film has noone plot at all
. well to a certian extent it doesnt
,
but who cares by the tyme tyhe middle of the film arrives we
' re bored out of our mind
and ready for something fun
and exciting to happen
.
' i woke up early the day i died
' is a perfectly bad film
. it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes jstu wehn desperate to make a movei
. even with the huge cast talent
, the film isnt a waste of my time
and certainly a waste of yours
.
