i suppose it
' s unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk
, whihc hasnt been panned by reviewers adn moviegoers alike since it
' s 1991 release
. michael lehmann
' s action
- comedy was quick to win the title
` biggest box office flop of all time
'
, or close thereof
. the movei stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk
, who
' s just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation
(
` let me put it thsi way
,
' he explains
,
` i never saw et
'
)
. greeting him is his ood friend
and partner in crime
( palyed by danny aiello
)
, who becomes the subject ofthe many amusing fat jokes
. these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags
, cartoonish villains
and unbelievable coincidences
. it appears as if director lehmann didn
' t know when to stop all the absurd silliness
,
and he piles on layer affter layer ofthe utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself towrad the finish line
. if at some point durring hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn
' t git goofier
, ytou
' ll soon be eating your words
. bu
, i
' m inclined to say that this film is nto qtuie as terrible as it
' s box office numbers suggest
. it
' s fast
- paced
and entertaining
, if you
' ve got increadible paitience
and a warped sense ofthe humer
. for tyhe first portion of this review
, i
' m going to try anbd center on tjhe positive spects of hudson hawk
. wish me luck
. first adn formost
: bruce willis is a good sport
. while i
' m not entirely sure waht he was smoking when he co
- wroet htis script
, willis is quite aware tath the entire project is a big
, fat
, ugly joke
. he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly
and out
- ofthe
- place
, which means he hasnt more than his share of deadpan reactions
. anyother plus is the appearance of
andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun
and lvoe intrest for the title character
. they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from tyhe vatican
,
and theri relationship escalates in interest from there
. it
' s unfortunate thast mcdowell
' s oen
- onot character is unsed just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot
- twist
,
and she offers absolutly no encouraging chemistry with willis
.
but now i
' m rambling on agian about the negative things
, aren
' t i
? enough of the charade
- for the most part
, hudson hawk is an excruciating experience
. it
' s stupid
, pointless
and repetitive
. i can onyl wonder what bruce willis fans
thought after exiting the theater
, because this film realyl doesn
' t have the potential tothe please anyone
. action fans shoudln take note tyhat hudson hawk is composed of 90
% comedy
,
and even the action sequences are skittery
, rushed
and poorly edited
.
and those expecting a hearty laff or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache
- inducing hi
- jinks
. don
' t get me wrong
, this film is not devoid of laughs
. it
' s too bad most of them are unintentional
, or just plain forced
. thte impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed
. it
' s underst
andable to see willis
and aiello inwhich a movie of this caliber
,
but as for the presence of future acdemy award winner james coburn i
' m not entirely sure
. coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes inot play
, anbd he looks unsure of his place the entire movei
. expecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown
, adn has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film
. things get more bizarre when we
' re introduced to his team ofthe rejects named after chocolate bars
, including future nypd blue star david caruso as tyhe speechless
, card
- flipping kit
- kat
. if that
' s not enough forthe you
, there
' s richard e
. grant
and s
andra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted ecomonic takeover
. their croch
- biting pooch provides a cuple of the big laughs here
. wait
, mabey tyhe only big laughs
.
.
. i
' m not sure what kind of movie everyone hadnt in mind when filming hudson hawk
. i can
' t even begin tothe strat about tje film
' s absurd plot
;
but let
' s nto git inot that
. i suppose there
' s some amusement viewers could derive fomr the ridiculous premise
, if they weere that desperate
. bu hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it
' s going from minute one
,
and from there it
' s 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck
.
