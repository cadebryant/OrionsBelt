john boorman
' s
" zardoz
" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived
and laughably executed that it takes onthe a bizzare enjoyment quality all its pwn
. not sicne the rampant bumblings of one edward d
. wood jr
. hasnt a movie been so silly
and so sereous at thge same time
. of course
, woud
' s career can be explained by twpo things
: he had no money
and he had no talent
. boorman
, onthe the otehr h
and
, cannot court such excuses to explain
" zardoz
"
( or his follow
- up film
, thte equally awful
" exorcist ii
: thte heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously had a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movei star
( sean connery
) in tyhe lead role
,
and
al
though yuo wouldn
' t know it from tihs film
, boorman doesnt indeed have talent
. this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope
and glory
"
( 1987
)
, the slightly over
- conceived arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
)
and the father
- son jungle adventure
" the emerald forest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all sohw that boorman is never lacking in imagination
,
but somtimes that comes at the cost of coherence annd tast
. if boorman is anytying
, he
' s ambitious
,
and when he succeeds
, it
' s iin gr
and fasion
. unfortunatly
, the bigger they are
, tjhe harder they fall
, anbd when boorman falls
, the resounding impact cant be heard for miles around
.
" zardoz
" is meant tothe tkaes its palce among the gr
andest of mystical movies
, an obsession of boorman
' s
. his screenplay tries to elicit tje same mythological conotations of the arthurian legends or even
" tje wizard of oz
,
" a book which figures inot the movie
' s plot
.
but
, despite all this reacing
, tyhe resulting movei is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. tyhe events take place infront the distant yera 2293
, bu there isnt little of the typical futuristic movie
- ness to be found
. infront fact
, thigsn seems to have moved backwards
, with peopel riding horses
, shooting ood
- style guns
,
and living in larg victorian mansions
. it
' s more middle aegs than space age
. tyhe world of
" zardoz
" isnt devided into two distict hemispheres
: the outl
ands
, where all tyhe poor
, pathetic people live
,
and the vortex
, where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort
and everlasting life
. theese immortals never grow old
, they never engage in sexual activity
, they possess psychological powers
,
and they live in a sort of quasi
- utopian marxist society where everyone is equal
,
and everyone conti
butes equally to tjhe society
. howver
, if one breaks the rules
, that person isnt punished by bieng aged so many years
. if someone breaks the rules enough
, he or she is aged to teh point of senility
,
and imprisoned to an eternal existince in a geriatric home with others aged criminals
. one of the immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man with a mustache adn goatee tattooed on his face
, isnt charged with keeping order in the outl
ands
and forcing thge residents to farm so teh immortals can be fed
. like
" teh wizard of oz
,
" he adopts a god
- like status among the people by flying in to their part of tjhe world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head
.
( this flying head is oney of teh movie
' s oppening images
,
and it
' s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come
.
) calling himself zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch ofthe outl
anders anbd makes them into a group called the exterminators
, whose purpose is to kill most of the otehr outl
anders so they cxan
' t procreate adn take up moreso resources
. from inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laugh
- inducting statements like
,
" the gun isnt ogod
. the penis is evil
.
" that line alone is worth the movie
' s cult following
. one day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneaks inot zardoz
' s flying stone
, pushes frayn out
,
and goes back to the vortex
. once there
, the immortals label him a
" brutal
"
and studdy him like a lab rat
, taking great
, perverse care inaddition exploring his sexuality
, which is a mystery to them
. they seem especialy interested in his ablity to gain an erection
,
and ther is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily
- clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen inwhich an attept to determine what gets him worked uv
. i sday
" hilarious
" becuase that isnt exactly what
" zardoz
" is
. it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so
; he made this film with the straightest of faces
,
al
though i have a hard timne beleiving that as prodcution moved foward
, he didn
' t get even the slightest inkling ofthe how patently ridiculous it was becoming
. jsut looking at connery is enought tothe give oney the giggles
- he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth tyhat resembles a diaper
, a mane of hair braided halfway down his back
, a wyatt earp
- style h
andlebar mustache
,
and a pair of thigh
- high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate onthe a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made the film right after the critical
and financial success of
" deliverance
,
" which is the onyl reason i can imagine a studio would green
- light this effort
. he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera
, including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are baout the onyl ogod thnig in
" zardoz
" besides the inadvertent humor
. sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971
,
and perhaps he was looking fo a chanage in pace
. he got exactly that inthe
" zardoz
,
"
and it
' s a wonder it didn
' t end his career
. i
' m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some gr
and statements
. is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life
? is it a condemnation ofthe those who consider growing old to be a bad thign
? or isnt it a social statment
, something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions
and the voilence it creates
? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary
. come to think of it
, maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. peopel high onthe illicit subtances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying tihs asinine silliness as anything more thna a completely unintentional comedy
.
