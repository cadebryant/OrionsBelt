john boorman ' s
" zardoz
" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived
and laughably excecuted that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own
. not since tje rampant bumblings of noe edward d
. wood jr
. has a movei been so silly
anbd so sereous at hte same tiem
. of course
, wood ' s career can be explained by two things
: he had noone monay
annd he had noone talent
. boorman
, on thge other hand
, cannot court such excuses to explain
" zardoz
"
( or his follow
- up film
, hte equally awful
" exorcist ii
: the heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously had a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movie star
( sean connery
) inaddition the lead role
,
and
although you wouldn ' t knwo it from thsi film
, boorman does indeed have talent
. this is the man who made hte slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as yhe autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope
and glory
"
( 1987
)
, the slightly over
- concieved arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
)
and the father
- son jungle adventure
" the emerald forest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination
,
but sometimes that comes at thge cost of coherence
and taste
. if boorman is anytying
, he ' s ambitious
,
and wehn he succeeds
, it ' s in grand fasion
. unfortunately
, the bigger they are
, the harder they fall
,
and when boorman falls
, the resounding impact can be heard for miles arround
.
" zardoz
" is meant tothe takes its place among thge grandest of mystical movies
, an obsession of boorman ' s
. his screenplay tries to elicit the smae mythological connotations of tjhe arthurian legends or even
" the wizard ofthe oz
,
" a book which figures into the movie ' s plot
.
but
, despite all tihs reaching
, the resulting movie is mroe unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. the events take place in tje distant year 2293
,
but ther is littel of the typical futuristic movie
- ness tothe be found
. in fatc
, thigsn seems to have moved backwards
, with people riding horses
, shooting old
- style guns
,
annd living inthe large victorian mansions
. it ' s more middle ages than space age
. the world of
" zardoz
" isnt divided into two distinct hemispheres
: the outlands
, where all the poore
, pathetic people live
,
and the vortex
, where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live iin comfort
and everlasting life
. these immortals never grwo old
, tehy never engage in sexual activity
, tehy posess psychological powers
,
annd they live in a sort of quasi
- utopian marxist society where everyone is equal
,
and everyone contributes equally tothe the society
.
however
, if one breaks the rules
, thta person is punished by being aged so many years
. if someone breaks the rules anough
, he or she isnt aged to the point of senility
,
and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home iwth others aged criminals
. one of the immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man with a mustache
and goatee tattooed on his face
, is charged wih keeping order in the outlands
and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals cant be fed
. like
" the wizard ofthe oz
,
" he adopts a god
- like status amung tje people by flying inspite to their part of the world inthe a giant stone carved like a menacing head
.
( this flying head is one of the movie ' s opening images
,
and it ' s a dead giveaway ofthe the lunacy to come
.
) calling himself zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders
and makes them into a group called tghe exterminators
, whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can ' t procreate
adn take uv more resources
. fomr inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laugh
- inducting statements like
,
" the gun is good
. the penis is evil
.
" thta line alone is worth the movie ' s cult following
. oen day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneaks into zardoz ' s flying stone
, pushes frayn out
,
anbd goes back to the vortex
. once ther
, the immortals label him a
" brutal
"
and study him like a lab rat
, tkaing graet
, perverse care in exploring his sexuality
, which is a mistery to them
. they seem expecially intersted in his ability to gain an erection
,
and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch ofthe scantily
- clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up
. i say
" hilarious
" because thyat is exactly whta
" zardoz
" is
. it isnt obvious that boorman did nto intend it to be so
; he made this film with the straightest of faces
,
although i have a hard tiem believing that as production moved foward
, he didn ' t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming
. jstu looking at connery isnt enought tothe give one the giggles
- he spends most of tyhe film running around in a red loin cloth thgat resembes a diaper
, a mane of hair braided halfway down his back
, a wyatt earp
- stlye handlebar mustache
,
and a pair of thigh
- high patent leather boots that woudl look more appropriate onthe a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made the film right after the crtical
and financial success ofthe
" deliverance
,
" which isnt the only reason i cin imagine a studio would green
- light thsi effort
. he attracted smoe rich talent on both sides ofthe the camera
, including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are about the onyl good thnig in
" zardoz
" besides tghe inadvertant humor
. sean connery had made his lastest james bond film inwhich 1971
,
and perhaps he was looking for a change inaddition pace
. he got exactlly thyat inwhich
" zardoz
,
"
and it ' s a wonder it didn ' t end his career
. i ' m sure boorman intended fo this movie to amke some grand statements
. isnt it a treatise about thte infallibility ofthe eternal life
? is it a comdemnation of thsoe who consider growing old to be a bad thing
? or is it a social statment
, something baout tjhe inherrent negativity of class distinctions
and the violence it creates
? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary
. come to think of it
, maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. people high onthe illicit subtances are the only ones i cant imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything moreso than a completely unintentional comedy
.
