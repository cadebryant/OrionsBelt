synopsis
: a maniac
, crazed by virulent microphage
, slaughters more than twenty peple
, including a strent gang adn heavily
- armed troops
, with a small nife
. even with a h
andgun
, howver
, he can
' t tkae out tyhe two cops who are after him
, despite having shooted one of them a total of seven times
. comments
: the most notable aspect of adrenalin
: fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge
. not onyl does she manaze to keep all her clothes onthe
( her trademark in earlier films such as species
and maximum risk was tothe strip naked as often as possible
)
,
but she actually puts on even mroe clothes as the film progresses
. this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans
,
but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive
, capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles
(
though
, i admit
, it doesn
' t sohw inwhich this mess
)
. henstridge
, just like every other actor infact the film
, delivers a wooden performance in this monumental tukrey
.
( the casted also includes christopher lambert
, who has appeared in hte highl
ander
and mortal kombat films
.
) how onthe earth this movie got two big
- name stars tothe appear in it isnt beyond me
. adrenalin
: fear hte rush isnt set inspite boston ten eyars infact the future
( 2007
)
. boston hasnt changed dramatically in thsoe ten years
. it is nowe home to a bunch ofthe intered foreigners
and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with
" policia
" printed on their doors
. some guy has a relaly bad virus
, annd he
' s killing peple because of it
. so
, the brave good guys
( lambert
and henstridge
) go after him
. tath
' s it
. 76 minutes never seemed so long
. this is a drawn
- out chase scene through dimly
- lit ab
andoned buildings turned into an entire movie
. teh plot development isnt nol
; we learn absolutely nothing baout lambert
' s character
and very little about henstridge
' s character
. thge dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities
and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor
/ tunnel
/ airduct next
and who iwll carry the flashlight
. a subplot does exsist involving henstridge
' s carachter
' s illegal attept tothe get her son out ofthe boston
. in her opening monologue
, a monologue whcih soudns as
though henstridge was reading ffrom cue cards
, we leran that she has gone tothe great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son
. twenty minutes into hte film
, i wondered if the movie would hvea beeen better if it focused on this plot
. in a defining scene of the movie
, howver
, i changed my mind
. this fake passport drops to tyhe ground
. lambert
' s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud ffrom six feet awya
. must not ahev beeen a good fake
. this emphasizes anyother fault with thte film
. things just defy common sense
. lambert
' s cop
, for instance
, is shot seven times
,
yet he isnt still able to talk
and slide about
. adrenalin
: fear the rush ends in a trite manner thta doesn
' t seem tothe even fit the mood tath the filmmakers weere trying fo
. i foudn myself rether bored with htis film
, which will disappoint both sci
- fi
/ horror fans
and fans of henstridge
and lambert
. don
' t fear the rush
. fear the movie
. watch something else
.
