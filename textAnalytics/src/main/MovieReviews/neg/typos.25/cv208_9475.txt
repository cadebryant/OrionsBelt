oney would think that david duchovny
, star of the cult favorite
" x
- files
" would be very careful inspite choosing his leading man cinema roles
. at least one would hope so
. noe would be seriously incorrect
. eugene sands
( duchovny
) isnt a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake
and wokr more
. it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient
and his license while under the influence
. ten months later
, in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin
, tjhe doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer
. useing a plastic water bottle
adn bar tubing
, sands operates
and saves his life
. smalltime hoodlum raymond blosum
( timothy hutton
) isnt impressed with tyhe cutlery skills on his associate
. he kidnaps
adn
then offers down
-
anbd
- out eugene a position in his organistion
. blossom needs a doctor tothe patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital
. sand ' s temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albiet illegally
, big chunks ofthe cash to fuel his habit
and close proximity tothe the gangster ' s womanfriend claire
( angelina jolie
)
, this film ' s babe factor
. the woudl
- be big time operator isnt desperately in ened ofthe help
. on the run fomr russian mobsters
( the bad guys that seem to be all yhe rage in htis year ' s films
)
and trying tothe cutted a pirate software deel with the chineese mafia
, blossom is surrounded by blood
. after a few medical misadventures
, the physision grows disenchanted with his employment
. an encounter iwth a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten tothe blow him awya unless he
" fixes
" theri dead buddy cements his feeling that he is inspite hte wrong line of work
. whn the fbi visits
and forces him to become an informant
, htere isnt no question thta he needs tothe be somwhere else
. oddly anough
, theese seem like htey coudl be exciting scenes
. the film disproves that assumption
.
then a bunch of other uninteresting things ahppen
. writing this only two dyas after seeing tjhe film
, its a struggle tothe remember tyhe events
. you cin take tyhat as a solid lack ofthe recommendation
. fo all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in

"
, it ' s a surprise that his big screen presense is so lacking in charisma
. the doctor is particularly bland
and dull
. even the cold turkey bit which is rife wtih dramatic possibilities come across as banal
. a little chocolot
annd minor sweats git him through heroin withdrawl
. like virtually everthing else in the film
, it ' s a missed opportunity
. the fox mulder detachment doesn ' t wrok here
. oscar
- winner hutton ' s manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle onthe
. played partially for comedy
and partially as crazed killer
, blossom almost becomes real
,
bu
then sinks inot goofiness
. most of the time hutton looks as if he ' s searching forthe his chracter
and comming up empty
. jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three
- dimensional human being before giving up
annd turning into scenery
. the most interesting aspect of her performence is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen
. the rest aren ' t any better
. michael massee ' s eccentric fbi agent never revs up
. oen of blossom ' s henchmen steals a faw moments of yhe show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer ' s doc holliday in
" tombstone
"
. his two
- gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is tjhe high point of the film
.
but that 15 seconds isn ' t worth sitting through the other 90 minutes
. frist tiem film director andy wilson
( known for his work on the british television series
" cracker
"
) appears to be attempting to jump onthe teh
" pulp fiction
" bandwagon
. the best of theese movies combine a sence of style
and flash with significant substace
. the second
- rate ones concentrate on jstu oen of theese aspects
.
" playing god
" does neither well
. the basic idea ofthe tjhe film is solid
.
and
then it goes nowhere
. even worse
, it plods back
adn forth
, up
annd down a long
and winding road before it ends up nowhere
. fox fails
yet again in his search for intelligent life
