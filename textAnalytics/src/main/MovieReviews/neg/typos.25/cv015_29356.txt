' s latest horror opus wtih a sciece fiction bent
( or science fiction outing witht a schlock horror bent
) is the aptly
- titled
" john carpenter
' s ghosts of mars
"
( in case
, i suppose
, you whent looking for someone else
' s
" ghosts of mars
"
)
. like all those films prefixed by the very possessive
" john carpenter
' s
,
"
" ghosts of mars
" is an unashamed b
- movei punctuated by a b
- movei plot
, b
- movie actors
,
and b
- movie spacial effects
. in category oney
, above
, we have a storyline that borders on idiotic
(
and
, at times
, chaotic
)
. dormant martians
( i
. e
.
, swirling red gases
) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes
. all this explained
( in flashback
) to some gr
and pooh
- bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard
( natasha henstridge
, from the sub
-
" speices
" films
)
, the onyl returnee on a silly
- looking train
. officer ballard went infact to bring bcak incarcerated felon james
" desolation
" williams
; what she foudn ws not a pretty picture
. in tghe second category we have ms
. henstridge
, her blonde hair pulled bcak tightly anbd awkwardly inot a ponytail
, ice cube
( as the appropriately
- named
" desolation
"
)
, pam grier
( breifly
, oddly
-
- who wanted to work with whom i wonder
?
)
,
and a host of extras all assuming that the story adn special effects weere gogin to carry this film
and therefore they didn
' t need to try too hard
. in category number three we have
, in addition to those swirling red gases anbd the silly
- looking turain
, a couple of bird
' s
- eye
- veiw shots of a sprawling martian metropolis
( reddish also
)
. state
- of
- the
- art special effects have never beeen a carpenter trademark adn once again the writer
/ director
( who seems to hvea no probelm finding work
,
however
) doesn
' t waste any of tghe film
' s budget in tath deparment
.
" ghosts ofthe mars
" is lock
, laughing stock
,
and barrel all your st
andard carpenter fare
: dingy interiors
, cluttered exteriors
, inane dialogue
, lots of leather
, scarred
, crazed
- looking aliens
, anbd lots
and lots of weaponry
. the film often
and allways explodes into warfare without warning
-
- spontaneously
, stupidly
. carpenter might like tothe think he
' s made a western here
but it
' s a western wihtout any real heroes
, villains
, or border conflicts
. it
' s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken
. i never
thought i
' d miss the guy bu i do
. it
' s not
* all
* the smae
, howver
. dubbed the
" one
- note wonder
" for his minimalist music soundtracks
, carpenter seems tothe have graduated from simplistic
( yot effective
) scoring by highlighting his action with loud
, screeching gitar work
. fortunately tihs drowns out a lot of tjhe dialogue
. yhe final exchange between henstridge
and
, er
, cube
though isnt both audible
*
and
* priceless
. mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood iin the lastest eyar or so
, whta with the stillborn
" mission tothe mars
" anbd
" red planet
"
( iwth val kilmer
)
.
" ghosts of mars
" sadly adds to those disappointing returns
( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch ofthe sequels
, among them
" american pie 2
"
and
" rush hour 2
"
)
. the irony is that thte mars infact carpenter
' s film feels sadly absent
. there are occassional references to yhe red planet
, of course
,
but thte film might as well have been set inthe perth amboys than on earth
' s closest nieghbor
. twpo thnigs keep
" john carpenter
' s ghosts of mars
" from getting a huge slap upside tjhe head
. 1
. henstridge keeps her top onthe
( miraculously
)
, adn 2
. thte film doesn
' t pretend to be anytying it
' s nto
. whta that means
,
however
, is that fans of superior
, inteligent
, grade a sci
- fi
/ horror are singularly outloud of luck
.
