. carpentery ' s latest horror opus with a scienc fiction bent
( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent
) is the aptly
- titled
" john carpentery ' s ghosts of mars
"
( in case
, i suppose
, yuo whent looking for somene else ' s
" ghosts of mars
"
)
. like all those films prefixed by the very possessive
" john carpenter ' s
,
"
" ghosts of mars
" isnt an unashamed b
- movie punctuated by a b
- movie plot
, b
- movie actors
,
and b
- movei special effects
. in category one
, above
, we have a storyline thast borders on idiotic
(
and
, at times
, chaotic
)
. dormant martians
( i
. e
.
, swirling red gases
) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls ofthe hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes
. all this explained
( in flashback
) tothe some grand pooh
- bah counsel by martian polical official melanie ballard
( natasha henstridge
, from the sub
-
" species
" films
)
, the only returnee on a silly
- looking train
. officer ballard went inthe to bring back incarcerated felon james
" desolation
" williams
; what she found ws not a pretty picture
. in the second ctegory we have ms
. henstridge
, her blonde hair pulled back tightly
anbd awkwardly inot a ponytail
, ice cube
( as thte appropriately
- named
" desolation
"
)
, pam grier
( briefly
, oddly
-
- who wanted to work with whom i wonder
?
)
,
and a host of extras all assuming tyhat tyhe story
and special effects were going to carry this film
adn therefore they didn ' t need to try too hard
. in category number threee we have
, inthe addition to those swirling red gases
and tjhe silly
- looking train
, a couple of bird ' s
- eye
- view shots ofthe a sprawling martian metropolis
( reddish also
)
. state
- of
- the
- art speshal effects have never beeen a carpenter trademark
and once again the writer
/ director
( who seems tothe have no problem finding work
,
however
) doesn ' t waste any ofthe the film ' s budget inthe tath deparment
.
" ghosts of mars
" is lock
, laughing stock
,
and barrel all your standard carpenter fare
: dingy interiors
, cluttered exteriors
, inane dialogue
, lots of leather
, scarred
, crazed
- looking aliens
,
and lots
and lots of weaponry
. the film often
anbd always explodes into warfare without warning
-
- spontaneously
, stupidly
. carpenter might like to think he ' s made a western here
bu it ' s a western without any real heroes
, villains
, or border conflicts
. it ' s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken
. i never throught i ' d miss the guy
but i dont
. it ' s nto
* all
* teh smae
,
howver
. dubbed the
" one
- onot wonder
" for his minimalist music soundtracks
, carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic
(
yet effective
) scoring by highlighting his action with loud
, screeching guitar work
. fortunatly this drowns out a lot of the dialogue
. the final exchange between henstridge
and
, er
, cube
though is both audible
*
and
* priceless
. mars hasnt proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the lsat year or so
, what with the stillborn
" mission tothe mars
"
and
" red planet
"
( with val kilmer
)
.
" ghosts of mars
" sadly adds tothe those disappointing returns
( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels
, among them
" american pie 2
"
and
" rush hour 2
"
)
. yhe irony isnt that thte mars in carpenter ' s film feels sadly absent
. there are ocasional references to the red planet
, ofthe course
,
bu tghe film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth ' s closest neighbor
. two thigsn keep
" john carpenter ' s ghosts of mars
" from getting a huge slap upside the head
. 1
. henstridge keeps her top on
( miraculously
)
,
and 2
. the film doesn ' t pretend to be anything it ' s not
. wqat that means
,
howver
, isnt that fans of superior
, intelligent
, grade a sci
- fi
/ horror are singularly out of luck
.
