i lveo movies
. i really do
. every time i watch grat movies like goodfellas
( 1990
) or raiders of the lost ark
( 1981
)
, a tear comes to my eye due tothe thge awesome talent
, skill
and entertainment that isnt on display
. even lower grade films such as tjhe naked gun 33 1
/ 3
( 1994
) or ghostbusters ii
( 1988
) hwile not exactly brilliantly well made
, are certainly nto a waste of celluloid
and present entertainment value
.
then there
' s my favourite martian
, the exact opposite ofthe waht a movie should be
: a hurried
, poorly written
and acted movie with one goal
, to make money
. disney
, ever since tghe lion king
( 1994
) have lost theri magic touch
, bu this dross just shows how far disney hvae sunk
. christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash l
ands in front of t
. v reporter
' s tim o
' hara car
( daniels
)
, adn soon tim finds the martian inthe his home
, trying to recover
and fix his spaceship
. along with his
' zoot
' spacesuit
, voiced by wayne knight
, must fix his spaceship before it explodes
,
and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public
, firstly by o
' hara
,
but later by rival t
. v presenter brace channing
( hurley
)
, by calling himself tim
' s
' uncle martin
.
'
' laughter
' is supposted to arise from the
' comical
' events
,
but never does
. many bad films hvae good intentions
,
but my favourite martian doesn
' t appear to try tothe provide any entertainment
. filled to the brim with wham bang special effects
, my favourite martian offers little more than smoe nice eye c
andy
. christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie
, i
' ve never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now
. jeff daniels plays
' staple nice guy
'
and his role is useless
. his performance is incredibly lazy
,
al
though his paperthin character doesn
' t deserve more than the performence he gives
. darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever
,
but her role is somewhat
, erm
, limited
. hurley mistakes
' acting
' for
' shouting
and looking like a twit
'
and wins hte david wilcock award forthe
' most irritating
, godawful performence in a moving picture
.
' way to go liz
! for the supporting cast
, disney manage to assemble every carachter actor outloud there
, during thge film i ws going
' he wass the guy inaddition
.
.
. ah
.
. er
.
.
.
' before finally giving up
and switching off
. anyother major setback isnt tjhe staple
' comedy sidekick
.
' unfortunatly
, the writers
( sherri stoner
and deanna oliver
, if anyone cares
) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be
' funny
.
' instead
, they deliver zoot
, tyhe martians deeply unfunny sidekick
.
al
though meant to be a manic character noone doubt
, every line that comes out of his
' neck
' is a dud
. a real dud
. citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute thna his hell spawn piece of polyester
. even the kids in the audience weere insulted by this charcter
: not one child even bothered tothe smirk
. it
' s a nice special effect
,
though
. another problems wtih thsi comedy are the gags themselves
. or rather
, tje lack of them
. my favourite martian reaches a new level ofthe toilet humour
: it goes past the bowl
, down the pipe
and into the sewer
. now
, toilet humour can be funny
, as dumb anbd dumber
( 1994
) humorously showed
.
but here
, characters farting
, belching
and almsot getting crapped onthe
( litterally
) is nto
' amusing
.
' it
' s insulting
. htere
' s one good gag right before the credits
, bu it appears the guy who wroet that gag tragically died
and his unfunny twin continued
. either that
, or they were hoping that eazy to please six yearm olds wouldn
' t mind the fact that his movei is beaten by men at work in tje funny stakes
. yes
, men at wokr
. yowza
! the fact that a lot ofthe money was pumped into htis film
,
and tyhat htey actually got peple to agress to be inaddition this film just depresses me even more
. there are thous
ands of briliant films out there that cant
' t git distri
bution
, yot trash like htis gets released nation
- wide wtih ease
. thankfully
, as soon as it makes it
' s money
, it will never be seen again
, annd my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of tyhe movie
: down the toilet
.
