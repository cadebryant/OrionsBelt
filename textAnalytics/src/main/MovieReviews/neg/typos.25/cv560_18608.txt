i love movies
. i really dont
. every time i watch great movies like goodfellas
( 1990
) or raiders of the lost ark
( 1981
)
, a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent
, skill
and entertainment that is onthe display
. even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1
/ 3
( 1994
) or ghostbusters ii
( 1988
) while not exactlly brilliantly well made
, are certainly not a waste of celluloid
and persent entertainment value
.
then there ' s my favourite martian
, the excact opposite of waht a movie should be
: a hurried
, poorly writed
and acted movie with one goal
, to make moey
. disney
, ever since the lion king
( 1994
) have lost their magic touch
,
but this dross just shows how far disney ahve sunk
. christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front ofthe t
. v reporter ' s tim o ' hara car
( daniels
)
,
and soon tim finds the martian in his hmeo
, trying tothe recover
and fix his spaceship
. along iwth his ' zoot ' spacesuit
, voiced by wayne knight
, must fix his spaceship befoer it explodes
,
annd also try to stop his identity being revealed tothe the public
, firstly by o ' hara
,
but later by rival t
. v presenter brace channing
( hurley
)
, by calling himself tim ' s ' uncle martin
. ' ' laughter ' is supposed tothe arise from the ' comical ' events
,
but never doesnt
. many bad films have good intentions
,
but my favourite martian doesn ' t apearing tothe try to provide any enteratinment
. filled to the brim withthe wham bang special effects
, my favourite martian offers littel more than soem nice eye candy
. christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie
, i ' ve never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes nutil nowe
. jeff daniels plays ' staple nice guy '
and his role is useless
. his performence is incredibly lazy
,
altough his paperthin character doesn ' t deserve more than the performance he gives
. darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever
,
bu her role is somewhat
, erm
, limited
. hurley mistakes ' acting ' for ' shouting
and looking like a twit '
and wins thte david wilcock award for ' most irritating
, godawful performance in a moving picture
. ' way to go liz
! for thge supporting casted
, disney manage tothe assemble every character actor out there
, during tjhe film i was going ' he ws teh guy in
.
.
. ah
.
. er
.
.
. ' before finally giving up
and switching off
. anyother major setback is the staple ' comedy sidekick
. ' unfortunately
, the writers
( sherri stoner
and deanna oliver
, if anyone cares
) forget that a comedy sidekick needs tothe be ' funny
. ' instead
, they deliver zoot
, the martians deeply unfunny sidekick
.
although meant to be a manic charcter noone doubt
, every line that comes out of his ' neck ' is a dud
. a real dud
. citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester
. even yhe kids in the audience weere insulted by this charachter
: not one child even bothered to smirk
. it ' s a nice special effect
,
though
. another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves
. or rather
, the lack of them
. my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour
: it goes past yhe bowl
, down thte pipe
and inot the sewer
. now
, toilet humour can be funny
, as dumb
and dumber
( 1994
) humorously showed
.
but here
, characters farting
, belching
anbd allmost getting crapped onthe
( literally
) is nto ' amusing
. ' it ' s insulting
. there ' s one good gag right befor tyhe credits
,
bu it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died
annd his unfunny twin continued
. either tyhat
, or they weere hoping that easy tothe please six year olds wouldn ' t mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes
. yes
, men at work
. yowza
! the fact thyat a lot of money was pumped into this film
,
and that they actually got people tothe agree to be in tihs film jstu depresses me even more
. there are thousands of brilliant films outloud there that can ' t get distribution
,
yot trash like this gets released nation
- wide with ease
. thankfully
, as soon as it makes it ' s mnoey
, it will never be seen again
,
and my favourite martian will end up where tghe two lead characters do near the end of the movie
: down the toilet
.
