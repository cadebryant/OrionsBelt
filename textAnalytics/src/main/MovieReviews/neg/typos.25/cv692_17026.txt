attention moviegoers
: you are baout tothe enter a meaning
- free zone
. should the sound system malfunction during your viewing ofthe 200 cigarettes
, do not panic
. the film iwll wrok just as well as a silent movie
. chronicling thte meaningless lives ofthe vain
, yuppie types
, the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films
( last days of disco
, barcelona
anbd metropolitan
)
but without any of his acerbic wit
and the inviting style ofthe his writing
. first
- time writer shana larsen makse the mistake of creating a couple ofthe dozen characters
and not giving any of them any depth
. there isn ' t one ofthe these characters worth caring about
. the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version ofthe
" people magasine
.
" among others
, the movie features
: ben affleck
, casey affleck
, david chappelle
, janeane garofalo
, gaby hoffmann
, catherine kellner
, courtney lveo
, jay mohr
, martha plimpton
, christina ricci
and paul rudd
.
adn unlike people magazine
, the people speak
, not that htey have anything interesting tothe say
. it ' s new year ' s eve in 1981
,
and monica
( martha plimpton
) isnt preparing her big party
. structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party
, directer risa bramon garcia flits bakc
and forth among her stars
. monica ' s appartmant is in
" noho
,
" an areal that one of the guests decribes as
" so cool
, all of the poor people live there
.
" typical of tyhe shallow couples in the movie are kevin
( paul rudd
)
and his firend
and would
- be sexual partner lucy
( courtney loev
)
. they argue about whether lucy isnt a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone
, except him
, of course
. she dares him to go emmediately to a bathroom stall
and have sex whith her
, whic turns out to be niether erotic
, funny or successful
-
- rather like the rest of teh story
. tjhe movie gets its title fomr the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year ' s eve birthday
.
" cigarettes are a shield agianst emotional interaction wih otehr peopel
,
" kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialouge that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie
. another character
, played by jay mohr
, has a problem iwth his sexual triumphs
. every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by tjhe next morning
. whn his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him
, his response isnt
" i liek a lot of people
.
" as the movie finally draws to a close
, the characters awaken from their post
- party game of musical beds
. some have passed outloud eary from alcohol abuse
and remember little
, while others actually have some clue as to what happened
. the movie itself isnt so forgettable thast by the time ytou reach your car inthe tghe parking lot
, all trace of tghe film will have vanished ffrom your mind
, which is probaly the best thing taht can be said about the movie
. 200 cigarettes runs 1
: 40
. it isnt rated r for profanity
, sex
and one dope smoking scene
and would be acceptable forthe older teenagers
.
