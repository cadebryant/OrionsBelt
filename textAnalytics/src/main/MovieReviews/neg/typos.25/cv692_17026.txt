attension moviegoers
: yuo are about to enter a meaning
- free zone
. should tje sound system malfunction during your viewing ofthe 200 cigarettes
, dont not panic
. yhe film iwll owrk just as well as a silent movie
. chronicling the meaningless lives ofthe vain
, yuppie types
, the movei covers hte same ground as thge wilt stillman films
( last dyas ofthe disco
, barcelona
and metropolitan
)
but wihtout any of his acerbic wit
and the inviting stlye of his writing
. first
- time writter shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters
and nto giving any ofthe them any depth
. there isn
' t one ofthe these characters worth caring about
. the movei features such a cornucopia ofthe hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of
" people magazine
.
" amonst others
, the movie features
: ben affleck
, casey affleck
, david chappelle
, janeane garofalo
, gaby hoffmann
, catherine kellner
, courtney love
, jay mohr
, martha plimpton
, christina ricci anbd paul rudd
.
and unlike people magazine
, the people speak
, nto that they have anything interesting to say
. it
' s newyorker year
' s eve in 1981
,
and monica
( martha plimpton
) is preparing her big party
. stuctured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way tothe the party
, director risa bramon garcia flits back
and forth among her stars
. monica
' s apartment isnt in
" noho
,
" an area that oen of tjhe guests describes as
" so cool
, all of the poor people live there
.
" typical of the shallow couples in yhe movie are kevin
( paul rudd
)
and his friend adn would
- be sexual partner lucy
( courtney love
)
. htey argue about whether lucy is a slut or nto since she sleeps with everyone
, except him
, ofthe course
. she adres him to go immediately to a bathroom stall annd have sex with her
, which turns out to be niether erotic
, funny or successful
-
- rather liek the rest of the story
. thte movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin fo his new year
' s eve birthday
.
" cigarettes are a sheild against emotional interaction with other people
,
" kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialouge thgat sounds profound only outside the context of tyhe movei
. another charachter
, played by jay mohr
, hasnt a problem with his sexual triumphs
. every woman he beds falls deeply in loev iwth him by the next morning
. when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him
, his response isnt
" i like a lot ofthe people
.
" as hte movie finaly draws to a close
, the characters awaken from theri post
- party game of muscial beds
. smoe have pasted out early from alcohol abuse anbd remember littel
, while others actually have some clue as to waht hapened
. the movei itself is so forgettable that by the timne you reach your car in the parking lot
, all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind
, wich is probably the best thing that can be said baout the movie
. 200 cigarettes runs 1
: 40
. it is rated r for profanity
, sex
and one dope smoking scene
and owudl be acceptable for older teenagers
.
