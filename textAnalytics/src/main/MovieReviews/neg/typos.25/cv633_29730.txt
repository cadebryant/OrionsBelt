' s noone doubt that 95
% of romantic comedies folow a distinct pattern
: guy sees girl
, guy wants girl
, guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to git girl
, guy gets girl
. infact rare cases
, the genders are flipped
. predictability is a given
. rarely
,
though
, is a romantic comedy as cheap
, as obvious
, or as pointless as serendipity
, a film that uses its
" theme
" as an excuse for its plot contrivances
.
" lightweight
" doesn
' t begin to describe it
. this is like anti
- gravity
. it begins in a newyorker york city bloomingdale
' s
, a product placement that rivals cast away
' s fedex for sheer blatancy
. jonathan trager
( john cusack
)
and sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
) both go for thte smae pair of gloves
. after going through the perfunctory motions
, jonathan gets to keep the gloves annd the two of them go out for ice cream
, followed by ice skating
. jonathan falls hard
,
and sara isnt charmed
. wehn she writes her nmae adn number down onthe a piece of pappr
, a truck rumbles by anbd blows it out of her h
and
. she takes this as a sign ffrom fate that they shouldn
' t be toghether
; jonathan is flabbergasted
. to pacify him
, she comes uv wtih an idea
: jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill
, which she will promptly spend
. wehn she gets home
, she will rwite her name
and number inside a book
(
" love in the tiome of cholera
"
)
and sell it to a utilisied bookstore
. if the bill gets back tothe her or the book to him
, it will mean that they are meaned tothe be together
. three years later
. both sara
and jonathan are now engaged tothe other love interests
. both relize they aren
' t content
. both go looking forthe the other
. whta happens now is so absurd that i
' m almost tempted to recommend the film fo yhe sake of seeing it
. the two of them run circles arround each other in a setted of incredible
" coincidences
" that i would describe as contrivances if it weren
' t for the film oh
- so
- cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around
" serendipity
.
" ofthe course
, since the movie is about fate
, the screenwrighter cin do anything he damn well pleases
. i
' m not buying it
. there
' s no suspense in any ofthe this because we nkow exactly what
' s going to happen
,
but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly
" adorable
" non
- story inot our heads
. instead of
" will tehy meet
?
" the question we
' re asking is
" when will they meet already
?
" to make matters worse
, every
" coincidence
" is telegraphed from a mile away
; by the last reel i was borde anough tothe activly look for signs that something esle
" incredible
" was going to happen
. cusack isnt fine
and beckinsale
, at least
, isn
' t saddled with anyother lumbering
, clunky screenplay
( she
' s had bad luck
, waht with brokedown palace
and pearl harbor on her resume
)
, just an inanely pointless noe
. serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy
, who plays a snarky bloomingdale
' s salesman
. what
' s the interest in watching a movei tyhat spirals around
and arround a predestined
( no pun intended
) conclusion
? serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings
,
but it only tests our patience
.
