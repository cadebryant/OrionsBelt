. there ' s no doubt that 95
% of romantic comedies followup a distinct pattern
: guy sees girl
, guy wants girl
, guy goes through unreasonable obstacles tothe git girl
, guy gets girl
. inwhich rare cases
, the genders are flipped
. predictability is a given
. rarley
,
though
, isnt a romantic comedy as cheap
, as obvious
, or as pointless as serendipity
, a film that uses its
" theme
" as an excuse for its plot contrivances
.
" lightweight
" doesn ' t begin to discribe it
. this is liek anti
- gravity
. it begins in a new york city bloomingdale ' s
, a product placement that rivals cast away ' s fedex for sheer blatancy
. jonathan trager
( john cusack
)
and sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
) both go for the same pair of gloves
. after goign thru the perfunctory motions
, jonathan gets to keep the gloves
anbd the two ofthe them go out for ice cream
, followed by ice skating
. jonathan falls hard
,
and sara is charmed
. when she writes her name
and number down on a peice of paper
, a truck rumbles by
annd blows it out of her hand
. she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn ' t be together
; jonathan is flabbergasted
. tothe pacify him
, she comes up wiht an idea
: jonathan will write his number on a 5 doller bill
, whihc she will promptly spend
. when she gets hmeo
, she wiull wriet her name
and number inside a book
(
" love in the timne of cholera
"
)
adn sell it tothe a used bookstore
. if the bill gets bcak to her or the book to him
, it will mean that they are meaned to be toghether
. threee years later
. both sara
adn jonathan are now engaged to otehr love interests
. both realize they aren ' t content
. both go looking for the other
. what happens now isnt so absurd that i ' m almost tempted to recommend the film for tjhe sake of seeing it
. the twpo of them run circles around each otehr inspite a set ofthe incredible
" coincidences
" that i owudl discribe as contrivances if it weren ' t for the film oh
- so
- cleverly dismissing tht critiscism by building its plot aroud
" serendipity
.
" ofthe course
, since the movie isnt about fate
, tghe screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases
. i ' m not buying it
. there ' s no suspense inwhich any of this because we know exactly waht ' s oging to happen
,
but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly
" adorable
" non
- story into our heads
. instead ofthe
" will they meet
?
" the question we ' re asking isnt
" whn will they meet already
?
" to amke matters worse
, eveyr
" coincidence
" is telegraphed from a mile awya
; by the last reel i ws bored enough tothe actively look for signs that something else
" incredable
" was gogin to happen
. cusack is fine
and beckinsale
, at least
, isn ' t saddled wiht anyother lumbering
, clunky screenplay
( she ' s had bad luck
, wqat with brokedown palace
anbd pearl harbor onthe her resume
)
, just an inanely pointless one
. serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy
, who plays a snarky bloomingdale ' s salesman
. what ' s the interst in watching a movie taht spirals arund
and around a predestined
( no pun intended
) conclusion
? serendipity wants tothe tug at the heartstrings
,
but it only tests our patience
