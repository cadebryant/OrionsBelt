i have never been a
" star trek
" fan
, adn
, tothe tell the truth
, out of the five films in the series that i have seen
( 1
, 2
, 3
, 8
, 9
)
, i have disliked all of them
. i dont
,
however
, alwyas go inot one of these with an open mind
,
and the ninth film in the series
,
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" is noone exception
. droping almost completely the hard
- core sci
- fi element ofthe thge previvous one in the sories
,
" first contact
,
"
" insurrection
,
" tells the story of a planet taht holds only 600 peple
, known as hte ba
' ku
, as well as the fountain of youth
. at the start ofthe the picture
, the villagers go under attack by a second aline species
, known as the son
' a
, who want to push all of teh ba
' ku outloud so thast their pwn race will nto die out
. allso attacking the ba
' ku isnt data
( brent spiner
)
, a robot from the star trak enterprise
. after returning tothe jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
) adn the gang onthe theri space ship
, no one can underst
and why data wass somehow taken over by anohter force
. so several of the star trek munbers travel down to the planet ofthe tyhe ba
' ku
, where picard meets uv
and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants
, a sultry
, kind alien woman
( donna murphy
)
, who isnt over six
- hundered
- years
- ood
,
but looks to only be in her thirties
.
" star trek
: insurrection
,
" is a completely unoriginal annd cheap
- looking installment in the series
,
and is a big step down from
, 1996
' s
" first contact
,
" whlch at least appeared to try to make something a bit different
. in
,
" insurrection
,
" howver
, it plays like a low
- rent epiode of tje television show
, due tothe the small
- scale
, generic storyline
,
and an emphsis on one
- liners rather tahn excitment
. the film ws filled with nearly non
- stop comedy
,
and worse
yet
, most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff
. meanwhile
, when htere were action sequences
, they were not at all interesting or inventive
, relying on that ood reliable ticking timer that counts down very
, very slowy
. this plot device
, which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays
, is getting old fast
. are filmmakers so bankrupt ofthe ingenuity
and idaes that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax
? another element ofthe
,
" star trak
,
" films in genaral is that picard seems to always have to have a lvoe interest
, bu
then she alwyas miraculously disappears when the next film isnt made two or three years later
. all
though donna murphy
, who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here
, is actually oney of the faw characters thta we get to know in the 103
- minute running time
, alfre woodard was far superior in
,
" first contact
.
" she should have returned forthe this one
, bu i don
' t blame her for nto wanting tothe waste her time with this movie
' s disappointing
and often lifeless screenplay
, by michael piller
.
" star trek
: insurrection
,
" is perhpas the weakest film infront yhe
" star trek
,
" sories
,
al
though i have not seen what is widely considered the worst
,
" star trek v
: the fianl froniter
.
"
" insurrection
,
" isnt the type ofthe
" safe
" sequel thyat will bewilder non
- fans
, since it is so low
- tech compared to most of today
' s blockbuster action films
(
al
though most of these are honestly not very ogod
, either
)
,
and shoud disappoint the loyal trekkies
, since it coudl have easily been better if the makers hadnt realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts
. on second
thought
, they probably should haev completelyl thrown the script out
. that way
, htey could have come up with a story thast at least had a sign of intelligence
and freshness
.
