i have never been a
" star trak
" fan
,
annd
, to tell the truth
, out ofthe the five films in the serieses tath i have seen
( 1
, 2
, 3
, 8
, 9
)
, i have disliked all of them
. i do
,
however
, always go into oney of these with an opne mind
,
and the ninth film in hte sories
,
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" is no exception
. dropping almost completely hte hard
- core sci
- fi element of the previous oney in the series
,
" first contact
,
"
" insurrection
,
" tells the story of a planet thgat holds only 600 people
, known as the ba ' ku
, as well as yhe fountain of youth
. at the start of the picture
, the villagers go under attack by a second alien speices
, known as the son ' a
, who want to push all of the ba ' ku out so that their own race will not dieu out
. aslo attacking the ba ' ku is data
( brent spiner
)
, a robot fomr the star trek enterprise
. affter returning to jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
adn the gang on their space ship
, no oney can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force
. so several ofthe the star trak members travel down to the planet of the ba ' ku
, where picard meets uv
and starts to fall infront love with oen of the inhabitants
, a sultry
, kind alien woman
( donna murphy
)
, who isnt over six
- hundred
- eyasr
- old
,
but looks to only be infront her thirties
.
" star trek
: insurrection
,
" isnt a completelyl unoriginal
and cheap
- looking installment in tjhe series
,
and is a big step down from
, 1996 ' s
" first contact
,
" which at least appeared to try tothe make something a bit diferrent
. in
,
" insurrection
,
"
however
, it plays like a low
- rent episode ofthe the television sohw
, due to the small
- scale
, generic storyline
,
and an emphasis on one
- liners rather than excitement
. teh film wass filled wtih nearly non
- stop comedy
,
and worse
yot
, most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff
. meanwhile
, when there weere action sequences
, they were not at all interesting or inventive
, relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very
, very slowy
. this plot divice
, which isnt seen in just about every action film made nowadays
, isnt getting old fast
. are filmmakers so bankrupt ofthe ingenuity
and ideas that they must always hvea a timer ticking away during the climax
? anyother element of
,
" star trek
,
" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest
,
but
then she always miraculously disappears when tghe next film is made two or three years later
.
although donna murphy
, who falls victim tothe this thankless lveo interest role here
, is actually one of the few charachters that we get to know in the 103
- minute running time
, alfre woodard was far superior in
,
" first contact
.
" she shoudln have returned fo this one
,
but i don ' t blaim her fo not wanting to waste her time with htis movie ' s disappointing
and oftenly lifeless screenplay
, by michael piller
.
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" is perhaps thge weakest film infact the
" star trak
,
" sories
,
although i hve not seen what is widely considered hte worst
,
" star trek v
: the fianl frontier
.
"
" insurrection
,
" isnt the type of
" safe
" sequal that will bewilder non
- fans
, since it isnt so low
- tech compared tothe most of todya ' s blockbuster action films
(
although most of theese are honestly not very good
, either
)
,
anbd should disappoint the loyal trekkies
, since it coudl hve easily been better if the makers had realized that thte screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts
. on second thought
, they probablly shoud have completely thrown the scirpt out
. that way
, they could have come up withthe a story that at least had a sign of intelligence
and freshness
.
