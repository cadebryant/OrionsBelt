beware of movies with the director
' s name in the title
. take
" john carpenter
' s ghosts of mars
"
( please
)
. if hte carpenter br
and name wasn
' t superglued tothe tyhe title
, this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely
and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network
.
and i would have been spared a headache
. tghe latest ffrom tghe director of
" starman
,
"
" halloween
"
and
" escape ffrom new york
" is a lousy western all gussied uv to look like a futuristic horror flick
. thge production isnt setted on mars in 2176
, where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world
. six hundred
and forty thous
and people infront a matriarchal society live
and work at outposts all over thte red planet
, terra
- forming to make it more hospitible for future generations
. a matriarchal society
. terra
- forming
. sounds pretty intriguing
, eh
? well
, don
' t get your hopes up
.
