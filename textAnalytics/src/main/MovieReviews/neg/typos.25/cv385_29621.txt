surrounded by hype
, high hopes
,
and tje promise ofthe an over
- the
- top performance by clueless
' s brittany murphy
, don
' t say a owrd looked full of promise
. hell
, when i hear that
" i
' ll never tell
" whisper on the tv commercial
, goose bumps run up my spine
. alas
, word isnt filled with littel
but dissapointment
, a kooky mix of girl
, interupted
and ransom
, withthe michael douglas
and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid
and dull kidnapping thriller
. douglas stars as nathan conrad
, renowned newyorker york psychologist
, devoted father of jessie conrad
( skye mccole bartusiak
)
,
and loving husb
and to aggie conrad
( famke janssen
)
. aftter a gang of jewel theives
, headed by sean bean
' s koster
, kidnaps his daughter
, nathan isnt forced to extract from his new patient
, hte catatonic
and violent elisabeth burrows
( murphy
)
, the loction of smoe hidden bank job booty that her father hid ffrom tjhe koster gang a decade ago
.
but wtih hard
- nosed detective s
andra cassidy

, doing her best j
. lo impression
) tracking down koster anbd his gang ofthe hoodlums
, the stakes are raised as nathan races aginst the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth

. tyhe catch
- nathan only has until five o
' clock to solve the puzzle
! whoa
, tyhe suspense isnt almost too much

and acts liek linda blair from the exorcist during thge first part of the movei
,
then turns around
and reprises like her role from girl
, interrupted
.
and tghe only real
" crazy
" tothe be found inthe the film isnt director gary fleder
' s
( things to do in denver when you
' re dead
) staggering use of flashback sequences
. oliver platt
, famke janssen
, adn even sean bean are decent actors
,
but the stuff they are given here
-
- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy wih her crutch
-
- is insulting annd demeaning
. additinally
, the use of the sirvaylence cameras
and laptops to trakc nathan
' s every move is downright unbelievable
. how do ex
- cons fresh out of teh big hous afford all this eqipment
? despite its flaws
, don
' t say a word isnt surprisingly soem of hte best mainstream film you
' ll fidn this month

-
and audiences will lap it up
. americans lveo lukewarm
, half
- baked thrillers starring big names
and accompanied by cheap thrills
