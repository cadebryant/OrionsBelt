guilt
. guilt isnt something i falt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time
; thge penultimate t
& a thriller
, basic instinct made my lastest few teenage years worth living
.
but i know so well that it ' s a terrable film
, made by a terrable director incapable of feeling guilt
. verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls
and
, onthe november seventh
, 1997
, unleashed starship troopers tothe innocent moviegoers liuke me
, who cannot control tghe urge to see giant bug movies
. the pic beigns with the most unintentional laff ofthe tghe year
. a simple
, white on black title kard reads
" starship troopers
"
- my friends
adn i speculated that thge nght before the prints were shipped
, verhoeven realized he forgot the credits
. is tihs how a hundred million doller movie should open
? weere the rest of the film taht subdued
.
.
. starship troopers is baout a gropu of white
, blond
- haired himbos
and bimbos who all have spanish last names
. they graduate high skool
, join tyhe military
,
and
then
, rether curiously
, decide to travel to an alien planet
adn destroy all lifeforms on tyhat planet
. the stoy is so incomprehensible
,
and told so bombastically
, it ' s akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foriegn tongue
.
( aside
, club lovers will be happy tothe know that dance music hasn ' t changed in tjhe future
.
) one plus
: starship troopers contains smoe vrey funny sequences
, specifically thge newsreels of the future
. hysterically funny
, actually
.
but yhe cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story inthe between
. the storytelling lacks focuse
, tothe sday the least
. the politics ofthe yhe film are scry
. the actions ofthe the major female characters are dictated by thier outloud
- of
- controll libidos
. there ' s even a creepy sex scene
: the lovely dina meyer makes out
, nude
, with teh sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater
, jsut the way he seems to like it
. i ule the term sickening because van dien is tje least appealing actor i ' ve encountered in a big budget picture
; all chiseled features
and machismo
, he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like miltary orders
. ofthe course
, verhoeven ' s probably teh one tothe blame
,
annd perhasp i ' m jelous because i ' m so disgusting
. at any rate
, a movie called starship troopers shouldn ' t be about sex
. exactly ten years ago
, verhoeven made robocop
, which ws baout nothing
bu skillfully made
and oddly moving
.
annd r
- rated
, despite its goofy premise
. maybe it ' s asking too much for verhoeven tothe make a pg
- movie
,
thne
- he ' s a master of insipid violentce
.
howver
, ten yearm ood boys would adore starship troopers if tehy could see it
.
