guilt
. guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the nineth time
; thte penultimate t
& a thriller
, basic instinct made my last few teenage eyasr worth living
.
but i know so well that it
' s a terrible film
, made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt
. verhoeven went on to mkae tjhe even more offensive showgirls
and
, on november seventh
, 1997
, unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me
, who cannot control hte urge tothe see giant bug movies
. the pic begins wiht the most unintentional laff of the year
. a simple
, white onthe balck title card reads
" starship troopers
"
- my friends adn i speculated that thte night before thte prints weere shipped
, verhoeven realized he forgot the credits
. isnt tihs how a hundred milion dollar movie should opne
? were the rest ofthe tyhe film that subdued
.
.
. starship troopers is about a group ofthe white
, blond
- haired himbos anbd bimbos who all have spanish last names
. they graduate high school
, join hte miltary
,
and
then
, rether curiously
, decide tothe travel to an alien planet
and destroy all lifeforms onthe thast planet
. tjhe story isnt so incomprehensible
, adn told so bombastically
, it
' s akin to 129 minutes ofthe someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue
.
( aside
, club lovers will be happy to nkow that dance music hasn
' t changed in the future
.
) one plus
: starship troopers contains some very funny sequences
, specifically the newsreels of the future
. hysterically funny
, actualyl
.
but yhe cynicism ofthe these reports left me curious as tothe whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the stor infact between
. the storytelling lacks foucs
, tothe sday the least
. tyhe politics ofthe the film are scary
. the actions of the major female charactors are dictated by their outloud
- of
- control libidos
. ther
' s even a creepy sex scene
: the lovely dina meyer mkaes outloud
, nude
, iwth tjhe sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater
, just the way he seems tothe like it
. i uise the term sickening because van dien is thge least appealing actor i
' ve encountered in a big budget picture
; all chiseled features
and machismo
, he even barks a euology at a funeral like military orders
. of course
, verhoeven
' s probably the one to blame
, anbd perhaps i
' m jelous because i
' m so disgusting
. at any rate
, a movie called starship troopers shouldn
' t be about sex
. exactlly ten years ago
, verhoeven made robocop
, whic wass about nothing
but skillfully made annd oddly moving
.
and r
- rated
, dispite its goofy premise
. maybe it
' s asking too much for verhoeven to amking a pg
- movie
,
then
- he
' s a master ofthe insipid violence
.
however
, ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it
.
