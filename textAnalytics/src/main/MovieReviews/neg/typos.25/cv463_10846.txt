. comments
: malicious
, i suppose
, is an acceptable moview forthe what it is
: a cheap
, b
- movie thriller whic rips off dozens anbd dozens of spurned
- psycho
- lover
- who
- wants
- revenge films
( like futal attraction
, h
and that rocks the cradle
, etc
. etc
.
) tyhat have come before it
. milicous
,
however
, really doesn
' t provide veyr many particularly suspenseful moments
. the plot starts off energetically enought
, the main characters are introduced annd tghe afair between doug
and melissa begins anbd ends pretty early on inspite the film
. it starts to drag
, unfortunately
, after this
. melissa will obviously try to take her revenge onthe doug
( as always seems to happen in movies like these
)
,
but she does so in unimaginative ways that haev been done in other
, better thrillers before
. she drugs someone
. she kills a family pet
and leaves it in the girlfriend
' s apartment
.
and
, of course
, she stalks
, so we see a number of shots
, wich are suposed tothe be suspenseful
, where she
' s spying on doug anbd his girlfriend
. i won
' t reveal the ludicrous ending to htis turkey
, bu i warn you that it
' s both painfully obvious anbd a real yawner
. john vernon does a remarkably good job at palying the not
- so
- bright baseball jock who initally gets swept awya by melissa
( one of the script
' s faults is to try tothe pass off a charachter like thsi as a pre
- med student
)
. the same cannot be said
,
though
, for molly ringwald
. at times
, she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine
, especially during her silent
, i
' m
- going
- tothe
- stare
- ytou
- down scenes
. at other times
, howver
, she just seems somehow goofy
and out of place
. in one particular scene whcih i guess was supposed to be suspenseful
, she screeches
" f
-
- k ytou
, you b
-
-
-
-
- d
" annd throws a phone
. she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can
' t help bu laugh
. malicious certainly isn
' t tyhe worst thriller of its kind outloud in teh video racks
( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out ther
)
, bu it isn
' t all that ogod or origional either
. feel free to treat this film maliciously
, watch something alse
