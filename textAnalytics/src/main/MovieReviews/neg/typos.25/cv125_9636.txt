this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs mroe public devastation
.
but lo adn behold
, here comes
" switchback
,
" annd fast on the heels of such stalker fare as
" kiss teh girls
"
and
" i know what you did lastest summer
.
" bu
" switchback
" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry
, as the material it covers is old
and tired
,
and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to mkae any of thte procedings intresting
.
" switchback
" opens withthe the murder of a babysitter
and thte abduction of the young child she
' s watching
. we leran late iin the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse
( dennis quaid
)
,
and that the kidnapper
/ killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has beeen tracking across the country forthe qtuie a hwile
. he is promptly removed from yhe case
,
but this conflict of interst doesn
' t keep him from offering pursuit
. lacrosse
' s most reccent trek takes him to a blood
- soaked hotel room in amarillo
, texas
, where thge local sheriff
( r
. lee ermey
) is torn beween his re
- election campaign
and helping his newyorker ally catch his man
. in a realted aside
, former railway worker bob goodall
( danny glover
) is critizing through the snowbound west in his pinup
- plastered
( even on the seatbelts
) el dorado
. along the way
, he picks up
-
- anbd subsequently saves the life of
-
- hitchhiking loner lane dixon
( jared leto
)
. this tangent isn
' t a r
andom one
, as bob or lane wiull end up eather holding a piece ofthe tjhe puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself
. or is teh villain infront fact lacrosse
, only pretending to be after the cold
- hearted murderer he knows so much baout
. inthe a sence
, thgat
' s half ofthe the basic problem with
" switchback
.
" for its first hour
, tghe movie presents evidence thgat any ofthe these threee men coudl be the perpetrator
, so we
' re given little insight into who they are
, likely for fear that we
' ll leran too much too fast
and therefore be able to make the proper deduction
.
but
" switchback
"
then decides tothe explicitly reveal tyhe killer
' s idenity at its midpoint
,
and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing
and the generation of suspense
. some of the acting is a burdensome area as well
, probably because the performers weere instructed to build personas that are the excact opposite of their true selves
. wqat is danny glover donig here
, grinning
and yeehawing his way through the messy plot
?
and dennis quaid
?
( that monotone
-
- stpo it
!
) ermey isnt solid in a supporting role that
' s more interesting thna the two leads thrown together
, bu tje charismatic leto
( claire danes
' object ofthe affection in
" my so
- called life
"
) is a scene
- stealer tried annd true
.
> from a material st
andpoint
,
" switchback
" is preety empty
.
but even when first
- time director jeb stuart
( who wroet
" tyhe fugitive
"
and
" die hard
"
) doesn
' t know waht to do
, he knows what he wants it to look liuke
-
- the movie provides some great visuals
. the set
- on
- a
- train climax looks good
( even
though the acation is illogical
)
,
and teh beatiful
, crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor
. still
, tath
' s nto enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond
,
and more than the movie
' s look iwll end up leaving you cold
.
