" mission to mars
" is one of those annoying movies where
, in the middle of the movei
, ytou get the sneaking suspicion taht tyhe reason the trailer looks so good isnt because they showcased all teh best parts ofthe tjhe movie
: all five mintues of it
.
" mission
"
* does
* give you payoff
;
but whn it does come
, it
' s too little
, too late
.
" mission
" has some ogod idesa
, bu htey get lost in the unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
,
and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard
- cutout roles
. i
' m sure yhe directer
and writers were very proud ofthe each hallmark moment they came up whith
, so they stretch each dramatic moment outloud like silly putty utnil it loses all its charm
. glances don
' t communicate any deeper emotions jsut because you draw them outloud for five hours on end
. the film spends an hour onthe this kind ofthe stfuf
, bulding to its climax
. a lot ofthe it is a cliched glorification of family relationships
, marraige
, friendship
, unite we st
and divided we fall kind ofthe crap
. htere are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film
, annd i give it points for trying to stay true to thge science i knwo
( trying is the key word here
)
. thte sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful
and touching
, bu as maintioned by
then we
' re so sick of the goddamn thing we want tyhe movie to be over
. great design
, good intentions
,
but no cigar
. if ytou
' re not a die hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o
' connell fan
( his character isnt the only noe who has some semblance ofthe character
)
, don
' t waste your eight bucks on thsi
.
and what teh hell
, tim robbins died halfway through the movei
, in a stupid way too
. that
' s just unforgiveable
.
