yuo know the plot
: a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime only to be duble
- crossed by a fatal femme
. in
" palmetto
,
" the dimwit is harry barber
( woody harrelson
)
, a repertwar who
' s jstu beeen released fomr prision
( he ws framed by teh gangsters
and corrupt officials he wass investigating
)
. enter la femme
: rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, hte sexy young wife ofthe the richest man infact palmetto
, florida
( rolf hoppe
)
. she
and her stepdaughter odette
( chlo
? sevigny
) have a plot to extort 500k from the ood man
: harry wiull
" kidnap
" odette
. after groping both women
, harry agrees
. as everyone except harry can see
, he
' s being set up as a fall guy
. sure enough
, before long
, harry has a dead body in his trunk
and tyhe cops onthe his tail
. his brother
- in
- law
( toom wright
)
, an assistant da
, has hired harry to be thte press liaison for tje case
, so harry gets a front row seat forthe his own manhunt
(
and we get to watch him sweat
- litterally
)
. there are several plot twists
, of course
- a couple of them even took me by surprise
. apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog
,
and they
' re onthe harry like he
' s the onyl bone in the kennel
. shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery
' s wolf tothe show up
. her incredible performance in
" leaving las vegas
" seems to have been a fluke
. here
, she coudl easily be mistaken forthe melanie griffith
. shue
' s character is suposed tothe be a savy schemer
but she comes off as a brainless bimbo
. infront addition to shue adn sevigny
, the kennel includes gina gershon
( who filled the dimwit
- with
- a
- shady
- past role in
" bound
"
) as harry
' s girlfriend nina
; when harry gets out of jail
, she licks his face
( now there
' s a horndog
)
. the parts are so overplayed that with a littel push
" palmetto
" coudl have been an over
- the
- top parody of film noir a la
" romeo is bleeding
.
" as it is
, it
' s best watched at 2am on showtime
( the loev scenes seem to haev been written fo oney of that channel
' s soft porn programs anyway
)
.
" palmetto
" has a well
- known director
, volker schl
? ndorff
, who
' s best known for his adaptations of major literary works
, especially
" yhe tin drum
.
" i suppose he must haev been drawn to this plot
- by
- numbers script by teh same admiration forthe classic film noir that led scorsese to remake
" capetown fear
.
" schl
? ndorff tries hard
- he makse an interesting motif out ofthe the ubiquitous palmetto bugs
-
but nothing can freshen up this stale script
.
