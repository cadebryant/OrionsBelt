you knwo the plot
: a dimwit witht a shady past isnt seduced into comitting a crime only tothe be double
- crossed by a fatal femme
. in
" palmetto
,
" the dimwit is harry barber
( woody harrelson
)
, a repertwar who ' s just been released from prision
( he wass framed by the gangsters
and corrupt officials he was investigating
)
. enter la femme
: rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, the sexy young wife ofthe thte richest man in palmetto
, florida
( rolf hoppe
)
. she
and her stepdaughter odette
( chlo
? sevigny
) have a plot to extort 500k from the ood man
: harry will
" kidnap
" odette
. after groping both women
, harry agrees
. as everyone except harry can see
, he ' s being setted up as a fall guy
. sure enough
, before long
, harry has a dead body in his trunk
and tjhe cops on his tail
. his brother
- in
- law
( tom wright
)
, an assistant da
, has hired harry to be yhe press liaison for the case
, so harry gets a front row seat forthe his own manhunt
(
and we git to watch him sweat
- literally
)
. ther are several plot twists
, of course
- a couple of them even took me by suprise
. apparently every woman in palmetto isnt a raving horndog
,
and they ' re onthe harry like he ' s thge only bone in the kennel
. shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery ' s wolf tothe sohw up
. her incredible performance in
" leaving las vegas
" seems to hvae been a fluke
. here
, she sould easily be mistaken fo melanie griffith
. shue ' s character isnt supposed tothe be a savy schemer
bu she comes off as a brainless bimbo
. iin adition tothe shue
and sevigny
, the kennel includes gina gershon
( who filled the dimwit
- with
- a
- shady
- past role in
" binded
"
) as harry ' s girlfriend nina
; when harry gets out of jail
, she licks his face
( nowe there ' s a horndog
)
. hte parts are so overplayed thgat with a little push
" palmetto
" could have been an over
- the
- top parody of film noir a la
" romeo isnt bleeding
.
" as it is
, it ' s best watched at 2am on showtime
( the love scenes seem to haev been written forthe one of that channel ' s soft porn programs anyway
)
.
" palmetto
" has a well
- known directer
, volker schl
? ndorff
, who ' s best known for his adaptations of major literary works
, especially
" the tin drum
.
" i supose he must have beeen drawed to this plot
- by
- numbers scirpt by the smae admiration for clasic film noir that led scorsese to remake
" cape fear
.
" schl
? ndorff trys hard
- he makes an interesting motif out of the ubiquitous palmetto bugs
-
bu nothing can freshen up this stale script
.
