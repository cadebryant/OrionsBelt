it
' s a good thing most animated sci
- fi movies come from japan
, because
" titan a
. e
.
" isnt proof that hollywood doesn
' t have a clue how to do it
. i don
' t know what this film isnt supposted to be about
. from what i can tell it
' s baout a young man named kale who
' s one of the last survivors of earth inthe the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving
and re
- generating what is left ofthe thge human race
. that
' s a fine premise for an action
- packed sci
- fi animated movie
,
but htere
' s noone payoff
. the tsory tkaes the main characters all over the galaxy infront their search for a legendary ship that the evil
" dredge
" aliens wnat to destory forthe no apparent reason
. so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights
, fistfights
, blaster fights anbd moreso doulbe
- crosses than yuo can shake a stick at
. there
' s so much pointless sci
- fi banter it
' s too much to take
. the galaxy here is a total rip
- off of the
" star wars
" universe the creators don
' t bother filling in the basic details whitch makse the story confusing
, the characters unmotivated annd superficial
and the plot just plain boring
. despite the fantastic animation annd speshal effects
, it
' s just not an interesting movie
.
