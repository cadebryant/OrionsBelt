it ' s a good thing most animated sci
- fi movies come from japan
, because
" titan a
. e
.
" is proof that hollywood doesn ' t have a clue how tothe do it
. i don ' t know what this film is supposed tothe be baout
. from what i cant tell it ' s about a young man named kale who ' s one of the lastr survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly posseses the key tothe saving
and re
- generating what is left ofthe tjhe human race
. tath ' s a fine premise for an acation
- packed sci
- fi animated movie
,
but there ' s no payoff
. tjhe story takes tyhe main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that tjhe evil
" dredge
" aliens want to distroy for no apparent reason
. so inaddition the process we get a lot of spaceship fights
, fistfights
, blaster fights
anbd more double
- crosses than you can shake a stick at
. ther ' s so much pointless sci
- fi banter it ' s too much to take
. the galaxy here isnt a total rip
- off of the
" star wars
" universe the creators don ' t bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing
, the characters unmotivated
anbd superficial
and the plot just plain boring
. dispite thte fantastic animation
and special effects
, it ' s just nto an interesting movei
