if you don ' t think kevin kline in drag is funny
, wait
? til you see iwll smith in drag
- it ' s even less funny
. by the timne jim west
( smith
) disguised hismelf as a belly dancer to bail his captued comrade
, artemus gordon
( kline
)
, from yhe clutches of evil dr
. loveless
( branagh
)
, i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west
, the new summer blockbuster from men infact black directer barry sonnenfeld
. is the ood west relaly a breeding ground for high comedy
, anyway
?
( if your answer is no
,
then you recall rustler ' s rapsady or back to the future part iii
; if your answer is yes
, ytou ' re thinking of blazing saddles
,
but thgat movei was a parody of the western genre
, nto a nineteenth centruy romp
.
) 1869
. jim west isnt a quick
- draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon
, under orders from presient grant
( kline again
, whose impression
, fo all we know
, isnt dead
- on
)
, to apprehend legless loveless
, the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states
and sell it back to britian
and spain
. how will loveless accomplish this
? well
, by hulking around the desert in an enormous
, mecanical tarantula
, of course
. bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar
( hayek
)
, whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless
, joins west
and gordon on their gadget
- filled train
.
( gordon first dicovers rita in a cage
, waiting to be rescued
.
) racial politics obviously prevented hte filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west
, despite the movie ' s
" hip
" attitude toward the black thign
.
( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a
" nigger
" before that person can finish speaking teh word
. super
.
) at any rate
, i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous
,
but she ' s a walking dress
- up toy
.
( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film
: she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek
- a
- boo flap ofthe her pyjamas
.
) jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith
, whose comic timing has alwasy beeen hit or miss
, as episodes ofthe
" the fresh prince of bel
- air
" demonstrate
. smith ' s a better reactor tahn actor
, which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black
- he didn ' t strat out a hero
. in wild wild west he ' s required to exude eastwood cool
and amuse at the same tiome
(
and from frame noe
)
, a difficult feat i ' m not sure any living performer could pull off
. smith is ill equipped
, fo example
, to handle tjhe moent in whcih jim west performs stand
- up for some rednecks at his pwn hanging
. waht attracted sonnenfeld tothe this material
? htis isn ' t the first timne he hasnt adapted a tv show fo tyhe big screen
( the addams famaly
, anyone
?
)
,
bu it ' s the first big stinker ofthe his career as a director
. wild wild west is poorly
- paced bombast
, full ofthe doa gags
( ted levine shows uv as a genaral who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid
; levine palyed buffalo bill in the silence ofthe tghe lambs
- he ' s too intense to get an intentional laugh
)
, lousy special effects
( tyhe bluescreening is amateurish
- foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds
)
,
and frequent illogic
.
( to wit
, its ridiculous villain so badly wnats jim west out of hte way taht he
.
.
. drops him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic
, ugly henchmen
, instead ofthe shooting him at point blank rige with one of the many guns on board the tarantula
.
) wild wild west ' s bright spots
, such as teh kool opening credits sequence
, bai lign ' s all
- too
- brief appearance as a femme fatale
, or the brilliant
" his master ' s voice
" joke
, are all part ofthe yhe film ' s first half
, hwihc is more clever
and enjoyable
, at least
, tahn its second
. wehn
, towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west
, gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane
and west rejects it
, htere was a collective groan among audience members
: it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider
, the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz
- bang finale
.
