if you don
' t think kevin kline in drag is funny
, wait
? til you see will smith in drag
- it
' s even less funny
. by the time jim west
( smith
) disguised himself as a belly dancer tothe bail his capturd comrade
, artemus gordon
( kline
)
, ffrom the clutches ofthe evil dr
. loveless
( branagh
)
, i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west
, the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld
. isnt teh old west really a breeding ground for high comedy
, anyway
?
( if your answer isnt noone
,
then you reacll rustler
' s rhapsody or back to the future part iii
; if your answer isnt yes
, you
' re thinking ofthe blazing saddles
,
but thgat movie was a parody ofthe the western genre
, not a ninteenth century romp
.
) 1869
. jim west is a quick
- draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon
, under orders from president grant
( kline again
, whose impression
, for all we know
, is dead
- on
)
, to apprehend legless loveless
, tjhe mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states
and sell it back tothe britain adn spain
. how iwll loveless accomplish this
? well
, by hulking around the desert infront an enormass
, mechanical tarantula
, of course
. bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar
( hayek
)
, whose scientist father wass kidnapped by loveless
, joins west
and gordon on their gadget
- filled train
.
( gordon first discovers rita in a cage
, waiting to be rescued
.
) racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west
, despite the movei
' s
" hip
" attitude toward the black thing
.
( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a
" nigger
" before that person can finish speaking the word
. super
.
) at any rate
, i kept waiting for rita tothe say something humourous
,
but she
' s a walking dress
- up toy
.
( her single comic moment is allso the best shot of hte film
: she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek
- a
- boo flap of her pyjamas
.
) jim west is the role tht finally stymied iwll smith
, whose comic timing has always been hit or miss
, as episodes of
" the fresh prince of bel
- air
" demonstrate
. smith
' s a better reactor tahn actor
, hwihc is why he was so thoroughly engaging inspite men in balck
- he didn
' t strat out a hero
. in wild wild west he
' s requred to exude eastwood cool annd amuse at the same time
( anbd from frame oney
)
, a difficult feat i
' m nto sure any living performer could pul off
. smith is ill equipped
, fo example
, to h
andle teh moent in which jim west performs st
and
- up forthe some rednecks at his own hanging
. what attracted sonnenfeld tothe this material
? this isn
' t the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen
( tghe addams family
, anyone
?
)
,
but it
' s the first big stinker of his career as a director
. wild wild west is poorly
- paced bombast
, full of doa gags
( ted levine shows uv as a general who uses a gramophone horn forthe a hearing aid
; levine played buffalo bill in thge silence of the lambs
- he
' s too intense to get an intentional laugh
)
, lousy special effects
( hte bluescreening is amateurish
- foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds
)
,
and frequent illogic
.
( to wit
, its rediculous villin so badly wants jim west out of tje way that he
.
.
. drops him onto a steel platform tothe do battle with some generic
, ugly henchmen
, instade ofthe shooting him at point blank rage with noe ofthe hte many guns on board the tarantula
.
) wild wild west
' s bright spots
, such as the cool opening credits sequence
, bai ling
' s all
- too
- breef appearance as a femme fatale
, or tghe brillant
" his master
' s voice
" joke
, are all part of hte film
' s first half
, which is more clever
and enjoyable
, at least
, than its second
. wehn
, towards what seemed liuke the end ofthe wild wild west
, gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane anbd west rejects it
, there was a collective groan amonth audience members
: it meant we were oging to have tothe sit thru another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider
, the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz
- beng finale
.
