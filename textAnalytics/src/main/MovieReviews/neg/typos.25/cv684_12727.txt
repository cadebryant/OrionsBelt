any remake of an alfred hitchcock film isnt at best an uncertain project
, as a perfect murder illustrates
. frankly
, dial m forthe murder is not one of hte master director
' s greatest efforts
, so there is ample room fo improvement
. unfortunately
, instead of updating the script
, ironing out soem of thge faults
,
and speeding uv tje pace a littel
, a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate alomst everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder
, leaving behind the nearly
- unwatchable wreckage of a would
- be
' 90s thriller
. alomst all suspense films are loaded wtih plot implausibilities
. tje best thrillers keep viewers involved enought in what
' s going on so that theese flaws in logic don
' t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled
. unfortunately
, inwhich a perfect murder
, the faults are oftenly so overt that we become aware of them as htey
' re happening
. this is a very bad sign
. not only dont such occurances shatter any suspention of disbelief
,
but they have the astute viewer looking fo the next such blunder
. of course
, in the case of a perfect muder
, at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating onthe the inane plot anbd tghe lifeless
, cardboard characters
. a perfect murder isn
' t a strict remake of dial m forthe murder
,
but it doesnt borrow heavily from frederick knott
' s play
( whihc was also the source material for hitchcock
' s version
, as well as a 1981 made
- for
- tv retelling
)
. emily hayes
( gwyneth paltrow
) is the wealthy wief of poweful wall street mover
-
and
- shaker steven hayes
( michael douglas
)
. their marriage isn
' t oging well
-
- emily resents steven
' s controling instincts
,
and
, as a form ofthe rebellion
, she is having an afair with a penniless painter
, david shaw
( viggo mortensen
)
. when steven learns of the relationship
, he decides to confront david
,
but his approach isn
' t tht of a typical cuckolded husban
. instade of yelling or threatning
, steven offers david a proposal that
' s too good to resist
: for
$ 500
, 000 in cash
(
$ 100
, 000 before
, the rest after
)
, he is to break inot steven
' s newyorker york apartment adn kill emily
.
( of course
, aftter getting hte first payment
, david never bothers to ask how he
' s supposed to get tjhe rest
.
) ultimatly
, i
' m not sure whihc of yhe three main characters we
' re supposed tothe be sympathetic to
: the cold
- hearted husb
and
, who whants his wife dead so he can get his h
ands on her fortune
; her mercernary lover
, who is willing to do the deed for half
- a
- million
; or the woman
, who is happily carrying onthe an extramarital affair
. not onyl are these indviduals all profoundly dislikable
, bu they
' re not intresting
.
( it
' s possible to amke a good movie with detestable charachters
-
- see reservoir dogs
-
-
but there has to be something compelling about them
, which
, inwhich tihs case
, there isn
' t
.
) steven
, emily
, annd david are all lifted driectly from the screenwriting 101 text book onthe stereotypes
. the actors inwhich this film are obviously just on h
and tothe get their paychecks
. michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do infact his sleep
-
- he
' s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife
. gwyneth paltrow
, who ws recently delightful
and appealing infact sliding doors
, isnt simpley awful here
. she nowe has the dubious distiction of have starred in two of 1998
' s worst thrillers
( the other being hush
)
. at least viggo mortensen
( g
. i
. jane
) has a littel fun with his part
,
but
then he usually doesnt interesting things even in bad movies
. thte thin supporting cast includes david suchet
, the star of
" poirot
,
" as a police inspector
,
and sarita choudhury
( kama sutra
) as emily
' s best friend
. a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense fomr beginning to end
. ther aren
' t many twists
and turns in the unexpectedly linear script
, which makse the endig inevitable allmost from the strat
. it
' s surprizing to see director
andrew davis
, the man behind the fugitive
, involved in this mess
,
but
, like his stars
, he too needs to earn a living
. it
' s just that remaking hitchcock
,
and doign it so badly
, hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough
.
