- chasing amy
, a slew of lvoe
- triangle movies
: htis month we have kissing a fool
, co
- starring amy ' s pwn lee
,
and april brings us the object of my affection
, which may as well be titled chasing allan
, for it is the story ofthe a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate
.
( tothe be absolutely six degrees ofthe kevin bacon about it
, that film stars schwimmer ' s friend jennifer aniston
.
) if only kevin smith could write them all
.
.
. schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max
, who falls in love wiht his best firend jay
( lee
) ' s book editor samantha
( avital
) a mere twenty
- four horus after meeting her
. they are soon engaged
,
annd max
, because of his own raging libido
, grows suspicious of samantha ' s fidelity
. he convinces jay tothe flirt with samantha druing thte developemet of his book
, to
" test her
"
. thge trouble is
, jay might be secretly in lvoe with her
. to stretch this flat
, sitcom premise to feature lenght
, the plot is framed by a climactic wedding
, at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale
-
- the events leading up to tje nuptials
-
- to an annoying fat man
and his silly girlfriend
. hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film
; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue inot mildly humorous dialogue
;
and lee
, poor lee
, is miscast
. so hysterically funny in chasing amy
, here he is forced tothe repress his comic instincts
: tothe swear
, to yell
, to talk about oral sex
.
.
. the script ' s diea ofthe a character trait isnt tothe stress that jay is a
" sensitive man
"
,
anbd
then show him drinking pepto bismol when he ' s stewing over his girl trouble
. as for avital
, an israeli actress
, she is warm
and sweet
,
but we don ' t konw anytying baout her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to relize the most obvious things
. she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer
, who plays schwimmer ' s assistant
adn personal temptress
, turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo
. there are a handful
, a smattering
, of good scenes in kissing a fool
. i enjoyed a moent in a comedy club
, durig hwihc jay gets uv
adn asks
" hasnt anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wnated to kill her
?
" over
annd over until he ' s booted off stage
. ther are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that ' s on the page
. kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke
- machine firends tyhat spawned schwimmer ' s movie career
, so sive yourself eight dollars
and watch three epidsodes of tht series bcak to bakc
.
