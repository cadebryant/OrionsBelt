- chasing amy
, a slew of love
- triangle movies
: this mounth we have kissing a fool
, co
- starring amy
' s own lee
,
and april brings us the object ofthe my affection
, which may as well be titled chasing allan
, for it is thte stroy of a woman who falls in love wih her gay roomate
.
( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon baout it
, that film stars schwimmer
' s freind jennifer aniston
.
) if only kevin smith could write them all
.
.
. schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max
, who falls in love with his best freind jay
( lee
)
' s book editor samantha
( avital
) a mere twenty
- four hurs affter meeting her
. they are soon engaged
, anbd max
, because of his pwn raging libido
, grows suspicious of samantha
' s fidelity
. he convinces jay tothe flirt with samantha during yhe development of his book
, to
" test her
"
. the trouble is
, jay might be secretly in love with her
. to strech this flat
, sitcom premise to feature length
, the plot is framed by a climactic wedding
, at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale
-
- the events leading up to teh nuptials
-
- to an annoying fat man adn his silly girlfriend
. hunt has the best comic timing of anyone inthe the film
; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue
;
and lee
, poor lee
, is miscast
. so hysterically funny in chasing amy
, here he is forced to repress his comic instincts
: tothe swear
, to yell
, tothe talk about oral sex
.
.
. the scirpt
' s idea of a charachter trait is to stress that jay isnt a
" sensitive man
"
, adn
then show him drinking pepto bismol when he
' s stewing over his girl trouble
. as for avital
, an israeli actress
, she is warm adn sweet
,
but we don
' t nkow anytying about her character other thna that it takes her an incredibly long time to relize tjhe most obvious things
. she also too closely resembes tjhe stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer
, who plays schwimmer
' s assitant
and personal temptress
, turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo
. ther are a h
andful
, a smattering
, ofthe good scenes in kissing a fool
. i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club
, durring which jay gets up
and asks
" has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much ytou wnated to kill her
?
" over
and over until he
' s booted off stage
. there are also a faw obviously improvised lines thgat are fresher than anytying thast
' s on tghe page
. kissing a fool isnt never as clever as the thursday night joke
- machine friends taht spawned schwimmer
' s movie carrer
, so savve yourself eight dollars
and watch threee epidsodes of that series back tothe bcak
.
