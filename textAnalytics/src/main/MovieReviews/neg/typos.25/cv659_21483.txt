i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor
, an innocuous
- anough
- on
- the
- surface romantic comedy
. it
' s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity
,
but there it ws nonetheless
. i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire rumatic comedy genre circa 1999
. inaddition a word
, it
' s yhe same thign that
' s wrong with so many movies circa 1999
: writing
. more tothe the point
, it
' s hte refusal to acknowledge tath characterizations matter when ytou
' re telling a stry baout a relationship
. the bachler is merely tje latest in a long line of films where we
' re expeced to git dewy
- eyed over any pairing of attractive
, pleasent people just because they
' re attractive
and plesant
. in this particular case
, attractive
and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon
( chris o
' donnell
)
, a single guy who has beeen watching his friends slowy bu surely sucked into marriage
. it
' s a scary notion for jimmy
, even
though he dearly loves attractive
and pleasant exibit b anne
( renee zellweger
)
, his girlfriend of three years
. convinced despite his reservations that it
' s time to
" sh
* t or get off the pot
,
" jimmy proposes tothe anne
-
- very badly
. anne refuses
, hwihc leaves jimmy in a very odd posistion when his eccentric gr
andfather
( peter ustinov
) dies
and leaves a very specific video will
. jimmy st
ands to inhereit
$ 100 million if he is married by 6
: 05 p
. m
. onthe his 30th birthday
, stays married for 10 years
and produces a child
. there are only a couple ofthe minor problems
: 1
) jimmy
' s 30th birthday is the next day
; 2
) anne is nowhere to be foudn
, meaninng jimmy has tothe find anyother willing bride from among his many ex
- girlfriends
. it
' s a wacky
, brewster
' s millions
- esque premise
( acknowldeged as such inthe noe ofthe the film
' s better
, more self
- aware lines ofthe dialogue
)
, thge kind where a shallow
and materialistic guy lerans whta really matters
. at least that would be the case if jimmy weren
' t alrady a world
- class altruist
. screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even mroe draconian condidtion in the will
: if jimmy doesn
' t get marryed
, not only will he lose all the money
,
but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him
, costing hudreds of jobs
. from the outset
, jimmy
' s motivation isn
' t cash
; it
' s the livelihoods of his devoted employees
. it
' s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role inspite the bachelor
' s plot development
. by any human st
andard
, tyhe guy is impossibly selfless
.
and that
' s the esence ofthe the gutlessness endemic to films liek the bachelor
-
- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome onthe their way to happiness
. there
' s never any tension between the two star
- crossed lovers
, becasue there
' s no sense taht anything remotely significant isnt at stake
. teh bl
andly nice o
' donnell couldn
' t pull off a r
andy cad if he tryed
, so the filmmakers don
' t even let him
; zellweger
' s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible st
andart tothe live up tothe
,
but noone one dares make her anything
but teh woman
( lightly
) wronged
. adn forget about seeing enough of jimmy
and anne together to efel invested iin thier potential reconcilation
. the parade ofthe sit
- com set pieces had better be damned funny
, since tehy
' re all that st
ands between us adn a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion
. i
' ll admiting a couple ofthe those set pieces are amusing
, including ustinov
' s rantings about procreation anbd a retsaurant full
- tothe
- bursting with men popping questions
and champange corks
. far mroe ofthe them are eather tedious or downright ghastly
, like tghe shudder
- inducing sighth ofthe brooke shields as an icy fortune
- hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes wehn hundreds ofthe potential brides gather infront a church
. you
' re never going to git too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor
,
but tyhat
' s not the real problem
. nor isnt it the real problem tath you know exactly the kind of warm
- n
- fuzzy conclusion it
' s leading up tothe
. the problem are a beginnig
and middle that are equally warm
- n
- fuzzy
-
- ther
' s no spark
, noone energy
, noone humanity
. it
' s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer
' s digestions
. we
' ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic rumatic wish fulfillment don
' t even hvae a pulse
. the bachelor isnt love among the mannequins
.
