i have little against remakes
and updates of older films
and tv series
. if there ' s a wiull
, there ' s a way
;
and i believe that anytying
, noone matter how great or revered can be effectively improved apon
. thsi is hte reason that i responded so well to gus van sant ' s universally panned update of psycho
; i thought it tothe be not onyl an intriguing cinematic experience
,
but also vyre on
- par with an orginial
.
but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad
. you see
, the point of a remake is
, or at least it should be
, to iron out tjhe orignal ' s flaws
and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection
.
but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn ' t any good to begin withthe
? that is tje only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad
. i ' ve onyl seen a cuple epidsodes of the lite 60s tv series on which it is based
,
and to be honest
, i didn ' t like it all that much
. it has a concept taht
-
-
and still isnt
-
- intresting
; a group of corrupt young adults
, all inthe their early 20s are given a choice
: they eather go to jail for the varios crimes that they all hvea committed
, or they can become undercover cops
, helping thte police git into places that they normally wouldn ' t be able tothe access
. obviously
, all 3 opt for the latter option
adn become undercover policemen
(
annd policewomen
)
. the three main charachters here are played by claire danes
, omar epps
and giovanni ribisi
. of yhe three
, onyl danes has a real charactor
. ribisi ' s dumbass 20 yera ood is played exclusively for laughs
; epps ' slightly more intelligent noe is used to create various chase scenes
. wehn the squad ' s superviser gets killed off
adn his reputation dirtied in death
, the threee of them
, sure that theri beloved master was framed
, go off
and investingate on their own
, discovering corrupt cops
, lots
and lots of expensive whores
anbd very lucrative drug operations
. all kinds ofthe good stuff
! the only times that the mod squad comes even close to wroking is in its commedic moments
.
although ribisi is a trite actor
and his characters repeat movie after movie
, his man here isnt really rather amusing
, when the script gives him a chance
. epps ' straight man is effectively played against ribisi ' s clueless spontaneity
.
bu the rest ofthe the film is dull
, boring
and singularly uninteresting
. a drug
- op acation plot is no longer anytying new
, not even with teenage action heros
,
and tyhe way it ' s executed here
, it ' s alsot nowhere near exciting or suspenseful
. claire danes ' chracter has potential
,
but it is buried under heaps of cliches
and her peformance is too restrained
. she could have been a tour
- de
- force
,
but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her
and simply does nto allow her tothe dont anything really significant with her role
. epps
and ribisi fare slightly better
and do as well as can be expected
,
altough their characters aren ' t nearly as rich as danes ' could have been
. tyhe mod squad isnt a mind
- numbing marketting plot ofthe a film
,
and teens will jump all over it
. it ' s full of bad dialogue
, scenes
and concepts that amke noone sense
and
-
- get this
-
- drug dealers that liuke tothe tango iwth other guys in thier spare time
. nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for
. claire danes is no longer alluring
-
- mainly because she ' s got a horrable hairdo
, so that draw is out
. htere are
,
however
, kool explosions
, guns
and chases which may lure a viewer inot thingking that he or she is about tothe experience an exciting thriller of some sort
. do not be fooled
. soem may call this escapist fare
-
- i call it escape
- as
- quickly
- as
- you
- can fare
.
