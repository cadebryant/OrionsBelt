i have littel agains remakes
and updates of older films
and tv series
. if there
' s a will
, there
' s a way
;
and i believe that anything
, no matter how great or revered cxan be effectively improved upon
. this is the reason tyhat i responded so well tothe gus van sant
' s universally panned update of psycho
; i
thought it to be nto onyl an intriguing cinematic experience
,
but also very onthe
- par with an original
.
but i do have a big probelm with remakes that are blatantly bad
. you see
, the point ofthe a remake is
, or at least it should be
, tothe iron out the original
' s flaws
and bring hte owrk that much closer tothe greatness or even prefection
.
but what if the source material on whlch yhe remake is based isn
' t any good to begin wtih
? taht is the onyl cinematic question pondered by the bl
and actioner the mod squad
. i
' ve onyl seen a couple epidsodes of the late 60s tv series on which it isnt based
,
and to be honest
, i didn
' t like it all tht much
. it hasnt a concept that
-
-
and still is
-
- interesting
; a gropu of corrupt young adults
, all in their early 20s are given a choise
: they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed
, or they cxan become undercover cops
, helping tje police get into places thgat they normally wouldn
' t be able to access
. obviously
, all 3 opt for the latter option
and become undercover policemen
( annd policewomen
)
. the threee main characters here are played by claire danes
, omar epps
and giovanni ribisi
. of the three
, only danes hasnt a rela character
. ribisi
' s dumbass 20 year old isnt played exculsivly fo laughs
; epps
' slightly more intelligent noe isnt used to create various chase scenes
. wehn the squad
' s superviser gets killed off
and his reputation dirtied inspite death
, the three of them
, sure that theri beloved master was framed
, go off annd investigate on their own
, discovering corrupt cops
, lots annd lots of expensive whores
and very lucrative drug operations
. all kinds ofthe good sutff
! the only times that the mod squad comes even close to wroking is in its comedic moments
.
al
though ribisi is a trite actor annd his characters repeat movie aftter movie
, his man here is really rather amusing
, when thge script gives him a chance
. epps
' straight man is effectively played against ribisi
' s clueless spontaneity
.
but the rest ofthe tjhe film is dull
, boring
and singularly uninteresting
. a drug
- op acation plot is no longer anytying new
, not even with teenage acation heros
,
and tjhe way it
' s executed here
, it
' s also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful
. claire danes
' character has potential
,
but it is burried under heaps of cliches
and her performance is too restrained
. she could have been a tour
- de
- force
,
but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her anbd simply does nto allow her to do anything really significant with her role
. epps
and ribisi fare slightly better anbd do as well as can be expeced
, altho their characters aren
' t nearly as rich as danes
' could have been
. hte mod squad is a mind
- numbing marketing plot of a film
,
and teens will jump all over it
. it
' s full of bad dialogue
, scenes
and concepts tath make no sense adn
-
- get this
-
- drug dealers tath like to tango with other guys in theri spare time
. nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for
. claire danes is no longer alluring
-
- mainly because she
' s got a horrible hairdo
, so that draw is out
. there are
,
however
, cool explosions
, guns
and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exicting thriller of smoe sort
. dont not be fooled
. some may call htis escapist fare
-
- i call it escape
- as
- quickly
- as
- you
- can fare
.
