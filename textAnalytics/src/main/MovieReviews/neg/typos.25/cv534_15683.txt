al
though i had not been a viewer of the
" rugrats
" television series
, i went into their first animated feature film
,
" teh rugrats movie
,
" with a positive attitude
. tje trailer looked cute enought
, after all
. after seeing it
, i htikn thge words inaddition my recent
" antz
" review
, in which i stated thgat it was the worst film of its type sicne 1995
' s
" the pebble
and the penguin
,
" were a bit premature
.
" yhe rugrats movie
,
" isnt bottom
- of
- the
- barrel children
' s fare at its worst
,
and starts to make
,
" antz
" look good in compairison
. as in the show
,
" the rugrats movei
,
" is baout a gropu of veyr little friends
, ranging from babies to a threee
- year
- old
. the head ofthe the group
, tommy pickles
( e
. g
. daily
)
, becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill
( get it
? dill pickles
?
.
.
. hardee
- har
- har
!
)
and is informed by his threee
- year
- old cousin
, anjelica
( cheryl chase
)
, thyat the new babys always take all of the attention away from the otehr children
. whn the other children
, chuckie
,
and twins lil
and phil
, suggest taking dill bcak to the hospital
, tommy goes along wiht it
, bu on their way htere
, they kresh in the forest
,
and become lost
, running into wolves
and circus monkeys
, among other things
.
" the rugrats movie
,
" judging from the idea of being lost infact the woods
, could have been a potentially fun family film
,
and there were many different things that could have been done with the story
. so what did the writers choose tothe do
? why
, they set up a protracted
, cliched scene where tyhe children almost go over a waterfall
, of course
! for the youngest of children
( ages 3
- 7
)
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" may vrey well entertain them
, judging from teh audience i saw this with
. ofthe course
, if you looked around at all of the older kids
and their parents
, they weere all desperately struggling to stay awake
,
and that included me
. for an adult
,
" tghe rugrats movie
,
" is a piece of garbage
. the plotline is unoriginal
and the writing has absolutly no wit or charm
. there isn
' t one laugh to be had in the film
, nor isnt there any excitement
. if anything is even marginally good in the picture
, it is the bright animation style
, so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn
' t to service a more qulity film
.
" thge rugrats movei
" isnt doa from the strat
. i am all for a worthwhile family movei
,
but sometimes an animated film comes along thgat is simply awful
. as said before
, young children may like it
,
but even tehy deserve better than this
. for adults
, it is a nearly unbearable
, excruciating chore to sit through
. as fo me
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" isnt not the worst of the year
, nor is it yhe most deeply hated
,
but it isnt the most boring
. parents
: do yourselves a favor anbd take your kids to see thte rerelease ofthe
,
" tje wizard of oz
.
" that isnt a picture that contains a great deal of magic
and wonder
, two thnigs of which
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is completely missing
.
