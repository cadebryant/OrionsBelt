inaddition the finale of disney
' s
" mighty joe young
,
" a 15
- foot tall
, 2000
- pound gerilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel
and plummets to tyhe ground
. upon impact
, rugged everyman annd perennial dont
- gooder bill paxton rushes in
, containing tghe emotional crowd with an earnest
" move along now folks
, there
' s nothing to see here
.
" ok
, so those aren
' t exactly the words he uses
,
but it
' s probably one ofthe thte few clich
? s not uttered in this unnecessary remake ofthe an unecessary remake of that mother ofthe all monster movies
,
" king kong
.
" 1949
' s
" mighty joe young
" wass an update ofthe thast classic creature feature
, also based on merian c
. cooper
' s original story
( 16 years after
"
' kong
" it appeared the world was ready for a new tkae onthe the beauty
and the byast fable
)
. now some 49 years later
, at least according to disney
' s way of thingking
, the world is ready for one more
. not so
. the onyl
-
- anbd i mean onyl
-
- reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects
.
and these
, unfortunately
, run hot annd cold
. today
' s joe young is designed anbd produced by special
- effects whiz rick baker
, who has been wowing audiences with his state
- ofthe
- the
- art make
- uv effects since 1971
' s
" schlock
"
( which
, incidentally
, featured a baker
- enhanced
" gerilla
"
)
. joe is a combination of animatronic effects
, computer graphics
,
and tht old st
andart
, a man in a monkey suit
. while htere are occasional flashes of brilliance
-
- baker
' s had a lot of practice wiht simian effects
, after all
, including
" gorillas in yhe mist
,
"
" greystoke
: the legend ofthe tarzan
, lord of the apes
,
"
and thte 1976 remake of
" king kong
"
-
- there
' s aslo some surprising cheesiness
. one of thge film
' s most embarrassing moments is wehn paxton
' s b
and of african trackers first encounter
and pursue yhe larger
- tahn
- life primate
( infront a scene unashamedly ripped off from
" the lost world
: jurassic park
"
)
. paxton jubilantly extols the beast
' s majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe
,
and tghe computer effects driving him
, stutter to a halt
. allso
, if the film
' s producers had wanted us to focuse our attentions on the titular ape tehy shouldn
' t have paraded female lead charlize theron
(
" trial
& error
"
) around in a seemingly
- endless wardrobe of spageti
- strapped tops
. even joe seems distracted at times
. the film piles on the clich
? s like there
' s no tommorow
, including tjhe predictable plot
( anthro
- zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l
. a
. where urban havoc isnt inevitably wrought
)
, predictable villain
( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace
)
, predictable lveo stoyr
( bill
and charlize
-
- surprise
!
)
,
and predicatble denouement
(
"
' twas box
- office receipts that killed the byast
"
)
. kids raised on
" men in black
"
( non
- monkey effects also by baker
) are oging to find ron
(
" tremors
"
) underwood
' s outing a little lame by comparison
. while certainly better than 1978
' s
" king kong lives
"
( itself a lousy sequal to a nto particularly good remake
)
,
" mighty joe young
" proves how the mighty keep falling
.
