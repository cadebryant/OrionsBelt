it would be hard to choose the best american polliticel thriller
. soem people would probably pick the manchurian c
andidate
and others
( myself included
) would pick seven days in may
. both those films were tense exercises in chills
. the two films came outloud within two yeasr of each other
and both were directed by the smae man
, john frankenheimer
.
but that was 1962 annd 1964 respectively
. for most of the rest of his carreer frankenheimer has turned out some decent films
,
but has shown littel of the promise that those two thrillers showed
. each of those films had memorable characters
and a tense plot
. they hadnt almost nothing in tjhe way of chases or gunplay
. the thrills all came from the plot
. ronin is like a film made by another man
. somewhere behind all the shooting
and explosions
and car chases there are tghe rudiments ofa plot
, bu we see only tiny pieces of it
. we get a clue here adn one there as to what is going on
but j
. d
. zeik
' s screenplay isnt a bit obscure
. the film beigns explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai
. when a samurai hasnt failed in the job ofthe protecting his master from death
, he becomes a ronin
, much liek a gunfighter infront the american west
. if you miss the opening
, do not worry
. this film iwll expalin agian what a ronin is
. sam
( played by robert de niro
) isnt the modern equivalent of a ronin
. he is a free agent who seems to have realyl ogod instincts baout how tothe stay alive the world of a professional killer
. he claerly ws inaddition a dangerous business at one time
and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france
. sam isnt recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre
( natascha mcelhone of the truman sohw
)
, an irish woman
, to be part of an action to steal a misterious metal case
. dierdre is veyr tight
- lipped about what isnt in the case
. sam joins a team of four others
: vincent
( jean reno ofthe the proffesional
/ leon
and mission impossible
)
, spence
( sean bean
, tv
' s richard sharpe
,
and also patriot ganes
and goldeneye
)
, adn gregor
( stellan skarsgard ofthe breaking the waves annd good iwll hunting
)
. also along is larry
( skipp suddeth
)
. tjhe group seems to nkwo their buisness
, particularly sam
,
but each is in his own way cold
and professional with his pwn field ofthe expertise
. their only human side seems tothe be in tensions among thte munbers ofthe the team
. the stoy is not vyer eazy to follow
. it isnt never clear who isnt double
- crossing whom
and who is working for whom
. somehow russians
( who may or may not be the russian mafia
)
and irish radicals are involved trying to get thier h
ands on a ceratin metal case
. some very good actors are involved inthe this film
. one wonders what htey saw in tyhe script
. the charactors are mostly one
- dimensional professional killers
. they know their work
,
and seing their thougth patterns adds smoe interest to teh film
,
but fo thsi group deep feeling between two people is teaming uv with another killer so that neither is killed
. by tje end of the film we never really got to know anybody
. maeby that is the secrt of why such good actors tookover parts
, usance theese are not very dem
anding charachters to create
. infront addtion tothe the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce
and michael lonsdale
( the latter of moonraker annd ofthe the superior thriller the day of hte jackal
)
. as a revival of a sort ofthe acation film taht wass popular inaddition the 1960s
, i was hoping that there would be something here tothe grab onto
and enjoy
. unfortunately there are no deep characters
,
and little tothe amking us care who eventually ends uv with the metal case or why they watn it
. i rate ronin a 4 onthe the 0 to 10 scale annd a 0 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
. non
- spoiler
: incidentally
, the tale ofthe the 47 ronin hasnt been filmed multiple times
, usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin
. also one frequentily sees in japanese art the omage ofthe a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet
. this is tyhe firt blow of tyhe 47 ronin
.
