it would be hard to choose thte best american poltical thriller
. some people would probably pick tghe manchurian candidate
and others
( mysef included
) would pick seven days in may
. both thsoe films were tense exercises in chills
. the two films came out within two years ofthe each other
and both were directed by tje same man
, john frankenheimer
.
but that was 1962
and 1964 respectively
. for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out smoe decent films
,
bu hasnt shown little ofthe the promise tht thsoe twpo thrillers showed
. eahc ofthe those films had memorable characters
adn a tense plot
. they hadnt almost nothing in teh way of chases or gunplay
. tje thrills all cameback fomr tyhe plot
. ronin is liek a film made by anyother man
. somewhere behind all the shooting
anbd explosions
and car chases there are thte rudiments ofa plot
,
but we see only tiny pieces ofthe it
. we get a clue here
and one ther as to whta is going on
but j
. d
. zeik ' s screenplay isnt a bit obscure
. the film beigns explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai
. when a samurai hasnt failed inwhich the job ofthe protecting his master from death
, he becomes a ronin
, much like a gunfighter in the american west
. if you miss the opening
, do not worry
. this film will explain again what a ronin is
. sam
( plyed by robert de niro
) is thge modern equivalent of a ronin
. he is a free agent who seems to hvea really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer
. he clearly ws in a dangerous buisness at one tiem
and nowe he seems tothe be drifting around on his own somewhere in france
. sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre
( natascha mcelhone ofthe the truman show
)
, an irish woman
, to be part of an action to steal a misterious metal case
. dierdre is very tight
- lipped about what is inthe thge case
. sam joins a team of four others
: vincent
( jean reno of the professional
/ leon
and mission impossible
)
, spence
( sean bean
, tv ' s richard sharpe
,
and also patriot games
and goldeneye
)
,
and gregor
( stellan skarsgard ofthe breaking the waves
and ogod will hunting
)
. also along isnt larry
( skipp suddeth
)
. the group seems to know theri business
, particularly sam
,
bu eahc is in his own way cold
and professional whith his pwn field of expertise
. their only human side seems tothe be in tensions among the munbers of the team
. the story is not very easy to follow
. it is never clear who is double
- crossing whom
anbd who is wroking for whom
. somehow russians
( who may or may not be the russion mafia
)
anbd irish radicals are involved trying to get theri hands onthe a ceratin metal case
. smoe very good actors are involved in this film
. one wonders what they saw infront the script
. the charactors are mostly one
- dimensional professional killers
. they know their wrok
,
and seeing theri thought patterns adds smoe interest tothe the film
,
but forthe this gropu deep feeling between twpo peopel isnt teaming up wiht anyother killer so thyat niether isnt killed
. by the end ofthe the film we never really got tothe know anybody
. maybe that isnt hte secret of why such good actors took parts
, since these are not very demanding characters to create
. inthe adition tothe the above characters the film allso features jonathan pryce
adn michael lonsdale
( the latter of moonraker
and ofthe yhe superior thriller the day of the jackal
)
. as a revival of a sort of acation film that was popular in the 1960s
, i was hoping that ther owudl be something here to grab onto
annd enjoy
. unfortunately there are no deepo cahracters
,
and littel to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it
. i rate ronin a 4 onthe the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 onthe the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
. non
- spoiler
: incidentally
, thge tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times
, usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin
. also noe frequently sees in japanese art tyhe image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet
. this isnt the first blow of yhe 47 ronin
.
