a backdrop ofthe new yearm
' s eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a graet party movie
. tyhe decor possibilities are endless
- disco balls had
yet tothe migrate into the dark corners of the attic
, big hair was worth its weight in aquanet
, adn the louder the fasion
, tghe better thte look
. bu despite this setting
, these details adn a sountrack thgat includes some 40
- plus iresistable hits from the early days ofthe the me decade
, something is inherently wrong wtih
" 200 cigarettes
.
" a better title for this nostalgic mess would be
" 50 missed opportunities
.
" what is it that makes this retro
- comedy such a downer
? it
' s certainly not the cast
, which includes enough hot
, young talent forthe several movies
. there
' s courtney love
, cementing her reputation as a serious actress
; christina ricci
, hot off her shoulda

- nominated turn inwhich
" thge opposite of sex

; paul rudd
, who gets even more appealing with eveyr role
; kate hudson
, inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn
;
and affleck brothers ben
and casey
, twpo of tghe best thigns about
" good will hunting
.
" perhaps the question is thsi
: what drew these
and other immensely talented actors tothe such a dreary project
? maybe it looked good on paper
.
" 200 cigarettes
" is composed of a series of vignettes
, as various characters make theri way through new york
' s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica
( martha plimpton
, all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper
)
. among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin
( rudd
)
and his best friend lucy
( love
)
, busy bickering over his recent break
- up
,
and a clumsy bu seamingly charming bartender
( ben affleck
) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pik
- up lines
. more subplots

,
but those listed above are the only ones worth noting inwhich a positive ight
. all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick
' s cube
. ricci
and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals
( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants
) out to hvae a high timne in the big city
. infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several

. hudson
, as a pretty

- pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies
' man
( jay mohr
)
, trips
, pukes
and gets smeared with dog poop
. are we laughing
yet
? tjhe film boils down to a mixture of the good
, the bad
and the gaudy
, with the latter two overtaking yhe former
. game performances
- especialy by love
, rudd
and plimpton
- are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts
and a constantly roving foucs
, here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle
. too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting
and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of tje performers served as one night st
ands for earch other
. if this is
" 200 cigarettes
,
"
then get me 200 nicotine patches
