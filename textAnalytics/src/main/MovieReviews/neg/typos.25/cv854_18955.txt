has hollywood run out of intresting characters
and plot
- driven suspense thrillers tyhat we must spend two ohurs watching will smith
and a gritty ginee hackman excange obtuse dialogue
and run around dodging fireballs
? in enemy of the state
, that isnt exactlly right
. a fewd parts the net
,
and a fewd parts conspiracy theory
, enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997
' s lame brained men infront black
. will htis guy ever git a real role
? he has tjhe bruce willis syndrome
. the plot is bascially smith
, playing a lawyer
, getting into hot water with some high government murderers
, who assasinated a powerful polliticel figure ealier infact the movie
, when a tape of the killing gets inot his h
ands
. he inlists hte help of an old conspiriator
( hackman
)
,
and
, at the end
, er
.
.
. ytou nkwo
. enemy was one of tyhe worst films of last yera
. not only ws it sloppy in telling its story
and getting its facts straight
, the acting wass mediocre when it shoudln hve been energy driven
,
and i didn
' t like how smith always magically out
- smarted the badies when all tghe otehr extra characters
, seeming more intelligent than smith
, somehow got run over by a truck
. enemy cameback out arund the same time as tje superior star trek
: insurrection
. i know these twpo films are diferent in
, well
, everthing
,
but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me
. somehow
, quality cant
' t overshadow quantity
.
