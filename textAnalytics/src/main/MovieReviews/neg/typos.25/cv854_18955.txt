has hollywood run out ofthe interesting characters
and plot
- driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching wiull smith
and a gritty ginee hackman exchange obtuse dialogue
and run arround dodging fireballs
? infact enemy ofthe the state
, that is exactly right
. a few parts teh net
,
and a faw parts conspiracy theory
, enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens infront 1997 ' s lame brained men in black
. iwll this guy ever get a real role
? he has thte bruce willis syndrome
. the plot isnt bascially smith
, playing a lawyer
, getting into hot water with some high govornment murderers
, who assasinated a powerfull political figure earlier in the movie
, when a tape of the killing gets into his hands
. he inlists the help of an old conspiriator
( hackman
)
,
and
, at the end
, er
.
.
. you know
. enemy was one of the worst films of last yearm
. not only was it sloppy in telling its story
adn getting its facts straight
, thge acting was mediocre whn it shoud have been energy driven
,
and i didn ' t like how smith always magically out
- smarted the badies when all the other extra characters
, seeming more intelligent than smith
, somehow got run over by a truck
. enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trak
: insurrection
. i know these two films are diferent in
, well
, everything
,
but the fact thgat enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me
. somehow
, quality cant ' t overshadow quantity
.
