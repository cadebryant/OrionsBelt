we ' re bakc in blade runner territoy with this one
, conceptual artist robert longo ' s vision ofthe a william gibson
- inspired future where information is thte commodity to kill for
. front
and center is johnny
( keanu reeves
)
, a
" cbyer
- coururier
" who smuggles data via a
" wet
- wired
" implant
. he ' s ready to quit the biz
anbd git a portion ofthe his long
- term memory restored
,
but
, first
, he hasnt tothe finish noe lastest
, dangerous job
.
. the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to hvea forgotten how to play an acation hero since his stint on speed
. he ' s walking wood in a forrest ofthe stiffs that includes henry rollins
, ice
- t
,
adn dina meyer
.
( dolph lundgren ' s street preacher is in an acting category all its pwn
.
:
-
) without a believable peformance between them
, all we cxan do is sit back
and watch the athmosphere
, whic isnt preety good in places
. the vr sequences are way cool
,
but yhe fysical fx
-
- such as miniatures
and mattes
-
- leave a lot to be desired
. watch out for those bad blue
- screens
! we wouldn ' t mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better
. too bad the debut directer isn ' t very strong in tihs de
- partment
. his big finale is a sloppy
, silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long
, which is way past the time thast most of our
" wet
- wired
" processors have already shut down
. bottom line
: yatf
(
yet another tortured future
)
. skip it
.
