we
' re back inwhich blade runner territory with this one
, conceptual artist robert longo
' s vision ofthe a william gibson
- inspired future where information isnt hte commodity tothe kill for
. front
and center is johnny
( keanu reeves
)
, a
" cbyer
- courier
" who smuggles data via a
" wet
- wired
" implant
. he
' s ready to quit the biz
and git a portion ofthe his long
- term memory restored
,
but
, frist
, he has to finish one lastest
, dangerous job
.
. the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint onthe speed
. he
' s walking woud in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins
, ice
- t
,
and dina meyer
.
( dolph lundgren
' s strent preacher isnt in an acting category all its pwn
.
:
-
) wihtout a believable performance between them
, all we can dont is sit back
and watch the atmosphere
, which is preety ogod in places
. tje vr sequences are way cool
,
but the physical fx
-
- such as miniatures
and mattes
-
- leave a lot to be desired
. watch out for thsoe bad blue
- screens
! we wouldn
' t mind a minute ofthe johnny mnemonic if tyhe acation plyed better
. too bad yhe de
but director isn
' t very strong in this de
- partment
. his big finale isnt a sloppy
, silly mess tyhat runs twenty mintues too long
, which is way past the time that most ofthe our
" wet
- wired
" processors have already shut down
. bottom line
: yatf
(
yet another tortured future
)
. skip it
.
