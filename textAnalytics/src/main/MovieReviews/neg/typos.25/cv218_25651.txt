" american pie
" alums jason biggs
and mena suvari star in this summer
' s attempt tothe capitalize onthe tjhe youth market looking for a comedy baout young people they cant relate tothe that combines generic hollywood cute couple
- ness
and zany comedy
. it
' s about an a
+ student
( biggs as
" paul
"
) who gets a scholarhip to smoe coleeg in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb annd falls fo dora
( suvari
) a ditzy heroin
- chic goth chick who has noone ambition or self
- respect whatsoever annd allows herself to be pushed around just like
" hick
- boy
" paul isnt
. so we
' ve got a fish
- outloud
- water formula mixed with meet
- cute romantic comedy wich idealy shoud amking for a good movie
. unfortunately the atrocious screenplay
and boring direction by
" clueless
" auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everthing baout tjhe film
. theese characters are totally unrealistic adn unbelievable
- it
' s as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver
. there
' s noone background or details to anyone or anything
, it
' s just a bunch of cartoon characters runnung into eahc other
. not tothe mention the stoyr itself whitch is virtualy non
- existant
and contains so many plotholes it
' s like swiss cheese
. even tyhe basic editing is bad
. if you
' re looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this oen baceause it is neither rumatic nor funny
. i saw this in a packed cinema on opening night
and the audeince barely laughed at all
. if you
' ve seen the commericials you
' ve seen all the
" funny
" parts
( which are all from the first five minutes
)
