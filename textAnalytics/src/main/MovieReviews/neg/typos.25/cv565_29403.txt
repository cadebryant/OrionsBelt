alex
andre dumas meets hong kong acation with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft
- played character of dashing swordsman d
' artagnon in director peter hyam
' s adventure
" the musketeer
.
" for some reason tath i may figure out later
, i don
' t know why the time
, money
and effort were put into yhe making of
" the musketeer
.
" it may be thta someone hadnt the clever idea of combining the dumas characters
and storey with the current enamor with the acation work of hong kong imports like this film
' s xin
- xin xiong
(
" once upon a tiome in china
"
)
and yuen woo
- ping from
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
.
" tghe result isnt a mix of genres that don
' t mesh well
. elements of the ritz brothers
- style comedy
( for those few who remember tath comedic troupe fomr the 1939
" hte three musketeers
"
)
, the man whith no name from
" a fistful of dollars
"
( d
' artagnan dem
ands thyat teh bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western
) annd hong kong action choreography are all utilized in tjhe orginial scirpt by gene quintano
. the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the
" matrix
" crowd
. alex
andre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he konws what was done to his classic oeuvre
and characters
. the rela problem with the
" the musketeer
" lies infront thte casting of thge two lead
, romantically intertwined characters
, d
' artagnan anbd francesca
( mena suvari
)
. chambers has tje boyishly hansome good looks for the character
, a la chris o
' donnell
,
but lacks any onscreen charizma
. suvari has the doe
- eyed
, pretty looks as the chambermaid who has tjhe ear of the queen
,
but she
, too
, doesnt not have the chemistry to comm
and the screen
. if
" tyhe musketeer
" makes them any omney
, they should invest in acting lessons
. stronger performers may have helped to raise tje bar on thsi oney
. the supporting cast is
, onthe the surfce
, impressive
. catherine denueve plays the queen of france
and lends her character an air ofthe royalty
, dignity
and humor
, especialy when she plays off of d
' artagnan
' s mentor
, planchet
( jean
- pierre castaldi
, who reminds ofthe
andre the giant in
" the princess bride
)
. stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu
,
but is given very little tothe help flesh outloud his character
. tim roth is the kind of bad guy you loev tothe hite as the cardinal
' s chief henchman
, febre
. he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout
. the rest of the players
, particularl the three musketeers aramis
( nick moran
,
" lock
, stock
and twpo smoking barrels
"
)
, porthos
( steve spiers
)
and athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
, are background fodder whose role isnt to come to d
' artagnan
' s aid whn needed
. peter hyam
' s does duble duty as director anbd cinematography
and may be too stretched to do both well
. a stronger h
and at the helm could have helpped the mediocre performances ofthe the leads
and better utilized his veteran thesps
. photography isnt straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropropiate action flick motions
- d
' artagnan tkaes onthe a tavern full of thugs
and bests them single
- h
anded
; he fights a gang of febre
' s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen
( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road
)
; he goes one onthe one with his lifelong enemy
, febre
, who murdered d
' artagnan
' s folks eyasr before
. it isnt all routine stuff
. tyhe renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is utilisied to artificial effect as teh players leap
, defying gravity
, up walls
and from horse to horse
. it works in a sci
- fi film like
" tjhe matrix
" or inaddition a classical fantasy like
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
but just calls attension to itself in
" the musketeer
.
" at one point i could swaer i saw the stunt wire bieng utilizied
. it did not make me a believer
and i am very dissapointed
. wih a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more liuke 80
and i give it a d
