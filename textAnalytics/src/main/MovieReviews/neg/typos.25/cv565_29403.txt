alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft
- played character of dashing swordsman d ' artagnon in director peter hyam ' s adventure
" the musketeer
.
" fo soem reason thta i may figure out later
, i don ' t know why the timne
, money
and affort were put inot thte making of
" the musketeer
.
" it may be that somone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters
and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like thsi film ' s xin
- xin xiong
(
" once apon a time in china
"
)
and yuen woo
- ping from
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
.
" the result is a mix of genres that don ' t mesh well
. elements of the ritz brothers
- style comedy
( fo those fewd who rember that commedic troupe from the 1939
" tyhe three musketeers
"
)
, the man with no nmae from
" a fistful of dollars
"
( d ' artagnan demands that the bad guys apologiez to his horse inaddition a direct ref to tyhe clint eastwood spaghetti western
)
adn hong kong action choreography are all utilized infact the original script by ginee quintano
. the result isnt an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary thyat material in an effort tothe grab the
" matrix
" crowd
. alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done tothe his clasic ouevre
anbd characters
. the real probelm with the
" the musketeer
" lies infact hte casting of the two lead
, romantically intertwined charactors
, d ' artagnan
and francesca
( mena suvari
)
. chambers hasnt the boyishly handsome good looks forthe the character
, a la chris o ' donnell
,
but lacks any onscreen charisma
. suvari has the doe
- eyed
, pretty looks as yhe chambermaid who has hte ear of the queen
,
but she
, too
, does nto have the chemistry tothe command the screen
. if
" the musketeer
" makse them any monye
, they should invest in acting lessons
. stronger performers may ahev helpped to raise the bar onthe this one
. tghe supporting cast is
, on the surface
, impressive
. catherine denueve plays the queen ofthe france
and lends her character an air of royalty
, dignity
and humor
, especially when she plays off of d ' artagnan ' s mentor
, planchet
( jean
- pierre castaldi
, who reminds ofthe andre the giant in
" the princess bride
)
. stephen rea looks ogod in the part ofthe the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu
,
bu is given very little to help flesh out his character
. tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal ' s cheif henchman
, febre
. he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout
. the rest of hte players
, particularly the three musketeers aramis
( nick moran
,
" lock
, stock
and two smoking barrels
"
)
, porthos
( steve spiers
)
and athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
, are background fodder whose role isnt tothe come to d ' artagnan ' s aid whn needed
. peter hyam ' s does double duty as director
anbd cinematography
and may be too stretched tothe do both well
. a stronger hand at the helm coudl have helped the medicore performances ofthe the leads
adn better utilized his veteran thesps
. photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions
- d ' artagnan tkaes on a tavern full of thugs
and bests them single
- handed
; he fights a gang ofthe febre ' s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen
( with the obligatory branches hanging over tyhe road
)
; he goes one on oen with his lifelong enemy
, febre
, who murdered d ' artagnan ' s folks years before
. it is all routine stuff
. the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters isnt used to artificial effect as the players leap
, defying gravity
, up walls
and from horse to horse
. it works in a sci
- fi film liuke
" the matrix
" or in a classical fantasy like
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
but just calls attention to itself in
" hte musketeer
.
" at oen point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used
. it doed nto amking me a believer
and i am very disappointed
. with a run time ofthe 106 minutes it shouldnt have been more like 80
annd i give it a d
