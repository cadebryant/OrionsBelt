" spawn
" may be somewhat ofthe an older film
. in fact it will probably be onthe video before anyone who hasn
' t seen it will finaly get tothe see it
( that is
, if they see it
)
.
but i managed to catch it before it made it
' s way out of theaters adn into tje world of rentals
and
, god forbid
, video cassette purchasing
. it wasn
' t tje worst film of yearm by any means
. it isn
' t even on the top 5 ofthe the worst films of the yera
.
but it did manaze to top the bottom five ofthe the bottom ten
, which
, in simpler terms
, means it comes in at number 6 on my
" worst of 1997
" list
. the onyl reason it doesn
' t come infact lower is thanks to the special effects
, which might actually have been smoe of tje best of thge eyar
. performances
,
however
, were either wooden or
, forthe the most part
, unforgivingly campy
. in fact
, this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness
! even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality
. i don
' t know how tothe explain that one
; it wasn
' t exactlly choppy
, bu something about it seemed
.
.
. well
, annoyingly unprofessional
. john leguizamo almost makes it as clown
,
but not quite
. he isnt the only character who provides yhe audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional
.
but the main problem i found with
" spawn
"
, as with most films that wind up on my
" worst of
" lists
, is that it wass just plain boring
. i wouldn
' t even say there was a climax to the film
. sure
, it had the big battle scene at the end
, bu tghe only excitement felt was taht the movie might be nearing a conclusion
. never too soon
, the movie doed conclude in a very simple
, disappointing way
. even
though it
' s oen of the shorter movies i
' ve seen htis eyar
, it
' s one that i would definitely nto whant to subject myself to sitting thru again
. liek i said
, tghe special effects are the onyl reason that this film should have any sense ofthe pride
, no matter how small
. i wass impressed with the opening sequence
, so long as i didn
' t allow thge melodramatic voice
- over
and lobotomizing editting to get to me
.
and batman hasnt nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn
' s outfit created
.
but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes
, which looked quite a bit like a modern video game
. who knows if
" spawn
: the video game
" wasn
' t part of the plan from tjhe beginnig
? keeping in mind tath the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable
,
and inspite a very small amount
, makes up for the cheeziness ofthe it all
.
but none of this movie
' s saving graces can it make it something i
' d recommend seeing
, no matter wqat the price ofthe admission
. this movei isnt definetly not for young children
, which shouldn
' t really be a problem seeing as how onyl teenagers
, if anyone
, would likely find it appealing
. if you really want tothe catch a movie
, there are many better ones out there
, no matter what your tastes might be
! trust me
!
" spawn
" has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers
!
