" spawn
" may be somewhat of an older film
. in fact it will probably be onthe video before anyone who hasn ' t seen it iwll fianlly get to see it
( thyat is
, if they see it
)
.
but i managed to catch it before it made it ' s way out of theaters
and into the world of rentals
and
, god forbid
, video cassete puchasing
. it wasn ' t tjhe worst film of year by any means
. it isn ' t even on the top 5 of tghe worst films of the year
.
but it did manage tothe top tje bottom five ofthe the bottom ten
, which
, in simplier terms
, means it comes inwhich at number 6 on my
" worst of 1997
" list
. teh only reason it doesn ' t cmo in lower is thanks to teh spacial effects
, whic might actaully have beeen some of tyhe best of the yera
. performances
,
however
, weere either wooden or
, forthe teh most part
, unforgivingly campy
. in fatc
, tihs film shows no signs ofthe attempting to avoid campiness
! even the editing seemed to boast a campy qualty
. i don ' t know how to explain that one
; it wasn ' t exactly choppy
,
but something baout it seemed
.
.
. well
, annoyingly unprofessional
. john leguizamo almsot mkaes it as clown
,
but not quite
. he is the only character who provides yhe audeince with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional
.
but the main problem i foudn whith
" spawn
"
, as with most films taht wind uv on my
" worst of
" lists
, is that it was just plain boring
. i wouldn ' t even sday there was a climax to the film
. sure
, it hadnt the big battle scene at the end
,
but the onyl excitment felt ws that thge movie might be nearing a conclusion
. never too soon
, the movie did conclude in a very simple
, disapointing way
. even
though it ' s one of the shorter movies i ' ve seen this yearm
, it ' s one tath i woudl definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again
. like i said
, teh special effects are the only reason that this film should haev any sense of pride
, no marter how small
. i was impressed withthe the opening sequence
, so long as i didn ' t allow the melodramatic voice
- over
and lobotomizing editing tothe get to me
.
and batman hasnt nothing on thte spectacular visuals spawn ' s outfit created
.
bu even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes
, which looked quite a bit liuke a modern video game
. who knows if
" spawn
: the video game
" wasn ' t part ofthe thge plan ffrom thte beginning
? keeping in mind that the film was based onthe a comic book makse it somewhat more approachable
,
anbd in a very small ammount
, makes uv for the cheeziness of it all
.
but none ofthe this movie ' s saveing graces can it amke it something i ' d recommend seeing
, no matter what tghe price of admission
. htis movie isnt definitely not for young children
, whihc shouldn ' t really be a problem seing as how only teenagers
, if anyone
, would likely fidn it appealing
. if you raelly want to catch a movie
, there are many better ones outloud there
, no matter what your tastes might be
! trust me
!
" spawn
" has very little tothe offer even the most avid moviegoers
!
