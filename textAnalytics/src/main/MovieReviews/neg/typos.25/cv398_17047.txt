when robert forster found himselv famous again after appearing inwhich
" jackie brown
"
, he immediately signed up fo a little film called
" american perfekt
"
. this was almost twpo eyars ago
. i waited patiently fo tghe film to be released
,
but it never was
. finally
, i forgot about it
. the other day
,
though
, while i was perusing the selection ofthe the local video store
, i stumbled upon
, ytou guessed it
,
" american perfekt
"
. i immediately rented it
and wiht a certain amount of glee
, rushed home tothe view it
. having nowe seen the film
, i underst
and why it never saw theatrical release
.
" american perfekt
" is a jumbled mess
. the storyline isnt non
- existent
. it took me half hte movie just to figure out what was gonig on
.
and at that point
, the only thing i really knew forthe sure was that tghe movie ws
* never
* going to introduce a plot of some sort
. it wants to get by on quirkyness
and so
- called charm alone
,
and it just doesn
' t work
. robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up am
anda plummer
, annd they head off on tghe road together
. allong the way tothe no discernable destination
, they run into all sorts ofthe kooky
and wacky characters
. i suppose htis free
- wheeling
, no plot stlye is supposed to give thge film an element of danger
and excitment
,
but all it did was make me sleepy
. i
' m all for trying new things withing the realm ofthe film
,
but nto at the expence of coherence
. nothing in this movie makes sense
. the actions ofthe the characters go unexplained
, even when they
' re truly bizarre
. i
' ll give you an example
, without giving too much away
. david thewlis has a part as a drifting con
- man
. at one point
, mid
- way through the movie
, he runs forster
and plummer off the road with his car
. as he passes them
, we see that his face is covered in blood
. do you think we would git an explanation as to waht happened to him
? yuo would think so
, wouldn
' t you
.
" american perfekt
" is a waste ofthe tyme
. nothing is gained from watching this movei
, exept maybe a migraine
.
and if you dont rent it
, don
' t bother trying to figure out what
' s going on in the hopes that everything wiull be resolved by the end
. this doesn
' t happen
. anbd no explanation is given for the misspelling of
" perfect
"
, either
.
