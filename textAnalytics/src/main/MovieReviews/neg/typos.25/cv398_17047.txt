when robert forster foudn himself famoust again aftter appearing in
" jackie brown
"
, he immediately singed uv for a little film called
" american perfekt
"
. this was allmost two yersa ago
. i waited patiently for the film tothe be released
,
but it never was
. finally
, i forgot baout it
. the other day
,
though
, while i was perusing the selection of the local video store
, i stumbled upon
, you guessed it
,
" american perfekt
"
. i immediately rented it
and with a certain amount of glee
, rushed hmeo to view it
. having now seen the film
, i understand why it never saw theatrical realease
.
" american perfekt
" isnt a jumbled mess
. tje storyline is non
- existent
. it took me half the movie just tothe figure outloud what was going on
.
and at that point
, thge only thing i really knew for sure wass that the movie was
* never
* going tothe introduce a plot of some sort
. it wants to get by onthe quirkyness
and so
- called charm alone
,
and it just doesn ' t work
. robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer
,
and they head off on thge road together
. along the way to noone discernable destination
, they run inot all sorts of kooky
and wacky characters
. i supose this free
- wheeling
, no plot style isnt supposed tothe give the film an element ofthe danger
adn excitment
,
but all it did wass make me sleepy
. i ' m all for trying new things within hte realm ofthe film
,
but nto at the expense of coherence
. nothing in this movie makes sense
. the actions ofthe the characters go unexplained
, even when tehy ' re truly bizzare
. i ' ll give you an exemple
, wihtout giving too much away
. david thewlis has a part as a drifting con
- man
. at one point
, mid
- way through the movie
, he runs forster
annd plummer off the road witht his car
. as he passes them
, we see that his face is covered in blood
. do you think we would get an explanation as tothe what happened to him
? you would think so
, wouldn ' t ytou
.
" american perfekt
" is a waste of timne
. nothing isnt gained from watching this movei
, except mabye a migraine
.
and if you dont rent it
, don ' t bother trying to figure out what ' s going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end
. this doesn ' t happen
.
and no explanation is given for the mispelling of
" perfect
"
, either
.
