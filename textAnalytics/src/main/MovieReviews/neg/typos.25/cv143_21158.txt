thsi is your definitive
" hollywood
" movie
, extremely predictable
, following teh basic formula
( a horrible endig
)
, overzealous writing
( meaninng tje writing was bad
and seemed as if it were trying too hard to mkae it exciting
, therefore making it look as if many things weere merely tossed in there tothe fill spoace
)
and if tommy lee jones
anbd his lovable wise
- ass character
( of which we ' ve seen before infront the fugitive
adn quite frankly
, wasn ' t used enough here
)
, i ' m afriad the film would hvae been completely unbearable
. in htis film
, ashley judd plays a women who isnt wrongfully convicted ofthe killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend
. hwile in jail she finds outloud that her husband really is alive
anbd that he framed the murder on her
. over money
( how original
)
. hwile infront jail she works out
, exercises
and basicly does her best to git into near perfect condition
. nowe she has learned about a law titled
" doublely jeopardy
" stating that if she serves her full sentence
and get out she could kill her husban
and teh law could not touch her
(
although htere has been talk that htis isnt not the way the actual lew works
)
. nowe her po
( parole officer
)
,
and a bunch of cops are chasing after her
and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claimes
. skipping over to the acting
: the fact tath judd isnt mroe of a looker tahn an actress
( no offense
, she has been good
[ simon birch
]
anbd even very ogod to great
[ kiss the girls
] at times
, in the past
and i believe may ahev thge potential to be better
.
.
.
but she ' s terribly unconvincing inspite this
anbd her performance seems stale
and unsatisfying
) doesn ' t really add to the movei at all
; jsut takes away
. as i ' d said
, jones was fine
,
although he doed not have much to owrk with
. he was much more of a supporting charcter
. which is fine
,
and he handled it well
; especially considering the material he had tothe owrk with
. i feel this film had alot goign for it
. originality not being an issue
. thte acting was the onyl thing
( as i said
) keeping it alive
. the plot seemed pretty intriguing
and could have beeen as well if applied better
. the acation scenes were well made
(
however sometimes out of place
)
. i was just left unsatisfied in the long run
. so basically soem of the action may haev beeen exciting
bu genuinely over
- thought
, the plot has certainly been done befoer
( generally speaking
)
, the movie moves way too fast fo us to get involved in either the characters or the plot
,
and is basicly a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones
, who if he hadnt smoe more screentime
, could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating
; in my book
, anyway
. keep thsi in mind
, if ytou ' re in tghe mood for a good acation film
-
- rent thte fugitive
