this isnt your definitive
" hollywood
" movie
, extremely predictable
, following the basic formula
( a horrible ending
)
, overzealous writing
( meaning hte writing was bad adn seemed as if it were trying too hard to mkea it exciting
, therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there tothe fill space
) adn if tommy lee jones
and his lovable wise
- ass character
( ofthe which we
' ve seen before in the fugitive
and quite frankly
, wasn
' t used anough here
)
, i
' m afraid the film would hvea been completely unbearable
. inwhich this film
, ashley judd plays a womens who isnt wrongfully convicted of killing her husb
and while outloud sailing for a weekend
. while in jail she finds outloud thyat her husb
and realyl is alive
and tht he framed the murder on her
. over money
( how original
)
. hwile infront jail she works out
, exercises adn basically doens her best to get inot near perfect condition
. nowe she has learned about a law titled
" double jeapardy
" stating that if she serves her full sentence
and git out she sould kill her husb
and annd hte law could not touch her
(
al
though there has been talk that tihs isnt not the way tje actual law works
)
. now her po
( parole officer
)
,
and a bunch of cops are chasing after her
and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims
. skipping over to the acting
: the fact that judd is moreso of a looker than an actress
( no offense
, she has been ogod
[ simon birch
] anbd even vrey ogod to great
[ kiss the girls
] at times
, in the past
and i believe may have the potential tothe be better
.
.
.
but she
' s terribly unconvincing in this
and her performance seems stale adn unsatisfying
) doesn
' t really add to the movie at all
; just tkaes away
. as i
' d said
, jones was fine
,
al
though he did not have much to owrk with
. he ws much more of a supporting character
. which is fine
, adn he h
andled it well
; especialy concidering the material he had to work wtih
. i feel thsi film hadnt alot going for it
. originality not bieng an issue
. the acting was the only thing
( as i said
) keeping it alive
. the plot seemed pretty intriguing
and coudl have been as well if applied better
. the acation scenes were well made
(
however sometimes out ofthe palce
)
. i wass just left unsatisfied in the long run
. so basicly some of the acation may have been exciting
but genuinely over
- throught
, hte plot has certainly been done befoer
( generally speaking
)
, tghe movie moves way too fast forthe us to get involved infront eather the characters or the plot
,
and isnt basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones
, who if he hadnt some more screentime
, could perhaps have earned yhe film a higer rating
; in my book
, anyway
. keep tihs infront mind
, if yuo
' re in the mood for a ogod acation film

- rent the fugitive
