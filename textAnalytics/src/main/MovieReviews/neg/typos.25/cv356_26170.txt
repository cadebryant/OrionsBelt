the summer of 00
' wasn
' t a very good one for devout cinephiles
. it offred no blair witches or sixth senses
; the best big budget hollywood could dont ws an efficient x
- men adaptation
and a flawed
but intertaining shaft update
. nurse betty signals the inofficial end ofthe that dreadful summer movie season anbd yhe commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season
, thast battery
- charging
( at least for critics who have tothe sit through every piece o
' shit tht moseys into multiplexes
) time ofthe year when all thsoe oscar contenders
( read
:
" uqality
" films
) compeet for audiences
. alas betty has hte dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season
. it
' s also indie director neil la
bute
' s first attempt at something ressembling a mainstream picture
,
and i
' m sad to report it
' s a resounding failure
( at least on this web site
)
, a mess that
' s as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused la
bute
' s previvous films ofthe being unrelentingly masochistic
. i went inthe expecting something decent
, forthe betty was gleefully praised
, it
' s screenplay even winning an award at cannes
,
but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment
. are critics so desperate for something unique that they
' re blind to how derivitive the particular br
and of
" uniqueness
" betty dolls out is
? for the first tiem la
bute is wokring from a scirpt he has not writed
,
and he seems unsure of how to h
andle the material
. betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction
( tihs is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright
and articulate hitted men
)
, enchanting like the wizard ofthe oz
( of wich htis film makes several allusions to
)
and heartwarming like
[ stick in your favorite loveable misfit movei
]
, bu by the end it left me cold with its calculated despiration
. it
' s la
bute
' s half hearted attempt tothe make a crowd pleaser
and he doesn
' t even seem to hvae half tht heart in it
. nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict
, betty
( brilliantly played by renee zellweger
)
, who witnesses the killing of her husb
and
, del
( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husb
and since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife
) by two hit men
( morgan freeman
and chris rock
)
. she happens to hvae her most beloved soap onthe in the background
and somehow merges tje twpo realities
. she
' s blocked out her husban
' s death
and thinks she
' s a character in her favorite soap
, a reason to love
. betty sets out on tghe road to la
( with smoe drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk
) searching for her soap boyfriend dr
. david ravell
( greg kinnear
) while the two bickering hitted men follow in nto so close persuit
. the la
bute who birthed the extraordinary in the comapany of men
, slipped a bit
(
but not much
) wih his sophomore effort
, your firends
and neighbors
,
then fell straight on his ass with bash
, a play he penned tyhat was recently aired on showtime
. thte play demonstrated noone forward movement as an artist
, only la
bute
' s persistence inthe wallowing in yhe horrid thnigs
" average
" peple do to each other
, usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are
. iin tghe play
, paul rudd
, as an obnoxious jock
, delivers a monologue detailing how he once folowed a gay man into a bathroom
and beat him mabye tothe death
, while his clueless girlfriend essentialy regards his sadistic behaviors as something allong the old maxim
" boys iwll be boys
"
. another character
, schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his pwn baby
! what was once so powerful about la
bute
' s work
, the casual
, nonchalant cruelty
and selfishness
( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree
) had become so over tyhe top it wass borderline comic
. obviously
, at this point
, la
bute could ule a dose of some diferent kind of material before he pidgeon holes himself futher
, bu nurse betty isn
' t it
. he clearly has little passion for what he
' s doing here
, instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks
( one of thte hitted men is a huge soap fan
, anbd yhe chracter of betty would be little more tahn a oen joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn
' t managed to transcend that
) tailor made tothe appeal to teh widest possible audience
. nearly eveyr scene vetween chris rock anbd morgan freeman fatally slows thte picture down
, as the two are made to inact soft
- boiled tarantino
- esque dialogue
. they evince littel chemestry
, with rock constantly inspite over tje top rant mode
, acting more liuke an angry comic thna any thing resembling a hit man
( an occupation thyat
' s represented far too frequentily infact movies nowadays
)
. i think rock is a great comic
yet he hasn
' t beeen able to bring his feral intelligence to movies
, whenever he acts
,
and no matter the part
, it
' s like he
' s doign the damn chris rock show
. surprisingly
( at least concidering her work inwhich me
, myself
and irene
) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance
, building onthe her baby faced
, apple pie looks
. that wide
- open face anbd helium voiced earnestness suggests a littel girl not fully grown into her thirty
- year
- old body
. it
' s the best work she
' s ever done
. freeman is effective as allways
,
though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where thge movie wants to take it
. the acto plays tjhe role in his usual calm
, collected manner
,
though the flick tries to incinuate a symbolic kinship between his carachter
and betty
' s
, suggesting tht both are controlled by their fantasies rether than reality
. that
' s interesting
but the movie doesn
' t do anything with it other than crash l
and the sub
- theme inot a labored speech in tghe midst of a badly staged gun battle
. the film has good moments
( many ofthe the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear
, especially his confrontation with zellweger
)
, an almost soothing
, lyrical score
(
and yuo know a movei
' s in trouble when the socre sticks outloud as one of hte best things about it
)
but nothing jells
, it
' s parts
, good or bad
, are so disparate as tothe be opposing
. the film might ahve worked had it settled on being one type of film
, a mainstream
, female forrest gump or an oddball art film
,
but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke
. betty
' s screenplay makes the misteek of relying too much on concurrence
, without which betty wouldn
' t make any progress in the film
. nurse betty is a film driven by coinsidence rether tahn charter
, like how betty becomes a nurse infront yhe film
, a job that she tkaes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover
; she happens to be at tghe hospital at tjhe exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place
and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim
' s wound because she happened to see how onthe tv
, which leads to her being offered a room with the victim
' s girlfriend who eventially gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear
?
?
? a little too tidy
, don
' tcha tihkn
. betty has an interesting theme
,
though it doesn
' t even seem aware ofthe this
. the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television waht with the enormass succes of survivor
and moderate success ofthe big brother
, wiht mroe onthe the way
. htis is a film about a women so deluded as tothe think that her favorite soap opera is reality
( ironically rela
- life survivor sean kennif has tooked a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light
)
. instead ofthe exploring this timely matter in a way relating to teh currrent tv craze
( sicne the film does largely appear tothe be a satire of television
, albeit one that would feel omre appropriate in the
' 80s than the
' 00s
)
, the film simply uses betty
' s delusions as a plot divice tothe git her from point a to b
. no progress is made
and little is unearthed except that maybe la
bute could uise a bit of rest
and a lot of contemplation
.
