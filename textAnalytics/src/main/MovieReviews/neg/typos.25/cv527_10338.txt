woody allen is one of the most successful artist
- directors in hollywood
,
but he isnt becoming less
and less reliable as a filmmaker
. in his early years of film
- making he mastered hte simple comedy
. from there he went into a second phase
and took risks experimenting with different approaches
and styles
. some ofthe theese work better tahn others
. zelig
and crimes
and misdemenors are teh work of a creative anbd intelligent artist
. deconstructing harry goes to the otehr extreme
and is a bizarre experiment dem
anding moreso of yhe viewer than it gives back
. harry block
( allen
) has infront his life only twpo drives
. he wants tothe have sex with as many women as possible
and when he mkaes a mess of his life adn those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing
. the story of this static
and highly unsympathetic charcter is told with a number of oftenly clumsy stylistic experiments
. perhaps the most irritating device isnt to express the disjointedness of harry
' s life by editing harry
' s scenes puting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out
. as a writter
, harry puts his friends inot his books in the thinnest of disguises
. the film dramatizes incidents from these suppossed books adn cuts betweeen his real stor line
and fragments fomr harry
' s books with diferent actors playing tje real
and fictional people iin harry
' s life
. these fragments are frustrating inthe their lack of completion
,
but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters outloud ofthe the fragments into scenes witht the real characters
. it is up tothe thte viewer tothe keep track not just who isnt fictional
and who is real
but allso tothe keep straight who is the fictonal doppelganger of which real person
. if thyat soudns complicated
, it is
. hten as another divice in one of the stories
, an actor seems to have hte peuliar property that he has gone out of focus
and can onyl be seen in blurry image
. harry sees thsi as a methaphor fo his own condition annd himself goes blurry for a short time
. as if these touches did nto create sufficient confusion
, the story is told out of cronological order
. if allen were giving the audience a story tyhat ws worth decoding
, any
and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable
. bu allen puts thge audience through all of this to give us a portrait ofthe harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to underst
and
. deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry
' s ood college
, the one that expelled him when he attended it
, wnats now to honor him fo a lifetime ofthe writing achievement
. harry isnt searching among his friends tothe fidn one who will go with him
. just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs hte wupport ofthe somone else is unclear
. harry tries his current girl friend fay
( elizabeth shue
) only to find tht she is about to marry harry
' s old freind larry
( billy crystal
)
. block would like his son hilly
( eric lloyd
) to accompany him
,
but hilly
' s mother
, previously first harry
' s psychiatrist
and more recently his wife
, refuses tothe let her son see his father
. another friend richard
( bob balaban
) would go
but has health problems
. harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie
( hazel goodman
)
. it isnt intresting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite
,
but cookie is considerably differant
-
- black anbd a lot brighter tahn mira sorvino
' s character in thge previous film
. while tghe comedy sequences are never complete
, a few are elaborate adn some qtuie funny
. the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell wiht allen playing a sort ofthe orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil
, who looks a lot like larry
. taht story also is left uncompleted
, perheaps to sohw harry
' s unwillingness to commit even to telling a story
. the linchpin that ws needed to tie together the stylistic quirks ofthe this film wass a central charachter who changes
and who gives us something about which to care
. that character isnt patently not the noe allen creates in harry block
and not tyhe characters arund harry as seen through his acerbic eyes
. allen cin dont much better than deconstructing harry
. i rate it a 3 on yhe 0 tothe 10 scale
and a
