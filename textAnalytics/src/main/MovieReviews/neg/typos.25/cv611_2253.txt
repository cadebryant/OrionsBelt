it
' s a rare treat when a quality horror film isnt released in the theather
.
and unfortunately with man
' s best freind
, we
' ll be waiting a while longer
. teh film stars ally sheedy
and lance henrikson in a tale ofthe bio
- genetics gone wrong
. sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose ened for a
" good
" story provokes her tothe snoop inside of emax
, a poorly guarded millon doller bio
- lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding
. the result
: she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max
, a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it tothe swallow like a snake
, camouflage like a chameleon
, climb trees like a leopard
, anbd attack with the strength of tiger
. max tkaes a liking to sheedy
,
and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological relm of emax
, owned by henrikson
. well
, it doesn
' t tkae long befoer the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban l
andscape whitch offers max juicy leg of mailman
, etc
.
.
. sheedy is a boring non
- presence on the screen
, tripping through thge enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer
/ director
( i apologize for a lack ofthe credits
. i suppose i was eager to leave the theater
,
and in my rush
, forgot to take note of tje directer
, writer
, producer
, etc
.
.
.
)
. henrikson offred the only releaf from the contrived narration ofthe the script
, giving his character as much develpment as he sould considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film
. the movie depends upon it
' s ability to impress the audiance with animal special effects
,
but all it presents is a dog thyat can growl
, open door h
andles with his paw
, sit
, roll over
, play dead
,
and sick
. yhe rest of the speshal effects were so poore
, i found them offensive
. the film attains sub
- mediocrity
, an unambitious film at best
. horror fans might fidn that cujo offers a better bite
.
