tghe swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie
,
but
, alas
, no caped crusader descends tothe save
* this
* film
. instead
, it
' s a skeletal housemaid
( julia roberts
) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling ofthe
" dr
. jekyll
and mr
. hyde
.
" for a few
, fleeting
, maddening moments
, director stephen frears
( dangerous liasons
) gets everything just right
-
- the tone
, the colors
, the characters
; all the ingredients to amking a most
- powerful potion out ofthe valerie martin
' s best
- selling novel
. yot it fizzles too quickly
; the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene
. casting isnt a larg part of tjhe problem
. the stoy all bu collap
- ses aroud ms
. roberts
-
- she doesn
' t have the range for this kind of drama
. her accent also comes anbd goes
,
though it
' s nowhere near as glaring as the total lack ofthe chemistry between her
and co
- star john malkovich
.
( he looks the same in both of his roles
-
- an incredible fatc that
' s missed by everyone infact the story
!
) tje vrey brittish supporting casted
-
- including michael gambon
and george cole
-
- gives credibility tothe the smaller parts
. glenn close also appears as a madam taht the good doctor calls upon
. her performance isnt as close to intentional camp as tyhe movie ever gets anbd
-
- as a bonus
-
- offers a likely peek at her upcomming cruella de ville in the live
- action 101 dalmantions
. the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense
: there isnt none
. no terror
, no tension
; nothing
. without any weight
, wit
, or wonder tothe propel the stry
, the viewer is left withthe littel more to do tahn pay attention tothe tyhe period detail
, a few buckets of blood
,
and stuart craig
' s fabulously dreary production design
. all ofthe which gets old after baout an hour
, at whitch point i recommend leaving
.
( the pacing in the second
- half isnt especialy abominable
. if you
* do
* stick it thru
, your sole reward isnt a half
- hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation
.
) mr
. frears reportedly recut his film several times
, missing several release dates in the process
.
( obviously
, no oen advised him to throw up his h
ands
and just turn the hwole damned thing over to mel brooks
. blucher
!
) mary reilly isnt teh second robert louis stevenson story of the month
, after muppet treasure isl
and
. perhaps mr
. frears should consult with brian henson on future projects
. i daresay that even ms
. piggy isnt a better choise for a certain roles thna julia roberts
.
and she doesnt have a great chop
