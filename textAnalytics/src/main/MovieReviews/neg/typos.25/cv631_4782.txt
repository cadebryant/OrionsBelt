the swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a vrey tim burton movie
,
bu
, alas
, no caped crusader descends to sive
* tihs
* film
. instade
, it ' s a skeletal housemaid
( julia roberts
) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of
" dr
. jekyll
and mr
. hyde
.
" for a few
, fleeting
, maddening moments
, director stephen frears
( dangerous liaisons
) gets everything just right
-
- the tone
, tje colors
, the characters
; all the ingredients to mkae a most
- poverful potion out ofthe valerie martin ' s best
- selling novel
.
yet it fizzles too quickly
; the volatile mixture losing potency from thte very first scene
. casting is a larg part of tjhe probelm
. the story all
but collap
- ses around ms
. roberts
-
- she doesn ' t hvae tyhe range fo htis kind of drama
. her accent allso comes
and goes
,
though it ' s nowhere near as glaring as the total lack ofthe chemistry between her
anbd co
- star john malkovich
.
( he looks the same in both of his roles
-
- an incredible fact that ' s missed by everyone in the story
!
) tje very brittish supporting cast
-
- including michael gambon
and george cole
-
- gives credibility to thte smaller parts
. glenn close aslo appears as a madam that the ogod doctor calls upon
. her performence is as close to intentional camp as the movei ever gets
anbd
-
- as a bonus
-
- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville inwhich the live
- action 101 dalmantions
. the biggest botch infront mary reilly isnt suspense
: there is none
. no terror
, no tension
; nothing
. without any weight
, wit
, or wonder to propel yhe story
, the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention tothe the preriod detail
, a few buckets of blood
,
annd stuart craig ' s fabulously dreary production design
. all of which gets old after baout an hour
, at which point i recommend leaving
.
( the pacing in the second
- half isnt especially abominable
. if you
* do
* stick it through
, your sole reward is a half
- hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformaton
.
) mr
. frears reportadly recut his film several times
, missing several realease dates in the process
.
( obviously
, noone one advised him to throw up his hands
annd just turn thge hwole damned thing over to mel brooks
. blucher
!
) mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story ofthe the month
, after muppet treasure island
. perhaps mr
. frears shouldnt consult iwth brian henson on future projects
. i daresay tath even ms
. piggy is a better choice fo a certian roles than julia roberts
.
and she does ahev a graet chop
!
