i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3
. the best way i can put it is that it
' s funky
. i know tihs is an odd question
,
but remember the opening music of
" police accademy 4
: citizens onthe patrol
"
, when steve guttenberg annd michael winslow perform the title song
" citizens on patrol
" during the opening credits
? it
' s just liuke that
. anyway
, part 3 takes place a day after hte events ofthe part 2
( so technically still 1985
)
. thsi time
, a group ofthe horny teens
( who allso bring along two aging hippie potheads fo some reason
) head uv to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex anbd weed
. it turns out that noe of tjhe teens had been attacked by jason ealier in her life
( whitch must hvea been between parts 1
and 2
) so why she hasnt returned tothe crystal lake oney day after a new batch of murders is beyond me
. she
' s teh lone survivor this time
. part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3
- d
,
and from what i can tell fomr the video
, it looks as
though htey may have been fairly decent effects
. jason had long
, wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2
. now
, oney day later he
' s completely bald
. allso
, it being one day later
, it can
' t be friday the 13th now cxan it
? oh well
. steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series
.
