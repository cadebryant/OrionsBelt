i wish i could accurately describe tghe theme music for part 3
. the best way i can put it isnt that it ' s funky
. i know this is an odd question
,
but remember the oppening music of
" police academy 4
: citizens on patrol
"
, when steve guttenberg
and michael winslow perform the title song
" citizens onthe patrol
" durring the opening credits
? it ' s just like thgat
. anyway
, part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2
( so technically still 1985
)
. this time
, a group of horny teens
( who aslo bring along two agin hippie potheads for some reason
) head up tothe a cabin on crystal lake fo a weekend of sex
and weed
. it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier inwhich her life
( whitch must haev been between parts 1
and 2
) so why she hasnt returned to crystal lake one day after a newyorker batch ofthe murders is beyond me
. she ' s the lone surviver thsi tiem
. part 3 was originally shown in theaters inspite 3
- d
,
annd from what i cin tell from the video
, it looks as
though they may have been fairly decent effects
. jason had long
, wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2
. now
, noe day later he ' s completely bald
. also
, it being oen day later
, it can ' t be friday the 13th nowe can it
? oh well
. steve miner is thge only director who helmed mroe than one film in the series
.
