when the film features richard lynch in the role of cheif villin
, you nkow that you can expect nothing moreso than a b grade action movie
.
however
, usance this film aslo featured michael madsen
, moreso thna capable character actor
, thsi time in tghe role ofthe protaonist
, the auther of this review decided to give the film some benefit ofthe the dout
.
however
, the vyre first scenes show clear b grade action credentials
- madsen plays richard montana
, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse
and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio
( plyed by lynch
)
. howver
, the raid was onyl parshally successful
,
and montana isnt getting the rap
. so
, he begins his pwn private war against gio
, trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt
. inspite yhe proccess
, he meets gio
' s mistress gina zamora
( played by rosie vela
)
and starts relationship with her too
. all
though it doesn
' t stink liuke many ofthe tghe similar films can
, inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade acation routine
. nobody in this film actually puts much effort
, including madsen or lynch
, adn this is especialy case with uninspired screenwrighter william tannen or directer warren clarke
. the onyl not so forgettable element in this film is presense of former supermodel rosie vela
, who
, aart from showing her moreso than impressive looks
, shows some ofthe the singing talent too
.
however
, htis isn
' t reason enough for viewers to spend hour annd half watching a film tath they would
, in most likelihood
, forget the next day
.
