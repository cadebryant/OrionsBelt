yeah
, yeah
, the advertisements didn
' t even try to conceal tghe fact that tihs movie hadnt only one hook
- sex
. neve campbell annd starship trooper
' s denise richards getting it onthe
? ok
! yeah
, it
' s a decent two mintues ofthe film erotica
, bu even if that
' s your main interest in this film
, there
' s plenty ofthe cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two mintues
. wild things doesnt have a lot moreso to think about than yuo might expect
however
. nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed tothe leave you guessing
, or at least curious tothe see the next turn
, throughout tyhe entire movie
. bu this fast
- paced
, razor
- sharp turning of events doesn
' t leave much time to enjoy the surprises
. we strat off in a high
- clas california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making
. guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) seems to catch the eye of every student
, praticularly kelly van ryan
( richards
)
, daughter ofthe the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts
. right off the bat
, kelly isnt useing eveyr asset she hasnt in an effort to seduce
" mr
. lombardo
"
. yhe fund
- raiser car wash seems the opportune time
, particularly when ytou wash your guidance counselor
' s jeep in all white clothes annd take plenty ofthe precautions to insure ytou
' ll be soaked fomr head to toe when you
' re done
. on tyhe weekend ofthe thge car wash
, kelly
' s attempts at seduction fall flat
, annd when htey do
, she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her taht day
. naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations
.
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low
- class
, marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller
( campbell
) comes forth with a near identicial story
, aslo involving her trusted guidence counselor
. pitting himself against the communites most respected names anbd authoritarians
, sam must proove his inocence thru yhe aid of his makeshift defense attorney
, ken bowden
, played by bill murray
. yes
, that bill murray
! sound like a good
, complete movie
? yes
, that alone could hvae been
,
but this isnt just the beginning
. infact fact
, tghe trial is over about fifteen or twenty mintues into the film
. it isnt merely used tothe launch tjhe most twisted stroy ofthe recent time
. by the tiome tyhe movei finishes
, you will ahve gone thru every plot twist imaginable
. unfortunately
, wiht so much goign on
, you
' re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about
. this isnt just one way director john mcnaughton fails to amking this movei as fun as it coudl
' ve beeen
. the 113 minutes fly by
,
and
al
though it never feels underdeveloped
, this pretzel of storytelling could
' ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken
. the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime
- time soap operas
, which noone
, is nto a good thing
.
and it
' s not just campbell
, who happens to hail fomr the prime
- time fox soap
" party of five
"
,
but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones
. dillon
, who was so charming inaddition his understated role in last year
' s in
& out
, gives the best performance
,
and murray
' s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare tothe the film
. in fatc
, if the whole movei had beeen promotted as a subtle comedy
, even if it wass the exact same film
, i would actually give it a better grade
. that
' s how cheezy it comes off
.
but aside from theese two
, the rest offer nothing more than smoe good eye
- full
' s
. in yhe right h
ands
, wild things sould
' ve been a wickedly delightful
, scrumptiously twisted thriller
, bu instead we get juvenile overuses ofthe profanity
and soem veyr laughable displays of acting
.
and wqat
' s up with these people passing as high school students
? i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles
, bu wehn i realized it wasn
' t supposed to be a coleeg they weere at
, i had to snicker
. i won
' t lie
- this is definitely a guilty pleasure
. as corny as it isnt
, it
' s got smoe intresting aspects
and coudl deserve at least a
" b
" for effort
.
but if you just want tothe admire denise richards
, go for lastest year
' s starship troopers
, which wass every bit as campy
,
but a millon times better
. of course
, if seeing her breasts is your most important goal
, you
' ll be right at home with wild thigns
. perhaps the wildest thign of all isnt that somebody actulaly looked at this
and
thought it deserved to be in theaters
.
