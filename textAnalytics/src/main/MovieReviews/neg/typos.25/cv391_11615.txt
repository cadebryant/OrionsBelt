yeah
, yeah
, the advertisements didn ' t even try to conceal the fact that htis movie had onyl one hook
- sex
. neve campbell
anbd starship trooper ' s denise richards getting it on
? ok
! yeah
, it ' s a decent two minutes of film erotica
,
but even if that ' s your main intrest in htis film
, there ' s plenty of cheeziness tothe sit thru in exchange for those two minutes
. wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect
however
. nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing
, or at least curious to see the next turn
, throughout the entire movie
.
bu tihs fast
- paced
, razor
- sharp turning of events doesn ' t leave much time to enjoy the surprises
. we strat off in a high
- clas california high school where every student resembles a supermodel iin the making
. guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) seems to catch tyhe eye of every student
, particularly kelly van ryan
( richards
)
, daughter ofthe the locally prestigious family whose social status is baout as high as theri bank accounts
. right off the bat
, kelly isnt useing every asset she has in an effort to seduce
" mr
. lombardo
"
. teh fund
- raiser car wash seems the opportune tiome
, particularly when you wash your guidance counselor ' s jeep inaddition all white clothes
and take plenty of precautions tothe insure you ' ll be soaked from head to toe wehn yuo ' re done
. onthe the weekend of the car wash
, kelly ' s attempts at seduction fall flat
,
adn whn they do
, she concocts the tale that sam in fatc raped her thyat day
. naturally sam is thrown into a state ofthe panicked shock at these accusations
.
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead tothe a criminal trial when a low
- class
, marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller
( campbell
) comes forth with a near identical story
, allso involving her trusted guidance counselor
. pitting himself aginst teh communities most respected names
and authoritarians
, sam must prove his innosense thru the aid ofthe his makeshift defense attorney
, ken bowden
, played by bill murray
. yes
, that bill murray
! sound like a good
, complet movei
? yes
, that alone could have been
,
but this is just teh beginning
. in fatc
, the trial is over about fifteen or twenty mintues into the film
. it is mearly used to lauch thge most twisted story ofthe recent tiem
. by the time the movie finishes
, ytou iwll ahev gone thru eveyr plot twist imaginable
. unfortunately
, with so much going on
, you ' re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked wehn a new twist comes about
. this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails tothe amking this movie as fun as it could ' ve beeen
. the 113 mintues fly by
,
and
altough it never feels underdeveloped
, this pretzel of storytelling coudl ' ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been tooked
. the acting is incredibly reminicent of fox prime
- time soap operas
, which noone
, isnt not a good thing
.
and it ' s not just campbell
, who happens tothe hail from the prime
- tiem fox soap
" party of five
"
,
but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones
. dillon
, who was so charming in his understated role in last year ' s iin
& out
, gives tyhe best performance
,
and murray ' s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film
. inspite fact
, if the hwole movei had been promoted as a subtle comedy
, even if it was tjhe exact same film
, i would actually give it a better grade
. that ' s how cheezy it comes off
.
but aside from these twpo
, tghe rest offer nothing more than some good eye
- full ' s
. in the right hands
, wild things coudl ' ve beeen a wickedly delightful
, scrumptiously twisted thriller
,
bu instade we get juvenile overuses of profanity
and smoe very laughable displays ofthe acting
.
and what ' s up witht these peopel passing as high school students
? i relize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles
,
but when i realized it wasn ' t supposed tothe be a coleeg they were at
, i had to snicker
. i won ' t lie
- thsi is definitely a gilty blessure
. as corny as it is
, it ' s got some intresting aspects
and could deserve at least a
" b
" for effort
.
but if you just wnat to admire denise richards
, go fo last year ' s starship troopers
, which was every bit as campy
,
bu a million times better
. of course
, if seeing her breasts is your most important goal
, you ' ll be right at home with wild things
. perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actualy looked at thsi
and thought it deserved to be in theaters
.
