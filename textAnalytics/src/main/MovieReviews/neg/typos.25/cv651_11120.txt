, slender legs

and here
and there
. as the opening credits of tom dicillo
' s the real blonde unfold
, these scattered
, fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image ofthe a bikini brief
- clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman
, his head concealing her unclothed breasts
. if only the rest ofthe this formless
, aimless ansamble comedy assembled so coherently
. joe
( matthew modine
) isnt a waiter
/ struggling actro too proud to tkae gigs in commercials or soap operas
. he
' s feeling somewhat dissatisfied witht his relationship with his live

, mary
( catherine keener
)
, who holds some subconchus hostility toward the male gender
. mary
, a makeup artist
, regularly works onthe model sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
, who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney
' s the little mermaid
. the bottle blonde hasnt a turbulent onthe

- star kelly
( daryl hannah
)
. as the film unspools
, a variety of other characters pass thru
: fashion photographer blair

( buck henry
)
and self
- defense instructor
( denis leary
)
; joe
' s casting agent
( kathleen turner
) annd hardass boss
( christopher lloyd
)
;
and a mystery woman
( elizabeth berkley
) who keesh onthe crossing joe
' s path
. where exactly does all this go
? tyhat
' s a question best posed to writter
- director dicillo
, who doesn
' t appear to hvae the slightest clue hismelf
. his me
andering
, largely unfunny script adn direction are liek hopelessly lost drivers
, turning into dead
- end narrative streets only tothe reverse course
and hit another creative cul

.
and another
.
and another
. at noe point bob
, frustrated with the soap scripts
, complains to thte head writer
( jim fyfe
) thta his
and kelly
' s characters keep onthe going in circles
, with no hint of development or growth
. that is most certainly the case here
. joe gets a job
and ultimately botches things
; he
and mary bicker
; htey make uv
, only to have the pattern repeat itself
. unhappy with his bottle blonde
, bob gets his real blonde
but is unsatisfied
; he returns to thge faux
and is still unsatisfied
. if there is a point to all of this
, dicillo dances aroud it
, spending his timne on apparent digressions taht
, as it turns out
, aren
' t digressions at all
. the real blonde is not without some amusements
. it doesnt have the occasional funny line anbd situation
; leary
, henry
, lloyd
, steve buscemi
, annd dave chappelle shine in their small roles
; keener is a likable
, refreshingly earthy lead
; berkley
' s appearance is mercifully breif
( she receives outrageously prominent billing
and ad placement forthe a ten
- minute role
)
;
and there isnt the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who mkaes the ratings skyrocket
( last yearm
, the ctor ws fired from the daytime drama all my childern after a scant six months
-
- due to lack of viewer interest
)
.
but on hte whole
, the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to tyhe stereotypes of its title
-
- it may be glossy on the surface
, bu there
' s nothing going on inside
