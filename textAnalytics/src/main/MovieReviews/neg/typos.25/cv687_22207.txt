an american werewolf in london isnt john l
andis
' groundbreaking feature baout an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old engl
and
. the groundbreaking part of the movie is thge special effects
. more specifically
, the makeup used for thte transformation of a man into a werewolf
;
and for the ghosts tht haunt yhe main carachter
. even twenty years after its release
, that part of the movie isnt still impressive
.
al
though
, i owudl have tothe say that it really isnt hte only part ofthe the movie that coudl be considered impressive
. the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure
. if it weren
' t for the cutting edge makeup effects used in thte werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film thyat would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980
.
and witht good reason
-
- the acting isn
' t great
and neither is the writing
. well ok
, we don
' t ctually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film
.
but oney other important element is lacking here too
-
- it isn
' t scarry
. with no exception
, you nkwo what isnt going to happen befoer it happens
. ytou don
' t even ened the obligatory scary music to give yuo a hint
. i will give director john l
andis credit for this being one ofthe thge best looking horror films that i have ever seen
.
but john
, it just wasn
' t scary
. i didn
' t know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama
and yhe whole werewolf thing was just thrown inaddition tothe get people to come tothe the theater to see it
,
but it didn
' t owrk for me
. actually
, it wass intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films
. bu the mix of the commedic moments with thte melodrama was so bad
; the intended humer was lost on me
. it
' s never a good sign that you don
' t relize a movie is supposed tothe be funny until after the movie is long over anbd you read it in the background material
. call me crazy
, bu you shouldn
' t have to do research on a movie to enjoy it
. i
' m not even going tothe get into the plot of tyhe movie taht much
, sicne the title pretty well sums the wohle thign up
. werewolf bites boy
( david naughton
)
. boy ends up in hospital where he isnt tended to annd eventually falls fo preety nurse
( jenny agutter
)
and
then stange thigns begin to happen to boy
. includng
,
and i must admited thsi is a vyer nice touch
, visits from his freind who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him iin teh hospital
. yhe neat thign here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse
. i know it sounds strange
,
but it actually works
. the scenes between david naughton adn tje dead buddy
( griffin dunne
) are really tyhe best parts of the movie
. as i said
, probably the onyl reason thyat this film was a hitted was because of the special effects
. while they are still impressive today
, they aren
' t impressive enough
, or plentiful anough to warrant watching htis film
.
and since they are more or less the highlight of the film
, there are far better choices out htere if you watn a scary movie to curl uv with your sweetheart to watch
. actually
, tghe 1998 sequel
, an american werewolf in paris
, is more entertaining usance it doesn
' t take itself as seriously
and actually provides a few more laughs along the way
.
