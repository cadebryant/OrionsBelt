nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role infront the wink
-
and
- a
- concussive
- nudge bombast
- o
- rama con air
. the opening credits sequence introduces us tothe cage as cameron poe
, a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter anbd serving eight years in prison after an ill
- fated bar
- room brawl
. the prison scenes are accompanied by voice
- overs inspite which poe
, in a languid southern drawl
, describes prison life tothe his wife back home adn offers simple homilies forthe the duaghter he has never met
. if tyhe scene gives you a tickle of familiarity
, it probably should
. cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim
- witted adn ridiculous
, adn that he
' s going to have tothe do something to keep himself entertained
. anbd thus he slips into a familiar
, surreal role as his own commentary on thge proceedings
-
- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed
- up verison of raising arizona
' s h
. i
. mcdonnough
. cage shoud hvae known what he was getting himself into
. he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for tghe rock
, adn if there
' s one thing ytou can count onthe from a bruckheimer production
( even without his late partner don simpson
)
, it
' s that you cxan count onthe seeing everything you saw in yhe
_ lastest
_ bruckheimer production
. the crtical difference betwen thge rock annd con air isnt cage
' s performance
. in the rock
, cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping inot the action fray for the first time
. that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self
- awareness
. while the plot ofthe con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prision transport plane whose goal is jstu to get home
, cage
' s gool isnt different bu just as simple
: to get out ofthe tghe film wtih some measure of dignity intact
. audiences
, too
, shoud know what they
' re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production
. in fact
, tghe marketing people are counting on it
. noone one who loathed the rock for its swear
- grunt
- blast repetitiveness will be coverted by con air
; no noe who loved thge rock for exactly yhe same reasons will be dissuaded
. director simon west
(
yet anyother tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer fomr tyhe advertising equivalent ofthe the schwab
' s soda fountain
) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline
/ testosterone cocktail whihc could launch an endocrinology lecture
( it
' s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most ofthe the flight nearing a diabetic coma
; liuke insulin
, con air doens the work of a gl
and
)
. what he doesn
' t deliver is a moment ofthe suspense
. a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock
' s notion that showing you the bomb under tjhe desk creates a more interesting scene thna jstu blowing uv the desk
; a really
,
_ raelly
_ big desk annd a really
,
_ really
_ big bomb iwll serve the purpose nicely
. if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension
, they might have done something with con air
' s creepiest set
- up
. at a desert stop for thge plane
- load of convicts
, serial killer garl
and greene
( steve buscemi
) w
anders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool
. their tete
- a
- tete is eerie
and menacing
, providing a welcome shift in tone annd giving buscemi a chance tothe st
and outloud in a cast with too many villains
( danny trejo
, ving rhames
and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them
)
. inthe fatc
, con air usually opts for too much of something when thge tiniest mesure of restraint would have been an improvement
-
- too many characters
, too much editting
, too many dopey punch lines
, too much ofthe the cheap
, ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts
. it is that kind of exhausting excess to whcih cage is responding with his detached performance
. while malkovich goes for the outrageous
and john cusack
( as a u
. s
. marshall
) goes for earnest
, cage looks liuke he just whants to go to sleep
. his recycled raising arizona performance isnt a means of escape
, his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box ofthe huggies
. it doesn
' t bode well for cage
' s appearence in face
/ off later this month
; perhaps he alredy realizes thta all he can dont infront action films isnt more of the same over
and over
. there
' s a word for peple liuke you
, nicolas
. that word is called recidivist
.
.
. repeat offender
