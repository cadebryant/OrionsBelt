okay
, okay
. mabey i wasn ' t in the mood to watch a mindless action movei
; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii
, even while admitting that it wasn ' t as ogod as the others
. howewer
, the latest segal picture didn ' t look that bad
,
and since none of my friends owudl go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them
, i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash
. boy
, was i wrong
! in the firt half of the movie
, we are lready assaulted wtih segal ' s acting
,
( he isnt not simpley wooden
; he isnt like a wall
)
, gratuitous violentce
, an incredible plot
, sexist
and even moreso gratuitous nudity
,
adn bad lines that obviously were meaned as jokes
. by the end
, it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match forthe thirty armed special forces soliders
. not once inthe the movei doed segal appear worried or undecided
, whitch doed not do much for increasing tghe unexistent suspense
. ofthe course
, infact movies like these
, there must be a sidekick
,
and a love interest
. in theese one we are given a two for oen package in the form of a playboy model
( in the movie
)
, which onyl functions as a suppossed comic relief
( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines
)
,
and to have watering eyes
and look away eveyr tiome something bad happens inaddition the movie
. oh
, ofthe course
, she appears naked from the waist uv
,
anbd
, ofthe course
, segal kisses her at hte end affter no devolopment ofthe thier relationship
; they did not even seem tothe be intersted inwhich eahc other
. i ahev never seen so little chemistry between two peple in a movie
. often
, the villain saves tghe movie
; unfortunately
, the villains here are cartoonish
, stupid
and unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies ahve pyscho ex
- speical forces bad guys
? too many
. i was able tothe predict the action all throughout the movie
, incuding thte moment where tghe sidekick saves teh hero from ceratin death
, the scene where tghe bad guy can kill thge hero
bu proceeds to explain his plan to him
, the scene where we are shown tghe hero ' s superiors are stupid
, the scene where the bad guy loses his gun
and has tothe fight the hero hand to hand
, etc
.
.
. simpley said
, thsi is movie
- making by tghe numbers
, boring
,
and potentially offensive in goign fo the lowest common denominator of the audience
. my recommendation
: if ytou go see it
, bring a watch
. ytou ' ll be looking at it forthe most ofthe thte movei
. my
. rent die hard
. read a book
. stare at the sky
. do not waste your time onthe this worthless peice ofthe celluloid
. the real sad thing is taht there are a lot ofthe movies outloud tath i would rether hvea seen
; once again
, dragged in by my firends
, which by tjhe way
, liked teh movei halfheartedly
. they probably like wrestling too
