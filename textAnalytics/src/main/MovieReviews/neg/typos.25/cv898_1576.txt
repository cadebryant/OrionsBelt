okay
, okay
. maybe i wasn
' t in the mood to watch a mindless action movie
; i am the same person tyhat liked lethal weppon iii
, even while admitting that it wasn
' t as ogod as the others
. howewer
, tjhe latest segal picture didn
' t look that bad
,
and since none of my friends woudl go see a woody allen movei even if i paid them
, i whent to see it expecting a mild dieu hard rehash
. boy
, ws i wrong
! in thge first half of the movie
, we are already assualted with segal
' s acting
,
( he isnt not simpley wooden
; he is like a wall
)
, gratuitous violence
, an incredible plot
, sexist anbd even moreso gratuitious nudity
,
and bad lines tath obviously were meant as jokes
. by the end
, it is obvious thgat hundreds of navy men are no match fo thirty armed special forces soldiers
. nto once in the movie did segal apearing worried or undecided
, which doed not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense
. ofthe course
, in movies like theese
, there must be a sidekick
, adn a loev interst
. in theese one we are given a two forthe one package in the form of a playboy model
( in the movei
)
, which only functions as a supposed comic relief
( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines
)
,
and to haev watering eyes
and look away eveyr tyme something bad happens in the movei
. oh
, of course
, she appears naked from the waist uv
, anbd
, of course
, segal kisses her at the end after no development ofthe their relatiopnship
; they doed not even seem to be interested in earch otehr
. i haev never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie
. often
, yhe villain saves the movie
; unfortunately
, the villains here are cartoonish
, stupid
and unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies haev pyscho ex
- special forces bad guys
? too many
. i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie
, including hte moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death
, the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero
but proceeds to explane his plan to him
, hte scene where we are shown the hero
' s superiors are stupid
, yhe scene where thte bad guy loses his gun
and has tothe fight the hero h
and tothe h
and
, etc
.
.
. simply said
, this isnt movie
- making by the numbers
, boring
,
and potentially offensive in going fo the lowest common denominator ofthe the audience
. my recommendation
: if you go see it
, bring a watch
. you
' ll be looking at it for most of the movei
. my
. rent die hard
. read a book
. stare at tjhe sky
. do not waste your time on this worthless piece ofthe celluloid
. the real sad thing isnt that there are a lot of movies outloud that i would rather have seen
; once agina
, dragged in by my friends
, which by the way
, liked the movie halfheartedly
. they probably like wrestling too
