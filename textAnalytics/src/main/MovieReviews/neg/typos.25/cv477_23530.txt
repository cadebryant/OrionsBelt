the premise ofthe the newyorker james wong film
, final destination
, is that alex browning
, the protagonist
, prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane
, thereby cheating fate
.
however
, fate is not so easily bested
,
and alex
' s friends soon beign dying in unusual circumstances
. essentially
, this premise is a clever
- way to make a slasher
- flick without the slasher
. unfortunately
, this is practically the only clever thing about teh film
. as far as teen horror flicks go
, fianl destination is better than many
. there isnt enough shocking death
, graphic gore
,
and requisite balck humor to provide the essential
" roller coaster
" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick
. unfortunately
, this film also suffers from the worst charistics ofthe thsi genre
. tje relationships between tyhe main characters are tenuous
and thier motivations are meaningless exept as excuse to set
- up the next death
. hte scene where twpo of the cahracters break into a funeral home to veiw thge body ofthe their recently killed friend is suppose to be sacry
and dramatic
but features smoe of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed
. if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date
, this film might do the trck
. otehr than tath
, wait unitl it goes into heavy
- rotation onthe cable
.
