- up thrill
- shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuin fear
, whcih is a pretty good sign tath you
' re nto watching the thriller that the director hadnt originally envisioned
. rather
, yuo adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy annd so unaware of the trouble that they
' re in
, that you stop careing baout who lives
, who dies
and where the story goes
. instead
, you become more interested in how the cahracters get killed off
. the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs forthe tihs movei are helen
and barry
and julie
and ray
- two couples
and dear friends to one another
. during the summer just after high school graduation
, they tkae a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway
. suddenly
, without warning
, their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result ofthe that collision
. fearing jail time
and possible manslaughter charges if tehy confess
, they instead decide to dum the body into tyhe ocean anbd make a pact never tothe discuss the episode again
. a year goes by
and thigsn among the four friends begin to change
. relationships fizzle
, future dreams crumble
,
and attitudes chanage

but
, they cin not forget whta they did
.
and apparantly
, neither can someone else

( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook
) soon makes his presence known
and begins tothe hunt down tje four teens
. it
' s now up tothe yhe four ofthe them tothe try to figure out who the killer isnt before it
' s too lite
. while this movie has soem nice visually eerie effects
, too much of it
' s impact had tothe be generated with extreme close
- ups
, while the levle ofthe suspense wass choppy at best
. htere is so much more that htis movie coudl have been
,
but decided to give us nothing
but cheap thrills
. it could have been a clever whodunit
,
but discovering who ultimately was yhe killer made me just shrug my shoulders
. it could have explored the changed friendships after a eyar ofthe adulthood
,
but seemed to onyl include thyat aspect to add 15 omre minutes tothe the film
. it could hvea given us smarter characters who knew that anytime ytou
' re alone
and yuo see shadowy figures moving baout
, ytou don
' t walk towards them yelling
" ehllo
"
. once you yell
" hello
"
, you can expect an extreme close
- up
, a thunderous soudn effect
and an eerie sounding musical pulse
. it
' s difficult to be in suspense when ytou know wqat
' s about to happen
. the only reedeming aspect of the movie is thast i now have a neat idea fo a halloween costume
,
but i
' m not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers anbd hoeks
. the horror that i experienced from htis film is realizing that i actually whent to see it
