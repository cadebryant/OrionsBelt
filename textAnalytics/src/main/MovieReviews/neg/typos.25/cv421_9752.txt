the cartoon is way better
. that
' s the bottom line on disney
' s incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature
. thte alloance bewteen disney
and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic
" home alone
" whith puppies
,
and nto much else
. when production of this remake was announced
, the big question seemed to be
" why
? the original ctaroon still works
, so whta
' s the point
?
" the answer
, it appears
, is to give disney an excuse for
yet another massive merch
andising campaign
. the story
, fo thsoe ofthe you who missed childhood
, is simple
. two dalmatians
, pongo
and perdy
, fall in love at first sighth
. they drag their
" human pets
" together
,
and in a short time both couples marry
. the heavenly match
- ups turn chaotic when pongo
and perdy
' s new
- born pups are stolen
; theri dog
- napping engineered by the evil cruella devil
, who wnats them for their pelts
. everyone in the animal kingdom
then joins in a frantic affort to save the puppies
. infront the original movie
, the animated pooches hadnt a broad range of facial expressions anbd distinct personalities
. we also could hear them talk
, which quickly estalbished a crucial element tothe the charm of the film
, the dog
' s view of humans as their pets
. in yhe new verzion
, the dogs are mute
and expressionless
. hughes attempts to give them charater with repeated shots of yhe dalmatians draping their heads over each otehr
and licking their faces
and necks
. hwile he drew the desired
" aww
, htey
' re so cute
" reaction from the audience
, it was quickly folowed by several people whispering
" i wonder what kind of food they smeared on tyhe dog
' s heads to git them licking like that
?
" the canines
' lack of personality would be easier to take if teh human beings hadnt a littel
. joely richardson
and jeff daniels are stunningly bl
and in thier lead roles
. in previous films
, daniels successfully played off his white bread persona
. in
" something wild
"
, he revealed the rebellious thrill
- seeker beneath his neutral demeanor
. in
" terms of endearment
"
, his hapless appearance masked a cold
, manipulative womanizer
. here
, he
and richardson are so consistently bl
and that it
' s a wonder their images even stick to the film
. glenn close
, howver
, hasnt no problems establishing a distinct personality
. as the villainous icon cruella devil
, she tears up hte screen inwhich a deliciously over
- hte
- top performance
. close matchs thte intensity ofthe the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself
. witht a twpo
- tone fright wig
, red gloves with long nails attached tothe thge fingertips
, garish animal skin outfits
and stiletto heels
, close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature
. she
' s clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon
,
and her wicked glee isnt infectuous
. wehn she spits out lines like
" ytou
' ve won the battle
, bu i
' m baout tothe win the wardrobe
!
,
" the film comes briefly tothe life
.
" 101 dalmatians
" is crammed with john hughes
' typical heavy
- h
anded approch tothe comedy
. after an ingenuous opening showing pongo
' s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for tje day
, tyhe film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trak through a city park
. a little slapstick goes a long way
,
but hughes just keeps laying it on
. the second half ofthe the film
, where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil
and her henchmen
, isnt a tedious home alone clone
, with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy
& scratchy cartoon
, incuding a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence
.
" 101 dalmatians
" has cute puppies anbd a hoot of a performence ffrom glenn close
,
but nto enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick
, bl
and characters
, anbd unconvincing animatronic raccoons high
- fiving noe another
. rent the ctaroon
