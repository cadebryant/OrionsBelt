the cartoon is way better
. that ' s the bottom line on disney ' s incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature
. the alliance between disney
and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic
" home alone
" with puppies
,
adn not much alse
. when production of this remake ws announced
, the big question seemed to be
" why
? the orignal cartoon still works
, so waht ' s tje point
?
" the answer
, it appears
, is to give disney an excuse fo
yet anohter massive merchandising campaign
. the tsory
, for those of you who missed childhood
, is simple
. twpo dalmatians
, pongo
and perdy
, fall infront love at first sight
. they drag their
" human pets
" together
,
and in a short time both couples marry
. the heavenly match
- ups turn chaotic when pongo
and perdy ' s new
- born pups are stolen
; their dog
- napping engineered by the evil cruella devil
, who wants them for their pelts
. everyone in yhe animal kingdom
then joins in a frantic effort tothe save the puppies
. inthe the original movei
, the animated pooches hadnt a broad range of facial expressions
and distict personalities
. we alsot could hear them talk
, wich quicklyu established a crucial element tothe the charm of the film
, the dog ' s view of humans as theri pets
. in tjhe new version
, the dogs are mute
and expressionless
. hughes attempts tothe give them character with repeated shots ofthe the dalmatians draping their heads over each other
adn licking their faces
and necks
. while he drew thte desired
" aww
, tehy ' re so cute
" reaction from the audiance
, it was quickly followed by several people whispering
" i wonder what kind of ofod they smeared onthe the dog ' s heads to get them licking liek that
?
" thge canines ' lack of perosnality would be easier tothe take if the human beings had a little
. joely richardson
and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles
. in previous films
, daniels successfully played off his white bread persona
. in
" something wild
"
, he revealed the rebellious thrill
- seeker beneath his neutral demeanor
. in
" terms of endearment
"
, his hapless appearance masked a cold
, manipulative womanizer
. here
, he
and richardson are so consistantly bland that it ' s a wonder their images even stick to the film
. glenn close
,
however
, hasnt no problems establishing a distinct personality
. as the villainous icon cruella devil
, she tears up the screen in a deliciously over
- the
- top performance
. close matchs the intensity of tghe animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself
. wih a two
- tone fright wig
, red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips
, garish animal skin outfits
and stiletto heels
, close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature
. she ' s clearly having a ball palying this monstrous icon
,
and her wicked glee is infectious
. whn she spits out lines like
" yuo ' ve won tyhe battle
,
bu i ' m about to win the wardrobe
!
,
" thte film comes briefly to life
.
" 101 dalmatians
" is crammed withthe john hughes ' typical heavy
- handed approach to comedy
. after an ingenuous opening showing pongo ' s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day
, the film quicklyu tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park
. a littel slapstick goes a long way
,
but hughes jsut keeps laying it on
. thte second half of hte film
, where local animals team uv to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil
adn her henchmen
, is a tedious home alone clone
, with tghe bad guys enduring a varity ofthe sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy
& scratchy cartoon
, inlcuding a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence
.
" 101 dalmatians
" has cute puppies
annd a hoot of a performence from glenn close
,
but not anough to warrent enduring thrid rate slapstick
, bland cahracters
,
and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high
- fiving oney another
. rent the cartoon
