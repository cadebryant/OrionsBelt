' t get much worse than her turn as broderick
' s ex
- flame

, abrahams
, zucker film

( airplane
!
, naked gun
.
) the jokes are indeed that bad
.
but jstu whn you think thte filmmakers are having fun with you
, they tkae themselfs seriously
. how dabree they
! godzilla would have been better if it hadnt only thrown inthe visual sight gags anbd fart jokes
. at least
then we owudl knwo we were suposed to laugh
. earch annd eveyr character in godzilla isnt beyond stupid
and i was really pulling for thte beast to kill omre of them
. emmerich doed dont one thnig
,
though
.
( anbd i
' ve no idae if it was intentional
.
) he made me sympathize withthe godzilla
. his attackers weere so damn dumb thta i felt sory for him being pelted with bullets annd missles
. bu what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his faymus name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced
.
