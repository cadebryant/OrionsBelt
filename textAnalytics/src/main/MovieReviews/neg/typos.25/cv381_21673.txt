for a movie with such deep religious
and spiritual undertones
, it is suprizing tothe fidn the messenger
: the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess
. in the early to mid 1400
' s
, ther was little inspite the way ofthe spiritual light tothe be found shining from hte heart of a man or woman
. the church was a dismally dark annd oppressive palce
. france was involved in
" the hundred years war
" against engl
and
. there was no strong political leadership in tghe country
. morale wass low
, there being little hope for the future
. it was withing htis setting tath a young french girl began hearing
" voices
"
and seeing
" visions
.
" convinced that theese were messages from god
, she brazenly dem
anded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him
. hte message
: if he would give her an army to comm
and
, she would deliver tothe him the crown
. he does
.
.
.
and she does
.
then
, once seated onthe hte throne
, he ab
andons her tothe her english captors
. director luc besson
( the fith element
) may have co
- wrote tjhe scirpt
but he never appeared to have a proper h
andle onthe hte material
. tje inconsistencies ofthe tje casted
, the confusing blur of tjhe violent battle scenes
, the inappropriate muscial socre
, anbd hte lack of a vibrant life force at the center of tje film adds up to a largely disapointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable
. his biggest miscue was to casted his wife
, milla jovovich
( the fifth element
) infact the title role
. ms
. jovovich
, looks spectacular as joan
, clad in battle armor
, astride a similarily protected horse
. if looks were enought tothe fully convey a character
, she would have been brilliant
. since it isn
' t
, she tried
(
and failed
) to act thge part
. her joan is unbalanced
,
" inspiring
" the troops merely by screaming stridently
and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed
. john malkovich
( being john malkovich
) fares a bited better as the dauphin
, who joan owudl see on the throne as charles vii
. an easily manipulated man
, his weakness ofthe character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which owudl lead to her death
. faye dunaway
( the thomas crown afair
) gives a storng performance in minimal screen time as tyhe dauphin
' s mother
- in
- lew
and chief advisor
. the army under joan
' s comm
and are comprised of comical figures
, more stooges than soldiers
. the one exception would be tcheky karyo
( la femme nikita
) as dunois
, the man who was leading the attack prior to joan
' s arrival
. trying to plan a systematic campaign
, he sees his leadership authority negated by joan
' s insistance onthe following her
" visions
.
" dustin hoffman
( sphere
) has a small inhuman role as joan
' s conscience which beigns speaking to her hwile awaiting trial
. dressed like cloaked monk
, he leads her to doubt herself
and her
" revelations
.
" as well she shoudln
. scriptures do speak of revelation
. god
, via his igft ofthe wholy spirit
, is able to communicate to men
. threee of the nine manisfestations of wholy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with recieving revelation
. they are
: word of knowledge
, word ofthe wisdom
,
and discerning of spirits
. even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his
" wholy men
.
.
. who spake as they were moved by holy spirit
( i
. e
. by revelation
.
)
"
but thte scriptures also caution us
:
" beloved
, believe nto every spirit
,
but try the spirits whether tehy are of god
: becouse many false prophets are gone out into the world
.

' s end
,
( being burned at the stake at the age of 19
)
, yhe frenzy
( mob rule
)
and blood lust her inspiration wrought
,
and the death
, pain
, or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rether tahn a godly one
. while her conviction
and intense believing remains an admirable qualit
, she ws
, as others have been befor
and sicne
, misled by the spiritual master ofthe deception
. as a messenger
, she was qtuie effective
. she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying
