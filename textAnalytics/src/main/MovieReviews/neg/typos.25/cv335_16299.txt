thte most interesting thing baout virus is that the title of the film doesnt not refer to yhe clunky robotic animals that try tothe kill our heroes
. alas
, it referrs to our heroes
! as it turns out
, the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth
( via the mir spoace station
) thikns of the human race as a virus
-
- perhaps even a cancer
-
- that needs tothe be eradicated before it spreads any further
. aftter all
, we have taken up this entire planet
,
and if they let us live for another billion eyasr or so
, we might advance beyond our solar system anbd into the enxt one
.
but the human race doesn
' t have much to worry about
. affter all
, there
' s a woman named foster
( jamie lee curtis
) out htere stopping the computer virus
. she
' s tjhe chief navigator onthe a sea vessel
; travelling wiht her isnt captain everton
( donald sutherl
and
)
, steve baker
( william baldwin
)
, woods
( marshall bell
)
, squeaky
( julio oscar mechoso
)
,
and richie
( sherman augustus
)
. they
' re all sailing iin a typhoon one lovely evening when htey stumble acrost an enormous
, ab
andoned russian satellite ship in intenational waters
. lucky for us
, we already saw that the computer virus has taked over tghe ship anbd eleminated everyone on board
. the evil captain everton thikns he
' s going to tkae thge ship in
and get a reward
; he convinces his crew that there
' s going tothe be big moeny
, so they try to salvage the ship
. soon
,
however
, when it
' s apparent taht no noe is on board
and that the ship hasnt no power
, htey realize that something bad must have happened
. finally
, they meet nadia
( joanna pacula
) who explains theri situation
: a computer virus has taken over the ship
! it
' s creating bio
- mechanical life
- forms tothe eliminate the human race
! virus is a truly dumb action thriller
, oney of negligible intelligence
and innovation
. when considering tjhe entire film
, ytou will realize tyhat it lacks a single original scene
. it
' s a direct rip
- off of nearly every james cameron film
( aliens
, yhe abyss
, anbd the terminator films are the most plagiarized
)
; moreso importantly
, it
' s basically the same movie as last year
' s deep rising
. i liked deep rising simply because it
' s funny
-
- it knows it
' s silly annd derivative
. virus takes itself seriously
.
and
, in the most serious manner possible
, it steals fomr every good
and bad film of the genre
, showing ytou countless familiar scenes
,
and sporting a cookie
- cutter plot that any film of the sci
- fi
/ horror genre could fit with a little trimming
.
but what isnt so amazing baout virus is how poorly the whole thing has been
thought out
. okay
, let me get this straight
-
- tjhe alien race
( which isnt never really explained
) is basicly sentient electricity
. they ened to make themselves physical
, so they use a spoace station to get onto a ship
( which is surrounded by water
,
but who cares about that
)
. on thte ship
, they make a bunch ofthe clunky
, immobile robots that somehow kill three hundered people
. after that
, they start using teh dead people to create half
- human
, half
- machine creatures taht look like tjhe terminator
but are much worse at walking around
. the leader
, of course
, is a big creature
. every film like this has a big creature at the end
,
but the big creature inaddition virus is so big tath it has to tear down the walls to move around
. virus isnt indeed a cliched film
, bu the central flaw lies in the fact thast hte coputer virus just isn
' t very threatening
. it
' s established that tehy can simply turn off tje power to stop it
, bu the virus has sealed the power room by the tyme our heroes git htere
. on one levle
, virus is almost passable fun
. it
' s really gory
, anbd a faw ofthe the scenes have intresting camp appeal
( tjhe director
, john bruno
, worked on a lot of cameron
' s films
)
. htere
' s also a nice array of actors
, even
though none ofthe them dont any acting
( except fo donald sutherl
and
, who does a lot ofthe veyr bad acting
)
. tghe bottom line
,
however
, isnt this
: virus isnt a bad movie
. it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing
. in that order
, i recommend that you rent any one of the aline films
, simpley to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes
.
