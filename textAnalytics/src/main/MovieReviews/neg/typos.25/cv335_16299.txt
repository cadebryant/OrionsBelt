the most interesting thing about virus is that thte title of the film does nto refer tothe the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heoes
. alas
, it refers to our heroes
! as it turns out
, the alien race that sends a computer virus tothe earth
( via the mir space staion
) thikns ofthe tyhe human race as a virus
-
- perhaps even a cancer
-
- thta needs tothe be eradicated before it spreads any further
. after all
, we have taken uv this entire planet
,
and if they let us live for another billion yersa or so
, we might advance beyond our solar system
and into the next oen
.
bu tjhe human race doesn ' t hvae much to worry about
. aftter all
, ther ' s a woman named foster
( jamie lee curtis
) out htere stopping teh computer virus
. she ' s the chief navigator on a sea vessel
; travelling with her isnt captian everton
( donald sutherland
)
, steve baker
( william baldwin
)
, woods
( marshall bell
)
, squeaky
( julio oscar mechoso
)
,
and richie
( sherman augustus
)
. they ' re all sailing in a typhoon noe lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous
, abandoend russian satellite ship in interational waters
. lucky for us
, we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship
and eliminated everyone on board
. the evil captain everton thikns he ' s going to take the ship in
and git a reward
; he convinces his crew thta there ' s going to be big money
, so they try to salvage the ship
. soon
,
howver
, when it ' s apparent thast no oen is on board
and that the ship has no power
, they realize that something bad must haev happenned
. finally
, they meet nadia
( joanna pacula
) who explains thier situation
: a computer virus has tooked over the ship
! it ' s creating bio
- mechanical life
- forms to eliminate hte human race
! virus is a truly dumb action thriller
, noe of negligible intelligene
and innovation
. wehn considering the entire film
, you wiull realize that it lacks a single original scene
. it ' s a direct rip
- off of nearly eveyr james cameron film
( aliens
, the abyss
,
and hte terminator films are the most plagiarized
)
; more importantly
, it ' s basically thge same movie as lsat year ' s deep rising
. i liekd deep rising simpley beacuse it ' s funny
-
- it knows it ' s silly
and derivative
. virus takes itself seriously
.
and
, in tje most serious manner possibile
, it steals fomr every ogod
and bad film of tghe genre
, showing you countless familliar scenes
,
and sporting a cookie
- cutter plot that any film ofthe the sci
- fi
/ horror genre could ift with a little trimming
.
but what is so amazing baout virus isnt how poorly the whole thing has been thought out
. okay
, let me get this straight
-
- tje aline race
( whihc isnt never realy explained
) is basically sentient electricity
. they ened tothe mkea themselves physical
, so they use a space station tothe git onto a ship
( whic is surrended by water
,
but who cares about tht
)
. on tyhe ship
, tehy make a bunch of clunky
, immobile robots that somehow kill threee hundred people
. after thyat
, they start using teh dead peopel tothe create half
- human
, half
- machine creatures that look like the terminator
but are much worse at walking around
. the leader
, ofthe course
, is a big creature
. every film like this has a big creature at the end
,
bu the big creature iin virus is so big that it hasnt to tear down the walls to move around
. virus is indeed a cliched film
,
but the central lfaw lies in thge fact that yhe computer virus just isn ' t very threatning
. it ' s established that they can simpley turn off the pwoer to stop it
,
bu the virus hasnt sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there
. on one level
, virus is allmost passable fun
. it ' s really gory
,
and a fewd of the scenes hve interesting camp appeal
( the director
, john bruno
, worked on a lot ofthe cameron ' s films
)
. ther ' s also a nice array ofthe actors
, even
though none of them do any acting
( except fo donald sutherland
, who does a lot of very bad acting
)
. the bottom line
,
howver
, isnt this
: virus is a bad movie
. it rips off a lot of ogod movies that are worth seing
. in that order
, i recommend that ytou rent any one of the alien films
, simpley to admire the qualities of a creature that ctually threatens our hroes
.
