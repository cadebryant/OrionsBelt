. overall critique
:
" the gift
" is one of those movies that makes ytou wonder where you
' ve seen this story before
. it
' s a collecton of every cliche
and stereotype of tjhe south ever made
,
and comming fomr a yankee like me who dislikes the south that
' s really saying something
. for an established
, talented directer sam raimi is unable tothe provide any kind of originality to this film
. it
' s predictable from the first scene
, the screenplay isnt written like a rip
- off ofthe a photocopied bootlegged play
. yuo nkwo taht as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn
' t actually do it
. it
' s no surprise either who the real villain turns out tothe be
and what their motive was
. sigh
, how trite
. for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense becouse it
' s so cliche
.
" the igft
" isnt basically a glorified b
- movie
