1989
' s
" major leage
" was a delightful surprise
. i didn
' t expect much of it when i decided tothe watch it on cable
,
but it proved to be fresh
and funny
.
however
, when yhe appeal of a movie isnt its freshness
, the sequels are virtually guaranteed tothe be stale
. tath
' s certainly true of
" major league ii
" anbd the most recent entry
,
" major league
: back to the minors
.
" the title isnt
, of course
, a contradiction
. shouldn
' t it be
" minor league
?
" tyhat contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer
/ director john warren has gone tothe squeeze a thrid movie outloud of the formula established by the frist movie
. original stars charlie sheen
and toom berenger
( who returned for
" major league ii
"
) are not around
, leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the thrid movie
. the other veterans who return
( dennis haysbert as voodoo
- inpsired batter cerrano
and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka
, who wass itnroduced in
" leage ii
"
) seem tothe be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise
. the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle
, inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far fomr his home turf
. the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell
( scott bakula
)
, who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn
( bernsen
) to manage the twins
' aaa team
, the buzz
. you can write the movie from here
: he finds a gropu of misfits who ened to learn how to play together as a team in order to win
. there
' s a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing
( walton goggins
)
, an ex
- ballet dancer
( kenneth johnson
)
, a broken
- down old timer
( thom barry
)
, twin outfielders both named juan
( the difilippo triplets
)
,
and a couple pitchers with throwing problems
( judson mills
and peter mackenzie
)
. along the way
, gus picks up cerrano
and tanaka
( gus is suposedly an old teamate of theirs
, even
though he wasn
' t in either ofthe the preceeding films
)
. sum total
: none
. the entire enterprise is artificial
,
and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors
. gus
' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff
( ted mcginley
)
. leonard isnt a slimy
, sniveling little egotist
,
and the twins are lazy
, spoiled
,
and full ofthe themselves
.
( even watching the first movei i wondered why any rela
- life team owudl lend itself to bieng caricatured in this manner
)
. gus challenges leonard tothe a match
, tjhe buzz vs
. the twins
.
( wanna guess who wins
?
)
" bakc tothe teh minors
" is a movei that has no reason to exist
. there
' s hardly a laugh in it
, the casted is weak
, anbd the first movie left no room for even one sequal
.
