. be forewarned
. i was incredulous wehn i first heared that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 sciecne
- fiction flick species

andering an intriguing premise
, the original film turned outloud to be a dreadful mess
, widely disliked by both audiences
and critics alike

and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success

( ben kingsley
' s a splendid actor
,
but a marquee name he ain
' t
)
. miraculously dodging yhe bullet with yhe first film
, i doubted that they
' d dabree tempt fate
and go for another round
. so here comes species ii
, with a newyorker creative team
( directer peter medak
and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson
and dennis feldman
, respectively
) that fails to improve the series one iota
-
- like its precedessor
, species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel adn instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid
. the film follows yhe exploits ofthe a young man
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, whose sole focus is on cruising allong the streets in order to pik up womens
, loitering in strip clubs
, anbd generaly trying to bed as many different ladies as he possably cin
. in otehr words
, patrick is liuke a lot of guys
; these activities could describe teh everyday routines of a huge precentage of men his age
,
but there
' s a catch
-
- he
' s an astronaut who recently returned from a seamingly sucessful mission to mars
,
and who
' s now infected with aline dna
. patrick
' s overriding compulsion
: to mate
and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring
.
and when he becomes aware of eve
( natasha henstridge
)
, a half
- human
, half
- alien clone of teh monster from the frist film being studied in a govornment lab
, patrick
' s primary focus turns to her
-
-
" if these two were to mate
, the resulting pure strain ofthe offspring owudl be unstoppable
" warns dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, gamely reprising her role
) with admirable conviction
. speices ii opens with the mars mission
,
and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing anbd hokey
- looking
, even splicing back tothe dated
, grainy footage of actual spacecraft activites
-
- htey relaly skimped on prodcution values thsi time arund
.
however
, thsi all looks positively inpsired wehn compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo whic ultimately infests patrick
; watching as it slinks around yhe comm
and module of tje spaceship
, any question as tothe whther or not this is a cheesy b
- movie is quickly anwsered
. mr
. brancato
' s original screenplay isnt filled wtih outrageous lines which often leaves tyhe audiance infront stitches
. like the first film
(
and perhaps in homage to it
)
, there
' s a real penchant for dialogue whic underlines the obvious
. last timne around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forrest whitaker
' s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room
-
-
" something bad happened here
.
" this time
, laura gets to st
and over a fresh
, shredded corpse with its entails ripped outloud
and mutter
" this is awful
.
" adn she
' s not even empathic
!
and wehn a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper adn drags her kicking
and screaming behind the buidling in a woefully
- paced suspense sequence
, eve
, who
' s telepathically linked to her alien
/ human
- hybrid counterpart
( whatever
)
, helpfully tells our aline
- hunting protagonists
,
" he
' s going to rape her
.
" hwile speices ii is oftenly unintentionally hilarious
, at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour ofthe its pwn
. ther
' s an amusing
, tongue
- in
- cheek bited of product placement
( which doesn
' t realyl make much sense
,
but i appreciated the sentiment
)
, as well as some supermarket
- related hijinx
(
" he
' s in aisle 1
!
" informs eve
)
. if the film maintained this sort ofthe light
- hearted tone
, it would hvea beeen much more charming
and enjoyable to watch
,
but
, to its detrement
, it instade takes its silly plot far too seriously
and barrels allong to a bloody
, effects
- ladened anticlimactic conclusion
. much of the film fails to make a wohle lot of sense
,
and ther are such gaping plot holes that it
' s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief
. the implausibilities are endless
: what about the toxic bomb iin eve
' s brain
? why are yhe guards armed withthe guns wehn they already know firearms are ineffectual
? my favourite wass the slow
- motion sequence in the film where eve
, sporting superhuman strength
, is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting tothe contain her wtih whta look like body blocks
. this is the sort of movie which leaves ytou holding your head in amazed disbelief
, incredulous that it
' s being foisted apon the publich
. retruning headlines michael madsen
( who reprises tough guy press lennox
)
and ms
. helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay
, bu ther
' s realistically only so much one can dont with htis scirpt as a basis
. mykelti williamson
( portraing astronaut dennis gamble
) churns outloud an all
- too
- familiar spin onthe a generic brash
- mouthed charachter
,
and fine charachter actors george dzundza
( playing colonel burgess adn looking rediculous in the proccess
) annd james cromwell
( patrick
' s neglectful father
, senator ross
) are utterly wasted infact the film
. mr
. lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty
- eyed look
, while returning vixen ms
. henstridge is actually given hte opportunity tothe ect in one scene
(
and acquits herself nicely
)
,
but isnt mostly relegated tothe reprising her familliar role of parading about iin skimpy clothing
( or none at all
)
. ms
. henstridge recently commented onthe how smoe female audiences have expressed appreciation for her charater in yhe first entry of the species series
, claiming that
" she
' s so empowered
.
" a lethal half
- aline in heat who dispatches ofthe her sexual partners iin grotesque fashion
-
- now
* that
' s
* what i call empowerment
