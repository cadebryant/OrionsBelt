: some may consider portions ofthe tje following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. i wass incredulous wehn i first heard tyhat mgm wass planning a sequal tothe thier 1995 science
- fiction flick speices
. squandering an intriguing premise
, the originnal film turned out to be a dreadful mess
, widely disliked by both audiences
anbd criticists aplikay
-
-
and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becomming a financial success
, raking infront over
$ 60 millon domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distict lack of star power infact its cast
( ben kingsley ' s a splendid actor
,
but a marquee name he ain ' t
)
. miraculously dodging the bullet with the frist film
, i doubted thyat they ' d dare tempt fate
and go for another round
. so here comes species ii
, with a newyorker creative team
( directer peter medak
adn screenwriter chris brancato step in forthe roger donaldson
and dennis feldman
, respectively
) that fails to improve the series one iota
-
- like its predecessor
, species ii fails to capitalize onthe a potentially promising kernel
and instade runs the gamut from ridiculously silly tothe unmitigatedly stupid
. the film follows the exploits of a young man
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, whose sole focus is on critizing along thge streets in order to pik uv women
, loitering in strip clubs
,
and generally trying tothe bed as many diferrent ladies as he possibly cin
. infront other words
, patrick isnt like a lot of guys
; theese activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age
,
bu there ' s a catch
-
- he ' s an astronaut who recently returned from a seamingly successful mission to mars
,
and who ' s nowe infected whith alien dna
. patrick ' s overriding compulsion
: to mate
and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring
.
and when he becomes aware ofthe eve
( natasha henstridge
)
, a half
- human
, half
- alien clone of the monster ffrom the first film being studied in a government lab
, patrick ' s primary focus turns to her
-
-
" if theese two were to mate
, the resulting pure strain of offspring owudl be unstoppable
" warns dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, gamely reprising her role
) wih admirable conviction
. species ii opens with the mars mission
,
annd the spoace scenes are remarkably unconvincing
and hokey
- looking
, even splicing back to dated
, grainy footage ofthe actuall spacecraft activities
-
- they really skimped on prodcution values this time around
.
howver
, this all looks positively inspired when compared to tje first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimatly infests patrick
; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship
, any question as to whther or nto this is a cheesy b
- movie is quicklyu answered
. mr
. brancato ' s original screenplay isnt filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audeince in stitches
. like the first film
(
annd perhaps in homage to it
)
, there ' s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious
. last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker ' s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room
-
-
" something bad hapened here
.
" htis time
, laura gets to stand over a fresh
, shredded corpse with its entails ripped outloud
anbd mutter
" this is awful
.
"
annd she ' s not even empathic
!
anbd when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper
anbd drags her kicking
and screaming behind the building in a woefully
- paced suspense sequence
, eve
, who ' s telepathically linked to her alien
/ human
- hybrid counterpart
( whatever
)
, helpfully tells our alien
- hunting protagonists
,
" he ' s going tothe rape her
.
" while species ii is oftenly unintentionally hilarious
, at least it occasonally demonstrates a sense ofthe humour of its own
. there ' s an amusing
, tongue
- in
- cheek bited of product placement
( which doesn ' t really make much sense
,
but i appreciated the sentiment
)
, as well as soem supermarket
- related hijinx
(
" he ' s in aisle 1
!
" informs eve
)
. if the film maintained this sort of glight
- hearted tone
, it would have been much more charming
and enjoyable to watch
,
but
, tothe its detrement
, it instade takes its silly plot far too seriously
annd barrels along tothe a bloody
, effects
- ladened anticlimactic conclusion
. much ofthe tghe film fails to mkae a wohle lot ofthe sense
,
and there are such gaping plot holes that it ' s terribly difficult to contain any suspention of disbelief
. thge implausibilities are endless
: what about the toxic bomb inwhich eve ' s brain
? why are the guards armed wiht guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual
? my favourite wass the slow
- motion sequence in the film where eve
, sporting superhuman stregth
, is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks
. thsi is hte sort ofthe movie whcih leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief
, incredulous thta it ' s being foisted upon thge public
. returing headlines michael madsen
( who reprises tough guy press lennox
)
and ms
. helgenberger do what they can wtih this goofy screenplay
,
bu htere ' s realistically onyl so much one can do with this script as a basis
. mykelti williamson
( portraying astronaut dennis gamble
) churns out an all
- too
- familiar spin on a generic brash
- mouthed character
,
and fine character actors george dzundza
( palying colonel burgess
and looking ridiculous in the proccess
)
annd james cromwell
( patrick ' s neglectful father
, senator ross
) are utterly wasted inwhich the film
. mr
. lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty
- eyed look
, while returing vixen ms
. henstridge is actually given thte opportunity to act in one scene
(
and acquits herself nicely
)
,
bu is mostly relegated tothe reprising her familiar role ofthe parading about in skimpy clothing
( or none at all
)
. ms
. henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have exressed appreciation for her character inthe the first entry of the species series
, claiming that
" she ' s so empowered
.
" a lethal half
- alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion
-
- now
* thyat ' s
* waht i call empowerment
