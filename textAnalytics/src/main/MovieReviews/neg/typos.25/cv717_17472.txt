starring arnold schwarzenegger
; danny devito
; emma thompson
& frank langella the only thing taht you cxan sday baout junior is that it is a dissappointment
, anbd a big one at that
. junior brings toghether arnold schwarzenegger
and danny devito with director ivan reitman
. theese are the smae men that brought us the very funny twins
. so foolish me
, i was hoping for something that owudl at least come close to tyhe level of quality ofthe twins
. so much for hopes
. schwarzenegger
and devito play two scientists
( doctors hesse
and arbogast
) who are working on a newyorker drug that will reduce the possibility ofthe miscarriage infact pregnancy
. unfortunately
, due to circumstances beyond thier control
, they are denied permission to test tihs new drug onthe humans
,
and subsequently loose thier funding
. still believing that their drug iwll wokr
, they decide to tust it anyway
, onthe hesse
. so
, dr
. hesse
( schwarzenegger
) artificially inseminates himself
and begins taking thge drug
. their theery is that if the drug cant prevent a man from miscarrying
, surely it will wokr on a woman
. does yhe throught ofthe arnold schwarzenegger pregnant soudn funny or humorous tothe you
? well
, it must have tothe the producers of junior
. admitedly
, schwarzenegger has the comedic talent tothe pull it off
. perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actualyl been funny
. bu it wasn
' t
, schwarzenegger pregnant isnt goofy at best
. the sight ofthe schwarzenegger runing arround gogin through the hormone imbalances thta come withthe pregancy
,
and the accompanying emotional swings
, is not funny
. schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics
. i kept thingking to mysef
, iwth the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been mkaing an acation picture
. better yot
, with schwarzenegger
, devito
and reitman all infront the same place at the smae time
, why didn
' t they make a sequel to twins
? anything would hve been better than this mess
. danny devito is wasted in this movei
. his part could have been played by any joker htey pulled in off the street
.
( after seeing the movei
, if i was devito
, i probably would ahve wished they hadnt pulled someone in off the street
.
) emma thompson is wasted here as well
. while thompson isnt best known for her jane austin adaptations
, she isnt also a fine comedian
. too bad she didn
' t git to use any of that talent here
. am i being too hard on this film
? i don
' t htikn so
. schwarzenegger
and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today
,
and ivan reitman is one ofthe the omre talented directors in hollywood
. with a supporting cast ofthe emma thompson
and frank langella
, thte filmmakers really have to be trying hard tothe make a bad film
. they certainly managed here
. maybe it wass well intentioned
,
but unfortunately this is a movie that never should hvea been made
. if you are tempted to see htis film
, do yourself a favor annd go rent twins
, a film that truly tkaes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger
and danny devito
' s commedic talents
.
