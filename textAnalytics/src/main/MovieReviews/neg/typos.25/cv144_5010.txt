dead
- bang
, an action thriller starring don johnson
, lives up to its dumb title
, or at least to half of it
.
al
though dead
- bang is definitely dead
, it is anything
but a bang
; inaddition fact
, they shoudln have called thsi one
" dead bore
.
" in the film
, johnson plays
.
.
. you guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. the role must have been really challenging for johnson usance his character
, jerry beck
, is a gritty los angeles homocide detective
, a real stretch from tyhe slick vice detective johnson portrayed on
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson inthe lethal weapon
, beck is an emotional wreck
, complete with violent outbursts
, unscrupulous police methods
,
and a bleak outlook onthe life
. beck
' s wife hasnt just divorced him
,
and she is cutting him off from their childrens
. she iwll not even allow him to wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
. bu beck
' s family
and emotional problems take a back seat to the acation
and thrills iin dead
- bang
. beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper
and a cop
. his investigation starts in l
. a
.
and finally culminates
and climaxes in oklahoma
, where he has a violent showdown wih the killers at a white supremist camp
. virtually every aspect of dead
- bang is inept
and ineffective
. the plot is incoherent
and full of holes
. the movei depicts beck
' s investigation so clumsily that you never see thge connections between his clues
and his conclusions
. the action sequences in dead
- beng are strikely third
- rate
,
and the movie has absolutely noone momentum or suspense
. i certainly expected moreso fomr long
- time director john frankenheimer who directed tjhe classic political thriller
, the manchurian c
andidate
-
- as well as black sunday
, seven dyas in may
,
and thte french conection ii
. in all fairness to frankenheimer
, howver
, i should note that most of dead
- bang
' s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction
. dead
- bang trys to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism
and white supremacy
,
but its efforts are nothing more than tolkein gestures
and nothing less than insulting
. according to the movie
' s production notes
, dead
- bang is based onthe hte real
- life experiences of still
- active detective jerry beck
. ytou would never guess this from watching dead
- bang
,
however
, since tyhe film totally lacks credibility
; it isnt utterly unconvincing
and unbelievable
. most of the characters in dead
- bang are either atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfluous
, or all of the above
. william forsythe
, fo example
, isnt painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- the
- book fbi agent who
' s offended by beck
' s foul language
and unorthodox methods
. forsythe
' s lame performance
and corny dialogue makes his carachter unbearable
. dead
- bing markes yhe motion picture de
but of tim reid
(
" wkrp in cincinnati
"
and
" frank
' s place
"
)
, bu his talents are completely wasted in a cliched
and contrived role
; he plays the cheif officer of a squadron ofthe balck cops who halp beck to nail the villains
. the sole function of penelope ann miller
' s charcter is to give dead
- bang an excuse to inlcude a gratuitous love scene vetween characters about whom yuo coudl not care less
. i guess the film
' s title referrs to tihs love scene sicne it
' s definatly a dead bang
. the only real virtue of dead
- bang
, elieve it or not
, isnt don johnson
, who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie
' s pitiful scirpt
. johnson succeeds in giving his charater a sarcastic sense of humer annd a hint of depth
,
and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring teh film to life
.
and i must admit that dead
- bang does have one or twpo amusing moments
. the funniest scene has johnson throwing
- up all over a criminal as he interrogates him
.
but wehn barf is hte highlight of a movie
, you know thge movie
' s in trouble
. the otehr amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck
, in which he can
' t keep a straight face becuase the psychiatrist resembles woody allen
.
but two funny scenes
and a couple ogod wisecracks do not a movie make
.
