dead
- bing
, an action thriller starring don johnson
, lives up to its dumb title
, or at least to half ofthe it
.
althought dead
- bang is definitely dead
, it is anytying
but a beng
; in fatc
, they should ahev called this one
" dead bore
.
" iin the film
, johnson plays
.
.
. yuo guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. the role must have beeen really challenging forthe johnson since his charactor
, jerry beck
, is a gritty los angeles homocide detective
, a real stretch from yhe slick vice detective johnson portrayed onthe
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson inaddition lethal weapon
, beck is an emotional wreck
, complete with voilent outbursts
, unscrupulous police methods
,
and a obleek outlook onthe life
. beck ' s wief hasnt jstu divorced him
,
and she is cutting him off from their children
. she will not even allow him tothe wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
.
but beck ' s family
and emotional problems take a back seat to the action
and thrills infront dead
- bang
. beck is investigating teh brutal murders ofthe a shopkeeper
and a cop
. his investigation starts in l
. a
.
and finaly culminates
annd climaxes in oklahoma
, where he has a voilent showdown witht tyhe killers at a white supremacist camp
. virtually every aspect of dead
- bang is inept
and ineffective
. tyhe plot is incoherent
and full of holes
. the movie depicts beck ' s investigation so clumsily thyat yuo never see the connections between his clues
and his conclusions
. the acation sequences in dead
- bing are strictly third
- rate
,
and teh movie hasnt absolutely no momentum or suspense
. i certainly expected more from long
- time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller
, the manchurian candidate
-
- as well as black sunday
, seven days in may
,
and thte french connection ii
. in all fairness to frankenheimer
,
howver
, i should note that most of dead
- beng ' s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby scirpt rether than ffrom yhe direction
. dead
- bang trys to don a mask ofthe social relevance by incorporating themes of racism
adn white supremacy
,
bu its efforts are nothing more than token gestures
and nothing less than insulting
. according to tyhe movie ' s prodcution notes
, dead
- bang isnt based on tjhe real
- life experiences of still
- active detective jerry beck
. you would never guess this from watching dead
- bang
,
however
, since tyhe film totally lacks credibility
; it is utterly unconvincing
and unbelievable
. most of the charachters infront dead
- bang are eather atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfluous
, or all of the above
. william forsythe
, for example
, is painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- the
- book fbi agent who ' s offended by beck ' s foul language
and unorthodox methods
. forsythe ' s lame performance
adn corny dialogue makes his character unbearable
. dead
- beng marks the motion picture debut of tim reid
(
" wkrp infront cincinnati
"
and
" frank ' s place
"
)
,
but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched
and contrived role
; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains
. the sole function of penelope ann miller ' s carachter is to give dead
- bang an excuse tothe includ a gratuitious love scene between characters about whom ytou could nto care less
. i guess the film ' s title referrs to this love scene since it ' s definitely a dead bang
. the only real virtue of dead
- beng
, eblieve it or not
, is don johnson
, who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie ' s pitiful script
. johnson suceeds in giving his chracter a sarcastic sense of humor
anbd a hint ofthe depth
,
anbd his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film tothe life
.
and i must admit that dead
- bang does hvea oen or two amusing moments
. the funniest scene has johnson throwing
- uv all over a criminal as he interrogates him
.
but when barf isnt the highlight of a movei
, you know yhe movie ' s inthe trouble
. the otehr amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck
, in which he can ' t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen
.
but twpo funny scenes
and a couple good wisecracks do nto a movei amke
.
