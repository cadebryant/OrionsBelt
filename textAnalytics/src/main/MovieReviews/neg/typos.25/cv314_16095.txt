since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993
' s steven spielberg drama
" schindler
' s list
"
and directed 1993
' s intelligent
" searching fo bobby fischer
,
" his new film
,
" a civil action
,
" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep infront an otherwise prosperous career
. what doesn
' t make sence is how such high
- profile
and superb actors as john travolta
, robert duvall
, william h
. macy
,
and kathleen quinlan got involved in tihs project
, which is both dull
and completelyl ineffective
. the film
, which involves a small community of childrens who mysteriously died of leukemia
, certainly contains the tipe ofthe story to be emotionally
- charged
,
but somehow all signs ofthe feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings
, leaving us with nothing more tahn a poorly
- done courtroom drama
. based on a book by jonathan hart
, which was consequently based onthe a true account
,
" a civil action
" is set in 1982 in the town ofthe woburn
, mass
.
, where personel injury lawyer jan schlictmann
( john travolta
) decides to take onthe the case of eight families who simply wanna an apology for theri children
' s death fomr leukemia due to unknown causes
. jan originially decides to drop the case
,
but when he stumbles accros to corporate giants
, grace
and beatrice foods
, who have plants located near the families
' homes
, he sees all of tghe pieces suddenly fall into place
: the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals inot the nearby lake which
, thus
, goes into tghe city
' s drinking water
. suddenly
, after hearing about the families
' heartbreak
and personal storie
, he begins to care for them
and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery
, even
though he isnt warned by his stff accountant
( william h
. macy
) that no mony is coming in tothe them
, only going out
. also figuring inot the tsory is jerome facher
( robert duvall
)
, beatrice foods
' corporate counsel
, who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his
$ 20
- million offer tothe settle the case
. comming from such a talented writer
, director
, adn casted
, nto to mention one of the most interesting film composers
, danny elfman
,
" a civil action
" is an astoundingly empty
- headed drama
, noe that includes an intriguing story
and somehow transforms it inot an admitedly tiresome
and occasionally even boring expierence
. perhaps oney of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture
, zaillian hasnt misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an abcense of magnetism
and even meaning
. watching tjhe film
, i couldn
' t help
but notice its similarities with 1997
' s far
, far superior film
" the sweet hereafter
,
" which dealt with a lawyer
, played brilliantly by ian holm
, investigating a school bus accident thgat killed a number of children
. infront his attemts to fidn someone who may ahve beeen responsible forthe the accident
, holm interviews the grieving parents
, as well as the sole surviving passenger
, a teenage girl
, which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter
, a young drug
- addict who has run away fomr home
. not only was the plotting similar to
" a civil acation
,
"
but it aslo had the smae exact running time ofthe 115 minutes
. considering this
, it isnt amazing how fulfilling
and truthful
" a sweet hereafter
" was
, not only concentrating onthe teh school bus accident
,
but delving deeply into ian holm
' s character
and his own personal demons
, as well as the teenage girl
. infact
" a civil acation
,
" howver
, i have noone idea where the running tiem went
, since the film is virtualy two hours of nothingness
. we do nto get to nkow the parents very well
, nor any of hte main charachters
. through its whole duration
, i did not learn one thign
_
_ not one thing
_
_ baout travolta
' s lawyer character
, jan schlictmann
, who doesn
' t apeared to hve any sort ofthe life or purpose outside of his job
. every scene is tediously realted driectly to the premise
,
and therefore
, there ws no one for me to care about or root fo
. ytou
' ve got to work pretty hard
, actually
, to not get an audience tothe become involved inspite the parents
' plight
, since their childen are dead
,
but that is exactly whta
" a civil action
" does
. to be honest
, i would be fairly hard
- pressed tothe state an aspect ofthe the film that i catually liked
. aside from noe flashback to whn a man
' s young son died on thte way to the doctor
, i remained unmoved
and passive baout what was going onthe inthe the scenes
, anbd more thna once found my mind w
andering
. i sould say the performances weere good
,
but who
' s fooling who
? since eveyr character is one
- dimensionally written
, no one
' s acting abilities are challanged in any way
. travolta plays a lawyer well enough
,
but that
' s about all he does
. duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role
, apparently only appearing tothe give one
- liners at every chance he gets
. annd what infront the world is kathy bates doing in the picture
' s final scene
, as a judge
? she appears unbilled
, since it is just a cameo
, bu why did she even agress to do it iin the frist place
? finally
, when the conclusion arrived
and the end credits began to role
, tyhe film left me with another question
: what was the point
? abruptly endig without any susceptible momentum
, where none came before thta to begin with
,
" a civil action
" seemed to me
, at least
, to be an exemple of how nto to make a courtroom drama
,
and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals whith
.
