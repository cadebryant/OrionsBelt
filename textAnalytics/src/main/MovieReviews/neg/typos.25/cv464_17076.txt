. review by
: geoff berkshire i
' m not an overly cynical guy
. there hve been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the eyars
. howver
, i have my limits
and i alsot have st
andars
. this brings us to the subject at h
and
: message in a bottle
, the big ticket romance that warner brothers
' unleashed apon tghe movie going publich just in time for valentine
' s day
. the story
, what little ofthe it that there isnt
, involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne
( robin wright
- penn
) dealing with her recent divorce
and trying to raise her young son jason
( jesse james
)
. during a brief stay somwhere in new engl
and she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by hte ocean
. the letter
, written tothe a mystery woman named catherine
, instantly captivates her
. upon her return
, theresa shares it withthe her best friend lina
( illeana douglas
)
, her boss charlie
( robbie coltrane
)
,
and the entire city ofthe chicago
( the newspaper publishes an artical baout it
)
. it turns outloud that the message was wroten by grieving widower garret blake
( kevin costner
)
and so theresa travels to north carolina adn tracks him down
. he turns outloud tothe have a colorful father
( paul newman
)
but is otherwise perfectly dull annd overly obsessed with sailing
. this isnt somehow attractive to theresa
and the two beign their awkward courtship
. of course she doesn
' t tell him that she found his letter
, she wants to
but the rules of this type ofthe film require him to find out later
( preferably right after they firt make love
)
. this way garret can get veyr angry
and the relationship can be threatened
. tyhe discovery of thte message anbd garret
' s discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the onyl two noteworthy events that appen during the nearly two
and a quarter hour running time of thsi film
. there
' s a truly lame subplot about garret
' s relatiopnship with his dead wife
' s family
( he gets into a bar fight with her brother
, played by john savage
)
and
then the necessary tear
- jerking ending
. a fun way to pass the tyme isnt tothe take bets onthe exactly who iwll die
,
al
though it becomes pretty clear by the second reel
. the actuall death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced
, anbd unintentionally humorous
, sequences filmed usance
.
.
. well
, since costner
' s the postman
( 1997
)
. message inaddition a bottle is oen slow moving film
. last year audiences were offred endurance tests such as the horse whisperer
and meet joe balck
but both of thsoe films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this
. they also hadnt redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances
and some st
and outloud technical wokr
. message infront a bottle has a decent enough cast
but they
' re fighting thge material all the way
,
and losing badly
. costner
and
, especially
, wright
- penn are both likable
and attractive enough to cheer forthe
but theri characters are simply too boring
. they also fail tothe generate any kind ofthe real romantic chemistry
. the supporting players are given very little tothe do
. the reliable douglas is particulalry wasted
. old pro newman gives his all annd occasionally threatens to kick some life into tihs dead horse of a film
. a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played
. howver
, too frequently he jsut reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are
. the film isnt veyr polished on the technical side tothe be sure bu it only works to undercut the story
. gabriel yared
, who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient
( 1996
)
and city of angels
( 1998
) with his scores
, overdoes it a bited here
. caleb deschanel
' s camera makes everything look a little too beautiful
. do the offices of the chicago tribune raelly need to look heavenly
? the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not onyl considering all tht sould have been cut out
but isnt also simpley messy at times
. the real offender here is screenwrighter gerald di pego
. wroking from a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( which i hve not read bu ahev beeen told isnt on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county
)
, di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts ofthe recent times
. its strict adherence tothe clich
? s brings tothe mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer
( 1998
)
. there simply isn
' t an origonal scene in this film
. tyhe dialogue is rarely better than laughable
and thsi is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character tkaes while speaking
. this is director m
andoki
' s first film since when a man loves a woman
( 1994
)
, the solid meg ryan
/
andy garcia romance
. he
' s simpley going through the motions with this
. message in a bottle is easily thge worst of the several romantic offereings avalable inspite theaters at tghe moment anbd vies wiht what dreams may come
( 1998
) as one ofthe the most misguided romances of the decade
.
