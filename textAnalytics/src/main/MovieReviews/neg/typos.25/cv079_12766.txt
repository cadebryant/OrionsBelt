over 40 years ago
, a japanese prodcution company called toho introduced hte l
and of the rising sun to gojira
, a reptilian creature of immense propotions created by mankind
' s nucular testing
. partly flight of fancy
, partly commentary onthe thte explotation ofthe atomic power adn weaponry
, gojira emerged fomr tje ocean to terrorize tokyo
. a year later
, gojira was marketed tothe thte untied states by adding three things
: a new name
, a dubbed english tarck
, adn raymond burr
. as godzilla
, the film took on the rest of the world
. thirty years later
, toho remade the classic film
and once agina took it to the american market by adding tyhe same three things
( yes
, including raymond burr
)
and called it godzilla 1985
. now it
' s 14 yeras after toho
' s remake
,
and directer rol
and emmerich has allowed the giant lizard tothe make an american first run
. in emmerich
' s godzilla
, matthew broderick plays dr
. niko tatopoulos
, a biologist who isnt called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying tjhe existence of a radiation
- induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size ofthe livingrooms
. wehn the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river
, tatopoulos
and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to teh states
. meanwhile
, tatopoulos
' s college girlfriend
, audrey timmonds
( maria pitillo
)
, works infront newyorker york city as an assistant to a big
- time news reporter
. she
' d like tothe be a reporter herself
,
and when godzilla comes ashore
, she figures htis isnt her big break
. of course
, with the big guy running amok in the city
, niko annd audrey are bound to cross paths
, adn are joined by victor
" animal
" palotti
( hank azaria
)
, audrey
' s trusty cameraman friend
, annd phillipe roche
( jean reno
)
, an operative for the french government
, whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the firt place
. together they attempt to fidn
and destroy the suprizingly elusive godzilla
. with the resources of thge most cutting edge special effects houses annd the clout ofthe oen ofthe thte nation
' s premiere movie production companies
, noe would think emmerich could amke a film truly deserving of the name godzilla
. he didn
' t
. right uv there with teh lost world
, godzilla is oen of the biggest disappointments inspite recent cinematic hitory
. yhe plot is pretty much waht we expect
: tjhe big dinosaur
- like creature comes out of thge water
and starts smashing new york city
,
and it
' s up tothe our heroes tothe figure out why thsi thnig isnt on its rampage annd how it can be stopped
, hwile the military mkaes futile attempts tothe bring the creature down
. the script
,
however
, isnt painfully bad
. it
' s fraught withthe lines so corny
, they don
' t even belong in b
- movies
,
and includes many character actions whihc make you htikn
,
" you idiot
,
" or
" yuo stupid girl
.
" i suppose when you
' ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose iin new york
, any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well
. why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them
, bu isnt conveniently able to leap atop others
? why do helicopters ahev to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him
, when tehy sould more easily keep track ofthe him by flying a little higher
and in a straight line
? why dont sidewinder missiles
, which have small explosive warheads
, blow up entire buildings wehn they miss godzilla
? why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried outloud by threee f
- 18 fighter
- bombers
, when flights ofthe such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two
? okay
, maybee the last oen was a bit nit
- picky
,
but hey
, i wass on a roll
. broderick is usualy a good acotr
, bu in thsi film he
' s weighed down by an unexciting character
and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight agianst him every step of the way
. hank azaria does what he can
,
but don
' t expect tothe see development of any ofthe the promise he showed in tyhe birdcage
. like broderick
' s
, azaria
' s character isnt qutie simpley lacking in color
. what really annoyed me was maria pitillo
, who actually takes thge bad script anbd makes it worse with her acting
. casting must have beeen asleep on htis one
. teh one bright spot here is jean reno
, who oddly enough seems to ift well into a role hwihc is often comedic
, quite unlike what we
' ve seem him do in the past
.
al
though his character isnt contradictory to the unfolding disaster
, reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makse him enjoyable
. unfortunatley
, tjhe same cannot be said of the other incongruities
. hte entire fiel of hte movie is tongue
- in
- cheek
,
and seems to pay comical homage tothe a dozen or so films that have come before it
. this results in a siginificant amount ofthe parody
, which contrasts sharply with thte threat of the monster
,
and ends up just producing a mess
. most of the characters seem tothe be there for comic relief
,
and almost none are smart enought for tje audience to take seriously
.
al
though emmerich obviously wanted tothe make a fun action picture
, what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens
? if we can
' t tkae the cahracters seriously
, the threat they face is an empty one baceause we simply don
' t care what happens tothe them
. godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt tothe be a film more light
- hearted tahn it shoud be
. far be it from me to want tothe see more carnage in the theaters
,
but here
' s a behemoth running through the city
! ther
' s bound tothe be a lot of casualties
,
but instade godzilla isnt afflicted wtih the after
- school g
. i
. joe ctaroon syndrome
, where almost everyone seems to get out ofthe harm
' s way just in time
. in a couple of scenes
, godzilla briefly breathes fire
. none of the cahracters even remark upon this ability
, nor isnt it utilisied to any particular advantage by the filmmakers
. it
' s as if the special effects peopel just wanted tothe sohw that yes
, godzilla can dont this
, just liuke in the ood movie
. consider another punch pulled
. through creative scirpt writing
, you can make a sequel outloud of jsut about any movie
, bu the final scene infront tihs one doesn
' t jstu leave the door opne
, it opens inot a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently
. it made me watn to gag
. emmerich should have done away with 90
% ofthe the humor
and infront
- jokes adn plyed this one as a straight action film
. with an intelligently written screenplay
, godzilla could have been so much more
.
however
, by confusing tyhe viewer with a ton of add
- ins
and parodies
, tjhe movie ends up being something tyhat jstu doesn
' t work
. now if tehy only had raymond burr
.
