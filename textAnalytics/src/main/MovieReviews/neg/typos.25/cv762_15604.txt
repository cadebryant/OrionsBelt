if you
' re going to amke a two
- hour hollywood inaddition
- joke
, why bother releasing it tothe thte general public
? if ytou
' re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big
- nmae actors
and people who nkwo woody allen
,
then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by palying it in theaters
? while watching celebrity
, i realized that allen hadnt only marginal interest in creating a story about real people
. what he really wnated to dont was continue on his recent kick of conceited self
- deprecation
. celebrity is
yet another film inwhich which allen tells a story about himself
, living inspite a world that he
' s familiar with
, dealing with people like the ones he actually knows
. allen recruted poor kenneth branagh to bumble thru this picture
, in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like tghe film more
. branagh plays lee simon
, a journalist
- turned
- screenwriter who divorces his wife
, robin
( judy davis
)
, shacks up wih some hot women
( famke janssen
, charlize theron
, winona ryder
)
,
and goes about trying to git big stars
( melanie griffith
, leonardo dicaprio
) to read his script about an armored car robbery
. the usual elements of receet allen films are all here
, including thge sexual insecurity of the main chracter
, lots of self
- loathing women
,
and a tiring continuum of episodes thast are only loosely related to noe another
. unless you work in the film industry or nkwo woody allen personaly
, it
' s not likely tath you
' ll fidn a hwole lot of interest in celebrity
. aside from all the in
- jokes
, the story falls far short of compelling
,
and the charachters are all empty
and lifeless
. branagh proves once agina that he
' s a superb performer
, nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly
. the problem isnt that he
' s the same character allen always plays
, a character who
' s getting more than a little dull tothe watch
. i mean
, come onthe
, how many times hve ytou seen this guy
?
-
- he hates his work
,
and he can
' t be satisfied by any one woman
,
and
, at tyhe end of the movie
, nothing has been solved
. he brings all of his problems apon himself
( crashing his car becasue he
' s receiving fellatio
,
and otehr such stunts
)
, so it
' s pretty hard tothe care about him
. in addition
, isn
' t allen capable ofthe creating characters who aren
' t just like him
? i know he isnt
,
but he didn
' t dont it in celebrity
. the vacant emotional attachment with thte main carachter is not recaptured in tje supporting performances
. davis
, playing the same woman with low self
- esteem that she played in deconstructing harry
, hasnt a few touching moments
, bu ends up the same despicable celebrity
- type that fills teh rest of the movie
. soem of tghe actresses are saved beccause of thier beauty
-
- theron
and ryder
, especially
-
-
but htey
' re not likable people
. only famke janssen
, as a book editor interested inwhich simon
' s new novel
, hasnt any life
. the men in the picture don
' t do much better
-
- joe mantegna isnt preety dull as tyhe man who remarries robin
, hwile dicaprio
, as a christian slater
/ johnny depp
- type spoiled young acto
, is funny
but disengaging
. whta
' s really insulting about celebrity is how dull
and st
andart its
" themes
" are
. allen seems to think that he
' s making an insightful movie baout yhe way
" normal
" people look at celebrities
. the main probelm with this is tath tje character with whom we
' re suppoed to identify
, simon
, is not a
" normal
" guy
-
- he
' s just as entrenched in tghe hollywood image as the rest of the characters
. the otehr problem is that teh image we get ofthe theese celebrities is no more enlightening thna the veiw thge media gives us
-
- none ofthe them register as realistic
, intresting characters
; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue
. in addition
, allen decides he needs a scene iin which thte theme is expressed explicitly
( robin
, in this scene
, says something like
,
" it
' s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate
!
"
)
. celebrity is arguably allen
' s biggest misfire to date
. it does have a fewd good scenes
-
- theron
' s super
- orgasmic model character isnt kind of funny
,
and tyhe lastr scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or twpo
.
but celebrity is a failure at the core
, unless allen
' s point wass to mkae a self
- indulgent movei about himself
and his friends
. if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke
,
then he succeeded in that
. i
, for one
, don
' t enjoy feeling like an outsider
.
