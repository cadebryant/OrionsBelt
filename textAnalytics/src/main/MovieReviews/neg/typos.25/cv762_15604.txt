if you ' re going to make a twpo
- hour hollywood in
- joke
, why bother releasing it to the general public
? if you ' re gogin to create a film thast will appeal primarily to big
- name actors
and peple who know woody allen
,
then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters
? while watching celebrity
, i realized tht allen had onyl marginal interst in creating a story baout real peple
. what he realy wanted to do was continue onthe his recent kick of conceited self
- deprecation
. celebrity is
yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself
, living in a world that he ' s familliar with
, dealing with peopel liek the ones he actually knwos
. allen recruited poor kenneth branagh tothe bumble thru this picture
, iin an imitation of allen so perfect taht it almost made me liuke the film more
. branagh plays lee simon
, a journalist
- turned
- screenwriter who divorces his wife
, robin
( judy davis
)
, shacks up with some hot womens
( famke janssen
, charlize theron
, winona ryder
)
,
anbd goes baout trying to get big stars
( melanie griffith
, leonardo dicaprio
) to read his script baout an armored car robbery
. the usual elements of reccent allen films are all here
, including the sexual insecurity of the main character
, lots of self
- loathing women
,
and a tiring contimuim ofthe epidsodes taht are only loosely related to oen another
. unless you owrk infact the film industry or know woody allen personally
, it ' s not likely thta you ' ll find a whole lot ofthe interest in celebrity
. asside from all the inthe
- jokes
, the stroy falls far short of compelling
,
and the characters are all empty
and lifeless
. branagh proves once again that he ' s a superb performer
, nailing his immitation of allen flawlessly
. the problem is tht he ' s tyhe smae charactor allen always plays
, a chracter who ' s getting more thna a little dull to watch
. i mean
, come on
, how many times haev you seen this guy
?
-
- he hates his work
,
and he cin ' t be satisfied by any one woman
,
and
, at tghe end of the movie
, nothing hasnt been solved
. he brings all of his problems upon himself
( crashing his car beacuse he ' s receiving fellatio
,
and other such stunts
)
, so it ' s preety hard to care about him
. inaddition addtion
, isn ' t allen capable of creating characters who aren ' t just liek him
? i know he is
,
but he didn ' t do it in celebrity
. the vacent emotional attachment with tjhe main charactor is nto recaptured infront the supporting performances
. davis
, playing the smae woman with low self
- esteem that she played infact deconstructing harry
, hasnt a few touching moments
,
bu ends up thge smae dispicable celebrity
- type that fills the rest of the movei
. some ofthe tjhe actresses are saved because of their beauty
-
- theron
and ryder
, especially
-
-
but htey ' re not likable people
. onyl famke janssen
, as a book editor interested in simon ' s new novel
, hasnt any life
. the men inthe thte picture don ' t do much better
-
- joe mantegna is pretty dull as hte man who remarries robin
, while dicaprio
, as a christian slater
/ johnny depp
- tipe spoiled young actor
, is funny
but disengaging
. what ' s really insulting baout celebrity is how dull
anbd standard its
" themes
" are
. allen seems to think that he ' s making an insightful movie about tjhe way
" normal
" people look at celebrities
. the main problem with this is that thge charcter withthe whom we ' re supposed to idenify
, simon
, isnt not a
" normal
" guy
-
- he ' s just as entrenched inaddition the hollywood image as the rest of the characters
. tjhe other problem is thyat the image we get of theese celebrities is noone moreso enlightening thna the view the media gives us
-
- none of them register as realistic
, interesting charachters
; htey mostly jsut function as set pieces fo boring dialogue
. in addition
, allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly
( robin
, in htis scene
, says something liuke
,
" it ' s interesting to see teh way we all look at hte people we celebrate
!
"
)
. celebrity is arguably allen ' s biggest misfire tothe date
. it doesnt have a few good scenes
-
- theron ' s super
- orgasmic model character is kind ofthe funny
,
and yhe last scene might have been moving had the rest ofthe tyhe film shown us a character or two
.
but celebrity is a failure at the core
, unless allen ' s point wass to make a self
- indulgent movie baout himself
and his friends
. if he wanted to make his audience fiel liuke they were on the outside of a big joke
,
thn he succeeded inthe that
. i
, for one
, don ' t enjoy feeling liuke an outsider
.
