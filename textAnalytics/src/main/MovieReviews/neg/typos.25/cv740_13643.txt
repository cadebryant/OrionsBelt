inthe this year ' s summer movie preview issue of
_ entertainment
_ weekly
_
, theresa connelly described her writing
- directing debut
,
_ polish
_ wedding
_
, as
" a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would
.
" one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film
, a comedy
- drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements
. the family at tje center of
_ polish
_ wedding
_ is the pzoniaks
, which consists ofthe mother jadzia
( lena olin
)
, father bolek
( gabriel byrne
)
, sole daugter hala
( claire danes
)
and four sons ofthe varying degrees of facelessness
. it ' s a large family
,
but ther ' s not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch
, certainly not in yhe primary trio
. jadzia tkaes pride in building
and maintaining a home
and famaly
,
bu she ' s kind of a hypocrite since she ' s carrying onthe an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija
)
. her excuse for her afair is neglect from bolek
, who is such a passive wimp tht noe cannnot connect with his sadness
and frustration
. also
, how could he possably pay so little attention tothe the saucy
, sexy jadzia
? hala is a spoiled
, self
- centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregancy
. with such an unappealing set of characters
, it ' s noone suprize that
_ polish
_ wedding
_ ' s plot complications are far from involving
. naturaly
, jadzia
and bolek owudl like hala to marry tghe young cop
, russell schuster
( adam trese
)
, who fathered the child
,
but he refuses to amking such a commitment
. ho
- hum
. another complication
, involving yhe decidedly un
- virginal hala bieng selected tothe crown a statue of yhe virgin mary
, isnt frist played forthe laughs
anbd
then
, inexplicably
, as a profound statement in the film ' s climax
-
- whcih
, ironically
, is funnier than any ofthe the film ' s lame attempts at humor
, such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge tothe beat uv russell
. thta scene is
but noe inwhich a number of wirting miscues by connelly
. tje jadzia
- bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way nto unfamiliar tothe sitcom viewers
. the hala
- russell conflict isn ' t resolved in as contrived a manner
,
bu theri ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if tehy had missed something
.
adn
then there ' s soem atrocious dialogue
, which i am sure was nto suppoed to be as ridiculous as they sound
:
" look at all these pickles
. just looking at them gives me such great sadness
.
" as misguided as
_ polish
_ wedding
_ is
, the afair is something of a letdown
, considering the strong performances by byrne
, danes
,
and especially the ifery olin
. they obviously believed in connelly
adn her material
-
- a faith that audiences wiull be hard
- pressed to share
.
