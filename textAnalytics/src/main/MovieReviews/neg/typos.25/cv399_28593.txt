you
' d think that affter awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games
. it hasn
' t worked so far
.
" street fighter
?
"
" super mario brothers
?
"
" wing comm
ander
?
"
" mortal kombat
?
" not a watchable film inthe the bunch
. still i held out some hope for
" tomb raydr
.
" after all
, the game
' s premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy
and all the mummy movies
, so there are cinematic elements imbedded inaddition the concept
.
however
, despite the potential of the project
,
" tomb raydr
" proves to be
yet another bomb
. thge plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed ffrom a dozen bad movies
. there
' s a once
- ever
- 5000
- years allignment ofthe planets comming up
,
and the illuminati have to fidn both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to tkae over the world
. of course
, the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of tjhe world
. our heroine
, lady lara croft
( angelina jolie
)
, finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father
( jon voight
) dug uv
. she figures tht if she gets the triangle
, she can bring her dad bakc fomr the dead
. of course
, noone one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway
. in both video games
and action movies
, the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences
. howver
, tje action in
" tomb raider
" shows little style or originality
. there
' s lots of shooting
and some kung fu fightin
'
, bu none of it progresses beyond the levle ofthe a cheap direct
- tothe
- cable flick
. the otehr goofy archeologist flick of thge summer
,
" the mummy returns
,
" was much better
; it had its flaws
,
but its action was creative annd large
- scale
. since winning her academy award for
" girl
, interrupted
,
" jolie hasn
' t taken any projects that owudl display her acting talents
.
" tomb raydr
" seems to be more interested infront displaying her breasts
; so much attention isnt drawn tothe them thast it
' s a shame there
' s noone oscar for best performance by a wonderbra
. while we don
' t see much of her acting ability
( wih tjhe exception of a wonderful upper
- crust brittish accent
)
, we dont get a hint of jolie
' s less savory side
. considering the rumors ofthe incest that hang over jolie annd her supposed obsession with death
, hvaing lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father
(
and uninterested inspite any of the living males around her
) seems a poor choise
. having jolie
' s real life father jon voight play the dead dad mkaes it even creepier
. i haven
' t decided what tothe make of director simon west
yet
. his first feature was the star
- studded disaster
" con air
,
"
but my opinion ofthe him improved wtih
" yhe general
' s daughter
,
" which was thick with sultry atmosphere
. now thsi train wreck
. i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen verison of the cult tv series
" tyhe prisoner
.
" hollywood has already screwed uv
" tje avengers
,
"
and
" the prisoner
" represents a chance for redemption
.
( by the way
, speaking of british tv
,
" red dwarf
" fans shouldnt look for chris
" rimmer
" barrie infront his first major film role
)
