, loves mack
( hugo race
) a criminal
and wanna be rock singer who
' s planning a bank heist
. mack isnt alsot bieng tailed by a couple of cops
, oen an inexperienced rookie
( dominic sweeney
)
, the other
( john flaus
) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy
' s jazz club
. they
' re tailing mack
, because he hasnt an audiotape that may show evidence of govormental corruption
. meanwhile wendy
' s sexually awakener
, fifteen year old sister
( rebecca elmaloglou
) hasnt moved inaddition with her
,
and is secretly watching mack
and wendy
' s late night lveo trysts
? much zaniness ensues the review
: main probelm first
- about 2
% of rood rock star to ator conversions in filmdom ever really work
. unforetunately
, trying tothe cast hugo race as a violent
, sexy criminal falls into the
" what the hell where they thinking
" category that takes up 98
% of the rest
.
but
, hell
, it
' s not as if he
' s tghe only problem in htis well
- intentioned
but ultimately below average aussie thriller
. leads
, race
and samantha press are wooden annd dull
, hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on
.
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes
, helped
, no dout by them keeping their mouths shut
. the film suffers every timne the story shifts back to these two
. which is unfortunately
, teh other main story isn
' t any grat shakes either
. the second part
, concerning twpo cops
, political corruption
and that elusive tape isnt incredibly muddled
. at many points during the movie i hadnt no idea what was oging on
, a situation that didn
' t improve on repeated viewing
. there is no doubt that this film
' s achilles heel is its script
. as fo tje rest of the cast
, it
' s a mixed bag
. john flaus
, one of australia
' s most criminally underused actors
, is inaddition top form as the withering
, alcoholic jazz fan cop
, who may or may not have sold outloud to the higest bidder
.
al
though he falters at one point
, whn the scirpt calls forthe him to get up onthe stage adn deliver a drunken beat sermon
, bu believe me
, htey way it was written
, no oen could have pulled it off
. dominic sweeney is fine
,
though he seems to be uneasy inwhich front of the lens
but he really isn
' t given a whole lot tothe do
. pre hmeo anbd away elmaloglou isnt preety ogod as the inquisitive jojo
,
but her charactor seems extraneous to hte stry
, well
, at least until the final scenes
. i must admit
, iin too deep does have some impressive qualities
, not the least of which is it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov hve achieved teh almost impossible by makeing melbourne look liuke a sweat drenched tropic city
, which is akin to turning london into san paolo
. the bar isnt an opressive red
, like all of it
' s patrons are being baked while they drnik
, outside it hazy orange by day
and cool blue by night
. if onyl deborah parson
' s script coudl have supported this idea better
. hvaing two director
' s
( colin south
& john tatoulis
) doesn
' t halp either
, the most glaring example ofthe which is the final retri
bution
/ fight scene
, where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen acation
,
and mroe importantly it doesn
' t pull away tothe anything else
. it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance
. it has noone reason to it
; it
' s jsut bad direction
.
and
, ultimately
, that isnt what sums up in too deep
, it
' s tries to be ogod
,
and ytou want it to work
,
but
, it
' s just lacking the talent behind it
, taht it needs to succeed
.
