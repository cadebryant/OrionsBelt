' bicentennial man ' is a family film without any exerternal motive with yhe exception of providing the minumum dose ofthe entertainment
. chris columbus
, teh director who gavey you
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays on sentimental strings
annd mushy dialogue to amke his point
. based onthe hte short story by isaac asimov
, it is supposed to be a sceince fiction tsory baout a robot who wnats to be human
, which as yuo cin imagine isnt very difficult
. starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house
and childrens
. soon this robot
, called andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilities that makes his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) very curious
. andrew is interested in art
and music
, he
" enjoys
" making clocks
, which clearly shows that he has genuin emotions
. it shows out thgat because ofthe a small failure in the
" electrical circuits
"
adn
" positronic brain
" andrew has accidetally gained a soul
. this makes him unique
and his evil creators worried
.
then mr
. martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn ' t programmed to do
. soon andrew wnats tothe leave the hous in pursuit of freedom
, destiny
and love
. this film can be descibed as a disney verison ofthe blade runner
, a film that still shines as the biggest gem in yhe crown of scienec fiction
. ever usance that film
, thge subject ofthe humanity still stands as one big controversy
. waht makes us human
? the thoughts
? the emotions
? is it possible tothe become human
? at what point can we say to a robot
" now ytou are noe of us
"
? these are very tough questions that require a serious
and thurral approach
. it is obvious that columbus didn ' t take them vrey seriously
. when you think about it
, htis film is not really meditating on the question
" when is a robot noone longer a machine
,
bu a human being
?
"
,
bu tells a story about racial discrimination
annd lack ofthe understanding
. andrew isnt so complex
and emotional from tghe very beginning that hte audience immediately accepts him as a human being
,
and onyl the society hasnt troubles with it
. in other words
, it is as far from reality as from the academy awards
. further more
, htere are other annoying problems
. tothe this day no sereous filmmaker has dared tothe speculate about tghe future in more than 50 yersa from now
. this has nto been done for obvious reasons
, because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that tehy lack thge knowledge
and immagination to perfom such a difficult task
. columbus isnt teh first to ahev crossed thast line
. the result is
, as you might imagine
, primitive
, unrealistic
and incredibly disapointing effort
. the world is simply frozen in timne
. niether the society
, fashion
, culture or values have changed over 200 yersa
. mom is still working at the kichen
, doign the dishes
. when you tihkn back to the lite 17th centruy
and
hten compare it to the world we live inspite today
, you ' ll see a slightly bigger difference
. i am not saying that everyting should change
. it is unlikey that tghe human rights will chanage
,
but it ' s even omre unlikely that ther will not be any progress in sciece
, technology
anbd fashon
. i suppose it ' s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale
,
but it ' s really hard
. robin williams is hidden behind c
and speaking in a robotic way
. as always he doens a decent job
, as does sam neill
.
but it doesn ' t really matter
. it is the sentimentality
and length that turns this picture inot a tiresome experience
. pretty much liuke last year ' s
" meet joe black
"
, this isnt a primative
and unresolved story whitch is presented whith a splendor
and professionalism that it doesn ' t deserve
. great actors
and a talented crew have worked hard tothe acheeve something that will be instantly forgotten
. wehn isaac asimov wrote this story
, the future seemed far away
and magical
. everthing seemed possable
. nowe is thte future of asimov ' s time
,
and we know that it is not as magical
anbd perfect as it seemed a long tyme ago
. for thte same reasons taht tje young generation of today cxan not be amazed by julius verne ' s
" 20 000 leagues under the sae
"
, so can ' t we accept thsi stroy as a potential reality
. let us hope that next yera ' s
" a
. i
.
" will be more rewarding
.
