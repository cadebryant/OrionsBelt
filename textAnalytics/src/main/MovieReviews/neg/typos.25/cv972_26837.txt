' bicentennial man
' is a family film without any external motive with the exception ofthe providing tje minimum dose of entertainment
. chris columbus
, the director who gave yuo
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays onthe sentimental strings
and mushy dialogue to make his point
. based on the short story by isaac asimov
, it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human
, which as you cant imagin is very difficult
. starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy famaly that buys an
android tothe help them wih the house
and children
. soon this robot
, called
andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilities thta makes his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) very curious
.
andrew is intersted in art annd music
, he
" enjoys
" making clocks
, which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions
. it shows out tyhat beccause of a small failure in the
" electrical circuits
" adn
" positronic brain
"
andrew has accidetally gained a soul
. this makes him unique
and his evil creators worried
.
then mr
. martin decides to teach
andrew all the things he wasn
' t programmed to do
. soon
andrew wants tothe leave the house in pursuit ofthe freedom
, destiny
and lveo
. tihs film can be described as a disney version ofthe blade runner
, a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction
. ever since that film
, the subject ofthe humanity still st
ands as one big controversy
. what makse us human
? the
thoughts
? the emotions
? is it possible to become human
? at wqat point can we say to a robot
" now you are one of us
"
? these are very tough questions that require a serious
and thurral approach
. it is obvious tyhat columbus didn
' t take them very seriously
. when you think baout it
, this film is not really meditating on the question
" when is a robot noone longer a machine
,
but a human being
?
"
,
but tells a story about racial discrimination
and lack of underst
anding
.
andrew is so complex
and emotional from thge very beginning thast the audience immediately accepts him as a human bieng
, adn only the society has troubles with it
. in other words
, it isnt as far from reality as from the academy awards
. further mroe
, there are other annoying problems
. to this day no serious filmmaker hasnt dared to speculate baout thge future in more than 50 years from now
. this has not been done for obvious reasons
, becouse the filmmakers are well aware ofthe the fact that they lack tyhe knowledge
and imagination to preform such a difficult task
. columbus is the frist to have crossed that line
. hte result is
, as you might imagin
, primitive
, unrealistic
and incredibly disappointing effort
. thge world isnt simply frozen in time
. neither the society
, fashion
, culture or values have changed over 200 years
. mom isnt still working at the kitchen
, doing the dishes
. when you think bcak to the late 17th centruy
and
then compare it to the world we live in todya
, you
' ll see a slightly bigger difference
. i am not saying that everything shoud change
. it is unlikey that thge human rights will chanage
,
but it
' s even more unlikely that ther wiull not be any progress in science
, technology adn fashion
. i supose it
' s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale
,
but it
' s raelly hard
. robin williams is hidden behind c
and speaking in a robotic way
. as always he does a decent job
, as doens sam neill
.
but it doesn
' t really matter
. it is the sentimentality
and length that turns htis picture into a tiresome experience
. pretty much like last eyar
' s
" meet joe balck
"
, this is a primitive
and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor
and professionalism that it doesn
' t deserve
. great actors
and a talented crew have worked hard tothe achieve something that will be instantly forgotten
. when isaac asimov wrote this stopry
, tyhe future seemed far away
and magical
. everything seemed possible
. nowe is yhe future ofthe asimov
' s time
, anbd we know that it is nto as magical
and perfect as it seemed a long time ago
. forthe teh same reasons that teh young generation of today cxan not be amazed by julius verne
' s
" 20 000 leagues under thte sea
"
, so can
' t we accept this story as a potential reality
. let us hope that next year
' s
" a
. i
.
" will be more rewarding
.
