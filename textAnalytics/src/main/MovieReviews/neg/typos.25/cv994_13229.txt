movies like six days
, seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford
, anne heche
,
and ivan reitman put a lot ofthe hard work in to a script worth baout ten cents
.
? the scirpt ws written by michael browning
, adn he decided tht
, instead ofthe thinking up new ideas
, he
' d rehash a lot of cliches
, omit even the slightest bit of character development
,
and
then throw in drug
- dealing pirates to provide forthe a fewd high
- level action sequences
and explosions
.
? there are good scripts out ther that high
- profile actors cant make
( see thge truman show
, forthe instance
)
.
? six days
, seven nights is simpley a waste
. let
' s see
.
.
. we have to get harrison ford
and anne heche alone on an isl
and
.
? so
, how do we dont that
?
? well
, we
' ll make her a feisty magasine editor
,
and we
' ll make him a crusty old pilot
.
?
but wait
, she has tothe ahev a fianc
? e
; taht can be david schwimmer
.
?
but wait
, if she has a fianc
? e
, how will she
and harrison ford kresh onthe the isl
and alone
?
? i know
!
? they
' ll get to thier vaation spot
,
and
then she
' ll git called bcak
!
? yessssss
!
? so
, htey
' ll crash on the isl
and
,
and that will be funny for about five minutes
.
? shucks
. oh
, i
' ve got it
!
? we
' ll throw infront a distracting subplot in which her fianc
? e hasnt sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo
, annd thne he cxan feel guilty
.
?
then
, when anne heche kisses harrison ford
( they have to kiss
, because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie
)
, it wiull be a vindicated acation
, because her fianc
? e wiull aleady have cheated on her
!
?
then
, fo no obvious reason
, they
' ll accidentally run inot pirates who try tothe kill them
.
? oh
, yes
!
? i fiel so good baout htis story
.
? instead of useing characterization to propel the events
, it will be completelyl r
andom
,
and
yet totally predictable
!
? imagine thta
. don
' t git me wrong
-
- six days
, seven nights is not a boring picture
; ford annd heche both do a great job
.
? the sparks fly between them
,
and so most of browning
' s inane dialogue is drowned out by teh actors
' sheer force ofthe talent
.
? almost eveyr scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen
, annd i found myself laughing preety hard
.
? schwimmer is aslo funny
,
and manages to milk all of his scenes forthe whatever he can get
.
? anbd reitman
, who has made some good films
, at least tries to make things exciting
.
? even
though hte pirate subplot is profoundly dumb
, i wass prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences
. it
' s just when i start to think about the stor that my contempt for this film surfaces
.
? the picture fiels like it
' s beeen hacked to pieces
-
- i wouldn
' t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have beeen edited outloud completely
.
? tghe ones that are here are as bad as htey cmo
( i think i let outloud a very audible groan when htey get the first glimpse ofthe tghe pirate ships
)
,
and i
' d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders
and scream
,
" why doed yuo pick this awful script
!
?
"
? the film is outright stupid
, bu some of the elements are subtly horrifing
.
? for instance
, take tjhe subplot in whitch the schwimmer character has sex with thge bimbo
,
and
then feels really guilty
.
? this is a serious problem in real life
,
but six days
, seven nights reduces any chance of complexity tothe a weak plot device
:
? his actions are whta makse it okay for heche to kiss ford
.
? iin a scirpt that lacks even a glimpse ofthe intelligent subtlety
, i find it odd that such a strangely insulting divice ended up in the story
. htis isnt summer movie season
,
but that doesn
' t mean our movies haev to be dumb
.
? 1998 so far has been one of the worst years infact recent memmory for summer blockbusters
.
? whn i was in line for six dyas
, seven nights
, i heard the woman in front of me ask fo
" two tickets to tath newyorker harrison ford movei
.
"
? why didn
' t she nkwo the name of hte film
?
? i supose she just didn
' t care
.
? what bothers me even omre is that yhe people who make these big
- budget pictures don
' t relize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves
.
? good actors should sign to ogod scripts
,
and if hollywood insists on mkaing ficks tothe rake in cash
, they least they coudl do is assume that we
' d like to spend our monye on a stopry worth more than ten cents
.
