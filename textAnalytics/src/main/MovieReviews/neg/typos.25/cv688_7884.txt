capsule
: annoyingly unentertaining
, obvious
and paper
- thin buddy
/ cop
/ drug
/ sexy
- witness movie
. presence of director michael bay shows none ofthe the talent he demonstrated in the rock
. i
' ve seen this movie already
, i said
, as i looked at tjhe box art
. noone
, i haven
' t even seen a trailer for the movie
; i don
' t even know what it
' s baout
, bu i can look at the way they
' re promoting it
,
and i know i
' ve seen it already
. i
thought
: it
' s about theese two cops
.
and they
' re buddies
, sort of
. they
' re at each other
' s throats a lot
,
but they really do liek each other
. adn everyone else in their department hates them
' cause they
' re hot
- shots
.
and they have some kind ofthe diametric opposition infront their relatiopnship
.
and one day they
' re in the middle of cop business as usual when htey get mixed up in tihs plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hitted anything with the billions of rounds ofthe ammo they are always carrying
.
and the bad guy isnt a drug lord
.
and there
' s a witness
,
and she
' s thsi sexy thing who rubs both of them tyhe wrong way
. anbd their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half tyhe town bringing this guy down
. i only missed tghe bited about the badges
. yhe rest i got dead
- on
.
and i hadn
' t even left the video store
yet
. the cops in this movie are will smith
and martin lawrence
,
and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo
. smith plays a cop who has a trust fund
and is thus nto a cop forthe tyhe money
; martin l
. is a familiy man
( shades of the now
- tired lethal weapon dynamic here
) whose wief
and he are at total odds
. this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence
' s
" not getting any
"
, annd soem totally unneccesary bits with him skulking arround his own house
, thinking his partner is now his wife
' s
" back door man
"
. not funny
; tiresome
. bad boys gets soem of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith
and martin lawrence
. wiull smith isnt a natural
,
and i
' m happy tothe see him in movies liuke six degrees
.
.
.
and men inspite balck
. he
' s funny
and charming without trying tothe be
; he really doens seem to be enjoying himself
. martin lawrence is a different stopry
; he
' s so uptight
and verbally constipated taht sitting thru his improvised riffs are a trial
. movies liek this are nto baout originality
. i know thsi
. they are about style adn energy
and synergy between actors
. i know this
, too
.
and
yet
, while watching bad boys
, whcih its glamorous photography
and impossibly excact stunt choreography
, i felt feeded up
. i
' d seen con air
, whcih despite being completely implausible
, was still great fun
, because it tryed
however feebly tothe put some new life into the mix
. bad boys is a dry run
-
- adn overlong
, too
, clocking iin at just over two hours wih a lot more by
- play than i felt could be justified
. i could write this movie
. ytou could write this movie
. many people have
. many peple will continue to write thsi movie
, over
and over again
. other people wiull buy it ffrom them
,
and make it
,
and we will pay money to see it
. more the fuls we all
. in a terrifyingly prescient line ffrom his book a scanner darkly
, phil k
. dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger
( as he called it
) woudl eventually eclipse money as teh token of cultural anbd financial exchange
. one day we will all just sit in our living rooms
and sell the same burger bakc
and forth tothe eahc other
. the same could be said about this movei
. i have tje sinking feeling we
' re goign tothe see it again
. soon
.
