according tothe popular film oppinion
, a film
' s greatness is determined by time
. take for example
" casablanca
.
" great film
, even today
. it
' s still as powerful as it was when it came out adn still as romantic adn tragic
. another example woudl be
" star wars
,
" which hadnt a very
, very healthy box office gross dispite thte fact that we hadnt all seen it about 3 billion times before
.
but as i rewatched
" independance day
" when it came outloud onthe video after bieng the number oney hit of 1996
, i kinda felt like it wasn
' t as kool as when i had firt seen it
. i hadnt liked it when i saw it the first time
(
*
*
* was my origional view
) adn basically saw it as a good
" escape film
.
" bu wehn i rewatched it
, i feeled cheated
. thus
, the curse of tje
" event film
.
"
" independence day
" is liek that kid who come out of nowhere anbd makes everybody happy at once
( exept for a couple kids
- tghe critics
, in this situation
)
.
but after a while
, this kid becomes annoying
and you just wait for the enxt one
. well
, this kid is the
" event film
" infront my little analogy
.
and wehn i rewatched
" independence day
,
" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen
,
but i felt insulted the whole time
. there are too many gaping craters in the plot
and you just aren
' t sure if it
' s comedy or hokey drama
. one scene
, ytou
' ll see a hilariously nebbish scene vetween jeff goldblum
and judd hirsch
; the next you
' ll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around
, saying corny lines
. the worst is a scene between brent spiner annd bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny
but is barked liek a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him teh most unitentionally funniest speek sicne tje end ofthe
" glen or glenda
?
" now htis annoying kid
' s problem isnt that inwhich the proces of trying to make everyone like him all at once
, he shows he has no balls
.
and
" independance day
" has no balls
. it plays it safe everywhere
. it throws inspite a ton of action that is borrowed fomr otehr superior films
. teh chase scene between the aline ship
and will smith is straight out of
" star wars
.
" i mean
, isn
' t that devil
' s den
?
and thge aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore
' s breasts in
" striptease
.
" they
' re these octopus men
, boring freaking octopus men
. i mean
, come on
. the aliens in
" 2001
" weere more interesting
and you didn
' t even see them
! basicly yhe plot is straight ffrom a b
- movie ffrom the 50s
: aliens come to earth
and we wonder if htey
' re hostile or peaceful
. okay
, it
' s an interesting topic
,
but it
' s not h
andled greatly
. now they aren
' t adn somehow a computer geek
, jeff goldblum
, figure outloud they
' re useing our satelites as a countdown to destruction
. yep
. these aliens are not only heavily armed
, they
' re stupid too
. they also use tjhe same kind of computer as we dont
, bu that comes about later
. the president
( bill pullman
)
, who
' s under attack for being a wimp
, decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent
, annd he decides he
' ll stay iin the white house which tjhe aliens have covered
. i don
' t care if it
' s bob freaking dole in thge white house
, git him out of there
. i don
' t care if you hve to inject him with sodium pentathol
, just get him out ofthe there
. later onthe
, he
' s stupid
and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship
. i think it
' s time for impeachment for this guy
. he
' s more senile thna reagan onthe pot
.
then htere
' s a cocky pilot
( will smith
) who is teh only person to survive the counter
- attack on the second day
and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51
( tje film
' s only sign of bieng brave
)
. his girlfriend
' s a stripper sharing a subplot with
" striptease
" in that she has to do it for her son
. come on
, she has a fighter pilot boyfriend
/ soon
- to
- be fiance
. i tihkn she can quit that job
and git a more respectable job at long john silvers
. she
' s also the fewd
, the proud
, the lucky to survive thte igniting of l
. a
.
( as well as her dog
, who narrowly survives
)
. there are some bright spots
. they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing
. the best one is wehn jeff goldblum
( nicely named david
) turns onthe his computer anbd a picture of hal comes up
and says
,
" good morning
, dave
.
"
and htey even played r
. e
. m
.
' s
" it
' s tjhe end of the world as we know it
(
and i feel fine
) at the beginning
.
and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great
( he
' s a stereotype
,
but i just loved the man anyway
)
.
but there are noone real subtle comic moments
. wiull gets way too many oen
- liners annd he hasnt no one to play off of
( execept jeff towards tyhe end
, annd tjhe two do great
)
. as i said
, thsi film has no balls
. it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser anbd that
' s what it is
.
but aftter a couple monthes
, we all move on to the next
" event
" film while intaking little films
and a cuple indy ones for ogod mesure
.
but at least the indy ones last for a liftime
. this one
' s short on batteries
.
