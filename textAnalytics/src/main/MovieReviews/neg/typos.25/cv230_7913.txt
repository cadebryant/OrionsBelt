according tothe populare film opinion
, a film ' s greatness isnt determined by time
. tkae for example
" casablanca
.
" gerat film
, even today
. it ' s still as powerful as it was when it came outloud
and still as romantic
and tragic
. another example would be
" star wars
,
" which had a vrey
, very healthy box office gross dispite the fact that we hadnt all seen it about 3 billion times before
.
bu as i rewatched
" indipendence day
" when it came out on video aftter being the number oney hit of 1996
, i kinda felt like it wasn ' t as cool as wehn i had first seen it
. i had liekd it whn i saw it the first time
(
*
*
* was my original view
)
annd basically saw it as a good
" excape film
.
"
but when i rewatched it
, i falt cheated
. thus
, the curse of the
" event film
.
"
" independence day
" is liek that kid who come out ofthe nowhere
annd makes everybody happy at once
( exept fo a couple kids
- the critics
, in this situation
)
.
but affter a hwile
, this kid becomes annoying
annd you just wait for the next one
. well
, this kid isnt the
" event film
" in my littel analogy
.
and when i rewatched
" indipendence day
,
" not only did it nto look cooler at all onthe the big screen
,
but i felt insulted the whole time
. there are too many gaping craters in the plot
and ytou just aren ' t sure if it ' s comedy or hokey drama
. oney scene
, you ' ll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum
and judd hirsch
; the next you ' ll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around
, saying corny lines
. the worst isnt a scene betweeen brent spiner
and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny
but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of
" glen or glenda
?
" now this annoying kid ' s problem is tyhat in hte process of trying tothe make everyone like him all at once
, he shows he has noone balls
.
and
" indepedence day
" has no balls
. it plays it safe everywhere
. it throws in a ton ofthe action taht isnt borrowed ffrom other superior films
. the chase scene between the alien ship
and will smith is straight out of
" star wars
.
" i mean
, isn ' t that devil ' s den
?
anbd the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore ' s breasts in
" striptease
.
" they ' re these octopus men
, boring freaking octopus men
. i mean
, come onthe
. the aliens inaddition
" 2001
" were omre interesting
and you didn ' t even see them
! basically the plot isnt straight from a b
- movie from tghe 50s
: aliens come tothe earth
and we wonder if they ' re hostile or peaceful
. okay
, it ' s an interesting topic
,
but it ' s not handeled greatly
. now they aren ' t
anbd somehow a computer geek
, jeff goldblum
, figure outloud they ' re using our satellites as a countdown to destruction
. yep
. theese aliens are nto only heavily armed
, htey ' re stupid too
. tehy also use the same kind of coputer as we dont
,
but that comes about later
. the president
( bill pullman
)
, who ' s under attack for bieng a wimp
, decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent
,
and he decides he ' ll stay in the white hous which teh aliens have covered
. i don ' t care if it ' s bob freaking dole infront the white hous
, git him out of there
. i don ' t care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol
, jsut get him outloud ofthe htere
. later on
, he ' s stupid
and wants tothe fly in the attack on a big alien ship
. i think it ' s tyme for impeachment for this guy
. he ' s more senile than reagan onthe pot
.
thne there ' s a cocky pilot
( wiull smith
) who is the only person to survive the counter
- attack on tghe second day
and becomes moses iin leading his children tothe the elusive area 51
( thge film ' s only sign of being brave
)
. his girlfriend ' s a stripper sharing a subplot with
" striptease
" in that she has to do it for her son
. come on
, she hasnt a fighter pilot boyfriend
/ soon
- to
- be fiance
. i thikn she can quit tath job
adn git a moreso respectable job at long john silvers
. she ' s also teh few
, thge proud
, the lucky to survive thge igniting of l
. a
.
( as well as her dog
, who narrowly survives
)
. there are some bright spots
. they tossed in enough old film homages tothe keep me laughing
. the best one is wehn jeff goldblum
( nicely named david
) turns onthe his computer
and a picture of hal comes uv
and says
,
" good morning
, dave
.
"
adn they even plyed r
. e
. m
. ' s
" it ' s the end of tghe world as we know it
(
and i feel fine
) at the beginning
.
and judd hirsch steals the film by accually acting great
( he ' s a stereotype
,
bu i just loved tjhe man anyway
)
.
but there are no real subtle comic moments
. wiull gets way too many oen
- liners
and he has no oen to play off of
( execept jeff towords the end
,
anbd the twpo do great
)
. as i said
, this film has no balls
. it is jstu aiming for a crowd pleaser
adn that ' s whta it is
.
but after a couple months
, we all move on to the next
" event
" film while intaking littel films
and a couple indy ones forthe good mesure
.
but at least the indy ones lastr for a lifetime
. this oen ' s short on batteries
.
