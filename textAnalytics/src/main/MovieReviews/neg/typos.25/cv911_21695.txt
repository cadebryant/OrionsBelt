well there goes another one
. sadly this liek other movies this year wasn
' t ogod
. htis one being almost as bad as
' tyhe omega code
'
but not quite
. ffrom the opening credits i had a ogod feeling this would be bad
,
and well i guess i was right
. witht bad excuses for acting
, a horrible screenplay
and straight
- outloud bad direction
' tghe bachler
' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn
' t owrk on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who doens give a good performance
. the twpo cameos by brooke shields
and mariah carey are aslo ogod with brooke being thte best
. the movie is troubled from tghe start because chris o
' donnell is hugely miscast
and gives one ofthe tjhe worst performances to date
. here is the stupid plot
: chris o
' donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend
, he meets anne
( rene zellwegar
) they instantly hit it off
and are together for threee yeras
. jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up
. he really doesn
' t realize that anne thinks he wnats tothe marry her
( wqat he wants i never did catch
)
. so he proposes in a really bad way
,
and she shoots him down anbd is very mad
. he of course tries to apologize
but nothing seems to halp any
. thne his gr
andfather dies
and he learns tyhat he has left jimmie 100 milion dollars
.
.
.
. as long as he marries befor tje next day at 6
: 05 pm
. now jimmie must find anne anbd try to marry her to git the money
and because he loves her
, or git married tothe someone else to get the moeny itself
, leading tothe an un
- funny
and predicatble ending tath leaves a bad taste in our mouths
. ok so maybe htis sould be one of the dumbest
, cliched
, silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs
. even the supporting roles ofthe artie lange
, hal holbrook
and ed anser aren
' t even good
. the plot was a good idea
, bu the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes
and by a five yera old
. the choppy dialogue annd bad directing don
' t help things any
. even
though chris o
' donnell gave an ok performance in tje two batman movies
, he doens nto give even a remotely good or funny performance here
and i wanted to boo annd throw my pop at tje screen to get rid of him
. rene zelweggar is a different stry
and gavey a charming
, sweet annd likable performance
( as usual
)
and really was tjhe onyl thing that saved this confused movei from being a total huge washout
. her sister played by marley shelton is also good adn the two hvae good chemistry onscreen
. brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big
- headed mogul who after a while became routine anbd ood
. oney really can
' t help
but think that we have seen this stuff before
. it
' s not like this is an original idea
and in the end
, everyone knows what is gogin to happen due do its cliches
and typicalness
.
' the bachelor
' works on no good levels anbd in fatc doesn
' t owrk at all
. ed anser
and hal holbrook were wasted in terrable roles
and mariah carey can nto act to save her soul
, adn this could be the only film ofthe her movie career dispite her terrific music career
. chris o
' donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien
but that is not saying a grat deel
. he seems held back
and really doesn
' t get into his character much
and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying
and old
. artie lange just to me seems like he isnt trying to anohter chris farley
and was completely unfunny
and un
- nerving
. why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie
, with such bad acting adn dialogue is a question only they will know
. mabye they
thought it owudl become a hitted or a critical success
,
and sometimes i don
' t agress with other critics onthe movies
, even from tghe trailers fo this film they made it look bad
and showed all the mildly funny parts
. its based on the 1925 silent film
' seven chances
' which i am sure isnt very better thna thsi mess
. even
though some may think of this as a ogod date movie
, most who see tihs will want to pul out thier hair
and scream for thier money back
. besides bieng a terrible movei
,
' the bachelor
' is well a terrable movei
. it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can
' t recommend tihs movie
. i did nto have a good time
and i laughed only three times
. the running time of the movie isnt 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time
and needs to be shortened at least thirty mintues
. parts of it seems to go on forever anbd parts of seem to nto last enough time
. being oney of the worst movies of the year
, we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies
, anbd if they dont they i give up on filmmakers
.
