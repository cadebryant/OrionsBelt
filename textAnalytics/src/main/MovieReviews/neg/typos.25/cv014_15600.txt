she was the femme in
" la femme nikita
.
" he wass the baldwin in
" backdraft
,
"
" sliver
,
" adn
" fair game
"
( with cindy crawford
)
. together
, anne parillaud
and william baldwin conspire to amking
" shattered image
" the biggest piece of hooey sicne the stallone
/ stone
" thriller
"
" the specialist
.
" the film poses the question
" what if the life you
' re living nowe is really a dream
,
and your dreams reality
?
" it
' s either about a woman who
' s haunted by a recurring
( anbd recurring
and recurring
) nightmare that she
' s a hired assassin
, or it
' s about a hired assassin who
' s haunted by a recurring
( adn recurring
and recurring
) nightmare thgat she
' s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica
. it doesn
' t much marter
and believe me by the time
" shattered image
" runs its painful
and pedestrian course ytou won
' t care
. these two lives
, with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a balck wig
, black emotionless eyes
,
and black leather clothing in tjhe seattle
- based assassin scenes
,
and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes
, play out endlessly throughout the film
and the result is it
' s now
* twice
* as boring as it might have been
. it
' s not that complicated plots can
' t be entertaining
. of course it helps if you have interesting charachters
, crisp dialogue
,
and a modicum of sytle
.
" shattered image
" isn
' t complex
, it
' s just stupid
.
and boring
. parillaud anbd baldwin
, who aren
' t exactly shakespearean material to begin with
, are saddled wiht such leaden dialogue that theri characters hve zero chance of breaking free of thier cardboard confines
. lines like
:
" yuo don
' t beg
, you insist
. i like that in a woman
.
" that
' s parillaud
' s character talking
.
.
. tothe her cat
! adn
:
" yuo
' re not the reason i couldn
' t care less about ytou
.
" huh
?
and this wonderfull bathroom interchange eearly in the film
:
" if yuo give me a couple of minutes you know i
' ll charm the pants off yuo
.
"
" i don
' t hvea that kind of time
.
" tlaking of pants
, parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say
" point of no return
.
" we have come tothe expect thsi from billy baldwin
, bu it might have been nice to haev learned something baout their characters first
.
but there
' s nothing tothe learn
. karen isnt as intresting as a cereal box
, a someone
' s
- out
- to
- get
- me crybaby who imagines the voice at tyhe other end of the phone
, the stranger who sends her flowers
, maybe even her husb
and himself
, is her would
- be killer
. siouxsie isnt the chromium cool
, tough
- as
- nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors inwhich order to justify the film
' s meaningless stock title
. baldwin seems omre interested infact parillaud
' s nest egg
( so that he can pave paradise adn put up a parking lot
) tahn he does in her
. each time graham greene shows uv he gets killed
. barbet schroeder
(
" reversal ofthe fortune
"
) co
- produced
and should be ashamed of himself
. every now
and again it
' s fun to watch a really bad movie
.
and every now
and agian
, as
" shattered image
" makes agonizingly clear
, it isn
' t
.
