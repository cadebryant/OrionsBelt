htere ' s only one presidential election every four years
,
but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as
_ the
_ thriller of the year
. in 1997
, we ' ve had absolute power
, air force one
, shadow conspiracy
and muder at 1600
. this oen is about as lame duck as old gerald ford
, trying tothe bring us a complex plot of cover
- up
and intrigue
but copping outloud over
and over again with rehashes of acation flick standbys
. here ' s what happens htis time
. it ' s night at tjhe white hous
. a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt
. teh next day she ' s dead
adn hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in
. how do we know he ' s a hotshot
? we ' ve seen the traditionnal action flick opener
-
- thge clever hostage negotation scene
. it ' s not so clever this time
, consisting ofthe snipes disarming a sucidial ex
- govornment employee holding a gun tothe his head in the middle of the street
. snipes is off to the white house
, where he finds the secret service head
( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali
) won ' t cooperate with him at all
. in fact
, if nto for the intervention ofthe national security adviser alan alda
, snipes wouldn ' t have been allowed in the white hous at all
. alda helps snipes out further
, assigning a sexy secret sevice agent
( diane lane
) to ect as his liaison
.
.
. a vyer dangerous liaison
. well
, nto really
, i just wnated to sday that
. almost immidiately
, a suspect is foudn
, an eccentric night janitor seen flirting iwth the deceased on one of the security videos
. snipes doesn ' t buy it
,
and launches into an indeendent investigation of his own
, one tht reveals planted evidence
and romantic involvement by the president ' s son
. snipes ' partner
, an always
- wisecracking dennis miller
, calls him up every once infact awhile with more news
and lane
, who at frist doesn ' t believe snipes
, eventially
and predictably comes aroud
,
and risks her ass to break into social security storage
adn break out some classified inforamtion
. for the first hour or so
, murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting
. sure
, we have to sit through the lame opening sequence
annd plenty more lame scenes after thgat
,
but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never qutie delivered upon
. snipes
annd lane don ' t mkea fo a bad action team
,
bu with nothing tothe wokr with
, tehy ' re jstu cogs in the bad movie machine
. dennis miller might as well not even be in teh movie
; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood
,
and thgat ' s saying a lot
. when you get tothe hte last half
- hour
, thte movie has descended metaphorically
adn litterally into a wet sewer
, busting out the old break
- inot
- the
- buildng underground climax
.
and when they finally reveal who killed the woman
and why
, you ' ll wish you never sat thru this movei at all
. the
" 1600
" in the movei ' s title doesn ' t represent an adresing
, it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide
. serving the world for nearly 1
/ 25th of a century
