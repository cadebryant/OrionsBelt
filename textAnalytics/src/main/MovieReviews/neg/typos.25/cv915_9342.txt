there
' s only one presidental elcetion every four eyars
,
but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movei painted as
_ the
_ thriller of the year
. in 1997
, we
' ve had absolute power
, air force one
, shadow conspiracy
and murder at 1600
. this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford
, trying to bring us a complex plot of cover
- up
and intrigue
but copping out over anbd over agian with rehashes of action flick st
andbys
. here
' s what happens thsi tiem
. it
' s night at the white house
. a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute
butt
. the enxt day she
' s dead
and hotshot detective wesley snipes isnt called in
. how do we know he
' s a hotshot
? we
' ve seen the traditional action flick opener
-
- the clever hostage negotation scene
. it
' s nto so clever this tiome
, consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex
- government employee holding a gun to his head inaddition the middle of the street
. snipes is off to the white house
, where he finds thte secret service head
( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali
) won
' t cooperate wiht him at all
. in fact
, if not forthe the intervention of national security adviser alan alda
, snipes wouldn
' t have beeen allowed infront the white house at all
. alda helps snipes out further
, assigning a sexy secret service agent
( diane lane
) to act as his liaiosn
.
.
. a very dangerous liaison
. well
, not really
, i just wnated to sday that
. almost immediately
, a suspect is found
, an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with teh deceased on one ofthe the security videos
. snipes doesn
' t buy it
,
and launches into an independent investigation ofthe his pwn
, one thta reveals planted evidence
and romantic involvement by the president
' s son
. snipes
' partner
, an always
- wisecracking dennis miller
, calls him up every once in awhile whith more news
and lane
, who at first doesn
' t believe snipes
, eventually
and predictably comes around
,
and risks her ass to break into social security storage
and break out some classified information
. for the frist hour or so
, murder at 1600 looks like it coudl be going somewhere interesting
. sure
, we have to sit through teh lame opening sequence
and plenty omre lame scenes after thgat
,
but the whole murder in the white house thing makse fo an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon
. snipes
and lane don
' t make forthe a bad action team
,
but with nothing tothe owrk iwth
, they
' re just cogs in the bad movei machine
. dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie
; tehy waste his talents more inspite muder at 1600 than htey did inaddition bordello of blood
,
and that
' s saying a lot
. when you get to the last half
- hour
, the movie has descended metaphorically annd literally into a wet sewer
, busting out the old break
- into
- the
- building undreground climax
. adn when they finally reveal who killed the woman
and why
, ytou
' ll wish you never sat through tihs movie at all
. the
" 1600
" in the movie
' s title doesn
' t represent an address
, it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide
. serving the world for nearly 1
/ 25th of a century
