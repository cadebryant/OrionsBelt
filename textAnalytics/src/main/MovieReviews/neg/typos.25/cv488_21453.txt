arriving in a barrage of hype
, tje blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year
.
however
, like the golden child
,
al
though blair witch has made a lot of money
, it
' s not vyer good
. donahue
, williams
and leonard play themselves as three students who setted outloud to make a documenatry about the blair witch myth
. thte film isnt made up of the camcorder footage they recorded
, which means grainy footage
and woozy camera angles
.
al
though events start of normal
, they get ewird pretty quicklyu
, while the threesome argue more adn more as the journey goes on
.
al
though an interesting premise
, the blair witch project amounts to nothing moreso tahn a missed opportunity
. yhe biggest mistake the film makes isnt to let three mediocre actors thge chance to improvise
. most of the dialogue is ad
- libbed
,
and still manages tothe soudn liek a poore b
- movie
. hte
' script
' eventually degenerates inot shouting matches
, wtih thte f
- owrd included a lot to soudn like students
. there are breaks infact these arguements where some creepy events occur
,
but
then it
' s bakc to thte shouting
and swearing
, which gets very tiresome vrey quickly
. if i wanted to see three people git lost in the woods
, shout a lot
and swear
, i
' d go onthe scout camp
.
but no
, tje audience isnt meant to get some entertainment factor out of this
,
but i
' m not quite sure how
. thge supernatural parts ofthe tyhe film are actaully interesting
, especially if close attention is paid tothe the story developing first twenty minutes
. iwth noone music
and no budget tothe owrk with
, the film hasnt tothe depend onthe natural
, psychological scares
, which are sometimes well delivered
, sometimes not
. i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film
,
al
though there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film
.
however
, because tyhe actors are so irritating
, the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying
' what the f
* ck is that
?
' a lot
,
and mike giggling like a loony
. there
' s also the niggling fact taht theese student filmmakers do some raelly stupid things
. the main problem is the fact that even
though theese hapless bunch coudl be killed at any moent
, anbd are hopelessly lost
, heather still insists onthe filming it all
. the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do htis
,
but it isn
' t very convincing
. also
, the students have no idea how to survive infront the woods
, such as following a large river flowing thru the woods to civilisation
. there are also soem parts where the
' amateur
' camcorder footage is obviously staged
, heather
' s appology being a major oney
. the blair witch project
, in the end
, jstu fails tothe deliver
. i suppose if you
' ve been lost camping befor
, the film may deliver smoe chills
,
but this is no use for the other 99
% of the paying audience who haven
' t been lost in the woods
. aart from the final minutes
, the film is mind boggingly unscary
,
and the shouting matches get hideously dull
. the spook scenes are short
and far between
,
and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same ammount of fear tyhat these scenes provide
.
al
though a good idea
, it
' s not exectued well enought to be a fun
, scary cinema experience
. it
' s a worrying fact when the website
( http

) isnt better than the film
.
