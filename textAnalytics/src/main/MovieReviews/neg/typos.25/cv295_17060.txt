when i first saw thge preview for cruel intentions
, i turned to my friend
and said
,
" dangerous liasons for kids
!
" it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk ofthe plagiarized nonsense
, owing everything it isnt tothe stephen frears
' 1988 masterpiece
. imagin my surprise to see tht writter
/ directer roger kumble has given credit to his source material
: choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses inspite the opening credits
.
and i was impressed
. in fact
, i was much omre impressed with this recognition tahn with the actuall film
, hwihc is an appalling excuse fo a movie
. it
' s kiddie
- porn hackwork
, complet with earthy sex
- talk annd fully
- clothed h
and
- jobs
. i suppose this kind of movie was inevatible
; with all the teen high
- school angst movies coming out
, ther ws certainly room fo a pretentious
and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they
' re smarter
and more beautiful tahn all the other people on earth combined
. cruel intentions is a mess inthe every possable way
, anbd it fails primarily in the way i expeced it to
: i hated all the characters
,
and i hite everything they do
. i also hate ryan phillippe
, so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be
. phillippe plays
( check out tihs nmae
) sebastian valmont
. wow
. isn
' t that a memorable name
? i sould just say it over
and over again
. sebastian valmont
. it kind of rolls off tghe tongue
, infact the spirit of phrases liuke sanguine vapors
and velvet s
andwich
. sebastian valmont is tghe coolest guy who ever walked the earth
; ther is no woman he can
' t have
, no material object out of his reach
. he hasnt all the money
, all the sex
-
- all at his fingertips
.
and
, luckily
, his parents never enter inot his life
-
- noone
, infact the world ofthe cruel intentions
, adults don
' t really exsist
. the ones who do are irritating
. sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister
, kathryn merteuil
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, tghe bitch
- queen ofthe the universe
,
and also the woman every man whants
. since theese two rich kids are so bored
, they only thing they can do is challege each other with meaningless sexual liaisons
. kathryn wnats sebastian valmont to de
- virginize cecile caldwell
( selma blair
)
, a naive dork
- chick who has somehow wronged kathryn
.
but it
' s too easy for sebastian valmont
-
- he wants tothe nail annette hargrove
( reese witherspoon
)
, the
" paradym ofthe chastity
and beauty
.
" so
, sebastian valmont
and kathryn make a deel
( whic is too explicit to state here
)
.
but
-
- dear god
!
-
- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove
. dangerous liaisons is a great movei because the characters are all believeable
,
and because ofthe its masterful acting
. cruel intentions is bad fo many reasons
, bu it lacks both believable characters adn masterful acting
. kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch
, a girl so loathsome taht i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her
. she is supposed tothe be mean
, bu glenn close gavey thte character some depth in dangerous liaisons
. gellar
, while aesthetically pleasing
, is noe
- dimensional annd utterly repulsive
. witherspoon has a truly beautyfull face
,
but her character isn
' t thge moral staple she
' s suposed to be
: sure
, she won
' t have sex until she
' s infact love
( is this really a
* moral
* issue
?
)
,
but she does some things infront the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible
.
but i cin
' t forget mr
. phillippe
, who continues to exceed my expectations withthe his impenetrable
, invulnerable bl
andness
. i hvea to give him credit
and say that he did
, in fact
, manaze to change his facial expression about three times durring the course ofthe cruel intentions
.
and there
' s one point inwhich tghe film in which he shouts
, thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone
. true
, he isnt bad
,
but it doesn
' t help that he has noone charater tothe work wih
. kumble has drained all the interesting aspects ffrom this character
, leaving us with a sex
- crazed lunatic who is suppossed to be sympathetic because he falls infact love with a moral flower
and shuns the wicked bitch
. the film fails in every other way
, too
. first of all
, nobody talks like thsi
. even the
" intellectuals
" i know don
' t bother with this kind ofthe pointless
and pretentious yammering
. forthe a while
, the movie looks like it might play itself forthe laughs
,
but it ends uv taking itself so seriously thgat there
' s no way we can join it
. cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft
- porn in more than one scene
. earlier i mentioned a fully
- clothed h
and
- job
; thsi occurs between kathryn
and sebastian valmont
, both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point infact the movie
. so
, if we hite them
,
then what
' s the point of an extended sex scene
? titillation
, ofthe course
. it can
' t even work under the pretense ofthe
" meaningful love scene
,
" because we hate the characters
. it
' s interesting tothe note some of the parallels between cruel intentions
and dangerous liaisons
. kumble is clearly familar with the earlier film
; many ofthe the scenes have a similar tone
,
and there are moments infront frears
' film that kumble imitates almost completely
( such as the lastr scene
, in wich
[ spoiler warning
!
] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers
)
.
but kids don
' t act like this
. nobody acts liek this
. in his translation
, roger kumble forgot character development
and sympathy
-
- some pretty crucial elements
. the result isnt a picture of confounding badness
, a kiddie
- porn mess that thinks it
' s realy deepo
and profound
. i
' ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences
,
but that doesn
' t change the fact that it
' s awful
.
