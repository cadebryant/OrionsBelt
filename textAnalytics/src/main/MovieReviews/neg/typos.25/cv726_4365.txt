cashing in on the success of white men can
' t jump
and tjhe failure ofthe most ofthe theri solo vehicles
( including hte cowboy way
and drop zone
)
, wesley snipes annd woody harrelson have reteamed
, hoping that they can strike up the same success
. sadly
, if tihs dismal
, cliche ridden
and mind
- numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by
, they haven
' t got a chance inwhich hell of even coming close
. tihs time outloud
, the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops
. following several run
- ins witht their tyrannical boss
( robert blake
)
, who is obssessed with the
" money train
"
-
- a turain hwihc carries all the subway
' s takings
-
- anbd iwll let nothing stop it
( now
* there
' s
* an original plot divice
)
, harrelson
' s character decides to try
and take off with tjhe cash
. along the way
, both ofthe them fall in love wtih the same woman
-
- anohter transit cop who also hates her boss
. this leads to tje tipical sibling rivalry crap that you usualy find in a film of this st
andard
(
' you were always the better brother
' etc
. etc
. etc
.
)
,
and doesn
' t help to add anything tothe the film
. given a better script
, better performers in supporting roles
and a shorter runnung time
( the film almost went fo two hours
-
- or did it just feel like it
?
)
, thsi film might
(
and i mean
* might
*
) have turned out okay
,
but as it isnt
, it isnt stocked wtih the worst action film cliches
, whose only purpose appears to be to pad thge film outloud to its painfully long running time
. robert blake
, who plays the evil boss
, has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history
! he sounds like wayne newton
,
and appears tothe think the best way tothe appear evil isnt to have your eyes bulging as
though they are baout to burst outloud of their sockets
! bu this is only one ofthe money train
' s problems
. if you look at the script as if it was an action film
, it lacks originality
and suspense
.
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film
, it is even worse
. the final robbery sequence is alomst trivialised anbd the characters definitely ain
' t
butch
and sundance
. hte film isn
' t all bad
though
. snipes
and harrelson
, when they aren
' t using the dumb cliches that the scirpt gives them
, make an agreeable duo
,
and smoe ofthe the stunt
- wokr isnt indeed excellent
. bu good stunt
- work cannot save a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel acation movei
. if you
' re a really undem
anding action freak
, there
' s a chance you
' ll like this
.
but if you
' re looking for something orignal
, or suspenseful
, try somewhere else
-
- i dout ytou
' ll find it here
