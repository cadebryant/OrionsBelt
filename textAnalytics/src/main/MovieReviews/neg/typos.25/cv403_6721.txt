. the preceeding has been yhe plot of approxamately twelve thous
and anbd six action films
; this oney jsut happens to be called metro
. i have learned to expect little from films like metro
,
and consenquently i am bored by them mroe often than i am genuinely dissappointed
. with eddie murphy on board
,
however
, you hope forthe something extra
, some kind ofthe spark
. when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedeous experience
, you nkow it is doign something terribly wrong
. murphy stars as scott roper
, a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who isnt exceedingly good at his job
. with his personal life
, he is considerably less successful
, facing an unhappy ex
- girlfriend named veronica
( carmen ejogo
)
, a gambling problem
and a mountain of debt
.
then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend
and collegue
( art evans
) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda
( michael wincott
)
. finding korda becomes very personal to scott
,
and he joins with new partner kevin mccall
( michael rappaport
) to foil korda during an attemped heist
.
but all is not well even with korda in jail
, as scott
, veronica anbd kevin all continue to face life
- threatening danger
. metro
( the title
, in case you are wondering
, means absolutely nothing
) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing
and stray plot threads
. in thte first place
, korda
' s rage over being discovered before he cxan make his big scoer isnt rendered completelyl pointless whn he procedes to hitted tje target anyway
(
and
, incidentally
, tothe screw it uv
)
. a reference to payoffs in the police department
, folowed by a conspicuous dicision tothe keep scott off the korda case annd a couple of pointed glances
, is dropped abruptly with no resolution affter baout forty
- five mintues
; even the relationship between scott
and new partner kevin isnt so perfunctory
, withthe kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott
, that ytou may yearn for bickering buddies
. worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villin
( teh always menacing michael wincott
) behind bars fo far too long
, leaving a lot of time to kill wtih the tedious reconciliation of scott adn veronica
. you cant
' t blame murphy forthe being unable tothe muster any enthusiasm for the scenes iwth his bl
and leading lady
, bu he shoudln have known better than tothe take this role at all
. scott roper exists inspite an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street
- wise fast
- talker murphy hasnt built a career on
and an actual three
- dimensional charcter
,
and murphy is never able to reconcile the two
. the scirpt seems tothe have been doctored for him
, with a gambling problem turned into a bit ofthe character color adn his supposed inability tothe form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather tahn actual conflict
, yot there isnt still too little comedy for murphy to work with
. for much of the film
, he walks around with an intense frown
,
and it is over 90 minutes into metro befor you hear thgat trademark laugh for the first time
. murphy isnt str
anded with too few solid punch lines
,
and nearly all ofthe the ones he does have bounce ofthe ejogo adn fall to the ground limply
. i supose i should give director thomas carter credit fo taking tjhe obligatory san francisco car chase
( how much dont you want to bet onthe thge likelihood of seing a car soar over a hill
?
)
and doing a few interesting things with it
. as vehicles are sent flying
and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car
, it is possible at least for a moment to tkae smoe pleasure inspite a goofy spin on a familiar situation
. carter does an even better job by taking tht ood suspense st
and
- by
-
- the medicine cabnet mirror which will close to reveal a killer st
anding behind someone
-
-
and using it to defuse tension not once
,
but
_ twice
_
. the fact tht carter was able to demonstrate even tyhat much recognition of cliches
,
and a willingless tothe subvert them
, makes his involvement iin the rest ofthe the diaster that is metro all the more puzzling
. an action film liuke this plods so relentlessly anbd obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find youself shouting out
" point c
!
" while they
' re still getting to point b
, or getting uv with the rest of the audience aftter the big explosion whitch signals taht nothing alse of any consequence is going tothe happen
.
