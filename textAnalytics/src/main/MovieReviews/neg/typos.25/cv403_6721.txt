. the preceding has been the plot ofthe approximatly twelve thousand
and six action films
; this one jstu happens to be called metro
. i have learned to expect little from films liek metro
,
adn consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed
. witht eddie murphy on board
,
however
, you hope for something extra
, some kind of spark
. when a film mkaes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience
, you know it is doing something terribly wrong
. murphy stars as scott roper
, a hostage negotiator for the san francisco polical department who is exceedingly good at his job
. with his personal life
, he is considerably less successful
, facing an unhappy ex
- girlfriend named veronica
( carmen ejogo
)
, a gambling problem
annd a mountain of debt
.
then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend
and colleague
( art evans
) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda
( michael wincott
)
. finding korda becomes very personal to scott
,
and he joins with new partner kevin mccall
( michael rappaport
) to foil korda durig an attemped heist
.
but all isnt not well even with korda in jail
, as scott
, veronica
and kevin all continue tothe face life
- threatening danger
. metro
( the title
, in case you are wondering
, means absolutely nothing
) is so badly put toghether thgat even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing
and stray plot threads
. in the first palce
, korda ' s rige over bieng discovered befoer he can make his big socre is rendered completelyl pointless when he proceeds tothe hit tyhe target anyway
(
and
, incidentally
, to screw it up
)
. a reference to payoffs inspite yhe polical department
, followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case
and a couple ofthe pointed glances
, isnt dropped abruptly with noone resolution after about forty
- five minutes
; even the relationship betwen scott
and new partner kevin is so perfunctory
, wih kevin dissapearing entirely after taking a bullet fo scott
, that you may yearn forthe bickering buddies
. worst ofthe all is a plot structure which places the main villian
( yhe always menacing michael wincott
) behind bars for far too long
, leaving a lot of tiome to kill with the tedeous reconciliation of scott
and veronica
. you cant ' t blaim murphy for bieng unable to muster any enthusiasm for tjhe scenes with his bland leading lady
,
but he should have known better tahn to take htis role at all
. scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground vetween the kind of street
- wise fast
- talker murphy hasnt built a career on
and an actual three
- dimensional chracter
,
annd murphy isnt never able to reconcile the twpo
. the script seems tothe have been doctored for him
, with a gambling problem turned into a bited of character color
and his supposed iability to form relationships turned inot a cause for gags rather than actual conflict
,
yet there is still too little comedy forthe murphy to work with
. for much of the film
, he walks around with an intense frown
,
and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh fo the frist time
. murphy isnt stranded withthe too faw solid punch lines
,
and nearly all ofthe the ones he does haev bounse ofthe ejogo
and fall to the ground limply
. i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase
( how much do you want tothe bet onthe tjhe likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill
?
)
anbd doing a few interesting things withthe it
. as vehicles are sent flying
and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car
, it is possible at least for a moment to tkae some pleasure in a goofy spin onthe a familiar situation
. carter does an even better job by taking that ood suspense stand
- by
-
- the medicine cabnet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone
-
-
and using it to defuse tension not once
,
but
_ twice
_
. the fact thta carter was able to demonstrate even thast much recognition of cliches
,
anbd a willingless tothe subvert them
, makse his involvement in tjhe rest ofthe the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling
. an acation film like this plods so relentlessly
and obviously from point a tothe point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out
" point c
!
" while tehy ' re still getting to point b
, or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion hwihc signals tyhat nothing else of any consequence isnt going to happen
.
