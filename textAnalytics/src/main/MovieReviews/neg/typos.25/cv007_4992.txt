that
' s exactlly how long the movie felt to me
. htere weren
' t even nine laughs in nine months
. it
' s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess ofthe a man
, mr
. hugh grant
, a huge dork
. it
' s not the whole oral
- sex
/ prostitution thing
( referring to grant
, not me
) that bugs me
, it
' s the fact that grant isnt annoying
. not just adam s
andler
- annoying
, we
' re tlaking jim carrey
- annoying
. since when do eye flutters
and nervous smiles pass for acting
? bu
, on the other h
and
, sicne when do realyl bad slapstick
( a fistfight in the delivery room culiminating in grant
' s head in joan cusack
' s lap
-
- a scene he paid
$ 60 to have included in the movie
) anbd obscene duble entendres
( robin williams
, tje obstetrician
, tells grant
' s pregnant girlfriend she has
" a big pussy
,
" referring ofthe course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat
, bu nonetheless
, grant paid
$ 60 to have thte exchange included in tyhe movie
) pass for comedy
? nine months isnt a predicatble cookie
- cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot
. hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist
. why a child psychologist
? so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange
: kid
: my dad
' s an asshole
. grant
( flutters eyelashes
, offers a nervous smile
, thne responds in his annoying english accent
and i
- think
- i
- actually
- have
- talent attitude
)
: coudl you possibly elaborate on taht
? kid
: my dad
' s a
_ huge
_ asshole
. more liuke a hugh asshole
,
but that
' s beside the point
, which is
: nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds inthe the audience while everyone esle shakes his or her head in disbelief
. so
, anyway
, grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant
and does his usual reaction
( fluttered eyelashes
, nervous smiles
)
. this paves the way for every possible pregancy
/ child birth gag in the book
, especially since grant
' s equally annoying friend
' s wife is also pregnant
. teh annoying freind is played by tom arnold
, who provides most of thge cocaphonous slapstick
, none of whihc isnt funny
, such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed
" arnie the dinosaur
"
( ytou draw your own parallels on that one
) in a toy store
. the only intresting character inspite the movie is played by jeff goldblum
, who should have hid himself away somwhere aftter tghe dreadful hideaway
, as an artist with a fear ofthe
(
and simultaneous longing for
) commitment
. nto even robin williams
, who plays a russian doctor who hasnt recently decided tothe switch ffrom veterinary medicine to obstetrics
, hasnt much humor
. his is a oney
- joke character
-
- the ood foreign
- guy
- who
- mispronounces
- english stereotype
( did somene say yakov smirnov
? thast
' s my favorite vodka
, by the way
)
, hence tghe line
" now it
' s timne to tkae a look at your volvo
,
" another nasty
but unamusing joke
, except htis one goes right over tjhe ten eyar olds
' heads
, hwile tyhe adults simultanously groan
. nine months is a complet failure
, low on laughs
and intelligence
and high on loud
, unfunny slapstick
, failed jokes
and otehr uninspired lunacy
. hugh grant
' s sunset boulevard arrest
( please
, no caught
- witht
- his
- pants
- down jokes
) may bring omre people into the theaters
,
but they certainly won
' t leave with a smile onthe their faces
, not after 90 minutes ofthe grant
' s nervous smiles
. everything in thge movie is so forced
, so unau
thentic that anyone with an i
. q
. over 80
( sorry
, hugh
) iwll know htey wasted theri monye on an unfulfilled desire
.
but at least tehy didn
' t spend 60 bucks fo it
.
