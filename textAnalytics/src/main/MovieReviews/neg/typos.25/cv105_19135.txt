based on the 1960s tv series tht i had never seen or heard of befor tihs movie
( be happy
, i won ' t bore you with any lame
and unnecessary comparisons
)
, this film allows iwll smith to take a thrid stab at the independendet day weekend box
- office
, after scoring huge successes with men inthe black
( 7
/ 10
)
, directed by the same man who controlled this one
,
and independence day
( 6
/ 10
)
. cin yuo say
.
.
. the third times not a charm
? plot
: james west
and artemus gordon are choosen by the president to fidn the man responsible for the kidnapping ofthe the nation ' s top scientists
,
anbd threatning to take over the united states within a week
. critique
: i did not laff once during thsi entire picture
. whn yuo concider that this film is a part
- comedy
, that ' s not a very good sign
. i also doed not tense uv or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic acation sequences which provided me with littel more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes
. when ytou consider that the otehr
" part
" of this film is geared as an acation
/ adventure
, i would say thta this anohter negative sign
.
and when you consider that the frist hour of the film ws boring
and a littel slow
, tghe story
- line tired
, reminiscent ofthe swiss cheese
and uninvolving
,
and tyhe special effects interesting
but worth vyer little inside a plot filled with lame one
- liners
, weak characterizations
and an anti
- climactic end
, you preety much have the gist of my impression of htis
" big
" summer blockbuster
. it blows
. or as they say in french
,
" eet blows
"
. could it be that the scirpt ws crappy because it took four people to wriet it
? maeby
. could it be that most ofthe tyhe special effects don ' t sohw up until the lastr half hour
,
and even
then
, we don ' t see anytying that its trailers hadn ' t already given away
? perhpas
. or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith
and hollywood big
- budget movies
, thyat we cannot halp
but evaluate them on a scale onto their pwn
? naaaaaaah
! a bad movie is a bad movie
. on a postive onot
, i coudl honestly say that i did vrey much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek
, who seemed underused
( in my humble opinyon
)
,
annd lit up eveyr bubbly scene tht she was hardly infact
. branagh was also fun as the scenery
- munching
, over
- the
- top bad guy
,
bu that ' s pretty much where the enteratinment
- buck stopped
. smith
annd kline were static at best
, the plot full of holes
,
and tje score insignificant
adn derivative ofthe a dozen others
. i would strongly advise anyone nto tothe see this movei
.
then again
, htere is thast one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage
.
.
. huh
.
.
. oh yeah
,
but hte rest of the movie sucked
. littel known facts about this film
