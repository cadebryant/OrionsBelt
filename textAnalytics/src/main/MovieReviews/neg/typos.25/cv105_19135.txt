based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie
( be happy
, i won
' t bore yuo with any lame anbd unnecessary comparisons
)
, this film allows will smith tothe take a third stab at the independence day weekend box
- office
, aftter scoring huge successes with men in black
( 7
/ 10
)
, directed by the same man who contolled this one
,
and independence day
( 6
/ 10
)
. can you sday
.
.
. the third times not a charm
? plot
: james west
and artemus gordon are chosen by the preident to find the man responisble for yhe kidnapping of the nation
' s top scientists
,
and threatning to take over the united states within a week
. critique
: i did not laugh once during this entire picture
. wehn you consider that this film is a part
- comedy
, that
' s not a veyr good sign
. i aslo doed nto tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back tothe the lovley salma hayek scenes
. when you consider that hte otehr
" part
" ofthe this film is geared as an acation
/ adventure
, i would say that tihs another negative sign
.
and wehn ytou consdider that tyhe first hour ofthe the film was boring
and a little slow
, the story
- line tired
, reminiscent of swiss cheese
and uninvolving
,
and the spacial effects intresting
but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one
- liners
, weak characterizations
and an anti
- climactic end
, you pretty much have the gist of my impression ofthe thsi
" big
" summer blockbuster
. it blows
. or as they say inthe french
,
" eet blows
"
. could it be that the script was crappy beccause it took four people to write it
? maybe
. could it be that most ofthe the special effects don
' t show up until thge last half hour
,
and even
then
, we don
' t see anytying that its trailers hadn
' t already given away
? perhaps
. or could it be thgat we have come to expect so much mroe from will smith
and hollywood big
- budget movies
, that we cannnot help
but evaluate them on a scale onto their own
? naaaaaaah
! a bad movie is a bad movie
. on a positive note
, i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performence by the adorable salma hayek
, who seemed underused
( in my humble opinion
)
,
and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in
. branagh was also fun as teh scenery
- munching
, over
- thte
- top bad guy
, bu that
' s preety much where yhe entertainment
- buck stopped
. smith
and kline weere static at best
, the plot full of holes
,
and the score insignificant
and derivitive of a dozen others
. i would strongly advise anyone nto tothe see this movie
.
then again
, ther is tht one scene with the lovley salma hayek tied up in a cage
.
.
. huh
.
.
. oh yeah
,
but the rest of tje movie sucked
. littel known facts about this film
