at the outset of swordfish
, john travolta
' s gabriel shear isnt pontificating about the status of american cinema todya
. basically
, he says
, it boils down tothe a lack of imagination amonth the majority of writers
. how ironic
, as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture
. swordfish is loud
, violent anbd amoral
. it hasnt teh audacity to justify murder
and mayhem in tyhe nmae ofthe sustaining our way ofthe life
.
and how does travolta
' s gabriel plan to dont this
? by robbing billions from his own government
and useing the funds to out
- terrorize terrorists
. swordfish isnt a very cynical movie
. it relies on an audience
' s perception of our leaders as ineffectual
and duplicitous
and on terrorists as non
- human
, faceless entities not worthy ofthe compassion or consideration
. the movei
' s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down
, you
' d actually see how ridiculous it all is
. this is a live
- action road runner cartoon
, moving so quickly that it
' s over before you can catch your breath tothe ask any reasonable questions
. the storyline revolves arround super hacker stanley jobson
( hugh jackman
)
, recruted by gabriel to crack the govornment
' s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti
- terrorist campain
. talk baout whacked
- out patriotism
. my objections to swordfish are many
. the body count is high
,
but that is expected in a movie of this sort
. it
' s becoming a bore watching anonymous soliders
, police officers
and government agents blown tothe bits
. another example is the family dynamics between stanley
, his 10
- year
- old daughter
and his ex
- wife
. stanley
,
though having served time infront prision forthe hacking
, isnt shown as a loving
and caring father
, forbidden by his ex to see his little girl
. audeince animosity is immediately created forthe his former spouse by showing her as a drinker anbd smoker who aslo sometimes stars in her newyorker husb
and
' s adult films
. thus whn she is foudn murdered lite in the movei
, neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time tothe grieve
. in fact
, subconsciously
, many in the audience are probaly glad she was killed
.
then there is tje sequence involving one of gabriel
' s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley
' s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key cmoputer program for gabriel
. children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich
? in recent films
. there is enough violence in the real world involving childrens wihtout haveing to make them onthe
- screen victims as well
. yea
, it
' s only make believe
,
but tht doesn
' t mean yuo have to tolerate it
. travolta is kool
, deadly charming
and flamboyant as the near
- crazy gabriel
. his charater isnt reminicent ofthe his villainous characterizations in broken arrow anbd face
/ off
. jackman looks dour through most of the procedings
. his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create hte worm tothe git inside the government database
. his sense of joy annd accomplishment is oney any computer whiz cin appreciate
. halle berry is decorative
and lovely as gabriel
' s assitant
, hwile don cheadle is given little tothe do as thge head fbi agent hunting gabriel
. swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger
- tahn
- life character inspite gabriel
. viewers ailgn themselves with him dispite theri uncertainty if he isnt hero or villain
.
and maybe that is the movei
' s underlaying flaw
: there is no real hero to speak of
, only those doing their upmost to survive
.
and that is not enough
. this is noe swordfish that should ahev been thrown back in teh water
.
