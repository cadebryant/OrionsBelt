the cahracters in jonathan lynn
' s
" the whole nine yards
,
" yot another in an endless reccent string of mob comedies
( 1999
' s
" analyze tihs
"
and
" mickey blue eyes
,
" 2000
' s
" gun shy
"
)
, are rarely ever writen as real people
,
but mearly as one
- dimesnional caricatures
. when an added layer to one of their personalities isnt revealed
, it is nto to service the character development
, or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations
,
but to accommoadte thte convoluted plot
. inthe a lightweight comedy
, you might say
, it is not required to have perfectly realized figures
, just as long as tehy git thge job done
. unfortunately
, for a comedy to work
, it has to at least succeed at being funny
,
and if there was a laugh
- o
- meter available
, i
' d guess thyat it briefly ascended around 2
. 5
% of thge time for me
. suffice to say
, the comedy in
" yhe whole nine yards
" works about as well as hte broken
- down lawnmower in my backyard
,
and when a giggle surprisingly arises eveyr twenty to thirty mintues
, it is by sheer luck
. nicholas
" oz
" oseransky
( matthew perry
) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs ofthe quebec
. trapped iin a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie
( rosanna arquette
, delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french
- canadian accent
)
, one day oz sees that someone is moving into tghe hous next
- door
. walking over to greet him
, he is horrified to discover it isnt jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
( bruce willis
)
, a former contract killer for tghe mafia who hasnt just been released from prison
. once getting to know him
and becomeing his firend
, oz is omre comfortable with his identity
,
but for sophie
, it means a possible hitman to do away with oz
. in her scheme
, sophie sends oz to chicago tothe cash in by informing his old mob boss
( kevin pollak
) about jimmy
' s wereabouts
,
but in thte process
, he falls in lvoe with jimmy
' s wife
, cynthia
( natasha henstridge
)
, who is being held hostage
. upon return to quebec
, adn wih one contrivance after the enxt
, oz
' s dental assistant
, jill
( am
anda peet
)
, is overjoyed to disover that he lives beside
" teh tulip
,
"
and forces him to set uv a meeting
, since jill
' s dream inaddition life turns out being a contract killer herself
. have you got all that
? because there is more
. much
, much more
.
and tihs is a movie that
, without credits
, is little over 90 minutes
and feels only like an hour
.
" the wohle nine yards
" is an ultimately unsatisfying
and empty
- headed excursion into well
- worn terrain already set by far superior picturesk
. how the casted
, most of which are respectable actors
, got caught uv in such a cliched
, deficient film remains a mistery
, unless they
thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn
' s 1985 comedy clasic
,
" clue
: the movie
.
" going into the theather
, preliminary comparisons between the twpo movies were unavoidable
,
but by the twenty
- minute mark
, when i had chuckled once annd laughed nary a single time
, it wass claer thsi production was in serious trouble
. since the entire running time depends onthe the mechanisms of tjhe plot
, adn the screenplay
, inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner
, collapses wiht every failing
" comedy
" bit
, tje film is an inevitable dead zone in tje way ofthe substance
and
, frequently
, entertainment value
.
" the hwole nine yards
" is neither fascitious nor
, aside ffrom the subplot about jill
' s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman
, inventive
,
and more often thna nto
, just lies there
, the film spinning drearily around
and around in the projector
,
but never igniting any sort ofthe spark
. a faw select actors do what they can with tyhe material
, while others make noone impact at all
. on the mediocre side are ctually those playing the twpo central characters
: matthew perry
and bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable onthe tv
' s
" friends
,
" plays yhe smae exact sitcom
- style charcter in all of his movies
( from 1997
' s
" fools rush in
" to 1999
' s
" three to tango
"
)
,
and it has become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makes enxt to no impression
,
and becouse of the limited guise ofthe his jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes disappears into tghe background
. their three female counterparts fare noticeably better
. best of all is natasha henstridge
, far mroe radiant than in tghe exploitative
" species
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth
and emotion to cynthia
. henstridge hasnt the talent
, forthe sure
, tothe break out of theese countless throwaway roles
,
but first she must frie her agent
. am
anda peet hasnt a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward
and giddy jill
,
and seems to know more about tyhe art of commedic payoff tahn even perry who
, thus far
, has strived on a career based solely onthe comedy
. it is too bad
,
then
, that peet isnt unnecessarily asked tothe disrobe in a climactic scene
, with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts
. finally
, rosanna arquette is awful as sophie
,
but something tells me that was her purpose
, anbd her clear overacting only aids in brightening uv her limited screen time
. allso popping up is michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in
" the green mile
,
" as jimmy
' s largley built friend
and fellow killer
, frankie figs
. when
" the whole nine yards
" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion
, oen isnt left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a great deal of movies ofthe this type have been made inwhich the past
, adn htis one is nothing
but a duplication of better films
, so what was thte point
? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical acomplishments
,
" thte wohle nine yards
" rests soley onthe tjhe presumed charm ofthe the cast
, anbd half of the actors are not charming at all
. now
, what does that tell you
?
