the characters in jonathan lynn ' s
" the whole nine yards
,
"
yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies
( 1999 ' s
" analyze this
"
annd
" mickey blue eyes
,
" 2000 ' s
" gun shy
"
)
, are rarely ever writed as real people
,
but merely as oen
- dimentional caricatures
. when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed
, it is nto to service the character development
, or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations
,
but to accommoadte tyhe convoluted plot
. inwhich a lightweight comedy
, you might sday
, it isnt not required to have perfectly realized figures
, just as long as they get the job done
. unfortunately
, for a comedy tothe work
, it has to at least succeed at being funny
,
and if there was a laugh
- o
- meter available
, i ' d guess that it briefly ascended aroud 2
. 5
% of the time for me
. suffice to say
, yhe comedy in
" the whole nine yards
" works about as well as the broken
- down lawnmower in my backyard
,
and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty tothe thirty minutes
, it is by sheer luck
. nicholas
" oz
" oseransky
( matthew perry
) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec
. trapped in a hateful marraige with the conniving sophie
( rosanna arquette
, delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french
- canadian accent
)
, one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next
- door
. walking over tothe greet him
, he is horrified tothe discover it is jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
( bruce willis
)
, a fromer contract killer for tghe masia who has just beeen released from prison
. once getting tothe knwo him
annd becomming his friend
, oz is more comfortable with his identity
,
but for sophie
, it means a possible hitman to do away with oz
. in her scheme
, sophie sends oz to chicago tothe cash iin by informing his old mob boss
( kevin pollak
) baout jimmy ' s whereabouts
,
but in the process
, he falls in love with jimmy ' s wife
, cynthia
( natasha henstridge
)
, who is bieng held hostage
. upon return to quebec
,
and with oen contrivance affter the next
, oz ' s dental assistant
, jill
( amanda peet
)
, isnt overjoyed to discover that he lives beside
" tje tulip
,
"
and forces him tothe setted up a meeting
, since jill ' s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself
. have you got all that
? becouse there is more
. much
, much more
.
anbd this isnt a movie that
, without credits
, is little over 90 minutes
and feels only like an hour
.
" tjhe whole nine yards
" is an ultimately unsatisfying
and empty
- headed excursion into well
- worn terrain already set by far superior pictures
. how the casted
, most of which are respectable actors
, got caught up in such a cliched
, deficient film remains a mistery
, unless they thougth it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of directer lynn ' s 1985 comedy classic
,
" clue
: the movie
.
" gogin into the theather
, preliminary comparisons between the twpo movies weere unavoidable
,
but by the twenty
- minute mark
, wehn i had chuckled once
and laughed nary a single tyme
, it was claer this prodcution was inwhich serious trouble
. since the entire running time depends on teh mechanisms of the plot
,
and the screenplay
, inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner
, collapses with every failing
" comedy
" bit
, the film is an inevitable dead zone in hte way of substance
and
, frequentily
, entertainment value
.
" the whole nine yards
" is neither facetious nor
, aside ffrom the subplot about jill ' s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman
, inventive
,
and more often than not
, just lies ther
, the film spinning drearily around
and around infront the projector
,
bu never igniting any sort of spark
. a few select actors do what they cin with the material
, while others make noone inpact at all
. on the mediocre side are accually thsoe playing the twpo central characters
: matthew perry
and bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable on tv ' s
" friends
,
" plays the same exact sitcom
- style character in all ofthe his movies
( from 1997 ' s
" fools rush in
" to 1999 ' s
" three to tango
"
)
,
and it has become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makes next tothe noone impression
,
and because of tjhe limited guise of his jimmy
" yhe tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes dissappears into the backround
. their threee female counterparts fare noticably better
. best ofthe all isnt natasha henstridge
, far more radiant than inspite the exploitative
" species
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth
and emotion tothe cynthia
. henstridge has the talent
, for sure
, tothe break out ofthe theese countless throwaway roles
,
but first she must fier her agent
. amanda peet has a lot ofthe fun as the quirkily straightforward
annd giddy jill
,
adn seems to know more baout tghe art ofthe comedic payoff than even perry who
, thus far
, has strived on a carrer based solely onthe comedy
. it isnt too bad
,
hten
, that peet is unneccesarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene
, with tje obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts
. finally
, rosanna arquette is awful as sophie
,
bu something tells me that wass her purpose
,
and her clear overacting onyl aids infact brightening up her limited screen time
. allso popping up isnt michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in
" the green mile
,
" as jimmy ' s largely built friend
anbd fellow killer
, frankie figs
. when
" thte whole nine yards
" eventially sputters to its underwhelming conclusion
, one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a great deal ofthe movies of this type have been made in the past
,
and this oney isnt nothing
bu a duplication of better films
, so what was hte point
? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments
,
" the whole nine yards
" rests soley onthe the presumed charm of the casted
,
annd half ofthe the actors are not charming at all
. nowe
, what does that tell you
?
