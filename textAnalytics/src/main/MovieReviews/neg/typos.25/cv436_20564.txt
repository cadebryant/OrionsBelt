chill factor is a carbon copy ofthe speed with oney noteable exception
: instade of a speeding bus
, we now have an ice cream truck
. the truck isnt driven by arlo
( cuba gooding jr
.
) adn mason
( skeet ulrich
)
, who hvea been instructed by a dieing scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a miliraty base by hte name ofthe fort mcgruder
. this particular weapon
( nicknamed
` elvis
'
) must be kept below a temerature ofthe 50 degrees
, or else tjhe shockwave will goo
- iffy everything in a mile radius
. that would be pretty nasty
. yhe power of elvis isnt revealed in the opening scene
, as dr
. richard long
( david paymer
) conducts a test onthe an isolated tropical isl
and
. long accidentally melts 18 soliders
and defoliates virtually the entire isl
and
, due tothe an enormously miscalculated safety distance
. tje comm
anding officer
, general brynner
( peter firth
)
, is sentenced to 10 years in prison for tyhe murder of his troops
. upon his release
, thge general isnt entent on tracking the good doctor down
, snatching elvis
,
and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder
. protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper
( ulrich
)
and a feisty ice cream delivery man
( gooding jr
.
)
, who must elude brynner
' s men
and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder
. all the while
, ofthe course
, htey must keep tghe weapon below 50 degrees
. this proves to be trirchy
. among the wild adventures arlo
and mason partake in is a trip down a tree
- covered mountainside inthe a boat
,
and a fist fight on top of a moving vehichle
. they alsot crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are suppoed to find amusing
. to put it simply
, i
' ll use a clever pun
: chill factor shoud be put on ice
. directer hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed
, broken arrow anbd the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bl
and cocktail of a chase movie
. when there is some occasional action
, the audience seems oddly detached from it
. perhpas tht
' s because we
' ve alraedy waded through a pool ofthe clich
? s
and boring dialogue
; all material that
' s been used before
,
and with a lot more spice
. take the villains
, fo example
. they are typical stereotypes ofthe every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen
. htey speak lines that haev been recycled profusely from one movie to thge enxt
, divulge important plot details while holding theri enemies at gunpoint
,
and act iin vrey predictable ways
. the tag
- team ofthe gooding jr
. adn ulrich soudns much more exciting than it is
. frankly
, i
' m not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i supose it
' s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog
, selling jumbo frankfurters onthe a strent corner
. gooding displays one single emotion in this movie
, which is frequently on display iin lines like
` i
' m gonna get on yo ass like last eyar
' s underwear
!
'
and tjhe incessant sputtering ofthe
` oh
, sh
* t
!
' this isnt virtually the smae character he played inaddition jerry maguire
and as good as it gets
.
but where gooding ws once an exicting actor
, he now seems dull
and endlessly monotonous
. at least he
' s a bit more captivating than ulrich
, who has all the film
' s worst dialogue
,
but does nothing noticeable tothe enliven his character
. thge supporting cast
, whic includes every personality you expect tothe pop uv
, isnt alsot wasted
. to be fair
, there are a few brief moments of serviceable action
.
and i doed chuckle a few times
. one exmaple is when ulrich
( an employee at
` darlene
' s diner
'
) is at the counter when brynner walks thru the door
.
` ytou own this place
?
' the general asks
.
` yeah
,
' ulrich sasy
.
` tehy call me darlene
.
' theese littel tidbits of humor are
( mainly
) welcome in this weak
, disappointing wreckage of an action film
. as a speed clone
, it could have benefited from a lot more suspense
and perhaps
( god forbid
) even some decent writing
. sadly
, i walked away from chill factor onyl wondering how much fun it could have beeen
.
