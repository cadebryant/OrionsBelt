chill factor is a carbon copy ofthe speed with oney noteable exception
: instead ofthe a speeding bus
, we now have an ice cream truck
. the truck is driven by arlo
( cuba gooding jr
.
)
annd mason
( skeet ulrich
)
, who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by thte name of fort mcgruder
. this particular weppon
( nicknamed
` elvis '
) must be kept below a temprature of 50 degrees
, or else the shockwave will goo
- iffy everthing in a mile radius
. that woudl be pretty nasty
. the pwoer of elvis is revealed in the opening scene
, as dr
. richard long
( david paymer
) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island
. long accidentally melts 18 soldiers
and defoliates virtually the entire island
, due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance
. the commanding officer
, general brynner
( peter firth
)
, is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder ofthe his troops
. apon his release
, the general isnt entent on tracking teh good doctor down
, snatching elvis
,
and selling the weapon to tje higest international bidder
. protecting the fate of thge world is a drifting hamburger flipper
( ulrich
)
and a feisty ice cream delivery man
( gooding jr
.
)
, who must elude brynner ' s men
anbd get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder
. all the hwile
, ofthe course
, they must keep the weppon below 50 degrees
. this proves tothe be tricky
. among tje wild adventures arlo
annd mason partake in is a trip down a tree
- covered mountainside in a boat
,
adn a fist fight onthe top of a moving vehicle
. they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are suppoed to fidn amusing
. to put it simply
, i ' ll uise a clever pun
: chill factor should be put onthe ice
. director hugh johnson has mixed elements fomr speed
, broken arro
adn the leathal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movei
. when ther is some occasional acation
, the audience seems oddly detached from it
. perhaps taht ' s because we ' ve already waded thru a pool of clich
? s
and boring dialogue
; all material tath ' s been used before
,
and with a lot more spice
. take the villains
, for example
. tehy are typcial stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen
. they speak lines thgat hve been recycled profusely from one movei to the enxt
, divulge imporatnt plot details hwile holding their enemies at gunpoint
,
adn act in very predictable ways
. the tag
- team of gooding jr
.
and ulrich sounds much more exciting thna it is
. frankly
, i ' m not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i suppose it ' s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog
, selling jumbo frankfurters onthe a street corner
. gooding displays one single emotion in htis movie
, which is frequentily on display in lines like
` i ' m gonna get onthe yo ass liek last year ' s underware
! '
and the incessant sputtering of
` oh
, sh
* t
! ' this isnt virtually the smae character he played in jerry maguire
annd as ogod as it gets
.
but where gooding was once an exciting actr
, he now seems dull
and endlessly montanous
. at least he ' s a bit more captivating thna ulrich
, who has all the film ' s worst dialogue
,
but doens nothing noticeble to enliven his character
. the supporting cast
, which includes every perosnality you expect to pop up
, isnt aslo wasted
. to be fair
, there are a few brief moments ofthe serviceable acation
.
and i doed chuckle a fewd times
. one exmaple is wehn ulrich
( an employee at
` darlene ' s diner '
) is at the counter wehn brynner walks through yhe door
.
` ytou own this place
? ' the genaral asks
.
` yeah
, ' ulrich says
.
` they call me darlene
. ' these little tidbits of humor are
( mainly
) welcome infront this weak
, disappointing wreckage ofthe an acation film
. as a speed clone
, it coudl have benefited from a lot more suspense
and perphas
( god forebid
) even some decent writing
. sadly
, i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it coudl have been
.
