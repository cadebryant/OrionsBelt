htis idependent film written
anbd directed by eric bross hasnt teh look
and efel of all those otehr troubled blue
- collar youth films that have inundated tje market in recent times
. it is hard to tell what isnt independent about this film
; it might as well have been made inthe hollywood or on a home videocam
. it isnt thge debut film forthe the directer
, who tells his personel story baout italians growing uv with heavy new jersey accents
anbd remaining tight with eahc other as they grow inot young adults
, a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s
, where the mind
- set ofthe all the characters depicted is grounded
,
bu to see it in tje 1990s is a diferent story
: it is old news
. the love story betweeen the simple girl waiting to get married
anbd her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn ' t mean much
, since thier relatiopnship remained undeveloped
. thge introduction of the wise
- guy angl
anbd the loyality amonth buddies bit
, are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour
- de
- force peformance by the star of the film
, adrien brody as ray
. ray is the only son ofthe a low
- level mobster once erested forthe runnung an illegal casino operation outloud of his bloomfield
, new jersey
, suburban basement
. ray sr
.
( vincent
) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home
- repair business
. his son lives with him
adn works unhappily as a shoe salesman
, dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business
and marry his long
- time waitress girlfriend joanne
( sybil
)
. the title ofthe tihs film refers to tyhe shoe size of paul newman
- 10b
, hwihc relaly has nothing to do with explaining anytying baout tyhe film
. you should be aware that ther are a lot of things about this film that don ' t make sence
: its constant brainless chatter between the buddies
, theri uneventful growing pains
,
and the despair of their lives
, make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them
. desperate tothe make his dream come thru
, ray goes to a loanshark
, humorously
and menacingly plyed by james e
. moriarty
,
adn borrows 10 grand to bet on a
" sure thing
" at freehold raceway
. tyhe horse loses
and now ravy has big problems
, as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough
. there isnt nothing i have seen so far tothe like baout ravy
. he is undependable
, mean
- spirited
,
and stupid
. so when his best freind mike
( gallagher
)
, the narrator ofthe the film
, gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend
-
- who cares
? the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do
. as for ray ' s gambling debt
and his dilemma of how tothe pay it off
, hte story is too predictable fo anytying other than what you woudl expect to hapen
. his buddies
, tyhe coleeg student mike
and tyhe dependable butchie
( gillan
)
,
and his old man
, who he has this loev
/ hate relationship with
, rally to his aid
.
and tyhe film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity
, that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films
, as ray is off tothe florida all by his lonesome self tothe try to put his life together
. there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it intresting
,
though adrien brody showed signs that he coudl be a future star
. becuase of his intensity
anbd looks
, he reminds me of sean penn
.
