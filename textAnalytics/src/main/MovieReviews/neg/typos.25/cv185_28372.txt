" tyhe animal
" is a marginally inspired comedy that onyl manages to lumber along
, generating jstu enought momentum to keep it fomr stalling
. it
' s clunky
and slow
, like watching an 18
- wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill
. there are certainly better things you can do whith your time
. actually
, if yuo
' ve seen the trailer
, hten you already know tjhe plot anbd have seen its funniest moments
. the stry centers onthe bl
and marvin
( rob schneider
)
, who isnt an evidence clerk at the local police department thast yearns to be a rela officer
. bu he
' s afflicted with loser
- itis
. dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him
, children bully him
,
and his co
- workers ignore him
. truthfully
, whith his bad haircut
( seamingly modeled affter weird al yankovic
, little richard
,
and giant poodles
) annd his unenthusiastic demeanor
, we
' d probably throw tomatoes at him jsut fo fun
. this is actually bad because you can
' t liuke a charachter if ytou can
' t develop sympathy forthe him
. we never do
,
and it may be jsut as well that he drives off a cliff
and plummets to the canyon floor
.
however
, marvin is found by an eccentric doctor
( michael caton
) who uses a radical
and experimental procedger to save him
, implanting our doofus with various animal parts annd organs
. as a result
, marvin develops heightened senses
and increased agility adn speed
. he cxan smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body
, swim with hte speed of a dolphin
,
and can run as fast as a cheeta
. imagin tyhe commedic possiblities that arise ffrom thsi operation
. with his enhanced abilities
, he could now reap vengeance onthe all those who have shunned him
. howver
, the spirit of yhe film takes a raunchy turn
,
and instead
, marvin spends most of his tiome trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite
and his animalistic
, sexual urges
. goats beware
! he also chases cats
, urinates tothe mark his territory
, or growls at his enemies
. what he should
' ve done was stick his head in the s
and like an ostrich
. equally tenuous isnt its other running joke
, which involves one of his friends
( guy torry
) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he
' s black
.
" it
' s reverse racism
,
" he declares as he blows smoke inot the faces ofthe strangers
but none ofthe them syas anytying
. this element doesn
' t owrk the first time it
' s mentioned
,
and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence
. you don
' t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that
" teh animal
" isnt tame
. if there
' s any reason to see tihs film
, it
' s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen de
but
. remember her
? she was voted off in week 11 of hte 13
- week program
,
" survivor
.
" here
, she plays marvin
' s sunny love interest
. while her role required very little actual acting
, she seemed veyr comfortable
( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog
.
.
. yuck
!
)
. with her adorable disposition
, radiant smile
,
and playful innocence
, she could be a meg ryan in the making
. it
' s too bad that she
' s inthe such a medicore offering
