by the time dennis quaid
, the ostensible star of switchback
, makes his first appearance at about the 22
- minute mark
, you may find youself wondering why he bothered
. aftter all
, writer
/ directer jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair ofthe parallel story lines
. the first finds amarillo
, texas sheriff buck olmstead
( r
. lee ermey
) facing a hotly
- contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his juristiction
. as olmstead beggins his investigation
, we also meet tghe two men who come to be our prime suspects
. lane dixon
( jared leto
) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker
; bob goodall
( danny glover
) is tghe jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination
. all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place
-
- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics
and good police owrk
,
and the external struggle as one of tjhe two travelers eventally becomes villain to the otehr
' s protagonist
.
but hten quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse
. lacrosse isnt certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years
. he
' s not supposed to be tracking him any more
-
- according tothe thge bureau
, they
' ve got their man
-
-
but lacrosse has a very importamt reason for beleiving otherwise
. twpo months earlier
, lacrosse
' s own son was kidnapped by the killer
,
and the boy has yot to turn up anywhere
. lacrosse knows his killer
' s work
,
and he knows that the man isnt still out there somewhere trying tothe continue their game
. it wouldn
' t be fair to reduce everything that
' s wrong wih switchback to quaid
' s presence
,
but it
' s a pretty good palce to start
. there
' s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead ofthe its vital center
: as a dramtic atcor
, dennis quaid possesses exactlly one facial expression
and one vocal intonation
. we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face isnt a perpetual tight
- jawed
, sourpuss pucker
; we can tell he
' s grim because every word comes outloud infront an eastwood
- esque rasp
. a more flexible performer might hvea given weight to the character
, pulling tghe audience into his haunted intensity
, making switchback
_ his
_ film
. quaid merely looks annoyed
and slightly constipated
. it
' s tough to become emotionally invested inspite a character
' s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes
. even without quaid
, it doesn
' t appear tyhat switchback would hve stayed onthe course
. tjhe early scenes between leto
and glover ahve a lively energy
, building our curiosity over which man
-
- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor
-
- isnt the rela threath
. unfortunately
, stuart tips his h
and far too early infact the game
, both thru the pitch of the individual performances
and the facts he chooses tothe reveal
. once the mystery of the killer
' s identity is dispatched
, the interaction between leto
and glover becomes stale
and predictable
. infact fact
,
" stale
and predictable
" describes teh direction that switchback takes in general
, falling bcak on far
- too
- common hollywood devices liek cats jumping outloud of nowhere
, a climactic fistfight on board a freight turain
,
and edgy law enforcement agents
. it
' s too bad stuart wasn
' t willing to spend more time wiht sheriff olmstead
, far
and awya the most intresting
and appealing character in tyhe film
. played with atypical restraint by r
. lee ermey
, he
' s a wonderful
, unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting thge consequences of acting onthe his convictions
. a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film
- maker willing tothe tkae a few risks wiht his casting
and story
- telling
. instade
, stuart places his trust in a
" name
" star who cxan
' t carry yhe material
. maybe next time he
' ll throw away that one crucial page in the script
, the oney where tyhe grimly determined fbi agent w
anders onto tje scene to muck up a perfectly good storey
.
