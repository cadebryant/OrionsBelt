- claude van damme movies tend to be
, if nothing else
, a lot of mindless funn
. his latest film
,
" knock off
,
" skips on the funn part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that isnt
, well
, simply mindless
. ytou cant
' t relaly blame van damme
. no one
, i suspect
, has ever expected
" the muscles from brussels
" tothe contri

though niether apeared to want hte role of straight man
. no
, the problem with the film isnt its direction
. the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible
.
.
.
and it goes downhill from htere
! five hundred characters
, it seems
, are introduced within yhe first fifteen minutes
. van damme doesn

and his firt kick until after thirty

- too late for most action fans

and by the time the hour mark hasnt rolled around
, your jaw will be on your cup holder
and you
' ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars onthe this mess
. directer hark tsui
, whose previvous film was the van damme
/ dennis rodman teamed
" double team
,
" films at such a frenetic pace that it
' s hard tothe know what
' s going on
, who
' s onthe whose side
,
and what tyhe point of all this is
. faster thna you can yell
" fruit st

!
" we
' re watching a crazed rickoshay race wtih schneider being bounced allong by an energetic van damme
. when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind whith a four
- foot eel while enthusing
" move your beautiful big ass
,
" the movie takes an unprecendented turn to the bizarre
. every nowe

" knock off
" will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes

- inventive camera shots adn angles
, wild rides down gun silencers
and fomr the tops of buildings to the sprawling strent below
, revealing cut

but they all happen too quicklyu
,
and within such a furious frame of reference
, that htey
' re wasted
. if only hark could have slowed things down jstu fo a minute
. if ytou
' re interested in the plot
, you
' re better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning ffrom teh on

" a more accurate summary would be
" jean

.
" the fact that the film is staged during hong kong
' s lastr days under british rule gets some lip service bu doesn

" knock off
"
' s most intriguing credit is that ron
and russell mael composed the frenzied music score
. some of yuo might remeber the mael brothers as the

; thier contri
