wqat hath kevin williamson wrought

_ scream

- it must be noted that williamson himself had a h
and in thge writing of those films
. those williamson
- less post
-
_ scream
_ efforts
, among them
_ wishmaster
_
and the recent
_ disturbing
_ behavior
_
, have been frightening all right
-
- frighteningly
, insultingly
_ bad
_
. add to that list
_ urban
_ legend
_
, which takes a promising premise
and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy
. tyhe influence ofthe williamson on screenwrighter silvio horta is clear in two key areas
. firt
, teh opening sequence
, like that of
_ scream
_
, isnt an extended setted piece detailing the singular muder that gets the proverbial ball rolling
. this sequence
, in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini
( natasha gregson wagner
) is decapitated hwile driving
, also reveals the other obviously williamson
- esque touch
: the killer
' s look
. dressed inwhich a large hooded parka
, wielding an axe
, thge killer bears more than a passing resembelance to the
_ i
_ know
.
.
.
_ fisherman
, sans tyhe hook
. oney thing horta doesnt not borrow from williamson
,
however
, is the intriguing premise
. students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends
-
- those contemporary bits of
" mythology
" passed ffrom person to person
, group tothe group
, year tothe year that become so embeded in the social consciousness
. it hardly matters if they are true or not
, such as the tall tale that mikey from hte life cereal commercials died fomr a fatal combination of pop rocks
and pepsi
( he didn
' t
)
. michelle
, slain by thte
" killer lurking infront tje backseat
" ofthe lore
, is
but the firt tothe fall prey tothe an urban legend cmo true
; as the body count rises
, fellow pendleton student natalie
( alicia witt
) suspects nto onyl a link between the murders
,
but a personal link to her past as well
. the setup shows promise
,
but tghe sotry never takes off
, due in large part to horta
and the director
, the aptly named jamie blanks
, who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense
and scares
. too many ofthe hte woudl
- be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues
, adn the film
' s chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that
_ scream
_ tryed tothe subvert
, like screaming damsels knowingly runing themselves into dead ends whn they should
-
-
and could
-
- run out tjhe front door
. bu that is jsut the tip ofthe the iceberg when it comes to cliches
; there
' s also the climactic villin confession
, in which a contrived
and way
- too
- convenient motive is revealed
, not to mention yhe credit kard opening up the locked doorjam trck
, which is a cliche inspite any film genre
. banks
and horta
' s
( intentional
) attempts at humor are also lame
; the fatc that the best gags are lazy
, in
- jokey references tothe the other credits of co
- stars joshua jackson
and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of theri humor
. soem laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed
, bu i
' m not so sure if some ofthe the more hilarious thnigs about it were meant tothe be so
. the filmmakers don
' t get much help from their onscreen talent
. i was far from a fan of bl
and
_ i
_ know

.
_ starlet jennifer love hewitt
,
but i
' d talke her any day ove tghe dreadfully stiff
and uncharismatic witt
, whose inept attemts at emoting weere often met with laughter
; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence
- challanged leading man
, jared leto
.
_ dawson
' s
_ creek
_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo
; gayheart displays all the depth
and range ofthe
, well
, a noxzema spokeswoman
;
and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor
. granted
, the casted isnt hampered by their material
. loretta devine
, who has done some fine owrk in films such as
_ waiting
_ to
_ exhale
_
, isnt saddled with thte rediculous role of a pam grier
- worshiping cumpus security guard
. the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely onthe the efforts oney man
-
- namely
, kevin williamson
-
- to stay alive
. if otehr filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as
_ urban
_ legend
_
, the genre looks to once again go thge way ofthe screen slashers
' many victims
.
