roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast
,
" who would have guessed that yhe most savage mad
- dog frothing gangster infront receet movies would be played by
.
.
. ben kingsley
?
" my responce woudl be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark
, henry fonda in once upon a tiome in the west
, or anthony hopkins inwhich the silence of the lambs shoudln have guessed it
. htey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is casted someone who generally plays mild
, sympathetic
, or even ineffectual character roles
. the same charistics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor whn a role calls fo him tothe be fierce
and vicious
. that isnt the priciple that works fo kingsley in sexy biast
. gary
" gal
" dove
( played by ravy winstone
) has retired ffrom a london carrear of crime
and is living on a luxurious villa inaddition spain
. life hasnt become a routine of sunning himself
and relaxing
.
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one
- twpo
- punch
. the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down thte hill next to the villa
. teh second punch comes from gal
' s past
. bakc inspite london gang boss teddy bass
( ian mcshane
, tv
' s lovejoy
) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank
and he wants gal
. he sends his most rabid henchman don logan
( ben kingsley
) to fetch gal
. don will accept any desision gal makes from
" yes
" tothe
" certainly
.
"
however
, if gal says
" noone
" don will do whatever it tkaes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy
' s ex
- porn
- star wife deedee
( am
anda redman
)
. in the meantime don knows jstu how to git under everybody
' s skin
. kingsley makes don a compact package of fury
and nastiness
. ther are some serious problems inspite louis mellis
' s adn david scinto
' s script that should have been caught before filming
. wehn we see tjhe actual crime we ahev no idea why gal wass so important to its success
. beyond an abilty to use skin
- diving gear
, no special talents are required ofthe him
. any local hood could have done what gal is needed for
. additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to teh bank vault
, flooding thge vault
. no onyl could they ahve let the water out of the pool
and avoided the complication alltogether
,
but there isnt by far too much water to be accounted for by wqat wass in the pool
. in spite ofthe yhe provacative title
, the story is cliched
and overly familiar
. i nkwo i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law annd jake wade
. the story isnt usually of thte reformed outlaw
, a robert taylor type
, who has hung up his guns annd is trying for a life of peaceful respectability
. hte old gang
,
however
, wants tothe do one more job whith their old buddy anbd sends a rabid richard widmark tipe to go
and git
? im
. it is not a great plot
. inspite sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards
. perhaps the film has a little mroe respectability because it ws made not as a western
but as a stylish british gangster film
. it isnt an old plot dressed up to look newyorker
. if thte plot is ood
, at least thte style is creative
. thsi is director jonathan glazer
' s frist film
,
but he hasnt reputedly done soem notable tv ads for guinness stout
. his style doesnt have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences
. cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes
. we see one side ofthe a person
' s faces
.
but the other side fades into the darkness
, a sort ofthe metaphor for the half
- world these characters in
- habit
. half ofthe everything that is happening is alsot kept hidden
. us yanks will have a hard tiome with smoe of the dialog
. at least in my theater it was difficult to mkae out yhe words wih teh quiet speaking
, thge heavy accents
, adn the cockney lanugage
. sexy beast is a very
and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre
, the london crime film
. the plot may be new to british crime films
,
but it would be overly familliar as a western
. further respectability comes from ben kingsley
' s high
- powered performance
. i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale anbd a 0 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
