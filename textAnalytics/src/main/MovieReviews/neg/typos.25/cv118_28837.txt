roger ebert asks in his review ofthe sexy beast
,
" who would have guessed that the most savage mad
- dog frothing ganster in reccent movies woudl be played by
.
.
. ben kingsley
?
" my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark
, henry fonda in once upon a tyme iin the west
, or anthony hopkins infront teh silence of the lambs should have guessed it
. htey should know that tje way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild
, sympathetic
, or even ineffectual character roles
. the smae characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work inwhich his favor when a role calls for him tothe be fierce
and vicious
. tyhat is tje priciple that works for kingsley in sexy beast
. gary
" gal
" dove
( palyed by ravy winstone
) has retired fomr a london career ofthe crime
and is living on a luxurious villa in spain
. life has become a routine of sunning himself
and relaxing
.
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one
- two
- punch
. the first punch isnt a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa
. the second punch comes from gal ' s past
. back in london gang boss teddy bass
( ian mcshane
, tv ' s lovejoy
) is planning to break into a saftey deposit room inthe a bank
adn he wnats gal
. he sends his most rabid henchman don logan
( ben kingsley
) to fetch gal
. don will accept any decision gal makes from
" yes
" tothe
" certainly
.
"
howver
, if gal syas
" no
" don will dont whatever it tkaes to turn it into a yes including threatning guy ' s ex
- porn
- star wief deedee
( amanda redman
)
. in thge meantime don knows just how to get under everybody ' s skin
. kingsley makes don a compact package of fury
and nastiness
. there are soem serious problems in louis mellis ' s
and david scinto ' s script thast should have been caught befor filming
. when we see the actual crime we have noone idea why gal was so important to its sucess
. beyond an ablity to use skin
- diving gear
, no special talents are required of him
. any local hood could have done what gal is needed fo
. additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool tothe the bank vault
, flooding the vault
. no onyl could htey have let the water out ofthe the pool
and avoided the complication alltogether
,
bu ther is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool
. in spite ofthe the provocative title
, tje story is cliched
adn overly familiar
. i nkwo i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns liek thte law
anbd jake wade
. the story isnt usually of the reformed outlaw
, a robert taylor type
, who hasnt hung up his guns
and is trying forthe a life of peaceful respectability
. yhe old gang
,
however
, wants to do one more job with thier ood buddy
annd sends a rabid richard widmark type tothe go
and git
? im
. it is nto a great plot
. inaddition sexy beast even teh plot twists have gray beards
. perhaps the film hasnt a littel more respectability because it was made nto as a western
but as a stylish brittish gangster film
. it is an old plot dressed uv to look newyorker
. if tyhe plot is old
, at least the sytle is creative
. this is directer jonathan glazer ' s first film
,
bu he has reputedly done some notable tv ads fo guinness stout
. his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences
. cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes
. we see oen side ofthe a person ' s faces
.
but the other side fades inot the darkness
, a sort of metaphor for the half
- world these characters in
- habet
. half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden
. us yanks iwll have a hard time with some ofthe the dialouge
. at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking
, the heavy accents
,
and the cockney language
. sexy beast is a very
annd familiar minor plot lent respectability inaddition tje us by being done infact what is here a still somewhat novel genre
, tje london crime film
. the plot may be new to brittish crime films
,
but it owudl be overly familliar as a western
. further respectability comes from ben kingsley ' s high
- powered performence
. i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
