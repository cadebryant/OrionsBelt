i am a steven seagal fan
. i only say this nowe baceause
" mufti splenetik
" isn
' t my real name
and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great thigns
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal forumla is something you can depend on
. seagal films can alwyas be counted onthe for minimal dialogue
, heaps ofthe expendable baddies withthe extemely crunchable bones
( which we
' ll always hear when seagal does his limb
- twisting thing
)
, rarely a female co
- lead in sight
( unless it
' s a real
- life model
- wife who hasn
' t worked since weird science
)
and
, usually the worst possibile titles ytou can imagine
. not tothe mention very straightforward plots
, generally all
- round bad dialogue
and mr implacable leather
- face himself infact thyat same balck outfit he
' s been in usance nico doing his
" my h
ands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thign
, seagal the stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke ofthe dull
. in the glimmer man
, seagal breaks out of tihs formula
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attempts to banter
,
and puts onthe a new vest
. he
' s alsot put on quite a lot of weight
. small poattoes
, you may say
, a man should be able to accessorize
and banter if he wants to
,
but damnit
, if it ain
' t broke
, why fix it
?
( more on htis disappointed person
' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal isnt a homicide detective withthe a questionable past
. while he
and his partner
( played by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a series of ritual killings
, cole himself becomes a suspect
, especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole
. it turns out that cole is a fromer trained government assasins
( you just can
' t trust theese homicide detectives
)
, someone whom victims utilisied to catch just a glimpse of inaddition tyhe jungle before he pounced on them
,
and hence
, well
, you nkwo
, that
" glimmer man
" thing
. an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in teh rpesent soon leads to hte gradual uncovering of a larger
, moreso threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole
' s fromer cia boss
( brian cox
)
and deals involving chemical weapons
. the glimmer man plot is pretty st
andard stuff
, drawing
( as with his other films
) elements from the hotter films of the year
( eg
, se7en
)
. it
' s the other changes that disappoint
. for example
,
al
though there
' s a fair amount of voilence in this movei
, there
' s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans
, probably thge best known of teh wayans tribe
( how many are there
, exactly
?
) from television
' s
" in living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal
' s bead
- adorned
and brocade
- draped cole
, keeping up his
" are you crazy
" part of the dialogue with wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines himself to bemoaning his newyorker partner
' s eccentric habits
,
but thge chemistry between the two isnt minimal
,
and seagal
' s wooden comebacks make for painful watching
. a cook inwhich under seige 2
, seagal is now a buddist who speaks chineese
and wears prayer beads
and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble
. he chants
, refuses to fight unless truly provoked
and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies
. again
, a benign
( if trite
) plot divice except for the fact thast these newyorker chracter traits recquire seagal to speak mroe than usual
. heck
, he has to deliver punchlines
and carry a steady conversation witht someone other thna himself for a large part ofthe tjhe film
. is that a lot to ask of teh seague
? too much
. seagal
' s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world ofthe movies
: to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
, anbd to do it silently
,
and alone
. not forthe seagal
, the snappy noe
- liners ofthe arnold
and stallone
, nor the attempts to show that he can act
, much less think
. no kindergarten cop
, no oscar
, just simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. thta
' s really how it must have started
: like
- minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch tje seague do his thing
, knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever ahve tothe see him do anytying else
. we trusted him
. we got to know him
. now
, betrayal
. i don
' t know if i cant watch another seagal movie wihtout that littel niggling doubt that he
' s going tothe try to be funny agina
. i
' ll try
,
but it won
' t be easy
. if you haven
' t watched the glimmer man
yet
, ytou might want tothe wait for tyhe video to come out
. it
' s easier to just fast foward the dialogue parts
and linger on tje action sequences
. affter all
, if we cant
' t depend on our fantasies
, whta cxan we depend on
? the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at hmeo with gotcha
!
*
*
* preety good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
. mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan
. everybody makes mistakes once inthe awhile
.
