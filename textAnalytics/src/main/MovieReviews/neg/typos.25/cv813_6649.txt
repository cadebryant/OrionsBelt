i am a steven seagal fan
. i only sday htis now because
" mufti splenetik
" isn ' t my real nmae
adn beccause i probaly ened to explain why i went into htis film expecting great thnigs
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that tghe seagal formula isnt something you can depend on
. seagal films can alwasy be counted on for minimal dialogue
, heaps ofthe expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones
( which we ' ll always hear when seagal does his limb
- twisting thing
)
, rarely a female co
- lead iin sight
( unless it ' s a real
- life model
- wief who hasn ' t worked since weird science
)
and
, usually tje worst possable titles you can imagine
. not to mention very straightforward plots
, generaly all
- round bad dialogue
and mr implacable leather
- face himself in that same black outfit he ' s been in sicne nico doing his
" my hands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thing
, seagal the stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke of dull
. in the glimmer man
, seagal breaks out of this formula
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attemts to banter
,
and puts on a newyorker vest
. he ' s also put on quite a lot of weight
. small otatoes
, you may say
, a man should be able to accessorize
annd banter if he wants to
,
but damnit
, if it ain ' t borke
, why fix it
?
( more on this disapointed person ' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal is a homicide detective whith a questonable past
. while he
annd his partner
( played by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a series of ritual killings
, cole himself becomes a suspect
, especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practially nothing onthe cole
. it turns outloud thyat cole is a former trained government assassin
( you just can ' t trust theese homocide detectives
)
, someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle befoer he pounced onthe them
,
anbd hence
, well
, you know
, that
" glimmer man
" thnig
. an increasingly fishy homocide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger
, more threatning conspiracy tyhat involves a crooked businessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole ' s former cia boss
( brian cox
)
adn deals involving chemical weapons
. the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff
, drawing
( as with his other films
) elements from the hotter films of the year
( eg
, se7en
)
. it ' s the other changes that dissapoint
. for example
,
although there ' s a fair ammount of violence in this movie
, there ' s also tyhe disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans
, probably the best known of the wayans tribe
( how many are there
, exactly
?
) from television ' s
" inwhich living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal ' s bead
- adorned
adn brocade
- draped cole
, keeping up his
" are yuo crazy
" part of the dialogue with wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner ' s eccentric habits
,
but the chemistry beween the two is minimal
,
adn seagal ' s wooden comebacks make for painful watching
. a cook infact under seige 2
, seagal is nowe a buddhist who speaks chineese
and wears prayer beads
adn intricate silk jackets over his normal black ansamble
. he chants
, refuses tothe fight unless truly provoked
and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies
. again
, a benine
( if trite
) plot device except fo the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak moreso than usual
. heck
, he hasnt to deliver punchlines
and cary a steady conversation with someone other than hismelf for a larg part of the film
. isnt that a lot tothe ask ofthe the seague
? too much
. seagal ' s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this arleady complicated world ofthe movies
: to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
,
anbd to do it silently
,
and alone
. nto for seagal
, the snappy one
- liners ofthe arnold
and stallone
, nor the attempts to sohw tyhat he can act
, much less think
. noone kindergarten cop
, noone oscar
, just simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. that ' s raelly how it must have started
: liek
- minded fans who knew what htey wanted streamed in to watch the seague dont his thing
, knowing thgat never iin tje seagal universe woudl they ever have to see him dont anything alse
. we trusted him
. we got to know him
. nowe
, betrayal
. i don ' t nkwo if i can watch another seagal movie wihtout that little niggling doubt that he ' s going to try to be funny again
. i ' ll try
,
but it won ' t be easy
. if you haven ' t watched the glimmer man
yet
, ytou might want to wait for the video to come out
. it ' s easier to just fast forward teh dialogue parts
and linger on hte action sequences
. after all
, if we cxan ' t depend on our fantasies
, what cxan we depend on
? the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcasted
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at hmeo with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
. mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan
. everybody makse mistakes once in awhile
.
