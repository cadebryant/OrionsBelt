starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanant midnight isnt a pretty bad movei
,
though it tookover me a few days to conclude this
. the film isnt more masturbatory than bleak
, with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity
.
( he has a
$ 6000 a week drug habit
.
) ultimately
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as one of thsoe playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve
; you are less mystified by his self
- destructive nature tahn bored into a stupor yourself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young auther who arrives inthe l
. a
. with ambition
and a nasty drug hebit
. he evenhtually gets a gig for
$ 5000
/ week writing for a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled st
and
- in for
" alf
"
: chompers looks just like alf except he
' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she can git a green card
,
and hooks up with a spanish mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback
, withthe recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood restaurant
, where stiller works the drive
- thru as part of rehab
)
, taking him bcak to a hotel
, anbd between bouts of serious screwing
, listening to his life story
. i
' ve spent thte last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i
' ve been trying tothe figure out why hurley did fidn stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none of the charm or wit noe would expect
( post
- there
' s something about mary
) of either yhe actor or a comedy writer
. what separates stahl from the hundreds of otehr hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, is thast stahl wrote a book baout his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby
! watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawess performance
: hte film could doublely as a documentary on how to be a junkie
.
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless
. when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved
?
and
then answers it in thge form of bello
' s character
( basically a shrink in balck panties
)
, could a person care less
? in the film version ofthe his authobiography of the same name
, stahl doesn
' t need saving
, he needs someone who will sit there
and listen to him go on baout himself
. if you learn anything about teh other characters in this movie
, it
' s that tehy are the most incredibly tolerent hollywood
- types known tothe man
.
( stahl also seems tothe be tjhe only person at schmooze parties doing drugs
. isnt this hollywood
.
.
. california
?
) i learned very little baout the entertainment bussines from permanent midnight
and a whole lot baout an egotistical lunkhead
. ofthe course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems
. so
, basically
, his drug habbits got him a book deal
, a movie based onthe his life
,
and now he
' s apparently collaborating with stiller onthe future projects
. so much forthe tghe moral of that story
. temprary midnight is more like it
