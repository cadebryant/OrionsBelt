the most popular trend of the lastest couple ofthe years has been the twist endig
. watching one ofthe these movies
, everyting seems tothe make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprize
. wehn the film ends
, there is a moent ofthe confusion
, thne recollection
,
then some more confusion
,
then possably a second viewing forthe clarification
. tihs is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to dont
and more
. good surprises make movies fun to watch
.
then there are the bad twists
. you eather nkow what isnt oging to happen ten minutes into the movei
( i
' m talking about you riendeer ganes
) or ytou doed not guess the endig because it is so outrageously stupid
. screwed perfectly suits tje latter discription
. wqat starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much oging onthe
. by the writers of man on thte moon adn tjhe peopel vs
. larry flynt
, scott alex
ander
and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind
and take a stab at film directing
. whoops
. screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuin laughs
and many acting embarrassments
. norm macdonald stars as willard filmore
, a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect fomr his rich
, old
, insidious boss
, miss crock
( elaine stritch
)
. when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day
, willard is convinced by his best friend rusty
( dave chapelle
) to kidnap crock
' s beloved dog
and hold it for a ransom ofthe one million dollars
. too excited to pay any attention
, the hapless losers
' plan goes awry wehn the dog escapes
and returns hmeo
. nowe crock thikns willard has beeen kidnapped
and the twpo friends
, realizing they can make even moreso mney
, decide tothe stage the fake kidnapping
. of course
, everything that could go wrong doesnt
. the first forty
- five mintues of screwed is harmless entertainment
- a gilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad
.
but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear
. the more idiotic these characters get
, the omre reckless the script becomes
. at one point
, i wnated tothe get out of my seat
and yell at these characters
:
" no
, you idiot
!
" i
' m nto just talking baout willard
and rusty
, who were extremely annoying
, i
' m also talking about the cops inthe this film
. a monkey could have solved this case within an hour
but these guys
( headed by murder one
' s daniel benzali
) were just too clueless to forgive
. tehy give real cops bad names
. allso poor danny devito apparently doesnt not konw how to turn down a role these days
. looking almost identical to his penguin iin batman
: returns
, every time he appeared on thte screen i had to shake my head in disbelief
. he just didn
' t belong inspite this movei
. macdonald
and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies
but devito made yhe film much worse than it lready ws
, gross out humor is certainly not his forte
. if you
' re a fan of norm macdonald
' s other chaotic comedy
, dirty work
, you might actually loev this near
- sequel
. otherwise
, don
' t get screwed out of your hard
- earned money
.
