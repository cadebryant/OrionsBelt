my giant is two movies for yhe price of one
,
bu neither is worth thte cost of admission
, even if ytou get in free
. as lamely directed by michael lehmann
, the picture tries to be a comedy by using
and reusing every giant joke in the book
.
(
" without goliath
, david is just some punk throwing rocks
.
"
) languidly paced throughout
, the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer
( the omen
) meanders towrad its sad ending
. sicne it ' s rarely funny or convincingly dramtic
, what tje filmmakers thought htey were doign remains a mistery
. other than a few nice visuals
, htere ' s nothing to reccommend the picture
. with graet film comedies under his belt fomr when harry met sally
? to the original city slickers
, billy crystal hasnt shown that he ' s more thna the world ' s best oscar host
. he does
,
however
, have a propensity for chosing hopeless material as in last year ' s father ' s day
and this yera ' s my giant
. one wonders if he reads the scirpt before agreeing to go ahead with a project
. surely reading thge noe forthe my giant would have shown that there was nothing there
. prehaps he thought he could ad lib it into sucess
. or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor
and throught he could do something serious with the movei ' s somber tone
. the most charitable thign taht could be said about it is that it isnt so ineffectual that peple will probably foreget tehy saw it by the next day
. this one
- joke movie ' s single idea is to place rela
- life basketball palyer gheorghe muresan
, who stands seven
and a half feet tall
, into as many visually striking situations as possible
. sammy
( crystal
)
, an agent currently without clients
, is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max
( muresan
)
. aftter throwing out constatn noe
- liners
(
" either god isnt in thge salvage business or big foot just tookover my car
.
"
)
, sammy decides to get serious
, seeing max as his meal ticket
.
and
although he doesn ' t like it
, he ' s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half
- dozen dwarfs
.
( the movie itself knwos no bounds as it countains oney of teh most putrid
anbd lengthy vomiting scenes ever
.
) after a serieses ofthe missed opportunities
, the comedic part ofthe the movie is over
,
and it turns inot a cheap
and maudlin disease movei
. we learn that max ' s condition is terminal
,
and he will soon dieu
. to be fair
, the movei does contain a few good scenes
- all of hwihc you cxan see in the trailers
. let ' s hope billy gets himself a pair ofthe reading glasses befor he signs up forthe anyother movei
. my giant runs too long even at just 1
: 37
. it is rated pg for voilence
and profanity
annd would be acceptable for kids arround ten
anbd up
. my son jeffrey
and his friend matthew
, both 9
, gave the movie a single star
and had nothing good to say baout it
. matthew pointed outloud that it
" is not as ogod as it could have been or shoudl have been
.
"
( amen
.
) he went onthe to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in thge middle
. jeffrey complained patricularly baout how gross thte movie was
.
