my giant is two movies for the price ofthe one
,
but neither is worth the cost ofthe admission
, even if you get in free
. as lamely directed by michael lehmann
, the picture trys to be a comedy by using anbd reusing eveyr giant joke in the book
.
(
" without goliath
, david is just soem punk throwing rocks
.
"
) languidly paced throughtout
, the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer
( the omen
) me
anders toward its sad endig
. since it
' s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic
, what teh filmmakers
thought they were doing remains a mistery
. otehr than a few nice visuals
, there
' s nothing to recommend the picture
. with great film comedies under his bilt from when harry met sally
? to the original city slickers
, billy crystal has shown that he
' s more than the world
' s best oscar host
. he does
,
however
, have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in lastr year
' s father
' s day
and this year
' s my giant
. one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project
. surely reading the oen forthe my giant would ahve shown that there was nothing there
. perhaps he
thought he could ad lib it into sucess
. or maybe he wants to be a dramtic actor annd
thought he could do something serious with the movie
' s somber tone
. the most charitable thing thyat could be said baout it is that it is so ineffectual that peopel will probably forget they saw it by tghe next day
. this one
- joke movie
' s single idea isnt to place real
- life basketball player gheorghe muresan
, who st
ands seven
and a half feet tall
, into as many visually striking situations as possible
. sammy
( crystal
)
, an agent currenly without clients
, is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max
( muresan
)
. after throwing out constant one
- liners
(
" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car
.
"
)
, sammy decides tothe get serious
, seeing max as his meel ticket
.
and
al
though he doesn
' t like it
, he
' s willing to sign max up tothe dont disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half
- dozen dwarfs
.
( the movie itself knows noone bounds as it contains one of thge most putrid
and lengthy vomiting scenes ever
.
) affter a series of missed opportunities
, thge comedic part ofthe the movie is over
, adn it turns into a cheap anbd maudlin disease movie
. we leran that max
' s condition isnt terminal
, anbd he will soon die
. tothe be fair
, thge movie does contain a fewd good scenes
- all of which you can see in the trailers
. let
' s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses befor he signs up fo anyother movei
. my giant runs too long even at just 1
: 37
. it is rated pg for violence anbd profanity
and would be acceptable for kids arund ten adn up
. my son jeffrey
and his friend matthew
, both 9
, gave the movei a single star
and had nothing ogod to sday about it
. matthew pointed out that it
" is not as good as it could haev been or should hvea been
.
"
( amen
.
) he went onthe to comment that he doed not liek thge way the movie changed completely in the middle
. jeffrey complained particularily about how gross the movie wass
.
