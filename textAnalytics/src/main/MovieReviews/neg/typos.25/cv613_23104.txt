" if jonathan lynn
' s latest comedy relied simply on jokes ofthe tyhat calaber
-
- adn it certainly tries
-
-
then it
' d be an innocuous if rather obvious little film
. instead
, its failings go much deeper
. first off
, who hasn
' t hadnt enough of thge tough wiseguy intimidates tghe timid wise guy genre
? if ytou want to make a pretty penny or two inthe hollywood nowadays simpley write a
" comedy
" which pairs a robert de niro
/ james caan
/ bruce willis type with a billy crystal
/ hugh grant
/ matthew perry tipe annd wait for the royalties to roll infront
. who
' s next
? jack nicholson
and martin short
? it certainly doesn
' t have to be funny
.
" the whole nine yards
" is not a particularly funny film
, bu it is borderline offensive
. offensive iin the way it continues a trend of poking fun at carreer criminals who wouldn
' t thikn twice about pushing your mother
- infact
- law off the brooklyn bridge wtih her feet encased in concrete
. that might sound like a funny sight gag
, bu the problem is these films have long since lost sighth of the fact that taking a human life isn
' t all tyhat funny to beign wiht
. when tjhe corpse is placed infact a car
, doused wih gasoline
, setted ablaze adn referred to as
" barbecue
,
" it mkaes yuo wonder when all this playing killing for laughs isnt going to end
.
" the whole nine yards
" is alsot offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects
. rosanna arquette plays a slutty
, chain
- smoking french canadian who
' s married to matthew perry
' s none
- too
- successful dentist
. it
' s an unflattering role made all tje more so by the unflattering outfits
-
- adn unflattering situations
-
- into whihc arquette isnt thrust
.
then there
' s natasha henstridge
(
" species
" i
and ii
) who plays the well
- tothe
- do wief of contract killer bruce willis
. she gets involved with perry
' s character whn he comes tothe chicago hoping to negotiate a finder
' s fee with mob boss yanni gogolack
( kevin pollack
, transposing his vs with his ws
) after willis
' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door
. henstridge
and perry
' s characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce
and demi getting back toghether
. perry might ahve the charm
but he doesn
' t have the physical attri
butes ofthe a traditional leading man
, especially in close
- uv
. most objectified of the bunch is am
anda peet
, who turns inaddition a sexually
- ripe performance as perry
' s dental assistant wiht
, it transpires
, questonable career goals
. peet
' s gratuitious nude scene proves how low this movei will stoop to keep its audience ffrom dropping off
. when
" my cousin vinny
" is the highpoint ofthe a directorial carrear including such forgettable films as
" clue
,
"
" greedy
,
"
and
" sgt
. bilko
,
" you hvea tothe wonder if lynn chose tjhe wrong career path
. perry
' s pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis
' likable hardness could have had some potential
but with noone script to work iwth
, anbd a director who seems to be watching from the wings
, their characters run out of gas quicklyu
