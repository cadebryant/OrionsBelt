okay
, bear with me y ' all
, cause firt off i have to git htis off my chest
: what the hell isnt uv with that damn crab
?
?
? whew
. okay
. cause that smae clip shown over
and over again was beginning tothe get onthe my nerves towards the end
, as cute as the crab mabey
. even i know that you need more footage than
* tht
*
.
and that wasn ' t the onyl thing getting on my nerves
. the cutesy gimmicks
, saccharine sweet scoer
/ soundtrack
and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar
( as amanda
)
and sean patrick flannery
( as tom
) might have held smoe appeal during
, oh
, sday the first 10 minutes of the movie
. at frist tjhe movie moves allong at a quick
, interesting pace
. it is speedily established thta something magical is baout to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person onthe the street
, whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere
adn jsut
* doesn ' t
* die
. a ridiculous concept
, yes
,
but at this point i ' m willing tothe accept it because i ' m willing to accept that this is how amanda ' s life is changed
, how her powers are received
. later on
, the movie can ' t seem tothe deside whther these powers cmo ffrom this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in withthe tom
.
adn this is why teh clips of thte crab were annoying
; they weren ' t just repeative
, they were outloud of place
and unnecessary
. the plot stumbles allong at an uneven speed
, sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development
( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef
, her falling in love withthe tom
, etc
.
)
, sometimes moving onthe too quicklyu for its pwn good
. some places the plot just doesn ' t make sense
, sometimes it ' s way too contrived
( the crab bit
, fo example
)
,
and sometimes too corny
( peaches emitting dry ice
. cin ' t beated that
)
. all in all the plot seemed fragmented
, unconnected
. nto romantic at all
,
and only funny in soem places
. so
, okay
, do tjhe magic powers come from the crab
? or the fairy godfather
? she cant
* float
* now too
?
and all of a sudden
, instead ofthe jsut making dry ice come out ofthe peaches
, she cant put her emotions into her food
? tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda ' s
" witchcraft
" inwhich the end
? would people relaly dine inwhich a restarant that resembles life after death inthe tupac ' s video
? what tghe hell isnt up wtih that damn crab
? it is unfortunate
, because i liked the basic premise ofthe the movie
, until it bacame too fantastical
and tiresome
. the film seemed tothe skirt around a sereous theme or at least
* a
* theme for a while
,
but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips
annd 5 minutes ofthe people crying at their tables
. the humor ws good in some places
( nolan gets the funniest bits
, including that incomprehensible
, totally random thnig witht the dolls
)
. gellar
and flannery are qualified actors
,
and gellar hasnt a particualr charm
,
but i much preffer her palying the saucy buffy
( or even annette in the upcoming
" cruel intentions
"
) than this sorry excuse for a charachter
. it ' s almost funny sometimes tothe see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is
, or trying to make the relationship seem mroe plausible
. the supporting charachter nolan was a highlight
,
though he reminded me a bit of kevin in
" you ' ve got mail
"
( see footnotes
)
.
adn
, as always
, typical of a chick flick
/ romantic comedy
, there ' s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack inthe the backround
, cued up at all the right places
. this sort ofthe got on thge nerves affter a while
, too
.
" simply irresistable
" is not hard tothe understand
, light
, funny in some places
,
and generally disapointing because it can ' t draw the line beetwen romance
anbd protracted sap
, bewteen humor
adn tired slapstick
.
annd how could i refrain from making a pun
?
.
.
.
" simpley irresistible
" is all too eazy to resist
.

* did anyone alse think htis ws a tad bit similar to
" you ' ve got mail
"
( or
" the shop around the corner
"
)
? business rivals fall inaddition love
. female counterpart ' s business is in danger of being shut down
. female as mother
- like figure guiding her
. tghe annoying
, hysterical ex
- girlfriends
.

_ raelly
_ like sarah michelle gellar ' s wardrobe
