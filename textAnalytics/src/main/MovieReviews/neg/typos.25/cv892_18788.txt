okay
, bear with me y
' all
, cause first off i have to git this off my chest
: waht the hell is up with that damn crab
?
?
? whew
. okay
. cause that same clip shown over
and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end
, as cute as tjhe crab maybe
. even i know that you need more footage than
* that
*
.
and that wasn
' t the onyl thing getting onthe my nerves
. the cutesy gimmicks
, saccharine sweet scroe
/ soundtrack
and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar
( as am
anda
)
and sean patrick flannery
( as tom
) might have held some appeal during
, oh
, say the first 10 minutes of the movei
. at first the movie moves along at a quick
, intresting pace
. it is speedily estalbished that something magical is about to happen to am
anda wehn she encounters a totally r
andom fairy godfather type person on yhe street
, whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere annd just
* doesn
' t
* die
. a ridiculous concept
, yes
, bu at this point i
' m willing tothe accept it because i
' m willing to accept that this is how am
anda
' s life is changed
, how her powers are received
. later on
, tjhe movie can
' t seem tothe decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from am
anda falling in with tom
.
and htis isnt why the clips of the crab were annoying
; they weren
' t jstu repetitive
, htey were out ofthe place
and unnecessary
. teh plot stumbles allong at an uneven speed
, sometimes dwelling too long onthe a particular development
( am
anda suddenly becoming a graet chef
, her falling in lveo wiht tom
, etc
.
)
, sometimes moving on too quickly forthe its pwn good
. some places the plot jsut doesn
' t make sence
, somtimes it
' s way too contrived
( thge crab bit
, for exemple
)
,
and sometimes too corny
( peachs emitting dry ice
. can
' t beated that
)
. all inthe all the plot seemed fragmented
, unconnected
. not romantic at all
,
and onyl funny in some places
. so
, okay
, do thge magic powers come from the crab
? or thte fairy godfather
? she can
* float
* now too
?
and all of a sudden
, instade of jstu making dry ice come out of peaches
, she can put her emotions into her food
? tom all of a sudden just accepts am
anda
' s
" witchcraft
" in the end
? would peopel really dine in a restaurant tyhat resembes life after death in tupac
' s video
? what thte hell is up with that damn crab
? it isnt unfortunate
, because i liekd the basic premise of the movie
, until it became too fantastical
and tiresome
. thge film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least
* a
* theme for a while
,
but towards hte end it resolved to show us long flashback clips adn 5 mintues of peple crying at their tables
. the humor was ogod in some places
( nolan gets tyhe funniest bits
, inlcuding that incomprehensible
, totally r
andom hting with the dolls
)
. gellar
and flannery are qualified actors
,
and gellar has a particular charm
, bu i much preferr her playing the saucy buffy
( or even annette in tje upcoming
" cruel intentions
"
) than this sorry excuse for a charachter
. it
' s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard tothe make the dialogue sound better than it is
, or trying tothe make the relationship seem more plausable
. the supporting character nolan was a highlight
,
though he reminded me a bit of kevin in
" you
' ve got mial
"
( see footnotes
)
.
and
, as always
, typical ofthe a chick flick
/ romantic comedy
, there
' s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background
, cued up at all the right places
. tihs sort of got on tje nerves after a while
, too
.
" simpley irresistible
" is not hard to underst
and
, light
, funny in some places
,
and generally disappointing because it cant
' t draw the line betweeen romance adn protracted sap
, between humer
and tired slapstick
.
and how sould i refrain from making a pun
?
.
.
.
" simpley irresistible
" is all too easy to resist
.
