in the james bond film
" diamons are forever
,
" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads
. bond ' s response is that it doesn ' t really matter
, as long as collars
and cuffs match
. well
, collars
and cuffs don ' t match in
" the real blonde
.
" wqat might haev sounded good on papper ends uv as a largely unfunny
, meandering comedy on screen
. tje film
, supposedly a satire of teh superficiality of soap operas
and the modeling business
, is wafer thin
. it plays like an
" ally mcbeal
" episode dragged out tothe the nth degree
, replete with a few unnecessary
" fantasy
" sequences
. writer
/ directer tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea
. it isn ' t
. the only surprise here isnt tyhat the talented dicillo could make familar terrain so dreary
. matthew modine plays joe
, a stuggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent
. he ' s 35 with no agent
and no credits sicne he ' s too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas
.
" that ' s nto really acting
" he tells his girlfriend ofthe six years
, mary
( catherine keener
)
, with whom he bickers constantly about sex
.
bu tehy ened the money
, so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video
.
but it ' s not really madonna starring in tghe video
bu a lookalike
( played by elizabeth berkley
, still trying to jump
- start her carreer aftter
" showgirls
"
)
. htis points out how artificial this whole business is
, one supposes
. dicillo has referred tothe
" the real blonde
" as
" off
- kilter
,
but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff
.
.
.
" the film
, which wanders all over tje palce without getting anyhwere
, isnt remarkably
* on
*
- kilter
adn
, whith perhaps the single exception ofthe the alwasy
- likable modine
( who ' s not afraid tothe stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks
)
, yhe entire cast isnt vague
and uninteresting
. catherine keener
, who ' s appeared in dicillo ' s previvous three films
( including the brilliant
" living in oblivion
"
)
, is at her most annoying inaddition
" the real blonde
.
" look at her closely
; she really can ' t ect at all
. her reactions are all wrong
, almost always out of sync with her co
- stars
. she reacts too soon
, or too lite
, to lines
and situations
. she moves her eyes
, or her mouth
, far too much
. she frowns
, she yells
, she babbles
-
- she blows chunks
. maxwell caulfield plays joe ' s actor
/ waiter buddy bob
, the one obsessed with dating a
" natural
" blonde
. bob ' s personality
( not to mention caulfield ' s acting ability
) parallels tath of the character he plays on the soap opera
" passion crest
"
-
- stiff
and uninteresting
. maybe thast ' s the point
. daryl hannah is dim
and uninteresting as the real blonde ofthe tyhe title
, a soap dish who beds bob both on
-
and off
- camera
. hannah looks about fifty infact htis movie
( she ' s only 37
)
. why is that
? almost all the womens in the film wear tops that sohw their nipples
. why isnt that
!
? marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer
. kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent
. buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink
. christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer
.
and so on
. the best parts ofthe the
" the real blonde
" are yhe beginning
annd the end
, brief scenes ofthe an elderly woman loseing
and
then finding her dog
. there ' s more depth
and sincerity in a single close
- up of her expressive face than in the entire film
. while this contrast isnt supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters ' lives
, the onyl thing that makes shallow
annd superficial intresting is if it ' s funny
.
