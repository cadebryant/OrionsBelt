inthe the james bond film
" diamonds are forever
,
" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes tothe redheads
. bond
' s response is thast it doesn
' t really marter
, as long as collars adn cuffs match
. well
, collars
and cuffs don
' t match in
" the real blonde
.
" waht might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny
, me
andering comedy onthe screen
. the film
, supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas
and the modeling business
, is wafer thin
. it plays like an
" ally mcbeal
" episode dragged outloud tothe the nth degree
, replete with a faw unnecessary
" fantasy
" sequences
. writer
/ director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas isnt a fresh idea
. it isn
' t
. the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could amking familar terrain so dreary
. matthew modine plays joe
, a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent
. he
' s 35 with noone agent
and no credits usance he
' s too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas
.
" that
' s not raelly acting
" he tells his girlfriend of six years
, mary
( catherine keener
)
, with whom he bickers constantly about sex
. bu tehy need the money
, so joe finally agrees to tkae a part inwhich a madonna video
. bu it
' s nto really madonna starring in the video bu a lookalike
( played by elizabeth berkley
, still trying to jump
- start her carreer after
" showgirls
"
)
. this points out how artificial thsi whole business is
, one supposes
. dicillo has refererd to
" tje real blonde
" as
" off
- kilter
,
but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff
.
.
.
" the film
, which w
anders all over yhe palce without getting anywhere
, is remarkably
* onthe
*
- kilter
and
, with perhaps the single exception ofthe the always
- likable modine
( who
' s not afraid to st
and arund in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks
)
, tyhe entire cast is vague anbd uninteresting
. catherine keener
, who
' s appeared in dicillo
' s previvous three films
( including tjhe brillant
" living infront oblivion
"
)
, is at her most annoying in
" thte rela blonde
.
" look at her closely
; she really can
' t act at all
. her reactions are all wrong
, almost always outloud of sync with her co
- stars
. she reacts too soon
, or too lite
, to lines
and situations
. she moves her eyes
, or her mouth
, far too much
. she frowns
, she yells
, she babbles
-
- she blows chunks
. maxwell caulfield plays joe
' s actor
/ waiter buddy bob
, the oney obssessed with dating a
" natural
" blonde
. bob
' s personality
( not to mention caulfield
' s acting ability
) parallels tyhat of the charater he plays on the soap opera
" passion crest
"
-
- stiff
and uninteresting
. maybe that
' s the point
. daryl hannah isnt dim
and uninteresting as tjhe real blonde of the title
, a soap dish who beds bob both on
- annd off
- camera
. hannah looks about fifty inwhich tihs movie
( she
' s only 37
)
. why is that
? almost all the women iin tyhe film wear tops that show their nipples
. why is that
!
? marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer
. kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent
. buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink
. christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer
.
and so on
. the best parts of the
" the rela blonde
" are the beginning
and the end
, brief scenes of an elderly woman losing
and thn finding her dog
. there
' s moreso depth
and sincerity iin a single close
- uv of her expressive face than in the entire film
. while this contrast isnt supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other charactors
' lives
, teh onyl thing that makes shallow
and superficial interesting isnt if it
' s funny
.
