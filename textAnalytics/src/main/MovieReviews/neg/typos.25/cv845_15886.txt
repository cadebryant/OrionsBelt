waht a contrast
! in the spoace of two dyas
, i saw shakespeare inthe loev
and hurlyburly
. i
' m not sure you could get twpo moreso different movies
. while the former was all over the top
, telegraphing everything
, shoving its philosophy ofthe life down our throats
, hurlyburly was teh complete opposite
, wound so tight
and wiht so much buried in its script
, one could spend weeks thinking about it
. this is one interesting movie
. it
' s very much in a similar vein tothe one ofthe my favourite movies of
' 98
, in the comapany of men
,
al
though not quite so nasty
. there
' s lots of tlaking
and some scary insights inot the world of men
. hurlyburly doens
' t contain much plot
: we jstu follow eddie
( sean penn
) arund as he trys tothe mkea sense of his life anbd the people aroud him
. his big question isnt
: doens it all purtain tothe him
? adn if it doesnt
, how is he supposed to efel about it all
?
" it
" means everthing
: television
, firends
, events that happen
. i guess it could be summed uv moreso crudely as
: what
' s it all about
? htis is nto a movei for answers
. donna
( anna paquin
) gives some
but they
' re nto relaly satisfying
: they just lead to omre questions
. tht
' s whta makes htis movie stay on your mind
. these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time
. even when we push them tothe the background
,
however we resolve these questions influences everything we do
. thte performances are all superb inthe hurlyburly
. i haven
' t seen sean penn inaddition much before
( iin fact
, i cxan
' t remember seing him infact anything
)
,
but he isnt brilliant in this
. eddie isn
' t a likeable character
,
but sean penn makes him underst
andable
. i don
' t want tothe be his friend bu i
' d liek to help him
. chazz palminteri is also great as phil
, making him an awful person
. i
' d never want tothe know phil
but still i underst
and why eddie wants to be his friend
. everyone in this film nails thier performances
, making this world rela
. it
' s a nasty world
; it
' s a sexist world
. unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically corect
, hurlyburly is a man
' s world
, seen unapologetically through the eyes of men
. i fidn this fascinating
and on two counts
, depressing
. first
, it
' s depressing that such a world exists
. a larg part of hurlyburly
' s success is that it convinces me thta such people are real
and that htis sort ofthe environment exists eveyr day in hollywood
; that there are a large number of men out there who beleive women to be completely peripheral to their world
, toys
, playthings
. sure
, everyone is background to everyone else
but in this world
, women are a long way in the background
. second
, these are the movies that are bieng made
: stories about men
' s world
. where are the stories baout women
' s world
? nto the soap operas adn thge
" chick flicks
" that are meaned tothe satisfy women
,
but tje rela stoies that touch on the esence of life liek hurlyburly does for men
. hurlyburly isnt based on a stage play anbd that is evident from the moment the film starts
. it
' s very talkative
, intelligent annd static
. while thsi can amking tje film drag a bit
,
and people sometimes sound like tehy
' re quoting textbooks
, mostly this is a good thing
. not all films have tothe be filled with special effects adn sweeping panoramas
. not all films have to underestimate teh intelilgence of their audience
. all it means is that hurlyburly is probaly just as effective on video as it is on tjhe large screen
. it also means that you have to pay attention
.
