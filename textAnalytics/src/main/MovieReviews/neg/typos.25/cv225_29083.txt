plot
: a rich guy who doesn
' t believe iin love
, orders a mial
- order bride for himself
. that very evening
, the couple is married anbd fall madly in love soon thereafter
.
but what
' s this
? one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be
? wow
.
.
. a sin
, indeed
. critique
: easily one of thte worst movies that i
' ve seen all year
. too long
, too boring
, too predictable annd too ridiculous fo anyone interested in watching a good movei
. what the hell weere they thinking wehn they made this thing
?
( it
' s no wonder taht hte film has beeen sitting onthe the racks for about a year
) this felt like a really bad tv movei ofthe tje week
, with some nudity stuffed in from time to time
, just to wake up the audience
. hvae you ever switched channels
and falled upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies
, one that yuo jsut couldn
' t help
but switch bcak tothe fomr timne to tyme
, just to make sure that it wasn
' t part of soem sick joke
? well
, tihs movie is exactly like that
, onyl it isn
' t a joke
, it isn
' t on tv adn you are asked to pay money to see it
!
! i say again
.
.
. wqat the shite were they thinking
? okay
, so where do i strat
? firt of all
, the trailer of this film gives away the movie
' s main plot twist
, tghe betrayal
. so fo the first half hour of thte film
, yuo
' re basically just sitting ther
, watching these two
" lovers
" go through the motions util teh
" betrayal
" occurs
. whoopee
, big suprize
. second of all
, angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part
. why
? well
, it
' s like this
: not for noe second do you ever believe tht she is nto a nasty backstabbing woman
! i mean
, it
' s like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson bieng psycho from tyhe start of the shineing
, well
, the same goes here
. every look in jolie
' s eyes screams
" pyscho
"
!
then ofthe course
, you haev thte case of thte
" patsy
" husban
, a man who just cant
' t seem to figure out anything in time
. i mean
.
.
. how boring is tath for the audience
? you
' re watching this guy scre up time after time after timne
,
and somehow
, we
' re supposed to efel sory or care baout this dude
. no
, thanks
!
and if we don
' t care baout him
, anbd we raelly don
' t care about her
( she
' s a beeyatch
and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film
)
, who the hell are we supposed to care baout inwhich thsi film
? well
, i
' ll tell yuo
. the only thing that i was worrying baout the whole way thru this picture was whether or not i
' d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled
. no suspense
, no chemestry between yhe leads
, no real love or passion
, noone sense ofthe surprise
, plenty of plot holes for everyone
and an extra moronic ending
. so why am i even giving this film a rating ofthe three points
? well
, it
' s actually pretty simple
. i liked the locations in thge movie
and the groovy score
,
but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots ofthe jolie
' s boobies
( taht
' s two points right ther
!
)
and another noe for antonio
' s ass
( hairless
, just forthe the record
)
. everything eles in this movei was pointless
, boring
and just plain stupid
. try imagining a soft
- porn movie
.
.
.
but without thte plot
! that
' s pretty much what ytou
' ve got here
. a low point in the careers of both stars
. oops
, i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue
.
.
. god oh mighty
.
.
. make it stop
!
! where
' s joblo coming from
? american psycho
