plot
: a rich guy who doesn ' t believe in lvoe
, orders a mail
- order bride for himself
. that vyer evening
, the couple is marryed
and fall madly in lvoe soon thereafter
.
but what ' s this
? oney ofthe them might not be hte person htey are pretending tothe be
? wow
.
.
. a sin
, indeed
. critique
: easily one ofthe teh worst movies taht i ' ve seen all year
. too long
, too boring
, too predictable
and too rediculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie
. waht thge hell were they thingking when they made this thing
?
( it ' s noone wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for baout a yearm
) tihs felt like a really bad tv movie of the week
, with some nudity stuffed in from timne to time
, just tothe wake up the audience
. have yuo ever switched channels
and fallen upon noe of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies
, one that you just couldn ' t halp
but switch back to from time to time
, just tothe amking sure thast it wasn ' t part ofthe some sick joke
? well
, this movei is exactly like that
, only it isn ' t a joke
, it isn ' t on tv
and you are asked to pay money to see it
!
! i say again
.
.
. what the shite were tehy thinking
? okay
, so where do i start
? first of all
, thte trailer of htis film gives awya the movie ' s main plot twist
, tyhe betrayal
. so for thge first half hour of hte film
, you ' re basically just sitting there
, watching theese two
" lovers
" go through the motions until the
" betrayal
" occurs
. whoopee
, big surprise
. second of all
, angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part
. why
? well
, it ' s liuke this
: not for one second dont you ever believe thgat she is nto a nasty backstabbing woman
! i mean
, it ' s like all ofthe those people who complained baout jack nicholson bieng pyscho fomr the start of the shineing
, well
, the same goes here
. eveyr look in jolie ' s eyes screams
" psycho
"
!
then of course
, you have the case of hte
" patsy
" husband
, a man who just cant ' t seem tothe figure out anytying in time
. i mean
.
.
. how boring isnt that for the audience
? you ' re watching this guy screw up timne after time after time
,
and somehow
, we ' re supposted to fiel sory or care about this dued
. no
, thanks
!
and if we don ' t care about him
,
and we really don ' t care about her
( she ' s a beeyatch
and as confused as we are baout her actual motivations in the film
)
, who the hell are we supposted tothe care about in this film
? well
, i ' ll tell you
. the onyl thing tath i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i ' d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled
. no suspense
, noone chemistry between thge leads
, noone rela love or passion
, noone sense of surprise
, plenty of plot holes for everyone
and an extra moronic ending
. so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points
? well
, it ' s actualy pretty simple
. i liked yhe locations in the movie
and the groovy score
,
but my primary reason for slipping threee notches onto this bedpost is fo the gratuitious shots of jolie ' s boobies
( thast ' s two points right there
!
)
and anyother one for antonio ' s ass
( hairless
, just fo the record
)
. everyting else in this movie was pointless
, boring
and just plain stupid
. try imagining a soft
- porn movei
.
.
.
but without the plot
! that ' s preety much whta yuo ' ve got here
. a low point inwhich the careers of both stars
. oops
, i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue
.
.
. god oh mighty
.
.
. make it stpo
!
! where ' s joblo comming from
? american psycho
