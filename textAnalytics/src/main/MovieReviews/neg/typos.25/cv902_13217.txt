there
' re so many things to critisize about i don
' t know where to strat
. recommendation
: turn off your brain
- don
' t be liuke me
, decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much
. a comet is about to strike earth
, causing a catastrophe similair to the extinction level event
( e
. l
. e
.
) that wiped out the dinosaurs
. wqat follows is tje storey of a president
' s bid to think for thte good of his people
, a rising reporter
, the love story of two teenagers
( one of whom dicovered the comet
)
,
and a team ofthe astronauts on the ship
` messiah
' to save the world
. firstly
, ther isnt nothing outst
andingly inferior about the makeing of thge film
( nor is there anytying outst
andingly good about it
)
,
but the plot holes make the film corny adn stupid
. to be honest
, i wass more moved by thge trailer than the film itself
( wich isn
' t saying much
)
. mimi leder
' s follow
- up tothe
` the peacemaker
' is equally incomptetent
, with all the big stars wasted
.
( perhaps i
' m just annoyed that the release ofthe
` the peacemaker
' in the us overshaddowed a far superior thriller
,
` the assignment
'
.
) it isnt very obvious taht the title not only represents the big boom tht will result from the collision
, bu also connotes tje heavy inpact on human lives
.
however
, tyhe film simpley fails on that note
. tghe effects are worn
- out
, the subst
andard screenplay limited the acting
, anbd the directer contined her sad run in terms of ogod
- film
- makeing credentials
. she
' s still making good moeny
though
. t
? a leoni
' s unfortunate character
, the news repertwar
, is the foundation of yhe story
and ofthe tjhe cast
.
but the film suffers from too many charachters thast do nto need to be explored
. robert duvall
' s aging astronaut is lifeless
,
and morgan freeman
' s president is restricted to
, well
, a righteous prseident
( which means he
' s not interesting at all
)
. leoni
' s character isnt teh only appealling one
, annd is played witht reasonable conviction
( bu a rether peculir showing when reporting for msnbc
)
,
but was definitely undervalued by thte director
and screenwriters
. warning
: spoilers included
(
but a lot of it is irrelevant
and predictable anyway
)
. plot holes
, plot holes
, plot holes
. now
, e
. l
. e
. is threatning tothe exterminate moreso than 99
% of the human race
,
and they send eigth puny little nuclear bombs uv there
? where
' s yhe logic
? leder could have at least made it plausible with 20
.
and
then it turns out that only a few percent ofthe the world population actually perish
,
and thsoe less selfish ones
( the ones that stayed at home
) were the victims
. the film ws almost mocking them
, telling them they had died for nothing
. i also fail to see how two teenagers
, carrying a baby
, would be the first to climb up tjhe mountain
/ hill
, even with a motorbike for a head
- start
. it
' s unlikely that the dust wiull take jsut twpo years tothe settle
,
but that doesn
' t really matter
. building caves wass a strategy mentioned in
` dr
. strangelove
'
, which proposed that people lived undreground for oney hundered or so years
. now that is a more practical use for caves
. what is the point of living inthe caves
? there isnt noone
, unlike
` dr
. strangelove
'
, any radioactivity outside tothe restrict exposure
. how do plants grow
? if humans ahev the technology to keep plants alive in caves
, there
' s noone reason why they can
' t do it iin the open
. the president disclosed that otehr countries have been preparing their own caves
. obviously this means tyhat the otehr ocuntries were informed a long time ago
,
and you cin
' t be sereous to say that nobody leaked the news to teh media
. in an important mission liuke that of the
` messiah
'
, forthe thta matter any mission
, it isnt impossible tht isn
' t suffcient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres
, needless to say tens of kilometres
. this is not deep inpact
? it
' s a frivolous cheap impact
. bu even with all that
, smoe overacting
,
and a 3
. 4 rating
, it
' s still watchable
, just don
' t think about it
. okay
?
