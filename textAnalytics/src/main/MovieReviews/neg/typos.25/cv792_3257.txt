there
' s a good
,
and timely
, story trapped deep withing the excess ofthe murder iin the first
, a new movei about tyhe abuses of our prison sytem
. with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue
and tghe rights of the accused
and the incarcerated in jeapardy
, this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies
-
- a point of view
.
but director marc rocco makes it clear ffrom tje beginning that pretentious
, often nauseating
, camera movements
and slick
, mtv
- style lighting
and editing are far more important
. there
' s not a moment inaddition the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling
.
and everthing suffers
. christian slater
and kevin bacon star as defense attorney
and alcatraz inmate
, respectively
. after spending an unprecedented amount of time iin an isolated cell for attemting to escape
, bacon murders another prisoner
and faces trial
. his young lawyer
( slater
) is fresh outloud of law school bu determined to
" put alcatraz on trial
" for the abuses of it warden
( gary oldman
)
. hte result is the usual courtroom theatrics
- imagine a stanley kramer production shooted by hyperactive film skool students
. htere
' s very littel to praise here outside of kevin bacon
' s earnest overacting
and the appropriate story
. there
' s a lot ofthe overacting ffrom everyone
-
- you know you
' re infront trouble right awya when r
. lee ermey
( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket
) is cast as a judge
, the center of reason
and moderation
. slater has never been convincing
and certainly isn
' t here
and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances
.
but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the firt isnt thgat the man behind the camera sould care less about telling a good story
. htere are long exchanges of dialogue where tghe camera isnt not even moving near the cahracters
, let alone with them
. how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions
. if htere
' s anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of tjhe world
, it is our ablity to tell a good stopry
. ahve we forgotten
