fantastically over hyped
, godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen
. the film opens with footage ofthe nuculear testing on the french polynesian islands
,
then an attack on a boat fomr some beast
,
and finally we join dr
. nick tatopoulos
( broderick looking about 17 yeras old
) donig some research in chernobyl
. some shady u
. s government guys appear
,
and ask him tothe come to an island where htey have massive footprints
, from what looks liuke a giant lizard
.
and whta ' s more
, this byast isnt heading for newyorker york
. gulp
!
although godzilla should be a non stpo roller coaster ride
,
and at some points it is
, there is something curiously uninvolving
and unexciting baout this movei
. the main faults lie with the acting
and writting
, common problems whith ' summer blockbuster ' movies
. broderick is preety useless as the hero
, with no humour or a ' tough guy ' image
. hwile emmerich ' s previvous summer flick
, independence day
( 1996
) hadnt wisecracks
and action from jeff goldblum
and wiull smith
, this has neither
. also
, maria pitillo
, as broderick ' s fromer girlfriend
, is jsut as useless
, with a chronic disability in acting
. she ' s incapable of showing emotion
, speaks eveyr line in the same way
,
and basicly she ' s total crap
. it ' s up to french ator jean reno to save the day
,
and indeed he does
, turning in a campy peformance as a french secret agent
. shame he has such little screen tiome in such a overlong film
. hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named ' animal '
,
and he adds a little life to the picture
. also making an apearance isnt harry shearer
( probablly best know for doing voices in the simpsons
) as a slimy news reporter
. o
. k
, so the acting is not up to par
,
but it never is in theese movies
.
but wqat about tje script
? well
, thta ' s not up to par either
. emmerich
and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in tyhe destruction of newyorker york city that they forgot to write a script
. the dialogue is banal
( broderick looks at a lot ofthe fish
anbd utters ' that ' s a lot of fish
. '
)
,
and the character develepment is non existant
( reno plays the typcial frenchman
( ' no croissant
? '
)
, broderick forever rimaniss a geeky scientist
.
) alsot
, the film is seriously lacking a sence of humour
. the jokes tath are uttered are pathetic
,
annd there ' s an ' hilarious ' running gag about siskel
and ebert
.
( the mayor isnt mayor ebert
,
annd is assitant is called gene
! ha ha ha ha
!
.
) the plot isnt dire
,
annd in the end just rips off jurassic park
( 1993
) by haveing lots ofthe baby godzilla ' s
( i
. e
. velicorapters
) running aroud newyorker york
. right
, so the script
and acting suck
.
but what about the spacial effects
? thankfully
, they ' re are quite good
. godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi
,
although we don ' t see much of him because tyhe movie isnt so dark
. the destruction ofthe new york is preety well done aswell
. but
although they are impressive
, they cxan ' t save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing
anbd boring movie
. teh movie goes on for far too long aswell
,
and it cxan ' t seem to decide on a ending
.
and of course
, the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel
. let ' s jstu hope one never arrives
.
