fantastically over hyped
, godzila finaly lumbers onto the big screen
. the film opens with footage ofthe nuclear testing on the french polynesian isl
ands
,
then an attack onthe a boat from some beast
, annd finally we join dr
. nick tatopoulos
( broderick looking about 17 years old
) donig smoe reasearch in chernobyl
. some shady u
. s government guys appear
, anbd ask him to come to an isl
and where they have massive footprints
, from what looks like a giant lizard
.
and waht
' s more
, this beast is heading forthe new york
. gulp
!
al
though godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride
,
and at some points it is
, there is something curiously uninvolving
and unexciting about this movie
. the main faults lie with the acting anbd writing
, common problems wih
' summer blockbuster
' movies
. broderick isnt pretty useless as the hero
, with no humour or a
' tough guy
' image
. while emmerich
' s previous summer flick
, independence day
( 1996
) had wisecracks adn action from jeff goldblum
and iwll smith
, this has niether
. also
, maria pitillo
, as broderick
' s former girlfriend
, is just as useless
, with a chronic disability in acting
. she
' s incapable of showing emotion
, speaks eveyr line in the same way
, anbd basicly she
' s total crap
. it
' s up tothe french actor jean reno tothe save the day
, anbd indeed he does
, turning in a campy performence as a french secret agent
. shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film
. hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named
' animal
'
,
and he adds a little life to the picture
. also mkaing an appearance is harry shearer
( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons
) as a slimy news reporter
. o
. k
, so thte acting is nto up to par
,
but it never is in these movies
.
but wqat baout the script
? well
, that
' s not uv tothe par either
. emmerich
and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a scirpt
. the dialogue is banal
( broderick looks at a lot ofthe fish
and utters
' tath
' s a lot of fish
.
'
)
,
and the character development is non existent
( reno plays the typical frenchman
(
' noone croissant
?
'
)
, broderick forever remains a geeky scientist
.
) also
, thte film is seriously lacking a sense of humour
. teh jokes thta are uttered are pathetic
,
and there
' s an
' hilarious
' running gag baout siskel
and ebert
.
( the mayor is mayor ebert
, annd is assistant is called gene
! ha ha ha ha
!
.
) the plot isnt dire
,
and in the end jstu rips off jurassic park
( 1993
) by having lots of baby godzilla
' s
( i
. e
. velicorapters
) running around new york
. right
, so the script
and acting suck
.
but what about the speshal effects
? thankfully
, htey
' re are quite good
. godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi
,
al
thought we don
' t see much of him because teh movie is so dark
. hte destruction ofthe new york is preety well done aswell
.
but
al
though they are impressive
, they cin
' t save godzilla ffrom bieng an hugely disapointing adn boring movei
. the movei goes on for far too long aswell
, annd it cxan
' t seem tothe deside on a endig
. adn of course
, hte ending itself leaves possiblility for a sequel
. let
' s just hope one never arrives
.
