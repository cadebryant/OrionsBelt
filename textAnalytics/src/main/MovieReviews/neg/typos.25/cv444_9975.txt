the makers of spawn hve creaeted something allmost as vacuous as thsi summer
' s otehr comic book adaption
, batman
and robin
. both films make thge misteek ofthe adapting for the screen not onyl the look of their graphic counterparts
,
but also their monosyllabic dialogue
and empty
- headed charater motivations
. in panel
- sized morsels
, implausible plots
and
" rambo
"
- esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork
, bu on thirty foot silver screens
, it
' s much omre difficult tothe dismiss the shallowness behind the preety pictures
. spawn isnt ostensibly about an assasins named simmons
( white
) who is framed by a corporate baddie
( played without irony by sheen
)
,
then set on fire
and left for dead
.
though the movie skimps on the next few plot points
, here
' s what i could determine
: said assassin hten becomes the leader ofthe satan
' s army
, under the tutelage ofthe a flatulating midget named clown
( leguizamo
, grating as always
)
. he is renamed
, for reasons unbeknownst
, spawn
,
and granted a really kool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon
.
but wehn spawn spies on a birthday party for his child
, he realizes that he can
' t be the evil superdemon he
' s expected to be
, anbd he sets about avenging his untimely death
. typical ofthe summer blockbusters
, spawn is an effects
- laden ninty minute rock video
. while the visions of hell are laughably crude
( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man
)
, spawn
' s prehensile outfit
and teh action sequences are truly something to behold
.
but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion
( spawn longs forthe his wife
,
but they don
' t have a single scene together before simmons
' death
!
)
, conflict
( who will triumph is nto anybody
' s guess
)
,
and believability
( not that i expected it
)
. so many questions are left unanswered
,
and i
' m sure they won
' t be addressed in the inevitable sequal
. hwile last year
' s the crow
: city of angels sufferred similar problems with its narrative
( which was lazy
and somewhat incoherent
)
, it hadnt atomsphere to spare
and genuine moments of hypnotic power
. spawn isnt an inspite
- your
- face
, screaming banshee of a film
; theese guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid
,
but tehy haven
' t the faintest idea how to make a movei
.
