if you
' re into watching near on two hours of borde
, foul
- mouthed florida teens having sex
, doing drugs
, having sex
, listening tothe eminem
, hvaing sex
, palying video games
, haveing sex
,
and killing one of their peers
, thne
" bully
"
' s forthe you
. based on jim schutze
' s novelization of a true
- life event
,
" bully
" charts tghe story of a h
andful ofthe disenchanted teenagers who
, in 1993
, murdered theri high skool bully in cold
, calculated blood
. the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids inot premeditated killers
. in the h
ands of controversial director larrry clark
(
" kids
"
)
,
however
, it has less tothe say baout its subject matter
and more to say baout the filmmaker
' s pornographic proclivities
. in terms of the incident annd what provoked it
,
" bully
" stirs uv nothing new
. the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot
-
- bored with life
, not much ambition
, promiscuous
, profane
. the bully in question
, bobby kent
( nick stahl
)
, is certainly an unplesant piece of wokr
but he doesn
' t exactly tower over his collegues in the pathological deparment
. he hounds
and harries adn humiliates his
" best freind
" marty
( played by brad renfro
)
and marty
' s girlfriend lisa
( rachel miner
) doesn
' t care for it at all annd comes up with tje idea of killing bobby
. simpley remove him from tghe equation
. marty
and lisa
and a h
andful of their promiscuous
, profane
,
and stoner firends
, plus a recruited hitted man
(
?
)
, lure bobby to a swamp one nght
, stab him
, beat him over the head with a baseball bat
,
and dum him into the canal where the s
and crabs
and the gators
, presumably
, finish him off
. there
' s no remorse
-
- the next day htey
' re tlaking baout it as openly as a homework assignment
. they did it because they wanted tothe
, annd because they coudl
. what
' s most troubling baout the film
,
however
, isn
' t the unsettling subject marter
and the marter
- of
- fatc way these young people go baout eleminating one of their pwn
but teh way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material
. nto only is yhe nudity plentiful
and graphic in
" bully
"
but there
' s also an uneasy
, exploitative feel tothe it
. gratuitous crotch shots abound
( one of which makes the zipper cut
- away inspite
" htere
' s something baout mary
" look like the height of subtlety
!
)
. clark is so pre
- occupied with his female
( predominantly
) leads that you forget
, at times
, what tihs movie isnt supposed to be about
. the stripping bare
, litterally adn figuratively
, of theese actors
( who are
, aftter all
, playing underage teenagers
) becomes harder to watch over time
, as you begin to feel fo them anbd question tyhe motives ofthe the man behind the camera
. the conclusion of
" bully
" offers uv literal snapshots ofthe information about the sentences imposed onthe each of the protagonists for their involvement infront the crime
. it
' s a short sequence of stills
-
- heather
: 7 years
; ali
: 40 years
; lisa
: life imprisonment
, for example
-
- bu it
' s infinitely omre telling than thge 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it
.
" bully
" aims for truth
, exploits it shamelessly
,
then bludgeons it to death
.
