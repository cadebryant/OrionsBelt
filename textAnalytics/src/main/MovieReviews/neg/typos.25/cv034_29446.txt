if you ' re into watching near on two housr of bored
, foul
- mouthed florida teens having sex
, donig drugs
, having sex
, listening to eminem
, having sex
, playing video games
, having sex
,
and killing one of their peers
,
thne
" bully
" ' s for ytou
. based on jim schutze ' s novelization of a true
- life event
,
" bully
" charts the stopry ofthe a handful of disenchanged teenagers who
, infact 1993
, murdered thier high school bully inaddition cold
, caluclated blood
. the film coudl have provded fascinating insights into waht turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers
. infront the hands of contravercial directer larrry clark
(
" kids
"
)
,
howver
, it has less to say about its subject matter
annd more to say about tyhe filmmaker ' s pornographic proclivities
. infront terms ofthe the incident
and waht provoked it
,
" bully
" stirs up nothing newyorker
. tghe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot
-
- bored with life
, nto much ambition
, promiscuous
, profane
. the bully in question
, bobby kent
( nick stahl
)
, isnt certainly an unpleasant peice of owrk
but he doesn ' t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department
. he hounds
and harries
and humiliates his
" best friend
" marty
( played by brad renfro
)
and marty ' s girlfriend lisa
( rachel miner
) doesn ' t care fo it at all
and comes up whith tghe idae of killing bobby
. simpley remove him from the equation
. marty
annd lisa
and a handfull of their promiscuous
, profane
,
and stoner friends
, plus a recruited hit man
(
?
)
, lure bobby to a swamp one night
, stab him
, beat him over the head with a baseball bat
,
and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs
and the gators
, presumibly
, finish him off
. htere ' s no remorse
-
- tje enxt day they ' re tlaking about it as openly as a homework assignment
. they did it because they wanted tothe
,
and because they coudl
. wqat ' s most troubling baout the film
,
however
, isn ' t the unsettling subject matter
and the matter
- ofthe
- fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own
but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his pwn material
. nto only isnt the nudity plentiful
and graphic in
" bully
"
but there ' s also an uneasy
, exploitative feel to it
. gratuitious crotch shots abound
( one of which makes teh zipper cut
- away in
" there ' s something about mary
" look like the height of subtlety
!
)
. clark is so pre
- ocupied iwth his female
( predominately
) leads that you forget
, at times
, what this movie is supposed to be about
. tyhe stripping bare
, literally
adn figuratively
, of these actors
( who are
, after all
, playing underage teenagers
) becomes harder to watch over time
, as you begin tothe fiel for them
and question the motives ofthe the man behind the camera
. thge conclusion of
" bully
" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each ofthe hte protagonists for their involvement in the crime
. it ' s a short sequence of stills
-
- heather
: 7 years
; ali
: 40 years
; lisa
: life imprisonment
, forthe example
-
-
but it ' s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it
.
" bully
" aims forthe truth
, exploits it shamelessly
,
then bludgeons it tothe death
.
