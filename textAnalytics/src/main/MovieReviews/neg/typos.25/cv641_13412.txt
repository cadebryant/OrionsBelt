. smae old attitude
. don
' t foreget to recommend a film
, read the journal
, or send me some of that nasty hate mail
.
) starring bruce willis
, billy bob thornton
, liv tyler
, ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh
and j
. j
. abrams directed by michael bay it rocks
- actually
, lots of rocks fli at us or from us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points in the film
. tehy seem like dangerous rocks because htey kind of twirl through the air instead ofthe just propelling forward
,
and whn they l
and
- once iin a hwile
, when we need a break from the space sequences
- tehy cause damage enough tothe destroy the chrysler buliding adn thge liuke
.
( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after htey occur
.
) they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon
, a steroid user
' s answer to deep impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller comissioned by the white house
and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oil driller
? they require somene experienced with deep
- core mining tothe plant a nuclear misile into said asteroid
.
( in one unintentionally
(
?
) hilarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deepo
- core driller they built based on his pwn blueprints
; it isnt poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost eveyr aspect ofthe it
. we trust nasa to build spoace shuttles that can l
and onthe twirling asteroids
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, inlcuding a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a black guy
, a wiseass
, adn the man who is sleeping with his daughter
( affleck
)
. once they reach space
, we experience sequence affter sequence ofthe something gogin wrong
- perhaps the fact thta they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space hasnt something to do with it
; i cannot count the number of times they almsot fail the mission on all my fingers anbd toes
. whther or not they save the day
, i iwll not reveal
. nor will you care
. i wiull say this
: you know ytou
' re in trouble wehn deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion adn scope
. willis has barely a chance to come alive
; ditto for affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved fo the third ect
, in a lastr minute
-
and futile
- attempt to inject warmth into the material
. steve buscemi
' s charactor
- the wiseass
- isnt exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he
' s called
, is sarcastic
and foolish
, so they tape him to a chair
, where he spends most ofthe the film
. so why doed they bring him up htere tothe begin withthe
? rather
, why write him into tjhe film
?
- give his almost
- witty one
- liners to serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes anbd demonstrates psychotic tendencies
: at oney point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing often
and causing signficiant damage tothe his oil rig
. i
' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit forthe space travel
, at least iin my world where the sky is blue
. liv tyler isnt pretty
and humourless
, as alwasy
; suspiciously
, four ofthe her father
' s b
and
' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace thge soundtrack
. director michael bay lays the visual
and soudn effects on thick
, liek ketchup
, eventually drowning the movie on
- screen
.
( the middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault onthe the averege primate
' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in this movei
, a crew member inevitably yells outloud
" we lost
( insert dead person
' s last name here
)
!
" i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oel
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live one
,
and close
- ups of the corpses
' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance
, as their skin was often covered in fake blood
. armageddon is nto as terrable movie as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes within its equally ludicrous framework
. it has a vivid soundmix
.
but at alomst two
-
and
- a
- half huors
, i could not belivee how littel actually happened over yhe course of the story
. the love story has been played uv in the ads
, perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout
- erase all
thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex
and replace them wtih obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing uv hwile ben affleck dicks arund in a moon
- crawler
. remeber a little film called jaws
? inaddition thsi film
, three independent
- minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit ofthe a deadly shark
. htey didn
' t much like each other at first
; eventually
, tehy started to respect noe another
. one of jaws
' great scenes involved the would
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
and telling stories
. this is the sort of male
- bonding foreign tothe bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix annd expect we
' ll care about them onthe the grounds that thte world is baout to end
. not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances
- i
' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another befoer
" acation
" was called
. a male friend who loved teh film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch ofthe men who don
' t bare their souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts liuke heroism adn a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. tothe thsi
, i iwll respond tath the boys in armagedon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn
' t build a birdhouse
.
and if i get no respect for disliking a movei with all tghe synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movie written by a team ofthe body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i
' ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life
