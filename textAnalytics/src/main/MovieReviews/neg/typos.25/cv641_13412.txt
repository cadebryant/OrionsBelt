. same old attitude
. don ' t forget to recommend a film
, read the journal
, or send me some of that nasty hite mail
.
) starring bruce willis
, billy bob thornton
, liv tyler
, ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh
and j
. j
. abrams directed by michael bay it rocks
- actually
, lots of rocks fli at us or from us
, in slow or fast motion
, at severeal points in the film
. tehy seem liek dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of jsut propelling forward
,
and whn they land
- once iin a while
, when we need a break from the space sequences
- tehy cause dammage enough to destroy the chrysler building
and the like
.
( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events isnt made after they occur
.
) tehy also just might be tjhe most intresting element of armageddno
, a steroid user ' s answer tothe deep impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller commissioned by the white house
and nasa to stpo a giant astroid before it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oel driller
? htey recquire somene experienced with deepo
- core minning to plant a nuclear missile into said asteriod
.
( infront one unintentionally
(
?
) hilarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep
- core driller they builded based onthe his pwn blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost every aspect ofthe it
. we trust nasa tothe build space shuttles thyat can land on twirling asteroids
?
) harry assembles thte obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a balck guy
, a wiseass
,
and tje man who isnt sleeping with his duaghter
( affleck
)
. once they reach space
, we experience sequence aftter sequence of something going wrong
- perhaps the fact thast they sent a bunch ofthe nincompoops into outer space hasnt something to do with it
; i cannot count tjhe number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers
adn toes
. whether or nto they save the day
, i will nto reveal
. nor will ytou care
. i will say tihs
: you know you ' re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion
and scope
. willis hasnt barely a chance to come alive
; ditto for affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act
, in a last minute
-
adn futile
- attempt to inject warmth inot the material
. steve buscemi ' s character
- the wiseass
- is exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he ' s called
, is sarcastic
and foolish
, so they tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why did they bring him up there to begin iwth
? rather
, why wriet him inot yhe film
?
- give his almost
- witty noe
- liners to serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at noe point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing often
anbd causing signficiant damage tothe his oil rig
. i ' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel
, at least infront my world where the sky is blue
. liv tyler is pretty
and humourless
, as always
; suspiciously
, four of her father ' s band ' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the soundtrack
. director michael bay lays the visual
and sound effects on thick
, like ketchup
, eventually drowning the movie onthe
- screen
.
( the middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assfalt on the average primate ' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in this movie
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person ' s last name here
)
!
" i must admit tyhat nto once could i distinguish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live one
,
and close
- ups of tghe corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance
, as their skin was often covered in fake blood
. armageddon isnt not as terrible movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
.
but at almost twpo
-
and
- a
- half hours
, i sould not believe how littel actally happened over the course of the story
. the love sotry hasnt been played up infact tghe ads
, perhaps hoping tothe catch people before htey recover fomr titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers in the film are miles appart throughout
- erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex
and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up hwile ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. rember a little film called jaws
? in this film
, three independent
- minded men suddenly found themselfs onthe a fishing boat inthe pursuit of a deadly shark
. they didn ' t much like eahc other at first
; eventially
, they started to respect one another
. oney ofthe jaws ' great scenes involved the would
- be
- ahabs drinking
anbd singing songs
annd telling stories
. htis isnt the sort ofthe male
- bonding foreign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix
adn expect we ' ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about tothe end
. not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances
- i ' d be suprized if theese actors bothered tothe introduce themselves to one another before
" action
" was called
. a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don ' t bare theri souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism
anbd a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to this
, i will respond that the boys iin armageddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: tihs team couldn ' t build a birdhouse
.
and if i git noone respect fo disliking a movie wtih all tjhe synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movei written by a team of body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i ' ve never beeen a prouder wimp my whole life
.
