" flubber
" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation
,
and hysterically enough both were ditri
buted by disney
. it
' s the kind of film that may be slightly intertaining to tiny kids
, bu anyone eles will feel left out as it
' s boring
, slow
,
and incredibly lifeless
. what could be a film iwth cinematic magic is instade dead in the water
,
and it
' s a shame because it could hve been a great film
. hypothetically
, i mean
.
" flubber
,
" as you probably know
, is a remake of the disney classic i never saw
,
" the absent minded professor
,
" where a
, well
, absent minded proffesor played by fred mcmurray creaeted an erratic substace known as
" flubber
,
" you know
, flying rubber
? the new one keeps tghe basic plot
, bu appears to have added a lot esle
, like more absent
- mindedness on the part of the proffessor
, some moreso villains
,
and several
" show
- stopping
" moments
, like a big rumba with the flubber
,
and some more elaborite setups
, none which realy make it any better
,
but instead make it worse
. the basic plot revolves around a college profesor
, philip brainerd
( robin williams
)
, who creates lots
and lots of inventions
,
but isnt sadly absent minded
. in fact
, he
' s forgotten his wedding to the college
' s president
, sara jean reynolds
( indie actress marcia gay harden
)
, two times before he forgets it again at tje beginning
. doesn
' t thsi warrant some kind of mental treatment
? anyway
, on his wedding day
( the third one
)
, he invents thge flubber
, wich nto only bounces off ofthe everything liek a super ball on speed
, bu can also chanage shape like the aliens in water form inaddition
" the abyss
.
" philip believes that thsi invention
, once fully realized
, will save his college
, which isnt in threat ofthe being shut down by a millionaire tycoon
/ villin
, chester hoenicker
( raymond j
. barry
)
, whic isnt ironically enought thge same college his brat son
( iwll wheaton
-
thought he was dead
) goes tothe
. through a plot twist
, hoenicker
' s goons
, named smith
and wesson
( ha ha
- what a great sense of humer this film has
) who are plyed by clancy brown
and ted levine
( both who needed the pay check
)
, dicover it the hard way
,
and try to steal for hoenicker
, who wants it jstu
' cause he
' s evil enought
. a sub
- plot involves philip
' s attempts tothe win back sara
, who
' s angry at him
(
and with good reason
)
,
but who is being seduced by who is basically philip
' s belloq
, wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
, playing tghe hysterically suave
- yot
- unsuave asswhole once again
)
.
and in another subplot
, philip
' s day
- timer robot
, weebo
( voiced by the one
-
and
- onyl jodi benson
)
, falls in love with him
. yuckity
- yuck
. what
' s most pathetic about tihs film is how dull it is
. you don
' t need to be a cynical coleeg student tothe be able to see right through this film
, which is another inspite a long line ofthe cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney
, who have essentially become hte puff daddy of the film industry
, half
- assedly re
- mixing classics
( or non
- classics
) forthe distri
bution to the general publich
, who sadly eats it all up
. ealier in
' 97
, they released
" jungle 2 jungle
,
" an adaptions of a really awful french film
,
" un indien dans la ville
,
" hwihc
, yeah
, improved over teh original
,
but not by much
. disney
' s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now
, only creatively
. in the rush to ship outloud a film for distri
bution
, disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called
" magic
.
" such scenes as dancing flubber
, a flying car
, a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber
,
and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze
, delight
, or even cause people to laugh
. i sat there the entire film stone faced
, chuckling perhaps twice
,
and shaking my head at all the bad jokes
. who could realyl laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom annd starts teaching chemistry
? didn
' t think so
. it doesn
' t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable
. philip is not a lovable absent minded professory
, just a really dumb man being played by robin williams
. williams is a briliant comic actor
.
.
. okay
, a brilliant actor in genaral
, bu here he
' s given very little to do
but occasioanlly get hyper over something
, adn other times act sad
. those times
, he
' s not bad
. bu what are we supposed to think of a man who
' s forgotten his wedding thrice
? maybe it was funny annd
/ or respectable in the 60s
.
.
. i like disney
,
and i usually enjoy thier films
, not onyl animated
but live acation
, adn their recent films
( save for
" hercules
,
" which ws good
,
but not great
) have been worse than lackluster
, they
' ve been pathetic
.
" jungle 2 jungle
" is probably the worst film i saw last year
.
" flubber
"
' s probably second
. what do tehy need to do
? perhaps create something new
. get writers who can rwite something taht
' s universally entertaining
. films like
" the parent trap
" annd
" mary poppins
" are films that are live action
( or in the latter case a mix ofthe both
)
, bu even i can still watch them because they
' re not only written tothe be magical to childen
,
but to be fun to adults
. what
' s omre torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you
and annoys ytou at eveyr turn
?
and my god
, couldn
' t they have done something alse witht edie mcclurg
?
