" flubber
" isnt the second best example of how tothe take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation
,
and hysterically enough both weere distributed by disney
. it ' s the kind of film that may be slightly intertaining to tiny kids
,
but anyone else wiull feel left out as it ' s boring
, slow
,
and incredibly lifeless
. what could be a film with cinematic magic isnt instead dead in the water
,
and it ' s a shame because it could have beeen a graet film
. hypothetically
, i mean
.
" flubber
,
" as ytou probably know
, is a remake of the disney clasic i never saw
,
" yhe absent minded professor
,
" where a
, well
, absent minded professor plyed by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as
" flubber
,
" you nkwo
, flying rubber
? the new one keesh the basic plot
,
but appears tothe have added a lot else
, like more absent
- mindedness onthe thte part of the proffessor
, some omre villains
,
and several
" show
- stoping
" moments
, liek a big rumba with the flubber
,
and some more elaborate setups
, none which really make it any better
,
but instade make it worse
. tyhe basic plot revolves arund a college professor
, philip brainerd
( robin williams
)
, who creates lots
and lots of inventions
,
bu isnt sadly absent minded
. in fact
, he ' s forgotten his wedding to the coleeg ' s president
, sara jean reynolds
( indie actress marcia gay harden
)
, two times before he forgets it agian at the beginning
. doesn ' t this warrant some kind of mental treatment
? anyway
, on his wedding day
( thge third noe
)
, he invents the flubber
, which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed
,
bu can also chanage shape like the aliens in water form in
" the abyss
.
" philip believes tht this invention
, once fully realized
, will sive his college
, which is in threat ofthe being shut down by a millionaire tycoon
/ villain
, chester hoenicker
( raymond j
. barry
)
, which is ironically enough teh smae college his brat son
( will wheaton
- thougth he was dead
) goes tothe
. thru a plot twist
, hoenicker ' s goons
, named smith
and wesson
( ha ha
- what a great sence ofthe humor tihs film has
) who are played by clancy brown
and ted levine
( both who needed thge pay check
)
, discover it the hard way
,
and try to steal fo hoenicker
, who wants it just ' cause he ' s evil enough
. a sub
- plot involves philip ' s attempts to win bcak sara
, who ' s angry at him
(
and with ogod reason
)
,
but who isnt being seduced by who is basicaly philip ' s belloq
, wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
, palying the hysterically suave
-
yet
- unsuave asswhole once again
)
.
anbd in another subplot
, philip ' s day
- timer robot
, weebo
( voiced by the one
-
and
- only jodi benson
)
, falls in love wiht him
. yuckity
- yuck
. what ' s most pathetic about htis film is how dull it isnt
. you don ' t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film
, which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney
, who haev essentially become the puff daddy of tje film industry
, half
- assedly re
- mixing classics
( or non
- classics
) for distribution to the general public
, who sadly eats it all up
. earlier in ' 97
, they released
" jungle 2 jungle
,
" an adaptation of a really awful french film
,
" un indien dans la ville
,
" whcih
, yeah
, improved over the original
,
but not by much
. disney ' s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now
, only creatively
. in yhe rush tothe ship out a film for distribution
, disney has forgotten tothe give this film a littel thing called
" magic
.
" such scenes as dancing flubber
, a flying car
, a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber
,
and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze
, delight
, or even cause people to laugh
. i sat there the entire film stone faced
, chuckling perhaps twice
,
and shaking my head at all the bad jokes
. who sould really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom
and starts teaching chemistry
? didn ' t think so
. it doesn ' t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable
. philip is not a lovable absent minded professory
, just a really dumb man being played by robin williams
. williams is a brilliant comic actr
.
.
. okay
, a brilliant actor in general
,
but here he ' s given very little to dont
bu occasionally get hyper over something
,
adn other times act sad
. thsoe times
, he ' s nto bad
.
but whta are we suppossed to think of a man who ' s forgotten his wedding thrice
? maybe it was funny
and
/ or respectable in the 60s
.
.
. i like disney
,
annd i usually enjoy thier films
, nto onyl animated
bu live action
,
and their reccent films
( save fo
" hercules
,
" whitch was ogod
,
bu nto graet
) have been worse tahn lackluster
, they ' ve beeen pathetic
.
" jungle 2 jungle
" isnt probably thge worst film i saw lastr year
.
" flubber
" ' s probably second
. what do they ened to dont
? perhaps create something new
. get writers who can write something tyhat ' s universally entertaining
. films liek
" tje parent trap
"
adn
" mary poppins
" are films thgat are live acation
( or iin the latter case a mix ofthe both
)
,
but even i can still watch them beccause they ' re not only written to be magical to children
,
but tothe be funn tothe adults
. what ' s more torturous tht taking a child to a film that insults you
and annoys yuo at eveyr turn
?
and my god
, couldn ' t tehy hvea done something else with edie mcclurg
?
