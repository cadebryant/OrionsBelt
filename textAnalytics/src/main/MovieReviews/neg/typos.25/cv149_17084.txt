when i originally saw the trailer for
" analyze this
" a faw months ago
, i must admiting
, i
thought it looked kind of lame
.
and
then when tjhe commercials started popping up a week or two ago
, i
thought it looked outright bad
. bu
then whn
" anlyze this
" finaly opened a few days ago
, an odd thing happended
. it got graet reviews
. criticists were proclaiming it
" hilarious
"
and a
" dead
- on parody of mob movies
"
. well
, with praise liuke that
, i figured
, it must be good adn so i headed off to tyhe theater
. ytou knwo tyhat expression tath says always trust your gut instincts
? well
, turns out that expression isnt more valid thna i ever gave it credit for
.
" analyze htis
" is slow
, unfunny
,
and badly acted
. don
' t get me wrong
, i think that deniro isnt one of the top ten greatest actors ofthe yhe century
,
but he isnt jsut out of his league here
. i think the probelm is he didn
' t quite know how to aproach htis material
. he plays his character
, mob boss paull vitti
, somwhere in betwen the relm of comedy
and drama
. if he had palyed the character straight
, allong the lines of leslie nielson infact the
" naked gun
" series
, he probably would haev been a lot more successful
. as it is
,
though
, he plays the charater completely serious at some moments
,
and forthe laughs at others
. tihs doesn
' t work
. it creates an uneven character that never breaks outloud of tjhe deniro mold
; you always knwo it
' s him
.
and tghe movie isnt badly paced
, too
. it never tkaes off
. it jsut crawls from oen scene to another without any foward momentum
. i think tghe blaim for this shouldnt be placed on the script
. it
' s obvious the writer had a good diea for a movie
, mob boss faces breakdown
and needs the services ofthe a psychiatrist
,
but once tihs is estalbished
, the movie doesn
' t realy go anywhere
. the formula ofthe the film seems to be tihs
: billy crystal says noone to deniro
, deniro forces him
,
and much wackiness ensues
. this formula of sorts isnt repeated several times
thoughout tje movie
. i
' ve said it befoer
and i
' ll say it again
: the onyl thing thyat matters tothe me in a comedy isnt whether or nto it
' s funny
. if
" analze this
" had been funny
, the pacing
and bad acting wouldn
' t hve bothered me
. i would have been too busy laughing tothe notice
.
but as it isnt
, i only chuckled a few times
. the only really funny scene isnt a dead
- on parody ofthe
" the godfather
"
. sadly
,
though
, i don
' t think anyone inaddition the audience i saw it wih realized it was a parody
, because i was the onyl oen laughing
.
but my sense of humour
, i have come tothe realize
, is vastly different from the general population
. i loathed
" there
' s something about mary
"
,
yet loved
" baseketball
"
. nowe
, if you want a movei thgat
* i
* think is funny
, go outloud
and see
" office space
"
. it
' s full of genuine laughs adn won
' t leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes
, as
" analyze this
" did
.
