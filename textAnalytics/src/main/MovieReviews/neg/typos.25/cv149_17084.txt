when i originally saw the trailer for
" analyze thsi
" a faw months ago
, i must admit
, i thought it looked kind ofthe lame
.
anbd
then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago
, i thought it looked outright bad
.
but
hten when
" anlayze this
" finally opened a few days ago
, an odd thing happenned
. it got grat reviews
. critics were proclaming it
" hilarious
"
annd a
" dead
- onthe parody ofthe mob movies
"
. well
, with praise like that
, i figured
, it must be good
and so i headed off to the theater
. you know that expression that says allways trust your gut instincts
? well
, turns out that expression is more valid tahn i ever gave it credit for
.
" analyez this
" is slow
, unfunny
,
adn badly acted
. don ' t get me wrong
, i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors ofthe the century
,
but he is just out of his league here
. i think the problem is he didn ' t qtuie know how to approach this material
. he plays his character
, mob boss paull vitti
, somewhere in between tghe realm of comedy
and drama
. if he had played the charater straight
, along the lines ofthe leslie nielson in hte
" naked gun
" series
, he probablly would have been a lot more successfull
. as it is
,
though
, he plays the character completely sereous at some moments
,
and for laughs at others
. this doesn ' t work
. it creates an uneven character that never breaks outloud ofthe the deniro mold
; ytou always know it ' s him
.
and the movie is badly pased
, too
. it never takes off
. it jsut crawls from one scene to anyother wihtout any forward momentum
. i think teh blame for this shoudl be placed on the script
. it ' s obvious thge writer had a good diea for a movei
, mob boss faces breakdown
annd needs thge services of a psychiatrist
,
but once this isnt established
, the movie doesn ' t realyl go anywhere
. hte forumla of the film seems tothe be this
: billy crystal says noone to deniro
, deniro forces him
,
and much wackiness ensues
. this formula of sorts is repeated severeal times throughout the movei
. i ' ve said it before
and i ' ll say it again
: the only thign thgat matters to me inthe a comedy is whether or not it ' s funny
. if
" analyze htis
" hadnt been funny
, teh pacing
and bad acting wouldn ' t have bothered me
. i would ahve been too busy laughing tothe notice
.
but as it isnt
, i only chuckled a few times
. the only realy funny scene is a dead
- on parody of
" the godfather
"
. sadly
,
though
, i don ' t think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody
, beccause i was the only one laughing
.
but my sense of humour
, i hvea come to realize
, is vastly different from the genaral population
. i loathed
" there ' s something about mary
"
,
yet loved
" baseketball
"
. now
, if you want a movie that
* i
* think is funny
, go out
annd see
" office spoace
"
. it ' s full of genuine laughs
and won ' t leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes
, as
" analyze this
" did
.
