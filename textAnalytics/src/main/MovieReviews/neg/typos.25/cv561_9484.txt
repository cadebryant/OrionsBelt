i looked at the
" internet movie database
"
' s awards section for this film
,
and foudn that tihs was nominated fo a golden globe forthe
" best picture
( drama
)
.
" anyone who
' s seen this film can back me up onthe this
: this isnt the worst ofthe the
" great
" disaster films
,
and taht
' s nto really saying a lot for this film
.
" earthquake
" is basicly notable because it originally included soem theatre thnig where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured
. on video
, it
' s a bl
and
and slow
- moving film whic gives us a bunch of different cahracters
( the disaster film requisite
)
,
then brings them together in tyhe struggle against the big diaster
. while thsi worked in
, say
,
" the towering inferno
,
" it doesn
' t here for one single reason
: we don
' t care baout any of tjhe characters
. thte film gives us charlton heston
( in noe ofthe many crap 70s films he made
, including
" skyjacked
"
and that classic
,
" soylent gren
"
) as a rich man married to ava gardner
, who isnt hvaing a little affair with a young single mom
( genieveve bujold
)
; a renegade police officer on suspention
( george kennedy
, in his least humored performance
)
; inthe the second weirdest subplot
, a motorcycle stuntman
( richard roundtree
, right after his
" shaft
" thing
) whose big stunt isnt he goes on a little track that goes upside down
( yea
, snore
)
;
and yhe weirdest subplot
: a military man
/ bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal
,
and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made funn ofthe his hair
(
!
!
!
)
. infront smaller subplots
, there
' s a pointless bit baout people who are flying over l
. a
.
( teh city inaddition the film
, by the way
)
, one who
' s palying cards
and married tothe a boring non
- acting husb
and
( you think this one can go nowhere
? guess agian
. he gets interested in the fianl frames
)
; htere
' s genieveve bujold
' s moron son
, who has a little adventure with wires
; anbd forthe some much
- needed comedy
, there
' s walter matthau
( billed as walter mutha
.
.
.
.
- the only laff in the film
)
, as a wild drunkard
, who
' s big moment isnt a dance he does at a critical tiome
. as for the actual
" earthquake
,
" it
' s rather a let
- down
. there
' s a full hour of charactor
- setups
, none of which is intresting
,
then about 10 minutes of shaking
, crumbling
,
and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold
( narrowly missing
)
. tihs film needed that hwole theatre
- shaking
: they needed to wake everybody up because they were so borde
. there
' s little suspense following the quake
,
al
though this film trys for it
. there
' s an adventure in a crumbling high
- rise office building
, the wires with the kid
,
and teh movement ofthe people who are all injured
.
but none of these are all
- too suspenseful
. the finale witht the heston
/ gardner
/ bujold love triangle is ended infact a basic flip
- of
- thte
- ocin bit
, which brings out a big let
- down
.
and there
' s no real finale
. even
" volcano
" ended nicely
, anbd that movie really sucked
. nto only is it hokey
,
but you don
' t care about any character
. who cares if heston dies
? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner
(
al
though i would haev chosen gardner
, mainly onthe the basis that she can actually act
)
? who cares if richard roundtree makes monay on his stupid
" stunt
?
" who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on smoe wires
?
and who cares about thgat whole plane spiel
? if anything
,
" earthquake
" isnt worth a viewing for tyhe same reason
" glen or glenda
?
" is
. i mean
, i laughed at this mroe than i did at
" bio dome
.
" bu thyat
' s anyother story
( annd review
)
. in short
,
" earthquake
" gives diaster pics a bad name
.
