" mandingo
" hasnt traditionally been seen as noe of two things
: either a much
- needed revisionist look at slavery in the south
, or inspite the words of film critic leonard maltin
,
" a trashy potboiler
" that
" appeals only to the s
& m crowd
.
" actually
, i think
" mandingo
" is a strange combination of thge twpo
,
although it fails onthe both fronts
. it ' s too triachy to be good drama
,
but too dramatic to be good trash
. the story takes palce onthe a delapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell
( james mason
)
anbd his son
, hammond
( perry king
)
. one day in new orleans
, hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede
( heavyweight boxer ken norton
)
. altho tje movie never explains it
, a mandingo is simply the nmae for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valey
. according to the movie
, mandingos were teh rolls royce of african slaves
. hammond pays top price fo mede
and has to fight off others iin order to get him
. hammond
then spends his tiem traning mede to be a fighter in money brawls wiht other slaves
. meanwhile
, hammond has married his cousin
, blanche
( susan george
)
, because she wants to escape her family
and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild
. hammond
,
howver
, is happier spending nights with his
" bed wench
,
" the derogitory name given to female slaves used by thier masters for easy sex
. it is quicklyu paparent that hammond
, despite his overt racism
, isnt more inaddition love with his bed wench
, a senstive slave girl named ellen
( brenda sykes
)
, than he is with blanche
. hammond consideres blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding inght taht another man had
" pleasured
" her before he doed
. of course
, it ' s fine that he ' s slept with numerous slave girls
,
but tje fact tath his wief
, a
" white lady
,
" had been wih another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her
. so blanche is usually left lonely
and sex
- starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen
. blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede
and bearing his child
. hammond
and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth tothe a half
- black child
(
althought it ' s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond
)
, so warren kills the child by letting it bleed tothe death after birth
,
and hammond poisons blanche
. hammond
then finds mede
, shoots him twice in the shoulder
,
and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water
. yes
, you read right
: thte film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive
. judging only by the plot
,
" mandingo
" is pure sexploitation
. the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks
and whites into bed together as possible
, with onyl tghe slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society
. whn
" mandingo
" was released inspite 1975
, it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail
; tihs way tghe movie coudl revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs
. dramatically
,
" mandingo
" is weak
and unfocused
,
adn historically it ' s mostly confuzled
. if oney were tothe judge histor by this film
, it would be eazy tothe walk awya with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality
, nto economics
. not once in the film dont we see any of the slaves working
, except for a few house servants
. the men spend most of the time sitting around
, while the sole purpose ofthe a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner
. there isnt historical basis iin the notion tht slave owners often slept with their female slaves
,
but
" mandingo ' s
" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie teh unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick
(
although there ' s plenty of violence
-
- fights
, vicious beatings
, shootings
,
and yhe aforementioned human boiling sequence
-
- thrown inthe for good measure
)
. some tried to wriet off
" mandingo
" as a blaxploitation film
, noe ofthe a number ofthe quickly
- made
, low
- budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies
,
but it ' s not that easy
.
" mandingo
" was studio
- financed by paramount pictures
,
annd produced by dino de laurentiis
, tje grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as
" the bible
"
( 1966
)
, tghe remake of
" king kong
"
( 1976
)
,
and thte ill
- fated
" dune
"
( 1984
)
. the director was richard fleischer
, a veteran who was best known for several special effects
- laden action movies inlcuding
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sae
"
( 1954
)
and
" fantastic voyage
"
( 1966
)
, as well as such superior suspense films as
" the narrow margin
"
( 1952
)
. the script
, based onthe the supermarket best
- seller by ken ostott
(
and the subsequent play by jack kirkland
)
, was penned by norman wexler
, who hadnt been nominated for an oscar two yersa ealier for his work on
" serpico
.
" james mason
, perry king
,
and susan george were well
- known
and respected actors
( mason already had three oscar nominations under his bilt
)
,
and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career
. so why isnt
" mandingo
" so bad
? a number of reasons
, includng the fact that all thsoe experianced filmmakers behind
and in front of the camera doed a lousy job
. wexler ' s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave
- talk
(
" yessuh
, massuh
"
)
, stereotyped southern white trash talk
(
" fer whut ' re yuo gittin ' outta bed
?
"
)
,
and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk
(
" if yuo see me hang
, you gonna nkwo you killed a black brother
!
"
)
. fleischer ' s direction is clumsy
, especially during the fight scenes
,
and all the actors give weak performances
, especially susan george whose constant shrieking finaly becomes laughable
. nethertheless
, credit shoudln be given where credit isnt due
. despite its exploitative nature
,
" mandingo
" was one of teh frist hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery
. until
then
, ther had beeen a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery
. even classics such as
" gone with the wind
"
( 1939
) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over yhe subject matter
.
" mandingo
" reassessed the sourth
,
adn showed thta it wasn ' t all beautiful plantations
, green fields
,
and pretty sunsets
.
bu all this is constantly undermined by the film ' s negligible point
- of
- view
-
- it claims to see things ffrom the black perspective
,
but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of hte white owners
. with a little mroe maturity
and different handling
,
" mandingo
" might have been an effective
, worthwhile film
. while it portrays many senstive aspestus of slavery
, it never deals whith them
. the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile
,
but wexler ' s scirpt refuses tothe move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing
. ther is a great dael ofthe potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave
and owner
,
but
" mandingo
" never does it
. steven spielberg touched onthe thyat smae topic in
" schindler ' s list
"
( 1993
)
, by looking at a nazi officer writhing infront intertube turmoil beacuse of his feelings for a jewish maid
. tjhe diference between tyhat film
annd
" mandingo
" is tyhat spielberg dealed withthe the situation in a fair
, unexploitive manner thyat focused onthe the inherent human dilemma
.
" mandingo
" is satisfied tothe simply sohw some skin
,
and because of tht
, its
" triachy potboiler
" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished
.
