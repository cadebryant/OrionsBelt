" m
andingo
" has traditionally been seen as one of twpo things
: either a much
- needed revisionist look at slavery in the south
, or infact thge words of film critic leonard maltin
,
" a trashy potboiler
" that
" appeals only tothe hte s
& m crowd
.
" actually
, i think
" m
andingo
" is a strange combination of tjhe twpo
,
al
though it fails on both fronts
. it
' s too trashy to be good drama
, bu too dramatic to be good trash
. the story tkaes palce onthe a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell
( james mason
)
and his son
, hammond
( perry king
)
. noe day in new orleans
, hammond comes across a slave trader selling a m
andingo named mede
( heavyweight boxer ken norton
)
.
al
though tjhe movei never explains it
, a m
andingo is simply tje name for africans who come from the region ofthe the upper niger river valey
. according to the movie
, m
andingos were tje rolls royce of african slaves
. hammond pays top price for mede anbd has tothe fight off others inaddition order to git him
. hammond
then spends his time traning mede to be a fighter in money brawls wih other slaves
. meanwhile
, hammond has married his cousin
, blanche
( susan george
)
, becouse she wants to escape her famaly annd he is under pressure from his father to produce a gr
andchild
. hammond
,
however
, is happier spending nights with his
" bed wench
,
" the derogitory nmae given to female slaves utilisied by thier masters for easy sex
. it is quickly apparent that hammond
, despite his overt racism
, is moreso inspite love with his bed wench
, a sensitive slave girl named ellen
( brenda sykes
)
, than he is with blanche
. hammond consideres blanche tainted goods becouse he finds out on their wedding night tht anyother man hadnt
" pleasured
" her befor he did
. of course
, it
' s fine that he
' s slept wiht numerous slave girls
,
but the fact that his wife
, a
" white lady
,
" had been with anyother man out of wedlock destroys his capacity tothe care for her
. so blanche is usually left lonely
and sex
- starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen
. blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede
and bearing his child
. hammond
and his father cannot st
and the idea that blanche has given birth to a half
- black child
(
al
though it
' s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond
)
, so warren kills hte child by letting it bleed to death after birth
,
and hammond poisons blanche
. hammond thne finds mede
, shoots him twice infact the shoulder
,
and pushes him into a giant cauldron ofthe boiling water
. yes
, ytou read right
: thte film ends iwth hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive
. judging only by yhe plot
,
" m
andingo
" is pure sexploitation
. tje main purpose ofthe the film seems tothe be getting as many blacks
and whites into bed together as possible
, with only the slightest commentary onthe what that would mean in 19th century southern society
. whn
" m
andingo
" was released in 1975
, it was still a bited of a shocker tothe see miscegenation onthe screen in such a graphic detail
; this way the movei could revise cinematic history while attracting larg audiences ofthe curious voyeurs
. dramatically
,
" m
andingo
" is weak
and unfocused
,
and historically it
' s mostly confused
. if one were tothe judge history by this film
, it would be easy to walk awya iwth the notion that the entire system ofthe american slavery was based on sexuality
, nto economics
. not once in the film dont we see any ofthe hte slaves working
, except for a faw house servants
. tghe men spend most ofthe tyhe time sitting around
, while hte sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex forthe tghe owner
. ther is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept witht their female slaves
,
but
" m
andingo
' s
" overwhelming empahsis on this aspect ofthe slavery gives the movie the unpleasant tast of a cheap sex flick
(
al
though there
' s plenty of violence
-
- fights
, vicious beatings
, shootings
,
and the aforementioned human boiling sequence
-
- thrown in for ogod measure
)
. some tried to write off
" m
andingo
" as a blaxploitation film
, one of a number of quickly
- made
, low
- budget films appealing to black sensibilities in hte early seventies
,
but it
' s nto that eazy
.
" m
andingo
" was studio
- financed by paramount picturesk
, annd produced by dino de laurentiis
, the gr
andiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as
" the bible
"
( 1966
)
, the remake of
" king kong
"
( 1976
)
,
and the ill
- fated
" dune
"
( 1984
)
. tyhe director ws richard fleischer
, a veteren who was best known for several special effects
- laden action movies including
" 20
, 000 leagues under tjhe sea
"
( 1954
) adn
" fantastic voyage
"
( 1966
)
, as well as such superior suspense films as
" the narrow margin
"
( 1952
)
. thge script
, based onthe the supermarket best
- seller by ken ostott
( anbd the subsequent play by jack kirkl
and
)
, ws penned by norman wexler
, who had been nominated forthe an oscar two yersa ealier for his wrok on
" serpico
.
" james mason
, perry king
,
and susan george weere well
- known
and respected actors
( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt
)
,
and ken norton appeared to have a promising film carreer
. so why is
" m
andingo
" so bad
? a number of reasons
, includng the fact thast all those experienced filmmakers behind adn in front of the camera did a lousy job
. wexler
' s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave
- talk
(
" yessuh
, massuh
"
)
, stereotyped southern white trash talk
(
" fer whut
' re you gittin
' outta bed
?
"
)
,
and stereotyped contamporary militant black talk
(
" if ytou see me hang
, yuo gonna know yuo killed a black brother
!
"
)
. fleischer
' s direction is clumsy
, especially during the fight scenes
,
and all tje actors give weak performances
, especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable
. nevertheless
, credit should be given where credit is due
. dispite its exploitative nature
,
" m
andingo
" was one of hte first hollywood movies tothe take an alternative look at slavery
. until
then
, ther had beeen a kind ofthe underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery
. even classics such as
" gone with tyhe wind
"
( 1939
) can be seen as inherantly racist by its glossing over the subject matter
.
" m
andingo
" reassessed yhe south
,
and showed that it wasn
' t all beautiful plantations
, green fields
, anbd pretty sunsets
.
but all this is constantly undermined by the film
' s neglible point
- ofthe
- veiw
-
- it claims tothe see things from tjhe balck perspective
, bu thge entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners
. wih a littel moreso maturity
and different h
andling
,
" m
andingo
" might have been an effective
, worthwhile film
. while it portrays many senstive aspects of slavery
, it never deals withthe them
. tghe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile
,
but wexler
' s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing
. htere is a grat deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship bewteen slave
and owner
, bu
" m
andingo
" never does it
. steven spielberg touched on that same topic in
" schindler
' s list
"
( 1993
)
, by looking at a nazi officer writhing in intertube turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid
. the diference between that film
and
" m
andingo
" is taht spielberg dealt with the situation inthe a fair
, unexploitive manner that focused on the inherrent human dilemma
.
" m
andingo
" is satisfied tothe simpley show some skin
,
and because of that
, its
" trashy potboiler
" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have acomplished
.
