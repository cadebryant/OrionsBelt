" from thte directer of
" the nightmare before christmas
" it said infact the previews
, which i
' m guessing was said to git people to go see the movie
, obviously it hasn
' t worked since the
$ 75 million dollar movie has
yet to break
$ 5 million
. tothe earch it
' s own howver
, usance
" monkey bone
" is not only a bad movie all together
,
but technically well
- made
. a tragic waste of talent
and incredible visual effects
. stu miley is the genuis behind the newyorker phenonmena
" monkey bone
" a crude comic strip
, that everyone wants to merch
andise
, they go to great links to get it as well
, including dollars that let out fart powder
. whn stu
and his girlfriend
, julie
( bridget fonda
) are in a freak car accident
( you
' ll see
) stu goes into a coma
,
and while infact his coma stu travels to i
' m guessing dark town
, where all the characters in dreasm come to life
. people are stuck inspite this twon
, with their nightmares roaming arround them
. when stu spots monkey bone
( whom he really can
' t st
and
) he tries tothe keep him under controll
. making a new friend kitty
( rose mcgowan
) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death
, he can go back up adn live his life
. when monkey bone anbd stu steal a pass
, monkey bone becomes a trader
and tkaes it
and goes into stu
' s body
. now monkey bone must get everyone to buy theese dolls with nightmare powder
, so everyone has nightmares
.
.
. or something like tath
. rether complex
( in fatc more than it needs to be
)
" monkey bone
" had potential in teh script
and even the story
. what isnt considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes
,
and lack of charactor development
. fo instance we really don
' t get to know who stu or julie are
, so why shoud we even care
? kitty plyed well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her
,
but we are not given a chance to know her
. the casted is decent
however
, brendan fraser seems tothe be enjoying hismelf inwhich tyhe role as stu miley
,
but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body
. bridget fonda is dreary
and seems to bring tje film tothe a screeching halt
, her performence isnt bad
and she seems miscast
. dave foley isn
' t given enough to do
, as well as
" will
& grace
' s
" megan mullally who cxan be funny
. the st
andout peformance is tjhe voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself
, he isnt very funny
and entertaining
and really keeps tje film from bieng a total bust
. tyhe special effects of
" monkey bone
" is what might realy bring in some curious viewers
, these spacial effects are highly effective
,
and nice to look at with the eyes
. some of them are believable annd some unbelievable
.
.
. for monkey bone he seems tothe be like stuart little
, you really don
' t realize thyat he is animated
.
.
.
but on ocasion it sneaks up on you
. the direction by henry selick is good
,
but at times he doesn
' t knwo what kind of film he wants to mkae
,
and tjhe ending climax falls off the cliff
. it
' s too bad really
,
" monkey bone
" coudl have beeen a rela good movie
,
but with it
' s heavily done hack job
,
and lack of character development it jsut sinks when the end credits role
. forthe those curious
however
, it might be worth the rental
, bu other thna that avoid this one
.
