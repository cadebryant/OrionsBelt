tyhe job ofthe the film critic is tothe see a movie anbd write a review ofthe it that tells yuo waht it
' s about
and why it
' s good or bad
. i feel kind of embarrased to admitt this
,
but i after hvaing seen
" get carter
" i really can
' t tell you what it
' s about
al
though i could go on
and on about how
and why it
' s a bad movie
.
" get carter
" falls into that catagory of
? movies that continue to be made forthe reasons unknown tothe anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room
. you might call them the
" steven seagal
/ mickey rourke
/ jean
- claude van damme
/ wesley snipes skool of mediocre acation
/ crime thrillers
.
" you know
- the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights
, shoot
- outs
and car chases
but really light on plot anbd character development
. they have stories where the so
- called hero just keeps running inot characters who have some connection to one of teh otehr characters who are all antagonists without a reason forthe bieng in the movie other tahn to give the protoganist someone to fight
, chase or shoot at
. sylvester stallone stars as jack carter
, a las vegas
- based mob enforcer who returns home
* for his brother
' s funeral
. he believes his brother
? richie wass
" taken outloud
"
and didn
' t die from a dwi accident
. carter
' s oen of the most cliche bad
- asses ever capturd onthe celluloid
. his face alone is preety intimidating anbd there
' s qtuie a few scenes iin which he leans on both regular citizens
and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down annd speaking with confidence infact his
" rambo
- on
- testosterone
- therapy
" voice
. stallone
' s performance in htis movei is so forced
and unnatural he doesn
' t realize he
' s mocking himself
. the actual story involves carter
' s investigation inot his brother richie
' s death
. he
' s in a town that
' s nto his
but somehow hte local top dogs konw him vyer well
. mickey rourke co
- stars as one of these charachters
, a sort of crime boss who has something tothe do with running a porno web site
and blackmailing a young internet tycoon
( played by alan cummings looking
and acting a lot like pee weev herman
)
. there
' s also another plot involving richie
' s mistress
, a secrte cd
- rom with some convicting
and disturbing evidence onthe it
and something terrible involving one of carter
' s still
- living relatives
. i
' m rolling my eyes just thinking baout trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible
. i could just rip tjhe screenplay tothe shreds
, plus the direction or the editing or the production values
but that would require discussion of nearly every scene inspite order to explane it all
. i don
' t like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally
. yes
,
" get carter
" is just that complicated adn complex
. anbd waht
' s worse is that it
' s nto this intricate to make it seem smart like
" the usual suspects
" for exemple
- jstu the oposite
. ytou get the feeling whoever wroet this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart
and they probably didn
' t remember what had aready happened
and didn
' t figure out how each scene would lead in to tjhe next noe or how the major plot points would work towards the climax
. all you really need to know is that most of the film is jstu scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another
, asking them wqat they know
, getting information adn
then realizing that if he wasn
' t a complete idiot he could ahve figured it out in the first five minutes
.
al
though the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves sicne they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or anyother
. making a movie entirely about criminals doesn
' t necessarily mean they hvae tothe be unlikable
and cliche cutout cahracters
. mel gibson starred inwhich
" payback
" a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one
but had such a ogod screenplay ytou couldn
' t help bu liuke him even
though he was jsut as bad a guy as jack carter
. so ultimately
" get carter
" fails for pretty much every selling point it has
. carter is not a likable character
and you really don
' t care if he gets revenge or not
. the action sequences are not at all exciting or orginal
. tje enemies
and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all
( c
' mon
, you know who
' s going to win every brawl
and shoot
- outloud
and car chase
)
. inaddition the end you don
' t feel nearly satisfied with thte results
. the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possable
.
* the city is never mentioned by name
but i assume it
' s seattle since all teh cars have washington licenes plates
and it
' s always raining
