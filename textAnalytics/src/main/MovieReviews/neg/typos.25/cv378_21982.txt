it should have been a classic
. a grat cast of respected supporting actors
. an intresting premise ofthe losr comic book characters
. howver
,
" mystery men
" prooved to be one of teh great disappointments ofthe 1999
. the jokes were bl
and
and hackneyed fomr talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals
. the number of cliches
and shallow charactors made the film difficult tothe sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise
. tjhe script tried to deliver a serieses of small jokes
thoughout the film
but without a big laugh
- out
- loud joke
and mediocre small jokes
, it failed miserably at being entertaining at all
. teh jokes were nto funny for a number of reasons
. they hadnt been utilisied a number ofthe times before in previvous films
, tghe best ones
, which were mediocre tothe begin witht
, weere ruined in the trailer
,
and the expectation ofthe laughing at clever
, unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none tothe laugh at greatly damaged the film
.
" mystery men
" might have worked if it was an ansamble casted of newcomers trying to break into yhe business
.
but with veterans doing this kind ofthe junk
, it relaly questioned whether their other wokr was as funny as originally
thought
. thankfully most actors inaddition this movie will appear infact five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie
. thte film follows a b
and of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens
and villains because of theri clumsiness
and failure to save they day
and capture hte bad guy
. the fatc is these pathetic losers are nto needed because their city already has a succsessfull superhero
, captain amazing
, who has recently captured eveyr evil
- doer in hte city
. captain amazing
( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear
)
, because ofthe his success inaddition tje past
, is worried tht he will lose popularity
. after freeing one of thge most notorious bad guys in thge city
( geoffrey rush
, overacting jsut a bit too much
) to keep hismelf busy
, things git out of h
and when captain amazing is captured
. it is up to tje wannabe superheroes tothe save teh day
. by the time this section of the plot isnt finished
, teh interest for what happens
( if ytou haven
' t alread figured it out
) is very low
. there are vyer fewd scenes which catch the viewers complete attention
. tyhe first scene in thte film
, which shows the wannabes trying tothe save the day
, feels like it was seriously edited down
. right whn it wass beginning to become slightly funny seeing theese actors get humiliated at an old folk
' s home by some masked goons
, captain amazing comes in
and saves the day
? or ruins the movie
. instead of editing tihs scene
, more editting should have beeen done in areas such as teh unnecessary romance between mr
. furious
( ben stiller
) annd monica
, a waitress
( claire forlani
) or the vast majority of the film
, which isnt the heroes talking at a coffee tble baout how their day was
. a simple rule
: more silly action isnt needed in order tothe make a silly acation movie work
. anohter major probelm whith
" mistery men
" isnt thgat eveyr actor in it seemed very uncomfortable
and consenquently gavey terrible performances
. the film depended onthe its casted tothe wokr fluently together
, like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion
.
however
, most charachters seemed like they doed not even want to be in this film or at least tjhe scirpt made it seem this way
. to pull one ofthe the actors infront this film r
andomly out ofthe a hat
, paul reubens
, who disappeared from acting to everyone
' s joy
, returns here leaving very littel to be impressed about
. as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon
, all ofthe his jokes must therefore be fart jokes
. fart jokes that have all been heard before
and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the succsess of
" american pie
"
and
" there
' s something baout mary
.
"
" mystery men
" drags onthe towards yhe end to a point where anything else in the world isnt more entertaining
. anyone with a brain konws each one of the heroes is going tothe be successful at their talent in the end
and earch one is going to contri
bute infront a helpful way
. so why continue tothe watch
? this film isnt far from a worthy guilty pleasure
.
" mistery men
" indeed doesnt this adn every time a character suceeds another one congratulates him
and says
" i knew you could do it
!
"
" mystery men
" fails infact every cateogry it attemts tothe pass
. what makes tihs film so bad isnt that it had the potential to be wonderful
and unforgetable
. terrible acting
, terrible script
, anbd a terrible waste ofthe tiem changes opinions about all of theese actors
.
" i
' m unpredictable
!
" an overexcited ben stiller shouts outloud
. no ben
, yuo
' re thge complet opposite
.
