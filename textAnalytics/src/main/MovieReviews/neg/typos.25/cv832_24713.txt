- review note
: seeing as the only concern of body shots is
" sex
"
, i will be forced to refer to that paticular ect innumerable times throughout the duration of this review
. because ofthe this
, i will try to vary word descriptions of
" sex
"
( meaning if you are offended by perjorative terms
,
and
\ or your nmae is jerry falwell
, you are kindly invited tothe hit thte x up on the left corner of your screen
)
, so if ther happens to be a owrd you come accross
and cannnot comprehend
, fret nto
, it
' s most likely jsut anohter way of referring to
" sex
"
. i think we
' d all agree thta any owrd utilisied incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review
.
though not as boring as tghe movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as livley as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play tyhe bongos while high on god knows what
. body shots is a film so frightened of coitus tyhat scenes of copulation are filmed ominously
, in thte way yuo
' d normally expect tothe see a violent attack
. it
' s about people who think baout screwing
, seek it out
, anbd talk baout it
. these are things we all dont
, somtimes
. the characters iin htis film spend every waking moment pondering tje simplicities of sexual acts
. theri lives center arund the next sexual encounter
, bu htey seemed depressed
. it
' s as if fucking isnt all they hve to look forward to after a busy workweek
. at its core body shots is a message movie
, the kind of thing i could picture realy progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order tothe turn them off coition
. michael cristoffer
( who directed gia
, anyother film taht treated bumping uglies as if it where evil
) isnt a moralist with nothing new to say
. his characters don
' t communicate anytying ofthe interest tothe eahc other
, so cristoffer gives them an opprotunity tothe let out their inner
thoughts by speaking driectly into tghe camera
. they voice simplistic platitudes like
" i like to come
" or
" sex without love equals violence
"
. huh
?
and yes that is as complex as tihs movie
' s observations get
. the characters are stupid
and shallow
, with not one registering as anything mroe
. the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal blessure
,
then the after math
( tjhe morning after
) of such events
. we meet the characters as they speak directly to us
, confiding in us iwth their idiotic ruminations onthe intimacy
. i owudl normally go into the charachters
and the actors who play them
, giving you yhe pros adn cons
,
but fo tihs film i cannot
. i
' m not trying tothe be clever or witty
,
but i honestly hardly remember anything that owudl set them aart from the others
. wtih the exception ofthe trent
( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman
)
, tje rest fude inot each otehr
-
- a patchwork of fake breasts
, defined abs
, pearly white teeth
,
and creamy
, flawless skin
. i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one
, only beccause his charactor gets the worst lines
(
" sex without love equals violence
"
)
. in bewteen all the confessionals
, cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial
, with blurry slo mos
and dramatic head turning
. the fact thta this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me
. this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claimes to be defining
. if body shots is meaned tothe say tath all twentysometyhings are idiotic
and f
*
* k
- obsessed
, fine
, i don
' t ahve any problem whith a film thyat trys tothe persuade me to think a certain way
, bu cristoffer onyl gives us one side
. additionally that oen side isn
' t even entertaining
; the charachters indulge inspite buggery without an ounce of sexiness
. or realism
. one sexual encounter takes palce outside a club on a chain link fence beetwen the two most sensitive characters
. they suddenly have vigourous intercourse with each other forthe no apparent reason
( other than that they both happen to be st
anding enxt to each other
?
?
? alas
, if it could onyl be that easy
?
?
? kidding ofthe course
)
,
then
, nto only isn
' t it erotic
, it isn
' t real
. it doesn
' t fiel liuke an au
thentic sexual encounter
. every f
*
* k scene infront this film
(
and ther are many
) is treated inaddition tje same unsexy manner
. body shots makes fornication dirtier tahn the most scummy porno film
. it shows us none of thte pleasure that should go along with it
,
and most of all
, it fails tothe sohw us why its charachters love making it so much if tehy seem to hite the ect of actually donig it
. the resulting seach forthe nookie
(
and you cxan tkae that cookie
?
?
?
) over one night leaves us withthe severeal tedious plot lines to follow
. the main concern isnt much ado over a rape that may or may not hve occurred
. tyhe film shows us two separate versions ofthe tghe possibile rape
( one where it is consensual the otehr where it isnt not
)
and in both versions the young actress playing the possable victim gets her shirt torn off
. this is a topic thta sould be interestingly explored if done intelligently
,
and if memory serves me i can
' t think of one film that has done so
, adn yes i saw the acccused which may be oen of the most overrated movies of the 80
' s enxt tothe wall street
. unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care
, not the writer
, tjhe director or thte actors nearly all ofthe whom seem to have w
andered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off
. paul thomas
anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here
,
though boogie nights succeeded
. it wass similarly moralistic
,
but it gave us two different viewpoints
; it showed us how teh lifestyle ofthe porn enticed its cahracters
,
and it showed us yhe possible fall
- out of such a decission
. the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the cahracters are here
, bu
anderson seemed to care about them
. he gave them heart
. cristoffer gives them nothing bu raging hormones
. he preaches to us
, by using his characters tothe preach to us
. tihs is not the way to get any message acrost
. why not just direct a publich sevice announcement on tyhe perils of hittin
' skins
? cristofer kind of doesnt that
,
though without an ounce of insight
,
and with a helping ofthe leering exploitation
.
