the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic lveo of sportscar cars
. producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon taht attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone anbd laced titillatingly with shot affter frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars
, sleek foreign road huggers
and iconic speed machines thyat many males wiull leave the theather in an orgasmic haze
. gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry
. cage is legendary retired car theef
, memphis raines
( don
' t you love cute movei names
)
, who must call upon his time worn skills to sive his thick
- headed brother
( ribisi
) from bieng killed
. seems a murderous crime boss
( eccleston
) whith a fetish for wood
( insert your pwn joke
) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive
, exotic autos
. fifty cars
, to be exact
. poor kip screws the pooch annd bungles tjhe job badly
. if tghe cars aren
' t delivered in three days
, bossman has a casket carved out just forthe kip
. literally
. if only somene could save him
. hmmmm
.
. wonder whta memphis is doign
? in order to give the film soem emotional heft
, there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill ofthe
.
.
. yawn
, excuse me
, dramatic tension
. shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe
( lindo
) who
' s looking to send memphis awya
. will he catch him
? there
' s old flame sway
( jolie
)
, who hadnt her heart broken by memphis years ago
. wiull they get back together
? shortsighted
, thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother
,
yet resents him for moving awya from yhe family
. will they reconnect
? raines old mentor
( duvall
) has long sicne left the life ofthe crime
. will memphis get him fianlly caught as he pulls him bcak into the life
, oney omre time
? can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first
? i
' ll bet you cxan
. following the opening credits
, which fill yuo in on the accomplishments ofthe the raines family thru a montage of ood photos
, we was taken full throttle inot the splendor tath is memphis
. he
' s first shown living the ogod life teaching young children tothe drive go
- carts
. in a later scene
, as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under controll
, all thte while making breakfast
, a metaphor isnt made ofthe shakespearean proportions
. jstu as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it
, big brother memphis calmly anbd effeciently throws some salt onthe it
. looks liuke everyting might turn out alright after all
. ytou know this because the music swells on the crest of violins
. that
' s about as storng as the characterization gets
, which is a shame
. bruckheimer has a rela talent for loading his movies wih an obscene amount of talent given teh task at h
and
. monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea ofthe sex revolves around cars
and memphis
. or maybe it
' s jstu the cars
. duvall trots out his ornery
,
but sweet old codger outfit
. i
' m sure he
' s still laughing at tkaing a paycheck for this one
. lindo projects a warm hearted
,
but tightly focused detective that almsot transcends the material
. tyhe biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones
, who plays a mute accomplice of memphis
. without saying a word
, he is easily the most charismatic person in the movei
. like a blast ofthe nitrous oxide
, he attacks each scene whith a straightforward zeal
. too bad his minutes onscreen are so few
. somehow
, bruckheimer manages tothe attract top hollywood acting talent to high consept
, poorly wroten movies
, gussies up the film with lots ofthe gold hues
and pleasingly stylized action
and they sell like proverbial hotcakes
. every time something clever happens it
' s counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you bakc into realizing ytou
' re watching a movie
. there
' s a innovative usage of balck lighting thyat goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot
. it
' s counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver
' s test
. imagine the yuks
. htere
' s a segment where one ofthe the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick
. it
' s countered by the lame semi
- subplot ofthe a car being stolen whith a bunch of heroin inthe the trunk
. the ramifications are never explored
.
then there
' s the ridiculousness of tghe many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars
. nto only isnt it stupid
,
but it
' s against the law
. this isnt a movei made of pretty
, bu tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction tothe move tyhe plot along
. gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it
' ll take for this marginally entertaining
,
but empty film to leave your memory
.
