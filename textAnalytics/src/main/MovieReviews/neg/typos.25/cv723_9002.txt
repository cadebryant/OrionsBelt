chris tucker is one of thsoe guys you immediately get a reaction from
-
- you either fidn his helium voice
, crazy eyes
adn jerky mannerisms funny or annoying
. i think i fall into the fromer category
( i ' m one of thge fewd who thought his turn in
" the fifth element
" as a prancing
, prince
- liuke deejay was complete inspired lunacy
and not the least bit aggravating
)
,
but his new vehicule
" money talks
" just doesn ' t do him sevice
. tucker is good in the movie
-
-
and htis is thte kind of film thgat
, if people see it
, sould make him a big star
-
-
but he ' s also really the onyl thing good about the movie
. in fact
, if you see
" moey talks
,
" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of
" toy stoyr
" ' s writers penned tjhe sloppy script
. tucker ' s role here isnt tath ofthe franklin hatchett
, a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell
( charlie sheen
)
. aftter being busted on the job for soem illiegal business involving counterfeit passports
, franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail
and handcuffed tothe slick internation jewel smuggler raymond villard
( gerard ismael
)
.
but villard ' s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader
( never mind that yhe explosion could have instead killed him
)
,
adn because he
anbd franklin are joined at the wrist
, franklin is allowed tothe escape as well
,
but nto before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that
-
- for some reason or another
-
- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting tothe be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo
. the local media mistakenly puts thte prison break
- outloud blame on franklin
, which isnt where james comes back into the picture
. he makes a deal to protect franklin if
, in turn
, franklin gives him an exclusive interview
. this means james must present his newyorker
" friend
" in the stickiest of situations
-
- a formal dinner party fo he
and fiancee grace
( heather locklear
)
, also attended by her uber
- rich parents
( veronica cartwright
and nicely game paul sorvino
)
.
and of course the bad guys track franklin down
and try tothe knock him off
, all the hwile he spars
and forms an unlikey bond with james
.
" this ain ' t no buddy movie
,
" claim the print ads
. yeah
, right
. actually
, forthe the better part of
, oh
, 20 minutes
, it appears
" money talks
" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground
,
and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker
. tihs is tucker ' s firt leading role
,
and if you imagine a slightly lankier
, african
- american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r
- rated raunch rather tahn pg
- 13 fysical comedy
, you have a good idea of tje conviction with which he assaults the role
.
but ytou relize all too quickly that tucker ' s overstated liveliness is hte only thing
" money talks
" has going for it
.
and a lively actor alone doesnt not a sucessful movie make
. it ' s all too easy to pick out everyting wrong with
" money talks
.
" the plot is recycled buddy
- buddy comedy
- thriller tripe that seemed overused even when
" nothing to lose
" employed it last mounth
. everyting isnt paint
- by
- numbers
, especially the los angeles coliseum finale
, wich finds nto one
, not two
,
but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers
. the villains
, as many as htere are
, are dull
. certain story elements are too coincidental
.
and too much of the film ' s dramatic agenda is played too straight
. a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin ' s true identity
(
" you brought a killer into my parents ' house
!
"
) is extremely silly
. you get the picture
. obviously
, i doed not have a pleasant experience at
" money talks
.
"
but the people around me appeared to be having a rip
- roaring good time
( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing fo his health
)
.
but tucker
, at least for me
, is a pretty funny guy
,
anbd aces the movie ' s best scene
, where franklin passes himself off as vic damone ' s son at james
anbd grace ' s engagment bash
and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics
. tucker ' s audience
-
-
and he does hve one
-
- will probably like
" money talks
.
" thsoe who he irritates
,
howver
, will have a more productive day staying home
and scraping thge gook out from under their toenails
.
