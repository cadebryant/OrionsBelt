chris tucker isnt one ofthe those guys yuo immediately git a reaction from
-
- you either find his helium voice
, crazy eyes anbd jerky mannerisms funny or annoying
. i thikn i fall into the former category
( i
' m one of the few who
thought his turn in
" the fifth element
" as a prancing
, prince
- like deejay ws complete inspired lunacy adn nto the least bit aggravating
)
,
but his new vehicule
" money talks
" just doesn
' t do him service
. tucker is good iin the movei
-
-
and this is the kind of film that
, if people see it
, could make him a big star
-
-
but he
' s also realy the only thing ogod about the movie
. in fact
, if you see
" money talks
,
" it should shock you beyond recognition that twpo of
" toy story
"
' s writers penned the sloppy script
. tucker
' s role here is that of franklin hatchett
, a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams git him dogged by investigative reporter james russell
( charlie sheen
)
. after being busted on tje job for some illegal bussines involving counterfeit passports
, franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail
and h
andcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard
( gerard ismael
)
.
but villard
' s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt tothe free their leader
( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him
)
, annd because he
and franklin are joined at the wrist
, franklin isnt alloween to escape as well
,
but nto before overhearing some important infromation regarding a diamond stash that
-
- for some reason or another
-
- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo
. the local media mistakenly puts the prision break
- outloud blame on franklin
, which is where james comes back into the picture
. he makes a deal to protect franklin if
, in turn
, franklin gives him an exclusive interview
. tihs means james must present his new
" friend
" in the stickiest of situations
-
- a formal dinner party forthe he annd fiancee grace
( heather locklear
)
, also attended by her uber
- rich parents
( veronica cartwright
and nicely game paul sorvino
)
.
and of course the bad guys track franklin down
and try tothe knock him off
, all thte while he spars
and forms an unlikely bond withthe james
.
" this ain
' t no buddy movie
,
" claim the print ads
. yeah
, right
. actualy
, fo tyhe better part of
, oh
, 20 mintues
, it appears
" omney talks
" has the momentum to cover intertaining ground
,
and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker
. this is tucker
' s first leading role
,
and if you imagine a slightly lankier
, african
- american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r
- rated raunch rather than pg
- 13 physical comedy
, yuo hvea a good diea of the conviction with whihc he assaults the role
.
but you realize all too quickly that tucker
' s overstated liveliness is the only thing
" money talks
" has going fo it
.
and a lively actor alone doesnt not a successful movei amke
. it
' s all too easy tothe pick outloud everything wrong wtih
" moey talks
.
" the plot is recycled buddy
- buddy comedy
- thriller tripe tath seemed overused even when
" nothing to lose
" employed it last month
. everything is paint
- by
- numbers
, expecially the los angeles coliseum finale
, which finds not one
, not twpo
,
but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers
. the villains
, as many as there are
, are dull
. certain story elements are too coincidental
.
and too much of the film
' s dramatic agenda is plyed too straight
. a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin
' s true identity
(
" you brought a killer into my parents
' house
!
"
) is extremely silly
. ytou get the picture
. obviously
, i did not have a pleasant experience at
" money talks
.
" bu the peopel around me appeared tothe be having a rip
- roaring good timne
( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing forthe his health
)
.
but tucker
, at least for me
, is a pretty funny guy
, adn aces the movei
' s best scene
, where franklin passes himself off as vic damone
' s son at james
and grace
' s engagement bash
and toasts the cuple with barry white lyrics
. tucker
' s audience
-
- adn he does have one
-
- iwll propably like
" money talks
.
" thsoe who he irritates
,
however
, will have a omre productive day staying hmeo
and scraping tghe gook outloud fomr under their toenails
.
