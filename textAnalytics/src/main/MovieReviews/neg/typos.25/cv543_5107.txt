aparently
, wehn crap calls
, jim carrey answers
. here he isnt
, mugging it up inspite countless unfunny ways for the fifth time
, his second go
- around in the role of pet detective ace ventura
. that means more tlaking ass
- cracks
, penis jokes
and cries ofthe

then
.
" it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler
' s list in terms of dramatic merit
, or lack ofthe
. granted
, there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre
- school humer
, bu anyone who appreciates ogod comedy will bing theri head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle
. it
' s a painful experience for anyone with a brain
. ace isnt distraught after accdientally droping a racoon into a canyon
( in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone
' s cliffhanger
, jim carrey being the onyl person who can make stallone look like a coleeg professor in terms ofthe intellect
, or lack of
)
and decides to retire to thte mountains ofthe tibet to gain a higher levle of consiciousness
( or
, in his case
, a level of consciousness
)
.
but he is pulled out of retirement tothe the tune ofthe
$ 20
, 000 to retreive a sacred white bat for an african tribe
. why africa
? so carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino
and later climb out the rayar end as a tourist familiy watches

' s about to give birth
!
"
)
. if that seems liek hee
- haw humor to you
, by all means
, see tghe movie
. if not
, claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us
. obviously
, there are qtuie a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movei
, like yhe first ace ventura film
( i use the word
" film
" only beacuse it ws filmed
, not because there
' s any level ofthe artistic merit
.
)
, a huge success
. in fact
, carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture
. yuo may sday tothe me

but
andrew
, look at jerry lewis
. he was born with a negative i
. q
. adn look how populare he was thirty years ago
.
" maybe
, bu i still say jerry lewis isnt a notch or two uv on tyhe comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie ofthe a rabid bulldog biting off a man
' s testicles
.
.
. lewis at least had tghe dignity to save that performance for when comany came over
