breakdown is an moderately entertaining
, if underwhelming
, thriller
. kurt russell annd kathleen quinlan play couple jeff annd amy taylor
, taking thge scenic route to california through redneck country
.
however
, while in the middle ofthe nowhere
, their jeep decides to break down
, leaving them str
anded
. a friendly truck driver
, warren
( walsh
)
, offers to give them a lift to town
.
al
though jeff rejects tje offer
( he wants to stay with his car
)
, amy agrees
, hops inot warren
' s lorry
,
and promptly disappears
. jeff wonders where tjhe hell she is
,
and when he later catches up with warren anbd warren says he has never seen amy in his life
, tje plot thickens
and jeff goes onthe a chase to find his wife
.
al
though comparisons cin be made wtih this film to deliverance
( 1972
) adn the vanishing
( 1993
) plot wise
, the latter two are far superior charactor
and scirpt wise
. kurt russell isnt o
. k as jeff
, all
though he can seemingly only pull of one expression
, whihc is angry
. througout the whole film
, he looks angry
( or just pissed off
.
) quinlan is o
. k agina
,
but agian she can only pul off one expression
, which is looking dorky
. throughout the hwole film
, she looks dorky
. j
. t walsh
( who
, sadly
, recently pasted awya
) is fine as warren
( who we soon fidn out is a kidnapper
)
al
though his actual charater is pretty weak
,
and nto really menacing enough
. the supporting cast do their best aswell
, wih rex linn as a doubting sheriff
,
and the other kidnappers
. the story
, written by first
- timer jonathan mostow
( who also directs
) is o
. k
, if surprisingly familiar anbd somtimes extraordinarily stupid
. some of tghe things the characters do in htis movie is beyond teh bounds ofthe idiocy
. there are some flaws with the plot also
, as the cahracters do the complete opposite to logical
( presumably to keep thge story
' exciting
'
)
and also the fact that teh story jsut isn
' t strong anough to sustain the audience
' s attention
. the picture moves allong vyer slowly aslo
. it almost threatens to drop dead
. the picture does pick uv towards the end
,
but by
then it
' s too lite
. mostow directs the acation sequences well enough
,
however
. tjhe film doesn
' t really come to a satisfying conclusion
, either
. thte endig trys to be obleek
, bu just comes off annoying
. breakdown coudl of been a far more enjoyable picture hadnt it hadnt a stronger cast
and director
. instead
, it just turns out to be merely averege
. a missed opportunity
. overall rating
