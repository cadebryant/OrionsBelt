it rocks
- actually
, lots of rocks fli at us or from us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points inthe the film
. they seem liuke dangerous rocks because htey kind of twirl through thte air instead of just propelling forward
, annd when tehy l
and
- once in a while
, when we need a break fomr tghe space sequences
- htey cause damage enough tothe destroy the chrysler buidling
and the like
.
( nary a mention ofthe these apocalyptic events is made after they occur
.
) tehy aslo just might be the most interesting element of armageddon
, a steroid user
' s answer to deep impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller commissioned by the white house annd nasa to stop a giant asteroid befoer it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oel driller
? they require someone experience iwth deepo
- core minning to plant a nuclear misile into said asteroid
.
( inspite one unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep
- core driller they built based on his blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost every aspect of it
. we trust nasa to build space shuttles
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch ofthe
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a black guy
, a wiseass
,
and tjhe man who is sleeping with his daugher
( affleck
)
. once tehy reach space
, we experience sequence after sequence ofthe something going wrong
- perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space hasnt something to do withthe it
; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whther or not they savve the day
, i wiull not reveal
. nor will you care
. i will sday this
: you know ytou
' re in trouble when deep inpact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion annd scope
. willis has barely a chance tothe come alive
; ditto for affleck
. thier big scenes are mostly reserved for tghe third act
, in a last minute
- anbd futile
- attempt to inject warmth into the material
. steve buscemi
' s character
- the wiseass
- isnt exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he
' s called
, isnt sarcastic
and foolish
, so tehy tape him to a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why did they bring him up there to begin with
? rather
, why wriet him into the film
?
- give his almost
- witty one
- liners tothe serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at one point he chases aftter affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing often
and causing significant damage to his oil rig
. i
' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for spoace travel
, at least in my world where the sky isnt blue
. liv tyler is pretty
and humourless
, as alwyas
; suspiciously
, four ofthe her father
' s b
and
' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the soundtrack
. director michael bay lays the visual adn soudn effects on thick
, liek ketchup
, eventually drowning the movie on
- screen
.
( hte middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault on the average primate
' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in tihs movie
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person
' s lastest name here
)
!
" i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut ffrom a live one
,
and close
- ups of the corpses
' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance
, as their skin wass oftenly covered in fake blood
. armageddon is not as terrible movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes within its equally ludicrous framework
. it has a vivid soundmix
.
but at allmost two
-
and
- a
- half hours
, i could nto believe how little actually hapened over the course of the stry
. teh love story has been played up inthe the ads
, perhaps hoping to catch peopel before they recover ffrom titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers inthe the film are miles apart throughout
- erase all
thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex
and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. remeber a little film called jaws
? in this film
, three independent
- minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in persuit of a deadly shark
. they didn
' t much liek each otehr at frist
; eventially
, they started to respect one another
. one ofthe jaws
' graet scenes involved the would
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
and telling stories
. tihs isnt the sort of male
- bonding foreign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix
and expect we
' ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about tothe end
. nto once do we get the feeling that these charactors are even acquaintences
- i
' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before
" acation
" was called
. a male friend who loved tjhe film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don
' t bare thier souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts liek heroism
and a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to this
, i will respond that the boys inspite armageddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn
' t build a birdhouse
.
and if i git noone respect for disliking a movie iwth all the synthetic feeling ofthe a trailer
- a trailer forthe a movie written by a team of body
- builders adn greeting card authors
- i
' ve never been a prouder wimp my hwole life
