well
, as i check my score kard for whta i
' ve done tihs holiday weekend
, it reads good ideas
: 0
and dumb ideas
: 1
. i don
' t know what i was thinking when i decided tothe watch tihs movie
.
but in my defense
, i can only sday thast it was someone else who urged me to see this iwth him
. the film tyhat i
' m talking about is
` a night at the roxbury
,
' one of those offereings based on a saturday night live skit
. wayne annd garth
, theese two are nto
. rather
, we meet doug adn steve
butabi
( the actors
' names are not worth mentioning
)
, two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem tothe be finding a way to git into the hottest night club in yhe city
, the roxbury
. driving in thier dad
' s bmw
and donning metallic disco suits right outloud ofthe miami vice
, they try to bribe the bouncer to get into tje club
.
` have you met my friend washington anbd his friend roosevelt
,
' they confidently sday as they pull out spare pocket change
. their second greatest ambition seems tothe be oozing out as many silly pick
- uv lines as is humanly possible inspite order to start a conversation with a girl
(
` let me see that lable
. just as i
thought
- made in heaven
,
' says oney ofthe the brothers
)
. annd
, liek the losers that htey are
, they fail to do either for much of the film
. howver
, as fate would have it
, an accidental meeting with
` what
- ever
- happened
- to
' richard grieco gives them teh all
- important ticket to get in
. theri sad lives take on a whole new direction
. they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that theese two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene
.
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women
. bu thier newfound popularity does nto impress their father
, who has other plans fo them
. thte unfortunate thing baout this film is that this is a one
- joke movie
,
and the brothers are the joke
. actually
, ther
' s about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff
. alas
, too long for tv
and way too short for a feature
- lenght film
. thus
, ther just isn
' t enough material to sustain teh 83
- minute movie
. there
' s no plot to be found anbd everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity tothe excecute their trademark move ofthe snapping their heads iin unison to the funky beat of haddaway
' s europop song
, what isnt love
. i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash
. to take up more film tiem
, there is a subplot involving the daughter of the buisnessman next door who wants tothe marry doug
. tihs creates not only friction betwen the brothers
,
but their unlikey pairing will also agiatte audience munbers as well
. she
' s educated
and a forebearing witch
. meanwhile
, doug isnt a complete loser
. how did these twpo ever git together
? i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question
, i
' ll have figured out why i decided to go adn see this movie
. if you
' re looking for enteratinment
, ytou won
' t find it at teh roxbury
.
