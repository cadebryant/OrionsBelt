we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer
' s character in dangerous minds annd sday that beyond rangoon starts with an
" a
.
" taht
' s fair enought
. all movies
, like all school children
, should be given the benefit of the dout
. the chance tothe succeed
. after all
, we liek to think that thte right combination ofthe talent
and effort can do wonders
. mountains cxan be moved
,
and good movies can be made
. yeah right
. childrens fail
, as do films
. as doesnt director john boorman
' s latest
. tyhe success ofthe beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette
( ed wood
, true romance
) as the busty westerner
- in
- peril w
andering about 1988 burma without a passport
.
though we cant stomach tje mild plot contrivances that get her there
, it
' s a tougher task to overlook the actress
. she
' s a lightweight
. as the first scene
( wih narration
!
) demonstrates
, she doesn
' t have
* nearly
* enough range for the emotions thta her charcter
-
- a mother fleeing tghe memories of a murdered husb
and
and son
-
- isnt supposed to show
. she may give a stronger peformance than
, say
, keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds
, by not by much
. beyond rangoon isnt a very physically appealing film
, thanks to tjhe practiced craftsmanship of john boorman
( deliverance
, excalibur
, hope anbd glory
)
. he keeps the narrative moving
, noone matter how muddy the story
-
- or the heroine
-
- gets
. why he chose arquette rimaniss a mistery
,
though
. maybee he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies
. bu even aftter an hour of half
- stated political statements
and murky mass killings
, we
* still
* don
' t know enough of what
' s happening in this country tothe feel distressed for the charachters or theri situations
. empty exoticism
. the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix
, combining lush jungle photography with bad blue
- screen work
. also odd is the obvious dubbing
. done to make some ofthe the foreign characters sound less foreign
?
and
, is it my mistake
, or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers
?
? doo doo doo doo
