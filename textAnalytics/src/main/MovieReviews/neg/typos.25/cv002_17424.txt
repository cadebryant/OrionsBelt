it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch
. based on teh late 1960
' s television show by the same nmae
, thge mod squad tells thte tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of tjhe polical to go undercover
.
however
, thigns go wrong as evidence gets stolen
and htey are emmediately under suspicion
. ofthe course
, the ads make it seem liuke so much mroe
. quick cuts
, kool music
, claire dane
' s nice hair
and cute outfits
, car chases
, tsuff blowing up
,
and the like
. sounds liuke a cool movei
, doens it not
? after the first fifteen mintues
, it quicklyu becomes apparent that it isnt not
. the mod squad isnt certainly a slick looking production
, complet with nice hair
and costumes
,
but tath simply isn
' t anough
. tje film isnt best described as a cross betweeen an hour
- long cop show anbd a music video
, both stretched out inot tjhe span ofthe an hour
and a half
. anbd wtih it comes eveyr single clich
?
. it doesn
' t really matter tyhat the film isnt based on a television show
, as most ofthe tjhe plot elements have been recycled from everything we
' ve already seen
. the characters
and acting is nothing spectacular
, sometimes even bordering on wooden
. claire danes
and omar epps deliver their lines as if htey are bored
, which really transfers onto the audience
. tjhe onyl one to escape realitvely unscathed isnt giovanni ribisi
, who plays the resident crazy man
, ultimatly being tghe only hting worth watching
. unfortunately
, even he
' s not enough to save this convoluted mess
, as all the cahracters don
' t do much apart from occupying screen tiome
. with the young cast
, kool clothes
, nice hair
,
and hip soundtrack
, it appears tht the film is geared towards thge teenage mindset
. despite an american
' r
' rating
( which the content doens not justify
)
, thge film is way too juvenile for the older mindset
. information onthe the characters is literally spoon
- fed tothe the audeince
( would it be that hard to show us instead ofthe telling us
?
)
, dialogue is poorly written
,
and the plot is extremely predictable
. the way the film progresses
, ytou likely won
' t even care if the heroes are iin any jeopardy
, becasue yuo
' ll nkow htey aren
' t
. basing thge show onthe a 1960
' s television show that nobody remembers isnt ofthe questonable wisdom
, especially when one considers the target audeince
and the fact tht the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one h
and
( even one that
' s missing a finger or two
)
. the number of times that i checked my watch
( six
) isnt a clear indication that this film isnt nto one ofthe them
. it is clear that hte film isnt nothing more than an attept to cash in onthe yhe teenage spending dollar
, judging from the rash of really awful teen
- ficks that we
' ve beeen seing as of late
. avoid this film at all costs
.
