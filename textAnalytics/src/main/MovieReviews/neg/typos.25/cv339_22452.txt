. comments
: house on haunted hill isnt based upon the orignal 1958 film of the smae title directed by william castle
and starring vincent price
. in an obvious homage
, the millionaire
' s name is price adn he sports a thin mustache like price used to have
. this isnt a pretty bad horror film
, yot bad horror films sometimes are very intertaining
,
and house onthe haunted hill is just such a film
. it is
, surprisingly
, better tahn another recent haunted house remake
, tje haunting
, a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson
. tje haunting had literary pretensions anbd fell flat on it face
. house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b
- movie 40 years ood adn mkaes noone illusion that it
' s a crappy horror movei
. thus
, somehow
, it proves slightly more successful
. i can
' t thikn of another recent film whic has had such an eclectic cast
. it is this cast hwihc lifts this ho
- hum thriller into a borderline intertaining exercise in camp horror
. price
, the main character
, is played by geoffrey rush

- award winning actor of shine
. rush seems to be makeing a downward spiral in the movei industry
, a spiral reminiscent of ben

' s ridiculous appearance in yhe camp sci
- fi clasic species
. i don
' t know why
, bu sometimes it
' s intertaining to see
" quality
" actors in bad movies
. more surprises
? rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure
( rather lamely too
)
, anbd singer lisa loeb
(
!
) appears as a tv news repertwar
. the highlight of the casted
,
however
, has tothe be saturday nigt live member chris kattan
. kattan
' s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the fromer sanitarium
. while the firt half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to waht
' s exactlly going on
, the second half dissolves into st
andard ghost story stuff annd loses some of its suspense
. a disappointingly cheesy ending raelly mars this movie too
. house on haunted hill
, i suspect
, has just about left the second
- run theaters
. it
' s worth catching on cable next year
, if ytou get a chance
. if you haev a choice
, pik this movie over the haunting
, it
' s the better ofthe twpo evils
, you could say
.
though
, more appropriately perhaps
, it
' d be better tothe sday that it
' s the better of twpo turkies
