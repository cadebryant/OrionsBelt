- tempered son
, michael
. diedre
, at the smae time
, murders a bunch of people
. comments
: the ex is a vrey bad movie
. i haven ' t seen a turkey ofthe this magnitude in quite a hwile
. i kept vacillating
,
however
, bewteen giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness
adn threee stars fo its campy humor
( ultimatly
, i desided tothe splitted the diference
and give it two stars
)
. as summarized briefly in the synopsis
, htis is
yet another spurned
- psycho
- lover
- gets
- her
- revenge tipe movie
. i ' m nto sure how many films have been produced usance fatal attraction which use htis tired storyline
,
but it seems like 10
, 000
, 000
, 000
. tje ex
,
however
,
though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre
, differs slightly fomr the norm inwhich that
, at least
, it doesn ' t tkae itself too seriously like so many other duds do
( malicious
and stalked are two examples which come to mind
)
. those involved inspite the movie realize they ' re in a turkey
, apparently
,
and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained withing the script
. the ex ' s storyline
, as i said
, incorprates many cliches predominant in films of its nature
;
howver
, the plot is so overwrought
and unbelievable that
, aftter a while
, the viewer must accept that logic does not opperate in thge relm of the movie
. diedre
, david ' s first wife
, kills
and kills
and kills
, for example
, without ever having to worry baout police investigations
and tghe liek
( it ' s nto as
though she ' s bright enough not tothe leave fingerprints at the scene ofthe yhe crime
)
. david
and his newyorker wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael
, their son
, has emotional problems
, specifically his inability to control his anger
.
though david smokes liuke tomorrow will never come
and blows uv at people eveyr otehr minute in the movie
, the conection betweeen him
anbd his son is not made
. molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she ' s a child psychologist
and allows the demented woman to spend time witht her son
. time
and time again
, things do not add up in thsi movie
. if a viewer cxan ' t accept thsi fact
,
then he will definately not like the ex
. if
, on the otehr hand
, he can appretiate the movie for its campiness
,
thn he ' ll probably like it much better
. i don ' t mean tothe necessarily suggest
,
however
, that yhe ex is a memorable exercise in camp
. even when viewed from an it ' s
- so
- bad
- it ' s
- good angle
, this movie isn ' t all that successful
. the ex does have its moments
,
though
, alomst all of which involve yancy butler
( the psychotic diedre
)
and nick mancuso
( david
)
. these twpo actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which
, oftentimes
, elicit chuckles from the audience
. tje truly awful lines written for them help this humer allong
. butler gets tghe larger portion ofthe bad dialogue
; every time her charater kills somone
, she has a punchline that ' s unbelievably inane
. whn she murders a tenant ofthe an apartment she wishes tothe use to spy on david
, for example
, diedre whacks thge elderly lady with a crowbar
and states
" i ' m so sorry
, your lease is terminated
.
" or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another rediculous scene
?
( diedre ' s therapist wishes to have her recommitted
, so she decides tothe visit diedre
, alone
, inaddition her newyorker apartment
-
- never realizing
, ofthe course
, that it ' s not her ' s
. therapists typically are catatonically brain
- dead in these movies
)
. having successfully snuffed the woman out
, diedre looks at teh body
and says
:
" what ws it that you always said to me at the end of eahc session
, dr
. jones
? oh
, that ' s right
. ' i ' m sory
,
but your time is up
! '
" this is what passes for humor in the film
. the audiance doesn ' t necessarily laugh
but groan
( the type ofthe groan thta suggests the audience cin ' t believe htey ' re watching this crap
-
-
altough watching it they are
)
. nick mancuso ' s chainsmoking
, nervous
- wreck character does not ahev tjhe cheesy lines that butler ' s character delivers
,
but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief
. inthe between drags off his cigarette
, for instance
, in one ofthe tghe movei ' s best scenes
, david tries to explain tothe his lawyer what a creep his ex
- wife is
. in exaggerated exasperation
, he nearly shouts
" tje woman is a cuckoo
- bird
!
"
( trust me
, it is funny in context
.
)
and so
, the movei continues utnil its painfully obvious conclusion
. i won ' t reveal the endig specifically
(
though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers ofthe this type could probably guess yhe endig jstu from htis film review
)
,
but i will sday that the ex has oen of tjhe biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film
. molly
and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds
! molly
, at one point inaddition tjhe film
, not
- so
- brilliantly observes
, after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family ' s to spy upon them
, thgat
" she ' s crazy
.
" you ' d be pretty crazy too if you ' d rented this turkey
. i ' d avoid it unless it ' s on tv
and you come across it
. if you do
, yuo may whant to watch it
, groan at tghe bad punchlines
annd stupid plot
,
annd feel good that you didn ' t spend money renting it
.
