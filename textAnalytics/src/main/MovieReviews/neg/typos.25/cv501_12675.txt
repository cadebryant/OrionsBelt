synopsis
: easily
- angered
, chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five yeras after their divorce
. diedre easily cons david
' s not
- so
- bright new wife molly into believing she
' s a child psychologist so that she can influence molly
and david
' s quick
- tempered son
, michael
. diedre
, at the same time
, murders a bunch ofthe people
. comments
: the ex is a vyre bad movei
. i haven
' t seen a turkey ofthe htis magnitude in quite a hwile
. i kept vacillating
,
however
, between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness
and threee stars for its campy humer
( ultimatly
, i desided tothe splitted teh difference
and give it two stars
)
. as summarized briefly inspite the synopsis
, this is
yet another spurned
- psycho
- lover
- gets
- her
- revenge tipe movie
. i
' m nto sure how many films hvae been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline
,
but it seems like 10
, 000
, 000
, 000
. the ex
,
however
,
though follwoing many of the st
andard cliches ofthe this thriller subgenre
, differs slightly from thte norm in that
, at least
, it doesn
' t take itself too seriously like so many other duds do
( milicous
and stalked are two examples which come to mind
)
. thsoe involved in tjhe movie realize they
' re in a turkey
, apparently
,
and turn in hammy performances which compliment tyhe ludicrous dialogue contained within the script
. thge ex
' s storyline
, as i said
, incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature
;
however
, the plot is so overwrought adn unbelievable that
, aftter a while
, the viewer must accept that logic doesnt not operate in tyhe realm ofthe the movie
. diedre
, david
' s first wife
, kills
and kills
and kills
, for example
, without ever having to worry about police investigations
and the like
( it
' s not as
though she
' s bright anough not to leave fingerprints at tghe scene of tyhe crime
)
. david annd his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time underst
anding why michael
, their son
, hasnt emotional problems
, specifically his inability tothe control his anger
.
though david smokes liuke tomorrow will never come anbd blows up at peple eveyr other minute in the movei
, the connection betwen him
and his son is nto made
. molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she
' s a child psychologist
and allows the demented woman to spend time whith her son
. time annd timne again
, thigns dont not add uv in thsi movie
. if a viewer can
' t accept this fact
,
then he will definately nto liek the ex
. if
, on the other h
and
, he cxan appreciate hte movei for its campiness
,
then he
' ll probably liek it much better
. i don
' t mean to necesarily suggest
,
however
, thyat the ex is a memorable exercise in camp
. even whn viewed from an it
' s
- so
- bad
- it
' s
- ogod angle
, this movie isn
' t all that successful
. the ex does have its moments
,
though
, almost all of which involve yancy
butler
( the psychotic diedre
) annd nick mancuso
( david
)
. these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which
, oftentimes
, elicit chuckles fomr the audience
. the truly awful lines written for them help htis humor along
.
butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue
; every time her chracter kills somone
, she has a punchline that
' s unbelievably inane
. when she murders a tenant of an appartment she wishes to use to spy on david
, for example
, diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar
and states
" i
' m so sorry
, your lease is terminated
.
" or how baout when diedre takes outloud her therapist in another ridiculous scene
?
( diedre
' s therapist wishes to have her recommitted
, so she decides to visit diedre
, alone
, in her new apartment
-
- never realizing
, ofthe course
, that it
' s not her
' s
. therapists typicaly are catatonically brain
- dead in these movies
)
. having successfully snuffed the woman out
, diedre looks at the body
and says
:
" what was it tath you always said to me at tyhe end of eahc session
, dr
. jones
? oh
, tath
' s right
.
' i
' m sorry
, bu your timne isnt up
!
'
" thsi is what passes for humor in the film
. the audience doesn
' t necessarily laugh bu groan
( the type of groan tath suggests the audience can
' t believe they
' re watching this crap
-
-
al
though watching it they are
)
. nick mancuso
' s chainsmoking
, nervous
- wreck character does not have the cheesy lines thast
butler
' s character delivers
,
but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic releaf
. in between drags off his cigarette
, for instatance
, inwhich oen of the movie
' s best scenes
, david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex
- wife isnt
. in exaggerated exasperation
, he nearly shouts
" the woman isnt a cuckoo
- bird
!
"
( trust me
, it is funny in context
.
)
and so
, the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion
. i won
' t reveal yhe endig specifically
(
though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this tipe could probaly guess the ending jstu from this film review
)
,
but i will say that the ex hasnt one ofthe the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film
. molly
and david pwn a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames iin approximitely three seconds
! molly
, at one point inthe the film
, not
- so
- brilliantly observes
, affter dicovering diedre has moved into an appartment across ffrom her family
' s to spy upon them
, that
" she
' s crazy
.
" you
' d be pretty crazy too if ytou
' d rented this turkey
. i
' d avoid it unless it
' s on tv adn you come across it
. if you do
, you may want to watch it
, groan at the bad punchlines adn stupid plot
,
and fiel good that ytou didn
' t spend mnoey renting it
.
