capsule
: an insult
. a stupid
and incompetent movie taht doesn ' t even have the benefit of bieng trashily enjoyable
. weslely
and woody owudl dont well to leave htis off their resumes
. money train is oney ofthe the worst movies i hvae ever seen
. it ' s nto simply idiotic
, it ' s contemptuous of its audience
. it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or jsut plain omit entirely
. it ' s a waste of wesley snipes
adn woody harrelson
, who are enjoyable actors in their own rights
bu are nauseating here
. it ' s nto even fun as trash
. woody
and wesley star
( mabey that ' s not the right word
) as new york city transit authority police
. they have a job which coudl acually be the core of a really interesting movei
: one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain
- snatchers
annd the otehr does lookout
. i hadnt a wohle headful of legal
and ethical questions surrounding thsi
, raised by a documentary i ' d seen on the subject once
,
but tjhe movie does not waste any tyme wtih bieng intelligent or throught
- provoking
. see if you can follow this
. htey chase a kid down tjhe tunnel
and into teh station where the
" money turain
"
, the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the tolkein books
, is parked
. tyhe guards onthe the train see this kid running at them
, lift their machine guns
, shout
" halt
!
"
and
then open fier when the kid doesn ' t stpo running at them
. blam
, teh kid ' s dead
.
then woody
and wesley sohw up
,
and ofthe course thge otehr ta cops hite them
( why
?
)
,
and a pushing match starts
,
and someone gets decked
,
and
.
.
. i covered my face
. i ' d seen enough
. i ' ve never seen a movie work so hard
and in so little tiem to distroy
, systematically
, any chance of being credible or interesting
. fed up wih the bs at their job
( most of it their own goddamned fault
)
, woody
and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the moey train
. hence yhe title
, inspite case some of you
( all twpo ofthe you
) didn ' t figure it out
yet
.
hten there ' s thsi subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks
,
*
adn
* a love story
,
*
and
* a holdup
-
- noone
, two holdups
, sorry
, easy tothe lose track infact a movie htis braindead
-
-
*
and
* a mob boss who whants his money
. there wasn ' t a minute when i gave a horse ' s ass about any ofthe it
. neither woody nor wesley play characters that are intresting for a single minute
. we do nto care about them
. they are not interesting
. they are noisy
, loud
, stupid
, foolish jerks who whould have flunked out ofthe yhe police academy
. htey deserve to get shot
-
- or run over
, as the case may be
. tehy only exist to rehash tje kind ofthe dynamics that ws
* written
* into a movei like white men can ' t jump
,
adn which simply does not exist here
. tehy are idiots
,
and we ' re expeced to root for them
. bullcrap
. the movie is completely schizophrenic iin its tone
and texture
. what exactlly is this mess
? a cop movie
? polical procedure is nto given a moment ' s genuine thought anywhere
. a thriller
? the subplot wih tjhe tolkein booth killer isnt inept
, a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite
. a comedy
? the few jokes thast do work are wasted
. a drama
? all dramatic tension betwen both principals isnt freeze
- dried
annd off
- the
- rack
. htere ' s not a moent inspite hte movie where i falt like i was listening to genuin human beings talk
; it ' s all screenwriterese
, that bizarre analect where eveyr sentence ends in a punchline
adn the primary mode of expression isnt the unique conjunctions ofthe four
- letter words
.
( actual dialogue excerpt
:
" fuck you
.
"
" what
?
"
" yuo heard me
: fuck
* yuo
*
.
"
" no
: fuck
* you
*
!
"
) look
. i ' ll be honest here
. i ' ve tryed wirting screenplays
,
anbd even
* i
* suspect that if i tried tothe pitch this mess
, i ' d git laughed out of hte office
. anyone interseted in hearing my idaes for a few good movies cin write me
and hear my pitch
, because god knows i know i can dont better
. i ' ve weasted anough time on htis piece of tripe
.
