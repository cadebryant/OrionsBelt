capsule
: an insult
. a stupid
and incompetent movie that doesn
' t even have tyhe benefit ofthe being trashily enjoyable
. weslely anbd woody would dont well to leave this off thier resumes
. money train is one of tghe worst movies i have ever seen
. it
' s not simply idiotic
, it
' s contemptuous of its audiance
. it tries tothe make us swallow thigns that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely
. it
' s a waste of wesley snipes
and woody harrelson
, who are enjoyable actors in their own rights
but are nauseating here
. it
' s not even fun as trash
. woody
and wesley star
( maeby that
' s not thge right word
) as new york city transit authority polical
. they ahve a job whcih could atcually be the core ofthe a really interesting movie
: one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain
- snatchers
and the other does lookout
. i had a whole headful ofthe legal
and ethical questions surounding this
, raised by a documentary i
' d seen on the subject once
, bu yhe movei does not waste any time with bieng intelligent or
thought
- provoking
. see if you cxan follow this
. they chase a kid down the tunnel
and inot the station where the
" money train
"
, the heavily armored car that picks up all yhe cash from the token books
, is parked
. the guards onthe the train see this kid runnung at them
, lift their machine guns
, shout
" halt
!
"
and thn open frie when the kid doesn
' t stop running at them
. blam
, the kid
' s dead
.
then woody
and wesley sohw up
,
and ofthe course tghe other ta cops hate them
( why
?
)
,
and a pushing match starts
, adn somene gets decked
,
and
.
.
. i covered my face
. i
' d seen enought
. i
' ve never seen a movie work so hard
and in so little time to distroy
, systematically
, any chance ofthe bieng credible or interesting
. feeded up with the bs at their job
( most of it their own goddamned fault
)
, woody
and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob tyhe money turain
. hence the title
, inthe case some ofthe ytou
( all two of you
) didn
' t figure it out
yet
.
then there
' s this subplot about a maniac who torches tolkein book clerks
,
*
and
* a love story
,
*
and
* a holdup
-
- no
, two holdups
, sorry
, easy to lose track inaddition a movie this braindead
-
-
* anbd
* a mob boss who wants his money
. there wasn
' t a minute whn i gavey a horse
' s ass about any ofthe it
. neither woody nor wesley play charactors that are intresting for a single minute
. we dont not care baout them
. they are not interesting
. htey are noisy
, loud
, stupid
, foolish jerks who whould hve flunked outloud of the police academy
. tehy deserve to get shot
-
- or run over
, as the case may be
. they only exist to rehash the kind ofthe dynamics that was
* written
* inot a movei like white men can
' t jump
,
and which simply does not exsist here
. they are idiots
,
and we
' re expected tothe root fo them
. bullcrap
. the movie isnt completely schizophrenic in its tone
and texture
. whta exactlly is this mess
? a cop movie
? police procedger isnt nto given a moment
' s genuine
thought anywhere
. a thriller
? hte subplot with the tolkein booth killer is inept
, a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewriet
. a comedy
? yhe few jokes that do work are wasted
. a drama
? all dramtic tension between both principals is freeze
- dried
and off
- the
- rack
. htere
' s not a moent in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuin human beings talk
; it
' s all screenwriterese
, tyhat bazare analect where every sentence ends in a punchline
and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions ofthe four
- letter words
.
( actual dialogue excerpt
:
" fuck you
.
"
" what
?
"
" you heard me
: fuck
* you
*
.
"
" noone
: fuck
* you
*
!
"
) look
. i
' ll be honest here
. i
' ve tried writing screenplays
,
and even
* i
* suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess
, i
' d get laughed out of the office
. anyone interseted in hearing my ideas fo a few good movies can write me
and hear my pich
, beccause god konws i nkow i can dont better
. i
' ve weasted enough time on tihs piece of tripe
.
