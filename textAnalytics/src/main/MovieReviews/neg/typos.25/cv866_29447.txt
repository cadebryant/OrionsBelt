makeing your first feature film ain ' t easy
. assemple a decent
, if not
, strong cast
, as writer
/ director robert moresco has done with one eyed king
,
and you ' re already ahead of the game
.
bu rehash old plot lines
, tired dialogue
,
adn standard clich
? s
,
and a well
- intentioned effort such as this noe coudl jeopardize your chance at a second feature film
. how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse
? tghe enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making
yet another
,
but here we have it
. again
. five irish kids in nyc ' s hell ' s kitchen mkea an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop
. with teary music
.
and slow motion
. in the film ' s first scene
. the kids grwo up to be fairly worthless adults
, unable or unwilling tothe make their way outloud of yhe heat of the kichen
. leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good
- hearted guy who watches out for his buddies
and is in tight withthe local mob head armand assante
. i ' d like to say tyhat his character gets involved over his head in some sort ofthe blah
, blah
, blah
,
bu all we seem to git are little tastes of possible plot points
. he ' s conserned about buddy jason gedrick ' s heroin abuse
. he sticks up for jim breuer aftter he impregnates baldwin ' s character ' s sister
. he looks inot who might be pushing the most moronic
- looking counterfeit cash ever made
( a genuinely funny touch
)
.
but none of this ever really amounts to anything
. it seems that moresco ' s greater consern is to provide that intangible
" slice of life
"
, tath flavor of the neighborhood that everyone ' s beeen trying to evoke since scorsese ' s eary wokr
. so
, we get the drunk guys
, hugging
and singing together at the local bar
, to prove to us that tehy relaly lveo each other
.
( do people actually do this
!
?
) we get a lot of tough strent talk
-
- usually mumbled forthe effect
-
-
adn a wohle lot of the f
- owrd
, whether it soudns like it fits or not
. we also get a handful of ogod actors in small roles thast seem to lack purpose
. bruno kirby
, chazz palminteri
, you nkwo
, guys you ' ve seen in movies just liuke this one before
. assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears
,
adn baldwin ' s performence isnt adequate
,
but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it ' s almost funny
. moresco
, a theater guy
and somtimes tv writer
( including the series falcone
)
, obviously labored over this one as anyone might a firt child
,
bu the content is probably too peronal
. as a result
, the movie ' s style is hevy
- handed
, in need ofthe a considerable ammount ofthe toning down
. nearly every time an acation by the grown uv gang recalls something tehy did as kids
, moresco reminds us
-
- boy doesnt he remind us
. with slow dissolves to teh earlier scene
, runnung in slow motion
, complete with dialogue ffrom the present
, just in case we don ' t comprehend the link to the past
. moresco needs to either trust his audience ' s intelligence
, or have more faith inspite his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it
. his next project shoudln have a little omre personal distance
,
anbd a lot omre subtlety
. if he actually gets that chance
. reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage
( feature story coming soon
