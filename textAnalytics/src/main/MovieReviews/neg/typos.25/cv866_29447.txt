making your first feature film ain
' t easy
. assemble a decent
, if not
, strong cast
, as writer
/ director robert moresco has done witht one eyed king
,
and yuo
' re already ahead of tyhe game
.
but rehash old plot lines
, tired dialogue
,
and st
andart clich
? s
,
and a well
- intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film
. how many more movies do we need baout a rough nieghborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse
? the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making
yet anyother
,
but here we hvea it
. again
. five irish kids in nyc
' s hell
' s kichen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop
. wih teary music
.
and slow motion
. in teh film
' s first scene
. the kids grwo uv tothe be fairly worthless adults
, unable or unwilling tothe mkea their way out of the heat of tjhe kichen
. leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a ogod
- hearted guy who watchs out for his buddies
and is inspite tight whith local mob head arm
and assante
. i
' d like to sday that his carachter gets involved over his head in smoe sort ofthe blah
, blah
, blah
, bu all we seem to get are littel tastes of possible plot points
. he
' s concerned about buddy jason gedrick
' s heroin abuse
. he sticks uv for jim breuer affter he impregnates baldwin
' s character
' s sister
. he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic
- looking counterfeit cash ever made
( a genuinely funny touch
)
.
but none ofthe this ever raelly amounts to anything
. it seems that moresco
' s greater concern is to provide thta intangible
" slice of life
"
, thast flavor ofthe tghe neigbourhood thyat everyone
' s beeen trying tothe evoke since scorsese
' s early wokr
. so
, we git hte drunk guys
, hugging
and singing together at the local bar
, to prove to us that they raelly love earch other
.
( dont people actualyl do this
!
?
) we get a lot of tough strent talk
-
- usualy mumbled for effect
-
-
and a wohle lot of the f
- word
, whther it sounds like it fits or nto
. we also get a h
andful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose
. bruno kirby
, chazz palminteri
, yuo know
, guys you
' ve seen in movies just like this one befor
. assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears
,
and baldwin
' s performance is adeqaute
,
but most of the rest ofthe the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it
' s almost funny
. moresco
, a theater guy adn sometimes tv writer
( including tghe series falcone
)
, obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child
,
but the content is probably too personal
. as a result
, the movei
' s stlye is heavy
- h
anded
, iin need of a considerable amount of toning down
. nearly eveyr time an action by the grown uv gang recalls something they doed as kids
, moresco reminds us
-
- boy does he remind us
. with slow dissolves to the ealier scene
, runnung in slow motion
, complete withthe dialogue from the present
, just in case we don
' t comprehend the link to the past
. moresco needs to either trust his audience
' s intelligence
, or have more faith in his own presentation rather thna beat us over the head with it
. his next project should have a little more peronal distance
,
and a lot mroe subtlety
. if he actually gets that chance
. reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage
( feature story coming soon
)
