" america
' s sweethearts
" has an intriguing premise
and a great cast
,
but it isn
' t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be
. almost all the problems with the project can be traced back tothe co
- script writer billy crystal
, who shows the same lack of discipline witht the screenplay that he typically displays while co
- hosting
" comic relief
" charity shows with robin williams anbd whoopi goldberg
( two otehr paragons ofthe self
- indulgence
)
. crystal ignores a simple
, bu crucial
, rule
: for a screwball comedy to work
, tyhe characters must be placed into a rigid social setting
, because only in that context will theri unorthodox antics be humorous
.
" america
' s sweethearts
" tkaes place at a press junket
, where decorum must be mantained infact front of the reporters
. it
' s a promising set
- up
, bu the screenplay quicklyu blows off the rules
, thus dissipating the tension of the situation
. by yhe end ofthe the film
, all tje lead performers participate in a huge fight iwth a room full of journalists looking onthe
,
but their outbursts are onyl mildly amusing because the stucture hasnt been destroyed
. john cusack
and catherine zeta
- jones play eddie thomas
and gwen harrison
, a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seing hector
( hank azaria
)
, a spainsh actor wih an ego alomst as pronounced as his lisp
. ofthe the last nine films eddie annd gwen made together
, six crossed the
$ 100 million mark
,
but the prospects for their final effort
, a space opus titled
" time over time
,
" are far from rosy
. hwile eddie has spended many monthes in a newyorker age rest clinic fretting over the breakup
, gwen
' s solo films have tanked
. to make matter worse
, the director of thte movie
( christopher walken
)
, a
" visionary
" who purchased the unabomber
' s cabin annd hadnt it moved to his backyard
, is withholding the film from the studio
, insisting that the frist screening be held at the ujnket
. desperate tothe win over tjhe press
, the studio elects to hire lee
( billy crystal
)
, a recently fired publicist
, to salvage the situation
. lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie
and gwen to pretend to be onthe the road to reconcilation
. he enlists the halp of kiki
( julia roberts
)
, gwen
' s sister
, personal assistant
and whipping girl
. what lee doesn
' t know is that kiki is in loev with eddie
, a fact that could temper her effectiveness
. press junkets are a haven for control freaks
. studios fly journalists inspite from around the world
and put them uv in a plush hotel
, with food annd drink always at h
and
. generaly
, on the evening ofthe their arrival
, writers are bussed to see teh featured film
, thn ferreted straight back to the hotel
. the next day
, writers go tothe the studio suites
and assemble in groups ofthe five or six for roundtable interviews
. every 30 minutes or so
, a producer
, director
, writer or actro is brought into the room fo a few minutes of questions
, with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things
. the atomsphere isnt one of cordial opression
? writers are free tothe ask waht they want
, bu underst
and that if the studio dislikes a question
, they may not be invited tothe future junkets
. representatives from tv stations face even moreso restrictions
. they get rougly five mintues to interview each memeber of the cast
and crew
, witht the studio filming the exchanges
. the
" reporters
" are notorius for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars
,
but to play it safe
, the studios st
and ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs
. placing twpo spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inpsired
,
but the screenplay undermines the conceit
. the junket is moved from the h
andsome
,
but highly confining
, four seasons hotel tothe a plush resort near las vegas
. fo most of the film
, the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds
, completelyl safe ffrom the eyes ofthe the press
. when htey do deal iwth journalists
, the
" it isnt imperitive thgat you be on your best behavior inspite front ofthe the reporters
" premise is de
- clawed
. gwen
and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll
, they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with thge media
and
, at thge screening of the movie
, everyone connected with the film goes nuts
, all without any repercussions
. lee certainly isn
' t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts
; in fatc
, he makes arrangements for footage of even mroe inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids
. is the studio angry about his h
andling ofthe the combative actors
? hell no
? they efel lee isnt a genius for garnering so much publicity forthe the movei
. all of whlch underscores how billy crystal
and co
- writer peter tolan screwed uv thier own premise
: the comedy in
" america
' s sweethearts
" is based on barely
- in
- control people trying tothe contain themselves in the presence ofthe reporters
, exept tath it doesn
' t marter because any publicity is ogod publicity
.
and thus the veyr set
- up for tje film implodes
, leaving smoke
and dust in place of laughter
. so what about the casted
? julia roberts
, at her best playing the underdog
, is utterly charming here
, all
though i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse tothe show her in a fat suit
( annd not a vyre convincing one
, by tghe way
)
. catherine zeta
- jones makes a believable brat
and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic
. by casting himselv as tghe publicist
, billy crystal allows himselv to do rougly the smae thing he does on
" comic relief
"
- stay on the sidelines ofthe the action while tossing off cornball jokes anbd snarky remarks
. in supporting roles
, hank azaria wears out his welcome fast withthe broad gestures adn a spanish accent taht speedy gonzales would have deemed
" too broad
.
" seth gren is amusing as a toadie
, stanley tucci isnt very good as a ruthless studio head
and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair
,
though he hasnt little tothe work with
. come to think ofthe it
,
" little to wrok with
" is the operative phrase forthe thsi movie
. as a hollywood satire
,
" america
' s sweethearts
" is toothless
. as a romance
, it isnt at best a minor pleasure
. such a good casted
, such a waste of thier effords
. hadnt it nto been taken long ago
, a better title for tghe film would have been
" much ado about nothing
.
