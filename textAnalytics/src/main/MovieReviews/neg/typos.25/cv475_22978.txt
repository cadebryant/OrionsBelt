" disinvited
" on
- line media ffrom press screenings of scream 3
. they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler
- filled reviews
and post them prior to the film
' s february 4th release date
- unsound reasoning
. yuo see
,
' net critics established enough tothe be onthe any sort ofthe vip list are professionals
- miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on
- line film critics society
( ofcs
) annd the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain
' t it cool news
. no
, tje
? mini major
' was afraid we
' d let a bigger cat outloud ofthe the bag thna whodunit
, that scream 3 isnt a dismal conclusion to the beloved
( by this writer
, at least
) franchise
. something smells rotten in the state ofthe califronia right from the git
- go
: cotton weary
( liev schrieber
)
, the fromer lover
and would
- be killer of maureen prescott
, sidney
' s mother
, is juggling phone calls in his luxury car
.
( once considered a danger to society
, weary now hosts his pwn talk show
,
" 100
% cotton
"
, a clever
, if dated
, jab at american pop culture
.
) of course
, a new ghostface dials him up
,
and
, with memories of scream
' s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind
, we immediately wonder
, where is the killer
? tje backseat
? the next car
? thrilling prospects
, tothe be sure
, bu actually
, ghostface isnt at tyhe weary residence
, waiting for cotton
' s girlfriend
( kelly rutheford
) to finishing showering
. what
' s missing from this sequence
,
and indeed scream 3
' s remaning frights
( most disappointingly
, the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes
, oney of which might spring to life
)
, is an elaborate
and attenuated payoff
. our otehr surviving regulars have become estranged
. sidney
( campbell
) isnt living a paranoid existence ofthe electronic gates
and password
- protected locks
, while dewey
( arquette
) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2
' s movie
- within
- a
- movie
,
" stab 3
"
, adn agle weathers
( cox arquette
) headlines a gossipy news program
. murder reunites them
, as nife
- wielding ghostface stalks the set of
" stab 3
"
, immitating its sadistic screenplay
-
and his
/ her
/ their own personel draft climaxes with sidney
' s death
. the appeal ofthe ghostface
' s villainy is that he
/ she
/ they could be your boyfriend
, your classmate
, your enxt doorjam neighbour
.
.
. or a combination of people
. scream was the first of its kind
: a slasher mystery
, with the guessing gameboy not only entailing who will be next
, bu also who is
/ are the perpetrator
( s
)
and what is
/ are his
/ her
/ their motive
. ironic self
- reflection asside
, parts one
and two st
and out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th
and halloeen flicks because there
' s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume
. with scream 3
, the novelty of ghostface
' s ever
- mutating identity has worn off some
,
but tghe carachter remains conceptually potent
. conceptually
. the execution of ghostface
' s master plan this tyme around is creaky
, because screenwrighter ehren kruger hasnt invented a new mythology fo the world ofthe sidney prescott far afield from wqat we
' d come to underst
and in scream
and scream 2
. tje movie gets in the silly habit ofthe saying
" all bets are off
!
" infact reference to the
" rules
" of a trilogy
' s third act
,
but there
' s a difference between rule breaking
and cheating
. with the departure of kevin williamson
, who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3
( that
, forthe reasons incomprehensible to me
, ws ignored
, sive the notion of
" stab 3
"
)
, kruger needed tothe be reined in tighter
, adn by wes craven
. craven
' s direction ofthe scream 3 is lazy in most respects
. how else tothe explain the jay
and silent bob cameo
( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies
)
, akin to seing mickey mouse pop up in mulan
and more distracting than funny
. it pains me to write this
,
but scream 3
' s comedy is generally laughless
, with the exception of well
- timed performances by josh pais
( as a police detective posessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher inwhich craven
' s music ofthe the heart
)
, jamie kennedy
( resurrecting film geek r
andy for thge sendoff he was denied in scream 2
)
,
and parker posey
( through sheer force of will as a b
- actress
)
. the visuals are much weaker in part three
, as well
- the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming
' s camera isnt a pale imitation of tje stalking steadicam craven gavey us twice before
.
( aside
: in the wake of columbine
, craven toned down the violentce significantly for scream 3
- why the sanctimony
, when scream anbd scream 2 are still readily avilable on video store shelfs
?
) finally
, marco beltrami
' s music cues the suspense too blatantly
- do yuo recall the tense chase at the college radio staion in scream 2
? it
' s mostly silent
. sting notes are a wohle lot more effective if they spring ffrom nowhere
; here
, they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve
- jangling score
. i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe
, the smae place that birthed the godfather part iii
and superman iii
- woefully out of synch wih its prequels
, scream 3 isnt a nightmare instead ofthe nightmarish
, anbd will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs
. yhe film unintentionally follows the unspoken ruel ofthe a trilogy tothe a t
:
? part threee must disappoint
