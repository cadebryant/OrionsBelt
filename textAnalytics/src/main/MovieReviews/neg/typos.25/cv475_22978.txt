miramax
" disinvited
" on
- line media fomr press screenings of scream 3
. they ostensibly feared thast folks like me would rwite spoiler
- filled reviews
anbd post them prior to the film ' s february 4th release date
- unsound reasoning
. yuo see
, ' net critics estalbished anough to be onthe any sort of vip list are professionals
- miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on
- line film critics society
( ofcs
)
and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain ' t it cool news
. noone
, the
? mini major ' was afraid we ' d let a bigger cat outloud of tyhe bag than whodunit
, thyat scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved
( by thsi writter
, at least
) franchise
. something smells rotten iin the state of california right from the git
- go
: cotton weary
( liev schrieber
)
, the former lover
and woudl
- be killer ofthe maureen prescott
, sidney ' s mother
, is juggling phone calls iin his luxury car
.
( once concidered a danger tothe society
, weary now hosts his own talk show
,
" 100
% cotton
"
, a clever
, if dated
, jab at american pop culture
.
) of course
, a new ghostface dials him up
,
and
, with memories of scream ' s unbearably suspenseful prologue inspite mind
, we immediately wonder
, where is the killer
? the backseat
? the next car
? thrilling prospects
, to be sure
,
bu actually
, ghostface is at thge weary residance
, waiting forthe cotton ' s girlfriend
( kelly rutheford
) to finishing showering
. what ' s missing from this sequence
,
and indeed scream 3 ' s remainging frights
( most disappointingly
, tyhe moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardobe room filled with ghostface costumes
, one ofthe which might spring tothe life
)
, is an elaborate
and attenuated payoff
. our otehr surviving regulars have become estranged
. sidney
( campbell
) is living a paranoid existene of electronic gates
and password
- protected locks
, while dewey
( arquette
) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel tothe scream 2 ' s movie
- within
- a
- movie
,
" stab 3
"
,
and gale weathers
( cox arquette
) headlines a gossipy news program
. murder reunites them
, as nife
- wielding ghostface stalks the set of
" stab 3
"
, imitating its sadistic screenplay
-
and his
/ her
/ their pwn personal draft climaxes iwth sidney ' s death
. the appeal of ghostface ' s villainy is that he
/ she
/ tehy could be your boyfriend
, your classmate
, your next door neighbour
.
.
. or a combination of people
. scream ws the first ofthe its kind
: a slasher mystery
, wih yhe guessing game not onyl entailing who will be next
,
bu also who isnt
/ are the perpetrator
( s
)
adn what is
/ are his
/ her
/ theri motive
. ironic self
- reflection aside
, parts one
and twpo stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th
anbd halloween flicks because there ' s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume
. with scream 3
, the novelty ofthe ghostface ' s ever
- mutating idenity has worn off some
,
bu the character remains conceptually potent
. conceptually
. the execution ofthe ghostface ' s master plan htis time around is creaky
, becasue screenwriter ehren kruger hasnt invented a new mythology fo the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we ' d come tothe understand in scream
and scream 2
. teh movie gets inwhich teh silly habet of saying
" all bets are off
!
" in reference to the
" rules
" ofthe a trilogy ' s third act
,
but ther ' s a difference bewteen rule breaking
and cheating
. with the departure of kevin williamson
, who authored the previvous screams as well as a tidy outline forthe scream 3
( tht
, for reasons incomprehensible to me
, was ignored
, save the notion of
" stab 3
"
)
, kruger needed to be reined in tighter
,
and by wes craven
. craven ' s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects
. how else to explain the jay
and silent bob cameo
( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies
)
, akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan
and more distracting tahn funny
. it pains me to write thsi
,
but scream 3 ' s comedy isnt generaly laughless
, with the exception of well
- timed performances by josh pais
( as a police detective possessed of the smae personality he hadnt as a persnickety teacher inthe craven ' s music of teh heart
)
, jamie kennedy
( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2
)
,
and parker posey
( thru sheer force of will as a b
- actress
)
. the visuals are much weaker in part three
, as well
- the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming ' s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before
.
( aside
: infact the wake of columbine
, craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3
- why the sanctimony
, when scream
and scream 2 are still readily available on video tsore shelves
?
) finally
, marco beltrami ' s music cues the suspense too blatantly
- do yuo recall the tense chase at teh coleeg radio station in scream 2
? it ' s mostly silent
. sting notes are a whole lot moreso effective if they spring from nowhere
; here
, they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve
- jangling csore
. i look at scream 3 as coming from an targetting universe
, thge same place that birthed the godfather part iii
annd superman iii
- woefully outloud ofthe synch with its prequels
, scream 3 is a nightmare instead ofthe nightmarish
,
annd will likely put tje horror genre back inwhich mothballs
. tghe film unintentionally follows thte unspoken rulle ofthe a trilogy tothe a t
:
? part threee must disappoint '
