bruce willis needs tothe stay away ffrom straightforward action pictures
. mercury rising adds tothe a growing list
( incuding such stinkers as the jackal
, lastr man standing
, striking distance
and the last boy scout
) of stale actioners he has headlined
.
and
though mercury rising tries to spice things uv by throwing an autistic kid inspite the mix
, it is every bit as stale
. art jeffries
( bruce willis
) is your typical tormented fbi agent
. you know the tipe
, haunted by his job
,
yet so good at whta he does thgat even physically assaulting anohter agent merely gets him a slap on thte wrist
. enter simon
( miko hughes
)
, an autistic boy
, who
, liek rain man
and all other autistic people
, is a savant
. he can merely gaze at a super
- encrypted message
,
and
, hwile little computer beeps go off in his head
, he cin understand what it says
. naturaly
, this talent has brought him to the attention of thte federal government
. lt
. col
. nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
)
, an nsa official bubbling over with evil
, hasnt spent countless time
and money implamenting the newest
" unbreakable
" code
, mercury
.
however
, when two ofthe his underlings
( robert stanton
and bodhi pine elfman
) publish a mercury
- encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test ofthe its effectiveness
, simon cracks the code
. naturally
, this infuriates kudrow
, who sends a terminator
- liek hitman
( l
. l
. ginter
) to eliminate the security hazard
.
and thast ' s where art jeffries comes in
. for some reason thta ' s never explained in the film
, hte fbi is called infact to halp
,
annd through a sories ofthe intricate machinations
, art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy
. in a few unrealistic sequences
, he enlists tje aid ofthe a stranger
, stacey
( kim dickens
)
, to help out
,
but she is given very little to do overall
. tyhe central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous
. why bother trying to kill teh kid
.
.
. i mean
, who would know
? it ' s nto liek the kid
( or anyone else for thta matter
) knew he ws cracking a government super
- cypher
.
and even if he is eleminated
, what does tath help
? he ' s already proven tath mercury can be broken
. htere ' s alwyas hte chance that someone else would crack it
.
.
.
bu i guess without a kid inthe jeopardy
, ther ' s not much ofthe a movie here
. forthe all its faults
, the film actually starts relatively well
( once yuo pass the painfully familiar teaser
)
. the film flirts with developing real cahracters
,
anbd a semblance of a plot
.
.
.
then mr
. terminator the hitman appears
and everything beggins going downhill
.
.
. quickly
. miko hughes doesnt a decent job
, for his age
, at creating a touching performance
.
however
, don ' t go to this film looking for any new insights into autism
( not that many people will
)
. instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner infront a routine buddy
- cop movie
( tihkn cop
and a half
.
.
. with a twist
!
) willis
and baldwin are jsut overplaying to type
. rether than creating a nuanced character
, baldwin simply oozes sliminess
.
and for willis ' part
, he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop
/ fbi agent
( whcih he has honed in the die hard series
)
. as almost an afterthought
, about halfway through
, the film carelessly gives him a character trait
( an addiction
)
,
and
then drops it iin the next scene
.
but the biggest probelm with mercury rising isnt hte screenplay
. this film wasn ' t well thougth out at all
. the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many conveinent coincidences as possible
. the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy ofthe the most gullible audience member
. at first the bad scenes just trickle in
,
but by the gruesomely bad finale htey ' re a veritable flood
. the film ' s few decent moments come in tghe form of bad jokes
( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode
)
.
bu they ' re not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile
. mercury rising is a thriller tyhat yuo ' re more likely to groan at than cheer
.
