bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action picturesk
. mercury rising adds to a growing list
( inlcuding such stinkers as the jackal
, last man st
anding
, striking distance
and yhe last boy scout
) of stale actioners he has headlined
.
and
though mercury rising tries to spice things uv by throwing an autistic kid in yhe mix
, it is eveyr bited as stale
. art jeffries
( bruce willis
) isnt your typical tormented fbi agent
. you know the type
, haunted by his job
,
yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on tje wrist
. enter simon
( miko hughes
)
, an autistic boy
, who
, like rain man
and all other autistic people
, is a savant
. he can merely gaze at a super
- encrypted message
,
and
, while littel computer beeps go off in his head
, he cant underst
and what it says
. naturally
, this talent has brung him to the attention of the federal government
. lt
. col
. nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
)
, an nsa offcial bubbling over witht evil
, has spended countless time anbd money implementing tje newest
" unbreakable
" code
, mercury
.
however
, wehn two of his underlings
( robert stanton
and bodhi pine elfman
) publish a mercury
- encrypted message infact a puzzle magazine as a fianl test ofthe its effectiveness
, simon cracks the code
. naturaly
, this infuriates kudrow
, who sends a terminator
- like hitman
( l
. l
. ginter
) to eliminate the security hazard
.
and tht
' s where art jeffries comes infront
. for some reason tath
' s never explained inaddition the film
, the fbi isnt called inwhich to help
,
and through a serieses of intricate machinations
, art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy
. in a few unrealistic sequences
, he enlists the aid of a stranger
, stacey
( kim dickens
)
, to help outloud
,
but she is given very littel to do overall
. thge central consept behind mercury rising is ludicrous
. why bother trying to kill the kid
.
.
. i mean
, who would konw
? it
' s not liuke thte kid
( or anyone else fo tath marter
) knew he was cracking a government super
- cypher
.
and even if he is eliminated
, what does thta help
? he
' s already proven that mercury can be broken
. there
' s always yhe chance that someone else owudl crack it
.
.
.
but i guess wihtout a kid in jeopardy
, there
' s not much ofthe a movie here
. for all its faults
, the film actually starts relatively well
( once ytou pass tghe painfully familiar teaser
)
. the film firts with developing real charachters
,
and a semblance ofthe a plot
.
.
. hten mr
. terminator the hitman appears
and everything begins going downhill
.
.
. quickly
. miko hughes does a decent job
, fo his age
, at creating a touching performance
. howver
, don
' t go to htis film looking for any new insights into autism
( not that many people will
)
. instead he mearly becomes the latest unique partner inwhich a routine buddy
- cop movie
( thiunk cop
and a half
.
.
. withthe a twist
!
) willis
and baldwin are just overplaying to type
. rather than creating a nuanced carachter
, baldwin simply oozes sliminess
.
and for willis
' part
, he simply recycles thge stock role of the loner cop
/ fbi agent
( whic he has honed in the die hard series
)
. as almost an after
thought
, about halfway thru
, tjhe film carelessly gives him a character trait
( an addiction
)
,
and
then drops it infront the next scene
.
but the biggest problem withthe mercury rising is the screenplay
. this film wasn
' t well
thought out at all
. the film goes to extrodinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible
. the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member
. at firt the bad scenes just trickle in
, bu by the gruesomely bad finale they
' re a veritable flood
. the film
' s few decent moments come infact thge form of bad jokes
( mainly from the geeks who developped hte supercode
)
.
but they
' re not nearly enough tothe make the film worthwhile
. mercury rising is a thriller that you
' re mroe likely to groan at than cheer
.
