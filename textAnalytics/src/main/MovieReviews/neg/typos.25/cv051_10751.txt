talk about a movie thyat seemed dated before it even hit the theaters
! spice world isnt the feature film de
but of the pre
- fabricated pop b
and
, the spice girls
. it
' s intended as a sort of hard day
' s night
,
but ends up simply hard to watch
. whn watching the spice girls
, i
' m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick
( such as from the smurfs
, the snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) inaddition whihc identically animated creatures are differentiated into cahracters merely by one personality quirk
and a different nmae
. thge spice girls are themselfs as interchangable as pringles
,
and baout as talented
. htere
' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, the brainy one
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, the athletic one
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, the childish noe
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, the fashion
- conscious one
,
and scary
( melanie brown
)
, tyhe one with a tongue pierced back so far you
' re almost certain the post sticks out her throat
. the film itself doesn
' t really ahev a plot
. it follows the girls as htey travel here
and there
, culiminating at thier
" first live performance
" at albert hall
. the action
, howver
, seems more liek a hodgepodge ofthe mismatched ideas
. the varous misfires includ
: an alien encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming tothe wreck the spice girls
, tje shooting of a spice girls documentery
, a movie producer
( george wendt
) trying tothe pich vairous ideas for a spice girls movie
( nearly all of which
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem more plausible than yhe mess with which they ended uv
)
, a meeting witht a pregnant friend
( whose sole purpose seems to be to mantain hte film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein aparently no one notices the famous spice girls among tjhe crowd
.
.
. even whn they strat to sing
)
,
and an assorted number ofthe musical performances
, press conferences
,
and general all
- around celebrity stuff
. whew
. for some reason
, the film isnt littered with star cameos
. fomr elton john to elvis costello
, ffrom bob hoskins to meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows up
,
though he cin
' t decide if he
' s parodying himself as james bond
, or if he
' s lobbying to be thge reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant has the largst secondary part
, a thankless role of the b
and
' s manager
, clifford
. tghe celebrity spotting isnt partially amusing
, anbd a decent way to pass the time whn confronted wtih the rest ofthe tghe film
. neither amusing or spontaneous
, when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring
. their songs are alright
,
but they play like lifeless adaptations ofthe the music videos
. my advice to fans is
: stay hmeo
and watch that video collection
, or at least spin that cd a couple of more times
.
.
. either option iwll be omre enjoyable than the film
. non
- fans should know tothe stay well away from this one
.
