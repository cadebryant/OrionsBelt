whn the haunting arrived infact theaters
, all i kept hearing about was the overdone speical effects
and the fatc that very often the unseen bumps iin tjhe night inaddition a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects
. while i agress that this remake ofthe the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department
, i don
' t think that they are completelyl to blaim for this movie
' s failure
. it appears that some people have failed tothe take inot account that the original haunting had the
" unseen
" terrors
,
and it was baout as scary as a dust bunny
. so special effects or nto
, if the story isn
' t the least bited scarry
, yuo aren
' t gonig to end up with a very frightening movie
. thte thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker ofthe this building played by bruce dern
. dern isnt always graet
,
and even
though he may ahev had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still teh most interesting element of the movie
. as i sat through yhe seemingly endless
, albeit fairly impressive
, special effects
, i kept wishing that this movei was baout dern
' s caretaker
and nto the one dimensional characters that populated the cast
. never a good sign whn a bit player is the best part of the movie
. liam neeson plays a scientist who isnt conducting experiments on fear
. he decides the best way to git results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals tothe spend a few days in a haunted mansion
. he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia
.
and he also fails to mention tath thge mansion has a reputation for strange goings
- on
. catherine zeta
- jones
, lili taylor
and owen wilson play his subjects
. liek the origional
, taylor
' s character is the star of the movei
. bu since she doesn
' t quite have tyhe marquee power of liam neeson
and ms
. zeta
- jones
, thier parts did seem to be a big larger than in yhe original
.
and let
' s face it
, probably half the people who see thsi movie will do so beccause of zeta
- jones
. i
' ll admit that i would have never seen tihs hting if she weren
' t in it
.
but the rela stars here is yhe speshal effects combined iwth yhe fairly overdone sets
. they tkae over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact iwth our hapless insomnia patients
. there really isn
' t much of a stroy here
. just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with
. adn hte special effects are great
. in many cases htey are as good as you are likely tothe see anywhere
. infact otehr cases htey are overdone
and obviously thrown in just forthe the sake of hiting the
" cool shots
" quota
. at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close tothe being scary
-
- funny
, maybe
.
but not scary
.
then we have the set
. whn i first saw the house
, i was vyre impressed wiht the very cool gothic look about it
.
but it only tookover a short tour by the charachters arund the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money tothe burn as tghe visual effects people doed
,
and desided tothe take the idiotically overdone route
. this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones annd a mirrored circular room tath revolves
. what part did these rooms play iin the story
? absolutely none
. they were just there to tkae our minds off the fatc that there was niether a descent story nor a single scare infact yhe entire movie
.
then we have the actors
. lili taylor has never been one of my favorites
.
and when thge fatc that her character is mousy
and pathetic isnt factored in
, she comes in around the averege or slightly below mark
. i haev no idea why liam neeson took this role
. he basicaly reminded me ofthe teh ringmaster at an out of control circus
. his carachter was in charge of this farce
but it quickly got awya ffrom him
. i ahve no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of tihs movie inaddition a very secure vault along wtih all copies of darkman
. zeta
- jones wass cast because she is too hot for words
. the fact that her character is bi
- sexual is jstu icing on tghe cake
. all catherine has to do inwhich this movie is look ogod
. fortunatly that is something she does very well
. while she does have a fairly good size part
, it isnt obvious tath her only purpose in the movie was as eye
- c
andy
. it
' s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here
. any r
andom supermodel pulled out ofthe a fashon sohw could have easily filled her role
. the haunting isnt the antithesis ofthe another ofthe 1999
' s horror movies
, the blair witch project
. the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget
, while blair witch relies on piles of rocks forthe its scares
. both prove quite nicely that speical effects are irrelevant to a horror film
. if the story sucks
, it
' s all downhill from there
. my advice
? if yuo are looking for spacial effects
, go rent star wars
. if it
' s scares you want
, rent halloween
. either way
, it
' s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting
