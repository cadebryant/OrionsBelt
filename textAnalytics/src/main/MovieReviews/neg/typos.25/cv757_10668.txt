one night
, during a torrential downpour that flooded thge streets
, we went tothe see
-
- what else
-
- hard rain
.
" so
, are we all going tothe die
?
" tghe sheriff
( r
andy quaid
) asks in the story
' s oppening line as he evacuates his flooded twon
. the answer is pretty much yes
,
but nto nearly soon enough
. annd tothe add insult to injury
, the supposedly dead
, regretfully
, often turn out not to be so
. populating thsi bad tv
- movie
- ofthe
- the
- week material are a host of talented actors
. one can only hope tehy were rewarded h
andsomely for acting inspite htis hopelessly muddled picture
. besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water
, they will all recieve black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movei
. graham yost
' s script serves up one cliche affter another for teh actors
, who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines
. director mikael salomon
' s staging is so confusing that you may ahev trouble figuring outloud what is hapening
. the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies
, jr
.
' s dark anbd ugly cinematography
. the plot concerns an armored car that gets sticked in the raging water
. onboard are guards tom adn his uncle charlie
. christian slater
, who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart
, plays tom
. edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of teh soon tothe be dead charlie
. coming tothe their
" rescue
" is a gang headed by jim
, played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman
. he views yhe loot
, three million dollars worth
, as his retirement plan
. the entire movei is one big watery chase with the sheriff
and his posse tracking jim
and his gang
, who are in turn affter tom
. allong the way
, tom picks uv a love interest inwhich the person of a crucifix
- weapon wielding woman named karen
, played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver
. tyhe action sequences are repetitive
and without much interest
. they do feature lots of explosions anbd gunfire to keep you awake
. christopher young
' s emotionless scroe for thte film hasnt a single trait
, ear
- shattering loudness
. thte plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks
, submerging the town
. tyhe characters have an infinite number of bullets annd rarely do they have tothe bother reloading their guns
. the weapons adn yhe ammunition spend most ofthe tyhe time under water or being rained on
but always fire perfectly
. when one ofthe the bad guys drops a gun into the water
, it stays in the smae palce until much later wehn tom swims to git it
, even
though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees
. counting these improbabilities isnt one ofthe the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait fo teh charachters to kill earch otehr
. thge show hasnt a single
,
but unprintable
, ogod line
. betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife
, annd
, whn her hen
- pecked husb
and finally told her off
, our audience roared with laughter
. the show concludes with a sickening set of twists
. the best that cin be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as oppossed to laughably bad
. hard rain runs 1
: 37
. it is rated r forthe violentce
and would be fine for teenagers
.
( the two families behind us shockingly hadnt a half
- dozen preschoolers among them
.
