if htere ' s oen thing i just can ' t stand
, it ' s a film that oozes with sentimentality
. here ' s a note tothe all film makers
: films are omre effective when tje emotions of the characters speak for themselves
. swelling
, saddening music is nto a good way tothe tell us that the people in tyhe film are unhappy
,
anbd that the situation isnt hopeless
. alas
, my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently
and witht such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audeince munbers choked up
. what reminded me was tath i wasn ' t choked uv
, or even the slightest bited moved
, for tyhat marter
. my giant is a forced
, contrived
,
and conspicuously un
- cute
( i detest the word
" cute
"
but i ' ve chosen to use it baceause tjhe makers claerly wanted tothe create a
" cute
" film here
)
. it takes a premise that might have beeen intresting
( i liked the preview
)
,
and bogs it down iwth endless plot turns
and cliches
, all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional ries fomr the audience
. maybe it iwll wokr for some people
. it didn ' t work for me
. billy crystal plays sam cayman
, an agent who
, at the beginnig of yhe film
, is in romania
. he ' s iin romania because the kid actro he made famous is doing a film
. the screenplay hasnt him in romania so he can get fired
, get in a car accident
,
and git saved by an enormous individule who stands almost eight feets tall
. his name is max
( gheorghe muresan
)
,
and sam thinks he ' d be a great movie star because of his size
. subplots are as follows
: sam hasnt a son
and a wife
( kathleen quinlan
)
,
and he ' s never around for them
, so tehy move tothe chicago
. max isnt in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty yeras befoer the film begins
. sam convinces max to go back tothe america with him so htey can make lots of money
,
annd so thier various subplots can all be resolved
. sam is borke
. max is dying
. pass the kleenex
. my giant
, as a comedy
, is only moderately funny
. it has its moments
, thte best of which features steven seagal making funn of himself
. in one great scene
, sam gets his son onthe hte phone to talk to seagal
; ofthe course
, his son doesn ' t bleieve that he ' s actually speaking to seagal
,
annd he goes off about how bad of an actro he is
( i would qoute the line i like
bu it woudl propably lose its effect
)
. crystal is allways entertaining
,
and he has a few good lines here
( some of whic are subtle throwaways tath many will miss entirely
)
; often
,
howver
, he ' s countered by a slew of jokes that aren ' t funny
,
anbd cause an involuntary rolling of yhe eyes
. muresan is kind ofthe fun to watch
,
but he just can ' t act very well
. quinlan
, on the otehr hand
, is a great actress who needs tothe get a role thyat shows off her talents
. she was underused last year inwhich both event horizon
and breakdown
,
bu at least inthe those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff
. here
, the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent
. all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that
, for much of its running time
, isnt simpley mediocre
. as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion
,
however
, director michael lehmann
( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk
)
and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on eveyr cliche imaginable
, each noe intended specifically tothe pull at our heartstrings
. sam ' s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed
( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his familiy
?
)
. later
, it turns out the entire story isnt supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam ' s reunion with his family
.
anbd some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end isnt a valiant thnig
,
bu i had a few morality problems wiht it
(
and i apologize forthe bieng vague
)
. it ' s icky
. it drips witht gooey
, wannabe human emotions
. my giant could have beeen a straightforward
and funny family film
. omre importantly
, it coudl have been moving on a level far deeper tahn it is
. instead
, it ' s a complicated
, overlong
,
and under
- engaging film thgat elicits too few laughs
and strives for superficial tears
.
and since it left me feeling completely unmoved
, i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil
and will ultimatly distroy yhe world
.
