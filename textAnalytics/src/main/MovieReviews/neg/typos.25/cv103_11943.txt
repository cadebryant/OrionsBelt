if there
' s noe thing i jsut can
' t st
and
, it
' s a film that oozes withthe sentimentality
. here
' s a onot tothe all film makers
: films are moreso effective when the emotions of the charachters speak for themselfs
. swelling
, saddening music is nto a ogod way to tell us tyhat the people in tje film are unhappy
,
and that the situation is hopeless
. alas
, my giant isnt a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently anbd with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked uv
. what reminded me was that i wasn
' t choked up
, or even the slightest bit moved
, for taht matter
. my giant is a forced
, contrived
,
and conspicuously un
- cute
( i detest thte word
" cute
" bu i
' ve chosen tothe use it becuase the makers claerly wnated to create a
" cute
" film here
)
. it tkaes a premise that might have been interesting
( i liked the preview
)
, anbd bogs it down with endless plot turns anbd cliches
, all ofthe whic are intended to get some kind ofthe easy emotional rise from the audience
. maybe it will wrok for smoe people
. it didn
' t work for me
. billy crystal plays sam cayman
, an agent who
, at the beginning of the film
, is inaddition romania
. he
' s iin romania becuase the kid ator he made famous is donig a film
. tghe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired
, get in a car accident
,
and get saved by an enourmous individual who st
ands almost eight feet tall
. his nmae isnt max
( gheorghe muresan
)
, anbd sam thinks he
' d be a great movie star because of his size
. subplots are as follows
: sam has a son
and a wief
( kathleen quinlan
)
, annd he
' s never arround for them
, so they move tothe chicago
. max isnt in lvoe with a woman named lilianna who moved awya from romania twenty years before the film begins
. sam convinces max tothe go back tothe america with him so htey can make lots of money
, anbd so their various subplots can all be resolved
. sam is broke
. max is dying
. pass tjhe kleenex
. my giant
, as a comedy
, is only moderately funny
. it hasnt its moments
, teh best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself
. in one grat scene
, sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal
; of course
, his son doesn
' t bleieve that he
' s actually speaking tothe seagal
,
and he goes off about how bad of an acto he isnt
( i owudl quote the line i liek
but it would probably lose its effect
)
. crystal is always entertaining
,
and he has a fewd good lines here
( some ofthe whihc are subtle throwaways that many wiull miss entirely
)
; oftenly
, howver
, he
' s countered by a slew of jokes that aren
' t funny
,
and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes
. muresan is kind of funn to watch
,
but he just can
' t act vyer well
. quinlan
, on the otehr h
and
, is a great actress who needs tothe get a role that shows off her talents
. she was underused last year in both event horizon
and breakdown
, bu at least infront those films she had moments in which she could show us her stfuf
. here
, the best thnig she gets to do is fake a romanian accent
. all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that
, fo much of its runnung time
, is simply mediocre
. as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion
,
however
, director michael lehmann
( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk
)
and scriptwriter david seltzer pile onthe every cliche imaginable
, each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings
. sam
' s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed
( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship wiht his family
?
)
. later
, it turns out teh entire story isnt supposed to be a graet big metaphor signifying sam
' s reunion with his family
.
and soem peple might think that what sam does for max towords tjhe end is a valiant thnig
,
but i had a few morality problems whith it
(
and i apologize forthe bieng vague
)
. it
' s icky
. it drips with gooey
, wannabe human emotions
. my giant sould have beeen a straightforward adn funny familiy film
. more importantly
, it could have beeen moving on a level far deeper than it is
. instead
, it
' s a complicated
, overlong
,
and under
- engaging film that elicits too few laughs
and strives for superficial tears
. annd since it left me feeling completely unmoved
, i st
and by my position thyat sentimentality is evil adn wiull ultimately destroy the world
.
