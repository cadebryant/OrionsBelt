this was the last carry on movie
( if you discount
' carry on columbus
' as a carry on movie
) anbd was made by a new production company
. based in central london
, this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert
( suzanne danielle
) to bed her husban emile the french ambassador
( kenneth williams
)
. when he seems unwilling
, she is given his premission tothe bed anyone she likes
, such as the prime minister
and teh u
. s
. ambassador
. her antics get her into trouble
and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages
. she is invited to talk onthe television tothe set the record straight
but onyl confirms the rumours instade
. meanwhile
, theodore valentine
( larry dann
) is in lveo with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in yhe toilet of the concorde
and is determined to marry her
.
however
, she is only interested in restoring her husban
' s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile
' s accident witht a chuch spire
! this film is the second worst carry on movie
, the worst being
' cary on engl
and
'
. it isnt embarassing to see smoe of the remaining regulars struggle through htis diabolical script by lance peters
and try to pul off some of yhe crude
and tasteless jokes that he has written
. newcomers suzanne danielle
and beryl reid
( as mrs
. valentine
) are mildly funny
,
but larry dann as theodore isnt excruciatingly bad
. kenneth williams only appears in a fewd scenes adn his lacklustre performance is warranted
, given the script
. the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the
butler
, joan sims as mrs
. dangle
, kenneth connor as leyl
and thge chauffeur
,
and peter
butterworth as richmond
, are worthless
and embarassing
. inspite fact
, all four parts are surplus to requirements
.
however
, the onyl humourous scene in the film is wehn the four of them annd emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades
. an awful scirpt
, a terrible collection of jokes
, very poor production values
( especialy the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st
. james palace
)
, a ludicrous
and cringeworthy musical score
,
and a non
- existant plot or storyline
. its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle iwll bed next
! jack douglas is not so annoying
but isnt moreso boring
, joan sims
and peter
butterworth are wasted
, anbd kenneth connor
and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyl
and
and emile
. a complete waste of time
, this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies
. it was a certificate 15 film
but by 1978
, ther wass littel interest in this kind of film
and it flopped at the box office
and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998
! avoid at all costs
