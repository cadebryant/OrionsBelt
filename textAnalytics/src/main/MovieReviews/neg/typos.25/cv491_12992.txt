at one point in this movie there isnt a staging of an opera thast goes completely wrong
. bu noe memeber of the crowd st
ands uv
and cheers
, thinking the performance ws planned
,
and applauding it fo their effords
. thast
' s
" dirty wokr
" in a nutshell
. a very different kind of movie
. this is not a movie that i can easily review
. the criteak in me analyzes the stucture
, plot
, acting
, characters
.
.
.
and tells me this movie is terrable
.
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on hte floor laughing
. this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movei
. it
' s a one note concept
. mitch
and sam need
$ 50000 in order tothe bribe a doctor tothe give their father a heart transplant before otehr more needy patients
. realizing they are very ogod at revenge plots
, htey open a revenge for hire business
, evenhtually running afoul of a rich buisnessman played by christopher macdonald
( who after roles infact
" happy gilmore
"
and
" veronica
' s closet
" seems typcast infront tihs role
)
, who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend
' s gr
andmother
, thus leading them tothe plot against the rich businessman on the niht of tghe gr
and opening of a new opera hous
. frist the critic inspite me
. the plot isnt the st
andard poor guy vs evil rich guy device
, where tghe main character meets thge girl of his dreams along hte way
. here
' s the catch
. none of the characters are sympathetic
. htey
' re all selfish jerks who don
' t care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever htey wnat
. the jokes are juvenile
, crude
, appealing to the worst elements inwhich people
. there
' s jokes baout prostitutes
, the homeless
, beastiality
, anal sex
. there
' s even a subplot that
' s developed
, it seems
, only to mkae jokes about infidelity annd incest
.
and i loved watching it
. i was a huge fan of norm macdonald
' s sarcastic
, tothe
- the
- point comedy onthe saturday night live
,
and this movie is an hour
and a half of it
. norm macdonald takes a joke
, strips it to the core
,
and tells it like it is with a dry wit
. like tje scene weere he
and his friend are learning hte ropes at a new construction job
. the foreman goes over tghe basics
, which mitch anbd sam don
' t underst
and
. how do they get out of it
? by admiting they lied on their resumes
,
and don
' t know a thing about construction
!
and suprise
, they get fired
. yhe characters are incredibly mean
- spirited
. there
' s a father who
' s loud
and obnoxious
, a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father
' s condition by saying
" if i were a gambling man i
' d put a lot ofthe money on death
.
" the businessman cole who always has his dog spunky
,
and does who knows what with it
.
and
then there
' s mitch annd sam
, who
, thikning they can get
$ 50000 by destroying a building
, ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents
.
" too bad we have to dont it
,
" mitch says
. here
' s a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set uv
, where you see eveyr punchline coming
, where eveyr spot profanity could be used
and hten is used
. at least the film isnt honest
,
and makes no misteek that it is anything more than idiotic
.
but at least it isn
' t dull
,
and it isn
' t predictable
.
and that
' s the way it should be
. it
' s sketch comedy
,
and if you
' re a fan of norm macdonald
, you
' ll love it
. the jokes are crude
, the characters are mean tothe the core
, the attitude of the movie is that it jsut doesn
' t care
. if you don
' t like norm macdonald
, or stupid movies
,
then ytou probably won
' t like thsi one
. thge jokes are crude
, thte characters are mean to the core
, the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn
' t care
. so befoer seeing htis oney
, tune your mindset
, anbd prepare forthe a slew of norm macdonald humor
, gay animal sex
, prison rape jokes
, uncaring characters
,
and oney last performance ffrom chris farley
. the criteak in me says
(
*
)
but i give it an 8
(
*
*
*
)
. i just couldn
' t stop laughing
