plot
: two teen couples go to a church party
, drnik
and hten drive
. tehy get into an accident
. one of the guys dies
,
but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life
, annd has nightmares
. what
' s thge deal
? watch the movie
and
" sorta
" find outloud
.
.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movei for thge teen generation that touches on a very cool diea
,
but presents it in a very bad package
. which is wqat makes this review an even harder one tothe write
, since i generally applaud films which attempt to break thge mold
, mess with your head
and such
( lost higway
& memento
)
, bu ther are good
and bad ways ofthe makeing all types of films
,
and these folks just didn
' t snag this one correctly
. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept
,
but exectued it terribly
. so what are the problems witht the movie
? well
, its main problem is that it
' s simply too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
" bu thn downshifts into this
" fantasy
" world in which you
, as an audeince member
, have no idea whta
' s oging on
. ther are dreasm
, there are characters comming bakc from the dead
, ther are others who look liek the dead
, there are strange apparitions
, there are disappearances
, there are a looooot of chase scenes
, htere are tons ofthe weird thnigs thast hapen
, annd most of it is simpley not explained
. now i personally don
' t mind trying tothe unravel a film every now adn
then
,
but whn all it doesnt isnt give me teh same clue over adn over again
, i git kind of fed up after a hwile
, whihc isnt this film
' s biggest problem
. it
' s obviously got this big secret to hide
, bu it seems to want tothe hide it completely until its fianl five minutes
.
and do they make things intertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, inwhich the meantime
? not really
. the sad part isnt that the arrow
and i both dig onthe flicks liek this
, so we actually figured most of it out by the half
- way point
, so all of the strangeness after tath did start to make a little bit of sense
, bu it still didn
' t the make tjhe film all thta more entertaining
. i guess tyhe bottom line with movies like this is that ytou should always make sure thyat the audience is
" inot it
" even before they are given teh secret password to enter your world of underst
anding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller running away fomr visions for baout 20 mintues throughout the movie is just plain lazy
!
! okay
, we get it
.
.
. htere are people chasing her
and we don
' t know who they are
. do we really need to see it over
and over again
? how about giving us different scenes offering further insight inot all of the strangeness going down in the movie
? apparently
, tyhe studio tookover thsi film away from its director
and chopped it up themselves
,
and it shows
. there might
' ve beeen a preety decent teen mind
- fuck movei in here somewhere
,
but i guess
" the suits
" desided that turning it into a music video with little edge
, would make more sense
. the actors are pretty good for tghe most part
, altough wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact smae character that he doed inwhich american beauty
, only in a new neighborhood
.
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller
, who holds her own throughout the entire film
, annd actually has ytou feeling her character
' s unraveling
. overall
, the film doesn
' t stick because it doesn
' t entertain
, it
' s confusing
, it rarley excites
and it fiels pretty redundant for most ofthe its runtime
, despite a pretty cool ending annd explaination to all of hte craziness thyat came befoer it
. oh
,
and by the way
, this is not a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it
' s just packaged tothe look that way because someone isnt apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with yhe kids
. it also wrapped production two eyars ago
and has been sitting on the shelfs ever since
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
! where
' s joblo coming from
? a nightmare of elm street 3
