my giant beigns witht a monologue that

? 90s feel
. i was pleasantly suprized how sharp tghe comedy ws
, whith very funny scenes occurring onthe a movie setted in romania where talent agent sammy
( billy crystal
) is visiting a client
and in yhe monastry where sammy ends up after bieng mysteriously saved wehn he accdientally plunges his car into a stream
.
and when sammy meets max
, his giant
, mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan
, there is magic in the air
; albiet it a bit goofy
, i loved every minute of it
. the film
, ofthe course
, plays onthe the size difference between the two
,
and at times you owudl almost swear it must be special effects
. i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max
- sized chair as the twpo face each over an enourmous tbale annd eat fomr oversized bowls
and spoons
. i also liekd jere burns
'
( from tv
' s
` something so right
'
) performance as the director ofthe the film in romania
. at tihs point
, the primary flaw in the film isnt that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to underst
and
, praticularly druing his fast
- paced frist scene
. it isnt unfortunate that the scirpt requred him tothe speak quickly right out ofthe the gate
, as i did underst
and him more as the film continued
and i became accustomed to his speech
.
however
, about tje time muresan becomes coherent
, the characters head tothe new york anbd thge film takes a dive
. off the high board
. suddenly
, we are expected to believe sammy isnt a dont
- whatever
- it
- takes slime ball
. up nutil htis point he was persuing his own interests to be sure
,
but he didn
' t come off as a desparate jerk
. if he had
, the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted
and magical
.
but nowe
, in new york
, we are further introduced to his neglected wife adn son
,
and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs
. midgets wrestling match
, whcih i found quite unpleasant
and jarring within the framework of the film
. indeed
, many scenes stuck outloud of this film liuke incorrectly placed puzzle pieces
. this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal
, when sammy gets max a role inwhich a big
, hollywood movie filming in las vegas
. hwile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself
, the scenes appeared tothe exsist solely because of his participation
, rather than becuase the film dem
anded it
.
and the audience is required to tkae a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare
. at this point i foudn myself thinking
,
` we
' re supposed to believe that someone would casted htis guy in a film
?
'
then i realized he was
,
and i ws watching it
. in the final third
, the film undergoes another transformation
, this time to unbridled sentimentality
. note
: major plot points are revealed in this
and the final paragraph
. max went tothe america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love
, lillianna
, who hasn
' t seen him since he was a normal
- sized kid
. her refusal tothe see max
( unbeknownst to him
) leads us to an awkward
` ends justify the means
' scene as sammy
' s wief serena
, palyed nicely by kathleen quinlan
, poses as lillianna
. i found tihs scene offensive
. nto only did it rely onthe deception tothe induce warm
, fuzzy feelings from yhe audience
, it reduced max to someone we should pity
and coddle
, which i
thought was quite undeserved
. i thikn max could have h
andeled tjhe truth
, gratuitious illness
and all
. late infact thge film we learn max
,
and in fact all giants
, have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably
. this could be an enlightening revelation
,
but the film seemingly presents it onyl to justify sammy
' s transformation into a caring
, sensitive guy
-
-
and hey
, a great dad
and husb
and
, too
!
` my giant
' suffers from a poorly constructed story line
and undeveloped cahracters whose actions are determined by plot points rather thna their pwn internal persuasions
. a stronger story with more room for character growth might have beeen possible if tje focuse was on max
' s struggle to be accepted
and cast in movies instead of sammy
' s struggles to get money
and become a better person
. in this scenario
, max
' s illness could hvea been a integral part of tyhe film nto a story motivator
. sentiment adn emotion would have followed naturally
. instade
, we
' re apparently not supposed tothe liek sammy until the end
,
but we
' re not allowed tothe focuse on max
. crystal
and muresan give adequate
and at times enjoyable performances
,
but in the end
,
` my giant
' left me feeling like i
' d beeen fed gruel from a giant spoon
.
