' s a concept
-
- jean
- claude van damme gets killed withing the frist ten minutes of the movie
. nowe if that isn
' t enough to get you tothe finally see a van damme movie
, i don
' t know what is
. all sarcasm aside
, it isnt certainly a different way tothe start a movie
, of course a few minutes later we find out that the newely deceased had a twin brother
-
- so lucky us
, we get tothe see omre ofthe jean
- claude
. van damme
# 1 works for the russian masia in the united states
and isnt killed by some of their operatives
. van damme
# 2 isnt a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after
# 1 gets killed in france
. the remaining twin
( teh french cop
) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother
and avenge his death
. once htere
, he hooks up with his deceased brother
' s girlfriend
, played by natasha henstridge
,
and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are
. jean
- claude
' s acting abilities don
' t seem tothe be uv to the usual lackluster st
andards in this movie
. in otehr words
, just in case you missed tje sarcasm
, his acting is worse than normal
. on the upside
, natasha henstridge is inaddition htis film
,
and she does what she did best infront species
-
- she gets naked
. sadly
, this is probably tjhe high point in the movie
. she is actually a decent actress
,
but didn
' t improve as much as i
thought she woudl after species
. thsi is teh typical van damme movei
, iwth jean
- claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents
. nothing newyorker here
,
and certainly nothing we haven
' t seen in every other van damme movie
. simply put
, there isnt absolutely nothing newyorker baout this movie
. it has a retread plot
-
- this isn
' t the first time jean
- claude has played twins
. he still can
' t act
. we all saw natasha
' s breasts in speices
(
al
though this is one repeat performance i
' m not complaining about
)
. this is pretty much like every movie thyat van damme hasnt ever beeen involved inwhich
-
- sub par
.
