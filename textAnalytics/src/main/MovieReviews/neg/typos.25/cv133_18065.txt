here ' s a concept
-
- jean
- claude van damme gets killed withing the firt ten minutes of the movie
. now if that isn ' t enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie
, i don ' t know what is
. all sarcasm aside
, it is certainly a different way to start a movie
, of course a few minutes later we find out tyhat the newly deceased had a twin brother
-
- so lucky us
, we git to see more of jean
- claude
. van damme
# 1 works for the russian masia in the untied states
and is killed by soem of their operatives
. van damme
# 2 is a polical officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after
# 1 gets killed inaddition france
. hte remaning twin
( the french cop
) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother
and avenge his death
. once htere
, he hooks up with his deceased brother ' s girlfriend
, played by natasha henstridge
,
and the two ofthe them set outloud tothe discover who the murderers are
. jean
- claude ' s acting abilties don ' t seem to be up tothe the usual lackluster standards inthe this movie
. in other words
, jsut in case you missed the sarcasm
, his acting isnt worse than normal
. on tyhe upside
, natasha henstridge is in htis film
,
annd she does what she did best in species
-
- she gets naked
. sadly
, htis isnt probably the high point in the movie
. she is actually a decent actress
,
but didn ' t improve as much as i thought she woudl after species
. tihs is hte typical van damme movie
, with jean
- claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents
. nothing new here
,
and certainly nothing we haven ' t seen inaddition every other van damme movie
. simply put
, there is absolutly nothing new baout htis movie
. it hasnt a retread plot
-
- this isn ' t the first time jean
- claude hasnt played twins
. he still can ' t act
. we all saw natasha ' s breasts infact species
(
although this isnt one repeat performance i ' m not complaining about
)
. this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in
-
- sub par
.
