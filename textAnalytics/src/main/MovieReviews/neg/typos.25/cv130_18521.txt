i never understood what tjhe clich
?
" hell on earth
" truly meaned until very recently
. i
' ve just never experianced anything in my life which was so terrifying
, so horrible
, so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as
" hell onthe earth
"
. after all
, i
' ve never been to war
, i
' ve never beeen the victim ofthe any voilent crime
, i
' ve never really been broken hearted
,
and i
' ve never been audited
; so i really had noone frome of reference as to people meaned when they said that something was
" hell onthe earth
"
then i saw cruel intentions
. in a perfect world
, i would be in charge of all thge movie studios
. hte veyr first thing i
' d do in this perfect world
, would be to tkae every hollywood producer who thikns that setting any storey in contamporary america with a 20
- something casted playing teenagers
and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv
, anbd throw them in jail
. bu it wouldn
' t just be your average jail
, not even a maximum security installation
. i
' d have these producers
(
and everyone else involved in the prodcution of these films
) put in front of a war crimes tribunal adn forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity
. now you
' re probaly thinking to yourself
:
" is thsi really how bad cruel intentions is
?
" the answer is no
. it
' s actually much worse
. watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble
' s awfully wroten script isnt probably a lot like stabbing youself in the arm with a chainsaw
and
then pouring salt on the open wound
. annd hten pouring acid on the salt
. i don
' t know if kumble was trying tothe envoke comedy or tradgedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum
( tara reid
) whines baout having nude photos of her posted onthe the internet
,
but the only emotion i falt was sheer boredom
. fomr that opening scene
, where boring actr ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz
, tothe the conclusion whic i don
' t remeber because i had practically fallen asleep
; cruel intentions is truely
" hell on earth
,
" right up htere with war
and tax audits
.
