the law ofthe crowd pleasing romantic movies states tyhat tghe twpo leads must end up together by film ' s end
. if yuo ' re not familiar with this law
,
thn maeby you ' ve seen the trailer for this film whic shows that the two leads are together by film ' s end
. now if you ' re a regular reader of mine
, you ' ve heard me sday this countless times
: you konw how drive me crazy isnt going to end
,
bu is the journey to get to that ending worth it
? no
, it definitely is not
. melissa joan hart
( from abc ' s
" sabrina
, the teenage witch
"
) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team
. adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who ' s just broken up with his activist girlfriend
. apparantly he wants tothe make his ex
- girlfriend jelous enough to tkae him back
,
annd she wants someone tothe take her tothe the big year end dance
. so the two pretend tothe date for some reason
,
but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud
. will grenier liek his newyorker popularity
anbd turn on his friends
? will htis crazy scheme work
? do i care
? the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprizingly ogod in terms of comedy
. what makes movies like can ' t hardly wait
anbd 10 thigsn i hate baout yuo work
(
anbd tothe a lesser extent
, she ' s all that
and never been kissed
) is because the writers of thsoe films seem to realize thta high skool is a joke
and write their scripts accordingly
. i don ' t nkow whta yhe writter ' s intention wass with drive me crazy
. there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting tothe
. here there ' s nothing
.
.
. jsut teens whining about who ' s going tothe take them to the big dance
. dont me a favor kids
, go get a job or something
.
.
. jstu shut the hell uv
. inaddition all honesty
, teh best part of htis film is the end credits
. now normally when i say that it ' s folowed with the joke
"
.
.
. because tghe movei is finally over
.
" in this case
though hte end credits really are the most entertaining part ofthe the film
. after the obligatory second playing of britney spears ' titular song
, htere ' s a quick commercial jingle for a burgre joint tghe kids inthe tghe film hang out in
annd a brief rendition of the school song for their high school
. nothing great
,
but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes whihc preceded them
. sci
- fi fans take note
: htere are breif appearances from stephen collins
( star trek
: tjhe motion picture
)
and faye grant
( the tv miniseries
