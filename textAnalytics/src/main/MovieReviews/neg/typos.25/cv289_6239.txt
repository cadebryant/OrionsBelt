i
' ve heard it called
" jaws with claws
"
and that
' s a fair summation of teh plot
,
though that tag line doesnt little to quantify quality
. directer stephen hopkins
( blown away
, predator 2
) adn screenwriter william goldman
( maverick
, misery
) would have you belieev thgat this is an epic historical drama about man against nature
, based on whta really happened infront africa to the railroad workers trying tothe build a bridge to the 20th century
. they
' ve stacked thge deck with twpo big stars
( val kilmer
, michael douglas
)
, a bigger production design
, beautiful photography
( by acdaemy award winner vilmos zsigmond
)
,
and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king sountrack soudn liuke chamber music
. tjhe movei doesn
' t mkae a lick of sence
,
though
, either as an epic or as your basic boo
- fest
. in fact
, some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that yuo may think you
' ve stumbled into tjhe sequal tothe mistery science theater 3000
: tyhe movie
. how about the three guys with rifles
, who trap a lion adn
then cant
' t even hit thge damned thing
? or the ham
- on
- wry acting ofthe michael douglas
, who chews more scenery than the animals ever do
?
? or
, my favorite
, lions so agile that they cxan even climb onto rooftops
?
