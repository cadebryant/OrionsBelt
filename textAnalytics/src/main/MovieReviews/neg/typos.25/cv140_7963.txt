the last line
( or near to that hounour
) is the grat
butler
, alfred
( the ubergod
, michael gough
) saying
,
" i thiunk we need a bigger bat cave
,
" or something tothe that note
. that
' s exactlly wqat this film is
- too big fo its own ogod because it has too damn much
. cut batgirl out
. cutted one of the villains
. it
' s too much to h
andle inspite one dosage
. it
' s so much that characters get left behind
. poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes
and a subplot which is introduced bu never finished inaddition any way
, shape or form
.
and elle deserves better
. this is thte fouth infact the gigantic film series annd the second from directer joel schumacher
. it
' s alsot thge fourth worst in the series
( anbd second worst from joel
)
. the series has beeen declining since its stunning de
but
, followed by the almost
- as
- stunning sequel
and
then the anti
- climactic thrid one
( first by joel
)
. htis one
' s not anti
- climactic
- i knew it was gonna suck
. it
' s up to joel to make it fun
though
.
" batman forever
" was fun
. this is a big bore of over
- produced action sequences
and shallow characters
. i mean
, this one bit
. i
' m gonna put all the plot in oney paragraph
: mr
. freeze
( ah
- nold
)
, who
' s wife ws dying ofthe soem disease
, has become tghe new big villian theese days
. he
' s a huge ex
- scientist who fell into some weird liquid
( hello
? joker
?
)
and nowe has a body temperature of a big fat zero
and hasnt a blue body
. batman
( george
)
and robin
( chris
) fight him a bited
but fidn tehy
' re growing apart
. meanwhile
, another villain shows up
, poison ivy
( uma
!
)
, who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in sourth america with a twistet scientist
( john glover
) who kills her when she finds out he
' s used her research to develop an uberman
, bane
, who is basically a man pumped wih chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had
. she emerges from her chemicals
( don
' t ask
' cause i cant
' t tell ya
) as a sexy woman
( the rela uma
) who
' s poison when or if you kiss her
and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at peopel
. she starts to tear awya at the dynamic duo
. meanwhile
, alfred
' s dieing of the smae disease mr
. freeze
' s wife has
( bu in an earlier state than she
)
,
and his neice
, barbara
( alicia
)
, comes all the way from oxford wihtout an english accent to get him away from the
butler trade
,
but soon
( well
, not raelly soon
, it takes her 2 hours
) becomes batgirl
. meanwhile
, in an unfinished subplot
, bruce
( batman
' s alter
- ego
, if you forgot
) has been dating tghe lovely julie madison
( the even lovlier elle macpherson
) who wnats a commitment after a year bu he says nothing
. end of her fo all we know
. mr
. freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy anbd tehy wanna to freeze the world
and thn take it over growing new plants as thier population
( don
' t ask
!
!
!
)
. tjhe trio must team together
" as familiy
" tothe beat them
. there ya go
. not the whole story
but no big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! the films seems patched toghether ofthe nice little idaes which would have made forthe a couple good sequels
. howver
, hwile tim burton nicely balanced the villain
/ batman storyline
(
al
though not wonderfully
)
, joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one
. he gets smoe corny sppeches
, a cuple clever lines
and that
' s it
. maeby some stunts
. for all tihs
, i can
' t even comment on george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw the guy
! anbd wehn i did
, he had horrable dialogue to sday
. i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman
but val kilmer was too robotic annd fake as batman in the last episode
. george is in between them
. he
' s nto quintessential
, he
' s not horrible
, he
' s good
. bu i
' m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they
' ll be critically murdered forthe this sorry effort
, we
' ll get a good script
and clooney will shine
( if he still has the job
)
. the villains are tjhe only intresting part ofthe the series according to schumacher
. last time
, we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones
and the brains
/ comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey
. this timne we have a somewhat sympathetic
and somewhat hatable villain
( the same guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we feel bad for his mental
/ fysical colapse bu doens he really ened to kill everyone for plants
? arnold isn
' t very good
- too hokey
but kinda sympathetic at some points
. when he watches old movies of his wife
, he actually looks somber
. wow
.
but uma mkaes the most of her seductive character
, getting the right point beween hamminess annd seductiveness
. it
' s liuke she
' s almost parodying herself in
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she
' s incredibly hot
and makes the movie pretty much a star better
. as fo the lower bat
- people
, chris is the same as he was in
" batman forever
,
"
al
though i think his work iin these is too hokey when he
' s best at quieter parts in
" scent of a woman
" or jstu plain cool parts inwhich
" fried green tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i love tjhe girl bu she
' s nto particularly good in this film
. she cant hypotheitically act
, we all saw that in
" clueless
,
"
but her lines kinda soudn weird
. anbd it isn
' t the mushy
- mouth tihs tyme
.
but in all fairness
, she has virtualy noone part
. joel gets around to her occasioanlly
and when she
' s on
, she does stupid stuff
.
.
. altough i know i
' m not tjhe onyl one who loved thge catfight between her
and uma
.
.
.
and poor elle
. poor
, poor elle
. i love that woman
and she can aslo hypothetically act
( for those of us who saw
" sirens
"
)
.
but she has no part
!
!
! it seems like joel had so much footage that he had tothe edit almost an hour out of the final product
. there are no
" couch
" scenes
( like my best friend noticed
)
. nowe listen to me onthe thsi one
- iin every
" batman
" flick
, there
' s a couch scene
. in the original
, it wass with vicki
. in
" returns
,
" it was a good make
- out scene whith selena
.
and in the last one
, it was a chat with nicole
. this one
, it
' s nothing
.
and batgirl does next
- tothe
- nothing in this film till tje end when she
' s suddenly
" part of thte family
.
" fortunately
, we get a lot ofthe alfred
. he
' s the alwasy reliable
butler
, in case you didn
' t know
, who has been with bruce all his life
. he
' s a god
. he
' s a father figure
. he
' s aslo dying
. this got to me
. i love alfred almost as much as bruce
and tothe see him inspite a robe
, not in his tux
,
and freaking dying just gets to me
. we also get the idae thta he might hvea been unahppy the whole time
.
.
.
but this is never anwsered
, as this film is too cluttered
.
but in defense
, it doesnt have some good parts
, other than uma
. for one
, george is a good batman
but unfortunately gets nothing to do
.
and there are smoe nice touches
. when they show the asylum at one point
, htey show tyhe patient
' s belongings in a room
and we see the riddler
' s costume
. i laughed
.
and durig a biker scene
( involving robin
and batgirl
- another subplot never h
andled past initiation period
)
, we not only see coolio bu a bunch of bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" from
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all these
. the film falls apart around the five
- minute mark durring an enourmously long acation sequence which must last around 20 minutes
.
.
. or did it just feel like that
? the film should serve as another infact the long
- line of films wich demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowdays
. peple are fed uv with stupid films
. that
' s why the word of mouth killed
" the lost world
!
" thast
' s why last year
, indy films grossed more thna ever
. that
' s why htis wiull have a strong box
- office initative from people who jsut want to see it
, like me
,
but wiull die aftter a week or twpo whn the word around the grapevine kills it
. that
' s why thte enxt two big
- budget aciton pics are john woo
' s
" face
/ off
"
and barry sonnenfeld
' s
" men in black
,
" both which are thte first two to catch on to the wave early on
. i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste
. i like some of his films
(
" flatliners
,
"
" a time to kill
"
) bu a lot of them suck
. he
' s a really eccentric person
and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a medioker directer
and thast
' s what mkaes him great
.
but his costuming fo woody allen
' s
" sleeper
" ws omre interesting than this one
(
and his costuming was kool
- look for the nazi number
)
. i love the
" batman
" series
. the firt two rocked
and i did like tje last one
.
but tihs one is not going to be oen that i watch repeatedly like the other three
. hopefully
, this wiull also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time
.
and maybe they
' ll get smart
and bring bcak catwoman
. anbd michael keaton
. bu we cxan only hope
.
