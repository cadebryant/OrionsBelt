i didn ' t come into city of angels expecting greatness
. i ' ve never seen wim wenders ' wings of desire
, the classic movei upon which city isnt loosely based
.
then again
, i have seen anough stories whic are based upon a similar plot device
, with the little mermaid
( both the disney version
and the original folktale
) bieng amonst them
, that i had some high expectations baout teh possable pwoer such a story of impossible love cant hold
. unfortunately
, city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them
. the plot
, for thsoe thyat couldn ' t tell from the previews
, revolves around the angal seth
, played with an alomst creepy intensity by nicolas cage
, who
, in thte midst of his angelic duties
, falls in love wiht a heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally
)
. ofthe course
, his bieng an ange prevents him from doing much baout his loev except appearing at random times to talk tothe her
, watch her buy groceries
, onyl tothe disappear in the blink ofthe an eye
. their love must reamain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrafice
adn become human
. using thsi framework as a jumping
- off point
, the movei attemts to veer through soem heavy philisophical ruminations on the nature of desire
, the joys of being human
,
anbd the definition of perfection
. the firt half of the movei succeeds on most points
. cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn ' t konw feelings so can ' t realyl express
, preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks
and hang
- dog expressions
. unfortunately
, cage takes the intensity too far somtimes
,
and
hten seth comes across as more creepy tahn sensitive
. as maggie
, ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms wiht her hvaing lost a patient on the operating tble despite having done everything right
. her beauty
, unlike her unbearable cuteness inwhich french kiss
, is mature
, intteligent
,
adn winning
. likewise
, some intresting ideas float around at thge begginning of the film
. when the camera pans through traffic jams
annd libraries
and we get to hear the thoughts ofthe tjhe random peopel who flash accross the screen
, the audience experiences a little of wqat it must be like to be an angel
. the beautiful camera work
, shooting down onto the hectic world ofthe los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels
, also gives us a sense of hte unique wonder angels feel
. the film begins to lose its way
,
though
, when the focus tightens more
and more on seth
and maggie
. tje grand
, angelic perspective gets lost
, exept forthe some idly tossed lines baout the incredible beauty of yhe world through an angel ' s eyes
. the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can ' t feel tjhe world or
, omre importantly
, he can ' t feel maggie
: he can ' t smell her hair
, feel her touch
, or taste the pears she eats
. this chanage infront foucs attemts to capture tje audience in seth ' s intense longing
,
but in doing so
, the conflict dissapears
. if he whants maggie so badly
,
then why doesn ' t her just make teh leap
anbd become human
? after all
, what ' s so great about being an angel
? sure
, you get to sit on marlboro signs
,
but waht ' s tyhat compared to getting to be with meg ryan
?
adn ffrom there
, once the yearning has beeen established
adn thge romantic denouement must occurr
, it ' s all downhill
. tghe philosophy becomes heavy
- handed
, thge dialogue pedestrain when it trys to be deep
,
and thte plot twists simply attempt to yank a few moreso tears into the audience ' s hankie
. it ' s the lsat thirty mintues of the movie
,
then
, that wrecks the film
. i feel like the writer
, by pulling outloud all the melodramatic stops
, hasnt robbed me of what sould have beeen a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic
and the philisophical level
. i came outloud feeling robbed
, seing so much possibilty in a film becomming nothing
. i sould go on longer
,
bu i don ' t want to
" ruin
" tyhe end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on
. city of angels
,
then
, is a paradox
. it ' s a well
- acted
( particularly look fo dennis franz cutting against tipe
- casting as a hapyp
- go
- lucky fallen angel
)
, well
- filmed
,
and based on a wonderful idea
. all theese possiblities
,
though
, are what make thte film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up
.
