i didn
' t come inot city of angels expecting greatness
. i
' ve never seen wim wenders
' wings ofthe desire
, the classic movie upon which city is loosely based
.
then agian
, i have seen anough stories which are based upon a silimar plot divice
, with the little mermaid
( both the disney version
and the original folktale
) being among them
, that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a stry ofthe impossible love can hold
. unfortunately
, city of angels ended uv fulfilling fewd of them
. the plot
, for those that couldn
' t tell from the previews
, revolves aroud teh angel seth
, played iwth an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage
, who
, inspite the midst of his angelic duties
, falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since wehn harry met sally
)
. of course
, his bieng an angel prevents him from doign much about his love except appearing at r
andom times tothe talk to her
, watch her buy groceries
, only to disappear in the blink of an eye
. thier love must remane unrequited unless seth decides tothe make the ulitmate sacrafice
and become human
. using this framework as a jumping
- off point
, thte movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire
, the joys of being human
,
and the definition of perfection
. the first half of the movie succeeds on most points
. cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn
' t know feelings so can
' t really express
, preventing the character of seth from getting boring dispite his limited repertoire of intent looks annd hang
- dog expressions
. unfortunately
, cage takes the intensity too far somtimes
, adn
then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive
. as maggie
, ryan manages tothe be convincing as a heart surgeon who hasnt trouble comming tothe terms with her hvaing lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right
. her beauty
, unlike her unbearable cuteness iin french kiss
, is mature
, intelligent
,
and winning
. likewise
, smoe interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film
. when the camera pans through trafic jams
and libraries
and we get to hear the
thoughts of the r
andom people who flash accros hte screen
, thge audience experiences a little of whta it must be like to be an angel
. the beautiful camera work
, shooting down onto the hectic world ofthe los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels
, alsot gives us a sense of thte unique wonder angels feel
. the film begins to lose its way
,
though
, when the foucs tightens more
and mroe on seth
and maggie
. tyhe gr
and
, angelic perspective gets lost
, except for some idly tossed lines about tghe incredible beauty of the world through an angel
' s eyes
. the movei devolves into an examination of how seth can
' t feel tjhe world or
, moreso importantly
, he can
' t efel maggie
: he cant
' t smell her hair
, feel her touch
, or tast the pears she eats
. this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth
' s intense longing
, bu in donig so
, the conflict dissapears
. if he wants maggie so badly
, thn why doesn
' t her just make the leap
and become human
? after all
, wqat
' s so great about being an angel
? sure
, ytou get to sit on marlboro signs
,
but what
' s that compared to getting to be with meg ryan
? annd fomr there
, once the yearning has beeen established
and hte romantic denouement must occur
, it
' s all downhill
. tje philosophy becomes hevy
- h
anded
, the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep
,
and hte plot twists simpley attemp tothe yank a few more tears inot the audience
' s hankie
. it
' s yhe lsat thirty minutes of hte movie
,
then
, that wrecks tyhe film
. i efel like the writer
, by pulling out all the melodramatic stops
, has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience onthe both the romantic
and the philosophical level
. i came out feeling robbed
, seeing so much possibility infact a film becoming nothing
. i could go on longer
,
but i don
' t want to
" ruin
" the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices tje film relies on
. city ofthe angels
, hten
, is a paradox
. it
' s a well
- acted
( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type
- casting as a happy
- go
- lucky fallen angel
)
, well
- filmed
,
and based on a wonderfull idea
. all these possiblities
,
though
, are what make thge film so unredeemable wehn the closing credits come up
.
