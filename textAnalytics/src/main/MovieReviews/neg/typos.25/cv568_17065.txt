reading the casted anbd director for the new mobster comedy
,
" analyze tihs
,
" i asked mysef
,
" how could tihs miss
?
" robert de niro
(
" taxi driver
,
"
" raging bull
"
)
, billy crystal
(
" city slickers
"
)
, lisa kudrow
(
" the opposite of sex
"
)
, anbd director harold ramis
(
" national lampoon
' s vacaiton
"
)
. these are usually reliable filmmakers
( well
, okay
, crystal hasnt been infront a sizable slump lately
)
,
and tellingly
, tghe first half
- hour of
" anlyze this
" was very funny
. unfortunately
, as the running time ticked away
, i began to think that the first thirty minutes had
, unbeknownst to me
, been rewound
and were being replayed another twpo
-
and
- a
- half times
. the film has obtained a clever premise
,
but does not have any idea what to do wiht it as it progressively becomes more anbd more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring baout what wass happening onthe the screen
. middle
- aged psychoanalyst ben sobel
' s
( billy crystal
) life is finally going very well
.
al
though he has never gotten along with his pwn uncaring parents
, especially his father
, who is also a psychiatrist
, ben has an easy
- gogin teenage son
( kyle sabihy
)
and isnt about tothe travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend
, laura
( lisa kudrow
)
. inthe little
but a flash
,
however
, ben suddenly sees his plans ruined whn he accidentally hits the car of the mob
and subsquently gets paide a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti
( robert de niro
)
, who desparately wants counseling
, even
though he himselv won
' t even admited to hvaing anxiety attacks
. ben trys tothe help paul
, mostly so he will get him off his back
,
but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding
, which ends wiht a man dropping eigth stories tothe his death
. it seems to ben that no matter what he doens
, paul vitti will nto go awya
,
and the more they become involved
, the more ben
' s potentially happy life gets into danger
.
" analyze this
" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout
( mostly in the frist half
)
,
but i always had the nagging thougth thyat what director ramis
and writers peter tolan
, ramis
,
and kenneth lonergan had done was thougth ofthe one joke
( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles
, while terrorizing
and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal
)
and
then tiresomely recycled it forthe the duration of the 106
- minute running timne
. admitedly
, de niro is very funny here
(
and i cant
' t remember the last time you could use that adjective tothe describe him
)
,
and crystal is in top
- form
,
but thge hwole movei is weighed down directly on their shoulders iwth nothing eles to support them
, including a substantial plotline
. since
" analyez this
" bills not oen
, nto two
,
but three writers
, you
' d think that they would have been able tothe work together to fix the noticably large flaws
, bu they must haev all been on auto
- pilot
. oney of the most disappointing
and wasted opportunities in the film is the way tyhe movei deals wiht hte supporting characters
, all ofthe which have next to nothing to do
and aren
' t even given multi
- dimensional characters tothe attempt to develop
. coming off ofthe her oscar
- caliber wokr in two of lastr year
' s best films
,
" clockwatchers
"
and
" yhe oposite ofthe sex
,
" lisa kudrow
' s throwaway
" girlfriend
" role is an incredible step down
. sure
, kudrow
' s fellow
" friend
" jennifer aniston did the same thign twpo weeks ago inthe
" office space
,
" bu at least we got to spend a little time whith aniston
. kudrow
, meanwhile
, mostly just st
ands arround
, no dout wondering why she aggreed to appear in this film in the first place
. chazz palminteri
, as rival gangster primo
, fares even worse
, in a role thta plays more like an after
thought than an actuall character
. finaly
, molly shannon
( rising film star adn casted member on
" saturday night live
"
) has a rousingly hillarious one
- scene cameo right at tghe beginning as one of crystal
' s patients anbd
then completely disappears
. too bad
, considering that yhe supporting actors surely have proven tath htey have tje abilities tothe wupport de niro annd crystal
. once
" analyze this
" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow
' s laura st
anding alone at the altar once again
, i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone
,
and had mostly lost respect fo the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most
, ben
. afterwords
, the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of teh depressed paul
, became a real laugh
- free dead
- zone
, losing its lsat remaining comic punches
.
" analyze this
" proves that talent can certainly halp any film out
,
but when the wroten material isn
' t up tothe thier level
, what we are virtually left with isnt a vcauum of thin air
.
