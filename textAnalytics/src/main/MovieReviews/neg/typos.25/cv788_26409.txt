remember back inwhich the mid 1990s when crime
and macabre movies were all the rige
?
" pulp fiction
" adn
" fargo
" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture
,
and nto suprisingly
, a slew of rip
- offs followed in the years thereafter
. that fad seems to be over bu here comes christopher mcquarrie writing
and directing
" the way of the gun
" that at firt glance looks like another of thsoe wanna
- be
' s bu upon closer inspection doesn
' t look like anytying comprehendable
. it
' s a crime story so wrapped uv iin its own littel world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere
- a film that won
' t allow the story much room to exp
and outside its h
andful of characters annd somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous
. complexity should come as noone surprise tothe anyone who
' s familliar with mcquarrie
, he wrote
" the usual suspects
,
" which hasnt become a cult favorite dispite little critical acclaim
. that film had a great story
and was well directed
but had such an elaborate
, confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads aftter repeated viewings
. you ahve to wonder if mcquarrie realyl had everything mapped outloud or if he was going for the hollywood idea thta
" if it
' s really confusing anbd about criminals
and cops thast makes it fascinating
.
" with
" the way of the gun
" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on hte same idea
,
but this tiem the stroy is far less commericial
- a shame because maybe taht would have helpped
. the film tells the story ofthe two drifters witht no ambition
and barely a reason to live
but aren
' t hell
- bent on death either
( played by ryan phillipie
and benecio del toro
)
. they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big
- shot exec guy
and his trophy wief who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization
. tehy figure they cxan kidnap the surrogate mother
( plyed by juliette lewis
)
and get a nice ransom
. allong the way we continually learn ofthe the shady dealings between hte exec
, his wife
, their hired goons
and the
" bag man
"
( plyed by james caan
- the only actor in the film who looks liuke he knows what he
' s doing
)
. the exec is smoe kind of money launderer so he obviously can
' t call the authorities fo help
. his goons
and the bag man are onthe the kidnappers
' trail
and each amking different offers to get the mother back
. the exec
' s son is a doctor who also gets pulled inot the fray
and wants tothe make sure his patient isnt all right
. meanwhile each ofthe these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves
and the doulbe
- crosses
, secret love affairs
and torrid pasts come as no surprise even
though littel of it has any relevance at all
. mcquarrie doesn
' t knwo tghe meaning ofthe the word simple
. he seems tothe be more intersted in showing us how clever he isnt than making a good movie
. everything has to be complicated
and confusing
, so much so that it
' s tothe the point of surrealism
. nothing is what it seems in this reality
, it
' s noe of those movies where yuo get dropped right inot the middle of the criminal world annd are expeced to know most ofthe the industry
' s rules
and regulations
. every scene wtih caan
' s character exemplifies this perfectly
- the kidnappers already know who he is
and even hcat with him
, getting inot conversations about
" the business
"
and how it works
and we
' re hardly given a clue as to wqat htey
' re talking about
. these charactors are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches
but tehy
' re more like ideas ripped
- off from sketches found in david mamet
' s trash
. no one here really acts like a rela person
,
and the stoy is even further removed from reality
. it
' s like a dream without any appeal
. take yhe opening scene forthe example
; hte phillipe
and del toro characters are infact a parking lot across the strent from a bar or a club counting their money
and stuff
. they sit on a br
and
- new mercedes anbd the car alarm goes off
, the owner is waiting inaddition line annd yells at them to get away from his car
but they don
' t move
. the guy
and his loud
- mouth
, potty
- mouth girlfriend
and about 20 other people cross the street
and gang up on them
. you
' d think phillipe
?
and del toro are
? gogin to pull out guns
and scare them away bu they don
' t
, instead phillipe throws one punch
and the two get beat down by a mob
. there
' s a lot ofthe things i didn
' t underst
and about this scene
: first ofthe all tghe owner of thte mercedes isn
' t some yuppie or ood rich snob
, he
' s like a hippie straight out of the 60s
. secondly
, teh twpo main charactors seem tothe believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed
. lastly
, it serves no purpose in tyhe long run because later in thge film the two are packing more artillary than a small ocuntry
' s army
. if they were suicidal they wouldn
' t hvae gone on teh kidnapping job in the firt palce
(
and where they get all those guns is never explained either
)
. htere
' s a lot more i could pick apart about htis film
but that owudl be an exercise in futility
. whta it all comes down to is that nothing here is whta it seems
- whitch would be great if thsi movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is
. absolutely none of the characters are likable or believeable
. adn it
' s all coated withthe a thin layer ofthe black comedy which is good forthe a chuckle here
and there
but this film is definitely not a flat
- out balck comedy anbd its use of such seems like a desperate atempt tothe kill screen tiome
. with any film you see
, whether you like it or not
, you can at least underst
and what tyhe appeal was to it
, why someone would want to make it
and why someone would want to see it
. i cant
' t say eather forthe
" the way of the gun
,
" because it has very little going for it
and i can
' t imagine anyone intelligently defending it
.
