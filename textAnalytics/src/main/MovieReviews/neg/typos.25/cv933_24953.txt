, the sequel to mission impossible
, is a james bond wannabe film
,
but it fails to even cmo close to that film infact witn
, humor
,
and entertainment value
. it tries tothe be a spy
/ romance movei
,
but wihtout any suspense the film just looks like it
' s an extended commercial for dudes who thikn they look cool in throwaway sunglasses
. it is a film that prefers techie gadgets tothe anything human
. the coolest thign about this movie
, was all the holes it had in its story annd tyhe most trite thing about the movie
, was the usage ofthe doves throughout as peace symbols
. tghe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence
. exept for the choreographed acation sequences
, the film was dull for threee
- quarters ofthe its time
, filled with too many dead spots in its stroy to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that devolopped
. as for the action scenes
, htey might look good to thsoe who are converts to violence infact their films
, bu their advertisment for sadistic responses
, isnt nothing short of mindless cartoon voilence
, which makes it very difficult to sit back
and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen
. m
: i
- 2 opens
and closes witht fast
- paced acation scenes
,
but it isnt hard to get past the middle part which just drags onthe in banal dialogue
. the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus
, at that point
. the only thign that kept me awake
, was thte horrable music composed by hans zimmer thta bacame vrey loud at any of thte film
' s supposedly momentous action scenes anbd seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in thge wrong way
. it
' s a mega
- buck film adapted from a popular high
- tech gadgetry tv series
.
but its artistic sucess is an impossible task to accomplish becasue it hired the wrong director annd actors to star in it
, anbd it failed to produce a story that had any substance
. john woo
(
" broken arrow
"
/
" face
/ off
"
) isnt good at doing car chases
, choreographed fights with midair flips anbd kung
- fu kicks
, slo
- mo shots of two guns blazing
, anbd of fire explosions
,
but he just can
' t seem to h
andle dialogue
and suspense
. the star of the film
and co
- producer
, tom cruise
, anbd his rumatic interest
, th
andie newton
, are miscast
. cruise is no james bond
and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair
and innocuous smile
, as he tries to cary off this macho role
, while th
andie is not an action
- film girl
, annd seems like a fish
- outloud
- of
- water inspite this one
. their romance didn
' t owrk
, nto only was it tepid annd not sexy
,
but it wasn
' t convincing
. the film opens with dizzying speed
, perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success
. we wiull be in three diferrent locations instantaneously
: sydney
, hte american southwest
,
and seville
. frist
, we are inthe sydney
, australia
, where a scientist with a muffled russian accent
, dr
. nekhorvich
( rade
)
, mentions thyat he creaeted a deadly killer virus called chimera
and an antidote for it
. he aslo mentions that eveyr hero needs a worthy villian
. which explains tjhe film
' s mythic theme
.
.
. as we enter thte world of comic book myths onthe good annd evil
. the one who played the villian
, dougray scott
, does so in a one
- dimensional gruff tone
, which did not distinguish him inwhich that role
. at least
, if yhe film got tghe villain part right
, it might have had some fun with htis nonsense
. soon hte diabolical scientist is on a plane talking tothe someone he trusts called dimitri
, bu
then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot
and kresh it into the rocky mountains
. before they crash thte plane
and parachute outloud of it
, the oney who was posing as dimitri
, turns out to be sean ambrose
( scott
)
, a rogue memeber of the imf
, which is a cia
- like clone
. he steals the package with thge antidote
, peels off a latex mask
, whihc is a replica of hte hero ofthe the story
, ethan hunt
( cruise
)
, who had posed as dimitri to the scientist befoer
and had thereby gained his trust
. sean
and his gropu of terrorists cary out this attack because htey plan a virus plague on teh world
and
then to sell the victims the antidote at maked up prices
. we allready saw the gimmick ofthe peeling masks utilisied in face
/ off
and in the original mission impossible
, which as convoluted a plot as that film had
, it was still a superior film tothe thsi sequel
. woo has run this peeling mask routine inot the ground
, as it is utilisied so oftenly inwhich this film by both sides
, so much so
, that it blurs any ethical charachter differences between good guy or villain
. it makes it seem as if anyone sould be another charactor
, whlch distorts yhe reality of the film
and makes it impossible fo the film to make much sense
. next we are iin a mountain range in the american southwest
, annd ethan is onthe vacation
, hanging by his fingertips hwile climbing
and looking cool
, whn a helicopter wiht his boss anthony hopkins aboard
, delivers via a rocket launcher
, a pair of tlaking sunglasses
. hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve tje chimera package
and he is alloween to pik two regular imf agents to help
, billy baird
( john polson
)
and luther stickell
( ving rhames
)
, with luther running a high
- gadget computer
, bu he also must git a jewel thieve named nyah hall
( th
andie
) to join his team
. he is told
, as an incentive tothe recruit her
, all her criminal charges wiull be dropped
. hopkins hten signs off with hte tag line
: this message will self
- destruct in five seconds
. actually
, with thte departure of hopkins
, it was this disposable film that atcually self
- destructed at this point
. in seville
, hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle ofthe a jewel heist
and a subsequent car chase
, where he nearly runs her audi sportscar car over the side of a mountain road
. he also falls fo her wehn this was only supposed to be a business dael
,
and lerans that she isnt valuable because her ex
- boyfriend was sean ambrose
and that he still wants tothe f
* ck her
. the imf team
then inject a location traker chip inot her to spot sean so she cin go f
* ck him
, as she leads them to his hide
- out iin the seaside of australia in which he shares withthe his sneering villainous cohort
, the south african
, hugh stamp
( richard roxburgh
)
. robert towne
, the screenwriter
, who contri
buted to the first
" mission
,
" who isnt noted for doing
" chinatown
"
-
- writes a colourless
, pedestrain scirpt
, one taht fails even to be funny in a camp way
. hte terrorists
, who aim tothe rule the world
, are interested iin owning 51 percent in a biotech comapany
and infact getting stock options
, as they plan to infect sydney with the virus
and haev their company sell the anticdote
, insuring that tehy will make billions on the stock
. ethan comes to hte rescue of the world
and of nyah
, whith his only conflict being who is more imporatnt tothe save first
. ethan does tihs rescue against all odds
, as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company
, fight it out with sean
and the other terrorists
,
and rescue nyah
, who injected herself whith tjhe virus to hinder sean
' s getting it
, as hte only way to transport the virus isnt through anohter person or from the vaccine needle
. ethan rescues her by doign stunt riding on a motorcycle
, useing kick
- boxing
, winning a shootout
, throwing a full john wayne suply of grenades at the terrorists
, making some more use out of that peeling mask bit
,
and by being completly fearless annd larger than life
, while he kick
' s everyone
' s ass
. if i wass onyl entertained by this
.
.
. i could have lived iwth it
.
but this film was so badly made
, that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game
, seeing only the slam
- dunks
,
but with the game itself bieng excluded from the telecast
. infact any case
, thsi is a critic
- proof film
,
and wiull in all probability do well infact tje box office
, as it was made to appeal to all yhe demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into
.
