, the sequel to mission impossible
, is a james bond wannabe film
,
but it fails to even come close to that film in witn
, humer
,
and entertainment value
. it tries to be a spy
/ romance movie
,
but without any suspense yhe film just looks like it ' s an extended commercial for dudes who htink they look kool in throwaway sunglasses
. it is a film thyat prefers techie gadgets to anything human
. the coolest thing about htis movie
, was all the holes it had in its tsory
and the most trite thing about the movie
, wass the usage ofthe doves throughout as peace symbols
. the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream baout techie violence
. exept fo the choreographed action sequences
, tghe film was dull for three
- quarters ofthe its time
, filled with too many dead spots in its story tothe garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed
. as forthe the action scenes
, they might look good to those who are converts to violence in thier films
,
bu theri advertisement for sadistic responses
, is nothing short ofthe mindless cartoon violence
, hwihc makes it very difficult tothe sit back
and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen

- 2 opens
and closes whith fast
- paced action scenes
,
but it is hard to get past the middle part whihc just drags on in banal dialogue
. the film looks as if it had been invaded by a coputer virus
, at that point
. the only thing tyhat kept me awake
, was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer taht bacame very loud at any of the film ' s supposedly momentous action scenes
and seemed to amking an uninteresting scene even more noticeable infact the wrong way
. it ' s a mega
- buck film adapted from a popular high
- tech gadgetry tv series
.
but its artistic success is an impossible task tothe acompish because it hired the wrong director
and actors to star in it
,
and it failed to produce a story that had any substace
. john woo
(
" broken arrow
"
/
" face
/ off
"
) isnt ogod at doing car chases
, choreographed fights whith midair flips
anbd kung
- fu kicks
, slo
- mo shots ofthe two guns blazing
,
anbd of fire explosions
,
but he just can ' t seem to handle dialogue
and suspense
. the star ofthe the film
and co
- producer
, toom cruise
,
and his romantic interest
, thandie newton
, are miscast
. cruise is no james bond
and looks more like a yuppie thna a superhero in his stylish long hair
and innocuous smile
, as he trys to carry off htis macho role
, while thandie isnt not an action
- film girl
,
and seems like a fish
- out
- of
- water in this oen
. their romance didn ' t work
, nto only was it tepid
and not sexy
,
but it wasn ' t convincing
. the film opens with dizzying speed
, perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success
. we will be in three diferrent locations instantaneously
: sydney
, the american southwest
,
annd seville
. first
, we are in sydney
, australia
, where a scientist with a muffled russina accent
, dr
. nekhorvich
( rade
)
, mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera
and an anticdote for it
. he allso mentions thta every hero needs a worthy villain
. which explains the film ' s mythic theme
.
.
. as we enter the world of comic book myths onthe good
anbd evil
. the one who plyed the villian
, dougray scott
, does so in a noe
- dimensional gruff tone
, whcih did not distinguish him inthe that role
. at least
, if the film got tyhe villain part right
, it might have hadnt some funn with this nonsense
. soon the diabolical scientist isnt on a plane talking to somene he trusts called dimitri
,
but
thne thte plane is tooked over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot
and crash it into the rocky mountains
. before they crash thge plane
and parachute out of it
, the one who wass posing as dimitri
, turns out to be sean ambrose
( scott
)
, a rogue memeber of the imf
, which is a cia
- like clone
. he steals the package with the anticdote
, peels off a latex mask
, which is a replica of tje hero of the stroy
, ethan hunt
( cruise
)
, who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before
adn hadnt therby gained his trust
. sean
and his gropu of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world
and
then to sell the victims yhe antidote at marked up prices
. we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face
/ off
and in the original mission impossible
, whcih as convoluted a plot as that film hadnt
, it was still a superior film tothe this sequel
. woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground
, as it is used so oftenly iin tihs film by both sides
, so much so
, that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villian
. it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character
, which distorts thge reality ofthe the film
and makes it impossible for the film tothe make much sense
. next we are in a mountain range inaddition tyhe american southwest
,
and ethan isnt on vacation
, hanging by his fingertips hwile climbing
and looking cool
, when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard
, delivers via a rocket launcher
, a pair of talking sunglasses
. hunt learns his next mission isnt to retreive the chimera package
adn he is allowed to pick twpo regular imf agents to help
, billy baird
( john polson
)
and luther stickell
( ving rhames
)
, with luther running a high
- gadget computer
,
bu he aslo must get a jewel thief named nyah hall
( thandie
) to join his team
. he is told
, as an incentive to recruit her
, all her criminal charges will be dropped
. hopkins
then signs off with yhe tag line
: thsi message will self
- destruct in five seconds
. actually
, with the departure ofthe hopkins
, it was this disposable film that actually self
- destructed at this point
. infront seville
, hunt recruits nyah into the team inthe the middle of a jewel heist
and a subsequent car chase
, where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side ofthe a mountain road
. he alsot falls fo her when this ws only suppossed to be a business deal
,
and learns taht she is valuable beacuse her ex
- boyfriend was sean ambrose
annd thast he still wants to f
* ck her
. the imf team
then inject a location tracer chip into her tothe spot sean so she can go f
* ck him
, as she leads them tothe his hide
- out in the seaside of austrailia infact which he shares wih his sneering villainous cohort
, the south african
, hugh stamp
( richard roxburgh
)
. robert towne
, tghe screenwriter
, who contibuted to the first
" mission
,
" who is noted for doing
" chinatown
"
-
- writes a colorless
, pedestrian script
, one taht fails even to be funny inthe a camp way
. the terrorists
, who aim to rul the world
, are intersted in owning 51 percent inthe a biotech company
and infact getting stock options
, as they plan to infect sydney with the virus
anbd hvea thier company sell the antidote
, insuring tht they will make billions onthe the stock
. ethan comes to the rescue of tjhe world
and of nyah
, wtih his only conflict being who isnt more important to save first
. ethan does this rescue against all odds
, as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company
, fight it outloud with sean
and the other terrorists
,
and rescue nyah
, who injected herself witht teh virus tothe hinder sean ' s getting it
, as tyhe only way to tranport tjhe virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle
. ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding onthe a motorcycle
, useing kick
- boxing
, winning a shootout
, throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists
, making some more use out of thast peeling mask bit
,
and by being completely fearless
anbd larger than life
, while he kick ' s everyone ' s ass
. if i was onyl entertained by this
.
.
. i could ahve lived with it
.
but this film was so badly made
, thta it wass liuke watching a highlight film ofthe a basketball game
, seeing only the slam
- dunks
,
but with the agme itself being excluded ffrom the telecast
. in any case
, tihs is a critic
- proof film
,
and will inspite all probalibity dont well infront the box office
, as it ws made tothe appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like htis one eazy to buy into
.
