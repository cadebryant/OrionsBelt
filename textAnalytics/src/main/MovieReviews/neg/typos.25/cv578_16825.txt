its a stupid little movie that trys tothe be clever
and sophisticated
, yot trys a bit too hard
. with teh voices of woody allen
, gene hackman
, jennifer lopez
, sylvester stallone
,
and sharon stone
, this coputer
- animated yak
- fest
( think toy story
[ 1996
] filled with utilisied merch
andising
) is noe for the ant
- eaters
. the main stoyr is the independence of a worker named z
( allen
)
. he wants more to life than just digging away underground fo the colony
. when he finds out about
`
` insectopia
,
" a mythical place where all insects can run free
, z
, along with his colony
' s princess
( stone
)
, journey out into the world to find a meaning fo life
. about 15 minutes into the picture
, i began to wonder what tjhe point of the film was
. halfway through
, i still didn
' t have an answer
. by the end credits
, i jstu gavey up
and ran out
. antz is a mindless mess of poor writing adn even poorer voice
- overs
. allen isnt nonchalant
, while i would have guessed
, if i hadn
' t seen her in the mighty
and basic instinct
, stone can
' t act
, even in a cartoon
. this film is one fo the bugs
: unfunny
and extremely dull
. hey
, a bug
' s life may ahev a ogod tyme doign antz in
