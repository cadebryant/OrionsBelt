8mm isnt not gonig to enlighten your day
. it
' s a dark
, grimy
and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films
and filled with eccessive violence
. nto only do yuo need thte stomach to make it through this bloated mess
, you
' ll recquire a lot of paitience as well
. nicolas cage seems tothe be doing quite a bit of overacting as ofthe late
. he wore a bizzare git
- up anbd did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes
,
and here he attempts a performance thgat cxan relate tothe someone completly losing their grip on reality
. cage plays private investigator tom welles
, praised fo his secrecy annd reliability
. at home
, welles is a familiy man
, with a wife
( catherine keener
)
and a small duaghter tothe tkae care of
. his new assignment is a bazare noe
: the wife ofthe a formally deceased millionaire hasnt hired him tothe solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husb
and
' s safe
. the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl annd a masked man
, until teh girl is brutally murdered
. or so it seems
. welles
, ofthe course
, begins to burrow deeper
and deeper to uncover thge truth
.
and tyhe more he becomes involved in thsi disturbing case
, hte more he gets in over his head
. he hires an adult book stoer clerk named max california
( joaquin pheonix
) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography
. max knows whta welles is getting himself into
,
and explains
,
` you dance wtih teh devil
, the devil don
' t change
. the devil changes you
.
' theese turn out to be very wise words
. 8mm has a premise tyhat begs for a better execution
. the set
- uv isnt slick adn well played
, as cage uncovers the identity of tjhe girl anbd travels tothe hollywood to locate her
. this is where everything goes awry
.
al
though director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us iwth his grotesque portrait of the
` real world
'
, he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to teh formula
. everything about the movie becomes dull annd lifeless
, repelling the viewer like teh effect ofthe bug spray to insects
.
al
though it had enourmous potential
, the thrid act of 8mm is a total bust
, leaving intrigued audiences inspite a baffling state ofthe extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control
. cage is the film
' s sole flame of energy
. his performance isnt actually believable
,
but soon the directer
' s dem
ands strat tothe weigh heavily on his sholder
and he begins stumbling allong in desperation
. still
, you
' ve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he doed
, fo that is no eazy feat when you consider the problems at h
and
. welles
' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker
( played convincingly by peter stormare
) who isnt notorious for thge hardest
- hitting snuff films in thge industry
. this isnt where cage goes over the edge inot a serial killer
- like phase
, inthe whitch he must take revenge on all thsoe who murdered the innocent girl in the film
. he tracks down the masked man responsibile for the killing
( chris bauer
)
, annd they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery
, a fight sequence that owudl look more at home inthe a schwarzenegger movie
. writed by
andrew kevin walker
, 8mm dissipates into a poor man
' s seven
, with all tyhe violentce
but little of teh effectiveness that made yhe latter such a chilling masterpiece
. furthermore
, what hasnt become of joel schumacher
? tyhe director has recently experienced a major drought
, slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop
( batman
and robin
, anyone
?
)
. this putrid thriller is certainly nto going to revive his career
, so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side
.
