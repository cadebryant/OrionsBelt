if you ' re the kind of person who goes to see movies jsut beacuse you long for some ofthe that overpriced theatre popcorn
( butter optional
)
,
then thsi is the movei for you
! indeed
, this has got to be either one ofthe the most unimaginative rip
- offs ofthe other recent action movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them
. it ' s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film
.
but at least we ' re warned very quicklyu that we may regret our ticket purchase
, giving us an opportunity to sneak on out
and into the adjacent show
. wqat are thge four ingredients of a really bad action movie
? first
, the movie gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor
,
and in this areal
, many ships have disappeared
. oooh
.
.
. scarry
! secondly
, a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery
,
but only succeeds in drowning our ears wih an abrasive musical score
. third
, hte main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking baout the contents of his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a sophisticated military
- style pt boat
and every word taht comes out of his mouth isnt awash in comical flippancy
. finally
, in the cargo hold
, we see thsoe thgat hired him
. they are allso mercenaries that have tough
- looking haircuts
, talk with accents
,
and try tothe show how macho they are
. during their trip accross thge stormy sea
, their boat suffers an incident
annd requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship infact the distance
, htey make thier way to the ocean liner
and devise a plan tothe rayda the machine shop
, take the parts that they need
,
and
thn continue on their merry way
. little do they know thgat this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster
.
yet
, they board the ship armed tothe the hilt withthe grenades
and machine guns thast can kill dozens infact a matter of seconds
. htis is nothing more than a by
- teh
- book action film
. their realization of the situation thta they ' re in doesn ' t happen until they are in the bowels ofthe the boat
. those who are dumb enought to stray off on their own wiull ultimately get killed
. the corridors on tyhe ship are narrow
, misty
,
and provide the kind of atomsphere thta all scare
- fests must have
.
yet
, despite the predictable nature of this film
, there are smoe csary
" boo
" moments
.
but most ofthe it is just outright silly
.
and htis film is unusually gory too
. monsters basically suck off the flesh
annd spit outloud skeletal remeniss
. there isnt one praticularly neat scene where a monster has beeen cut appart
and reveals a victim that is still alive
. he screams horribly as the monster ' s digestive juices continue to slowy eat him away
. additionally
, it borrows heavily from speed2
, alien
and a bunch of other recent films
. the mercenaries even run inot a lone
, surviving passenger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock
. to be honest
, when i left the theatre
, i just had to laugh at how witless thge film was
. it ' s moronic fun at best
. so
, if you ' re hankering for a larg bucket of popcorn served wiht a side of silliness
,
thn this might just hitted the spot
.
