if you
' re yhe kind of person who goes to see movies just beacuse you long fo smoe of thta overpriced theatre popcorn
(
butter optional
)
, hten this is the movie forthe you
! indeed
, tihs has got tothe be eather one of the most unimaginative rip
- offs ofthe other recent acation movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof ofthe them
. it
' s difficult tothe fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film
.
but at least we
' re warned very quickly thyat we may regret our ticket purhcase
, giving us an opportunity to sneak on out anbd into the adjacent show
. what are the four ingreediants of a really bad acation movie
? first
, the movie gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exist deep beneath thte ocean floor
,
and inaddition thsi area
, many ships ahev disappearred
. oooh
.
.
. sacry
! secondly
, a cheesy sountrack tries to connote a tone of mystery
,
but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score
. third
, teh main charater is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a sophisticated military
- stlye pt boat anbd every word that comes outloud ofthe his mouth is awash in comical flippancy
. finally
, in thge cargo hold
, we see those that hired him
. they are also mercenaries thyat hvea tough
- looking haircuts
, talk with accents
, annd try to show how macho they are
. during their trip across thge stormy sea
, their boat suffers an insident annd requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship in the distance
, they make their way to yhe ocean liner
and devise a plan tothe raid the machine shop
, tkae tyhe parts that they need
,
and
then continue on their merry way
. little dont they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster
.
yet
, htey board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades
and machine guns that can kill dozens in a marter of seconds
. tihs is nothing more than a by
- the
- book action film
. their relization ofthe the situation that tehy
' re in doesn
' t happen untl they are in tjhe bowels ofthe thte boat
. thsoe who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed
. the corridors on teh ship are narrow
, misty
, adn provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare
- fests must have
.
yet
, despite the predictable nature of thsi film
, there are some scary
" boo
" moments
.
but most of it isnt just outright silly
.
and this film isnt unusualy gory too
. monsters basically suck off the flesh
and spit out skeletal remains
. there is oney aprticularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart
and reveals a victim that is still alive
. he screams horribly as the monster
' s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away
. additionally
, it borrows heavily ffrom speed2
, alien anbd a bunch of otehr receet films
. the mercenaries even run into a lone
, surviving passenger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly like s
andra bullock
. tothe be honest
, when i left the theatre
, i just had to laugh at how witless the film was
. it
' s moronic funn at best
. so
, if you
' re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served iwth a side ofthe silliness
,
then this might just hitted the spot
.
