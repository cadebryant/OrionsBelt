renowned hong kong action directer tsui hark first teamed wih jean
- claude van damme onthe yhe action star ' s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman
,
_ duble
_ team
_
,
and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick
, stylish
,
and somewhat diverting action timekiller
. tsui continues to energetically pile on thte visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration wih the muscles from brussels
,
_ knock
_ off
_
,
but tihs time around
, style neither save a scirpt that is at best ridiculous
,
annd at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances
. writer steven e
. desouza ' s fairly straightforward plotline isn ' t as outre as
_ double
_ team
_ ' s strange yarn involving a secret htink tank
/ prison
,
bu it makes baout as much sense
, which is little
. van damme plays marcus ravy
, a hong kong
- based sales rep for a jeans comapany
(
!
) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant poweful microchip
- sized bombs in hk product exports to the u
. s
.
-
- dolls
, eletronic equippment
,
and
, yes
, jeans
. it ' s all part of some tipe of ransom scheme
,
but all i remember is
-
-
and i kid yuo not
-
- graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of tjhe world
, bombs detonating
,
and an hat
- wearing figure on the otehr side of the world bursting out into laughter
.
.
.
.
.
. whlch is whta the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously doed throughout
_ knock
_ off
_
. while all of van damme ' s films have its share ofthe unintentional laughs
, mostly due to the stiff acting
" skills
" ofthe the physically agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers mroe than usual
(
though not as many as van damme ' s embarrassing directorial effort
, 1996 ' s
_ the
_ quest
_
)
. a lot of the laughs are earned by some partiuclarly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked that badass like a roman candle
!
"
and
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" standing out among my favorites
.
but it is indeed teh pathetic performances tht provide the bulk of
_ knock
_ off
_ ' s laughs
. van damme is true to laughable form
, perhaps even worse tahn usual
. early scenes actually
_ require
_ him to make funny with co
- star rob schneider
( improbably cast as a deepo cover cia agent posing as marcus ' s business partner
)
,
annd the sight
and sound of the still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious infact the wrong way
. even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug
. paul sorvino is unconvincing
and terribly overwrought as schneider ' s cia superior
;
and lela rochon
, playing an investigator fo the jeans comany
, spends the entire movei in perpetual snarl mode
. inspite rochon ' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her tothe do little more than display her toned legs
, exquisite bone structure
,
and perky bosoms
, the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish forthe microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage
. tsui picks up where he left off visually in
_ double
_ team
_
, juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work
. here
,
though
, tsui ' s visual razzle dazzle borders onthe over kill
, coming off as dseperate attempts to sheild the inanity of thge entire enterprise
. for each nifty trck tsui pulls off
, such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera litterally going through yhe circuitry of electronic devices
, there are others that are completely superfluous
. this is especially disconcerting when the trick iin question could be clever whn used infront thte right context
. for instance
, one scene early onthe hasnt marcus putting his hand in a box
. as he puts his hand in
, the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen
. it ' s undoubtedly an interesting visual
,
bu it would hvae been nice if its ule actually amounted tothe something
. the tust of a van damme movei boils down to the action sequences
,
bu surprisingly
, thsoe in
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much tothe be desired
. tsui does what he cant to make something of them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
,
and unconvential camera angles
,
but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase
and fight sequences written by desouza
. there isn ' t anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger
/ land mine fight in
_ double
_ team
_
, let alone anytying remotely close to tsui ' s legendary hong kong works
(
bu thast ' s a given gonig infront
)
. if tsui hasnt any hope of approaching his countryman john woo ' s stateside succes
, he owudl dont best to break free from van damme
.
.
. before it ' s too late
. if he continues his involvment with b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, the respect he has from hk acation fans will continue to diminish
.
.
. thgat is
, if it hasn ' t already disappeared entirely affter this fiasco
.
