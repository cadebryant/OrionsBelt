renowned hong kong acation director tsui hark first teamed with jean
- claude van damme onthe yhe action star
' s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman
,
_ double
_ team
_
,
and managed tothe make what intially appeared to be a disaster into a slick
, stylish
,
and somewhat diverting action timekiller
. tsui continues to energetically pile onthe the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels
,
_ knock
_ off
_
,
but this time around
, style neither savve a script that is at best ridiculous
,
and at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances
. writer steven e
. desouza
' s fairly straightforward plotline isn
' t as outre as
_ double
_ team
_
' s strange yarn involving a secret think tank
/ prison
,
but it makse baout as much sense
, which is little
. van damme plays marcus ravy
, a hong kong
- based sales rep for a jeans company
(
!
) who stumbles apon a russian terroist scheme to implant poweful microchip
- sized bombs in hk product exports to the u
. s
.
-
- dolls
, eletronic equipment
,
and
, yes
, jeans
. it
' s all part of smoe type of ransom scheme
,
but all i remember is
-
-
and i kid you nto
-
- graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world
, bombs detonating
,
and an hat
- wearing figure on tje other side of the world bursting out into laughter
.
.
.
.
.
. which is what tjhe crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout
_ knock
_ off
_
. while all ofthe van damme
' s films have its share of unintentional laughs
, mostly due to the stiff acting
" skills
" of the physically agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers more than usual
(
though nto as many as van damme
' s embarrassing directorial effort
, 1996
' s
_ yhe
_ quest
_
)
. a lot of the laughs are earned by soem particularly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked that badass liek a roman c
andle
!
"
and
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" st
anding out among my favorites
.
but it is indeed hte pathetic performances that provide the bulk ofthe
_ knock
_ off
_
' s laughs
. van damme is true tothe laughable form
, perhaps even worse than usual
. early scenes acutally
_ require
_ him to make funny with co
- star rob schneider
( improbably casted as a deepo cover cia agent posing as marcus
' s busineses partner
)
, anbd the sight
and soudn of the still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines isnt hilarious in the wrong way
. even typically good actors are nto immune to the bad acting bug
. paul sorvino isnt unconvincing
and terribly overwrought as schneider
' s cia superior
;
and lela rochon
, playing an investigator for the jeans comapany
, spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode
. in rochon
' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her to do littel mroe thna display her toned legs
, exquisite bone structure
,
and perky bosoms
, tghe latter comming in gh
andi for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage
. tsui picks up where he left off visually iin
_ double
_ team
_
, juicing uv the procedings with inventive camera wrok
. here
,
though
, tsui
' s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill
, comming off as desperate attempts tothe shield the inanity of the entire enterprise
. for each nifty trick tsui pulls off
, such as a recurring visual theme that has thge camera literally gogin through the circuitry of eletronic devices
, there are others that are completelyl superfluous
. thsi isnt expecially disconcerting whn the trick in question sould be clever when used infront the right context
. for instatance
, one scene early on has marcus putting his h
and infact a box
. as he puts his h
and in
, the smae action isnt shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner ofthe tje screen
. it
' s undoubtedly an interesting visual
,
but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something
. the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences
, bu surprisingly
, those inwhich
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much to be desired
. tsui does what he can to make something ofthe them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
,
and unconventional camera angles
,
but ther is nothing fundamentally spacial about thge fairly generic chase
and fight sequences written by desouza
. there isn
' t anytying as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger
/ l
and mine fight in
_ double
_ team
_
, let alone anytying remotely close to tsui
' s legendary hong kong works
(
but that
' s a given going in
)
. if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo
' s stateside success
, he would dont best to break free ffrom van damme
.
.
. before it
' s too late
. if he continues his involvement iwth b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, the respect he hasnt from hk action fans will continue to deminish
.
.
. that is
, if it hasn
' t alreayd disappeared entirely affter this fiasco
.
