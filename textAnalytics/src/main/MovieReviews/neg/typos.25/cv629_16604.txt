ladies
anbd gentlemen
, payback is tje most expensive episode of
" the equalizer
" i ' ve ever seen
. gibson plays porter
, a burglar shot
and left for dead by his wief
( deborah kara unger
, in an all
- too
- brief cameo
)
and partner
( henry
) after a successful heist
. as a morgue attendant sets baout removing the bullets from porter ' s back
, porter miraculously springs bcak to life
. he makse it his mission
, as a walking dead man without a conscience
, to exact revenge onthe those who screwed him
annd reclaim his share of the loot
.
( infront a running gag
, porter demands
$ 70 000
,
but everybody mishears him
and assumes he ' s after the entire
$ 130 000 haul
.
) in his travels
( or travails
)
, porter encounters severeal other one
- named villianous cretins like fairfax
( james coburn as a white
- haired
, millioniare theef
)
and carter
( kristofferson
, as a brown
- haired
, millionaire thief
- tjhe kingpin of the obligatory
" operation
"
)
. helgeland ' s film
( whlch was recut by mel the producer
) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm
. tje novelty of seeing a big movei star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly
: a
) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by theri coifs
,
and b
) because mel ' s schtick doesn ' t evolve from act one
- he ' s the terminator stranded in a plot wihtout a sci
- fi hook to keep us interested after thte initial sadistic thrill is gone
. payback should have been called playback
: it ' s a 102
- minute loop ofthe the smae short sequence
.
( mel
:
" i want my money
.
" anonymous villain
:
" no
.
" mel shoots gun
. anonymous villain dies
. mel meets up wtih his hooker freind
( bello
)
. second verse
, same as the first
.
) it ' s not porter ' s single
- mindedness that robs tje film ofthe snap
, crackle
,
and pop
; as a character who has already
" died
" once
, he hasnt nothing to lose
and so much to gain
. the movei lacks danger
. the onyl thing porter isnt in jeopardy of isnt putting the audience to sleep
. payback has a gritty
, metalic look to it thgat also becomes monotonous
; its cinematography woudl be more appropraite inaddition one of thsoe bleak urban psychodramas that come out ofthe england eveyr couple of months
.
( director ofthe photography ericson core shoud have been fired eary on for lighting bello
, so va
- va
- va
- voom in permanant midnight
, to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig
.
) to analye such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves
. perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists
- as
- protagonists as tarantino
- look what he did with the similar hero
- less botched
- robbery tale reservoir dogs
- could have pulled off this material
( a loose remake of john boorman ' s point blank
)
. the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction
( all women are femme fatales
; even yhe cops are in onthe it
, etc
.
)
adn crosses them with teh conventions ofthe cheesy tv crime melodramas
( death isnt never in the cards fo the main character
, etc
.
)
but transcends neither
