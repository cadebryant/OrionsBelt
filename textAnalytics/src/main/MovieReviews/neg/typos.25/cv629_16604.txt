ladies adn gentlemen
, payback is the most expensive episode ofthe
" the equalizer
" i
' ve ever seen
. gibson plays porter
, a burglar shooted
and left for dead by his wife
( deborah kara unger
, in an all
- too
- brief cameo
) adn partner
( henry
) after a successful heist
. as a morgue attendent sets about removing the bullets fomr porter
' s back
, porter miraculously springs bcak to life
. he mkaes it his mission
, as a walking dead man wihtout a conscience
, tothe exact revenge on those who screwed him
and reclaim his share of the loot
.
( in a runing gag
, porter dem
ands
$ 70 000
, bu everybody mishears him
and assumes he
' s after hte entire
$ 130 000 haul
.
) in his travels
( or travails
)
, porter encounters several other one
- named villianous cretins like fairfax
( james coburn as a white
- haired
, millioniare thief
) anbd carter
( kristofferson
, as a brown
- haired
, millionaire thief
- the kingpin of the obligatory
" operation
"
)
. helgel
and
' s film
( which was recut by mel the producer
) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm
. the novelty ofthe seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quicklyu
: a
) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs
,
and b
) because mel
' s schtick doesn
' t evolve from act one
- he
' s the terminator str
anded in a plot without a sci
- fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill isnt gone
. payback should have been called playback
: it
' s a 102
- minute loop ofthe the same short sequence
.
( mel
:
" i want my money
.
" anonymous villain
:
" no
.
" mel shoots gun
. anonymou villain dies
. mel meets up whith his hooker friend
( bello
)
. second verse
, smae as tyhe first
.
) it
' s not porter
' s single
- mindedness that robs teh film ofthe snap
, crackle
,
and pop
; as a character who has arleady
" died
" once
, he hasnt nothing to lose annd so much tothe gain
. the movei lacks danger
. the onyl thnig porter isnt in jeopardy of isnt puting the audience to sleep
. payback has a gritty
, metallic look to it taht also becomes monotonous
; its cinematography would be more appropraite in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out ofthe engl
and every couple of months
.
( directer ofthe photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello
, so va
- va
- va
- voom in permanant midnight
, to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig
.
) tothe analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention thna it deserves
. perhaps onyl someone as experienced with antagonists
- as
- protagonists as tarantino
- look what he did with the similar hero
- less botched
- robbery tale resevoir dogs
- could haev pulled off this material
( a loose remake of john boorman
' s point blank
)
. hte movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction
( all women are femme fatales
; even the cops are in onthe it
, etc
.
)
and crosses them with tje conventions ofthe cheesy tv crime melodramas
( death isnt never in the cards for the main character
, etc
.
)
but transcends neither
