plot
: a down
-
and
- out girl moves in with some over
- tje

and falls in love with a goofy
-
but
- loveable guy from across the street

. ooooooooh
! she must
then join together with her model
- friends tothe fidn outloud whether or nto this guy isnt really goofy
-
but
- loveable
, or a pyscho killer
. aaaaaaaaah
! critique
: completely idiotic
. okay
, so maybe i
' m being a little too nice
. this movie starts off dumb
, moves into the ridiculous adn eventually graduates to idiocy
. there
.
.
. that
' s more like it
! adn how
, you may ask
? well
, it
' s simple really
. four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world
( oh my god
, i jsut found out thgat the actresses playing the parts are models in real life
.
.
. yipes
!
) join monica potter
( in a role whlch can only be descibed as an obvious cry for help
) adn freddie prinze jr
.
( not the actor
,
but the character better known as freddie prinze jr
.
)
, in a plot so stupid
and far
- fetched
, that ytou have to wonder once more
, how crap like tihs gets by the hollywood bigwigs
. tihs thing stinks to high
- heaven
. it
' s just plain embarrassing for everyone involved
. i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humer somehow worked its way inot this so
- called romantic
- comedy
- action movie
? ugh
. wqat a pile of dung
. hey
, i
' m actually starting to sound a little like harry knowles here
,
but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from tyme to tiem
. it
' s sad really
. a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy
, including the over
- used
" folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to tkae a crap
and fart
" gag
.
and how about that dumb blonde modle who keesh running into things
. pure hilarity
! or maybe i
' m just too jaded
, too much of a critic
, not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluff
- piece
.
.
. uuuhhmmm
.
.
. naaaaah
!
! tihs movie sucks tyhe big one
. it
' s chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly inot a preposterous plot
. this is tghe kind of movie taht has oen charcter inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only baceause
.
.
. well
, it
' s supposed to be funny
, see
? you see
, that person hten hasnt their legs swinging inwhich the otehr person
' s face as they drive
and that distracts tghe driver
, see
,
and well
, that
' s kinda funny
, no
? harumph
.
.
. yeah
, well
.
.
. you git the picture
! anyhoo
, freddie prinze jr
.
.
.
. nuff said
. monica potter
, a bad career move
, bu we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit
. the rest of the model girls
.
.
. well
, thanks for being there so i had something to look at
,
but please aplogize to hte entire modeling community as a whole
, for making them all out tothe be complete imbeciles
!
! so why the three points out ofthe ten
, you may ask
? well
, it
' s simple really
. one point goes tothe teh russian model girl
and that kool accent
( don
' t ask me why
,
but it actually turned me onthe
)
. one point goes outloud to all of the model girls for being in thge movie
( nice window decoration
.
.
. natch
!
)
.
and one lastr point goes out to the makers of this film
, who spred us any long sorted stry
,
and made sure to give us the opprotunity of leaving tjhe theatre after only 90 minutes of manufactured garbage
, so that we could run out as fast as we can
, grab thge next person that we see walking down the street
and warn them ofthe teh devil that is
.
.
. freddie prinze jr
.
.
. i mean
, head over heels
. you
' ve been warned
, good people
. ps
: didja notice how i didn
' t even mention rear window once inaddition my entire review
? i didn
' t watn to taint thge memory ofthe the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this hting
,
but
then again
, i jstu doed mention it
,
but i guess it doesn
' t count in the ps section
.
.
. or does it
? ooooh
, whatever
.
.
