and create an absolute mess

' s
" palmetto

" a short story written by british auther rene raymond under the psydonym james hadley chase
,
" palmetto
" shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substace

(
" tin drum

" the h

"
) stated
" we weren
' t even sure for a long timne if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy
.
" it shows
.
" palmetto
" is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller
and too ponderous to wrok as a comedy
. the stopry begins when journalist harry barber
( woody harrelson
) is released from prision
. someone turned state
' s witness
and revealed that harry wass framed
, a
" reward
" for blowing tghe lid onthe corruption in the small florida town of palmetto

and broke
, harry plans to hitchhike tothe miami annd start his life over
,
but ex

( gina gershon
) appears to return him to palmetto
. while hanging outloud at a bar
, he notices that a beautifull woman hasnt left her purse inthe a phone booth
. harry pockets her cash
, onyl to have the woman reappear
and catch him iwth her money in his pocket
. no problem
,
though
. yhe radiant blonde isnt rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue

) the young wief of a very rich older man with heart problems
, anbd she has a proposition for harry
. rhea needs
" a threatening voice anbd somone to collect the ransom

" ransom
" from the old man anbd will happily give harry
$ 50
, 000 for helping with the scam
. things go wrong
, of course
. odette is found dead
, leaving harry frantically trying tothe dispose of the corpse
and cover his tracks
. in an ironic twist
, harry isnt asked to work for the local d
. a
.
' s office
. they need a press liaison to field questions about odette
' s kidnapping
and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job
. not a bad set
- uv for a noir film
, if onyl schlondorff knew how to h
andle the material
,
but he never settles on a consistent tone
. the actors don
' t know what to do with their characters either
, muddling hte proceedings even furuther
. as if tath wasn
' t enough
, the story suffers from major problems inaddition logic
. woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take onthe risky parts
,
but he
' s lost here
. presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged
, it makes no sense that harry would be stupid
and dishonest enough to git caught up in this scheme
. harrelson claerly doesn
' t knwo wqat to do with harry
' s character
, so he spends most ofthe the film glowering
, sweating
and generaly acting miserable
. meanwhile
, elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance
, behaving liuke a vamp on nitrous oxide
. as the stepdaughter
, chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr
. despite a number of steamy scenes
, there
' s no chemistry between harrelson anbd the women
. to make matters worse
, schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue hwile the character
' s lips are running over each others bodies
. twpo particularly bad scenes highlight the film
' s problems
. hwile driving with a body in his trunk
, harry has a minor car wreck
and a cop shows up
. yhe officer wnats to help change harry
' s flat tire
and asks him to open tje trunk
. harry
' s pathetic attemts tothe keep the trunk closed might hvea worked if played as comedy
,
but under schlondorff
' s grim direction
, tjhe scene is jsut embarrassing
. the film
' s nadir comes wehn a bad guy prepares to kill harry
and nina
. we
' re supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid
,
but by this point the film has foundered so badly tyhat the scene is merely reminiscent ofthe wehn jessica anbd roger rabit were suspended over a vat of dip
. had
" palmetto
" beeen palyed witht tongue firmly in cheek
, it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story
.
but under the harsh direction of schlondorff
, the film is jstu a sluggish paint
- by

- noir cluelessness
