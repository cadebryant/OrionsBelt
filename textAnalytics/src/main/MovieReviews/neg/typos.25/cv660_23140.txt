are you like me
? dont you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places
, shouting out loud
, not giving a ratt ' s ass baout anyone around them
,
and basically just wallowing in their pwn self
- importance
? well if you are
, tahn yuo iwll most likely agree iwth my rating ofthe this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away onthe the phone forthe an hour
and a half
.
.
. only tothe make up
and hug in the end
. aaaaaaaahhhh
.
.
. plot
: three grown
- up sisters living their pwn separate lives
, begin tothe re
- establish thier communication lines when their dear ood dad falls ill
. critique
: thsi would be a good movie if it wasn ' t for tje fact that it ' s got vyer little to say
, features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations
, is chockfull ofthe bad acting moments
annd provides less emotional satisfaction than any third
- rate affter
- skool special
.
and i ' m being nice
! how junk like this gets made isnt beyond me
,
but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealed a professional blow
, concidering the regurgitation level of their material hadnt just about reched its limit
. the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan ' s character
and her dad in this film is whn he hugs her
annd swings her around at a christmas tree lot
. wow
.
.
. how deep
. of course
, the same christmas tune tht ' s played inspite eveyr ephron flick chimes out in the background
, while characters continue to build
" bonds
" amoung one anyother by making reference to old
, quaint movies or movei stars
. stop me
.
.
. i ' m gonna cry agina
! htis film is a mess
. the characters are boring
and irritating tothe watch
, tghe plot has something to dont with three selfish sisters tlaking onthe tjhe phone a whole lot
, kind of liking thier father
(
bu nto really
)
and
then finaly realizing the error of their ways
, hwile sharing an
" emotional
" moment about movie stars from the 50s
. admitedly
, i ws not expecting much from a film whose televsion trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds
anbd a big dog rolling its eyes
,
but even i was suprised at the level of ineptitude when it came tothe smoe ofthe the acting effords put forth in this film
. meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot
, looking as adorable as ever
,
bu someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permenant home ofthe limited range
, cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie
/ tv sohw that she ' s in
. enough alrady
!
and diane keaton must ' ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one
, cause her acting was amateurish at best
. niether one convinced infact
" emotional
" scenes
. granted
, they gave walter matthau the best lines in tje film
annd taht ' s probably where my rating ofthe three points comes ffrom
. all in all
, this movie is nto funny
( unless you ' re one to chuckle at train wrecks
)
, provides zero drama
( unless yuo consider loud phone conversations moving
)
, generates absolutely no emotion
(
although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine
)
anbd ends onthe a perfectly pretentious onot
(
" oh no
, please don ' t git any flour onthe my donna karan dress
!
)
. ugh
. i suggest that all ladies take thier husbands
/ boyfriends tothe see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something
! taht ' ll teach ' em tothe mess with yuo
! oh
annd incidentally
, mrs
. joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing inthe the wind
, so there
!
then again
.
.
. maybe you ' ll liek it
.
