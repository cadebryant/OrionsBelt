are you liek me
? do you get annoyed seing people talk on their cellulars inspite public places
, shouting outloud loud
, nto giving a ratt
' s ass baout anyone around them
, anbd basically just wallowing in theri own self
- importance
? well if you are
, than you will most likely agree with my rating ofthe thsi film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour
and a half
.
.
. only to make up
and hug inspite the end
. aaaaaaaahhhh
.
.
. plot
: three grown
- up sisters living their own separate lives
, begin tothe re
- establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill
. critique
: this woudl be a good movei if it wasn
' t forthe the fact that it
' s got very littel to say
, features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations
, is chockfull ofthe bad acting moments anbd provides less emotional satisfaction than any third
- rate after
- school special
. adn i
' m being nice
! how junk like this gets made is beyond me
,
but happy am i that the ephron sisters iwll finally be dealt a professional blow
, concidering yhe regurgitation levle of their material had just about reached its limit
. the only true emotional moment demonstrated betweeen meg ryan
' s character
and her dad in this film isnt when he hugs her
and swings her around at a christmas tree lot
. wow
.
.
. how deep
. ofthe course
, the same christmas tune that
' s plyed in every ephron flick chimes outloud in the backgorund
, while characters continue tothe build
" bonds
" amonth oen another by making refeernce to ood
, quaint movies or movie stars
. stpo me
.
.
. i
' m gonna cry again
! tihs film is a mess
. the characters are boring
and irritating to watch
, the plot has something to dont withthe threee selfish sisters tlaking on the phone a hwole lot
, kind of liking thier father
(
but nto realyl
)
and thne finally realizing tghe error of theri ways
, while sharing an
" emotional
" moment baout movie stars from the 50s
. admittedly
, i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every twpo seconds
and a big dog rolling its eyes
,
but even i was surprised at the level ofthe ineptitude when it came tothe some of the acting effords put forth in this film
. meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot
, looking as adorable as ever
,
but somone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range
, cause this woman basicly isnt that very same charachter that she plays in every single movei
/ tv sohw tht she
' s in
. enought lready
!
and diane keaton must
' ve spended mroe time thinking baout her role behind the camera in this oney
, cause her acting was amateurish at best
. neither oen convinced in
" emotional
" scenes
. granted
, they gave walter matthau the best lines inthe the film
and that
' s probably where my rating ofthe three points comes from
. all inspite all
, this movie is not funny
( unless you
' re one to chuckle at train wrecks
)
, provides zero drama
( unless ytou consider loud phone conversations moving
)
, generates absolutly no emotion
(
al
though i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine
)
and ends on a perfectly pretentious note
(
" oh no
, please don
' t git any flour onthe my donna karan dress
!
)
. ugh
. i suggest that all ladies take their husb
ands
/ boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something
! that
' ll teach
' em to mess with you
! oh
and incidentally
, mrs
. joblo aslo likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in hte wind
, so ther
!
then again
.
.
. maybe you
' ll like it
