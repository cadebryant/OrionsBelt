"
( screen gems
) sicne the succsess of
" waiting tothe exhale
,
" there have been several rumatic comedies about african
- american professionals
. thsi female revenge fantasy
, vivica a
. fox plays shante smith
, a stunning ad exec who seems tothe have reached thte pinnacle of success

,
" yuh gots tothe punish him
.
" so whn she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart
and sexy rival
, gabrielle union
, she devises her pwn version of
" the rules
,
" a 10
- day
" tough love
" emotionally punishing plan to get him back
. unfortunately
, writer
/ director mark brown
(
" how tothe be a payler
"
) breaks the cardinal rule ofthe romantic comedy
: you have to like the protagonist
-
anbd shrill
, self
- congratulatory shante smith is a smirking
, superficial
, spiteful shrew who doesn ' t realize that rational rules cannnot always be applied to loev
. having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly
and the
" day oen
,
"
" day twpo
" title
- card device underscores the tedium
. comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut ' s boisterous best
- friend
,
and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who ' s given a smooth makeover by ms
. robinson
.
but the out
- takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself
. on the granger movie gague ofthe 1 tothe 10
,
" two can play that game
" is smarmy if slick 4
, filled with misogynistic attitude
and blatent product placements
( coca
- cola
, miller genuine draft
)
but little else
. infact this r
- rated
( for explicit sexual language
)
, pseudo
- hip battle of the sexes
, hte audience loses
.
