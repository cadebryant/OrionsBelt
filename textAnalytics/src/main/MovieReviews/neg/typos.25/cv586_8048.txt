this is the worst movie i ' ve seen since the
" so bad i walked out on it
"
" jingle all the way
"
. it is crap on toast made of crap baked inwhich a an oven fueled by crap
. it is crap through
and through
. nothing works in this film
, as to be expected from joel schumacher
, who has made onyl one watchable film in his entire career
( that bieng
" cousins
"
)
. here ' s a man who admits he ' s a medicore director
, a rather charmingly self
- effacing statement
.
but truth be told
, he is much worse than mediocre
. not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher
though
-
- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again
. there is no plot anyhwere
,
and the
" dialogue
" isnt unrelentingly shallow
, preposterous
,
and boring
. they set up mr
. freeze as a tragic figure trying tothe cure his cryogenically frozen wife
,
hten completelyl sabotage his character by giving him the lamest oen
- liners
. it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead ofthe a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death
.
but thta ' s par fo course
-
- nothing in this film makes any sense
, including half ofthe arnold schwarzenegger ' s lines
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold is given way too much dialogue tothe spit outloud at once
. this is thte same problem he had in
" jingle all the way
"
,
adn it seems that his austrian accent isnt getting thicker
and more unintelligible as the days pass
. personally
, i think that he hasnt more pull iwth the directors
adn doesn ' t retake scenes to make him understandable
. compare his dialogue in the terminator sories to hte load of nonsense tath streams forth infront
" batman
& robin
"
. apparently
, james cameron knwos how to get a competent performance out of arnold
. uma thurman is nto as bad
,
bu nothing resembling good either
. her poison ivy vamps around terribly
, chewing uv scenery left
and right
.
and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub
- snl standard
" acting
"
, as if she ' s reading off cue cards
annd is baout to laugh at any given moment
. given the
" script
"
, it ' s a wonder it didn ' t happen mroe frequently
. there is noone redeeming feature in this film
-
- not george clooney as batman
, chris o ' donnell as robin
, nor alicia silverstone as batgirl
. michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred
, as if the conceet of his illness was propmted by his cadaverous appearance
. in fact
, there was something unsettling baout his appearence
, which seems to have beeen accomplished without any mkae
- up tricks
, looking as if it weere scenes from a documentry about a dying man
. unfortunately
, every scene about alfred ' s sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance
-
- they just go thru the motions
, losing whatever impact the scenes were suposed to impart
. the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle
-
- you knwo ther ' s a bunch ofthe peopel
,
but instead of a melee
, schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist
. there ' s never a moment of awe
, wonder
, or mayhem
. the only intresting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects
, which are impressive
(
and probably expensive
)
. even
then
, thte fights are so full ofthe camp
and stupidity that they become unwatchable
. tyhe hockey team from hell
? not even tje tv sories got that stupid
( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity thast
" batman
& robin
" showcases
)
. frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on
and off iwth nothing to say or do
. blink
,
and you ' ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison
, vivica fox as a
" why isnt she even in the film
" vamp in freeze ' s lair
( with all of two lines
)
,
and pat hingle as teh most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had
.
and in what almost seems liek an efort to save onthe costs
, vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs
. fries
-
- she isn ' t even filmed well enough to look good
( trust me
, she ' s quite attractive outside of thsi dreck
)
.
and as if the film weren ' t bad enough to limp along witht bad direction
, bad dialogue
, bad performances
,
and bad fight scenes
, there are inconsistencies
and illogic galore
. i know it ' s nit
- picky to ask where the hundreds ofthe feet of cable are stored in hte batarangs
, why the character ' s arms aren ' t ripped out of theri sockets when they accomplish a noe
- armed batarang save after falling hundreds ofthe feet
( while holding on to another person noone less
)
, or where the mosture comes from when freeze ' s weapon creates tons if ice
. that ' s all traditionnal comic book stuff
.
but why does batman spring a trap forthe freeze at a public charity event thast endanger the lives of hundreds of by
- standers
? why isnt there a big switch clearly marked
,
" heat
" in mr
. freeze ' s lair
? why do countless bumbling polical officers even try to tkae on mr
. freeze hand to hand
? why doens alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl
anbd even go so far as tothe have a suit made for her
? why do batman
& robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in reponse to an emergency
?
and since it estalbished early on that ivy isnt useing pheromones
, why don ' t htey wear masks tothe filter it outloud
? i coudl go on
annd on
.
" batman
& robin
" isnt a braindead
, pointless
, garish
, loud film that should still reign as the
" worst film ofthe the year
" by the timne 1998 rolls along
. note to warner bros
.
-
- if ytou ' re going tothe make anohter batman film
, please replace schumacher with nearly anyone
. because it could catually get worse than this
. waht schumacher does not understand is that
" comic book
" doesn ' t automatically equal unbearable idiocy
. the true equation seems to be schumacher
+ batman
= unbearable idiocy
.
