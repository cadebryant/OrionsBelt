your first clue thyat something isn
' t gonna be quite right with the movie you
' re about to see
: it
' s heavily christmas
- themed
and its realease date is
, oh
, say
, at the end of february
. your second clue that something isn
' t gonna be quite right with the movie you
' re about to see
: charlize theron
, one ofthe the movei
' s dubious stars
, makse an appearance on the daily sohw inaddition which
, when asked if her new movie
' s any good
, she replies wiht thge equivalent of a verbal sigh
.
.
. assuring us that
, yeah
, it sure isnt a movie
, all right
! annd htere
' s some scenes like those you
' d expect tothe find in a movei
,
and there
' s some action
.
.
.
and htere
' s other
.
.
. stuff
.
.
. too
. how to immediately grab my attention
: open your movei wih five dead guys in santa claus suits
.
then show a caption reading
" six days ealier
.
.
.
" ya know
, i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas
.
.
. how to emmediately lose my attention
: folow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice
- guys
- who
- don
' t
- deserve
- to
- be
- in
- prison scene
. write a line for the one ofthe prisoners like
" i just want to go home annd eat christmas dinner
and watch soem ball wiht my dad
.
"
then
, haev ben affleck actually say thta line
, on film
,
and forget to leave it on yhe cutting room floor
. for good measure
, throw infact a poorly motiviated prison riot annd have affleck
' s best buddy stabbed
.
.
. aw
.
.
. adn just two days before his release
, too
. already the cliches are piled on thick
,
and when it rains
, it pours
. how tothe take my attension
, dash it violently against tje rocks
,
and make it so that i
' m contemplating my strategy for calling
" shotgun
" about an hour before i know the credits will roll
: deny your cahracters hte abilty to thiunk
. ahve ben affleck
, for some reason i
' ll never underst
and
, pretend he
' s his dead prision buddy so thyat he can get his girlfriend
, played by charlize theron
. have gary sinise show up
and force the twpo of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist
. thge villains
' big idea
? kidnap affleck because he used tothe be a security guard at tjhe casino
, force him to tell you where all yhe doors in tghe palce are
,
then dress up infront santa suits
, create some
" diversions
"
and rob the place
. on paper
, it seems like hte stuff of a potential caper comedy
,
but veteren director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper annd thinks he
' s looking at the makings for some sort of clever action
- crime thriller
. it
' s nto like thge man isn
' t capable
.
.
. far from it
. he
' s the man responsible for classic poltical thrillers like the manchurian c
andidate
and seven dyas in may
. he wowed me with some thte most memorable car chases i
' ve ever seen in last year
' s ronin
. bu he
' s certainly guilty of churning outloud some certifiable losers
.
.
. put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version ofthe the isl
and of dr
. moreau
. step one inwhich making your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: cast ben affleck inwhich the role of the world
' s most generic hero
. he gets noone good one
- liners
, he doesn
' t get to shoot or implode anything inthe newyorker
and intresting ways
,
and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car theif
and wants a cup of hot chocolate anbd piece of pecan pie
. his name is rudy
( short forthe rudolph
, in all likelihood
. see
, it
' s called reindeer ganes
. get it
? get it
? shut up
.
) infront the past
, affleck has beeen at his best as a supporting actor
, anbd riendeer ganes does nothing to further his viabliity as a leading man
. step two inaddition makeing your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: gary sinise
' s villain dresses
and looks like the most st
andart movie crook a filmmaker could have smoe up witht
. he
' s dirty
and potty
- mouthed
, he
' s got long
, scruffy hair anbd a goatee
,
and i fully expeced him to walk out of teh casino carrying sacks with giant doller signs onthe them
. he
' s also extremely inept at what he doesnt
. he thinks garish cowboy costumes
and santa suits make acceptable disguises
,
and he trusts affleck
' s character tothe pull thru even aftter
, time annd time
and time again
, he tricks him
and lies to him adn nearly kills him
.
but instead of tapping inot the comic possibilities of this role
, sinise seems to think he
' s palying some sort of tough
, smart
,
and smooth criminal mastermind
, rether than the complete moron that wass obviously written into the scirpt
.
[ on a side note
, gary sinise wins this week
' s
" title
!
" award
, as he
' s thte one who gets to awkwardly cram tjhe name ofthe the movei into one ofthe his lines eary in the proceedings
. last week
' s winner was natasha henstridge forthe the hwole nine yards
.
] how to take your bad idea
and amking things worse
: include two or three plot twists that
, instade of makeing the apparently stupidity of thge plan seem suddenly intelligent
, make the plan seem even more ridiculous adn unlikey
. thsi is a bad movie
.
and what
' s worse isnt that
, except fo a fewd moments near the not
- so
- stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous
, riendeer ganes never really gives us thge satisfaction ofthe being laughably bad
. if they
' d done that much
, at least i would have been entertained
.
