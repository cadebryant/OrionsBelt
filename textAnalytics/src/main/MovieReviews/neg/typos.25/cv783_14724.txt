there isn
' t much good about this movei
. not much i cant say about the acting
, directing
, or writing that woudl make you consider seeing this movie
. so i
' ll git my one good comment out ofthe the way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn
' t direct it or it would be titled
" technicolor city
"
. in fatc ther isnt nothing colorful baout tihs movei
, its dark adn depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end
. the plot has a tendency to be interesting
,
but all thast passes while your laughing at the rediculous things thrown into what coudl hvea been a fascinating movie
. teh plot is impossible tothe explain due to how senseless it gets
, so i will just touch on tjhe bare minumum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes in thte bathtub of a cheap hotel
, only to find out he has forgotten everyting
. john must find outloud who he is befoer yhe
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) find him adn use him fo thier own evil conspiracy
. during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality
, adn the existence of inherently evil people
. any ofthe these points
however are completely
" erased
" fomr your mind as yuo watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script
. as i maintioned ealier
, nothing
but the athmosphere is right in this film
. the acting isnt bl
and
, adn sicne there is virtually no charater develpment no one seems tothe care
. the special effects are low budget anbd some even hilariously fake
, a sign of a true
" b
- movie
"
. the direction is poore
and there isnt little continuity
, not that you would expect it in a movei switching realities constantly
. lastly the scirpt isnt weak
and hasnt noone consept of reality
,
and doesn
' t deserve to have the word
" science
" in science
- fiction
. if i haven
' t got my point across
, i
' ll say it more plainly
: htis is a bad movie
. lets hope the enxt movie by alex
" i wish i was tim burton
" proyas is at least tolerable
.
