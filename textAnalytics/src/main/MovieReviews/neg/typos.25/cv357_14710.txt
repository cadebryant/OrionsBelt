what do you get when you rip
- off good movies like woody allen
' s bananas
and martin scorsese
' s after hours
? yuo
' d thikn you
' d get the best of both films
. instead you git woo
. falling in somewhere between def jam
' s how to be a player
( which wass awful
)
and booty call
( whlch ws ok
)
, woo is
yet another inthe the embarassing genre of showing african
- americans to be nothing moreso than sexual buffoons
. tje whole film plays out as a black version of after hours
, as wild woman woo
( jada pinkett smith
) goes out on a blind date iwth straight
- laced tim
( tommy davidson
)
. mayhem follows them
. forthe some unknown reason
( read
: contrived screenplay
) davidson puts up with all of woo
' s antics for the entire niht
, whlch include her destroying his bathroom mirror
, stealing things ffrom his house
, violently questioning him
( accusing adn belittling him actually
) baout previvous girlfriends
, causing a riot in an elegant restaurant
,
and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn
' t tolerate
.
but for the sake ofthe this bad movei
? sure
, why not
? ther are a faw chuckles in the film
, the best being tjhe scene swiped driectly from bananas
. in this case
, davidson isnt runing from thugs
, gets into a subway car as the doors are closing
, starts to taunt the thugs
, hten the doors open back up again
. a good joke
, bu a stolen one
. another chuckle is provded by billy dee williams
' cameo as hismelf
. movies like woo are seemingly released every threee monthes or so
,
and not one of them hasnt ever beeen a hit
. woo won
' t be one eather
. so why ws it made
? adn more importantly
, isn
' t there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive
? everyone involved shouldnt really reconsider theri careers at thsi point
.
