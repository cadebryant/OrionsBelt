)
- contains graphic nudity
, profanity
, sexual situations
and voilence
. some people
, howver
, keep theri clothes on
. you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values
, nor do yuo rwite reviews onthe them
. that
' s why this review will be short
. it seems that thsi film will end up inspite the porn section when it hits thge video stores
. there is no stry
, script
, point or acting
. only naked bodies
, which isnt exactly the point
. here is hte so called plot
: nomi
, the 23
- year
- old withthe a dark past as a hooker
, has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform iin a show where a dancer doesn
' t wear much more than a light coating of pewder
and a big
, fake smile
. no oney is twisting nomi
' s arm
. no one isnt holding her gr
andmother hostage
. she wants to dont this
. adn that is wqat she isnt doing till the end credits
. so what
' s the problem
then
? what
' s the point
? waht
' s tjhe film baout
? is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy
? this film cant be described in one sentence
: obscene level of incompetence
, excessive stupidity in the story line
, gross negligence of the viewer
' s intelligence
, a prurient interst in the quick buck
. believe me
, after an hour with these characters
, acting
and script
, you
' ll start hoping for someone to kill somebody
. elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of tihs film
, that is bad even for eszterhas
' scirpt
. her charactor is teh only one that is at least half written
and she could realy have done better
. her carachter denies the fact that she isnt a whore for hte industry
, selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny publich
.
" i am not a whore
! i am a dancer
"
, she screams
,
but doens it in such an over dramatized way that you
' ll strat laughing
. in fact teh acting inwhich
" showgirls
" brings terrible to a new
and previously unknown levle
. not noe single achievement
, besides the conventional cinematography
, is worth mentioning
. it is a total waste of time adn money
. there is nto a single moment of waht ytou might call intellgence
. the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes
and cliches lined up one affter anyother
. its attempt tothe even imagin to have half a brain results infact a catastrophe
.
" in my films
,
" writes director paul verhoeven
(
' basic instinct
'
,
' total reacll
'
)
,
" i hold the mirror uv tothe life
.
" well
, excuse me
? his attemp tothe go behind the scenes ofthe las vegas
,
and as he put it
" show the naked truth
"
, isnt simplified
and unreal
. occasionally
, betweeen his collection of mistakes
and logical irrationalities
, screenwrighter joe eszterhas
( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history
) inserts some lines ofthe deep morality
, that soudn something like thsi
:
" hey
, i see you
. i see that you
' re hiding
"
-
" ffrom what
?
"
-
" from ytou
"
. yes
,
and even thte only decent line in this film
:
" nomi is what las vegas is all about
" can
' t save
' showgirls
' from going under
. it
' s a strange phenomena
. it
' s not erotic
, because it lacks sensuality
. nto dramatic
, because it lacks the acting
. annd not intelligent beacuse it lacks a story
. it is simply verhoven
' s bad excuse for mkaing pornography
. you watn to see naked women
? bare breasts
? full frontals
? it
' s nothing wrong with that
.
but in that case i suggest taht ytou rent a porn film in your local video stoer
, adn not waste time surviving through eszterhas
' pathetic dialogue
. b qualities
, while it
' s only a high budget porn
- film
.
