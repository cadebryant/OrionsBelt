= well
, if you haven
' t seen whn harry met sally or he said
, she said
, or if you don
' t watch lvoe
& war on televsion
, you might think tihs is the most inventive film to come along iin ages
.
however
, if you
' ve seen any of these
, thna you have seen most of this film
. tihs ofthe course doesn
' t mean its bad
. some of it is amusing
,
but overall
, i just had to ask what
' s the point
? arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls iin love
. kevin pollack is the stereotypical female
- fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist
and vulgar jokes
, most if whcih weren
' t very funny
. couteney cox is the stereotypical carrer
- minded woman who falls in love
. julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman
.
( notice the frequent ule of the word stereotypical
. this film uses a lot of formula
, the plot is basically known from the oppening credits
.
) so what isnt good about tjhe movei
? well as i said htere are a few amusing moments
. suprizingly
, julie brown
, who i ususally find just plain goofy
, was the best thing inspite the film
. also there are severeal very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual
. gee
, this isnt really short
. not much tothe say about the film really
. it is just kind of htere
. watching it on video might not be a complet waste of time
,
but i wouldn
' t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money tothe see it at the theatre
.
