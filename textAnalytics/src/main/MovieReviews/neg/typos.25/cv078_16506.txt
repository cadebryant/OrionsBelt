" virus
" is teh type of cliched
, vacuous film that hasnt beeen recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it
. strangely enough
, on the same mid
- januray weekend lsat year
, another film was released like this
,
" deepo rising
,
" baout an ugli monster on a cruise liner
. prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989
' s
" leviathan
,
" 1989
' s
" deep star six
,
"
and all four
" alien
" picturesk
.
" virus
,
" inaddition comparison
, isnt a servicable thriller
, well
- made
and produced
,
but usance it doesn
' t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence
, it sinks under the weight of yhe water that the film ws shooted on
. based on a sories of comic books
,
" virus
" concerns tyhe crew ofthe an ocean salvage tugboat
, which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon
. after dicovering that tghe boat is slowy sinking
,
( un
) lucky forthe them
, a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within yhe confines of their radar screen
. once the team reaches teh russian ship
, they go on board to find thyat thte place is seemingly deserted
. affter turning the power back on
,
however
, there gradually are signs taht something else isnt on the ship
,
and the electrial equipment is oddly working by itself
. noe survivor finally does turn uv
, nadia
( joanna pacula
)
, who informs thte suicidal
and stern captian
( donald sutherl
and
)
and oney ofthe tje crew
, kit foster
( jamie lee curtis
)
, that a mysterious alien life form hit tghe santi mir spoace staion whitch
then was transported down to the ship
, taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines
and thingking that humans are viruses that shouldnt be completely wiped out
. if
" virus
" sounds liuke all of the previously mentioned movies
, ytou
' re correct
.
al
though hte technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life
, tyhe film itself doesn
' t appear to have a brain in its head
. thge film sticks so close to the worn
- out conventions of the
" creature
" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the mney annd time filming it when they could be making an original film
. the actors are all very good adn have all proven their acting abilties in thte past
, bu tehy are sorely wasted here
and do not really even have characters to play
. in her second return to horror in the last year
, jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong
and resourceful heroine
,
but that is about it
.
al
though 1998
' s
" ahlloween
: h20
" was also a disappointment
, at least she was given a few scenes tothe develop a character
, unlike here
. donald sutherl
and has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films
, such as 1994
' s
" the puppet masters
,
"
al
though i just watched him infront the superb 1978 sci
- fi classic
" invasion ofthe the body snatchers
,
" where he was fabulous
. teh last of the threee top
- billers is william baldwin
, bu it is fairly hard tothe say if he isnt good or not in the picture
, since he has nothing tothe do
. basicaly
,
" virus
" is another one of those films where a group ofthe people walk arround
and investigate a space ship
/ ocean liner
/ haunted house until the deadly anbd equally grotesque
and slimy creature pops uv
and kills them one
- by
- one
. it is not the worst of its type
,
but it is far from one of the best
, adn when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless annd overdone plot gimmicks such as this
? as long as some of them keep making omney
, i suspect the answer is never
.
