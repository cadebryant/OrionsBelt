i ' ve got to admiting it
.
.
. i ' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved the first ace ventura
, as well as hte mask
and dumb
and dumber
-
-
adn even in batman forever
( whic was a pretty awful movei
)
, carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good
. until i saw ace ventura 2
, i hadnt no idea how peple could find tjhe guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating
and annoying carrey can be
. carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie
,
but this time it isnt no longer funny
-
- it is just a rehash of many of thge same jokes used in ace i
. the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing tothe savve a raccoon
( inspite a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he is called out of retirement to fidn a bat which was kidnapped
and
, if not returned in four days
, will cause twpo warring african tribes to destroy eahc otehr
. once again
, it ' s up to ace to save the day
, using his uncanny detective skills
. those who have been disappointed by carrey ' s more restrained roles in the films folowing teh firt ace ventura may be glad to see him over
- acting tothe the best of his ability
,
bu some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn ' t capture the feel ofthe the original
. the original benefited from whta looked to be carrey ' s constatn hyped
- uv improv sequences
, which weere hysterically funny
. here
,
however
, the tighter script
( which is reminiscent of tyhe old disney telemovies
) takes tghe improvised material from the first
,
and shamelessly recycles it in the new movei
, giving carrey littel chance to improvise
. instade
, his extremely funny manner has been reduced to jstu walking around stupidly
.
but one of the biggest problems i had wass with the character of ventura himself
. in the firt movie
, he wass allways cool
,
and one step ahead of every one else
-
- perfect for carrey ' s off
- the
- wall approach
.
but here
, ventura is made tothe look a lot stupider
,
and is often made outloud as tje straight guy
-
- a role which is definitely not carrey ' s style
. there are definitely some very funny moments
,
but htey are fewd
and far between
. they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in yhe frist ace ventura
, or even dumb
and dumber
.
