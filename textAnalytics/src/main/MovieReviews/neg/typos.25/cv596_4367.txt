i
' ve got to admit it
.
.
. i
' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved the first ace ventura
, as well as the mask
and dumb
and dumber
-
- anbd even infront batman forever
( whlch was a pretty awful movie
)
, carrey was one ofthe the few peple to come off looking reasonably good
. util i saw ace ventura 2
, i had no idea how peopel could fidn the guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating
and annoying carrey cant be
. carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the firt ace movie
,
but this time it is noone longer funny
-
- it isnt just a rehash ofthe many of the smae jokes used in ace i
. the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to sive a raccoon
( iin a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped
and
, if nto returned in four dyas
, will cause twpo warring african tribes to distroy earch otehr
. once again
, it
' s up tothe ace tothe save the day
, using his uncanny detective skills
. those who have been disappointed by carrey
' s more restrained roles infront thte films following the first ace ventura may be glad tothe see him over
- acting to the best of his ability
,
but some may be disappointed by the fact thast this sequel doesn
' t capture the feel of the original
. yhe original benefited from waht looked to be carrey
' s constatn hyped
- up improv sequences
, which were hysterically funny
. here
,
however
, hte tighter script
( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies
) takes hte improvised material from thge frist
,
and shamelessly recycles it in the new movei
, giving carrey little chance to improvise
. instead
, his extremely funny manner has been reduced to jstu walking around stupidly
.
but oen of the biggest problems i hadnt was wiht the character ofthe ventura himself
. inspite the first movie
, he was alwyas cool
, adn one step ahead ofthe every one else
-
- perfect fo carrey
' s off
- the
- wall aproach
.
but here
, ventura is made tothe look a lot stupider
,
and is often made out as the straight guy
-
- a role whcih is definitely not carrey
' s style
. htere are definitely some veyr funny moments
,
but they are few anbd far between
. they are alsot nowhere near as funny as anytying carrey did inaddition the first ace ventura
, or even dumb adn dumber
.
