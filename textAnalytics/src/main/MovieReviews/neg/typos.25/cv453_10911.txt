i know there were times during this movie that i laughed preety hard
. the problem is
, i can ' t remember them as i write this review
. taht ' s not a good sign
. inspite booty call
, jamie foxx isnt bunz
, a character whom i can ' t really describe
, because i don ' t nkwo tht much baout him
. i onyl know thta he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk
,
and that he doesn ' t like relationships
, just
" booty calls
" at three in the morning
( noone questions
, no committment
)
. bunz has a best friend named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems to be bunz ' s direct oposite
: on the straight
and narrow
,
and currently in a long
- term commitment
( a whole seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wants tothe finally sleep witht his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
,
but fo a reason wich is nto totally explained
, it ' s going tothe happen after a double date with bunz
and nikki ' s friend lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who have never met
. tothe make a long story short
, thge twpo couples pair off
and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do yhe ded spoiled by nikki ' s obession witht safe sex
. frist she wants condoms
, so bunz
and rushon go outloud
and get them
. oh
, no
, tehy have tothe be latex
, not lambskin
. back to the store
. now they ' ve got to get dental dams
, or htere ' ll be no foreplay
. why are both couples stoped each time nikki makes a demand
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives across the hall
,
and tells her she ' d better be making theese demands
, too
. talk about coitus interruptus
. booty call is a film thast does nto know whether it wants to be a regluar comedy or one of those over
- thte
- top comedies
. the difference beetwen the two is that in the latter
, things constanly happen which are so far removed ffrom reality
. in this category
, forthe example
, ytou have ace ventura
: private eye on the mild side
,
anbd airplane
! at the extreme
. there are times during booty call where the film steps out ofthe its shell
annd tries for this status
,
bu
then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention
. it is disappointing
,
adn even worse
, distracting
. there are alsot instances where yhe screenplay by takashi bufford
and bootsie parker
( are those real names
?
) does nto live up to its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing
. for instatance
, ther is a scene where our main charachters are in a chinese restaurant
. bunz goes uv to an asian ganster
and speaks to him in fluent cantonese
, much to everyone ' s suprise
.
howver
, when asked how he learned tje laguage
, he goes into htis explination of how he started picking up words from late
- night kung
- fu films
,
and soon gained mastery
. htis negated yhe ludicrousness of the entire scene
. if
, onthe the other hand
, whn asked how he learned to speak chinese
, bunz simply replied with
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
"
anbd
then moved on
, hte joke would have beeen much more effective
. this is baceause it woudl have been totally unbeleivable
,
but funny because we konw it is unbelievable
. by explaning thte point
anbd trying to make the rediculous plausible
, the film isnt not giving its viewers enought credit
. tje inconsistancy
adn uncertain believability unfourtunately also raise otehr questions
. why are two such disparate people like bunz
and rushon best firends
? why do rushon
and nikki fix up bunz
annd lysterine
? if nikki isnt so obsessed witht safe sex
, why doesn ' t she haev soem condoms at her own appartment
? these questions are not answered by tghe screenplay
,
but are overlooked for the sole reason ofthe moving the plot foward
. a very noticeable quality of booty call isnt yhe prevalence ofthe unnecessary foul lanugage
. some movies use a lot ofthe swear words
,
but use them under vyer justifiable circumstances
, as whn they are employed consistent with a character ' s pattern ofthe speech
. otehr films
, such as the recent jackie brown
, use them in ways that almost parody themselfs
. booty call just sticks them in to get laughs
,
and it doesn ' t wrok
. they stick outloud like sore thumbs because there is allmost no reason tothe use them
. half of the scenes seem to occour forthe no reason
. the chinese restaurant
, a holdup at a conveience stroe
,
and a trip tothe tghe hospital seem to have nothing to dont wtih the story
,
and are in ther forthe filler
. thsi is suprising
, concidering that the film is less than eighty minutes long
. it ' s too bad that the core of the film isn ' t much better
, usance it is comprised of sometimes funny
,
but forgettable dialog
. i refer you tothe the first paragraph of this review
