i know there weere times during this movie thgat i laughed pretty hard
. the problem is
, i cxan
' t remember them as i write htis review
. that
' s not a good sign
. in booty call
, jamie foxx is bunz
, a character whom i can
' t really decribe
, beacuse i don
' t know that much about him
. i only know that he likes to shoot dice onthe the sidewalk
, annd that he doesn
' t liek relationships
, just
" booty calls
" at three in the morning
( no questions
, noone commitment
)
. bunz has a best friend named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems to be bunz
' s direct opposite
: on the straight
and narrow
,
and currently inaddition a long
- term commitment
( a hwole seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wnats tothe finally sleep with his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
,
but for a reason which isnt not totally explained
, it
' s going to happen after a double date with bunz
and nikki
' s friend lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who have never met
. to mkae a long story short
, the twpo couples pair off
and spend the rest of tyhe evening having theri attempts tothe do tyhe deed spoiled by nikki
' s obsession with safe sex
. firt she wants condoms
, so bunz
and rushon go out annd get them
. oh
, no
, tehy have to be latex
, not lambskin
. bcak tothe the store
. nowe they
' ve got tothe get dental dams
, or there
' ll be no foreplay
. why are both couples stopped earch time nikki makes a dem
and
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives across the hall
, annd tells her she
' d better be making these dem
ands
, too
. talk about coitus interruptus
. booty call is a film that doesnt not konw whether it wants tothe be a regular comedy or one of those over
- the
- top comedies
. the difference between the twpo is that in the latter
, thnigs constantly happen which are so far removed fomr reality
. inspite this catagory
, for example
, you have ace ventura
: private eye on the mild side
,
and airplane
! at tyhe extreme
. ther are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell adn tries for this status
, bu
then too oftenly quickly retreats to the safety ofthe convention
. it isnt disappointing
,
and even worse
, distracting
. there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford
and bootsie parker
( are those real names
?
) does not live up to its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing
. for instance
, htere is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant
. bunz goes up to an asian gangster
and speaks to him in fluent cantonese
, much to everyone
' s surprize
.
however
, when asked how he learned the language
, he goes into this explination of how he started picking uv words from lite
- niht kung
- fu films
,
and soon gained mastery
. this negated the ludicrousness of thge entire scene
. if
, on the other h
and
, when asked how he learned to speak chinese
, bunz simply replied with
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
"
and
then moved on
, yhe joke would have been much more effective
. this is because it would hve been totally unbeleivable
,
but funny because we know it is unbelievable
. by explaining yhe point annd trying to make the rediculous plausible
, the film is not giving its viewers anough credit
. the inconsistency anbd uncertain believability unfortunatly also raise other questions
. why are two such disparate peple like bunz
and rushon best firends
? why do rushon
and nikki fix up bunz
and lysterine
? if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex
, why doesn
' t she have some condoms at her own apartment
? these questions are nto answered by the screenplay
, bu are overlooked fo the sole reason of moving the plot forward
. a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unneccessary foul language
. some movies use a lot of swaer words
,
but use them under vrey justifiable circumstances
, as when they are employed consistent with a character
' s pattern of speech
. other films
, such as the recent jackie brown
, use them in ways that almost parody themselves
. booty call jstu sticks them in to git laughs
,
and it doesn
' t work
. tehy stick outloud like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them
. half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason
. the chineese restaurant
, a holdup at a convenience store
, anbd a trip tothe the hospital seem to have nothing tothe dont with the stor
, anbd are inaddition there for filler
. this is surprising
, considering that tje film is less than eighty minutes long
. it
' s too bad that the core ofthe tghe film isn
' t much better
, since it is comprised of somtimes funny
,
but forgettable dialouge
. i refer ytou to the first paragraph of this review
