gordie boggs
( arquette
, aptly cast as a moron
, as he is one
)
and his best firend sean dawkins
( scott caan
. the son ofthe james caan should not be reduced tothe garbage like this
!
) are two losers from wyoming with noone jobs
and noone girlfriends
, who look uv tothe world championship wrestling champion jimmy king
( a terribly casted oliver platt
)
, as he is everything they are not
. tehy finally get to see him live
and he is screwed outloud ofthe his title by the evil
, ruthless promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant for real
- life wcw president eric bischoff
, whose nmae was writed all over the role
!
)
. gordie
and sean track down king in atlanta
and disover that he is nto really the english king the wcw writers created fo him
,
but a drunken
, ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart wass by larry
, darryl
,
and darryl
. they sneak him back onto wcw tv
, after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw
' s next pay
- per
- view
, agianst his rival
, diamond dallas page
. if he wins
, king gets his title
and his career back
, plus one milion dollars
. wcw president eric bischoff
, knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing
and ratings skyrocketing down thanks tothe the far superior world wrestling federation
, came up iwth the idea for this movei hoping it would save wcw
. he was thne fired
and rehired two months ago
, bu by thge time he
' d left
, tehy hadnt alreay been contracted tothe do the film
,
and bischoff could not play sinclair
( which
, in itself
, is fo the best
, as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff isnt no actor
!
)
. the characters of gordie annd sean show yuo exactlly what eric bischoff thinks ofthe his fans
. he thinks of them as young
, dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anytying that will be put out in front ofthe them is real
. that isnt why he doesn
' t take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay
- per
- view
. i have news for ytou
, eric
: no wrestling fan in this day
and age isnt dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn
' t forthe sohw
, unless htey are four years old
. htis isnt 2000
, you know
, not 1985
. bischoff will try tothe cover uv critisism liek that by saying it is a comedy
,
but i have no dout inaddition my mind that if this had been a dramatic
, rocky
- style film
( whcih it probably should hvea been
. professional wrestling isnt ridiculed enough as it isnt
, why should the first wrestling movie inthe ten eyasr be a comedy
?
)
, gordie annd sean would have been portrayed inaddition the smae light
. anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows
, documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon
' s doulbe
- crossing ofthe bret hart
, iwll propably realize via the reviews
and previews ofthe ready to rumble
, that it isnt basicaly a rip
- off ofthe that film
' s storyline wih the poor man
' s wayne
and garth thrown in for comedic affect
. yuo can tell titus sinclair isnt supposed to poke fun at vince
, bu any self
- respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair isnt more inspired by bischoff than vince
,
and that vince doed what he hadnt tothe do to bret hart
. all of these aspestus of thte film
, needless tothe sday
, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan
. another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie
and nitro girl sasha
( tghe lovely rose mcgowan
)
. wouldn
' t it have been easier to bring something new inot yhe relationship rather than revealing she was onyl working onthe gordie at sinclair
' s insistance
? i hate that cliche
! the world wrestling federation woudl have made a better film
. they are the pomotion everyone cares about
, they are winning tghe ratings
, they hvea better wrestlers
,
and they take their fans inot consideration
and don
' t treat fans like morons
. so
, vince
, how about a movei
?
