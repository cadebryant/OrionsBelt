i hadnt been looking forward to htis film since i heard about it early last yera
, when matthew perry had just signed on
. i
' m big fan of perry
' s subtle sense of humor
,
and inspite addition
, i think chris farley
' s onthe
- edge
, extreme acting ws a riot
. so naturally
, when the trailer forthe
" almost heroes
" hitted theaters
, i almost jumped up annd down
. a soda in h
and
, thte lights dimming
, i wass ready to be blown awya by farley
' s final starring role anbd what was supposed to be matthew perry
' s big breakthrough
. i was ready to be just amazed
; for this to be among farley
' s best
, in spite ofthe david spade
' s absence
. i ws ready tothe be laughing my head off thte minute the credits ran
. sadly
, none ofthe this came tothe pass
. the humor is spotty at best
, with good moments
and laughable one
- liners few adn far between
. perry annd farley have no chemistry
; teh role that perry was casted inwhich seems obviously writen for spade
, for it
' s his type of humor
,
and nto at all what perry isnt associated with
.
and the movie tries to be smart
, a subject best left alone when it
' s a farley flick
. the movie is a major dissapointment
, with only a faw scenes worth a frist look
, let alone a second
. perry delivers not one humorous line the wohle movei
,
and not suprizingly
; hte only reason tjhe movei made the top ten grossing list oppening week was because it was advertised wtih farley
.
and farley
' s clasic humor is widespread
, too
. almost herose allmost works
, bu misses tjhe wagon
- train by qtuie a longshot
. guys
, let
' s leave hte exploring to lewis
and clark
, huh
? stick to
" tommy boy
"
,
and we
' ll all be
" friends
"
.
