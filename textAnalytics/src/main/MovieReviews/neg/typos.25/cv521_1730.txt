saw an adavanced screening of the movie sniper last night
,
and i have tothe say i wasn
' t too impressed
. this film isnt baout an expert marine sniper
, palyed by tom berenger
, who is teamed with a hot
- shooted
- young
- no
- experience
- never
- killed
- a
- man new partner tothe tkae outloud soem drug
- kingpins
and military strong men in panama
. sound cliche
? that
' s only the beginning
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) played the rookie
, annd never seemed to get a h
andle on his charachter
. he was so contrary
and pig
- headed in the beginning
, yuo jsut wanted to smack him
.
then he goes
" crazy
" fomr the presure
, bu seems tothe immediately snap out of it
. i
' m not sure if the blame should lie with the directing
, editing
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
. bu it didn
' t all come together
. i thikn berenger is a pretty ogod actor
,
and he looked great inaddition teh part
, covered in camo
, face painted
, stalking through thte jungle withthe his high
- pwoer rifle
.
.
.
but once agian
, his character wass given some pretty bad dialogue
,
and didn
' t react too logically to many of the situations
. there was vyre little logical development in these cahracters
. my biggest problem with this film was it
' s tendacy to put these two snipers in as
* many
* inches
- from
- death situations as possible
. tehy began to resemble g
. i
. joes
, the greatest american hero
.
and of course their almost supernatural accracy with their guns was called upon to get them out ofthe far too many close calls
. now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold
, in fact that
' s what made dieu hard so much fun
: teh super
- hero avenger tipe
. so some will enjoy tjhe action hero heroics
,
but i didn
' t think it fit with the nice tension that was built uv infact the ealier scenes
,
and yhe
" real life
" feel of covert operations in panama
. a owrd must be said on teh camera work
, much ofthe it was very nice
. the jungles of panama
( or theri st
and
- ins in this case
) formed a very picturesque background
.
.
. adn the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography
. many have seen the slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" following tjhe projectile tothe its target
. thsi ws used well in the beginning tothe sohw the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill
. it was dramtic when used in flashback
.
.
.
but it seems teh director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots
( pardon yhe pun
) inot tjhe rela time action
.
.
.
then it just seemed silly
. all infact all
, nto a real dog
: there isnt some nice action
, ogod atmosphere
,
and pretty photography
. bu the plot is pretty lame
, the acting didn
' t form a cohesive whole
,
and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
.
