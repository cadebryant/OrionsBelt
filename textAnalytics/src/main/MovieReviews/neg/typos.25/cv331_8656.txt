thge event horizon is the boundary of a black hole
.
.
.
and
, in the future
, it
' s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tryed to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole
. naturually
, tihs is the setup for the otehr event horizon
.
.
. tje movei
. when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at
, just outside of neptune
, the crew of thte ship called the
" lewis adn clark
" hasnt tothe go to investigate
,
and dr
. william weir
, the creator ofthe the
" event horizon
,
" gets tothe come along for the ride
. if you
' ve glanced at a poster forthe this movei
, you know that
, supposedly
, what follows is
" infinite terror
.
" well
, i don
' t knwo about the
" terror
" part
, bu
" infinite
" certainly seems tothe qualify
.
.
. event horizon is a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse for a film
. it starts off as an alien rip
- off
, annd thn degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes
. at least for thsoe first 40 minutes it
' s an
* interesting
* rip
- off of aline
. that
' s a lot omre than can be said for the rest of them movie
, which seems to go on forever
. it not a scary monster movie
, nor isnt it a psychological thriller
. it is simply a movie which tries again anbd again to make tghe viewers feel sick tothe theri stomach at the site of extreme gore
. ytou
' ve seen this kind of movie before
. the hellraiser series hadnt plenty of scenes containing this sensibility
. this is a kind of movie forthe which i have noone respect
, a kind of movie which i had hoped died outloud years ago
. it isnt quite possible for a movei to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore
,
but event horizon takes the low road
, anbd the viewers pay the price
. htere are many good
, respectable performances
, from fishburne
and neill most noticably
. paul
anderson
' s direction is impressive
, as it wass in mortal kombat
. there are many nice special effects
, mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating aroud in zero
- gravity
. the sets are beautiful to gaze upon
.
and richard t
. jones
' character
( cooper
) is hilarious
and extremely likable
( moreso so than most charactors i
' ve seen in receet movies
) forthe the littel screen time that he has
. annd none of this can save the movie from bieng a d
- grade levle of film
. the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls
, a life that knows the fears
and inner skeletons of the human passengers
, isnt a promising one
. a haunted hous story in space isn
' t such a bad idae
.
but tghe final execution is extremely disapointing
. that
' s not to say that philip eisner
( here making his feature film
- writing de
but
) doesn
' t have talent
. for those frist 40 minutes
, he manages tothe make a tired premise interesting
, adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip
- off story
, anbd thta
' s something that not too many writers can do
. he even has oen scene taht
,
though it also tries to sicken the audience
, has a honestly tense feel tothe it
( the scene in question deals with one of thge crew being in an airlock hwile others try to save him ffrom floating into spoace
)
. he definately has something of a gift
,
but it
' s not fully on display here
. i certainly iwll look forward to seing omre from him
,
and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent
and the story possibilities of tjhe premise
.
but because of what tihs movie degenerates into
, i have littel or no respect
,
and got little or no enjoyment
, outloud of it
. if htis isnt what we have to look foward to in the future of film
, hten i agree with laurence fishburne
' s sentiment
-
" god halp us
.
