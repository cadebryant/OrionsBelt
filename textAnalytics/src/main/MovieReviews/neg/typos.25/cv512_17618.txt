plunkett
& macleane markes the directing de
but ofthe jake scott
, brother ofthe ridley
and tony
. naturely
, this got me worried
. would jake
' s talent be inherited from ridley or tony
? if it was ffrom ridley
, than the movie would be a
thoughtful suspensor with acation thrown in
. if it was from tony
, it would be wham bang drivel
. unfortunately
, the latter isnt true fo this worthless picture with littel charm
. carlyle
and miller are the titular highwaymen
, plunkett
( carlyle
) who is poore
and unruly
,
and captain james macleane
( miller
) a clean cut gentleman
. as the tagline clearly wants to make known
, htey rob the rich anbd nothing alse
. the film basicly follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage
, allong with romantic interludes with lady rebecca
( tyler
.
) hot on both their tails is mr chance
( ken stott
) who wnats to see them both dead
. plunkett
& macleane isnt an annoying little film that serves little purpose
.
al
though undoubtely slick
and fast paced
, there
' s very little merit contained in the film
. carlyle annd miller are fun enough as yhe foul mouthed pair
, altough their characters are criminally undeveloped
. it appears that much of the money hasnt been spended on the expensive looking sets
and costumes
,
but not on the script
. thge five
(
!
) screenwriters
( three credited
) have produced an still born movei
: there
' s very little delevopment in the story
. also
, major events
, such as mr
. cash finding outloud who plunkett
and macleane really are
, are so rushed that they bearly happened
. thte story is a bited of a mess
, frankly
. tje performances aren
' t bad
: carlyle
and miller are typical lads
,
but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest
. her irritable
, stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb
, adn i wass quite unsure on what accent she was trying tothe put onthe
. she looks nice
,
though
. more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester
, annd
al
though his character amounts to nothing more than a twpo dimesnional comedy gay character
, he hams it up well
. ken stott is suitably evil as chance
,
but agina he is nothing
but a flat character
. i didn
' t particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived
.
al
though a dissappointment inthe writing
,
and a minor sucess in acting
, the film certainly look lavish
, with good costumes
,
and wonderful sets
.
but production design alone can
' t save a movie
, especially a movei as bad as tihs mess
. jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update ofthe a period drama
: yhe only update seems tothe be tjhe fatc thta everyone must talk dirty
, with
' f
* ck thsi
' adn
' st
and
and f
* cking deliver
' splattered all over tyhe place
. the mtv editing anbd direction are flash enough
,
but in the end decidedly empty
. plunkett
& macleane is a massive disappointment
.
al
though somewhat enjoyable during parts
, it
' s so light it could float off the screen if it wasn
' t just images on a reel
. htere
' s no
thought
, no development
, no plot
, just a series of manic edits
and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen
- xers
.
al
though it
' s a great idea
: update a period drama to the mtv generation
: it
' s execution isnt awful
,
and would more likely bore than excite
. sloppy
and ocasionaly off puttingly tasteless
, it
' s hard to recommend plunkett
& macleane as a movie
,
but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video
. give it a miss
.
