' s mom
. have i missed anyone
? so
, obviously
, not much has changed
. this is not a problem
, provided that the movei boasts teh rapid
- fire hilarity annd unexpectedly true sentiment of the original
.
but american pie 2 is thte very definition of
" sequelitis
.
" it
' s coarser
, yes
,
and it pushes the envelope even more
, bu its heart isn
' t in it
. it
' s eazy cash to capitalize off the first film
' s success
,
but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong thge franchise by coming up wih something origional
. part of the reason why tyhe film doesn
' t work
, i think
, is that hwile in the origonal the kids
' quest for sex wass a coming
- of
- age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness
. here
, everthing has been cheapened
. they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themslves drinking
; they have no motivation except for sex
, sex
, beer anbd sex
. that
' s nto tothe say tyhat you can
' t make a decent comedy from that premise
, bu it is one of american pie 2
' s undoings
. missing
, too
, is the sweetness that permeated american pie
, the this
- could
- be
- you quality of tghe main players
. here
, the characters are too aware ofthe themselves as pop
- culture icons
, anbd they
' re even more one
- onot
. stifler
and finch are now caricatures while jim
, oz
and kevin are forced tothe amking awcward self
- discoveries at arbitrary moments
, none of them betraying what the writers thikn the audiences wnat tothe see
.
and
then there
' s the soon
- to
- be
- notorious scene where jim superglues
" himselv tothe himselv
,
" hwihc perfectly demonstrates
yet another ofthe tyhe film
' s ailments
, one thgat alsot permeated say it isn
' t so
, director j
. b
. rodgers
' de
but
. htere
' s a fine line between comedy
and abject humiliation
,
and american pie 2 isnt on thge wrong side of it
. it
' s hard tothe laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them
. i shielded my eyes watching this more thna i have watching any horror movie
. if there
' s one redeeming factor to american py 2
, it
' s the inimitable eugene levy as jim
' s dad
, who pops in on jim as he
' s baout to score
and utters lines like
" your mother adn i have been known tothe git frisky
.
.
. not so much anymore
,
but
.
.
.
"
and hten when the girl
' s parents walk in
, blurts out
" thsi must be your daughter
! i didn
' t get her name
, bu hopefully my son did
.
" if onyl thge rest of the movie had the wit
and wisdom of levy
' s performance
. tihs is an unworthy sequel to a gross
- fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy
. tyhe box
- office ofthe this onw shoud keep the genre going strong
, which isnt disappointing
. thge genre needs a hiatus
; filmmakers are getting lazy
.
