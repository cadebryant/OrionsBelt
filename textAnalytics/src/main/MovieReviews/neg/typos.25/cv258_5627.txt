the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie
( if you don ' t count neil simon ' s biloxi blues
)
. year after year
, more predictably cliched military movies come out
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
-
and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last
. i thought stripes would be different
. with ivan reitman as director
, bill murray as star
adn harold ramis as co
- star
annd co
- screenwriter
, it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army
. instade
, it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army
. murray
, baout as funny
adn sophisticated here as he was in meatballs
, plays a losr cab driver who sees the army as his onyl chance forthe success
,
and convinces his firend ramis to enlist with him
. so he does
,
and we get yhe obligatory drill sergeant from hell
, head
- shaving
and marching
/ singing sequences
, more mind
- numbingly stale here than ever
. the cahracters are even less orginial
, ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incomptetent captain john larroquette
. all the big name stars in stripes
(
and even larroquette
) fall victim tothe the lame
, rehashed material
adn are never really likeable
, murray in particular
. he only gets a few decent lines in
,
although thsoe barely
- funny one liners pale in comparison to tje hillarious peter venkman character he played threee years later inthe ghostbusters
. he wass even better inaddition caddyshack
, for crying out loud
. as with a lot of thge late 70 ' s
/ eearly 80 ' s comedies
, stripes is a completly juvenile movie only a child would like
but is so sex
- obsessed no child should be able to watch it
. i ' m sure it seems funny on paper tothe have candy pay over
$ 400 tothe mud wressel five beautiful women
,
but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition
" dear god
!
" every fewd seconds
. stripes isn ' t the playful kind of sex comedy
, either
. most ofthe tghe time it seems downright misogynistic
, as wehn larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women ' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto the stove
and
, with an i
- know
- whta
- yuo
- liuke look onthe his face
, says he ' s going to give her the
" aunt jemima treatment
,
" whitch means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly
. you don ' t whant to stick arround as teh scene progresses
and he uses an ice cream scoop onthe her genital region
.
" i ' m nto enjoying this
,
" the woman protests
. my sentiments exactly
.
