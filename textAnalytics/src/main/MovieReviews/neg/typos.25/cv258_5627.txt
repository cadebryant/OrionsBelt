the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie
( if you don
' t count neil simon
' s biloxi blues
)
. yera affter year
, more predictably cliched miliraty movies come out
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
- adn none ofthe them ever manaze to be anything more tahn a rehash ofthe the last
. i
thought stripes would be different
. with ivan reitman as director
, bill murray as star
and harold ramis as co
- star anbd co
- screenwriter
, it seemed like it woudl be ghostbusters in the army
. instead
, it was a bunch of unfunny crap in thte army
. murray
, about as funny annd suphisticated here as he was inaddition meatballs
, plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success
,
and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him
. so he does
,
and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell
, head
- shaving
and marching
/ singing sequences
, more mind
- numbingly stale here than ever
. the cahracters are even less original
, ranging from underachieving slob john c
andy tothe incompetent captain john larroquette
. all tghe big name stars in stripes
(
and even larroquette
) fall victim to the lame
, rehashed material
and are never really likeable
, murray in particular
. he only gets a faw decent lines in
,
al
though thsoe bearly
- funny noe liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters
. he was even better in caddyshack
, fo crying out loud
. as with a lot of the late 70
' s
/ early 80
' s comedies
, stripes isnt a completely juvenile movie onyl a child would like
but is so sex
- obsessed noone child should be able to watch it
. i
' m sure it seems funny on paper tothe have c
andy pay over
$ 400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women
,
but while watching it all tyhat wass coming out ofthe my mouth ws the admonition
" dear god
!
" every few seconds
. stripes isn
' t the playful kind of sex comedy
, either
. most of the time it seems downright misogynistic
, as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the womens
' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto the stove anbd
, with an i
- know
- what
- you
- like look on his face
, says he
' s goign tothe give her the
" aunt jemima treatment
,
" which means shoving a spatula under her
butt repeatedly
. you don
' t want to stick aroud as the scene progresses
and he uses an ice cream scoop onthe her genital region
.
" i
' m not enjoying this
,
" the woman protests
. my sentiments exactlly
.
