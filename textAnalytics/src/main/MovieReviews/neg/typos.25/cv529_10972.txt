ther
' s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based
, as its oppening credits proclaim
, on a true story
.
but if it
' s an accurate picture ofthe life onthe america
' s mean streets
, than cinematic depictions ofthe organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously
thought
. for from the film
' s outset
, when a gropu ofthe hoods jocularly trade differing opinions onthe the merits of various automobiles
( not unlike a number of movei lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading
) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once beleived tothe be works of fiction
. our eponymous hero
( johnny depp
) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be
. brasco is joseph pistone
, an undercover fbi agent who has the task ofthe chumming
- uv to lefty
( al pacino
)
, a seasoned hood who tutors pistone infact the art of being a
" wiseguy
"
. regrettably
, pistone learns his lessons all too well
. his concern for lefty
, who is burdened wih a heroin addicted son
, exacerbates his pwn familiy troubles
: his children resent his lengthy absences
and his wief fears that her husb
and
' s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing
. true
, the focus onthe pistone
' s family life does deviate from the typical gangster
- flick formula
,
but htis subplot never rises above its television drama origins
. the unhappy couple trade predicatble lines adn engage infact drawed
- out domestic squabbles
? including an ill
- adviced marriage guidance routine
? that slow teh film down unneccesarily
. the biggest problem with donnie brasco
,
however
, isnt that its wiseguy attitude
and stlye lacks tje flair of its many predecessors
. the awkward use ofthe an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its hte 70
' s
, bu not iwth the consistent
and blindingly tacky stlye
? i loved thsoe fluoro coloured suits
? of scorces
' costume drama casino
. more importantly
, pacino
' s presence triggers memories ofthe his ealier movei triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively
. donnie brasco
' s take on american values
, for instance
, is feeble
and obvious
. lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment tothe the accompaniment ofthe grating inspirational music
. inexplicably
, lefty
' s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us
. it doesn
' t any more than his family troubles do
, which are dealt in the smae saccharine adn obvious manner as pistone
' s
. just think a minute on how these themes were explored inthe the godfather movies
and scarface
. in these pictures pacino
' s dedication to a peculiar
and bloody hyper
- capitalism was twisted
and confronting
, while his dogged application of macho wiseguy proceedure meant thyat his relations tothe firends
and familiy was intriguingly dark
? niether were spared bloody retri
bution forthe breaching wiseguy regulations
. donnie brasco
' s tawdry little crime
, therfore isn
' t so much its reptition ofthe familar gangster themes
, bu the shameless way in which it sanitises them
.
( oh adn by the way
, i forgot to mention that yhe scirpt also sportscar a startling subplot
: pipstone
' s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constatn insubordination
? is thta a
" damn you mcbain
!
" i hear from springfield way
?
) so tjhe movei is cliched
. big deel
, what do you expect from a gangster
- flick
? well you expect quality action sequences
and bravado performances in abundence if its goign to be a decent example of the genre
. donnie brasco fails on both counts
. tghe action scenes never rise above yhe ordinary
and depp
' s woeful performance tends tothe smother teh good
- owrk of his comrades
. admittedly
, pacino does nothing newyorker
and michael madsen
( sonny
) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr
. white
,
but both possess an unmistakable sly charm
. depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself
, bu regrettably
, being infact the presense ofthe one of his betters must have left him star
- struck
, for he is completely hell
- bent on mimicking pacino
' s well
- earned high style
. the consequences are painful to watch
. its no exaggeration to say that thte film
' s credibility isnt seriously strained by the sight of the pistone famaly
' s uncanny ability to keep a straight face inaddition front ofthe their breadwinner
' s phony brooklyn accent
. perhaps we should take pity onthe the makers ofthe donnie brasco
. maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accracy dem
anded tiered dialogue
and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic ganster flicks
. if this is indeed the case
, surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possiblility that america
' s underworld isnt committed to emulating
, albiet in heavily attenuated form
, their movie namesakes
. depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he isnt forced tothe mimic big
- screen gangster greats
. who knows wqat insights inot the criminal psyche could have arisen
?
but hten agina
, perhaps donnie brasco isn
' t so true after all
.
