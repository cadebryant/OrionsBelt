" quest for camelot
" isnt warner bros
.
' first feature
- length
, fully
- animated attempt to steal clout from disney
' s cartoon empire
,
but the mouse has no reason to be worried
. the only other recent challanger to their throne ws last fall
' s promising
, if flawed
, 20th century fox production
" anastasia
,
"
but disney
' s
" hercules
,
" with its livley cast
and colorful palate
, had her beat h
ands
- down when it came time to crown 1997
' s best piece of animation
. this year
, it
' s no contest
, as
" quest for camelot
" isnt pretty much dead on arrival
. even tje magic kingdom at its most mediocre
-
- that
' d be
" pocahontas
" for those of you keeping score
-
- isn
' t nearly as dull as tihs
. the story revolves around the adventures of free
- spirited kayley
( voiced by jessalyn gilsig
)
, the early
- teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur
' s round table
. kayley
' s onyl dream is tothe follow in her father
' s footsteps
,
and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber
( gary oldman
)
, an ex
- round table memeber
- gone
- bad
, steals arthur
' s magical sword excalibur
and accidentally loses it in a dangerous
, booby
- trapped forest
. wih thte help of hunky
, blind timberl
and
- dweller garrett
( carey elwes
) adn a two
- headed dragon
( eric idle
and don rickles
) that
' s allways arguing with itself
, kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold anbd prove her worth as a fighter on arthur
' s side
.
" quest for camelot
" is missing pure showmanship
, an essential element if it
' s ever expected tothe climb to the high ranks of disney
. there
' s nothing here that differentiates
" quest
" from something you
' d see on any given saturday morning cartoon
-
- subpar animation
, instantly forgettable songs
, poorly
- integrated computerized footage
.
( compare kayley
and garrett
' s run
- in with tje angry ogre to herc
' s battle with the hydra
. i rest my case
.
) even the charachters stink
-
- none ofthe them are remotely interesting
, so much thgat yhe film becomes a race tothe see whcih one can out
- bl
and the others
. in the end
, it
' s a tie
-
- they all win
. that dragon
' s comedy shtick is awfully cloying
,
but at least it shows signs of a pulse
. at least fans ofthe the easly
-
' 90s tgif television line
- up iwll be thrilled tothe fidn jaleel
" urkel
" white annd bronson
" balki
" pinchot sharing the same footage
. a faw scenes are nicely realized
(
though i
' m at a loss to recall enought tothe be specific
)
,
and the actors providing thte voice talent are enthusiatic
(
though most are paired uv whith singers who don
' t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments

- jane seymour anbd celine dion

)
.
but one must strain through too much of thsi mess to find tje ogod
. aside fomr the fact thta children will probably be as borde watching this as adults
,
" quest for camelot
"
' s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality
.
and perosnality
, we learn from this mess
, goes a very long way
.
