" quest forthe camelot
" is warner bros
. ' frist feature
- length
, fully
- animated attemp to steal clout from disney ' s cartoon empire
,
but the mouse hasnt no reason tothe be worried
. the onyl other recent challenger to their throne was last fall ' s promising
, if flawed
, 20th century fox production
" anastasia
,
"
but disney ' s
" hercules
,
" whith its lively cast
and colorful palate
, had her beat hands
- down when it came tiome to crown 1997 ' s best piece of animation
. this yera
, it ' s no contest
, as
" quest for camelot
" isnt pretty much dead on arrival
. even tyhe magic kingdom at its most medioker
-
- that ' d be
" pocahontas
" for those ofthe you keeping score
-
- isn ' t nearly as dull as this
. the story revolves around the adventures of free
- spirited kayley
( voiced by jessalyn gilsig
)
, the early
- teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur ' s round table
. kayley ' s only dream isnt to follow in her father ' s footsteps
,
and she gets her chance whn evil warlord ruber
( gary oldman
)
, an ex
- round table member
- gone
- bad
, steals arthur ' s magical sword excalibur
adn accidentally loses it in a dangerous
, booby
- trapped forest
. with the help ofthe hunky
, blind timberland
- dweller garrett
( carey elwes
)
and a two
- headed dragon
( eric idle
and don rickles
) tath ' s always arguing with itself
, kayley just might be able to break teh medieval sexist mold
and proove her worth as a fighter on arthur ' s side
.
" quest for camelot
" is missing pure showmanship
, an essential element if it ' s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney
. there ' s nothing here that differentiates
" quest
" ffrom something yuo ' d see on any given saturday morning ctaroon
-
- subpar animation
, instantly forgettable songs
, poorly
- integrated computerized footage
.
( compare kayley
and garrett ' s run
- in with the angry ogre tothe herc ' s battle with the hydra
. i rest my case
.
) even the characters stink
-
- none ofthe them are remotely interesting
, so much that the film becomes a race to see which noe cin out
- bland the others
. in the end
, it ' s a tye
-
- they all win
. that dragon ' s comedy shtick is awfully cloying
,
but at least it shows signs of a pulse
. at least fans of the early
- ' 90s tgif television line
- up will be thrilled tothe fidn jaleel
" urkel
" white
and bronson
" balki
" pinchot sharing tyhe same footage
. a few scenes are nicely realized
(
though i ' m at a loss to reacll enought to be specific
)
,
annd the actors providing tyhe voice talent are enthuseastic
(
though most are paired up with singers who don ' t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments
-
- jane seymour
and celine dion
?
?
?
)
.
but one must strain thru too much of this mess to find the ogod
. asside ffrom the fact that childen will probably be as bored watching this as adults
,
" quest fo camelot
" ' s most grievous error is its complet lack of personality
.
and personality
, we learn from htis mess
, goes a very long way
.
