and tje odd parental
, popcorn perched baout their persons
)
, who positively cheered when the end credits rolled
( ah the film had struck a lovley nerve whith them
but not whith fuddy
- duddy ood me
)
. well
, i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well
and truly over
, bu that would have been too obvious
. too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall
' s film
( garry made a couple of other
" princess
" movies
-
-
" pretty woman
"
and
" runaway bride
"
-

but tihs one
' s way without julia roberts so maybe
* that

. in addition tothe being predictable as molasses
,
" the princess diaries
" hasnt hardly got a laugh inwhich it
( it
' s a comedy
)
, could bore the pants off an abyssinian fo long
, long stretches
, annd is so sloppily edited thte principals refer to scenes we haven
' t even seen
yet
(
and probably never will except
, perhaps
, in the dvd edition
)
. marshall should take virtually all of the blame here
, since he
' s beeen at this fo some time adn should know when a scene or two isn
' t working

, a bright
but socially invisible san fransiscan teen who lerans that her single mom
( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall
) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of smoe miniscule european country nobody ever heard ofthe
( yhe filmmakers go outloud ofthe their way
* nto
* to call it serbia
, whitch is pretty much what all miniscule european countires are called in the movies mark my words
)
and nowe she

, is next inthe line tothe rule
