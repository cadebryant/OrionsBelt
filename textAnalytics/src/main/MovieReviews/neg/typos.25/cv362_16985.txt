( pun intended
. thank ytou
!
) varsity blues ws produced by mtv
, adn it really shows
. several extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adlescent male audience this crap was intended for
. the teenagers all hvae reasons fo thier melodramatic angst
. the adults all have problems
, ofthe course
,
and
, as oen
- dimensional characters
, they are all fanatically obssessed with how theri local high school football team performs
. yes
, this movie represents high skool life infact mtv

" who would want tothe
?
) jon voight

, suprize
, thge stock evil guy here
. bu is he realyl evil
, or is he a product of society
? aftter all
, everybody
, young
and old
, in this movie has no life whatsoever
and do nothing bu obssess over high school footbal
. mabye thge pressures ofthe the 90 screaming fans at tjhe football field drove evil coach kilmer evil
. the film
' s screenplay never answers this burning question
. at times
, iliff
' s story doens show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes
,
but
, before the audience gets their hopes uv tath there might be something redeeming in thsi movei
, they git trashed iwth another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game
. teh movei
' s pacing is slow
,
and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from strat tothe finish
. i supose i
' m being a little hard on varisty blues
. maybe i
' m just a little miffed taht i hadnt tothe pay 3 bucks tothe see it
, even
though it was dollar night at the cinema
. something baout a request fomr the studio made the theater charge more money
. i found the film oftentimes ludicrous
and boring
. three guys iin front of us smuggled beer into the the theather
. i wished i had
thought of thta
. alcohol
, lots of it
, may have helped tghe viewing experience
