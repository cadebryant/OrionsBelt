don
' t let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs ofthe william shakespeare
. no one will truley underst
and the heart anbd soul of this man except through his work
,
and this movie makes a vain attempt at that
. any moves to
? glamorise
' his life
, which hollywood has an annoying tendency tothe dont
, will onyl subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness
. this movie about his life
, all
though well written
, puts too much make
- up on a man whose life was probably more pork
and ptatoes
, rather than lobster
and champagne
. oh well
, let
' s fantasise onwards an asume that he was a bited ofthe a flirtatious play
- wriet
, who falls in lveo wtih a beautifull woman
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and from her insperation
, several plays develop
-
? romeo
and juliet
'
,
and
? the twelfth nihgt
'
. it isnt easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream adn that
' s how all his plays develope
,
but please spare me all of this unecessary meledrama
.
but i guess my version probably wouldn
' t draw a crowd or amke a dollar on screen
. so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare
, when all we need tothe do is read his work in order to find his soul
. i think not
. as for teh oscars weere they deserved by this movie
? i think not
. infact many aspestus
? private ryan
'
and
? life isnt beautiful
' weere far superior movies
,
but one should never asume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar
, as time
and agian
, for reasons unexplained
, an undeserving movie will win the acolade
. another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead
, over a more polished cate
,
but i guess if you go on enough about your gr
andfather dying adn your nephew being hospitalised
- peple will start feeling sory fo ytou
