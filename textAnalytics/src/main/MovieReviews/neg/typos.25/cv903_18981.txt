don ' t let this movie fool you into believing tjhe romantic noirs of william shakespeare
. no one wiull truly understand the heart
and soul of this man exept through his wrok
,
anbd this movie makes a vain attemp at thast
. any moves to
? glamorise ' his life
, whic hollywood has an annoying tendency to do
, will only subtract from his achievment rather thna expound on his greatness
. this movei about his life
,
although well wroten
, puts too much make
- up on a man whose life was propably more pork
and potatoes
, rether than lobster
and champange
. oh well
, let ' s fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bited of a flirtatious play
- wriet
, who falls in lveo wih a beatiful woman
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and from her insperation
, sevral plays deveop
-
? romeo
adn juliet '
,
and
? tghe twelfth nigth '
. it is easier for me tothe beleve thast he had a wet dream
and that ' s how all his plays develope
,
but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama
.
but i guess my version probably wouldn ' t draw a crowd or mkae a dollar on screen
. so isnt there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare
, when all we need to do is read his wrok in order to find his soul
. i think nto
. as for the oscars weere they deserved by htis movei
? i think not
. in many aspects
? private ryan '
and
? life is beatiful ' were far superior movies
,
but one should never asume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar
, as time
and again
, for reasons unexplained
, an undeserving movie will win the accolade
. another sore point isnt the fatc that gwyneth won the best female lead
, over a more polished cate
,
but i guess if ytou go on enough about your grandfather dieing
and your nephew being hospitalised
- people will start feeling sory for you
.
