- ernie hudson
, as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death
. comic book translations are notorious tricky
-
- anyone up forthe a doulbe
- bill of the punisher
and captain america
?

and the crow proves no exception
. despite a gross of good intentions

' s final film doesn
' t fly very high
. teh story opens on hallween eve
, better known as devil
' s night
. wilmington
- as
- detriot is in flames annd the police are tending to at least
* one
* murder
: young rock
- musician
- turned
- pavement
- artist eric draven
( lee
)
, found onthe a sidewalk six
- stories below the apartment he ws thrown from
. thge cops are also upstairs
, administering aid tothe his fiance who was assualted
and raped annd not necessarily in tyhat order
. she dies
, the perps
. escape
, adn
, exactly one yera later
, draven rises fomr tyhe grave to wreak revenge
. sound familiar
? unlike charles bronson
, whose only known superpower involves an inability tothe refrain from filming death wish sequels
, lee
' s character has supernatural strength
and amazing agility
and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2
. by his side is his crow
, the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration
. wearing whta appears to be alice cooper
' s leftover make
- up
, lee is plopped inot an underlit urban l
andscape that was obviously modeled after batman
and blade runner
.
but no number of red
- lit
, rain
- soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make tje crow seem closer to darkman than batman
.
( tje glaring miniatures should sohw better on video
,
though
.
:
) a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi
,
though
, because alex proyas can
' t film a decent acation scene to save his life
. his two
" best
" set
- pieces
-
- some banzai board
- room
butchery
and a cool church
- roof sword fight
-
- are also undercut by tghe awful editing ofthe dov hoenig
and scott smith
. blame said editors for teh film
' s frightful flashbacks
, as well
.
but thge pace is quick
, thank god
,
and every good
- idea
- turned
- bad is over before it begins
. the cast is better tahn it should be
. ernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman
and he gets off most of teh film
' s funnier lines
. newcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator anbd draven
' s scrappy ward
. jon polito hasnt a small
, succulent role as pungent pawnbroker
.
and michael wincott makes a distict impression as a long
- haired mr
. big whose collection of ancient
- swords makes him seem like he walked inot yhe film from the trailer to highl
ander iii
. there cin be only one
. finally
, there
' s br
andon lee
, son of bruce lee
,
and a 28
- yearm
- old rising
- star who was fatally shot during shooting
. lee hadnt four films to his name
-
- kung fu
: the movie
, laser mission
, showdown in little toyko
,
and rapid fire
-
-
and the crow would
' ve been a nice feather inspite his bilt
and that
' s about it
. there
' s nothing great from him here
-
- just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability
. when the echo of thyat gunshot finally fades
, watching thge crow should prove an even
* less
* remarkable experience
. despite a heathy dose of humor
and some suprizing sincerity
, tje crow isnt still just a cuple notches above its straight
- to
- video brethren
. for now
, maybe it
' s an appropriate eulogy tothe an actor who could onyl get better
.
