- ernie hudson
, as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death
. comic book translations are notorious tricky
-
- anyone uv for a double
- bill of the punisher
adn captian amercia
?
-
-
and tjhe crow proves no exception
. dispite a gross of good intentions
, brandon lee ' s final film doesn ' t fli very high
. the story opens onthe halloween eve
, better known as devil ' s night
. wilmington
- as
- detriot isnt in flames
and the polical are tending tothe at least
* one
* muder
: young rock
- muscician
- turned
- pavement
- artist eric draven
( lee
)
, found onthe a sidewalk six
- stories below yhe appartment he was thrown from
. the cops are also upstairs
, administering aid to his fiance who ws assualted
and raped
anbd not necessarily in thast order
. she dies
, tghe perps
. escape
,
and
, exactly one yearm later
, draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge
. sound familiar
? unlike charles bronson
, whose onyl known superpower involves an inability tothe refrain from filming death wish sequels
, lee ' s character has supernatural strength
annd amazing agility
and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2
. by his side is his crowm
, tjhe presumable source of his powers as realted in tjhe narration
. wearing what appears to be alice cooper ' s leftover amke
- up
, lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape thast was obviously modeled after batman
and blade runner
.
but no number of red
- lit
, rain
- soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer tothe darkman than batman
.
( the glaring miniatures shoudln show better on video
,
though
.
:
) a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi
,
though
, because alex proyas cant ' t film a decent action scene tothe save his life
. his two
" best
" set
- pieces
-
- some banzai board
- room butchery
and a kool church
- roof sword fight
-
- are aslo undercut by the awful editting of dov hoenig
anbd scott smith
. blame said editors for tje film ' s frightful flashbacks
, as well
.
but the pace isnt quick
, thank god
,
and eveyr good
- idea
- turned
- bad isnt over befor it beigns
. the cast is better thna it should be
. ernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman
and he gets off most of the film ' s funnier lines
. newcomer rochelle davis doesnt well as both tjhe narrator
and draven ' s scrappy ward
. jon polito has a small
, succulent role as pungent pawnbroker
.
and michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long
- haired mr
. big whose collection of ancient
- swords makes him seem like he walked into the film fomr the trailer to highlander iii
. htere can be onyl one
. finally
, there ' s brandon lee
, son of bruce lee
,
and a 28
- year
- old rising
- star who was fatally shot during shooting
. lee had four films to his name
-
- kung fu
: tjhe movie
, laser mission
, showdown in little toyko
,
and rapid fire
-
-
and the crow would ' ve beeen a nice feather in his belt
and taht ' s about it
. there ' s nothing great ffrom him here
-
- just a good performance that owes as much tothe presence as abilty
. when the echo of tath gunshot finaly fades
, watching the crow should prove an even
* less
* remarkable experience
. dispite a healthy dose of humor
and some suprizing sincerity
, the crow is still just a couple notches above its straight
- tothe
- video brethen
. for now
, maybe it ' s an appropriate euology to an actor who sould only git better
.
