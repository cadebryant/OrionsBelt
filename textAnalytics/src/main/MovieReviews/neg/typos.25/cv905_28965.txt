, captain leo davidson
( mark wahlberg
,
" boogie nights
"
) isnt training
' his
' chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station
. when an electromagnetic storm is encountered
and pericles
' pod is lost
, davidson sets out unathorised anbd l
ands thous
ands of years in the future on the
" planet of the apes
.
" maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr
.

and lawrence konner
& mark d
. rosenthal
(
" mighty joe young
"
)
. director tim burton
' s unique look
and sytle are nowhere to be found in this silly
, pointless remake
. davidson no sooner l
ands than he finds hismelf being swarmed by savages running inaddition terror
, whom he wisely joins
.
however
, he
' s rounded uv withthe thte lot of them by tje apes which rule this plant
and h
anded over to slave trader limbo
( paul giamatti
,
" duets

)
. ari
( helena bonham carter
,
" fight club
"
)
, duaghter of the illustrious senator s
andar
( david warner
,
" titanic
"
)
and simian bleeding heart
, believes humans should live with apes onthe equal st
anding
, an unpopular notion
. she takes a liking to leo
, who she deems
' unusual
.
' genaral thade
( tim roth
,
" lucky numbers
"
) is ofthe the oposite opinyon
, wishing for declaration of martial law that iwll allow him tothe annihilate the race
. he
' s sweet onthe ari
. it
' s relatively easy tothe see where this
' newyorker
' story is going ffrom the onset
,
yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes
. tje much ballyhooed
' surprize
' ending is a nonsensical let down
. an attempt at a love triangle
, conveyed by ari annd the human daena
( estella warren
,
" driven
"
) giving each other
' back off
' looks over leo
, fails baceause he never develops a relationship wih either of them
. the lone sex scene is soem hilarious foreplay between elder orangatang senator nado
( glenn shadix
)
and his trophy wife nova
( burton
' s squeeze
, lisa marie
)
. guffaws will also likely greet charlton heston
' s cameo as thade
' s father
, the one ape harboring a firearm
(
!
) who sputters some very familliar lines before dying
. the only real success of the 2001
" planet of the apes
" is rick baker
' s makeup
,
and even thast
' s an iffy afair
. noone attempt was made tothe change the human whiteness of the actors
' eyes
, a real distraction amidst smoe otherwise impressive work
. roth
, warner
and michael clarke duncan
( as thade
' s right h
and man attar
) are given the most impressive makeovers
. giamatti looks more liuke a skull tahn an ape
and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal
. tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body lanugage right
- his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about
, most spectacularly wehn mounting his steed
,
but even
' s he
' s undone by some obvious wire work
. bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic
,
but is undone inthe turn by hte silliness of teh writing
. most of the film has a set binded look which no amount of mist can cover
. the ape
' s city resembles a dank complex of tree houses
. the apes
' military costumes
( colleen atwood
,
" sleepy hollow
"
) as well as thier feild tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka
' s wrok on coppola
' s
" dracula
.
" that oriental flavor is aslo found iin danny elfman
' s tribal
, percussive score
.
" planet ofthe the apes
" was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001
, a dismal movie season that
' s going to tjhe dogs
.
