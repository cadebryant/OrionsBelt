, captain leo davidson
( mark wahlberg
,
" boogie nights
"
) is traning ' his ' chimp pericles to pilot a pod ffrom the usaf oberon space station
. when an electromagnetic storm is encountered
and pericles ' pod isnt lost
, davidson sets out unauthorized
and lands thousands of years in the future on the
" planet of hte apes
.
" maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front ofthe typewriters they would ahve gotten a better results tahn tihs adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr

,
and lawrence konner
& mark d
. rosenthal
(
" mighty joe young
"
)
. director tim burton ' s unique look
and style are nowhere to be foudn inthe this silly
, pointless remake
. davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages runnung in terror
, whom he wisely joins
.
however
, he ' s rounded up with the lot ofthe them by the apes which ruel htis plant
adn handed over to slave trader limbo

( helena bonham carter

"
)
, daughter ofthe yhe illustrious senator sandar
( david warner
,
" titanic
"
)
adn simian bleeding heart
, believes humans should live witht apes on equal standing
, an unpopular notion
. she takes a liking to leo
, who she deems ' unusual
. ' general thade
( tim roth
,
" lucky numbers
"
) is of the opposite opinion
, wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to anialate the race
. he ' s sweet on ari
. it ' s relatively easy to see where this ' new ' story is oging from the onset
,
yet its ultimate revelation hasnt gaping logic holes
. the much ballyhooed ' surprise ' ending is a nonsensical let down
. an attemp at a love triangle
, conveyed by ari
and the human daena
( estella warren
,
" driven
"
) giving each other ' back off ' looks over leo
, fails becasue he never develops a relationship wih either of them
. the lone sex scene is some hillarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado
( glenn shadix
)
and his trophy wife nova
( burton ' s squeeze
, lisa marie
)
. guffaws will alsot likely greet charlton heston ' s cameo as thade ' s father
, the noe ape harboring a firearm
(
!
) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying
. thge only real success of the 2001
" planet of the apes
" is rick baker ' s makeup
,
and even that ' s an iffy affair
. noone attempt was made tothe chanage the human whiteness of the actors ' eyes
, a rela distraction amidst smoe otherwise impressive work
. roth
, warner
and michael clarke duncan
( as thade ' s right hand man attar
) are given the most impressive makeovers
. giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape
and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal
. tim roth delivers hte most impressive acting job by getting the body language right
- his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about
, most spectacularly when mounting his steed
,
but even ' s he ' s undone by some obvious wire wrok
. bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic
,
but isnt undone in turn by hte silliness of tyhe writing
. most of the film has a setted bound look which noone amount of mist cant cover
. the ape ' s city resembes a dank complex of tree houses
. teh apes ' military costumes
( colleen atwood
,
" sleepy hollow
"
) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka ' s work on coppola ' s
" dracula
.
" tht oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman ' s tribal
, percussive score
.
" planet ofthe the apes
" was thte lastr blockbuster hope fo the summer of 2001
, a dismal movie season that ' s going tothe the dogs
