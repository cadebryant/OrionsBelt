well if yuo are up forthe stellar effects
then thsi is thte movie for you
. because thats all that there really is
.
.
.
. i foudn that after watching this movie it had many many gaps
and flaws in simple logic in the plot
. for one thing
, a white leading actor who has a black daughter doens leave some curiocity
.
.
.
. i am not saying that this isn ' t possible
.
.
but it doesnt leave one to wonder
.
.
. i nkow i did
. another thing is that this movei has sections whihc are painfully stretched out
.
.
.
.
and ceratin scenes are repeated essentially
bu with slight variations
. there was one scene that should have beeen short
.
.
.
but it was horribly stretched
and somewhere inthe the middle of it i found mysef thikning
.
. ok enought already get on witht it
. there are allso times where ytou have to wonder why things happen the way they do
.
.
. things just magicaly ahppen
and there isnt noone prelude or anything of the sort
.
.
. another thing that i noticed towards the end ws that smoe characters jsut vanished without a trace
but they weere fairly major through most of the beginning
. tihs movie is also very predicatble
.
.
. you cant allmost tell tjhe fianl stry somewhere in teh middle
anbd you definitely know what will happen at a given moment
.
. granted this is hard tothe omit
but here its just blatent it sits htere
and stares at you
. also some of the things that happen are a littel too predictable
and severeal cliques are repeated
.
.
. it gets boring at times to tell you tghe truth
.
.
. even
though there is still action going on
. another little point i might add isnt that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematican nto some shoot them up type of hero
. some of tje charachters are nto proper for their roles
. the acting isnt fine
but the characters just don ' t seem to add up
. if i was to base my review totally on the plot
hten i wouldn ' t rate htis movei too highly
but that ' s just tghe thing this movie isn ' t just the plot
, its thte whole package
and this package is really well done
. the whole movie is really well done
and looks realy ogod
and if one ws tothe overlook the flaws infact the plot
and characters
then this is really a movie
. the spacial effects are just amazing
, you cxan ' t tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live
, in a few instances of course you know its fake
but there are otehr times that you jsut wouldn ' t be able tothe say that thte creature wasn ' t there during filming
, extinct or not
. another thing is the destruction scenes
.
.
. wow
, those were masterpieces
.
. well some of them were they were well choreographed
adn allong iwth the dino ' s make this one ofthe the reasons tothe see this movie
. this movie is fairly long
bu it is action packed so it should do well in the box office
.
. unfortunately it wiull take awya from fifth element
but alas what can we do
.
. i may be too cynical for my age
but this movie isnt onyl worth seeing for the effects
annd for it few funny moments
.
. go see it in a matinee if you realy must see it its nto worth full price if you ask me
. one little side note
,
although my oppinion of this movie may not hve beeen the best the way that this movie was marketed
and how many theaters it was shown inwhich toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid
, there were 10 theater movie theaters that were palying thsi movie around the clock i think that some people relaly want monay badly
.
.
.
.
and i think that this type ofthe activity hurts the movie industry let the otehr movies also have a chance
.
.
.
. you nkow any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movei ever made
.
.
.
.
. i thought i ' d put this here to deflate the movei hype about htis flick
.
.
. its not that bad a movei
bu its not that gerat either hope ytou people realize tihs
.
