well if ytou are up for stellar effects
then htis isnt tjhe movie forthe you
. becouse thats all that there really isnt
.
.
.
. i foudn that after watching this movie it had many many gaps
and flaws in simple logic in the plot
. fo oen thing
, a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiousity
.
.
.
. i am not saying that this isn
' t possible
.
.
but it does leave one to wonder
.
.
. i know i did
. another thing is that this movie has sections wich are painfully stretched outloud
.
.
.
. anbd certain scenes are repeated essentialy bu with slight varations
. there was one scene that should have been short
.
.
.
but it was horribly stretched adn somwhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking
.
. ok enough alread git on with it
. there are also times where you have to wonder why thnigs ahppen the way they dont
.
.
. thigsn jsut magically appen
and htere is noone prelude or anything ofthe tje sort
.
.
. anyother hting that i noticed towords the end was that some charachters just vanished without a trace bu they were fairly major thru most ofthe tjhe begginning
. thsi movie is also very predictable
.
.
. yuo can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle
and you definitly know what will happn at a given moment
.
. granted this is hard to omit
but here its just blatant it sits there
and stares at ytou
. aslo smoe of tjhe things that happn are a little too predictable
and several cliques are repeated
.
.
. it gets boring at times to tell you the truth
.
.
. even
though htere is still action going on
. another little point i might add isnt that tje main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematican not some shoot them up tipe ofthe hero
. soem of tjhe characters are nto proper for thier roles
. the acting isnt fine
but the characters jsut don
' t seem to add up
. if i was to base my review totally on tyhe plot
then i wouldn
' t rate this movie too highly
but that
' s jsut the thing this movie isn
' t just the plot
, its the whole package
and this package is really well done
. the whole movie is really well done
and looks really good
and if one was to overlook the flaws infront the plot
and cahracters
then this isnt raelly a movie
. thge special effects are jsut amazing
, you can
' t tell that teh dinosaurs are creaeted it looks like tehy were there live
, in a faw instances of course you know its fake
but there are other times that you just wouldn
' t be able to sday thyat thte creature wasn
' t there during filming
, extinct or nto
. anohter thing is the destruction scenes
.
.
. wow
, those were masterpieces
.
. well some ofthe them were htey were well choreographed
and along with the dino
' s amke tihs one of the reasons tothe see this movie
. tihs movie isnt fairly long
but it isnt acation packed so it should do well in the box office
.
. unfortunately it will tkae awya from fifth element bu alas what can we do
.
. i may be too cynical for my age
but this movei is only worth seeing fo the effects
and forthe it few funny moments
.
. go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me
. oen little side note
,
al
though my opinyon ofthe tihs movie may not have been tjhe best thge way that thsi movie was marketed
and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid
, there were 10 theather movie theaters tyhat weere playing this movie arround the clock i htikn tyhat some people really want monye badly
.
.
.
.
and i htikn that this type of activity hurts the movei industry let the other movies also have a chance
.
.
.
. you know any movie with that much play owudl succeed even if it ws the worst movie ever made
.
.
.
.
. i
thought i
' d put this here to deflate hte movie hype about this flick
.
.
. its nto that bad a movie
but its not that great eather hope yuo people realize this
.
