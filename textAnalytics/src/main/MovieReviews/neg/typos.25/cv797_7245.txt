be warned
.
. brit love stroy in the offing
. effeminate
, mild
- mannered karl is about to tkae a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at skool as he bathes himself under a shower
, his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite
. he is only jsut saved by prentice
, who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average strent
- wise punk
- in
- the
- makeing
. the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed anbd hten unfairly expelled from teh school
. they do not see each otehr for another eighteen yeas
. infront that time
, prentice has matured inot a somewhat loveable
, if brash anbd bull
- heaed goon who screws up his jobs
and relationships hwile gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets
, motorcycles
and punk rock music
. karl
, onthe tyhe other h
and
, hasnt grown up to become kim
, a drabby
, insecure woman who works as a verse writer fo a greeting card company
. chance brings the twpo together
,
and love
, such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy
, isnt what this skewed littel story is largley baout
. if at thsi point ytou think you
' re going to get any cheap laughs with that gender
- bending theme
( see the birdcage
, to wong foo
.
.
.
, priscilla queen of teh desert
)
, you can just go home
and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality ytou low
- life deadbeat
. kim is a post
- operative transsexual
, thank you vyer much
.
.
. a new
- born woman for all purposes
, with confusions
and sensitivities tath deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy
. personally
, give me those cheap laughs any day
. i
' d rether enjoy obvious camp than indure tghe shallow exploration of a soft
- hearted transsexual love stroy
. different for girls comes uv with a promising enough propostion
, bu doesnt nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it
. by refusing tothe make thte audience really uncomfortable with tjhe notion ofthe kim annd prentice
' s relation
- ship
, or at tyhe very least feel uncomfortable for them
( prentice for example
, doesn
' t seem to give hiself all that much grief wehn he becomes attracted tothe kim despite bieng a fight
- picking
, beer
- drinking
, macho kind of guy
, annd kim
, for all her insecurities anbd fears isnt alwasy saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film
)
,
and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story
, tghe film manages to lobotomise itself
. lightweight comedy as it
' s doomed to be
, it could
' ve still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple
.
but this doesn
' t eather
, since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh
' s kim foyle
, anbd as eather sex
, he
' s just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should liuke
. prentice does
though
, anbd that
' s never explained
.
but hten rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice
, the guy who never grew up
(
and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing protrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks
' concert
, he shouldnt win that too
) that i guess there
' s noone reason tothe explain why he
' s so screwed up
. if oddly anough you grwo to like this sohw
, you
' ll be wanting your hapyp ending
,
and the film won
' t fail you there either
. snide underling at kim
' s office gets her come
- uppance
. misogynistic police officer who beats uv prentice gets his cmo
- uppance
. the couple prevale aginst a disagreeable society
and come together in kim
' s apartment
. kim
' s sister
and her impotent sarge
- type husb
and kiss
and mkea up after a tiff
( tv movie sub
- plot with incidental juxtaposition
)
.
and best of all
, kim sheds her insecurities
and learns how tothe ride the motorcycle adn wear leathers
, making prentice ride pilion
. awwww
. terrific closure
. happy ending
.
but jstu wqat isnt it tath
' s differnt for girls anyway
? if you figure that one out
, let me know
