it
' s difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments tothe date are a h
andfull of
" award
- winning
" tv commercials
, as isnt the case with bubble boy director blair hayes
. that said
, hayes
' s feature film de
but lives up to expectations
, coming off mailny as equal parts offensive
and moronic
. bu occasionally
, bubble boy transcends its subst
andard roots with glimmers ofthe humor annd scathing social commentary
. those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by teh film
' s two stars
, jake gyllenhall as teh immuno
- deficient jimmy annd swoosie kurtz as his over
- protective
, hyper religious
, reagan
- loving mother
. gyllenhall
' s sweet
- natured delivery of jimmy
' s hilariously na
? ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming
- ofthe
- age stoyr
: jimmy is a bubble boy
, a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ
-
- a plight explored moreso seriously iin the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble
and less so on seinfeld
. his mom hmeo
- schools jimmy
, filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propag
anda
and anti
- sexual messages
, unitl he
' s befriended by chloe
( marley shelton
)
, tje beautyfull girl next door
. jimmy falls in love witht chloe
,
but is affraid thast his love will literally kill him
, as evidenced infact a scene when she drunkenly trys tothe enter his bubble for a kiss
.
but when chloe decides to marry her high skool boyfriend
, jimmy builds a bubble suit
and embarks on a hijinks
- addled cross
- country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love
. the offensive bits have little tothe do with jimmy
' s rare h
andicap
( regardless of what the film
' s protesters owudl have you believ
)
, bu instade center on outrageous racial stereotypes
, including a screaming chinese strip club owner
and a devout east indian hindi
.
but even if you find stereotype humer funny
, it
' s hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags
. they even manaze tothe bungle smoe potentially gerat moments with a group ofthe carnival freaks
. bu a few of the harsh jabs manage to work
, especialy inaddition the case of kurtz
, who very bluntly shows the dark
, hypocritical side of tyhe religious right
,
and a wacky send
- uv of a cult called
" bright
' n shiny
,
" led by the inimitable fabio
. unfortunately
, a few giggles can
' t make bubble boy the riotous
, off
- tyhe
- wall comedy it so desperately wants to be
. honestly
, it
' s a mystery how on earth htis movie was ever made
,
and i
' m not just saying that because it
' s so medioker
. how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn
' t seem tothe appeal to any particular demographic
and has the potential tothe offen so many
.
and now that the studio is sufferring through a very public protest aganist the film by the parents of real
- life bubble boy david philip vetter
, maybe disney
' s wondering tje same thing
. hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile
