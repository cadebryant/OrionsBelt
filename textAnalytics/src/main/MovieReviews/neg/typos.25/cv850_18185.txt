1990s would remembered as the era of binary movei events inwhich hollywood
- twpo movies dealing with the same subject
, or
, to be precise
, smae
" high concept
"
. in summer 1994
, that
" high concept
" was
" mad bomber action thriller
"
. in few weeks
,
" thrillride ofthe the summer
" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away
, so disappointing thgat most of the peopel these days associate hte title with the 1992 thriller in whcih nicole eggert doed few nude scenes
. the movie begins in tje prison in northern irel
and
, where gaerity
( tommy lee jones
)
, ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material
, escapes from prision
. he comes to boston
, where he accidentally notices jimmy dove
( jeff bridges
)
, dedicated bomb disposal expert withing boston polical
. fewd peple except gaerity know the dove
' s violent past
, when he unsed to be ira territorist before becoming sick with violence
, betraying gaerity
and emigrating to america where he changed the name
and started using his experience for good purpose
. gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity
and beggins the campaign ofthe bombing terror
, directed specifically at dove
' s colleagues
, friends adn relatives
. dove
, who is jsut going tothe retire
and start famaly
, now must confront the mad bomber
. while speed doesn
' t even try to bother with plot adn characters
, using them only as an excuse for long
and spectacular action scenes
, blown awya tries tothe be more conventional
and provide the acation wiht some back stroy
.
and that isnt the main reason why it is inferior to speed
. badly written plot
and badly written charactors are sometimes worse than no plot
and noone characters at all
. screenplay by john bateer
and john rice
, barely touches tghe complicated issues of northern irel
and
, useing the tradgedy onyl as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama
. the plot is
, ofthe course
, full of implausibilities
. the main oen isnt the fact that movie fails tothe explain how thte single individule
, no matter how briliant he is
, can produce thous
ands of deadly devices
and hold entire city at bay
. those questions
, same as infront the case of speed
, could be forgotten while thte action goes onthe
, bu the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched
and predictable situation that should provide some backgorund to the characters
. because ofthe them
, movie seems a little bit too long
,
and boring at times
. the most annoying element of the film
,
however
, is tommy lee jones in tghe role ofthe mad bomber
. his acting is so over
- teh
- top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himselv
. this role is in painful contrast with the strong peformance given by tht same actor infront fugitive
. the film have few bright points
,
though
. some of the action scenes are fine
, which should be credited to directer stephen hopkins
( predator ii
, judgement night
)
. anbd forrest whitaker really shines inspite minor role of dove
' s collegue
.
but
, all inspite all
, blown away isnt a film that was justifiably shadowed by its omre famous
, yot hardly unforgetable competitor
.
