i have never been so confused after watching a movie
.
" meet joe black
" is probably one of teh most visually satisfying films of this year
, with a cinematography
, music
and casted that will dazzle most ofthe us
. at the same tiome it isnt probably the most boring anbd ridiculous experienc hat you will have this season
. at firt ytou marvel at yhe elagant direction
, graceful cinematography
and sensual musical score
. thne you
' ll wait for something tothe happen for half an hour
,
but wehn you finally underst
and wqat
' s going on
, ytou
' ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins
, brad pitt
and claire forlani are doing in a film like htis
? the scirpt is simpley a silly
and unresolved stoy
, whihc is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture
. it feels liek an eternity
. most of tyhe time it is a pompous soap opera
, filled witht empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice adn
" meaningfull
" winks
. the film isnt based on alberto caesella
' s play
" death takes a holiday
"
. the stor concentrates aroud bill
( anthony hopkins
) who lives a fulfilled life as a sucessfull bussines man
,
but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of tje night
and hears a voice that is saying
" yes
"
. soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen
( brad pitt
) who introduces himself as
" death
"
. it is bill
' s time
.
but death has otehr plans
. it has come down to us simple mortals tothe find out what it means to be alive
. our bill is choosen to be death
' s guide adn in exchange he gets timne
. bill introduces death as joe balck
, who immediately becomes the center of everyone
' s attention
. bill
' s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill
' s side
, lives in his house annd resides at his office
. that is not all
,
however
. bill
' s youngest daughter susan
( claire forlani
) falls in love with the misteryous stranger anbd joe falls in love iwth her
. this relationship is binded tothe have some serious consequences
. it wouldn
' t be fair to say that this film didn
' t have some interesting moments
, such as tje scene where joe is invited to join bill
' s family forthe dinner
. when joe starts enjoying peanut
buter adn later falls in love
, the experience is somewhat different
. it is obvious that a story like this stoy is very difficult to structure
. it
' s one thing to say
:
" wouldn
' t it be fun to have death tkae human form
and come down to earth
.
.
" to create a motion picture out ofthe this isnt anyother
. four screenwriters have worked on a script thgat lacks drive
and logic
. it is overlong
and too primative to pass as a sereous film
. on the other h
and it demonstrates incredable performances annd a very decent direction by martin brest
(
" scent of a woman
"
)
. hopkins looks graet in any role
, adn no marter how shallow or hollow it is
, he will complete it
. his talent
and charisma are needed here more than any where eles
, usance it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment
. bu pitt is the noe that got one of tyhe most difficult roles ofthe reccent time
. how can you play death inspite human form
? to me it seems that death
and life are not something taht cxan be associated with earthly matters
. they are nto creatures
,
but phenomenas
. saying that death takes human form would be tghe smae as tothe suggest thyat eternity would take human form
. h
andling such a ridiculous task isnt incredibly difficult adn pitt deserves soem credit fo his work
. speaking inspite a calm
, soft voice
, portraing death as a lonely
, distant
and powerful guy that isnt unfamiliar with practical earthly matters
. he looks
and acts more like an angel of death
, rather than a demon or a red
- eyed executioner
. claire forlani annd others are also fine
, stretching their stereotypical characters to their lmits
. unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescure this film from its self inflicted misery
. infront other words this is nto whta i expected from the director ofthe
" scent of a woman
"
. it could
(
and should
) be better with such casted
and crew
. in tjhe end it seems as if tehy haev all been intensively wokring on a ravishingly looking soap opera
.
