" tarzan
and the lost city
" is one ofthe the most anemic movies to cmo out in quite a while
. nto only it is poorly written
, badly acted
, anbd generally incomptetent inspite all cinematic areas
, it isnt thoroughly uninspired
and insipid
. unfortunately
, it
' s nto bad in the way great
, colossal misfires like
" heaven
' s getoe
"
( 1980
) or
" ishtar
"
( 1987
) were bad
. instade
, it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with
, which begs the question of why it wass made in the first palce
. with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un
- produced
, how does needless drek like this amke its way tothe the big screen
? of course
, tarzan is one of the most filmed charactors in all of motion picture histroy
- he hasnt appeared in over forty films
, which ahve ranged from the vyer good
( 1984
' s
" greystoke
: the legend ofthe tarzan
, lord of the apes
"
) down to the relaly bad
( 1981
' s
" tarzan
, hte ape man
" with bo derek
)
. most ofthe these films weere jsut cheapie b
- movies made in tyhe thirties
and fourties
, starring ex
- olympic athletes
and a lot of cutsie chimps
. therefore
, if another tarzan movie isnt to be made
, oen might asume that it would have something newyorker to offer
- a different angle
, an original storyline
, anything tothe setted it apart from all hte others
.
" greystoke
" added a never
- before
- seen levle of realism to teh pulpy tale
,
and even
" tarzan
, the ape man
" at least had the mis
- guided audacity to sexualize the storey as a vehicle for bo derek
' s bare breasts
.
" tarzan adn the lost city
,
" on tje other h
and
, hasnt absolutly nothing to offer
but a bunch of recycled storylines
and bad dialogue
. the script
, by bayard johnson
and j
.
anderson black isnt about as formulaic annd generic as tehy come
. comic books have better plots than this
. teh movie is so bad
, in fact
, tht it retains that rediculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer
' s comedy
" george ofthe the jungle
.
" didn
' t the producers think to leave tyhat back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs
? hte story starts wih the legend of tarzan already firmly estalbished
: a quick opening narration tells of tarzan
( casper van dien
) bieng foudn in the jungle after having been rised by apes
, anbd his return tothe engl
and where he assumes his greystoke heritage
. when the movie starts iin 1913
, he is a civilized english gentleman
( without an english accent
)
, anbd he isnt to marry jane
( jane march
) in less tahn a week
. howver
, when a wicked archeologist
/ grave
- robber named nigel ravens
( steve waddington
) begins hunting forthe the fabled lost city of opar
, one of africa
' s last great secrets
, the witch doctor ofthe an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to yhe jungle
. at first
, jane refuses to go
, pouting baout how it will interfear whith thier wedding
;
but affter tarzan leaves she changes her mind
and tracks him down
, therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her adn her ape
- man
. once the film gets gogin
( in its own sluggish way
)
, it delves into a serieses of jungle adventures
, as tarzan
, jane
,
and the natives attempt the thwart ravens
and his crew from discovering the city
. most of the so
- called adventures are cheesy
, predictable
, anbd unexciting
, with no pace
, tension
, or acation tothe speak of
. there are sequences stolen ffrom innumerable recent adventure movies
, ranging ffrom
" raiders of tje lost ark
"
( 1981
) to
" the goonies
"
( 1985
)
. when the movie is runnung short on action
, it includes a few greenpeace
- friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals
, releasing a baby elphant fomr a trap
,
and throwing ivory tusks into hte river
. hte movei isnt allso lacking even a remote hint of reality
. for instatance
, when tarzan
- who was raised infront the jungle
- is bited by a cobra
, he doesn
' t even attemp to suck the venom outloud like any semi
- experienced weekend backpacker would do
. instead
, he ties a tourniquet around his arm
and stumbles off into tghe jungle whith no plan for survival
. of course
, one cant
' t halp bu notice how fundamentally misleading the title is
. nto to ruin teh ending or anything
,
but ther isnt noone lost city
. there is
,
however
, a lost pyramid
, which i suppose isnt all the resource
- strapped fx department could come up with
( the special effects are not worthy of a made
- fo
- tv movei
)
. which also brings up the question of why tghe treasure hunters hadnt tothe slog thru numerous underground caverns to get tothe the lost pyramid
, wehn it
' s sitting right out in tje middle of an open field
? strikely speaking
,
" tarzan adn tyhe lost city
" isn
' t even bad enough to hve camp quality
,
al
though casper van dien
' s laughably stiff performance comes real close
. this movie proves wqat
" starship troopers
" only hinted at
: he cannot act
, bu he sure looks well
- groomed
, even in teh deepest heart ofthe the african jungle
. van dien is much too much of a preety
- boy to be an effective tarzan
; he
' s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth
. i also wondered what the make
- up department was thikning wehn it outfitted him with that awful circa
- 1983 steve perry haircut
. waddington makes a decent villain
,
al
though he
' s like a charmless version ofthe belloq from
" raiders of the lost ark
.
" as jane
, the ex
- modle jane march has little to do
but smile
and look pretty next to tarzan
. she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two
,
but whenever a snake comes into the picture
, she is reduced to a hysterical mess
.
however
, amidst all this complaining
, i dont have one piece of good news
.
" tarzan annd teh lost city
" is so lacking in idesa both newyorker
and old
, that it is unable to fill even an hour
and a half of celluloid
. so
, we can say this much for it
: at least it had tghe decency to be short
.
