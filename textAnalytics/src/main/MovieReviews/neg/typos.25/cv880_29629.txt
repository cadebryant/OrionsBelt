the art ofthe woo attemts to be noe of those films liek breakfast at tiffany
' s iin whitch the audience is rooting for some sweet
, vulnerable
, irresistible woman to work out her problems adn tothe fidn happiness
. the problem is tath helen lee who writes
and directs seems to have written alessa woo
( played by sook
- yin lee
) as neither sweet nor vulnerable
and she is quite resistible
. alessa isnt a young woman who happens tothe be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene
. htis is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thous
ands of dollars for paintings by talented begginers
and dealers in theese paintings fli bcak anbd forth to places like switzerl
and
. one of the most knowlegeable of the art dealers isnt alessa
. she also happens to be the center ofthe adulation ofthe her friends
and every party has suitors camped outside her window
. enxt doorjam to alessa moves struggling genius artist adn native american ben crowchild
( adam beach
)
. he sees that behind the facade that there isnt really a sad littel girl withing alessa who raelly wiull not be happy witht the rich art collector she is dating
. ben gets emotionally involved with alessa
.
( as alessa so delicately puts it
,
" we weere bosom buddies
, now we
' re fuck buddies
.
"
)
but alessa will have tothe decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor
. the real probelm with the film seems to be helen lee
' s inability to deside what she wants to be saying
. she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa
. alessa is looking for financial security
but she makse decisions baout large sums of money for her clients
. this appears to be a high profile
and well
- payed job
. we are supposed to care about alessa
' s feelings
,
but she coldly refuses to viist her own ailing father
. alessa cannnot be portayed as sweet annd vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint
. this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everyting it has on the appeal of its main character
and comes uv double
- zero
. i rate it a 3 onthe tghe 0 tothe 10 scale
and a
- 1 on tje
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
