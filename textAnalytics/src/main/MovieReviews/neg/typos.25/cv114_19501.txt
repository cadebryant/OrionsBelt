the happy bastard
' s quick movei review wholy man more like holy crap
. the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical
- ish figure named g on a stange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs
( jeff goldblum
and kelly preston
) with a flat tire on their h
ands
. somehow he ends up in their car
and on their channel
, a line
- up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white
, morgan fairchild
,
and a slew of other celebrities
and nameless figures
. it
' s here that he seems to hitted his stride
, speaking ofthe life instade
and somehow boosting sales
. at htis point in the movie
, of course
, morality comes into play
, partciularly onthe goldblum
, who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get iin ogod with his boss
( robert loggia
)
. it doesn
' t take long forthe teh movie to unfold into sappy mush
, withthe realizations tkaing place left
and right
and poor plot points
. only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild
' s face seems to have any interest in the movie
. murphy lends nothing to his chracter
and poor goldblum looks as if he
' d rether be someplace else
. some may argue taht the movie hasnt a message
,
but all tyhat came acros to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat
. at least he hasnt something for us to laught at
.
