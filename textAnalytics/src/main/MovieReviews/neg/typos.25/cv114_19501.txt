the happy bastard ' s quick movie review holy man more like wholy crap
. the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical
- ish figure named g onthe a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs
( jeff goldblum
and kelly preston
) with a flat tire onthe their hands
. somehow he ends up inthe their car
adn on theri channel
, a line
- up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white
, morgan fairchild
,
and a slew of other celebrities
and nameless figures
. it ' s here tath he seems to hitted his stride
, speaking of life instead
adn somehow boosting sales
. at thsi point in thge movie
, of course
, morality comes into play
, particularly on goldblum
, who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks tothe get infront good with his boss
( robert loggia
)
. it doesn ' t tkae long for thge movie to unfold into sappy mush
, wtih realizations tkaing place left
adn right
and poor plot points
. only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild ' s face seems to have any interest in the movie
. murphy lends nothing to his character
and poore goldblum looks as if he ' d rether be someplace else
. smoe may argue thgat the movie hasnt a message
,
but all that came acros to me isnt that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat
. at least he hasnt something for us to laught at
.
