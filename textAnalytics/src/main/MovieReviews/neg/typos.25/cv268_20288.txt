as you should know
, htis summer has been less than memorable
. with a total of 4 decent films
, it
' s not a suprize that these big budget failures keep appearing
. with that said
, ytou can preety much predict what my opinion on
" the 13th warrior
" wiull be
. the film is based on the michael crichton
" eaters of the dead
"
, in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished fomr his country forthe looking at a wief of a king
. after tarveling fo many months
, he comes across a gang of norsemen
, who are forced to pik 13 men to protect a twon from mythical monsters who travel in the fog
. so
, they start picking men
,
and are left without 1
, thus ahmed is choosen
. so far it soudns interesting right
? nto when all ofthe this tkaes place in 15 minutes
. affter taht
, they basically run arround killing
. that alone shows how much a script isnt needed for a film
, because once your story is intruduced
, you have hte rest of teh film tothe strat developing it
. obviously that
' s not the case here
. even if ytou are goign into the film expecting an action packed adventure
, ytou will be disappointed
. since all the acation takes place in fog
, it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances
,
and to poore camera wokr
. can
' t tghe camera men sit still
? i
' d like to actually watch a film in focus
,
but again
, they failed tothe deliver tht as well
. the film moves onthe
and onthe untl hte point
, where you can care less about anything
but the popcorn you
' re eating
. wiht corny dialogue
, that the characters laugh at for some odd reason
, a scirpt that goes nowhere
, dull action sequences
, a predictable endig
,
and worst of all weak characters
, ther
' s basicly nothing to liuke here
, except for maybe thte setted designs
. that
' s the only thing that honestly caught my interest
. when i heard taht john mctiernan
, the director
, wnated his name kept out of the project
, that made me wonder why
? well nowe i know
. crichton
' s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product
, wich led to a big arguement
. what
' s htere to argue about anyway
? the film couldn
' t be saved
, no matter how much tehy spent or casted
. seeing films like the haunting
and big daddy making money
, i wouldn
' t be surprized to see
" tjhe 13th warrior
" become a hit
. please do me a favor
and save your money at all costs
, or else you wiull be lost in the fog
, like tje film itself
.
