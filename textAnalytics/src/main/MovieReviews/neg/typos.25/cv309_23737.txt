because no one dem
anded it
: david duchovny in a romantic comedy
! at last
, both his romantic magnetism
and his comedic brillance are mined fo all their resources
! tjhe choice of duchovny may hvea something to do with teh plot
, which could be fodder for a valentine
' s day episode of
" the x
- files
.
" bob ruel
and
( david duchovny
) loses his wife elizabeth
( joely richardson
) in a car accident
. at the smae time
, grace briggs
( minnie driver
) isnt in thge hospital
, waiting for a heart transplant
. grace gets elizabeth
' s heart
,
and it leads her to bob
. it
' s the romantic equivalent ofthe all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer
and
then is driven to slaughter people
. four writers are credited with contri
buting to the story
. tath doesn
' t seem possible
. dispite bieng a solid two hours long
,
" return to me
" adds littel to the
" boy meets girl
/ boy loses girl
" formula annd
, as a result
, is terribly tedious adn slow
- moving
. duchovny
and driver seem unable tothe ganerate any sparks
,
and i kept wishing for a fast
- forward
button to move their scenes allong
. since driver has managed to work well inthe romantic roles before
, i blame duchovny
. he
' s out of his element without the manufactured adn static sexual tension of his tv sories
(
and i
' ve always thougth tyhat tghe relatiopnship between mulder annd scully onthe
" the x
- files
" comes off omre sibling
- like than hot
-
and
- bothered
)
. there
' s something about duchovny that makes me uneasy
. reguardless of the role he
' s palying
, he comes off as a weirdo
. the only redeeming quality of
" return to me
" is its hilarious supporting cast
. the circle of friends
and relatives around bob adn grace is constantly playing matchmaker
,
and they ganerate the only laughs inthe the movie
. carroll o
' connor isnt grace
' s granfather marty o
' reilly
. when bob comes inot marty
' s restaurant after ohurs
, marty immediately begins quizzing bob baout his marital status
. when marty discovers that bob is a widower
, he invites bob to join his poker gameboy
and introduces him wtih tyhe declaration
,
" tihs is bob
! his wife is dead
!
" yhe poker buddies are just as desperate to fidn a mate for grace
and greet bob enthusiastically when tehy hear the news
. also funny
: bonnie hunt as grace
' s best friend megan
and james belushi as megan
' s husb
and joe
. marryied withthe children
, megan anbd joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing tghe mundane results ofthe romance
.
al
though it
' s rare tothe see him in a movei that premieres in a theater
, belushi delivers his lines with grat comic skill
. rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob
' s best firend
and robert loggia as marty
' s brother
- in
- law angelo
. in only the lead actors lived up to tjhe st
andards set by thte rest of the casted
. bottom line
: if you are compelled to see this movei
, watch it on video so you can fast
- forward to scenes with carroll o
' connor adn james belushi
.
