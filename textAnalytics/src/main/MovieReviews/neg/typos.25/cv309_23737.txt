because noone one demanded it
: david duchovny in a romantic comedy
! at last
, both his romantic magnetism
and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources
! the choice of duchovny may hvae something to do with the plot
, which could be fodder for a valentine ' s day epsiode ofthe
" the x
- files
.
" bob rueland
( david duchovny
) loses his wife elizabeth
( joely richardson
) inthe a car accident
. at the smae tiem
, grace briggs
( minnie driver
) is in tyhe hospital
, waiting forthe a heart transplant
. grace gets elizabeth ' s heart
,
and it leads her to bob
. it ' s tyhe romantic equivalant of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer
and
then is driven to slaughter people
. four writers are credited with contributing to the story
. that doesn ' t seem possible
. despite being a solid two hours long
,
" return tothe me
" adds little to the
" boy meets girl
/ boy loses girl
" formula
and
, as a result
, is terribly tedious
annd slow
- moving
. duchovny
and driver seem unable to generate any sparks
,
annd i kept wishing forthe a fast
- forward button to move their scenes along
. usance driver has managed to work well in rumatic roles before
, i blame duchovny
. he ' s out of his element without the manufactured
anbd static sexual tension of his tv series
(
and i ' ve allways thougth that the relationship between mulder
and scully onthe
" the x
- files
" comes off more sibling
- liek than hot
-
and
- bothered
)
. there ' s something about duchovny that makes me uneasy
. regardless of tjhe role he ' s palying
, he comes off as a weirdo
. the only reedeming quality of
" return to me
" is its hillarious supporting cast
. hte circle ofthe friends
and relatives aroud bob
and grace is constanly playing matchmaker
,
and they generate the only laughs in the movei
. carroll o ' connor isnt grace ' s grandfather marty o ' reilly
. when bob comes inot marty ' s restaurant after hours
, marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status
. when marty dicovers that bob isnt a widower
, he invites bob to join his poker game
annd introduces him with tghe declaration
,
" this is bob
! his wife is dead
!
" tje poker buddies are jstu as desperate to fidn a mate fo grace
and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news
. also funny
: bonnie hunt as grace ' s best friend megan
anbd james belushi as megan ' s husband joe
. married with children
, megan
and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing teh mundane results of romance
.
although it ' s rare to see him in a movei that premieres in a theater
, belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill
. rounding out tjhe impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob ' s best friend
and robert loggia as marty ' s brother
- infact
- lew angelo
. inspite only the lead actors lieved uv to the standards set by the rest of the casted
. bottom line
: if ytou are compelled to see this movei
, watch it on video so ytou can fast
- forward to scenes wiht carroll o ' connor
and james belushi
.
