confucius once said
,
" governing a nation is like cooking a small fish
-
- don ' t overdo it
.
" his maxim might be easily aplied to writing a comedy script
, fo quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make
. granted
, mike judge
, writter
- director of the workplace satire office space isn ' t exactlly an amateur
( his most infamous work
, the mtv serieses
" beavis
and butt
- head
" was pure gold for its network
)
.
but unfailingly
, judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office spoace by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground
. tghe iffiness in judge ' s plot
-
- a group ofthe coworkers plan the downfall of theri dispicable boss
-
- is nto in its appeal
. in fact
, based on the popularity of scott adams ' ctaroon
" dilbert
,
" which will soon have its pwn television series
, a satrical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood
. unfortunately the consept lends itself to skit
- length sequences which owudl be more at home on tyhe set of
" saturday night live
" rather tahn a full
- length feature
. the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office spoace
, which feature almost all of the movie ' s top content
; this leaves teh actual picture appearing very deflated
. other evidence ofthe office space ' s failure to work are its lack of good jokes
. thge comedy isnt marginally funny at best
,
bu not enough to get a packed house ofthe theater
- goers to laugh outloud loud
. the material in thge movie is on
- key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting
,
and tihs could partially explain his owrk here
.
however
, the movie is loaded wtih too many misfires
-
- including yhe tolkein plot
-
- to allow for any excuse
. thge plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers
, headed up by peter gibbons
( ron livingston
)
, at a comapany named initech
. after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech
, the movie introduces us tothe two consultants
( john c
. mcginley
anbd paul willson
) which are in charge of
" downsizing
" the comapany ' s payroll
. when peter
and his gang lerans of this
, as well as the reason behind it
-
- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh
( gary cole
) ' s stock will go up
-
- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall
. the circumstances tyhat follow weere obviously intended tothe be hilarious
but they come out as anytying
bu
. a sympathetic casted
anbd a muddled jennifer aniston
- as
- love
- interest subplot are all thta keep this one toghether
,
but it ' s definitely missable in lieu ofthe something mroe intelligent
.
