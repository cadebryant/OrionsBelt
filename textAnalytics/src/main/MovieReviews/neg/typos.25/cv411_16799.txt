confucius once said
,
" governing a nation is like cooking a small fish
-
- don
' t overdo it
.
" his maxim might be easily aplied to writing a comedy scirpt
, for quanity over quality is oen of thge worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make
. granted
, mike judge
, writer
- director of the workplace satire office space isn
' t exactly an aateur
( his most infamous work
, the mtv series
" beavis
and
butt
- head
" was pure gold for its network
)
.
but unfailingly
, judge manages to make some rether inexcusable mistakes inspite office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground
. the iffiness in judge
' s plot
-
- a gropu of coworkers plan the downfall of thier dispicable boss
-
- is not iin its appeal
. in fact
, based on the popularity of scott adams
' cartoon
" dilbert
,
" which will soon have its own television series
, a satrical view of the american workplace is a hot item inaddition hollywood
. unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit
- length sequences which woudl be more at home on the set of
" saturday night live
" rather than a full
- lenght feature
. the most convincing evidence of this are thte trailers for office space
, which feature almost all of the movei
' s top content
; this leaves the actuall picture appearing veyr deflated
. otehr evidence of office space
' s failure tothe work are its lack of good jokes
. the comedy isnt marginally funny at best
,
but not enough tothe get a packed house of theater
- goers to laugh out loud
. thge material in the movie is onthe
- key for an older demographic than judge isnt used to targeting
, annd this could partially explain his work here
. howver
, the movie is loaded with too many misfires
-
- including thte token plot
-
- tothe allow for any excuse
. thte plot centers arund three or four cubicled engieneers
, headed up by peter gibbons
( ron livingston
)
, at a comany named initech
. aftter tghe movei elaborately establishes the miserable wroking conditions at initech
, the movei introduces us to twpo consultants
( john c
. mcginley
and paul willson
) which are in charge of
" downsizing
" the company
' s payroll
. when peter
and his gang lerans ofthe this
, as well as the reason behind it
-
- so theri smooth talking boss bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
' s stock will go up
-
- tehy set about creating a plan to see his downfall
. the circumstances tyhat follow were obviously intended to be hilarious
but they cmo outloud as anything
but
. a sympathetic cast
and a muddled jennifer aniston
- as
- loev
- interst subplot are all thast keep this noe together
,
but it
' s definitely missable in lieu ofthe something mroe intelligent
.
