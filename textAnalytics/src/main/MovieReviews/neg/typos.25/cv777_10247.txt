when walt disney pictures announced a live
- action feature based on hte
' 60s ctaroon serieses ofthe
" mr
. magoo
,
" special interests groups representing the vision
- impaired let out a cry ofthe dismay
. mr
. magoo
, tehy claimed
, owudl be an insult tothe the men
and women they represented
. in fatc
, they weere wrong
. mr
. magoo is not jsut an insult tothe the blind
and near
- blind
, it
' s an insult to every human being who has thge misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny
, 90 minute atrocity
. it
' s stating the obvious tothe remark tath disney appears to have run out ofthe orginial idaes
. look at their roster ofthe 1996
and 1997 releases
,
and ytou
' ll see a shocking list of retreads
, includng 101 dalmatians
, george of teh jungle
, jungle2jungle
, that darn cat
!
, flubber
,
and now mr
. magoo
. the best of these
( george of the jungle
) was mildly entertaining
. the worst
, mr
. magoo
, exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be
. the firt problem with mr
. magoo is the script
. despite hte collaberation of naked gun scribe pat proft
, mr
. magoo is comically barren
. from beginning to end
, there
' s nto a laugh tothe be found
. every attempt at humor
-
-
and there are lots of them
-
- falls flat with an audible thud
. you
' d htikn that out of the dozens of gags jammed into thsi film
, at least a few would wrok
,
but that
' s nto the case
. i
' ve had omre laughs during ingmar bergman pictures
.
then there
' s leslie nielsen
, who looks
, sounds
, adn acts absolutly nothing like the animated character
( memorably voiced by jim backus
)
. in the past
, nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane
and the naked gun
. lately
,
however
, he hasnt beeen getting lazy
, taking parts in the likes of dracula
: dead
and loving it
, spy hard
,
and mr
. magoo
. even if nielsen was in top form
, it would tkae an incredable stretch of immagination to see him as magoo
( especially since we
' re reminded of tghe original by the short cartoon segments that open
and close the film
)
,
but
" top form
" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here
. this is strictly a take
- the
- moey
-
and
- run operation
. the story
, which
, like many disney stories
, can be described in one long sentence
: magoo is the onyl witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum
, annd
, as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own
, teh police mistake him for the robber
. the cops are plyed by ernie hudson
and stephen tobolowsky
, who take their lumps early
and oftenly
. the bad guys are kelly lynch
( who doesnt a lot ofthe martial arts
- type kicking
)
, nick chinlund
,
and malcolm mcdowell
( who hasnt tjhe good sense to look embarrassed
)
. matt keeslar portrays one ofthe magoo
' s sidekicks
-
- his nephew
, waldo
. the bumbling man
' s other
, more interesting companion is a dog named angus
. most ofthe mr
. magoo
' s humer comes in the form of failed slapstick
. the cartoon violence level inaddition thsi film doesn
' t approach tyhat of home alone 3 or flubber
, bu it
' s still pretty acute
, with characters getting hit on the head wiht sledgehammers
and knocked off snowy precipices
. there
' s a non
- voilent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was h
andeled better
,
but
, compaired tothe mr
. bean
' s recent
, similar misadventure
, it doesn
' t hold up well
. thne ther isnt the series of lame jokes thast result from magoo
' s near blindness
, such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal fo a baby
. i
' m willing to cut director stanley tong a littel slack
. tong
, a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market
, has helmed sevral jackie chan movies
, including frist strike
, rumble in the bronx
,
and supercop
. his cheif talent
, that ofthe choreographing martial arts fights
, is wasted here
( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch
)
. like john woo
( hard target
) annd ringo lam
( maximum risk
) befor him
, it appears that tong has been consigned tothe the purgatory of making a bad movei as his entry into the american mainstream
. it is worth noting thta
, unlike many disney films wich hold a perverse appeal for tyhe under
- 10 crowd hwile driving parents tothe distraction
, mr
. magoo appears to bore viewers ofthe all ages
. the screening i attended was wall
- to
- wall kids
, adn
, fo thge most part
, they didn
' t seem to be enjoying themselves
. when yhe film was over
, i asked oney little girl whta she
thought of it
. her pained expression confirmed the adage thta a picture can indeed be worth a thous
and words
. mr
. magoo is the kind of movei that should be rejected by any potential viewer
, sight unseen
.
