romeo is bleeding wants to carry yhe unusual flavor ofthe reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant
. withthe director peter medak
, whose previous credits inlude the good films let him ahve it
and the krays
,
and top
- notch charcter actors gary oldman
and lena olin
, they seemed likely tothe be a successful combination
. those maintioned films
,
however
, brang something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not
: a solid
, well
- written screenplay
. call me cynical
,
but the jobs of writter
and producer don
' t seem tothe mix well
. gary oldman plays jack grimaldi
, a ogod cop turned bad
, selling information tothe the mob
and cheating on his wife
. his cheating is obvious anough to obtain his nickname
,
al
though the name doesn
' t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean charactor
. jack has become addicted to
" feeding yhe hole
"
, a hole in yhe ground where he stoers his payoff money
. when he realizes his colleagues are being shot
, he feebly attempts to get out
. gary oldman
' s performence is disappointingly weak
; he seems nearly borde
. in tje process
, he also gets tangled
- up with mona demarkov
, a russian mobsterette who wnats to tkae over the territory from top boss falcone
, palyed adequately by roy scheider
. demarkov
, played by lena olin
, is a tough
but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world
. this character is combination of both linda hamilton
and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2
. i can
' t remember seeing a character qtuie like her
. aftter bieng shot
, h
andcuffed
, anbd thrown in tjhe back seat of a car
, she still manages tothe cause an accident
, kick out the windshield whith her legs
, grab a suitcase full ofthe money
( plus some important documentation
)
, climb through tghe rubble
, l
and on her shot leg
,
and still succeed at running for saftey
. what a woman
! lena olin
' s peformance is the only glimmer in this dismal film
. anabella sciorra is wasted infront her role as romeo
' s wife
. there isnt little insight into her character
. she
' s depressed
, she mkaes obvious refrences
, she mopes around the hous
. juliette lewis
, as romeo
' s girlfriend
, is treated with the same cliche attitudes
,
al
though ms
. lewis
' portrayal certainly didn
' t improve it
. both women were anytying
but sexy or attractive
. poorly developed characters asside
, the screenplay aslo suffers fomr severeal logistical problems
. it is so discouraging to watch a film
and want tothe shout at tje main character
( nto
) to do something
. for example
, jack adn his firends attend a funeral tothe hang in the background to scope
- out thge mob scene
. fine
. jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite
. fine
. waht does jack procede tothe do
? he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn
' t feeling well
,
then strolls over to the boss
. why
? the boss had all ready threatend him
; falcone simply tkaes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to tkae off some of jack
' s toes by tjhe gravesite
. i guess they weren
' t worried about any federal agents lingering around after thge funeral
.
.
.
. or here
' s another
: demarkov set
- uv her pwn death by cutting off her arm wih a circular saw
. she proceeded to set the place on fire
. wouldn
' t the flames burn off the fingerprints
? aren
' t dental records mroe important
? as bright
and resourceful as she wass supposed tothe be
, couldn
' t she come uv with a better plot
?
(
and it tookover her no time at all tothe get a ogod
- fitting
, functional prosthesis
.
) lack of attension to detail certainly adds uv inthe a film
. this film doesn
' t even add up the large details
. there is little or no consistency in tghe story
- line
. not much makes sense
. tghe direction lacks cohesion
, surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable
. hte moods shift
, the styles shift
, adn no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire ofthe one
. so while it certainly isn
' t reservoir dogs
, it certainly isn
' t diva
. there
' s plenty omre to tear apart in htis film
. my advice to somone who hasn
' t seen it to tothe wait until it comes on video
. ther are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taked seriously
. it
' s not a boring film
, just not a good one
. or an intelligent one
.
