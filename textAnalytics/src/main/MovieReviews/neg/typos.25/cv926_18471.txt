. atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief thgat a resivwar should nto speak of himselv inaddition his pwn review
. i ' ve attempted to obey this rule in recent months
,
bu to do so would be impossible in this case
. the fact is
, nearly every person who goes to see yhe phantom menace brings baggage in wtih them
. thte original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people
. forthe me
, htey calibrated my creativity as a child
; they are masterful
, original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time
(
and htey still hold uv pretty darn well
)
. i am too young to have seen star wars inwhich the theather druing its original release
,
but thta doesn ' t make me any less dedicated to it
. on teh contrary
, the star wars trilogy
-
-
and hte empire strikes back in particular
-
- are three items on a vrey short list of why i love movies
. when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine
- film series
, i got exited
. when i first saw screenshots from the film
, well over a year ago
, i embarked on a year
- long drool of anticipation
.
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving
, i was ready to see the film
.
but
then there wass the hype
, the insane marketting campaign
,
and lucasfilm ' s secretive snobbery over the picture
. in the lastr weeks before the picture oppened
, hwile multitudes ofthe fans waited outside of theaters
and stood in the boiling sun dyas inspite advance just to be teh first ones in the theater
, i wass tired of hearing baout it
. i was tired of seeing cardboard cut
- outs ofthe the cahracters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell
. i jsut wanted tothe see the movei
. reader
, do not misunderstand
. i did not hvea an anti
- hype reaction
. the hype was unavoidable
. i understand
adn accept the hype
-
- it ' s just what happens wehn tyhe prequel to the most widely beloved films ofthe all timne get released
. five minutes into the phantom menace
, i knew there ws a problem
.
" who are these jedi knights
?
" i asked
.
" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine
- gun rapidity
?
"
" why aren ' t these characters bieng developed before thier adventures
?
"
" why is there a special effects shooted in nearly every frame of tyhe entire film
?
" these were just some of my questions early onthe
. later
, i asked
,
" where ' s tje magic of tghe first threee films
?
"
anbd
" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes
? ' by the end of tjhe film
, i was tired
, maddened
,
anbd depressed
. george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless
, mindless
, summer blockbuster
. the phantom menace is no star wars film
. take away thte title
adn the jedi talk
and the force
,
and yuo ' re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time
. it ' s an embarrasment
. i looked desperately fo a scene inthe which a character isnt explored
, or a new theme isnt examined
, or a special effects shooted isn ' t used
. ther are a faw of each
,
bu they ' re all token attempts
. the fact is
, george lucas hasnt created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse fo a movei
and a pretty good showcase for digital effects
. this is not what i wanted to see
. i didn ' t wnat to leave the phantom menace with a headache
and a bitter taste in my mouth
,
bu i doed
. the story centers mostly around qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
, looking lost
adn confuzled
)
and his apprentice
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
, who scarcely has a line inthe the film
)
and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo
. naboo isnt the victim ofthe a bureaucratic war whith teh trade federation
; their contact on naboo isnt queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people
. after picking uv jar jar binks
( a completely cgi character
, voiced by ahmed best
)
, they head tothe tatooine
, where they meet young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his mother
( pernilla august
)
. qui
- gon knows that the force isnt strong withthe young anakin
,
and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys
. the bad guys are darth maul
and darth sidious
, niether ofthe whom have enough lines to register as characters
. there isn ' t anytying particlarly wrong wih this story when looking at it inspite synopsis form
. the way lucas has handled it
,
howver
, it unsatisfactory
. firt of all
, we don ' t learn one single thing baout qui
- gon jinn
. nto one hting
. what wass his life like before this film
? well
, i imagine he didn ' t have one
. that ' s why he fiels like a plot device
. this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role
,
and why he ' s recently retired from film
( i don ' t blame him
, honestly
)
. obi
- wan
, a chracter i was really looking foward tothe learning more about
, is even less interesting
. mcgregor hasnt just a fewd lines
, so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere
. since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace
, lucas hasnt served us a big emotional void as thte centerpiece ofthe his movie
. things start to pik uv when our characters reach tatooine
; young anakin is perhasp the only truly fleshed
- out character in tje film
,
anbd lloyd does a thoughtful job with tyhe role
. i was also hugely impressed wiht the sand speeder scene
; rarely is an acation sequence so fast
anbd so exciting
.
annd whn anakin says goodbye to his mother
, i found it moving
. also fairly good isnt portman
,
and she manages to give a little depth tothe a character where no depth has been written
. jar jar binks is noe of the most annoying characters i ' ve ever had to endure
,
but he ' s more interesting than most of hte humans
. as soon as the relitavely
- breef segment onthe tatooine is over
, it ' s bcak tothe the mind
- numbing speshal effects
and depthless action scenes
. i ' ve seen many movies that qualify as
" special effects extravaganzas
,
"
but the phantom menace is the first one i ' ve seen that hadnt me sick of the speical effects fifteen minutes into the movie
. the reason is obvious
: george lucas hasnt no resturaunt
. i can ' t say that i didn ' t find hte effects original
, because i did
-
- the final battle between darth maul
, obi
- wan
,
adn qui
- gon is visually exceptional
, as isnt most of the film
.
bu i also found thte effects deadening
and tiresome
. my breaking point was near the end ofthe the picture
, as anakin is getting questioned by yoda
and the otehr jedi masters
; in the background
, we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around thru a digital sky
,
and i wanted that tothe go awya
. can ' t we have one stinking scene that isn ' t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot
? i got so sick ofthe looking at the cgi cahracters
anbd spaceships
adn planets
annd backgrounds tyhat i really just wanted to go outside
annd look at a fysical landscape for a fewd hours
.
annd
hten there ' s the question of magic
. what ws lost in tghe sixteen yeasr between tjhe phantom menace
and return of the jedi
? i have a feeling thta lucas was so focused on how his movei looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel
. john williams ' familiar score is noone halp
, nor is lucas ' direction
. i think it comes right down to cahracters
: there are none here
. i longed for tyhe magentic presence of han
, luke
,
adn leia
,
but i got noone such thing
.
annd waht about the ridiculous expectations
? mine weren ' t thyat high
; i simply wanted a film that showed me tyhe roots ofthe the films that i growed uv loving
, a story that had a faw characters
and a faw great special effects
. instade
, i got two hours
annd fifteen mintues of a lifeless
and imaginative computer graphics show
. i don ' t hate thte phantom menace as much as i resent it
: i ' d like to forget tyhat it exists
,
anbd
yot i can ' t
. it ' s here to stay
. i can onyl hope tyhat episodes ii
and iii have something of substace in them
, because if tehy don ' t
,
then lucas wiull have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series
