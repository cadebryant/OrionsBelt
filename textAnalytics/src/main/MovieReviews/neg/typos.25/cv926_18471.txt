. atcheson a fellow criteak once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review
. i
' ve attempted tothe obey this rule in recent months
,
but to dont so would be impossible infact this case
. the fact is
, nearly every person who goes to see hte phantom menace brings baggage in whith them
. yhe original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people
. fo me
, they calibrated my creativity as a child
; they are masterful
, original works of art taht mix moving stroies with what were astonishing special effects at the time
(
and they still hold up pretty darn well
)
. i am too young tothe have seen star wars in the theater during its original release
,
but that doesn
' t make me any less dedicated tothe it
. on the contrary
, the star wars trilogy
-
-
and the empire strikes back in particular
-
- are threee items on a very short list of why i love movies
. when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine
- film series
, i got exited
. wehn i first saw screenshots from tje film
, well over a year ago
, i embarked on a yearm
- long drool of anticipation
. annd when the first previews were released lsat thanksgiving
, i ws ready to see the film
.
but thn there was tjhe hype
, the insane marketing campaign
, anbd lucasfilm
' s secretive snobbery over the picture
. in tghe last weeks before the picture opened
, hwile multitudes ofthe fans waited outside of theaters
and st
anded inwhich the boiling sun dyas in advance jstu to be the first ones iin the theater
, i was tired of hearing about it
. i wass tired of seeing cardboard cutted
- outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell
. i jstu wanted tothe see the movie
. reader
, do not misunderst
and
. i did not have an anti
- hype reaction
. the hype ws unavoidable
. i underst
and
and accept tjhe hype
-
- it
' s just what happens when the prequel tothe the most widely beloved films of all time get released
. five minutes inot the phantom menace
, i knew there wass a probelm
.
" who are these jedi knights
?
" i asked
.
" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine
- gun rapidity
?
"
" why aren
' t these characters bieng devolopped before thier adventures
?
"
" why is there a speical effects shot in nearly every frame ofthe the entire film
?
" these were just soem of my questions early on
. later
, i asked
,
" where
' s the magic ofthe the first three films
?
"
and
" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes
?
' by tyhe end of the film
, i wass tired
, maddened
, annd depressed
. george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless
, mindless
, summer blockbuster
. the phantom menace is no star wars film
. take away the title
and the jedi talk
and the force
,
and you
' re left withthe what isnt easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time
. it
' s an embarrassment
. i looked desperately fo a scene in which a character is explored
, or a new theme is examined
, or a spacial effects shooted isn
' t used
. there are a few ofthe each
,
but they
' re all token attemts
. the fatc isnt
, george lucas has creaeted what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie
and a pretty good showcase for digital effects
. this isnt not what i wnated tothe see
. i didn
' t want to leave hte phantom menace with a headache adn a bitter taste inspite my mouth
,
but i doed
. the stopry centers mostly aroud qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
, looking lost
and confused
)
and his apprentice
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
, who scarcely hasnt a line in thge film
) adn their attempts tothe liberate the peopel ofthe the planet naboo
. naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation
; their contact on naboo is queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, tje teenage rular who truley cares for her peopel
. after picking uv jar jar binks
( a completely cgi character
, voiced by ahmed best
)
, htey head to tatooine
, where they meet young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his mother
( pernilla august
)
. qui
- gon knows that the force is storng with young anakin
, annd so the jedi knights take the boy iwth them on thier journeys
. tjhe bad guys are darth maul
and darth sidious
, neither of whom ahev enough lines to register as characters
. htere isn
' t anything particularly wrong with this storey whn looking at it in synopsis form
. the way lucas has h
andled it
,
however
, it unsatisfactory
. frist ofthe all
, we don
' t learn one single thing about qui
- gon jinn
. nto one thing
. what was his life like before this film
? well
, i imagine he didn
' t hvae noe
. that
' s why he feels like a plot divice
. thsi probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role
,
and why he
' s recently retired from film
( i don
' t blame him
, honestly
)
. obi
- wan
, a character i ws really looking foward tothe learning omre baout
, is even less interesting
. mcgregor has just a faw lines
, so anyone hoping tothe see yhe engaging young actor in a great performence is urged to look elsewhere
. since these two men are tyhe focus ofthe the phantom menace
, lucas hasnt served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie
. things start tothe pik up when our characters triarch tatooine
; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed
- out chracter in teh film
, anbd lloyd doesnt a
thoughtful job iwth the role
. i wass also hugely empressed with the s
and speeder scene
; rarely is an action sequence so fast annd so exciting
. annd when anakin syas goodbye to his mother
, i found it moving
. aslo fairly good is portman
,
and she manages to give a littel depth tothe a character where no depth has been written
. jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i
' ve ever had to endure
,
but he
' s more interesting tahn most ofthe the humans
. as soon as the relativly
- brief segment onthe tatooine is over
, it
' s bakc to the mind
- numbing special effects
and depthless action scenes
. i
' ve seen many movies thyat qualify as
" spacial effects extravaganzas
,
"
but the phantom menace is the first one i
' ve seen taht had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes inot the movie
. the reason is obvious
: george lucas has no restraint
. i can
' t say tht i didn
' t find the effects original
, because i doed
-
- thte final battle between darth maul
, obi
- wan
,
and qui
- gon isnt visually exceptional
, as is most of the film
. bu i aslo found tjhe effects deadening adn tiresome
. my breaking point ws near the end of the picture
, as anakin is getting questioned by yoda annd thte other jedi masters
; in the background
, we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky
, adn i wnated that to go away
. can
' t we ahve one stinking scene that isn
' t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot
? i got so sick ofthe looking at tghe cgi characters anbd spaceships
and planets
and backgrounds taht i really just wanted tothe go outside
and look at a fysical l
andscape fo a few hours
.
and
then there
' s the question ofthe magic
. what wass lost in thte sixteen years between the phantom menace anbd return ofthe the jedi
? i have a feeling thyat lucas was so focused onthe how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it shoud feel
. john williams
' familiar score isnt no halp
, nor is lucas
' direction
. i thiunk it comes right down to characters
: there are none here
. i longed for the magnetic presence of han
, luke
,
and leia
,
but i got no such thing
. anbd what baout the rediculous expectations
? mine weren
' t thgat high
; i simply wanted a film that showed me tghe roots of tghe films that i growed uv loving
, a story that had a few characters
and a faw great spacial effects
. instead
, i got two hours
and fifteen mintues of a lifeless
and imaginative computer graphics sohw
. i don
' t hite the phantom menace as much as i resent it
: i
' d like to forget taht it exists
,
and
yet i cxan
' t
. it
' s here to stay
. i can only hope that episodes ii
and iii have something ofthe substance iin them
, because if they don
' t
, thne lucas will have pulled off the impossible task ofthe destroying his pwn indestructible series
