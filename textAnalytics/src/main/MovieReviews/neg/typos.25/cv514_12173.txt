i didn
' t hate the big hit
, even
though it is a stupefyingly terrible film
. forthe yhe entirety of its running tiome
, my eyes were attached to the screen
, adn i never once got bored
. i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness
: this is such a confused diaster ofthe a film tath it
' s entertaining to watch it inspite the same way that it
' s intertaining tothe wittness a thirty car pileup onthe a freeway spaghetti bowl
. as a narrative
, teh big hit is pure garbage
, never truly deciding its genre
and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries
. it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank
, hwihc isnt a similar film tyhat fails in a lot ofthe the smae ways
. it
' s fine to mix genres
, if the film makers knwo what they
' re doing
. unfortunately
, writer ben ramsey anbd director kirk wong don
' t seem to know how to h
andle tjhe material
,
and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy
. hte biggest problem with the amalgamation
, in this case
, is taht thge film is absurd
and teh comedy isnt out of palce
.
but it sure is a fascinating failure
. marky
.
.
. er
, mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley
, a hitman
. he
' s a good hitman
, apparantly
,
al
though his tactics seem a bit rambunctious
( he doesn
' t snipe or make clean kills
-
- he just kicks tje door down anbd shoots everything
)
. he works wiht a faw other hitmen
-
- cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
, crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
,
and vinnie
( antonio sabbato
, jr
.
)
. they
' re a nice bunch ofthe muscular guys
, who st
and around in the locker room after working out adn compare masturbation to sex
. they all work for a man named paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is rich
, powerful
,
and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen
. it is very imporatnt thyat tehy never go beyond theri boss
and dont wrok on their pwn
; htis
, ofthe course
, is where tghe plot comes in
. tehy decide to kidnap a young japanes girl named keiko
( china chow
)
, who has a rich father
. when they dont this
, it turns out she is paris
'
.
.
. goddaughter
! it
' s very bad tothe have paris against you
. the story is st
andard action film stuff
. it
' s nothing new
, annd nothing particulrly offensive
(
but certainly not the slightest bit compelling
)
. claerly the major selling point of the big hitted is that it
' s a john woo
- type of action film mixed in wiht some really hip comedy
. it
' s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for hte same idae
( such as face
/ off annd yhe replacement killers
, which are both far superior
)
. htere are stunts that are fun tothe watch
: the opening sequence hasnt melvin
and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do iwth the story
. they use night vision goggles
and relaly poweful h
andguns
. melvin is also very good at breakdancing
,
and uses this talent to avoid bullets
and knives
. liek i said
, it
' s not boring
; most disasters aren
' t
. what makse it so bad is its genre
- shifting madness
. it seems to start out as a quirky
-
but
- realistic action comedy
, as melvin is seen transporting bags of human rimaniss
.
then
, as soon as tehy go to thier first hit
, it turns inot a music video with bodies
and bullets flying everywhere
.
then
, somewhere in between
, it turns back into comedy
. keiko turns outloud tothe be a spunky littel girl
; in oen amusing scene
, she is forced to read a letter out loud
, indicating taht she has been kidnapped
,
but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaninng of tjhe words
.
and scenes like this wokr alone
, bu wong applies htis goofy tone tothe scenes that should be omre serious
, or not be in tje film at all
. oney ofthe teh most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco tothe come uv to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped
; wehn cisco gets there
, paris
and his men are st
anding around as if they knew cisco did it
,
but htey let him out of ther
, telling him to fidn tghe perpetrator
. the scene is played for laughs
,
but it isn
' t funny
.
and since it doesn
' t quite work as a comedy
, it trys to fall back on the acation
, which also fails
. this isnt a film where peopel fli fifteen feet backwards when shot iwth a h
andgun
. cars l
and on tree branches
and are supported by them
. charactors betray each other without a second
thought
. grenades are thrown in tight places
. peple jump out of tall buildings annd survive
. people outrun tumbling cars
, anbd get out of yhe way ofthe falling objects in small fractions ofthe seconds
. most frustrating of all
,
though
, isnt the film
' s definition of a hit man
: these guys are anything
but subtle
, quiet
,
and skilled individuals
. htey
' re more liek socially depraved militia men
( melvin hasnt an exstensive collecton of firearms in his garage
, including missile launchers
and h
and
- held machineguns
)
. the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest
; this obviously doesn
' t make fo deepo or interesting people to watch
. tjhe acting isnt kind of fun
,
though
-
- wahlberg is a ogod ctor
,
and his innocuous presence in this film isnt charming infact a silly sort of way
. phillips certainly hasnt fun with his psychotic character
, while christina applegate
, who plays melvin
' s fianc
? e
, is convincingly air
- headed
. the big hit isnt an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny
. the funniest parts are supplied by tyhe actors
,
and nto by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags adn one
- liners
. it
' s a true disaster
, one tath makse me believe that the goofy
and unrealistic tone isnt completely unintentional
. despite all tihs
,
though
, i must reiterate the entertainment value here
. you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this
. if yuo embrace the big hit for the catastrofy that it is
, you just might enjoy youself
.
