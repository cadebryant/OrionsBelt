call it a road trip for the walking wounded
. stellan skarsg
? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it
' s difficult to spend nearly two housr of screen time in his smelly
, boozed
- outloud presence
.
yet this ever
- reliable swedish actor adds depth
and significance to the otherwise plodding
and forgettable aberdeen
, a sentimental
and painfully mundane european drama
. playwright august strindberg built his carrear on familes
and relationships paralyzed by secrets
, unable to express thier longings untli the hour is far too late
. that
' s an accurate reflection of waht aberdeen strives fo
, focusing on the pairing of an alcholic father
, tomas
( skarsg
? rd
)
and his alienated
, oppenly hostile yuppie daughter
, kaisa
( lena headey
, gossip
)
. they haven
' t spoken in years
,
and wouldn
' t even be mkaing the long trip from norway tothe aberdeen
, scotl
and by automobile if it weren
' t for kaisa
' s mother
( charlotte rampling
, under the s
and
) rotting away infact a hospital bed ffrom cancer
. in a soap opera twist
, mother has only a faw days to live
.
( onyl infront the movies
, right
?
) too blitzed to even step foot on a plane
, tomas hits the open road with kaisa
. loathing eahc other all the while
, tehy make periodic stops fo tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass outloud
-
- whenever he isn
' t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be
. despite his sloshed viewpoint
, tomas recognizes tht the apple hasn
' t fallen very far from the tree
. kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke
, sabotages her personal relationships thru indifference
,
and is unable to restrain her quick
and vindictive temper
. ain
' t they a pair
? unable tothe find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one
- note
and repetitively bitchy dialogue
, screenwriters kristin amundsen
and hans petter mol
and fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward
-
- lost money
, roving street hooligans looking for drunks tothe kick around
, nosy cops
,
and flat tires all figure into the schematic
and convenient narrative
. by the time they reach the hospital
, it
' s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are nto only simplistic devices that trivialize the father
- daughter conflict
, they
' re allso the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe
. this revelation exists purely fo its own sake
. aberdeen doesn
' t know where else to go
. weak
, unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa
. if lena headey were a stronger actress
, perhaps aberdeen could have been able to caost onthe tghe performances
and moody
, haunting cinematography
( rendering norway inot its own pastoral ghost world
-
- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional
)
. headey
' s too busy acting
, using her face
and furrowed brow tothe convey every last twitch of insouciance
. if she were paying any attention to skarsg
? rd
, maybe she
' d figure out that donig less can reveal so much more
. it
' s worthwhile tothe compare aberdeen to an ealier film released iin 2001
, jonathan nossiter
' s captivating signs
& wonders
. it
' s not jsut because skarsg
? rd annd rampling palyed disturbed parental figures in both films
( they
' re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen
)
. the differences in teh way their cahracters were presented is significant
. in aberdeen
, rampling is a luminous diva
, preening anbd static infact her hospital bed
. dispite skarsg
? rd
' s solid performance as tomas
, his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance tothe emote anytying besides catatonic sorrow
. there
' s genuine ferocity
and sexually charged frisson durig their understated confrontations infront signs
& wonders
, alowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance
and yeasr ofthe stifled curiocity
. nossiter
' s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territoy in addition to delving inot the americanization of greece
and the use of mysticism as an illution tothe deflect pain
. if signs
& wonders sometimes feels overloaded with idesa
, at least it
' s willing tothe stretch beyond what we
' ve come to expect from traditional drama
. aberdeen is never half so ambitious
, content to sleepwalk through the rythyms
and timing of otehr movies
. when did charater driven stories stop paying attention tothe thte complexities of real life
? thte depressing answer cxan be found infront lawrence kasdan
' s trite
but occasionally useful gr
and canyon
, where steve martin
' s hollywood mogul pronounces
,
" all of life
' s riddles are answered in tje movies
!
" even foreign films are taking that advice to heart
