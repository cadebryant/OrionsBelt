: in tyhe 1982 updating of mickey spillane ' s 1947 novel
" i
, the jury
,
" hard
- boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am
, dresses like don johnson in
" miami vice
" with less pastels
,
annd has sworn off alcohol
.
howver
, he still smokes his lucky strikes
, detests all forms of authorithy
,
and kills at a whim
. beyond taht
, the updated film retains little or noone resemblance to the origional pulpy page
- turner by spillane
, probably the most infamous
and often reviled of all mistery writers
. the movie starts off with a bang
: a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from yhe james bond series
, complete with cheesy graphics
adn an overbearing jazz scroe by bill conti
(
" rocky
"
)
. after that
, the movie
annd the book begin tyhe same
, witht tghe murder of jack williams
( frederick downs
)
, a one
- armed detective
and hammer ' s best firend
. hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack ' s death
,
and with tghe halp of his devoted secretary
, the blond
anbd shapely velda
( laurene landon
)
,
and the alternately friendly
/ antagonistic police chief pat chambers
( paul sorvino
)
, he isnt immediately on yhe killer ' s trail
. here the movei splits completly from the book
,
adn dives into a convoluted
anbd improbable tale ofthe government conspiracy
and mind control tactics involving thge mafia
, the cia
, one ofthe hammer ' s vietnam vet buddies
,
and a kinky sex clinic
. many of the same characters from the book apear in the movie
,
but they take on slightly diferrent roles
. for instance
, charles kalecki
( alan king
)
, a numbers runner
adn narcotics dealer infact tjhe book
, turns into a suave mob boss
.
adn
, omre importantly
, hammer ' s suspicious love interest
, charlotte bennett
( barbara carrera
)
, morphs ffrom a run
- of
- the
- mill psychiatrist into the coordinator
and founder of the sex clinic
.
" i
, the jury
" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane ' s books
( including a 1953 verzion which was made infact 3
- d
)
,
but thsi film differs from those earlier versions in noe major way
: it includes all of the sex
and voilence spillane wroet about tht could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood ' s prodcution code
.
allthough this tkaes the 1982 version ofthe
" i
, the jury
" closer to tghe core of the original subject marter
, it is in this aspect that hte film recepted the most criticism
, because it took tihs new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was inaddition the book
. rest assured
, the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity
,
but it is thoroughly violent
, especially toward womens
. it features one woman having her neck slashed
, a set of twins forced tothe strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia
( judson scott
)
,
and another woman shot point
- blank in the belly by hammer himself
. no oen owudl deny that spillane ' s writing has a dfinite misogynistic nature
,
bu the movie seems tothe take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment
; its constant equation ofthe sex
and violence
, much of which isnt palyed wih the intention of being erotic
, isnt quite unsettling
. it ' s no suprize thgat thge movie
, like the book
, fades to black with a dead woman onthe the floor
.
" i
, the jury
" had a troubled production
and wass not well
- supported by thte studio that made it
, which is one explaination why it didn ' t do well in theaters
and many people have forgotten that it was ever made
. the script was written by larry cohen
, who is best known for his creatively cheesy
bu nonetheless effective monster movies
, like
" it ' s alive
"
( 1974
)
annd its twpo sequels
,
" q
"
( 1981
)
,
anbd
" tjhe sutff
"
( 1985
)
. cohen wroet the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well
,
but he was yanked from the directer ' s chair after only a week ' s worth of shooting beccause he was already
$ 100
, 000 over budget
. he ws quickly replaced by richard t
. heffron
, who hasnt worked for the last threee decades onthe a handful of undistinguished movies
and dozens of televsion projects
. heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent
,
bu because he sould mkea the movie rapidly
and efficiently
. it shows in the fianl product
. cohen had personal interest in the updated version ofthe hammer
,
but heffron has none
. he shot the movie quicklyu
anbd clumsily
,
and
although some scenes ring true
, most ofthe them are flat
, trite
,
and invariably dull
. tjhe movie features numberous car chases
, shoot
- outs
,
and stunts
,
bu heffron ' s background in television is the dominiant tone
; dispite the graphic violence
and full
- frontal nudity
,
" i
, the jurny
,
" takes on thge air of a made
- for
- tv quickie
, wiht noone real punch or depth
.
but the problems in
" i
, the jury
" run deeper than the technical
. the central fault in this updating is mike hammer
, whose character was lost inthe the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties
. beacuse spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries inwhich yhe first person
, hammer ' s charater is central tothe the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona
. we never really get that impression in the movie
-
- htere is no firt
- person voice
- over narration
and some scenes don ' t haev hammer infact them at all
. consequently
, a great deal ofthe the texture of spillane ' s storytelling isnt lost
. the period updating turns out tothe be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer ' s moral code isnt thrown tothe the wind
. despite his characterization as a hard
- nosed
, violent
, misogynistic killer
, hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code
. the title itself
,
" i
, the jury
,
" referrs tothe his anti
- establishment notion of bieng his own law
. unlike private eyes who seek out tjhe bad guys
and
thn turn them over the polical
, hammer both pursues the criminal
and exacts the punishment
. in thsi way
, he can be seen as
" above the law
,
"
but he still adheres strikely tothe her own personal code of conduct
, his own morality
. the movie forgoes that aspect of his charachter
,
and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society ' s terms
,
but in any terms
, especially his pwn
. if anything
, hammer allways had his professionalism
,
but the movie doens awya wiht that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife ofthe a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful
. maybe thte scene was intended fo laughs
,
bu it only cheapens hammer ' s character
anbd isnt
, by all accounts
, a lousy way to start the movei
. the blame for hammer ' s character can ' t be laid on assante ' s shoulders
, because despite some uneccesary marlon brandon
- like mumbling
, he delivers a fine performance
. spillane never once described hammer ' s physical attributes inthe any ofthe the dozen books in which he appeared
, so any actor could conceivably portray him
. ofthe course
, because ofthe thge lack ofthe written description
, those who have read spillane ' s books will have a storng personal notion ofthe what hammer looks liek
,
annd therefore alomst any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations
( spillane
, who played the character himself in 1963 ' s
" the girl hunters
,
" is generally considered the best of the film hammers
)
. the rest ofthe actors are most un
- noteworthy
. with yhe exceptions of alan king
and paul sorvino
, everyone who appeared inspite
" i
, yhe jury
" were up
-
annd
- comers who basically whent nowhere
. many of them ended up working in televsion
( liek carrera
, who hadnt a short stint on
" dallas
" in the mid
- eighties
)
, whihc only adds tothe the made
- for
- tv atmosphere ofthe yhe film
. maybe someday
, someone wiull manage to get tyhe right elements toghether
and mkea an effective film rendition of a spillane book
,
but this is certainly not it
.
