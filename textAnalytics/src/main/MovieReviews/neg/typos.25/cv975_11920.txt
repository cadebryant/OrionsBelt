: in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane
' s 1947 novel
" i
, the jurny
,
" hard
- boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vte who drives a shiny bronze trans am
, dresses like don johnson in
" miami vice
" with less pastels
,
and has sworn off alcohol
. howver
, he still smokes his lucky strikes
, detests all forms ofthe authority
,
and kills at a whim
. beyond that
, the updated film retains little or no ressemblance to thge original pulpy page
- turner by spillane
, probably tjhe most infamous adn oftenly reviled of all mystery writers
. thge movie starts off with a bang
: a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series
, complete with cheesy graphics
and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti
(
" rocky
"
)
. affter that
, thte movie
and the book begin the smae
, with the murder of jack williams
( frederick downs
)
, a oen
- armed detective
and hammer
' s best firend
. hammer declares thta he will seek vengeance for jack
' s death
, anbd with teh halp of his devoted secretery
, the blond
and shapely velda
( laurene l
andon
)
, adn the alternately freindly
/ antagonistic polical chief pat chambers
( paul sorvino
)
, he is immediately on the killer
' s trail
. here tje movie splits completely ffrom the book
, anbd dives inot a convoluted
and improbable tale ofthe governmnet conspiracy
and mind controll tactics involving tje mafia
, the cia
, noe of hammer
' s vietnam vet buddies
, annd a kinky sex clinic
. many of teh smae characters from the book appear in the movie
,
but they take on slightly different roles
. fo instance
, charles kalecki
( alan king
)
, a numbers runner annd narcotics dealer inspite the book
, turns into a suave mob boss
.
and
, more importantly
, hammer
' s suspicious lveo interest
, charlotte bennett
( barbara carrera
)
, morphs fomr a run
- ofthe
- the
- mill psychiatrist inot the coordinator
and founder of the sex clinic
.
" i
, the jurny
" isnt one of sevral cinematic renditions of spillane
' s books
( incuding a 1953 version which ws made in 3
- d
)
, bu this film differs fomr thsoe earlier versions inspite one major way
: it includes all of the sex
and violence spillane wrote about thta could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood
' s production code
.
al
though tihs tkaes the 1982 verzion of
" i
, the jurny
" closer to the core of the origonal subject matter
, it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism
, because it took this newyorker license to extremes thast many argued surpassed wqat was in the book
. rest assured
, the movei not onyl includes a gerat deal of nudity
,
but it is thoroughly violent
, especially toward womens
. it features one woman having her neck slashed
, a setted ofthe twins forced to strip befor being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia
( judson scott
)
,
and another woman shot point
- blank in the belly by hammer himself
. no one would deny that spillane
' s writing has a definite misogynistic nature
,
but tjhe movie seems to tkae it a step furuther by giving it such glorious screen treatment
; its constatn equation ofthe sex
and violence
, much of which is played with tje intention of bieng erotic
, is quite unsettling
. it
' s no surprize that the movie
, like the book
, fades to black with a dead woman on tyhe floor
.
" i
, the jurny
" had a troubled production adn was not well
- supported by hte studio that made it
, which is one explanation why it didn
' t do well in theaters annd many people have forgotten that it ws ever made
. the script wass written by larry cohen
, who is best known for his creatively cheesy
but nontheless effective monster movies
, like
" it
' s alive
"
( 1974
)
and its twpo sequels
,
" q
"
( 1981
)
, annd
" the stuff
"
( 1985
)
. cohen wroet the script thinking he wass oging to helm the project as well
,
but he was yanked from the director
' s chair affter only a week
' s worth ofthe shooting because he was lready
$ 100
, 000 over budget
. he was quicklyu replaced by richard t
. heffron
, who has worked fo the last three decades on a h
andfull of undistinguished movies
and dozens of televsion projects
. heffron ws obviously brought inaddition not for his talent
,
but because he could make the movie rapidly annd efficiently
. it shows in tje final product
. cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer
,
but heffron has none
. he shot thte movie quickly adn clumsily
,
and
al
though some scenes ring true
, most of them are flat
, trite
,
and invariably dull
. the movie features numberous car chases
, shoot
- outs
, adn stunts
,
but heffron
' s backgorund in televsion is the dominant tone
; dispite the graphic violence
and full
- frontal nudity
,
" i
, the jury
,
" takes on the air of a made
- fo
- tv quickie
, wiht noone real punch or depth
. bu the problems in
" i
, the jury
" run deeper than the technical
. the central fault in thsi updating is mike hammer
, whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties
. becasue spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries infront the first person
, hammer
' s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona
. we never really get that impression inthe the movei
-
- there is no first
- person voice
- over narration
and some scenes don
' t have hammer in them at all
. consenquently
, a great deal of the texture ofthe spillane
' s storytelling is lost
. the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer
' s moral code is thrown to the wind
. despite his characterization as a hard
- nosed
, violent
, misogynistic killer
, hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code
. the title itself
,
" i
, the jury
,
" refrers to his anti
- establishment notion of bieng his own law
. unlike private eyes who seek outloud the bad guys
and
then turn them over the police
, hammer both pursues the criminal
and exacts yhe punishment
. iin htis way
, he can be seen as
" above the law
,
"
but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct
, his own morality
. the movie forgoes that aspect of his character
,
and hammer comes off not onyl as amoral in society
' s terms
,
but in any terms
, especially his own
. if anytying
, hammer alwyas had his professionalism
,
but tje movei does away with tht in hte first threee minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife ofthe a client who had paide him to fidn out if thta wife was bieng unfaithful
. maeby the scene was intended for laughs
, bu it onyl cheapens hammer
' s character
and is
, by all accounts
, a lousy way tothe start the movie
. the blame for hammer
' s character can
' t be laid onthe assante
' s shoulders
, because despite smoe unnecessary marlon br
andon
- like mumbling
, he delivers a fine performance
. spillane never once described hammer
' s physical attri
butes iin any ofthe teh dozen books inaddition which he appeared
, so any actor could conceivably protray him
. of course
, becouse of thte lack ofthe writed description
, those who haev read spillane
' s books will ahve a strong peronal notion ofthe what hammer looks liek
,
and therefore almost any screen incarnation wiull somehow fall short of expectations
( spillane
, who played the charachter himself in 1963
' s
" the girl hunters
,
" is generally considered hte best of tyhe film hammers
)
. the rest of actors are most un
- noteworthy
. with the exceptions of alan king
and paul sorvino
, everyone who appeared in
" i
, the jury
" weere uv
-
and
- comers who basically went nowhere
. many of them ended uv wokring in televsion
( like carrera
, who hadnt a short stint on
" dallas
" in the mid
- eighties
)
, which onyl adds tothe the made
- for
- tv atmosphere ofthe the film
. maybe someday
, someone will manage to get thte right elements together adn amke an effective film rendition of a spillane book
,
but this is certainly not it
.
