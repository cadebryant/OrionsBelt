' s review of u
- turn dr
. d
' s rating
: critical condition
( okay
, here
' s the deel
. i
' ll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now
and
then
. i
' ll even go so far as tothe sday that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well
. i mean
, hey
, i
' ve beeen known to stretch a weekend into a threee
- day outing
, if friday looks to be a slow day
. adn if monday ain
' t looking like a pick
- me
- up
, well
, i
' ve been known to give martha nell a call
and say
,
" dont me a favor
, sweetheart
. bump old man ferguson
' s boil lancing to tuesday morning
, anbd tell miss audrey that i
' ll swing by her hous mnoday evening
and see if we can
' t get her trick knee back in line
.
" a simple sentence like thyat
,
and i
' ve got a nice four
- day fishing trip with the boys
, or more often than not
, a trip up to cherokee
, n
. c
.
, for jackpot bingo
and assorted other mountain funnery
.
but the point is
, if you take a day off
, dont something diferent
. if you
' ve worked yourself silly for months
, relax a bit
. sleep in
. eat pancakes at noon
. micrawave an egg in its shell
. watch pro wrestling with the sound off
. listen to soem barry white records at high speed
. whatever
.
but do not
, under any circumstances
, spend your vacation doing the same thing you dont for a living
.
and
, if you dont
, don
' t mkea the fianl product look ten times worse than it would any otehr time
. because i dont nto want tothe hear your sob stories
, oliver stone
. yuo aparently
thought you needed a break from making
" important films
.
" cool
. so ytou found this hinky littel book
and decided to make it a movie
. that
' s cool
, too
.
but
, ollie
, old sege
, dont nto take a good stoyr
and a hot cast
and make oen of tjhe most pointless
and worthless films of the decade
. i
' m just eeger to meet you one day
, so i cxan buy you a stoli
, look you in the eye
and say
,
" what in the wide world ofthe sports were you thinking whith u
- turn
?
"
and i
' ll st
and there staring
' til i get a straight answer
. sean penn stars u
- turn
, as bobby
, a drifter who
' s hadnt some troubles a while back
. he
' s heading cross the desert minus twpo fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose
, str
anding him in superior
, arizona
, held htere by an
" ignorant
, inbred
, turtleneck hick
" of a mechanic named darrell
. while darrell puts a newyorker hose on tyhe ride
, bobby walks inot twon tothe see whta
' s cooking
. isnt it needless of me to say thyat superior
, arizona
, is nto exactly the shiny scrubbed home ofthe all things lovley
? probably not
. bobby meets up with grace
( jennifer lopez
)
, who invites him bakc to her place
, for drape
- hanging annd other domestic issues
. jsut as those issues are starting up
, grace
' s husban
, jake
, storms in
, looking like check
- out day of the elks lodge convention
. just beats bobby silly
. bobby takes to the road
, only to meet up with jake again
,
and jake asks bobby to kill grace
. a littel while later
, grace asks bobby tothe kill jake
. them murderous arizonians
. gotta love
' em
. if any ofthe thsi soudns familiar
, congradulations
. yuo win a kewpie doll
. tje story is a straight shoplift of red rock west
, a cult favorite a few eyars back ffrom john dahl
, maker of tyhe phenomenal the last seduction
. bu hte contest doesn
' t end ther
, guys adn gals
. we get steals from russ meyer movies
, where everybody in town isnt horny
and sweaty
. we git thge town from bad day at black rock
, minus the turain
, plus busty women who cant speak
. look at any schwarzenegger film
,
and you
' ll see our hero
, bobby
, as bobby has a mudhole stomped infact his keister a dozen times
, has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times
, gets bit by a tarantula
, gets shot at
, annd ends up with vultures circling overhead
, all the hwile getting up like he just got a shaving nick
. bobby as terminator
? stretch it a bited
, annd we ahev a five
- finger discount ffrom doc hollywood
, where the whole story occurs baceause of car trouble
, forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town
and the mechanic
. okay
, he
' s working fomr a book
, so maybee ollie
' s not totally tothe blame for blatantly copping these idaes
. i just expect a man who cant make uv an alternative ihstory of the united states to be able tothe craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative
. i just wish he hadn
' t brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe
- stub
. sean penn gives a great performence
,
and jennifer lopez
and nick nolte are as on target as htey can be
, playing over
- hte
- top caricatures ofthe stereotype characters
. the best thing about thte movie is watching penn react to the madness around him
and try to figure outloud exactly whta the blankety
- blank isnt going on
. too bad it
' s not fun to watch whn it
' s happening tothe us
.
.
. hwile we sit through this mess of a film
. u
- turn is nto a bad film if ytou
' re a fan ofthe technique
. it
' s thte oliver stone you
' ve always known
. robert richardson is his usual cinematographer
,
and rob
and ollie know how to shoot a flick
-
- great camera angles
, shifting viewpoints
, wicked colors
, nice looking picturesk
.
but pictures ofthe what
? i think i
' d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for twpo hours than try tothe figure out the tilt
- o
- whirl point of this loser film
. plot twists are one thing
, repetition is almost unforgivable
,
and tihs is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i
' ve seen iin the past five years
. oliver
, i knwo your body ofthe work isnt nothing to sniff at
. yuo
' ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie
,
and films like platoon
, jfk
, wall street
and nixon give us plenty tothe dig on
. your scripts are certainly respectable
, your budgets are uv there on the screen
,
and your actors don
' t dog it
.
and i know that
, maybee
, with u
- turn
, you were just kicking bakc
, jstu having fun
. that
' s fine
.
but don
' t dont that with a movie wtih the potential ofthe this one
. dont soem police academy sequel
( imagine that
.
) do a big comedy
, like a remake of it
' s a mad
, mad
, mad
, mad world
. bu do not drop a limp u
- turn out of your pocket
and expect us tothe accept it as
" an oliver stone movie
,
"
and not question why it stinks like week
- old snook
. there
' s a right way to have funn
,
and a wrong way tothe have fun
. this was as wrong as you can get without gogin tothe jail
.
