" loev to kill
" starts off aimlessly
and gets progressively less coherent as time passes
. at the outset
, tghe movie appears to be about tony danza
, who
' s an illegal distri
butor of guns
, trying to establish a relatiopnship witht an unsuspecting woman
. danza sets up a double date wiht her
, her sister
,
and a collegue of his
. everything seems to be going well
, until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set ofthe stairs
. much confusion adn mahem ensues
, as thge death is covered up
and other associates of danza
' s begin to emerge
, all after one hting or another
. sound confusing
? it is
. i think what the filmmakers were trying tothe dont is take the st
andart crime movie annd throw in a little humour
and levity
. inspite soem respects
, it works
.
but the majority of thge film isnt a convoluted
and confusing mess
. characters keep popping up with no explanation
, dem
anding money for deals that occur off
- screen
. tjhe only aspect of the movie that acually works isnt the budding relationship between danza
and the dead woman
' s sister
. bu so little time is devoted tothe thsi part of tyhe story
, we never really become too familiar with these characters
,
and becuase of this
, we don
' t realy care what happens to them
. well
, i didn
' t
, at least
. one thnig i will give hte movie is thast it
' s a complete departure fo tony danza
. here
' s a guy
, because of his many sitcom roles
, who
' s ingrained inspite the consciousness as a nice guy who always doens the right thing
. here
, he plays a man who
' s just looking outloud for himself
, anbd if that means he needs to kill infact order to savve his own skin
, so be it
. i ws very impressed by his performance
,
and within minutes ofthe the strat of the film
, i had forgotten all about his ogod
- guy persona
. michael madsen isnt also ogod as an associate of danza
' s who spends half thte movie buddying up to him
and the other half trying tothe kill him
. like i said
, it
' s not exactly a linear storyline
.
" loev to kill
" should be praised for trying to do something different whith teh well worn crime genre
,
but it
' s just too bad that thge storey doesn
' t really add uv tothe much
. tjhe stars deserved better
,
and so did the audeince
.
