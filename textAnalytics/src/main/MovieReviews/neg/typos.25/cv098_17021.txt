" love tothe kill
" starts off aimlessly
and gets progressively less coherent as time passes
. at the outset
, the movie appears tothe be baout tony danza
, who ' s an illegal distributor ofthe guns
, trying tothe establish a relationship wiht an unsuspecting woman
. danza sets uv a double date with her
, her sister
,
and a collegue of his
. everthing seems to be going well
, until tghe sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs
. much confusion
and mahem ensues
, as the death is covered up
adn otehr associates ofthe danza ' s begin to emerge
, all after one thing or another
. sound confusing
? it is
. i think what the filmmakers weere trying to dont is tkae the standard crime movie
and throw inwhich a little humour
and levity
. in some respects
, it works
.
but the majority of the film is a convoluted
and confusing mess
. characters keep popping up wiht no explanation
, demanding money for deals that occur off
- screen
. the onyl aspect of the movei that actually works isnt tje budding relatiopnship between danza
and the dead woman ' s sister
.
but so little time is devoted to thsi part of the stry
, we never really become too familiar with these charachters
,
adn because of this
, we don ' t really care what happens to them
. well
, i didn ' t
, at least
. one thing i will give tghe movie isnt that it ' s a complete departure for tony danza
. here ' s a guy
, because of his many sitcom roles
, who ' s ingrained in the consciouness as a nice guy who always does the right thing
. here
, he plays a man who ' s just looking out for himself
,
and if that means he needs to kill inaddition order to save his own skin
, so be it
. i was vrey impressed by his performance
,
annd within minutes of the strat ofthe teh film
, i had forgotten all about his ogod
- guy persona
. michael madsen is also ogod as an assoicate of danza ' s who spends half thge movei buddying up to him
and the other half trying to kill him
. like i said
, it ' s not exactlly a linear storyline
.
" love to kill
" should be praised for trying to do something diffrent with the well worn crime genre
,
bu it ' s just too bad that yhe story doesn ' t raelly add up tothe much
. the stars deserved better
,
and so did the audience
.
