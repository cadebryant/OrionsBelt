. review
:
" pearl harbor
" is a perfect example of movies as product rether than as art
. it is little more tahn a crassly
- calculated atempt to woo the masses
, enticing them with big stars
, big effects
, anbd a big setting
-
-
but noone heart
. it isnt difficult tothe criticise the actors
, because they dont everything the movie dem
ands of them
. sadly
, this amounts to barely omre than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script r
andall wallace wroet iwth his right h
and at thte smae time as he was writing
" pearl harbor
" wtih his left
. the plot here isnt pure cliche
,
and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop
. there is no genuine exploration of whta pearl harbor meant to the united states
, annd no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii
. instead
, there isnt just an assembly
- line lvoe triangle
, some empty patriotic rhetoric
,
and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial comm
anders
( when one intones
,
" i fear all we have done is tothe awaken a sleeping giant
"
, i nearly fell out of my seat
)
. to the movei
' s credit
, it does include a fantastic protrayal ofthe the attack itself
, an exciting
and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into tghe war
. if only thte remaining two hours hadnt been crafted with such skill
, perhaps thsi memorial day non
- event would hve beeen worth watching
.
