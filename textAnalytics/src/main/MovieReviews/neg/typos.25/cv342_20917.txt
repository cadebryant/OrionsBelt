adam s
andler vehicles are never anything special
,
but continue to make a load of money
. which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today
. while ogod comedies like rushmore
, tothe choose a recent example
, gets limited release anbd doesn
' t amking a lot of mnoey
, big daddy got a huge release
and has made a lot ofthe cash
. it
' s allso nothing special
and doesn
' t deserve the money it
' s making
.
but i digress
. s
andler plays sonny koufax
, a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age
. his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him
: either wise up annd get responsible
, or she
' s leaving him
. by a stange set of events
, koufax ends uv with julian
( played by twins cole
and dylan sprouse
) a five eyar old kid
. affter a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with teh child
, koufax decides he wants to keep thte child
.
however
, social worker mr brooks
( mostel
) finds outloud that koufax isn
' t yhe real father
and wnats to take julian bcak
. koufax along with his newyorker girlfriend layla
( lauren adams
) fight to keep tghe child
. big daddy really isn
' t that good
. many of the jokes revolve arund toilet humour
,
and supposably we are meant tothe find julian annd sonny peeing against a wall to be funny
. there
' s the occasional good one liner
,
but these are usually strangely delivered wrong
and lose most ofthe yhe humour
. the film
, after all theese silly gags
, thn suddenly turns sentimental
, annd this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous
. the cout scene at tje end of teh film is useless
and unbelievable
,
and not helped by the soppy overacting
. it
' s a poor attempt to win over tyhe audience
. adam s
andler basically plays the same role he has in his last fewd films
( exept the wedding singer
.
) joey lauren adams is much
, much better
, annd deserves a far better film than this trash
. steve buscemi pops uv in a funny cameo
, anbd his scenes are pretty funny
. rob schneider isnt also funny as a crazy delivery man
. thte two twins who play julian are o
. k
, tehy start outloud rather well
,
but
then becoming annoying
and brattish halfway through
and finally turn
' all american
' wholesome goodness at the end of the film
, where yhe tear juice is turned up high
. big daddy is really nothing special
,
and isnt nto even worth it for a faw chuckles
.
al
though it is catually well put together
, with nice direction
, good production design
and even some montages
, this professionalism can
' t halp thge fact that teh script
and characters are trash
. big daddy is for die hard fans ofthe s
andler
,
and thgat
' s about it
.
