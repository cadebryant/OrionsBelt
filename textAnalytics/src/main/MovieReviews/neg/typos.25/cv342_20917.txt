adam sandler vehicles are never anytying special
,
but continue tothe make a load of moeny
. whcih relaly goes to show thte sad state of cinema today
. while ogod comedies liuke rushmore
, to choose a recent exemple
, gets limited realease
and doesn ' t make a lot ofthe money
, big daddy got a huge release
and has made a lot of cash
. it ' s allso nothing spacial
and doesn ' t deserve the money it ' s makeing
.
but i digress
. sandler plays sonny koufax
, a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age
. his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him
: eather wise uv
and git responsible
, or she ' s leaving him
. by a strange set ofthe events
, koufax ends uv with julian
( plyed by twins cole
annd dylan sprouse
) a five year old kid
. after a failed attempt tothe impress his girlfriend with tje child
, koufax decides he wants tothe keep tje child
.
however
, social worker mr brooks
( mostel
) finds outloud that koufax isn ' t the real father
and wants tothe take julian back
. koufax along with his newyorker girlfriend layla
( lauren adams
) fight tothe keep the child
. big daddy really isn ' t that good
. many of the jokes revolve aroud toilet humour
,
annd supposedly we are meaned to find julian
adn sonny peeing against a wall tothe be funny
. there ' s the occasional good noe liner
,
but theese are usually strangely delivered wrong
and lose most of thge humour
. the film
, after all these silly gags
,
then suddenly turns sentimental
,
and this isnt where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous
. the court scene at thge end ofthe the film is useless
adn unbelievable
,
and nto helpped by thge soppy overacting
. it ' s a poor attempt to win over the audiance
. adam sandler basically plays the smae role he hasnt inthe his last few films
( except tyhe wedding singer
.
) joey lauren adams is much
, much better
,
and deserves a far better film thna this trash
. steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo
,
and his scenes are pretty funny
. rob schneider isnt also funny as a crazy delivery man
. the twpo twins who play julian are o
. k
, htey start out rather well
,
but
then becoming annoying
and brattish halfway thru
adn finally turn ' all american ' wholesome goodness at the end ofthe tyhe film
, where the tear juice is turned uv high
. big daddy is really nothing special
,
and is nto even worth it forthe a few chuckles
.
although it is actualyl well put toghether
, with nice direction
, ogod prodcution design
and even some montages
, htis professionalism cant ' t help the fact that the script
and characters are trash
. big daddy isnt for dieu hard fans ofthe sandler
,
and tht ' s baout it
.
