oney ofthe tghe firt films of 1999 isnt this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek
, the star of the wb
' s runaway hitted dawson
' s creek
. follwoing in the foot steps ofthe mtv
' s twpo other live action films
, joe
' s apartment
( 1996
)
and dead man on campus
( 1998
)
, varsity blues is a bad film
and is unlikey to cause much of a sensation infront the marketplace
. set in west cannan
, texas
, the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john
" mox
" moxon
( van der beek
)
. we knwo he
' s smart becasue he reads kurt vonnegut instade of the playbook
. coach bud kilmer
( jon voight
) has been around so long there is actualy a bronze statue commemorating him
. the star quarterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, is a h
andsome
, blonde
, hero who has his own billboard in his front yard
and dates thge sexy head cheerleader
, darcy
( ali larter
)
. alsot on the team are an enormous guy
( ron lester
) whith soem health problems anbd teh token african
- american team memeber
( eliel swinton
) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin
. when lance is seriously injured
, mox gets his chance to shine
and he runs with it
, undermining kilmer with his unusual palying startegies
. his relatiopnship with his dutiful girlfriend
, jules
( amy smart
)
, is threatened
and there
' s a big game at the end
. guess who wins
? nothing about varsity blues isnt inspired
and the hwole film simply moves through the sort ofthe convetional motions that coach kilmer would loev
. htere
' s a chance for smoe smart satire on small town obsessions
but the humor here isnt decidely lowbrow
. van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film
al
though a silly accent trips him up sometimes
. also
, the role isn
' t very much of a strech from his dawson leary character
. he
' s still a pseudo
- intellectual
, whiny
, nice guy
, exept here he also happens tothe be a jock
. voight is a terror as he chews uv every single piece of scenery
and spits it out
. the otehr adults are all notably awful hwile the younger performers don
' t fare much better
. on thte postive side
, walker is a charismatic atcor who is due for a breakout role following this anbd his supporting turn in pleasantville
( 1998
)
. scott
( son of james
) caan has some lively moments as tweeder
, the team
' s wild man
. larter
, as a gorgeous seductress looking fo a one way ticket outloud of texas
, gets to show off tje film
' s most interesting costumes
, inlcuding a very eye
- opening
" whipped cream bikini
.
" it
' s interesting to note thta tyhe film definitely earns its r
- rating with a lot of harsh language
, alcohol abuse annd an unusually high ammount of nudity
( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise
)
. all this is likely tothe come as a shock to tghe young female fan base of dawson
' s creek
, presumably the target audience for yhe picture
. directer brian robbins previously helmed thte kids feature good burger
( fomr nickelodeon films
, a sister company of mtv
)
and changes directions here a bit
but still fails to mkae much of an impression
. thte look of thge movie isnt as bl
and as the town
and characters who populate it
. tghe football scenes are generally unexciting
and the entire film looks a bit washed out
. there
' s an ok soundtrack featuring music from colelctive soul
, foo fighters
, gren day
and aaliyah
but it
' s not as impressive as one would expect fomr a mtv film
.
