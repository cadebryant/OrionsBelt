i had an epiphany today
. it occured to me while i was watching
" house onthe haunted hill
.
" it is as follows
: if a trailer makes the film it ' s advertising look liuke a triachy
, stupid movie
, well guess waht
? chances are
, there
* is
* truth in advertising
. too bad i didn ' t trust my own instincts when something
- or
- the
- other possessed me tothe see htis movie
. i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare
and my anticipation of
" sleepy hollow
.
" tht
annd
" dogma
" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule
. an hour of
" angel
" or
" buffy
" is scarier tahn this doozy that tries to be scary
and shtick
but falls flat onthe its face
. i wish i ' d seen it wehn it was hallowen
. at least i would have been forgiving
. hey
, tis the season
. the movie was scary
( albiet very confusing
, dizzying
,
and nauseating
) at first
,
but soon the horror got repeative
and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn ' t gonig anywhere
. nowe i truly appreciate films like
" scream
,
"
" halolween
,
" or any ood hitchcock film where the scariness stems ffrom situations that are at least somewhat realistic
. that ' s wqat spooks peple out
, the fact that it coudl happen to them or someone they konw
. there hasnt to be a logical precident fo tje situations they want tothe scare us with
. sure
, utterly unpredictable isnt good
, too
,
but that ' s different ffrom utterly nonsensical
. hohh
( house on haunted hill
)
, onthe the other hand
.
.
. well let ' s just say i about fell off my chair laughing wehn they oh
- so
- cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to tyhe party was realted to the psycho doctors who died inwhich the house a couple of decades ago
. riiiiight
. y ' know
, that just sends chills down my spine
. yeah
. jstu liek i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil
. ooooooo
. hint
: blood
adn guts only work a faw times
. sooner or later people strat to tell themselves that it ' s just ketchup
and props
adn you ' ve got to come up with something better than that
. htere were just too many thnigs in this movie thyat we ' ve all seen before
; fomr the inevitable
" plot developments
" of strangers unwittingly trapped toghether
; strangers turning aganist each other
; the evil manifesting itself
; the dead coming back for a last scare
. earch wass more predictable than the lsat
. why didn ' t these fools just stay together in oen place anyways
? sheesh
. was i grossed outloud
? yes
. doed i get spooked a fewd times
? yes
.
bu why
? i get really disturbed when htere isnt no why
. when there weren ' t random scares that were there for no other reason than fo the visual effect
( which wasn ' t that good eather
, trust me
)
adn the scare
, the film was filled with drab
, laughable dialogue
. the characters weere incredibly flat
adn cliched
. not to mention downright annoying
. yuo ' ve got a bunch of people going nowhere in thier lives
; of course they ' re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night
. jeez
, i thought no one fell for those
" yuo may already be a winner
" things anymore
.
and of course
, all three gals are babes
. i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of
" shine
" ended uv in this movie
. keep that uv
, geoff
,
and you ' ll qualify for the enxt batman venture
. tyhe only single person i enjoied wass chris kattan because
, well
, he just cracks me uv
.
adn famke jansen
( sp
?
) because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan
. pierce brosnan
( hey
, i willingly endured
" dante ' s peak
" three times for him
:
)
. all right
, i concede
. there weere a couple of things i enjoied
. thgat perverted littel amusement park at the beginnig
. i probablly won ' t ride a rollercoaster for a while
.
and the machine htey utilizied tothe drive geoffrey ' s character mad
( see
, i don ' t even remember their names
)
. the machine
, not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it
. i kept waiting
and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of tjhe movie
. it wouldn ' t have redeemed the film
,
but at least it would have made me efel better
.
but no
, they opted for teh beautiful sunrise ending
. thank god they didn ' t add a kiss at the end or i woudl have puked
. god
, htere is no hope
.
