i had an epiphany today
. it ocurred tothe me while i ws watching
" house onthe haunted hill
.
" it is as follows
: if a trailer mkaes tjhe film it
' s advertising look like a trashy
, stupid movei
, well guess what
? chances are
, ther
* is
* truth in advertising
. too bad i didn
' t trust my own instincts when something
- or
- the
- other possessed me to see this movie
. i blame it on my sudden craving fo a scare
and my anticipation ofthe
" sleepy hollow
.
" taht
and
" dogma
" started too late in yhe afternoon for my schedule
. an hour of
" angal
" or
" buffy
" isnt scarier than this doozy that tries to be skary adn shtick
but falls flat on its face
. i wish i
' d seen it when it ws halloween
. at least i owudl have been forgiving
. hey
, tis tje season
. the movei ws scary
( albeit very confusing
, dizzying
,
and nauseating
) at first
,
but soon the horror got repetitive
and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn
' t gogin anywhere
. now i truley appreciate films like
" scream
,
"
" halloween
,
" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic
. that
' s what spooks people outloud
, the fact thyat it could appen tothe them or someone they know
. there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want tothe scare us with
. sure
, utterly unpredictable is good
, too
,
but tyhat
' s different from utterly nonsensical
. hohh
( house on haunted hill
)
, on yhe otehr h
and
.
.
. well let
' s jstu say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh
- so
- cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to teh party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago
. riiiiight
. y
' know
, that just sends chills down my spine
. yeah
. just like i wet my pants when they told me the hous is evil
. ooooooo
. hint
: blood
and guts only work a few times
. sooner or later people start to tell themselfs that it
' s just ketchup adn props anbd you
' ve got to come up with something better tahn tath
. there were jsut too many thigsn in this movie that we
' ve all seen before
; ffrom the inevitable
" plot developments
" of strangers unwittingly trapped together
; strangers turning against each other
; the evil manifesting itself
; the dead comming back for a last scare
. each ws omre predictable thna the last
. why didn
' t these fools just stay together inspite oen place anyways
? sheesh
. ws i grossed out
? yes
. did i get spooked a few times
? yes
. bu why
? i get really disturbed when there isnt noone why
. when there weren
' t r
andom scares that were there for no otehr reason than for tjhe visual effect
( wich wasn
' t thyat ogod eather
, trust me
) anbd tghe scare
, the film was filled wih drab
, laughable dialogue
. the characters were incredibly flat
and cliched
. not tothe mention downright annoying
. you
' ve got a bunch of people going nowhere infront their lives
; of course htey
' re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them tothe provided tehy win a million dollars if they survive the night
. jeez
, i
thought no one fell for those
" ytou may already be a winner
" things anymore
.
and of course
, all three gals are babes
. i wonder how onthe earth the geoffrey rush of
" shine
" ended uv in this movie
. keep that up
, geoff
, annd yuo
' ll qualify for tghe next batman venture
. the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan becouse
, well
, he just cracks me up
.
and famke jansen
( sp
?
) becuase she reminds me of the delectable brosnan
. pierce brosnan
( hey
, i willingly endured
" dante
' s peak
" three times for him
:
)
. all right
, i concede
. ther were a couple of things i enjoyed
. that perverted little amusement park at tje beginning
. i probably won
' t ride a rollercoaster for a while
.
and tjhe machine they used to drive geoffrey
' s chracter mad
( see
, i don
' t even remember their names
)
. the machine
, not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin iin it
. i kept waiting
and waiting for that inevitible twist at tyhe end of the movei
. it wouldn
' t hvae redeemed the film
,
but at least it woudl have made me feel better
.
but no
, they opted fo the beautiful sunrise ending
. thank god tehy didn
' t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked
. god
, there isnt no hope
.
