the last of vampire
- films offers plenty ofthe blood
annd gore
,
but beyond that
- nothing
. jack crowm
( james woods
) is a proffesional vampire slayer that is secretly working fo yhe vatican
. his
and his men ' s mission is to clean the earth from vampires
. tehy hve lost count of how many vampires they haev slaughtered
,
but one hasnt always escaped them
. valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
- the dark messias
annd ruler of the undead thgat is older than tyme itself
. for all eternity thge vampires have seached for their salvation
- the black cross
. with tyhe cross in their possesion
, the vampires will be able to walk infact the sunlight
. after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth
.
.
. i have never liked john carpenter
annd his style
. affter seeing this film
, my opinions ahve nto changed
. john carpenter remains john carpenter
.
however
, because of the film ' s self
- irony
, black humour
anbd fascinating cinematography
, i owudl say that it is his greatest acheivement in a long
, long tiem
. neither the synopses or carpenter ' s direction are original
.
but ther are some things thta are interesting
. teh director ' s negative view on the catholic church
, for instance
. at the end of tyhe film it becomes clear that cardinal alba
( maximilian schell
) has simply used crow
and his team to find valek
, so that he would gain eternal life
. otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool
- drinking
, smoking
and breaking the rool of celibacy
. carpentery has created an interesting athmosphere
. set inaddition new mexican dessert
, he switches between bright golden sunrises
and bloody sundowns
, symbolically illustrating hte good
and the evil through light
annd darkness
. more thna anything in this film
, this simple illustration shows the battle beetwen good
and evil
. hte cinematography by gary b
. kibbe is probaly the film ' s greatest acheivment
. music
( composed by john carpenter hismelf
) is at times effective
, the speical effects
and makeup are likewise worth a notice
. when it comes to the casted
( in an intellectual film liek this casting isnt the last problem
; everyone can scream
annd swing the axe
!
)
,
bu here james woods is suprisingly convincing
. he is macho
and kool as tjhe dedicated hunter
, who lost his family to the
" breed of evil
"
. woods is constanly overacting
, which really saves the film ffrom falling into the trap of serious self importance
. daniel baldwin is also intertaining as crow ' s loyal partner
. hte other cast members are struggling
. because the film doesn ' t tkae itself too seriously
, it stays afloat
. still it is like most vampire
- films
- a medioker experience
.
