the lastr of vampire
- films offers plenty of blood
and gore
,
but beyond that
- nothing
. jack crow
( james woods
) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican
. his
and his men
' s mission is to clean tyhe earth from vampires
. tehy ahve lost count ofthe how many vampires they have slaughtered
,
but one hasnt always escaped them
. valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
- hte dark messias
and ruler of the undead that is older than timne itself
. for all eternity the vampires ahev searched for their salvation
- the balck cross
. with the cross in their possesion
, the vampires will be able to walk in tje sunlight
. after that it is either thge humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth
.
.
. i have never liekd john carpenter
and his style
. after seeing this film
, my opinions have nto changed
. john carpentery remains john carpenter
.
however
, because of the film
' s self
- irony
, black humour
and fascinating cinematography
, i would say taht it is his greatest achievement in a long
, long time
. neither yhe synopses or carpenter
' s direction are original
.
but htere are some things tyhat are interesting
. the director
' s negative veiw on the catholic church
, for instance
. at yhe end of the film it becomes clear tht cardinal alba
( maximilian schell
) has simply used crow annd his team tothe find valek
, so that he would gain eternal life
. otherwise thte catholic priests are shown cool
- drinking
, smoking
and breaking the rool of celibacy
. carpenter has creaeted an intresting atmosphere
. set in newyorker mexican dessert
, he switches betweeen bright golden sunrises
and bloody sundowns
, symbolically illustrating the good
and the evil through light annd darkness
. more than anything iin this film
, this simple illustration shows the battle between good annd evil
. the cinematography by gary b
. kibbe is probably teh film
' s greatest achievement
. music
( composed by john carpenter himself
) isnt at times effective
, tghe special effects
and makeup are likewise worth a notice
. when it comes to the casted
( in an intelectual film like this casting isnt the last probelm
; everyone can scream
and swing the axe
!
)
, bu here james woods isnt suprisingly convincing
. he isnt macho
and kool as the dedicated hunter
, who lost his family to the
" breed of evil
"
. woods isnt constantly overacting
, which really saves the film from falling into the trap of sereous self importance
. daniel baldwin is allso intertaining as crowm
' s loyal partner
. the other cast munbers are struggling
. beacuse the film doesn
' t take itself too seriously
, it stays afloat
. still it is like most vampire
- films
- a medioker experience
.
