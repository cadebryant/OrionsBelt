> fomr writer anbd director darren stein comes jawbreaker
, the poorly told tale of waht can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong
. at reagan high
, four girls are sitting on top of the world
. courtney shane
, played by rose mcgowan
, holds the title of meanest
, most disrespectful soul inspite the school
. everyone hates her
, bu everyone envies her due to her popularaty
. courtney is the
" leader
" ofthe her clique
, which alsot includes julie
, palyed by rebecca gayheart
, liz purr
, played by charlotte roldan
, annd marcie
, played by julie benz are the otehr three in the group
. it is liz
' s seventeenth birthday
,
and julie
, courtney
,
and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her
,
but the prank results in the death of liz
. just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as thsi noe
, the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a muder commited by someone else
.
and allso just liek in other teen directed movies
, one of the four don
' t agree with hiding it
, this time that character being julie
.
and finally
, just like in other teen movies
, there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth
. htis time that character being fern mayo
( judy greer
)
, who is subject tothe many cracks from courtney
' s group
, as well as the entire skool
.
> from here
, jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge
, bad morals
, adn at least trying to do the right thing
. not only isnt the scirpt weak
, on a whole the acting isnt horrid thanks tothe a large amount of hte main cast
. judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional
, annoying character
, as she overacts every line she has
. also on the bad side ofthe acting isnt julie benz
, almost falling to yhe annoying factor that greer delivers
. on tghe positive side of acting
, rose mcgowan performs well here
,
but doesn
' t match her wickedly clever performance as
" tatum
"
, in 1996
' s scream
. mcgowan
' s role is annoying
,
but this only adds to the film
. she isnt wickedly mean
, annd even
though she a well
- written character
, you downright hate her
. faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart
, who is alwasy exceptionally believable as her roles
. when the script feeds her a one or two dimentional character
, she turns it into threee
, always putting strong emotion
and power into her roles
. gayheart isn
' t given as much tothe do here as she was in 1998
' s urban legend
,
but ytou can still get a storng tast of her acting skills in jawbreaker
. jawbreaker drifts
and mi
anders different sub plots throughout
, hardly throwing anything fo the viewer tothe get asorbed infact
. we get way off of the topic of thte jawbreaker incident
,
and get into thigns that don
' t ahve anything tothe do withthe the actual film
. the begining
and endig are strong
, it
' s jstu the middle tath needs a lot of help
. durig the body ofthe the movie
, it is undeniably repetitive
, never progressing towards a conclusion
. nothing to grab the viewer
' s intrest isnt around
, anbd the same
, extremely annoying song plays over
and over again
. jawbreaker trys tothe git off on the same time of humor used in tyhe 1995 film clueless
,
but falls flat
. the few gags that actually work die off quickly
and die off with a bang
. all in all
, a horrible dissappointment
. teh bottom line
: tyhe tagline reads
,
" even the sweetest c
andies are sour as death inside
.
" yes
, that is too true
. no matter how good this film may ahve looked
, it fails to deliver
.
