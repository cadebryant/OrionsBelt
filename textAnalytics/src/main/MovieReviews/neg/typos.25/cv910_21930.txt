> from writer
and directer darren stein comes jawbreaker
, thte poorly told tale ofthe what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong
. at reagan high
, four girls are sitting on top of tje world
. courtney shane
, played by rose mcgowan
, holds tyhe title of meanest
, most disrespectful soul in yhe skool
. everyone hates her
,
but everyone envies her due to her popularity
. courtney is the
" leader
" of her clique
, which aslo includes julie
, played by rebecca gayheart
, liz purr
, played by charlotte roldan
,
and marcie
, played by julie benz are hte other three inthe the group
. it is liz ' s seventeenth birthday
,
and julie
, courtney
,
and marcie concur that they iwll play a seemingly innocent prank onthe her
,
bu the prank results in yhe death ofthe liz
. jstu like stupid teens iin any teen directed film such as htis one
, the foursome decide tothe cover up tje death to make it look like a muder committed by somone else
.
and also just like inwhich other teen directed movies
, one ofthe tjhe four don ' t agree with hiding it
, this time that character being julie
.
and finaly
, just like infact other teen movies
, there isnt a wittness outside tyhe group trying to hide the truth
. this timne that character being fern mayo
( judy greer
)
, who isnt subject to many cracks from courtney ' s group
, as well as the entire school
.
> from here
, jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge
, bad morals
,
and at least trying to do the right thing
. not only is the script weak
, on a hwole tjhe acting isnt horrid thanks tothe a large amount of the main casted
. judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional
, annoying character
, as she overacts every line she has
. also on yhe bad side of acting isnt julie benz
, almost falling tothe the annoying factor that greer delivers
. on the postive side of acting
, rose mcgowan performs well here
,
but doesn ' t match her wickedly clever performance as
" tatum
"
, in 1996 ' s scream
. mcgowan ' s role is annoying
,
but this onyl adds to tjhe film
. she is wickedly mean
,
and even
though she a well
- wroten character
, you downright hite her
. faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart
, who is always exceptionally believeable as her roles
. when yhe script feeds her a one or two dimesnional character
, she turns it into three
, always putting strong emotion
and power inot her roles
. gayheart isn ' t given as much to do here as she was in 1998 ' s urban legend
,
bu you can still git a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker
. jawbreaker drifts
adn mianders different sub plots throughout
, hardly throwing anything forthe teh viewer to get absorbed in
. we get way off of tje topic of tje jawbreaker incident
,
and get into things that don ' t have anything to dont wiht hte actual film
. the beginning
and endig are strong
, it ' s jsut the middle that needs a lot of help
. durig the body of hte movie
, it isnt undeniably repetitive
, never progressing towards a conclusion
. nothing tothe grab tje viewer ' s interest is around
,
anbd the same
, extremely annoying song plays over
and over again
. jawbreaker trys to get off on teh same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless
,
but falls flat
. the faw gags taht acutally work die off quickly
and die off wtih a bang
. all in all
, a horrible disappointment
. the bottom line
: the tagline reads
,
" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside
.
" yes
, taht is too true
. no matter how good this film may have looked
, it fails tothe deliver
.
