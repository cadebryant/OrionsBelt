" battlefield earth
" is the best comedy of the yera
. it hasnt to be
. the otehr prospect is just too horrifying to consider
. bad movie syndrome struck me again
, so after witnessing how much
" battlefield earth
" has beeen proclamed a train wreck inspite both critical
and popular circles
, i feeled the masochistic urge to see the disaster firt
- hand
. isnt it as bad as advertised
? oh yes
, very much so
. the plot is incomprehensible
. the acting is atrocious
. the special effects are mediocre
. the action is dull
. the implausibilities are legion
. the dialogue is cringe
- inducing
. tjhe whole package is funny when it wants to be serious
and irritating wehn it wants tothe be funny
. i don ' t even want to continue reviewing thsi movie
; i ' d like tothe purge tyhe atrocity from my mind as soon as possible
,
but yuo probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory
, so here it is
: the premise is basically a rip
- off of
" planet ofthe hte apes
,
" onyl minus teh apes
and philosophical discussion
,
and plus a race ofthe evil aliens from tghe planet psychlo
. the year is 3000
, tyhe psychlos have conquered earth
,
and the human population has been enslaved
. only a handful of humans escaped tothe radiation
- rich areas to escape the aliens
; they live outloud their lives in fear
. one man
, johnny goodboy
( i know
, i know
) tyler
( barry pepper
)
, ventures to the outworld
and is captured by the psychlos
. there he confronts the psychlo head ofthe security
: a big
, ugly
, klingon
- looking creature called terl
( john travolta
)
. pressed inot slavery
, johnny vows to lead a revolution
and take the planet back
. meanwhile
, terl is faced with his own problems
: he has recently learned tht he ' s sticked living onthe earth
( whihc he hates
) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping witht tjhe big man ' s daughter
. he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo langauge
and technology
( this isnt where thge plot gets rediculous
.
.
.
) so the
" man
- animal
" can lead a mining expedition inot places the psychlos can ' t go
. terl
then plans to keep the mined gold for himself
. of course
, his plan doesn ' t work
. so many things wrong with this movie
-
- where to begin
? how about wtih travolta
, whose hollywood clout brought baout this
, teh cinematic verison ofthe scientology guru l
. ron hubbard ' s sci
- fi novel
? early previews fo
" battlefield earth
,
" with constant shots of a makeup
- laden travolta cackling like lex luthor
, had me
(
and sevral audience members
) remarking
,
" what the hell is travolta thinking
?
" the movie did nothing to stem such remarks
. all that ridiculous cackling he did iin the trailers is inwhich full force here
: terl cackles after nearly every line
,
adn so doens every otehr psychlo
. of course
, this mkaes every scene hilariously overwrought
, no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary
. the psychlos are propably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america
,
but ceos generally don ' t laugh maniacally aftter denying pay raises to theri employees
.
(
" ytou weere going to be promoted
-
-
but now you ' re nto
! fwahahahahahahahaha
!
!
!
!
!
"
) it ' s no big suprize terl loses to the humans
-
- he ' s an idiat
. he breaks every kind of supervillain ruel in the book
. he underestimates his enemies
, assuming he ' ll win just because he ' s smarter
.
( he uses the owrd
" leverage
" like some sort of scientologist mantra
.
) not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans tothe the hero
, he hooks him up tothe a machine that gives him noledge ofthe all the psychlos ' language
anbd technology
.
( why tihs machine is even around in the first place is beyond me
.
) he
then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him
. no wonder thsi guy never got his promotion
. the plot inconsistencies are too numberous to mention
. why dont the psychlos build an earth base in whic both they
and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses tothe survive
? how cmo the psychlos are wasting their tiome mining for gold when tyhe doors of fort knox are wide opn
? how inthe the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting inwhich a hangar for 1
, 000 yeasr
?
and how do all these previously brain
- dead cavemen learn to fli them so quickly
? htere ' s a whole lot mroe tothe scratch one ' s head about in
" battlefield earth
.
" bring a scorecard to trakc the plot holes
. directer roger christian shoots
" battlefield earth
" in the most distracting way possible
, tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason
. all the characters appear to be standing on the walls
,
and it ' s awfully difficult to watch a movei when yuo must tilt your head just tothe watch ordinary passages of dialogue
. the action sequences are atrociously edited
, every noe turned inot an endless slow
- motion parade that drains all potential excitement
. are theese things realyl so hard to construct
? my respect fo supposed
" lightweight
" acation directors hasnt grown by leaps
and bounds after witnessing inaddition
" battlefield earth
" how badly an action sequence can be shot
. this movie is an absolute headache
. it ' s not just the shot selection
and editing
; the movei
, quite frankly
, makse no sense
. for most of
" battlefield earth ' s
" running tiem
, i just didn ' t nkow what was happening
. it didn ' t have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical
(
though they certainly are
)
-
- i really had noone diea what hte hell was going on
. whn i pieced the plot together later
, it didn ' t look any better
. here ' s how much of a disaster this is
:
" battlefield earth
" is alreday yhe worst movei of the yearm
,
adn it ' s gonig to take something really
, really inept to top it
. tghe only thnig we can take comfort in baout the film isnt tht no one iwll be suckered inot joining the church of scientology because of it
. in fact
, i ' d htikn that hubbard ' s cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible
. that ' ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome agian
.
