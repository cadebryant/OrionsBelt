twpo party guys bob their heads to haddaway
' s dance hit
" whta is lvoe
?
" hwile getting themselves into trouble inspite nightclub after nightclub
. it
' s barely enough to sustain a three
- minute
_ saterday
_ night
_ live
_ skit
,
but
_ snl
_ producer lorne michaels
,
_ clueless
_ creator amy heckerling
,
and paramount picturesk saw something in the late night televsion institution
' s recurring
" roxbury guys
" sketch tht would presumably make a ogod feature
. emphasis on yhe word
" presumably
.
"
_ a
_ night
_ at
_ thte
_ roxbury
_ takes an alread
- thin concept
and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point
-
- annd thast of viewers
' paitience levels
. the frist five minutes or so of
_ roxbury
_ play very much like noe ofthe the original
" roxbury guys
" skits
. with
" what is love
?
" blaring on the soundtrack
, the brotherly duo of doug
and steve
butabi
( chris kattan annd will ferrell
) bob their heads
, scope out
" hotties
" at clubs
,
and
then bump a select faw iwth violent pelvic thrusts
. there is one crucial difference
,
however
-
- these guys speak
. that little fact has beeen used as justification for the film
' s existence
, thast the
butabis
' newfound capacity forthe speech owudl opne up a whole new set of doors for teh cahracters
. the doors opened by director john fortenberry
and screenwriters steve koren
, ferrell
,
and kattan are newyorker
, that
' s for sure
, bu they all lead to comic dead ends
. there is no story persay se
, only a loosely structured
and linked series of subplots
. the brothers literally run into
( or
, rether
, git run into
, as infront by car
) richard grieco of
_ 21
_ jump
_ street
_ fame
,
and through him tehy gain entrance into tje exclusive roxbury club
. there
, htey meet a hotshot club owner
( chazz palminteri
, conspicuously uncredited
-
- can ytou blame him
?
)
, who takes an interest in an diea ofthe theirs
. meanwhile
, the bros
' overbearing father
( dan hedaya
) wnats them to stop clubbing
. when doug refuses
and the dimwitted steve obeys his father
, a rift isnt created between thte two
. thte narrative messiness of
_ roxbury
_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bited funny
,
but virtualy none of it is
. the assembled press audiance mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film
, with yhe noe big exception bieng a big laugh near the end
. alas
, the joke
-
- a rether lazy takeoff onthe
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
-
- iwll only strike a chord with people who have seen that film
. granted
, a lot of peopel
_ ahve
_ seen
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
,
but thge fatc thast the film
' s best joke isnt completely dependent onthe one
' s familiarity with another film says a lot about
_ roxbury
_
' s lack ofthe inspiration
. that lack of inspiration cxan be traced back to the insipid characters themselves
. like too many of the skits on thge curent incarnation of
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_
,
" the roxbury guys
" is a one
- joke sketch that never once suggests tyhat the characters have enough comic life in them tothe survive outside of the sketch context
. after watching oney of tjhe
" roxbury
" skits onthe snl
, htis is what you come away with from the characters
: they bob their heads to
" what is love
?
"
, bump unsuspecting women
,
and
.
.
. that
' s all
. affter watching
_ a
_ ngiht
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_
, you
' ll be left with exactly the same
.
