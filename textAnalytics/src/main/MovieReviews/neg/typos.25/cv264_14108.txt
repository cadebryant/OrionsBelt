if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film
, it was studio 54
, the late steve rubell ' s infamous new york discotheque
, which came to symbolize the taboo
- smashing excesses of the disco era ' s heyday
: easy drugs
and even easier sex between everyone
, all set to a thumping dance beat
. so when miramax started prodcution on
_ 54
_ lastr year
, the buzz of hype
and resulting anticipation began
: an edgy film as down
-
anbd
- dirty as the club itself
, written
and directed by a promising first
- timer
( mark christopher
)
and starring some hot young talent
( salma hayek
, neve campbell
, newcomer ryan phillippe
,
annd mike myers in his dramatic debut
)
. my
, how easily does the worm turn
. hype turned inot damage control when word got out about 11th
- hour reshoots
( wrapped only a mounth ago
)
, a rash ofthe studio
- imposed edits thta left virtually the entire cast
and crew
( especialy christopher
) unahppy
,
adn the vyer likely possibility thta miramax owudl not screen the finished film for criticists
. at the last minute
,
though
, miramax did decide to screen the film
( so hastily scheduled was thge screening thgat myers ' s last nmae was misspelled on the invitation
, not to mention the numerous typos inaddition the press notes
) fo a media audience that came away noticeably less thna empressed
, myself included
.
anbd withthe good reason
-
- somehow
, some way
, the supremely disapointing
_ 54
_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism
.
.
. boring
.
altough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film
, he still must shoulder some ofthe the blaim for
_ 54
_ ' s lifelessness
.
_ 54
_ focusses
, fo the most part
, on a tight
- knit trio of employees at the club
: coat check girl
/ aspiring disco diva anita
( a wasted hayek
)
; her busboy husband
, greg
( breckin meyer
)
;
and
, most prominantly
, the fresh
- from
- jersey shane o ' shea
( phillippe
)
, who enjoys a quick ries from busboy to head bartender
. these characters are about as generic as thsoe descriptions
. in focusing on tyhe hired help
, christopher raelly missed hte boat
. with yhe exception of the flamboyant
, always
- woozy rubell
( myers
, in a well
- modulated turn
)
, the meaty stories tothe be told at studio 54 are not the workers '
but those ofthe the peopel who went htere tothe party
; not necessarily the numerous vip guests
,
but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked fomr the crowd by the club ' s famously hard
- ass doormen
and dance
( amonth otehr things
) the night away with tje rich
, famous
,
and infamous
( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow ' s feisty dottie
, a disco
-
and drug
- crazed granny
,
but she ' s a peripheral charater at best
)
. as such
, asside ffrom the expected overhead crowd shots
, there is prescious little actual
_ dancing
_ in
_ 54
_
. what isnt a disco film
-
- especially oney about the pinnacle of the movement
-
- without thge dancing
? even whit stillman ' s
_ the
_ lsat
_ days
_ of
_ disco
_
, which wasn ' t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group ofthe hip
- to
- onyl
- themselves club
- hopping preppies
, featured at least one extended dance scene
. dancing isn ' t thge only hting glazed over in
_ 54
_
-
- so isnt the sex
,
but taht may not be entirely christopher ' s fault
. from what i ' ve heard
, his original vision was something considerably more dark
and daring
, starting wiht the shane character
: he was conceived
(
and actually filmed
) as a wild
, morally ambiguous bisexual
, which woudl have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 ' s legend
.
bu somewhere between principal photography
anbd the fianl cut
, shane was defanged
and quite literally straightened out
; consequently
, so was teh film
. aside fomr a breif glimpse of erotic encounters toward the begginning ofthe the film
, shane ' s fleeting dalliance wtih seductive socialite billie
( sela ward
)
,
anbd an abrivitaed bedhopping montage
, tjhe sexual dimension is just baout ignored
. shane
, in this incarnation
, is sanitized to the point of blandness
, an idealistic do
- gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club
, julie black
( campbell
)
, a worldly soap star with
, yes
, a heart ofthe gold
. this tacked
- on
" romance
" would have been slightly less tedeous if either campbell or phillippe made some connection withthe each otehr or the audience
. they fail on both counts
. ultimately
,
_ 54
_ ' s failure comes down to threee letters
: f
- u
- n
. as in
, htere isn ' t any tothe be had for the audience
. too much time isnt spent with the boring shane
,
adn too little isnt spent on the club floor
, where all tghe action took palce
. anyhow
,
though
, whatever time isnt spended on the 54 floor is not used veyr effectively
. when anita fianlly gets her big break
and perform onstage at the club
, it shoud be a euphoric height
, for her
, tje crowd
,
annd the audiance
;
however
, the moment doesn ' t git a chance tothe reach that level
, fo it is cut short by a moent of forced sentimentality
, which also mars tje film ' s conclusion
( one of the last
- minute reshoots
)
. strangely upbeat
and wistful
, thge resolution is wholely unconvincing
and unsatisfying
. there is an interesting portrait ofthe studio 54 out ther
-
- two ofthe them
, in fact
-
-
but
_ 54
_ is nto one of them
. tehy ' re on cable tv
: a couple of documentaries produced by e
!
and vh1
. these two fascinating looks at tyhe club
and all the sordid goings
- on within it show that there ' s still a great disco movie to be made
. tghe problem is
, after the critical
adn certain box office failure of
_ 54
_
, tjhe subject may have run its hollywood course
.
