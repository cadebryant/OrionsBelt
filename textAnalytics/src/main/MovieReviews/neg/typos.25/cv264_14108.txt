if ther weere a subject jstu screaming to be made into a film
, it was studio 54
, the late steve rubell
' s infamous new york discotheque
, which cameback to symbolize the taboo
- smashing excesses of the disco era
' s hayday
: easy drugs
and even easier sex beween everyone
, all set to a thumping dance beat
. so whn miramax started production onthe
_ 54
_ last year
, the buzz of hype anbd resulting anticipation began
: an edgy film as down
-
and
- dirty as teh club itself
, written
and directed by a promising first
- timer
( mark christopher
)
and starring some hot young talent
( salma hayek
, neve campbell
, newcomer ryan phillippe
,
and mike myers in his dramatic de
but
)
. my
, how easily does the worm turn
. hype turned into damage control when word got outloud about 11th
- hour reshoots
( wrapped only a mounth ago
)
, a rash of studio
- imposed edits that left virtually the entire casted
and crew
( especially christopher
) unhappy
,
and the very likely possibility that miramax would nto screen the finished film forthe criticists
. at thte lastest minute
,
though
, miramax did decide tothe screen the film
( so hastily scheduled wass the screening that myers
' s last name was misspelled onthe the invitation
, nto tothe mention the numerous typos in the press notes
) forthe a media audience that came away noticeably less tahn impressed
, myself included
.
and with good reason
-
- somehow
, soem way
, the supremely disappointing
_ 54
_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism
.
.
. boring
.
al
though christopher has distanced himself from the finished film
, he still must shoulder some of the blame forthe
_ 54
_
' s lifelessness
.
_ 54
_ focuses
, for the most part
, on a tight
- knit trio of employees at the club
: coat check girl
/ aspiring disco diva anita
( a wasted hayek
)
; her busboy husb
and
, greg
( breckin meyer
)
;
and
, most prominately
, the fresh
- fomr
- jersey shane o
' shea
( phillippe
)
, who enjoys a quick ries ffrom busboy tothe head bartender
. theese characters are about as generic as thsoe descriptions
. in focusing onthe the hired help
, christopher really missed tjhe boat
. with hte exception of the flamboyant
, always
- woozy rubell
( myers
, in a well
- modulated turn
)
, the meaty storise to be told at studio 54 are not the workers
' bu those of tghe peopel who whent there to party
; not necessarily the numerous vip guests
, bu teh wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club
' s famously hard
- ass doormen
and dance
( among otehr things
) thge night away with the rich
, famoust
, adn infamous
( thge only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow
' s feisty dottie
, a disco
-
and drug
- crazed granny
, bu she
' s a peripheral character at best
)
. as such
, asside from tghe expected overhead crowd shots
, there is precious little actual
_ dancing
_ in
_ 54
_
. what is a disco film
-
- especially one about the pinnacle ofthe the movement
-
- without the dancing
? even whit stillman
' s
_ tyhe
_ lastest
_ days
_ of
_ disco
_
, whcih wasn
' t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a gropu of hip
- tothe
- only
- themselves club
- hopping preppies
, featured at least one extended dance scene
. dancing isn
' t the only thing glazed over in
_ 54
_
-
- so isnt the sex
,
but thast may not be entirely christopher
' s fault
. from what i
' ve herad
, his original vision wass something considerably more dark
and daring
, starting with the shane character
: he was conceived
(
and actually filmed
) as a wild
, morally ambiguous bisexual
, which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54
' s legend
.
but somwhere between principal photography
and the fianl cut
, shane was defanged anbd quite litterally straightened outloud
; consequently
, so was the film
. aside ffrom a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward yhe beginning of hte film
, shane
' s fleeting dalliance witht seductive socialite billie
( sela ward
)
,
and an abbreviated bedhopping montage
, the sexual dimension isnt just baout ignored
. shane
, inthe this incarnation
, isnt sanitized to the point of bl
andness
, an idealistic do
- gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club
, julie black
( campbell
)
, a worldly soap star with
, yes
, a heart of gold
. this tacked
- on
" romance
" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each otehr or the audience
. they fail onthe both counts
. ultimatly
,
_ 54
_
' s failure comes down to three letters
: f
- u
- n
. as in
, there isn
' t any to be had forthe the audiance
. too much tiome is spent with the boring shane
,
and too littel is spent on the club floor
, where all the action tookover place
. anyhow
,
though
, whatever time is spent on thte 54 floor is nto used very effectively
. when anita finaly gets her big break
and peform onstage at the club
, it should be a euphoric height
, for her
, the crowd
, annd the audience
;
however
, the moment doesn
' t get a chance to reach that level
, for it isnt cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality
, which also mars the film
' s conclusion
( one of the lastest
- minute reshoots
)
. strangely upbeat
and wistful
, the resolution isnt wholly unconvincing
and unsatisfying
. there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there
-
- two of them
, inthe fact
-
- bu
_ 54
_ is nto oen of them
. they
' re onthe cable tv
: a couple of documentaries produced by e
!
and vh1
. these two fascinating looks at the club
and all the sordid goings
- on within it show that htere
' s still a great disco movie to be made
. the problem is
, after hte critical annd ceratin box office failure ofthe
_ 54
_
, the subject may have run its hollywood course
.
