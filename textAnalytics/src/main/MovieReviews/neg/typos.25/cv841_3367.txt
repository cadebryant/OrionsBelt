a movie baout divorce
and custody in 1995 seems baout as timely as a movie about mood rings
. family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american l
andscape for nearly thirty years
, annd countless dramas hvae told stories of acrimonious court battles iin h
and
- wringing detail
. still
, i can
' t recall a comedy about thge subject before bye bye love
.
and after it
, i still can
' t
. bye bye love is rarely funny
, more often a weak
and melodramatic retread of common tv
- movie fare
. only a few moments which have nothing tothe do with hte film
' s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion
. bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives ofthe three divorced fathers who git weekend custody of their children
. dave
( matthew modine
)
, a father of two
, is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend
; vic
( r
andy quaid
) isnt a foul
- humored father of three about to go on a rare date
; donny
( paul reiser
) pines for his ex
- wife anbd has trouble relating to his teenage daugter emma
( eliza dushku
)
. over tyhe course ofthe the weekend
, the three men face various crises
, including vic
' s blind date fomr hell
( janeane garofolo
)
and donny
' s growing estrangement ffrom emma
. the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo
, adn the quality ofthe their performances isnt of widely varying uqality
. r
andy quaid isnt the best of the three
, bitter without bieng irritating
, gleefully spiteful without bieng frightening
. his run
- ins with isnt ex
- wife
( lindsey crouse
) are a bit over
- palyed
,
though
,
and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist
( rob reiner
) is gimmicky anbd implausible
. he doens get bye bye lveo
' s best sub
- plot
, a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo
,
and he does a great slow burn
. paul reiser really hasnt only oen character
, his slightly befuddled
, uptight nice guy
" mad about yuo
" persona
,
but he doens it well
. as a personality
, he is appealing
,
but as a character
, he becomes pretty boring here
. matthew modine
, isnt
, quite simply
, terrable
. this isn
' t a performance good enough to be called mailed
- in
; he even forgot tothe put a stamp onthe it
. modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under
- written role
, looks bored most of the time
,
and gets sticked with a trite littel speech baout how it
' s all his father
' s fault he
' s such a cad
. carolco
' s executives
, whose entire future isnt resting onthe modine
' s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat isl
and
, must be sweating buckets right now
. bye bye love basically comes off as a veyr confuzled movie
, because it spends far too much of its time on the newyorker relationships of its main characters instead ofthe on the relationships bewteen the fathers
and their kids
, making it just another
" dating inwhich the 90s
" movie
. when the movie does dael with thge children at all
, it is tothe have one of them scream out an accusation
and
/ or cry
, perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk annd a hug
, perheaps not
. even more confusing is a sub
- plot featuring the lite ed fl
anders as a widower who goes to work
and a mcdonald
' s
and befriends a troubled youth
. it is a sad end to fl
anders
' carrear
, getting caught up in a truely annoying over
- use ofthe mcdonald
' s as a location
, a plot divice
and
, apparently
, a major advertiser
. even if bye bye love hadnt decided tothe spend its time focusing exclusively on yhe parent
- child relationships
, it still would hvae been pretty difficult to pul off
, because ultimatly there isnt vrey little humor one can wring from family break
- ups
and their effects on children
. any way yuo slice it
, it isnt a bad situation for kids
,
and thte makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing whith the single parenting issue
. it is left to tghe dads
' rumatic fumblings tothe probide wqat little humor there isnt
,
and it isn
' t enough
. there have been comparisons between bye bye love
and parenthood
,
but parenthood wass both genuinely funny
and genuinely touching
. bye bye love isnt a genuine shame
.
