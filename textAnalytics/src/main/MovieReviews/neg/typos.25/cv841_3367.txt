a movie about divorce
and custody iin 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings
. family breakups have been an all too familar part ofthe the american landscape forthe nearly thirty years
,
and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand
- wringing detail
. still
, i can ' t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love
.
adn after it
, i still can ' t
. bye bye loev is rarely funny
, mroe often a weak
and melodramatic retread of common tv
- movie fare
. only a few moments whcih hve nothing tothe do with the film ' s main premise offer big laughs instade ofthe cliched emotion
. bye bye love follows oen weekend inspite the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children
. dave
( matthew modine
)
, a father of twpo
, isnt an inveterate womanizer haveing difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend
; vic
( randy quaid
) is a foul
- humored father of threee about to go onthe a rare date
; donny
( paul reiser
) pines for his ex
- wife
and has trouble relating to his teenage daugher emma
( eliza dushku
)
. over the course of the weekend
, teh three men face various crises
, includng vic ' s blind date from hell
( janeane garofolo
)
and donny ' s growing estrangement ffrom emma
. the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo
,
anbd the qulaity ofthe their performances is of widely varying qualiy
. randy quaid is the best of the three
, bitter wihtout bieng irritating
, gleefully spiteful without bieng frightening
. his run
- ins wtih is ex
- wief
( lindsey crouse
) are a bit over
- palyed
,
though
,
and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist
( rob reiner
) is gimmicky
and implausible
. he does get bye bye lvoe ' s best sub
- plot
, a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo
,
and he does a grat slow burn
. paul reiser really has onyl one character
, his slightly befuddled
, uptight nice guy
" mad about you
" persona
,
but he does it well
. as a perosnality
, he is appealing
,
bu as a character
, he becomes pretty boring here
. matthew modine
, is
, quite simply
, terrible
. this isn ' t a performance good enough to be called mailed
- in
; he even forgot tothe put a stamp on it
. modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under
- written role
, looks bored most of the time
,
annd gets stuck with a trite littel speech about how it ' s all his father ' s fault he ' s such a cad
. carolco ' s executives
, whose entire future is resting onthe modine ' s bankability fo the upcoming cutthroat island
, must be sweating buckets right now
. bye bye love basically comes off as a very confuzled movie
, because it spends far too much ofthe its time on the new relationships ofthe its main characters instade ofthe on the relationships beetwen the fathers
and their kids
, mkaing it just another
" dating in the 90s
" movie
. when thte movie does deal with the childern at all
, it is tothe ahev one of them scream out an accusation
annd
/ or cry
, perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk
anbd a hug
, perhaps not
. even more confusing is a sub
- plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work
and a mcdonald ' s
annd befriends a troubled youth
. it isnt a sad end to flanders ' career
, getting caught up in a truly annoying over
- use of mcdonald ' s as a location
, a plot device
and
, apparently
, a major advertiser
. even if bye bye love hadnt decided tothe spend its time focusing exclusively onthe the parent
- child relationships
, it still would have been pretty difficult to pul off
, because ultimately there isnt very little humor one can wring from family break
- ups
and their effects on childen
. any way ytou slice it
, it is a bad situation for kids
,
and the makers of bye bye love mostly go forthe the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue
. it is left to the dads ' romantic fumblings to probide waht little humor there is
,
and it isn ' t enough
. there have beeen comparisions between bye bye love
and parenthood
,
but parenthood was both genuinely funny
and genuinely touching
. bye bye love is a genuine shame
.
