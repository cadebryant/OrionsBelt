well lets see
.
.
. i
' m not quite sure how to review this film
, based on its laughter factor
. well yeah i cxan
, it
' s not funny
. ok so i laughed one time hwihc warranted the 1
/ 2 star
,
but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when htis pos would be over
,
( whlch at a running tyme ofthe 107 mintues seemed like forever
!
)
. inspite fact
, this could be the un
- funniest movie i
' ve seen in a long tyme
, if nto the un
- funniest
. let me be tjhe firt to say
" ready to rumble
" is a huge dissappointment
. long time wrestling lovers
( david
and scott
) dream ofthe making it to the wcw
, anbd watching jimmy king wrestle
. that isnt their hero of course
, whom is kicked outloud of the wcw
. well here is where the plot thickens
( lol
)
: the twpo wish tothe rescue the king
,
and put him back inot the wcw
but not thgat easily
, because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them
, hwile david
' s father wants him to become a police officer
,
and scott is a loser who hasnt tothe with the help of david clean out johnny on hte spots
. what a plot eh
?
" ready tothe rumble
" is one ofthe those films that tries tothe be funny
,
but sadly fails miserably
, everthing infact the film is imcomprehinsable
,
and even the trailer wasn
' t funny
. the actors are dull
, the scirpt awful
,
and the plot whlch there isn
' t much of
.
.
.
. really annoying
. i
' m not qutie sure how grat actors like these
,
and very funny actors too
, are given such a lame script
,
and directed in such a childish manner
, taht i wonder if hollywood isnt ever gonna make good films these days
. this review isn
' t gonig to be very long because ofthe the fatc tath there isn
' t much going forthe the film
, if anytying at all
. only noe big laugh is in tyhe film
, which isn
' t all that hilarious
. i sat in my chair wondering with this 107
(
!
!
!
!
!
) minute
" comedy
" was going to be over
,
and sadly it went on forever
. i
' m nto sure if anytying could ahev saved this film from being such a total waste
, bu believe me you
, it is
