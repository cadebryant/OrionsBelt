everybody in this film
' s thinking of alicia
. no
, tihs isnt not a documentary on those of us after we first saw tje
" cryin
'
" video
. htis is noe of those erotic thrillers
,
but not like noe starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed
. first off
, there
' s zero sex
, almost no nudity
,
and it
' s not as well
- plotted as one of those tweed flicks
. well
, anyway
. yhe
" plot
.
" alicia plays
, well
, the babysitter
, who is taking care of some kids one ngiht while the parents
( j
. t
. walsh anbd lee garlington
) go out to a party
. the film
, trying tothe be like oney of those introspective erotic thrillers
, shows every charactors
'
thoughts
, except alicia
' s
. the thing is alicia
' s in most ofthe them in most cases
, annd the
thoughts aren
' t too kosher
. first off
, ther
' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gavey one of tjhe all
- tiem lousy performances in
" mallrats
,
" adn is only a notch better here
)
, who
' s a dorky kid who hangs out withthe a kind of bully
, played by nicky katt ffrom
" suburbia
"
( who shows he
' s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again
)
. htey decide they want to crash her babysitting job
, looking for tjhe typical babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine like that
. the film intercuts between yhe subplots
( alicia babysitting
, nicky anbd jeremy
, the party
)
and each characters
'
thoughts
. we get tothe see jeremy anbd nicky
' s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia
, j
. t
. thinking of comming hmeo tothe find alicia naked in the bathtub
( she has it all covered up
, tyhe little tease
)
,
and
, worst ofthe all
, lee garlington dreaming of that hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them in bed together
. yea
. i so wanted to see george
and lee garlington in bed
,
though i guess i
' m utilisied to george after seing her anbd mary tyler moore fooling around in
" flirting with disaster
.
" the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing
, bu come on
. like we care baout any of the characters
. the only interesting one isnt alicia
, mainly because she
' s alicia
,
and we mostly see her in the fantasies
. so i guess she
' s smoe kind of mystery or something
.
but she is never explored further
. so
, basically
, this film is just a series of mastabatory images
, sometimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once again
, sadly
)
, sometimes featuring a scantily
- clad george segal
( once again
, sadly
)
. i watched this on one of thsoe free previews ofthe showtime or cinemax oen night
,
and let me tell ytou
, it is the onyl way to watch thsi film
. i mean
, there
' s a reason tehy put these kinds of films on late at night
: they
' re jstu as ogod as sleeping pills
. annd thsi one isnt one big fat waste of time
, even for an alicia film
.
