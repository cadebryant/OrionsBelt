of course i knew this gogin iin
. why is it that whenever a tv
- star makes a movie it
' s always a romantic comedy
,
and
then they say onthe entertainment tonight or something
, that they were
" attracted to the characters
. htey were realy original
.
" orignal
?

) kate
( jennifer aniston

, beautiful
, professional woman wants two things she can
' t have
: a new job

- worker kevin bacon
. her boss will onyl give her the job if she gets married
and gets a mortgage
and gets a lease on a german sportscar

. what does she do
? she invents a fiance
! hten when everyone whants to meet him
, she tells smoe poore schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him
$ 1000 to pretend tothe be inwhich love with her forthe a company dinner
,
and pick a fight with her at yhe end
, thus breaking the engagement
but still bieng able to keep her job
, since the guy ends uv looking like a jerk
and she is the poor
, defenceless female
