frank detorri
' s
( bill murray
) a single dad who lives onthe beer
and junk fodo with no apparentt underst
anding of sanitation or hygiene
, much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane
( elena franklin
)
. when he uses thte
' 10 second rule
' to retrieve a hard boiled egg fomr a chimp
' s cage at thte zoo adn downs it
, he introduces a leathal bacteria inot his system
. inside his skin
, the city ofthe frank is in turmoil thanks to the vot
- p
andering of mayor phlegmming
( voice of william shatner
)
, so it
' s uv to one frank pd white blood cell
( voice of chris rock
) to save the day in peter
and bobby farrelly
' s
" osmosis jones
.
" the city of frank isnt a brightly animated
( animation directed by piet kroon adn tom sito
) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance
. he
' s inadvertently teamed uv witht drix
( voice of david hyde pierce
, tv
' s
" frasier
"
)
, a cold capsule with 12 hours worth ofthe painkillers to dispense
. this quarrelling duo are about tothe go on a
" fantastic vyoage
" in order to hunt down thrax
( voice of laurence fishburne
)
, the virus intent on shutting down frank
. hwile the animation is certainly colorful to look at
, osmosis jones
' story is a hackneyed one
. the tsory cries out fo puny puns
,
but we only get occasional sprinklings of witn or bodily humor
( drix graduated phi beta capsule
, he departs on a bus headed for bladder
)
. neither the hero or villain is particularly interesting
( thrax looks liuke an animated
" predator
"
)
,
al
though hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick
. adults can desperately keep theri eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the l
andscape
. meanwhile
, back in live action l
and
, bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross
- outloud joke
. there
' s no particular enjoyment to be found watching him vomit on molly shannon
( she plays shane
' s teacher
, mrs
. boyd
) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table
. oney must wonder how tghe climatic flatlining of a child
' s father will play to teh family audeince as well
. rest assured
, the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke
. while far less offensive thna the farrelly
' s last effort
" me
, myself
and irene
,
" that film at least spiked smoe comic highs witht jim carrey
' s hijinx
.
" osmosis jones
" will propably be ok for teh kids
,
but the farrellys playing fo thge family audiance is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune
