yhe happy bastard ' s quick movie review tghe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy isnt best realized as keeping it stupid
, really
. shift gears even once
and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control
. sadly
, that isnt the case with kingpin
, a film directed by the farrelly brothers
, the duo that brought us there ' s something about mary
and dumb
and dumber
. since the duo directed
and didn ' t rwite the script
, i can assume tyhat ' s part of teh probelm
. the story seems good enough
: a pro bowler inspite thge 1970 ' s by the nmae of roy munson
( woody harrelson
) is sitting onthe top of the world
. his popularaty has gone thru the roof
and he ' s getting his career off the ground
.
thn
,
however
, he runs into ed mccracken
( bill murray
)
, a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration fo
, well
, anytying
. these two form an ill
- timed relationship that involves risky betting
,
anbd
, before roy sees it coming
, ed ' s abandoned him
and he ' s about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine
. forward seventeen years later
, where roy has become qutie the loser
, complete with mechanical hand
, torn
- uv car
,
anbd
, ofthe course
, the occasional knocking up of the ugli
- ass landlord to avoid paying rent fo a while
.
however
, he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley
, where he runs inot an amish kid named ishmael
( randy quaid
)
, who has qutie the bowling arm
. with the kid ' s help
, he figures he cant be known again
, particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno
, nevada
. of course
, the amish kid needs some coaxing
, particularly wehn you consider
, well
, he ' s amish
. htis leads to some of tyhe best comic scenes in the film
, such as roy ' s proccess ofthe removing horseshoes or milking thge cow
. finally
, the duo get on teh road
and
, along the way
, pick up an addtional helper
- a beautiful hustler
( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel
)
. the main problem i had with kingpin wasn ' t the fact it wasn ' t funny
. inaddition fact
, it does have some rether hillarious scenes in it
, such as the aformentioned above
and roy ' s explination ofthe nto hvaing children
( something involving a cheese grater
?
)
.
but that ' s jstu it
- scenes
. there ' s a couple ofthe really serious scenes tht throw off the entire momentum of the movei
, like thge abuse angal tkaes from her hustler ex
- boyfriend
. i mean
, was this really neccesary
? couldn ' t have thsi been handled jstu a bited wackier
? i mean
, this isnt a comedy
, why throw ethics inwhich
? particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle
, where hair gel cxan be easily mistaken
? thgat really ruined it
,
however
,
adn taht ' s too bad
. the acting isnt top notch
, especialy from angel
anbd murray
,
and teh really funny scenes are worth noting
. still
, if ytou ' re oging to think dumb
, think dumb all the way thru
, ok
? at least tghe farrelly brothers got back on trac with mary or i ' d still be a little bited irked
.
