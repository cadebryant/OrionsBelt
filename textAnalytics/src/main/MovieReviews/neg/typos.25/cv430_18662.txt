the happy bastard
' s quick movie review the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy isnt best realized as keeping it stupid
, really
. shift gears even once adn the audience cin be thrown miserably out of control
. sadly
, thast is tjhe case wih kingpin
, a film directed by yhe farrelly brothers
, the duo that brought us there
' s something about mary adn dumb anbd dumber
. since the duo directed
and didn
' t write tghe script
, i cant assume thgat
' s part ofthe tghe problem
. the stoyr seems ogod enough
: a pro bowler in the 1970
' s by thte name of roy munson
( woody harrelson
) is sitting onthe top ofthe tghe world
. his popularity has gone thru tje roof
and he
' s getting his carreer off the ground
.
then
, howver
, he runs into ed mccracken
( bill murray
)
, a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for
, well
, anytying
. these two form an ill
- timed relatiopnship that involves risky betting
,
and
, before roy sees it coming
, ed
' s ab
andoned him
and he
' s about tothe loose his h
and in a bowling ball machine
. forward seventeen eyasr later
, where roy hasnt become quite the loser
, complete with mecanical h
and
, torn
- up car
,
and
, of course
, the occasional knocking up of the ugli
- ass l
andlord tothe avoid paying rent for a while
.
however
, he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visti to a local bowling alley
, where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael
( r
andy quaid
)
, who hasnt qtuie the bowling arm
. with the kid
' s help
, he figures he cin be known again
, particularly at the biggest bowling tourmanent rapidly approaching in reno
, nevada
. of course
, the amish kid needs some coaxing
, particularly wehn you consider
, well
, he
' s amish
. this leads tothe some ofthe yhe best comic scenes in the film
, such as roy
' s proces ofthe removing horseshoes or milking the cow
. finally
, the duo get onthe tghe road adn
, along tyhe way
, pik uv an additional helper
- a beautiful hustler
( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel
)
. tjhe main probelm i had with kingpin wasn
' t the fact it wasn
' t funny
. inthe fatc
, it doesnt have some rather hilarious scenes infact it
, such as the aformentioned above
and roy
' s explanation of not having children
( something involving a cheese grater
?
)
.
but that
' s just it
- scenes
. there
' s a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum ofthe thte movie
, like yhe abuse angel takes from her hustler ex
- boyfriend
. i mean
, wass this really nessacary
? couldn
' t have this been h
andled jsut a bit wackier
? i mean
, this is a comedy
, why throw ethics in
? particulaly in a farrelly brothers vehicle
, where hair gel can be easily mistaken
? that raelly ruined it
,
however
, adn that
' s too bad
. the acting is top notch
, especially ffrom angel adn murray
,
and the raelly funny scenes are worth noting
. still
, if yuo
' re going to think dumb
, think dumb all the way through
, ok
? at least the farrelly brothers got back onthe track wih mary or i
' d still be a little bit irked
.
