capsule
: not as bad a sequal as crow 2 or batman
& robin
,
but still horribly putrid
, cheesy
and ill
- conceived
. this one belongs inwhich saturday morning cartoons
.
.
. extended review
: you knwo
, about halfway through this movie
, i realized that if yuo hacked outloud everthing exept the fight scenes
, yuo
' d have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy
, hong kong style martial arts
. beautifully choreographed by robin shou
, who also plays liu kang
, the fight scenes are both mind
- blowing
and graceful
, acrobatic enough tothe make olympic gymnasts weep
. this is what made the orignal so fun
,
but unfortunatley for the sequel
, we are without the frenetic directorial stlye of paul
anderson
. instead
, they got john r
. leonetti
, thte cinematographer for thge original mortal kombat
. not a good choice
. while the fight scenes are brutal
and eye
- popping
, tjhe rest of the movei looks liek st
andard made for tv fare
. thge acting is sub
- par
, which i could endure if it weere not for a
.
) the directer
' s style
, b
.
) the special effects
,
& c
.
) the treatment of the stry
and characters
. a
.
) mr
. leonetti shoudln go back to lighting
, in my opinion
. i sould say dozens of bad thnigs about him
: he way overuses slow
- motion
, he has no eye for action
, he can
' t git even medioker performances out ofthe actors
,
and so on
.
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping
. apparantly
, everybody can now fly
. hell
, i
' m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick
and whatnot
,
but not wehn it happens every few minutes
,
and is done so poorly
. better jumping
and acrobatics hasnt been seen inaddition xena
: warrior princess
. in short
, they should hvea gotten paul
anderson back
. or at least let robin shou direct
.
.
. b
.
) unlike the first one
, whose sfx weere vibrant
and somewhat realistic
, mk
: a
' s special effects are bl
and
, fake looking
,
and overall just plain bad
. i counted at least half a dozen times that blue
- screening was painfully obvious
. had htis movie been made in the 80
' s
, it would have been ground
- breaking
. bu in today
' s inudstry
, it doesn
' t even look finished
. c
.
) now for the
_ really
_ bad parts
. i admit
, i
' m an avid fan of the mortal kombat series
. the ganes are amusing diversions
, an easy way to owrk off stress adn anger
. the frist movei was a mindlessly fun thrillride
. this could have been a really cool movei
. it isn
' t
. tje writers apparantly deemed it necessary tothe lower the target audeince ffrom teens tothe preschoolers
. some of the plot elements are just plain stupid
. how stupid
? take
, for instatance
, how our heroes move around
. they use giants spheres the roll around underground
, supposably at thous
ands of miles persay hour
.
.
. oh boy
.
.
. even worse is yhe treatment of secondary characters
. blink
and yuo
' ll miss
' em
. most characters had more depth in tyhe video games
. if you throught batman
& robin was bad about this
, ytou ain
' t seen nothin
' yot
. a good 75
% of teh charactors are introduced
, kick somebody around a bit
,
then either die or are forgotten about
. there
' s no explanation at all for this
.
and for tghe final blasphemy
, the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for
, teh fight hyped to be the most intricate ofthe the movie
, lasted baout 3 minutes
and
then just sort ofthe
.
.
. ended
. it almost made me weep
. to sum it all up
, rent it on video
,
and fast
- forward through everything exept thge fight scenes
.
