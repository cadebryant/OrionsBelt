what are we going to do with jim carrey
? viewers of television
' s
" in living color
" konw this one
- man cartoon ffrom such characters as fire marshall bill
. viewers also nkow that
" in living color
" is a skit
- show
and that a littel ofthe jim carrey goes a long way
. unfortunately
, tihs fact was forgotten by tghe makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura
: pet detective
. three writers
, includng carrey
, worked on hte slapstick story
, which sends a self
- styled
" pet detective
" on the trail ofthe a stolen dolphin
. the missing mamal belongs to the miami dolphins
, who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl
. for plot porpoises
, this story works as well as any three stooges short
. carrey gets to dont his
" official
" schtick as he snoops around greater miami
. he leers
and sneers
, craning his neck to funny effect
. he even doesnt his captain kirk impersonation
. again
. all of thsi is pretty harmless stuff up until the point thta you realize tyhat the writers have absolutely noone intention of focusing on anyone
* other
* than carrey
.
( suggested alternate title
-
- jim carrey
: will do anything for a laugh
.
) export it tothe france adn you may have a hit
. as it st
ands
, ace ventura isn
' t even good kid
' s stuff
. yhe profanity count
, alone
, isnt too high
. which isnt ironic
, usance children are
, probablly
, carrey
' s best audience
. the film doesn
' t even have tje goofball charm of chris elliott
' s receet no
- brainer cabin boy
. sure
, carrey has his moments
.
but what cxan you say about a film whose high
- points inlcude watching carrey slink around to the theme from
" mission impossible
?
" ace ventura has noe glaring incongruity
. amid the
butt
- jokes
and double
- takes
, the script takes great pains to set
- up an elaborate
and rather funny
" crying game
" gag
.
and
, fo
* this
* intended audience
, that tkaes
( ahem
) cojones
.
