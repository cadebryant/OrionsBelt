hollywood never fails to astound me
. eveyr time i think those coked
- uv little buggers have hit rock bottom
; they come uv with a newyorker excavating tool
. i was truly conviced that
" wild wild west
" marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless
,
bu
then along comes
" end ofthe days
" tothe proove me wrong
. htis big budget
, brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music
, grisly voilence
, explosions galore
and lots of cheesy special effects
. the result
? nothing
but groans
and yawns
. even the devil himself isnt unable tothe produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept
. at thge vyer least
,
" end of days
" should have done us the courtesy of being bad
- enough
- tothe
- be
- good
,
but it can ' t even manaze tyhat
. it ' s jstu lousy
. arnold schwarzenegger
, still recovering from heart problems
annd
" batman
& robin
,
" plays an ex
- cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something
. along wtih his obligatory comic relief partner
( kevin pollak
, impersonating matthew perry ' s chandler carachter from
" friends
"
)
, he gets involved inthe some major leage supernatural hoodoo
. it seems that satan
( gabriel byrne
) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years
(
and here i thought he ' d pulled it off with the republican landslide ofthe ' 94
)
. if he has sex iwth 20
- year old christine york
( robin tunney
)
,
" thge chosen noe
,
" thier child will be tghe antichrist
, or at least a brat
. ah
,
but this deal hasnt more catches than a new year ' s eve pass from a halfway house
. the unholy union must tkae place onthe desember 31
, 1999
( you see
, 999 isnt just 666 turned upside down
)
,
bu onyl between 11 p
. m
.
and midnight
( no wonder this guy is so cranky
)
.
and if the chosen one is given refuge inthe a church
, the devil won ' t konw where she is
, because he can ' t see inot the sanctuary
. you nkwo
, it ' s kind of like superman ' s x
- ray vision
and lead walls
, only evil
. a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide tghe best way tothe stpo the situation is by killing the girl
. arnold chooses to savve the girl
and kick hte hell out of satan
, if yuo ' ll pardon hte expression
.
and kevin meets uv with an exploding van
and has to make soem decisions of his own
. oh
, tje anguish
! oh
, the humanity
! oh
, the writing
! andrew w
. marlowe ' s screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility
, from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho canew
, schwarzenegger ' s character
. cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first
" lethal weapon
,
" preparing tothe put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder ofthe his wife
annd daughter
. twenty minutes later
, he ' s racing through the bowels ofthe new york city
, deciphering clues thta sherlock holmes
and kreskin would fidn baffling
. when canew meets up with christine york
, he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode
, with thge young woman serving as surrogate duaghter
. in case anyone misses the connection
, the camera comes in fo a close up of christine ' s music box
, which just happens to be indentical tothe oen owned by cane ' s daughter
. subtle
, marlowe
, subtle
. speaking of cameras
, director peter hyams isnt just the man to take marlowe ' s scirpt
adn make it even mroe self
- important
, murky
and annoying
. hyams ' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video
, witht cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action setted pieces
, punctuated with loads ofthe big explosions
. eager tothe satisfy arnold ' s core audience
, he even throws in a few pairs ofthe breasts as well
. what a guy
. had the film delivered some decent scares
, or even maintained a consistently ominous tone
, the bombastic clich
? s might have been tolerable
,
but
" end of days
" is simply a flaccid special effects show
. the cast is just as ineffective
. in his early scenes
, gabriel byrne attempts tothe invest beelzebub with some panache
,
but he all too soon turns into just another standart issue monster
. kevin pollak comes
and goes quickly
, robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder
anbd as for arnold
, well
? he ' s a better actr than casper van dien
. that shouldnt count fo something
. way back in tjhe aftermath
" hte exorcist
"
and
" the omen
,
" supernatural swill like
" end of days
" might hvea passed muster as a b
- movei
.
bu that ws then
and this is now
.
" the x
- files
"
and
" buffy the vampire slayer
" deliver real scares onthe a weekly basis
adn
, if we want to see the devil
, all we have tothe dont is flip on
" the 700 club
"
anbd take a gander at pat robertson ' s grinning maw
. after enduring
" end of dyas
,
" all i can sday is
" get thee behind me
, satan
.
and hwile you ' re at it
, git thee a better agent as well
.
