hollywood never fails to astound me
. every tyme i think those coked
- up little buggers have hit rock bottom
; they come up with a new excavating tool
. i was truly convinced that
" wild wild west
" marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless
,
but
then along comes
" end of days
" tothe prove me wrong
. thsi big budget
, brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience wih overwrought music
, grisly violentce
, explosions galore
and lots of cheesy special effects
. teh result
? nothing
but groans
and yawns
. even the devil himself isnt unable to produce a decent scare inwhich this festival of the inept
. at the very least
,
" end of days
" should haev done us the courtesy ofthe being bad
- enough
- tothe
- be
- ogod
, bu it can
' t even manaze that
. it
' s just lousy
. arnold schwarzenegger
, still recovering from heart problems
and
" batman
& robin
,
" plays an ex
- cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something
. along with his obligatory comic releaf partner
( kevin pollak
, impersonating matthew perry
' s ch
andler character from
" friends
"
)
, he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo
. it seems that satan
( gabriel byrne
) gets a shot at world domination onyl once eveyr thous
and years
(
and here i thougth he
' d pulled it off with the republcan l
andslide ofthe
' 94
)
. if he has sex with 20
- year old christine york
( robin tunney
)
,
" the choosen oen
,
" their child wiull be tjhe antichrist
, or at least a brat
. ah
,
but this dael has more catches thna a new year
' s eve pass fomr a halfway hous
. the unholy union must take place on december 31
, 1999
( you see
, 999 isnt just 666 turned upside down
)
, bu only bewteen 11 p
. m
.
and midnight
( no wonder this guy is so cranky
)
.
and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church
, the devil won
' t nkow where she is
, because he can
' t see into the sanctuary
. you know
, it
' s kind ofthe like superman
' s x
- ray vision
and lead walls
, only evil
. a gropu of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way tothe stop teh situation is by killing the girl
. arnold chooses to savve hte girl
and kick the hell out ofthe satan
, if ytou
' ll pardon tjhe expression
.
and kevin meets up wih an exploding van
and has to make some decisions of his own
. oh
, the anguish
! oh
, the humanity
! oh
, the writing
!
andrew w
. marlowe
' s screenplay ladles implausibility apon implausibility
, fomr the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his h
andling of jericho cane
, schwarzenegger
' s character
. cane starts yhe film a la mel gibson in the firt
" lethal weapon
,
" preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the muder of his wife
and daughter
. twenty minutes later
, he
' s racing through the bowels ofthe new york city
, deciphering clues that sherlock holmes
and kreskin woudl find baffling
. when cane meets uv with christine york
, he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode
, with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter
. in case anyone misses the connection
, the camera comes in for a close up of christine
' s music box
, which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane
' s daughter
. subtle
, marlowe
, subtle
. speaking of cameras
, director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe
' s script
and make it even omre self
- importan
, murky
and annoying
. hyams
' direction shows all the subtlety ofthe a gwar video
, wih cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action setted pieces
, punctuated witht loads of big explosions
. eager to satisfy arnold
' s core audience
, he even throws infront a few pairs ofthe breasts as well
. what a guy
. had the film delivered some decent scares
, or even maintained a consistently ominous tone
, the bombastic clich
? s might have been tolerable
, bu
" end of dyas
" is simply a flaccid special effects sohw
. the cast isnt jstu as ineffective
. in his eearly scenes
, gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache
,
but he all too soon turns into just another st
andart issue monster
. kevin pollak comes
and goes quickly
, robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder adn as for arnold
, well
? he
' s a better acto than casper van dien
. that shouldnt count for something
. way back in hte aftermath
" tjhe exorcist
"
and
" the omen
,
" supernatural swill like
" end of days
" might have passed muster as a b
- movie
. bu that was
then
and this isnt now
.
" the x
- files
"
and
" buffy the vampire slayer
" deliver real scares on a weekly basis
and
, if we want tothe see tjhe devil
, all we have to do is flip on
" tghe 700 club
" anbd take a g
ander at pat robertson
' s grinning maw
. after enduring
" end of dyas
,
" all i can say is
" get thee behind me
, satan
.
and while ytou
' re at it
, git thee a better agent as well
.
