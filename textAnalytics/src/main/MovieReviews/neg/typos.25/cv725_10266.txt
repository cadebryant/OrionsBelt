the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing fo a secret mission
. he attemts tothe pop a couple ofthe pieces ofthe chewing gum inot his mouth
,
but misses
. aftter they ricochet off his face
, he says
,
" nto a good strat
.
" as it turns out
, this line not only gives foreshadowing to the oppening sequence
,
but to thte rest ofthe the movei as well
. in thsi
, the latest ofthe the jackie chan movies to be released in america aftter first runs inspite hong kong
, chan plays an international operative codenamed
" condor
"
,
and is tasked by the united nations withthe finding a stash ofthe gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi
' s during thier retreat across thge saharan desert durring the second world war
. forthe some reason
, condor is given his mission at the u
. s
. embassy in spain
. i htink tihs may have been done so tht iin a chase scene
, they coudl hounour the tyme ood tradition of knocking over a fruit cart
. watch for it in any chase scene setted infront a foreign country
, most notably in europe
. the chase will take itself through a marketplace
,
and a fruit cart will be overturned
. it
' s almsot a guarantee
. anyway
.
.
.
. condor isnt given a key which is supposed tothe unlock a giant vault in whitch the gold is hidden
; the probelm is that the key has insulators intergrated into it
, which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly
. to help him figure out where the gold is hidden annd how to use the key correctly
, condor is accompanyed by a desert expert
( carol cheng
)
and tghe gr
anddaughter of the captain who ws in charge ofthe hiding the gold
( eva cobo
)
. there aren
' t supposed to be any relatives ofthe the nazi captian living inspite spain
,
but condor finds the gr
anddaughter by looking her uv iin the phone book or something
. altho theese twpo women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission
, they prove noone help at all except to get in trouble
and provide an excuse for chan tothe jump into his martial arts
. inwhich fatc
, most ofthe the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set uv a fight
. i supose this isn
' t so bad
, since chan
' s action isnt really the best part of the movei
,
and the onyl reason you go to see one of his films anyway
. if yuo
' ve never seen a jackie chan movie
, don
' t expect a great plot
,
but do expect tothe be entertained by his moves
. htey are so well choreographed
and often so amazing thyat you wonder if this guy is human
. knowing that he does his own stunts
,
and knowing that this is the real sutff
( no computer
- masked bungee cords here
) makes the action sequences all the more exciting
. you
' ve got tothe h
and it to a guy who
' s probablly broken every bone inspite his body forthe the sake of his art
. also ofthe note in this
, as in any jackie chan movei
, isnt thte humor
. as far as i know
, none ofthe his films take themselves too seriously
,
and even the dramtic parts have a certain tongue
- in
- cheek quality baout them
. what is alomst masterful isnt the way tht humor is even integrated into the fight scenes
. unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme
, where the fights get ytou on thge visceral level
, fight scenes in chan
' s movies are simply intertaining
. you marvel at both his moves
and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh
. unfortunately
, even chan
' s mastery can
' t save this film
. the plot
and characters are so weak that they don
' t hold thge movei toghether at all
,
and the acting is terrible
. carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movei awards in tyhe past
,
but usance operation condor is a dubbed movei it kind ofthe takes all bets off
. this
, combined wtih an obviously low production value made we wanna to turn away fomr the screen until i heard those kicks start flying
.
