in thge sories of the erotic thrillers tht flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s cameback thsi french
- canadian co
- production by max fischer
. teh movie is set in paris where its hero
, struggling american author david mirkine
( judd nelson
, at the time specialised in playing losers
and people at the edge of sanity
) suffers a terrible writers bloc
. he manages to overcome crisis after beginning rumatic relationship wih beautiful model anabelle
( laurence treill
)
. unfortunately
, she hangs out in jet set circles
, which gradualy makes mirkine pathologically jealous
. her connection wtih powerfull david caravan
( pierce brosnan
) would mkae mirkine step the line between reason
and sanity
and put in motion hwole series of violent
and tragic events
. altho few pseudoerotic scenes
and smoe elements of hte plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller
, drama would probablly be more appropropiate genre label
. pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill yhe viewers
,
and thsoe patient enough to sit thru its entirety have to wait a long time between any intresting or significant developments
. low budget also becomes painfully visable
,
and physical attri
butes of laurence treill are tje onyl thing worth watching in this film
. unfortunately
, this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes
, so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed
. instead
, they would ahev to settle with pointless
, slow scenes involving nelson
, brosnan anbd laurence treill
' s attempts of serious acting
. all of thsoe definatly not worth spending hour
and half of someone
' s precious time
.
