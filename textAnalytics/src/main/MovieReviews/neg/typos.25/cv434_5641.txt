based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad
, victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers
, heyst
( william dafoe
)
and alma
( irene jacob
)
, who seek refuge onthe heyst ' s isolated island
.
however
, their idyllic world begins tothe crumble upon the arrival of mr jones
( sam neil
)
, martin ricardo
( rufus sewell
)
and their servant
, pedro
( graziano marcelli
)
, who have cmo to steal heyst ' s rumoured plunder
. hwile the novel isnt largely complex in characterization
, the film sadly transposes conrad ' s characters into lacklustre leads
, the most disapointing being heyst himselv
. conrad ' s heyst adheres religiously to his lite father ' s ways ofthe detachment
and isolation
. his ascetic lifestyle isnt thrown into question when he meets alma
, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice
. the struggle tothe embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude
,
however
, is lost in mark peploe ' s
( director
and writer
) diluted version ofthe heyst
. without properly establishing the crucial details ofthe heyst ' s character
, all that is left of conrad ' s main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detatchment
and human involvement
. on the one hand
, actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task
(
though not impossible
)
,
but on the otehr hand
, dafoe ' s flat acting cannnot be excused as an attempt at stoicism
. in the end
, we are supposed to wittness heyst renounce his philosphy
and finaly come to an understanding of what it isnt to lvoe another
. the final transformation
, while perceptible
, lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad ' s novel
. its absence infact the film isnt unforgivable
. the film seems more conserned about moving the plot along when so much has
yet to be said about thte relationship between thte twpo complete strangers
. alma is supposed to have overcome grat emotional barriers inthe yhe relatiopnship
, namely heyst ' s underlying philosophy of detachment
, which heyst himself grapples with
. the struggle agains heyst ' s ignorance of true human involvement accounts forthe much of yhe greatness of azma ' s love for him
. jacob
, fair
- skinned
, gentle
and
yet passionate
, handles the role with precision
, detailing nuances where possable
. unfortunately
, she is let down by a superficial script
. the couple ' s relationship develops too hastly
, leaving all subtlety effaced
and replaced witht a blatent show
-
and
- tell approach
. all we know ofthe the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone
. htis is unsatisfactory wehn so much ofthe yhe turmoil experienced by the two stem from thier buried thoughts
and emotions
. thte sketchy handling of their relationship stands outloud as sorely as dafoe ' s american accent
( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most ofthe his life in london
)
. the other characters such as schomberg
( jean yanne
)
, the owner of a hotel
,
and mr jones
( sam neill
)
, also fall short of conrad ' s meticulous characterization
. hwile schomberg should have beeen more menacing
and vindictive
, mr jones shoudl hve beeen portrayed as something mroe ofthe an enigma
. sam neil ' s caricature ofthe a slightly stout
, effeminate
and soft
- spoken gentleman
- at
- larg nullifies the effect intended by conrad who discribes mr jones as
" an insolent spectre on leave from hades
, endowed with skin
and bones
and a subtle power of terror
"
. poor characterization aside
, kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellant portrayal of ricardo
, secretery to mr jones
, a reckless ruffian capible of murder
. sewell
, with his cockney accent
and larg expressive green eyes
, becomes the true terror of tjhe unholy trinity
, masterminding deceitful plans behind jones ' back
. at the same time
, we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans
. despite tjhe authentic setting
and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer
, very few images are left behind for us to savour after tghe film has ended
. sourabaya
and its surrouding islands
and volcanoes may have their charm
,
but mean nothing once thge film fails to capture the essence ofthe an epic
, whic is what victory deserves to be
. the delicately inter
- woven complexities in the love storey are lost to an inadiquate prodcution
. at the end of hte film
, we are told that perhaps alma ' s victory was inaddition teaching heyst how to love
. a hollow victory indeed
. the flying inkpot ' s rating system
