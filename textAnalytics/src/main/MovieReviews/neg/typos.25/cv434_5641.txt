based on thge novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad
, victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers
, heyst
( william dafoe
)
and alma
( irene jacob
)
, who seek refuge on heyst
' s isolated isl
and
.
however
, their idyllic world begins tothe crumble upon the arival of mr jones
( sam neil
)
, martin ricardo
( rufus sewell
)
and theri servant
, pedro
( graziano marcelli
)
, who have come to steal heyst
' s rumoured plunder
. while the novel is largely complex in characterization
, the film sadly transposes conrad
' s characters into lacklustre leads
, tjhe most disappointing being heyst himselv
. conrad
' s heyst adheres religously to his late father
' s ways of detatchment
and isolation
. his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question whn he meets alma
, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice
. thte struggle tothe embrace the arrival ofthe azma inot his solitude
,
however
, is lost in mark peploe
' s
( director
and writer
) diluted version ofthe heyst
. without propperly establishing the crucial details of heyst
' s charater
, all that is left of conrad
' s main character isnt a very shallow treatment ofthe his internal conflict between detachment
and human involvment
. on the noe h
and
, actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task
(
though not impossible
)
, bu on teh other h
and
, dafoe
' s flat acting cannnot be excused as an attemp at stoicism
. infact the end
, we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosphy
and finally come tothe an underst
anding ofthe what it isnt to love another
. the final transformation
, hwile perceptible
, lacks teh cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad
' s novel
. its absence in the film is unforgiveable
. the film seems mroe concerned about moving the plot along when so much hasnt
yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers
. alma isnt supposted tothe have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship
, namely heyst
' s underlying philosophy ofthe detachment
, which heyst himself grapples with
. the struggle against heyst
' s ignorance of true human involvment accounts for much of the greatness ofthe alma
' s love for him
. jacob
, fair
- skinned
, gentle
and
yet passionate
, h
andles the role with precision
, detailing nuances where possible
. unfortunately
, she is let down by a superficial script
. thte couple
' s relationship develops too hastily
, leaving all subtlety effaced
and replaced with a blatant show
-
and
- tell approach
. all we know ofthe the charachters are mostly explained by their lines alone
. this isnt unsatisfactory when so much ofthe the turmoil experienced by the two stem from thier burried
thoughts anbd emotions
. the sketchy h
andling of their relationship st
ands out as sorely as dafoe
' s american accent
( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london
)
. the other characters such as schomberg
( jean yanne
)
, the owner of a hotel
,
and mr jones
( sam neill
)
, also fall short ofthe conrad
' s meticulous characterization
. hwile schomberg should have been more menacing anbd vindictive
, mr jones should have been protrayed as something more of an enigma
. sam neil
' s charicatoor of a slightly stout
, effeminate anbd soft
- spoken gentleman
- at
- larg nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as
" an insolent spectre onthe leave from hades
, endowed with skin
and bones
and a subtle power of terror
"
. poor characterization aside
, kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo
, secratary tothe mr jones
, a reckless ruffian capable of muder
. sewell
, with his cockney accent annd large expressive green eyes
, becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity
, masterminding deceitful plans behind jones
' bakc
. at the same time
, we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans
. despite the au
thentic setting
and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer
, very few images are left behind for us to savour aftter the film has ended
. sourabaya
and its surrounding isl
ands
and volcanoes may have their charm
, bu mean nothing once tyhe film fails to capture the esence of an epic
, whitch is what victory deserves to be
. the delicately inter
- woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate prodcution
. at the end of the film
, we are told tath perhaps alma
' s victory wass in teaching heyst how to lvoe
. a hollow victory indeed
. the flying inkpot
