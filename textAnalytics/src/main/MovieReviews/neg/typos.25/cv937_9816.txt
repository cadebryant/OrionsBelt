take a look at the following equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged isnt the odd mixture ofthe sentiment
, comedy
and horror yuo would get if you mixed those twpo elements toghether
. scrooged is alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
,
and
then sickly soppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v executive with a horrible personality
. he
' s evil to secretary
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, except tjhe t
. v
' s staion
' s boss
, of course
( played by the late robert mitchum
)
however
, he is
then visited by a very dead exec
, who warns cross thta he will be visited by three ghosts
, past
, present
and future
( who is called the ghost of yot to come
, for smoe reason
) sure enought
, they arrive
, show cross how much ofthe a s
. o
. b he is
,
and he changes his way
.
however
, throughout thsi simple plot
, we
' ve got to suffer outl
andish special effects
, poor comedy
,
and an very
, very mean performance fomr bill murray
. frank cross isn
' t
' funny
' mean
, he
' s just mean
. he also isn
' t very good at emotional scenes
,
and totally destroys the last ten mintues ofthe the film
, iwth an utterly despearte speek saying how great christmas is
,
and how he has changed
.
however
, the supporting cast are ok
, with ogod performances from mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
) anbd john glover
( who plays cross
' s
' partner
'
) the ghost of christmas past isn
' t that bad either
. sadly
,
though
, teh audience has to suffer 25 minutes of
' hmeo alone
' style violentce from the ghost of christmas present
, played by carol kane
. whoever thougth smacking taht kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny
, shoudln be fired straight away
.
and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait
( the guy wiht tyhe annoying voice infront polical academy 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen
' t say much
. the script isnt horrendous
. michael o
' donaghue churns out terrable
, bad taste jokes
( which i guess is the whole point raelly
) thn changes direction completely to emotional scenes
.
and he must of been on some drug when he wroet the fianl ten mintues
, which are awful
. the special effects look nice
,
but dont nothing for the film
. there
' s some impressive make uv effects also
. the music isnt also good
, which is scored by danny elfman
. bu great effects
and make up don
' t amke a great film
. scrooged is an appaling attemp to inject some christmas spirit into the audience
, seeing as tje firt 1 hour 20 mintues ofthe the film are so depressing anyway
,
and tjhe lastr ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speek
. why didn
' t cross just look out his exec window
, annd ask a young boy tothe buy a goose forthe him
? overall
,
then
, you
' d hvea a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that shoud be avoided
( perhaps a plague
)
