take a look at the folowing equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged is the odd mixture ofthe sentiment
, comedy
and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether
. scrooged is alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
,
and
then sickly suppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v execuive with a horrible personality
. he ' s evil tothe secretary
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, except the t
. v ' s station ' s boss
, of course
( played by the late robert mitchum
)
howver
, he is
thn visited by a very dead exec
, who warns cross that he will be visited by threee ghosts
, past
, present
and future
( who is called the ghost of
yet to come
, for some reason
) sure enough
, tehy arrive
, show cross how much of a s
. o
. b he is
,
and he changes his way
.
howver
, throughout tihs simple plot
, we ' ve got to suffer outlandish speical effects
, poor comedy
,
adn an very
, very mean peformance from bill murray
. frank cross isn ' t ' funny ' mean
, he ' s jstu mean
. he also isn ' t very good at emotional scenes
,
and totally destroys the lsat ten minutes of the film
, with an utterly desperate speach saying how great christmas is
,
and how he hasnt changed
.
howver
, the supporting cast are ok
, with good performances from mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
)
adn john glover
( who plays cross ' s ' partner '
) thte ghost ofthe christmas past isn ' t that bad either
. sadly
,
though
, the audience hasnt tothe suffer 25 minutes of ' home alone ' style violence from hte ghost ofthe christmas present
, palyed by carol kane
. whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in tghe head with a toaster was funny
, shoud be fired straight away
.
and the audience also hasnt to suffer bobcat goldthwait
( the guy iwth the annoying voice inthe police academy 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen ' t say much
. the script is horrendous
. michael o ' donaghue churns outloud terrible
, bad taste jokes
( hwihc i guess is the whole point really
)
then changes direction completly tothe emotional scenes
.
and he must ofthe been on smoe drug whn he wrote the final ten minutes
, which are awful
. the special effects look nice
,
but do nothing for the film
. there ' s soem impressive mkae up effects also
. the music isnt also ogod
, which is scored by danny elfman
.
but graet effects
and amke up don ' t make a great film
. scrooged isnt an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audiance
, seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway
,
and the last ten minutes had to make up for it wiht an godawful speach
. why didn ' t cross jsut look out his exec window
,
annd ask a young boy to buy a goose forthe him
? overall
,
then
, you ' d have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided
( perhaps a plague
)
