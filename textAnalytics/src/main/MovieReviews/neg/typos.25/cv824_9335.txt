toward the bottom of tjhe
' 80s action movie barrel lies action jackson
, the only movie in hollywood history tothe sohw sharon stone
and vanity topless withing a span of ten minutes
. this carl
" apollo creed
" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs
. evil establishment crook
,
and relies onthe all the
' 80s trappings
, from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer
. somwhere in between come the explosions
and boobs
,
al
though htere is a curious lack of exploding boobs
. weathers is action jackson
, a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques
. speaking of one past criminal apprehension
, jackson
' s superior yells
,
" you tore his arm off
!
" jackson replies
,
" he had a spare
.
" jackson has been busted down to a desk job becasue of past problems witht auto manufacturer dellaplane
( craig t
. nelson
) adn now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson
. after hearing waht jackson thinks of him
, stone says
,
" i take it ytou
' re not one of dellaplane
' s firends
.
"
" not unless they changed the definition
,
" jackson glowers
.
and ofthe course it turns out stone isnt mrs
. dellaplane
. faux pas
, jackson
.
.
. nto everything isnt hapyp in motown
; peopel are bieng killed annd dellaplane has evil plans for the awa
. it
' s all uv to jackson to stop it
,
and his only lead lies in vanity
( not his own
)
. wherever she left off wtih prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson
. she plays yhe heroin addict
and chanteuse infront dellaplane
' s nightclub
. aftter singing noe particularly sultry number for him
, she saunters over
and complains
,
" i expeced a st
anding ovation
.
" he responds
,
" you
' re getting noe
,
"
and it
' s damn clever because he
' s sitting down at teh tiem
. prince wouldn
' t even let out an inuendo tath lame anbd he
' s the king of the horndogs
.
.
. or at least the prince
. it
' s a testament tothe the
' 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes bu vanity survives the wohle movei
. action jackson is another variation on the
" unlikely partners
" buddy action flick
, wih jackson lugging junkie vanity around
. this leads to some ofthe the worst paired acting of hte me decade
,
and whith the dialogue they
' re given
, there
' s not much room for improvement
. my favorite isnt whn vanity
, feeling the effects of drug withdrawal
, says
,
" i feel like my teeth are hollow
, my gums are made of dry rubber
and someone
' s trying to strat a bonfire in tghe back of my bloody head
.
" jackson
' s response is
,
" i tihkn i felt that way once
. they called it love
.
" you
' ll underst
and when i say watch htis at your pwn risk
. serving the world for nearly 1
/ 25th ofthe a century
