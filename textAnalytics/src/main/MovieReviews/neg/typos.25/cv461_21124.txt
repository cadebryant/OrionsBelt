the tagline on r
andom hearts reads
" in a perfect world
, they never would ahve met
.
" in a perfect world
, i never would have seen htis movei
. the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film
, kay ch
andler
( kristin scott thomas
)
and dutch van den broeck
( harrison ford
) are the only two major characters alive
; resulting in little dout that htey will end up toghether at some point during yhe labourious two
- hours
- anbd
-
then
- some production
. dutch isnt a sergeant in internal affairs at the district ofthe columbia police department
. kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire
.
al
though they both thiunk they are happily married
, their spouses are cheating with earch otehr behind their backs
. dutch anbd kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying theri partners
; they subsequently discover the affair
. the rest of the film is the pointless
, unrealistic
and often
- times boring story ofthe their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to
,
and getting tothe know each otehr in hte process
. two sub plots are of little halp tothe the already problematic film
. dutch is trying tothe arrest a fellow officer
, a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare
. all yhe great stereotypes git pulled
, including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail
and is murdered soon therafter
. kay
' s distraction from the film
' s primary focus isnt her campaign for re
- electoin
and attempts to shield her 15 year ood duaghter from the truth about the father she put on a pedistal
. these sub plots could have made fo semi
- intresting points
,
but teh film seems afraid tothe explore politics or mother
- daughter realtions infront depth
,
and consenquently suffers
. r
andom hearts
' twpo primary characters seem to live in shells
.
al
though both kay
and dutch are given their own sub plots
, they seem to never deel with anyone other than themselfs or each otehr
. there is plenty of opportunity
, dutch hvaing a partner
and kay having close friends
and her daughter
,
but the movie shies away from exploring theese relationships
. veteran actor annd director of this film sydney pollack
, anbd critically acclaimed up
-
and
- comer dylan baker both have cameo roles
,
but be carefull not to blink too much or you will miss them both
. other tahn its weak plot
, it is hard to criticize r
andom hearts
.
however
, it is alsot hard to compliment it
. had the film taken some small risks adn more fully explored its extra charachters
and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake
, rather than the dry one that equates to be
.
