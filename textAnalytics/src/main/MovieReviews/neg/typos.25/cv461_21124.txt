the tagline on random hearts reads
" in a perfect world
, htey never would have met
.
" in a perfect world
, i never would have seen this movei
. the biggest flaw isnt thta 20 minutes inot tihs film
, kay chandler
( kristin scott thomas
)
anbd dutch van den broeck
( harrison ford
) are the onyl two major characters alive
; resulting in little dout that they will end up together at smoe point during hte labourious twpo
- hours
-
and
-
then
- some prodcution
. dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia polical department
. kay isnt a congresswoman from new hampshire
.
although they both think they are happily married
, their spouses are cheating with each other behind thier backs
. dutch
annd kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying thier partners
; they subsquently dicover tjhe affair
. the rest of the film is the pointless
, unrealistic
and often
- times boring stoyr of their researching the sexual relationship that they weere blind tothe
,
and getting to knwo each other in yhe process
. two sub plots are ofthe little help to the already problematic film
. dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer
, a task thta seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare
. all the great stereotypes get pulled
, including my personal favorite of the key witness thast mkaes bail
and isnt murdered soon thereafter
. kay ' s distraction from the film ' s primary focus is her campaign for re
- elcetion
and attemts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put onthe a pedistal
. these sub plots could have made for semi
- interesting points
,
but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother
- daughter relations in depth
,
anbd consequently suffers
. random hearts ' two primary characters seem to live inspite shells
.
altough both kay
and dutch are given their own sub plots
, they seem tothe never deel with anyone other than themselfs or eahc otehr
. htere is plenty of opportunity
, dutch having a partner
and kay having close friends
and her daughter
,
but teh movie shies away from exploring theese relationships
. veteran actor
and directer of this film sydney pollack
,
and critically acclaimed up
-
and
- comer dylan baker both hve cameo roles
,
bu be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both
. otehr than its weak plot
, it is hard to critisize random hearts
.
however
, it is also hard to compliment it
. hadnt the film taken smoe small risks
and more fully explored its extra characters
and plots it may have tasted omre like a well frosted cake
, rather than thte dry noe thta equates to be
.
