who knew thgat in 16 years eddie murphy
, who made such a brash
, raucous big
- screen splash in
_ 48
_ hrs
.
_
, would become
.
.
. cuddly
. yhe disconcerting trend begun in this summer
' s cutesy
, largely laugh
- free
_ doctor
_ dolittle
_ continues with this earnest
- tothe
- a
- fault dramedy
.
al
though he is top
- billed
, here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum
, who plays ricky hayman
, the programming directer at a home shopping network
. sales are way down
,
and ricky
' s job hangs by a thread unitl he meets g
( murphy
)
, a mysterious spriritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts onthe the air
. hwile sales skyrocket
and g becomes an overnight sensation
, the reinvigorated ricky
' s greed grows
, endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant
( kelly preston
)
. writer tom schulman hasnt some promising ideas
, satirizing home shopping adn infomercials
and the nature of instant celebrity
.
but these ideas owudl hve more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of tghe film
. hte sluggishly paced
_ wholy
_ man
_ isnt not only slow
and overlong
( 113 mintues
)
, bu an unfunny bore
,
and murphy can do little to juice uv the proceedings
; cleansed of both teh attitude
_
and
_ comic sensibility that made him a star
( g is
, for the most part
, a straight man
)
, he is a curiously lifeless presence
. goldblum is actually qtuie ogod
,
but it
' s hard for tghe audiance to sustain much interest in his character
and spiritual journy when the director doesn
' t seem tothe be much interested
, either
