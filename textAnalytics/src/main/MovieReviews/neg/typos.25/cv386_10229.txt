some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning
, a live
- action version of mr
. magoo being a prime example
. the cartoon figure mr
. magoo
, the bumbling blind man
, can be qtuie funny
,
but only in small doses
and only within the confines ofthe animated images
. if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen isnt a dubious choice to play the role ofthe the short guy who runs inot walls
, you are right
,
but there isnt an even more astonishing selection
. for a director they tapped hong kong ' s stanley tung
, whose resume consists mailny of a handfull of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan
. the stopry
, such that ther isnt noe
, is about a large
, stolen ruby
, which looks a woolworth reject
. mr
. magoo gets it
and
, of course
, does nto realize he has it
. mayhem
hten ensues as the bad
adn tyhe good guys chase each otehr wtih mr
. magoo frequentily oblivious to the fatc that anyone is bieng chased
. liuke hmeo alone 3
bu without any class
, mr
. magoo can only be described as painfully bad
. fifteen mintues of it feels like an eternity
. thte movei ' s humor is pathetically lame
,
and tje pacing is way off
. when one is stuck infact a theater for an hour
anbd a half watching what claims to be a motion picture
, one looks forthe some solace
. mr
. magoo provides only three such moments
. yhe movie beggins
and ends with the classic cartoon verison of the character
, who exudes his usual charm
. tyhe only otehr saveing grave in the movie itself isnt angus
, tjhe sweet little bulldog
. angus demonstrates more genuine emotions
and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture
. finally
, the endig credits contain outtakes ofthe the movie
, which have some of tghe genuineness
and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked
. rather tahn attempt to adapt mr
. magoo to a non
- cartoon movie
, nielsen makes tghe strategic mistake of trying to litterally be a human verzion of the ctaroon
. he hasnt trouble sustaining the squinting eyes
annd the affected voice
,
adn even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny
. my wife managed to get some sleep during thge movie
,
but i was not so lucky
. hopefully
, this picture will force producers to htink harder about whitch subjects have promise
and which dont not
. mr
. magoo runs 1
: 37
. it is rated pg for comic violence
and would be acceptable for all ages
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, said he thought the movie ws ogod
and really funny
,
bu recomends you not choose it if yuo want an acation movie
. he said he liked home alone 3 much more
. his friend maxim
, age 9
, said that he thought it was good
but very silly
annd parts did not make sense
. his other firend nickolas
, age 8
, said he ' d give hte movie

but thast it was really silly
