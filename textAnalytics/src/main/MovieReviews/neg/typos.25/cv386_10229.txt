some concepts seem patently hopeless ffrom the begining
, a live
- action verison ofthe mr
. magoo being a prime example
. tjhe cartoon figure mr
. magoo
, the bumbling blind man
, can be qtuie funny
, bu onyl in small doses
and only within the confines of animated images
. if you htink naked gun star leslie nielsen isnt a dubious choise to play the role ofthe yhe short guy who runs inot walls
, you are right
,
but there is an even more astonishing selction
. for a director tehy tapped hong kong
' s stanley tong
, whose resume consists mainly of a h
andfull ofthe movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan
. the story
, such that there is oen
, is baout a large
, stolen ruby
, which looks a woolworth reject
. mr
. magoo gets it annd
, of course
, does not realize he hasnt it
. mayhem
then ensues as thte bad
and the good guys chase each otehr with mr
. magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is bieng chased
. like hmeo alone 3
but without any class
, mr
. magoo can onyl be described as painfully bad
. fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity
. the movie
' s humor is pathetically lame
, anbd tje pacing is way off
. when one is stuck in a theather fo an hour
and a half watching what claimes to be a motion picture
, one looks forthe some solace
. mr
. magoo provides only three such moments
. the movie begins adn ends iwth teh classic cartoon version of the charachter
, who exudes his usual charm
. the only other saving grave inthe the movie itself is angus
, the sweet little bulldog
. angus demonstrates more genuine emotions
and a wider acting range tahn any of the humans in the picture
. finally
, hte ending credits contain outtakes of the movie
, which ahev some of the genuineness
and spontaneity that tjhe movie badly lacked
. rether than attempt tothe adapt mr
. magoo tothe a non
- ctaroon movie
, nielsen makse the strategic mistake of trying to litterally be a human version of the cartoon
. he hasnt trouble sustaining the squinting eyes
and the affected voice
, annd even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny
. my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie
,
but i ws nto so lucky
. hopefully
, this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise
and whihc do not
. mr
. magoo runs 1
: 37
. it is rated pg for comic voilence
and owudl be acceptable for all ages
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, said he thougth the movie was good adn really funny
,
but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie
. he said he liekd hmeo alone 3 much more
. his friend maxim
, age 9
, said that he
thought it was good bu very silly
and parts did nto mkea sense
. his otehr friend nickolas
, age 8
, said he
' d give the movie
