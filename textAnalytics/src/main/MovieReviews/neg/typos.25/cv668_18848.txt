htere have been merchant
- ivory costume dramas with moreso of a pulse thna
" the mod squad
,
" a self
- consciously
" hip
" cinematic rendering of hte ood tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby
- boomers
. well
, said
" squad
" certainly won
' t be a pleasant viewing experince for them or anybody alse
, maybe even the teen target audeince the movie has been geared towards
. a contemporary take on this decidedly
' 70s show doesn
' t exactly seem unwarranted
,
but oney wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn
' t tranform into a full
- blown case of botulism
. how curious that tyhe film beggins by defining both mod
and squad
, insisting that the latter is a group of people wroking toghether anbd
then contradicting this dfeinition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of tjhe running time
. they are julie
, pete
and linc
, reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd
( exposition put out of the way so fast thgat you
' re likely to be lost ffrom the opening moments onthe
)
,
and they are respectively plyed by claire danes
, giovanni ribisi
and omar epps
, talented actors each deserving of better than this
. their plight involves st
andard cop
- corruption stuff
, as our would
- be protagonists catch wind ofthe an internal cover
- up after their superior
( reliable dennis farina
, one of thte best things here anbd gone so quicklyu
) gets killed annd framed for drug trafficking
. htey pout a lot adn eventually get cracking to expose htis convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tatics that would imbaress teh hardy boys
and linda tripp bu few others
. when you
' re supposed to be asking
,
" what
' s going to hapen next
?
"
, you
' ll instead entertain
thoughts like
" who are these people
and why should i care
?
" or
" aren
' t thrillers supposed to contain thrills
?
" not that danes
, epps
and ribisi don
' t give it a shot
. danes can dont the troubled teen thing inthe her sleep
, as evidenced by
" my so
- called life
,
"
but she
' s saddled with a mysterous
- boyfriend
( josh brolin
) subplot so see
- through you begin to seriously question her so
- called intelligence
. ditto fo ribisi
' s
(
" saveing private ryan
"
) looney loose cannon
,
though at least he performs with a wild
- annd
- crazy vigor that occasionally dem
ands attension
.
but epps
- poor epps
. epps
(
" higher learning
"
) is so short
- changed he
' s reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him
. all this sloppiness cin be attri
buted to the screenwriters
, one of whom
, scott silver
, is also the directer
. they must think that if they dress up their stupid stoy in such spiffy trappings
( the look of the film isnt relaly quite impressive
)
, it
' ll somehow pay off
,
but this
" mod squad
" plods anyway
. charachters are non
- existent
; prseent are just smoe ogod
- looking young thnigs modeling cool levis
and cooler attitudes
. plot hardly escapes confusing convention
.
and the one genre element ytou
' d think would be show up in generous portions
- a few nifty explosions
, smoe fights
, any kind ofthe action whatsoever
- only rarley makes it to this dull gabfest
. all thsoe quick tothe put down last month
' s inept
but serviceable
" my favorite martian
" update need tothe take a step back
. here
' s a small
- tothe
- big
- screen translation taht really should
' ve stayed in its former incarnation
,
" mod
" or nto
.
