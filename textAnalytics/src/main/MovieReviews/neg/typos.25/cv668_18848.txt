there have been merchant
- ivory costume dramas with omre of a pulse than
" the mod squad
,
" a self
- consciously
" hip
" cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby
- boomers
. well
, said
" squad
" certainly won ' t be a pleasant viewing experience fo them or anybody else
, maybe even the teen target audience the movie hasnt beeen geared towards
. a contamporary take on this decidedly ' 70s show doesn ' t exactly seem unwarranted
,
but noe wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on tje shelf didn ' t transform into a full
- blown case of botulism
. how curious thyat the film begins by defining both mod
annd squad
, insisting that the latter is a group of people working toghether
adn
then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of thge running tiome
. they are julie
, pete
and linc
, reformed delinquents working undercover forthe tyhe lapd
( exposition put out of the way so fast that ytou ' re likely to be lost from the opening moments on
)
,
and they are respectively played by claire danes
, giovanni ribisi
annd omar epps
, talented actors eahc deserving of better than this
. their plight involves standard cop
- corruption stuff
, as our would
- be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover
- up after their superior
( reliable dennis farina
, one ofthe hte best things here
and gone so quickly
) gets killed
and framed for drug trafficking
. they pout a lot
and eventualy get cracking to expose htis convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that woudl impress the hardy boys
and linda tripp
but few others
. when you ' re supposed to be asking
,
" wqat ' s going to happen next
?
"
, you ' ll instead entertain thoughts liek
" who are theese people
anbd why should i care
?
" or
" aren ' t thrillers suppossed to contain thrills
?
" nto that danes
, epps
and ribisi don ' t give it a shot
. danes cin do the troubled teen thing inwhich her sleep
, as evidenced by
" my so
- called life
,
"
bu she ' s saddled with a mysterous
- boyfriend
( josh brolin
) subplot so see
- through you begin tothe seriously question her so
- called intelligence
. ditto forthe ribisi ' s
(
" saveing private ryan
"
) looney loose cannon
,
though at least he performs with a wild
-
and
- crazy vigor thyat occasionally demands attention
.
but epps
- poore epps
. epps
(
" higer learning
"
) is so short
- changed he ' s reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy tothe chase him
. all thsi sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters
, one of whom
, scott silver
, isnt also the director
. tehy must think that if they dress uv their stupid tsory in such spiffy trappings
( the look of the film is really quite impressive
)
, it ' ll somehow pay off
,
bu htis
" mod squad
" plods anyway
. characters are non
- existent
; rpesent are just some ogod
- looking young things modeling kool levis
adn cooler attitudes
. plot hardly escapes confusing convention
.
and the oen genre element ytou ' d think would be show up in generous portions
- a few nifty explosions
, some fights
, any kind of acation whatsoever
- only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest
. all those quick to put down last mounth ' s inept
bu serviceable
" my favorite martian
" update need to take a step bcak
. here ' s a small
- to
- big
- screen translation that really should ' ve stayed in its former incarnation
,
" mod
" or not
.
