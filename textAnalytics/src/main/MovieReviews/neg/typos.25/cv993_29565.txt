saleries ofthe hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days
and many find htis to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets
. actors who dim
and such salaries might be greedy
,
but in some instances htey are qtuie justified
, because many films would never be watched or even made without thier participation
. proof for thgat can be foudn even in the realm ofthe low
- budget movies
,
and oney fine example is breakaway
, 1995 thriller directed by sean dash
and starring
( in
) famous figure skater tonya harding
. face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie
' s poster
, bu the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra
, attractive woman who works as a courrier for gangster
. oney day she decides tothe retire
,
but her employers are anything bu enthusiastic baout that
. realising that her life suddenly became worthless
, myra starts running for her life
, folowed by professional assassins
. terri thompson being the actual star of teh film instead of tonya harding becomes quite underst
andable after the scenes that feature former figure skater
. all
though tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities
, her acting leaves much to be desired
. onthe the other h
and
, her disapointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film thast lacks originality
, believable characters
and situations annd actually represents anytying that gave b
- films a bad name
. martin sheen
' s brother joe estevez
, whose character looks like he hadnt entered from anohter movies
' set
, isnt the only bright spot of breakaway
. unfortunately
, he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding
' s silver screen de
but proved to be her last film
.
