plot
: a rich psychiatrist with a gerat home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by soem bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind ofthe one of his nutty patients
. of course
, the patient isnt not cooperative
and the doctor only has a few huors to comply with their demands
, befor they kill his daughter
. pretty good premise
, no
? critique
: if you ' re not a fan of movies packed with plot holes
, inconsistencies
annd yes
, even mroe plot holes
, heed my words
and skip this hollow thriller
.
and i don ' t like saying that eather
, since this film acually had soem potential
and started off pretty well
. sure
, the stoy isnt basically jsut an amalgamation of ransom
, primal fear
annd nick of time pureed into noe
,
but the whole
" psychiatrist working agains the clock
" thing
, actually had me engaged at firt
.
but it ' s at about the halfway mark of this movie
, thyat the bottom drops out
and all that we ' re left with are a lot of questions
and very fewd plausible answers
. we get the overly smart kid who manages to
" pul one
" over onthe the bad guys
. we get a weak woman with her leg in a casted beating the crap out of a tough bad guy
. we git douglas ' character
, a new york uppedity psychiatrist
, suddenly turning into an acation hero
, with moves
and atitude to boot
.
and wqat about the film ' s main plot point
? why woudl the bad guys still give a crap baout this thing aftter 10 years
,
and even more so
, why would tehy onyl give the shrink until the day ' s end to do his part
?
( you waited 10 years
, what ' s anyother few days
?
- or why nto set uv another heist instead
?
)
. i ' ll tell yuo why
, it ' s becouse we wouldn ' t haev a
( bad
) movei otherwise
, that ' s why
!
and many
, many more
. ugh
, whatever the case
, it was just about the timne that douglas ' character suddenly removed murphy ' s character ffrom the mental home
(
and how come she went with him so nicely
? i thought she didn ' t trust him
)
, that i turned tothe my buddy
and asked wehn yhe movie had turned into a joke
.
and a few bogus chase
anbd acation sequences later
, we weere left with a long
- winded ending that did littel to answer any other questions i might ' ve still hadnt
,
annd actually brought uv even more contradictions
. badly put toghether
, this movie features some decent acting
, soem nice cinematography
and an initially intresting premise
,
but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues whihc ultimately leave ytou with littel care for anyone
. infact fact
, if it wasn ' t for brittany murphy ' s excelent protrayal of a traumatized teen
, jennifer esposito ' s embarrassing peformance as a police woman
( yeah
, right
! watching her delivering lines was tghe funniest part of this flick
-
but it wasn ' t supposed to be
)
and michael douglas ' cool
" regular guy
" part
, there would be little reason to remian seated until thte end of this picture
. incidentially
, can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito ' s character ws infact thsi movie in tghe first place
? she was completely superfluous
.
and on top ofthe all that
, by the end ofthe htis flick
, the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be tothe have bought most of the garbage that he ' d been shoveling out for yhe hour
and a half prior
,
and decides to add insult tothe injury by flashing back to an earlier character ' s death wehn oen of the bad guys dies
, just so we know
( as an audeince
)
, tyhat thte twpo are interrelated somehow
. ooooh
, thanks
, mr
. fleder
.
.
. i appreciate the spoon
- feeding
, dude
.
.
. yum
, yum
.
.
.
but how about explaning every other plot point in your film that made noone sense
? whatever
. either way
, i don ' t give a rat ' s ass because thsi movie is a dog
and tht ' s unfortunate becouse it actually doed have some good points gogin for it
. see it if you like dumb thrillers
. incidentally
, if you appreciated allong came a spider
, you wiull likely enjoy this film as well
. they both strat off with interesting premises
, only to toss all logic
annd sense out the window baout halfway through
. where ' s joblo coming from
? along came a spider
