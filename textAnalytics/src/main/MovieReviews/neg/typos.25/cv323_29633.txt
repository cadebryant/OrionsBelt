plot
: a rich psychiatrist with a grat hmeo life gets his cute daugter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him tothe extract some information from the mind ofthe one ofthe his nutty patients
. of course
, the patient is not cooperative
and the doctor only hasnt a fewd hours to comply with theri dem
ands
, before they kill his daughter
. pretty good premise
, noone
? critique
: if you
' re not a fan of movies packed whith plot holes
, inconsistencies
and yes
, even more plot holes
, heed my words
and skip this hollow thriller
. adn i don
' t like saying that eather
, since htis film actually had soem potential annd started off pretty well
. sure
, the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom
, primal fear
and nick ofthe tiem pureed into one
,
but the whole
" psychiatrist working againnst the clock
" thing
, ctually hadnt me engaged at first
.
but it
' s at about the halfway mark of this movie
, that tyhe bottom drops out
and all that we
' re left whith are a lot of questions
and vyre faw plausible answers
. we git hte overly smart kid who manages to
" pull noe
" over on the bad guys
. we git a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out ofthe a tough bad guy
. we get douglas
' chracter
, a newyorker york uppedity psychiatrist
, suddenly turning into an acation hero
, with moves
and attitude tothe boot
.
and what about the film
' s main plot point
? why would tje bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years
, anbd even more so
, why owudl they only give the shrink unil the day
' s end to dont his part
?
( you waited 10 years
, what
' s anohter few dyas
?
- or why not set up another heist instead
?
)
. i
' ll tell ytou why
, it
' s baceause we wouldn
' t ahev a
( bad
) movie otherwise
, tyhat
' s why
! annd many
, many more
. ugh
, whatever the case
, it ws just about the tiome tath douglas
' charachter suddenly removed murphy
' s character from the mental home
(
and how cmo she went with him so nicely
? i thougth she didn
' t trust him
)
, that i turned to my buddy anbd asked when the movie hadnt turned into a joke
.
and a few bogus chase adn action sequences later
, we weere left with a long
- winded endig that did little to answer any other questions i might
' ve still had
,
and actually brought up even more contradictions
. badly put toghether
, thsi movie features some decent acting
, soem nice cinematography
and an initially interesting premise
,
but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you wtih little care for anyone
. in fact
, if it wasn
' t for brittany murphy
' s excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen
, jennifer esposito
' s embarrassing performance as a polical woman
( yeah
, right
! watching her delivering lines wass the funniest part of this flick
-
but it wasn
' t supposed to be
) anbd michael douglas
' cool
" regluar guy
" part
, there owudl be littel reason to remain seated until the end ofthe this picture
. incidentally
, can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito
' s carachter wass in this movie in tjhe first place
? she was completely superfluous
.
and on top of all that
, by the end of this flick
, the director seems to haev realized how dumb the audience must be tothe haev bought most ofthe the garbage that he
' d been shoveling out for the hour
and a half prior
,
and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back tothe an ealier character
' s death when oney ofthe teh bad guys dies
, just so we know
( as an audeince
)
, tyhat thte two are interrelated somehow
. ooooh
, thanks
, mr
. fleder
.
.
. i appreciate the spoon
- feeding
, dude
.
.
. yum
, yum
.
.
. bu how about explaining eveyr other plot point in your film that made no sence
? whatever
. eather way
, i don
' t give a rat
' s ass because tihs movie is a dog
and that
' s unfortunate beacuse it actualyl did ahve some good points oging for it
. see it if you liuke dumb thrillers
. incidentally
, if you appreciated along cameback a spider
, you iwll likely enjoy this film as well
. they both start off with interesting premises
, only tothe toss all logic
and sense out the window baout halfway through
. where
' s joblo comming from
? along came a spider
