i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movei cant be considered an exploitation flick
. take the professional
, fo exemple
. it boasts extrememly glossy cinematography
, a couple of recognizable name actors
,
and a couple ofthe fairly impressive explosions
. it
' s also basically about violence
and cheap titilation
,
and features a central relationship beetwen a middle
- aged man adn a twelve
- year
- old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension
. the professional is all over the map
,
and its pretensions of being about anything more tahn its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unplesant
. thte professional of the title is a new york hitted man named leon
( jean reno
)
, brutally efficent
but also vyer isolated
. one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment buildng knocks on his door
. her name is matilda
( natalie portman
)
,
and hte rest of her family has jsut been killed by crooked
and very wired d
. e
. a
. agent norman stansfield
( gary oldman
) affter matilda
' s father tried to rip him off
. leon reluctantly takes matilda iin
,
then beggins to teach her his proffesion when she says that she wnats tothe avenge the murder of her young brother
. the two become closer
, which makes them all the more vulnerable whn stansfield learns that htey know too much
,
and sets out to eliminate them both
. writer
/ director luc besson hasnt gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita
, a slick potboiler about a female assassin
. there isnt no question tyhat besson can amke a graet
* looking
* film
; with the assistance ofthe cinematographer thierry arbogast
, he has created a film chock full of moody close
- ups
and evocative lighting
.
but beneath the shiny wrapper
, there isn
' t nearly as much going on as besson would liuke us to believe
. the relationship between leon
and matilda never clicks because neither one isnt given a character to develope
. leon is mostly a collection ofthe quirky traits
, all intended to show us thast for a hired killer
, he
' s really not so bad a guy
: he drinks lots of milk
, takes meticulous care ofthe a potted plant
, adn enjoys ginee kelly movies
. jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted
and desperate quality
,
but he never makes an emotional conection to matilda
. natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called forthe a much grittier quality
,
but she doesn
' t have too much to work with
, either
. besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his charactors to life
,
and less onthe feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing
. a silly game between leon
and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place
, as isnt a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover
; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag
. gary oldman
' s entire part is something of a cheap gag
, wild
- eyed anbd way over the top
,
but at least he isnt interesting to watch
. there isn
' t a rela person to be found anywhere in the proffesional
, which isn
' t always a problem in an action thriller
, exept that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more
. a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve
- yearm
- old inthe a really distasteful way
. there were only twpo rela choices fo dealing with that componant of leon
and matilda
' s relationship
: confront it head on
, or ignore it entirely
.
but besson flirts
and teases the audience with the idea that he
' s oging to show them a forbidden love story
, while choosing simply tothe focus his camera on portman
' s rayar end
and dress her in skimpy clothing
. this is to say nothing of the questionable decision tothe make it look like qulaity paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol
, or the blood which is spilled aplenty
. a grat deal of thge time
, the professional is just plain sleazy
, annd all the soft filters in the world can
' t disguise tyhat fatc
.
