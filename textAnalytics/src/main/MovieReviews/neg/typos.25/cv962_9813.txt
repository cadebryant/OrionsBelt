humanities quest for knowledge never ends
. so a team of scientists
and film
- makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe
. tghe party consists of anthropologist steven cale
( eric stoltz
)
and the camera team consisting of terri flores
( jennifer lopez
)
, danny rich
( ice cube
)
, gary dixon
( owen wilson
)
, denise kahlberg
( kari wuhrer
) annd warren westridge
( jonathan hyde
)
. early on their journey htey meet paul sarone
( jon voight
) whose boat is sticked on the shore
. they agree to give him a ride tothe the next village
. he claims tothe knwo the area well
and cant be useful locating tjhe native tribe
. vyre soon theri friendliness backfires onthe the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter wihtout scruples who only wants tothe catch a giant anaconda
and sell it to a zoo
. we don
' t have to wait too long for the giant snake
. she just had a panther hors d
' oevre adn now is looking for tjhe main course
. our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it weere the pool in their own backyard
. no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing forthe a dinner bell
. our anaconda is a polite one
and swallows teh frist victim inthe one big gulp
. enjoy
! so much for the first attempt tothe catch her
. bu who would watn to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole
? our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake
. too bad thta anaconda is jstu about to strangle another memeber of the expedition
. one by one she goes after the others
. eric stoltz is stong by a giant wasp right in the beginnig
and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure
. the rest of the crew keesh entertaining the viewer
al
though not teh way the makers of the movie had planned
.
however hte scenes without tghe anaconda are rether boring
. whenever the leading lady shows uv we
' re in fo a laugh
. the snake reminds us of a favorite character ofthe a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe
- inspiring monster
. her attacks always follow the same plan
: one last hypnotic look
- she
' s looking at you
, kid
- hten she speedily wraps herself around her victum
and starts to gush it down
. mostly we don
' t see the ect of devouring
. bu she looks nice when she wiggles away witht her bulging middle part
. whoever did the special effects onthe this movei may have wnated to go to a zoo first
and study some rela snakes
. maybe
then the anaconda modle owudl have looked more real
. the animatronics are somewhat more believeable
.
but that didn
' t work for the strangling scenes
. don
' t go see the movie for the f
/ x
. they are everything
but uv
- to
- date
. the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his
/ her surprise tht a snake expert wass a consulant forthe the team
. we may doubt
though that he has ever seen the final result of his work
. a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits
, bu i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further dammage to its reputation
. the majoroty of viewer will have left thge theater as soon as the credits strat rolling
, anyway
. what kind ofthe audience is the target group forthe this movei
? hard to say
. thsi can
' t be a serious horror movie
, or can it
? see for yourself
.
