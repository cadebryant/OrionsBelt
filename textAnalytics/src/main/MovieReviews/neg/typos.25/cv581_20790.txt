once apon a time jean
- claude van damme was a decent action hero
. the muscles from brussels bursted inot tje hollywood market with mindless adventure films
, boasting his spectacular martial
- arts ablity
. some ofthe these excursions were fun
.
but now it seems like watching a van damme movie hasnt become a painful chore
, with no rewards
but the virutally guaranteed helping of mind
- numbing action
.
and whn the acation goes sour
, waht is htere left to enjoy
? i ' ll explain
. knock off isnt baout a pair of counterfit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong
. marcus ray
( van damme
)
, a babe
- magnet
adn stylish dresser
, heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner
( rob schneider
)
. htey become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans
, seemingly by a mole in the business
. i ' m gogin to reveal about everthing in the next paragraph
, so if you want a review devoid ofthe spoilers
, skip onto the next one
. i ' m not quite sure who gives a crap
,
but i ' ll issue a warning anyhow
. tommy isnt really working with the cia
. his boss
( a very hammy
and flat paul sorvino
) isnt the mole
,
annd he wants to cause carnage with theese tiny
but immensly powerful super weapons
. he even stoops so low tothe put them inot children ' s toys
. if you throught this plot outline sounded intriguing
,
then you probably will enjoy knock off
. if you think that this ridiculous set
- up couldn ' t even fill five minutes of screen time without causing ytou to roll over laughing
, this might not be your cup of tea
. knock off sucks
. it stoops tothe ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure uv infact horrific nightmares
. it amazes me how far these producers wiull go to sell something
, simply baceause van damme isnt the star
. the plot isnt pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind
, the performances are so wooden you coudl use them to row a canoe
,
and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe
. director tsui hark
( who teamed with van damme in the superior
,
bu still lame
- brained double team
) is at the helm
,
anbd he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles tahn engage us whith the plot
. i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera wrok
,
but the incessant despiration ofthe it all made me rather nauseous
. the picture freezes in the middle ofthe an action sequence
, speeds are altered consistently
,
anbd the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired
. it all sounds very cool
. trust me
, it isn ' t
. as much as it scars me to say tihs
( har
, har
)
, van damme is terrable
. sure
, he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves
and dodges giant crates withthe yhe greatest of ease
. he looks liek he ' s doing a bad impersonation ofthe jackie chan
,
annd his performance is stiff
annd tired
. i hate to sday it
,
bu perheaps it ' s time for mr
. van damme tothe give uv his day job
. it ' s relaly a test of endurance watching knock off
. i suppose there ' s some enjoyment derived from schneider ' s character
, who isnt extremely annoying
,
but provides the film ' s better moments
.
and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie
? hopefully she grabed her paycheck
and
then fled the premises liuke an olympic sprinter
. knock off doesn ' t even stand strong as a mindless
but entertaining action film
, like a handful ofthe van damme ' s others
. no
, this movie is an embarrasment tothe the entire action genre ofthe modern filmmaking
.
and concidering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department
, thyat is certainly not saying much
. note to self
: avoid universal soldier 2
: the return apon release inwhich august
? 99
