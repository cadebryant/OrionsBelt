once upon a time jean
- claude van damme wass a decent action hero
. the muscles from brussels bursted inot tje hollywood market whith mindless adventure films
, boasting his spectauclar martial
- arts ability
. some ofthe these excursions weere funn
.
but nowe it seems liuke watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore
, with no rewards
but the virtually guaranteed helping ofthe mind
- numbing acation
. anbd whn tyhe action goes sour
, what is there left to enjoy
? i
' ll explain
. knock off is baout a pair of counterfit jeans salesmen working outloud ofthe an office inthe hong kong
. marcus ravy
( van damme
)
, a babe
- magnet anbd stylish dresser
, heads up the company withthe an annoying weasel ofthe a partner
( rob schneider
)
. they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans
, seamingly by a mole in the business
. i
' m going tothe reveal about everyting in the enxt paragraph
, so if you want a review devoid of spoilers
, skip onto the next one
. i
' m not qtuie sure who gives a crap
,
but i
' ll issue a warning anyhow
. tommy isnt really working with the cia
. his boss
( a vyre hammy
and flat paul sorvino
) is the mole
,
and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny
but immensley powerful super weapons
. he even stoops so low to put them into children
' s toys
. if you thougth this plot outline sounded intriguing
,
then you probably iwll enjoy knock off
. if you think that this rediculous setted
- up couldn
' t even fill five minutes ofthe screen time wihtout causing you to roll over laughing
, this might not be your cup of tea
. knock off sucks
. it stoops to rediculous levels that most individuals could onyl conjure up inwhich horrific nightmares
. it amazes me how far theese producers will go to sell something
, simpley because van damme is the star
. the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane acation sequences that will baffle your mind
, the performances are so wooden you coudl use them tothe row a canoe
, annd the action itself is an absolute catastrophe
. director tsui hark
( who teamed withthe van damme iin the superior
,
but still lame
- brained double team
) is at hte helm
,
and he would rether attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot
. i supose i enjoyed some of teh camera work
, bu the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous
. tjhe picture freezes infront the middle ofthe an action sequence
, speeds are altered consistently
,
and thge camera tricks mostly apply tothe traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired
. it all soudns vrey cool
. trust me
, it isn
' t
. as much as it scars me tothe say this
( har
, har
)
, van damme is terrible
. sure
, he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves
and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease
. he looks like he
' s donig a bad impersonation of jackie chan
, anbd his performance is stiff anbd tired
. i hate to sday it
,
but perhpas it
' s timne fo mr
. van damme to give up his day job
. it
' s realy a test of endurance watching knock off
. i supose there
' s some enjoyment deriviated from schneider
' s charactor
, who isnt extremly annoying
,
but provides the film
' s better moments
. annd what isnt the beautyfull lela rochon doing inaddition this movie
? hopefully she grabed her paycheck annd
then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter
. knock off doesn
' t even st
and strong as a mindless
but intertaining action film
, like a h
andful of van damme
' s others
. noone
, this movie is an embarrassment to tghe entire action genre ofthe modern filmmaking
.
and considering how low hollywood has stoopid as ofthe late infront that deparment
, thgat is certainly not saying much
. note to self
: avoid universal soldier 2
: the return upon release in august
? 99
