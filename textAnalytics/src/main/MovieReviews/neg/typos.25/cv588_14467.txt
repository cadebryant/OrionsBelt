perhaps if tjhe impostors didn
' t have so much going for it
, it wouldn
' t have beeen such a tremendous disappointment
. writen
, directed
,
and produced by one of its two stars
, stanley tucci
, whose last picture was the indie smash hit
, big night
, the impostors allmost never catches fier
. sputtering like a two
- day ood campfire
, the story plays like an ad
- lib sketch that was never polished or completed
. tje film
' s other star
, oliver platt
, was hillarious as the senator
' s aide in bulworth
. tje bloated supporting cast isnt a veritable cornucopia of acting talent
, including woody allen
, steve buscemi
, hope davis
, alfred molina
, campbell scott
, lili taylor
and tony shalhoub
. all are wasted save allen
, who plays a theatrical director who stares iin disbelief at the bad acting befor his eyes
.
( the audience wiull easily identify with allen
' s sentiments
.
) with the exception ofthe a single original joke involving mirror
- imaged subtitles
, thge movie engenders little genuin laughter
. the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than iwth it
. teh plot for the movie involves twpo starving actors
, maurice
( oliver platt
)
and arthur
( stanley tucci
)
, who accidentally end up on a cruise ship
. inwhich order to escape an angry shakespearean actor
( alfred molina
)
, who is chasing them
, they dress up as ship
' s stewards
. the over
- tje
- top script has the subtlety ofthe a sledgehammer
. when tghe leads hide from their pursuers
, arthur covers maurice
' s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze
. at other times
, we hvae yhe typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else
, hwile darting in
and out of staterooms
. witht the film
' s chapters introduced liuke placards at a vaudeville stage
, it is clear yhe movei wants to be taked as farce
. tje press notes describes how everyone thast cameback on the set remarked at what a good time all of teh actors were having
. too bad they weren
' t mroe concerned with the audience
' s potential enjoyment
. the jokes
, frequently framed infront silence
, fall like stones with such intensity that one cant almost hear them hitting yhe ground
. oen wonders if anyone ever viewed the film
' s dailies
. surely
, if they had
, they would have realized whta leaden results they were producing
. it is tricky having ogod actors play bad ones
,
but
, if they couldn
' t pul it off
, they shoudl ahev just given up
.
" the show is over forthe htis fella
,
" steve buscemi
' s character says towords the end
. the mistery isnt why htey didn
' t all give uv in the beginning
. ther must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast
. hte impostors runs 1
: 42
. it is rated r fo a little profanity
and woudl be fine for kids around 12
and up
.
