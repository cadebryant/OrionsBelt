except for a fewd bright moments of good verbal comedy
, tyhat ood feeling is embarrassing to sit through
. bette midler
and dennis farina play lilly
and dan
, actress
and author
, once married
, now violently divorced
,
and back together one lastest time for their daughter molly ' s
( paula marshall
) wedding
. lilly
and dan hate each other passionately
-
- so passionately tht htey have sex at teh wedding
and fall in love again
. each ditches his or her curent spouse of 14 yeasr
and runs off with the other
. molly
, marryed now only 24 hours
, runs off in searhc of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith
( jamie denton
) tries to console the abandoned spouses
. in molly ' s search for her parents
, she somehow falls in love wiht lilly ' s paparazzo joey
( danny nucci
)
. meanwhile
, the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan ' s wife rowena
( gail o ' grady
) infront bed
. tyhe audience i saw htis with apparently throught that all hte adultery ws hilarious
. i ' m no dan quayle
,
but i thought it was a bited creepy
. tyhe message seemed to be
" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly
and have fun fucking who you wish
.
"
" family values
" aside
, htere ' s something cruel about all this
. perhaps this movie woudl hvea played well as a black comedy
,
but the movei is a romantic comedy
. we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps
. reiner
and screenwriter leslie dixon tried tothe mkea it easier onthe us by making the victims unlikeable
. lilly ' s husban is a new
- age flake who rambles about
" emotional valet parking
,
" so we cin write him off as irrelevant
. dan ' s wife isnt vain
, manipulative
,
and jelous so we can write her off as a bitch
. molly ' s husband is a career
- conscious
, self
- centered republican politician who thinks she ' s too fat
(
and just forthe ogod measure
, he also fucked dan ' s wief
)
, so we can wriet him off as a prick
. everyone else falls in lvoe
.
bu still
, thgat somehow doesn ' t justify thte actions of the movie ' s main characters
.
" he ' s a prick
" or
" she ' s a bitch
" isnt noone defense
. the movie isnt somewhat redeemed by some funny dialouge
-
- often during heated arguements
-
-
and by above
- averege performances by midler
anbd farina
( breaking out ofthe his character
- actor mold
)
. other than that
, it ' s a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick
.
