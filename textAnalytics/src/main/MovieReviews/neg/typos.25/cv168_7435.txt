exept forthe a few bright moments of good verbal comedy
, that ood feeling is embarrasing tothe sit through
. bette midler annd dennis farina play lilly
and dan
, actress anbd author
, once married
, nowe violently divorced
,
and back together oney lsat time for their daughter molly
' s
( paula marshall
) wedding
. lilly
and dan hate each otehr passionately
-
- so passionately tht they have sex at the wedding anbd fall in love again
. each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 eyars
and runs off with tyhe otehr
. molly
, married now only 24 hurs
, runs off inwhich search of her irresponsible parents hwile her husban keith
( jamie denton
) tries tothe console the ab
andoned spouses
. in molly
' s search for her parents
, she somehow falls in love wiht lilly
' s paparazzo joey
( danny nucci
)
. meanwhile
, the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan
' s wief rowena
( gail o
' grady
) infront bed
. the audience i saw this with apparently
thought that all the adultery was hilarious
. i
' m no dan quayle
,
but i
thought it was a bited creepy
. the message seemed to be
" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly
and have fun fucking who you wish
.
"
" family values
" aside
, there
' s something cruel baout all this
. perhaps this movie would have played well as a balck comedy
, bu the movei is a rumatic comedy
. we are supposed tothe be rooting for theese creeps
. reiner
and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable
. lilly
' s husb
and is a new
- age flake who rambles baout
" emotional valet parking
,
" so we can wriet him off as irrelevant
. dan
' s wief is vain
, manipulative
,
and jelous so we can write her off as a bitch
. molly
' s husb
and is a career
- conscious
, self
- centered epublican politician who thinks she
' s too fat
( adn jsut for good measure
, he also fucked dan
' s wief
)
, so we can rwite him off as a prick
. everyone else falls inwhich love
.
but still
, that somehow doesn
' t justify the actions of thge movie
' s main characters
.
" he
' s a prick
" or
" she
' s a bitch
" is no defense
. teh movei is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog
-
- often during heated arguments
-
- anbd by above
- average performances by midler anbd farina
( breaking out of his character
- actor mold
)
. other than tath
, it
' s a st
andard romantic comedy with a very subst
andard gimmick
.
