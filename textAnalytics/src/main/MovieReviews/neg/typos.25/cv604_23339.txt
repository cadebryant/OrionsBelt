an affluent horse breeder
' s past comes up to haunt him
; an ages old cover
- up
and blackmail comes back tothe haunt him at the h
ands of one ofthe his accomplices
. that
' s pretty much thge essence ofthe the movie
and i have to sday thta it becomes quite boring at times
and is very slow
. that aside the stopry was well presented
and probablly quite close
and representative ofthe its source
. hte acting in paticular i found veyr good
, the character development was also quite interesting
but alas the stry simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie
. a few things baout the story didn
' t sit very well with me for example tjhe orginal scam
and cover
- up heavily involved the character palyed by sharon stone
,
yet in the end her character played a relitively small role
and it seems she should have been utilized more to further tyhe story along better
. on the flip side the character palyed by catherine keener i foudn to be very interesting annd i
thought that it was developed very well
and helpped the story a lot
. the charactor
' s aside this movie hadnt soem interesting merits
but in tje end it lacked in stroy anbd pacing
. as far as tje acting anbd casting fo this movie is conserned i hvae to say that the choices ofthe nick nolte
and jeff bridges were great as well as thyat ofthe catherine keener
. all theese people acted thier parts admirably
, as fo tje part that sharon stone played
, she plyed it well
but tje part wass not utilized enough
. the directing for htis movie is something that i have to comment onthe because forthe once in a long hwile yuo see a directer actually add a veyr distinctive flavor to a movie
, this is oney ofthe those occasions
. matthew warchus in my opinion added an intresting touch
and spin tothe thge movie
and i thikn he tackled a touch subject
( i myself wouldn
' t be able to look at horseracing
and make a movie out of it
)
. there is a certain flavor about this movie
and i think thgat teh direction of tghe movie is the reason for this
. thte one falw that i do have tothe comment on is the pacing
, tje subject matter inspite my opinion wasn
' t intresting enough on its pwn to have this kind of flavoring
and directorial touch baout it
. i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as tihs does show promise even if i myself don
' t like it
. all in all i found this movie boring anbd very slow
, the acting was good bu the story just didn
' t evolve anough
and wasn
' t captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch
.
al
though there is much going for the movie i didn
' t fidn it good even
though i see the merits
and style used annd cant compliment the movie onthe them
. i wouldn
' t recommend this movei to anyone
but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic
then yuo will most likely enjoy this movei
.
