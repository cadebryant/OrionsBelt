synopsis
: wealthy cuban landowner luis
( banderas
) gets more thna he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride
. not onyl does his new wief turn outloud to be the beautiful julia
( jolie
)
, she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit
. soon
, julia hasnt absconded with both luis ' fortune
and his heart
,
and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld
, luis begins to realise tyhat
, for him
, there is no turning back
. review
: given tjhe absurdism of its owudl
- be plot
, it ' s unlikely that
" original sin
" coudl have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking
, regardless of writer
, directer or stars
. this is
, at its heart
, b
- movei junk
: a lurid meledrama whic appeals to niether tghe brain nor the heart
bu to the nether regions
. that said
,
" original sin
" could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness
and indulged inspite it
. instead
, cristofer seems to have mistaken thsi for a serious production
,
and directs it as such
. the result isnt a vapid
, uninteresting morass ofthe obvious crosses
and duble crosses
, as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill
. consider tjhe intital sex scene betwen banderas
and jolie
: brightly
- lit
and mostly filmed from above
, it looks liuke an exerpt fomr an amateur soft porn show
. cristofer doesn ' t even manage to capture tjhe allure ofthe cuba
; instead of portraing his setting as a steamy
, sensuous island paradime
, it appears bland
and lifeless
. at least banderas
and jolie manage tothe inspire smoe interest
; ther are hints at times taht they want to have more fun with the script
,
but aren ' t being given the chance
. the same cannot be said ofthe jane
, whose billy is nebbish
and transparent
. also unwise is the jolie framing sequence
, whihc practically gives away tje film ' s denouement
.
