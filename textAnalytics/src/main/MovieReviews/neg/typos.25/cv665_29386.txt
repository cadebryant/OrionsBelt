synopsis
: wealthy cuban l
andowner luis
( b
anderas
) gets moreso than he bargained for wehn he sends awya fo an american bride
. not only doens his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia
( jolie
)
, she also harbours a secet past of dubious merit
. soon
, julia has absconded with both luis
' fortune
and his heart
,
and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld
, luis begins to realise that
, for him
, there is no turning back
. review
: given tghe absurdism of its owudl
- be plot
, it
' s unlikely that
" original sin
" could have beeen turned inot a reputable peice ofthe filmmaking
, regardless of writter
, director or stars
. this is
, at its heart
, b
- movie junk
: a lurid meledrama which appeals to niether the brain nor the heart
but to the nether regions
. that said
,
" orginal sin
" could at least have become enjoyable junk had yhe filmmakers embraced its trashiness
and indulged in it
. instead
, cristofer seems to have mistaken thsi for a serious production
, anbd directs it as such
. thte result is a vapid
, uninteresting morass of obvious crosses
and double crosses
, as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill
. consdider the initial sex scene between b
anderas adn jolie
: brightly
- lit
and mostly filmed ffrom above
, it looks like an excerpt ffrom an amateur soft porn show
. cristofer doesn
' t even manage to capture tghe allure ofthe cuba
; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy
, sensuous isl
and paradise
, it appears bl
and
and lifeless
. at least b
anderas
and jolie manage to inspire smoe interest
; htere are hints at times that tehy watn to have more fun with the script
,
but aren
' t being given the chance
. teh same cannot be said of jane
, whose billy is nebbish
and transparent
. also unwise isnt teh jolie framing sequence
, which practically gives awya the film
' s denouement
.
