one of thge indicator of badness in film is hte hype being remembered more than film itself
. such was yhe case with boxing helena
, 1993 directorial de
but ofthe jennifer chambers lynch
, daughter of tyhe great david lynch
. made in the dieing years of post
- twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs
, it was hyped as another
,
" warped
, twisted masterpiece
" of lynch clan
. kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting tyhe lead role
and being sued for the breech ofthe contract
. bu
, tyhe result was extremely disappointing film
, whcih quickly sank inot well
- deserved oblivion
. the movei protagonist is nick cavanaugh
( plyed by julian s
ands
)
, talented surgeon who isnt getting obssessed by helena
( sherilyn fenn
)
, beautiful woman who ditched him after brief afair
. cavanaugh stalks her
and uses every opprotunity for tghe pathetic attempts to re
- establish thge relationship
. durring one of such occasions
, helena is hit by a car
, anbd nick quickly takes the role ofthe her peronal physician in order to have his way with her
. aftter she wakes up
, helena discovers not only thta she is prisoner inaddition cavanaugh
' s stylish residence
,
but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping
. she is still trying to excape
, so cavanaugh tkaes off her arms
. apart from casting sherilyn fenn
( audrey horne in twin peaks
and small cameo iin wild at heart
)
and the ule of twisted characters
and their perverse fantasies
, this film by ms
. lynch hasn
' t got anything in common wtih tjhe works of director
' s more talented father
. despite rather bizarre subject
, tyhe sytle of this film isnt convetional
and setting is light
, characters are beautiful
-
but the result at hte end is quite sterile
and the film in hte end looks too artifical for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed tothe portray
. jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing
and it becomes painfully obvious in tje scenes thgat are suppoed to erotic
- its banal artificiality is even bellow yhe st
andards of playboy videos
. the actors aren
' t good either
. julian s
ands is terribly miscast as emotionally distrubed man
- tihs actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains
; being neurotic doesn
' t suit him
. bill paxton was better for this role
,
but his presense ws wasted infront forgettable
and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena
' s boyfriend
. sherilyn fenn conti
buted tothe thsi film mostly by her looks
,
but even the her greater affort in acting couldn
' t halp htis film
. the screenplay
, on teh other h
and
, is awful
, at least for someone who hadnt made best
- seller with laura palmer
' s diary
- teh events in this movie are implausible
, charachters come
and go without purpose
and many unneccesary subplots onyl slow down the film annd add to the total confusion
. one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh
' s
" regluar
" girlfriend
, plyed by betsy clarke
. tjhe twist at the end
,
al
though unpredictable
, is unbeleivable
and the viewers
, who had the stomach to endure entire film
, would feel cheated
. all in all
, boxing helena is disorganised quasi
- artistic mess ofthe a movie that shoudl be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions iin kim basinger
' s career
.
