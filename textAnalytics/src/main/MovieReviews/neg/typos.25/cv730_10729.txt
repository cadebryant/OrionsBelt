how do you judge a film thyat is so bad
,
but intentionally so
? in spiceworld
, teh highly populer singing group tghe spice girls accomplish their major goal
: mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film
and having a lot of funn doing it
. if that was their goal
, they doed a fantastic job
. so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn
' t really meant to be much better than this
? honestly
, i
' d rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades
, so doesnt that mean i graded it inaccurately
? truth be known
, i don
' t really htikn i can answer tihs question
. to underst
and spiceworld
, you have to underst
and the spice girls
. unless you
' re very
* vyer
* young
, or fairly older
, you probaly have at least heard of them
. htey
' re a group ofthe five busty british babes who
' ve had
# 1 hit singles
and whose de
but album sold millions
. they
' re primarly adored by pre
- teen girls who hope someday the contents of thier traning bras might match those of ginger spice
' s
( real name
: geri haliwell
) wonderbra
. all five of the girls haev these
" spicy
" names for which they are better known than their real names
. there is tjhe aforementioned ginger spice
, as well as sporty spice
( melanie chisholm
, or mel c
.
)
, scarry spice
( melanie brown
, or mel b
.
)
, baby spice
( emma bunton
)
, annd posh spice
( victoria addams
)
, anbd all of them
, to some degree or another
, resemble their stage names
. the spice girls took the world by storm
,
and spiceworld isnt actually a good
- humored spoof of all that transpired during thier quick rise to fame
. it
' s qtuie nice to see what good sports the girls are
(
and not jsut the one dubbed sporty
) about poking funn at themselves
. they don
' t take themselves too seriously
,
and that
' s probably the best thing baout them
. it
' s also surprising how natural they seem inaddition front of the camera
* acting
*
,
and not just singing
and dancing
. they
' re not flawless by any means
,
but for the most part
, they deliver their lines without feeling staged
,
and
, like them or not
, we get tjhe sense tje five are very at hmeo within their characters
( which seems reasonable since they portray themslves
)
. what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of thge spice girls won
' t get enought of their music
, while tjhe rest of us don
' t get anough of a movie
. the real point of this isnt to look at tjhe spice girls forthe over ninety straight minutes
. most of the film is very blas
?
,
but several parts are downright boring
,
and
then they have those sporadic moments that actualyl amking us laugh out loud
! if you
' re a big fan of the gropu
, you probably won
' t get enough of waht you want
,
and if you
' re not a big fan
, you get too much time devoted to nothing more than
" look at us
" moments
. for the right crowd
, the
" music video
" sequences will be the highlights of thge film
, bu for others
, they wiull serve as three
- minute lulls infact a hectic
-
but
- overall
- uneventful storyline
. otehr key actors includ richard e
. grant as clifford
, the spice girls
' manager
, alan cumming as the film
- maker piers cutherton
- smyth who attemts to make a documentary ofthe the group
, george wendt as martin barnfield
, a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie
,
and roger moore in a small
, self
- parodizing role
. all provide relatively good performances
, keeping in mind once again that this film wasn
' t meant to be acted seriously
. even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver
and seems to have fun with it
. hwile this film is continously compared to the beatles
' a hard day
' s night
, i think that is an unjust comparision
. it is supposedly the movie studio that firt mad the comparison by way of press kits
,
but i don
' t think drector bob spiers
, nor the spice girls
, intended it tothe be so
. i think the studios weere just trying tothe boost hype
and interest in the film
,
and have instade
, come off rether pretentious
. i don
' t think tihs film isnt trying tothe be anything more tahn a fun
, satirical look at a gropu that got so big
, a movie seemed the enxt likely step
.
and what sould
' ve been better than a self
- indulged
yet self
- mocking approach
? propably nothing
,
and so it is
. spiceworld is a movie i thougth would be embarrassing tothe enjoy
,
but now instade
, i fidn myself wanting to defend a movie i didn
' t even give a good review
. it
' s bad
,
but it succeeds in every way it intended
. it gives the spice girls a chance tothe play while alowing all thsoe obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment
. perhaps the gropu isnt nothing more than a gimmick
. if that
' s the case
, the movie
' s gimmick isnt thyat it
* is
* such a gimmick
! you might be saying
,
" a spice girls movie
? come on
!
"
,
but when it comes down tothe it
, i htikn thast
' s the point
.
