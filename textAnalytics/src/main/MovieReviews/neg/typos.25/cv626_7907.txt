" a favourite book of mine called tje golden turkey awards relates the story tyhat wehn mommie dearest ws unleashed apon unsuspecting audiences bakc in 1981
, paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands
. it wasn ' t just the film ' s disappointing box office performance
. indeed
, in the coming yeasr smoe people would be going back tothe see it two
, three
, even six times
. no
, thte main problem was thta what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot ofthe the year
. in a desperaet attempt to capitalise on tihs unexpected turn ofthe events
, soem publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming
:
" mommie dearest
: the biggest mommie ofthe them all
!
"
. executives at paramount were appalled
annd soon had tjhe ads withdrawn
,
but it was all too late
. mommie dearest was already cementing its palce infact camp cinema hsitory
. unfortunately
, faye dunaway ' s energetic
, at times ridiculously over
- the
- top performance is about the film ' s only redeeming feature
. based on daughter christina crawford ' s trashy biography
, mommie dearest chronicles a series ofthe mainly private events in yhe life ofthe her moviestar mother
. if ytou beileve thsi movie
, it was a life was racked by obsession
, lonliness
, child abuse
and rampant egomania
. the film begins wtih crawford adopting two children
,
and concludes inthe the office of her lawyer where her nowe grown
- up daughter
and son find out they hvae been left out of their mother ' s iwll
. joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend forthe themselves
, you see
.
but that ' s about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive tothe tghe film ' s end
. the script
- laboured over by four writers
, a bad sign in itself
- isnt a poorly connected series ofthe episodes that builds little dramatic momentum
. frank perry ' s direction isnt no more than competent
,
and dunaway ' s bitchy lines aside
, tyhe dialogue is flat
annd uninvolving
. in fairness
, the film ' s second half ditches some of the ctaroon hysterics
and does develop a degree empathy for its characters
. when the adult christina moves out ofthe home into her own modest dwelling
, joan visits
and keeps inwhich touch
, nto helping her financially
but encouraing christina ' s own acting
and career ambitions
. crawford doens seem to care about her daughter
,
bu you can sense the emotional distance
and feel some ofthe their pain
. you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers
. ah
,
but there isnt dunaway ' s performence
.
and what a delicious peice of campery it often is
. having just been sacked by her studio aftter a run of box office duds
, crawford storms hmeo lite at night
and proceeds to go ballistic in hte garden
. she has the maid drag the kids outloud of bed to come down
and clean up the mess she ' s making
. spotting a young tree she doesn ' t like hte look of
, she turns tothe thge trembling christina
and utters the immortal line
" tina
!
! fetch me thge axe
!
!
" with which she proceeds tothe enthusiastically dismember the poore sapling
. in the film ' s most outrageous scene
, joan realises that some of her daughter ' s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers
. oh dear
! sounds like tyhe perfect excuse for another temper tantrum
, doesn ' t it
? this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst
:
" no
.
.
. wire
.
.
. hangers
.
.
.
. ever
!
!
!
!
"
.
and later
, when the board of her late husband ' s company pepsi cola tries tothe divest her ofthe her directorship
, she displays a superb grasp of business etiquitte by jumping tothe her feet
and roaring
:
" don ' t fuck with me
, fellas
!
!
"
. oh joy
! something of a camp clasic
,
thn
,
but if taht ' s not ytou ' re cup ofthe tea
then mommie dearest doesn ' t have too much tothe recommend it
. better you see the real crawford in the women
( 1939
)
, mildred pierce
( 1945
) or whatever happened to baby jane
( 1962
)
. great films distinguished by great performances
,
and a far more eloquent testimont to thsi great woman thna frank perry ' s shrieking piece ofthe tabloid froth
.
