" a favourite book ofthe mine called thge golden tukey awards relates the stroy that when mommie dearest was unleashed apon unsuspecting audiences bcak in 1981
, paramount soon realised they had a probelm on their h
ands
. it wasn
' t jsut the film
' s disapointing box office performance
. indeed
, in tje comming years some people would be going back to see it two
, threee
, even six times
. noone
, thte main problem was tyhat what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford wass turning inot the laugh riot of tjhe year
. in a desperate attemt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events
, some publicity hacks dreamed uv outrageous print advertisements screaming
:
" mommie dearest
: yhe biggest mommie of them all
!
"
. executives at paramount were appalled
and soon had the ads withdrawn
,
but it was all too late
. mommie dearest ws already cementing its place inwhich camp cinema history
. unfortunately
, faye dunaway
' s energetic
, at times ridiculously over
- the
- top performance is baout tyhe film
' s only redeeming feature
. based onthe daughter christina crawford
' s trashy biography
, mommie dearest chronicles a series ofthe mailny private events in tghe life ofthe her moviestar mother
. if ytou believe tihs movei
, it was a life was racked by obsession
, lonliness
, child abuse
and rampant egomania
. the film begins with crawford adopting two childrens
,
and concludes iin the office of her lawyer where her now grown
- up daugher annd son find out they have been left out ofthe their mother
' s will
. joan always wnated her kids to be able tothe fend fo themselfs
, you see
.
but thast
' s baout the only thread infact hte narrative that manages to survive to thge film
' s end
. the script
- laboured over by four writers
, a bad sign inwhich itself
- isnt a poorly connected serieses of episodes that builds littel dramatic momentum
. frank perry
' s direction is no more than competent
,
and dunaway
' s bitchy lines aside
, the dialogue is flat adn uninvolving
. in fairness
, the film
' s second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics
and does develop a degree empathy fo its characters
. when the adult christina moves outloud of home into her own modest dwelling
, joan visits
and keeps in touch
, not helping her financially
but encouraging christina
' s own acting
and carreer ambitions
. crawford does seem to care about her daughter
, bu you can sense tyhe emotional distance
and efel soem ofthe theri pain
. you also get glimpses of what the film coudl have been in thte h
ands of better writers
. ah
,
but ther isnt dunaway
' s peformance
. anbd what a delicious piece of campery it oftenly isnt
. having just beeen sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds
, crawford storms home late at night
and proceeds tothe go ballistic in tjhe garden
. she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to cmo down
and clean up the mess she
' s making
. spotting a young tree she doesn
' t like thge look of
, she turns to the trembling christina adn utters the immortal line
" tina
!
! fetch me the axe
!
!
" with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling
. in the film
' s most outrageous scene
, joan realises that some of her daugher
' s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers
. oh dear
! soudns like hte perfect excuse fo anyother temper tantrum
, doesn
' t it
? this time she gives her duaghter a horrible beating hwile delivering another classic outburst
:
" no
.
.
. wire
.
.
. hangers
.
.
.
. ever
!
!
!
!
"
.
and later
, when yhe board of her lite husb
and
' s company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship
, she displays a superb grasp ofthe business etiquette by jumping tothe her fezent
and roaring
:
" don
' t fuck with me
, fellas
!
!
"
. oh joy
! something ofthe a camp clasic
,
then
,
but if that
' s not you
' re cup ofthe tea
then mommie dearest doesn
' t have too much to reccomend it
. better you see the real crawford in the women
( 1939
)
, mildred pierce
( 1945
) or whatever happened tothe baby jane
( 1962
)
. great films distingquished by great performances
, anbd a far mroe eloquent testament to htis great woman than frank perry
' s shrieking piece of tabloid froth
.
