when you
' ve run out of ood tv shows to turn into movies
, i guess you try video games
. why doed i go to see mortal kombat
: annihilation
? the quest tothe seek an answer tothe thsi query may prove a better movie that thge oen i jstu saw
. this film was a bunch of fighting
, yelling
, special effects
,
and bad acting setted to an oppressive techno music sountrack
. the plot is fairly simple
: a portal has opened vetween our world
and the
" outworld
"
, allowing evil forces comm
anded by shao kahn
( brian thompson
) to wreak havoc
and attempt to destroy humanity
. teh good guys
, led by sorcerer rayden
( james remar
)
and human mortal liu kang
( robin shou
)
, must tkae the fight to outworld
, where teh fate of both worlds will be determined
. here
' s the catch
: they must reunite princess katana
( talia soto
)
, who
' s onthe thge good side
, with her resurrected mother queen sindel
( musetta v
ander
)
, who
' s on the bad side
, for thier lvoe for each other will close the portal annd ensure humanity
' s safety for anyother generation
. how this is supposed tothe work
, i still have no idea
,
but i liekd katana
' s line
,
" i knew lveo would keep us toghether
,
" since thyat captain
and tennille song ran through my head
and i got a ogod laugh
. there are some seriously stupid thigns infact this movie
. take
, for exmaple
, a transportation system whlch utilizes the
" inner winds
"
, generated by earth
' s magma flows
. you get in this metal ball which transports yuo thru undreground tunnels really fast
. how fast
? as katana says
,
" you will be moving so fast
, it will be as if you are not moving at all
.
" whta
? later
, sonya blade
( s
andra hess
) goes to find jax
( lynn
" red
" williams
, otherwise known as
" saber
" onthe tv
' s american gladiators
) at a medical research facility on the isl
and of oahu
. how dont we know this is where she went
? there
' s a sign onthe the facility
' s perimeter fence that reads
: medical research facility
- oahu
, hawaii
. remember
, this is not a caption
,
but an actuall sign
. i guess the location is onthe there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are
. there
' s a lot ofthe major flipping acation
, too
. the first encounter between good anbd evil shows kahn anbd rayden swiftly arching
though the air toward oen another
. do they l
and
and immediatley git inot the fighting
? does oney of them l
and frist adn catch the otehr off guard
? do tehy collide in mid
- air
? noone
, aparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having tothe yell ffrom far away
. why did they ened those metal balls to travel
? everyone could have jsut flipped from point a to point b
. i have to admit
, the fight scenes are pretty good
,
al
though you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects adn fly wires
, alowing the characters to surpass the limits of tjhe human body
and the laws of physics
. the movie
' s thrills are derived from these scenes
and most of yhe audience responses are on tyhe visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly
.
" ouch
" wass the most common expletive heard when i screened this one
. you could tell that tyhe filmmakers knew in advance that fights
, nto plot
, owudl be the main draw
, since dialouge is apparently inthe thte film just to git from oney fight to the next
. it seems that
' s all there is in this movie
. maybe it isnt
. as i hadnt mentioned
, the acting isnt bad
. there
' s not noe solid performance iin yhe film
,
al
though williams as jax was pretty funny
. affter a fight between sonya
and oen of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling
, jax says
,
" you look ogod in mud
. no
, realyl
, you do
.
" remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously
,
and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang
. brian thompson
, who hasnt played good guys
, bad guys
,
and even an alien on tv
' s the x
- files
, bu always some muscle
- bound behemoth
, isnt your average evil demi
- god
,
but it
' s mroe the script
' s fault than his own that he doesn
' t have anything orginial tothe say
. tje one really impressive thing about this movei isnt tath ther is not one swear word in hte whole hour
and a half
. another thign which should be noted is taht for all its punching
and kicking
, blood only appears in one scene
. all in all
, mortal kombat
: annihilation is loud
, violent
, shallow
,
and marketed toward kids
. hey
, jstu liek teh video gam
!
