" some houses are born bad
,
" goes the haunting ' s tag line
, tothe whlch i must add
,
" some movies
, too
.
" nothing short of hiring a new cast
, a more literate screenwriter
,
and a newyorker director coudl hvea saved this tragically misguided adaption ofthe jackson ' s meritorious novel
. the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy
,
and its seamingly endless stream of digital trickery
and spooky ooky sound effects don ' t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission
- tghe film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout
" boo
.
" fragel nell
( taylor
)
, bisexual theo
( zeta
- jones
)
,
and smiley luke
( wilson
) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly posessed hill hous for an extended study onthe sleep disorders
, hosted by professor marrow
( neeson
)
. marrow ' s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house ' s bleak history
. he ' s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew
, nell especially
, who has soem ancestral connection tothe the manor ' s previous inhabitans
. taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big
- budget lead
. forthe starters
, her consistently dour expression sucks tghe life out of even the early scenes
, when we ' re introduced to tghe mension
and all its fun
- house trappings
. her character is supposed to be depressed
, having tended to an unloving mother for too many years
,
but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame
, alternately grouchy
, mopey
, wiggy
and pathetic
,
and i kept wondering why tjhe other charachters didn ' t just ditch this bitch
. as for the obscenely photogenic zeta
- jones
, she breezes through her scenes with a wink
and a smile
annd takes the scenery with her
. unfortunately
, she ' s saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue hte screenplay has to offer
. theo ' s assessment of the house
?
" i lveo it
! sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters
.
" who on earth would say tht in place of
" citizen kane meets the munsters
"
?
( furthermore
, would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting thta description
?
) both actresses fare better than neeson
, who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble
(
and for good reason
)
,
and his chracter is the most bland
. as luke puts it
, dr
. marrow pulls the ood
" academic bait
and switch
" on his subjects
,
bu he breaks down
and confesses tothe this the second he ' s accused
. later
, he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell
( it ' s amusing to hear neeson shout
" nell
" repeatedly
, given his starring role inthe the 1994 jodie foster vehicule of the same name
)
. why was this nice
, helpful
,
adn redemptive researcher so absent ofthe ethics at the start
? the haunting was well dessigned by eugenio zanetti
. his sets are obsessively detailed
,
and even before thge cgi kicks in
, they seem alive
, never quite still
. i dont hvea one beef with this aspect ofthe the production
: the real life mansion used in exterior shots
, nottinghamshire ' s harlaxton manor
, is so vast that one has trouble beleiving that nell
and company
, no matter how much running away tehy dont from ghosts
and goblins
, always finish up in locations that were established in act oney
, as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house
. eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting
,
anbd dispite a powerhouse box office debut
, i doubt it will recoupe its costs
( incuding marketting
) domestically
. thank jan de bont for thgat
: proving for thte third time that speed was a fluke
, in that it was accually enjoyable
, de bont has served up another ride
, sans thrill
. his images
, well
- lit
though they are
, have an unmistakable beeen there
- done that quality
; inthe fact
, whole sequences
, nto tothe mention the cloaked
, airy ghoul who owns the climax
, feel lifted from a much smarter
and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from threee summers back
, peter jackson ' s the frighteners
. i don ' t mean tothe suggest de bont is a plagiarist
, i mean to suggest that he ' s a hack
, having found no new ways tothe give us chills
.
