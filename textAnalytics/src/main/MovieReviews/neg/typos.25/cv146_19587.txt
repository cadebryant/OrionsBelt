" some houses are born bad
,
" goes the haunting
' s tag line
, to whitch i must add
,
" some movies
, too
.
" nothing short of hiring a new casted
, a more literate screenwriter
,
and a new directer sould have saved this tragically misguided adaption ofthe jackson
' s meritorious novel
. the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick tothe be creepy
, adn its seamingly endless stream ofthe digital trickery
and spooky ooky sound effects don
' t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission
- the film isnt like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout
" boo

" fragile nell
( taylor
)
, bisexual theo
( zeta
- jones
)
,
and smiley luke
( wilson
) are three insomniacs who gather at hte reputedly possessed hill hous for an extended study on sleep disorders
, hosted by professor marrow
( neeson
)
. marrow
' s secretly gathering data onthe theri respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house
' s obleek history
. he
' s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize thte crew
, nell especially
, who has some ancsetral connection to the manor
' s previous inhabitants
. taylor isnt thoroughly insufferable in her first big
- budget lead
. for starters
, her consistently dour expression sucks the life out ofthe even the early scenes
, when we
' re introduced to the mansion
and all its funn
- hous trappings
. her character is supposed tothe be depressed
, hvaing tended tothe an unloving mother for too many years
,
but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame
, alternately grouchy
, mopey
, wiggy
and pathetic
,
and i kept wondering why tje other characters didn
' t jsut ditch this bitch
. as for the obscenely photogenic zeta
- jones
, she breezes through her scenes with a wink
and a smile
and takes the scenery with her
. unfortunately
, she
' s saddled with some ofthe tyhe most unlikely dialogue tghe screenplay has to offer
. theo
' s assessment of the house
?
" i love it
! sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters
.
" who on earth would sday thast in place of
" citizen kane meets the munsters
"
?
( furthermore
, would ytou gladly spend a single night in a hous befitting that description
?
) both actresses fare better than neeson
, who looks embarrassed to be a part of tihs ensemble
(
and for good reason
)
,
and his character is the most bl
and
. as luke puts it
, dr
. marrow pulls the ood
" academic bait
and switch
" on his subjects
,
but he breaks down
and confesses to this the second he
' s accused
. later
, he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to sive nell
( it
' s amusing to hear neeson shout
" nell
" repeatedly
, given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same nmae
)
. why wass this nice
, helpful
, anbd redemptive researcher so absent ofthe ethics at tghe start
? the haunting ws well designed by eugenio zanetti
. his sets are obsessively detailed
,
and even befoer the cgi kicks in
, they seem alive
, never qutie still
. i do have one beef withthe this aspect ofthe the production
: the rela life mension used in exterior shots
, nottinghamshire
' s harlaxton manor
, isnt so vast that one has trouble believing that nell adn company
, no matter how much running away tehy do from ghosts
and goblins
, always finish up inaddition locations that weere established in ect one
, as if all the acation has beeen confined to oen wing of hill house
. eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting
,
and dispite a powerhouse box office de
but
, i doubt it will recoup its costs
( inlcuding marketing
) domestically
. thank jan de bont for that
: proving for teh thrid time thta speed was a fluke
, in that it was actually enjoyable
, de bont has served up another ride
, sans thrill
. his images
, well
- lit
though they are
, ahev an unmistakable been htere
- done thast qualtiy
; in fact
, whole sequences
, not tothe mention the cloaked
, airy ghoul who owns the climax
, feel lifted from a much smarter
and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from threee summers back
, peter jackson
' s the frighteners
. i don
' t mean tothe suggest de bont is a plagiarist
, i mean to suggest that he
' s a hack
, having foudn noone new ways tothe give us chills
.
