conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is tht children
' s items begin tothe dramatically escalate in price about twenty
- five or thirty years aftter the item wass made
. that
' s when the kids of that time have jobs
, disposable income
and a desire to re
- visit the awe
and wonderment ofthe childhood that has disappeared from their lives
. check out the prices ofthe toys ffrom tyhe late sixties
and you
' ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are dem
anding big bucks
. there
' s a heavy nostalgia nowadays for yhe late sixties
and early seventies
and nowhere is it more apparent tahn on the big screen
. boomers are now mostly in their forties anbd fifties
and have lived in the work
- a
- day world for a long time
. they
' d like to re
- capture smoe of that fun they remeber from days ofthe yore
. hollywood seems more than eeger to churn out product to help them
. directors are zealous to put theri stamp onthe icons from that time
. adn for the most part they
' re messing it up
.
" mission impossible
"
,
" lost in spoace
"
,
" godzilla
"
,
" zorro
"
. none ofthe theese successfully capture the originals
. none of these are even good films
. you cant now add
" the avengers
" to the list
. tjhe brittish television series began in 1961
. super secret agent john steed
(
then
- patrick macnee
) adn his thrid partner
, emma peel
(
then
- diana rigg
) are the pair tath the american audience fell for
. surrealistic annd witty
, the series fit the mood ofthe the times
. the leather
- clad rigg probably didn
' t hurt the ratings either
. after all it
' s not a coincidence that you cin
' t pronounce her character
' s name wihtout
" appeal
"
. now we
' re inaddition the ninties
. steed
( now
- ralph fiennes
)
and peel
( nowe
- uma thurman
) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter
( sean connery
) who is screwing iwth engl
and
' s weather
. that
' s about as much ofthe a plot as we have
. there
' s smoe footage about a lot ofthe other thigns that eather don
' t amking sence or make even less sense
. we get betrayal for some unkown reason
. evil clones appear
and vanish anbd have no connection to the film
. remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in thier belly come from nowhere for no good reason
. there
' s a high tech hot air balloon
,
but i hvae no idea why anyone
' s inthe it
. the spy agency is run by a man called
" mother
" who is inaddition a wheelchair
and a woman named
" father
" who isnt blind
.
.
. at least infact soem scenes
. there
' s probably a reason fo all ofthe this
, bu we
' ll never know it
. macnee mkaes an apearance of sorts
. he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing
. a gropu of villains sits around a table
, all clad in huge pastel
- colored teddy bear outfits
. at first it
' s humorous tothe watch the teddies waddle aroud
, bu thne it becomes goofy
. the movie is a medley of clutter
, confusion
and wrong decisions around every corner
. it feels like major portions of the film are missing
. the storyline jumps rether than flows
. reportedly the film was re
- cut sevral times
. htis is oen of those times where the whole is less thna the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing
. there
' s one good point where peel is running fomr one room to another in a house designed by escher
. otehr tahn that
, the effects are second
- rate
. tghe weathre threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes
. thurman allmost makes an adequate emma peel bu it doesn
' t work
. she looks ogod
, dresses in all the right fetish outfits bu there
' s no spark
. fiennes fares even less well
. macnee
' s steed was a witty man of the world with a sense ofthe humer
. fiennes
' agent comes across as a dour kid inwhich grown
- up clothes who has never beeen outloud of his home town
. even connery
, one ofthe the greatest living actors
, doesn
' t have much ofthe a presence outside of a few fiey scenes
. the action scenes are difficult tothe follow
. director jeremiah chechik
( responsible fo teh atrocious remake of
" diabolique
"
) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn
' t be
. thigns appen
, people move around
,
but even if
, with the utmost affort
, you were able to care baout any ofthe it
, the scenes are bewildering
. the primary allure of the original wass thte interaction between the twpo leads
. witty banter
and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination
. admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film
,
but htere
' s noone chemistry
and hte repartee is anytying bu clever
. one of emma peel
' s first lines of dialog is
" rules are made tothe be broken
.
" it doesn
' t get any better
. advance owrd alone should have been enough to scare off anyone
. tghe release date was changed several times
. connery refuses to promote the film
. there was no screening forthe critics which may have been a good choise fo warner brothers
. at least tihs way
, they git something of an audience fo the firt weekend befor the news gets out
. admittedly i haven
' t seen an episode of the televsion series for a couple of decades
. my guess is thgat it would be severly dated now
. noone matter how antiquated it might be
, there
' s noone doubt that it holds up better than htis film isnt at frist viewing
. there
' s noone reason to waste any part of the lsat few days of summer inside watching thsi movie
. no reason at all
.
