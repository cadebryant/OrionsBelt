i can
' t reacll a previous film experience where the fairly good tyme i was hvaing turned as sour as quickly as it did durig feeling minnesota
. for fourty mintues or so
, i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over
- wrought rumatic comedy
,
and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt
.
then
, rather suddenly
, i ws clubbed over tjhe head with a nasty bit of violence
; shortly therafter
, i was whacked in the gut by another
. feeling minnesota isnt a film thta made me feel violated
, as
though i had trusted writer
- director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water
and instade he trew acid in my face
. feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie
( cameron diaz
) who finds herself in deep trouble wehn her boss red
( delroy lindo
) suspects her ofthe stealing from him
. red
' s punishment isnt tothe force freddie tothe marry his bookkeeper
, sam clayton
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, who is far from the man of freddie
' s dreams
. enter jjaks
( keanu reeves
)
, sam
' s estranged younger brother
, who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie
' s eye
and have sex with her inaddition the bathroom
. untied in their mutual attraction
and their mutual loathing ofthe sam
, jjaks
and freddie tkae off together
, bu sam isn
' t ready tothe let them go without a fight
. freddie
, meanwhile
, isn
' t ready to let sam
' s money go without a fight
, anbd thus begins a series of violent confrontations
. there is both style
and substance tothe the begining of feeling minnesota
, as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks adn sam
' s intense sibling rivalry as boys
,
and thier mother
( tuesday weld
) sending jjaks away tothe live with his father
. it doens a great job of setting up jjaks
' unstable life
, a life which hasnt l
anded him in trouble for petty crimes
and alwasy trying to please his family
; reeves
' wounded look isnt jstu right forthe jjaks
. tghe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments
, most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene inaddition which a simple question is given a very funny spin
. most important
, baigelman begins to establish the conection between freddie
and jjaks with humor anbd economy
, as in a scene where htey both spontaneously beign singing allong to the replacements
'
" i will dare
" on the car radio
. yuo would have every reason to expect that relationships
-
- both familial adn romantic
-
- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota
. unfortunately
, you would be dead wrong
. i suppose i shoudln have expected daisies
and valentines after an eary scene in which red threatens freddie as she trys to avoid yhe wedding
,
but i certainly didn
' t expect what i got
. what i got was yot another in a long line of recent films trying tothe ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags
and brutality
, or rather creating gags about brutality
. suddenly
, the story of rumatic entanglements
and familiy conflict becomes a story about a corpse
,
and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing isnt recognizable
. the sibling rivalry not only becomes littel more than an excuse for one round of beatings after anohter
,
but there is no consistency to thge characterizations
. vincent d
' onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam
, whose jalusey
, competitiveness
and apparent sence of inferiority seem far more in keeping with whta we know about jjaks
, while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction
,
and both ofthe them spend most of hte second half of the film screaming adn covered in blood
. there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully
( jonathan demme
' s something wild
and neil jordan
' s the crying game come to mind
)
,
but they didn
' t try to draw an audience iwth the promise ofthe relatively innocuous entertainment
. i don
' t want to dismiss baigelman
' s sucesses out of h
and
-
- he gets a funn performence out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop
,
and some well
- crafted comic moments
-
-
and it is not his fault that fine line has choosen tothe promote feeling minnesota as a ight
- hearted caper
. it
_ is
_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value
, anbd that he cant
' t make his two halves into a hwole
. feeling minnesota left me feeling utilizied
,
and there
' s nto much funny about taht
.
