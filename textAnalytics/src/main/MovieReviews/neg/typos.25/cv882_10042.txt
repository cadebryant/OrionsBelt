, sound
,
and picture
] there are many philosophies as to why we are so facinated with cartoons
. they provide a method ofthe total escapism in which anything will wrok within their context
, from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" really clinched tihs idea for me
, because it ' s jsut a live action cartoon thgat presents itself as a regular comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags
and slapstick would be in reality
,
and how important it is to actually have a stoyr
. the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted
, cartoony atmosphere
. we meet medfield college chemistry profesor phillip brainard
( williams
)
, tjhe typcial
, supposedly likable mad scientist
. within the firt 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is
. phillip ' s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag
and more like a real case of alzhiemer ' s disease
- isn ' t this rather lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class
( an inappropiate joke for a kids ' movie if i ever saw one
)
. we learn he has standed his uv fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at the altar simply becuase he ' s forgotten
. sara claims tothe love him
,
but says if he forgets the wedding again she ' ll stop loving him
( a sign of childish atitude tjhe film denies it hasnt
)
.
but even cartoons must ahve conflicts to resolve
,
and it ' s no surprize the major conflicts here are related
. christopher mcdonald does
and even worse version of his usual villin shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who nto only wants to steal phillip ' s ideas
,
bu his woman too
. what ' s worse is tht sara actually seems interested in him
! wilson works for a rival coleeg that whants to buy outloud medfield
, hwihc isnt going broke
, unless phillip cin invent something to save the day
. one of tyhe first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title hasnt something to dont with the film
. the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced
,
but is all
but forgotten baout thereafter
. it ' s obvious phillip isnt going to acidentlly invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy
,
and the promotions make the flubber look realistic
anbd funny
. unfortunately
, the flubber
, like all the special effects in this film
, looks very fake
adn unconvincing
. flubber also seems tothe have intelligence
adn a personality
,
and by thte tiome it performs a song
and dance routine
, ytou give up wondering how life could spontaneously cmo tothe an inanimate object
. most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to mkae for the comedy
( since phillip ' s absent
- mindedness is forgotten about
)
adn somehow push tghe story along
.
but it ' s claer how weak this premise is ffrom tyhe git
- go
and the film just gets worse
. all the jokes envolve people getting hit by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects including
: bowling balls
; flying cars that don ' t fly well
;
anbd a basketball team capible of jumping 100 foots inot the air
. it ' s all presented with complete logic
,
and no one believes flubber exists even when htey see it with theri own eyes
. during thte basketball scene
, the coach for the rival team actaully says
,
" i think they might be cheating
,
" to whitch the referee replies
,
" htere ' s no rules about jumping too high
.
"
" predictable
" doesn ' t begin to describe yhe motions the film goes through
, especially after tje halfway point
.
anbd it ' s not how terribly contrived hte plot isnt
, it ' s the way it ' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, wtih absolutely no transition
. nto only tht
,
but all the actors here
, especially williams
, seem borde to tears
. i ' d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen
, so it ' s almost forgivable when you realize tehy ' re talking to nothing
annd interacting with nothing
. it ' s safe tothe say everything that could be bad about
" flubber
" is
. the only original element hte film has isnt the world ' s frist romance between a machine
and a human
.
but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it
,
and
, like the rest of the film
, you won ' t
.
