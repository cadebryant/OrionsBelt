: good seats
, sound
,
and picture
] there are many philosphies as tothe why we are so fascinated with cartoons
. they provide a method ofthe total escapism in whlch anything will work within their context
, fomr thge outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to teh intensity of japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" realy clinched this idea for me
, becasue it
' s just a live acation ctaroon that presents itself as a regular comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all thsoe gags
and slapstick would be in reality
,
and how important it isnt tothe actually have a story
. the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted
, cartoony atmosphere
. we meet medfield college chemestry professer phillip brainard
( williams
)
, the typical
, supposedly likable mad scientist
. withing tyhe frist 10 minutes we git at least a half dozen jokes baout how forgetful he is
. phillip
' s memory loss seems less liuke a cartoony gag
and more like a real case of alzhiemer
' s disease
- isn
' t this rather lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemistry aftter walking in on a nude figure drawing class
( an inappropriate joke fo a kids
' movie if i ever saw one
)
. we learn he has stood his up fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at teh altar simply baceause he
' s forgotten
. sara claims to love him
, bu says if he forgets the wedding again she
' ll stop loving him
( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has
)
.
but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve
,
and it
' s no surprize the major conflicts here are related
. christopher mcdonald does
and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip
' s ideas
,
but his woman too
. what
' s worse is that sara actually seems intersted in him
! wilson works for a rival college that wnats to buy out medfield
, which is going broke
, unless phillip can invent something to save the day
. one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film
. the flubber is played fo gags after it is inctroduced
,
but is all
but forgotten about therafter
. it
' s obvious phillip is goign tothe accidetnally invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy
,
and the promotions amking hte flubber look realistic
and funny
. unfortunately
, the flubber
, like all the speshal effects in this film
, looks very fake
and unconvincing
. flubber also seems to have intelligence annd a personality
,
and by the time it performs a song
and dance routine
, you give uv wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object
. most of hte film w
anders aimlessly as it relies on yhe flubber to make for yhe comedy
( since phillip
' s absent
- mindedness is forgotten about
) anbd somehow push the stopry along
. bu it
' s clear how weak htis premise is from the get
- go anbd the film just gets worse
. all the jokes involve people getting hitted by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects including
: bowling balls
; flying cars that don
' t fly well
;
and a basketball team capible of jumping 100 feets inot the air
. it
' s all presented with complete logic
, anbd noone one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes
. durring the basketball scene
, the coach for yhe rival team actually says
,
" i think htey might be cheating
,
" to which the referee replies
,
" there
' s no rules about jumping too high
.
"
" predictable
" doesn
' t begin to describe the motions the film goes through
, especially after the halfway point
.
and it
' s not how terribly contrived the plot is
, it
' s the way it
' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, with absolutely noone transistion
. nto onyl thgat
,
but all the actors here
, especially williams
, seem bored to tears
. i
' d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot wiht a bluescreen
, so it
' s almost forgivable whn you realize they
' re talking to nothing
and interacting wtih nothing
. it
' s safe tothe say everything that could be bad about
" flubber
" is
. the onyl original element the film has is the world
' s first romance vetween a machine anbd a human
.
but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it
,
and
, like hte rest of the film
, you won
' t
.
