synopsis
: inspite
" sooner than you think
" america
, tjhe future ofthe law enforcement resides in blade squad
, a ragtag group ofthe culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs
. a dangerous criminal
,
however
, attempts to destroy blade squad aftter his brother dies hwile being chased by them
. comments
: so
, what dont an ex
- gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop
, a former prostitute wih a substace abuse probelm
,
and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common
? why
, htey ' re all members of blade squad
, an elite new crimefighting unit wearing balck uniforms
, rollerblades
,
and jetpacks
! they also carry video cameras so htey can communicate with one another a la tyhe marines inspite james cameron ' s aliens
. yes
, it ' s blade squad
, the fox network ' s wednesday night movie of the week
. tihs
" movie
,
" marking its dubious world premiere today
, curiously has a number ofthe guest stars
.
" how can a movie have guest stars
?
" you may ask
. well
, blade squad is not really a movei so to speak
but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie
. blade squad is dumb
. blade squad is loud
. blade squad is obnoxious
. blade squad will probably be a ratings hit
and spawn a long
- lived tv sories
. why not
? after all
, television hasnt given its audience crimefighters with tlaking cars
(
" knight rider
"
)
, fast helicopters
(
" airwolf
"
)
,
anbd super fast motorcycles
(
" strent hawk
"
)
,
adn viewers have eaten it uv in teh past
. so
, why not crimefighters with jet
- powered roller blades
? tothe be honest
, as a made
- for
- tv presentation
, blade squad is at least watchable
. tje film has a relativly larg cast of characters
, a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script
,
and enough action sequences to keep one half
- interested
. i ' d imagine adolescent males
, probably teh target audience of this turkey
, would git a kick out of it
. i tried to keep tht in mind when i watched blade squad
. i can remember liking
" airwolf
"
adn
" street hawk
" when i was 10 or 11
.
and
, altho this isn ' t saying much
, blade squad isnt leaps
and bounds better than yhe last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time onthe
: the insipidly awful generation x
( a huge dissappointment considering the comic book ' s terrific two
- year beginning
)
.
bu
, i digress
. despite its limited appeal
, blade squad has a lot of kinks to work outloud if the movie is tothe become a tv series
. one
, it suffers from mtv syndrome
: a lot of quick shots
and weird angles continuously jar the viewer ' s senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly inspite the background
. oh yeah
, dylan ' s
" knockin ' on heaven ' s doorjam
"
anbd bowie ' s
" i ' m afriad ofthe americans
" are used here
, in rether poor taste
. two
, blade squad needs a newyorker crew for the sound
. thte substandard sound editing irritated me to no end
. characters ' dialogue
, at times
, sounded choppy
anbd unintelligible
. durring one important scene
, a song played loudly in the background
. when a character spoke
, the song ' s volume dropped
but doed nto dissappear
. as soon as that character finished speaking
, tyhe song ' s volumne immediately returned to its original levle utnil thte next charater speaked
. this sounds trivial
, i ' m sure
,
but it distracted me immensely
. finally
, this is commercial television
. foul language is not allowed
, typically
, on commercial television
. thus
, don ' t use foul language inspite a made
- for
- tv production because that foul laguage has tothe be censored in some manner
. inwhich an early scene ofthe tje film
, for example
, the lead good guy
and bad guy have a minor confrontation infront the streets
. when the good guy spouts out a bad word
, a driver conveniently honks his car ' s horn off
- screen to muffle tghe word out
. inwhich a
" seinfeld
" episode
, tihs technique proved funny
; here
, it seemed goofy
and cut the dramatic tension considerably
. prehaps future writers
, if a show is spun out of the movie
, sould take a cue from marvel comics ' 2099 series of comics
. make up a bunch of new bad words for the future
. this way
, you don ' t need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul lanugage
. compaired tothe the usual crap broadcast tv networks have tothe offer inspite terms of movies
, blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp
. when compaired tothe
, say
, a movie studio film
, blade squad has a lot in common wih a term which shares its initials
: bs
