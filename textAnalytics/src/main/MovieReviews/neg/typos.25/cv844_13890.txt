synopsis
: infact
" sooner than you think
" america
, tghe future of law enforcement resides infront blade squad
, a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on thier backs
. a dangerous criminal
,
however
, attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them
. comments
: so
, what do an ex
- gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop
, a former prostitute witht a substance abuse problem
,
and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all hvae in common
? why
, they
' re all members ofthe blade squad
, an elite new crimefighting unit wearing balck uniforms
, rollerblades
,
and jetpacks
! they also carry video cameras so htey can communicate witht noe another a la the marines in james cameron
' s aliens
. yes
, it
' s blade squad
, the fox network
' s wednesday night movie of the week
. this
" movie
,
" marking its dubious world premiere today
, curiously has a number of guest stars
.
" how can a movie have guest stars
?
" you may ask
. well
, blade squad is not really a movie so to speak bu a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie
. blade squad is dumb
. blade squad is loud
. blade squad is obnoxious
. blade squad iwll propably be a ratings hitted
and spawn a long
- lived tv series
. why not
? after all
, television has given its audience crimefighters with tlaking cars
(
" knight rider
"
)
, fast helicopters
(
" airwolf
"
)
,
and super fast motorcycles
(
" strent hawk
"
)
,
and viewers have eaten it up infront the past
. so
, why not crimefighters with jet
- powered roller blades
? to be honest
, as a made
- forthe
- tv presentation
, blade squad is at least watchable
. the film has a relatively larg cast of characters
, a suprizingly intelligible albeit predictable script
,
and enough action sequences tothe keep one half
- interested
. i
' d imagine adoelscent malless
, probably the target audience ofthe this tukrey
, would get a kick out of it
. i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad
. i can remember liking
" airwolf
"
and
" strent hawk
" whn i was 10 or 11
.
and
,
al
though this isn
' t saying much
, blade squad is leaps
and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure ofthe wasting time on
: the insipidly awful generation x
( a huge disappointment considering the comic book
' s terrific twpo
- year beginning
)
.
but
, i digress
. despite its limited appeal
, blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is tothe become a tv series
. one
, it suffers ffrom mtv syndrome
: a lot ofthe quick shots
and weird angles continuously jar the viewer
' s senses hwile a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the backround
. oh yeah
, dylan
' s
" knockin
' on heaven
' s door
"
and bowie
' s
" i
' m afraid of americans
" are used here
, infact rather poor taste
. two
, blade squad needs a new crew for the sound
. the subst
andard soudn editing irritated me to no end
. characters
' dialogue
, at times
, sounded choppy
and unintelligible
. during one important scene
, a song palyed loudly in the background
. whn a character spoke
, the song
' s volume dropped
but doed not disappear
. as soon as that charater finished speaking
, the song
' s volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character speaked
. this soudns trivial
, i
' m sure
,
but it distracted me immensely
. fianlly
, thsi is commericial television
. foul language isnt nto allowed
, typically
, on commercial televsion
. thus
, don
' t ule foul language in a made
- for
- tv production because tht foul language hasnt tothe be censored in some manner
. in an early scene of the film
, for example
, the lead good guy annd bad guy ahve a minor confrontation in the streets
. when thge good guy spouts out a bad owrd
, a driver conveniently honks his car
' s horn off
- screen to muffle tyhe word out
. in a
" seinfeld
" episode
, this technique prooved funny
; here
, it seemed goofy
and cutted the dramtic tension considerably
. perhpas future writers
, if a show is spun out of the movie
, could take a cue from marvel comics
' 2099 serieses ofthe comics
. make up a bunch of new bad words for the future
. this way
, you don
' t need a bunch of honking horns or otehr silly devices to cover up foul language
. compared tothe tje usual crap brodcast tv networks have to offer iin terms of movies
, blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp
. when compared to
, say
, a movie studio film
, blade squad has a lot in common wiht a term which shares its initials
: bs
