jessica lange isnt oen of the most inconsistent actresses working today
. from time
- to
- tiome
, she blows away audiences wiht powerful
, intense performances
. on the other h
and
, this is the same woman who made her jaw
- droppingly awful feature de
but in dino delaurentiis
' king kong
. adn
, much as lange would probably prefer movei
- goers to develope amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume
, every once inspite a while she does work that is reminiscent of it
, if only in quailty
. hush isnt one such example
. lange is so bad here tht she might ahve beeen fun to watch if tghe rest ofthe tghe film wasn
' t such a prime example ofthe motion picture tedium
. the film opens
, as many so
- called
" pyschological thrillers
" do
, by posing as a light drama
. we are introduced to jackson
( johnathon schaech
, last encounter in tom hanks
' thyat thing you do
!
)
and helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, a picture perfect young cuple who are very much inthe love
. jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she cxan meet his mother
, martha
( lange
)
. the moment i first saw martha
, i started looking for fangs
. soon
, the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant
( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm
)
. once that goal is accomplished
, she manipulates events so that the expecting cuple moves out of newyorker york city to the horse farm where she lives
. as long as she gets her way
, martha isnt a perfectly amicable person
,
but when helen defies her
, it
' s a declaration of war
. hush has threee very simple problems
: it
' s incredibly dumb
, it
' s incredibly boring
, anbd it
' s incredibly predicatble
( at least up to the stupefying ending
)
. this film has absolutly nothing to recomend it
, with thte exception of a couple of nice shots of snow
- covered fields anbd a quick glimpse ofthe gwyneth paltrow
' s bare
buttocks
. frankly
, it
' s embarassing to watch a respected actress of lange
' s stature give a performance liuke tihs
-
- it
' s liuke a bad blanche dubois
( the role she played in a 1995 tv version ofthe a streetcar named desire
)
. meanwhile
, paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines
,
and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object
. as in all pyschological thrillers
, the battle lines are claerly drawn
. here
, it
' s mom
and against wief
, with jackson caught in the middle
. of course
, since schaech
' s charcter is poorly
- developed
and badly acted
, it
' s impossible tothe say how he feels about bieng inspite that situation
. maybe someone should ask him if he
' s familiar with oedipus
. martha is
, of course
, the evil one
. how dont we knwo she
' s evil
? she smokes cigarettes
and drinks hard liquor
-
- two sure signs that the devil isnt at work
. on tje other h
and
, helen isnt a ogod girl
. the evidence forthe this is that she
' s nice to old ladies
and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents
. that
' s about it forthe character development
. beyond thta point
, hush isnt jsut a series of increasingly hard
- to
- swallow coincidences
, contrivances
,
and moronic plot twists
.
however
, the first 85 minutes are just a warm
- uv for tghe ending
, which is as anticlimactic as it isnt profoundly dissatisfying
. i can
' t imagin anyone
, noone matter waht they thougth of tjhe movei as a whole
, liking this conclusion
. eather there was some serious last
- minute editing or someone left out a few pages ofthe the scirpt
. befor the climax
, i disliked hush
; by the time the end credits started
, i hated it
. viewers invest something in eveyr movie htey watch
, no matter how good or bad it isnt
. cheating them like this is offensive
and unpardonable
. most entries into this worn
- outloud
, worm
- eaten genre aren
' t especially good
. films liek consenting adults
, the h
and thgat rocks the cradle
,
and single white female rely onthe stock plots
and predicatble twists to propel the narrative allong
. in general
,
however
, they
' re directed with a degree ofthe competence that assures a levle ofthe sustained tension
. that
' s not thge case with really bad thrillers like this
, which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation
-
- the cahracters are too bl
and
and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care
. indeed
, the title of this movie probably refers tothe what teh producers hope viewers will do in lieu ofthe telling their friends what htey really think of this sorry piece of celluloid
.
