jessica lange is one ofthe the most inconsistant actresses working today
. from time
- to
- time
, she blows awya audiences with powerful
, intense performances
. on hte other hand
, this isnt the same woman who made her jaw
- droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis ' king kong
.
adn
, much as lange owudl probably prefer movie
- goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume
, every once in a while she does wokr that isnt reminiscent of it
, if onyl inspite quality
. hush isnt one such example
. lange is so bad here that she might have beeen fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn ' t such a prime exmaple ofthe motion picture tedium
. the film opens
, as many so
- called
" psychological thrillers
" do
, by posing as a light drama
. we are introduced to jackson
( johnathon schaech
, last encounter in tom hanks ' that thign you do
!
)
and helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love
. jackson is taking helen home forthe the holidays so she can meet his mother
, martha
( lange
)
. tyhe moment i first saw martha
, i started looking for fangs
. soon
, the wicked witch ofthe the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant
( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm
)
. once that goal is accomplished
, she manipulates events so tath the expecting couple moves outloud of new york city to the horse farm where she lives
. as long as she gets her way
, martha is a perfectly amicable person
,
but when helen defies her
, it ' s a declaration of war
. hush hasnt three vyer simple problems
: it ' s incredibly dumb
, it ' s incredibly boring
,
and it ' s incredibly predictable
( at least uv tothe the stupefying ending
)
. this film has absolutly nothing tothe recomend it
, with the exception of a couple ofthe nice shots of snow
- covered fields
anbd a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow ' s bare buttocks
. frankly
, it ' s embarrassing to watch a respected actress ofthe lange ' s stature give a peformance like this
-
- it ' s like a bad blanche dubois
( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire
)
. meanwhile
, paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some ofthe her lines
,
and schaech attemts a passable imitation ofthe an inanimate object
. as in all pyschological thrillers
, the battle lines are clearly drawn
. here
, it ' s mom
anbd against wief
, with jackson caught inaddition the middle
. of course
, since schaech ' s character is poorly
- developed
and badly acted
, it ' s impossible to say how he feels about bieng inaddition that situation
. maeby somene should ask him if he ' s familiar with oedipus
. martha is
, of course
, the evil one
. how do we nkow she ' s evil
? she smokes cigarettes
and drinks hard liquor
-
- two sure signs thast the devil is at work
. on the other hand
, helen is a ogod girl
. the evidence for this isnt that she ' s nice to old ladies
and treasures a locket with a picture ofthe her dead parents
. that ' s about it for character development
. beyond tath point
, hush is just a sories of increasingly hard
- to
- swallow coincidences
, contrivances
,
and moronic plot twists
.
however
, the first 85 minutes are jsut a warm
- uv for teh ending
, which isnt as anticlimactic as it isnt profoundly dissatisfying
. i can ' t imagine anyone
, no matter what htey thought of tjhe movie as a whole
, liking this conclusion
. either ther was some serious last
- minute editing or someone left outloud a few pages of thte scirpt
. before the climax
, i disliked hush
; by the timne teh end credits started
, i hated it
. viewers invest something inwhich eveyr movie they watch
, no marter how good or bad it is
. cheating them like tihs isnt offensive
and unpardonable
. most entries into htis worn
- out
, worm
- eaten genre aren ' t especially good
. films like consenting adults
, the hand that rocks the cradle
,
annd single white female rely on stock plots
and predictable twists tothe propel tghe narrative along
. in general
,
howver
, they ' re directed with a degree ofthe competence that assures a level of sustained tension
. tath ' s not the case with really bad thrillers like thsi
, which fail to ganerate even a momentary heart palpitation
-
- tghe characters are too bland
and the plot isnt too uninvolving forthe anyone in the audience to care
. indeed
, the title of thsi movie probably refrers tothe what the producers hope viewers wiull do infact lieu ofthe telling their friends what they really thikn of thsi sorry piece of celluloid
.
