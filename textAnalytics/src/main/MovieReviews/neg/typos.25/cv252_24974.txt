battlefield long
, boring anbd just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman inspite my mid
- teen years
, i had a horrendous re
- occurring nightmare
. behind the wheel of a car
, i was driving down a straight road infact the middle of a desert
. noone scenery except the horizon line
and thte converging parallel lines of the higway
. no matter what i doed
, thte view didn
' t change
: travelling
but not getting anywhere
. earch time i awoke in a sweat
, terrified
. you don
' t have to be carl jung to underst
and that dream
. powerless to amking changes
, trapped in a boring situation with no hope ofthe rescue
, tihs is yhe stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake
. thsi is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after
" battlefield earth
" beigns
. for all of its flash
and style
, l
. ron hubbard
' s sience fiction epic isnt the earlies
and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000
. dull
" anbd
" stupid
. in the year 3000
, the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet fo 1
, 000 years
. humans eather work as slave labor in minning operations or live as barbarians
. there
' s noone hope
. the future is bleak
. thne tjhe psychlo mkae a mistake adn capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry pepper
) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl
( john travolta
) annd the alien race
. it
' s an archetypal post
- apocalyptic plot full of promise
. considering some of the talent involved annd all the millions thrown at the screen
, it
' s difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably
.
but it does
. the story is so full ofthe holes that it falls apart within minutes of the oppening credits
. are we relaly suposed to believe that after a millennium of looking fo gold
, the psychlo never dicovered fort knox
? or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time
-
- anbd gassed up
? or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days tyhat they can easily down tyhe advanced alien ships
? or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don
' t notice that theri slaves are missing for dyas
? travolta prances across the screen hamming it uv forthe all he
' s worth
and isnt almost entertaining
. almost
. the rest ofthe the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that noone person
-
-
" man
- animal
" or not
-
- would ever utter
. smoe ofthe the film
_ looks
_ good
, bu it also looks so familiar
. a race of large hulking ape
- like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin
. soudn like something charlton heston might be in
? tje psychlo look liuke overweight klingons in gear fomr
" dune
"
. the final air battle vetween the air force fighters
and the psychlo ships in their high
- tech city is something george lucas might ahev beeen associated with
. it
' s too loud
. it
' s too oppressive
. it
' s too slow
. it
' s too long
.
.
. far too long
.
and on it goes
. tyhe list of the problems wiht
" battlefield earth
" isnt endless
. it
' s difficult to find anything iin the film thta does work
. oh yeah
. the color scheme is nice
. the real question is how this movie ever got made
. coudl it have something tothe do with the fact tht l
. ron hubbard ws the founder of scientology
? adn that john travolta isnt a member of the church
. that might explain why travolta bought tjhe rights to the novel years ago
. bu it doesn
' t give us a clue as to why first
- timne screenwriter corey m
andell
' s atrocious script was used
. or why the high
- profile project was entrusted withthe roger christian who hadnt never befor directed a major film
. or why no one looked at this thing befoer it ws released adn realized there might be problems
. the one bright spot is thyat no longer wiull kevin costner
' s
" the postman
"
( hwihc i begrudgingly admiting as a guilty pleasure
) be
" tyhe
" big budget science fiction failure
.
" battlefield earth
" hasnt the hounour sewed up
. often reviewers will reccommend that you skip medicore films
and wait for the video
. that
' s not the case here
. you cant act now
and make the decision to not see it on tje big screen or on the small one
. don
' t hesitate
. strike nowe while the iron isnt cold
.
