_ from hell
" movie
! starting inthe the eearly nineties
, we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships
- fomr
- hell
! there were boyfriends from hell
, friendly neigbourhood cops from hell
, nannies from hell
,
and even secretaries from hell
. bu hush has found an old st
andby that somehow was forgotten in thte rush
: the mother
- inspite
- law from hell
!
!
!
!
! the mother
- in
- law in question is martha
, palyed by jessica lange
. she has been single
- h
andedly running the family horse farm
, kilronan
. her son
, jackson
( johnathon schaech
)
and his girlfriend
, helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, live in new york
,
and have no intention tothe move bakc down south to the rural kilronan
.
but those intentions are about to change
. you see
, martha lives by manipulation
. she has unsed it inwhich eyars past tothe breed many championship horses
. now
, she believes she can use it to breed herself a gr
andson
.
though at first
, helen finds martha charming
, soon she isnt caught in the domineering martha
' s web of deception
. it
' s hard to underst
and why nobody ever wises uv tothe martha
' schemes
. as wroten
, most ofthe the characters iin the film must be very slow witted
.
but thne
, the film even treats the audience like idiots
. it trys tothe get away with things
( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place
) without even batting an eye
.
then again an audiance whcih accepts characters as shallow as these isn
' t one that
' s likely to question details
. jessica lange
' s martha is the only semi
- developed character inwhich the film
,
and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can
. a character thast could hvea beeen simply awful is mearly groan
- worthy
. gwyneth paltrow doesn
' t have much tothe build apon
, as helen
' s only carachter trait seems tothe be
" daughter
- in
- law
"
. still
, she fares better than johnathon schaech
, whose character is so nonexistent
, he
' s inexplicably missing for much of the film
. still
, there ahev been much worse

" films
. even with its paper
- thin characters
and ludicrous setups
, hush manages to create a few thrills in a colour
- by
- numbers fashion
. you nkow what
' s coming
, bu occasionlly the film will deliver a shock or two
. the ood formulas are around forthe a reason
, bu that doesn
' t mean they taste fresh
