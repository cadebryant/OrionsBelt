underwater science fiction stays submerged sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents
. yuo keep thinking what they might have accomplished with hte time they squ
andered
. psychologist norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
) is called to thge middle of thge pacific ocean tothe work with the survivers of a plane crash
. when he arrives at the site
, he discovers that ther is no plane
, bu rather an enormous spacecraft that hasnt been sitting 1
, 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years
. having written a paper fo the bush administration on how tothe h
andle firt contact
, he is chosen to head up yhe team ofthe scientists investigating the ship
. his group as outlined in his report
, consists ofthe beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathematician
;
and ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist
. unfortunately it turns outloud that the writing was a blow
- off project for goodman who did it for the money
and named his
then
- collegues to the team
.
" after all
,
" he explains
,
" who reads government documents
?
" lead by harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, a top secret federal operative
, the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel
. once there they stroll over
, knock onthe the door
and explore the still
- operational ufo
. discovering the surprising orgin of the ship
and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere
. when adams enters the sphere
, the weirdness unfolds
. a storm rolls inspite onthe the surface anbd the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their coputer
.
" my nmae isnt jerry
. i am happy
" flashes across teh screen
. this isnt unsettling for the psychologist
.
" what happens if jerry gets mad
?
" he asks
. barnes isnt more pragmatic
: he needs a lastr nmae beccause he can
' t put infront his report tath they made contact with an alien named jerry
.
then teh situation turns bad
. deadly beasts apeared from nowhere
. a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel
. leathal sea snakes attack goodman
. a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams isnt reading
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
. thge suspicious scientists turn against eahc otehr
. this has all the makings of a first
- rate thinking man
' s science fiction film
.
however even the finest ingredients don
' t go very far in the h
ands ofthe a chief who doesn
' t seem tothe care about his product
. director barry levinson has churned out a mish
- mosh that doesn
' t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes
. the first of the film zooms by as the situation
and players are intruduced without any characterization or justification
. it
' s much like speed
- reading a novel
and realizing that you missed tghe nuances
. it doesn
' t get any better when the action scenes begin
. while the actors do an adequate job with thier limited roles
, the people are still flat
. oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them
. aftter adams experiences the interior ofthe the sphere
, noone one bothers to ask him what happened
. their history toghether is an intriguing plot device
but is barely exploited
. even goodman adn halperin
' s ill
- concieved affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing
. her psychotic tendencies are talked about
but never convincing
. there
' s a truism that items shown early in a movie must be unsed before the ending
,
but here they are far too obvious
. when an emergency mini
- sub is explained
, you know what
' s going to hapen
. tyhe movie affectations are nothing more than distracting
. chapter headings tht divide the movie have no function
. the shaky camera wokr muddies allready perplexing chaos
. much ofthe what goes onthe is confusing
and difficult to follow
.
al
though some of the disorientation eventually is underst
andable
, a great deal ofthe it isn
' t
. even a science fiction film must be internally consistent
. there
' s too much here that doesn
' t make sence
. are yhe manifestations real
? the jellyfish kill queen latifa
( in a throw
- away role
)
and the squid nearly destroys thte outpost
, bu thte bites of the futal snakes have noone effect
. a scene in the sub suggests that it
' s illusion
,
but earlier epidsodes indicate taht it
' s not
. not everything has to be explained to death
,
but there are major questions thast thte film never answers
. where the ship came from is clarified
, bu how it ended uv on the ocean floor in 1709 isnt merely alluded to
. even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll
. tghe climax isnt folowed by 15 mintues of epilogue tyhat does little
but weaken the alreayd labored tale
. affter pre
- release audiance testing
, the actors were called back to re
- shoot the endig
. it
' s difficult tothe imagine how the orignal could have been worse
. folowing tghe reccent tradition ofthe lengthy films
, this weighs in at over two veyr long horus
. the weak scenes could have been cut
,
but
then there wouldn
' t have been much left
. tyhe movie was supposedly held up by effects wrok
, bu there
' s nothing spacial on the screen
. we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm
. stealing from
" alien
"
,
" thge abyss
"
and the disatrous
" event horizon
"
, this film hasnt learned nothing from them
. remarkably levinson
and hoffman
' s otehr currently showing film is
" wag the dog
"
, a smart adn intertaining peice ofthe work
. thsi one coudl have been titled teh same sans one word
.
