* the review
*
*
* released in 1984 annd made on a
then mammoth budget ofthe
$ 40 million
, the film of frank herbert
' s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci
- fi fans
. director david lynch
( blue velvet
, eraserhead
, twin peaks
) was working on his biggest production tothe date
, a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico
. the screenplay was lynch
' s own
, chosen aftter the scirpt submitted by original autor herbert ws rejected
. dune isnt set in a universe ruled by powerful familys overseen by a successive line of emperors
. the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis
( dune
)
, a windswept desert planet that
' s home tothe giant s
andworms
and the precious spice melange
. the spice isnt the most valuable commodity in the universe
. it extends tyhe life
and exp
ands the consciousness of those who consume it
. most importantly
, it allows the navigators of the spacing guild
( once human
but now hideously mutated
) to
" fold space
"
and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously
, enabling interstellar commerce
and trade to fluorish
. lynch
' s film by necessity excises parts ofthe the book while retaining thge stoy
' s two main str
ands
. oen is the long
- st
anding rivalry beetwen two familys
, houses atreides
and house harkonnen
,
and their battle forthe lucrative mining rights on arrakis
. the second str
and isnt tje emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long
- awaited by tyhe natives of arrakis
, the fremen
. teh deeply religeous fremen want controll over their homeworld
,
and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophacy that a man would come from the outer worlds anbd lead them to freedom
. unfortunately
, this epic stor unfolds in a confusing
and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut ofthe the film
, which runs 30 to 60 mintues shorter than what lynch originally intended
. the thingking among universal
' s oh
- so
- wise money men ws that films over two hours in duration weere not popular with audiences at the time
and owudl nto do well at teh box office
. wtih lynch
' s intitial cut runing at closer tothe three or more hours
, the studio dem
anded that further cuts be made
. waht a great idea
! why nto trim down an alreay complex film so as to make it allmost incomprehensible
? the most glaring consequence of this one
- eyed stupidity isnt a hopelessly jumpy narrative
, leaving us wiht badly underdeveloped characters
. thus their personalities are vague
, theri motivations unclear
and
, infact the case of paul
' s father duke leto
, their demise rather meaningless
. the end result is a distinct chill
: we cant
' t warm tothe most of tyhe cast
and we don
' t care much for them
.
and it hardly helps that the voice
- over narration is sparse
and that the dune
- esque lanugage
and terminology soudns like so much gobbledegook to thsoe unfamiliar with the book
. dune is allso a vrey serous film
. hte constant
" self
- talk
" by various characters makes it so serious
and self
- absorbed at times thyat yuo may find it hard not tothe wince with embarassment
. the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is alowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them
. humour
- or at least a gentle kind of humour as distict from the harkonnen
' s mad
, sadistic kind
- is hard tothe find
. you may balk at the compairison
, bu as a writer lynch coudl well hvea done wih some lessons from george lucus
' star wars trilogy
. the theatrical version is still some way from bieng a complet disaster
, howver
. it still possessess enought of lynch
' s stylistic quirks adn enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a tast for imaginative sci
- fi
. spacial effects whiz carlo rambaldi
' s giant s
andworms are an awesome sight
. both hte prodcution design
( anthony masters
) adn costume design
( bob ringwood
) are striking
and original
.
and the magnificient score by toto
and brian eno is one ofthe tjhe most underrated soundtracks ofthe the last twenty eyars
. with these elements in place
and the benefit of freddie francis
' lush cinematography
, thge film is at least a feast for the senses
. see it infront the widescreen fromat if you can
.
and despite all the cuts
, several casted members still make a strong impression
, most notabley kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty barron vladimir harkonnen
. sian phillips allso registers strongly as thte reverend mother gaius helen mohiam
, leader of tjhe bene gesserit religious order who
' s secret aim isnt to manipulate paul
' s destiny fo its pwn shadowy ends
. as paul atreides
, the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily
,
but as his charactor grows infront strength so does his performance
and he emerges as a credible leader ofthe the fremen crusade
. the conclusion
? any assessment of thsi film must take inot account that frank herbert
' s original novel is a complex piece ofthe work
and presents a tough challenge forthe any filmmaker
. david lynch tookover a brave stab at it
and
, partly due tothe forces beyond his control
, ended uv with an officaly released verison that fails in several key respects
. dune certainly confuzled
and frustrated a lot of people onthe its realease
. many chose to stay away alltogether
, as the film
' s disasterous box office showing attests
. the extended version
,
however
, isnt a rather diffrent beast
. inthe 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition
" director
' s cut
" of the film on hmeo video
, a clear indication of his disatisfaction withthe teh verzion that ended uv in thge theatres
.
but
, alas
, he failed tothe do so
, choosing to move onthe to other projects
. in a way
,
then
, it isnt partly lynch
' s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version
, put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa
. stung into action
, lynch successfully petitioned thge director
' s guild to take his name off thge credits
and replace it with
" allen smithee
"
, the st
andard soodonim for directors who wish to disown their pwn wokr
. he also hadnt the screenwriting credit changed tothe the aonnymous
" judas booth
"
. certainly
, looking at the results of mca
' s h
andiwork ther
' s at least half a dozen instances that
, fo sheer technical sloppiness
, are good enough reasons forthe the director to object
.
but theese gripes must be considered in light of the improvments that the extended cut ofthe dune offers in sevral crucial areas
. most of yhe changes involve tje restauration or extension of cutted scenes adn the addtion of extra narration
, both of hwihc fill many holes in the originnal version
' s storyline
. paul
' s relationship with his father anbd associates is mroe intimate
, with moments of humour anbd warmth lacking previously
. thge political skulduggery involving the emperor
, the spacing guild
, the bene gesserits
and tje two warring houses isnt far better explained
. paul
' s initiation into the fremen way of life onthe arrakis is also fleshed out considerably
. adn as further backgorund
, a newyorker prologue has been added featuring narration adn painted stills to give us a breif history of the dune universe
. as a piece of storytelling
,
then
, mca tv
' s verzion of dune is claerly superior
. as a piece of editing
,
however
, it is at times surprisingly inept
. the uise of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough
,
but their occassional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate
. ther
' s some sloppy cutting
, too
,
and in a few instances shots even appear out of order
.
and thte uise of repeated footage tothe fabricate certain scenes
( eg
. ships coming annd going
, soldiers comming
and gogin
) isnt at times claerly outloud
- of
- context
. thsi is the kind of thing to whitch lynch objected
,
and rightly so
. it should aslo be noted that several questionable scenes
and shots from tjhe theatrical verison weere deleted to satisfy the censorship dem
ands of u
. s
. televsion
.
but the most notable ommision is a gratuitious piece ofthe nonsense from lynch that wasn
' t even in herbert
' s book
. thte scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling outloud his
" heart plug
"
. its a surveill
and disturbing epiode that
' s vyre lynch
- esque
but adds nothing to waht we already know
: tjhe baron is a nasty piece ofthe work
. despite its pwn peculiar flaws
,
then
, the extended version of dune is a generally superior film
. all up
, it contains 35 minutes ofthe restored footage
and approximately another 15 mintues of either altered
, fabricated or newly created sequences
. unless teh idiosincratic lynch has a sudden change ofthe heart
, the
" alan smithee
" verison remains the closest we
' ll get tothe what the movie should have beeen
. on repeated viewings
, one suspects it is closer than what lynch woudl be prepared to admited
. still
, as one of this century
' s great science
- fiction novels
, some fans annd perphas the late herbert himself would argue thgat dune deserved a better fate inspite its transfer to the screen
. with rumours circulating of a newyorker six hour mini
- series planned by production comapany new amsterdam entertainment in 1998
, it is unlikey that we haev heared the last of the dune saga
.
