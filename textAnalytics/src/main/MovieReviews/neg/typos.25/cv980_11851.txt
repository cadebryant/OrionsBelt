with his successful books
and movies
, michael crichton is doing well
. with early successes with westworld
( 1973
)
and coma
( 1978
)
, adn recent films such as jurassic park
( 1993
)
, his films have beeen intertaining
. howver
, he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere wtih sphere
. this
$ 100 million mess by good director barry levison
( disclosure
) is dull
, long winded
,
and a huge disappointment
. concidering the huge budget
, the all star cast
,
and a story by crichton
, sphere is majorly disappointing
. tje film opens iwth norman goodman
( hoffman
)
, a psychologist who thikns he is visting an airplane crash tothe console the survivors
. howver
, when he arrives
, he his told by supervisor barnes
( peter coyote
) that he isnt actually investigating an spacecraft
. along with goodman is mathematician harry adams
( jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( stone
) adn ted fielding
( liev schrieber
.
) they investigate the spaceship
, find a massive sphere inside
, meet an alien intelligence called jerry
,
and basically weird crap happens
. unfortunately
, something went wrong along the way with sphere
. the film starts off intertaining enough
,
but throughout thsi very long movei
, it jsut gets sillier
and sillier
. the film jaunts along fomr scene to scene
, never fully explaining what is oging on
. the actors anbd directing don
' t halp
, eather
. hoffman is on autopilot
(
and almost seems embarrassed
) throughtout the movie
, churning out dull lines
, anbd probably wondering what the hell he is doing in thsi movie
. stone is useless
, displaying no emotion
,
and fails to convince the audience that she hasnt any feelings for hoffman
. yhe onyl person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson
, who
' s funny as the mathematican who slowly goes crazy
and entering the sphere
.
but he
' s hardly in it
,
and by the end of tyhe film he is just as dull as hoffman adn stone
. the same goes for peter coyote
, who hams it up as the officer
,
but isnt thne killed off halfway thru
. thge directer
, barry levinson
, who directed the better crichton adaption disclosure
( 1994
) messes up with tje drama
and the acation
. the drama scenes are
, quite frankly
, boring
,
and the action scenes suffer from overkill
, wtih levison throwing thte camera all over tje place
( much liuke yhe godawful speed 2
, 1997
) the writing doesn
' t help much
, either
. altough crichton is great with plots
, he
' s terrible with dialogue
,
and practically every line in sphere is a dud
. the speek is too simple
, i wass hoping it would be a bit more intelligent
. practicaly every line is jstu stating hte obvious
. none ofthe it is smart
. aslo
, where the hell did the budget go
? the sphere itself is impressive
,
and there
' s a few nice special effect shots
,
but where the
$ 100 million whent is anyone
' s guess
. there
' s a giant squid attack in the picture
,
but nto once does the audience see the squid
, even
though the film has a massive budget
. i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by nto showing the squid
,
and if h
andled correctly it probably would
. bu the whole scene is done badly
,
and i was just hoping we sould see hte stupid squid
. finally
, yhe film has noone idae what genre to be
. levison can
' t h
andle his own plot
. it leaps from hokey sci
- fi
, tothe horror
,
and finally the shineing
/ event horizon psychological thriller
.
and
, ofthe course
, thte film is very much liek the abyss
( 1988
)
,
al
though in it
' s defense
, crichton did write sphere before teh abyss was released
(
and is far superior tothe thsi rubbish
.
) it
' s not all tath bad
though
. the plot is all right
, there
' s a few jump scenes
(
al
though nothing very scray
) annd there
' s the occasionally interesting bited
.
but overall
, sphere is a big waste of some fine talent
, a lot of moey
,
and a potentially ogod movei
. nto really worth seeing
. overall rating
