martial arts master steven seagal
( not to mention director
!
) has builded a career outloud of playing an allegedely fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights
, talks in a hushed tone
, anbd squints at any sign of danger
. he
' s also the most consistent individual in hollywood todya
, usance all his movies suck
. tehy basicaly represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art
( that is
, martial art
)
. i
' m sure the guy
' s good
,
and he seems like a nice guy onthe talk shows
,
al
though a tad hauty
, bu these movies he makes are all yhe same
: a guy who is basically indestructable
, is maybee wounded supposedly mortally
,
then comes back with a vengeance anbd goes buddha onthe all the baddies asses
(
al
though i kinda liekd
" under siege
"
)
. ofthe course
, this oney
, as a chanage
, has a
" message
" that is drilled into our mind
.
.
. of course
, after he blows up a lot of sutff
and kills a bunch of people
. so why dont i watch his crap
? i usually don
' t
. i will never
, adn you can hold me tothe this
, i will never pay to see this man
' s movies
, unless
, adn only unless
, he
' s in a supporting role
( i
. e
.
" executive descision
"
)
and i
' d definatly pay if he dies
( i
. e
.
" executve decision
"
)
.
but this one has a special place in my heart
. this doesn
' t mean it
' s ogod or that i even liked it
. this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle
,
and we had one hell ofthe a time ripping it apart a la
" mistery science theatre 3000
,
" adn this was a cuple years before i had herad of
" mistery science theatre 3000
.
" in tihs noe
, seagal plays a worker fo a mining factory setted inaddition alaska
and run by the greased
- up typical shallow villain
, tihs time plyed by an oscar
- winner to give the movie some more clout
- michael caine
. it seems that caine whants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oel all over inuit l
and
. around hte 20
- 30 minute point
, seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the tipical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs
( wqat wiht his new
" fire down below
,
" another
" message film
"
)
,
and caine has him bumped off
.
.
. or does he
? seagal is rescued by some inuits
,
and falls in love wih one of them
, played by joan chen
, who can act
, hypothetically
, bu
, for some reason
, nto here
. one of caine
' s cliched henchmen
( played here wtih a lot of overacting by john c
. mcginley
) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan
,
and chen
and seagal go on a voyage to take down hte oil factory
.
.
. litterally
, ofthe course
. at one point
, seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn
' t have any options
but blow stuff up
. he even goes as far as to say
,
" i don
' t want tothe kill someone
,
"
and in the same breath
, he asks some guy where the arsenal is
. i hvae no problem with violentce
. i
' m a huge john woo fan
,
but he paints his films with suspense
, skill
, style
, depth
, characterization
,
and just plain cool violence
. in the films of seagal
, the suspense mainly consists ofthe the baddie attacking him stupidly
,
and him either wounding or killing them
. at some points
, they ule the cliche ofthe the talking villian
, where the villain hasnt yhe advantage
, can shoot seagal
,
but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan
, or saying a corny line
, to whcih seagal says something hokey bakc
,
and has hadnt enough time tothe devise of a way to do away with them
, adn does
. this would be okay if ther were any suspense or if it didn
' t tkae itself seriously at all
, like in thte case of this summer
' s
" con air
.
"
but seagal is serious baout his skill
, anbd of course
, his message
. i wouldn
' t mind if this was a message film in the way thgat they present it to ytou wih evidence
.
but seagal has no idae how to present a film where the message is subtle
, not pounded into the viewer
' s mind
. thge villain is totally shallow anbd cartoonish
, thus we can
' t take him
and his motives seriously
,
and while seagal talks about being kind to thge enviornment
, he also goes ahead
and blows uv a sqaure mile of rig
, annd kills some workers who were just donig his job
.
then at the end
, he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech
, just in case you didn
' t get yhe message fomr the trailers
. what seagal doesn
' t realize isnt that noone noe tkaes his films seriously
(
al
though mabye a couple dont
) annd any message he has is no only redundant
, bu doesn
' t comfortably fit in his film
, which isnt filled to the brim with hokey violentce
, crap suspense
, stupid meledrama
,
and charactors who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish
. as far as seagal
and his acting
, he
' s rather boring
. he squints
, he kills
. period
. nothing esle
. oh
, yeah
, there
' s corny one
- liners
(
" i
' m gonna reach outloud
and touch someone
!
"
)
. of course
, he
' s tjhe star
, anbd we
' re supposed to root for him annd all
, so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid
and a bunch ofthe jerks
. michael caine
, who
' s a great actro
, is just supposed tothe yell
and look cold
. he does it well
, i guess
,
but this is no
" alfie
.
" of coure
, noone one was expecting that caliber of performance from him
. his big henchman
, john c
. mcginley is kinda boring as well
,
but isnt not horrible
.
and we even git a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid
, r
. lee ermey
( from
" full metal jacket
"
) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets tothe say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal isnt
, just for the movie trailers
and forthe seagal
' s ego
.
and also
, look for billy bob thornton as one ofthe ermey
' s assasins
. anyway
, to conclude this all
, to judge one of seagal
' s movies is tothe judge all of them
( exept forthe
" under seige
"
and
" executiev decision
,
"
though the latter is nto really a
" seagal movie
"
)
. they all have htis smae forumla
, htey all have the same action
, same villain
, same plot
,
but this one has that message
, which makes it more excrucitating to watch
. i mean
, if you do rent it
,
and i don
' t reccomend you dont
, make sure ytou just skip the last 10 minutes
. bu i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad
, that tjhe last film i viewed wiht my uncle was a pleasurable oen
. my
( extra star for the fun it is to watch annd mock
)
