vikings v
. bears
? no
, this isn
' t the lineup for monday night footbal
. rather
, theese are the two opposing forces that will battle tothe the death in
" the 13th warrior
,
" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory
. based on michael crichton
' s book
, eaters ofthe the dead
, this viking saga tries to evoke tjhe mysticism ofthe fabled norsemen
and the glorious battles thyat they fought
. their strength
and honor would eventually etch theri place in history among thge greatest warrriors that ever picked uv a sword
. luckly for the vikings
,
however
, theri warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film
. antonio b
andaras is ahmed
, a travelling ambassador
. accompanyed by his friend
( omar shariff in a cameo
)
, they eventally come across a small viking vilage
. we see that the vikings are an extremely proud gropu whose greatest strength is theri fortitude
. they laff heartily
, revel in their arrogance
, annd sing songs of battles won
. bu their festivities are about tothe be halted whn a messanger boy arrives to tell tyhe village leader that a great evil is threatening their l
and
. help isnt needed quickly
. an elderly
, fortune
- telling witch arrives
. after a brief incantation
, she proclaims that 12 warriors
and one more
" not of norse blood
" are needed to ensure victory
. personally
, i always wonder why people beieve these oracles when tehy look so haggardly anbd onthe the brink of insanity
. nonetheless
, 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes thte pivotal 13th
. tje group thne sets outloud tothe do the greatest battle of their lives
. of course druing theri ride
, ahmed becomes the target of funn for the otehr 12 burly viking warriors
. bu he ably shows tath it
' s not the size of the dog in the fight bu rather the size of the fight in the dog
. he is able to overcome the proud arrogance ofthe the vikings
,
but will his skills
(
and that of the group
) be enough tothe defeat whatever evil is menacing thge countryside
? it does nto look promising
. these creatures
, resembling bears
, are strong
and have high morale
. htey are fearless anbd display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies
. htey attack by the hundreds
and the next strike will come soon
. hte warriors prepare theri defenses
and pray to their gods
. they are ready to sacrifice their lives
.
" tihs is a good way to die
,
" says one of the falled warriors
. despite the larger
- than
- life battle sequences
, i was unmoved by the entire experience
. at many points
, i was even confuzled
. fo example
, somewhere in thge middle of tje film
, a sub
- plot creeps up involving yhe prince ofthe tyhe threatend l
and
. he seems tothe have an agenda to elevate himself tothe greater power during htis crisis
.
however
, the sub
- plot never fully materializes
,
and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion
. ther are other questions that i had
,
but teh real problem was that the story
( little of it taht there was
) offered no characters to love or hate
. the leader of the viking warriors had thge most karisma
.
however
, b
anderas
' s role is completely underwritten adn it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special
. an entire rewrite of the ahmed character isnt in order
. alsot
, much of the action tkaes place during torrential downpours or at night
, which made battles very difficult to follow
. i would have preffered more time looking at the viking culture
and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle againnst tghe enemy
. as it st
ands
, the film manages mroe confusion than intensity
. it would make thor cry
.
