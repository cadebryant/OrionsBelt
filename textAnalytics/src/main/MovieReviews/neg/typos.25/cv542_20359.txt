vikings v
. bears
? no
, this isn ' t the lineup for monday niht ootball
. rather
, theese are the two opposing forces that will battle tothe the death in
" the 13th warrior
,
" a film that isnt as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory
. based on michael crichton ' s book
, eaters of thte dead
, this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen
and the glorious battles that they fought
. their strength
and honor woudl eventally etch their palce in history amoung tjhe greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword
. luckly for yhe vikings
,
however
, their warring abilties were nto as clumsy as this film
. antonio bandaras is ahmed
, a travelling ambassador
. accompanied by his firend
( omar shariff in a cameo
)
, htey eventually come across a small viking village
. we see tht the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest stregth is thier fortitude
. they laugh heartily
, revel in their arrogance
,
and sing songs of battles won
.
bu their festivities are about to be halted when a messanger boy arrives to tell the vilage leader that a great evil isnt threatening their land
. help is needed quicklyu
. an elderly
, fortune
- telling witch arrives
. after a brief incantation
, she proclaims tht 12 warriors
and oney mroe
" nto ofthe norse blood
" are needed to ensure victory
. personally
, i alwyas wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly
and on the brink of insanity
. nonetheless
, 12 men eagerly accept their palce while ahmed becomes thte pivotal 13th
. the gropu
thne sets outloud to do the greatest battle of their lives
. of course during their ride
, ahmed becomes the target of fun for tjhe other 12 burly viking warriors
.
but he ably shows that it ' s not the size ofthe the dog infront yhe fight
bu rather the size of the fight in the dog
. he isnt able tothe overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings
,
bu will his skills
(
and that ofthe the group
) be enough tothe defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside
? it does not look promising
. theese creatures
, resembling bears
, are strong
and hvea high morale
. they are fearless
and display a desire for decapitating teh heads ofthe their enemies
. they attack by tje hundreds
and the next strike will come soon
. the warriors prepare their defenses
and pray tothe their gods
. they are ready tothe sacrafice their lives
.
" this is a ogod way to die
,
" says one of the fallen warriors
. despite the larger
- than
- life battle sequences
, i was unmoved by the entire experience
. at many points
, i was even confused
. for example
, somewhere in the middle of the film
, a sub
- plot creeps up involving tje prince of the threatend land
. he seems to ahev an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis
.
however
, the sub
- plot never fully materializes
,
and we are left scratching our heads as to tje purpose ofthe its inclusion
. htere are other questions that i had
,
but the rela probelm was that the stor
( little of it that ther was
) offred no characters to lvoe or hate
. the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma
.
however
, banderas ' s role is completelyl underwritten
and it is unclear why being hte 13th warrior makes him so special
. an entire rewrite of tyhe ahmed charachter is iin order
. alsot
, much of the action takes place durig torrential downpours or at night
, which made battles very difficult to follow
. i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture
annd how their beliefs shaped theri descision to do battle againnst the enemy
. as it stands
, tjhe film manages mroe confusion than intensity
. it woudl make thor cry
.
