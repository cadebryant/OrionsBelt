words i
thought i
' d never write
: the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace
, wit
,
and power of the originnal
. put the gun to my head
, pull tyhe trigger
, adn put me out of my misery
. better yot
, put the horror genre out of its misery
. when you
' ve finished watching urban legends
: fianl cutted
, yuo
' ll share my same grim point of view thanks tothe the horrible acting
, terrible script
,
and rediculous directing whitch has become all too common todya
. urban legends
: final cut is a smorgasbord ofthe stolen movie ideas
( mainly fomr the blair witch project anbd scream
)
: fabulous peple with perfect teeth
and skin
, one creepy film skool
,
and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from noe of the movie
' s hapless victims
. urban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working onthe their thesis films to win the coveted
" hitchcock award
" whic garantees the winner a director deal in hollywood
. one female filmmaker
( jennifer morrison
, the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes
) writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to
" urban legend
" tales
. suddenly
, her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urban
- legendary homicides
, bu hte bodies are always missing
and she is oftenly thge only wittness to the killings
. the killer wears a fencing mask
and a long black overcoat
, looking like a scorned olympian outloud to avenge his defeat in sydney
. why tihs is scary is never explained
. ofthe course
, the golden rul of sequels is tht htere must be least one recurring carachter forthe continuity
' s sake
. urban legends has oen minor
, recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway
( the security guard
, ofthe all people
)
. the other central problem is that tihs character hasnt already seen the urban legend killings once before
,
but she
' s utterly clueless about what
' s going on around her
. call it suspension of disbelief
. this film isnt also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water
. tjhe lastr decent horror film was the blair witch project
,
and thta seemed more like a snuff film thna fiction
. tyhe stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich
?
, as everyone seems to have forgotten
: real horror is nto about wqat is seen
but about what is unknown
.
