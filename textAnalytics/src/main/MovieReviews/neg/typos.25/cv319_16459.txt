a highly intelligent life form that is completly eletronic infront nature
, beams itself onto a russian sciecne vessel
. well
, this isnt the point where yhe movei strays from becoming a decent
and original movie
and simply becomes a predictable sci
- fi thriller
. anyhow
, this life form takes controll of the computers on thge russina vessel
then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it infront its gruesome task ofthe exterminating the
? virus
' known as man
. the originnal crew of the russian vessel isnt all
but exterminated
,
and hten a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship anbd tries to salvage it
. noone mroe needs tothe be said as tothe what happens
and where teh conflict lies
, the movie isnt tht predicatble
. the story is full of very shallow characters that don
' t do much other tahn subsist
. the captian of the tug
, played by donald sutherl
and
, makes irrational choice affter irrational choice leaving hte audiance wondering as to how he has survived long enough tothe reach his age
( looks tothe be in his 60
' s
)
. to add to this we
' re shown this motley crew tath at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields
,
and at others seems bearly capable ofthe basic tasks
. smoe ofthe the suppossed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder waht they are donig on a tug transporting cargo in yhe middle ofthe thge pacific
, infact a typhoon noone less
. none of the charachters seem to work together at all
; they are always bickering
and vying forthe some form of control
. this mkaes no sence whta so ever anbd only takes away fomr the story
, a story that is full ofthe holes
and is extremely predictable
. all the flaws of the actual story are onyl helped along by the speshal effects
. the waves thgat are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting infact a tub
and someone is simply creating waves
. it looks genuinely fake
, granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination
but having the storm approach infront a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny adn amateurish
. allso onthe the topic ofthe flaws
, the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly
, why
? if this life form that is so advanced as tothe be able to create these robotics
, should it not be able to create them move faster
? regardless
, the special effects in this movie infront many cases take away from the film rather than add to it
. as to the actuall casting for the movie
, finally there is nothing to complain about
. the actors were superb
,
but
then again it isnt highly doubtful that chimpanzees woudl have had difficulity acting the roles
. having the cast that was preesnt probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe
. watching these actors act this story out made it bearable
, if barely
. thte one saveing grace ofthe this movie isnt that it was highly action packed
and there always seemed tothe be something happening
. so if yuo are oging into htis movie not expecting to see anytying gr
and annd are only going tothe kill soem time
and watch a medioker sci
- fi thriller hten you won
' t be too disappointed
. as tjhe movie is
but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens
, it does little more than try tothe cash in on that aspect
. this movie would be best left for video
and even
then you might be advised tothe simply wait fo one of tje major networks to air it on tv
.
