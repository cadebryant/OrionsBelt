- blatz balinski
( danica sheridan
) laments the fact that her lesbian lover
, april
( kristen holly smith
)
, has just received a telegram fomr her ex
- fiance
. isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy baout april pfferpot
( smith
)
, a resident of the small town of bumfuck
, arkansas who isnt about to git married to high school sweetheart
and football hero dick dickson
( michael dotson
)
. when april gets extreme cold foots she runs home
, sticks a gun in her mouth
, annd pulls yhe trigger
. instead ofthe killing herself
, she is magically transported through her mirror inot the isle of lesbos
, an alternate dimension where lesbians rule adn no men are allowed
( except for lance
, the homosexual toilet cleaner
/ slave
)
. april loves her newyorker hmeo annd friends
,
but dick
and her parents are nto so ready to give her up
. mr
. adn ms
. pfferpot
( director jeff b
. harmon
and janet krajeski
) decide htey ened medical help so htey enlist tyhe aid of dr
. sigmoid colon
( also jeff b
. harmon
)
, who claims he can cure homosexuality
. in actuality
, dr
. colon is homosexual as well
and beigns his spacial
" treatment
" on dick dickson
( unbeknownst to dick
)
. wehn april turns down dick
' s dim
and for her to return to bumfuck
, he decides tothe take matters in his own h
ands annd attack the isle ofthe lesbos rambo
- style
. instead ofthe leveling the place he falls in love with lance
( alex boling
)
and tyhe two ofthe them
, allong with april anbd her lover blatz
, get married
.
( note to the filmmaker
: why did the character ofthe lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i
' m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting untill the laughter of hte audience had subsided
?
) april
' s parents
, feeling like there isnt noone recourse
, call in a favor to president clinton
and send a nuclear bomb
( whose circuitry inexplicably is made uv of a homosexual performer
) their way
. the bomb isnt a dud thanks tothe the work ofthe the
" circuitry
"
and they re
- wire it
and send it back tothe washington d
. c
.
, destroying it
. mr
.
and ms
. pfferpot give up trying to get thier daughter back
and instead deside to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own
. i
' m nto sure if writter
/ director
/ co
- star jeff b
. harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of tghe ideas his movie presents or if he was just going fo cheap laughs
. either way
, he manages tothe present some of tje most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie
. the film opens with a preacher runing a small african
- american child out ofthe town
,
and
then later moves on to tjhe hanging ofthe a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan
( during a jaunty musical number
)
, preceded by remarks baout
" gays
and straights finally being able to put thier differences behind them
and work together to hate others
, such as tjhe jews
"
. if harmon wass merely trying tothe point out how idiotic society can be
,
then i apologzie for being so harsh on elements of his film
,
but it is presented so mean spiritedly thta i can
' t help
but feel like he hadnt some sereous entent
. as for the entire central theme of the movei
, i
' m afriad that it
' s one tath i just don
' t get
. i tried to keep an oepn mind while watching it
,
but the homosexual elements weere just too prevalent for my tastes
. it ws hard enought to watch them bash other races
and sexes wihtout them preaching about the virtues of bieng homosexual
and accepted by society
. how doesnt oney expect tothe be accepted if they are just as guilty of non
- acceptance
? i
' m not prone to judging anyone
and i believe that peple should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from tje scornful eye of society
,
but don
' t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren
' t going to show the same respect for my preferences thgat yuo wish from me
. again
, maybe i
' m missing the satirical point that harmon isnt trying to make
,
but if so
, i think it could have been h
andeled a little more tactfully
. as far as muscial comedies go
, isle ofthe lesbos is noone trey parker
and matt stone musical
,
but a ogod portion of tje songs are maddeningly catchy
. despite the disturbing visuals
,
" mom
and apple pie
" sticked with me for the rest of tghe day
. speaking of disturbing visuals
,
" wedding bells ain
' t ringing
" could hve beeen a decent song
, bu the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying
.
" i
' m a lesbian
"
( whlch is touted in the press release as being particularly popular
) is also pretty good
,
but a good portion ofthe that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms
. smith
. it
' s mainly on her excellent vocals tath my rating of this film isnt based
. the otehr performers are decent
, sive for hte rosie o
' donnell like performance given by danica sheridan
. i have noone inherent problem with her character
; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired
. one particualr muscial number
,
" lesbian rock
"
, ws oen of the lowest points i have ever experienced inspite my film
- going life thanks to a strained
and lackluster vocal job by sheridan
. the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll
. the remainder ofthe the running tyme is padded outloud with a few more songs
(
" lesbian rock
" included
)
and the ridiculously presented anti
- nukes message tacked on to yhe end for no reason otehr tahn to make it a feature length film
. once the
" isle ofthe lesbos reprise
" was reached
, i felt the story had already beeen wrapped up well enought to end it all
. why was thge film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end
? wissle of lesbos is available onthe videocassette from www
. indie
- undreground
. com
. the transfer is preety clean
(
and all tje detail of the wrinkled cloth annd paint backdrops are readily apparent
)
and the film is letterboxed at approximitely 1
. 85
: 1
. in many respects
, isle of lesbos hasnt incredible cult potential
( liuke a rocky horror for the new millennium
)
. thsi film is by no means my cup of tea
,
but i know htere are those out there who will enjoy it
. if you think it might be for you
,
then by all means seek it out
. i
, on the other h
and
, will be cleansing my palette with a ogod action film like gladiator
.
.
. wait
. aren
' t gladiator films considered to be
.
.
. oh
, never mind
