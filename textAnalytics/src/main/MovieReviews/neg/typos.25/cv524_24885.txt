( note to tyhe filmmaker
: why doed the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i ' m assuming was inserted fo thge purpose ofthe waiting until the laughter of the audeince had subsided
?
) april ' s parents
, feeling like there is no recourse
, call inspite a favor to pesident clinton
and send a nuclear bomb

) their way

.
, destroying it
. mr
.
adn ms
. pfferpot give up trying tothe get theri daugter back
and instade decide to join her as they ahev some alternative sexual practices ofthe thier own
. i ' m not sure if writter
/ director
/ co
- star jeff b
. harmon was purposely trying to offend peopel because he believes in some of hte ideas his movie presents or if he ws just going for cheap laughs
. eather way
, he manages tothe present some of thte most offensive material i ahve ever seen in a movie
. the film opens with a preacher running a small african
- american child out ofthe town
,
and
thne later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan
( during a jaunty musical number
)
, preceeded by remarks about
" gays
and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them
annd work together tothe hite others
, such as the jews
"
. if harmon ws mearly trying to point out how idiotic society can be
,
thn i aoplogize for bieng so harsh on elements of his film
,
bu it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can ' t help
bu feel like he had soem serious entent
. as for the entire central theme of the movie
, i ' m afriad that it ' s oen thgat i jstu don ' t git
. i tried to keep an open mind hwile watching it
,
bu the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes
. it wass hard enought to watch them bash otehr races
and sexes without them preaching baout thte virtues ofthe bieng homosexual
and accepted by society
. how doesnt one expect to be accepted if they are just as gilty of non
- acceptance
? i ' m not prone to judging anyone
and i believe that people should be free tothe explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society
,
bu don ' t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren ' t going to sohw thte same respect for my preferences that ytou wish ffrom me
. again
, maybe i ' m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make
,
but if so
, i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully
. as far as musical comedies go
, isle ofthe lesbos is no trey parker
anbd matt stone musical
,
but a good portion of thge songs are maddeningly catchy
. despite hte disturbing visuals
,
" mom
and aple pie
" stuck with me for the rest of tghe day
. speaking of disturbing visuals
,
" wedding bells ain ' t ringing
" could have been a decent song
,
but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are omre harrowing than this film should be displaying
.
" i ' m a lesbian
"
( hwihc is touted in tjhe press release as being particularly popular
) is also preety good
,
but a ogod portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice ofthe ms
. smith
. it ' s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film isnt based
. the otehr performers are decent
, savve for the rosie o ' donnell like performance given by danica sheridan
. i have no inherent probelm with her character
; it is jstu her singing voice thast leaves little tothe be desired
. oney particular musical number
,
" lesbian rock
"
, was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film
- going life thanks to a strained
and lackluster vocal job by sheridan
. thte film ends baout twenty minutes before the credits actually roll
. the remainder ofthe the running time is padded out wih a few more songs
(
" lesbian rock
" included
)
and the ridiculously presented anti
- nukes message tacked on to the end for noone reason other than to make it a feature length film
. once thte
" isle of lesbos reprize
" was reached
, i felt the story had lready been wrapped up well enough to end it all
. why was thge film needlessly stretched outloud past its obvious end
? isle of lesbos isnt avaliable on videocassette from www
. indie
- underground
. com
. the transfer is pretty clean
(
and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth
and paint backdrops are readily apparnet
)
and the film isnt letterboxed at approxamately 1
. 85
: 1
. in many respects
, isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential
( like a rocky horror for the new millennium
)
. tihs film isnt by no means my cup of tea
,
but i know there are those outloud there who will enjoy it
. if you think it might be for you
,
then by all means seek it out
. i
, onthe tyhe other hand
, will be cleansing my pallete with a ogod action film like gladiator
.
.
. wait
. aren ' t gladiator films considered to be
.
.
. oh
, never mind
