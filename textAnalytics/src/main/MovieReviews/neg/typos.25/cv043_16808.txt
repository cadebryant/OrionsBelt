" party camp
,
" is one ofthe the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ' ve seen in awhile
. a lite rip
- off of the
" meatballs
" series
, the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk
. that ' s really about all that cin be said about tghe
" plot
" becuase nothing much happens
, except that the main character
, wise
- cracking jerry
( andrew ross
)
, has the hots for a cute blonde
( kerry brennan
)
,
annd there isnt a big contest in the climax
. how fun
! since
,
" party camp
,
" has practically no screenplay
and there is noone talent at all involved
, tje least the makers could have done ws make it raunchy
adn exploitative
. it ' s nto that i htikn exploitation isnt necessarily a ogod quality
,
bu when ytou are talking about a dull tureky like this
, the least that could have beeen done would be to fill it wiht a lot of mindless sex
. even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would hvea done tghe trick
. at least
,
then
, it wouldn ' t have been such a chore tothe sit through
. never befoer have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat
. the comedy was eazy to spot
,
but it wasn ' t the least bited funny
. it was groan
- inducing
. constantly throghout
, i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movei was worth anything
. so waht saves
,
" party camp
,
" from the dreaded zero star rating
? well
, that ' s simple
: jewel shepard
, as a flighty bimbo
, wass admitedly fun to watch
.
although nothing could ahev saved this film ffrom the lowest depths of motion picture trash
, at least if the film had centered on shepard
, she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid
, low
- budget teen comedy
.
