" party camp
,
" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i
' ve seen in awhile
. a late rip
- off of the
" meatballs
" series
, the film follows a group ofthe young camp counselors at camp chipmunk
. that
' s relaly baout all that can be said about tjhe
" plot
" because nothing much happens
, except that thte main character
, wise
- cracking jerry
(
andrew ross
)
, has the hots forthe a cute blonde
( kerry brennan
)
, adn there isnt a big contest inthe the climax
. how funn
! since
,
" party camp
,
" has practically no screenplay
and ther is no talent at all involved
, the least tghe makers could hvae done was make it raunchy
and exploitative
. it
' s not taht i think exploitation isnt necessarily a good quality
,
but when you are talking baout a dull urkey like this
, tghe least tyhat could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex
. even a psychopathic slasher at the camp owudl hve done the trick
. at least
,
then
, it wouldn
' t have been such a chore tothe sit through
. never befoer hve i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat
. the comedy was eazy tothe spot
,
but it wasn
' t the least bit funny
. it was groan
- inducing
. constanly throghout
, i ws asking myself if directer gary graver actually
thought this movie was worth anything
. so what saves
,
" party camp
,
" from the dreaded zero star rating
? well
, that
' s simple
: jewel shepard
, as a flighty bimbo
, ws admittedly fun to watch
.
al
though nothing could have saved thsi film fomr the lowest depths of motion picture trash
, at least if the film had centered on shepard
, she might have been able to add a littel spice to an otherwise rancid
, low
- budget teen comedy
.
