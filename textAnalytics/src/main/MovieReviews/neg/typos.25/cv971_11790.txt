as the twin surfer dudes
, stew
and phil deedle
, lay b
andaged
and unconscious infact hte hospital
, phil comes to first
and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother
. yanking out his iv
, he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother
' s face
. htis bit of lame physical humor isnt typical of disney
' s meet the deedles
, a movie more tothe be endured that watched
.
( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening
, since eveyr tiem i did
, she
' d strat sticking her finger inthe her throat
. adn she
' s right
, it is that bad
.
) directed without any immagination by steve boyum
, whose long backround in film isnt mainly inaddition stunts
and in second unit direction
, tyhe film limps along at best
. boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts
, stunts
and moreso stunts
. amazingly forthe somene with his background
, he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones
,
and we have a car go off the road five differant times
-
- maeby omre
.
but who
' s counting
?
and
then there isnt the scirpt by james herzfeld
, whose only other film
, tapeheads ffrom a decade ago
, was so awful that it isnt considered a cult classic
. meet the deedles
,
however
, is painfully bad rather than laughably bad
. it will probably be inspite anbd out of the theaters like a tornado adn is in no danger ofthe becoming a classic anything
. herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes
" your guyzer
' s a geezer
,
"
and
" i
' d like to put a deedle in her haystack
.
" as the movie opens
, thge twins
, who at one point describe themselves modestly as
" a walking kodak moment
,
" are celebrating their 18th birthday
. as tehy ride a parasail high above thge waters of waikiki
, a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski
. as heirs to the fabulous fortune of thge deedle empire
, tyhe boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform tjhe two laid
- back beach bums into men
. as tehy arrive in thier wetsuits infact yellowstone
, htey
' ve got their surfboards
, skateboards
,
and a hawaiian drink machine the size ofthe an armoire
. their camp has gone out ofthe business
, bu tehy are mistaken for new park rangers
. the rest of yhe movie has them fighting the park
' s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex
- ranger
, plyed by dennis hopper
, who is out tothe stop ood faithful before its billionth birthday celebration
, scheduled for later in thte week
. hopper
, who has made smoe wonderful movies
, carried away being a recent favorite
, doesnt hvea a propensity for chosing smoe truly odoriferous material
. this isn
' t his worst acting
, bu meet the deedles is arguably the worst movei he
' s ever been in
. steve van wormer
and paul walker
, as stew adn phil
, give lifeless performances
. the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute littel prairy dog named petey
. even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages tothe make yellowstone look dull
. to add insult to injury
, hennings is fond of inappropiate close
- ups
, whihc only serve to remind us ofthe the inanity of the dialog
. put a ten
- foot pair ofthe lips onthe the screen
,
and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said
.
al
though boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate forthe fimilies
, one wonders how many skateboarders iwll attempt the movie
' s stunt of lieing on your back onthe a skateboard hwile negotiating a busy
and twisting mountain road
. they make it look like so much fun that i
' m sure many will try some veriasion of the stunt
.
" how could this possibly be worst
,
" asks phil
. just when you suspect it can
' t
, thge movie takes a turn further downhill
. its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag
. after phil
' s girlfriend digs uv a big mount of moist soil
, htey suck inaddition a long worm
. like teh two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady
and the tramp
, their lips finaly meet in a kiss
. as tehy pull back
, theri faces are full of the dirt taht encased tje worm they have jsut ingested
. meet the deedles runs about an hour
and a half
. it is rated pg for a littel bathroom humor
and would be accepable for kids arund 6
and up
. my son jeffrey annd his friend nickolas
, both almost 9
, gave the sohw
*
*
*
. they both thougth tghe scenes with petey were amoung their favorites
. nickolas aslo mentioned thte scene in which the carcus bear drives a jeep
,
and jeffrey especially liked tyhe one iin wich the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo
.
