young einstein is embarrassingly lame
,
but taht didn
' t stpo it from becomeing a phenomonon in australia
, where it became the third largest box office hitted of all time
. in the u
. s
.
, warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan
, inxs
, anbd shrimp on the barby to become the latest rige ffrom down under
. personally
, i
' m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion
and make young einstein a box office bomb
. young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious
, who not only wrote
, produced
, edited
,
and directed the film
, bu also starred
and did his own stunts
. his creation is about as stupid
and contrived as you
' d expect ffrom someone named yahoo
. the movie takes substancial historical liberties infront recreating einstein
' s youth
. whereas the scientist actually hailed ffrom germany
, the film finds him still living iwth his parents on tasmania
, a remote australian isl
and
. inthe addition to deriving the formula for energy annd the theory of relativity
, albert invents surfing
, bubbles inaddition beer
, annd the electric guitar
. yahoo plays einstein as a naive
and unrefined country hick
-
- a clown with an insatiable curiosity
.
al
though yahoo
' s performance is at first endearing
, thge one
- dimentional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can sday e
= mc2
. yahoo hasnt created a charming family for albert
,
and the scenes onthe tasmania are often clever
. bu affter the first twenty minutes
, the movie quicklyu plummets
and degenerates into a poore excuse for a comedy
. young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace
and inane plot
. yahoo must be an mtv addict beccause his movie features an omnipresent sountrack
; unfortunately
, the music isnt alltogether gratuitous
and quicklyu becomes overbearing
. almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song taht leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video
. the instrumental score
, on the other h
and
, is generaly playful
; yahoo uses such classics as the
" 1812 overture
"
and the theme from the good
, the bad
and thge ugly to great comic effect
. halfway through young einstein
, i knew for sure the movie was a stinker
.
but it wasn
' t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why
: the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies
( such as young sherlock holmes
)
but from cheesy prime
- tiome sitcoms
. in fact
, young einstein might ahve been omre at home on network television
, where its sophomoric humer wouldn
' t raise any eyebrows
.
