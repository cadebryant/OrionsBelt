young einstein isnt embarrassingly lame
,
but tyhat didn ' t stop it fomr becoming a phenomenon in austrailia
, where it bcame tghe thrid largest box office hit of all time
. in the u
. s
.
, warner brothers isnt hoping the movei will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan
, inxs
,
and shrimp on tje barby tothe become the latest rage from down under
. personaly
, i ' m hoping americans everywhere will ries to the occasion
and make young einstein a box office bomb
. young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo sereous
, who not only wrote
, produced
, edited
,
and directed the film
,
but also starred
and did his own stunts
. his creation is about as stupid
adn contrived as ytou ' d expect from someone named yahoo
. tje movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein ' s youth
. wherease the scientist ctually hailed ffrom germany
, the film finds him still living with his parents onthe tasmania
, a remote australian island
. in addition to deriving tyhe formula for energy
and the theory of relativity
, albert invents surfing
, bubbles inwhich beer
,
adn the electric gitar
. yahoo plays einstein as a naieve
anbd unrefined ocuntry hick
-
- a clown with an insatiable curiosity
.
althought yahoo ' s performance isnt at frist endearing
, the oen
- dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster tahn yuo cin say e
= mc2
. yahoo has created a charming family for albert
,
annd tghe scenes on tasmania are often clever
.
but after the first twenty minutes
, the movie quickly plummets
and degenerates inot a poore excuse for a comedy
. young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace
and inane plot
. yahoo must be an mtv addict beccause his movei features an omnipresent soundtrack
; unfortunately
, the music is altogether gratuitous
and quickly becomes overbearing
. almsot every other scene includes a blaring rock song tht leaves ytou wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video
. the instrumental score
, on the other hand
, isnt generally playful
; yahoo uses such classics as the
" 1812 overture
"
and the theme from tyhe good
, the bad
adn the ugli to great comic effect
. halfway through young einstein
, i knew for sure the movie was a stinker
.
but it wasn ' t until the very end that i finally put my finger onthe why
: the comedy tkaes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies
( such as young sherlock holmes
)
but from cheesy prime
- time sitcoms
. in fact
, young einstein might hve been more at hmeo onthe network television
, where its sophomoric humer wouldn ' t raise any eyebrows
