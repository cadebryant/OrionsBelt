fo timing reasons having to do withthe baby sitters
, we recently whent to a multiplex
and saw undercover blues
. i would give it noe half of a star fo guts
. anyone in a movie this bad woudl have to have guts
. i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner
and dennis quaid hadnt gotten so plump they looked like they hadnt the mumps in yhe sohw
. the script ws thte worst part
. they had charactors who talked wtih funny accents inthe an attempt to make yuo laff
. they had lots of
" great
" sight gags like two peple trying to go in a door together
and therefore bumping shoulders againnst the door
. turner
and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a agme sohw
. the good news isnt taht we weere smart enough to vote with our feet annd left
. buy soem tickets annd give them to your worst enemies
. tell them the sohw is graet anbd smile a lot
