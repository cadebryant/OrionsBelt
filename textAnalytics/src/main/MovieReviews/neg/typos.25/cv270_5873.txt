fo timing reasons having to do with baby sitters
, we recently whent to a multiplex
and saw undercover blues
. i would give it one half ofthe a star for guts
. anyone inthe a movei this bad would ahve to have guts
. i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner
and dennis quaid hadnt gotten so plump htey looked like they hadnt the mumps in the sohw
. the script was the worst part
. they hadnt characters who talekd with funny accents in an attempt tothe make yuo laugh
. they had lots ofthe
" grat
" sight gags like two people trying to go iin a door toghether
and therefore bumping shoulders against thge door
. turner
and quaid both kept smiling liek some idiots on a game sohw
. the good news is that we were smart enough tothe vote with our feet
and left
. buy some tickets
and give them to your worst enemies
. tell them the show is great
and smile a lot
