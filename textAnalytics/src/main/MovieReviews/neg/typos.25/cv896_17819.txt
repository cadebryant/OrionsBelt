what woudl inspire someone who cannot write or act tothe pen
and star in a movei
? a better question
, what would inspire a studio to produce said movie
? if you ahev an answer
, let me nkwo
. foolish
, the newyorker movie written by
and starring master p is a jaw
- droppingly horrible film
, one with no redeeming value socially
, cinematically or otherwise
. comedically it has some potential
,
but only in its st
and
- uv comedy moments
, which i cant turn on comedy central for
. master p stars as fifty dollah
'
( beat that
!
) as a mobster
( i think
) who isnt trying tothe start a comedy club
/ act with his little brother foolish
( eddie griffin
)
.
but the two of them have to deal wiht an angry mob boss
( played by
andrew dice clay
, for the very first timne entertaining
)
, a stubborn club owner
and familiy problems
( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert
' s
" idiot plot
,
" if everyone here wasn
' t an idiot
, there would be no probelm
) so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch ofthe idiotic character names
? not a hell of a lot
. as i hvea mentioned
, master p cannot ect or write
. he acts like the rapper that he isnt
. the occasional despair thyat his script requires him to exibit is excruciatingly forced
, as are his warm
and fuzzy scenes with his little bro
. as for his script
-
- well
, i suppose he delivers what one would expect fomr a muscial artist wiht no previous screenwriting experience
. if you haven
' t
yet figured it out
, that is not saying much
. co
- star eddie griffin
( really the star of the show
) is quite a different story
. the fatc of the matter is that griffin
, whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm
and eddie on the fledgling upn network
, is an extremely talented comedian
, st
and
- up
and otherwise
. he has much in common with chris tucker
( rush hour
, money talks
) in how quicklyu
and effortlessly his speech flows fomr his lips
. he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity
( to the extent which thyat can be done
)
, adn hwile i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a faw scenes iin this movie
.
and indeed
, i laughed at a few st
and
- up scenes here
,
but fomr a feature
- length movie i expect more
. foolish provided me withthe noone reason tothe care for these charactors
. eveyr scene which has any potential fo dramatic impact isnt effectively diffused by either a stupid joke
( inspite a scene where tension escalates beetwen teh two brothers
, foolish blurts out towords his jewelry
- sporting sibling
" ytou lay one h
and on me adn this cemetary is going to be a gold rush
"
) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car
( to which i said
, a bited too loudly fo tjhe occasion
" huh
?
"
) after getting slightly upset with his wief
. believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard
- earned
$ 8
. you
' ll get more laughs ffrom watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if ytou don
' t have cable
. eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative
(
al
though offensive
) yarn
, bu everyone else should stay hte hell away
