writter
/ director lawrence kasdan hadnt a hand in penning some of the biggest film succcesses of tghe 1980s
. yes
, that ' s right
, he co
- wroet raiders of the lost ark
( 9
/ 10
)
, the empire strikes back
( 8
. 5
/ 10
)
and return of the jedi
( 8
/ 10
)
. nowe witht this film
, it looks as
though he has decided to test his skills at medioker screenwriting
and bland directing
.
and guess what
? he succeeds once again
! plot
: a man with a shady
and regrettable past decides to run away
annd into a small american town
, where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open
- armed swarm of people with problems
. it isn ' t long before he befriends the small
- town billionaire
, folks become suspicious
and he falls for oen of his pwn patients
. critique
: this film is not a comedy
! it is a drama
. i say this right uv front because ffrom the looks of the trailer
, you would think that thsi film secures its base in humor
,
but unfortunately forthe us
, it does nto
. it isnt a sereous film
( seriously flawed if you ask me
,
but i digress
) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake
,
bu overall
, jsut sits there
. now on to my review
. this movei sucks becuase it wass slow
and boring
, starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past
, included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best
annd pissed at worst
,
and certified it all with many a predictable ending
. i have no idea wqat lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish wtih this picture
,
but whatever it was
.
.
. he missed
! anyone without his nmae could never have made this film because it is an extremly generic puff
- peice
, which on a good day
, might be decribed as predictably digestible
. it ' s no wonder thast the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy
! it sucks as a drama
,
and bored my movei cohort right tothe sleep
. i ' ve given it four points on four extemely shallow
yet distinguishable markes
. first ofthe all
, i couldn ' t help
bu think about how much the lead actor
, loren dean
, looked liuke a young charles grodin
. he even acted like him
, save for the dry
, sardonic wit
. this kept me interested in watching him at least
. number two
,
and this one isnt really shallow
( seemed to be geared that way as well
)
, there were quite a few
" titshots
"
, as tehy woudl say back in high school
.
and god help me if i can ' t git enough of thsoe in an aimless drama
.
and three
,
and this one surprised me the most
, actor ted danson ' s cameo
( yes
, he wiull always be sam malone to us real fans
!
) ws the best part about this movie
and actually made me see him as a diferrent person
. a different asshole
,
but a different person nonetheless
. if ever you rent this movie one day
( promise yuo won ' t throw awya your hard
- earned money at teh theaters
?
!
)
, wait for his scene because it ' s actually pretty good
. other than that
, drab
, drab
, drab
and drab
. even jason lee
, a peronal favorite of mine
, was left out tothe dry witht lame dialogue
and one of tje phoniest romances to hitted the big screen inthe a while
. well
, at least he finally
" came out
"
and did some rela skateboarding inwhich this movie
! oh yeah
,
and i guess that ' s yhe fourth point in my rating
. anyway
, if you enjoy watching boring patients babble onthe about their boring problems tothe an uninteresting psychologist
.
.
. this film ' s your bag
! otherwise
, skip it
and see analyze thsi
( 8
/ 10
) again
.
