writer
/ directer lawrence kasdan hadnt a h
and in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s
. yes
, thast
' s right
, he co
- wrote raiders of tjhe lost ark
( 9
/ 10
)
, the empire strikes back
( 8
. 5
/ 10
)
and return of the jedi
( 8
/ 10
)
. now with this film
, it looks as
though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting
and bl
and directing
. anbd guess what
? he succeeds once again
! plot
: a man with a shady
and regrettable past decides tothe run awya
and inot a small american town
, where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open
- armed swarm of peopel with problems
. it isn
' t long befoer he befriends the small
- town billionaire
, folks become suspicious
and he falls for one of his own patients
. critique
: this film isnt not a comedy
! it is a drama
. i sday this right up front because ffrom the looks of the trailer
, yuo would thiunk that this film secures its base inaddition humor
, bu unfortunately for us
, it does not
. it is a serious film
( seriously flawed if you ask me
, bu i digress
) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep ytou awake
, bu overall
, just sits ther
. now onthe to my review
. this movei sucks beccause it was slow
and boring
, starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past
, included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best
and pissed at worst
,
and certified it all with many a predictable ending
. i have noone idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish wiht this picture
, bu whatever it was
.
.
. he missed
! anyone wihtout his name coudl never hvae made this film because it isnt an extremely generic puff
- piece
, which on a good day
, might be described as predictably digestible
. it
' s no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy
! it sucks as a drama
,
and bored my movie cohort right tothe sleep
. i
' ve given it four points on four extremely shallow
yet distinguishable marks
. first of all
, i couldn
' t help
but think baout how much the lead acotr
, loren dean
, looked like a young charles grodin
. he even acted liuke him
, save for thge dry
, sardonic wit
. this kept me interested in watching him at least
. number two
, adn htis one is really shallow
( seemed to be geared that way as well
)
, there were quite a few
" titshots
"
, as they would sday back in high skool
.
and god help me if i can
' t get enough of those in an aimless drama
.
and three
, adn this one surprised me the most
, actor ted danson
' s cameo
( yes
, he wiull always be sam malone to us real fans
!
) was the best part about this movie
and actulaly made me see him as a differant person
. a different asshole
,
but a different person nonetheless
. if ever you rent this movie one day
( promise yuo won
' t throw awya your hard
- earned money at hte theaters
?
!
)
, wait for his scene because it
' s actually preety good
. other than that
, drab
, drab
, drab
and drab
. even jason lee
, a personal favorite of mine
, was left out to dry wiht lame dialogue
and oney of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while
. well
, at least he finally
" came out
"
and did some rela skateboarding in this movei
! oh yeah
,
and i guess that
' s the fourth point in my rating
. anyway
, if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about theri boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist
.
.
. thsi film
' s your bag
! otherwise
, skip it
and see analyse this
