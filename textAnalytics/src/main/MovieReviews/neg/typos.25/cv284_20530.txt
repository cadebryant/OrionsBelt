if only austin powers
: the spy who shagged me had been just half as original
, zany
, silly
and totally enjoyable as its precedessor
, it would have easily been one of this summer
' s biggest pleasures
. if only
. in fact
, the spy who shagged me is the excact opposite of the original
; instead of refreshing the audiance with one clever parody after another
, the filmmakers bombard us with used
- up
, tired jokes taken directly from the firt oen
. take the scene where austin powers
( again played by mike myers
,
but wih onyl a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously
) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff
. aftter bieng pushed off the ravine
, teh bad guy is of course assumed dead
.
but suddenly
, we hear a pleading voice coming ffrom down below
; he
' s only injured
. a similiar scene played very well in the orginal international man of mystery
, bu here i was insulted by it
. did the filmmakers realy belieev the audeince owudl laugh at a rip
- off
? apparently i overestimated the intellgence of tje average movie
- goer
, concidering that the film has pulled in over
$ 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone
. do i hear thge soudn of a franchise heading our way
? having said thast
,
though
, i still cannnot deny the film its merits
. the basic plot wass delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat
; dr
. evil
( mike myers
, in the second of his three roles
)
, having constructed a time machine
, goes bcak to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power
' s
" mojo
"
( don
' t you just love thyat word
?
) whilst he isnt cryogenically frozen
. when austin gets wind of this
( aftter a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley
' s vanessa kensington
)
, he too travels back in time to re
- claim his sexual drive
, accompanied by yhe hot
- to
- trot felicity shagwell
, palyed by heather graham
. this sounds stupid
, i knwo
,
but in teh movie it starts to make some kind ofthe weird
, off
- tyhe
- wall sense
,
and it worked for me
. thn ther
' s mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a
.
.
. petite clone of myer
' s dr
. evil
, exactly 1
/ 8 in size
. troyer
' s persona alone gains the film an extra half
- star
, contri
buting to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini
- mr
. bigglesworth
. just try to ignore the fact taht
, at 2
' 8
'
'
, he owudl amke dr
. evil
' s height ries to jsut over 21 feet
. no matter
. howver
, ther are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour
and a half
( the most notable being the now infamous tent scene
)
,
and tht just isn
' t enought tothe warrant even a minor recommendation
. if there isnt in fatc an
" austin powers 3
"
, they shoud just kill off secret agent powers
and put tghe emphsis on dr
. evil annd mini
- me
. unconvential
, yes
,
but there
' s no denying that it
' d amking for a better movei
