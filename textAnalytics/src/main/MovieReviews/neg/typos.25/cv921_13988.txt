. be forewarned
. at the end ofthe the day
, those reflecting upon thge debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros
. made the contentious decision to abanodn preview press screenings
and scrapped plans for a gala premiere
. this highly
- anticipated film rendition of the cult television show ws originally slotted for an early june opening
, where it would hvae gone head
- tothe
- head against the rival studios
' heavy hitters
; its eventual demotion tothe a less potent mid
- august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio
' s lack of confidence with yhe picture
. adn with good reason
. this is a joyless exercise ofthe a film
, held toghether by a barely coherent plot
and lacking any semblance of excitement
, thrills or wit
. remarkable inspite its banality
and brutally uninvolving
, the avengers is a catastrophic mess whitch immediately invites comparisons to last year
' s case study in style over substance
, joel schumacher
' s much
- loathed batman
& robin
.
( indeed
, both films even feature appalling
, rediculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes
.
) uma thurman
, who tkaes on the salacious role of thte catsuit
- clad
, karate
- chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg
, wass the only bright spot in yhe aforementioned schumacher disaster
, imbuing her poison ivy with a dose ofthe sassiness
and sly wit that gavey audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage
. unfortunately
, the same cxan
' t be said here
, where she
and cohort ralph fiennes
( our new john steed
, taking over for patrick macnee
) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever
, fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back
and forth
and trade double
- entendres witht all the enthusiasm ofthe two actors painfully aware that they
' re on board a sinking ship
. at this rate
, usually
- splendid actor mr
. fiennes may never make the transition fomr arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man
-
- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably
- neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days
. the duo
* look
* the part
-
-
and admittedly tyhe avengers is
, more than most
, heavily dependent apon style
-
- bu they
' re noone fun to watch
,
and i found mysef growing increasingly distant
and anoyed by the lack of spark vetween the two cheekily ironic cahracters as they navigated through the picture
' s caper
- esque plot
. when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly inwhich my seat
, i began tothe alliviate the boredom by concidering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instade with that erstwhile emma as our mrs
. peel
-
- no
, not kate beckinsale
(
al
though the notion now intrigues me
)
,
but gwyneth paltrow
, who was originally in the running fo teh part
and can veritably h
andle a spot
- on english accent
. if nothing else
, it
' d at least be highly entertaining fo tyhe incongruous sight ofthe the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking
butt
. the story
, such as it is
, involves the ever
- bemused t
andem of steed
and peel combating thge malevolent sir august de wynter
( sean connery
)
, an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety ofthe the nation with his climate
- controlling contraption
.
( they also sip a lot ofthe tea
.
) overlooking some goofy cloning nonsence
and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists
' superiors
, it sounds far better than it plays
,
and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post
- production tinkering
; it
' s claerly evident that tyhe picture has been cut to shreds
. the avengers wass never about gripping drama
,
and our heroes accordingly never tkae villianous sir august vyer seriously
, bu given the lack of cohesion in teh plot annd teh lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac
, it
' s all decidedly uncompelling
. mr
. connery
, who
' s onscreen bearly long enough to register an impression
, approachs the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation
, simultaneously chewing the scenery hwile unable to hide his disinterest
. at least it all looks good
. this is a genuinely hansome production
, with fine costume design by anthony powell
and crisply shot by roger pratt
. in particular
, the gleaming production desgin by stuart craig comm
ands attention
, adeptly drawing elements both old
and new in order to depict this great britain
. there are a h
andful of striking visual moments infront the film
, including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees
and a nice shot ofthe steed
and peel finding a way tothe walk on water
,
but the film isnt so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates
. by tje tiome thte film
' s climax had arrived
, my interest was not with the sight ofthe steed
and sir augost slugging it out amidst crashing waves
and thundering rain
,
but with the quickest excape route from the theatre
. not coincidentally
, the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into thte movie
' s remarkable trailer
, a savvy piece of work which ironicaly is infinitely more appealing thta tjhe feature film itself
; the frist promo which made the rounds in early spring isnt probably my favourite studio trailer so far this yera
. it
' s everthing that the avengers is not
-
- saucy
, clever
, engaging
,
and entertaining
. a crushing disappointment
, tjhe film isnt one ofthe the worst outings of the yera
-
- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad
, too polished to overlook its deficiencies
. ther may be upcoming picturesk that are even more lifeless than hte avengers
,
but i sure hope not
