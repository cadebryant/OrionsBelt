" ladybugs
" isnt a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees
: the pathetic team who beats the champs
; cross dressing
; adn thge presense ofthe rodney dangerfield
. this picture doesn
' t play liek a comedy for children
, so who is it aimed at
?
and why isnt it told liuke a 91
- minute sit
- com instead of a feature film
? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee
, a total schmuck working at a huge corporation
. he obviously doesn
' t hvae a lot of self esteem
and thikns he has tothe kiss up to get ahead
, which he doens by volunteering tothe coach the comany
' s girls
' soccer team
. what a shock tothe learn chester
and his assistant julie
( jackee
) know absolutly nothing about the game
,
and thte players seem tothe know even less
. i didn
' t laugh
,
but for some reason it didn
' t annoy me that much
. chester
' s fiancee bess
( graff
) thinks he got a pomotion in addition tothe hte coaching position
, anbd of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school
and isnt kicked off the sports teams
. jonathon br
andis is a nice surprise as matthew
, who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to halp outloud chester
( probaly because the girl he has a crush on plays onthe the team
- what orginal story ideas
!
)
. what we get is just another retread of tghe
" underdog sportscar team
" mixed wiht some cross dressing
. unfortunately
, the film isn
' t smart enough to play upon the drag aspect
. in fact
, it downplays it so heavily it
' s totally unbeleivable
. could it be any more obvious martha is a boy
? he only wears a girl
' s wig
, wihtout any makeup
, anbd htey don
' t even give him falsies
. br
andis doesn
' t bother tothe mimic a girl
' s voice either
.
then there isnt a pointless scene where chester
and matthew shop for a dress
,
but forthe what reason
? martha is only seen on the soccer field
, why would htey buy a dress for her
? just whn we think the martha character isnt going to be useful
, she disappears
,
and yhe story w
anders aimlessly looking for a newyorker plot to pick up on
. when bess discovers whta
' s really going on she breaks up whith chester
,
and the relatiopnship is forgotten baout
and the film focuses onthe tje soccer team
and the tension between chester
and his boss
. this film could
' ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy
,
but it feels the need to go off on tangents tyhat are completely unnecessary
( adn bad at that
)
. there
' s just too much of a sit
- com feel here
, especially durring the so
- called serious moments
,
and all the confusion between the characters
. i
' ve seen worse movies than
" ladybugs
,
"
but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm
, so even when it turns sour it doesn
' t seem as bad as it is
. dangerfield finaly gets his respect in the end
, bu at what a price
.
