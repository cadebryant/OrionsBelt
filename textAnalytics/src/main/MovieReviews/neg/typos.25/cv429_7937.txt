" ladybugs
" isnt a typical comedy thast relies onthe three supposed guarantees
: the pathetic team who beats thte champs
; cross dressing
;
and the presence of rodney dangerfield
. this picture doesn ' t play liuke a comedy for children
, so who is it aimed at
?
and why is it told liek a 91
- minute sit
- com instead of a feature film
? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee
, a total schmuck working at a huge corporation
. he obviously doesn ' t have a lot of self esteem
and thinks he has tothe kiss up to git ahead
, which he does by volonteering to coach the company ' s girls ' soccer team
. what a shock to learn chester
and his assistant julie
( jackee
) knwo absolutely nothing about the game
,
anbd the players seem to know even less
. i didn ' t laff
,
but for some reason it didn ' t annoy me that much
. chester ' s fiancee bess
( graff
) thikns he got a promotion in adition to the coaching position
,
and of course she has a slacker for a son who is donig poorly in skool
and isnt kicked off tghe sportscar teams
. jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew
, who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha tothe halp outloud chester
( probably because the girl he has a crush onthe plays on tghe team
- what original stopry ideas
!
)
. what we git is just another retread of the
" underdog sportscar team
" mixted with some cross dressing
. unfortunatly
, the film isn ' t smart enough to play upon hte drag aspect
. infront fact
, it downplays it so heavily it ' s totally unbelievable
. could it be any more obvious martha isnt a boy
? he only wears a girl ' s wig
, without any makeup
,
and they don ' t even give him falsies
. brandis doesn ' t bother to mimic a girl ' s voice either
.
then there isnt a pointless scene where chester
and matthew shop forthe a dress
,
but for what reason
? martha isnt only seen on the soccer field
, why would they buy a dress for her
? just wehn we tihkn thge martha character is going tothe be usefull
, she dissapears
,
and the stoyr wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot tothe pik up on
. when bess discovers wqat ' s really going on she breaks uv with chester
,
and tghe relationship is forgotten about
and the film focuses on the soccer team
anbd the tension between chester
and his boss
. tihs film coudl ' ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy
,
but it fiels the ened to go off onthe tangents tht are completely unnecessary
(
and bad at that
)
. ther ' s just too much ofthe a sit
- com fiel here
, especialy druing the so
- called serious moments
,
and all the confusion between the characters
. i ' ve seen worse movies than
" ladybugs
,
"
but forthe soem reason it contained some sort ofthe bizarre charm
, so even when it turns sour it doesn ' t seem as bad as it is
. dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end
,
but at what a price
.
