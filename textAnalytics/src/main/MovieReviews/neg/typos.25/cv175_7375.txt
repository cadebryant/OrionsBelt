capsule
: one of the ten worst movies ever made
. christopher lambert vs
. evil ninjas in modern
- day japan
.
.
. anbd nobody wins
. the hunted is such a bad movie
, so completely inept
and so totally brain
- damaged that i sould almost fiel affection fo it
. i could see myself showing this movei to friends anbd getting a good jolly guffaw out of it
, if it weren
' t also insanely xenophobic
and insulting
. christopher lambert plays a computer
- parts salesman who
' s onthe business in japan
. he meets a slinky young woman
( joan chen
)
and has a torrid night of lovemaking wih her
-
-
and
then manages to witness her death at the h
ands of an evil ninja clan anbd their leader
( john lone
)
. aparently they hadnt some unfinished business thyat could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered
. usance lambert is a wittness
, he
' s of course tjhe next one to die
. let
' s stop
and think about this fo a second
. if lambert were in real life bieng chased by fanatical devotees tothe a ninja secret society
, he
' d have a lifespan you could onyl mesure with an atomic clock
. in this movie
, the ninja manage tothe kill just baout everyone except him
. i imagin the japanese gods smiled down on lambert
and provided him with a goof feeld that radiates outloud baout ten feet from his body
. yuo know what a goof field isnt
: that invisible zone inwhich which anyone who has intent to do harm to yuo becomes a klutz no matter what theri real dexterity is
. this is
, of course
, onyl the beginning of hte movie
' s problems
. lambert eventially finds pseudo
- safty with a long
- haired modern
- day samurai
( yoshio harada
)
and his partner
-
- yoko shimada
, who yuo may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun
. they are the two best things in the movie
; in every scene they have autority
and presence
,
and tehy actualyl look liuke they belong here
, even when dressed in full samurai armor
and wielding bows
. tjhe scirpt doesn
' t know what thge hell to do with them
. lone
, as the bad guy
, is zero
- dimentional
. the onyl bad
- guy cliche he has tothe wallow around inwhich is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off ofthe him
. in the hunted
, this isnt elevated to the levle of an insulting stereotype
. wqat
' s funny is that the peripheral characters in hte hunted are not sterotypes
-
- there
' s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver
,
and a girl in a pachinko parlor
-
- bu many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful
. aslo
, the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack
-
- git the cd
-
- that manages to survive despite the drek it
' s been designed to accompany
. htere is an extended battle scene in yhe middle of the movei that is alomst reason enought tothe watch teh whole thing
-
- a gory
, excellently staged fight onthe thge bullet train that shows smoe rela imagination for a moent
, adn
then smothers it by trying to clumsily re
- couple thte whole thing with the movei
' s relentlessly stupid plot
. by the tiem we get tothe the fianl showdown
, witht lambert getting to weild his own sword
( which
, judging from the ham
- h
anded editting ofthe one scene
, was forged inspite seven housr or so
)
, we no longer care
. we
' re not even given any definitive infomation about whether or not oen of the key cahracters lives or dies
! someone once said that tje key to good art
-
- good movies
, good books
, whatever
-
- is to start somwhere interesting
, end up somewhere interesting
,
and show respect for the audience all along the way
. this movei bungles two outloud of three
, badly
.
