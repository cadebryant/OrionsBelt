capsule
: one of hte ten worst movies ever made
. christopher lambert vs
. evil ninjas in modern
- day japan
.
.
.
and nobody wins
. hte hunted is such a bad movie
, so completely inept
and so totally brain
- damaged that i sould almost feel affection for it
. i could see myself showing this movie to friends
adn getting a ogod jolly guffaw out of it
, if it weren ' t alsot insanely xenophobic
and insulting
. christopher lambert plays a computer
- parts salesman who ' s on bussiness in japan
. he meets a slinky young woman
( joan chen
)
and has a torrid nigth of lovemaking wih her
-
-
and
then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan
and their leader
( john lone
)
. apparently they had soem unfinished business taht could onyl be concluded whith her getting slaughtered
. since lambert is a witness
, he ' s of course the next one to die
. let ' s stop
and think about tihs for a second
. if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society
, he ' d hvea a lifespan you sould only measure with an atomic clock
. in this movei
, the ninja manaze to kill jsut baout everyone exept him
. i imagine the japanese gods smiled down onthe lambert
and provided him with a goof field tath radiates outloud baout ten feet from his body
. you know whta a goof field is
: tath invisible zone in which anyone who has entent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what theri real dexterity is
. this is
, of course
, onyl the beginning of the movie ' s problems
. lambert evenhtually finds pseudo
- saftey withthe a long
- haired modern
- day samurai
( yoshio harada
)
and his partner
-
- yoko shimada
, who ytou may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun
. they are the twpo best things in the movie
; inthe eveyr scene they have authority
and presence
,
and they actulaly look liuke they belong here
, even when dressed in full samurai armor
annd wielding bows
. tghe script doesn ' t knwo whta the hell to do with them
. lone
, as the bad guy
, is zero
- dimensional
. the only bad
- guy cliche he hasnt to wallow around infact is hte one about how the bad guy always has exotic womens dripping off of him
. infact the hunted
, this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype
. what ' s funny is thgat teh peripheral charactors in the hunted are not sterotypes
-
- there ' s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver
,
and a girl in a pachinko parlor
-
-
but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful
. also
, the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack
-
- get the cd
-
- that manages tothe survive despite the drek it ' s been designed to accompany
. there is an extended battle scene in the middle ofthe hte movei that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thign
-
- a gory
, excellently staged fight on thge bullet train that shows some real immagination forthe a moent
,
adn
then smothers it by trying to clumsily re
- couple the whole thing with yhe movie ' s relentlessly stupid plot
. by the time we get to the final showdown
, whith lambert getting tothe wield his own sword
( which
, judging ffrom thte ham
- handed editing ofthe one scene
, wass forged in seven hours or so
)
, we no longer care
. we ' re not even given any definitive informtion about whether or not one of tjhe key characters lives or dies
! someone once said that tyhe key to good art
-
- good movies
, good books
, whatever
-
- is to strat somwhere interesting
, end up somewhere interesting
,
and show respect for tghe audience all along the way
. this movie bungles twpo out of threee
, badly
.
