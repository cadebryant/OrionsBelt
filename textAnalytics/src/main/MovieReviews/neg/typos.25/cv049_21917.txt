. rated r
. teh legend of 1900s is the year
' s most absurd movie
, a rambling
, nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast
. it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth
, looking wistful as ever
, as a guy named
.
.
. 1900
. you heard right
. his name is
, in all actuality
, 1900
. he was born on an ocean liner onthe 1
/ 1
/ 1900
( uh
, hence the name
)
, ab
andoned
and adopted by danny
, a ship crewman
. 1900 spends most of his early years hiding inaddition the bowels of thte ship because ofthe danny
' s fear tht he might be taken away ffrom him becasue of
" visa matters
.
" well
, whn 1900 isnt about 9 or so
, he starts wondering all around the ship
. one day
, he discovers a gr
and piano
. he sits down
and starts playing
. miraculously
, what comes out is beautiful
. a group of onlookers gathers to watch htis stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age
. when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him tath his playing the piano liek that without permission is
" totally against regulations
" 1900 replies
" f
* ck the regulations
!
" ho ho ho
. 1900 grows up never setting foot on dry l
and
. whn he
' s baout 30ish
and can play yhe piano like nobody
' s bussines
, onboard comes another musician
. his name isnt max
( pruitt taylor vince
) annd he plays the trumpet
. after 1900 catchs max barfing everywhere durring a storm
, he sits him down on tje piano next to him
, takes the piano
' s braces off
and plays while the piano flies all around the hall
, taking them with it
. how the chair they
' re sitting on
and the piano don
' t separate
, i don
' t know
,
but this apparently isn
' t the kind ofthe thnig we
' re suppossed to ask
. after that
, 1900
and max become firends
. max is determined tothe get 1900 off tghe ship annd dicover waht he is missing on l
and
,
but 1900 hasnt no intention ofthe doign so
. what
' s mroe
, he doesn
' t even want his music to go anywhere wihtout him
: whn a record comapany hears baout his talents
, they come on board to make a record of his music
,
but after finding out thast
-
- gasp
!
-
- they
' re gonig to make millions of copies
, he breaks teh rocord
. the conflict of the movie isnt that after max
, unsucessful infact his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship
, gets off himself
, he stumbles upon a record of 1900
' s music inwhich a store
. the record shouldn
' t exist becouse a
) 1900 never stepped on dry l
and
and b
) the oney record tht was made on tje ship was broken
. ladies anbd gentlemen
, it
' s a mystery
! yhe tsory itself isnt ludicrous
and uninteresting adn so are its elements
. we
' re supposted to be roused by a climactic
.
.
. piano duel
? there isn
' t anything inwhich htis movie with the potential tothe compel
. 1900 comes off as a whiny
, brooding
, extemely unlikable man
: i can
' t recall a single owrd he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo
- meditation on life
. ditto for max
, who doesn
' t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900
. tim roth plays 1900 with baout as much panache as a fig lief
; ther
' s no spirit
, noone gusto to the charachter
. he insists that he leads a hapyp life on thte ship
,
but to us he is dead
. pruitt taylor vince is a littel omre palatable
, at least providing a moent of comic relief here annd there to liven thnigs up a bit
. the highlight ofthe tghe movei would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant
, leering
" king ofthe jazz
" who challenges 1900 to tyhe aforementioned piano duel
. hte legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore
, whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many
. this affort is utterly limp
and lifeless
. at once rediculous
, boring
, narrow
- sighted
and pointless
, htis is oen movie thast should be
-
- anbd wiull be
-
- quickly forgotten
.
