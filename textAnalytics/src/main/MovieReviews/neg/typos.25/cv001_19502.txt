the happy bastard
' s quick movie review damn that y2k bug
. it
' s got a head start inthe tihs movie starring jamie lee curtis
and another baldwin brother
( william this time
) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes acros a deserted russian tech ship that hasnt a strangeness tothe it when they kick the pwoer back on
. littel do they know the power within
.
.
. going for yhe gore
and bringing on a few acation sequences here
and ther
, virus still fiels very empty
, like a movie oging for all flash
and no substance
. we don
' t know why the crew was really out in thte middle of nowhere
, we don
' t know the orgin of what tookover over the ship
( just that a big pink flashy thing hitted teh mir
)
,
and
, of course
, we don
' t know why donald sutherl
and is stumbling around drunkenly throughout
. here
, it
' s just
" hey
, let
' s chase theese peple around with smoe robots
"
. teh acting isnt below average
, even ffrom tghe likes ofthe curtis
. you
' re omre likely tothe get a kick out of her work in halloween h20
. sutherl
and is wasted
and baldwin
, well
, he
' s acting like a baldwin
, of course
. the real star here are stan winston
' s robot design
, smoe schnazzy cgi
,
and the occasionall good gore shot
, liuke picking into someone
' s brain
. so
, if robots
and body parts really turn yuo on
, here
' s your movie
. otherwise
, it
' s pretty much a sunken ship ofthe a movie
.
