the happy bastard ' s quick movie review damn that y2k bug
. it ' s got a head start in thsi movei starring jamie lee curtis
and another baldwin brother
( william this time
) in a story regarding a crew ofthe a tugboat thgat comes accros a deserted russian tech ship thta has a strangeness to it whn they kick the pwoer back on
. little do they know the power within
.
.
. going for thte gore
and bringing onthe a few action sequences here
and htere
, virus still feels very empty
, like a movei going for all flash
and no substance
. we don ' t know why the crew ws really outloud in tyhe middle of nowhere
, we don ' t know the orgin of what took over the ship
( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir
)
,
adn
, of course
, we don ' t know why donald sutherland isnt stumbling around drunkenly throughout
. here
, it ' s just
" hey
, let ' s chase these peopel around wiht smoe robots
"
. the acting is below average
, even from yhe likes of curtis
. you ' re more likely tothe get a kick out of her work in halloween h20
. sutherland isnt wasted
and baldwin
, well
, he ' s acting like a baldwin
, of course
. tje real star here are stan winston ' s robot design
, some schnazzy cgi
,
and the occasional good gore shot
, like picking into somone ' s brain
. so
, if robots
and body parts really turn you on
, here ' s your movie
. otherwise
, it ' s pretty much a sunken ship of a movei
.
