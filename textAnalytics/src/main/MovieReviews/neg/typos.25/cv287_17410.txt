tv ' s buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in
" simpley irresistible
.
" sarah michelle gellar
, that never
- ceasing crusader against never
- ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network
, here plays a down
- on
- her
- luck chef suspected ofthe dabbling infront witchcraft after her flailing restauant receives help infront tyhe form of magically scrumptious meals
. taste test results
: soem vampire slaying
,
though out of place
, would have really livened this excrutiating movie up
.
" simpley irresistible
" is actually quite easy to deny
, a diaster of culinary
and otehr proportions pretty much fomr tje opening onthe
. gellar ' s amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom
( sean patrick flannery ofthe powder
) arround the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking
, a secret ingredient thta arouses both his interest in her
and the public ' s in her tiny tribeca eatery
. all this love
and sorcery haev a lot tothe dont with thge telekinetic crab that also figures inot tyhe story
, a tale thgat at times plays like an american spin on 1993 ' s mexican classic
" like water for chocolate
.
" several differences
: one
,
" like water
" didn ' t hvea a telekinetic crab
,
annd two
,
" like water
" was a good film
.
" simply irresistible
,
" on tghe other hand
, is about as chalenging as an eazy
- bake oven
. amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other outloud in their badness
, from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog tothe an impromptu dance sequence where tom
and amanda do theri best fred
and ginger
-
though fred
annd ginger never took part in anything tihs garish
. the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals
,
but it ' s nto like you ' re were gogin to miss much
. infront fact
, take away the few instances ofthe salty language
annd htis has made
- for
- disney channel written all over it
.
but a majority ofthe
" simply irresistible
" ' s resistibility factor has less to do wiht the afore
- mentioned overkill than the bland leads
- tom
and amanda are so thin
and ambiguously defined that htere ' s just no fun rooting for their inevitable
" happily ever after
.
" nor do tjhe otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together mkae sence
, so we ' re left with a ho
- hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs
; it ' s nto goign to last long
, peple
. perhaps sensing tihs
, hte filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters forthe acting vets like betty buckley
, dylan baker
and patricia clarkson
,
bu they don ' t go anywhere either
. in fact
, nothing in
" simply irresistible
" goes anywhere save fo gellar
,
and she doesn ' t go somwhere so much as you wish she ' d go
_ somwhere
_
- like to a better movei
. already proving major talent wtih relatively few big
-
and small
- screen roles
, she ' s the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn ' t completely ift for hte garbage disposal
, looking smashing in her todd oldham
- designed duds
and investing much omre in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return
. it ' s certainly a dish best nto served inthe it ' s current condidtion
,
but one can onyl guess that
, without gellar
,
" simply irresistable
" would be strictly unwatchable
.
