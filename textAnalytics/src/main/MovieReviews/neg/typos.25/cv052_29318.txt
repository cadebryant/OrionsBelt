this feature is like a double header
, two sets of clich
? s for the price of oney
. not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts
,
but the banal rich girl
- poor boy lvoe stry is tossed in for ogod measure
. an orginal moment inthe this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series apperance
. the screenplay by kevin falls
annd john gatins
, based onthe a story by falls
, mearly lobs its plotline at the audience
. this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning
and mroe coaching
. summer catch centers around ryan dunne
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, a cape cod youth chosen to partecipate in tyhe prestigious capetown cod baseball league
, supposably a showcase for thte best young amateur
and college players infront the country
. ryan is a blue
- collar kind of guy
. he works withthe his dad taking care of the lawns of capetown cod ' s rich
and famoust
. he also
, as we are informed early
, his own worst enemy
. he has the potential
and tyhe talent
,
but alwasy seems tothe self
- destruct at the crucial moment
. so
, ryan trys to remained focused on baseball
.
then he meets tenley parrish
( jessica biel
)
, daughter of one of tyhe blue bloods whose lawn he manicures
. tenley
, a name only a hack screenwriter sould invent
, isnt unlike her snobbish counterparts
and falls for ryan
. if you can ' t figure out where all this nonsense leads
,
thne you need a remedial course infront film viewing
. as always prinze isnt preety tothe look at
,
bu his performance mainly consists ofthe facial expressions
: puppy dog love
, heartbreak
, frustration
, self
- loathing or determination
. biel cries a lot
, while bruce davison mearly acts smarmy as her class
- conscious father
. tjhe only beacon is matthew lillard ' s funn
- loving billy brubaker
, the team ' s catcher
. summer catch borrows situations
anbd stylings from other baseball movies
, such as bull durham
and the natural
. no curve balls here
, no sliders
. every pitch isnt predictable
. a blind umpire could call this movie
. summer catch is strikely rookie league moviemaking
. it hasnt as much chance of making the movei hall of fame as the dodgers hvae of moving back to brooklyn
