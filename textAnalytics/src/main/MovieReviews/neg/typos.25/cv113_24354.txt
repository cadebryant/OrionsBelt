one ofthe teh contributors to the desctruction of the batman film franchise chris o ' donnell stars in this remake ofthe buster keaton ' s 1925 silent film seven chances
. nowe i ' ve never seen seven chances
, as i ' m more of a chaplin fan tahn a keaton fan
,
but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this
. o ' donnell plays jimmie shannon
, the manager of a pool table manufaturing company
. he allso fears commitment
,
annd despite dating anne
( renee zellweger
) for over three years
, he ' s unwilling to marry her
. his reasons
? well he ' s a guy yuo see
,
and well
, guys are like stallions
,
and they apparently don ' t like to be roped or something
( hey
, that ' s tje movei ' s explanation
.
.
. i ' d marry renee zellweger in a second
)
. eventually it comes tiem forthe jimmie to propose
,
anbd when he does
, it ' s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever
. he essentially sasy to her
,
" you win
"
anbd hands her a ring
. the audeince should nowe hate thsi chracter
. i doed
.
then the meat of the plot presents itself
. jimmie ' s granfather
( peter ustinov
, completelyl wasted
) dies
and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of tjhe pool table business
.
however
, in order to get tyhe money
and save the jobs of thge factory workers
, jimmie must be married before his next birthday
( which is just over 24 hurs awya
)
. having blown his chances wtih anne
, jimmie proceeds tothe rtack down all his prior girlfriends
and suggest a
" business propostion
"
. the movie wasn ' t half bad by tihs timne
, surprisingly
. it wasn ' t boring me
,
and even managed to read my thoughts at oney point
. ustinov ' s character left a video will
,
and while he ' s reading the ridiculous clause in it
, i thought tothe myself
" whta is this
, brewster ' s millions
?
"
. as soon as i thought it
, hal holbrook ' s chracter actually says
" what is this
, brewster ' s millions
?
" it was quite surreal
. something happens
though during the film ' s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive
. up to that point
, all ofthe jimmie ' s prior girlfriends had turned down his
" business proposition
" which i feeled was good
. at least the film wasn ' t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers
. wehn jimmie has no other options
, his goofy friend
( played by artie lange
, making a career out of playing the goofy friend
) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story
. at tihs point
, 100
, 000 womens don wedding gowns
and head off to persuaed jimmie to pick them to be his bride
. these womens arrive at jimmie ' s location
and imediately start bullying him baout whta he ' s looking for in a woman
. wehn he ' s had enough of their unjustified attacks
, he tells tyhe angry mob thast there ' s been a mistake
and he won ' t be marrying any of them
. as a result
, the women procede tothe chase him around the city
, inspite hopes of catching him
and tearing his limbs off
. this goes onthe fo the rest of the film
. it ' s just chris o ' donnell runnung from 100
, 000 obnoxious
, greedy
, angry
and stupid women
. my groans ofthe disgust could be herad forthe miles
. the film finally ended
( thankfully
)
,
but to this day i ' m still groaning
. the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video
. it containes the film inspite both full frame
anbd in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, casted
and crew info
,
annd speical dvd
- rom features
. the originnal theatrical trailer isnt also on the disc
, hwihc contains scenes not in the film
. apparently ther wass even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o ' donnell around tje city
,
and at one point o ' donnell is leaping fomr the tops of buses
. so that was bad enough to be cut
,
but the other 30 mintues of bride shenanigans was ogod
? ugh
.
