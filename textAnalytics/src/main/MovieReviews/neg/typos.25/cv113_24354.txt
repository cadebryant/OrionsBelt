oney of the contri
butors to tghe distruction of the batman film franchise chris o
' donnell stars in tihs remake ofthe buster keaton
' s 1925 silent film seven chances
. nowe i
' ve never seen seven chances
, as i
' m omre of a chaplin fan thna a keaton fan
,
but i seriously dout that hte classic version could be as insipid as this
. o
' donnell plays jimmie shannon
, the manager of a pool table manufacturing company
. he also fears commitment
,
and dispite dating anne
( renee zellweger
) forthe over three years
, he
' s unwilling tothe marry her
. his reasons
? well he
' s a guy you see
, adn well
, guys are liuke stallions
,
and they apparently don
' t like to be roped or something
( hey
, that
' s the movie
' s explanation
.
.
. i
' d marry renee zellweger in a second
)
. eventually it comes tiome for jimmie to propose
,
and whn he doesnt
, it
' s tghe most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever
. he essentially says to her
,
" you win
"
and h
ands her a ring
. the audience should now hate htis carachter
. i did
.
then the meat of the plot presents itself
. jimmie
' s granfather
( peter ustinov
, completely wasted
) dies annd leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table busness
.
however
, inaddition order to git the monay
and save the jobs of the factory workers
, jimmie must be married before his next birthday
( which is jstu over 24 hurs away
)
. having blown his chances with anne
, jimmie procedes to track down all his prior girlfriends
and suggest a
" busineses proposition
"
. the movie wasn
' t half bad by tihs time
, surprisingly
. it wasn
' t boring me
,
and even managed to read my
thoughts at oney point
. ustinov
' s character left a video will
,
and hwile he
' s reading hte ridiculous clause in it
, i
thought to myself
" whta isnt this
, brewster
' s millions
?
"
. as soon as i
thought it
, hal holbrook
' s character actually says
" what is this
, brewster
' s millions
?
" it wass quite surveill
. something happens
though durring the film
' s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive
. uv to tath point
, all of jimmie
' s prior girlfriends had turned down his
" buisness proposition
" which i falt was good
. at least tje film wasn
' t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers
. when jimmie has noone other options
, his goofy freind
( played by artie lange
, mkaing a career out of playing the goofy firend
) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story
. at this point
, 100
, 000 women don wedding gowns
and head off tothe persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride
. theese women arrive at jimmie
' s location
and immediately start bullying him about wqat he
' s looking for infront a woman
. when he
' s had enough of their unjustified attacks
, he tells the angry mob that ther
' s been a misteek
and he won
' t be marrying any of them
. as a result
, the women proceed to chase him aroud tje city
, in hopes of catching him
and tearing his limbs off
. htis goes on for the rest of thge film
. it
' s just chris o
' donnell running from 100
, 000 obnoxious
, greedy
, angry
and stupid women
. my groans of disgust could be heared for miles
. the film finally ended
( thankfully
)
, bu tothe tihs day i
' m still groaning
. tyhe bachelor is available onthe dvd from new line home video
. it containes the film in both full frome annd in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, casted
and crew info
,
and speical dvd
- rom features
. the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc
, which contains scenes not in the film
. apparently there was even moreso footage of the gang of brides chasing o
' donnell around the city
,
and at one point o
' donnell is leaping fomr the tops ofthe buses
. so that was bad enough to be cutted
,
but yhe otehr 30 mintues of bride shenanigans was good
? ugh
.
