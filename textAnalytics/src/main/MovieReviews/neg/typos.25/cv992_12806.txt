. comments
: allow me to state for the record that i fidn daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies
. she proved quite charming as the inteligent astronomer in tjhe romantic comedy roxanne
and equally creepy as pris in the sci
- fi classic blade runner
. the clan of hte cave bear clearly trys tothe captialize onthe hannah as a selling point
: the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint
and yhe video box prominently features her name inspite lettering hte same size as the title
. not even her starring role inthe this turkey
, unfortunately
, cin save it from being an unbelievable exercise iin cheese
. it
' s so uniquely bad
( a film dealing whith prehistoric man thyat actually trys
, anbd miserably fails
, to be serious
) that it
' s oddly fascinating
. teh ridiculous attept at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed
, wanting to see how this dud plays out
. the clan of tyhe cave bear is based upon a populare novel by jean m
. auel
. to tihs day
, the book possesses a loyal cult follwoing
. i remeber a dear friend ofthe mine had a dog
- eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so
- called dirty parts blacked outloud with marker by her gr
andmother
. i have never read thsi book
,
but i sure hope it
' s 10
, 000 times better thna its film adaptation
. if nto
,
then i
' m at a complete loss to explain its popularity
. the clan of tyhe cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene
. a young ayla
, looking much like drew barrymore in e
. t
.
, tramps about in tjhe woods
. witht her cute little ponytails
and fur wrapped baout her
, the audience
' s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediatly shattered
. what follows isnt a laughably choreographed sequence infact which an earthquake swallows up ayla
' s mother
( a blonde with fur pants
.
.
. er
, leggings
)
. tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes thge camera
.
.
. well
, as the earthquake slowly recedes
. a hungry lion becomes intersted iin her for lunch
, bu yhe screaming six
- eyar
- old manages to outrun the king of yhe wild anbd find a safe haven
. i won
' t detail the tsory any further
; tihs seems enough to illustrate my point
. this movie is really stupid
. it never even gives the audiance a chance to suspend theri disbelief
. allso
, the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro
- magnon man in prehistory
and the ries of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston
. the movei doesn
' t just suggest this message
; it whacks the message inot the audiance with a two
- by
- four
. a blond
, gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people infact gaudy brown wigs
. she
' s of the
" new people
"
; they
' re ofthe teh
" old people
" witht
" the memories
.
" yep
. we git it
. we git it
. thte clan of the cave bear aparently received an academy award nomination for best mkae
- uv
, which surprises me
. the movie depends upon a lot ofthe make
- uv obviously
,
but much of it isnt unconvincing
. as stated before
, daryl hannah isnt daryl hannah here
; she looks liek she just stepped outloud of the shower all the time
. the rest ofthe tjhe characters have dark make
- up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt
. the face
- painting thta
' s occasionally seen isnt perhaps the only notable work here in my mind
. this movie allso suffers from its new age trappings
. maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985
,
but now it sounds dated
and cliched
, liek poorly conceived elevator music
. add tothe this the film
' s faux
- mysticism
, including spirit animals
and dream visions
,
and a narrator who sounds like a psychic yuo
' d expect tothe hear on a 1
- 900 number
,
and ytou get a movie that has sereous problems being sereous
. the clan ofthe the cave bear is rated r
,
though it
' s probably one ofthe the most inoffensive offensive films i
' ve seen iin quite a while
. it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity
. the voilence mostly consists ofthe hunting scenes
. the funniest moment of tje movie occurs when a ne
anderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear
. hte bear bites his head off
and the audiance sees it rolling baout
.
al
thought this may sound gratuitous
, i
' m sure
, it
' s so cheesy that it probably won
' t bother most people
. the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie
.
however
, as i wroet at the beginning of this review
, it does have the distinction of originality
. typically when i think ofthe bottom
- of
- the
- barrel films dealing withthe early man
, fantasy movies involving dinosaurs
( who did not exist at the same time as man
)
and raquel welch come to mind
. the clan ofthe the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that
,
though it
' s so bad
, the audience is still intersted by tjhe unique setting
and characters of the movie
( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars
)
. i haev to htink thta fans ofthe the book would be disappointed with this film version
;
however
, i
' m only basing this observation on the fatc that the book is allmost invariably better tahn the movie
. i shudder to htink that it could be otherwise
.
