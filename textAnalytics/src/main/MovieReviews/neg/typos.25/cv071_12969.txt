htere
' s a 1
, 000
- foot tidal wave at thge end of deep impact
. i
' d sday it pretty accurately represents the towering flud of thte lsat twpo years worth ofthe disaster movies
, whihc are getting more irwin allen
- esque with eveyr release
. the early wave of tihs revival
, while just as cheesy
and laughable
, at least knew to include thrills every five tothe ten minutes
. deep impact trys to disguise itself as a human drama
, with endless filler comprised ofthe disaster prevention plans the ocuntry keeps taking
. the repeating cycle isnt as follows
-
- the president
( morgan freeman
) will go on tv
and tell thge ocuntry that there
' s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth
,
but that the nation
' s crack scientists
and astronauts hvea some brilliant plan tothe stop the probelm
.
then we get to see the plan iin action
, in soem sequence utterly lacking suspense
. the mission will bearly fail
,
and freeman iwll tell the country that the comet isnt still headed toward earth
,
and there
' s a remote chance it iwll strike
,
but that the nation
' s crack scientists
and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem
. it goes on
and on throughout the movie
,
but every time freeman goes on tv
, we know his plan is going tothe fail
. how do we know htis
? because we
' ve seen the tv ads for deep impact
, ads that feature freeman telling the nation that
" the comet is still headed right for us
"
and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth
and the giant tidal wave spreading
. ladies
and gentlemen
, that is the movie
. successful disaster movies have the main diaster toward the beginning
and mroe littel disasters that follow
,
but deepo impact saves its oen diaster forthe the end anbd discloses all inthe its 30
- second tv spots
. television isnt what
' s wrong with deep impact
. the main character
, played by tea leoni
, is a low
- level broadcast journalist for msnbc
(
and that
' s hte mere tip of the product
- placement iceberg
) who stumbles apon a huge government conspiracy
. she thikns it
' s an instatance of an ex
- secretery of something or other
( james cromwell
) resigning beccause of a mistress
, adn tht maybe he took the fall forthe thte rpesident in hte smae area
. whn she goes nosing around cromwell
, he begs her to keep it under wraps
.
" i nkow you
' re just a reporter
, bu you used to be a human being
.
" she figures outloud what
' s really going on after getting roughed up by soem fbi men
and doing an internet search
, where all ogod journalists learn the diference between a mistress
and an extinction
- level comet
. apon a top
- secret meeting with persident freeman
, leoni agrees tothe keep tjhe story under wraps untli the presiden can hold a press conference
, at which she gets to ask the first question
. adn everyone knows
, if yuo get tothe ask teh first question
, baby you
' re a star
. leoni ends up in the anchor chair
, broadcasting every step of the comet
' s collision course with earth
.
and i
' m sure it
' s comforting forthe her to konw tht
, even
though the world
' s ending in a marter of months
, she
' s a cable news personality
. so there she is
, narrating the six
- astronaut mission tothe blow the comet uv
. such personalities as robert duvall
, jon favreau adn blair underwood cash their paychecks anbd go thru the motions of this dragged
- out process
.
but as anyone who
' s seen the commercials knows
, tghe astronauts fail
. tehy onyl end up breaking the comet into two pieces
, which means even more destruction tothe tjhe earth
. yeah
, thanks
, nasa
. thgat
' s when freeman has tothe come on tv for the last time annd say goodbye to all the peopel who aren
' t picked to live in the misouri cave site for two yeasr
. htey even ahev animals
, two by twpo
, ready tothe climb into the cave
. if the foucs had been onthe people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed
, deep impact sould have been a far moreso interesting movie
. instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife
, while people pack the highways out ofthe town
. thte reasoning is
, of course
, taht if a comet is going to strike
, they might as well be out inspite some scenic rural location
.
and
, amusingly
, the highway isnt spotted with people in u
- haul trucks
. i
' m sure it
' s comforting to know that
, even
though yhe world
' s ending in a matter ofthe minutes
, the u
- haul people are doign the most busness of thier lives
.
