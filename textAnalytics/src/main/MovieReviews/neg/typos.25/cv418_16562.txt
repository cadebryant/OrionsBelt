" payback
,
" brian helgel
and
' s inauspicious directing de
but
( coincidentally
, he previously penned teh award
- winning screenplay for 1997
' s
" l
. a
. confidential
"
)
, is a wildly uneven
and thoroughly unplesant revenge thriller that takes one idea
-
-
- a movie with non
- stop violence
, death
,
and villains
-
-
-
and runs with it
, or should i say
, barely manages to crawl away with it
. mel gibson
, infact
yet another disappointing picture
(
" conspiracy theory
" annd
" lethal weppon 4
,
" anyone
?
)
, stars as the reprehensible villain
/ hero
, porter
, a man who becomes determined to get his 50
% share of
$ 140
, 000
, which he stole in a robbery
, back when his partner
- in
- crime
( gregg henry
)
and drug
- addicted wife
( deborah kara unger
) doublely
- cross him
, shoot him
, anbd leave him for dead
. porter is not dead
, howver
-
-
- not by a long shot
-
-
- as he quickly rehabilitates
and
, along with his loyal prositute girlfriend
, rosie
( maria bello
)
, sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay
. yhe tagline for
" payback
" is
,
" get ready tothe root for the bad guy
,
"
and sure enough
, this is true
, as pretty much every significant character who appears isnt crooked infact some way
. i wouldn
' t have a probelm with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin stry had beeen of any interest
,
but it wasn
' t
,
and therefore
, i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array ofthe charater that have absolutly noone redeeming qualities whatsoever
. no attemp is made to flesh the roles into three
- dimesnional characters
,
and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity inwhich them
. just because the protagonist
, a
" bad guy
,
" isnt played by mel gibson doesn
' t mean i will
" root for him
,
"
and i didn
' t
. qtuie the contrary
, every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death
( all
though some of them did
, anyway
, just to spice up teh dull procedings
)
. since none ofthe the respectable actors in
" payback
" actually have human beings to play
, only one performance managed tothe st
and out
. lucy alexis liu
( ofthe t
. v
.
' s
" ally mcbeal
"
)
, who plays a spicy s
& m dominatrix
, brightens up every scene she is in
,
and hasnt a definite flair for comedy
, something i would have liked to ahev seen more of
, usance most of the humor fell wiht a resounding splat
. meanwhile
, gibson
, who isnt perfectly fine here
, sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging
. unger
, who made an impression infact 1997
' s
" the game
,
" is surprisingly wasted
and it isnt difficult to see why she tookover such a part since she disappears ten minutes inthe
,
and only has two purproses
:
( 1
) to get high on heroin
, anbd
( 2
) because she plays a key part in an early flashback
. fianlly
, kris kristofferson appears inspite a throwaway role during the climax
,
and htis unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb
( tellingly
, he didn
' t appear in the original cutted of thge film
,
but was cast when extensive reshoots tookover place months later
)
. like most acation movies
, the star oftenly takes a licking bu keesh on ticking
. inthe tjhe course ofthe the 102
- minute running tyme ofthe
" payback
,
" porter is shot three times in the bcak
, hit by a van
, beaten up
, annd has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer
.
and guess whta
? nto only does he survive the wohle ordeal
, bu he is happy
- go
- lucky in the penultimate sequence
(
and can still walk
!
)
, even
though he looks like he hadnt recently substituded for a punching bag
.
" payback
" is nto
, in any way
, an entertaining film
, even
though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all tyhe graphic carnage thyat goes on
, bu tkae away that violence
and what you are basicly left with is a blank screen
. perhaps director helgel
and would have been smart tothe consider htis
, so he could have at least added a fewd worthwhile elements
, like a fresh storyline
and characters whom you sould even remotely st
and tothe be around for a few hours
.
