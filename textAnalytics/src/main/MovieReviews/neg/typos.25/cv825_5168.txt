if anyone had beeen able in 1983 tothe forsee a lite
- night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some ofthe the worst films ofthe the 80
' s
, tehy
' d agree d
. c
. cab isnt the quintessential
" usa up all nite
" movie
. it
' s oen of those childish r
- rated movies that kids would love
but cxan
' t see until it
' s edited for tv
. it
' s also oen of those pointless
, almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs
.
and
, strike three
, it pairs mr
. t with gary busey
. i herad gilbert say d
. c
. cab had
" an all
- star casted
,
"
but i
' m still hoping ther was some degree of facetiousness in that statement
. whn thrid
- billing goes to a two
- minute appeareance by famed flashdancer irene cara
" as herself
,
" you can
' t sday a damn thnig baout all
- star casts
. likewise forthe token appearences by marsha
" roz
" warfield
, paul rodriguez
and
" politically incorrect
" host bill maher
, before he was somebody
. appearing in d
. c
. cab pretty much had tyhe oposite effect on everyone esle
, especially irene
" i
' m gonna live forever
" cara
. d
. c
. cab is an ansamble comedy from joel schumacher
( who would go on to direct batman forever
) about a bunch ofthe misfits who drive cabs
. you git the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice
, this woudl be yhe result
, except here you ahev such interesting characters as the
" token white guy
"
( busey
) who whants to git inwhich tight whith the blacks now befoer they take over the world
, yhe tolkein jive talker named tyrone
( charlie barnett
) who wears his hair in rollers
and uses the word
" honkey
" as much as possible
, the tough guy iwth the mohawk
and gold chains
( mr
. t
-
- a real stretch for him
)
, the aspiring muscician waiting fo his big break
( maher
)
, tjhe mexican gigolo
( rodriguez
)
, the woman who atually wants to drive cabs for a living
( warfield
)
and the guy who wnats tothe own a cab company for a living
( adam baldwin
)
. we
' ve all seen dozens of bad comedies from thte 80
' s
. some are fun to watch
and some are actually funny
. this one is more or less neither
. you
' d thiunk plenty ofthe comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent
( whatever
)
, bu d
. c
. cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis
, culiminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped annd the other cabbies have to go tothe rescue him
. it
' s a shame no oen was able to rescure tihs movei from yhe depths of stale jokes
and unoriginality
. d
. c
. cab has rightly earned its position on
" usa uv all nite
.
