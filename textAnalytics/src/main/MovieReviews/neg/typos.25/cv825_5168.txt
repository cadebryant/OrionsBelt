if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late
- night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing soem of the worst films of the 80 ' s
, they ' d agree d
. c
. cab isnt the quintessential
" usa up all nite
" movie
. it ' s noe of thsoe childish r
- rated movies that kids owudl lveo
bu can ' t see untli it ' s edited for tv
. it ' s also one of those pointless
, almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs
.
and
, strike threee
, it pairs mr
. t with gary busey
. i heard gilbert say d
. c
. cab had
" an all
- star cast
,
"
but i ' m still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in thta statement
. when third
- billing goes tothe a two
- minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara
" as herself
,
" yuo cant ' t sday a damn thing baout all
- star casts
. likewise for tolkein appearances by marsha
" roz
" warfield
, paul rodriguez
adn
" politically incorect
" host bill maher
, before he was somebody
. appearing in d
. c
. cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else
, especially irene
" i ' m gonna live forever
" cara
. d
. c
. cab isnt an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher
( who would go on to direct batman forever
) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs
. you get the feeling if the police acedemy cadets had made a different career choise
, this would be the result
, except here you have such interesting characters as thte
" tolkein white guy
"
( busey
) who wants to git infront tight with the blacks now before tehy take over hte world
, the token jive talker named tyrone
( charlie barnett
) who wears his hair in rollers
and uses the word
" honkey
" as much as possible
, the tough guy whith the mohawk
and gold chains
( mr
. t
-
- a real stretch for him
)
, the aspiring musician waiting for his big break
( maher
)
, the mexican gigolo
( rodriguez
)
, the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living
( warfield
)
and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living
( adam baldwin
)
. we ' ve all seen dozens of bad comedies fomr the 80 ' s
. some are fun to watch
and some are actually funny
. this oen is moreso or less neither
. you ' d think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent
( whatever
)
,
but d
. c
. cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis
, culiminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin isnt kidnapped
and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him
. it ' s a shame noone one ws able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes
and unoriginality
. d
. c
. cab has rightly earned its position on
" usa up all nite
.
