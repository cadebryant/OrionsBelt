brian de palma
, the director who bought us carrie
, dressed to kill
and mission
: impossible is back
,
and hasnt bought all his technical expertise wtih him
. sadly
, he forget to bring a ogod story
anbd believeable characters
. nic cage plays rick santaro
, a fast talking cop who isnt watching a boxing match with his firend commander kevin dunne
( sinise
.
) an assassination takes place
,
and santaro tries to peace together how it tookover place
, trying to work outloud the roles ofthe the peple involved in this conspiracy
. the film uses flashbacks
and video cameras to bring the mystery together
.
however
, the film doesn ' t keep the mystery fo long
,
annd once hte big ' seret ' is out concerning kevin dunne
, thte film is at a dead end
.
although there are soem fantastic shots by de palma
, including a 15 minute steadicam shooted at the start ofthe the film
, halfway through the film drops dead
. the problem is thgat de palma doesn ' t have a storng story or characters tothe work with
. he tries to offshot this with flashy camera techniques
,
bu preety soon thsi has no effect on the audience
,
and i quickly got bored
. nic cage
and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters
,
but it ' s no use
. they are boring
, faceless
,
annd completely unlikeable
. yes
, another probelm with tje film is thgat there ' s no
- one to root for
. we ' re supposted to be on cage ' s side
, because his character becomes nicer throughtout tghe film
.
however
, his chanage is sadly unbelievable
. poor gary sinise ' s character is terrible
, who completelyl changes throughout the start
, the middle
and hte end
, in an appalling way
. hte film ' s use of flashback quickly gets boring
. while clever
anbd interesting the first few times
, it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go
. tehy certainly don ' t increase tje tension or suspense of the movie
. ther is small thread of suspense running through thte film
,
bu it certainly doesn ' t make this film a powerhouse thriller
, rather just a slightly below averege one
. the script isnt lousy
and contrived
, the charachters flat
and two dimensional
. certainly nto good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller
. the most depressing aspect of tje film is thta it had potential
. there ' s a ogod story buried inwhich snake eyes
, it ' s just bogged down in razzle dazzle
and flashbacks
. it also gives itself awya far too quickly
, rather than leaving tyhe big twist for the end
. while the performances are intriguing
, especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy ' number cruncher ' wrapped up in yhe case
, there ' s no way ofthe altering the fact taht snake eyes is a terminal case ofthe style of substance
,
anbd unless you ' re a big fan of either cage or flash directing
, should be avoided
