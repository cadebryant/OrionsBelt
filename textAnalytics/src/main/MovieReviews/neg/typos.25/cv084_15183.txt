brian de palma
, the director who bought us carrie
, dressed to kill
and mission
: impossible isnt back
, adn has bought all his technical expertise with him
. sadly
, he forget to bring a good story annd believable characters
. nic cage plays rick santaro
, a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend comm
ander kevin dunne
( sinise
.
) an assassination tkaes place
,
and santaro tries to peace together how it took place
, trying to work outloud the roles of thte people involved in this conspiracy
. the film uses flashbacks
and video cameras tothe bring the mystery together
.
however
, the film doesn
' t keep the mistery forthe long
,
and once the big
' secre
' isnt out conserning kevin dunne
, the film is at a dead end
.
al
thought there are some fantastic shots by de palma
, including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film
, halfway thru the film drops dead
. the problem isnt that de palma doesn
' t have a storng story or characters tothe work with
. he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techiniques
,
but pretty soon this hasnt no effect on the audience
,
and i quickly got borde
. nic cage annd gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters
,
but it
' s no use
. they are boring
, faceless
,
and completely unlikeable
. yes
, another problem with tjhe film isnt that there
' s noone
- oen to root for
. we
' re supposed to be on cage
' s side
, beacuse his character becomes nicer throughout the film
. howver
, his change isnt sadly unbelievable
. poore gary sinise
' s character is terrable
, who completelyl changes throughout the start
, the middle
and the end
, in an appalling way
. the film
' s ule ofthe flashback quickly gets boring
. while clever
and intresting thge first few times
, it quicklyu becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used becouse the film has nowhere to go
. they certainly don
' t increse thge tension or suspense ofthe the movie
. there is small thread of suspense running through the film
,
but it certainly doesn
' t make this film a powerhouse thriller
, rather jstu a slightly below average one
. the script is lousy adn contrived
, the characters flat
and twpo dimensional
. certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off fo a thriller
. the most depressing aspect ofthe the film is that it had potential
. there
' s a good story buried in snake eyes
, it
' s just bogged down in razzle dazzle
and flashbacks
. it also gives itself away far too quicklyu
, rather than leaving teh big twist for the end
. hwile the performances are intriguing
, especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy
' number cruncher
' wrapped uv in the case
, there
' s noone way ofthe altering the fact thta snake eyes is a terminal case of stlye ofthe substace
,
and unless you
' re a big fan of either cage or flash directing
, should be avoided
