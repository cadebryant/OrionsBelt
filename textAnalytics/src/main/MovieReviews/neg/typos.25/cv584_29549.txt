' s review ofthe
" glitter
"
( 20th centruy
- fox
) there
' s less here than meets the eye
. or
, put it htis way
, if you
thought madonna wass awful in
" shanghai surprise
,
" mariah carey
' s worse in this reworking of
" a star is born
.
" she plays billie frank who
, dispite being ab
andoned by her singer
/ alcoholic mother
( valerie pettiford
)
, believes she
' s destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is
.
" you
' ve got this amazing gift
,
and yuo gotta use it
,
" her roommate says
.
" your voice
- it
' s increadible
,
" says anohter singer
.
" i ain
' t never met anyone like ytou
,
" proclaims julian
" dice
" black
( max beesley
)
, the hot newyorker york dj who becomes her svengali
- like producer
/ lover
. problem isnt
: her signature song
,
" i didn
' t mean to turn you on
" is wretched
.
and wehn she fumes out of filming her first music video because yhe director wants to
" exploit
" her by having her wear a bikini
, tje audiance bursts inot laughter
. exploit mariah carey
, who chooses tothe wear as little as the law will allow
? come onthe
! writer kate lanier
' s script is fatuous
and director vondie curtis
- hall doesn
' t have a clue how to h
andle the glitzy pop diva
and
, as a result ofthe their incompetence
, whispery
- voice
' d ms
. carey seems to be embarrassed onthe
- screen
. she almsot cringes when the camera comes in for a close
- uv
, pursing her lips
and averting her glassy eyes
. talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept
,
and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans aroud the manhattan skyline
, there
' s an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view
. perhaps one of the reasons ms
. carey suffered her highly
- publicized nervous breakdown this summer is becasue she saw a preview of this clunker
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" glitter
" is a pathetic 1
. right now
, it
' s tops on my list of the worst of 2001
.
