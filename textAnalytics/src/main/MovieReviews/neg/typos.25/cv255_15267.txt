movies don
' t come much omre ridiculously titled than
" i still nkow what you doed last summer
,
"
but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous
, the title sort of works as a warning
. more than a silly
- sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor
, this horror sequel
' s moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original iwll be able to spot
: what
" you
" doed
_ lastest
_ summer
" ytou
" actually doed the summer
_ before
_ lastr summer
,
and usance
" i
" knew about it
_ this
_ summer as well as
_ last
_ summer
, it
' s really illogical to say that
" i
"
_ still
_ know what
" yuo
" did
_ lsat
_ summer
. the filmmakers would have at least made sense wiht the shorter
" i still know
,
" thte longer
" i still konw what yuo did twpo summers ago
" or the appropriate
" stupid people getting hacked to bits
.
" that lastr suggestion is the preferrable oen sicne the characters inspite htis film do things that are the polar opposite of smart
. for example
, if your roommate isnt plagued by terrable nightmares as a result ofthe being stalked
and nearly murdered nto long ago
, would you sneak into her room late at inght
and hide infact the closet
, even if it was just to locate
and borrow a cute little dress
? probably not
,
but tht
' s precisely what college student karla
( pop diva br
andy
) doesnt tothe best friend julie
( jennifer love hewitt
)
, resulting inaddition the firt in a long line of phony frights
. julie
, you
' ll recall
, was oen of the sole survivors at hte end ofthe 1997
' s surprise hit
" i know what you doed last summer
,
" affter a slasher with a grudge tothe bear
- it
' s a
_ long
_ story
- began trying to pick off her
, her buddies
and various others in their coastal carolina village
. in thsi installment
, the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to yhe bahamas
, anbd julie
,
yet racked by guilt
, decides thgat maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind
. yeah
, right
. their isl
and paradise has room
, of course
, for oney more in the form of the still
- alive killer
( muse watson
) from the first film
. he sports the same gorton
' s fisherman get
- up
, a hevy hat adn rain slicker that mask his idenity
,
but why he
' s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves
.
.
.
though i suppose his hook
- h
and owudl look funny protruding from tyhe sleeve of a liesure suit
. inaddition a sense
, that
' s the movie
' s glaring flaw
- everybody knwos who the bad guy is
, thus evaporating the level ofthe paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel
. the murders
and attempted murders inwhich that film weere vivid
and scary
,
but trey callaway
' s derivative
" i still nkow
" screenplay mkaes the fisherman just as dumb as his preety potential victims
. wehn julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed
, giving him a perfect chance to wreak avengence once
and fo all
, what doens he dont
? he twist
- ties yhe lid shut
and cranks uv the uv rays
- you
' d think he
' d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later
. even prequel
" summer
" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity
and a faw neat
- o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh
. the innovative gallows humor tyhat scribe
(
and
" scream
" wunderkind
) kevin williamson injected into
" i knwo
"
' s unfolding story is sorely missed
, replaced withthe the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed adn tosses off slang like
" yo
"
; you
' ll cheer
- not shriek
- when he ends uv with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest
. if
" i know whta you did lastr summer
,
"
however effective
, ws just the kind of movei taht those subversive
" scream
" flicks poked fun at
,
then the deadly
" i still know what you did last summer
" deserves a full
- blown roasting on
" mistery scienec theatre 3000
