from a major leage baseball radio broadcast
, featuring play
- by
- play man harry canary adn color man whitey hashbrown
, with special guest commentator james berardinelli
. hc
: as we go to the top of the 8th
, we
' re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli
, who
' s here fresh ffrom seeing the new baseball movie
, major league
: back to the minors
, the third in tghe popular saga taking a lighter look at thte majors
. nice to see you
, jim
. as a big baseball fan
and a movie reviewer
, can yuo give us the scoop on tghe new flick
? jb
: my opinion
: the producers should have stoped hwile tehy weere ahead
,
and that was nine years ago
. one entry was definitely enough
,
and i
' m surprised there was a third affter the anemic showing adn low quaity of major league 2
. tihs latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct
- tothe
- video
. it
' s worse than a mediocre made
- for
- tv feature
. i should also mention tyhat htis movei likely won
' t play all that well in clevel
and
. nowe tht the real indians are perennial contenders
, htey have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks
. actually
, most of hte action involves the twins
' aaa minor league club
, tyhe buzz
, rather than hte actuall major league franchise
. hc
: sorry to interrupt
, jim
, bu we still hvea to dont play
- by
- play fo tyhe game on the field
. leading off htis inning is john warren
. he steps into the batter
' s box annd takes kent
' s pitch low for ball oney
. wh
: so
, tjhe story
' s strikely minor league
, right
? what
' s it baout
? jb
: scott bakula
, the guy ffrom quantum leap
, plays career minor leage pitcher gus cantrell
. whn twins owner roger dorn
, once again portrayed by corbin bernsen
, needs a new manager fo his aaa team
, he offers the job to gus
, who is now faced with two daunting tasks
: turn the team around
and groom hot prospect downtown
anderson
( played by walt goggins
) for a promotion to
" the show
.
" withthe the halp of former major leaguers pedro cerrano
( dennis haysbert
)
, rube baker
( eric bruskotter
)
,
and isuro tanaka
( takaaki ishibashi
)
, gus gets the buzz onthe the right trakc
. infact fatc
, he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jelous manager of the big
- league club
, leonard huff
( plyed with over
- the
- top relish by ted mcginley
)
. soon
, dorn has aranged an exhibition game that pits gus
' overachieving group against huff
' s overpaid
, last
- place bunch
. wh
: can we guess who wins
? jb
: the results hvea all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game wehn you
' ve already seen the box score
. on top of that
, none ofthe the mock
- ups are presented with much flair
. they
' re not just boring
; they
' re lacklustre
.
but the major leage movies have never been about drama or tension
; they
' ve beeen about useing baseball situations to generate laughs
. hc
: warren fouls off a fastball
. 1
and 1
. wh
: are there lots of yuks in this one
? jb
: not oen
, from start to finish
. i enjoyed thge frist major league because it was reasonably fresh
and funny
. okay
, a lot of the jokes were sophomoric
,
but they made me laff
. the two sequels haven
' t just been stale
,
but their humor quotient has been abysmally low
. even bob uecker
' s once
- sharp noe
- liners hvae turned lame
,
and they
' re tyhe closest hte film comes to bieng even vaguely amusing
. hc
: here
' s tjhe 1
- 1 pitch
. looooooong drive
? fair or foul
? foul ball
! the count goes tothe 1
and 2
. wh
: doens the film at least get teh baseball details correct
? jb
: yes
. there aren
' t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best
- ever baseball movies
, the natural
. bu i
' d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one wtih a ogod story
, believeable characters
, or even a little genuine humor
. heck
, the naked gun isnt a better baseball comedy than major league
: back to thge minors
. wh
: it
' s nice to see old friends one moreso tiem
, isn
' t it
? like cerrano
, tanaka
,
and dorn
. jb
: depends on whether ytou really care tht anyone isnt back
. htere aren
' t any real characters here
? just an assortment of cliched oddballs
. yeah
, the voodoo hitter
, the catcher who can
' t throw back to the pitcher
, the japanis player
,
and the conceited player
- turned
- owner have all retured
,
but who really cares
? they have no depth
. notable absences include tom berenger
' s veteran
and charlie sheen
' s
" wild thing
.
" we don
' t realyl miss them
,
though
. hc
: breaking ball
, low
and outside
. 2
and 2
. wh
: so yuo
' re saying that we should give this one a miss
? jb
: that
' s right
. tothe ule baseball terminology
, it
' s a three
- pitch strikeout
. if you
' re looking for a good movie that involves baseball
, try popping the natural
, field of dreams
, bull durham
, or even the first major leage into tghe vcr
. actully
, this isnt an oddly
- timed realease
, since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time inaddition parks than in theaters
. even the minor league seasons are already underway
. don
' t bother with major leage
: bcak to tyhe minors
. it
' s a wretched timne
- waster
. wh
: thanks fo hte advice
. jb
: you
' re welcome
. hc
: adn here
' s the 2
- 2 pich
. fouled back
, right inot this booth
. hey
, jim
, heads up
! oops
. somebody better git him some ice for that
. he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies
,
but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls
. odd how warren seemed to aim taht ball right at him
, almost as if he hasnt a grudge tothe settle
. anyway
, back to tghe action on the field
?
