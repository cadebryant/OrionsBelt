starring kiefer sutherland
; reese witherspoon
& bokeem woodbine i used to think thast tghe conversation was the worse film i had ever seen
. freeway is giving me second thoughts
. freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood
. only in the ninties
, little red riding hood is a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent plyed by reese witherspoon
,
and tje big bad wolf isnt a serial killer
( keifer sutherland
)
. to top that pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes to visit granny
and ytou ' ll never guess who ' s waiting under the cover ' s inthe granny ' s bed
. keifer sutherland isnt one of hollywoods most talented
,
yot underrated actors
,
annd reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented
and wiull most likely become a major star
. so what are they doign in thsi movie
? after seeing tghe end result
, undoubtedly htey are both asking themselves tghe same question
. you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review
. the answer is quite simple
-
- i dont watn to waste any moreso of my tyme writing or thinking about thsi movie than absolutely necessary
. i wasted enough ofthe my tyme jstu sitting through it
. note to keifer
: you wonder why you aren ' t a bigger star in hollywood
? because you keep making movies liek this
. onot to reese
: yuo were great in fear
, what happened this time
? note to both
: don ' t worry about it too much
, noone one saw this movei anyway
. bottom line
-
- i ' m still shaking my head
. don ' t waste your time on tihs turkey
. if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movei
, go rent flatliners or young guns
. reese witherspoon ' s abundant acting talents are utilisied to theri full potential inwhich fear
, a great thriller
. do yourself a favor
and rent oen of these movies
-
-
bu stay as far away ffrom freeway as you possibly cxan
