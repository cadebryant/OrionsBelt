starring kiefer sutherl
and
; reese witherspoon
& bokeem woodbine i unsed to think thyat the conversation was the worse film i hadnt ever seen
. freeway isnt giving me second
thoughts
. freeway isnt a modern retelling ofthe littel red riding hood
. onyl in the nineties
, little red riding hood is a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon
, annd the big bad wolf is a serial killer
( keifer sutherl
and
)
. to top thast pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes tothe visi granny
and you
' ll never guess who
' s waiting under the cover
' s in granny
' s bed
. keifer sutherl
and isnt one of hollywoods most talented
,
yet underated actors
, anbd reese witherspoon isnt exceptionally talented annd will most likely become a major star
. so what are they doing in thsi movie
? after seeing the end result
, undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question
. you might be asking yourself why this isnt such a short review
. the answer is quite simple
-
- i dont want to waste any moreso of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary
. i wasted enought of my time just sitting through it
. note to keifer
: you wonder why you aren
' t a bigger star in hollywood
? because you keep making movies like this
. onot tothe reese
: ytou were grat in fear
, what happened this time
? note to both
: don
' t worry about it too much
, no one saw this movie anyway
. bottom line
-
- i
' m still shaking my head
. don
' t waste your time on this turkey
. if ytou want to see a great keifer sutherl
and movie
, go rent flatliners or young guns
. reese witherspoon
' s abundant acting talents are used to theri full potential in fear
, a gerat thriller
. do youself a favor
and rent one of theese movies
-
- bu stay as far away fomr freeway as you possibly can
