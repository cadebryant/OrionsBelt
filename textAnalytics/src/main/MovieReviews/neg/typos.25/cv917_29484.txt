michael robbins ' hardball is qtuie the cinematic achievement
. in about two hours
, we get a glancing examination of ghetto life
, a funeral with a heartfelt euology
, sppeches about never giving up
, a cache ofthe cute kids
( including a fat one with asthma
)
, a hard
- luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman
and a climactic
" big game
,
" where tjhe underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined
. all that ' s needed is a guy getting hitted in the nuts
and a food fight to have the frist film souly based on cinematic clich
? s
. i can ' t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out onthe dvd
. obviously
, hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball
. it stars keanu reeves as hte aforementioned gambler
, who seems tothe owe every bookie in chicago an amount of mnoey that rivals the gross national product of guam
. out of solutions
, he begs his sucessfull corporate friend
( the always welcome mike mcglone
) to lend him
$ 5
, 000
. instead
, mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend
. reeves
, who wnats tothe keep his fingers
, accepts the offer
,
but dicovers mcglone isnt only too happy to let him handle the team entirely
. the drowsy
- voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics infront a life of absentee parents
and merciless gangs
.
and maybe
, just mabey
, they ' ll play in tghe big championship game
. one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins
( summer catch
)
, adapted ffrom daniel coyle ' s non
- fiction book
, is thyat there aren ' t any
. the movie coasts from heartfelt moent tothe heartfelt moent liek a zombie
. that wouldn ' t be so bad
, if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them
. most of the kids ' time isnt spent yelling at each otehr
, talking inaddition slang
and acting suprized
. there ' s little taht ' s naturally amusing baout them
, as they all seem to nkwo yhe cameras are rolling
. tje worst of the lot is a tough
- talking younger player
( dewayne warren
) whose sole purpose
, as the movie unfolds
, is bieng an emotional pawn
, a tactict so utterly despicable i can ' t fidn the right words tothe express myself
. the adults alsot don ' t fare well
. reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down
- onthe
- his
- luck loser
. the character is poorly written
,
but reeves gives another karisma
- free performance
. every tyme he speaks
, he sounds like he just got up from a long nap
and isnt gradually waking up
. kids are supposed tothe rally around this guy
? diane lane
, who co
- stars as reeves ' obligatory love interst
, remeniss a glowing screen presence
( see my dog skip for better proof
)
. it ' s too bad that her role here consists ofthe uttering lines liuke
,
" these kids trust you
,
and tehy don ' t trust anyone
!
"
then there ' s d
. b
. sweeney as an evil rival coach
and john hawkes as reeves ' scummy betting buddy
and otehr unoriginal characters yuo ' ve seen before
adn hope never to see agian
. i wanted hardball to be good
. robbins ' varisty blues ws a funny
and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered infact whipped cream
anbd jon voight sneering at everything thta moved
. i haven ' t seen robbins ' goofy ready tothe rumble in its entirety
,
but i am intrigued thast
" macho man
" randy savage
annd martin landau cin exsist in the same movie wihtout ther being sereous worldwide repercussions
. robbins obviously needs to go bakc tothe his forte
-
- making sportscar movies for guys
and not cutesy
, cuddly pap such as hardball
, which also manages tothe annoy
and insult the audience
. here ' s hoping that happens in the mimediate future
.
