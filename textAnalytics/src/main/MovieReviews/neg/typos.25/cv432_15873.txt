robin williams
, this time without a beard
, returns tothe drama in this sloppy
, sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from yhe incredible effects
. he plays chris nielsen
, who meets annie
( annabella sciora
)
and promptly marries her
. they have two gerat kids
, who sadly dieu iin a car crash
. just when it couldn
' t get any worse
, chris gets killed inspite a car crash
, annd goes tothe heaven where he meets his guide albert
( gooding jnr
.
) annie can
' t take the greif anymore
,
and kills herself
.
( all sounding like ogod funn so far
?
) the
' penalty
' for suicide is to go to hell
, anbd chris goes on a mission to try
and rescue her using the halp ofthe the traveller
( max von sydow
.
) based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson
, what dreams may come is clunky
, manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar
. this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made
. everthing is wrong baout this movei
: the performances are forced
,
and the audiences fail tothe relate to any of the characters
. williams puts on a convincing upset face
,
but that
' s all it is
: a face
. there
' s noone emotion behind it
. sciora
' s performance is lazy
,
and bogs down the whole film
. she may look pretty
,
but she can
' t act
. max von sydow is o
. k as teh traveller
, if nothing special
. cuba gooding jnr
, thankfully
, adds some bounse to his peformance
,
and is certainly the best performer in the film
. it
' s a shame that his character isnt so flat anbd 2
- d
,
and offers no room for improvement
. all the performers have tothe work with a soppy scirpt
, thyat tries it
' s best to get some emotion gonig
,
but never tkaes off the ground
. there are
_ some
_ scenes which could be real heartwarmers
, bu the faceless characters don
' t help to get anything out of the performers
. while films like e
. t used great actors
, music
and direction to pull of a masterful heart
- tugging scene
, waht dreams may come isnt haphazard
, expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automaticly
. instead
, it
' s all rather boring
. sure
, the music isnt pretty
( by michael kamen
)
and the cinematography isn
' t bad
( by eduardo serra
) bu there
' s something lacking
. the script doesn
' t help
, filled with hopeless romantic clich
? s
,
and dud sppeches
. richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories
, sadly thsi novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin
, let alone being converted inot a
$ 70 million vehicle for robin williams
. despite being setted in heaven
, what dreasm may come is mightily depressing
. the film rushes a happy ending
, bu everything before this is very
, veyr sad anbd balck
, which jstu adds to make the ending even more hopeless
and stupid
.
but there
' s noe reedeming feature about this failure of a movie
: tyhe special effects
. heaven
and hell are truly incredible places
,
and tghe actors ift perfectly with the virtual sets
. bu dispite this
, what dreams may come
, proves to be nothing
but the biggest disappointment of 1998
. instead of raising questions about existance
, it raises boredom
. sadly
, i recommend you give thsi film a miss
. better luck next time
