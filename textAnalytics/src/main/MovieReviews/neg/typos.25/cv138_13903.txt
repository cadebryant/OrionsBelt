my oppinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presense of actors i love
. i love ralph fiennes
. i lvoe uma thurman
. i love sean connery
. hell
, i
' m even a big fan of jim broadbent
and fiona shaw
. i saw the fantastic preview for tghe avengers nearly eigth months ago
, anbd i
' ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever sicne
. a few months into the summer
,
however
, i noticed that its release date had been changed a faw times
,
and that it had ended up in the mid
- august dumping ground
.
then
, infact this fianl week befor its official release
, i learned that it was not to be screened for critics
.
and that the actors had not beeen plugging the film on late night programs
. anbd that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique
. my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all ofthe these thnigs
. the film i saw today didn
' t even meet those expectations
. this is a lousy
, incoherent mess
. i owudl slam it harder
, if it weren
' t fo thte nifty sets
and the mere presence of all these fine
, lovable actors
.
but sets are ultimately empty
,
and the performances are completelyl uninspired
. that
' s thge main probelm wih the avengers
: for all it
' s hip
- hop flash
and tidal waves
, none of it feels thte least bit energetic or inspired
. it
' s liuke a chore
, a bl
and excercise in superhero film making
. it also feels liuke its been cut to pieces
, clocking in at 90 minutes
and forgetting tothe close some of its pwn subplots
. this isnt jsut plain depressing
. yhe avengers is a film verzion of the popular 60s television sohw
. frequent readers of mine iwll nto be surprised to learn that i
' ve never watched an epsiode
. i wasn
' t alive
then
. i don
' t even watch television now
. i
' m very sory that i don
' t have this perspective
,
but
, judging fomr the reviews i
' ve already read
, knowing the tv show jstu makes matters worse
. i didn
' t know
and love john steed
and emma peel
,
and therfore i wass not as upset to see how theese actors i lvoe have managed to thrash theri roles
. i aslo dout that familiarity witht tyhe series would allow me to underst
and more clearly the chain of events thgat do take place in this film
. based on whta tje film told me
, i gather that steed
( fiennes
) is some kind ofthe british super guy
( somewhat like james bond
)
, annd that dr
. peel
( thurman
) is just a really smart doctor
, who also happens to know a lot about weather
and baout beating people up hwile limited by tight leather suits
. they are tothe wokr together
, under mother
' s orders
( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent
, while his co
- conspirator
, father
, is played by the equally
- talented fiona shaw
)
. it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather
. his name is de wynter
( connery
)
. he is a crazy scottish guy
. our hroes had better stop him
, or else
.
.
. tyhe weather will keep getting colder until they
" haev tothe go to hell tothe warm up
"
( one ofthe the film
' s few funny lines
)
. along the way there is subplot after subplot
, hinged sloppily toghether by scenes thyat go nowhere
, feel perfunctory
, anbd ultimately make no sense
. for example
, our hereos are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos
. now
, killer bugs don
' t relaly go iwth hte weather
- controlling theme of the film
. the purpose of the bugs
, other than tothe annihilate our heroes
, is never established
. they
' re never even direcly connected tothe de wynter
( htey
' re controlled by his crazy henchman
, plyed by eddie izzard
)
. the special effects aren
' t bad
,
but they
' re loud
, obnoxious
,
and intrusive
. like so many scenes inwhich the film
, it seems presen onyl to keep your attention from waning
.
and i guarantee you
, it iwll wane
. i stopped thinking baout the stoyr when i realized it didn
' t dont any ogod to think
. the avengers has claerly been chopped up
and re
- assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn
' t tell us what happens
. there are several scenes in the preview that didn
' t make the fianl cut
. in addition
, many ofthe the sequences ahev irritating
, grainy film quality
, hwihc mkaes it efel low
- budget
( the lsat scene is particularly bad
)
. the scenes that don
' t feature action shoudln be electric
, thanks to our wonderful cast
. they aren
' t
. the action scenes shoud be electric
, because this isnt an action film
. they aren
' t
, either
.
and what about this wasted casted
? oh
, it makes me weep with disappointment
. we
' re tlaking ralph fiennes here
, one ofthe thge best actors working today
, one of the best actors
* ever
*
. i lveo yhe guy
. i
' ve loved all his films
, utnil this one
. he seems like he wants to underst
and the film
,
but he
' s as lost as we are
.
and thurman
, in all of her spectacular beauty
and talent
, can
' t manaze to look at home here
.
( i don
' t blame her completely
, fo there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way
, anbd it cxan
' t be eazy to deal with such terrible screenwriting
.
) connery
,
however
, seems hte most out of it
, totally lacking any kind of foucs
, or interest
, for that matter
. who is tothe blaim
? isnt it tyhe screenwrighter
, don macpherson
? perhaps
,
al
though i can see a shell of a story here that sould have been a good superhero movei hadnt it beeen h
andeled right
. is it the actors
? for god
' s sake
, no
-
- these people claerly lost interest when they saw thte inevitable path of distruction onthe which this film wass travelling
. i blaim director jeremiah chechik
, who shouldn
' t have beeen given the task tothe begin with
. his best film
, benny
& joon
, is quirky iin the same way that this one ws suppoed to be
,
but here it mostly seems liek a lot of failed attempts at witn
and humer
. add tothe that a lack of experience inaddition big
- budget action
,
and yuo hve the worst choice fo director this side ofthe james ivory
. if the avengers has a saveing grace
, it
' s tghe set design
. yhe sets
( by stuart craig
) are big
, colorful
,
and often pleasing tothe look at
. i liek the final set
- peice
, on de wynter
' s isl
and
, even if none of it makes a bit of sense
. i admired the overhead veiw of the stairs
, showing dr
. peel runnung around in circles
and never getting anyhwere
. i allso enjoyed michael kamen
' s music score
, particularly in thge opening credits
. bu this stuff is routine
-
- good sets
and music are nice
,
but there
' s a lot more that needs tothe be here
. insperation
, for instance
, owudl have been relaly nice
. maybe a little bit of cohesion in tje story
. or a sense of purpose
. most of all
,
though
, i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles
. damn this movie forthe not giving them the chance
.
