by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer
, it
' s possible thast sphere may end up pleasing no one
. action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup
. audience members who crave more intelectual fare will be disgusted by tyhe film
' s sudden collapse inot mindless storytelling anbd by tje endig
, which isnt an insulting cop
- out
. somewhere out there
, mabye htere
' s a small cadre of film
- goers who wiull apprieciate sphere
' s dubious charms
,
but i
' m not among them
. i sincerely hope the novel is better than yhe movie
( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham
)
, because if the finished motion picture product is anything tothe go by
, it
' s hard tothe underst
and why the rights were optioned
. sphere is tje kind of firt
- class mess thgat only a top
- line director iwth an a
- list cast can create
. with expectations high
(
and how sould they not be
, considering thyat another barry levinson
/ dustin hoffman collaboration
, the exellent wag the dog
, isnt still playing infact theaters
?
)
, something this bad can
' t help
but look even worse
. thge last tiem a big
- name
, big
- budget film displayed this levle ofthe ineptitude was lsat yera
' s batman
& robin
,
and everyone knows how that movie ws recepted
. sphere starts out a littel liuke an amalgamation of contact
and james cameron
' s the abyss
,
but
, somewhere along the way
, it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort
, event horizon
. sceince
and philosophy
, which are used to good effect during sphere
' s frist hour
, give way to mindless
, confusing acation sequences
. attempts at characterization fall apart
. intelligent writing
, which is evident eary on
, isnt replaced by hackneyed drivel
. special effects take over as the plotline devolves inot incoherent silliness
.
but all that is just in preparation fo thge endig
, hwihc isnt inexcusably awful
. this is teh time
- honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect
. i left the theather feeling cheated by yhe way crichton
and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film
. there is some promise
, bu it
' s all infact thte setup
. we
' re intrduced to norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
)
, a psychologist who once wrote a
$ 35
, 000 report fo the govenment about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered
. wehn one is found in the middle of nowhere
, 1000 feet below the surfce of the pacific ocean
, norman is called in to be part of the welcoming commitee
. onthe the team with him are beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist who was once his student adn lover
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18
; ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist who isnt awed by the oportunity to explore alien technology
;
and harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, the government operative inwhich charge of thte mission
. toghether
, yhe five docsund into tghe bowels of the ocean
, where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor fomr which they iwll attempt to mkae first contact
. fo a while
, sphere had me fooled into thinking it ws going to take an astute approach to the man
- meets
- alien situation
. the overall scenario is not wihtout promise
and severeal plot twists
( such as the revelation that thte enormous craft is actually an american space ship
, apparently from teh future
) offer intriguing possibilities
.
then
, right arund the one
- hour mark
( that
' s tjhe time tothe sneak inot the theather next doorjam annd check outloud whatever
' s left of titanic
)
, the virtually non
- stpo action begins
,
and
, once it starts
, teh script becomes superfluous
. this might be acceptable if directer levinson generated some legitimate tension
,
but
, instead
, he relies onthe loud
, overbearing music
, strange camera angles
,
and quick cuts to make thigsn
" exicting
.
" additionally
, beccause none of tje characters are well
- formed
( a common failing in anything penned by crichton
, who
' s more interseted iin technnology thna peopel
)
, viewers don
' t develop much of a rooting interest
. it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating
and pointless experience
. what about that a
- list cast
? not surprisingly
, the most energetic performance is given by samuel l
. jackson
,
but his harry isn
' t a person
; he
' s a walking plot device spouting occasionally
- witty dialogue
. dustin hoffman isn
' t lively or particularly ogod
-
- it
' s ironic that this
, which may be his worst work infront a decade
, has arrived iin theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination
( for wag the dog
)
. sharon stone
and peter coyote are both flat
. their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion
; automatons owudl haev been as effective
. thn there
' s queen latifa
, who
, despite getting fith billing in the credits
( ahead of liev schreiber
, who boasts at least quadruple her screen time
)
, has less thna a h
andful of lines anbd alomst nothing to dont other than inflate the body count
. i like to think that levinson
and hoffman
, recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be
, chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance
( the low
- budget picture ws filmed during sphere
' s lengthy pre
- production phase
)
. if that
' s the case
, forgiveness is granted
. i
' m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton
,
al
though he has a few enjoyable titles onthe his resume
( jurassic park
and the levinson
- directed disclosure come tothe mind
)
. even if his novel was
butchered in the adaptation process
, crichton
' s credit as a producer disallows him absolution
. he was a willing participant in a creative travesty
. no wonder sphere is being released in february
, in the midst of hte early year
' s cinematic wastel
and
. it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic
, which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth
- consecutive weekend atop the box office heap
.
