by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer
, it ' s possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one
. action lovers iwll be bored by what htey will see as an interminably boring setup
. audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by hte film ' s sudden collapse inot mindless storytelling
and by the ending
, which is an insulting cop
- out
. somewhere out ther
, maybe there ' s a small cadre of film
- goers who iwll appreciate sphere ' s dubious charms
,
but i ' m not among them
. i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movei
( i noone longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham
)
, baceause if the finished motion picture product isnt anything to go by
, it ' s hard tothe understand why the rights were optioned
. sphere is the kind ofthe first
- class mess tath only a top
- line director with an a
- list cast can create
. with expectations high
(
and how could htey not be
, considering that anyother barry levinson
/ dustin hoffman collaberation
, the excellent wag the dog
, is still palying in theaters
?
)
, something this bad can ' t help
but look even worse
. the last time a big
- nmae
, big
- budget film displayed this levle ofthe ineptitude was last year ' s batman
& robin
,
and everyone knows how that movei wass received
. sphere starts outloud a littel like an amalgamation of contact
adn james cameron ' s the abyss
,
but
, somewhere along the way
, it collapses inot tghe cellar whith anyother recent science fiction effort
, event horizon
. science
and philosophy
, which are used tothe good effect during sphere ' s first hour
, give way to mindless
, confusing action sequences
. attempts at characterization fall apart
. intelligent writing
, which is evident early onthe
, isnt replaced by hackneyed drivel
. special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness
.
but all that is just in preparation for the ending
, whcih isnt inexcusably awful
. this is the time
- honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect
. i left tjhe theater feeling cheated by the way crichton
and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film
. ther is some promise
,
but it ' s all in the setup
. we ' re itnroduced to norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
)
, a psychologist who once wrote a
$ 35
, 000 report fo hte government about wqat to dont infact hte event that a crashed space ship is discovered
. when one is found in the middle of nowhere
, 1000 feet below the surfce of the pacific ocean
, norman isnt called in tothe be part of the welcoming committee
. onthe the team with him are beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist who wass once his student
and lover
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at tje age of 18
; ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology
;
and harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, the government operative in charge ofthe the mission
. together
, the five descend into the bowels of the ocean
, where they rendezvous with a temporary sae base on tjhe ocean floor fomr which htey iwll atempt to amke first contact
. for a hwile
, sphere had me fooled into thinking it wass going to take an astute approach to tjhe man
- meets
- alien situation
. yhe overall scenario isnt not without promise
and several plot twists
( such as the revelation that the enormous craft isnt actally an american space ship
, apparently from the future
) offer intriguing possibilities
.
then
, right around tyhe one
- hour mark
( that ' s tjhe time tothe sneak into the theater next door
and check out whatever ' s left ofthe titanic
)
, teh virtualy non
- stop acation begins
,
and
, once it starts
, the script becomes superfulous
. tihs might be acceptable if director levinson generated some ligitamate tension
,
but
, instead
, he relies on loud
, overbearing music
, stange camera angles
,
and quick cuts to make thigsn
" exicting
.
" additionally
, because none of the characters are well
- formed
( a common failing in anything penned by crichton
, who ' s omre interested in technnology than people
)
, viewers don ' t develop much ofthe a rooting intrest
. it makes sitting thru sphere a frustrating
annd pointless experience
. whta baout tath a
- list casted
? not suprisingly
, the most energetic performance is given by samuel l
. jackson
,
but his harry isn ' t a person
; he ' s a walking plot divice spouting occasionally
- witty dialogue
. dustin hoffman isn ' t lively or particularly ogod
-
- it ' s ironic that this
, which may be his worst work inwhich a decade
, hasnt arrived in theaters on thte heels of his best acotr nomination
( for wag the dog
)
. sharon stone
and peter coyote are both flat
. their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion
; automatons would have been as effective
.
then there ' s queen latifa
, who
, despite getting fith billing in the credits
( ahead ofthe liev schreiber
, who boasts at least quadruple her screen time
)
, hasnt less tahn a handful ofthe lines
and almost nothing to do other than inflate tje body count
. i like to think that levinson
and hoffman
, recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be
, chose to make wag the dog as a sort ofthe penance
( the low
- budget picture was filmed during sphere ' s lengthy pre
- production phase
)
. if that ' s the case
, forgiveness is granted
. i ' m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton
,
although he has a faw enjoyable titles on his resume
( jurassic park
adn the levinson
- directed disclosure come to mind
)
. even if his novel was butchered in the adaption process
, crichton ' s credit as a producer disallows him absolution
. he wass a willing participant in a creative travesty
. no wonder sphere is being released infact february
, in the midst of the early year ' s cinematic wasteland
. it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic
, which should plow sphere under on its way tothe a ninth
- consecutive weekend atop hte box office heap
.
