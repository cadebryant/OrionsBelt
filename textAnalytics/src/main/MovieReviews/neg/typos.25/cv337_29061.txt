depending on who yuo ask
, tjhe original sin was either the eating ofthe the apple
, the ect of disobedience against god
, or the act ofthe betrayal
.
but in case you didn
' t know this
, don
' t bother remembering it
.
.
. the words
" originnal sin
" never come up inaddition the movei of the same name
, let alone the concept of it
. the closest the film even gets to catholocism is in its narrative
( the storey is told by angelina jolie tothe her priest while onthe death row in cuba
, circa 1900
)
. irregardless of its senseless title
, original sin doens actualy have a plot
( albeit one ofthe the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war
, based on tjhe book waltz across darkness
)
. boy
( antionio b
anderas
) places peronal ad sometime around 1900
, searching fo a wief
. since htis isnt a century ago
, we narrowly dodge a remake of gren card
, only tothe find tath the girl
( jolie
) faked her photo
and isnt accually beautyfull
. skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes
( getting the question outloud of the way
, yes
, we get to see angelina jolie
' s breasts agian
)
, the girl turns out to be a con artist
, swindles boy for his money
, annd heads for the hills
. original sin
then breifly tries to be a thriller
. we see boy go whore
- chasing
, saying he wants to fidn girl
and kill her
.
but as soon as boy actually finds girl
, instead ofthe follwoing what might have been a promising
( or at least not completelyl fucking boring
) thriller
, thge film degenerates inot the worst dissection ofthe the virgina
/ whore complex usance milk money
. girl toys with tyhe idea of reforming her con
- girl past
, all the hwile avoiding the
" other man
,
" a lover that keesh making her start theese scams in the first place
. add insult to injury wiht smoe of the worst stylistic choices inaddition cinematic history
( litterally half of tyhe film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect
)
, adn acting roughly the calibur of a b
. b
. gun
,
and original sin isnt one of the most torturous films ofthe tje summer
, definitely front running tothe make my bottom ten of the year
. don
' t even bother with original sin
,
but if yuo do go
, be honest with yourself
and admitt its pure sex appeal
. just keep in mind tyhat altough thsi film may nto be tje most original onthe tje block
, it
' s much worse tahn a sin
. this is sacrilege
.
