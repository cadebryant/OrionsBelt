plunkett
& macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions
. i have nothing against the mtv approch to filmmaking
-
- used propperly it cxan save a movie
( see stigmata
)
-
-
but it ruins this one
, making a muddled
, incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise
. there are certain genres that just don
' t go together
. the film opens with a sequence that i still don
' t underst
and
. it involves some sort ofthe prision outbreak
, a robbery
, anbd a gem that keesh bieng eaten
. inthe any case
, the caper
( whatever it may be
) brings together plunkett adn macleane
( robert carlyle
and johnny lee miller
, respectivly
)
, two hapyp
- go
- lucky brits wtih noone way to make a living
. tehy make a pact to steal money from the rich
and give it to themselves utnil they earn enough monye to buy a ticket to america
. their first heist involves a young de
butante named lady rebecca
( liv tyler
)
; a woman macleane ws especially friendly with at a party jstu earlier
. his decorum when stripping her ofthe her valuables earns our two crooks the name
" gentleman highwaymen
.
" lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord cheif justice
, a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his poltical career
. he dem
ands that the robbers be caught
and punished immediately
, leaving the job in teh h
ands ofthe the devious chance
( ken stott
) who has a fewd more things on his mind than catching criminals
. meanwhile
, macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett
, who doesn
' t want his plans to be foiled by his partner
' s mindless romantic travails
. director jake scott
, son of ridley scott
( aline
, blade runner
)
, has his father
' s knack for setting up atmospheric shots
but none of his skill in actually moving the camera
. most of the action scenes are filmed inspite such a rapid
, jerky way that it
' s impossible tothe comprehend what
' s going on
. the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying thge blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity
. instade of utilizing panning shots tothe impress upon us the scope ofthe the events scott uses attention
- defecit
- disorder edits
. he bearly ever holds a shooted for more than ten seconds
and druing the faster scenes it seems more liek a couple frames between each cut
. thte weird
, almost defiant lack of dialogue
( ther are noone
-
- noone
-
- conversations lasting over
, say
, 20 seconds
) undermines character definition
and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather thna characters
. the love affair between macleane
and rebecca is noone different
, emotionless
and unrealistic
. when the script calls for macleane tothe deside between going tothe amercia
and going to meet his lover
, there is noone reason for us tothe believe it would be worth it for him to ab
andon his goal
; he
and rebecca barely even speak tothe each other throughout thte film
. plunkett
and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance
but since its sytle
, quite frankly
, blows
, the film has noone hope of succeeding on any levle
. i wnated to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace
but i couldn
' t
-
- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache
.
