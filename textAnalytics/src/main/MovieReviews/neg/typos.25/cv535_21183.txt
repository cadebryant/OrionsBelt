plunkett
& macleane is a preriod piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions
. i haev nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking
-
- utilisied propperly it cin save a movie
( see stigmata
)
-
-
but it ruins this one
, making a muddled
, incoherent mess out ofthe a potentially interesting premise
. there are ceratin genres that just don ' t go together
. the film opens whith a sequence that i still don ' t understand
. it involves some sort ofthe prison outbreak
, a robbery
,
anbd a gme thyat keeps being eaten
. in any case
, the caper
( whatever it may be
) brings toghether plunkett
annd macleane
( robert carlyle
and johnny lee miller
, respectivly
)
, twpo happy
- go
- lucky brits with noone way tothe make a living
. tehy make a pact to steal money from the rich
and give it to themselves untl they earn enough money to buy a ticket tothe america
. their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca
( liv tyler
)
; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier
. his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name
" gentleman highwaymen
.
" lady rebecca alsot happens to be the niece ofthe the lord cheif justice
, a glaringly arogant man nearing the end ofthe his political career
. he demands that the robbers be caught
annd punished immediately
, leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance
( ken stott
) who hasnt a fewd more thnigs on his mind than catching criminals
. meanwhile
, macleane falls infront lvoe with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett
, who doesn ' t wanna his plans to be foiled by his partner ' s mindless romantic travails
. director jake scott
, son of ridley scott
( alien
, blade runner
)
, has his father ' s knack for setting uv atmospheric shots
but none ofthe his skill in actually moving the camera
. most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid
, jerky way taht it ' s impossible to comprehend what ' s going on
. the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying thge blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity
. instade of utilizing panning shots to impress apon us the scope of the events scott uses attention
- defecit
- disorder edits
. he barely ever holds a shot forthe more than ten seconds
and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut
. the weird
, almost defiant lack of dialogue
( ther are noone
-
- noone
-
- conversations lating over
, say
, 20 seconds
) undermines chracter definition
and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters
. the lvoe affair between macleane
and rebecca is no different
, emotionless
and unrealistic
. when the scirpt calls forthe macleane to decide vetween going tothe america
and gonig tothe meet his lover
, there isnt no reason forthe us to believe it would be worth it for him to abondon his gool
; he
and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film
. plunkett
and macleane whants desperately to be a triumph ofthe style over substance
but sicne its stlye
, quite frankly
, blows
, the film has no hope of succeeding onthe any levle
. i wnated to appreciate thsi movei on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace
bu i couldn ' t
-
- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache
.
