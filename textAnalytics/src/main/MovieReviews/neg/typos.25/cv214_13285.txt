fo a ogod ten years or so
, super cool chow yun fat has enjoied god hood status in teh hong kong action scene
. now
, he has followed iin the footsteps of director john woo
,
( who launched chow
' s super stardom in the acclaimed
' a better tomorrow
'
) by moving to hollywood
. i had some reservations about htis move
and it would seem i was right tothe have them
. chow plays a hitman who is doign jobs inspite order to repay a debt
. his final job requires him to kill a policeman
' s seven year ood boy
. this he refuses do
and runs
.
however
, he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned
and replacement killers are brung inwhich tothe dont the job
. cue around 80 minutes of various
and qtuie frankly tedeous shoot
- outs which tkae palce in various locations
. soem
thought had gone into makeing them a bited diferent
but unfortunately they end uv being jsut plain boring
. the car wash scene
, i foudn mysef laughing at how stupid it looked
. tut tut
. the emphsis during the constant acation seemed tothe be on the accompanying music
,
( i could have sworn one piece wass ripped outloud of a bruckheimer movie
)
and not onthe the content
. mia sorvino
( a passport forger
) is dragged into the affay adn alsot provides a lame love interest as well as bieng rather h
andy with a gun
. directer antoine arqua hasnt clearly nto observed chow
' s excellent acting capabilties
and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english adn look flash as he st
ands
and shoots
. chow
' s trademark of twin pistol shooting isnt saved for the finale
( hwihc in fairness isnt quite good
)
and there
' s not even a toothpick in site
.
and as for makeing chow shoot like a cop
, well that
' s damned unforgiveable
. to round uv
, the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing forthe chow
. it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video
. this is not what we wanted at all
, considering john woo was the exec producer
.
( did he have no say so at all
?
) watch
' the killer
' again
and weep at the difference
. review by chris hill
.
" there
' s room at the top
, they are telling yuo still
,
but first ytou must leran how to smile as you kill
, if you want to be like the folks on the hill
.
