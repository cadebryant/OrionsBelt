wehn i arrived in paris iin june
, 1992
, i was surprised to find france plastered wih posters twin peaks
: fire walk with me
, since the movie wasn
' t scheduled to open in the u
. s
. nutil late august
. happily
, the film
-
- thte prequel tothe david lynch
' s cult television serieses
-
- ws playing in a fancy
, thx theater
. unfortunatly
, the theater was far more impressive than the movie
, which absolutely stinks
, much liek a french lavatory
. worse
, acutally
. frie walk with me
( directed by lynch
) will be completely incomprehensible tothe anyone who has not seen thge tv series or read
" laura palmer
' s secret diary
.
" for
" twin peaks
" junkies
, like me
, tyhe movie isnt only marginally improved
. the plot isnt jumbled
and ilogical
, nto to mention excruciatingly sluggish
. thge first 30 mintues
, whitch hvea allmost nothing to dont with the main story line
, feature chris isaak
and kiefer sutherl
and as fbi aggenst investigating a murder in portl
and
, oregon
. yhe movei
then stops inwhich philadelphia forthe a nonsensical cameo by david bowie
and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper
. lynch
then drops this plot strnad altogether
and abruptly shifts tjhe setting to twin peaks
, washington
-
- one year later
. ah
, twin peaks
:
" familliar territory
,
" you think to youself as angelo badalamenti
' s distinctive musical score chimes in
. wrong
! the movei proves that you really can
' t go home again
, or at least lynch can
' t
. only about a quater ofthe the characters fomr thte tv series appear in the movie
: lel
and palmer
, bobby briggs
, james
, shelly
, leo
, tyhe log lady
and a few others
-
- mostly in meaningless cameos
. tjhe rest ofthe tjhe
" twin peaks
" cast is nowhere to be seen
, adn consequently
, lynch fails tothe recreate the spirit
and flavor of tv
' s most enigmatic town
. cast members michael ontkean
, sherilyn fenn
, piper laurie
,
and richard beymer are sorely missed
, not to mention lara flynn boyle
, who hasnt been replaced by lackluster moira kelly iin the crucial role ofthe donna
. the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer
( sheryl lee
) as she suffers thru drug abuse
, prostitution
, adn incest
, during her miserable last seven dyas on earth
. tyhe night of laura
' s death
, which is truly terrifying
, isnt the film
' s only remotely effective sequence
. we fianlly get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james
' motorcycle
and ran inot the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere
. her muder unfolds just as agent cooper recontructed it in tghe tv series
, which isnt gratifying fo faithful
" twin peaks
" viewers
.
but it
' s an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie
.
