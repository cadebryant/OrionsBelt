" desperate measures
" isnt a generic title for a film that
' s beyond generic
. it
' s also a depressing waste of talent
, with the solid team of michael keaton
and
andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, not tothe mention once
- cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of nto
- cool flicks
-
- this thriller is more
" before
and after
" than
" reveral of fortune
.
" the movei is a big dissappointment
,
and
yet it
' s somewhat easy tothe see what motiviated such big names tothe attach themselves to it
-
- the premise is both promising
and intriguing
. too bad the execution
' s all wrong
,
though
, baceause the set
- up of
" desperate measures
" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) is a single pparent iwth a troubling dilemma
-
- his son matt
( joseph cross
) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission
. even worse
, the onyl compatiable donor is voilent sociopath peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currently serving a life sentence forthe multiple murders
and other various crimes against society
. connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery
; he
' s at firt reluctant
,
but reconsiders affter he realizes he cant plan his escape at teh hospital
. when he does make a run for it
, connor offers close persuit
,
but for different reasons than his superiors
( including the crusty brian cox
)
-
- tehy watn to take mccabe down
, hwile connor needs to keep him alive
, or all hope isnt lost for his little boy
. one misstep
" desperate measures
" makes isnt in its undevelopment of matt
' s illness
. what
' s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match thta works
; there would seem to be otehr possable contenders somewhere in tjhe country
,
and thus many of the ways that connor endangers tghe lives of himself
and thsoe around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard tothe swallow
. tkae
, for example
, a scene where mccabe isnt trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections ofthe the hospital
. the polical have their spotlight
and guns aimed right on him
,
and what does connor do
? he shoots tyhe spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight
. connor knows vyre well what dangerous deeds this guy is capible of
,
and
yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually git to
and try to harm his son
. whatever
. to be fair
,
though
, thte lack ofthe stroy background isnt the least of the movei
' s problems
. firt
and formost isnt how cheaply
" desperate measures
" trades the potential of it
' s opening scenes for the routine acation ballistics of its fianl hour
. once mccabe escapes
, the film becomes the fugitive inaddition reverse
and witht noone thrills
. there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton onyl tothe have him grab a hostage
and get away
. also
, the movie is so entent on giving you a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villain
( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter
, natch
) that it completely casts garcia
' s frank connor by the dullsville wayside
;
" desperate measures
" appears to liuke its antagonist so much more tahn its protagnoist
,
and the movie
' s head
- scratcher of a send
- off confirms this
. htere is some good tothe be found amoungst this mess
, particularly in the acting department
. cast against tipe
, michael keaton
' s understated menace is highly effective
.
al
though he
' s nto given much believable to work with
,
andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. jospeh cross
, as garicia
' s ailing son
, is surprisingly unsentimental
,
and marcia gay harden lends solid wupport as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos
. this casted does its best to camouflage hte sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending
,
but most is lost
. it goes without saying that
" desperate measures
" needs an operation of its very pwn
.
