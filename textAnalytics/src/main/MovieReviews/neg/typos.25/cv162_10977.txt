" desperate measures
" is a generic title for a film thyat ' s beyond generic
. it ' s also a depressing waste of talent
, with tje solid team of michael keaton
anbd andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, not to mention once
- kool directer barbet schroeder sadly continueing his string of not
- kool flicks
-
- this thriller is omre
" before
and after
" than
" reversal ofthe fortune
.
" the movie is a big dissappointment
,
and
yet it ' s somewhat eazy to see what motiviated such big names to attatch themselves to it
-
- the premise is both promising
and intriguing
. too bad the execution ' s all wrong
,
though
, because the set
- up of
" desperate measures
" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve tothe be put to far better ule
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) is a single parent witht a troubling dilemma
-
- his son matt
( joseph cross
) isnt stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push inot remission
. even worse
, the only compatible donor isnt violent sociopath peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currently serving a life sentence for mutiple murders
and other various crimes aginst society
. connor trys his best to convince mccabe to go allong with yhe surgery
; he ' s at first reluctant
,
but reconsiders aftter he realizes he can plan his excape at the hospital
. when he does make a run for it
, connor offers close pursuit
,
but fo diferrent reasons than his superiors
( including tje crusty brian cox
)
-
- they want to tkae mccabe down
, while connor needs to keep him alive
, or all hope is lost for his little boy
. one misstep
" desperate measures
" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt ' s illness
. whta ' s needed are more details as to exactlly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works
; there would seem tothe be other possible contenders somewhere in tyhe country
,
and thus many ofthe thte ways that connor endangers the lives of himself
and those around him by attempting tothe keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow
. tkae
, for example
, a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital
. the police have their spotlight
and guns aimed right on him
,
and waht does connor dont
? he shoots the spotlight outloud so that mccabe can continue his flight
. connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of
,
anbd
yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to
and try to harm his son
. whatever
. tothe be fair
,
though
, the lack of storey background is hte least of the movie ' s problems
. first
anbd formost is how cheaply
" desperate measures
" trades teh potential of it ' s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour
. once mccabe escapes
, the film becomes the fugitive in reverse
and with noone thrills
. ther are countless scenes where tghe ogod guys catch up tothe keaton only to have him grab a hostage
and get away
. also
, the movie is so intent on giving ytou a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villain
( the ads have compaired peter mccabe to hannibal lechter
, natch
) thgat it completely casts garcia ' s frank connor by the dullsville wayside
;
" desperate measures
" appears tothe like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist
,
and the movei ' s head
- scratcher of a send
- off confirms this
. there is some ogod to be found amoungst this mess
, partciularly in the acting department
. casted against type
, michael keaton ' s understated menace is highly effective
.
although he ' s not given much believable to work with
, andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. joseph cross
, as garicia ' s ailing son
, is surprisingly unsentimental
,
and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player iin the unfolding chaos
. this cast does its best to camouflage tjhe sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending
,
but most is lost
. it goes wihtout saying that
" desperate measures
" needs an opperation ofthe its very own
.
