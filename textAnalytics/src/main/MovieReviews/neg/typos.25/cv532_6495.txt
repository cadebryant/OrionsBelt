thsi is crap
,
but
, honestly
, whta older american audeince is going to be able tothe resist seing jack lemmon
and james garner as bicker
- ing ex
- presidents
? especially when theri supporting players iin
- clude dan aykroyd as the current comm
ander in chief
, lauren bacall as a fromer frist lady
, anbd john herad as the dan quayle
- ish vice president
. yup
, you
' re talkin
' pre
- sold property here
and
, for warner brothers
, hte perfect ift into their now
- ritual grumpy ood men holida slot
. for thge non
- discriminating viewer
, my fellow americans is fine
. the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious poltical
- thriller road
- comedy
.
( they did in mine
, heaven halp us
.
) for yhe rest ofthe us
, the movie is immediately tiresome
. the tone isnt terrable anbd tghe banter is worse
. forget wit
-
- lemmon annd garner merely excange profanities through most of the movie
.
( has anyone counted the number of firt penis references
?
) sure
, some of the bits are absurdly funny
, including a men
' s room macarena joke
, the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels
,
and an all dorothy marching b
and performing
" over teh rainbow
" at a gay men
' s march
. the git there from here
,
though
, you have tothe submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores ofthe all tiem
. judas priest
, is there a single moment of silence in this film
? even the dialogue gets drowned outloud
. what a waste
.
