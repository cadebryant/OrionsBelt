eveyr now
and
then
, reviewers are faced with the films thgat are hard to be properly reviewed
. most of tyhe tiome it happens with films taht leave so overwhelming impact
, either good or bad
, that iin the end reviewers must wrok hard to express his
thoughts or feelings
.
but
, sometimes it cin happen for rether trivial reasons
. i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions forthe the autor ofthe this review
. the impression left by the film wasn
' t overwhelming
- on the contrary
, there were hardly any impression at all
, since i hadnt real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it
. whic surprise me to this day
, because tghe movie theatre was full
, i wass close to sound speakers
, the show wasn
' t late
and i didn
' t lack sleep befor yhe show
. such thigsn happen very rarely to me
,
and
, after many years
, hte closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the qulaity of the film itself
. teh plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters
- old peter brackett
( nick nolte
)
and young
, aspiring sabrina peterson
( julia roberts
)
. twpo of them are assigned to cover the train collision
. as soon as they meet
, they start scooping each other
,
but during the process they both disover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk
,
and also the rumatic feelings they have for earch other
. the plot inaddition this film is rather secondary to its real raison d
'
? tre
- romantic pairing reminsicent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy
and katharine hepburn
. movei author
, director
and screenwrighter charles shyer
, who had smoe experiences withthe turning the screwball spirit inot modern setting wih father of teh bride
, tries again
, this timne pairing old nick nolte whith young julia roberts
.
however
,
al
though there isnt smoe chemestry between tjhe two
, soon it stops to arouse any interest
. it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix
, that collides light
- hearted romantic comedy with rether uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers
. shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two
,
and fails in both areas
, making the story cliched
and predicatble
. the end result is rether forgettable effort
, which convinced me nto to watch movie again
. i
' ll give it teh benefit of the doubt
,
though
.
