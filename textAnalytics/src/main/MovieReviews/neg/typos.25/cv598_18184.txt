every now
and
thne
, reviewers are faced with the films thta are hard to be properly reviewed
. most ofthe the time it happens with films tht leave so overwelming impact
, either ogod or bad
, that in tyhe end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings
.
but
, sometimes it cant happen forthe rether trivial reasons
. i love trouble happended tothe be one ofthe such ocasions for the author of this review
. the impression left by the film wasn ' t overwelming
- on the contrary
, ther were hardly any impression at all
, since i hadnt real trouble keeping mysef awake hwile watching it
. which suprise me to this day
, becuase thge movie theatre was full
, i ws close tothe soudn speakers
, the show wasn ' t late
and i didn ' t lack sleep before the sohw
. such things happen vyer rarely to me
,
and
, aftter many eyars
, the closest thing tothe solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself
. the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters
- old peter brackett
( nick nolte
)
and young
, aspiring sabrina peterson
( julia roberts
)
. two of them are assigned to cover the train collision
. as soon as they meet
, they start scooping each other
,
but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk
,
and alsot tghe romantic feelings htey have forthe each other
. the plot in this film is rether secondry to its real raison d '
? tre
- rumatic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy
anbd katharine hepburn
. movie autor
, directer
and screenwriter charles shyer
, who had some experiences iwth turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride
, tries agian
, this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts
.
however
,
although there is some chemestry between tje twpo
, soon it stops to arouse any interest
. it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix
, that collides light
- hearted romantic comedy with rether uninteresting plot suitable tothe pure action thrillers
. shyer as director fails to make tje proper transition between the two
,
and fails in both areas
, mkaing the story cliched
and predictable
. the end result is rather forgettable effort
, which convinced me nto to watch movie again
. i ' ll give it thte benifit of thge doubt
,
though
