: when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he hadnt made a nmae for himself as a first
- rate comic book penciller onthe the
" spider
- man
" titles
) to join teh newly
- formed
, creater
- owned image comics
, a new comic book legend was born
: spawn
. mcfarlane
' s
" spawn
" immediately became a commercial
and critical success adn a defining comic book series of the 1990s
. mcfarlane created a hero who ws not only original
but visually intricate
, alowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail tothe the max
. the easly
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane
' s genius at illustration
and show his early attempts at writing
. withthe the popularaty ofthe
" spawn
"
and the success of the current warner bros
.
' s batman film franchise
, a movei verison of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn
. in the summer of 1997
, hence
, new line cinema released spawn
, a live
- action film based onthe the groundbreaking series
. this topheavy exercise in voilence
and special effects unfortunatly topples quickly annd leaves fans of the comic book
, like me
, numbed by how much spawn misses the mark
. what happened
? why is spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire
and even appears in a cameo
. i don
' t htink
, howver
, that his presence necessarily hurt
( or helped
) the film
. i place tje blame
, in part
, on the receet hollywood trend
, fueled by public dem
and apparently
, for special effects blow
- out movies utilizing the latest computer technology
. these films focus upon the effects at tje expense of everthing else
: chracter
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting this trend
, shows the audience oney gratuitous scene after anohter populated with morphing characters
and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires
, explosions
, knives
and chains appearing out of nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constantly transforming demons
. a lot of it is visually interesting
and technically solid
, don
' t get me wrong
,
but
, because the script
and casted aren
' t engaging
, spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper
( the surface may capture the eye
,
but nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn
' s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level
. mcfarlane
' s spawn wass a tortured hero
. a mercenary by trade
, al simmons was nonetheless a warm man inaddition love with the beautyfull w
anda
. hvaing died
and journied to hell
, he made a pact to return tothe earth to be with w
anda
. simmons
,
however
, discovers that his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
,
and his wief marryied
. despite his sometimes violent nature
, readers couldn
' t help
but feel sympathetic toward his plight as tje spawn of the underworld
. spawn attempts tothe show all of this
but doesnt not spend nearly yhe tiome it should tothe do so
. when the characters are developed
, they seem absurd rather than touching
. the cartoonish dialogue
and implausible subplot
( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat
- 16 wich he wishes to unleash to enslave the world
) do not help matters
. spawn
, iin an apparent attempt tothe duplicate the succsess of batman
, alsot unwisely spends too much timne on a villain
, the violator
( batman favored the joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, liek jack nicholson infront batman
, receives top billing in thte cast as the violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) isnt second
. i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems tothe make him a perfect c
andadate for the violator
. the film
, howver
, spends so much time on the violator
' s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves
. aparently meant to be the comic relief iin the film
( as nicholson ws inwhich batman
)
, expecially when contrasted with the sullen spawn
, the violator
' s lines are oftentimes grotesque
and unfunny
, leaving the audiance wishing he would leave
. leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role
,
but he isnt seen far too oftenly in the film
. michael jai white
, a relative newcomer to theatrical releases
, seems to be an appealing actor
, anbd he h
andles his role adequately
,
but we see little ofthe him without various masks on
. more time needed to be spended on white
' s charcter befoer he became spawn fo the movei to pull at the heartstrings
. a speshal onot should be made about martin sheen as the over
- the
- top
, obnoxious
, evil general wynn
. easily the hammiest performence inthe the movie
, it
' s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much
; after all
, he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly inthe the great apocalypse now
. sheen
' s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villian adn comes as a surprise concidering his exstensive carreer infront film
. many other elements conspire with the disappointing script annd abundant special effects tothe drag spawn down
. mtv
- style
, jerky
, in
- your
- face editting is one of them
. flames
, fo example
, roll acros the screen somtimes to announce a shift in setting
. cogliostro
, unlikely wannabe giude for spawn
, serves as a poor narrator for the film
. he goofily tells the audience
, at noe point
, that
" how much of
[ spawn
' s
] humanity is left remains to be seen
,
" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another
. tjhe music
, fianlly
, assaults the audience as much as the manic violence
and offensive dialogue
. loud adn obnoxious hard rock fused wih drum loops dominate some scenes
. to be fair
, howver
, marilyn manson
' s
" long hard road out of hell
" effectively compliments spawn
' s return to earth
, while filter annd hte crystal method
' s
"
( can
' t ytou
) trip like i do
" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song
. for as good a comic book as it is
,
" spawn
" did not spawn a ogod movei
. spawn
, instade
, suffers from too much pomp adn circumstance
, anbd too little plot
and carachter development
. it receives two stars for its technically well
- done spacial effects
. many other films
,
though
, have equal
, if not superior
, special effects
and are much better
. rated pg
- 13
, spawn seems more violent than many r
- rated movies
and probably wouldn
' t be apropriate for the very young
.
