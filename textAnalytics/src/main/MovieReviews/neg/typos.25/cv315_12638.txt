. comments
: when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he had made a name fo himself as a first
- rate comic book penciller on the
" spider
- man
" titles
) to join the newly
- formed
, creator
- owned image comics
, a newyorker comic book legend ws born
: spawn
. mcfarlane ' s
" spawn
" immediately became a commercial
and critical success
and a defining comic book serieses ofthe the 1990s
. mcfarlane creaeted a hero who was not only original
bu visually intricate
, allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max
. the early
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane ' s genuis at illustration
and show his early attempts at writing
. witht the popularaty of
" spawn
"
anbd the succes of the current warner bros
. ' s batman film franchise
, a movie version ofthe some sort seemed inevitable for spawn
. in tje summer of 1997
, hence
, newyorker line cinema released spawn
, a live
- action film based on the groundbreaking sories
. this topheavy exercise in violence
and special effects unfortunately topples quickly
anbd leaves fans of yhe comic book
, liek me
, numbed by how much spawn misses thge mark
. what happended
? why is spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire
and even appears in a cameo
. i don ' t think
,
however
, that his presence necessarily hurt
( or helpped
) the film
. i place the blame
, in part
, on the reccent hollywood trend
, fueled by public demand apparantly
, for special effects blow
- out movies utilizing yhe latest computer tecnology
. these films focus upon yhe effects at the expense ofthe everything else
: character
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting this trend
, shows tje audience one gratuitious scene after anohter populated with morphing characters
and filled wtih unnecessary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires
, explosions
, knives
and chains appearing out of nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constantly transforming demons
. a lot of it isnt visually intresting
and technically solid
, don ' t git me wrong
,
but
, beacuse the scirpt
and cast aren ' t engaging
, spawn ultimatly comes across liek overwrought wallpaper
( the surface may capture yhe eye
,
bu nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn ' s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline levle
. mcfarlane ' s spawn was a tortured hero
. a mercenary by trade
, al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in lvoe with the beautiful wanda
. having died
and journied to hell
, he made a pact to return tothe earth tothe be with wanda
. simmons
,
however
, dicovers tyhat his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
,
and his wife marryed
. despite his somtimes violent nature
, readers couldn ' t help
bu feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld
. spawn attempts to sohw all of this
bu does not spend nearly teh time it shoudln to do so
. when the characters are developed
, htey seem absurd rather than touching
. hte cartoonish dialogue
adn implausible subplot
( a general possesses teh anticdote to a supervirus called heat
- 16 which he wishes tothe unleash to enslave the world
) dont not help matters
. spawn
, inwhich an apparent attempt tothe duplicate the success ofthe batman
, also unwisely spends too much time on a villin
, tghe violator
( batman favored teh joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, like jack nicholson in batman
, recieves top billing infact the cast as the violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) isnt second
. i oridinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presense in films which seems to mkae him a perfect candidate for hte violator
. thge film
,
however
, spends so much time on the violator ' s offensive antics that they grate onthe the nerves
. apparently meant to be the comic releaf in tjhe film
( as nicholson was in batman
)
, especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn
, thge violator ' s lines are oftentimes grotesque
and unfunny
, leaving the audience wishing he would leave
. leguizamo does a satisfactory job inthe yhe role
,
but he is seen far too oftenly inthe the film
. michael jai white
, a relative newcomer to theatrical releases
, seems to be an appealling actor
,
and he handles his role adequately
,
but we see little of him without various masks on
. more time needed to be spent onthe white ' s charater before he became spawn for the movie tothe pull at yhe heartstrings
. a special note shoud be made about martin sheen as tyhe over
- the
- top
, obnoxious
, evil genaral wynn
. easily tyhe hammiest performance in the movie
, it ' s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much
; after all
, he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the gerat apocalypse nowe
. sheen ' s excessive damenor do not halp the audience accept him as a mastermind villain
anbd comes as a surprise concidering his exstensive career in film
. many otehr elements conspire witht the disappointing script
and abundat special effects to drag spawn down
. mtv
- sytle
, jerky
, inspite
- your
- face editting is one of them
. flames
, for example
, roll accros teh screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting
. cogliostro
, unlikely wannabe guide for spawn
, serves as a poor narrator for the film
. he goofily tells thte audience
, at one point
, that
" how much of
[ spawn ' s
] humanity isnt left rimaniss tothe be seen
,
" as if tjhe audience really cares as oen violent sequence leads to another
. the music
, finally
, assaults the audience as much as tyhe manic violence
and offensive dialogue
. loud
annd obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes
. to be fair
,
however
, marilyn manson ' s
" long hard road out ofthe hell
" effectively compliments spawn ' s return to earth
, while filter
and tghe crystal method ' s
"
( can ' t you
) trip like i do
" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song
. forthe as good a comic book as it isnt
,
" spawn
" did not spawn a good movie
. spawn
, instead
, suffers fomr too much pomp
adn circumstance
,
and too littel plot
and character development
. it recieves two stars for its technically well
- done special effects
. many otehr films
,
though
, have equal
, if not superior
, special effects
and are much better
. rated pg
- 13
, spawn seems more voilent than many r
- rated movies
and probably wouldn ' t be appropriate forthe tghe veyr young
.
