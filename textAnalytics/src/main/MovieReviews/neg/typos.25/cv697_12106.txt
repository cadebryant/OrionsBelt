" marie couldn
' t talk
,
" paulie
, the parrot star of his pwn movie
, tells us baout the daughter in his original family
.
" dad couldn
' t listen
.
and mom couldn
' t cope
, so they got rid of me
.
" paulie
, the authobiography of a talking
, not merely a mimicking
, parrot
, has jay mohr inspite the lead role of the bird
- the voice
, not thte body
- adn as teh minor charcter of benny
, a small
- time crook who uses paulie tothe pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms
. as the parrot
, mohr is delightful whn director john roberts allows him to cut up
. benny
, onthe the other h
and
, is a character you
' ve seen a thous
and times before
,
and mohr brings nothing new to that role
. roberts
' s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig
' s script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor bu creates soem definite problems
. when a kids
' movei whants tothe mosey allong
, watch out
. if the material is not crisp
and perfectly composed
, beauty can sometimes dissolve inot tedium
. so it is with paulie
. when they let their bird do his st
and
- uv comedy routines
, the show hums
and the audience roars
. too often
, howver
, a sleepy silence ensues among tghe viewers as they wait for the story tothe pickup agina
. tony shalhoub
, the smart
- mouthed chef from big night
, plays misha
, a recent russian immigrant tothe the u
. s
. he hadnt been a teacher of literature at home
,
but nowe he makes his living as a janitor inaddition the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study
.
al
though misha gets a few nice lines
(
" i
' m russina
. i like long stries
.
"
)
, his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy
. besides paulie
, the only charater worth noting
- other than 2 cute small parts palyed by cheech marin
and gina rowl
ands
- is the speech
- impaired marie
, played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer
, 5
- yera
- old hallie kate eisenberg
. naturally enchanting
, she gives the picture genuine heart
. the bad news is tht her part is confined to the first half
. hte best scenes have the bird dancing adn strutting tothe show off his comedic skills
. when marie
' s family gets a cat
, for example
, the bird
, who hasn
' t wanted to learn how to fly nutil
then
, tkaes an instant interest in soaring
. tricking tjhe cat while insulting him at the same tyme
, paulie calls him a stupid hairball
. their rapid physical antics add to thte humor of the situation
. it
' s good quality sitcom material
but performed by animals
. when oney ofthe the humans without much of a voice begins tothe sing
, paulie cringes
.
" i
' m a bird
,
" he explains with his frequentily subtle humer
.
" i have a small brain
,
and it
' s about to explode
.
" the movie contains rich doses of john debney
' s dreamy music
. with hevy uise of a solo violin
, he keeps reinforcing thte film
' s heart
- warming themes
.
and when paulie finally takes off inspite flight
, the orchestra comes up loud annd strong with cymbals clashing
.
" it
' s a long story
,
" says paulie
.
" it
' s the only kind he knows
,
" reflects misha
. annd the motion picture
, which runs the st
andart length for a kids
' movei
, still fiels too long
. the best parts are enthralling
,
but
then there are all of thsoe dead spots in
- beetwen
. paulie isnt a movie tyhat never qtuie lives up to its promise
but manages tothe charm nevertheless
. paulie runs 1
: 32
. it is raged pg fo a fewd mild profanities
and would be fine for all ages
. my son
, jeffrey
, age 9
, gave thge movie
*
* with his biggest complaint being that there wasn
' t enough action
. he
thought paulie was funny
,
and the actress that played marie was quite good
. his friend sam
, allmost 9
, throught the movei wass
" awesome
, excelent
,
"
and gavey it
*
*
*
*
. he
thought paulie was good
,
but he didn
' t believe the way marie
' s speech impediment was acted
.
