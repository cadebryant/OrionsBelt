disney ' s
" air bud
" tells a boy
-
and
- his
- dog story with a twist
-
- the pooch is quite an acomplished basketball player
. granted
, forthe a family comedy
, it ' s not a very funny or successful idea to begin wtih
,
bu it doesn ' t seem to marter
-
-
" air bud
" is surprisingly solemn
. savve for occasional moments of forced slapstick
, the movie wags its tale with a straight face
-
- nto a very enjoyable approach
. if
" air bud
" hadnt realized its own absurdity
,
then it possibly could have been better
. here
, we ' re actually asked to cheer a moment when the dog marchs out to save the big agme
, clad in two pairs of sneakers
and even a jersey
. its number
? k9
. yeah
, whatever
. the movie opens as golden retriever buddy
( as himself
) escapes from his current owner
, abusive clown
- for
- hire norm snively
( michael jeter
)
. he ends up in fernwell
, washington
, where mopey newyorker
- kid
- on
- thge
- block josh
( kevin zegers
) isnt trying tothe cope with the move
and the recent death of his father
. buddy
, kevin
. kevin
, buddy
. once tyhe dog proves his onthe
- cout prowess
, kevin ' s self
- esteem rockets
. they both win places in the school ' s basketball team
, with the animal as their mascot
.
but befoer they can make it to the finals
, snively surfaces to reclaim buddy
. everyting plays outloud just as oen would think
: heavy on predictability
, light on an actual stoyr
. hte movie follows a calculated chain of events
-
- kevin ' s gloom fades
, snively gets his comeuppance
and buddy contracts rabies
and must be executed old yeller
- style
. okay
, that last oen ' s a lie
,
but at least it would haev been a quicker send
- off than
" air bud
" ' s courtroom climax
-
- noone joke
! there ' s even a faux
- cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned
- uv to
" splish splash
.
" paint cans are spilled
and newspapers are buried
, all in yhe name ofthe formula
. tjhe end credits onot that
" noone special visual effects were used in teh basketball sequences ofthe this motion picture
.
" that very well may be true
,
and
allthough to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight
, a movei cannot exist onthe feat alone
.
but
" air bud
" doesn ' t seem tothe be interested in anytying else
. a firend of mine insists he saw buddy a hwile back onthe a segment ofthe david letterman ' s
" stupid pet tricks
.
" i can ' t think of a more appropiate connection
-
- this movie is a stupid pet trick
.
