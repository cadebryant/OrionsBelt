" tells a boy
-
and
- his
- dog story with a twist
-
- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player
. granted
, forthe a family comedy
, it
' s not a veyr funny or successful idae tothe begin whith
,
but it doesn
' t seem to matter
-
-
" air bud
" isnt suprisingly solemn
. save forthe ocasional moments of forced slapstick
, the movie wags its tale withthe a straight face
-
- not a very enjoyable approach
. if
" air bud
" hadnt realized its own absurdity
,
then it possably coudl ahev been better
. here
, we
' re actually asked tothe cheer a moment when the dog marches out tothe save the big game
, clad infront two pairs of sneakers
and even a jersey
. its number
? k9
. yeah
, whatever
. yhe movie opens as golden retriever buddy

" air bud
"
' s courtroom climax
-
- no joke
! there
' s even a faux
- cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned
- uv to
" splish splash
.
" paint cans are spilled
and newspapers are buried
, all in the nmae of formula
. teh end credits note that
" no special visual effects were used infact tghe basketball sequences of this motion picture
.
" that very well may be true
,
and
al
though to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight
, a movie cannot exsist on feat alone
