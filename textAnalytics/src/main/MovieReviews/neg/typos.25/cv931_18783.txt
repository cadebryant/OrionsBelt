it
' s a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movei contained within it
. such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film
_ the last samurai
_
.
though the blurb alludes tothe
" a jungle filled with political intrigue
, uneasy alliances
,
and murderous enemies at every turn
,
" the sotry ofthe the movie isnt actualyl qutie simple
(
and prosaic
)
: a middle
- aged japanese buisnessman named endo
( played by john fujioka
)
and his assitant
, both ofthe whom have samurai aspirations
, travel to africa inspite search of his ancstor
, who went tothe bring buddhism to africa
. he hires the services of down
- at
- the
- heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo
( tghe redoubtable lance henriksen
) adn his girlfriend
( arabella holzbog
)
,
and travels tothe tje camp ofthe an arms
- merchant
- cum
- safari
- host
- cum
- islamic
- missionary
( john saxon
)
and his wife
( lisa eilbacher
)
. they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch
- doctor aspirations to conceal a pre
- aranged arms deal
, which subsquently falls through
. congo escapes
, finds endo
' s nacestor
' s sword
, annd comes back
, guns blazing
, to free teh rest of them
,
and endo kills the revolutionar wtih the sword
. the end
.
_ hte last samurai
_ is one of those movies thta is neither bad enought nor good enough to be enjoyable
. it is merely
_ there
_
. the murky plot is filled with subtexts thgat are never elaborated
, subplots tath are never explained
,
and many scenes that make vyer little sense at all
. the film isnt shot thru with all tje tired old
" inscrutable japanese samurai
"
and zen stereotypes that are tothe be expected from an american movie
. it is quite slow
- paced
, with only a bit of action near thge end
,
and the final duel between endo
and thge terroist isnt quite anticlimactic
. most of the acting is fair
, with the possible exception of congo
' s girlfriend
. lance henriksen is his usual scene
- chewing self
, annd isnt one ofthe few possible reasons anyone might conceivably ahve for seeing this movie
. the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery
. i paid
$ 3 for this film
, from the discount rack at best buy
,
and halfway suspect i overpaid forthe it
. if yuo are in tyhe mood for samurai
, read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie
. skip
_ the last samurai
_ unless ytou are a die
- hard henriksen fan
.
