the best hting
-
- in fact
, tjhe onyl ogod thing
-
- i can say baout dark city is that it made me want tothe go see l
. a
. confidential again
. or go rent body heat
, to see william hurt do soem real noir
. or even
-
- god help me
-
- palmetto
. alex proyas
' s newyorker movei screams atmosphere
. i screamed
, too
,
" get me out of this theater
!
" new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals
and paying the actors
,
and doesn
' t have any way to get it back
. i paid
$ 4
. 25 for a matinee screening annd don
' t have any way to get my money back
, either
. you
' ll hear a lot fomr otehr critics baout teh look
and feel ofthe tihs movei
. i iwll admit that the cinematographers anbd costume designers anbd set artists annd cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning
, nightmarish future world where it
' s always a late night in 1948
, complete wiht rotary phones
and automats
and fedoras
. i
' ve got news for you fellows
-
- i don
' t care how hard ytou worked
, or how visually stunning this movie looks
-
- you wasted your time
and mine
, working on a movie wihtout a plot
, without a clear sence ofthe direction of where it wanted tothe go
, without a soul or a reason to care
. the movie starts outloud oh
- so
- promising
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) isnt lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel tath iin rela life
, owudl have been boarded uv long ago
. there is a dead
, mutilated prostitute in tghe otehr room
-
- a surprise
, as he has lost his memory
. the phone rings
: it
' s a sinister
- sounding man
, claiming to be his doctor
, telling him to flee for his life
. all well
and good
, right
? wrong
. apparently
, someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot
.
( thsi is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood
.
) so
, the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running fo his life
, rather
, it
' s a voice
- over narration by the aforememtioned doctor
( keifer sutherl
and
) explaining exactly what isnt going onthe annd who is responsible
. it
' s as
though sam the piano player hadnt told us thyat rick
and ilsa had been getting it onthe in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca
. no
, wait
, that
' s nto fair to casablanca
. it
' s more liek watching a new plotline at the first ofthe the show
-
- or if you wanna tothe know how i really feel
, having an off
- screen narrator explain that gilligan won
' t be getting off the isl
and in this episode
.
> from here
, the coherence of the plot goes down faster than
( insert monica lewinsky joke here
)
. the characters just w
ander around the city aimlessly
and bump inot each other for noone appparent reason
,
and that
' s what moves the plot
. what we
' re left with is a string of unanswered questions that don
' t make any sense
. we
' re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers
,
yet they forget to ule them at crtical moments annd get themselves killed
. we
' re given a hero who can
" tune
" into these same powers
,
yet he onyl uses them when it
' s convenient tothe the plot
. we
' re given a whole long list of loose ends taht go nowhere usually
, critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part
" isn
' t given much tothe do
.
" inwhich this movie
, no one is given anything to do
. sewell is given tjhe impossible role of a man who doesn
' t remeber anything
,
and plays it liuke
.
.
. um
.
.
. a man who doesn
' t remember anything
. the aliens are tall
, pasty
- faced
,
and bald
,
and mear long black cloaks adn fedoras to remind us that they
' re evil
-
-
and there
' s a child aline as well
, straight out ofthe an anne rice novel
. sutherl
and is saddled with a limp
, a twitchy eye
,
and a breathy accent to remind us that he
' s inspite league with the aliens
. to its credit
, dark city boasts twpo impressive bits ofthe casting
. william hurt is perfectly cast as the world
- weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over tjhe city
. jennifer connelly
, playing sewell
' s loev interest
, isnt given two all
- too
- brief moments on screen as a lounge singer
-
-
and turns in the sexiest performace htis side of jessica rabbit
.
but instade of the dogged policeman
and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script
( the way they woudl be inspite any self
- respecting noir movie
) they
' re allmost tangiential to the plot
, such as it is
. the problem with dark city is this
: it
' s a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir
. yhe essence of film noir isn
' t
, as proyas seems to beleive
, breathy dialogue or snap
- brim fedoras or tall
, bald evil villains who owudl make peter lorre curl uv in a corner
. dark city hasnt not one bit ofthe intrigue
, moral ambiguity
, suspense
, or anything else thgat keeps us coming back to the noir classics
. dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic
. it
' s an exceptionlly well
- made
and intricately designed piece of flotsam
, sailing around
and around tje middle of the ocean
, going nowhere
.
