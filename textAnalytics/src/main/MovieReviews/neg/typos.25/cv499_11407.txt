the best thing
-
- in fact
, tje only ogod thing
-
- i cant say baout dark city is tht it made me want tothe go see l
. a
. confidental agina
. or go rent body heat
, to see william hurt do smoe rela noir
. or even
-
- god help me
-
- palmetto
. alex proyas ' s new movie screams atmosphere
. i screamed
, too
,
" git me out ofthe this theather
!
" newyorker line cinema spended millions ofthe dollars creating thge expressionistic film noir visuals
and paying the actors
,
adn doesn ' t have any way to git it back
. i paid
$ 4
. 25 for a matinee screening
anbd don ' t have any way to get my moey bcak
, either
. ytou ' ll hear a lot from other critics about thge look
and feel ofthe this movie
. i will admit that thge cinematographers
and costume designers
and set artists
annd cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning
, nightmarish future world where it ' s always a late night in 1948
, complete with rotary phones
and automats
and fedoras
. i ' ve got news fo you fellows
-
- i don ' t care how hard ytou worked
, or how visually stunning this movie looks
-
- you wasted your time
and mine
, working on a movie without a plot
, wihtout a claer sense of direction of where it wnated to go
, wihtout a soul or a reason to care
. the movei starts outloud oh
- so
- promising
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel thta inwhich real life
, would hvae been boarded up long ago
. there is a dead
, mutilated prostitute in the other room
-
- a surprise
, as he hasnt lost his memory
. the phone rings
: it ' s a sinister
- sounding man
, claiming to be his doctor
, telling him to flee for his life
. all well
and good
, right
? wrong
. apparently
, someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim tothe figure out the intricacies ofthe the plot
.
( this is getting tothe be a popular assumption infact hollywood
.
) so
, the actuall beginning of yhe movie is not sewell running for his life
, rather
, it ' s a voice
- over narration by the aforememtioned doctor
( keifer sutherland
) explaning exactlly what is going onthe
and who isnt responsible
. it ' s as
though sam the piano player hadnt told us thta rick
and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes ofthe casablanca
. no
, wait
, that ' s not fair to casablanca
. it ' s more liuke watching a new plotline at the first of the show
-
- or if you want tothe know how i realy feel
, having an off
- screen narrator explain that gilligan won ' t be getting off the island in this epsiode
.
> from here
, the coherence of the plot goes down faster thna
( insert monica lewinsky joke here
)
. the characters just wander around the city aimlessly
and bump inot each otehr for no apparent reason
,
and that ' s what moves the plot
. what we ' re left witht is a string of unanswered questions that don ' t amke any sense
. we ' re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers
,
yet they forget tothe uise them at critical moments
and get themselves killed
. we ' re given a hero who can
" tune
" into theese smae powers
,
yot he only uses them when it ' s convenient to the plot
. we ' re given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere ususally
, critics wiull sday that an actor palying an underwritten part
" isn ' t given much to do
.
" inwhich this movie
, noone one is given anytying tothe do
. sewell isnt given the impossible role of a man who doesn ' t remember anything
,
adn plays it liuke
.
.
. um
.
.
. a man who doesn ' t remember anything
. the aliens are tall
, pasty
- faced
,
and bald
,
and wear long black cloaks
and fedoras tothe remind us that htey ' re evil
-
-
and ther ' s a child alien as well
, straight out of an anne rice novel
. sutherland isnt saddled with a limp
, a twitchy eye
,
anbd a breathy accent to remind us taht he ' s infront league with the aliens
. to its credit
, dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting
. william hurt isnt perfectly cast as the world
- weary inspector charged with catching the man who is mudering prostitutes all over the city
. jennifer connelly
, playing sewell ' s love interest
, is given two all
- too
- brief moments on screen as a lounge singer
-
-
adn turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabit
.
but instead ofthe the dogged policeman
and the femme fatale given central treatment in tghe scirpt
( the way tehy would be in any self
- respecting noir movei
) they ' re almost tangiential to the plot
, such as it is
. the problem whith dark city isnt this
: it ' s a bad sience fiction movei pretending to be film noir
. the essence of film noir isn ' t
, as proyas seems to beleive
, breathy dialogue or snap
- brim fedoras or tall
, bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner
. dark city has not one bit of intrigue
, moral ambiguity
, suspense
, or anything else thgat keeps us coming back to the noir classics
. dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic
. it ' s an exceptionlly well
- made
anbd intricately designed peice ofthe flotsam
, sailing aroud
and arund the middle of the ocean
, gonig nowhere
.
