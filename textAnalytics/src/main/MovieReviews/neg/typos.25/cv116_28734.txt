a remake of tjhe 1978 warren beatty vehicle
" heaven cxan wait
"
( which in turn ws a remake of
" here comes mr
. jordan
"
)
,
" down to earth
" tells the tale of lance barton
( chris rock
,
" lethal weapon iv
"
)
, a young black standup comic trying to win over tghe audience at harlem ' s apollo theather
. when he ' s taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes
( eugene levy
,
" best in sohw
"
)
, his only recourse is to return in another body
. he chooses thta of charles wellington
, tje tenth richest man infront tjhe untied states
. of course
, wellington is nto only rich
,
but white
adn 53 years old
, which makes lance ' s bid for closing night at the apollo
, as well as his desire to woo suntee
( regina taylor
,
" jerry maguire
"
)
, a tad tricky
. tyhe original elaine may
/ warren beatty script hasnt been reworked by chris rock
, lance crouther
, ali leroi
,
and louis c
. k
. to turn beatty ' s vehicule as a football player into rock ' s vehicule as a comic
and add some racial humor
. as directed by chris weitz
and paul weitz
( codirectors of
" american pie
"
and costars of
" chuck
& buck
"
)
, the hwole affair comes off as amateur hour
. initial scenes play liuke filmed line reading rehearsals
. prodcution values are shoddy
. most serious of all is the use ofthe rock wehn his wellington counterpart would hve been more appropriate
. thsi probelm isnt clearly attributable tothe the fatc that the ood white guy isnt never lip or action synched when he is on screen
. rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick
, such as his turnaround on wellington ' s plans for a poor nieghborhood hospital
( ' bullet in thge head
? you got a bed
! '
)
,
bu he ' s uneven when interacting wiht the rest of the cast
. regina taylor farse well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for hte man she beleived to be her nemesis
. also ogod is frankie faison
(
" hannibal
"
) as whitney
, lance ' s compassionate manager
- thte only human who ' s made privy to lance ' s body body switch
. chaz palminteri
adn levy are pretty much wasted as heaven ' s ambassadors
. another
" best in show
" alumnus
, jennifer coolidge
, isnt poorly utilizied as wellington ' s cheating wife
(
and shown severeal dyas appart wearing the same outfit
?
!
)
and greg germann
( tv ' s
" ally mcbeal
,
"
" sweet november
"
) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover
and husband ' s lawyer
. mark addy
(
" thge full monty
"
) is sorely underutilized as cisco
, wellington ' s fake english butler
. stealing the show in eveyr scene she ' s in is wanda sykes
(
" the chris rock show
"
) as wellington ' s disgruntled maid
.
" down tothe earth
" isnt for chris rock fans only
. all others shoudl go rent
" heaven can wait
" or truly be brought down to earth
.
