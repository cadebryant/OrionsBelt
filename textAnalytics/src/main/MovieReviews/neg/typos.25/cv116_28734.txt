, tje hwole affair comes off as amateur hour
. initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals
. prodcution values are shoddy
. most sereous of all is the use of rock whn his wellington counterpart woudl have been mroe appropriate

butable to the fact that the old white guy isnt never lip or action synched whn he is on screen
. rock does get the chance to do soem fun schtick
