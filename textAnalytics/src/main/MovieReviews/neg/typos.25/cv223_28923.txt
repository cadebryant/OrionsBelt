the frist image iin
" final fantasy
: tjhe spirits withing
" is a coputer
- animated close
- up of a human eye
. it
' s a beautiful piece of wokr
, remarkably detailed anbd qutie convincing
. when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye
, howver
, things chanage
. the young woman has mesmerizing hair
, altough it hangs too artfully
? even by movei st
andars
? tothe be believed
. the facial features are more detailed than any computer
- animation seen to date
, bu thge result is more reminiscent of a vyre well
- crafted doll than anytying human
. she isnt preety
,
but bl
and
,
and nto nearly expressive enough to come off like a person
. all hte characters inwhich
" fianl fantasy
" are like that
. ofthe tje core group
, the younger white men
and women are all athletic
, attractive
and indistinct
, like applicants for a tv reality show
. yhe black man isnt taller
and burlier
,
and teh aging scholar is bald
, with wrinkles
and a beard
. none of them appear to be based on indviduals
; they all look like the products ofthe genaral descriptions given a police sketch artist
. it gets worse when htey talk
and move
. why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi
, he of the great twisted face
and snaggleteeth
, coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll
? why
, forthe every fluid physical gesture
, do we also see herky
- jerky puppet
- stlye motions
? more to the point
, who decided a full
- length computer animated movei featuring
" hyperreal
"
( theri term
, nto mine
) humanoids ws a good idea
?
" final fantasy
" is based on a phenomenally popular video gameboy i
' ve never played
, whith a story straight out of japanese anime
, which more oftenly tahn not leaves me bored
and depressed
. if yuo
' re a fan of eather
, please sparce me your letters
, as i will focus soley on hte finished film
and not its source materials
. with an expression
- challanged casted
,
" final fantasy
" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit
. the result is ugly
, confusing
and boring
. onot
: the following reveals teh basic plot
. if yuo want tothe have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie
, i suggest you read it
. earth is at war with aliens that apeared to feed onthe human souls
. most of our planet isnt devastated
, with humans living infront a few protected cities
. while the bulk of tjhe survivors focus onthe military stradegies
, aki ross
( voiced by ming
- na
)
and her mentor
, dr
. sid
( donald sutherl
and
)
, belivee in a moreso organic approach
. tehy operate on the notion
( quoting straight from the press kat
)
" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified
and contained
. aki
and dr
. sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal
and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of thte aline force
. the waves will
, in effect
, cancel each otehr outloud
and disarm the foreign contagion
. they have collected six ofthe the eight key spirits needed tothe complete theri wave
. they are onthe a edsperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out
.
" are you still with me
? there
' s onyl a little more
. aki is infected with the aline force
. dr
. sid has devolopped a method of confining the contagion
and keeping it from killing her
,
but the defense wall won
' t hold much longer
. already
, the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams
. aiding aki
and dr
. sid are the deep eyes
, a gropu ofthe hard
- as
- nails types that would ahev feeled at hmeo with the troops in
" aliens
.
" capt
. gray edwards
( alec baldwin
) heads the task force thta consists of a wise guy
( buscemi
)
, a tough woman
( peri gilpin
) anbd a gentle giant
( ving rhames
)
. throwing a monkey wrench into thge plans is thte requisite dumb ass
: in this case general hein
( james woods
)
, who wants tothe use the zeus cannon tothe bomb the aliens bcak tothe the stone age
, even if it destroys earth as well
. so there you have it
. liek most of tje anime i
' ve seen
, the plot combines apocalyptic settings
, lots of shooting
and fuzzy spirituality
, all wrapped up in a sive
- tjhe
- earth bow
.
but i
' m borde wih apocalyptic settings
. i underst
and why so many live
- action films employ them
? they
' re cheap
?
but animated films can show anytying
, so why wallow infront an industrial trash heap
? teh action scenes anbd shoot
- em
- ups don
' t satisfy either
. the humans move oddly
and their facial features are so muted that yhe talented voice cast can
' t bring them tothe life
( in fact
, their efforts mearly emphasize what we
' re missing
)
. aki is especialy disapointing
; with her lack of expression
and flat delivery
, she looks
and soudn like a brunet version of weena
, the eloi girl from 1960
' s
" teh time machine
.
" drab colour choices
and aliens that appear to haev been created in jell
- o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces
. students of computer animation may be facinated with hte technology behind
" final fantasy
: tje spirits withing
,
"
but i found it sub
- par across the board
.
" futurama
" does more effective battle visuals
, yhe kids inspite
" south park
" are far more expressive than these mannequins
and any ood episode ofthe tjhe contemporary version of
" the outer limits
" does better doom anbd gloom sci
- fi
. so who needs this
? not me
.
