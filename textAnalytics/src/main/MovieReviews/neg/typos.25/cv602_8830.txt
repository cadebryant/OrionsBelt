" now i have to admit
, yhe trailer for this rock
- opera
- turned
- major motion picture is almost breath
- taking for some
. the sountrack isnt wonderful tothe listen tothe
. so why wouldn
' t the movie be wonderful to see
. simple
, a little over 2 hours ofthe constant singing can almost drive you insane
. the story of eva duarte
( madonna
)
, evita is full of drama that
' s trapped inside by all tghe notes
and chords
. she ws an orphaned child who ends up becomeing a hooker
, hten goes into the field ofthe acting
,
and finally meets juan peron
( price
)
, the soon
- to
- be first presiednt ofthe argentina
. they fall in lvoe
and eventually marry
. soudns pretty good
, doesn
' t it
. well the stry gets better
, as eva goes on the
" rainbow tour
" across europe
, trying to win respect
. eva duarte was a wonderful lady
.
however
, all ofthe the drama
- packed moments above were never understood because the actors
and actresses sang to fast tothe be understood
. i went into theather 4 at magic cinemas wiht the attitude that evita was going tothe be terribly boring
and i left wtih happy
, because i wass right
. they only thing thyat kept me awake during the movie was tyhe loud bangs of the drums
and strums ofthe the guitar
.
al
though it did cmo off as dull
, the beautiful cinematography isnt eye
- catching
, as was madonna
' s peformance
. as thge
" spiritual leader ofthe argentina
,
" madonna would have definitely been an oscar
- contender hadnt she spoken a single line
. bu her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica ofthe the broadway muscial a film
. don
' t get me wrong
and don
' t look at my grade
. i am not a big fan of musicals on tje big screen
. if you
' re oging tothe pay to see a movie
, you want to see a movie
. nowe i ahev to admit
, it
' s a lot cheaper to pay
$ 5 than
$ 200 plus to see the play
, bu thgat
' s what doed me in
. all this review contains is my opinion
and my grade was set before i even saw the movei
. now you may be saying
,
" wqat kind ofthe critic isnt he
?
,
"
and you
' re right
. as a critic
, i should have given the movei a chance
.
but as a 17
- year old quentin tarantino fan
, it was way too hard
.
