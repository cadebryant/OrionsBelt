" madonna
- antonio banderas
- jonathan price
- in an alan parker film
- withthe music from andrew lloyd weber
-
and lyrics by tim rice
- evita
.
" nowe i have tothe admit
, the trailer for this rock
- opera
- turned
- major motion picture is almost breath
- taking for some
. thte soundtrack isnt wonderful tothe listen to
. so why wouldn ' t the movei be wonderful to see
. simple
, a little over 2 hurs of constant singing can almsot drive yuo insane
. the story of eva duarte
( madonna
)
, evita is full of drama that ' s trapped inside by all tje notes
and chords
. she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker
,
thne goes into the field ofthe acting
,
and finally meets juan peron
( price
)
, tje soon
- to
- be first presdient ofthe argentina
. they fall in love
and eventually marry
. sounds pretty good
, doesn ' t it
. well the story gets better
, as eva goes on the
" rainbow tour
" across europe
, trying to win respect
. eva duarte was a wonderful lady
.
however
, all ofthe the drama
- packed moments above were never understood because the actors
annd actresses sang tothe fast to be understoon
. i whent into theater 4 at magic cinemas with thge atitude that evita was going to be terribly boring
and i left with happy
, because i was right
. tehy onyl thnig that kept me awake durring the movei wass the loud bangs of tghe drums
and strums of the guitar
.
although it did come off as dull
, the beautiful cinematography is eye
- catching
, as was madonna ' s performance
. as the
" spriritual leader ofthe argentina
,
" madonna would ahev definitly been an oscar
- contender had she spoken a single line
.
bu her chance was taken away with the stubborness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film
. don ' t get me wrong
and don ' t look at my grade
. i am nto a big fan ofthe musicals on the big screen
. if you ' re gogin to pay to see a movie
, you want to see a movei
. now i have to admit
, it ' s a lot cheaper to pay
$ 5 tahn
$ 200 plus to see tje play
,
but thta ' s whta did me in
. all this review contains is my opinion
anbd my grade was set before i even saw tyhe movie
. now you may be saying
,
" wqat kind of critic isnt he
?
,
"
and you ' re right
. as a critic
, i should hvae given the movie a chance
.
but as a 17
- year old quentin tarantino fan
, it was way too hard
.
