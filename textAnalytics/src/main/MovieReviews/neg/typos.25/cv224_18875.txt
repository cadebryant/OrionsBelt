. critique
: wow
. i really cant
' t remember the lastest time a movie sucked onthe so many levels
! the
" comedy
" in this film is pathetic
, obvious
and dated
( oj simpson jokes galore
)
. the plot isnt uninteresting
, boring anbd bad
. the stucture of the film is annoying
, repeative anbd pretentious
. the acting is pretty bad
, especially jackie chan
, who can
' t ect to sive his life
. the cameos are lame
and seem forced
,
and the ending blows chunks
. all iin all
, this movie believes itself to be a clever
, humorus
and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood
, bu comes across as a boring
, stupid
and completely unentertaining piece of shite
. i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans
,
but this one bites the big noe
. see it if you like to watch really bad movies
, otherwise skip it
, because it will jstu have you hating eveyr star that makes an appearance in it
. luckily for us all
, this mess only lasts about 80 minutes
,
and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead
- faced detective
. by the way
, is ther any reason why tghe studio or the producer couldn
' t have cut another version of hte film by the way of all the filmed stock thta was left over
? who knows
, who cares
, this
" satire
" sucks the bag

and its stars

, the originnal directer of this film
, arthur hiller
, aslo requested his name be tooked off the credits anbd replaced by the dga
' s alan smithee moniker

' s prodcution company
, cinergi picturesk

/ writer joe eszterhas to his

. he received 9
, 200 cds annd cassettes from mostly unkown
and unsigned artists
, listened tothe all taht was sent
( at least a couple ofthe tracks from earch rocord
) adn compiled the soundtrack
