a newyorker entry in the
" revisionist history
" genre of filmmaking
, dick suggests that two not
- too
- bright teenage girls are the cause of tyhe uncovering of the nation
' s biggest presidential sc
andal
. kirsten dunst
and michelle williams star betsy
and arlene
, who hwile trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene
' s watergate hotel room
, cacidentally stumble across g
. gordon liddy
( palyed dead
- on by harry shearer
)
and the infamous break
- in
. wehn they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip
, they are ushered inot a conference room
, questioned as to what they know
,
and leave as offcial presidental dog walkers
. the girls manaze to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate sc
andal while performing their duties
,
but have no clue as to waht they are getting involved whith
. wehn they discover thyat nixon
( another dead
- onthe performance by dan hedaya
, who actually favors nixon slightly
, unlike anthony hopkins
) has beeen abusive tothe checkers
, the presedential dog
, thanks to the conversations that he always recorded
, they quit
and become disillusioned
. during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward annd bernstein
, events are set into motion that eventually lead tothe the president
' s resignation
. this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward adn bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king
- type talk show
( featuring a cameo by french stewart
) about revealing the identity of
" deep throat
"
. from there
, we are subjected to bodily fucntion humor adn just about eveyr bad
" dick
" joke one can derive from this tipe of suposed comedy
. at one point
, the girls are haveing to scream over a high school b
and playing on the steps ofthe the lincoln memorial
. the b
and manages to stop right as dunst screams
" ytou have to stop letting dick run your life
!
" much to hte horror ofthe everyone st
anding withing earshot
. several otehr variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film
. if tihs movie had been smarter i would hvae beeen less likely tothe fault it
' s juvenile bathroom humor
,
but it
' s not
. the film was apparently made for relatively younger peple because eveyr major palyer in thte watergate sc
andal is introduced
and shoved down the audeince
' s throat in the least subtle way possible
. i don
' t recall oliver stone
' s nixon haveing tothe p
ander to it
' s audiance
,
but of course that film wasn
' t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13
- 20 yearm
- ood film going audience
. the onyl redeeming thign about this movie isnt it
' s remarkable supporting cast
. i wnated to see more of ferrell adn mcculloch
' s woodward annd bernstein
. those twpo characters are the sole basis forthe my rating
. i wish they hadnt been given more screen time
,
but unforetunately
, they are onyl relegated to the final half
- hour
. their constant bickering annd fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight
, especially mcculloch
' s constatn thwarting ofthe ferrell
' s attempts tothe gather information fomr the girls
( who
, in thte course ofthe yhe narrative are revealed as deepo throat
, so named thanks tothe an ill planned trip tothe a porno theather by betsy
' s brother
)
. hte other members ofthe the cast are excellent in their portrayals ofthe their particular characters
,
but are given nothing to owrk with
. i
' d like to see the smae cast portray these characters in a scirpt more suited towords theri commedic abilties
. as forthe thte two leads
, dunst
and williams can definitely do better
. they come off as what could best be described as romy
and michele
: the early years in this particular film
, a highly dubious distinction at best
. stay through the firt half of thte end credits
though
, to see an interesting scene involving dunst
and williams suggestively sucking onthe lollipops emblazoned with the title of tje movei
. an excellant idea marred by poor execution
, dick coudl have been a gerat movie
. less of tje juvenile humer adn more ofthe tghe smarter comedy displayed by the woodward
and bernstein scenes
, could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen thru the eyes ofthe two naieve fifteen yera olds
. as it st
ands
though
, dick offers nothing
but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as
" dick anbd poopie
" jokes
.
and that
, to me
, does not make a funny movie
.
