gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change ofthe heart by teh film
' s end
and becomes a believer inwhich god instead of a skeptic
, going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes somene who cant now beated yhe devil by his faith alone
.
.
. thsi is after two hours of throwing people out windows adn shooting more peple than your average serial killer
. nobody can savve tihs bomb ffrom it
' s own stupidity annd arrogance in filmmaking
and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious
- tipe of film
. it
' s jsut a pile ofthe dreck
.
.
. an ill
- conceived exploitive project
, a pyrotechnical film
.
" end of days
" aims tothe be an apocalyptic thriller
. it features an idiotic script
, a hack director
,
and a oen
- dimesnional star who is past his prime
.
.
. whcih mkaes this film dumber than dumb
, plus it
' s not funny
, not campy
, or is it inaddition the least bit entertaining
. it
' s just dreary
and unwatchable
.
.
. a big
- budget slasher film
. arnold plays an alchoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stpo satan
( occupying gabriel byrne
' s body
and possessing a wall st
. bank account
) from destroying the world
. the film opens in vatican city
, roma 1979
-
- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso
, looking out at the night sky
and seeing a comet whiz by
, who proclaims aftter looking at his scrolls
-
- that
' s the sign forthe the
' eye of god
,
' which reveals that a child has beeen born who is being prepared to give birth tothe satan
' s baby
( the anti
- christ
) in the hour before hte new century begins
, when satan will fuck her
and open up the gates tothe hell on earth
. tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman
and save her
and thge world from doom
.
but some in tjhe pope
' s circle want tothe kill her if found
, even
though the pope insists onthe having faith annd letting her live
, as he lectures them
:
" even iin tghe world
' s darkest days
-
- doing evil doesn
' t stop evil
,
but brings onthe more evil
.
" we saw the girl being born inwhich nyc infact 1979
, which seems to be thge
' logical
' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries
. tghe chosen woman is christine york
( robin
)
. it is now a few days before the newyorker eyar celebration for 2000
and arnold
and his wise
- cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd
,
and whn he is fired upon by a renograde priest
, thomas aquinas
, arnold saves him adn through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired thge shot
. he
, nevertheless
, can speak
and tells arnold an
' end of days
' is coming as prophesized in revelations
.
but satan gets to him inwhich his hospital room
and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of
' the end of the world
' on his body
. it is nowe up to arnold tothe save the world
and find the chosen woman
. he quicklyu finds christine
and doesnt everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her
, as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues
, people jumping out of windows
, satan tkaing a piss anbd dropping a match tothe kill arnold
' s partner as the piss explodes like gasoline
, satan being fired at
.
.
. resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain adn somtimes nothing
, as if the director forgot whic way he wants tothe have it
. htere is nothing spared infact nyc fomr fire bombs
-
- includng the subway
, churches
,
and luxury buildings
. the only trouble with all these high
- budget action sequences
, was that it lacked purpose
and even entertainment value
. the story was so terrible anbd inaccurate
, thast it did not hvea an iota of value or credibility
. mercifully the movie drags tothe a final confrontation in times square
, trying unsuccessfully to build tension tothe the countdown toward the eyar 2000
. why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil
' s number
" 666
,
'
' well
!
.
.
. satan
' s numeral isnt actually
" 999
,
'
' which is upside down of
" 666
.
'
' accordingly
, yuo just put a
" 1
'
' in front ofthe it
-
-
and bingo
-
- you get
" 1999
.
'
' wiht logic like that
, this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer
' s eyes
and got away with such a febrile explanation ofthe the occult
. this film shouldnt become a classic used by film schools in how not tothe make a horror film
. i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose
.
