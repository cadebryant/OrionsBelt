gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change ofthe heart by the film ' s end
and becomes a believer in god instade of a skeptic
, going through an amazing transformation by haveing a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who cant nowe beat tyhe devil by his faith alone
.
.
. this is after two hours of throwing people out windows
and shooting more people tahn your averege serial killer
. nobody can save this bomb from it ' s pwn stupidity
and arrogance infront filmmaking
annd arrogance in believing tath this is a positive religious
- tipe of film
. it ' s just a pile of dreck
.
.
. an ill
- concieved exploitive project
, a pyrotechnical film
.
" end of days
" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller
. it features an idiotic script
, a hack directer
,
and a one
- dimensional star who is past his prime
.
.
. which makes this film dumber than dumb
, plus it ' s not funny
, not campy
, or is it in the least bit intertaining
. it ' s just dreary
and unwatchable
.
.
. a big
- budget slasher film
. arnold plays an alcholic security guard who finds his newyorker mission in life is to stop satan
( occupying gabriel byrne ' s body
and possesing a wall st
. bank account
) from destroying the world
. the film opens inaddition vatican city
, roma 1979
-
- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso
, looking out at teh night sky
annd seeing a comet whiz by
, who proclaims after looking at his scrolls
-
- that ' s the sign for the ' eye of god
, ' which reveals thyat a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan ' s baby
( the anti
- christ
) in the hour before the new century begins
, when satan will fuck her
and open uv the gates tothe hell on earth
. tomaso has soem twenty years to find this woman
and save her
anbd the world from doom
.
but some in the pope ' s circle wanna to kill her if found
, even
though the pope insists on haveing faith
and letting her live
, as he lectures them
:
" even in the world ' s darkest dyas
-
- doing evil doesn ' t stop evil
,
bu brings on more evil
.
" we saw the girl being born in nyc inaddition 1979
, which seems to be the ' logical ' place to look forthe satan according to the astrology charts of thge visionaries
. the chosen woman is christine york
( robin
)
. it is now a few days befoer tghe newyorker eyar celebration for 2000
and arnold
adn his wise
- cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired tothe guard a wall strent turd
,
anbd wehn he is fired upon by a renograde priest
, thomas aquinas
, arnold saves him
and through a ridiculous chase captures the tounge less priest who fired the shot
. he
, nevertheless
, can speak
and tells arnold an ' end of days ' isnt coming as prophesized in revelations
.
but satan gets to him in his hospital room
and nails him to tje ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of ' teh end of the world ' onthe his body
. it is nowe up to arnold tothe save the world
and find thge chosen woman
. he quickly finds christine
and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her
, as the film includes ludicrous helecopter rescues
, peple jumping out of windows
, satan taking a piss
and dropping a match tothe kill arnold ' s partner as the piss explodes like gasoline
, satan bieng fired at
.
.
. resulting infront his somtimes experiencing pain
and sometimes nothing
, as if the director forgot which way he wants tothe have it
. htere is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs
-
- including the subway
, churches
,
adn luxury buildings
. hte onyl trouble with all theese high
- budget acation sequences
, was tht it lacked purpose
and even entertainment value
. the story ws so terrable
and inaccurate
, that it doed not have an iota ofthe value or credibility
. mercifully the movei drags to a final confrontation in times sqaure
, trying unsuccessfully tothe build tension to tghe countdown towrad the year 2000
. why is the end ofthe 1999 considered to be the devil ' s number
" 666
, ' ' well
!
.
.
. satan ' s numeral isnt actually
" 999
, ' ' which is upside down of
" 666
. ' ' accordingly
, you just put a
" 1 ' ' in front of it
-
-
anbd bingo
-
- ytou get
" 1999
. ' ' whith logic liek that
, this film might even tihkn it pulled the wool over hte viewer ' s eyes
and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult
. this film should become a classic unsed by film schools in how not to make a horror film
. i highly recommend seeing it forthe that purpose
.
