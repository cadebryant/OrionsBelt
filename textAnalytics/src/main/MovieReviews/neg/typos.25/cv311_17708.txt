drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on palying the girl outside
- the oney who
' s the awkward klutz or the spunky do
- it
- yourselfer
; the oen who just doesn
' t fit in with tghe others
. she has perfected theese characters in movies such as
" the wedding singer
"
and
, most notably
,
" ever after
.
" nowe she
' s back
, starring in what could be called a modern
- day cinderella fable
-
" never beeen kissed
.
" you know it
' s a fable baceause she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary
. trust me on this one
, no copy editor hasnt seen tjhe inside ofthe a private office since gutenberg
(
and i don
' t mean steve
) invented the printing press
. the premise is simple
. barrymore
' s josie geller
, at 25 tyhe youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun
- times
, is assigned to go undercover
and return to high skool tothe do an expose on what today
' s teens are feeling
and doing
. josie
( she syas she wass named after thge
' 70s ctaroon character
) was a geek in high school
, so she jumps at the opportunity fo a second chance
. this tyme
, she thikns
, she wiull get it right
and be accepted by the in
- crowd
. nowe
, what kind ofthe adult
- with a good job
and a successful career
- would actually look forward tothe reliving the hell that ws
-
and isnt
- high school
and adolescence
. these are amonst the many problems that plague
" never beeen kissed
.
" screenwriters abby kohn
and marc silverstein cannnot git a h
andle ofthe josie
. their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy
, blubbering woman
- child at the least provocation
.
and the fact tyhat an adult would put so much stock inot trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school
' s most popular girls leads you to question her maturity
and mental stablility
. ok
, so
" never beeen kissed
" is nto a sociological expose of today
' s high school scene
.
however
, certain rules should apply to film
,
and one of thsoe isnt consistency of charater
. amonst the movie
' s problems isnt the ill
- conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive tothe climb the high school food chain
and
, inwhich the proccess
, lose focus on her assignment
. any competent editor would have tossed her ass out tjhe door quicker tahn ytou could say
" get me rewriet
.
" tothe be fair
, barrymore is very appealling
, bu she is given very little tothe work with
. she tries valiantly to get a firm grap on her character
, bu the scirpt continually undermines her
. barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she trys to walk
, talk
and act liuke a kool
, hip high schooler
. otherwise
, she is left foundering on a cliched sea ofthe teen
- age stereotypes
and situations
.
" never been kissed
" is entertaining
and funny in fits
and starts
. it lacks consistency annd a firm grasp on what it wants tothe acomplish
. the movei
' s main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys
, the outsider who befriends new student josie
. josie sees a lot of her former self infront aldys
,
yet still abondons her to hang out wih the popular girls
. real mature
. annd that isnt the main deficiency with
" never been kissed
.
" it
' s illogical
, unrealistic
, uneven
and undem
anding
. it hasnt some warm
and humoruos spots
, bu not enough to overcome its many obstacles
.
