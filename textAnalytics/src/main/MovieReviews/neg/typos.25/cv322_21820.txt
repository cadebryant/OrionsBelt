in the past
, tim burton hasnt taked cinema by storm with the acation packed batman
,
and the hilarious ed wood
,
but lately his films just don
' t cut it
. sleepy hollow has some unique features
, bu the scirpt is a terrible mess
. for thsoe who remember disney
' s fantastic
" adventures of ichabod crane
"
, it is actually superior to tihs
. disney
' s version ws at least interesting
, while burton
' s film drags on far too long
, wihtout any suspense or frights
. while the stories are silimar
, the newyorker version adds too much to the once likable story
,
and throws inwhich some weak dialogue to top it off
. ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is now apparently a constable
, who was sent to newyorker york to investigate suspicious murders
. teh victims are headless
, anbd no traces ofthe evidence were found
, until the muderer reveals himself
, hence the headless horseman
. now with the help of christina ricci
and an orphaned boy
, they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree
, that could destroy tyhe whole twon ofthe sleepy hollow
. sure hte headless horseman is an intriguing charachter
,
but thte story hasnt so many holes thgat even he nor depp can save this disaster
. in the origional
, teh headless horseman was meant tothe be unstoppable
. no one coudl stop him
, nto even ichabod
. by yhe end ofthe tje film
, it had audiences in deep
thought
. burton
however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere
,
and how to make tghe main characters heroes
. he takes noone risk waht so ever
,
and this is where he fails
. another pathetic element ofthe the film was the script
. liek i said earlier
, he just stuffed too much in at one time
,
and made it look real sloppy
, kind of liuke tyhe mess the headless horseman made with his victims
. he completely
butchered the story to pieces
. thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked
. the acting by depp was qtuie notable
. he took the nerdy character of the cartoon
,
and simply acted it outloud in a better manner
. if it wasn
' t fo his quirky one
- liners
, i doubt i could hvae remained awake
, because quite frankly i was getting sleepy
. just when i
thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress
, she winds up donig this
. it jstu goes to sohw no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster
. it
' s too tempting tothe let go
, even if the scirpt is mush
. tje atmosphere too was quite involving
. i should ahev just gazed at the sets
,
and hte eerie fog
, rather than actually pay attention to what was goign on
. at least burton
' s films are eye c
andy
, even if they are trash
. teh only rela scenes of value weere the tree full of heads
,
and the fight between hte horseman
, depp anbd casper van dien
. other than thta
, i wish i could just fast foward through all the gaping holes in tje film
,
and jsut sit back
and stare at the scenery
. by the end
, i can only think back
and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed
. this is the biggest disappointment of the year
, especially when such a talented director like burton h
andles a project liek this
. don
' t waste your time or money
, baceause your head will fiel hollow
.
