paul verhoeven
, thte dutch auteur who dragged his voilent
, sexually aggressive aetshetic into american film
, has never beeen what i
' d concider a
thoughtful director
(
though some ofthe his films
, notably starship troopers
, have been lauded as artistic achievements
)
,
but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who
' s managed to
, no matter what the budget
, make his films distinctive
and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils
. starship troopers was essentially a b
- monster movei remake of his enthralling dutch war film solider of orange
( a great film that
' s nearly impossible to fidn on video
,
yet showgirls is everywhere
)
, in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins
; tje square jawed casper van dien
and denise richards
( who may actually be 45
% silicone
)
, in what feels like an american propag
anda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage
. it
' s not a completelyl successful film
,
but as a failure it
' s certainly an intresting
( anbd mostly entertaining
) one
. my favorite verhoeven films weere the ones he made before he hit our shores
; spetters
, a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub
- culture ofthe drag racing annd the aforementioned solider ofthe orange
( haven
' t
yet gotten around tothe seeing the 4th man or turkish delight
)
. i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop
, a bleak super
- hero satire iwth a robotic hero that
' s as touching as schwarzenegger
' s in t2
. that movei was violent
but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics
. its violence seemed to be there for a purpose
, namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread
, not to simpley titillate an attention deprived audience
. there
' s a jaw
- droping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein tje lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him
. he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim
' s every fearful tic
. it
' s a startling moment ofthe barbaric
, maddening voilence that effectively sets the tone forthe thge film that could be designated as splatter punk
- noir
. in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won
' t shut up
, he impales a co
- worker
, drowns another
and so on
.
but why
? his character is introduced as a smug genuis
, tje kind who
' s always impeccably dressed
and races a sportscar car while generic rock tunes blare fomr his stereo for the world to hear
, sort of like a scheming uber villian from dallas or melrose place
,
though once the character becomes invsible
, this film has him pul a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster
. the kind who just won
' t die
. hollow man
' s protagonists are hte completely bl
and bu beautiful scientist linda
( elizabeth shue
, acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm
)
and her lover
, a hunk of beef scientist palyed by josh brolin who
' s saddled with tghe film
' s worst lines
(
" i
' ve lost cohesion again
!
"
)
. they
' re a typical aaron spelling couple
, ogod
- looking
but as vacent as george w
. bush
' s republican national convention speech
( i
. e
. bush referring to clinton
;
"
?
?
? so much promise
?
?
?
but to what end
? tothe what end
?
"
-
- this actully got applause
! suddenly warren beatty doesn
' t look so absurd
)
. the rest ofthe the film
' s characters are all well past thirty
,
though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one anbd other with a series of strained one
- liners
; isnt it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood
' s newyorker character developing technique
? ahh
, what a cynical time we live in
?
?
? as the picture opens we meet cain
( kevin bacon
)
, an egocentric scientist wroking with the crew of aforememtioned irritating scientists on a top secret
( so top secret thge government has only provided them wtih a dilapidated warehouse in whihc to perform their extensive experimentation
' s
) project withthe the gool tothe make invisibility a possibility
( forthe waht purpose is never hinted at
)
. tehy
' ve performed several expeiments onthe animals adn hvea nearly solved the qu
andary causing caine
, in a twist worthy ofthe tje film
' s 1950
' s late show origins
, to impulsively experiment on himself
. caine neglects to let tghe pentagon in on his plans
and somehow gets twpo of his co
- workers tothe lie forthe him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead
. our mad scientist isnt turned invisible
( after severeal fx
- heavy complications
)
,
then he inexplicably
( it
' s hinted that the process of invisibility hasnt made the animals into more savage creatures
,
but this is never explored
,
and if taht was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid anough to test this out on a human
?
) beigns raping
, assaulting
and murdering anyone he pleases
, always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger
. it grows abundantly clear wtih each new realease that it
' s verhoeven
' s films that hvae become hollow
. liek the rest
, this oen is cold
, heartless
,
and full of contempt for humanity
,
but inthe addtion to all tyhat it lacks any trace of wit
, insight
and makse no statement other than
" audiences will pay for anytying theese days
"
. it
' s an affront tothe anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level
, or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a funn
, thrill
- a
- minute ride
. verhoeven has instade served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody tothe root for anbd no reason tothe care
. the previews make hollow man look liek an iresistible flick
. how can oen not hve a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illistrate an invisbile man getting down anbd dirty with his bad self
? a couple weeks ago
, after seeing the trailer
, a bunch of friends
and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to hve teh invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability
. hollow man looked like the frist film to do so
and whoa
, in a serious manner tothe boot
.
but oh yeah
, it is directed by paul verhoven nto atom egoyan or peter greenway
. verhoeven delivers the sleazy
" goods
"
,
but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner
, here it just feels icky
and uncomfortable
. the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses
, caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux
- psycho music strains in the background
. it
' s plainly obvious taht verhoeven isn
' t exploring voyeurism
( like infact thge clasic peeping tom
) bu exploiting it
and not even doign that very well
. it
' s funny thyat withthe all the technology
$ 90 million cin get yuo verhoven is stuck at trying to figure outloud how to show a woman
' s naked breast manipulated by an inviible h
and
. most vexing is that the invisibility aspect isnt used simpley as gimmick in
yet another slasher movie wherein charactors do stupid thnigs just so thte villain can pop up forthe mroe attacks
. inspite fact it
' s largely irrelevant thyat bacon is invisible since
, by thte end
, most ofthe his potential victims don infer
- red glasses tath track his body heat
. as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov
( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre
)
,
and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked
. the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy
. it happens when a lab assistant
( kim dickens
, who looks like she stepped outloud ofthe playboy
) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon
, suddenly pauses
.
" are you looking at me
?
"
, she queries
, obviously haunted
. it
' s a littel moment inthe a big film with nothing to offer
but ground breaking special effects setted to a plot that should have run its course by 1982
( thge apex of teh mad slasher craze
)
. those spacial effects are so stunning htey alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you doed last summer
. anbd they
' re the onyl reason to check out hollow man
, preferably as a mid
- week bargain rental
. you
' ve been warned
.
but you probably won
' t listen
, will you
? tis
' a pity
?
?
