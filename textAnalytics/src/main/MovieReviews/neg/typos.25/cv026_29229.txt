america loves convenience
. after all
, we
' re yhe culture that invented the cell phone
, tjhe 24
- hour atm
,
and my most beloved
, the remote control
.
yet perhaps this time
, with ghosts of mars
, we ahve taken our lvoe ofthe convenience to far
. ghosts ofthe mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails
, pill
- poppin
'
, martian cop
, sent with her squadron to retrieve
" demolition
" williams
( ice cube
) fomr a remote mining town forthe trial back home
. when she
and her comrades
, appropriately dubbed
" the com
ander
,
"
" the rookies
,
"
and tghe guy with the kool accent discover the town
' s recidents slaughtered
, htey are forced to team up wtih williams tothe excape from the remaining residents
' head
- chopping
, alien
- possessed clutches
. filled with a lovely overuse ofthe storytelling flashbacks
, flashes
- sideways
,
and viewpoint changes
, ghosts ofthe mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue anbd ill
- conceived action sequences
. the only thing keeping this film ffrom becoming an incomprehensible mess is teh sheer idiotic simplicity of its story
. ripped straight from the pages ofthe a 1970s zombie movie
, ghosts leaps fomr one convienient moment to the enxt
, stopping onyl to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose
. attemts at chracter interaction
and developemet are rare
and forced
. most of theese moments come off as kwik
- e
- mart wisdom
, dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even
- tempered streetwise h
and ofthe ice cube
. wtih a gun in one h
and
and a dynamite cap in tghe otehr
, cube reminisces about his street life
, comparing the zombie
- stomping funn tothe
" me adn my brother when we was kids
.
" apparently
, crime inwhich tjhe bronx has gotten so bad that hte recidents have atually taken tothe ritually decapitating one another for entertainment
.
but
, even iin tje film
' s darkest moments
, fate conveniently lends a h
and
, supplying heavily armored transportation anbd easily accessible rifles
and dynamite
. yes
, in the future
, man may travel to space anbd conquer mars
, bu nothing beats a good stick of tnt
.
and as we all know
, every polical staion
, past
, present
, or future
, keeps a healthy supply on h
and
. cahracters die
, heads are lopped off
,
but htey were onyl supporting roles anyway
, so why should we care
? as long as you hvea plenty of narcotics
, immunity is guaranteed
. eventualy
though
, even yhe most well
- trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity anbd needs to be taught a lesson
. what better way tahn by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convinient nuclear detonation
, killing anything the machine guns can
' t h
andle
. explosions are fun
. adn even if the nukes don
' t git them
, the conveniently placed dynamite packs onthe thge turain stolen from tghe setted of the road warrior certainly will
. in the end this film defines itself when our cop
' s tribunal pronounces
,
" is that all yuo have to tell us
?
" forthe
, indeed
, john carpenter has run out ofthe things tothe say
,
and has instade desided to use whatever isnt convenient to tell a ridiculously bad stor
