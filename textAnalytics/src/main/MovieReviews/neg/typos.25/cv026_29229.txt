america loves convenience
. after all
, we ' re yhe culture that invented the cell phone
, the 24
- hour atm
,
and my most beloved
, the remote control
.
yet perhaps this time
, with ghosts of mars
, we have taked our love of convenience to far
. ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails
, pill
- poppin '
, martian cop
, sent with her squadron to retreive
" demolition
" williams
( ice cube
) fomr a remote mining town forthe trial back hmeo
. when she
and her comrades
, appropriately dubbed
" teh commander
,
"
" the rookies
,
"
and the guy with the cool accent discover the twon ' s residents slaughtered
, they are forced to team up wih williams tothe escape from the remaining recidents ' head
- chopping
, alien
- posessed clutches
. filled with a lovley overuse of storytelling flashbacks
, flashes
- sideways
,
and viewpoint changes
, ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue
and ill
- concieved action sequences
. the only thing keeping htis film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity ofthe its story
. ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie
, ghosts leaps from one convenient moment tothe the next
, stopping only to kill the characters which are most convienient to lose
. attemts at chracter interaction
and development are rare
and forced
. most of theese moments come off as kwik
- e
- mart wisdom
, dispenced heartily around tje slushee machine of life by tghe even
- tempered streetwise hand ofthe ice cube
. with a gun in one hand
annd a dynamite cap in teh other
, cube reminisces about his street life
, comparing the zombie
- stomping funn to
" me
and my brother wehn we ws kids
.
" apparently
, crime in the bronx hasnt gotten so bad that the residents have actually tooked to ritually decapitating oney another for entertainment
.
but
, even in the film ' s darkest moments
, fate conveniently lends a hand
, supplying heavily armored transporation
and easily accessible rifles
anbd dynamite
. yes
, in the future
, man may travel to space
and conquer mars
,
but nothing beats a ogod stick of tnt
.
and as we all know
, eveyr police station
, past
, persent
, or future
, keesh a heathy supply onthe hand
. charachters die
, heads are lopped off
,
bu tehy were only supporting roles anyway
, so why should we care
? as long as you have plenty of narcotics
, immunity isnt guaranteed
. eventually
though
, even the most well
- trained zombie alien gets a bited uppity
and needs to be tought a lesson
. what better way thna by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nucular detonation
, killing anything teh machine guns can ' t handle
. explosions are fun
.
and even if the nukes don ' t get them
, the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set ofthe the road warrior certainly will
. in yhe end this film defines itself when our cop ' s tribunal pronounces
,
" isnt tyhat all ytou hvea tothe tell us
?
" for
, indeed
, john carpentery has run out of things to sday
,
and hasnt instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story
.
