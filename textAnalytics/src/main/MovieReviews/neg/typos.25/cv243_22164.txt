i read the new yorker magazine annd i enjoy some of their really in
- depth articles about some incident
. htey will tkae soem insident like the investigation of a misteryous plane crash
and tell ytou what happened in detail
. it becomes a rela education in what agencies get involved
and how theories are suggested
,
and what kind ofthe pressure the investigators are under
,
and just baout any otehr aspect you can think of
. frequentily i git the feeling thyat the article sounded exicting
, bu i am being told inthe more detail than i really wnated tothe know
. often i git to the middle of a story annd say
, ok
, it sounded good
but i now have invested mroe tiome than i am willing to spend on this subject
. film is a different medium
. it is a visual medium
. that slows down thte telling of stories much more than people realize
. i frequentily am surprised to find out how short a film script is annd how much of the pages are empty space
. thge magazine article
and the film script are two very different media
. the insider is a film adaptions of the vanity fair articel
" the man who knew too much
" by marie brenner
. it is too much an adaptation of a magasine artical slowed tothe the pace of a film
. it really verges on being tedious at least at times
. for yersa the seven big companies knew tyhat they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side
- effects
. bu they pretended for tjhe public that it was unproven
and they did nto relaly believe it
. the business ws incredibly profitable
and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch
and discredit any political movements against big tobacco
. the tide turned when a fromer vice
- president of noe of the companies was conviced by yhe cbs 60 mintues news team to tell the public how much tjhe tobbaco companies really knew baout the health effects ofthe smoking
. the resulting presure tothe stpo the sotry created a small civil war at cbs
. who were the major people involved
, what were theri motives
, how was hte story almost killed
, how doed it get aired anyway
? thyat is the story covered iin surprising detail by the insider
. tihs all could have been enthralling
, bu it isnt nto teh sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well
.
and in the end
, he failed
. tothe amke a long sotry short
, yhe film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short
. thte film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist
. we get a taste for their personal stlye
and how htey git the opper h
and
. they go fomr being oen newsman blindfolded at the h
ands of the terrorists tothe the actual interview withthe mike wallace
( played by christopher plummer
)
. ther the news team under producer lowell bergman
( al pacino
) are ordering around the terrorists annd getting awya with it
. this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story
,
but later wehn the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists
, we hvae a wry irony on who really hasnt clout inspite tyhe world
. terrorists cxan grab the headlines
, bu the tabacco companies have the real positon of power
. incongruously intercut with tyhe iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wig
and
( russell crowe
) dejectedly returning from wrok to his home
. we discover that he has been fired
and his carreer brought tothe a complete halt unexpectedly
. he had been a very profitably rewarded vice
- president in charge or research
and development at brown
and williams tobacco
; nowe he was unemployed
and needed money tothe support his family
. rather tahn support him his wife liane
( diane venora
) dem
ands ofthe him what are they supposed to do for income
. meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying tothe dont a stoy onthe fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data tehy do not underst
and
. they offer wig
and
$ 12
, 000 just tothe interpret the data
. wig
and
' s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knwos about tobacco dealings
,
but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms
. he is willing tothe read some doccuments from another tobacco company
and interpet them for bergman
. in spite of the secrecy
, wig
and
' s former employers seem immediately to nkwo wig
and is tlaking to 60 minutes annd he is warned off by fromer boss thomas s
andefur played michael gambon in an all too breif
but deliciously sinister role
.
and so the game begins
. wig
and is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considerd continued tothe be loyalty to his aggreement adn his former employer
. meanwhile someone isnt playing very rough with wig
and adn his familiy
. tyhe film examines wig
and
and the pressures placed on his familiy as tehy are caught between two powerful giants
. wig
and has always wanted to make tobacco safer
and has natural sympathies wih getting thge story out
. he
and his family are assaulted psychologically
and financially by the giant tobacco inudstry that had never lost a legal fight
. al pacino is given top billing
but the wig
and familiy is the core of the insider
. the story isnt told slowly adn inspite jstu a bit too much meticulous detail
. the film is 157 minutes annd is an extremely dem
anding film for the audience
. the musical score by pieter bourke
, lisa gerrard
,
and graeme revell is one ofthe tjhe worst in recent memmory
. it puts ominous chords under some scenes
and using voice in ways tath become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling
. also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace
. plummer
and wallace are such different types
and wallace is too well
- known for even so good an actor as plummer tothe play him convincingly
. thsi film might have beeen a really engaging experience under another directer
' s controll
. michael mann was tjhe wrong person to helm this film
and the insider lacks intensity because of his style
. i rate it a 4 onthe the 0 tothe 10 scale adn a 0 onthe the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
