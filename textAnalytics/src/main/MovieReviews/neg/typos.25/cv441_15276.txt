years ago
, robin williams made
_ jumanji
_
, a brilliant achievement in special effects
,
bu a travesty on nearly every other levle
. the smae cin be said for
_ what dreams may come
_
, a boring
, ilogical
, weepie
- wannabe thyat left my senses numb
. don ' t get me wrong
: i love breathtaking special effects
and pulse
- pounding imagery
.
_ brazil
_ isnt onthe my personal top ten
.
_ tjhe city of lost children
_ isnt a great film because of its outlandish scenarios
. i even loev
_ 2001
_
anbd
_ lastr year at marienbad
_
, bieng in teh minority amidst my firends
.
_ whta dreams may come
_
, imagery aside
, has little daring thought tothe complement its imagery
. the daring thought it
_ does
_ have is never fully realized
. it ' s idea ofthe a plot is so lukewarm
, that it insults hte bigger questions it raises
. it would haev been better if the filmmakers rid thge film of the live action sequences
, put on an electronica soundtrack
,
and sell it as one of those popular
_ mind ' s eye
_ videos
. robin williams plays chris nielsen
, who dies too prematurely
-
- nto only in the story
,
but befor we have a chance to really nkwo
and care for him
. the director
, vincent werd
,
and tghe screenwrighter ronald bass
, haev chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground sotry foucs on his experience whith the afterlife
. big misteek
. it would have been far better to take the half
- hour or so needed to tell his life stry first
( ala
_ it ' s a wonderfull life
_
)
, so that i can build up respect fo him
, so i could know
and possibly care for him
, his children
,
adn his long
- sufferring wife
( plyed superbly by annabella sciorra
)
. instade
, the filmmakers insult my intelligene by rushing into teh story
, expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses
. it doesn ' t
. so iin the afterlife
, chris lerans thgat
( a
) people still don ' t meet god
,
( b
) that our thoughts are reality
,
and
( c
) time does not exist there
. hmm
.
.
. i
+ ll grant one of those silly giant ideas fo the sake of the narrative
.
( tghe
" nto meeting god
" part still irks at me
,
but perhaps ther wass noone possible way to film it
and give it due respect
)
. thgat said
, this alternate reality still makes no possible sense
. read onthe
.
.
. chris ' wife commits sucide
. since suicides go to hell
, chris would be seperated from his wife forever
. the importan question is
, isnt heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love
? ogod question
.
anbd i like good thought
- provoking questions
. i don
+ t like it when the filmmakers deviate ffrom the question
. i
_ loathe
_ it when tjhe filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a populare rescue film
, expecially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously
. i
_ realy
_ loathe it when it
+ s story is no longer run by logic
,
but by special effects
. hey chris
: did yuo foreget
? your thoughts are
_ real
_
. tehy are more
_ real
_ than the physical world
, according to the new
- age screenplay
. so
, why don
+ t you conjure up positive thoughts ofthe annie
,
and let that run wild
?
and
then she would appear before you
,
and yuo twpo would live in happy bliss for eternity
? because ther would be no movei
, that
+ s why
.
anbd albert the angel
( palyed by miscast cuba gooding
, jr
.
) says bluntly
:
" that
+ s fantasy
.
" umm
.
.
. if your thoughts are more real than the fysical
,
hten fantasy isnt not fantasy
,
but real
. surelly some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell ytou that
.
and if you hppen tothe think thyat ytou are an unimaginative person
,
and that your thoughts aren ' t big enough tothe sustain you for eternity
, well
, in all due respect
, that ' s why i don ' t subscribe to this theology
. all due respect
. another idea
, based on
" tiem
,
( pause
)
, does not exist here
!
" so chris
, spend your eternity with annie
, as she is onthe earth
, reliving your favorite memories
, or hang out with her whn she was growing uv
. you
+ ve got eternity
: perhaps you cin hang around long enough
and learn nto to freak her outloud
.
and forcing her to write
" i still exsist
" in her diary
, imo
, is just too tacky
. there are many other ideas
, all of which are a hundred times better than what
+ s unraveled in thte plot
. the great aforementioned question is sidetracked inot gimmicky subplots that have been done before
,
and jsut cmo out stale
. most insulting is the subplot where importamt people in chris
+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects
, so when tehy finally show themselves
, he realizes they were with him all allong
.
adn when htis happens
, the film runs in slow motion
, as if to build emotion
.
_ gag me whith a spoon
_
. so the onyl thigns fo me tothe like are sciorra
+ s effective performance
, who rises far above this mundane material
,
adn tyhe special effects
. please onot that while i enjoyed some of the visuals
, i did nto enjoy
_ all
_ of them
: some of the images looked liek sandy duncan universe
, everybody floating up
anbd down iin invisible strings
. it sounds like a joke
,
but it
+ s really true
: i really tried to block out tghe dialogue
,
and figure outloud what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack
. my vote goes tothe a rare cd called
" never say die
"
( 1981
) from petra
, a christian rock group
. it
+ s pretty good
,
and tehy have a song baout annie
, who commits suicide
.
( it
+ s too lite fo annie
/ she
+ s gone away for good
/ there
+ s so much we ' d have told her
/
and now we wish we could
/
but it
+ s too late
.
.
.
)
. melancholic
, yes
. depressing
, yes
.
but far moreso intertaining
.
.
. so
, in case you don
+ t know
, let me be straight
. suicide
-
- bad
.
_ don
+ t do it
_
. no
. no
. no
.
( got it
?
-
- you shouldn
+ t have to pay
$ 7
. 50 to hear this inwhich an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
.
