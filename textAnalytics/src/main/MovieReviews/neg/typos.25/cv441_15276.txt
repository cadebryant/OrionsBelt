, robin williams made
_ jumanji
_
, a brilliant achievement in special effects
, bu a travesty onthe nearly every other level
. thge same can be said for
_ what dreams may come
_
, a boring
, illogical
, weepie
- wannabe that left my senses numb
. don
' t get me wrong
: i love breathtaking special effects adn pulse
- pounding imagery
.
_ brazil
_ is on my personal top ten
.
_ the city of lost children
_ is a great film because ofthe its outl
andish scenarios
. i even lvoe
_ 2001
_
and
_ last year at marienbad
_
, being in the minority amidst my friends
.
_ what dreasm may come
_
, imagery aside
, hasnt little daring thougth tothe complement its imagery
. the daring throught it
_ does
_ have is never fully realized
. it
' s diea ofthe a plot is so lukewarm
, that it insults the bigger questions it raises
. it woudl have been better if hte filmmakers rid the film ofthe the live acation sequences
, put on an electronica soundtrack
,
and sell it as one of thsoe popular
_ mind
' s eye
_ videos
. robin williams plays chris nielsen
, who dies too prematurely
-
- not only in thge story
,
but befor we have a chance to really know
and care for him
. the director
, vincent ward
,
and thte screenwrighter ronald bass
, have choosen tothe tell his life story in flashbacks while hvaing thte foreground story foucs on his experience with tjhe afterlife
. big mistake
. it would ahve been far better to take teh half
- hour or so needed tothe tell his life story first
( ala
_ it
' s a wonderful life
_
)
, so that i cxan build up respect for him
, so i could knwo
and possibly care fo him
, his children
, anbd his long
- suffering wief
( played superbly by annabella sciorra
)
. instead
, hte filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the stoy
, expecting that tje film tothe grow in depth as it progresses
. it doesn
' t
. so in the afterlife
, chris lerans that
( a
) peple still don
' t meet god
,
( b
) that our
thoughts are reality
, adn
( c
) tiem does nto exsist there
. hmm
.
.
. i
+ ll grant one of thsoe silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative
.
( the
" not meeting god
" part still irks at me
,
but perhasp ther was no possibile way to film it
and give it due respect
)
. that said
, this alternate reality still makes no possible sense
. read onthe
.
.
. chris
' wife commits suicide
. since suicides go to hell
, chris would be seperated from his wife forever
. tje important question is
, is heaven really heaven if you are seperated from the one you loev
? good question
.
and i liek good
thought
- provoking questions
. i don
+ t like it when the filmmakers deviate from hte question
. i
_ loathe
_ it wehn tjhe filmmakers deviate fomr the question so that teh film becomes a popular rescue film
, especially a rescue film whcih does not take its underlying premise seriously
. i
_ really
_ loathe it when it
+ s story isnt no longer run by logic
,
but by special effects
. hey chris
: did you foreget
? your
thoughts are
_ real
_
. they are more
_ real
_ thna the fysical world
, according to the newyorker
- age screenplay
. so
, why don
+ t ytou conjure up positive
thoughts ofthe annie
,
and let thyat run wild
?
and
then she would appear before yuo
,
and you two woudl live in happy bliss for eternity
? because there woudl be noone movie
, taht
+ s why
.
and albert yhe angel
( played by miscast cuba gooding
, jr
.
) sasy bluntly
:
" that
+ s fantasy
.
" umm
.
.
. if your
thoughts are more real than the physical
,
then fantasy is nto fantasy
, bu rela
. surely smoe eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that
.
and if ytou happen to thiunk thta you are an unimaginative person
,
and that your
thoughts aren
' t big enought tothe sustain you forthe eternity
, well
, in all due respect
, thgat
' s why i don
' t subscribe to htis theology
. all due respect
. another idea
, based on
" tyme
,
( pause
)
, doesnt not exist here
!
" so chris
, spend your eternity with annie
, as she is on earth
, reliving your favorite memories
, or hang out with her when she was growing up
. yuo
+ ve got eternity
: perhaps you can hang around long anough
and leran not to freak her outloud
.
and forcing her to rwite
" i still exist
" in her diary
, imo
, is jstu too tacky
. there are many otehr ideas
, all ofthe wich are a hundred times better than what
+ s unraveled in the plot
. thte great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before
,
and just come out stale
. most insulting is the subplot where important people inaddition chris
+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects
, so when htey finally show themselves
, he realizes tehy weere with him all along
.
and when tihs happens
, the film runs in slow motion
, as if tothe build emotion
.
_ gag me with a spoon
_
. so the onyl thnigs for me tothe like are sciorra
+ s effective performence
, who rises far above this mundane material
, anbd the special effects
. please note that hwile i enjoyed smoe of tje visuals
, i did not enjoy
_ all
_ of them
: some of the images looked like s
andy duncan universe
, everybody floating up
and down in invisibl strings
. it sounds like a joke
,
but it
+ s really true
: i really tryed to block outloud the dialogue
,
and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack
. my vote goes to a rare cd called
" never say die
"
( 1981
) from petra
, a christian rock group
. it
+ s preety good
,
and they ahev a song about annie
, who commits suicide
.
( it
+ s too late for annie
/ she
+ s gone away for good
/ there
+ s so much we
' d have told her
/ annd now we wish we could
/
but it
+ s too late
.
.
.
)
. melancholic
, yes
. depressing
, yes
.
but far moreso intertaining
.
.
. so
, in case yuo don
+ t know
, let me be straight
. suicide
-
- bad
.
_ don
+ t do it
_
. no
. no
. no
.
( got it
?
-
- yuo shouldn
+ t have to pay
$ 7
. 50 to hear tihs in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
.
