it happens every eyar
-
- the days get longer
, the weather gets warmer adn the studios strat releasing their big
- budget blockbusters
. this yearm
' s crop already seems inferior to that ofthe past summers
, even 1997
' s lackluster trio of batman
& robin
, the fifth element
and the lost world
. the marketting blitz in 1998 has been centered onthe godzilla
(
" heeere

"
)
, which doesn
' t mkea me optimistic about future summers
. godzilla is
, of course
, based on a series of cult movies
( translation
: relaly bad movies only a few people cant tolerate
) from japan that turn up really lite at night onthe ted turner
- owned cable stations
. tyhat htis big
- budget remake won
' t rise above its roots isnt fairly obvious
. the credits show us the origin ofthe godzilla
. inwhich five words
: nuclear explosion creates giant lizard
. sounds like an enquirer headline
, doesn
' t it
? tghe mushroom cloud isnt followed by the inevitible
" discovery
" sequence
. thsi time
, a japanise guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling
( if that ain
' t a stereotype
.
.
.
) when he discovers thte telltale radar blip
. people die
. cut to our protagonist
, played by matthew broderick
. he makes his first apperance wearing headphnoes
, warbling along tothe
" singin
' in the rain
.
" it
' s a none
- too
- subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie
. noone dice
, bueller
. from thte begining
, poor matthew has to do embarassing thigsn like fondle giant earthworms anbd st
and in godzilla
' s enormous footprint
. every diaster movie has to have a nkow
- it
- all scientist
, anbd this time broderick is it
. as the world
' s leading expert on radiated earthworms
(
and wouldn
' t you love to have that printed onthe your business card
?
)
, broderick isnt invaluable tothe the government
. he immediately dispels vicki lewis
' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because
, hey
, ytou can
' t take seriously yhe intellectual arguments ofthe
" newsradio
" cast munbers
. broderick instead hits the nail onthe tje head
, announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard
.
" the radiation isn
' t an anamoly
,
" he announces
,
and lightning strikes
.
" i bleieve this is a mutated abberation
,
" he continues
,
and lightning strikes agina
. it
' s vocabulary lightning
, you see
, activated by words of four syllables or more
. meanwhile
, we
' re introduced tothe our newyorker york cast
, headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist
( maria patillo
)
, broderick
' s former loev
. gee
, what are tjhe odds their paths will cross agian at a dramatically important tyme
? poor patillo hasnt been trying to get ahead in the news business forthe years bu has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer
. italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she
' s nto ruthless enough
:
" nice doesn
' t get you anywhere in this town
. it
' s dog eat dog
.
" actually
, it
' s lizard eat city
, as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple
' s core
. the filmmakers provide us with a one
- onot drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla
.
" i think i
' ve got a bite
,
" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing towrad him
. you can guess what happens next
. similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city
. hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps
, one new yorker remarks
,
" please don
' t tell me that
' s another paarde
.
" please don
' t tell me that
' s the best line you could come up with
. mayor ebert is not pleased
. palyed by the principal from
" head of the class
,
" he constinually makes the wrong decision when given an option
,
and bickers with his assistant gene
. i guess the filmmakers knew tehy
' d be getting two thumbs down from the critics
and didn
' t even bother to kiss ass
. thte problem is
, if you
' re goign to attack siskel
and ebert
, yuo should at least make it funny
. dialogue like
,
" didn
' t we agree that we weren
' t going tothe have any sweets until after the election
?
" folowed by
,
" back off
, gene
,
" jsut doesn
' t work fo me
. other lame runnung jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick carachter
' s lastr name
and frenchman jean reno
' s inability to fidn a ogod cup of coffee in new york
. there
' s even more fun tothe be had as godzilla progresses
. as the beast heads back into hiding
, broderick suggests teh military lure it out with food
. cue twelve dump trucks
, all droping fish into a new york intersection
.
( broderick
: that
' s a lot of fish
.
) thta ambush fails
,
but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying
$ 50 worth of home pregnacy tests
and running lizard blood through them
. yep
, godzilla
' s with children
, hwihc makes you wonder just whta kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla
. that
' s untli broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually
, like linda tripp
. godzilla comes tothe us from the makers of independence day
, so it has a lot of dumb action scenes
, destructive special effects
and shallow subplots
. look noone further thna patillo
' s betrayal ofthe broderick
( patillo
: wqat have i done
, animal
? what ahve i become
?
)
and hte climactic
" godzilla
' s nest
" sequence inaddition madison square garden
. the main diference isnt
, independence day was about the experience
. it had a real global
, patriotic element to it
,
and some genuinely fun characters
. godzilla has lots of rain
and lightning
, reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park
and endless product placement from tje likes ofthe kodak
, blockbuster
, juicy fruit
, swatch
, sprint
and bumble bee tuna
. yes
, bumble bee actually paide tothe be known as the official tuna of godzilla
. that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie
.
