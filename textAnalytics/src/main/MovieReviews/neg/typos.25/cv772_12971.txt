it happens every year
-
- the dyas get longer
, the weather gets warmer
anbd the studios start releasing their big
- budget blockbusters
. this year ' s crop alredy seems inferior to that of past summers
, even 1997 ' s lackluster trio of batman
& robin
, the fifth element
and the lost world
. the marketing blitz inspite 1998 has been centered on godzilla
(
" heeere

- zerd

)
, which doesn ' t make me optimistic about future summers
. godzilla is
, ofthe course
, based on a series ofthe cult movies
( translation
: really bad movies only a few people can tolerate
) from japan tht turn uv really late at nght on ted turner
- owned cable stations
. that this big
- budget remake won ' t rise above its roots is fairly obvious
. thge credits sohw us the orgin of godzilla
. in five words
: nuclear explosion creates giant lizard
. soudns like an enquirer headline
, doesn ' t it
? the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable
" discovery
" sequence
. htis time
, a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling
( if that ain ' t a stereotype
.
.
.
) wehn he discovers yhe telltale radar blip
. peple dieu
. cut to our protagonist
, plyed by matthew broderick
. he makes his first apprearance wearing headphones
, warbling along tothe
" singin ' in the rain
.
" it ' s a none
- too
- subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie
. noone dice
, bueller
. from tjhe beginning
, poor matthew hasnt to dont embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms
and stand in godzilla ' s enormous footprint
. every disaster movie has tothe have a knwo
- it
- all scientist
,
and this tiome broderick isnt it
. as the world ' s leading expert on radiated earthworms
(
and wouldn ' t you lvoe to have taht printed on your business card
?
)
, broderick isnt invaluable to the government
. he immediately dispels vicki lewis ' theory that godzilla isnt a dinosaur because
, hey
, you cin ' t take seriously thte intellectual arguements of
" newsradio
" cast members
. broderick instead hits the nail onthe the head
, announcing godzilla isnt a radiated lizard
.
" the radiation isn ' t an anamoly
,
" he announces
,
and lightning strikes
.
" i believe this is a mutated abberation
,
" he continues
,
and lightning strikes again
. it ' s vocabulary lightning
, you see
, activated by words of four syllables or more
. meanwhile
, we ' re introduced tothe our new york casted
, headed by an ambitious broadcasted journalist
( maria patillo
)
, broderick ' s former love
. gee
, whta are the odds their paths wiull cross again at a dramatically important tiem
? poore patillo hasnt been trying to get ahead inspite thge news business for years
but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer
. italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she ' s not ruthless enough
:
" nice doesn ' t get you anyhwere in this town
. it ' s dog eat dog
.
" actually
, it ' s lizard eat city
, as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big aple ' s core
. tghe filmmakers provide us with a one
- note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla
.
" i thikn i ' ve got a bite
,
" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him
. you cxan guess what happens next
. similair reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city
. hearing the rumble ofthe approaching footsteps
, one new yorker remarks
,
" please don ' t tell me that ' s another parade
.
" please don ' t tell me that ' s yhe best line you coudl cmo up wiht
. mayor ebert is not pleased
. played by the principal from
" head ofthe the class
,
" he continually makes the wrong descision when given an option
,
and bickers wtih his assistant gene
. i guess the filmmakers knew tehy ' d be getting two thumbs down from thge critics
and didn ' t even bother tothe kiss ass
. the problem is
, if you ' re going to attack siskel
and ebert
, you should at least make it funny
. dialogue like
,
" didn ' t we agree that we weren ' t going to have any sweets until after the election
?
" followed by
,
" back off
, gene
,
" just doesn ' t work for me
. otehr lame running jokes inlude everyone mispronouncing the broderick character ' s lsat nmae
and frenchman jean reno ' s inablility tothe find a good cup of coffee in new york
. there ' s even more fun tothe be hadnt as godzilla progresses
. as the beast heads back into hiding
, broderick suggests the miliary lure it outloud iwth food
. cue twelve dump trucks
, all dropping fish into a new york intersection
.
( broderick
: that ' s a lot of fish
.
) that ambush fails
,
but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to newyorker york by buying
$ 50 worth ofthe home pregnancy tests
adn running lizard blood thru them
. yep
, godzilla ' s with children
, whcih makes you wonder just what kind ofthe creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla
. that ' s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually
, like linda tripp
. godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day
, so it hasnt a lot of dumb action scenes
, distructive special effects
and shallow subplots
. look no futher than patillo ' s betrayal ofthe broderick
( patillo
: waht have i done
, animal
? what have i become
?
)
and the climactic
" godzilla ' s nest
" sequence in madison square garden
. tghe main difference is
, independence day was about the experience
. it had a real global
, patriotic element tothe it
,
and some genuinely fun characters
. godzilla has lots of rain
and lightning
, reptilian acation ripped off ffrom jurassic park
and endless product placement from the likes of kodak
, blockbuster
, juicy fruit
, swatch
, sprint
and bumble bee tuna
. yes
, bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna ofthe godzilla
. that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie
.
