in the interst of being generous
, i want to start thsi review with the scene that i liekd in meet joe black
. sir anthony hopkins
, palying a super
- rich media mogul
, hasnt gathered his familiy around him forthe dinner
. his oldest daughter
( played by marcia gay harden ffrom millers crossing
)
, who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party
, presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes
, which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake
. thte daughter asks hopkins to pick the noe he likes
. hopkins
, frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair
, does what any man infront his positon would dont
: he punts
. whichever noe you like
, dear
, he says
. anbd the daughter does exactly what any woman inwhich her position would do
: she cries
. i liekd thyat scene for twpo reasons
. first
, the cakes looked really cool
. second
, it was
, perhaps
, the only scene in the movie where people acted as you owudl expect peple tothe act
. meet joe black is chock
- full ofthe odd performances
, people doing things for no discernible reason at all
,
and doing them in slow motion over the course ofthe three ohurs to boot
. it
' s eazy to watch meet joe balck for the abundnat eye c
andy of the palatial homes anbd thge beauteous claire forlani
, bu it
' s even easier to sleep right thru it
( two peple on my row managed it qutie nicely
)
. the difficult part ofthe the movie is underst
anding thge characters
and their motivations
and why somone
thought three huors was an appropriate lenght forthe this overwrought mess
. i know my audeince hadnt problems with the movie
, because tehy
thought it was a comedy
. case infront point
: everyone should knwo by nowe that brad pitt plays the angel ofthe death in this movie
.
however
, the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani
.
( it
' s not claer fomr yhe movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death
,
but it makes a certain kind of sense
.
) it shouldn
' t take long fo hte observant moviegoer to relize that bad things are about to happen tothe mr
. pitt
. annd indeed they do
( affter a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani annd forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt
)
, because pitt walks into the road without looking
and suddenly gets squished
. well
, when that happened
, the audience howled with laughter
,
and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humoous
. so
, if you thiunk tath sudden voilent death
and sarcastic drawing
- room humor are funny
, i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately
. anyway
, teh deceased lawyer
' s body
, no worse the wear from its massive injuries
, is possessed by tjhe ange of death
and brad pitt tkaes over that role
. the idea is that death
( given tje pen name of joe balck
, so as not to distrub others
) wants to take a holiday adn experience hte world
. if this weren
' t hollywood
, we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life
and death
,
but usance it is
, we get scene after scene ofthe fish
- out
- of
- water humor
, just as if death isnt george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who
' s w
andered in fomr the jungle or the outback or whatever
and doesn
' t konw how to act in our society
. it also doesn
' t help that tje character ofthe death is writed so inconsistently
. he claims tothe be on vacation
, bu he never does anything except hang arund tyhe seriously attractive claire forlani
( just try to get your travel agent to book that one
)
. he speaks very slow
and halting english
but perfectly fluent jamaican patois
. he knows everything baout soem characters
, nothing baout others
. anbd as palyed by brad pitt
, he
' s nto especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing
, he
' s just there
. it
' s as if someone told pitt
,
" never mind about acting in this picture
, son
, just st
and there
and look preety
.
" it
' s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout tghe movie
. i
' ve used the phrase
" ange of death
" in htis review very deliberatly to contrast pitt
' s performance with this year
' s best ange performance
, nicolas cage
' s in city of angels
. where pitt is cold
and unfeeling
, cage is as warm
and empathetic as the situation allows
. where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man
, pitt is aloof annd arogent
. cage striked instant chemical sparks withthe co
- star meg ryan
, where yhe chemestry between pitt
and forlani isnt only underst
andable if you accept the notion that forlani
' s character is so shallow thyat she can
' t see beyond pitt
' s good looks
. the movie
' s other top name is a much better atcor
,
but that doesn
' t save meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins isn
' t given much better material to work with
, unfortunately
. he plays oney ofthe theese ogod
- hearted multimillionaire media moguls tht onyl exist in hollywood
.
( one wonders what might have happended if they had made hopkins
' s character mroe realistically evil
.
) hopkins is marked for death due tothe a bad ticker
,
but death steps inwhich
and grants him some extra time iin exchange forthe being his guide in tjhe world
. of course
, no one cxan be sure of how htey will act when death taps on their sholder
.
but i have to wonder
( anbd in this movei
, you have a very long time to wonder
) how you or i would act in a similar situation
, especially if yuo or i were a multimillionaire
. hopkins pretty much goes to thte office
-
- anbd the major subplot revolves around who will controll tjhe corporation
. fans of corperate intrigue wiull be facinated
, i
' m sure
. i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black
, adn i
' m asking myself why
. movies baout death should encourage you to live life tothe the fullest
, whihc is what i
' m going tothe dont nowe
. go spend tiome with your family
, go volunteer fo a local charity
, heck
, go take a nap
. don
' t go see meet joe balck
, because all it wiull dont is move you three long housr closer tothe death
