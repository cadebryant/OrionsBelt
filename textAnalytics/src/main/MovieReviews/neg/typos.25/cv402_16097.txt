inwhich hte interst ofthe being generous
, i want to strat this review with thge scene thyat i liekd in meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins
, playing a super
- rich media mogul
, has gathered his family around him for dinner
. his oldest daughter
( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing
)
, who has beeen obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party
, presents him with three superbly decorated littel cakes
, which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake
. thge daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes
. hopkins
, frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair
, doens what any man in his position would dont
: he punts
. whichever one you like
, dear
, he says
.
and the daughter does exactlly what any woman inaddition her posistion would do
: she cries
. i liekd that scene for two reasons
. frist
, the cakes looked raelly cool
. second
, it wass
, perhaps
, the only scene in the movei where people acted as you would expect peple to act
. meet joe black is chock
- full of odd performances
, peple doing things forthe noone discernible reason at all
,
annd doing them in slow motion over the course of threee hours to boot
. it ' s easy to watch meet joe black for yhe abundant eye candy ofthe the palatial homes
anbd the beauteous claire forlani
,
but it ' s even easier to sleep right through it
( twpo people onthe my row managed it quite nicely
)
. the difficult part of the movie isnt understanding tjhe cahracters
and their motivations
and why someone thought three hours was an appropiate length for this overwrought mess
. i nkow my audience hadnt problems withthe yhe movie
, because htey thought it wass a comedy
. case in point
: everyone shoudl know by now that brad pitt plays tje angel of death iin this movei
.
however
, the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani
.
( it ' s not clear from tyhe movei whether yuo need a law degree to become the angel of death
,
bu it makes a certain kind of sence
.
) it shouldn ' t tkae long for the observant moviegoer to realize tht bad things are about to hapen to mr
. pitt
.
and indeed they dont
( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at thge retreating forlani
and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt
)
, because pitt walks into the road without looking
and suddenly gets squished
. well
, wehn that happened
, the audeince howled with laughter
,
and continued to laugh at eveyr comment that ws remotely humorous
. so
, if yuo htikn that sudden violent death
and sarcastic drawing
- room humor are funny
, i encourage ytou to go see meet joe black immediately
. anyway
, the deceased lawyer ' s body
, no worse the wear from its massive injuries
, is posessed by the ange of death
and brad pitt takes over that role
. the idea is that death
( given the pen name of joe black
, so as not to disturb others
) wants to take a holiday
annd experience the world
. if tihs weren ' t hollywood
, we might git an interesting metaphysical dicussion of life
and death
,
but since it is
, we get scene after scene of fish
- outloud
- of
- water humor
, just as if death isnt george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poore schmuck who ' s wandered infront from the jungle or teh outback or whatever
and doesn ' t know how to act inwhich our society
. it also doesn ' t help that the carachter ofthe death is written so inconsistently
. he claims to be on vacation
,
but he never does anytying except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani
( just try to git your travel agent to book that one
)
. he speaks very slow
adn halting english
but perfectly fluent jamaican patois
. he knows everything baout smoe characters
, nothing about others
.
anbd as plyed by brad pitt
, he ' s nto especialy menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing
, he ' s just there
. it ' s as if someone told pitt
,
" never mind about acting in this picture
, son
, just stand there
and look preety
.
" it ' s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie
. i ' ve used the phrase
" ange of death
" in this review very deliberately tothe contrast pitt ' s performance with this year ' s best angal performance
, nicolas cage ' s inwhich city of angels
. where pitt is cold
annd unfeeling
, cage is as warm
and empathetic as the situation allows
. where cage is genuinely curious baout the nature of man
, pitt is aloof
and arrogant
. cage struck instant chemcial sparks with co
- star meg ryan
, where the chemistry between pitt
adn forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani ' s character is so shallow that she can ' t see beyond pitt ' s good looks
. the movie ' s other top nmae is a much better actr
,
but thyat doesn ' t save meet joe black
. sir anthony hopkins isn ' t given much better material tothe work with
, unfortunatly
. he plays one of these good
- hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood
.
( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins ' s character more realistically evil
.
) hopkins is maked for death due to a bad tacker
,
bu death steps in
and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world
. ofthe course
, no one can be sure ofthe how htey will act wehn death taps on their shoulder
.
but i have tothe wonder
(
and in this movie
, you have a veyr long time tothe wonder
) how you or i would act in a similar situation
, expecially if ytou or i weere a multimillionaire
. hopkins pretty much goes to the office
-
-
adn the major subplot revolves arund who will control tghe corporation
. fans of corperate intrigue wiull be facinated
, i ' m sure
. i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black
,
and i ' m asking mysef why
. movies about death should encourage ytou to live life to tje fullest
, which is what i ' m going to do now
. go spend time with your family
, go volentier forthe a local charity
, heck
, go tkae a nap
. don ' t go see meet joe black
, beccause all it will do is move you threee long hours closer to death
