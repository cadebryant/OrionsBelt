it
' s now the annviersary of the slayings ofthe julie james
'
( jennifer love hewitt
) best friends
. still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responisble for it all
, she seems tothe be onthe the verge of a nervous breakdown
. she cant
' t concentrate on her schoolwork
, can
' t get a good night
' s sleep
,
and is even frightened by the shadows
and tghe blinking strobe lights at a local dance club
. everywhere she looks
, she sees visions ofthe tyhe man in a rubber slicker iwth the hook on his h
and
. in the first movie
,
` i know what you did last summer
'
, julie
and three ofthe her friends accidentalyl kill a man
, runnung him down while driving down a dark mountain highway
. to cover their misdeed
, they dump the body into the ocean
.
however
, he never quite died annd returned to hunt down julie
and her friends
. julie
and one other
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, survivied onyl tothe make this dismal sequal
. needing some desparate rest
and relaxation
, she isnt elated to leran that her college roommate
, karla
( br
andy
)
, has won a trip for four tothe a secluded tropical isl
and
. accompanying these two girls are karla
' s overbearing boyfriend
, tyrell
( mehki phifer
)
and a potential beau fo julie
.
but was tihs contest too ogod tothe be true
? the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed liek love boat rejects
. meanwhile
, the hotel is practically deserted as tghe storm season is baout tothe begin
. this presumably creates a venue where they iwll be secluded anbd will have no possible means off thte isl
and
. eventually
, they will be hunted down durring power outages adn chased aroud during intense ilghtning storms
. as you might hvae guessed
, somewhere inspite the shadows lurk a mysteriously stange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker adn wielding a hook
. julie tries tothe convince her firends that thte killer is onthe the isl
and
( an eerie touch is when she is singing
" i will survive
" at hte karaoke bar
and the words scroll
" i still know
.
.
.
"
)
, bu her firends chalk it up to paranoia
.
but the body count soon starts tothe rise
, annd fo julie
, it
' s going to be the worst vacation of her life
. the funny
( yes
, i used the word
' funny
'
) thing about this movie isnt that i heard more chortling
and giggling
( maybe it was my giggling
) than i heard screaming
. this movei boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness
. there isn
' t even any suspense that leads up tothe the deaths
. here
' s an appropriate exemple
. knock
- knock
.
" housekeeping
"
, says the diminuitive cleaning lady
. hte doorjam suddenly opens up
. slash
. next victim
! is there any reason to go
and see this movie
? not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around iin circles for about 90 minutes
. bu i do want to sday one thing about htis movie thgat satisfied me
. i ws thoroughly irritated with tyrell
, who incessantly ranted
and raved about his sexual libido
. i secretly wished for him tothe get filleted
. did he git
' hooked
'
? well
, let
' s just sday that if he didn
' t
, i would give this film a grade of
" d
"
.
