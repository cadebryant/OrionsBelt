i guess thgat if a veyr wild bachler party had gone really bad
, there would be broken furniture
, traces of smack adn cocaine on the floor
,
and a dead prostitute in the bathroom
. i guess that if a movei had also gone realyl bad
, there might be the same elements present
. coincidence
? poor kyle
( a meek looking jon favreau
)
.
.
. he is about tothe marry his radiant fiancee
, laura
( cameron diaz
)
.
but before he exchanges his vows
, he embarks to las vegas with his firends for one last blowout
.
but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get
. the prostitute has met a horrible
,
though accidental death
, adn drugs are everywhere
. tjhe five friends agree thast htere is enough bad evidence here that wiull send them to jail for a very long time
. a surprizingly calm robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, who looks like he wass groomed tothe mkae nefarious decisions
, ponders their dilemma fo a few minutes before deciding thgat the best thing to dont is to bury tyhe body in tjhe dezert where she
' ll never be found
.
al
though they stomach thge gruesome ded of getting rid ofthe the body
( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stfuf it into suitcases
)
, when they return ffrom their trip
, guilt
and paranoia beggins tothe set in whihc slowy consumes some of the five friends
. one is adam
( daniel stern
) he grows increasingly agitated
. whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way
, his blood pressure increases
. or that just may be because ofthe his dysfunctional famaly
. another is michael
, who was actually responsible forthe her death
. he tries to bury his feelings
,
but the burden ofthe guilt begins to affect his judgment as well
. boyd is the
? doer
' of the gropu
. seemingly suffering from a long psychosis
, when he feels as if his secret is about tothe be exposed
, he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks
. kyle just hopes that his wedding iwll live up to laura
' s dem
anding expectations
.
then
, there
' s moore
( lel
and orser
) who speaks 5 lines
and walks around wtih a puzzled look onthe his face
. the problem with this reprehensible movie isnt that it wants to be a cruel comedy
, bu it presents things infact a manner that just aren
' t funny
. drugs
, mutilation
,
and killing your pwn firends isn
' t something to be laughed at
. as a straight pyschological drama
, i could see how it might have worked
, as eahc one tried tothe maneuver
and overcome the weight of their own guilt in theri own sometimes
- sick ways
.
but this movei insults us by assuming thast we sould simpley discard our values forthe 2 hours
. if ytou do like thsi movei
, i don
' t think thast i wanna to nkwo you
. i doed find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not thte right thing
but the
? smart play
.
'
and diaz adds some brightness to thsi film as a wedding
- needing fiancee
.
but her talents are essentially wasted here
. it
' s obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone
.
but teh way thyat he chooses to do it isnt tasteless
. dont not make a very bad decision by seing this film
.
