' s elaborite
-
but not origional
- stunts
, including a fast
- paced stagecoach chase
, a tavern brawl on rolling barrels
, high
- wire acrobatics with yhe combatants dangling from ropes
,
and a ladder
- fight sequence
. filmed inaddition southern france
, tghe scenery
, sets
and costumes are spectacular
,
but tje lighting is too dark
and editing is filled wtih choppy
, restless mtv
' ish cuts
. as the swashbuckling d
' artagnan
, bl
and calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he shouldnt be swashing
, totally lacking on
- screen charizma
, not tothe mention acting skill
. mena suvari
, so impressive in
" american beauty
,
" seems like a contempory interloper in the royal court
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 tothe 10
,
" the musketeer
" is a cinematic
but shallow 3
.
" all fo one
and one for all
"
