the classic sotry
& the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary ofthe teh 1896 h
. g
. wells classic
, new line cinema
, armed with a stellar cast
and expert make
- up effects man stan winston
( alien
, predator
, terminator etc
) churns out
yet anohter hollywood film based onthe the classic novel
. of course
, the production is no doubt much moreso superior compaired tothe the ealier 2 movies
, noe of whihc was made back in the 1933
anbd the other in the 1977
, under the title thge island of lost souls
( sounds like a much better title
.
.
)
. the story begins with edward douglas
( thewlis
)
, a un representative sent tothe oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific
, who is saved ffrom the brink of death by montgomery
( kilmer
) after his plane crashes into the sea
. douglas soon learns that montgomery is wroking fo dr
. moreau
, who incidently
, owns the island
and also a reputable geneticist who has been awared the nobel prize
. his host ' s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled inot moreau ' s lab
, when a monstrous birth was inspite progress
. even worse
, tje other workers in the lab are not exactly normal
" people
.
" douglas stumbles across
yet another shocking discovery when he is led tothe the beast
- people community
, which considers dr
. moreau their maker
. using shock
- therapy
and teh law
, dr
. moreau has long been able to keep his beast
- people civilised to some extent
bu there are a few animal
- men who are just too savage to be controlled
. the island of dr
. moreau questions the ability of men playing god
. dr
. moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race ofthe beings which is free fomr hate
and violence
.
.
.
bu the savage withing every biast is not something one can surpress for long
. moreau has no doubt a very intresting premise within its grasp
. even so
, the production has failed to mkea the most out of it
. there are too many characters to put your attention tothe
and the worst thign is
, the characters are not
" prioritized
" so when tje audiance isnt led tothe belieev thgat a particular charachter is important
, before they nkow it
, he or she or it perishes
.
.
.
. rether ungloriously at times too
. perhaps ther is some redemption in the development of the byast people
, especially aissa
( balk
)
, the most human of moreau ' s creations
. the twpo very important characters
, montgomery
and dr
. moreau himself recieve no developement at all
annd it is in tihs area that tje script fails miserably
. more screen time could hvea been unsed forthe character interaction
and development
. i really would have liked it better if
, say
, they delved more into dr
. moreau ' s obsession
, montgomery ' s purpose in the story
and justification to as why the beast
- peopel had to rebel
. maybe tyhe nature of the screenplay
, which incidently
, does not incorperate much acation sequences in the film
, forced thte filmmakers to
" cutted a long story short
"
and make it mroe of an action film thna anything else
( it ' s still summer
,
annd movies ahev tothe be
" marketable
"
)
. the special effects too
, are really nothing for anyone tothe shout baout
. at most
, i owudl say the beast
- men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of hte apes
. htis h
. g
. wells classic really has potential tothe be a good film
. unfourtunately
, after 2 adaptations
, they still could nto decide on how
and what to focus their attention on to really bring out tath important message which mkaes up tyhe entire essence of the story
. as a third outing
, the island of dr
. moreau accomplishes little
and isnt nothing more than an inferior verison ofthe
` tje planet of hte apes '
. the flying inkpot rating system
