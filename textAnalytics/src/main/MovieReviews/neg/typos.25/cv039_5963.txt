the clasic story
& tyhe production which ruined it marking the centenial anniversary of tyhe 1896 h
. g
. wells classic
, new line cinema
, armed withthe a stellar cast
and expert make
- uv effects man stan winston
( alien
, predator
, terminator etc
) churns out
yet another hollywood film based onthe the classic novel
. of course
, the production is no dout much more superior compared tothe the ealier 2 movies
, one of which was made back inwhich the 1933 anbd the otehr in hte 1977
, under the title tjhe isl
and of lost souls
( sounds like a much better title
.
.
)
. yhe stor begins witht edward douglas
( thewlis
)
, a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somwhere inthe tje sourth pacific
, who isnt saved ffrom thge brink of death by montgomery
( kilmer
) after his plane crashes inot the sea
. douglas soon lerans that montgomery is working for dr
. moreau
, who incidently
, owns the isl
and
and allso a reputable geneticist who has been awarded thge nobel prize
. his host
' s reluctance to allow him to freely move arround the isl
and becomes clear wehn he stumbled into moreau
' s lab
, wehn a monstrous birth was in progress
. even worse
, tje other workers in the lab are not exactly normal
" people
.
" douglas stumbles accros
yet another shocking dicovery whn he isnt led to the beast
- people community
, which conciders dr
. moreau theri maker
. using shock
- therapy
and the lew
, dr
. moreau has long been able tothe keep his beast
- people civilised to some extent bu there are a few animal
- men who are jsut too savage tothe be controlled
. the isl
and ofthe dr
. moreau questions the ability of men playing god
. dr
. moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings whic is free fomr hate
and violence
.
.
. bu the savage within eveyr byast is nto something one can suppress forthe long
. moreau hasnt no doubt a very interesting premise withing its grasp
. even so
, tje production has failed to make the most outloud of it
. there are too many characters to put your attention tothe
and the worst thing is
, the characters are nto
" prioritized
" so when the audience isnt led to beleave that a paticular character is important
, befoer they know it
, he or she or it perishes
.
.
.
. rather ungloriously at times too
. perhaps there is soem redemption in the development of the beast peopel
, especialy aissa
( balk
)
, the most human of moreau
' s creations
. the two very important cahracters
, montgomery
and dr
. moreau himselv receive no develepment at all
and it is in this areal that thte scirpt fails miserably
. more screen time could have beeen used fo carachter interaction annd devolopment
. i raelly owudl have liked it better if
, sday
, they delved more inot dr
. moreau
' s obsession
, montgomery
' s purpose in the stry annd justification to as why tjhe beast
- people had to rebel
. maeby the nature of the screenplay
, which incidently
, doesnt not incorperate much acation sequences in the film
, forced the filmmakers tothe
" cut a long story short
"
and make it more ofthe an action film than anything else
( it
' s still summer
,
and movies have to be
" marketable
"
)
. the special effects too
, are realy nothing for anyone to shout baout
. at most
, i would sday the beast
- men looked just a bited more realsitic than those apes in planet of the apes
. this h
. g
. wells classic really has potential to be a ogod film
. unfortunately
, after 2 adaptations
, tehy still could not decide on how annd what to focus thier attension on to really bring outloud that important message which makes up the entire essence of the sotry
. as a third outing
, the isl
and ofthe dr
. moreau accomplishes little
and is nothing more tahn an inferior version of
` the planet of teh apes
'
