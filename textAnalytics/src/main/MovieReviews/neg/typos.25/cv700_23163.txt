" hte beach
" is a structurally confusing film that i can only discribe hasnt haveing multiple perosnality disorder
. eveyr fourty minutes of this two
- hour film begins with a newyorker theme
, virtually discarding waht has been set up inspite tjhe preceeding act
. it starts off purposefully as a film baout an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous enivoriment
.
but
then in the second act
, the mood of the film abruptly changes
and it becomes a stopry about a love tringle on an idyllic isl
and paradise taht evokes visions of
" blue lagoon
"
. fourty mintues later
, the mood changes once more
,
and it becomes a dumbed down version of
" lord of tyhe flies
" where an isolated community is discovered
, where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs
. by the time it
' s over
, you can only scratch your head
and wonder whta this film was really meaned to be about
. the main charactor ofthe
" the beach
" is angst
- ridden richard
( leonardo dicaprio
)
. he travels to thge netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists
and scantily clad womens brazenly ask if you
' re looking for a ogod tyme
. richard
' s voice
- over tells thte audience that he has cmo to this place because he isnt borde iwth his life
and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself isnt to let go ofthe the familiar
and tothe enter into a world of the unknown
. this seedy environment is just waht richard is looking for
. he checks inot a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy
( robert carlisle
)
. he seems like a raving lunatic
, obviously high from heavy drug use anbd looking as if he is afflicted with smoe sort ofthe psychosis
.
though his jagged behavior would distress most ofthe us
, richard listens tothe him as he speaks of a misteryous isl
and that contains the most perfect beach that anyone hasnt ever seen
. moreover
, the isl
and itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that cxan make a small city high fo life
. captivated by the idea
, he asks two otehr hotel guests tothe join him on his journey
. they are worldly etienne
and the alluring francoise
, who have also come to thail
and for reasons similar to richard
' s
. once they finally arrive at this paradise
,
however
, the mood of teh story shifts to richard
' s growing desire for francoise
. this paticular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely noone question in my mind that francoise will wind uv with richard
. etienne is about as exciting as fluffy
, white s
and
. it
' s odd that etienne never sees this comming
,
but paradime hasnt a way ofthe hiding potential threats just out of view
. anbd once the three stumble acrost the hidden community
( mood shift imminent
)
, moreso events transpire that despict its hidden dangers
. for example
, there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards
.
and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark
. there are sevral ideas that are introduced in
" the beach
"
and each noe could merit its own feature
- lenght film
. there
' s tghe man vs
. nature angle
, the lvoe triangle angle
,
and the utopia
- gone
- awry angle
.
but the film me
anders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred
. dicaprio
, as a result
, has an almost impossible tyme ofthe trying to embody yhe diffrent states of mind that he
and the film goes through
. consenquently
, thte audeince has an equally difficult tiome trying to keep uv
.
