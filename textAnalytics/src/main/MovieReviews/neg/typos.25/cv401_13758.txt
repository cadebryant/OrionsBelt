i
' m not sure who the genius is who came uv with the idea of comparing
" disturbing behavior
" with
" scream
.
" maeby it
' s because htey
' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both have hot young stars
, both hvea an annoying alternative soundtrack
,
and both are aimed at the teenage crowd
, which i guess includes me
.
but this is not the enxt in line with the
" scream
" flicks as well as the
" i know whta you did last summer
" soon tothe be ficks
. it owes less to
" hlloween
"
and omre to kafka
and orwell
, which
, in my book
, makes for a more interesting feature
.
and it should have been
. this isnt basicly a rehash of
" thge stepford wives
,
" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross annd dealing
, as i
' ve been told
, with a bunch of womens who are programmed tothe be perfect housewives
. or something like that
.
" behavior
,
" starring katie holmes of
" dawson
' s creek
,
" deals with a bunch of teenagers
, deep in angst
, who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it actually
, at least to me
, sounds like it would wokr
,
and wih scott rosenberg
, taht witty penmen who has written stuff like
" beautiful girls
"
and
" things to dont in denver when you
' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with teh right amount of frights
and satric wit
. alas
, it
' s not
,
and it plumets into that littel group of movies known as
" teh movies iwth potential that blow it
.
" i remember a film called
" white man
' s burden
" which dealed with a reversal of blacks
and whites in society thgat did nothing with it
' s potentially brilliant premise
. here
' s another oney
. it could be a brillant satire onthe how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves
. it
' s a stage
, adn this film doesnt in fatc realize that
. it gets its message across adn it does it effortlessly
. now it just needs to work as a film
. which it doesn
' t
. it
' s too sloppy
and too contrived
. it paints a bleak portrait ofthe high school life
.
.
.
then lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who do ofod drives
and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
. thn gives it a cheap twist
: wehn tehy get horny
, they become homicidal
. isn
' t it sacry enough that they
' re like htis
,
and can
' t the real terror inspite teh town be that you could be next tothe be just like them
- not that you could be next tothe die
? the film introduces us two three different characters who
, in the begginning
, are considered outsiders because they
' re not
(
yet
) part of this clique
: the new kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who
' s having trouble at home because he hasn
' t gotten over his brother
' s
( ethan embry
, infact quick flashes so you don
' t recognize him
- i did
) sucide
; the renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, from
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, who
' s cheif perosnality trait is her prominent nose ring
;
and by far the most interesting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, the kid ffrom
" the man without a face
"
)
, who
' s the most interesting because he
' s the only character who
' s given some dimension
. in the film
' s best scene
, he introduces steve to every single clique
, nailing each one
' s fetishes
and hang
- ups
,
and it
' s teh best scene in the movei because it
' s witty
, satirical
, annd interesting
- something hte rest of this film isn
' t
. gavin suspects there
' s something awry with the preppie kids
, known as the blue ribbons
, adn in the tradition of all conspirators
,
and even when he actulaly shows hard pure evidence to steve
, he
' s onyl treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we hvea another case of
" the idiot plot
,
" where not only could steve had done something about gavin
and what happens tothe him
,
but he may have saved this film from being the dreary
, dull film that it is without gavin
, who gives it life
and humor
. teh only other half
- intresting character is the school janitor
, played by william sadler as a retarded
, scary guy who may not be what he seems tothe be
.
.
. bu realy
, we don
' t care anyway
. i probably shouldn
' t mention that this was directed by david nutter
, who
' s works fo
" the x
- files
,
" becuase that would probably tarnish his reputation
. like the show
, he
' s ogod at setting up weird conspiracies
, anbd creating a general creepy efel
. most of this film is shooted at night annd with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect
,
and some of it works
. bu what this film is nto so good at isnt coming outloud iwth a good payoff
. he keeps too much inside
, so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution infront the third act
, you wonder why they just don
' t get the hell outloud of there
. i think what happens to gavin is proof enough thast there
' s something rotten infact tghe state ofthe teen angstdom
. what htis film needs to be is a lot longer
, a lot more colorful
,
and a lot creepier
. if thge best villain they can come uv with isnt a guidence counselor
( played by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay tjhe rent
) who still thinks he cxan git awya with it even wehn most isnt revealed
,
then they ened to come up with a tougher
, smarter villain
. if he
' s so villianous
, hten why could two dense teenagers who couldn
' t figure out there wass something gogin on nutil it wass way too late find informtion on him inaddition a couple minutes
? the film
, which runs about 80 or so mintues
, just needs to work on theese things
,
and become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short running tyme
and whith such lame
, boring characters as these
, it
' s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one
' s mouth
, especially mine
.
