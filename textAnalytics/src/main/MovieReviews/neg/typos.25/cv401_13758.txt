i ' m nto sure who the genius isnt who came up with the idea ofthe comparing
" disturbing behavior
" wiht
" scream
.
" maybe it ' s because htey ' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both ahev hot young stars
, both ahve an annoying alternative soundtrack
,
and both are aimed at the teenage crowd
, which i guess includes me
.
but htis is nto the next inaddition line iwth the
" scream
" flicks as well as thge
" i know what you did last summer
" soon to be flicks
. it owes less to
" halloween
"
and more to kafka
and orwell
, which
, in my book
, makes for a omre interesting feature
.
and it should ahve been
. tihs is basically a rehash of
" the stepford wives
,
" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross
anbd dealing
, as i ' ve been told
, with a bunch of women who are programmed tothe be perfect housewives
. or something liuke that
.
" behavior
,
" starring katie holmes ofthe
" dawson ' s creek
,
" deals with a bunch of teenagers
, deep inwhich angst
, who are bieng programmed to be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it ctually
, at least to me
, sounds like it would work
,
and whith scott rosenberg
, that witty penmen who has written stuff like
" beautiful girls
"
and
" things tothe do in denver wehn you ' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it actally sounds liek it may be pulled off wtih thte right ammount of frights
and satric wit
. alas
, it ' s not
,
and it plumets inot that little group of movies known as
" the movies with potential tyhat blow it
.
" i remember a film called
" white man ' s burden
" which dealt whith a reversal ofthe blacks
and whites in society thgat did nothing with it ' s potentially brilliant premise
. here ' s another noe
. it sould be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need tothe go through teen angst in order to find themselfs
. it ' s a stage
,
adn htis film does in fact relize that
. it gets its message across
and it doesnt it effortlessly
. nowe it jsut needs to work as a film
. which it doesn ' t
. it ' s too sloppy
and too contrived
. it paints a obleek portrait ofthe high school life
.
.
.
thn lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch ofthe disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who do food drives
and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
.
thne gives it a cheap twist
: when they git horny
, they become homicidal
. isn ' t it scry enought that tehy ' re like this
,
and cin ' t tghe real terror inaddition the twon be that you could be next tothe be just liek them
- not that you sould be next tothe dieu
? hte film introduces us two three different characters who
, in the beginning
, are consdiered outsiders because they ' re not
(
yot
) part of this clique
: the new kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who ' s having trouble at home becuase he hasn ' t gotten over his brother ' s
( ethan embry
, in quick flashes so you don ' t recogize him
- i did
) suicide
; tghe renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, from
" dawson ' s creek
"
)
, who ' s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring
;
annd by far the most interesting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, yhe kid ffrom
" tghe man without a face
"
)
, who ' s the most intresting because he ' s the only character who ' s given some dimention
. in the film ' s best scene
, he introduces steve to every single clique
, nailing eahc one ' s fetishes
and hang
- ups
,
adn it ' s thge best scene in the movei because it ' s witty
, satirical
,
and interesting
- something the rest ofthe this film isn ' t
. gavin suspects there ' s something awry with the preppie kids
, known as the blue ribbons
,
and in the tradition of all conspirators
,
anbd even whn he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve
, he ' s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we have another case of
" the idiat plot
,
" where not only could steve had done something baout gavin
and what happens to him
,
but he may have saved thsi film from being the dreary
, dull film that it is without gavin
, who gives it life
and humor
. the only other half
- interesting character is the school janitor
, palyed by william sadler as a retarded
, scary guy who may not be what he seems tothe be
.
.
.
but really
, we don ' t care anyway
. i probably shouldn ' t mention that this was directed by david nutter
, who ' s works fo
" the x
- files
,
" because that would probably tarnish his reputation
. like tjhe show
, he ' s ogod at setting up weird conspiracies
,
and creating a general creepy fiel
. most ofthe thsi film is shot at niht
anbd with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect
,
and some ofthe it works
.
but what this film isnt nto so good at isnt coming outloud wiht a ogod payoff
. he keesh too much inside
, so much taht when the characters journey to a mental insitution iin the third ect
, you wonder why they jstu don ' t get the hell out of there
. i think what happens to gavin is proof enough thyat there ' s something rotten in tghe state of teen angstdom
. what this film needs to be is a lot longer
, a lot more colorful
,
and a lot creepier
. if the best villain they cant come up with isnt a guidance counselor
( played by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regular obviously jsut trying to pay the rent
) who still thinks he can get awya with it even whn most isnt revealed
,
then they need to come up with a tougher
, smarter villain
. if he ' s so villainous
,
thn why could twpo dense teenagers who couldn ' t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find informtion on him in a couple minutes
? the film
, whic runs about 80 or so minutes
, just needs tothe work on these thigns
,
adn become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short running time
and with such lame
, boring characters as theese
, it ' s pretty much obvious taht leaving thsi film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one ' s mouth
, especially mine
.
