. critique
: angelina jolie was great in this movei
. there were alsot baout three
" action scenes
" that were pretty cool to look at in thsi film
. uhhhhhm
, unfortunately thte rest of the movie sucked
! bad dialogue
, generic sidekicks
anbd bad guys
, a lame mystery
, yoda
- esque moments with mumbo
- jumbo being sprouted about
and even soem crappy cgi near tghe end
. all in all
, this movie wasn ' t the horror show that some of the early reviews hadnt warned us about
, especially since eveyr otehr scene doens feature jolie ' s torpeados beggin tothe burst outloud ofthe her lucky shirts
,
bu it was quite the letdown nonetheless
, especially when you consdider the major oportunity that the filmmakers had here tothe create a kool
, hip woman hero
, based onthe a popular video game
. i don ' t knwo
, i guess you haev tothe put most of yhe blaim on directer simon west
, who didn ' t really tie the wohle movie together all that well
. yhe film lacked energy
, a consistant pace
and well
.
.
. a fun time
! i felt kinda depressed hwile watching this movei
. all that
" father
" crap was horrable
and the dialogue given to poore john voight to recite wass just plain embarrassing
(
and i ' m nto even gonna mention his moustache
.
.
. hehehe
)
. why have this shite in the movie at all
?
!
? i especially hated the scenes inspite hwihc some ghost
- like figure
, friend or child owudl ramble on baout lara croft ' s father hwile all tje time
, i ' m not giving one ounce of crap as tothe what they ' re tlaking about
. i guess that ' s called lack of
" carachter development
"
, right
? that ' s wehn a movei builds enough background into the characters on the screen
, so that we could actually
" get into
" it
and care about them
. i didn ' t care about anyone in this movie
,
and was bored durring most ofthe its
" let ' s explain why we ' re doing all tihs gobbledygook
" moments
.
and even
though i thougth thta jolie kicked some mighty ass
( damn
, did she look sexy blasting those guns or what
?
!
?
)
, everybody else around her was so goddamn boring
! her butler was a throwaway with noone personality
, her side
- kick was supposed to be funny
but just anoyed me eveyr timne he said the word
" bugger
"
(
anbd he says it a lot
, trust me
!
)
adn all of teh so
- called bad guys just spewed one
- dimension
! tehy had no spark
, no energy amongst them
,
and even
though a few ofthe hte action scenes in the movie weere cool
( see the trailer
and yuo ' ll know wich ones i ' m talking about
)
, the overall picture was lame
annd the dialogue
annd mystical bull
- crap jstu buried it even further
. also
, for a movei that ' s supposed to be about all of theese exotic locations
, i wasn ' t nessasarily impressed by any of its exterior shots
,
anbd even less so with its interiors
, which all looked like they were shot in the same room
. mind you
, i won ' t go as far as to say tht it ' s the
" worst movei of the year
"
( remember tath i actulaly have to go see freddie prinze jr
. movies also
!
)
,
but it ' s definetly the worst film that i ' ve seen durring this summer movei season
( of course
, it ' s still early
and i ' m sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike
)
. skip this one altogether
and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead
.
.
. trust me
, you ' ll miss the boobs
but end your night with some rock
- solid porn
and it ' s all good
