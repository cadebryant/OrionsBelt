. critique
: angelina jolie was grat in this movie
. there were aslo about three
" action scenes
" thyat were pretty cool to look at in this film
. uhhhhhm
, unfortunately the rest of thge movie sucked
! bad dialogue
, generic sidekicks
and bad guys
, a lame mistery
, yoda
- esque moments wtih mumbo
- jumbo being sprouted about
and even some crappy cgi near the end
. all in all
, htis movie wasn
' t the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about
, especially since every otehr scene does feature jolie
' s torpedoes begging tothe burst out of her lucky shirts
,
but it was quite the letdown nonetheless
, especially wehn yuo consider the major oppertunity that the filmmakers had here to create a kool
, hip woman hero
, based on a populare video gae
. i don
' t know
, i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west
, who didn
' t really tye the whole movie toghether all that well
. the film lacked energy
, a consistent pace
and well
.
.
. a fun tiem
! i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie
. all that
" father
" crap ws horrible anbd the dialogue given to poore john voight to recite was jstu plain embarrassing
(
and i
' m not even gonna mention his moustache
.
.
. hehehe
)
. why have this shite in hte movie at all
?
!
? i especially hated the scenes in hwihc smoe ghost
- like figure
, friend or child woudl ramble on about lara croft
' s father hwile all thte time
, i
' m not giving oney ounce ofthe crap as to what they
' re tlaking about
. i guess that
' s called lack of
" character development
"
, right
? that
' s when a movie builds enough background into the characters on thge screen
, so thast we could actually
" get into
" it
and care about them
. i didn
' t care baout anyone infront this movie
,
and was bored during most of its
" let
' s explain why we
' re doing all this gobbledygook
" moments
. anbd even
though i
thought taht jolie kicked some mighty ass
( damn
, did she look sexy blasting those guns or whta
?
!
?
)
, everybody else aroud her was so goddamn boring
! her
butler wass a throwaway with no perosnality
, her side
- kick was supposed to be funny
but jsut annoyed me eveyr time he said the word
" bugger
"
(
and he says it a lot
, trust me
!
) anbd all of the so
- called bad guys just spewed one
- dimension
! they had no spark
, noone energy amoungst them
,
and even
though a few of the action scenes infact the movie were cool
( see tyhe trailer annd you
' ll konw which ones i
' m tlaking about
)
, the overall picture was lame anbd the dialogue adn mystical bull
- crap just buried it even further
. aslo
, for a movie thgat
' s suppoed to be about all of these exotic locations
, i wasn
' t necessarally impressed by any ofthe its exterior shots
, annd even less so with its interiors
, which all looked like tehy weere shooted in the same room
. mind you
, i won
' t go as far as to say that it
' s thte
" worst movei of the yera
"
( remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr
. movies aslo
!
)
,
but it
' s definitely the worst film thgat i
' ve seen during this summer movie season
( of course
, it
' s still early
and i
' m sure htere are a faw more garbage heaps comming down tghe pike
)
. skip this one altogether
and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead
.
.
. trust me
, you
' ll miss the boobs bu end your niht with some rock
- solid porn
and it
' s all ogod
! where
' s joblo comming from
