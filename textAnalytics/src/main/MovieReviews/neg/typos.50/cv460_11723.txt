the owrd tothe describe sharon stone is
" wonder
"
. nto tht she
_ isnt
_ a wonder
, bu rether thast i wonder how she can be so inconsistent
. she hasnt a dynamic screen presence infront
" basic instinct
"
, turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in
" casino
"
,
but posesses neither ofthe thsoe here
. stone teams up witht private skool headmaster
' s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani
' s throughly unlikable husban
( chazz palminteri
)
. infact a comedy ofthe errors
and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock
( as infront
` homage tothe
'
[ read
" steal from
"
]
)
, it turns out that somone saw them or he
' s not dead or maybe
.
.
. kathy bates turns inspite a credible
, if unspectacular
, peformance as an investigative polical detective
. her charcter isnt a bit dull
but realistic
,
al
though her actions at the end are puzzling
. adjani isnt more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to despiration
. it
' s stone that isnt a dissapointment among thge actors
. how can she be thte epitomy ofthe a femme fatale in previous films anbd come off as a blank in htis oney
? costumed inspite skin
- tight clothes adn looking down her nose at everyone
, she is somone ytou would want to avoid beccause she isnt boring
, not enticingly dangerous
. even the threath
( or promise
?
) ofthe a lesbian relatiopnship betwen tjhe conspirators is only half palyed out
. onthe tyhe positive side
, there are enought unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive
. that isnt if ytou cant put uv wih stone
' s cardboard cutted
- outloud character anbd scenes driectly lifted from hitch
' s movies
.
