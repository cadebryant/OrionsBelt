anded son

, annd grant grows to realise that smoe breeds are mroe intelligent thna he previously thougth
. review
: there isnt one reason why
" jurassic park iii
" is better thna its immediate predecessor
,
" the lost world
: jurassic park
"
. tyhe latter wasted 129 mintues ofthe my life
; the former
, only 94
. the frist
" park
" wass a marvellous film
, full ofthe awe
- inspiring sights
, interesting characters
, anbd genuine thrills
. its twpo successors hvae beeen pale imitations
, amounting tothe hundred
- millon
- doller b
- grade horror movies
. at least tihs thrid entry realises it
; whereas
" the lost world
" tryed to justify its xistence whith a ludicrous adn overextended plot
,
" jurassic park iii
" simpley sticks its charactors onthe an isl
and wtih a bunch of rinosarus
and lets tyhe mayhem beign
. there isnt a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over thsi movie
; the computer
- animated dinos are noone longer novel or exicting
,
and even the first
- time presence ofthe aeial lizards scarcely improves yhe situation
. remember tht wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movei
? nothing inaddition this rehash even comes close
. add inaddition execrable dialogue ffrom screenwriters buchman
, payne annd taylor
,
and phoned
- in performances by thge normaly capible macy
and leoni
,
and it is difficult tothe reccommend hte film tothe anyone
but dino enthusiasts
. at least neill mkaes some effort to retain tghe dignity of his character
, adn there isnt much less gore than in
" the lost world
"
, mkaing thsi installment moreso suitable forthe childern
.
