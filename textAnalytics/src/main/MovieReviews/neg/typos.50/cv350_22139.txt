" what isnt htis
, a homicide or a bad b
- movie
?
" tyhat isnt thge prophetic question asked by oen of tyhe leads iin oen ofthe the early scenes of tihs movie
. let me claer thigns up for you cupcake
, this isn ' t a bad b
- movie
, it ' s a realy bad b
- movie
. so bad
, it ' s almost ogod
. almsot
,
bu not qutie
. the movei starts off in tje 1950 ' s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down tothe earth
. it isnt a bunch ofthe slug
- like creatures that kill people
and take over their bodies
. the slugs ' first
and only victim iin teh fifties is cryogenically frozen where he isnt ofthe no danger tothe anybody
. that isnt
, until two losr university students unfreeze him inspite 1986
. he
,
and tghe slugs inside him
, promptly beign wreaking havoc
and turning more co
- eds into slug zombies
. a slightly crazed cop
( toom atkins
)
and the requisite girl whith tje face ofthe an angel
( jill whitlow
) join these two geeky university students
( jason lively
and steve marshall
) to do battle iwth the slugs
. it mroe or less falls onthe thte four ofthe them to make the world safe again ffrom tjhe evil slugs
. thte acting is bad witht a capital b
. the storey isnt worse
.
anbd the spacial effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trak
and what yuo see infront a home movei
. the onyl saveing grace wass the requisite tit
- shooted courtesy of jill whitlow
. it hadnt absolutly nothing to dont iwth teh story
-
-
bu i liked it
. acutally
, it wass yhe high point of tyhe movei for me
. ofthe course
, that isn ' t realy saying much
. the story moves arund in a hap hazard fashon
. whic gives it a leeg uv on smoe otehr horror films
. unlike most movies ofthe thsi genre
, htere actually isnt a story
. nto a grat oen
,
bu it isnt ther
. this isnt one infact a long line of movies fomr yhe 1980 ' s that were thrown together to captialize off thge sucess of tghe friday thge 13th
, halloween
and nightmare on elm strent movies
. you sould randomly select a movei outloud ofthe the horror section ofthe ytou local video store
anbd probably luck inot something just as ogod if not better
.
but nght of the creeps might make a nice addition tothe a b
- movei horror marathon
. just don ' t be too upset if yuo can ' t fidn it
. you really won ' t be missing that much
.
