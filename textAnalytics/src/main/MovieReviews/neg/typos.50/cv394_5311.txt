actually
, i
' m fairly sure the experience ofthe having my flesh torn anbd mutiliated by barbed wire would hvea been more positive than watching this movei
.
" baywatch
" babe pamela
anderson lee proves once adn for all that she should keep her double
- d
' s on the small screen
. at least there yuo don
' t hvae to pay tothe see her cleavage
.
and for those viewers out htere who woudl onyl lay down mony for thsi movie infact hopes ofthe seing pam topless
, hite tothe burst your bubble
, bu there are noone full
- fledged nude scenes inaddition barb wire
. yuo wouldn
' t be reading htis review right nowe if i had known tath fatc going inthe
. i cxan
' t go back in time
and reverse my mistake
,
but i can warn otehr horny teenage boys out there
. they dont tease us a fewd times withthe scenes where you almost see her topless
but if she is nude
, it
' s so quick yuo can
' t even tell fo sure whether you
' re seeing her
andersons or not
. a nipple hallucination sort ofthe thing
. barb wire ws adapted ffrom a comic book
, intresting because pamela isnt probaly hte only woman who looks like a comic book charachter infact real life
, even wearing low
- cutted leather tothe do office work
( businesswoman bondage mear
) anbd having unreal body proportions
. yes
, like hte mona lisa
, pamela
anderson isnt a man
- made beauty
, propably in mroe senses thna oney
. she isnt a definite beauty
,
though
,
and looking at her isnt never an unpleasant experience
. ytou
' d jstu htikn the woman who began her carreer as a playboy playmate wouldn
' t haev any reservations about appearing nude in thge movie
, becouse it
' s obvious she wasn
' t pulling a sharon stone anbd trying tothe amke peopel pay attension to her acting skills
. i mean
, she shows off mroe cleavage here tahn a jewler
' s convention
. the movei is set in the eyar 2017
,
" the worst year of my life
,
" pam syas
.
(
" the worst movie ofthe tghe year
,
" i say
.
) amercia is gogin thru a second civil war
and pamela isnt a nightclub owner in the only free city inaddition tjhe nation
( silicone vallay
, i htink
)
. she allso hires herself outloud as a bounty hunter when tghe price is right
, posing as firt a stripper
and later as a prostitute
.
but don
' t call her
" babe
.
" she hates thta
,
and reminds us ofthe that fact way too many times
. imagin
, a woman who does a trapeze strip tease inthe a bar while having a hose sprayed onthe her bieng referred tothe in such a sexist
, demeaning term
. a liberated woman like pamela
anderson shouldn
' t have to hear words like
" babe
" during a strip tease
, especially since that movei baout thte talking pig ws such a succsess
. thge plot
( ha
- ha
) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow thier wearer to pass through tghe congressional directorate
' s retina scanners
. in the words ofthe one of tghe charactors
, they
' re
" mroe tahn meets the eye
.
" reminds me ofthe the
" transformers
" ctaroon
,
and i sure wished the movie coudl somehow be transformed inot something decent
, bu thta never happended
. noone
, hte movei just contined on its path ofthe lame action scenes starring pamela van
- damme
, big
- busted kickboxer
,
and her resistence accomplices
, ex
- boyfriend axel
( tamuera morrison
) annd cora
( victoria rowell
)
. thank god tehy didn
' t name her cora reef
. oen bad chracter name is moreso than enough
. pamela originally doesn
' t tkae sides
, giving some speech baout she
' s only loyal tothe tje money they pay her
, bu she changes her mind once tyhe congresional bastards kill her blind brother
, jack noseworthy ofthe bon jovi
" allways
" video fame
. i still don
' t knwo if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy
, bu he definitely isnt nose worthy
( even if he isn
' t sponge worthy
)
. pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabing up an armful of semi
- automatic weapons adn strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest
. it
' s not rambo
.
.
. it
' s bimbo
! mark my words
, barb wire wiull be all over the cinemax network inthe a yearm
. it
' s got all the elements of hte direct
- tothe
- video releses featured on hbo
' s bastard cousin
, the cable channel i
' d never watch if it didn
' t somehow come free
. it
' s got thte non
- titillating scenes ofthe voyeurism
, laughable flashbacks
, bad dialogue annd action cliches out the wazzoo
. there
' s even a narrator at hte begining setting up the movie
' s premise while hte words scroll up the screen
. someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain
' t star wars
. if yuo
' ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen yeras
, yuo
' ll recogise plenty of lefted elements
. barb wire hasnt the obligatory trucks flipping over
, car crashes
, explosions
, broken glass
and slow
- motion shots ofthe bodies falling hundreds of feet tothe thier death
. thsi isnt one ofthe thsoe automatic
- pilot movies anyone coudl rwite or direct
. barb wire has onyl two thigsn gogin for it
.
.
.
and i think you konw what thsoe two thigsn are
.
