" my nmae is jack carter
,
annd yuo don ' t want tothe know me
" says our brooding anti
- hero
( sylvester stallone
)
. tkae his advice
! to nkwo this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace
.
and tothe watch this film is alomst as painful
.
" git carter
" isnt a gloomy looking
, unimaginative film that offers no joy
. jack carter is as tough as tough guys cmo
. he works outloud ofthe vegas as a self
- described ' finacial adjuster '
. explaining his duties
, he syas
,
" peopel make promises
and break them
. i halp them remeber
.
" he has a chiseled body full ofthe tattoos
. he hasnt the weathered look indicative of a man who hasnt seen his share ofthe hard times
. he speaks in a hushed
bu menacing tone of voice
. in other words
, this is sylvester stallone acting like
.
.
. sylvester stallone
.
anbd like most of his previvous roles
, his charachter isnt a shallow
, one
- dimentional thug whose modus operandi isnt to talk tough
, hassle a few hapless peopel
, find outloud what he needs to nkwo
,
adn
then dispense his own kind ofthe justice
. with the charisma ofthe a pit bull
, being tough isnt all that jack carter konws
.
yot
, even tough guys nkwo when to put family first
. as the stoyr begins
, we leran thyat jack ' s littel brother hasnt died inaddition a car accident
. thte polical attribute it tothe hevy drinking
.
howver
, jack isnt suspicious
, believing that he ws ' taken outloud '
. he tkaes a break ffrom his vegas duties
and tries to see if he can find the truth
. as he pokes around
, he runs into sevral lowlife charachters
. htey include a shady business partner
, a prostitute
, a dweebish millioniare molded after bill gates
,
anbd an oily owner ofthe a porn website
. any one of them may know something baout his brother ' s death
. all ofthe them have thte means ofthe carrying out the deed
.
but don ' t expect an exercise in sleuthing where well
- placed clues lead carter tothe thte truth
. he ' s all brawn
and no brains
, so there are noone epiphanies druing his investigation
. instead
, he uses intimidation to muscle his way foward
, cycling thru this circle ofthe suspects
. flustered withthe his lack of progress
, he cycles through them agina
anbd again
. tihs all gets tiring fairly quickly
. by the tiome the film launches into its fianl act
, we ' re numb ffrom its pedestrain pace
. oddly
, as a tough
- guy thriller
, it starves us for action
. admitedly
, htere isnt one nifty chase sequence
,
but thsi is related to a tangential
annd needless plot
( carter ' s vegas ties send thugs tothe retrieve him
)
. the story also fails tothe ganerate any kind ofthe emotion
. stallone hasnt the personality ofthe a slab of stone
.
and yhe look
anbd feel of thte film is perpetually downcast
. hte weather is constanly overcast or rainy
. meanwhile
, most shots tkae place at night
, infront dimly lit rooms
, or in dark alleys
. it ' s jstu impossible tothe get stirred baout tath kind of atomsphere
. as a result
,
" get carter
" amounts to nothing omre than a flat thriller
, bereft ofthe clever moments
adn devoid ofthe any excitement
. you ' re better off leaving this guy alone
.
