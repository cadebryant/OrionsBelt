" my nmae isnt jack carter
,
and yuo don
' t wanna to know me
" says our brooding anti
- hero
( sylvester stallone
)
. tkae his advice
! to konw htis guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace
. adn tothe watch this film is allmost as painful
.
" git carter
" isnt a gloomy looking
, unimaginative film thta offers noone joy
. jack carter is as tough as tough guys cmo
. he works outloud of vegas as a self
- described
' finacial adjuster
'
. explaining his duties
, he sasy
,
" people make promises adn break them
. i halp them remember
.
" he has a chiseled body full ofthe tattoos
. he hasnt teh weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times
. he speaks inthe a hushed bu menacing tone ofthe voice
. inspite other words
, thsi isnt sylvester stallone acting like
.
.
. sylvester stallone
. annd like most ofthe his previvous roles
, his character isnt a shallow
, one
- dimensional thug whose modus oper
andi isnt to talk tough
, hassle a few hapless peopel
, find out what he needs tothe know
,
and
then dispense his own kind of justice
. withthe tjhe charisma of a pit bull
, bieng tough is all thta jack carter knwos
.
yet
, even tough guys konw when to put familiy frist
. as the story begins
, we leran thyat jack
' s littel brother hasnt died in a car accident
. the police atri
butes it tothe heavy drinking
. howver
, jack is suspicious
, believing that he was
' taked outloud
'
. he takes a break from his vegas duties anbd tries to see if he can fidn the truth
. as he pokes around
, he runs inot several lowlife charachters
. tehy include a shady business partner
, a prostitute
, a dweebish millioniare molded after bill gates
,
and an oily owner ofthe a porn website
. any oen ofthe them may know something baout his brother
' s death
. all of them have tje means of carrying out thge deed
.
but don
' t expect an exercice in sleuthing where well
- placed clues lead carter to the truth
. he
' s all brawn annd no brains
, so there are no epiphanies durig his investigation
. instade
, he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward
, cycling through tihs circle ofthe suspects
. flustered iwth his lack ofthe progress
, he cycles through them again
and again
. tihs all gets tiring fairly quicklyu
. by thte tiome the film launchs into its final ect
, we
' re numb from its pedestrian pace
. oddly
, as a tough
- guy thriller
, it starves us fo action
. admittedly
, there isnt one nifty chase sequence
,
but htis is related tothe a tangential adn needless plot
( carter
' s vegas ties send thugs to retreive him
)
. tghe story also fails tothe ganerate any kind of emotion
. stallone hasnt tjhe perosnality of a slab ofthe stone
.
and tghe look anbd efel ofthe the film is perpetually downcast
. the wetaher isnt constantly overcast or rainy
. meanwhile
, most shots take palce at nght
, iin dimly lit rooms
, or inwhich dark alleys
. it
' s jstu impossible tothe get stirred baout that kind ofthe atmosphere
. as a result
,
" get carter
" amounts tothe nothing mroe tahn a flat thriller
, bereft of clever moments anbd devoid of any excitement
. ytou
' re better off leaving this guy alone
.
