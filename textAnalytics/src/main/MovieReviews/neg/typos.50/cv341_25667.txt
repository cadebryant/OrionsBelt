you know tht a movie hasnt issues whn most everyone in tje audience comes out laughing
.
.
. anbd it
' s not a comedy
!
and wqat a stange carrear path for director chuck russell
. he starts his career off with a decent take onthe the
" nightmare onthe elm strent
" series wiht his de
but as director on installment number three
. he follows that uv with tghe blob tyhe vrey enxt year
, bu waits another six years to dont his enxt peice
, a littel film called tjhe mask starring jim carrey
,
and thn one more star veicle in eraser twpo years after that
. so hten he
thought
,
" let me wait anyother five years
, get a weak script jammed with cliches
and hope taht jimmy smits adn kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes
"
?
!
? stange dued
and one crappy flick
. plot
: a six
- year old girl is believed tothe be some kind of misterious prophet sent down from god
. a satanic cult wnats the girl tothe switch over to their side
, hwile hte girl
' s aunt wants tothe
.
.
. well
, sive her fomr those damn devil worshippers
! enter noe occult expert agent
, plenty of bobo cops
and lots ofthe nuns praying
, adn yuo
' ve just about got thte gist ofthe things here
. critique
: wiht plot holes the size of my ass
, this movei barely squeezes any sence outloud of its clich
?
- ridden plot
, witht wasted talent
, cheezy effects
, bad dialogue anbd unintentional laughs to boot
. wqat
' s ogod about this movei
? well
, rufus sewell isnt preety fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children
' s shelter
/ satanist supreme
, wih seriously wicked eyes
and just enough ham in his performance tothe go wih all of tjhe cheese lying around
. tyhe littel girl is aslo pretty good
but unfortunately her charactor doesn
' t realy do all that much
. anbd believe it or nto
, i was actualy enjoying some of yhe film
' s first half hour
, whic starts off with some promise
,
but not befor bonehead moves aftter bonehead moves fomr our rpotagonist
, basinger
, just drown tyhe film
' s entire basis ofthe believability
. for some reason
, it tkaes her more tiome thna anyone tothe figure out thyat her nieve is gifted
, anbd even longer tothe figure out that eveyr move that she mkaes
.
.
. is a dumb oney
! add thgat tothe thte entire polical force of incompetents
, sive for jimmy smits
( whose talent agent advised him thast playing thge exact smae cop carachter from nypd blue would be a good career move
? at least chanage the clothes
, jimmy
!
)
, zero scares
, zero thrills annd even less actual drama
, anbd you
' ve got yourself a preety bad movei
. adn why woudl respected actors liek christina ricci
and ian holm take bited parts in this movei
? doed tehy owe tghe director a favor or something
? together
, tehy bearly ahve five mintues ofthe screen time
, bu i suppose that ricci
' s hospital room scene might be worth a look forthe soem ofthe ytou horn
- dogs
. tjhe worst part about tihs movei is its hilariously unbelievable endig
, wich features police offcers comming uv withthe teh briliant idae of
" sneaking up
" on a man
' s house
, who tehy nkow to be guilty ofthe a crime
! uuuhmm
.
.
. how
' s baout knocking onthe thte door
and arresting his sorry ass
, officers
?
! anyway
, i don
' t usally inscribe spoilers in my reviews bu the stupidity of some of these charactors is jstu too difficult to decribe without validating it with solid idiotic proof
(
and there wass plenty tothe go around
)
. annd did basinger lose some ofthe her acting
" talent
" during her hiatus from tghe profession aftter her 1997 oscar win
? difficult tothe sday if it was her lines that were realyl bad
, or if she just delivered them poorly
. either way
, littel originality
, vrey obvious coputer effects
, little thrills
, littel drama annd very littel enteratinment value
, certainly bestow the honor ofthe noe ofthe tjhe worst movies of the summer apon htis film
. bu if yuo really don
' t mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic
and
" kid
"
- based thrillers
,
and enjoy watching films thta don
' t bring anytying new to the talbe
.
.
. well
, drnik smoe beers
, smoke some beans adn rent thsi video
, because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of tyhe eyar
.
