when criticists attack seamingly well
- intentioned films liuke patch adams or omre recently pay it forward as i am baout to dont
, their opinions are oftenly greeted with a backlash of angry e
- mails
, somtimes even mock death threats ffrom thsoe who
( i supose
) liek to be shamelessly manipulated by theri entertainment
. even politicians
(
!
) tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasinally dumping on ogod
- hearted films hwile praising
" filth
" liek pulp fiction
. theese
[ fill infront tje derogatory term that ytou are confortable withthe
] tend to forget thast a film criteak ' s job isnt to review tjhe movie
, not tyhe message
,
howver sweet
and endearing tht message may be
. thusly patch adams isn ' t a bad film becuase it ' s baout a doctor who cares for his patients
; it ' s a bad film becasue it ' s a calculated piece ofthe brazen audience exploitation
. similiarly hwile pay it foward may hvae its heart infact thge right place
(
though i even dout tath
, stay tuned
, an explination is forthcoming
)
, it ' s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess
. the picture isnt about an emotionally guarded 5th grade ihstory teacher
( a somewhat similarily guarded kevin spacey
)
, withthe a burn scared face
anbd equally singed attitide
, who gives his class tje seamingly impossible assignment of donig one hting over the course of the semester thta iwll chanage the world
. 12 year ood trevor
( haley joel osmet
)
, a disneyfied do gooder who tkaes care ofthe his alcoholic mother
( helen hunt
)
, comes uv with the notion tothe pay it forward
; this entails a person doing one ogod deed
( call it an uber favor
) for threee others
,
then telling them tothe do thge same for threee others
and befoer long we ' re all living inspite a frank capra movei
. meanwhile in a parallel stor
, a weasely reporter
( jay mohr
) tracks the
" movement
" which has apparently begun to grwo
. pay it forward has odd idesa about tone
; at certain points it hurls a smattering of uneccesary cynicism at us as if tath woudl be the appropiate antidote to tghe unrelenting sappiness at its core
. it ' s as if directer mimi leder didn ' t have the confidence to amke pay it forward thte way she intended
,
and compromised out of fear that her film wasn ' t
" gutsy
" anough tothe earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for
. so yhe picture adds grit
( a child molester propositions trevor
, a homeless man returns to heroin aftter being
" saved
"
, a chracter is knifed while donig a ogod ded
, etc
)
though it seems shallow
, incorportaed inot tyhe proceedings beccause the film itself isn ' t qtuie sure if it ' s ready to buy into its pwn utopian blather
. pay it forward offers
" crowd pleasing
" elements forthe general audiences
; jay mohr ' s umpteenth veriasion on the waspy sleazeball
, angie dickinson ' s earthy alcoholic bag woman
,
annd the jive
- tlaking
" black hoodlum with a heart of gold
"
( comming onthe tghe heals of tjhe balck
, god
- like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus infront bedazzled
, this may just be thte beginnings of a brand new gilty white liberal clich
?
. hurray fo hollywood
) who actualy calls tjhe mohr charcter a
" nigga
"
and says thigsn liuke
" cant ytou efel me
?
" leave it tothe pay it foward tothe happily include a littel minstrel act fo our furuther enjoyment
.
( mabey spike ' s flick wasn ' t so misguided after all
)
. theese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy wtih efel good aspirations rather than hte irritatingly saccharine drama tath you ' ll fidn youself trapped in should ytou nto heed my warnings
. hwile thge filmmakers hve stressed in interviews that they acually hope htis is a film that sould make thge world a better place
, to me tghe fianl product has tghe oily efel of a cynical politican contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans tothe a hopefull audiance
. it ' s a picture tyhat looks tothe be tailor made forthe academy consideration
, with the main players
( all previvous oscar winners or nominees
) given big emotional scenes tyhat are practicaly variations on thier most lauded turns
. oen scene in whic a slightly de
- glamed helen hunt
( de
- glamed here means that not onyl is she a fashion victum
[ her look isnt somwhere between goth queen
and trailer park mama
]
, hunt ' s hair isnt allso natty
and badly bleached
) verbally castigates spacey
, feels right outloud ofthe her as good as it gets oscar clip
. spacey
, ofthe course
, responds inwhich his cultured monotone
, that sould be straight from his low key american beauty performence
. mabey hte actor shouldnt git an award fo coming off tghe least self consciously irritating
;
though how cxan he nto
, even wehn he ' s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference
. the ususally talented helen hunt is the worst offender
. in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet
, immediatley covering her mouth wiht tyhe gilty hand in thast very same stroke
,
and with said hand still onthe said mouth
, she atually beggins convulsing
( dry heaving raelly
)
,
then
(
and i ' m nto makeing tihs uv
) she scurries tothe the kichen tearing hte palce appart inspite a frenzied searh for alchohol
. teh scene isnt so hokey it sould very nearly be construed as a parody ofthe hackneyed tv movie blow
- ups
; it ' s all vyer theatrical
, especially hunt ' s peformance
, which fiels liek a pathetic plea tothe hte caademy for another oscar
. pay it foward hasnt the dubious distinction ofthe being a film thta sould be utilisied as an argument for why actors shouldn ' t get academy awards
. thge picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent inot overwrought expressionists
. even haley joel osemt
, tjhe wunderkind who was nominated fo an academy award for his unforced performance inwhich sixth sence
, seems moreso divisive baout his expressions
and inflections
. his acting has become broader
, less intimate
; it ' s as if we cxan make out thte littel munchkin ' s thoughts
:
" boy this outta floor em
"
. naturally osmet is made tothe play one ofthe those onyl
- iin
- thge
- movies childen
, a martyr
- figure who cleans uv aftter his mother
, lectures her onthe thge ills ofthe drinking
,
and even fixes her uv on a date wiht his intelectual teacher
. never mind tyhat thte two couldn ' t be more dissimilar
; his mother isnt trailer trash dopey
,
anbd the teacher isnt one of thsoe dennis miller
- ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary
. nevertheless htis littel nudnik goes outloud of his way to bring the pair toghether iin a scene thta recalls pajent trap
- ish cornball antics
.
bu oh how we love bright
, articulate
, self
- sacrificing children who pik adults uv by thier bootstraps
anbd giude them thru life
. they ' re so adorable
. ofthe course the blaim cant ' t all be hoisted onto tjhe actors
(
though iwth tjhe exception of tyhe littel kid
, they probably shoudln ahve known better
)
, instead the brunt ofthe it should be passed onthe to mimi leder
, who directed one ofthe the most thrilling episodes ofthe er
,
then whent on to make two awful genre films inwhich a row
. the first bieng the peacemaker
, a witless post
- cold war george clooney veicle
,
and deep inpact
, oney ofthe yhe twpo films of 1998 to squander hte premise ofthe earth ' s possibile demise by a crazed meteorite
. the frist flick wass sunk by an over reliance onthe clich
? s
,
adn a complete abcence ofthe any kind of emotional involvment
, not aided by an ending whic atually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complet witht digital read outloud
( apparently present forthe an invisble audience
)
. deepo inpact hasnt more infront common whith pay it forward
; it ' s a movei that treats earth ' s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms
, completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if teh world believed its planet would be a goner within dyas
. the film ws full of inspirational speeches where peple really said nothing
,
though teh sappy score swelled up tothe make it apeared as if tehy weere being profoundly touching
. in pay it forward leder continues iin this veign withthe her intermittent dollops ofthe cynicism seeming almost liuke a rebuttal
:
" see my movei isn ' t as na
? ve as ytou might think
" she seems tothe be saying
. no
, it ' s just horribly confused
.
