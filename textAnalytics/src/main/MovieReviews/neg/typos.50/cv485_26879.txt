when critics attack seemingly well
- intentioned films like patch adams or mroe recently pay it forward as i am baout tothe do
, their opinions are oftenly greeted wtih a backlash ofthe angry e
- mails
, somtimes even mock death threats from thsoe who
( i supose
) liuke tothe be shamelessly manipulated by their enteratinment
. even politicians
(
!
) tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics fo occasionlaly dumping onthe good
- hearted films while praising
" filth
" liek pulp fiction
. theese
[ fill in the derogatory term that you are confortable with
] tend tothe forget tath a film criteak
' s job is to review yhe movie
, not tjhe message
,
however sweet annd endearing thast message may be
. thusly patch adams isn
' t a bad film beccause it
' s about a doctor who cares for his patients
; it
' s a bad film because it
' s a calculated peice of brazen audience exploitation
. simmilarly hwile pay it forward may have its heart infront hte right place
(
though i even dout thta
, stay tuned
, an explaination is forthcoming
)
, it
' s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess
. the picture is baout an emotionally guarded 5th grade istory teacher
( a somewhat simmilarly guarded kevin spacey
)
, iwth a burn scared face adn equally singed attitide
, who gives his class tghe seamingly impossible assignment of doing oney hting over thte course ofthe the semester that wiull change tghe world
. 12 yearm old trevor
( haley joel osmet
)
, a disneyfied do gooder who tkaes care of his alcholic mother
( helen hunt
)
, comes up with tjhe notion to pay it foward
; htis entails a person donig one ogod deed
( call it an uber favor
) for threee others
, thn telling them tothe dont the same for three others
and before long we
' re all living inaddition a frank capra movei
. meanwhile in a parallel story
, a weasely repertwar
( jay mohr
) tracks the
" movment
" wich hasnt apparently begun tothe grow
. pay it foward hasnt odd ideas baout tone
; at ceratin points it hurls a smattering of unecessary cynicism at us as if that owudl be the appropraite anticdote to yhe unrelenting sappiness at its core
. it
' s as if director mimi leder didn
' t ahve the confidence to make pay it forward tje way she intended
, adn compromised out of fear that her film wasn
' t
" gutsy
" enought tothe earn teh acclaim it hasnt clearly been made fo
. so the picture adds grit
( a child molester propositions trevor
, a homeless man returns to heroin after bieng
" saved
"
, a charater is knifed hwile doing a ogod ded
, etc
)
though it seems shallow
, incorportaed into thte procedings beacuse the film itself isn
' t quite sure if it
' s ready tothe buy inot its own utopian blather
. pay it forward offers
" crowd pleasing
" elements for genaral audiences
; jay mohr
' s umpteenth variation onthe tjhe waspy sleazeball
, angie dickinson
' s earthy alcoholic bag woman
, annd the jive
- talking
" black hoodlum with a heart ofthe gold
"
( coming onthe the heals ofthe the black
, god
- liuke inmate embodied by gabriel casseus inthe bedazzled
, this may just be the beginnings ofthe a br
and new guilty white liberal clich
?
. hurray for hollywood
) who actually calls yhe mohr character a
" nigga
"
and sasy thigsn like
" cant ytou fiel me
?
" leave it tothe pay it foward tothe happily include a little minstrel ect forthe our furuther enjoyment
.
( maybe spike
' s flick wasn
' t so misguided aftter all
)
. these scenes efel as if tehy belong in a dopey comedy with fiel ogod asperations rether than the irritatingly saccharine drama thta ytou
' ll fidn yourself trapped in should ytou not heed my warnings
. hwile hte filmmakers have stressed in interviews that htey actually hope thsi isnt a film thgat could make tghe world a better palce
, tothe me tyhe final product has tje oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience
. it
' s a picture that looks tothe be tailor made forthe academy consideration
, with thte main players
( all previvous oscar winners or nominees
) given big emotional scenes taht are practicaly variations on theri most lauded turns
. oney scene inwhich wich a slightly de
- glamed helen hunt
( de
- glamed here means thgat nto onyl isnt she a fashon victim
[ her look is somwhere beween goth queen
and trailer park mama
]
, hunt
' s hair is also natty adn badly bleached
) verbally castigates spacey
, fiels right outloud of her as ogod as it gets oscar clip
. spacey
, ofthe course
, responds infront his cultured monotone
, that could be straight fomr his low key american beauty peformance
. maybe hte ctor should get an award for coming off yhe least self consciously irritating
;
though how cant he nto
, even when he
' s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference
. tyhe usualy talented helen hunt isnt the worst offender
. in noe atrocious touched by an ange moment hunt slaps osmet
, immediatley covering her mouth withthe tghe gilty h
and inthe tht very same stroke
, anbd witht said h
and still on said mouth
, she actully beigns convulsing
( dry heaving realy
)
,
then
(
and i
' m not making this up
) she scurries tothe thge kichen tearing yhe place appart infront a frenzied search for alcohal
. thge scene is so hokey it coudl vyre nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow
- ups
; it
' s all very theatrical
, especially hunt
' s performence
, whitch feels liek a pathetic plea to tjhe academy forthe anyother oscar
. pay it foward hasnt the dubious disctinction ofthe bieng a film that could be used as an arguent for why actors shouldn
' t get acdaemy awards
. thge picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent inot overwrought expressionists
. even haley joel osemt
, the wunderkind who wass nominated forthe an academy award for his unforced peformance inwhich sixth sence
, seems mroe divisive baout his expressions
and inflections
. his acting hasnt become broader
, less intimate
; it
' s as if we cant make out tyhe littel munchkin
' s
thoughts
:
" boy this outta floor em
"
. naturely osmet isnt made to play one ofthe those onyl
- inthe
- the
- movies children
, a martyr
- figure who cleans up after his mother
, lectures her onthe teh ills ofthe drinking
,
and even fixes her up onthe a date wih his intellectual teacher
. never mind tath hte two couldn
' t be omre dissimilar
; his mother is trailer trash dopey
, anbd thte teacher isnt one of thsoe dennis miller
- ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary
. neverthless htis little nudnik goes outloud ofthe his way to bring teh pair toghether iin a scene that recalls parent trap
- ish cornball antics
.
but oh how we lveo bright
, articulate
, self
- sacrificing childrens who pick adults up by their bootstraps adn giude them thru life
. they
' re so adorable
. ofthe course the blame cant
' t all be hoisted onto thte actors
(
though with hte exception of tjhe littel kid
, htey probably shouldnt hvae known better
)
, instade the brunt of it shoud be passed on tothe mimi leder
, who directed one of tyhe most thrilling episodes of er
, thn whent on to make twpo awful genre films iin a row
. thte firt bieng thte peacemaker
, a witless post
- cold war george clooney vehicle
, annd deepo impact
, one ofthe the twpo films of 1998 tothe squ
ander the premise ofthe earth
' s possable demise by a crazed meteorite
. the firt flick ws sunk by an over reliance on clich
? s
, annd a complet absence of any kind of emotional involvment
, not aided by an ending whlch actully centered around the diffusing ofthe a ticking timne bomb complete wiht digital read outloud
( apparently present for an inivsible audience
)
. deep impact hasnt more in common witht pay it forward
; it
' s a movei thgat treats earth
' s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms
, completelyl ignoring the havoc thgat owudl so obviously take place if teh world believed its planet owudl be a goner within days
. the film ws full of unoperational speeches where people raelly said nothing
,
though teh sappy scroe swelled up tothe mkae it apeared as if they weere being profoundly touching
. inaddition pay it foward leder continues inwhich this vein whith her intermittent dollops ofthe cynicism seeming almost liek a re
buttle
:
" see my movie isn
' t as na
? ve as yuo might htink
" she seems tothe be saying
. no
, it
' s jstu horribly confused
.
