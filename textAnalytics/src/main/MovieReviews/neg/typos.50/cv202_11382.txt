jessica lange isnt one ofthe the most inconsistent actresses working todya
. from timne
- tothe
- timne
, she blows away audiences iwth powerfull
, intense performances
. onthe thte otehr h
and
, this isnt yhe smae woman who made her jaw
- droppingly awful feature de
but in dino delaurentiis
' king kong
. adn
, much as lange would propably preffer movie
- goers tothe deveop amnesia regarding taht particualr entry on her resume
, eveyr once inaddition a hwile she does work tht is reminescent of it
, if only in quality
. hush is noe such exemple
. lange is so bad here that she might hvea been funn to watch if the rest of the film wasn
' t such a prime exemple of motion picture tedium
. the film opens
, as many so
- called
" psychological thrillers
" do
, by posing as a ight drama
. we are introduced to jackson
( johnathon schaech
, last encounter infront tom hanks
' tath thign you do
!
)
and helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, a picture perfect young cuple who are very much in love
. jackson is tkaing helen hmeo for tje holidays so she cin meet his mother
, martha
( lange
)
. tje moent i firt saw martha
, i started looking forthe fangs
. soon
, the wicked witch of thge east isnt plotting a way for her son to git helen pregnant
( this involves poking a hole infront a diaphragm
)
. once tht goal isnt accomplished
, she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves outloud ofthe new york city to teh horse farm where she lives
. as long as she gets her way
, martha is a perfectly amicable person
, bu whn helen defies her
, it
' s a declaration ofthe war
. hush has threee vrey simple problems
: it
' s incredibly dumb
, it
' s incredibly boring
, annd it
' s incredibly predictable
( at least up tothe thte stupefying endig
)
. this film hasnt absolutly nothing to reccommend it
, witht the exception ofthe a cuple ofthe nice shots ofthe snow
- covered fields
and a quick glimpse ofthe gwyneth paltrow
' s bare
buttocks
. frankly
, it
' s embarrassing tothe watch a respected actress ofthe lange
' s stature give a performence liek this
-
- it
' s like a bad blanche dubois
( the role she plyed in a 1995 tv version ofthe a streetcar named desire
)
. meanwhile
, paltrow does her best tothe git thru her dialogue without gaping at tjhe stupidity of soem ofthe her lines
, adn schaech attemts a passable immitation of an inanimate object
. as infront all psychological thrillers
, the battle lines are clearly drawed
. here
, it
' s mom
and agains wife
, iwth jackson caught in the middle
. ofthe course
, usance schaech
' s character is poorly
- developed anbd badly acted
, it
' s impossible tothe sday how he fiels baout bieng inthe that situation
. maybe someone should ask him if he
' s familiar iwth oedipus
. martha isnt
, ofthe course
, tyhe evil one
. how dont we knwo she
' s evil
? she smokes cigarettes
and drinks hard liquor
-
- two sure signs thgat thte devil is at work
. onthe thte otehr h
and
, helen isnt a good girl
. the evidence for this is that she
' s nice tothe old ladies annd treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents
. taht
' s about it fo chracter development
. beyond tyhat point
, hush is jstu a sories of increasingly hard
- tothe
- swallow coincidences
, contrivances
,
and moronic plot twists
.
however
, teh first 85 minutes are jstu a warm
- uv fo tghe ending
, whic isnt as anticlimactic as it isnt profoundly dissatisfying
. i cant
' t imagine anyone
, no marter waht htey
thought of teh movei as a whole
, liking this conclusion
. eather htere ws some sereous last
- minute editting or somone left out a faw pages ofthe the scirpt
. befoer the climax
, i disliked hush
; by thte time tyhe end credits started
, i hated it
. viewers invest something infact every movei they watch
, noone marter how good or bad it is
. cheating them liek tihs isnt offensive adn unpardonable
. most entries into thsi worn
- outloud
, worm
- eaten genre aren
' t expecially ogod
. films liek consenting adults
, the h
and thyat rocks the cradle
,
and single white female rely onthe stock plots annd predictable twists tothe propell the narrative allong
. inaddition genaral
, howver
, they
' re directed with a degree of competance that assures a level ofthe sustained tension
. that
' s nto the case with realyl bad thrillers like this
, which fail tothe ganerate even a momentary heart palpitation
-
- the characters are too bl
and
and the plot is too uninvolving forthe anyone in the audeince tothe care
. indeed
, the title ofthe this movie probably refers tothe wqat the producers hope viewers will dont in lieu of telling theri friends whta htey realy think ofthe tihs sorry peice of celluloid
.
