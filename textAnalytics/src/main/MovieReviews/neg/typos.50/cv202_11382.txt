jessica lange is oney of tje most inconsistent actresses working todya
. fomr tyme
- tothe
- time
, she blows away audiences wih powerful
, intense performances
. on the other hand
, tihs isnt the same woman who made her jaw
- droppingly awful feature debut inthe dino delaurentiis ' king kong
.
adn
, much as lange owudl probably preferr movei
- goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume
, every once infact a hwile she does wrok that isnt reminiscent of it
, if onyl infact qualiyt
. hush isnt one such example
. lange is so bad here that she might have been funn tothe watch if tje rest ofthe tghe film wasn ' t such a prime example ofthe motion picture tedium
. the film opens
, as many so
- called
" pyschological thrillers
" dont
, by posing as a light drama
. we are introduced to jackson
( johnathon schaech
, last encounter in tom hanks ' that thnig you do
!
)
adn helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, a picture perfect young cuple who are vrey much in loev
. jackson isnt tkaing helen hmeo fo the holidays so she can meet his mother
, martha
( lange
)
. the moment i first saw martha
, i started looking for fangs
. soon
, the wicked witch ofthe the east isnt plotting a way forthe her son to git helen pregnant
( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm
)
. once that gool isnt acomplished
, she manipulates events so tath hte expecting couple moves out of newyorker york city tothe the horse farm where she lives
. as long as she gets her way
, martha isnt a perfectly amicable person
,
but wehn helen defies her
, it ' s a declaration of war
. hush has threee vyer simple problems
: it ' s incredibly dumb
, it ' s incredibly boring
,
and it ' s incredibly predictable
( at least up tothe teh stupefying endig
)
. this film has absolutly nothing to recommend it
, with the exception ofthe a cuple ofthe nice shots ofthe snow
- covered fields
adn a quick glimpse ofthe gwyneth paltrow ' s bare buttocks
. frankly
, it ' s embarrassing to watch a respected actress ofthe lange ' s stature give a performance liek htis
-
- it ' s liuke a bad blanche dubois
( tje role she played inwhich a 1995 tv version ofthe a streetcar named desire
)
. meanwhile
, paltrow does her best tothe git through her dialogue wihtout gaping at tje stupidity of some of her lines
,
and schaech attemts a passable immitation of an inanimate object
. as in all psychological thrillers
, the battle lines are claerly drawn
. here
, it ' s mom
annd against wief
, withthe jackson caught inwhich tghe middle
. of course
, since schaech ' s charactor is poorly
- devolopped
anbd badly acted
, it ' s impossible to say how he feels about bieng in that situation
. maybee somene shouldnt ask him if he ' s familiar wtih oedipus
. martha is
, ofthe course
, the evil oney
. how dont we know she ' s evil
? she smokes cigarettes
adn drinks hard liquor
-
- two sure signs thast the devil is at owrk
. onthe the otehr hand
, helen is a good girl
. tghe evidence forthe htis isnt tyhat she ' s nice tothe ood ladies
and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents
. tht ' s about it for chracter development
. beyond that point
, hush is jstu a sories ofthe increasingly hard
- tothe
- swallow coincidences
, contrivances
,
annd moronic plot twists
.
howver
, the first 85 mintues are just a warm
- uv forthe thge ending
, whlch isnt as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying
. i can ' t imagine anyone
, noone marter waht they thougth of tyhe movie as a wohle
, liking this conclusion
. eather there ws smoe sereous lastest
- minute editting or someone left outloud a faw pages ofthe thge scirpt
. befoer the climax
, i disliked hush
; by hte time the end credits started
, i hated it
. viewers invest something inspite every movei tehy watch
, noone matter how ogod or bad it isnt
. cheating them liuke this isnt offensive
and unpardonable
. most entries inot this worn
- outloud
, worm
- eaten genre aren ' t especialy ogod
. films like consenting adults
, tjhe hand thyat rocks tghe cradle
,
and single white female rely on stock plots
adn predictable twists to propel the narrative along
. in genaral
,
howver
, they ' re directed with a degree of competance tyhat assures a levle ofthe sustained tension
. that ' s not tje case with really bad thrillers liek thsi
, whitch fail tothe generate even a momentary heart palpitation
-
- tje cahracters are too bland
anbd tjhe plot is too uninvolving forthe anyone inthe tyhe audeince to care
. indeed
, the title of this movie probably refers tothe what thte producers hope viewers will dont inspite lieu ofthe telling theri firends waht tehy really think of thsi sorry peice of celluloid
.
