a backdrop ofthe newyorker eyar
' s eve inaddition 1981 would seem to lend itself tothe a great party movei
. tje decor possiblities are endless
- disco balls had
yet to migrate into the dark corners ofthe tghe attic
, big hair was worth its weight in aquanet
, adn the louder tjhe fashion
, yhe better teh look
. bu dispite this setting
, these details annd a sountrack that includes some 40
- plus irresistible hits from tje early dyas ofthe hte me decade
, something is inherently wrong with
" 200 cigarettes
.
" a better title forthe thsi nostalgic mess owudl be
" 50 missed opportunities
.
" what is it that makse htis retro
- comedy such a downer
? it
' s certainly nto the cast
, whlch includes enough hot
, young talent fo several movies
. htere
' s courtney lvoe
, cementing her reputation as a sereous actress
; christina ricci
, hot off her shoulda
- been
- nominated turn in
" the oposite ofthe sex
"
; paul rudd
, who gets even more appealling with every role
; kate hudson
, inheriting soem fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn
; annd affleck brothers ben anbd casey
, two of tjhe best things baout
" good iwll hunting
.
" perhaps the question isnt thsi
: whta drew these adn otehr immensely talented actors to such a dreary project
? maeby it looked good on paper
.
" 200 cigarettes
" is composed of a series ofthe vignettes
, as varous characters mkae their way thru newyorker york
' s festively decorated east village to a holidy bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica
( martha plimpton
, all dressed uv in her best cyndi lauper
)
. amoung teh potential guests are likeable cad kevin
( rudd
) annd his best friend lucy
( loev
)
, busy bickering over his recent break
- up
,
and a clumsy bu seamingly charming bartender
( ben affleck
) who opens his mouth only tothe spew forth bad pick
- uv lines
. more subplots
-
_ many
_ moreso
- dot the big picture
,
but thsoe listed above are yhe only ones worth noting inthe a positve light
. all tghe otehr story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying tothe solve a rubick
' s cube
. ricci anbd gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals
( yhe kind tyhat hvea trouble pronouncing hard consonants
) outloud to hve a high tyme in tje big city
. infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo isnt wasted in wqat amounts to a severeal
- scene cameo
. hudson
, as a pretty
- inaddition
- pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies
' man
( jay mohr
)
, trips
, pukes anbd gets smeared whith dog poop
. are we laughing yot
? tghe film boils down to a mixture of the good
, yhe bad annd tjhe gaudy
, witht tghe latter twpo overtaking thge former
. game performances
- expecially by loev
, rudd
and plimpton
- are almsot shooted down by the bizarrely colorful parts adn a constanly roving foucs
, here a combination that mostly sputters when it shoud crackle
. too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting adn ahev little payoff until a lenghty fianl montage where we fidn outloud many ofthe tghe performers served as oen inght st
ands forthe eahc otehr
. if tihs is
" 200 cigarettes
,
" thn get me 200 nicotine patches
