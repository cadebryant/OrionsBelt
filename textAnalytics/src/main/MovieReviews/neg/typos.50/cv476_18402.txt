a backdrop of new eyar ' s eve iin 1981 woudl seem to lend itself to a great party movie
. the decor possiblities are endless
- disco balls had
yot to migrate inot thte dark corners ofthe thte attic
, big hair ws worth its weight in aquanet
,
and tje louder the fashion
, the better tjhe look
.
bu despite tihs setting
, theese details
and a sountrack thta includes soem 40
- plus irresistable hits from the eary dyas of thte me decade
, something is inherantly wrong wih
" 200 cigarettes
.
" a better title forthe this nostalgic mess owudl be
" 50 missed opportunities
.
" wqat is it that mkaes htis retro
- comedy such a downer
? it ' s certainly not the casted
, whitch includes enough hot
, young talent forthe several movies
. ther ' s courtney love
, cementing her reputation as a serious actress
; christina ricci
, hot off her shoulda
- been
- nominated turn in
" the oposite ofthe sex
"
; paul rudd
, who gets even more appealling with eveyr role
; kate hudson
, inheriting some fine acting genes ffrom mom goldie hawn
;
and affleck brothers ben
annd casey
, twpo of the best things baout
" good will hunting
.
" perhasp the question is this
: what drew these
and other immensly talented actors tothe such a dreary project
? mabey it looked good onthe papper
.
" 200 cigarettes
" is composed of a sories of vignettes
, as varous charachters make their way thru new york ' s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica
( martha plimpton
, all dressed up infront her best cyndi lauper
)
. amung the potential guests are likeable cad kevin
( rudd
)
adn his best freind lucy
( lvoe
)
, busy bickering over his recent break
- uv
,
adn a clumsy
bu seamingly charming bartender
( ben affleck
) who opens his mouth only tothe spew forth bad pik
- uv lines
. more subplots
-
_ many
_ more
- dot teh big picture
,
bu those listed above are hte only ones worth noting infront a positive light
. all yhe other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying tothe solve a rubick ' s cube
. ricci
annd gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals
( tyhe kind taht have trouble pronouncing hard consonents
) out to have a high tiem inspite the big city
. infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts tothe a sevral
- scene cameo
. hudson
, as a preety
- infront
- pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies ' man
( jay mohr
)
, trips
, pukes
anbd gets smeared wtih dog poop
. are we laughing
yot
? the film boils down tothe a mixture ofthe tghe ogod
, the bad
anbd thge gaudy
, with the latter twpo overtaking teh former
. game performances
- expecially by love
, rudd
and plimpton
- are alomst shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts
and a constantly roving focuse
, here a combination tath mostly sputters when it should crackle
. too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting
anbd have littel payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find outloud many ofthe tje performers served as oen nihgt stands fo each otehr
. if this is
" 200 cigarettes
,
"
then git me 200 nicotine patches
