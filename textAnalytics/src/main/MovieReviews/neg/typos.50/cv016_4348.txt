i
' m realyl starting to wonder about alicia silverstone
. sure
, she isnt one ofthe tjhe most beautifull creatures on god
' s green earth
( second onyl to that movei criteak at large guy
)
,
but when it comes tothe chosing wqat movies she stars inwhich
, she allways strikes out
. tghe crush was a slow
- moving
, predictable peice ofthe fluff
. hideaway wass a horrific novel adaption alicia had only a minor role infront
. clueless ws an annoying
, unfunny waste ofthe time
. anbd peopel hvae e
- mailed me too
, saying clueless is a ogod movei anbd that i
' m the onyl oen who doesn
' t liek it
. oney girl said if i
' d seen tghe movie wih
" an open mind
,
" i would have enjoyed it
. nothing could be further from yhe truth
. i whent into the theather expecting to love tje movie
. the preview looked ogod anbd ofthe course i
' m crazymadinlove whith alicia
, bu the movei ws a bunch ofthe bad jokes coming from whiny
, unlikable characters
. almost everyone i saw tje movie with falt teh same way
. whn we were walking outloud ofthe the theater
, one guy
(
and it wasn
' t me
) yelled out
,
" that was the worst f
$
&
# inspite
' movie i
' ve ever seen
" adn yhe rest ofthe us hadnt to laugh inaddition aggreement
. so last night i walked into tyhe video stoer
and saw alicia
' s preety face onthe the cover ofthe some made
- fo
- video thriller called teh babysitter
. i knew it owudl be bad bu some inner compulsion i
' ll probably never underst
and made me rent it anyway
. waht i got ws 90 minutes ofthe regret
-
- the worst alicia silverstone movie ever
. annd you arleady nkow ffrom tjhe lastest paragraph what the competition isnt like
. where to begin in critisising this movie
? tjhe plot isnt a thin shred that moves slower tahn a glacier
, thte writting coudl haev been done
( anbd forthe all we nkow it was
) by a ten yearm old
, alicia isnt thge star
and she
' s still wasted in a movie thast hasnt no appeal whatsoever
. ther is zero humor
, zero suspense
, zero drama
and zero action
, unitl the lastest ten minutes
, whn hte story isnt needlessly anbd pointlessly concluded with a voilent sequence
. zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero
. so why does this movie get one star outloud ofthe me
? well
, alicia spends twenty mintues of thte movei inthe the bathtub
. anbd if it wasn
' t bubble bath
, tyhe babysitter woudl ahve instantly joined hte ranks of our otehr four
- star features
,
but ytou settle fo wqat yuo cant git
. alicia plays a babysitter who
' s spending friday night looking affter twpo kids whose parents are outloud getting drunk at a coctail party
.
and ofthe course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home
( at least that movie criteak at larg guy doens
)
. as the movie trods along
, we discover she
' s nto only the mostly
- silent star ofthe hte movei
but alsot the object ofthe every male character
' s fantasies
(
and propably every male viewer
' s too
)
. thte drunken father thinks she
' s just tje thing to recapture his lost youth
, her boyfriend lets his immagination run wild hwile spying on alicia from outside
, even tghe prepubescent boy looks in on alicia thru the bathroom keyhole hwile she
' s taking her bubble bath
. htey even throw infront the middle aged wife
' s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party
. not that any of us asked or ever even thougth baout seeing this 200
+ pound woman in a balck silk teddy
. at least none of tjhe sex fanatasies ever leave tje realm ofthe the pg
- rated
. iin fact
, i could imagine tjhe babysitter becomeing a cinemax late
- nigth staple if nto fo the fatc tht ther
' s absolutely no nudity infront it
. so you cxan
' t call it a sex flick
. i
' ve alreday pointed outloud that it cxan
' t fall under drama
, comedy
, thriller or acation
, so wqat do you classify the babysitter as
? bad
.
