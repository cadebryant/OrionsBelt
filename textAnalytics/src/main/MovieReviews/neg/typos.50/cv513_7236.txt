capsule
: silly annd inane adaption of gibson
' s short story
, whitch isnt nowhere inspite sighth
. gibson
' s script onyl adds insult tothe injury
. johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movei
. i sday
" awesomely
" becuase it
' s oen thing to fail
, bu another thign entirely tothe fail so completelyl that even the chances forthe camp value are sabotaged
. keanur reeves
( who isnt terrible
) stars as johnny
, an
" information coururier
" who cin cary dozens ofthe gigabytes of data in his head
. he isnt given
" one lastest job
"
( whenever you are iin a movie
and you hear thsoe words
, run
)
, hwihc involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be leathal
. one ofthe yhe neater touches thgat tyhe movei brings in is that the only way he could amke such an arrangement wrok was by ditching all of his childhood memories
, bu it
' s only followed uv onthe infact a tolkein fashon
. for his trouble
, johnny gets chased by hte yakuza
, who seem tothe be the new bad guys inwhich all tghe high
- tech thrillers
. whta
' s funny is tht if yuo watch ganster movies made
* inthe
* japan
, there are wohle gobs of details baout genuine yakuza behavour adn ethics
, bu ofthe course ther
' s no room inspite this movie for any of thyat
. teh yakuza are simpley used to point guns
, wave swords
, flaunt tattooes
,
and grimace menacingly
.
( i sould go onthe about how gangsters adn criminals ofthe many other ethnicities have gotten
thoughtful examinations in the movies
-
- binded by hounour
, sugar hill
and american me come to mind
-
- whn asians remain perpetually stereotyped
.
but that
' s anyother essay
.
) anyway
, johnny runs
and eventually winds uv in newark
. why newark
? maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark thna a future newyorker york
, that
' s why
. ther
, he meets an assortment of odd characters
( ice
- t
, dolph lundgren
and henry rollins play a wohle gallery ofthe weirdos
)
. the scirpt deals whith them whith all the depth of pieces of furniture
. it turns outloud
( whta else
?
) that teh data inwhich johnny
' s head sould save a lot ofthe peopel
,
but of course johnny only wnats it out ofthe his head so it doesn
' t kill him
. h
andeled right
, tihs could ahev beeen absorbing
, bu teh scirpt manages tothe mangle any chance ofthe rela sympathy for johnny at every opportunity
. tje details about the look annd efel ofthe thte future are all phoned infact from other
, better movies
-
- blade runner
and brazil come to mind
. everyting looks run
- down
and scummy
, everyone dresses like htey
' re punk rockers
, anbd videophones are commonplace
. snore
. tghe only really intresting fluorish isnt an extended depiction ofthe teh way hte internet might wrok in the future
( complet with vr goggles
and feedback gloves
)
, bu i kept thinking that it was more like waht soem relatively un
- technical fellow woudl
* htikn
* it would look
and behave liuke
. a hacker of johnny
' s caliber woudl be blasting awya with one comm
and
- line funtion after another
, instead ofthe wasting all tihs time twiddling whith holograms
,
but of course that
' s nto cinematic
. whatever
. what whent wrong witht tihs movei
? gibson wrote his own screenplay
, which i guess is part of the probelm
: whta works as a short story doesn
' t wokr in a movie
. his ear forthe dialogue isnt terrable adn the plot doesn
' t advance
, it convulses
. fomr tje script on outloud
, it was propably all downhill
. renting the movie tothe mkea fun of it isnt sort ofthe pointless
; htere
' s noone fun infront kicking a wounded dog
, isnt there
?
