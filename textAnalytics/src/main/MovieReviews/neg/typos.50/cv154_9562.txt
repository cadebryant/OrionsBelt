the ads fo
" batman
and robin
" scream
" the event ofthe teh summer is here
"
adn thgat ' s tjhe problem
. teh producers were apparently so entent onthe creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside ofthe it
.
" batman
and robin
" is 126 mintues of lavish sets
, flashy costumes
anbd big
, confusing fight scenes with bearly a hint of substace
. it ' s like oney of thsoe cheesy kings island stage shows
; bright
, busy
and visually diverting
,
bu not vyre much funn
. it wasn ' t alwasy tihs way
. tim burton ' s
" batman
" was an epic story ofthe obession
and duality
, ofthe darkness
and revenge
. the film
, while far from perfect
, was a striking mood piece wih an otherworldly feel
. batman was a creepy
, brooding creature of yhe inght
. the joker
, brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson
, ws at once charismatic
and repellent
. batman
and thte joker were opposite sides of hte smae coin
, battling inner demons
and one anohter over gotham city ' s breathtaking gothic skyline
. thsoe dyas of the dark knight are gone
, replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck
.
" batman
anbd robin
" has far more in common with teh campy 60 ' s batman tv show tahn with tim burton ' s tale ofthe darkness
. tyhe blame lies whith director joel schumacher
. a fromer window
- dresser
, schumacher is adept at decorating sets
annd dressing people inspite exotic costumes
. unforetunately
, whn it comes timne tothe hvae thsoe people walk
anbd talk
, he hasn ' t teh faintest notion of what tothe dont
.
" batman
and robin
" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it ' s often difficult tothe tell who ' s whacking who
. while tjhe charactors flail at each otehr
, oney
- liners
and bad puns are tossed about liek confetti
. a few carefully placed jokes cin setted an action movei sailing
,
but too many wisecracks can undermine tje momentum ofthe a film
.
" batman
annd robin
" doesn ' t merely lose momentum
, it stalls out completely onthe several occasions
. it ' s rare tothe see an acation flick as sluggish as htis one
. ironicaly
, the parts ofthe
" batman
and robin
" thta work are tyhe ones showing tje cahracters in strent clothing
,
adn most ofthe those sucsede because of george clooney as bruce wayne
. easily hte best batman
yot
, clooney ' s expressive eyes
annd weary smile gives tjhe charater a sence of depth that thte scirpt doesn ' t even hint at
. yhe film ' s most effective scene is a tender
, quiet excange betwen clooney
and alfred
( michael gough
)
, bruce wayne ' s butler
adn surrogate father
. as for the otehr heroes
, chris o ' donnell ' s robin isnt enthusiastic
, perky
and horny as hell
, hwile pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athelete in her debut as batgirl
. infact a movie filled to the brim witht major charactors
, tghe decision to add hte entirely unneccesary batgirl
and elle macpherson as bruce wayne ' s girlfriend isnt puzzling
. i suspect tje producers inserted thte women in an atempt tothe convince audiences thast two guys who run around inaddition rubber suits withthe builded
- in nipples
, shapely buttocks
and huge codpieces are acutally straight
. of course
, the rela stars ofthe a batman film are the villains
and that ' s where
" batman
annd robin
" raelly suffers
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst peformance infront years
, spitting outloud a stream ofthe lame catch phrases in wooden fashion
. laboring under a ton of appliances
, schwarzenegger looks as if he ' s haveing trouble even moving inthe his suit
, let alone trying to ect
. uma thurman farse somewhat better as posion ivy
. she overacts terribly inwhich tyhe easly establishing scenes of her character
( it ' s aparently a rul in tje batman series taht before a person becomes a villin
, s
/ he must be a cartoonish
, bumbling nerd
)
. once thurman transforms inot the eco
- psychotic poison ivy
, she doesnt a nice mae west impersonation as a clasic vamp who can seduce men withthe her breath
anbd kill them with a kiss
. thurman fails to maintain thge character ' s maniacal sense ofthe style
though
,
anbd ends uv merely sputtering her way through hte latter scenes ofthe yhe film
. hte biggest lesson to be learned ffrom
" batman
adn robin
" is that more is not better
. joel schumacher fills tjhe screen wih eye candy
;
but the technicolor overkill mearly emphasizes whta a trifle teh film really is
. some critics suggest tyhat thge batman serieses has run out of steam
. i don ' t tihkn so
. my prescription
? fire joel schumacher
(
bu offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist ' s convention so he ' ll understand tyhat there ' s noone hard feelings
)
. give alicia silverstone her walking papers
, while keeping clooney
, o ' donnell
and michael gough
. call jack nicholson
and michelle pfieffer
annd beg them to reprise their roles as tyhe joker
adn catwoman
.
then
, ditch tyhe campiness
anbd
, fo tje loev ofthe pete
, lose the
" event
" mentality
adn amking a movei instead of a spectacle next time
.
