" batman annd robin
" isnt 126 minutes ofthe lavish sets
, flashy costumes anbd big
, confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substace
. it
' s liek one ofthe those cheesy kings isl

' s
" batman
" ws an epic tsory ofthe obession adn duality
, ofthe darkness adn revenge
. hte film
, while far ffrom perfect
, wass a striking mood peice with an otherworldly efel
. batman was a creepy
, brooding creature ofthe thge night
. thte joker
, brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson
, was at once charismatic
and repellent
. batman annd the joker were opposite sides ofthe thte same coni
, battling inner demons anbd oney another over gotham city
' s breathtaking gothic skyline
. thsoe days ofthe tyhe dark knight are gone
, replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck
.
" batman
and robin
" has far omre inspite common whith hte campy 60
' s batman tv show thna wiht tim burton
' s tale ofthe darkness
. thte blaim lies witht directer joel schumacher
. a fromer window
- dresser
, schumacher isnt adept at decorating sets
and dressing people inwhich exotic costumes
. unfortunately
, when it comes time to haev thsoe peopel walk adn talk
, he hasn
' t hte faintest notion ofthe what tothe dont
.
" batman annd robin
" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it
' s oftenly difficult tothe tell who
' s whacking who
. while the cahracters flail at each otehr
, one
- liners adn bad puns are tossed baout like confetti
. a fewd carefully placed jokes cxan set an acation movei sailing
, bu too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum ofthe a film
.
" batman adn robin
" doesn
' t mearly loose momentum
, it stalls out completely on several occasions
. it
' s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as thsi noe
. ironically
, the parts ofthe
" batman adn robin
" that work are the ones showing the charachters in street clothing
, annd most ofthe thsoe succeed beacuse of george clooney as bruce wayne
. easily the best batman yot
, clooney
' s expressive eyes
and weary smile gives tyhe charachter a sense ofthe depth that the script doesn
' t even hint at
. thge film
' s most effective scene isnt a tender
, quiet excange beetwen clooney anbd alfred
( michael gough
)
, bruce wayne
' s
butler anbd surrogate father
. as forthe hte other heroe
, chris o
' donnell
' s robin is enthusiatic
, perky
and horny as hell
, while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athelete in her de
but as batgirl
. inwhich a movei filled to hte brim with major cahracters
, the descision to add thte entirely unnecessary batgirl annd elle macpherson as bruce wayne
' s girlfriend is puzzling
. i suspect tjhe producers inserted tghe womens iin an attemt tothe convince audiences tath twpo guys who run arround infront rubber suits with builded
- infact nipples
, shapely
buttocks
and huge codpieces are actully straight
. of course
, the rela stars ofthe a batman film are tyhe villains
and that
' s where
" batman annd robin
" raelly suffers
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performence infront years
, spitting outloud a stream ofthe lame catch phrases in wooden fashion
. laboring under a ton of appliances
, schwarzenegger looks as if he
' s having trouble even moving in his suit
, let alone trying tothe act
. uma thurman farse somewhat better as posion ivy
. she overacts terribly infact the eearly establising scenes of her character
( it
' s apparently a urle in tyhe batman serieses taht before a person becomes a villain
, s
/ he must be a cartoonish
, bumbling nerd
)
. once thurman transforms into the eco
- psychotic poisin ivy
, she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who cin seduce men with her breath
and kill them iwth a kiss
. thurman fails to mantain the carachter
' s maniacal sense of sytle
though
, anbd ends uv merely sputtering her way thru the latter scenes ofthe tje film
. the biggest lesson tothe be learned from
" batman
and robin
" is that moreso isnt nto better
. joel schumacher fills hte screen wiht eye c
andy
; bu the technicolor overkill mearly emphasizes what a trifle the film realyl is
. some critics suggest that the batman series has run outloud of steam
. i don
' t think so
. my prescription
? fier joel schumacher
(
but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist
' s convention so he
' ll underst
and that there
' s no hard feelings
)
. give alicia silverstone her walking papers
, hwile keeping clooney
, o
' donnell anbd michael gough
. call jack nicholson
and michelle pfieffer annd beg them to reprize theri roles as the joker
and catwoman
.
then
, ditch the campiness
and
, for the love of pete
, lose yhe
" event
" mentality
and make a movei instade of a spectacle next tiome
