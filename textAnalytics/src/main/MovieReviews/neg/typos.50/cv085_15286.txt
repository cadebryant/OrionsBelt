it
' s nowe yhe anniversary of the slayings of julie james
'
( jennifer lveo hewitt
) best firends
. still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all
, she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown
. she cant
' t concentate on her schoolwork
, cin
' t get a good night
' s sleep
, adn isnt even frightened by tjhe shadows
and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club
. everywhere she looks
, she sees visions ofthe tjhe man in a rubber slicker witht tyhe hook on his h
and
. in teh firt movie
,
` i know waht you did last summer
'
, julie
and threee of her friends accidentally kill a man
, running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway
. tothe cover thier misdeed
, htey dum teh body into the ocean
.
however
, he never quite died
and retured to hunt down julie
and her firends
. julie annd one otehr
, ravy
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, survived only to make this dismal sequal
. needing soem desparate rest annd relaxation
, she is elated tothe leran that her college roomate
, karla
( br
andy
)
, hasnt won a trip fo four tothe a secluded tropical isl
and
. accompanying these two girls are karla
' s overbearing boyfriend
, tyrell
( mehki phifer
)
and a potential beau for julie
. bu was this contest too good tothe be true
? tyhe resort is filled wih a skeleton staff that seemed like lvoe boat rejects
. meanwhile
, tje hotel isnt practicaly deserted as the storm season is about tothe begin
. this presumably creates a venue where they iwll be secluded anbd iwll haev noone possibile means off the isl
and
. eventally
, they iwll be hunted down durring power outages annd chased around during intense ightning storms
. as you might have guessed
, somwhere inthe tghe shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure thta isnt wearing a rubber slicker
and wielding a hook
. julie tries to convince her friends thyat the killer isnt on teh isl
and
( an eerie touch isnt when she isnt singing
" i will survive
" at the karaoke bar anbd the words scoll
" i still know
.
.
.
"
)
, bu her firends chalk it up tothe paranoya
.
but tje body count soon starts to rise
,
and for julie
, it
' s gogin to be teh worst vacation of her life
. the funny
( yes
, i used the owrd
' funny
'
) thign baout htis movie is that i heared more chortling
and giggling
( maybe it was my giggling
) than i heared screaming
. thsi movie boils down to a mindless slashfest thta never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness
. ther isn
' t even any suspense that leads up tothe the deaths
. here
' s an apropriate exmaple
. knock
- knock
.
" housekeeping
"
, syas hte diminuitive cleaning lady
. the door suddenly opens up
. slash
. enxt victim
! isnt ther any reason tothe go
and see this movie
? not unless yuo watn tothe see four uninteresting coleeg kids run around iin circles for about 90 minutes
.
but i do whant to sday noe hting about tihs movei that satisfied me
. i ws thouroughly irritated with tyrell
, who incessantly ranted
and raved baout his sexual libido
. i secretly wished forthe him tothe get filleted
. did he git
' hooked
'
? well
, let
' s just sday that if he didn
' t
, i would give tihs film a grade ofthe
" d
"
.
