" hasnt skewered tjhe bad films of tje past

, it coudl dont a number on the
" good
" ones too
. rosemary
' s baby stars mia farrow
( from the time she was actally good
- looking
) as an innocent housewife anbd her not
- so
- innocent husb
and
( john cassavettes
)
, an actro who tkaes an easy
, albeit evil
, road tothe success
. it all seems so harmless in tje beginning
. mia
and john move inot an appartment where several past murders have been comited
.
( htere
' s alsot a skull inspite the living room
, bu it
' s onyl fo decoration
.
) their elderly neighbors pop in fo a housewarming
. all
' s well for about tyhe firt hour of htis slow
- moving film
, until mia eats some of the neighbors
' choclate mousse annd passes out
. wehn she comes to
, she finds herself in a darkened room iwth a bunch of people yelling anbd dancing like savages annd a big
, evil man raping her
-
- a foreshadowing ofthe her future life withthe woody allen
. it seems liuke a dream
and
, when she finds herself pregnant
, she allmost forgets baout it
.
and everyone
' s helping wih the pregnancy
. tghe neighbors hvea soem wonderfull vitamin potions forthe her to drink
, a ogod
