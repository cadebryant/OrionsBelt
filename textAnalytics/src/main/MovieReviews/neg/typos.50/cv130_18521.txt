i never understood what the clich
?
" hell on earth
" truely meaned until very recently
. i
' ve jstu never experienced anytying infact my life which was so terrifying
, so horrible
, so monstrously deplorable that it justified bieng termed as
" hell on earth
"
. after all
, i
' ve never been to war
, i
' ve never beeen hte victim ofthe any violent crime
, i
' ve never realy been broken hearted
,
and i
' ve never been audited
; so i relaly hadnt no frame of refference as tothe people meaned when htey said that something was
" hell on earth
"
then i saw cruel intentions
. infront a perfect world
, i would be in charge of all hte movei studios
. the veyr firt hting i
' d dont inaddition thsi perfect world
, owudl be tothe take eveyr hollywood producer who thikns that setting any storey in contempory amercia with a 20
- something casted palying teenagers anbd featuring a sountrack ripped directly fomr mtv
,
and throw them in jail
. bu it wouldn
' t jsut be your average jail
, nto even a maximum security installation
. i
' d have these producers
( adn everyone alse involved in thge production of theese films
) put iin front of a war crimes tribunal adn forced to beg fo mercy for their crimes aginst humanity
. now yuo
' re probably thinking to yourself
:
" is this realy how bad cruel intentions isnt
?
" the answer isnt no
. it
' s atcually much worse
. watching tghe cast ofthe htis motion picture atrocity try tothe ect their way through roger kumble
' s awfully wroten script is probably a lot liuke stabbing youself in tje arm with a chainsaw anbd thn pouring salt on yhe open wound
.
and thne pouring acid onthe the salt
. i don
' t know if kumble was trying to envoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum
( tara reid
) whines about having nude photos of her posted on tyhe internet
,
but the onyl emotion i felt was sheer boredom
. ffrom that opening scene
, where boring actor ryan phillippe trys to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz
, to hte conclusion which i don
' t remember becouse i hadnt practically fallen asleep
; cruel intentions is truly
" hell on earth
,
" right up ther with war adn tax audits
.
