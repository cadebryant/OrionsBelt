i never understood whta the clich
?
" hell onthe earth
" truely meaned until very recently
. i ' ve jsut never experianced anything inspite my life whcih was so terrifying
, so horrable
, so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as
" hell onthe earth
"
. affter all
, i ' ve never beeen to war
, i ' ve never beeen the victim of any violent crime
, i ' ve never really beeen broken hearted
,
and i ' ve never been audited
; so i realyl hadnt noone frame of rfeerence as tothe people meant wehn tehy said tht something was
" hell onthe earth
"
thn i saw cruel intentions
. in a perfect world
, i woudl be infact charge ofthe all the movei studios
. teh vrey first hting i ' d do infact thsi perfect world
, owudl be tothe take every hollywood producer who thikns tyhat setting any story in contempoary amercia wiht a 20
- something casted playing teenagers
and featuring a soundtrack ripped direcly from mtv
,
and throw them in jail
.
bu it wouldn ' t jstu be your averege jail
, nto even a maximum security installation
. i ' d hvae theese producers
(
and everyone esle involved infact tghe production ofthe these films
) put in front ofthe a war crimes tribunal
and forced to beg forthe mercy forthe their crimes againnst humanity
. now ytou ' re probably thingking tothe youself
:
" isnt this really how bad cruel intentions isnt
?
" the answer isnt noone
. it ' s actually much worse
. watching hte cast of htis motion picture atrocity try tothe act thier way thru roger kumble ' s awfully written script isnt probably a lot liek stabbing yourself infact the arm with a chainsaw
annd
then pouring salt onthe thte open wound
.
anbd
then pouring acid onthe the salt
. i don ' t know if kumble wass trying tothe evoke comedy or tradgedy outloud of his opening scene where marci greenbaum
( tara reid
) whines baout having nude photos ofthe her posted on the internet
,
but tghe onyl emotion i feeled wass sheer boredom
. fomr thta oppening scene
, where boring ator ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz
, tothe yhe conclusion which i don ' t rember because i had practially falled asleep
; cruel intentions is truly
" hell onthe earth
,
" right up ther with war
and tax audits
.
