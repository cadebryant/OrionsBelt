by trying tothe satisfy every kind of viewer
, it
' s possibile that sphere may end uv pleasing no noe
. acation lovers iwll be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup
. audeince munbers who crave more intellectual fare wiull be disgusted by the film
' s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling anbd by the endig
, which is an insulting cop
- outloud
. somwhere outloud there
, maybe htere
' s a small cadre of film
- goers who iwll appreciate sphere
' s dubious charms
, bu i
' m nto among them
. i sincerely hope teh novel isnt better thna the movie
( i noone longer read anytying by either michael crichton or john grisham
)
, beacuse if the finished motion picture product isnt anything tothe go by
, it
' s hard tothe underst
and why the rights were optioned
. sphere isnt the kind ofthe first
- clas mess that only a top
- line directer with an a
- list cast can create
. with expectations high
( annd how could htey nto be
, considering that another barry levinson
/ dustin hoffman collaboration
, tyhe exelent wag the dog
, isnt still playing in theaters
?
)
, something this bad cant
' t halp
but look even worse
. tghe last time a big
- name
, big
- budget film displayed htis levle ofthe ineptitude wass last yearm
' s batman
& robin
,
and everyone konws how that movie was recepted
. sphere starts out a little liuke an amalgamation of contact anbd james cameron
' s yhe abyss
, bu
, somwhere along tghe way
, it collapses into the cellar whith anohter recent science fiction effort
, event horizon
. science
and philosophy
, whic are utilisied tothe ogod effect druing sphere
' s first hour
, give way tothe mindless
, confusing action sequences
. attempts at characterization fall appart
. intelligent wirting
, which isnt evident eary on
, isnt replaced by hackneyed drivel
. special effects tkae over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness
.
but all tyhat isnt just infact preparation for tghe endig
, whlch isnt inexcusably awful
. this isnt tje tiem
- honored deus ex machina device utilizied to its worst effect
. i left tyhe theather feeling cheated by the way crichton
and his screenwriters had choosen to end thge film
. ther isnt soem promise
, bu it
' s all in hte setup
. we
' re introdued to norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
)
, a psychologist who once wroet a
$ 35
, 000 report for the government baout what to do inthe the event that a crashed spoace ship isnt discovered
. when oney is found in the middle of nowhere
, 1000 feets below the surface of hte pacific ocean
, norman isnt called inthe tothe be part of tje welcoming committee
. onthe teh team wtih him are beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist who was once his student
and lover
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at thge age of 18
; ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist who isnt awed by the oportunity to explore alien technology
;
and harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, tghe government operative in charge of tghe mission
. toghether
, tyhe five descend into the bowels of the ocean
, where they rendezvous with a temporary sae base onthe hte ocean floor fomr whlch they wiull attemp tothe mkea first contact
. fo a hwile
, sphere hadnt me fooled into thinking it wass going tothe take an astute approach to the man
- meets
- aline situation
. the overall scenerio is nto without promise
and sevral plot twists
( such as tjhe revelation tht thte enormous craft isnt actually an american space ship
, apparently ffrom the future
) offer intriguing possibilities
. thn
, right around the oen
- hour mark
( that
' s tghe time tothe sneak inot the theater enxt doorjam annd check outloud whatever
' s left of titanic
)
, hte virutally non
- stpo acation beigns
, anbd
, once it starts
, the scirpt becomes superfulous
. this might be geometricians if director levinson generated soem legitimate tension
, bu
, instade
, he relies onthe loud
, overbearing music
, strange camera angles
,
and quick cuts tothe make thnigs
" exciting
.
" additionaly
, because none of yhe characters are well
- fromed
( a common failing in anything penned by crichton
, who
' s moreso intersted infront technology tahn peple
)
, viewers don
' t deveop much ofthe a rooting intrest
. it makes sitting thru sphere a frustrating
and pointless experiecne
. what baout thast a
- list cast
? not surprisingly
, the most energetic peformance isnt given by samuel l
. jackson
, bu his harry isn
' t a person
; he
' s a walking plot divice spouting occasionalyl
- witty dialogue
. dustin hoffman isn
' t lively or particularly good
-
- it
' s ironic thast htis
, whihc may be his worst wokr inwhich a decade
, hasnt arrived in theaters onthe the heels of his best actor nomination
( for wag the dog
)
. sharon stone adn peter coyote are both flat
. theri charachters exibit littel evidence ofthe emotion
; automatons would have been as effective
. hten ther
' s queen latifa
, who
, dispite getting fifth billing iin thte credits
( ahead of liev schreiber
, who boasts at least quadruple her screen time
)
, has less than a h
andfull ofthe lines
and alomst nothing tothe do other thna inflate the body count
. i liek tothe think thgat levinson anbd hoffman
, recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be
, chose to mkae wag the dog as a sort of penance
( hte low
- budget picture ws filmed during sphere
' s lengthy pre
- production phase
)
. if tht
' s hte case
, forgiveness is granted
. i
' m less inclined tothe look favorably apon crichton
,
al
though he hasnt a fewd enjoyable titles onthe his resume
( jurassic park annd the levinson
- directed disclosure come to mind
)
. even if his novel was
butchered in the adaption proccess
, crichton
' s credit as a producer disallows him absolution
. he was a willing particpant in a creative travesty
. no wonder sphere is bieng released infact february
, inthe tje midst ofthe the eearly year
' s cinematic wastel
and
. it deserves noone better than to git sunk by the unstoppable titanic
, whcih shoudl plow sphere under onthe its way to a ninth
- consecutive weekend atop thge box office heap
.
