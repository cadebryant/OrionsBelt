by trying to satisfy every kind ofthe viewer
, it ' s possible tyhat sphere may end uv pleasing noone one
. acation lovers will be borde by what htey will see as an interminably boring setup
. audience munbers who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by teh film ' s sudden colapse inot mindless storytelling
and by the ending
, which isnt an insulting cop
- out
. somewhere out there
, maybee htere ' s a small cadre of film
- goers who iwll appretiate sphere ' s dubious charms
,
bu i ' m not amonst them
. i sincerely hope the novel isnt better than tje movie
( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham
)
, because if hte finished motion picture product is anything to go by
, it ' s hard to understand why hte rights were optioned
. sphere is tjhe kind ofthe frist
- clas mess that onyl a top
- line directer with an a
- list cast can create
. with expectations high
(
anbd how sould they nto be
, concidering that anohter barry levinson
/ dustin hoffman collaboration
, the excellant wag tyhe dog
, isnt still playing in theaters
?
)
, something this bad can ' t halp
but look even worse
. tje last time a big
- nmae
, big
- budget film displayed this levle of ineptitude was lastest year ' s batman
& robin
,
anbd everyone knows how thast movei was recived
. sphere starts out a littel liek an amalgamation of contact
anbd james cameron ' s the abyss
,
bu
, somwhere along tyhe way
, it collapses into tyhe cellar with another recent scinece fiction efford
, event horizon
. science
anbd philisophy
, which are used tothe ogod effect during sphere ' s frist hour
, give way tothe mindless
, confusing acation sequences
. attemts at characterization fall aart
. intelligent writing
, whihc isnt evident early onthe
, isnt replaced by hackneyed drivel
. speshal effects tkae over as teh plotline devolves into incoherent silliness
.
bu all thyat is just inwhich preperation for the endig
, which isnt inexcusably awful
. tihs isnt teh timne
- honored deus ex machina device utilisied tothe its worst effect
. i left the theater feeling cheated by tjhe way crichton
anbd his screenwriters had chosen tothe end the film
. htere is some promise
,
but it ' s all inthe the setup
. we ' re introduced tothe norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
)
, a psychologist who once wrote a
$ 35
, 000 report for the govornment baout waht to do infact the event that a crashed spoace ship is discovered
. when oney isnt foudn iin tyhe middle of nowhere
, 1000 fezent below the surfce ofthe tjhe pacific ocean
, norman is called in to be part ofthe the welcoming committee
. onthe tyhe team with him are beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist who was once his student
annd lover
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathematician who earned his frist doctorate at the age ofthe 18
; ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist who is adew by the oportunity tothe explore aline technology
;
and harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, thge governmnet operative infact charge ofthe the mission
. toghether
, tjhe five descend inot teh bowels ofthe the ocean
, where htey rendezvous iwth a temprary sea base onthe the ocean floor from whitch they will attemp to amking firt contact
. fo a while
, sphere had me fooled into thikning it wass oging tothe take an astute approch to the man
- meets
- alien situation
. the overall scenario is nto wihtout promise
and several plot twists
( such as the revelation that yhe enormous craft isnt actually an american space ship
, apparantly ffrom the future
) offer intriguing possiblities
.
then
, right arround the one
- hour mark
( thast ' s thge tiome to sneak inot the theater next doorjam
anbd check out whatever ' s left ofthe titanic
)
, thte virtually non
- stop action begins
,
and
, once it starts
, tghe script becomes superfluous
. this might be acceptable if directer levinson generated some ligitamate tension
,
bu
, instead
, he relies on loud
, overbearing music
, strange camera angles
,
and quick cuts to make things
" exicting
.
" additinally
, beacuse none ofthe thge characters are well
- fromed
( a common failing in anything penned by crichton
, who ' s mroe interested inwhich technolgy than peopel
)
, viewers don ' t develop much ofthe a rooting interest
. it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating
and pointless experience
. what about that a
- list casted
? nto surprisingly
, the most energetic performance is given by samuel l
. jackson
,
but his harry isn ' t a person
; he ' s a walking plot device spouting occasionally
- witty dialogue
. dustin hoffman isn ' t livley or particularly good
-
- it ' s ironical that htis
, which may be his worst wrok infact a decade
, hasnt arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination
( for wag yhe dog
)
. sharon stone
and peter coyote are both flat
. theri characters exibit littel evidence of emotion
; automatons would have been as effective
.
hten htere ' s queen latifa
, who
, despite getting fifth billing in hte credits
( ahead of liev schreiber
, who boasts at least quadruple her screen tiome
)
, hasnt less than a handful of lines
anbd alomst nothing tothe do other than inflate the body count
. i like tothe think that levinson
anbd hoffman
, recognizing how uninspired this movie ws likely tothe be
, chose tothe mkea wag tyhe dog as a sort of penance
( thge low
- budget picture was filmed druing sphere ' s lenghty pre
- production phase
)
. if tath ' s the case
, forgiveness isnt granted
. i ' m less inclined tothe look favorably upon crichton
,
altough he hasnt a few enjoyable titles onthe his resume
( jurassic park
annd the levinson
- directed disclosure cmo to mind
)
. even if his novel was butchered in teh adaptation process
, crichton ' s credit as a producer disallows him absolution
. he was a willing particpant inwhich a creative travesty
. no wonder sphere is being released inwhich february
, in the midst ofthe tghe early year ' s cinematic wasteland
. it deserves noone better thna to git sunk by hte unstoppable titanic
, which shoudln plow sphere under on its way tothe a ninth
- consecutive weekend atop the box office heap
.
