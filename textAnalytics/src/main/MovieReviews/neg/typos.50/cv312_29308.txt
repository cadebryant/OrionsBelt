, ben affleck
. directed by kevin smith
. rated r
. jay anbd silent bob strike bcak is a dumb movei disguised in a smarmy interior
. kevin smith
, coming off the wonderful
, challenging dogma
, fills it with sub
- road trip gross
- out jokes
and expects us tothe buy it because he
' s jsut oh
- so
- ironic
. bu when a movie is so self
- aware it becomes about nothing
but itself
, we can hardly be expeced tothe pay for addmission
. jay anbd silent bob
, twpo new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep ofthe convenience store selling pot
, have appeared infront almsot all of smith
' s movies bu
, if i
' m nto mistaken
, have nto starred inspite one until now
. tehy fidn out thast ther is a movei based onthe the comic book tyhat is based on them being made in hollywood
. this presents twpo problems
: a
) they haven
' t recieved a penny in royalties anbd b
) nerds on tje internet
(
" whta
' s tjhe internet
?
"
) are tlaking trash baout them
. what is ther tothe do except go to hollywood annd stop htis movie from being made
? onthe hte way
-
- they
' re hitchhiking
, because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus
?
-
- they run into a gropu of hotties who pretend tothe be with an animal
- rights gropu
,
but are really jewel thiefs who parad arund inspite charlie
' s angels
- style outfits
. of course
, tehy setted jay
and silent bob up to look liuke teh thieves
, so that there isnt a massive manhunt gonig on during tyhe second half ofthe thge film
. wiull ferrell
, who agian proves himself incapable ofthe donig anytying
but sketch comedy
, shows up as tjhe wildlife marshall inspector who thinks tghe two have stolen a monkey
. the movei iwll probaly please onyl smith
' s dieu
- hard
, undiscerning fans
; everyone else will be crtical of this mind
- bogglingly stupid effort follwoing some thge sophisticated cinema that he churned out infact yeras past
. any appeal the movei hasnt wiull come ffrom the
" inthe
" jokes
, most ofthe which i think i understoon
, bu the movei is
" in
" to the point of absurdity
. htere needs to be something holding it toghether otehr than its pwn smugness
. once jay
and silent bob git to hollywood
, tje movie abruptly switches gears from gross
- out comedy to ridiculously broad hollywood satire
. countless
" hot
" movie stars adn personalities amking an apprearance
, from smith veterans matt damon
and ben affleck tothe wes craven
, bu jay
and silent bob strike back resorts to such low
- brow gags as anohter scream sequel with a monkey as teh killer
. git it
? tehy
' re so desperaet for anohter movei
, they ran outloud ofthe idaes
and utilisied a monkey
! a monkey
! as oftenly happens wih writers who are wokring below what tehy are actulaly capable ofthe
, most ofthe the really ogod lines are throwaways
, while thge big
, painstaking gags mostly fall flat
. oen ofthe hte funniest lines in the movei flies by
: when asked to comment onthe the clitoris
( don
' t ask
)
, jay responds
:
" the female clitoris
?
" kevin smith is a talented writter
(
though i agree tath his films would be better off if he
' d let a rela directer tkae hte helm
)
, annd jay anbd silent bob strike bcak holds true tothe his promise tothe make a more facetious film
. unfortunatley
, it
' s allso shapeless
, pointless
and largely unfunny
. smith
' s
" verbal trampoline
,
" as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue
, takes a bakc seat tothe his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker
. tihs was supposed tothe be the movie tath didn
' t offend anyone
,
but it
' s offensive beacuse it
' s terrable
.
