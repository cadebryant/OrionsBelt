i won
 t even pretend that i hvae seen tghe otehr 3 alien films
. i saw glimpses of aline
and aliens
anbd fragments of aline 3
,
bu i have by noone means acutally sat down
anbd watched any of them
. so tkae my oppinion from an unbiased
and impartial prespective
: aline ressurrection isnt not worth the large bag ofthe lollies i wass munching inot affter a hard day
 s work
. i didn
 t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful
; most ofthe the acting wass very averege or the special effects got tiresome after 5 mintues ofthe painful viewing

but also the fact that every tedeous ingredient thrown inthe attemts to give this pointless dribble some meaninng
. sigourney weaver
, who
 s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination
, plays yhe character ofthe
 ripley
,
 who died fighting agianst extraterrestial scum inspite aline 3
. 200 years later
, scientists
 use a sample of blood found at yhe site ofthe her death tothe recreate ripley
- inlcuding the aline that wass stuck inside her
. inwhich no tiome tehy remove tyhe aline ffrom her body
adn seperate tjhe two
;
yot ripley is now nto completly human
, possessing strange amounts ofthe strength
and being able tothe withold greater pain than a normal being
. i
 m sure somene cant explain exactlly why htis isnt so
,
bu fo now we
 ll just ignore it
annd move onthe
. why
, yuo ask
, owudl ripley
anbd the aline inside her be recreated
? well
, teh smart little lab researchers beleived thast tehy would be able to disover many advancements infront sience from studying yhe alien creature
. theese were the same people who said htey coudl controll tghe aline
and thta theri was noone danger iin their research
. they
( yawn
) were wrong
. it doesn
 t tkae a genuis to figure outloud taht yhe rest of thte film isnt a continuous cat
and mouse chase bewteen the humans who dieu off one by oen
annd tghe aliens who ope their mouths on every possibile ocassion tothe show off thier frightfully scray un
- flossed teeth
. ther
 s a little saying thyat goes something like tihs
:
 if yuo
 re gogin to make a bad film
, do it well
.
 i ahve seen plenty ofthe disapointing
and underachieving movies
,
but they are not tjhe ones tht realyl bother me
. aline ressurection
, a good exemple ofthe a film that raelly gets up my nose
, isnt not so much a discouraging exerience
bu an off putting one
. there is no way tothe describe why the australian ma rating wass given tothe this film other tahn unnecessary
and repulsive gore
, whihc attemts tothe distract us fomr the wandering
-
bu
- nto
- going
- anyhwere plot
. iin oen scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking aline put its hand on a cahracters head
and literally ripped most of his face off
. anyother one featured ripley sticking a knife thru her hand jsut to impress someone she was talking tothe
. fair anough if it weere in a horror film or even if it beared any signifigance tothe teh story
,
bu tihs isnt unfourtunately not thte case
,
adn tihs sort ofthe bizzare gore isnt inexcusable
. if yuo think i
 m stuggling tothe find one good aspect baout the film
,
then you thought right
. oen exciting scene isnt a credit
(
and thge onyl part remotely worth seeing
) tothe thge film
, infront which an aline chases two men
( one a cripple
) uv a tall ladder with interesting results
.
bu of course aftter thyat thrilling scene aline resurrection hadnt no probelm infront returing tothe its pathetically low standart
,
adn ends uv crashing into the shores of movie dullness more oftenly than japaneese kamikaze jet fighters fall off thier skis
. so in a film where yhe one liners come as bad as
 earth man
, what a shit hole

annd yhe primary means for one mans startegic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent
, its noone wonder why alien
: ressurection turned outloud tothe be as off putting
and clumsy as it isnt
. oh
,
annd inthe case you
 re wondering baout my bag ofthe lollies
 tjhe less i enjoy a film
, the moreso i eat
. so all teh lollies were gone inspite 15 minutes
;
but
however empty tyhe bag turned outloud tothe be
, it ws still a long way ahead of tyhe movei
