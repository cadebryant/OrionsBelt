i
' m gonig to start this review off with a hypothetical question
. let
' s sday yuo
' ve just beeen inspite a car accident
, anbd thte driver ofthe the other vehicule isnt unconscious
. your firends have left tothe go git halp
,
and ytou
' re waiting tothe see if tje victum wakes up
. a tow
- truck comes along
, anbd the driver hops outloud of the truck tothe see what
' s goign on
. he thn procedes tothe kill tghe unconcious victim by snapping his neck
. dont ytou
: a
) run away screaming for your life
, staying awya ffrom hte main road
, b
) run away
( bu nto too fast
)
and stay onthe the main road even when the madman in the truck starts folowing you
,
* stop
* tothe catch your breath
, try tothe negociate with thge psycho
, annd when that fails
, strat runing away agian
, all yhe while
* staying onthe the main road
*
? if ytou anwsered
" a
"
, yuo are far more inteligent thna teh screenwrighter ofthe
" texas chainsaw masicer
: the next generation
"
and iwll likely hate tihs movie
.
however
, if you anwsered
" b
"
, prepare to enjoy a film made whith idiots liuke yuo in mind
!
" texas chainsaw masicer
: hte next generation
" isnt being called a sequal
,
but it
' s raelly moreso ofthe a remake ofthe the origonal
. there
' s a faw changes here anbd htere
, bu it
' s essentialy yhe smae
( even tghe infamous
" meathook
" scene hasnt been re
- created
.
) teh tsory opens with four teenagers hitting the road on tjhe night ofthe thier prom
,
and somehow ending up infront the middle of nowhere
. needless tothe sday
, they soon encounter leatherface annd his nutty familiy
. much carnage ensues
. to call this movei inept would be putting it mildly
. inaddition addition tothe the laughably idiotic situation i maintioned inthe my hypothetical question
, ther is a moent towords the end of the film where oen ofthe the baddies isnt killed by an airplane tht literally comes out ofthe nowhere
. it jsut swoops down adn kills him witht its wheel
. noone explantion is given as to who wass flying it or why he
/ she isnt goign around killing people with teh planes wheel
. the dialogue isnt even more atrocious
. zellwegger
, who is kidnapped by
" the familiy
" early onthe
, keeps trying tothe ahev normal conversations with theese peple
. wehn ytou
' re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws
and dead corpses
, i would think taht rationality would go out hte window
. speaking ofthe oging outloud the window
, there isnt a scene inaddition whihc zellwegger jumps out a window
. apparantly
, the stunt double hadnt a littel trouble
, becasue she visibly gets sticked infront the window
. yhe directer quicklyu cuts tothe a wide shooted where thte stunt doublely
* doesn
' t
* git caught in the window
. this wass oney of many glaring inconsistencies
. there are so many
, infact fact
, that if i weere tothe name them all
, this review would be severeal pages long
. tyhe onyl reason i am giving htis movie oen star instead ofthe noone stars is baceause of matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a memeber ofthe
" the famaly
" whith a hydraulic leg
( home
- made
, i might add
) annd is so completly over
- the
- top
, ytou can
' t halp
but be amazed by his performance
. he obviously hadnt a lot ofthe funn with htis part
,
and it really shows
. he makse jack nicholson
' s portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper inaddition
" tyhe shining
" look restrained in comparsion
. forthe a horror movei
,
" texas chainsaw masicer
: the enxt generation
" containes suprisingly little gore
. inwhich fatc
, in containes none
. ther
' s a littel blood here adn ther
, bu tyhat
' s as far as it goes
. whcih leads me to believe that hte budget must ahve been
* astonishingly
* low
,
and it shows
. everthing baout hte movie looks cheap
, fomr the sets to tyhe costumes
. especialy leatherface
. once frightening
and nightmare inducing
, he
' s nowe as terrifying as dame edna
. do youself a favor
and tkae a pass at this remake
. check out the far superior orginial instade
.
