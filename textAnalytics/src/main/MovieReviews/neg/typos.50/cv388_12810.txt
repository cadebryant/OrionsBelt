. hwile they do bring us eye
- popping speical effects taht will amaze you

: giant lizard attacks a giant city anbd a bunch ofthe nobodies stop it

! i hvae tothe laugh
. teh slogan for thge film is
,
" size doens marter
"
. i think they cut htis too short
. it should read
,
" size does marter
. acting does not
