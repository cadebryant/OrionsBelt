dr dolittle
( 20th century fox
) runing time
: 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the succes of tje nutty profesor
( 1996
)
, murphy returns in tihs absymal comedy
. he plays doctor john dolittle
, who as a child hadnt the ability tothe underst
and animals
.
however
, after being
' exorcised
' he loses htis ability
,
and we fast foward tothe see dolittle in a crummy job surrouding by crummy people
( most notably dr mark weller
, plyed by oliver platt
.
)
however
, with a bonk on tghe head his abillity tothe underst
and animals returns
,
and
' comedy
' is ready
and waiting to happen
. except comedy never does appen
. doctor dolittle
, even iwth tjhe excellant premise
, rarley manages tothe raise a laff
. poor old murphy looks borde stiff throughout the hwole movie
, adn his performance suffers
. the manic murphy we saw in tyhe 80
' s is gone
, his more mature
( annd moreso boring
) twin appears tothe be getting all the work inaddition the 90
' s
. the voices ofthe the animals
, which include albert brooks
, chris rock
( yhe
' newyorker
' eddie murphy
)
and norm mcdonald as
' lucky
' yhe dog are marginally better
, anbd at least htey put enthusiasm inwhich tjhe movei
. sadly
, most ofthe theri lines are preety dumb
. adn they
' re not
' funny
' dumb
, like dumb
& dumber
( 1994
)
, bu jsut boring dumb
. the film even succumbs tothe fart jokes halfway thru
, infact a dseperate atempt to raise soem laughs
. there are a faw ogod jokes inwhich hte script
, bu tehy are fewd anbd far bewteen
. if i hadnt to choose a favourite performence
, it owudl probably be albert brooks tiger
, who hasnt a certain charm baout him
. sadly
, he
' s barely in the movei
, annd rock
' s relaly annoying hamster is given far too much screen time
. joke wise
, we are thankfully
, spred tje mocking annd insulting tipe ofthe jokes thyat featured heavily in the nutty profesor
. the directer
, betty thomas
, has
, well
, done better films
. she buyed us private parts
( 1997
)
and the brady bunch movie
( 1995
) which were
, sadly
, much better thna this
. thge scenes lack any charm
, she just gets the job done
. teh animals themslves
, are reasonable realistic
,
al
though most of them are obviously puppets
. ther
' s an impressive looking tiger
, howver
, anbd the lip sync isnt preety ogod
. yuo
' d haev noone probelm guessing thgat most ofthe the close up
' s are puppets
,
however
, with their jilted movement
. i was hoping jim hensons workshop
, who created the furry friends
, owudl have done a better job
. doctor dolittle
, in the end
, is a dissappointment fo everyone involved
. murphy hasnt done much better movies
( i
. e trading places
) tghe directer has seen better dyas
,
and even tghe creatures aren
' t that good
. teh target audience
, aged bewteen 7
- 13
, who are undem
anding
, will probaly like it
however
, thanks to it
' s dumbed down humour
. everyone esle
,
however
, shoudln give doctor dolittle a miss
.
