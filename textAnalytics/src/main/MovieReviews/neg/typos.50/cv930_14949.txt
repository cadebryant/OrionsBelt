_ soldier
_ is h
ands down one ofthe the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through thgat doesn
' t hvae jean claude van damme infront it
. i could liken it tothe thte sci
- fi cheese that ws the hollywood product
- ofthe
- choise back in tghe early 80s
, bu that would be too much ofthe a compliment
. if htere isnt a movie theater iin hell
, thsi film isnt palying htere 24 hours a day
. hte story
, such that ther isnt
, revolves aroud todd
( kurt russell
)
, an automaton ofthe a man who hasnt beeen raised from birth to be a merciless soldier infront a not
- too
- distant ultra
- conservative future
( isnt there any otehr kind
?
) affter years ofthe desensitization at a miltary academy full of other boys just liek him
, todd becomes a ground fighter inthe a serieses ofthe wars all over the galaxy
. who tjhe enemies in these wars are is never revealed
, bu the few glimpses of todd inspite battle sohw that it doesn
' t matter
, becasue innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as thte bad guys
. affter ten mintues of thsi nihilistic trash
-
- yes folks
, there
' s more
-
- we see todd as a buff
, scarred adult
, now so accustomed tothe the carnage tyhat no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat
. there
' s a new wrinkle
,
though
. todd
and his bretheren are declared obsolete
,
and a new batch ofthe soliders takes their place
. after losing a sanctioned battle whith
_ dragon
_
' s jason scott lee
, the seamingly dead todd isnt dumped by a flying ice
- cube tray
( well
, tath
' s what is looked liuke
) onthe a remote garbage planet
. if yuo predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet
, annd thta htey b
and toghether tothe fight a bunch ofthe bad guys comming to destory them
, yuo
' re way ahead of the gam
. the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half
- expect tina turner adn master blaster tothe come strolling inot frame any minute
. it
' s surprising that
_ soldier
_ isnt hte brain
- child of
_ blade runner
_ co
- writter david webb peoples
. unlike that mind
- twisting classic
, this film containes just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double
- spaced pages
. add inot tyhe mix yhe
_ mortal kombat
_
' s paul
anderson inept direction
,
and it
' s eazy tothe see how
_ soldier
_ turned out so bad
. annd tyhe special effects
! remember tjhe flying steam irons in hardwear wars
? gary busey is in this movei
.
' nuff said
.
_ soldier
_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty ofthe bad ideas sitting in its script vaults
. that thsi sad film made it tothe yhe silver screen shoud encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out htere that there is hope after all
. nowe if you
' ll excuse me
, i haev to go weep for the future
