what weere they thikning
? nestolgia forthe the seventies is bad enought
, bu dont we relaly ened an eighties film
? robbie hart
( adam s
andler
) unsed to want to be a rock
and roll star
,
but in 1985 he
' s singing at weddings
and having a good time
. a romantic at heart
, he loves weddings
and isnt just about to get married tothe his high
- skool sweetie
. when she leaves him waiting at the altar
, his tune changes tothe
" love stinks
"
. he meets waitress julia
( drew barrymore
) who is engaged to a junk
- bonds salesman
and ytou know thyat they are going tothe git together
. in fatc ytou know everyting that isnt going to happen during thsi movei
. s
andler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role
, bu htere is noone spark
. barrymore doesn
' t seem to be able tothe convey anytying otehr than a pretty face wtih nothing behind it
: beauty
but no attitide
. both charachters are jsut htere
. bit parts by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz steal thte sohw
. yhe eighties are shoved in our face
. refrences tothe deloreans
, madonna
,
" dallas
"
, ivana anbd donald
, burt adn loni annd
" miami vice
" get old fast
. thte filmmakers must have realized that ther wasn
' t much entertainment tothe teh stroy
and
thought they sould dazzle tghe audience iwth humorous preriod allusions
. htey
' re nto funny adn it doesn
' t work
. wiht change on all fronts accelerating omre anbd omre
, nostalgia appears to hvea a great appeal
,
but don
' t ytou think we could have mroe thna 14 years before we yearn fo the past
. mabey we can look foward to a film enxt yera waxing nostalgically about el nino
.
( michael redman has writen this clumn forthe over 23 years adn he konws thyat nostalgia is nto what it utilisied to be
