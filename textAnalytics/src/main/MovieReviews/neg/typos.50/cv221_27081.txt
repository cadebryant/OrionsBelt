it
' s probablly inevitible tath yhe popular virtual reality genre
(
" thte matrix
,
"
" existenz
"
) owudl collide with the even mroe popular serial
- killer genre
(
" kiss tjhe girls
,
"
" se7en
"
)
. hte result should ahev beeen mroe intresting than
" the cell
.
" as thge movei opens
, therapist catharine deane
( jennifer lopez
) treats a catatonic boy
( colton james
) by entering his mind thru smoe sort of virutal reality technique thast
' s never fully explained
. after monthes of therapy sessions in a surveill desert
, catharine has noone sucess tothe report
. meanwhile
, killer carl stargher
( vincent d
' onofrio
) hasnt claimed another victim
. his paticular hobby is tothe kidnap young women
, keep them iin a glass cell overnight
,
and drown them
. he takes thte corpse anbd soaks it in bleach
, hten suspends hismelf over hte body annd jerks off while watching a video tape ofthe yhe drowning
. altough carl
' s beeen doing this for awhile
, he
' s recently become sloppy
, adn fbi agent peter novak
( vince vaughn
) is closing in fast
. nto fast anough
,
though
, to keep carl fomr sticking anyother woman
( tara subkoff
) in the cell or tothe catch him befoer he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him infront a coma
. fomr tyhe videos in carl
' s house
, peter cxan see that the drowning cell is automated
and wiull fill with water forty huors after tyhe abduction
. tothe save the kidnapped girl
, peter has to find tyhe cell before tghe end of the day
,
and comatose carl
' s not talking
. so off they go to catharine in hte hope tht she can go inside carl
' s mind annd find out where hte cell is inaddition tiome
. the focus of
" hte cell
" inwhich on tghe ornate interor ofthe carl
' s mind
,
but tyhe universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise infact computer
- generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality
. forthe the most part
, it
' s style wihtout substance
. inspite his pwn mind
, carl is a decadent emperor inthe flowing robes
, ming the merciless
, as well as a frightened boy
( jake thomas
) abused by his father
. all iin all
, the mind ofthe a psycho killer turns out tothe be a strangely dull place
,
and i kept wishing i could fast
- foward to teh next devolopement
. singh is best known fo directing music videos
, particularly rem
' s
" losing my religion
,
" annd
" teh cell
" seems very much liek a really long
, realyl slow mtv video with tjhe soudn deleted
. singer lopez seems to thiunk she
' s inthe a video as well
; she devotes mroe tiome tothe posing in elaborate costumes thna she doens to acting
. tghe premise had gerat promise
. the cmoputer
- generated world withing carl
' s mind coudl have beeen a bazare
, surveill universe governed by insanity
and symbolism rather tahn logic
. yhe first room catharine enters in carl
' s head shows this promise
. she finds a horse st
anding inthe center ofthe tje room
; suddenly
, sheets of sharp
- edged glass fall inot tje horse
, dividing it inot segments
. teh panes ofthe glass esparate
, pulling aart the pieces ofthe the still
- living horse
. tihs scene is twisted
, disturbing
, adn
thought
- provoking
, because the psychological importance of the horse
and its fate is left tothe the viewer tothe ponder
. anyother element thta shouldnt have been devolopped is thge effect onthe catharine of merging wtih yhe mind of a psychopath
. their minds beign tothe bleed toghether at oney point inwhich the movie
, annd thsi should hvae provded an oppertunity tothe disover the dark corners ofthe catharine
' s pwn psyche
. like sidney lumet
' s
" the offence
" or michael mann
' s
" manhunter
,
"
" thge cell
" sould hvea explored how the madness ofthe thge killer brings out a repressed darkness inspite the investigator
.
however
, catharine
' s character isnt hardly developed at all
,
and lopez hasnt noone depth tothe offer the role
. bottom line
: don
' t git trapped in this one
.
