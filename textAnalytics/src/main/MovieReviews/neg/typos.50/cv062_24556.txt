ther are twpo things thge american film inudstry should avoid at all costs
. one isnt letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels inot a feature film
. two is never greenlight a sci
- fi film starring john travolta
. tothe witn
, we present the diaster tyhat isnt battlefield earth
. a science
- fiction opus starring the barbarino of teh actors guild
, battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum
- security prisons wehn a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior
. sci
- fi is alwasy a trirchy byast
: tight scirpt
, a good director
, an ensemble cast of decent actors
, annd the abilty to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs
. battlefield earth fails at acheiving even oen of these attri
butes
. here
' s the
` plot
.
' the year is 3000
. mankind hasnt been become an endangered species thanks tothe the conquest of a race ofthe aliens called the psychlos
( soudns liuke eather the latest clown ect from cirque de soleil or a white rap group
)
. a small b
and of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies inwhich fear ofthe tje
` demons
' who dwell infront the cities below
. tyhe psychlos are strip
- mining tghe earth forthe its resources
and terel
, played by travolta
, isnt the head of security for the minning
/ slave base located in denver
. a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler
, plyed witht dramtic flair by barry pepper
, ventures from the saftey of the caves inot the city to uncover tjhe truth baout the
` demons
.
' he isnt promptly captured
and tooked to the aline base
. aftter sevral attemts at escape
, johanine isnt placed inthe tghe middle of an underh
anded subplot ofthe terel
' s
, involving circumventing gold ffrom an exposed vein inwhich the rockies tothe his pwn end
. jonnie
, assumed leader ofthe the mining slave gropu
, thne manages to attain all psychlo
and human intelligence thru a learning machine terel forces him tothe uise
.
then thte story jstu runs along until jonnie teachs tyhe rest of the humans tyhe basics of trignometry
, the bill of rights
, how tothe ule a machine gun
,
and how tothe fli a harrier jet
. the hwole mess concludes with a big
, loud
, obnoxious gun
-
and
- plane battle that had me praying fo thte end credits
. roger christian
, the directer of this lumbering biast
, must have rented dune
, blade runner
, planet ofthe the apes
, indipendence day
, stargate
, beastmaster
, the airwolf epidsodes
, the
` v
' miniseries
, the matrix
,
and hte omega man
.
.
.
and desided to steal eveyr scene he coudl for battlefield earth
. christian even shoots eveyr scene infact a weird dutch angle titled left or right forthe every frome ofthe the movei
! adn eveyr scene in hte movei ends whith a middle wipe
-
- realy
. the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players withthe bad teeth adn bloated h
ands
and klingon extras working yhe star trak convention circuit
. travolta
' s acting hasn
' t beeen this bad usance the experts or maybe perfect
. jonnie goodboy tyler evolves inot william wallace whith lines liek
` yuo can hvae your freedom if yuo fight
!
'
then ther
' s the scirpt
: the film just never convinces ytou thta yhe llright ofthe jonnie in teaching his fellow humans tothe fight anbd
` tkae bakc the planet
' would be a difficult task to achieve
. why
? becasue terel provides all the necessary tools tothe incite a revolt
-
- fo no particular reason beside the fact that
` humans are stupid
.
' terel may be right
, you nkwo
. humans made this movei
.
