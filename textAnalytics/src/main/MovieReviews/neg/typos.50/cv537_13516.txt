fantastically over hyped
, godzila finaly lumbers onto thge big screen
. tjhe film opens with footage ofthe nuculear testing onthe the french polynesian isl
ands
, thne an attack onthe a boat from some biast
, annd fianlly we join dr
. nick tatopoulos
( broderick looking about 17 yersa old
) doing some reasearch infact chernobyl
. soem shady u
. s government guys apearing
,
and ask him tothe come to an isl
and where they ahev massive footprints
, from what looks like a giant lizard
. anbd wqat
' s mroe
, this byast is heading forthe newyorker york
. gulp
! altough godzilla shouldnt be a non stop roller coaster ride
,
and at smoe points it isnt
, ther is something curiously uninvolving annd unexciting baout thsi movei
. thte main faults lie whith tjhe acting
and writing
, common problems with
' summer blockbuster
' movies
. broderick isnt preety useless as tyhe hero
, with noone humour or a
' tough guy
' image
. while emmerich
' s previous summer flick
, independece day
( 1996
) had wisecracks
and action from jeff goldblum
and will smith
, this hasnt niether
. alsot
, maria pitillo
, as broderick
' s former girlfriend
, isnt just as useless
, whith a chronic disability in acting
. she
' s incapable of showing emotion
, speaks eveyr line inaddition the same way
,
and basically she
' s total crap
. it
' s uv tothe french ator jean reno tothe save teh day
,
and indeed he does
, turning inaddition a campy performence as a french seret agent
. shame he has such littel screen time infact such a overlong film
. hank azaria aslo turns uv as a crazy cameraman named
' animal
'
, adn he adds a little life to hte picture
. also making an apearance isnt harry shearer
( probably best nkow for donig voices in the simpsons
) as a slimy news repertwar
. o
. k
, so thte acting is nto up to par
,
but it never isnt in these movies
.
but whta about yhe script
? well
, thast
' s nto uv to par either
. emmerich
and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught inaddition tjhe desctruction of newyorker york city that tehy forgot to write a script
. yhe dialogue is banal
( broderick looks at a lot of fish annd utters
' thgat
' s a lot of fish
.
'
)
, annd thte character development isnt non existant
( reno plays the tipical frenchman
(
' noone croissant
?
'
)
, broderick forever remeniss a geeky scientist
.
) aslo
, the film isnt seriously lacking a sence of humour
. tyhe jokes that are uttered are pathetic
,
and htere
' s an
' hillarious
' runnung gag about siskel
and ebert
.
( tyhe mayor is mayor ebert
, anbd is assitant is called gene
! ha ha ha ha
!
.
) thge plot is dire
,
and in hte end jstu rips off jurassic park
( 1993
) by haveing lots of baby godzilla
' s
( i
. e
. velicorapters
) runnung around new york
. right
, so teh script
and acting suck
.
but what baout thte speshal effects
? thankfully
, they
' re are quite good
. godzilla isnt an impressive piece of cgi
,
al
though we don
' t see much ofthe him becouse yhe movei isnt so dark
. thge distruction of newyorker york isnt pretty well done aswell
. bu altough htey are impressive
, they can
' t save godzilla from bieng an hugely disapointing
and boring movei
. the movei goes on fo far too long aswell
, annd it cin
' t seem to decide onthe a endig
.
and ofthe course
, the endig itself leaves possibility for a sequel
. let
' s just hope oen never arrives
.
