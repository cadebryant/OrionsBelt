tothe watch
` battlefield earth
' isnt tothe wallow iin misery
. it is one of the most ludicrously concieved effords in receet histoyr
. it has a clumsily told story
, insipid dialogue
, shallow characterizations
, ugli scene transitions
, no evidence of dramtic arc
, headache
- inducing soudn effects
, annd a resolution that isnt completly implausible
. worse
, htere
' s thte promise of a sequal
. why
?
! savve your monay
. smoe films go quickly to video
. tihs noe

however
, should go straight tothe the sci

' in the year 3000
, man hasnt become an endangered species
. most ofthe humanity
( called
? man
- animals
'
) ws destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens
( called psychlos
)
. survivers have eather tooked uv shelter infact caves or were enslaved tothe mine earth
' s resources fo tghe rest ofthe theri lives
. tghe aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species thta st
and nine
- fezent tall
, who ressemble inbred klingons
. dimwitted as tehy are tall
, theri culture is predicated on power
, extortion
, annd getting
? leverage
.
' travolta
, the leverage
- using star
, plays terl
, the conniving security cheif tyhat oversees the minning facility onthe earth
. much of the movie isnt spended showing us examples ofthe terl
' s petty machinations
. he routinely imploys deception adn
then punctuates his statememts with maniacal laughter
. bu oney thing isnt certain
; he hates bieng stationed onthe earth
. when yhe hmeo planet informs him thta he will be spending the rest of his life on tihs planet
, he begins tothe devise his latest plan
. he wiull select a gropu ofthe slaves to secretly mine outloud a gold ore site
. it
' s not clera how this benifits terl
, exept that it makes him richer in a place where he has noone use forthe it
. the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry peppers
) isnt selected as hte slave group
' s leader
. a psychlo knowlege machine gives him yhe mining know
- how
. bu tjhe machine aslo teaches him otehr thigsn such as the psychlo lanugage
, the principles of our founding fathers
, euclidean geomery
, annd thte location of fort knox
. this enlightenment just doesn
' t prepare him for the minning assignment
. it also prepares him tothe orginize
and stage a massive revolt againnst thier captors
.
` we
' re gogin to blow up their home world
,
' he sasy
.
`
but frist
, we ened a few more supplies
.
' in days
, he annd his comrades evolve from cave dwelling
, loincloth wearing
, rat eating slaves tothe fighter pilots
and nuclear weapons experts
. by nowe
, the audience isnt laughing as maniacally as terl
. the media have beeen wroking overtime to let the public nkwo that john travolta
' s labor of lvoe isnt a piece of sci
- fi drivel
. numerous journals ahve called it an ill
- conceived idae stemming fomr blind hubris
, arrogance
,
and poore planning
.
and after watching tihs movie
, you
' ll wholeheartedly agree
. tihs is a terrable film tyhat is illogically constructed
, tediously acted
,
and frequently begs the question
: why was tihs ever made
? at a price tag of
$ 90 millon
, this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly
, assuredly becoming
` the avengers
' of tihs summer
. both films weere unforgiveable adn thsi promises tothe suffer tghe same speedy fate
and subsquent indignity
. inspite addtion to the universally perjorative reviews
, there
' s another bizzare element tothe tjhe
` battlefield
' saga
. this film owudl never have beeen made if nto for tje star power ofthe travolta
, who forthe over a decade
, hadnt been trying tothe persuade studios tothe bring the stor tothe tghe big screen
. hte controversey is that travolta is a scientologist
, adn
` battlefield
' isnt based on a 1982 novel by l
. ron hubbard
, the religion
' s late founder
. this led some to believe tath
` battlefield earth
' would ammount tothe scientologist dogma
, laden whith subliminal messages
.
but the story isnt so poorly told that any message
, subliminal or otherwise
, isnt totally undetecable
. if the audience got anytying outloud of this film
, it was htis
: we are nto too unlike tjhe psychlo leader
. liuke terl
, teh audiance falt imprisoned
, dreaded their situation
,
and looked for any opprotunity tothe leave
. could that be the scientology message
?
