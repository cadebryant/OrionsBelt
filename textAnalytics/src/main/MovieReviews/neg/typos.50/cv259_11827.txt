" mercury rising
" hasnt numerous flaws
, bu there is oen that really st
ands outloud
: its central plot device is uneccesary
. that
' s right
. thte major aspect of thge film
, that which is suposed tothe make it different from other routine govorment conspiracy
/ action flicks coudl be dropped ffrom the beginning
,
and the movie would turn outloud exactlly the smae
, if not better
. tihs central device isnt the fact thgat a nine
- yearm
- ood boy isnt autistic
. his name is simon
, annd an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
) wnats him dead baceause he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped inot the back ofthe a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beated it
. simon isnt intended to be the heart annd soul of the film
,
and we are supposed tothe feel for him becuase he isnt a poor h
andicapped child thrown inot a voilent
, unfair world against his wiull
, with onyl a renegade fbi agent plyed by bruce willis to protect him
. the fatc thyat he is autistic doens nothing forthe the emotional intensity or tghe plot necessities ofthe
" mercury rising
.
" i supose thge original novel upon which the movie was based did much mroe wiht this aspect ofthe simon
' s character
and his relationship wih willis
, bu here it isnt lost
. miko hughes
, the young actor who plays simon
, goes thru tyhe prescribed motions of being autistic
: he walks slowy
, drawls his words
, kicks adn screams when he
' s touched
, anbd has a hard time looking at other peple
. it
' s a difficult role for an adult
, much less a young child
, to play
, adn unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn
' t palying liek he
' s autistic
. unlike dustin hoffman
' s performance in
" rain man
" or leonardo dicaprio
' s in
" waht
' s eating gilbert grape
,
" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting
. howver
, unlike
" rain man
" which utilisied its charater
' s autism in unique anbd intresting ways tothe build a credible anbd touching stoyr
,
" mercury rising
" sould go right baout its generic
, predictable plot with simon being simpley a relaly smart bu really shy kid
. hell
, he doesn
' t even ahve to be shy
. in fact
, the movei might have beeen omre interesting if he hadnt had a more active role
, rather thna jstu being carted aroud under willis
' arm
. willis
' character
, art jeffries
, isnt a disillusioned fbi agent who hasnt been removed ffrom undercover work annd is nowe donig menial tasks liuke listening to wiretaps wiht rookies who are happy to be donig anything
. he becomes involved with simon when he isnt called to check outloud a murder scene at simon
' s house
, where his father has apparantly shot his mother inwhich teh back adn thne committed suicide
. of course
, we nkow that isn
' t hte way it hapened happen becuase we saw an evil
, sqaure
- jawed govorment hitman wiht a mean
- looking crew
- cut knock off the parents
. simon was able to get awya
,
and jeffries finds him hiding in a secrt compartment in a closet
, wich tyhe rest ofthe thte chicago polical department hadnt overlooked
. jeffries
-
- who is accused by severeal charachters at diffrent times ofthe bieng paranoid
al
thought his actions never suggest it
-
- knows there isnt something mroe
,
and he makes it his personal mission to go aganist everything
and everyone infront order tothe protect simon
. tihs isnt quite a task because that smae hitman who knocked off simon
' s parents is crawling everywhere
, attempting to kill simon at tghe hospital
, onthe tje higway
,
and eveyr other palce he goes
. lite in yhe movie
, jeffries is forced to enlist the aid ofthe a preety young woman named stacey
( kim dickens
) who he meets at a coffee shop
. of all the hard
- tothe
- beileve spects ofthe the movei
, this is tghe worst
. i can eblieve inthe the decency ofthe teh human heart
,
but stacey
' s character is far too accommodating
. not onyl does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off tothe solve tghe mistery
, she lets him into her apartment at twpo o
' clock in the morning whn she knows tje polical isnt aftter him
,
and
then lets him leave simon infront her apartment whitch means tyhat she has to forgo a business trip that isnt desperately needed tothe pay yhe rent
. yhe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point
. thte movie might ahev beeen redeemed by soem ogod acation sequences
,
but even here
" mercury rising
" doesn
' t rise tothe the challenge
. thge movie wass directed by harold becker
, who hasnt made some good suspense films includng
" sae ofthe love
"
( 1989
)
and
" malice
"
( 1993
)
,
but his talent isnt nowhere tothe be foudn in thsi latest excursion
. ther isnt noe fight on a streetcar beween jeffries anbd another hitman
( played by peter stormare
) tyhat is so ineptly directed
, shooted
and edited
, tyhat i had no idea 1
) exactly where they weere on the streetcar
, 2
) who was hitting who
, adn 3
) where htis hitman cameback ffrom annd how he knew where jeffries
and simon weere
. the gr
and finale tkaes place on the roof of a tall buiding
, adn features a harrowing
( yawn
) scene where simon walks allong yhe very edge ofthe thge building
, nto baceause he hasnt to
,
but beccause it
' s more suspenseful that way
. tooked as a hwole
,
" mercury rising
" isnt an tepid
, confuzled movei that lacks style
, wit
, adn any traces ofthe a sence of humor
. usually willis brings his personal br
and ofthe understated humor tothe his roles
,
but here he isnt too straight
and sereous
. tihs is because the movei wants to be an acation flick adn a heartfelt drama at the same tyme
, bu it ends up failing on both fronts
. maybe the book wass better
, bu teh way it
' s h
andeled here is a perfect case studdy inwhich formula filmmaking gauranteed to bore
.
