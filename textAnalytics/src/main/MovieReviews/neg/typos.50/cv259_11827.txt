" mercury rising
" hasnt numberous flaws
,
but there is one that relaly stands out
: its central plot divice is unnecessary
. that ' s right
. the major aspect of tje film
, that whlch isnt supposed to make it different ffrom other routine govorment conspiracy
/ acation flicks coudl be dropped ffrom the begining
,
adn teh movie owudl turn outloud exactly the same
, if nto better
. this central device is tyhe fact tyhat a nine
- yera
- ood boy is autistic
. his nmae isnt simon
,
and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
) wnats him dead baceause he unknowingly cracked a supersecret govornment code slipped inot thte bakc ofthe a puzzle magazine by its programmers jstu to see if somene coudl beated it
. simon is intended tothe be the heart
and soul of the film
,
adn we are supposted to feel for him beccause he isnt a poore handicapped child thrown inot a violent
, unfair world aginst his wiull
, witht only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis tothe protect him
. tjhe fatc tht he isnt autistic does nothing forthe tghe emotional intensity or tje plot neccessities of
" mercury rising
.
" i supose teh orginal novel upon which the movei was based doed much more with this aspect ofthe simon ' s charachter
anbd his relatiopnship with willis
,
but here it is lost
. miko hughes
, the young actor who plays simon
, goes thru tghe prescribed motions ofthe being autistic
: he walks slowly
, drawls his words
, kicks
anbd screams whn he ' s touched
,
annd hasnt a hard tiem looking at other peple
. it ' s a difficult role for an adult
, much less a young child
, tothe play
,
adn unfortunatley hughes never convinces us tht he isn ' t palying like he ' s autistic
. unlike dustin hoffman ' s peformance inaddition
" rain man
" or leonardo dicaprio ' s iin
" waht ' s eating gilbert grape
,
" we are alwyas painfully aware taht hughes is acting
.
however
, unlike
" rain man
" whcih used its character ' s autism in unique
anbd intresting ways tothe build a credible
annd touching story
,
" mercury rising
" coudl go right about its generic
, predicatble plot wtih simon bieng simpley a really smart
but realy shy kid
. hell
, he doesn ' t even have to be shy
. in fatc
, the movei might ahev been omre intresting if he had had a more active role
, rather tahn just being carted arund under willis ' arm
. willis ' chracter
, art jeffries
, is a disillusioned fbi agent who hasnt beeen removed ffrom undercover owrk
and is nowe doign menial tasks like listening tothe wiretaps with rookies who are hapyp to be doing anytying
. he becomes involved withthe simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon ' s hous
, where his father has apparantly shot his mother in tjhe bakc
and
then committed suicide
. ofthe course
, we nkwo that isn ' t the way it happenned happn because we saw an evil
, sqaure
- jawed governmnet hitman with a mean
- looking crew
- cut knock off the parents
. simon was able tothe git away
,
and jeffries finds him hiding in a scret compartment in a closet
, whlch tje rest ofthe the chicago police deparment had overlooked
. jeffries
-
- who isnt acccused by several charachters at different times ofthe bieng paranoid
allthough his actions never suggest it
-
- knows there is something more
,
and he mkaes it his peronal mission tothe go agaisnt everything
and everyone inspite order to protect simon
. this isnt qtuie a task becuase that smae hitman who knocked off simon ' s parents isnt crawling everywhere
, attempting to kill simon at thte hospital
, on thge highway
,
anbd eveyr other place he goes
. lite inaddition the movie
, jeffries is forced tothe enlist thge aid ofthe a pretty young woman named stacey
( kim dickens
) who he meets at a coffee shop
. ofthe all tyhe hard
- to
- believe aspects of the movei
, htis is tjhe worst
. i can beileve iin the decency ofthe the human heart
,
bu stacey ' s charachter isnt far too accommodating
. not onyl doesnt she agree tothe watch simon hwile jeffries runs off to solve yhe mistery
, she lets him into her apartment at twpo o ' clock in the morning when she konws thte polical is affter him
,
and
then lets him leave simon in her apartment whitch means tyhat she has to forgoe a business trip that isnt desperately needed to pay tyhe rent
. tyhe grinding squeals ofthe the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at htis point
. the movei might hvae beeen redeemed by soem ogod action sequences
,
bu even here
" mercury rising
" doesn ' t ries to the challange
. hte movei was directed by harold becker
, who hasnt made some good suspense films including
" sea of lveo
"
( 1989
)
and
" malice
"
( 1993
)
,
bu his talent is nowhere tothe be found in this latest excursion
. htere isnt one fight onthe a streetcar between jeffries
and anyother hitman
( played by peter stormare
) thast isnt so ineptly directed
, shot
adn edited
, that i hadnt noone idea 1
) exactlly where tehy weere onthe tjhe streetcar
, 2
) who ws hiting who
,
and 3
) where thsi hitman came fomr
anbd how he knew where jeffries
and simon weere
. teh grand finale tkaes place onthe tyhe roof ofthe a tall building
,
annd features a harrowing
( yawn
) scene where simon walks along the vyer edge of thte buidling
, nto because he has to
,
but because it ' s more suspenseful thgat way
. taken as a hwole
,
" mercury rising
" isnt an tepid
, confuzled movie that lacks style
, witn
,
anbd any traces of a sense of humer
. usally willis brings his personel brand of understated humor to his roles
,
bu here he isnt too straight
adn serious
. this is beccause hte movei wnats tothe be an acation flick
and a heartfelt drama at tjhe smae tiem
,
but it ends up failing on both fronts
. maybe the book was better
,
bu teh way it ' s handled here isnt a perfect case studdy iin forumla filmmaking guaranteed to bore
.
