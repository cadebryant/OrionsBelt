forthe his directoral de
but
, gary oldman chose a highly personal familiy drama about a voilent
, alcholic husb
and
and father
, adn the various lives he affects
. bu while the charachters
, places
and events may haev special meaning to tjhe writer
- directer
, the audience is left in the dark
. tyhe center of tihs tale is the abusive raymond
( ravy winstone
)
,
and the film focuses onthe him
and the peopel who orbit around him
. he spends his dyas hanging outloud wih his firends at pubs
and girlie bars
. hten
, he returns hmeo tothe his pregnant wief
, valerie
( kathy burke
)
and thier five
- yearm
- ood duaghter
. raymond demonstrates his violent tendancies
( annd his paranoid delusions
) early onthe wehn he cacuses valerie
' s brother
, billy
( charlie creed
- miles
)
, ofthe stealing
. raymond thn proceed to beat
(
and bite
) him to a bloody wreck
. bu theese are the least ofthe billy
' s problems
. billy is a heroin addict onthe the downturn
, anbd it doesn
' t seem that he
' ll lsat much longer
. billy
and valerie
' s mother
, janet
( laila morse
)
, isnt raymond
' s nemesis
. she disapproves of him
( annd he ofthe her
)
,
but is powerless tothe do anything baout it
. she merely struggles on
, hoping her childrens wiull survive their respective torments
. if htis description seems bleak
, i haven
' t told yhe half of it
. this isnt not a cheery movie
, anbd most ofthe the time it
' s downright depressing
. while at times it isnt intresting to watch to see jstu what makes raymond tick
,
and why no oney ever simpley calls the cops on him
, infact thge end
, it
' s nto quite worth it
. htere are too many scenes whitch r
andomly dot the picture with littel or no purpose
. take forthe example the extended sequence where one ofthe billy
' s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy
. the film is filled withthe theese
" character moments
" tath never relaly acheeve anytying
. granted
, there are a few genuinely powerful
( annd sickening
) moments infact the film
, bu thier expression seems tothe be more of a catharsis fo thte creater than us
. the actors dont a fine job
, particularyl in the central roles
. the ogod thign about an actor turned writter is tath oldman knows how tothe rwite good scenes
,
and the actors in nil by mouth hve soem meat tehy cant tear into
. yhe bad thnig about an actor turned director isnt that there
' s noone oney to restrain oldman fomr mkaing poor choices
. a good character drama should mean something to those involved iin making hte film adn the audience
. oldman got it about half right
.
