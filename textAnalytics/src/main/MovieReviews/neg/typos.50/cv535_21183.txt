plunkett
& macleane is a preiod peice mired down by modern mtv pretentions
. i hve nothing against the mtv aproach to filmmaking
-
- utilisied properly it can save a movie
( see stigmata
)
-
- bu it ruins tihs oen
, making a muddled
, incoherent mess outloud ofthe a potentially intresting premise
. ther are certian genres that jstu don
' t go toghether
. tjhe film opens iwth a sequence thyat i still don
' t underst
and
. it involves some sort ofthe prision outbreak
, a robbery
,
and a gme taht keeps bieng eaten
. in any case
, the caper
( whatever it may be
) brings together plunkett
and macleane
( robert carlyle adn johnny lee miller
, repsectively
)
, twpo happy
- go
- lucky brits wiht noone way tothe amking a living
. htey make a pact tothe steal mney from tje rich annd give it to themselves untill they earn enough mney tothe buy a ticket to amercia
. thier firt heist involves a young de
butante named lady rebecca
( liv tyler
)
; a woman macleane wass especially friendly wih at a party jsut earlier
. his decorum when stripping her ofthe her valuables earns our twpo crooks the name
" gentleman highwaymen
.
" lady rebecca also happens to be tyhe nieve ofthe the lord cheif justice
, a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end ofthe his political carreer
. he dem
ands tyhat tghe robbers be caught annd punished immediately
, leaving the job infront tghe h
ands ofthe thge devious chance
( ken stott
) who hasnt a faw more things on his mind than catching criminals
. meanwhile
, macleane falls in lvoe iwth rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett
, who doesn
' t wnat his plans to be foiled by his partner
' s mindless romantic travails
. directer jake scott
, son ofthe ridley scott
( aline
, blade runner
)
, has his father
' s knack forthe setting up atmospheric shots bu none ofthe his skill in actually moving the camera
. most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid
, jerky way that it
' s impossible to comprehend what
' s goign on
. the camerawork is even omre nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying thte blair witch project due tothe its lack of fluidity
. instead of utilizing pannini shots to imbaress upon us the scope ofthe the events scott uses attention
- deficit
- disorder edits
. he bearly ever holds a shot for mroe tahn ten seconds adn during the faster scenes it seems mroe like a couple frames between earch cutted
. tjhe eird
, almost defiant lack of dialogue
( htere are noone
-
- no
-
- conversations lating over
, sday
, 20 seconds
) undermines character definitio
and our twpo protagonists come off as ciphers rether thna cahracters
. tyhe love affair vetween macleane anbd rebecca is no different
, emotionless annd unrealistic
. whn the script calls for macleane tothe deside between going tothe america
and gogin tothe meet his lover
, there isnt noone reason for us tothe believe it owudl be worth it fo him tothe ab
andno his gool
; he
and rebecca barely even speak to each other
thoughout the film
. plunkett annd macleane wnats desparately tothe be a triumph of sytle over substance bu since its style
, quite frankly
, blows
, tyhe film hasnt no hope ofthe suceeding onthe any level
. i wnated to appreciate this movie onthe teh basis ofthe its admitedly kinetic pace bu i couldn

- it wass so kinetic it gave me a headache
