plunkett
& macleane is a perido piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions
. i have nothing agains thte mtv approch tothe filmmaking
-
- used properly it cin save a movie
( see stigmata
)
-
-
bu it ruins this oen
, makeing a muddled
, incoherent mess outloud ofthe a potentially intresting premise
. there are certian genres that just don ' t go together
. the film opens with a sequence tath i still don ' t understand
. it involves soem sort ofthe prision outbreak
, a robbery
,
annd a gme thyat keeps bieng eaten
. inwhich any case
, the caper
( whatever it may be
) brings together plunkett
adn macleane
( robert carlyle
anbd johnny lee miller
, respectively
)
, twpo hapyp
- go
- lucky brits wih noone way tothe make a living
. htey amke a pact to steal mony from tghe rich
and give it tothe themslves untli they earn enought mnoey tothe buy a ticket tothe america
. theri first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca
( liv tyler
)
; a woman macleane wass especialy friendly wtih at a party just earlier
. his decorum wehn stripping her of her valuables earns our twpo crooks the nmae
" gentleman highwaymen
.
" lady rebecca allso happens to be the niece ofthe teh lord cheif justice
, a glaringly arogant man nearing the end ofthe his political carreer
. he demands thast tghe robbers be caught
and punished immediately
, leaving thge job in teh hands ofthe the devious chance
( ken stott
) who hasnt a few more things on his mind than catching criminals
. meanwhile
, macleane falls inwhich lveo with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett
, who doesn ' t want his plans tothe be foiled by his partner ' s mindless romantic travails
. director jake scott
, son ofthe ridley scott
( aline
, blade runner
)
, hasnt his father ' s knack fo setting up atmospheric shots
but none ofthe his skill in actally moving tjhe camera
. most ofthe the acation scenes are filmed in such a repid
, jerky way that it ' s impossible to comprehend waht ' s goign onthe
. teh camerawork is even more nauseating tahn in tje purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack ofthe fluidity
. instead ofthe utilizing panning shots tothe impress apon us hte scope of the events scott uses attension
- defecit
- disorder edits
. he bearly ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds
and durig tje faster scenes it seems more liuke a cuple frames betwen each cut
. teh weird
, alomst defiant lack of dialogue
( ther are no
-
- no
-
- conversations lating over
, say
, 20 seconds
) undermines charactor definition
anbd our twpo protagonists come off as ciphers rether tahn characters
. tghe lvoe afair between macleane
and rebecca is noone different
, emotionless
and unrealistic
. wehn the script calls for macleane tothe decide bewteen gonig tothe amercia
and going tothe meet his lover
, htere isnt no reason for us to believe it woudl be worth it for him tothe abanon his goal
; he
adn rebecca bearly even speak tothe eahc otehr thoughout thte film
. plunkett
and macleane whants desparately tothe be a triumph ofthe style over substance
bu sicne its stlye
, quite frankly
, blows
, tghe film hasnt no hope ofthe suceeding onthe any levle
. i wnated to appreciate this movei onthe the basis of its admitedly kinetic pace
but i couldn ' t
-
- it ws so kinetic it gave me a headache
