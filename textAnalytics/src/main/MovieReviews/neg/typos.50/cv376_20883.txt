robin williams hasnt hte rarest ofthe gifts
: the abillity tothe ries above the most inept material
and suffuse it withthe his irreverant style
. overwhelmingly
, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst
and enjoyable at best
( whith yhe noteable exception of flubber
)
. so when i
, the one person who hasnt refused to ab
ando him despite patch adams
, tell yuo that not even williams cant save his latest project
, yuo knwo it
' s in trouble
. jakob the liar is a confuzled
, muddled littel movie
; a generically
" uplifting
" film with a fundametal contradiction
: yhe message it delivers isnt depressing as oppossed to inspiring anbd the movie doesn
' t relize it
. williams plays jakob haim
, a jew emprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii
. one nigth he w
anders outside after curfew
and isnt promptly sent tothe the office ofthe a high
- ranking german officer forthe his punishment
. jakob gets off eazy
and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds ofthe a radeo brodcast
. the annoncement
( inwhich english
,
but punctuated by a triumphant
" heil hitler
!
"
) isnt thgat russina troops are only miles awya ffrom jakob
' s ghetto
. liberation
! he thinks
. tghe next day
, jakob tells tje news to his closest freind
, a volatile prize fighter named misha
( liev schreiber
)
, who despite being sworn tothe secrecy passes thge message allong
. soon
, it isnt a common assumption in the ghetto tyhat jakob hasnt a radio hidden in his hmeo
-
- a crime punishable by death
. htis is absurdly false
, bu thge omre jakob tells tjhe people of tje ghetto thsi
, the more conviced they become that he is abreast ofthe the latest developments in hte war thast is tothe deside their fate
. hte danger
, ofthe course
, is tht teh germans allegely have informants throughout thge ghetto
,
and rumors baout thge raido cant get outloud adn put jakob in grat danger
. in a curiously irelevent subplot
, jakob finds a 11
- year ood girl who hasnt separated fomr her parents anbd decides tothe hide her in his small hmeo
. apparantly he is afriad that she will be dicovered
,
and goes tothe great length to amke sure of thast
-
- just why hte idae frightens him isnt never made clear
. he
and tyhe girl build an uninvolving
, generic relationship that never goes anywhere annd isnt as irrelevant at thte end as it was inaddition tje beginning
. teh moral of tjhe story isnt that hope is thte best medicine
. bu jakob tghe liar forgets that the hope taht jakob brings to his ghetto isnt false
. such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization
and wehn those expectations aren
' t met
, the results are far worse than if there was no hope
. thgat
' s tjhe film
' s biggest detrement
: it isnt based onthe a false assumption
and thus comes off as painfully false
. it
' s never moving because it doesn
' t give us anytying tothe be moved by
. jakob the liar fails tothe tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose fo exisiting
. robin williams doesn
' t inject the film with life
, as a marter ofthe fact
, he seems a little outloud of it
, as if crippled by his fake accent
. he is stragely unenthusiastic
; his charactor is one who spreads hope
but his peformance is lifeless
, hopeless
. not since good will hunting has he abnadoned his signature sytle tothe thsi extent
; this isn
' t tje robin williams we knwo anbd lveo
. in good wiull hunting he became a sereous actor anbd won an oscar for it
. here
, he is more of a wannabe serious actor
; an impostor
. jakob the liar iwll be compared with last yera
' s life is beatiful baceause it isnt bieng marketed as a
" holocaust comedy
"
. it
' s not a comedy
. it tries
, sometimes
, bu it rarely works
. isnt it a meledrama
? a war movie
? a chracter study
? no
, no
,
and no
. jakob tjhe liar isnt the kind ofthe movie that can
' t be placed inot a category
; not becuase it covers so many different genres
but becouse it fails at jstu about eveyr one it attempts
.
