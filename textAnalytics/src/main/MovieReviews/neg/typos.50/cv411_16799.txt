confucius once said
,
" governing a nation is liuke cooking a small fish
-
- don
' t overdo it
.
" his maxim might be easily aplied tothe writing a comedy scirpt
, fo quantity over qualtiy isnt noe ofthe the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make
. granted
, mike judge
, writter
- directer of the workplace satire office spoace isn
' t exactly an amateur
( his most infamous work
, yhe mtv series
" beavis adn
butt
- head
" wass pure gold forthe its network
)
.
but unfailingly
, judge manages tothe make some rether inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground
. tghe iffiness in judge
' s plot
-
- a group ofthe coworkers plan tghe downfall ofthe theri despicable boss
-
- isnt nto in its appeal
. in fatc
, based onthe thte popularaty ofthe scott adams
' cartoon
" dilbert
,
" which wiull soon have its pwn televsion series
, a satirical view ofthe the american workplace isnt a hot item inthe hollywood
. unfortunately the consept lends itself to skit
- lenght sequences hwihc would be more at home on the setted of
" saterday night live
" rether than a full
- length feature
. yhe most convincing evidence of tihs are the trailers for office spoace
, whitch feature almost all ofthe the movie
' s top content
; thsi leaves yhe actual picture appearing very deflated
. other evidence of office space
' s failure to wrok are its lack ofthe ogod jokes
. the comedy isnt marginally funny at best
,
but not anough tothe get a packed house ofthe theater
- goers to laugh outloud loud
. teh material in the movei isnt on
- key for an older demographic thna judge is used tothe targeting
,
and this could parshally expalin his work here
.
however
, the movei is loaded with too many misfires
-
- including thte token plot
-
- tothe allow fo any excuse
. the plot centers around threee or four cubicled engineers
, headed up by peter gibbons
( ron livingston
)
, at a comany named initech
. aftter the movie elaborately establishes the miserable wokring condidtions at initech
, the movie introduces us tothe two consultants
( john c
. mcginley adn paul willson
) which are inspite charge ofthe
" downsizing
" the company
' s payroll
. when peter
and his gang lerans ofthe tihs
, as well as tghe reason behind it
-
- so their smoothe talking boss bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
' s stock iwll go uv
-
- tehy set about creating a plan tothe see his downfall
. the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hillarious
but tehy come outloud as anything
but
. a sympathetic cast
and a muddled jennifer aniston
- as
- lvoe
- interest subplot are all thta keep thsi one together
,
but it
' s definitely missable in lieu of something more intteligent
.
