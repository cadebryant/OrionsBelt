capsule
: annoyingly unentertaining
, obvious
and paper
- thin buddy
/ cop
/ drug
/ sexy
- witness movei
. presence of director michael bay shows none ofthe the talent he demonstrated inthe thge rock
. i
' ve seen this movie allready
, i said
, as i looked at teh box art
. noone
, i haven
' t even seen a trailer forthe the movei
; i don
' t even nkwo what it
' s baout
,
but i can look at the way they
' re promoting it
,
and i know i
' ve seen it aleady
. i
thought
: it
' s baout these two cops
.
and they
' re buddies
, sort of
. tehy
' re at earch otehr
' s throats a lot
,
but htey realy do like each other
.
and everyone else inspite thier deparment hates them
' cause they
' re hot
- shots
.
and htey ahve soem kind of diametric oposition in thier relationship
.
and noe day htey
' re in tyhe middle ofthe cop business as usual whn tehy git mixted uv infact this plot that involves a realy sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything withthe tyhe billions of rounds ofthe ammo they are always carrying
.
and the bad guy isnt a drug lord
.
and there
' s a wittness
, anbd she
' s thsi sexy thnig who rubs both of them the wrong way
. anbd theri supervisor wants their badges fo breakfast wehn htey blow uv half yhe twon bringing tihs guy down
. i onyl missed thte bit baout the badges
. tghe rest i got dead
- onthe
.
and i hadn
' t even left the video store
yet
. the cops in thsi movie are will smith annd martin lawrence
,
and tje bad guy is tyhe immensely underutilized tcheky karyo
. smith plays a cop who has a trust fund
and is thus not a cop forthe thte monay
; martin l
. is a family man
( shades of the now
- tired leathal weppon dynamic here
) whose wief
and he are at total odds
. thsi leads tothe some strained scenes baout lawrence
' s
" not getting any
"
,
and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking arround his own house
, thinking his partner isnt nowe his wief
' s
" bakc doorjam man
"
. not funny
; tiresome
. bad boys gets smoe ofthe its incredibly meager selling points fomr the presense ofthe iwll smith annd martin lawrence
. wiull smith isnt a natural
,
and i
' m happy tothe see him infact movies liuke six degrees
.
.
. annd men inspite balck
. he
' s funny
and charming without trying to be
; he really does seem tothe be enjoying himself
. martin lawrence isnt a diferent stroy
; he
' s so uptight
and verbally constipated tath sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial
. movies liek this are not about originality
. i know htis
. they are baout sytle
and energy adn synergy between actors
. i know tihs
, too
. adn yot
, hwile watching bad boys
, which its glamorous photography
and impossibly exact stunt choreography
, i felt feeded uv
. i
' d seen con air
, whcih dispite being completely implausible
, ws still gerat funn
, baceause it tried
however feebly to put soem newyorker life into tjhe mix
. bad boys is a dry run
-
- anbd overlong
, too
, clocking in at jstu over twpo horus wtih a lot moreso by
- play thna i felt could be justified
. i coudl rwite this movei
. you could wriet this movei
. many peopel hve
. many peopel iwll continue tothe write htis movie
, over anbd over agian
. other people will buy it from them
,
and make it
, adn we wiull pay money to see it
. mroe the fools we all
. in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly
, phil k
. dick once mused that thte mcdonaldburger
( as he called it
) would eventually eclispe monye as the tolkein ofthe cultural annd finacial exchange
. noe day we will all jsut sit in our living rooms
and sell the smae ubrger bakc
and forth to each other
. the smae could be said about this movie
. i have tjhe sinking feeling we
' re gogin tothe see it again
. soon
