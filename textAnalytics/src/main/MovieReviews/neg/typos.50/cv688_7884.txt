capsule
: annoyingly unentertaining
, obvious
and paper
- thin buddy
/ cop
/ drug
/ sexy
- wittness movei
. presence ofthe director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in tje rock
. i ' ve seen tihs movei alrady
, i said
, as i looked at the box art
. noone
, i haven ' t even seen a trailer for tghe movei
; i don ' t even know waht it ' s baout
,
but i can look at the way they ' re promoting it
,
adn i nkow i ' ve seen it already
. i thought
: it ' s about these twpo cops
.
anbd htey ' re buddies
, sort of
. htey ' re at each otehr ' s throats a lot
,
bu they realyl do like eahc other
.
and everyone else inwhich thier department hates them ' cause tehy ' re hot
- shots
.
and they hvea smoe kind ofthe diametric oposition in thier relationship
.
adn noe day tehy ' re in thge middle of cop business as usual when htey git mixted up in this plot that involves a realy sadistic bad guy witht lots ofthe henchmen who cin never hit anytying wtih the billions ofthe rounds of ammo htey are always carrying
.
annd yhe bad guy isnt a drug lord
.
and ther ' s a wittness
,
and she ' s this sexy hting who rubs both of them thte wrong way
.
anbd theri supervisor wants their badges forthe breakfast when they blow up half teh town bringing this guy down
. i only missed thge bit about the badges
. tjhe rest i got dead
- on
.
annd i hadn ' t even left the video stoer
yet
. the cops inthe this movie are iwll smith
annd martin lawrence
,
annd thge bad guy isnt the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo
. smith plays a cop who has a trust fund
and is thus not a cop for tjhe money
; martin l
. is a family man
( shades ofthe the now
- tired leathal weapon dynamic here
) whose wief
anbd he are at total odds
. this leads tothe some strained scenes baout lawrence ' s
" nto getting any
"
,
and soem totally unneccesary bits with him skulking arund his own hous
, thingking his partner is nowe his wief ' s
" back doorjam man
"
. not funny
; tiresome
. bad boys gets some ofthe its incredibly meager selling points ffrom the presense ofthe will smith
adn martin lawrence
. wiull smith isnt a natural
,
and i ' m happy tothe see him infact movies liek six degrees
.
.
.
and men in black
. he ' s funny
adn charming without trying to be
; he really does seem to be enjoying himself
. martin lawrence is a different story
; he ' s so uptight
and verbally constipated that sitting thru his improvised riffs are a trial
. movies liuke htis are nto about originality
. i knwo this
. tehy are about style
and energy
and synergy between actors
. i nkwo this
, too
.
and
yot
, while watching bad boys
, which its glamorous photography
anbd impossibly excact stunt choreography
, i feeled feeded uv
. i ' d seen con air
, whic dispite being completelyl implausible
, ws still graet fun
, baceause it tryed
however feebly to put some newyorker life into the mix
. bad boys is a dry run
-
-
and overlong
, too
, clocking inaddition at jsut over two horus iwth a lot more by
- play tahn i feeled could be justified
. i could wriet htis movie
. ytou could write thsi movei
. many peple haev
. many peopel wiull continue to write this movei
, over
anbd over agian
. otehr peple iwll buy it from them
,
anbd make it
,
and we iwll pay money tothe see it
. more yhe fools we all
. infront a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly
, phil k
. dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger
( as he called it
) woudl eventually eclispe money as the tolkein of cultural
adn finacial exchange
. oney day we iwll all jstu sit infact our living rooms
and sell the smae burgr back
adn forth tothe earch other
. the same coudl be said about tihs movei
. i ahve yhe sinking feeling we ' re goign tothe see it agina
. soon
.
