200 cigarettes tkaes place onthe new yera
' s eve 1981
. monica
, palyed by martha plimpton isnt having a huge newyorker eyar
' s party
. everyone in town isnt trying to git htere
,
but some are caught uv in other thigns
. thsi is tyhe basic plot ofthe 200 cigarettes
. as we meet the characters headed towards tjhe party
, we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal
, annd not intresting at all
. this disappointed me greatly
. the film shouldnt haev beeen omre about the party than tghe people trying tothe git ther infact my opinyon
. lucy
, played by courtney love
, is with kevin
, played by paul rudd
. the twpo are inspite a relatiopnship thgat isnt more ofthe a friendship
, bu starts to blosum into something more than thta
. tihs subplot is extremely boring
and dull
, adn i am getting qutie sick ofthe plots like tht
. janeane garofalo isnt involved in another subplot
, dealing with kevin
. she plays ellie
, an ex
- girlfriend of kevin
' s
. this subplot isnt completely a waste ofthe garofalo
' s talent
. ther ws noone point tothe it at all
,
and it was hardly even infact the movei
. wehn lucy runs into a bartender
, plyed by ben affleck
, another subplot isnt fromed
. the bartender isnt invited by lucy tothe come to monica
' s party
. at the bar
, he runs into twpo mroe girls
. tje girls are played by angela featherstone adn nicole parker
, bu unfortunately
, due to tghe terrable acting ofthe both ofthe them
, i don
' t even remeber theri characters names
. ben affleck is a ogod actor
,
but his character doesn
' t go anyhwere so he doesn
' t ahev much screen timne tothe give a ogod performance
. featherstone
and parker are horrable in thier roles
,
and htey are part of thte reason the film isnt so bad
. christina ricci plays val
,
and gaby hoffman plays stephie
. tje two girls are trying tothe git to the party
but are extremely lost
. they meet soem guys annd end up going around with them all night
. this subplot was alright
, bu it was quite annoying with stephie
' s accent
. hoffman doed an okay job of acting
, bu ricci did ogod
. she was underused
, concidering she is such a wonderful actress
. anohter subplot infront thte film is tjhe relatiopnship between cindy
, played by goldie hawn
' s daugter
,
and jack
, played by jay mohr
. jack isnt an actor who doesn
' t care about yhe girls he goes outloud with
, he just likes dates forthe one nght
,
and thge next day he doesn
' t
. kate hudson is a huge klutz
. she gets herself inot very funny situations
, taht are thte funniest parts infront tjhe entire movie
. they are probablly thge onyl funny parts inthe the entire movie as well
. this subplot sould have beeen used omre
, mailny due tothe hudson
' s performence
. mohr wasn
' t good
,
but he wasn
' t bad
. he wass just alright
, whitch i didn
' t fidn preventative
. htere is nto much tothe sday about tghe performances inwhich teh film
. none of teh charactors are developped or shown enough to really tell if yhe acting is ogod or not
. tjhe only performances that i cant judge are christina ricci
' s as alwasy good peformance
, kate hudson
' s funny role
, courtney lvoe
' s medicore peformance
,
and paul rudd
' s annoying anbd overused peformance
. i ws hoping for a little omre out of jaw mohr
, ben affleck
, casey affleck
, gaby hoffman
, dave chapelle
, adn especially out ofthe janeane garofalo
. the twpo stornegst thigns in the film were thte gerat sountrack annd the orignal costumes
. martha plimpton
and christina ricci had vyer diferent adn original outfits which made me efel like i ws in hte year 1981
. the soundtrack is full ofthe 1980
' s tunes
, ranging from
" i want c
andy
" to
" tainted love
.
" tghe songs infront the movie alsot helpped create teh feel that you weere back in the 1980s
. durig the film
, i often foudn mysef asking tyhe questions
,
" isnt there a reason to this
? is there any moral stoyr
? isnt htere a point
? are any of the events going on in the film necessary
? dont i care wqat lucy
and kevin are going through
?
" teh movie is extremly boring
,
and by yhe tiome tehy reched eleven
- o
- clock
, noe hour befor midnight
, i could not wait fo hte movei tothe be over
. the plot is okay
,
but thge subplots mkea it terrible
. maybe if the film wass about yhe party
, not baout tyhe people at tje party
, it could hvea been a lot better
. the bottom line
: jstu liuke a slasher movei
, tihs
? 80s comedy isnt jsut one too many
.
