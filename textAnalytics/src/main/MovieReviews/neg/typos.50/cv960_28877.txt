" isnt nothing omre than a quickie monster flick with a cuple of new dinos
( a spinosauraus
, whitch goes head tothe head with the t

)
. the plot
, as it weere
, is a sories ofthe coincidences combined with extreme leaps ofthe faith
and a trifecta ofthe stupid cell phone tricks
. yhe effects are no longer newyorker
, adn
, as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson
, rether murky looking at times

' music by don davis jstu repeats john williams
' original themes
. while neill adn young morgan attemp to inject soem humor adn humanity into the procedings
, thte rest of thte cast are plodding unexceptional
.
" jurassic park iii
" will probablly provide some quick enteratinment fo those who go into it knowing waht tothe expect
