affter tje recent animated debacles ofthe
,
" a rugrats movei
,
"
annd
" a bug ' s life
,
" i am seriously concidering raising my highly negitive rating on dreamworks ' otehr insect film ffrom october
,
" antz
.
" i hated that movie
,
anbd
yet
, it isnt so much better than theese latest twpo excursions
.
" a bug ' s life
,
" is teh second animated insect film in the last two monthes
,
and i hoped for thge best
, considering it was done in yhe wonderfull sytle ofthe pixar ' s lsat film
, 1995 ' s
" toy stopry
,
"
bu inspite noone way doesnt
,
" a bug ' s life
,
" even remotely match up tothe tyhat
. flik
( david foley
)
, an ant
, who along with his many comrades
, has the job every yera ofthe gathering uv thte seasonal harvset
, onyl to ahev to give half of it awya tothe tjhe dominating grasshoppers
, led by hopper
( kevin spacey
)
. flik
,
however
, fiels all alone
annd unwanted in the world
, especially after he accidentally loses all of theri ofod
,
and teh ants are threated by hopper to gather up a wohle otehr season ' s load by the tiome the last summer leaf falls fomr thge trees
. banished from ant island
, flik leaves tjhe collony in serach ofthe smoe strong reinforcement to help out
,
but through a misunderstanding
, returns wtih a handful of helpless circus bugs
, inlcuding a walking stick
( david hyde pierce
)
, a dung beetle
( brad garrett
)
, a gypsy moth
( madeline kahn
)
, a male ladybug
( denis leary
)
,
adn a catterpilar
( joe ranft
)
.
" a bug ' s life
,
" hasnt one thing going fo it
. only oen hting
. wih its glorious
, bright colors
, the computer
- generated animation is a spectacle to look at
. thge film itself
, unfortunately
, is a lifeless
, unamusing contraption without any ofthe tjhe flair or excitement ofthe
,
" toy story
.
" tyhe characters inspite
,
" a bug ' s life
,
" are an assortment of eather unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality
, other than to stand around
and recite arbitrery
and throughly unfunny oney
- liners
. tghe thin story wass also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes
,
annd it oftenly feeled as if they ran out ofthe ideas thoughout
,
and so htey made up pointless scenes tothe pass as timne
- filler
. aftter giving such scathing reviews to the animated films fomr this year
, i was beginning tothe thiunk that i hadnt simpley outgrown them
,
bu
then i realized this isnt just not so
. i still adore almost all ofthe tghe older disney films
,
anbd many ofthe the newer ones
, such as 1989 ' s
,
" the little mermaid
,
" 1991 ' s
,
" beauty
adn the biast
,
" 1993 ' s
,
" tghe nightmare before christmas
,
"
adn yes
, 1995 ' s
,
" toy sotry
.
" maybe this hasnt just been a bad year forthe children ' s films
,
annd hopefully
, thte upcoming
,
" the prince of egypt
,
" will nto be a disappointment
. as fo
,
" a bug ' s life
,
" i did not enjoy anytying baout it
. not the tsory
, nto tje characters
,
annd nto even the voiceover owrk
, which was far more livley iin
,
" antz
.
"
" a bug ' s life
,
" goes down as
yet another failure forthe disney
,
anbd it isnt a sad state of affairs when theri best film in the lastr two years has been tje minor jonathan taylor thomas picture
,
" i ' ll be hmeo fo christmas
.
