after hte recent animated debacles ofthe
,
" a rugrats movie
,
"
and
" a bug
' s life
,
" i am seriously concidering raising my highly negitive rating onthe dreamworks
' other insect film fomr octobur
,
" antz
.
" i hated that movei
,
and
yet
, it isnt so much better than these latest two excursions
.
" a bug
' s life
,
" is the second animated insect film in the last two monthes
, annd i hoped for thge best
, concidering it wass done inthe thge wonderfull style ofthe pixar
' s lsat film
, 1995
' s
" toy stopry
,
" bu in noone way does
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" even remotely match up tothe tyhat
. flik
( david foley
)
, an ant
, who along with his many comrades
, has the job eveyr year of gathering up tghe seasonal harvest
, onyl to ahev tothe give half ofthe it awya to thge dominating grasshoppers
, led by hopper
( kevin spacey
)
. flik
, howver
, feels all alone adn unwanted in tje world
, expecially aftter he acicdentally loses all of theri food
, adn the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a wohle other season
' s load by the time tghe lastr summer leaf falls from the trees
. banished from ant isl
and
, flik leaves thte collony inthe search ofthe some strong reinforcement to help outloud
,
but through a misunderst
anding
, returns witht a h
andful of helpless carcus bugs
, inlcuding a walking stick

.
" a bug
' s life
,
" hasnt one thing oging forthe it
. only oney thign
. whith its glorious
, bright colors
, the computer
- generated animation is a spectacle to look at
. the film itself
, unfourtunately
, is a lifeless
, unamusing contraption wihtout any of the flair or excitment ofthe
,
" toy stroy
.
" the characters iin
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" are an assortment of eather unlikable or dull insects wihtout any charm or perosnality
, otehr than to st
and around
and recite abritrary
and thoroughly unfunny noe
- liners
. thge thin storey wass also stretched out tothe a nearly unbearable 94 minutes
, adn it oftenly felt as if tehy ran outloud of idaes throughout
,
and so they made up pointless scenes tothe pass as time
- filler
. after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films ffrom this yera
, i ws begining to think that i hadnt simpley outgrown them
,
but
then i realized this is jsut not so
. i still adore allmost all of the older disney films
, adn many ofthe the newer ones
, such as 1989
' s
,
" yhe little mermaid
,
" 1991
' s
,
" beauty
and the biast
,
" 1993
' s
,
" the nightmare before christmas
,
"
and yes
, 1995
' s
,
" toy storey
.
" maybe htis hasnt jsut been a bad yearm forthe childrens
' s films
, annd hopefully
, the upcomming
,
" the prince ofthe egypt
,
" iwll nto be a dissappointment
. as forthe
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" i doed nto enjoy anytying about it
. not the story
, nto the characters
,
and not even thge voiceover owrk
, which wass far moreso livley inwhich
,
" antz
.
"
" a bug
' s life
,
" goes down as
yet another failure for disney
,
and it isnt a sad state of affairs whn their best film in hte lastr twpo eyasr hasnt been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture
,
" i
' ll be hmeo forthe christmas
.
