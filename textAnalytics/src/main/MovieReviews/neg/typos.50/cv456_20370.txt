ther
? s nothing quite liek a gory anime
. relaly
,
and this is thge truth
, no otehr genre in film gets away with such violence wihtout a owrd being said infact the media about it
. with anime
, a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two
,
annd tyhe rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword
. this isnt a standart practice in anime
, or at least the half dozen or so titles that i
? ve seen
. vampire hunter d is a gory
, gory film
. if htey ever made a live version ofthe tyhe film
, it would be banned inaddition several countries
anbd given a rating somewhere below xxx
. it
? s not that it
? s gore is unique
- it
? s jsut liuke otehr gory animes
-
but this one was supposed to stand outloud beccause ofthe the complexity it
? s sotry
, cahracters
, animation
, etc
.
.
. it really didn
? t
. it wass disgusting
and groosome
, whcih overshadowed the story
, whta littel of it ther wass
. it seems thyat in yhe not too distant future vampires
and evil control thte world
, because god konws taht our local police force just cin
? t seem tothe get a handle onthe vampires inwhich tyhe movies
. noe evening
, a blond peasant girl
, drawed to look 17
and innocent
( a forshadow thta we will see her naked
, i guessed easly on it owudl be in the showfer or in a rape scene
) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto yhe private property ofthe a ten thousand year ood vampire
( insert strom thurmand joke here
.
) ofthe course
, he never put a
? noone trespassing
? sign onthe his yard
, so oney cxan
? t realy blaim her
,
but he
? s upset anyway
and demands retribution
. she gets the obligatory bite onthe tjhe neck
( aren
? t htere otehr places to git blood from
? it seems like a bite iin tje elbow would do well enough
. if it ' s good anough for doctors to draw blood from
,
thne why dont vampires stray from that sight
?
) tothe fight the spell
, she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall
, dark
adn handsome vampire hunter
( yuo guessed it
, his name is d
)
. tje vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires
, being attracted to the 17 yearm ood peasant girl
annd finding reasons not tothe talk too much
. ytou see
, liuke all ehroes inwhich these kinds of storis
, he
? s a brooder
, who
? s sole purpose in life is tothe remain really
, relaly silent
. when he speaks
, it
? s in cliches
. heroes like htis are bad when tehy
? re live
, even worse wehn animated
. later tje vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire
, who wants tothe marry the peasant girl becuase he
? s bored after 10
, 000 eyasr ofthe living
( the onyl clever vampire insight made inaddition the movie
)
, wiull vampire hunter d rush tothe savve her in time
? wiull we see blood
and intestines spattering onthe eveyr palce imaginable
? in it
? s defense
, the animation
, when focusing on being origional rather than recycling anime slicing
, coudl at times be origional
. hte tlaking hand was clever
-
and i htink the insperation fo a skateboard
- realted logo
.
anbd thta
? s thge best defense i can think ofthe
. i understand thta vampire hunter d is suppossed tothe be a fave amoung anime fans
,
but i realyl don
? t see it
. it
? s an excuse tothe watch blood dripping from teeth
, blood exploding outloud ofthe eye sockets
anbd horses necks
,
and most importantly
, liek all voilent anime
, it isnt an excuse to see animated breasts
. why
? what is the point ofthe thta
? maybe i have tothe understand the genre
annd look past thge obsessive gore
and mysogny
. i
? m not a prude
, i just don
? t thikn it
? s warranted
. it puts itself so far outloud inwhich front ofthe thte movei thgat everthing eles gets lost
. isnt there a neccesity inaddition seeing a 17 yera ood infront hte showfer
? ofthe course nto
? it
? s done fo shock
. it
? s tasteless
adn despicable
.
