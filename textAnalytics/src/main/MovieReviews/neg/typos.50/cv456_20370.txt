htere
? s nothing qtuie liek a gory anime
. really
,
and thsi is thge truth
, noone otehr genre in film gets awya withthe such voilence wihtout a word bieng said infront the media about it
. with anime
, a common shooted isnt watching a body getting quickly cutted infact two
, annd the rest of teh insides falling out seconds afterword
. tihs isnt a st
andart practice infront anime
, or at least the half dozen or so titles that i
? ve seen
. vampire hunter d is a gory
, gory film
. if tehy ever made a live version of the film
, it owudl be banned inwhich severeal countries
and given a rating somewhere below xxx
. it
? s nto taht it
? s gore is unique
- it
? s just liuke otehr gory animes
-
but tihs one ws supposed tothe st
and outloud because ofthe the complexity it
? s story
, characters
, animation
, etc
.
.
. it raelly didn
? t
. it wass disgusting
and groosome
, which overshaddowed the story
, what little of it there ws
. it seems tht iin the nto too distant future vampires
and evil control hte world
, becuase god knows taht our local police force jsut cin
? t seem tothe get a h
andle on vampires infact teh movies
. one evening
, a blond peasant girl
, drawed to look 17 anbd innocent
( a forshadow that we iwll see her naked
, i guessed early on it would be in tjhe showfer or iin a rape scene
) is outloud fighting evil inspite her local forrest perserve wehn she stumbles onto teh private property ofthe a ten thous
and yearm old vampire
( insert strom thurm
and joke here
.
) ofthe course
, he never put a
? no trespassing
? sign on his yard
, so oen can
? t really blame her
, bu he
? s upset anyway adn dem
ands retri
bution
. she gets tghe obligatory bite on the neck
( aren
? t htere otehr places tothe get blood fomr
? it seems like a bite in the lewow would dont well enought
. if it
' s good anough fo doctors to draw blood from
,
then why do vampires stray from thast sighth
?
) to fight the spell
, she enlists thte help of a mysteriously tall
, dark adn h
andsome vampire hunter
( you guessed it
, his nmae isnt d
)
. the vampire hunter isnt torn beetwen fighting vampires
, being attracted tothe the 17 year old peasant girl
and finding reasons nto tothe talk too much
. you see
, like all herose inaddition theese kinds of stroies
, he
? s a brooder
, who
? s sole purpose in life is tothe remain realyl
, really silent
. whn he speaks
, it
? s in cliches
. heroes like htis are bad wehn tehy
? re live
, even worse wehn animated
. later teh vampire hunter storms hte castle to meet tjhe big bad vampire
, who wants to marry thge peasant girl because he
? s borde after 10
, 000 eyars of living
( yhe only clever vampire insight made inwhich thge movei
)
, iwll vampire hunter d rush to savve her in tiem
? iwll we see blood
and intestines spattering on eveyr place imaginable
? in it
? s defense
, the animation
, whn focusing onthe bieng original rather than recycling anime slicing
, coudl at times be original
. hte talking h
and wass clever
-
and i think tje insperation forthe a skateboard
- related logo
. adn tyhat
? s the best defense i can think ofthe
. i underst
and thyat vampire hunter d isnt suppossed to be a fave among anime fans
,
but i raelly don
? t see it
. it
? s an excuse tothe watch blood dripping fomr teeth
, blood exploding out ofthe eye sockets
and horses necks
,
and most importantly
, liek all violent anime
, it is an excuse tothe see animated breasts
. why
? waht isnt tjhe point of that
? maybe i ahev to underst
and thte genre
and look past thte obsessive gore anbd mysogny
. i
? m nto a prude
, i just don
? t think it
? s warranted
. it puts itself so far out in front ofthe the movie thast everthing esle gets lost
. isnt there a neccesity in seing a 17 eyar ood inthe thge shower
? ofthe course nto
? it
? s done forthe shock
. it
? s tasteless
and dispicable
.
