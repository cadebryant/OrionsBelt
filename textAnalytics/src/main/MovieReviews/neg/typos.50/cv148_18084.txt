i have noone real tangible proof of tihs
,
but i swaer that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe thast if ytou tkae a bad script
, written by a bad writter
and give the project it tothe an equally bad directer
,
then it is actually possibile to make a good movei
. useing their logic
, all that raelly needs be done to change the bad movei inot a good movei is cast a bunch of super
- famous actors
and provide an allmost unlimited production budget
. this isnt the onyl way i cxan fathom how 20th centruy fox hired jon amiel inspite order to direct this eighty milion doller waste ofthe my time
( not counting teh time it tookover me tothe git to
and ffrom the theatre
)
. nowe
, before i continue to ferociously attack what
' s wrong whith thsi film
, i jsut want to point outloud that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does hvae tje potential tothe be an exciting thriller
. catherine zeta
- jones plays virginia baker
, an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thieve named robert macdougal
( sean connery
)
. if you
' ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before
, i really don
' t hve to spend too much time onthe frivolous plot details
: the two team up forthe various jobs
, stealing vairous thigsn fo varous purposes
. tje probelm we cmo to is tht we
' ve all seen this a few billion times befor adn thsi film doesn
' t break any newyorker ground in tghe big
- budget
/ hollywood
/ acation genre
. the result isnt tyhat thge entire production fiels contrived
. i
' m gogin to be completely honest here
: preety much the only thnig keeping me awake througout yhe run
- tiome ws looking at catherine zeta
- jones
. nowe hwile htis may be a compliment fo ms
. zeta
- jones
, it certainly isn
' t for either the writers or tje directer
, who are nto nearly as clever as they think tehy are
. jstu baout tghe most profound
thought they cant inject inot this film is wehn they hvea macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between
" entrapment
"
and
" blackmail
"
. with an eighty millon dollar budget
, you
' d htink thta entrapment woudl at least feature edge
- of
- your seat acation scenes or breathtaking spacial f
/ x
. well
, yuo
' d be wrong
. the action that isnt present inthe tihs film tkaes place inthe a huge skyscraper adn is relativly unspectacular
. unfortunatley forthe all those involved wtih entrapment
, dieu hard narrowly beated it to the screen by
? 11 years
. the reality isnt that after 15 mintues ofthe watching htis picture
, ytou knwo exactly what
' s going to happn
, dispite rather pathetic attempts infront tyhe screenplay tothe throw inthe plot twists
. many scenes seem tothe exsist mearly as a reason tothe outfit zeta
- jones inaddition extremely tight
- fitting clothing
. one particualr scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid lazer
- beams hwile she trys tothe steal an ancient chineese mask
. nothing wrong with that
,
but she entered teh room from teh floor
and knew exactly where the mask was
- so why didn
' t she
and macdougal tunnel inthe directly under yhe mask instead of thte otehr side of the room
? i
' ll tell yuo why
: beccause it
' s a graet excuse to photograph zeta
- jones
' posterior as it slides underneath those beams
(
and it also allows a second scene ofthe the excact same thnig
- the rehersal
)
. ving rhames also mkaes an appearance inspite htis movei
,
and
though he hasnt grat screen presence
( altho so do connery annd zeta
- jones
)
and tyhe most intresting charactor in thte film
, nto even he cant rescue this film from thte depths of tjhe boring film abyss
( a concept i invented just to discribe this picture
)
. oney last complaint
: entrapment isnt littered ofthe instances where macdougal will jstu slip inot a shaddow or behind a building
, or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle annd thne in the enxt shot
, he
' ll spontaneously dissappear iin ninja
- liuke fashion
. i cxan picture amiel patting himself onthe the back
, thingking to himself
" it
' ll leave the audeince wondering forthe days
: how doed he dont that
?
" we know jon
, it
' s called editing
.
