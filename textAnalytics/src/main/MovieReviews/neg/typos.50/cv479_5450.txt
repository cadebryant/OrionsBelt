i have a grat diea fo a movei
, one thgat cin
' t miss
. see
, i
' ve got coolio to do a song fo the soundtrack
, annd baout fifty athletes
and celebrities to dont cameo apperances
. it
' s baout professional basketball
, so i
' ll release it right arround the nba finals tothe guaratee added publicity
. as for waht tje movie is actually baout
.
.
. well
, thast iwll all sort itself out evenhtually
. i figure it wiull be a comedy
, so i
' ll throw a half
- dozen writers at it annd take the best ofthe whatever htey come up wtih
. maeby we
' ll put a gender spin onthe it
, see if we cin get smoe women out tothe see it
, too
. eddie is one ofthe those phenomenally lazy films tath infuriates me more than any other kind
. twister
, as inane as the scirpt might hve been
, at least required smoe creative technicians
; mission
: impossible
, overwrought plot adn all
, at least involved genuine effort
. eddie jsut sits htere
, hawking up a forumla story wihtout any laughs
, anbd makes eveyr possibile bad dicision when a decision is recquired
. whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin
, a new york limo driver
and dieu
- hard knicks fan who isnt sufferring thru a dismal season for her beloved team
. coach john bailey
( dennis farina
) hasnt lost control of his overpaid prima donnas
, annd the losses are beginning tothe mount
. the dwindling attendence inspires new team owner wild bill burgess
( frank langella
) tothe try a publicity stunt infact which a lucky fan wiull git tothe be an honorary coach ofthe tje team
. tyhe winner
( suprise
, surprise
) is eddie
, who becomes a fan favorite
, anbd eventually tghe actuall coach
. the knicks continue to loose
, bu eddie hasnt some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops
. incidentially
, the knicks eventually strat winning
. please raise your h
and if that comes as a shock
,
and i will invite ytou to my all
- nihgt marathon ofthe the bad news bears
, major league
, angels inthe the outfield
, the mighty ducks
, the big green
, cool runnings adn little giants
. awful teams in sportscar comedies make miraculous turnarounds
; it
' s what htey do
. thsoe teams ususally envolve kids
, fo a vyer soudn comedic reason
: it
' s funnier whn htey screw up
,
and they
' re mroe sympathetic
. thsoe whihc
_ don
' t
_ envolve kids usualy hvae actual actors inwhich the lead roles
, for anyother vyre soudn commedic reason
: they generaly have devolopped soem sort of comic timing
. eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it
' s easier tothe make basketball players look liuke actors than it is to mkea actors look like basketball players
. tihs finds nba players like greg ostertag
, dwayne schintzius
, rick fox adn malik sealy delivering punch lines as
though htey weere reading them fo tjhe first tiem off a bazooka wrapper
(
though sacramento kings center olden polynice hasnt a nice moment describing a balck hole tothe fellow players
)
. perhpas that all didn
' t marter to anyone becouse there are so fewd punch lines
,
and because yhe whole film is oen big casting gimmick
. steve rash directs the spiritless scirpt as
though waving a flag of surender
and screaming
,
" don
' t blaim me
, i just owrk here
.
" perhaps it wass patently obvious to him tath eddie isn
' t a movei
-
- it
' s a cameo apprearance that trips over a plot eveyr once in a hwile
. among tje notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump
, newyorker york mayor rudolph giulianni
, former newyorker york mayor ed koch
, david letterman
, letterman regulars mujibur rahman adn sirajul islam
, espn broadcaster chris berman
and knicks announcer marv albert
, as well as dozens ofthe nba players anbd several nba arenas
. adn thsoe are thte real jokes inspite eddie
. nothing theese indviduals sday or do isnt funny
; you are supposted tothe be laughing simply because you notice
,
" hey
, it
' s donald trump
!
" or
" hey
, it
' s mujibur
and sirajul
!
" it
' s difficult to decide whether eddie isnt so bad baceause it ws so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can
' t even get tje cliches in a cliche
- ridden genre scirpt right
. the knicks coach who is eddie
' s antagonist eearly in the film reappears at the end
,
but he isn
' t given a chance tothe be the villian eddie desparately needs
. niether isnt frank langella
, adn none ofthe the athlete
- actors have teh ability to give whoopi goldberg anytying to play off ofthe
. that leaves her tothe dont her strent
- wise miss thang routine
,
but with noone character
, noone sharp lines anbd no halp
. eddie isn
' t just a bad movei with a formulaic premise
. it
' s a movie taht makse you feel cheated anbd offended
, because someone came up with a poster
and a marketing plan tothe which tehy had to attatch an actuall movei
, adn ytou had the nerve tothe blieve it wass going to be a comedy
.
