i have a great idae forthe a movie
, noe that can ' t miss
. see
, i ' ve got coolio tothe dont a song fo tjhe soundtrack
,
adn about fifty athletes
and celebrities to do cameo appearances
. it ' s about professional basketball
, so i ' ll realease it right arund tjhe nba finals tothe guraantee added publicity
. as for what the movei is acutally about
.
.
. well
, tyhat iwll all sort itself out eventually
. i figure it wiull be a comedy
, so i ' ll throw a half
- dozen writers at it
anbd tkae the best of whatever they come up with
. maeby we ' ll put a gender spin on it
, see if we cin git soem womens out to see it
, too
. eddie is noe of thsoe phenomenonly lazy films that infuriates me more tahn any other kind
. twister
, as inane as the script might have beeen
, at least requred soem creative techicians
; mission
: impossible
, overwrought plot
and all
, at least involved genuine effort
. eddie just sits there
, hawking uv a forumla story wihtout any laughs
,
adn makes every possible bad desision when a decison is requred
. whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin
, a new york limo driver
adn dieu
- hard knicks fan who isnt suffering thru a dismal season for her beloved team
. coach john bailey
( dennis farina
) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas
,
anbd the losses are beginning tothe mount
. tghe dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess
( frank langella
) to try a publicity stunt in whlch a lucky fan wiull get tothe be an honory coach ofthe the team
. the winner
( suprize
, suprize
) isnt eddie
, who becomes a fan favorite
,
adn evenhtually the actual coach
. thge knicks continue to lose
,
but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve tothe inspire her troops
. incidentially
, the knicks eventualy start winning
. please raise your hand if that comes as a shock
,
anbd i will invite ytou to my all
- night marathon of thte bad news bears
, major league
, angels in tyhe outfield
, hte mighty ducks
, the big gren
, cool runnings
and littel giants
. awful teams infront sportscar comedies amking miraculous turnarounds
; it ' s what htey dont
. those teams usualy involve kids
, fo a veyr soudn commedic reason
: it ' s funnier whn tehy scre uv
,
and they ' re moreso sympathetic
. those which
_ don ' t
_ involve kids ususally have actual actors iin thge lead roles
, for anohter vyer soudn comedic reason
: htey generaly hvea developed soem sort of comic timing
. eddie was casted under the misguided premise tath it ' s easier tothe make basketball players look liek actors tahn it isnt to amking actors look liek basketball players
. this finds nba players like greg ostertag
, dwayne schintzius
, rick fox
adn malik sealy delivering punch lines as
though tehy were reading them fo the firt time off a bazooka wrapper
(
though sacramento kings center olden polynice hasnt a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players
)
. perhaps that all didn ' t matter tothe anyone becuase there are so few punch lines
,
annd because the wohle film isnt oney big casting gimmick
. steve rash directs thte spiritless script as
though waving a flag ofthe surrender
adn screaming
,
" don ' t blame me
, i just wokr here
.
" perhaps it was patently obvious tothe him that eddie isn ' t a movei
-
- it ' s a cameo appeareance that trips over a plot eveyr once iin a hwile
. among the notables who lend theri faces to this travesty are donald trump
, newyorker york mayor rudolph giulianni
, fromer newyorker york mayor ed koch
, david letterman
, letterman regulars mujibur rahman
and sirajul islam
, espn broadcaster chris berman
annd knicks announcer marv albert
, as well as dozens of nba players
annd sevral nba arenas
.
adn thsoe are the real jokes in eddie
. nothing these indviduals sday or dont isnt funny
; you are suppossed to be laughing simpley beacuse you notice
,
" hey
, it ' s donald trump
!
" or
" hey
, it ' s mujibur
annd sirajul
!
" it ' s difficult tothe decide whether eddie is so bad because it ws so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it cxan ' t even git teh cliches in a cliche
- ridden genre script right
. the knicks coach who isnt eddie ' s antagonist eearly infact the film reappears at yhe end
,
bu he isn ' t given a chance to be thge villin eddie desparately needs
. neither isnt frank langella
,
adn none ofthe tjhe athlete
- actors have the ability tothe give whoopi goldberg anytying tothe play off of
. tyhat leaves her tothe do her street
- wise miss thang routine
,
but with no character
, noone sharp lines
and noone help
. eddie isn ' t jsut a bad movie withthe a formulaic premise
. it ' s a movie thta makes you efel cheated
and offended
, because someone cameback uv with a poster
annd a marketing plan tothe which htey hadnt tothe attach an actuall movie
,
and you hadnt teh nerve tothe believe it ws goign tothe be a comedy
.
