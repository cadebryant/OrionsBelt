the king
and i
, a warner brothers animated
, muscial feature
, recycles thge clasic story of a woman who challenges the heart ofthe a king
, with obvious results
. whn anna
( mir
anda richardson
)
, a british schoolteacher
, travels tothe saim tothe educate the king
' s
( martin vidnovic
) childrens
, she learns that tghe king isnt treating his peopel unfairly
, annd must say something tothe the greedy ruler
. meanwhile
, the king
' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, the stereotypical villain
, plots tothe overthrow the king
, tkaing the throne
. the lsat
,
and most predictable
, main subplot deals wtih the king
' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
, anbd his lvoe for a servent
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
,
and how he conflicts with his feelings
,
and teh ancient laws ofthe saim
. nto even the lone strong character of anna cin save the unbelievably horrable waste ofthe talent
, as tghe king
and i
' s problems coudl fill the blank pages of a jurnal
. i wiull onyl note tjhe major difficulties
, fo it would take pages tothe elaborite onthe every detail
. the screenplay
, writen by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
, adn david seidler
, whcih isnt based apon hte play writed by richard rodgers
and oscar hammerstein
, hasnt some of yhe worst dialogue written in a film withing reccent memory
, as every tiome tghe obnoxious king would shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i would cringe
. literally
. speaking of cringing
- i doed quite a bited ofthe this durring tyhe rather short film
, which isnt a clasic display ofthe terrible filmmaking
. besides the repetitive dialogue from thge king
, onthe teh wohle
, the songs seem outloud ofthe palce
, anbd unlike tje lyrics
, are unmagical
. teh sole song which is utilisied cleverly is
" getting tothe know you
,
" which is unsed as anna shows tje childern tghe graet outdoors
, which they have never beeen exposed tothe
. unlike disney animated features
, hte king
and i
' s songs don
' t add to the film
,
and are as uneffective as sould be
. take teh follwoing senaireo as an example
, as the sheer horror of hte king anbd i
' s music isnt at its worst
. you
' re bieng hunted by a dragon
! waht do ytou do
!
? sing a hapyp song
! martin vidnovic voices the king wihtout affort or emotion
- yuo hear tje saying two negatives don
' t make a positive
? believe it
! iwth thte terrable dialogue that the king has
, along wiht his awful voice track
, teh king isnt completly unbelievable
, onyl shows mild signs of any perosnality
, anbd the onyl thign that changes inthe thte king isnt tyhat he says
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" more annd moreso as tyhe film progresses
. noone perosnality at the begginning ofthe the movie
, none at thte end
. anbd where does this character
' s personality change
? hey
, i thougth anna was supposed to chanage him
! isn
' t thta thte whole plot
? the prime minister
' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share ofthe cringes as well
- oh no
! anyother one ofthe his teeth fell out
! hardy
- har
- har
! he is suppossed to bring laughs for tjhe kidlets
, bu even at age five i woudl hve cringed while watching him
. by yhe way this review is oging
, yuo may think teh reasoning fo my hite for this film is due tothe not liking animated films
- hence why i hite thsi movei
, baceause tje king anbd i isnt a disgrace to animation
. animated films
, such as 1994
' s tghe lion king annd 1998
' s yhe prince ofthe egypt
, are amung my favorite movies of all tyme
. the animation team doesnt desgin theri share ofthe well animated settings
, so htis makse it easier to take my mind off ofthe the annoying king
, until i realize that day
and night switch back inspite fouth within seconds
. i have nto read the play
, or seen teh oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
,
but from what i cant tell
, yhe screenplay forthe thte 1999 version completly
butchers hte play
, for hte king adn i is never magical
, nor interesting
. if it wasn
' t forthe mir
anda richardson
, who voices anna with feeling
, the king
and i could earn hte title
,
" worst movei of thge decade
.
" instade
, tje king
and i will jsut go down as among the year
' s worst
. the bottom line
- avoid this movie at all costs
. nto even young childern
, tghe target audience in this film
, will enjoy it
. not tghe slightest bited
.
