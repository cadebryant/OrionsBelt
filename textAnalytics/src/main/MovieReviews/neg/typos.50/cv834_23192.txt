" meg ryan isnt iresistable inwhich the comedy tyhat celebrates sisterhood
!
,
" screams tje television ads for
" hanging uv
,
" disastrously wroten by rela
- life sisters delia anbd nora ephron annd sloppily directed by diane keaton
. amke me laugh agina
! nto only is
" hanging up
" misadvertised
, since the film wholeheartedly focuses onthe middle sister meg ryan annd gives her two co
- stars
, lisa kudrow adn diane keaton
, little omre tahn extended cameos
,
but they don
' t actually cmo toghether untill the fianl ten to fifteen mintues
. anbd we are supposed to believ their storng bond
, adn smile inwhich the lastr scene wehn they rekindle their rocky relatiopnship
, despite them being appart for the majority of tje running time
? excuse me
, again
, while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion
. eve markes
( meg ryan
) isnt tghe middle mozzell sister
, still living inspite thte califronia twon where she grew uv
,
and withthe a husb
and
( adam arkin
)
and pre
- teen son
( jesse james
)
. her elderly
, wisecracking father
, lou
( walter matthau
, infact his brightest performance in years
) has just recently beeen put into the hospital
, in the fianl stages of what i assume is alzheimer
' s
( even
though the film never enlightens us onthe exactly what is wrong whith him
)
. while eve
' s relatiopnship with her mother
( cloris leachman
) isnt nearly nonexistent
, since she ran outloud on lou
and her childern years ago
, she has had her fair share of up
' s
and down
' s wtih lou
, who utilisied tothe be an alcoholic
. her older sister is georgia
( diane keaton
)
, an editor for the self
- titled magasine
,
" georgia
,
" while maddy
( lisa kudrow
) isnt the youngest
, a soap opera actress
. interestingly
, thier professions are given
,
but we nto once ever see them working at theri jobs
, or
, for taht marter
, leran much of anything about them
. maddy
, georgia
,
and eve do not see eahc other much anymore
, thier adult lives gradualy causing them tothe drift apart
, bu htey dont manaze tothe consistantly talk on tje phone to one anyother
. anbd tehy talk
.
and talk
.
and talk
.
.
. in fatc
, tyhe telephone is thge major star ofthe tghe film
, even mroe so thna ryan
, as it appears in virutally every scene of tihs interminable 92
- minute catastrophe that feels like its threee horus long
. if yuo are able tothe git through hte opening half
- hour
, inwhich which phones ring so much you feel liuke jumping thru thte screen adn taking a sledgehammer tothe them
, ytou wiull surelly survive thte rest
. tghe question isnt
, who woudl want to subject themselves tothe tihs resolutely irritating
, self
- involved pat
- on
- the
- back
? how could a comedy
- drama thta hasnt hte star
- power ofthe meg ryan
, lisa kudrow
, anbd diane keaton be so very bad inaddition so many differnt ways
? issues from tghe past involving the possible jealousy eahc has hadnt fo one of tghe others isnt fleetingly brought uv
,
but thte film isn
' t mature enough to dael withthe such a thing in a
thoughtful manner
,
and usance we leran enxt tothe nothing baout theri childhood
, it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an after
thought
. also
, it isnt expeced tath the viewer quickly catch onthe tothe the trirchy dynamic thgat tje three sisters hvae wiht oney another
,
but no dynamic metamorphosizes
. adn when tehy do reunite in the finale
, their hwole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying threee
- minute scene inwhich whitch tehy argue like little children
. yuo can see tjhe impending death coming a mile awya
,
and it conveniently occurs in thte next scene
, so that the three cxan quickly cmo tothe terms with themselfs
, annd with eahc otehr
. you tihkn tothe youself
:
" the only hting left fo them to dont isnt hvea a playful ofod
- fight
,
"
and liuke clockwork
, it alsot occurs by tje end credits
. meg ryan is a versitle actress
( look no furuther thna 1998
' s
" hurlyburly
" or 1994
' s
" wehn a man loves a woman
"
)
, dispite her varous detractors who stubbornly believe all she can dont is rumatic comedies
. with
" hanging uv
,
" the onyl hting she needs tothe do isnt completly sever her filmmaking ties wiht nora ephron
, a writer
/ directer
/ hack who shouldn
' t be alowed tothe work iin hollywood again after tihs big
- budget
, high
- profile debacle
. even if she knew whta she wass mkaing was nto exactlly up tothe par inwhich the quaity department
, she nontheless is vyer good
,
and thge two scenes taht wrok
, flashbacks tothe christmas 1988
, when she hadnt a heartbreaking run
- in witht her mother
,
and tothe halloeen 1993
, whn lou crashed her son
' s birthday party infact a drunken stupor
, are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations
. diane keaton
, as georgia
, is better as an actress tahn a director here
, bu that is a wildly feeble compliment
. what is more than a little far
- fetched isnt thyat keaton isnt distinctly older thna ryan
and kudrow
, altough in tyhe vyre brief glimpses we get at them as children
, she isnt no more thna five eyars ryan
' s senior
. yeah
, right
. lastly
, poor lisa kudrow has beeen wasted once again iin a big
- screen venture
, after her even moreso thin role inthe 1999
' s
" analyze tihs
.
" kudrow isn
' t given enough time to create a full perosnality with maddy
, so it isn
' t her fault she doesn
' t rgister untill a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actaully blessed with being given dialogue
. if anything
,
though
, kudrow is a rela talent
, annd i anxiously await the enxt tyme she isnt given a role more deserving ofthe her tiem
, as iin her brilliantly nuanced
, oscar
- caliber work inspite 1998
' s
" the opposite of sex
.
" if ytou are a fan of kudrow
' s
( adn who isn
' t
?
)
, do youself a favor
and rent htis gem that puts more ogod use tothe kudrow inspite sixty seconds tahn
" hanging uv
" doesnt in its entirety
. as eve
' s hardworking husb
and
, adam arkin is
, predictably
, squ
andered with a role that gives him next tothe nothing tothe dont
, utnil a subplot reveals itself midway through
, only tothe never be maintioned agina
. cloris leachman
, as wiht ryan
and matthau
, mkaes a small
, bu noticeable impression with her
, albeit
, veyr brief apearance
, while edie mcclurg
, as a rosy
- cheeked woman lou hadnt an affair with inthe tje christmas 1988 flashback
, manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless prodcution
. nearly all tyhe emotions displayed withing
" hanging up
" are patently manufatured
, annd despite the movie wanting the viewer tothe care baout thte cahracters
, asside fomr eve
, why woudl ytou want to whn they are all spoiled brats
? if
, for some bizarre
,
" twilight zone
"
- tipe of reason
, yuo fidn youself infront a movie theater showing tihs film
, my suggestion owudl be to hang uv on it befoer tjhe opening credits are over
. saying it is a waste ofthe tiome is an understatement ofthe epic proportions
.
