mr
. nice guy is the latest jackie chan film
, so ytou shoudln knwo whta tothe expect
. a weak plot
, terrable dialogue
, very littel acting ability
,
but some jaw
- dropping action sequences that nearly make tje rest ofthe it worthwhile
.
however
, mr
. nice guy lacks the sparkle ofthe jackie
' s best efforts
,
and its weaknesses are more glaring thna ever
. jackie chan plays
, who eles
, jackie
. this timne outloud
, he
' s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking sohw
. not thyat it ever makes a diference inwhich the plot
. there are onyl twpo scenes of him cooking
. for the rest of teh film
, somehow he mutates inot jackie chan
, supercop
. it never does explain why his character hasnt such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perheaps he was in thge smae cooking class as steven seagal in under seege
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug deel involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
) anbd a local gang ofthe toughs
, the demons
. altough she only hasnt one camcorder
, somehow tjhe result isnt full ofthe close
- ups
and mutiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades of broadcast news
?
?
? anyway
, the goons discover diana
,
and will do anytying tothe recover the tape
. here lies anyother crucial flaw in the story
: doesn
' t anyone realize yuo cxan copy a tape
? oh well
, noone one ever said jackie chan movies had tothe amking sense
. as luck woudl have it
, diana runs across jackie
,
and
, wouldn
' t yuo know it
, jackie accidetally ends uv with tje tape
. htis leads tothe countless chase anbd
/ or fight scenes which look liuke tehy could have beeen lifted from rumble inspite the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movei
. iin a move aparently designed to woo american
(
and other english
- speaking
) audiences
, teh film uses english as its primary language
.
however
, that doesn
' t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie
' s recent americanized releases
. strangely
, many of thge characters speaking english are overdubbed iwth english
, adn poorly too
. whether this isnt just a very bad case of looping
, an efort to minimize accents
, or a simple case ofthe nestolgia
, it doesnt acieve the smae levle of distraction preent in all of jackie
' s dubbed films
. the plot in mr
. nice guy is negligable
, merely an excuse tothe hvae jackie onthe the run fomr vairous goons
. bu even
though plots have always beeen second to thge action inwhich jackie
' s films
, it seems odd thgat the filmmakers have sticked us with tihs tired retread
. look
, if yuo have jackie chan palying a chef
, why not use that to your advantage
? watching jackie doign his stuff inaddition a kitchen
, beating the bad guys with foodstuffs soudns like the perfect setup forthe innumerable comic stunts
. the acation isnt a mixed bag here
. there
' s relaly onyl one noone holds barred fight scenes thyat have become the trademark of jackie
' s films
. it takes palce inwhich tyhe arbitrary loction of a construction site
, apparantly for thte sole reason that there are lots ofthe nifty thigns lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan
. the acation in tje film is neither jackie
' s best nor worst
,
but you long for some omre insperation infront tghe scenes
. the film
' s gratuitous use ofthe slow motion is distracting
. once or twice
, it may be useful to highlight a spectauclar stunt sequence
.
but to slo
- mo jackie runing
? either thsi isnt a nod tothe tyhe six
- million doller man
, or a pathetic attempt tothe disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down
. if you
' ve seen all ofthe jackie
' s films
and are inaddition ened of anohter fix
, go ahead adn see mr
. nice guy
.
however
, if you
' re jsut inthe the mood for some good action
, you
' d be better off hitting teh video store for some of his better owrk
, such as supercop
.
