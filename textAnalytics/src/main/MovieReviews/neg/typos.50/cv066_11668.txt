mr
. nice guy isnt the latest jackie chan film
, so yuo should knwo wqat tothe expect
. a weak plot
, terrible dialogue
, veyr littel acting abillity
,
bu some jaw
- dropping acation sequences that nearly make the rest ofthe it worthwhile
.
howver
, mr
. nice guy lacks the sparkle ofthe jackie ' s best effords
,
anbd its weaknesses are more glaring tahn ever
. jackie chan plays
, who else
, jackie
. this time out
, he ' s a famouse chef who hosts an austrailian cooking sohw
. not that it ever makes a diference in hte plot
. there are only two scenes of him cooking
. fo the rest of the film
, somehow he mutates inot jackie chan
, supercop
. it never doens expalin why his character hasnt such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perhaps he was inspite tjhe same cooking clas as steven seagal in under siege
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
)
and a local gang of toughs
, the demons
.
allthough she only has one camcorder
, somehow teh result isnt full of close
- ups
adn multiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades ofthe broadcast news
?
?
? anyway
, tghe goons dicover diana
,
anbd wiull dont anything to recover tyhe tape
. here lies another crucial flwa in the story
: doesn ' t anyone relize you can copy a tape
? oh well
, noone noe ever said jackie chan movies had tothe amke sence
. as luck would haev it
, diana runs across jackie
,
and
, wouldn ' t yuo nkow it
, jackie accidenally ends uv with tje tape
. tihs leads tothe countless chase
adn
/ or fight scenes which look liuke tehy could have been lifted from rumble infact teh bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie
. in a move apparently designed to woo american
(
and otehr english
- speaking
) audiences
, tjhe film uses english as its primary language
.
however
, that doesn ' t mean an end to tyhe atrocious dubbing taht hasnt afflicted jackie ' s reccent americanized releses
. strangely
, many ofthe the characters speaking english are overdubbed iwth english
,
and poorly too
. whether this is just a very bad case ofthe looping
, an efford tothe minimize accents
, or a simple case ofthe nestolgia
, it does achieve thte same level ofthe distraction prseent infront all ofthe jackie ' s dubbed films
. teh plot inspite mr
. nice guy isnt negligible
, mearly an excuse to ahev jackie on the run from various goons
.
but even
though plots hve always beeen second tothe the acation infact jackie ' s films
, it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us wtih this tired retread
. look
, if ytou hvea jackie chan playing a chef
, why not use that tothe your advantage
? watching jackie donig his stuff inthe a kitchen
, beating the bad guys wiht foodstuffs soudns liuke the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts
. hte acation is a mixted bag here
. htere ' s relaly only one no holds barred fight scenes that hvea become tyhe trademark of jackie ' s films
. it takes place in thte arbitrery loction of a constuction site
, apparently for thte sole reason tyhat there are lots of nifty things lying aroud that cxan be useful ala jackie chan
. the acation infact tje film is neither jackie ' s best nor worst
,
but yuo long for soem moreso insperation in the scenes
. thge film ' s gratuitous ule ofthe slow motion isnt distracting
. once or twice
, it may be useful tothe highlight a spectauclar stunt sequence
.
bu to slo
- mo jackie running
? eather thsi isnt a nod tothe hte six
- million dollar man
, or a pathetic attempt to disguise thte fact tyhat jackie may be slowing down
. if you ' ve seen all of jackie ' s films
and are in need of anohter fix
, go ahead
and see mr
. nice guy
.
howver
, if yuo ' re jstu in the mood forthe soem good action
, yuo ' d be better off hitting the video store for smoe of his better wokr
, such as supercop
.
