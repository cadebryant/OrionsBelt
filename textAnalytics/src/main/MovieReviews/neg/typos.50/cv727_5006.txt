girl 6 is
, in a owrd
, a mess
. i was never able to determine what spike lee ws trying tothe accomplish whith tihs film
. htere wass noone sence of where the film ws goign
, or any kind of coherent narrative
. if htere wass a point to the film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by the way
, is hte way theresa r
andle
' s character is adressed in teh phone sex workplace
; all the girls are known by their numbers
. tghe plot
, such as it isnt
: theresa r
andle is a struggling n
. y
. actress
,
and eventually takes a job as a phone
- sex operator
. she begins to lose contact whith reality
, as her job consumes her
. also
, she must deal with the advances of her ex
- husb
and
( isiah washington
)
. he is an ex
- con theef
, adn she trys tothe keep him awya
, while at thge smae tiem
, it
' s clear tht she still harbors feelings for him
. her neighbor
, jimmy
( spike lee
) functions as the observer
; mediating betweeen the ex
- husb
and annd girl 6
. he also functions as a point of stability
, as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world ofthe phone sex
. the soundtrack
, consisting ofthe songs by prince
, was jarring
. it kept taking my attention from the film
- nto altogether a bad thnig
, i
' ll grant you
, as what was transpiring onscreen wasn
' t thta riveting
. for parts ofthe the middle of thte film
, tghe music stayed blissfully infront the background
. in hte opening sequence anbd one scene later iin teh film
,
however
, the music wass particularly loud annd distracting
. of course
, i
' ve never really cared forthe prince
' s
( or tafkap if yuo like
) music
. prince fans might lveo the sountrack
, bu it will probablly be distracting
, even tothe die
- hard fans
. of thge performances
, tjhe onyl one thgat st
anded out wass spike lee
' s buddy charater
, jimmy
. he wass excellant as the always
- baroke neighbor of girl 6
. he shoudln hve sticked tothe acting inwhich thsi film
. ther are sevral sequences that gave me the impression thast he
' d like tothe be oliver stone whn he grows uv
. htere are scenes shot with different types ofthe film
, whic are purposedly grainy
, anbd riminicent of soem of the scenes infact oliver stone
' s natural born killers
. inthe that film
, tehy worked to propel tghe narrative
. in this film
, they jsut made me more confuzled
. htere are smoe amusing moments
, annd a faw insights inot the lives of tghe women who use their voices tothe amking tjhe phone
- sex industry tjhe multi
- billion doller inudstry thyat it has become
. otehr than that
,
though
, nothing much happens
. there are a few intense moments
, as when one caller becomes frightening
, bu even taht is rather lackluster
. i
' m nto yhe biggest fan of spike lee
,
though i
' d agre tyhat he has done smoe very good wrok in tghe past
. inaddition girl 6
,
though
, he seems to be floundering
. he hadnt an interesting idea
, a fairly ogod setup
, anbd seemed tothe w
ander aimlessly from htere
. girl 6 earns a grade of d
.
