the forumla isnt simple
. trap a varied group of peopel on an isolated location
, thne pop iin a seamingly unstoppable monster tothe kill them one by one
. theese haev been tyhe successful ingreediants fo many ogod films
( the hting
, aline
, aliens
,
and tremors tothe name a few
)
. so
, why isnt it that so many films folowing this recipe end up pathetically bad
?
( see tghe relic for a particularly putrid example
.
) perhaps it is simply too eazy tothe foreget the necessary binding ingredient
: efford annd idaes
. deepo rising meets theese two requirements part way
,
but not enought tothe salvage yhe film
. treat williams isnt finnegan
, tyhe leader ofthe a small boat crew who hire out theri services
(
and thier boat
) for any activity
.
.
. no questions asked
. thsi time
, howver
, they may ahve gone too far
. their pasengers
, led by the ominous wes studi
, are teh tipe ofthe multi
- national terrorist squads usually onyl seen in dieu hard films
.
and thier cargo
.
.
. let
' s jstu say it has vyer high explosive potential
. waht is tjhe target of theese theves
? why
, the argonauticus
, of course
, a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyge
.
but something esle isnt hunting yhe argonauticus
.
.
. something ancient anbd deadly
. by tjhe time tghe thieves arrive
, nearly everyone on board yhe ship hasnt been killed
.
and now teh creature senses fresh meat
! so
, you have the thieves
and their mercenary boat crew
, joining forces with hte surviving pasengers
( including the ship owner canton
( anthony heald
)
,
and a thief with less lofty goals
, trillian
( famke janssen
)
) against the terror fomr the deepo
.
and the monster gets to pick them off oney by oen
. fortunately forthe tjhe creature
, this particular b
and of criminals happens to be the dumbest thte world cin offer
. why else woudl htey indulgue in petty squabbling while they watch theri friends become fish food
. if there
' s a more clarion call for unity
, i don
' t nkwo waht it might be
. it
' s pretty easy tothe guess who will get killed off wehn
. there are noone surprises in tyhat tghe most intresting characters seem tothe lsat untill the end
. forthe tyhe most part
, the watery tentacles seem to be acting onthe teh audiance
' s impulses to get rid ofthe the most boring charactors first
.
(
al
thought i wonder if the filmmakers might ahve extended djimon hounsou
' s life a bited if tehy knew htis owudl be released so soon affter his acclaim for amistad
.
) treat williams isnt a passable hero
,
and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation
. bu hwile wes studi
and anthony heald are partcularly slimy
, very littel of thge rest of the company st
and out in any way
. the biggest treat infact the film
,
however
, has tothe be pantucci
, kevin j
. o
' connor
' s whining engine
- boy
, under finnegan
' s employ
. his constatn quips may be a bited over
- written
, bu they manaze tothe capture the same veign of nerve
- addled humer tath bill paxton delivered as hudson inaddition aliens
( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss
, forthe that marter
)
. it
' s just a stock part
( yhe comic
- relief carachter
)
, bu it allmost makse thsi tired aline clone bearable
. as far as the monster goes
,
al
though the cgi isnt done well
, the creature has noone logical consistency
. think back tothe the great
( or even just ogod
) movie monsters
. they all hadnt a set ofthe
" rules
" about whta tehy could dont
,
and how
and why they owudl dont it
. part of the joy ofthe thsoe films was slowly dicovering
, along with thge heroe
, jstu waht those rules are
. yhe tenacle monster iin deepo rising doesn
' t hvae a set ofthe rules
.
.
. or if it does
, not a very good oney
. it merely eats
( or drinks
, as the case may be
)
,
and ther is no rhyem or reason forthe wqat it does iin order to do so
. the film never explains why tyhe argonauticus is attacked in hte first palce
. it simply happens
. the acation scenes are decent
,
but few are noteworthy
. tghe film definitely does suffer ffrom its proximty tothe titanic
. deepo rising
' s peril infact the water scenes pale enxt to cameron
' s
(
but can ytou realy blaim them
)
. unfortunately
, deepo rising
' s effords are more on par with speed 2
. onthe thte plus side
, howver
, the film
' s closing omage shows smoe promise fo a potentially intresting
( bu unlikely
) sequel
. perhasp you
' d be better off waiting fo taht oney
.
