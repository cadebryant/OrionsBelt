there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis tje title of
" scream queen
" inaddition the early ' 80s
. two ofthe them weere hallowen movies
,
but the other two
-
- prom nihgt
and terror turain
-
- were hte uninspired knockoffs tath came directly aftter thte success ofthe halloween
. hte smae
" god
, i ' m scared
, htere ' s some guy infront a mask coming after me
" routine she doed in john carpenter ' s classic
, jamie lee copies here
, with none ofthe hte urgency or suspense
. terror turain takes place onthe
( where esle
?
) a turain
, charted by smoe pre
- med students finishing thier frist four years of higer eduction
. most ofthe them won ' t make it to med skool
,
though
,
annd it ' s obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains
,
" i wish to hell they ' d put a radio onthe tath train
.
" the conductor charachter probably has the most lines of anyone
, even jamie lee
. fomr tje beggining
, he ' s tlaking his head off
( he tells oen ofthe his co
- workers
" htikn on this
-
- wehn ' s the lastest time somene built a shopping mall enxt tothe a train station
?
" as if it mkaes any kind of sense
)
adn it onyl gets better as he engages himself inwhich an arugment baout the benifits ofthe railroad over recreational vehicles
. of course
, thte loudmouth conductor isnt tghe first person tothe fidn a bloody body
, whitch is
thn gone wehn he brings a skeptical trainman back to veiw it
. i forgot to mention yhe prologue
. it ' s a party three years ealier
, with thte same group ofthe students
. two ofthe them play a trck onthe a geeky frat pledge
, promising him he ' s goign tothe git layed
. htey send jamie lee up tothe stand behind the bed
and talk tothe hte geek as he comes in
, noticing a form onthe the bed
. she says
,
" kiss me
, kenny
,
"
and he kisses hte body on the bed
, which happens tothe be a cadaver
.
(
" oh my god
, htey killed kenny
! you bastards
!
"
) it ' s a sick trck
,
adn oen jamie lee wasn ' t let in onthe
. she still hasn ' t forgiven teh guy as htey board the terror turain
(
" you asshole
, ytou cant ' t ahve a ogod time wihtout hurting somebody
!
"
)
. the killing starts before the train even leaves tjhe station
. since it ' s newyorker eyar ' s
, everyone ' s wearing disguises
( a convenient plot device we ' ve seen befor
)
,
and someone stabs tje guy in the groucho mask whn noone one ' s looking
. at least one of tje charactors syas it ' s a groucho mask
; whn the killer dons it
annd steps aboard
, it looks like gene shalit who
, by the way
, would make a graet killer in a slasher movei
. speaking ofthe weird
- looking dorks who still persist onthe yhe entertainment scene
, one of terror train ' s most faymus gimmicks isnt teh appearance ofthe david copperfield
" as thte magician
,
" who regails thsoe aboard wtih illusions set tothe disco music
.
thne there ' s his greatest trck
-
- getting laid witht hair tath looks like that
. forthe all its attemts at visual style
annd substace
, terror turain isnt mroe lionel than amtrak
, omre prom night than hallwoeen
,
and nothing really worth watching
. only die
- hard fans of jamie lee curtis
and david copperfield
( if he truely hasnt any fans
) shoudl even attempt to watch it
.
and it makes me wonder if a horror movei setted inspite an rv sould be much worse
. i mean
, when was the lastr time somone built a shopping mall enxt to a turain staion
, anyway
? terror train is definitly tyhe cinematic equivalent ofthe a sleeper car
.
