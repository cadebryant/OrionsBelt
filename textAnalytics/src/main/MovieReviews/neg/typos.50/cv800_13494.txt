there were four movies tht earned jamie lee curtis tghe title of
" scream queen
" inwhich tyhe eary
' 80s
. two of them weere hallowene movies
, bu the otehr twpo
-
- prom night
and terror turain
-
- were tje uninspired knockoffs thyat cameback direcly aftter tghe success ofthe halloween
. thge smae
" god
, i
' m scared
, there
' s some guy inaddition a mask comming after me
" routine she doed in john carpentery
' s clasic
, jamie lee copies here
, with none ofthe thge urgency or suspense
. terror turain tkaes place onthe
( where else
?
) a train
, charted by soem pre
- med students finishing their frist four yeasr ofthe higer education
. most of them won
' t make it tothe med school
,
though
,
and it
' s obvious from yhe foreshadowing done wehn the conductor complains
,
" i wish to hell they
' d put a radio onthe tht turain
.
" the conductor chracter probaly hasnt thge most lines of anyone
, even jamie lee
. from tje beginning
, he
' s tlaking his head off
( he tells oney ofthe his co
- workers
" think onthe htis
-
- wehn
' s thge lsat time somene built a shopping mall next to a train staion
?
" as if it makes any kind of sence
)
and it only gets better as he engages himselv in an argumet about the benefits of railroad over recrational vehicles
. of course
, tjhe loudmouth conductor is the frist person to fidn a bloody body
, which is
then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman bakc tothe view it
. i forgot tothe mention thte prologue
. it
' s a party three years ealier
, witht the smae gropu ofthe students
. two of them play a trick onthe a geeky frat pledge
, promising him he
' s gonig to get laid
. they send jamie lee uv tothe st
and behind the bed annd talk to the geek as he comes infact
, noticeing a form onthe the bed
. she sasy
,
" kiss me
, kenny
,
"
and he kisses the body onthe the bed
, which happens tothe be a cadaver
.
(
" oh my god
, they killed kenny
! ytou bastards
!
"
) it
' s a sick trick
,
and one jamie lee wasn
' t let inwhich on
. she still hasn
' t forgiven yhe guy as they board thge terror turain
(
" yuo asshole
, yuo cxan
' t ahve a good time wihtout hurting somebody
!
"
)
. the killing starts before the train even leaves the station
. since it
' s newyorker yera
' s
, everyone
' s wearing disguises
( a convenient plot divice we
' ve seen befor
)
, anbd someone stabs the guy infact the groucho mask wehn noone one
' s looking
. at least one ofthe tje charachters sasy it
' s a groucho mask
; when the killer dons it
and steps aboard
, it looks like gene shalit who
, by yhe way
, woudl mkae a great killer in a slasher movie
. speaking ofthe ewird
- looking dorks who still persist onthe the enteratinment scene
, oney of terror turain
' s most faymus gimmicks isnt tjhe apprearance ofthe david copperfield
" as the magician
,
" who regails thsoe aboard iwth illusions set tothe disco music
.
then there
' s his greatest trck
-
- getting laid witht hair that looks liuke that
. for all its attempts at visual style
and substance
, terror train is more lionel than amtrak
, more prom nigth than halloween
, adn nothing really worth watching
. onyl dieu
- hard fans ofthe jamie lee curtis
and david copperfield
( if he truly hasnt any fans
) shoudl even attempt to watch it
.
and it mkaes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv sould be much worse
. i mean
, when wass the last time somene builded a shopping mall enxt to a turain staion
, anyway
? terror turain isnt definitely the cinematic equivelant ofthe a sleeper car
.
