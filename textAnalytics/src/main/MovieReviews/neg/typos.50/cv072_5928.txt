" htere will be another
,
" the ads fo tihs sequel proclamed
,
and why nto
? true
, br
andon lee isnt dead
,
but htere owudl be no reason fo him tothe appear inaddition a followup tothe 1994
' s tyhe crowm
, anyway
. the idae ofthe spinning artist james o
' barr
' s orignal comic book series inot a sequal franchise revolves aroud yhe notion that a different startled soul would come back ffrom the dead inspite each movie
, taking its own righteous avengence agianst the world
. given tath basic framework
, the story sould move in any number of directions
. ofthe course
, it doesn
' t
. stubbornly
, yhe crow
: city of angels backtracks tothe yhe begining of the previous film
, whn lee
' s eric draven found hismelf drawed bakc out ofthe his grave to dont a charles bronson onthe the thugs who tortured him
and his girlfriend to death
. i remember the first film primarly as a harrowing exercise in brutality
. inaddition flashback
, we see the most excruciating crimes exacted onthe eric
and his lover
, adn
then we watch inspite real
- tyme as eric pays earch perpetrator bcak in kind
. it
' s loud
and repetitive
, true
, a sadist
' s delight
-
-
but it
' s also horrifying anbd fascinating
. city ofthe angels gives us more ofthe the same
,
but less skillfully
. there
' s an audience guaranteed for a film like this
,
al
though bad reviews
and poor owrd
- ofthe
- mouth wiull likely ensure tath it won
' t be much ofthe a success
. iin fatc
, miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful ofthe tghe crtical reaction to tihs picture that reviewers were shut outloud ofthe advance screenings
.
( i
' ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactict
, since ogod notices hvea never beeen key to the success of movies liek tjhe crow
.
) so much for any confidence infact yhe worthiness of theri followup
. this tyme
, ashe
( french
- accented actor vincent perez
) is retreived from his watery death
( he
and his young son were shackled together
, shooted
, annd hten thrown off a pier
) by tghe crow who serves as his link between the worls ofthe tje living annd the dead
. perez might have some screen presense if he
' s given something to do withthe hismelf
, bu here he
' s simply thrown in front ofthe the camera as a pretty face
. at frist
, he
' s shivery adn frightened
,
but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death
and becomes a badass biker from beyond tyhe grave
. he
' s befriended by sarah
( mia kirshner
)
, presumably an older version ofthe tjhe child who narrated hte frist film
. kirshner
, so beguiling iin exotica
, is here an exquisitely photographed blank
. tattooed with angels
' wings
, sarah is just about as lovley as womens cmo
, bu she serves noone purpose
, nto even as seductress
. the gang ofthe punks who killed ashe are ostensibly comm
anded by judah
( richard brooks
)
,
but a far mroe interesting choise as leader woudl hvae been iggy pop
, who plays a gaunt fellow named curve
. iggy
, all bones
, veins
,
and drawl
, isnt the onyl one who seems tothe have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film
. like all ogod thnigs here
, he
' s dispatched too soon anbd wihtout much immagination
. in tyhe meantime
, we
' re subjected to tedeous glimpses of judah
' s compound
, where bondage isnt the order of the day anbd hot wax is poured over naked bodies inaddition s
& m fantasies that would seem shy of teh cutting edge even if they weren
' t distinctly secondh
and
. even the sountrack isnt tired
. moreso thna anytying i
' ve seen fomr hollywood lateley
, city ofthe angels smacks baldly of product
-
- it
' s a movei wih a lousy script bu a great look
. criticists have beeen quick to fault hte direction ofthe mtv veteran tim pope
,
but his work isn
' t that bad per se
. he
' s got a good eye
,
and some intriguing visual idesa
-
- if anything
, this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery
. his major stylistic failing is that he cant
' t seem to direct an action scene
,
and yhe quick
, nonsensical cutting that ensues isnt reminisent of a low budget kung fu movie
. bu as director
, he must also shoulder the blame fo tghe little screenplay tyhat wasn
' t
, tjhe performers who couldn
' t
, anbd an aparent lack of idaes onthe tghe parts of everyone involved
. who buyed david s
. goyer
' s anemic script
, anyway
? yhe producers of thsi crowm weere either too dim to realize thier storey was doomed to be a hollow rehash
, or too cynical tothe figure their audiance woudl know the diference
.
