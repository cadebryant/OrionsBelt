studio 54 attracted so many weidr anbd bazare people tothe its gates thyat it
' s a wonder why teh film about tje life
and death of the studio centers itself on noe very boring
, cliched individual
, nto tothe mention an ansamble of people who wouldn
' t be at all fascinating unless htey worked at tyhe studio
, whic tehy did according tothe tihs film
. are we suppoed tothe beleave thast outloud of all teh strange folk who populated hte studio nightly
, that a charater who isnt a bl
and ripoff ofthe tony manero woudl really mkea a good protagonist for tje film about it
?
" 54
" belongs inwhich the elite group of films known as
" tje big disappointments
"
: the films that atain so much hype annd
/ or so much potential infront its creation that they come off worse than they are whn tehy are fianlly finished
. i was heavily awaiting
" 54
,
" nto the least because i
' ve become facinated with the infamous club
, whcih hasnt beeen tjhe subject ofthe an engrossing documenatry thta
' s beeen running all summer onthe vh1
, whcih is
, weirdly enough
, much more intriguing annd engrossing thna tihs
" edgy
" film
. perhaps omre importantly
,
" 54
" isnt part of the blossoming subgenre
,
" the 70s nestolgia film
,
" whihc has beeen picking up mighty steam
, whta with
" boogie nights
"
and
" the lastr dyas of disco
" comming out within the yearm
, adn both being such damn ogod movies tht nto onyl captured the feel ofthe a ceratin time period
( thte late 70s party
and yhe early 80s wakeup perido
)
,
but brought us intresting adn real characters
, like scotty
, the tragically gay boom mike operator from
" boogie nights
,
" adn charlotte
, thge ironically clueless adn bitchy co
- protagonist ffrom
" tje last dyas ofthe disco
,
" not to mention severeal others
.
" 54
" deals not so much witht teh timeline of the studio
( how it began
, how it ws run
, how it ended
)
- thgat
' s all dealt iwth infront tyhe narrated opening
and finale
- bu more interested in hte charactors who populated it
. tihs isnt a efinite plus
. here
' s a film thast could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film baout the tragic people who whent there tothe party
, adn hadnt to wakeup in the 80s wehn things liek diseases
, economy problems
,
and perphas worst ofthe all
, reagan
, all hit anbd forced everyone inot a rude awakening
. the story ofthe the studio is tragedy infront itself
: let
' s look at how it all affected the people
. bu this film doesn
' t let thyat happen
. it gives us a half
- assed protagonist named shane o
' shea
( ryan phillippe
, from
" i know what yuo did lastest summer
"
)
, who
' s cheif character trait is the fact thta he
' s from newyorker jersey
, which also happens to be his cheif charachter flwa
( i guess
)
. he
' s dim
- witted
, inot bieng part ofthe
" thte scene
,
" anbd soon finds he
' s become a bited ofthe a ravey amoungst tje studio regulars
.
.
. a bited liuke
" saterday nigth fever
,
"
' cept noone travolta annd noone real interest put into him
. poor
, poore phillippe struggles to mkea him interesting
, bu all he isnt a half
- assed character
and nto at all our ticket to yhe glimpse of teh decadence gonig onthe inside the club that he could haev beeen
. shane begins to hang out with smoe otehr denizens ofthe thge club
, like anita
( salma hayek
)
, a wannabe donna sommers
,
and her young hubby
, greg r
andanzo
( breckin meyer
, from
" clueless
"
)
, who helps shane become a bartender
and ries tothe a bited of fame
.
al
though he beigns to git somwhere wehn he sleeps with yhe foxy billie auster
( sela ward
)
, an exec of sorts
, he falls inwhich lust with a soap star named julie black
( neve campbell
)
,
and thus the boring romance subplot thta
' s all too nto necessarily imporatnt to anytying alse in the film
and never really becomes interesting at any point inaddition the film
. tjhe film
' s sole point of interest adn one major strongpoint is hte all
- too necesary personage ofthe steve rubell
, played by mike myers
( you herad me
)
. rubell
, the famouse head ofthe tje studio acted as if he never stoped partying ever
, anbd is an eazy metaphor for the life anbd times of his creation
,
but the film
, thanks to a surprizingly storng performance by myers
, makes him out to be more thna thyat
. notice teh scenes sole shocking scene
, where he trys to git felatio fomr one ofthe his male employes infact turn fo a promotion
: myers brings yhe humanity tothe rubell infront thsi scene
, anbd a couple others
, that some of us who
' ve onyl seen him on tv never saw
, annd proves tothe be perhasp the noe aspect ofthe studio 54 that thsi film actually nails
. frist tiem feature directer mark christopher proves that he
' s a better director than a writter
,
though nto too terribly much
. his stopry is trite anbd shallow
, as are his characters
, anbd his direction isnt shockingly flat
, especialy forthe a film about this subject
. it
' s as if he had a gerat story to tell
,
but instead opted for the easier route
. the studio
' s recreation isnt amazingly accurate
,
though
,
and vyer impressive
, bu his direction is never captivating enought
. some people sday thyat a film does its job if it makse ytou want tothe vsiit hte locale it tkaes palce in
( despite thge film
' s tone
, i still want to go tothe rome annd its many nightclubs after i saw fellini
' s
" la dolce vita
"
)
,
and when i watched
" 54
,
" i didn
' t particularly want to stay
.
