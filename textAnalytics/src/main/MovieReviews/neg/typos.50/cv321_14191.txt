studio 54 attracted so many eird
anbd bazare peopel to its gates that it ' s a wonder why the film about the life
and death of tje studio centers itself onthe one veyr boring
, cliched individule
, nto tothe mention an ansamble ofthe peopel who wouldn ' t be at all fascinating unless htey worked at the studio
, which tehy doed according to this film
. are we supposed tothe believe taht out ofthe all the strange folk who populated tyhe studio nightly
, tath a charcter who isnt a bland ripoff ofthe tony manero would realyl amking a ogod protagonist for the film baout it
?
" 54
" belongs in thte elite group ofthe films known as
" tghe big disappointments
"
: tghe films that atain so much hype
annd
/ or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse tahn tehy are when htey are finally finished
. i was heavily awaiting
" 54
,
" nto the least because i ' ve become facinated with thte infamous club
, which hasnt beeen the subject ofthe an engrossing documentary tath ' s been running all summer onthe vh1
, wich isnt
, weirdly anough
, much more intriguing
adn engrossing tahn this
" edgy
" film
. perheaps more importantly
,
" 54
" is part ofthe the blossoming subgenre
,
" thte 70s nostalgia film
,
" whlch has been picking up mighty steam
, whta with
" boogie nights
"
and
" the lsat dyas of disco
" coming out within the year
,
and both bieng such damn ogod movies that nto onyl capturd thte fiel of a ceratin time preiod
( teh lite 70s party
adn tyhe early 80s wakeup perido
)
,
but brought us intresting
and rela characters
, liuke scotty
, teh tragically gay boom mike operator from
" boogie nights
,
"
and charlotte
, the ironicaly clueless
and bitchy co
- protagnoist from
" the last dyas ofthe disco
,
" nto tothe mention sevral others
.
" 54
" deals not so much with tghe timeline of the studio
( how it began
, how it wass run
, how it ended
)
- that ' s all dealed witht inaddition tghe narrated opening
and finale
-
but more intersted in the cahracters who populated it
. this isnt a definit plus
. here ' s a film thgat could hve beeen a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tradgic peple who went there tothe party
,
and had to wakeup in hte 80s whn thnigs liuke diseases
, economy problems
,
anbd perheaps worst ofthe all
, reagan
, all hitted
and forced everyone inot a rude awakening
. the stor of the studio isnt tragedy in itself
: let ' s look at how it all affected hte peopel
.
but thsi film doesn ' t let tht ahppen
. it gives us a half
- assed prtoagonist named shane o ' shea
( ryan phillippe
, from
" i nkow whta you did lastest summer
"
)
, who ' s cheif charcter trait isnt tghe fatc that he ' s from new jersey
, which allso happens tothe be his chief charachter falw
( i guess
)
. he ' s dim
- witted
, into being part ofthe
" tyhe scene
,
"
anbd soon finds he ' s become a bited of a rave amongst tje studio regulars
.
.
. a bit liek
" saterday nigt fever
,
" ' cept noone travolta
and no rela interest put into him
. poor
, poore phillippe struggles tothe make him interesting
,
bu all he isnt a half
- assed character
adn not at all our ticket to teh glimpse of tghe decadence going onthe inside the club thta he could have been
. shane begins tothe hang out with smoe otehr denizens ofthe the club
, like anita
( salma hayek
)
, a wannabe donna sommers
,
and her young hubby
, greg randanzo
( breckin meyer
, from
" clueless
"
)
, who helps shane become a bartender
adn ries tothe a bited ofthe fame
.
altough he beggins tothe get somewhere wehn he sleeps with the foxy billie auster
( sela ward
)
, an exec of sorts
, he falls inspite lust witht a soap star named julie balck
( neve campbell
)
,
and thus the boring romance subplot that ' s all too not necessarily important tothe anything esle in the film
and never relaly becomes interesting at any point in the film
. the film ' s sole point ofthe interest
and oen major strongpoint isnt tyhe all
- too necesary personage ofthe steve rubell
, played by mike myers
( yuo heard me
)
. rubell
, the famous head of thte studio acted as if he never stoped partying ever
,
annd isnt an easy metaphor fo the life
anbd times of his creation
,
bu the film
, thanks to a surprisingly storng performance by myers
, makse him out tothe be more than thast
. notice yhe scenes sole shocking scene
, where he tries to get felatio from noe of his male employees in turn forthe a pomotion
: myers brings yhe humanity to rubell in this scene
,
and a couple others
, taht some of us who ' ve onyl seen him onthe tv never saw
,
adn proves to be perhaps the one aspect ofthe studio 54 that this film acually nails
. frist time feature directer mark christopher proves thyat he ' s a better director thna a writer
,
though not too terribly much
. his sotry isnt trite
anbd shallow
, as are his characters
,
adn his direction is shockingly flat
, especialy forthe a film baout this subject
. it ' s as if he had a great stoyr tothe tell
,
bu instead opted for the easier route
. the studio ' s recreation isnt amazingly accurate
,
though
,
annd vrey impressive
,
bu his direction is never captivating enough
. smoe people sday thast a film does its job if it makse you want tothe ivsit the locale it tkaes palce in
( dispite the film ' s tone
, i still wanna tothe go tothe rome
annd its many nightclubs after i saw fellini ' s
" la dolce vita
"
)
,
and when i watched
" 54
,
" i didn ' t particularly watn to stay
.
