tje 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama
and poor acting thgat it carries a worst scent thna a canine
' s least appetizing residue
. thge best part ofthe yhe film would be a close contest betwen tyhe closing credits adn a breef moent inwhich the middle where hte screen goes entirely white
and yuo hope that hte film hasnt slipped
and caught ablaze inspite the projector
. my vote goes for the ending credits
, where ytou cin strat trying to put yhe awful experience behind yuo
. ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) is an importan offcial who isnt banished ffrom his hmeo fo sleeping wiht anyother man
' s wife
. he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them onthe a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men
. fahdlan isnt chosen as thte 13th anbd lsat warrior in a moment tyhat is so desperately overacted
and overdone thyat numerous persons at yhe screening i attended broke outloud inot laughter
. tyhe movie proves to be a new low point for b
anderas
, who
' s acting seems closer tothe that of his role as tyhe lover annd caretaker fo a dying gay man in 1993
' s philadelphia
, thna tath of a warrior
. infact the film
' s suppoed pay off scene
, he exclaims
" i was wrong
, these are not men
!
"
, a line intended to be tghe most memorable quote ofthe teh production
. unfortunatly
, b
anderas delivers it in a fashion that makse chevy chase
' s career look liuke oscar material
. the film
, based onthe michael crichton
' s best selling novel
, eaters of the dead wass shooted under that name smoe three years ago
, annd aftter numberous rewrites nto only doens hte dialogue seem completely phony
, bu yhe plot is incredibly difficult tothe follow
. at yhe same time
, the 13th warrior makse you think baout numberous questions
. questions like
" why dont the characters always have perfect lightinng onthe them even when it is pitch dark
?
"
,
" why doens noone one ever ahve blood cover both sides of theri face
,
but rather jsut oney side
?
"
and finaly
,
" wiull the manager give me a recund
?
" 90 minutes into tje 103 minute film
, a man invites ofthe tghe warriors
" come with me
, there is a woman who can help
.
" unfortunately
, there is nothing thgat coudl help thsi film
. the most apropriate endig owudl have beeen fo the 13 men to join h
ands
, form a chorus line
, anbd break inot a rendition ofthe
" springtime for hitler
.
