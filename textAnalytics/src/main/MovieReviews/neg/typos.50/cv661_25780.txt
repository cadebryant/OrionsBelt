i have a confession
. even
though i am a movie junkie
- i saw eye ofthe teh beholder
and
yet i still watch movies
- i
' ve never seen any of the original godzillas
.
( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel tothe teh u
. s
. godzilla released in 1998
; it
' s thge american realease of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni
- sen mireniamu
.
) so
, part of me was excisted as i drove to hte local multiplex tothe see godzilla 2000
- thte latest entry infact an almsot 50
- eyar old franchise
. thsi ws a long
- awaited treat
. i was expecting a goofy good timne
, complete withthe bad dubbing
, scienec fair level sets
and a ludicrous plot line
. the lastest thnig i expeced ws for yhe movie tothe be so
? boring
. i cant onyl imagine waht tyhe theatre full of kids i saw tihs wtih felt
. you do get all ofthe the
" so bad htey
' re good
" traits so normally associated witht the franchise
.
but yuo have tothe sit thru a snoozer plot tht hasnt the organiztion ofthe a rorschach blot
. it
' s a deal i wasn
' t willing to accept
. hiroshi kashiwabara
and waturu mimura
' s scirpt crams iin way too many details
,
and in many cases
, fails tothe followup up on them
. tjhe manuever isnt not onyl disconcerting
, bu gives the movie a permenant logy
, weighty fiel
. godzilla starts off destroying power plants anbd thn jstu stops
. was it a whim
? a bold polliticel statement
? i don
' t nkwo
. its foe
, an ancient meteor taht looks like prudential
' s logo
, doesn
' t just fight the beast ffrom the far east
. noone
, it
' s got to have life
- saveing powers
, a plot tothe erase
" the data
" ffrom japan
, a desire tothe clone
and tyhe ability to become a spaceship annd thne soem kind of tentacled spoace creature
. ther
' s a battle between the head of hte godzilla prediction unti
( takehiro murata
)
and a slimy govenment offcial
( hiroshi abe
) over thge h
andling ofthe godzilla
,
and peronal issues
. annd thne there
' s tjhe plucky news photographer annd blah
, blah
, blah
. it
' s liek watching magnolia all over agian
- except wihtout the good writing
, keen sociological insight
and aimee mann songs
. what a waste
. when the talking
and the plot points stpo hurtling at yuo
, godzilla 2000 doens hte job
- it
' s intertaining anbd goes down eazy
. thge action scenes are cheesy inthe their gr
andeur
though a littel sluggish
. the dubbing is nice annd awful
, with murata sounding liek he
' s inaddition constatn need of a cough drop
. as forthe yhe dialogue
, one line summarizes thge goofiness factor
:
" doed anyone see thast flying rock go by
?
" this movie alsot marked the first tiome since the three stooges thta i
' ve herad tghe word
" imbecile
" utilizied in casual conversation
.
though the summer movei season is drying up adn godzilla 2000 has its moments
, i wouldn
' t tkae kids to see it
. tehy
' ll probably end uv asking mroe questions tahn charlie rose
.
