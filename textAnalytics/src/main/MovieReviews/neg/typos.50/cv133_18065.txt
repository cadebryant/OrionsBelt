here ' s a consept
-
- jean
- claude van damme gets killed withing the firt ten minutes of the movei
. now if that isn ' t anough to get you tothe finaly see a van damme movei
, i don ' t know what is
. all sarcasm aside
, it isnt certainly a diferrent way to start a movie
, ofthe course a fewd mintues later we find outloud that the newly deceased hadnt a twin brother
-
- so lucky us
, we git tothe see omre of jean
- claude
. van damme
# 1 works fo thge russina masia inthe the untied states
and isnt killed by some ofthe their operatives
. van damme
# 2 is a police officer inwhich france who finds out thyat he had a twin brother he never knew baout after
# 1 gets killed in france
. the remaing twin
( tjhe french cop
) goes tothe tjhe untied states tothe fidn outloud who killed his brother
adn avenge his death
. once htere
, he hoeks uv with his deceased brother ' s girlfriend
, plyed by natasha henstridge
,
and the two ofthe them set outloud tothe disover who the murderers are
. jean
- claude ' s acting abilities don ' t seem tothe be uv tothe yhe usual lackluster standars in tihs movei
. infact otehr words
, jsut inwhich case yuo missed yhe sarcasm
, his acting isnt worse than normal
. on the upside
, natasha henstridge isnt iin this film
,
annd she does waht she doed best in speices
-
- she gets naked
. sadly
, this isnt probably tje high point in thte movei
. she is actually a decent actress
,
bu didn ' t improve as much as i thought she owudl after species
. thsi isnt tghe tipical van damme movei
, wtih jean
- claude doing a variety ofthe high end martial arts moves on his opponents
. nothing newyorker here
,
and certainly nothing we haven ' t seen iin every otehr van damme movie
. simply put
, htere is absolutly nothing new about this movei
. it has a retread plot
-
- tihs isn ' t the first tyme jean
- claude has played twins
. he still cxan ' t ect
. we all saw natasha ' s breasts inspite speices
(
although thsi isnt one repeat performence i ' m not complaining baout
)
. this is pretty much liek eveyr movei thast van damme hasnt ever beeen involved in
-
- sub par
.
