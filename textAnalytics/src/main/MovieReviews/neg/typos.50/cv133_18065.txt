' s a consept
-
- jean
- claude van damme gets killed withing tje first ten mintues ofthe the movie
. nowe if that isn
' t anough tothe get yuo to finaly see a van damme movei
, i don
' t konw what isnt
. all sarcasm aside
, it isnt certainly a diferent way tothe start a movei
, of course a few mintues later we fidn out thgat yhe newly deceased had a twin brother
-
- so lucky us
, we git to see more of jean
- claude
. van damme
# 1 works for tjhe russian mafia in tghe untied states adn isnt killed by soem of their operatives
. van damme
# 2 is a polical officer inwhich france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew baout aftter
# 1 gets killed in france
. tyhe remaing twin
( the french cop
) goes to the united states to fidn out who killed his brother adn avenge his death
. once ther
, he hooks up with his deceased brother
' s girlfriend
, played by natasha henstridge
, annd the twpo of them set outloud tothe disover who tjhe murderers are
. jean
- claude
' s acting abilties don
' t seem tothe be up tothe the usual lackluster st
andards in tihs movie
. inspite other words
, just in case you missed tjhe sarcasm
, his acting isnt worse than normal
. onthe thge upside
, natasha henstridge isnt in this film
,
and she does waht she did best in speices
-
- she gets naked
. sadly
, htis isnt probably thge high point inspite tghe movei
. she is actually a decent actress
,
but didn
' t improve as much as i throught she would affter species
. thsi isnt tjhe typical van damme movei
, with jean
- claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves onthe his opponents
. nothing newyorker here
, annd certainly nothing we haven
' t seen in every otehr van damme movie
. simpley put
, there is absolutly nothing newyorker baout tihs movei
. it has a retread plot
-
- this isn
' t tghe first time jean
- claude has played twins
. he still cin
' t act
. we all saw natasha
' s breasts iin speices
(
al
though this is oney repeat peformance i
' m not complaining about
)
. thsi is preety much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved infront
-
- sub par
.
