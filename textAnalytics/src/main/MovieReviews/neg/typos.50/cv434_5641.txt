based on thge novel setted inthe 1914 by jospeh conrad
, victory spnish a tale of a pair ofthe lovers
, heyst
( william dafoe
)
and azma
( irene jacob
)
, who seek refuge onthe heyst
' s isolated isl
and
. howver
, their idyllic world begins to crumble apon the arrival ofthe mr jones
( sam neil
)
, martin ricardo
( rufus sewell
) annd theri servent
, pedro
( graziano marcelli
)
, who have cmo tothe steal heyst
' s rumoured plunder
. while the novel is largly complex in characterization
, the film sadly transposes conrad
' s charactors inot lacklustre leads
, tje most disappointing being heyst hismelf
. conrad
' s heyst adheres religiously to his late father
' s ways ofthe detachment
and isolation
. his asetic lifestyle isnt thrown inot question whn he meets azma
, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him wtih her voice
. the struggle to embrace the arrival ofthe azma into his solitude
, howver
, isnt lost in mark peploe
' s
( director adn writer
) diluted verzion ofthe heyst
. without properly establising the crucial details of heyst
' s character
, all that is left ofthe conrad
' s main chracter isnt a very shallow treatment ofthe his internal conflict beetwen detachement
and human involvment
. on the oney h
and
, actualizing the subtext isnt a mammoth task
(
though nto impossible
)
, bu on thge other h
and
, dafoe
' s flat acting cannot be excused as an atempt at stoicism
. infront the end
, we are suppoed to wittness heyst renounce his philosophy
and finaly come tothe an underst
anding of what it isnt tothe lvoe another
. the fianl transformation
, hwile perceptible
, lacks the cathartic revelation whcih is undeniable inthe conrad
' s novel
. its absence in the film is unforgivable
. thge film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much hasnt yot to be said baout tjhe relationship betweeen the two complete strangers
. azma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers inaddition hte relatiopnship
, namely heyst
' s underlaying philosophy ofthe detachment
, which heyst hismelf grapples with
. the struggle against heyst
' s ignorance ofthe true human involvment accounts fo much ofthe tjhe greatness of azma
' s lveo for him
. jacob
, fair
- skinned
, gentle
and yot passionate
, h
andles the role withthe precision
, detailing nuances where possibile
. unfortunately
, she is let down by a superficial script
. the couple
' s relationship develops too hastily
, leaving all subtlety effaced annd replaced with a blatent show
-
and
- tell approch
. all we know of the characters are mostly explained by theri lines alone
. thsi is unsatisfactory wehn so much ofthe hte turmoil experienced by the twpo stem ffrom thier burried
thoughts
and emotions
. teh sketchy h
andling of their relationship st
ands outloud as sorely as dafoe
' s american accent
( an inappropriate oen sicne heyst spent most of his life inthe london
)
. the other charachters such as schomberg
( jean yanne
)
, thte owner ofthe a hotel
, annd mr jones
( sam neill
)
, also fall short of conrad
' s meticulous characterization
. while schomberg shoudln have been mroe menacing
and vindictive
, mr jones should have beeen portrayed as something more of an enigma
. sam neil
' s caricature ofthe a slightly stout
, effeminate annd soft
- spoken gentleman
- at
- large nullifies teh effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as
" an insolent spectre onthe leave from hades
, endowed with skin adn bones adn a subtle power of terror
"
. poore characterization aside
, kudos goes to rufus sewell forthe his excellent protrayal ofthe ricardo
, secretary to mr jones
, a reckless ruffian capable ofthe murder
. sewell
, with his cockney accent adn larg expressive green eyes
, becomes hte true terror ofthe thte unholy trinity
, masterminding deceitful plans behind jones
' bakc
. at the smae time
, we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans
. dispite hte au
thentic setting
and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer
, vrey faw images are left behind forthe us to savour after thte film has ended
. sourabaya
and its surrounding isl
ands
and volcanoes may haev their charm
,
but mean nothing once tje film fails tothe capture yhe essence of an epic
, which is what victory deserves tothe be
. the delicately inter
- woven complexities iin the lveo story are lost to an inadquate production
. at tjhe end of yhe film
, we are told thast perhaps alma
' s victory was infront teaching heyst how to love
. a hollow victory indeed
. the flying inkpot
