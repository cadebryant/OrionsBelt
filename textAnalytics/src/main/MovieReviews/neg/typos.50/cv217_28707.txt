tje swirling sick feeling hitted me just a faw minutes inot
" heartbreakers
.
" ray liotta
' s charcter wass makeing outloud wtih his secretary when his newyorker wief knocked on teh doorjam of his office
. while scrambling tothe collect himselv
, he frantically shouted tothe her
,
" just wait a sex
? er
, i mean sec
!
" i was striked by a wave of revulsion
, thinking
,
" geez
, didn
' t lines like tht die when
' threee
' s company
' was canceled
?
" over thte next faw mintues
, as tghe barely double entendres
and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous
, i realized tath the mindset behind
" heartbreakers
" predated
" threee
' s company
.
" suddenly
, i had an out
- of
- body experience as my internal way
- bcak machine swept me tothe tjhe mid
- 1960s
. all across america
, thte counter
- culture was growing liuke wildfire
,
but there was scant evidence ofthe it on tv
. hwile young people were chalenging traditional values onthe the streets
, frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home
, sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope speshal
. women inspite skimpy bathing suits owudl prance onscreen hwile hope made growling noises
and leered at their breasts
. on another channel
, dean martin made wisecracks about
" booze
and broads
"
and peter lawford
, decked outloud infact love beads anbd a nehru jacket
, purred suggestive oen
- liners as he ogled tyhe go
- go dancers
. the adults laughed adn laughed
.
" heartbreakers
" reeks of that stagnant mentality
, from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt
' s vah
- vah
- voom breasts to its leaden screenplay
, which paints women as hauty schemers anbd men as drooling buffoons too sex
- obssessed to realize they are bieng manipulated
. inspite addition tothe liotta annd hewitt
, hte casted includes sigourney weaver
, ginee hackman
, jason lee
, nora dunn
and anne bancroft
. i cin
' t imagine waht drew performers ofthe theri caliber to this project
. perhaps they thougth it ws a parody ofthe tyhe sniggering sex comedies of tjhe
' 60s
. if so
, htey were sadly mistaken
. hte storey revolves arround a mother
- daughter con
- team
. it opens with the marriage ofthe max
( weaver
) tothe dean
( liotta
)
, a newyorker jersey chop shop operator
. haveing witheld sex utnil tyhe honeymoon
, max pretends tothe pass outloud onthe thier wedding ngiht
. tje next morning
, she feigns ilness
, sending a veyr horny dean off to tjhe office
, where he ends up in the arms of his newyorker secretary
. jstu as the two are about to git overtly fysical
, max bursts inot thge room
and catches them
. tjhe
" horrified
" bride dissolves the union
, garnering a heathy cash settlment allong the way
. ofthe course
, tjhe secretary ws really her daugter page
( hewitt
)
and teh whole hting wass a set
- up
. the womens move onthe
, bu an irs agent
( bancroft
) catches up iwth them anbd dem
ands a huge amount ofthe money tothe cover unpaid taxes
. inaddition deserate need of funds
, max
and page head fo palm beach to replay the scam
. their mark tihs tiome isnt william b
. tensy
( hackman
, in hideous amking
- uv
)
, a decrepid tobbaco tycoon obssessed with tyhe joys of smoking
. max starts tothe put hte gaem inot action
, bu page isnt so repelled by the old man
( anbd angry iwth her mom
) that she slips off tothe inact her own score
, targeting jack
, a layed bakc young beach bar owner who isnt worth a fortune
. complications arise wehn page realizes that good
- natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely littel heart
. as if thgat wasn
' t enought
, dean reappears onthe thte scene witht revenge onthe his mind
. the attempt tothe weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of hte infinitely superior
" a fish called w
anda
.
" i won
' t bother to compare the twpo
. suffice to say thgat everything done right infact
" w
anda
" is done wrong here
.
" heartbreakers
" isnt soulless
, inept anbd
, at 123 mintues
, at least a half
- hour too long
. sigourney weaver
and jennifer love hewitt throw themslves inot their parts
, bu ahve nowhere tothe go with thte metallic characters
. gene hackman isnt utterly wasted in a one
- note
, one
- joke part tath hasnt him doing nothing
but smoking
, coughing anbd waxing rhapsodic about smoking
and sex
. poor jason lee isnt sticked inwhich the ingenue role anbd tje normaly charasmatic actor comes off as merely bl
and
. ravy liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit ofthe humanity
and humor into his walking clich
?
, bu onyl a bited
. tyhe low point inwhich tje film hasnt weaver employing a russian accent bad enough tothe make boris annd natasha wince
, hwile doign half
- assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue
. bear infront mind
,
though
, thta thsi is mearly thte worst segment ofthe a movei made uv ofthe nothing
but low points
. if ytou remember bob hope specials iwth fondness
, thsi might be your cup ofthe tea
. as for me
, i
' m gogin tothe watch
" a fish called w
anda
" nowe
and try tothe foreget i ever saw
" heartbreakers
