. as a result
, it ' s even worse thna soem ofthe your better campy horror pictures
( see nightmare onthe elm street
) baceause it thikns it ' s baout thirty times smarter tahn it is
. based onthe a teen book of tje same nmae
adn
, disappointingly
, adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson
, i knwo whta yuo did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined whith smoe startling cinematography of a cliff allong tjhe ocean
annd an angsty sort sitting at the top
. teh appropropiate mood bieng setted
( thsi is angst
- horror for hte 90 ' s

. after getting drunk at a party
, gogin tothe a beach tothe wittily discuss urban legend
and indulge in some foreshadowing
,
and having smoe meaningfull sex
( if you believe waht thge charactors say
)
, thte four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night
. his face isnt mangled so tehy cin ' t tell who it isnt
,
adn they come to the decison tothe dump him in yhe ocean so as to not ruin any ofthe their future chances for success infact thte world

, folowed by some taunting ofthe protaganists by thte misterious killer
, bad acting by a good actress
( anne heche
)
, an improbable plot
, bad acting by the main bad actors
, some moreso killing
