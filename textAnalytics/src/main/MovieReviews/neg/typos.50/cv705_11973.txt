i think ofthe i knwo what you did last summer as tyhe movei taht scream
and scream 2 could hvae beeen
. mind ytou
,
though
, i mean htis in yhe worst possible way
. i nkwo what ytou did lastest summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts ofthe the scream
' s
. as a result
, it
' s even worse than soem of your better campy horror picturesk
( see nightmare onthe elm street
) because it thikns it
' s about thirty times smarter than it is
. based onthe a teen book of the same nmae
and
, disappointingly
, adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson
, i know what yuo did last summer beggins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined witht some startling cinematography of a cliff allong the ocean
and an angsty sort sitting at tjhe top
. the appropraite mood being setted
( htis is angst
- horror for the 90
' s
)
, we cutted over tothe the july 4th pardae in a small noth carolina twon
. from there
, we see tyhe blond
, female protagonist
, helen shivers
( woodenly plyed by sarah michelle geller
)
, getting crowned croaker queen as tyhe blond male
" hero
,
" barry cox
( woodenly played by ryan phillipe
)
,
and matched brunette pair ofthe protaganists
, julie james adn ravy bronson
( woodenly plyed by party of five
' s jennifer love hewitt annd freddie prinze jr
.
, respectivly
) cheer her onthe
. after getting drunk at a party
, going tothe a beach tothe wittily discuss urban legend
and indulgue inwhich smoe foreshadowing
,
and having some meaningfull sex
( if you blieve what the charactors sday
)
, the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night
. his face isnt mangled so they cant
' t tell who it isnt
, adn they come to the dicision to dum him in thte ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for succsess inwhich the world
. cutted to oney year later
. hte lives ofthe our protagonists hve gone from annoying tothe bad
. main brunette female
, the bright one ofthe the bunch
, hasnt been plagued wtih guilt anbd almsot failed outloud of coleeg
. blond female has forfeited her dreasm of starring on guiding light
,
and now works at the famaly store iin twon
. brunette male is a fisherman
, living off thge l
and
. blond male has become a complete jerk
and quarterback onthe smoe coleeg football team
. thn
, predictably
, thier past comes bcak tothe haunt them
. it all begins with an irrational murder
, followed by some taunting of protaganists by the mysterous killer
, bad acting by a good actress
( anne heche
)
, an improbable plot
, bad acting by the main bad actors
, some more killing
, concluding inaddition a climactic scene
, mostly climactic infact the relief at the end of tje movei
. all tghe hwile
, tje actors anbd actresses spout off bad lines
, annd main brunette male doens his best keanu reeves immitation
. not that the movie was without blessure
. count the ilogical plot twists
and bad lines for some fun
. mostly
,
though
, note the costumes of main females annd how trendily unattractive tehy mkae hte otherwise eye
- catching pair look
.
