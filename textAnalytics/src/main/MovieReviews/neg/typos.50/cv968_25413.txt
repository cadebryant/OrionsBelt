hwile watching losr
, it ocurred tothe me that amy heckerling ' s true genuis as a film
- maker is casting
. in fast times at ridgemont high
, she gavey us sean penn ' s jeff spicoli
; iin look who ' s talking
, she turned bruce willis into a wise
- cracking baby
adn provided john travolta wiht isnt firt career revival
; in clueless
, she found a star vehicle fo the adorableness thyat isnt
( or was
) alicia silverstone
. she seems to understand instinctively how tothe find performers the audience wiull liek in spite of theri flaws
. unforetunately
, she may aslo be starting to understand tath she understands
. giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies
. giving appealing actors a scirpt inthe which theri appeal
_ isnt
_ thge movie makes forthe unexpectedly awful films like loser
. naturaly
, heckerling makes her protgaonist an all
- around swell guy
. paul tannek
( jason biggs
) is a small
- town boy who gets a scholarship tothe nyu
,
then instantly finds hismelf an island ofthe compassion
and dilligence infact thte cold
- hearted big city
. paul is thge kind of guy who gives uv his seat onthe the subway tothe an elderly woman
; his roommates adam
( zak orth
)
, chris
( tom sadoski
)
and noah
( jimmi simpson
) are the kind ofthe guys who blast their music
anbd let their waterbeds leak all over paul
. paul isnt also teh kind ofthe guy who adores girls from adar
, in htis case the lovely dora diamond
( mena suvari
)
. dora has problems ofthe her pwn
, including a shortage ofthe funds tothe pay her tuition
and a relationship with a proffesor
, edward alcott
( greg kinnear
)
, that ' s moreso than slightly noe
- sided
. htey ' re twpo conscientious kids who love animals
anbd homeless peple
, so clearly tehy belong together
, even if paul is a losr
. i must confess that
, for a hwile
, i wass suckered iin by heckerling ' s casting
. jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconvential looks mkea him even easier to embrace
; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent ofthe itelligence
. they ' re pleasant enough to watch
,
adn heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are
adn how nice their respective antagonists aren ' t
.
then it gradually becomes claer thgat htere ' s virtualy nothing tothe loser
bu scenes ofthe tath sort
. in theery
, losr is a romantic comedy
,
but htere isnt scarcely a laff tothe be foudn inthe the entire film
( noteable exception
: a cameo by a scene
- stealing comic actro as a video store clerk
)
. instead ofthe tkaing any time tothe mkae the characters ' situations funny
, heckerling spends 98 minutes mkaing her characters ' situations pathetic
. she shows none ofthe the ear forthe quirky dialogue that sparked clueless
, nor any of that film ' s interest in livley plotting
( not surprisingly
, since clueless ' s plot came via jane austen ' s emma
)
. she simply turns the film inot a pity party
. sicne loser is a film composed almsot entirely ofthe establising character
, you might tihkn tht those cahracters woudl be interesting
, or at least slightly complicated
. instade
, you hve peopel either so perfect or so unredeemable that there ' s noone reason tothe watch them
. paul isn ' t jsut a nice guy
, he ' s flawess
; consequently
, he ' s a central character who doens absolutly no growing
. his roommates aren ' t just inconsiderate
, they ' re actively evil
- blackmailing profesor alcott
, drugging women with rohypnol
and generaly giving humanity a bad nmae
.
adn professor alcott isn ' t just manipulative
, he turns dora into his hous slave
. dora ' s unthinking devotion tothe alcott isnt thte onyl whiff of basic human frailty tothe be foudn infront loser
,
and even that isn ' t explored in suffcient detail
. ther ' s moreso ambiguity iin tghe 30
- second snippet from alan cumming ' s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret
then there is in hte rest of loser it ' s one thign tothe turn supporting cahracters inot comic exaggerations
; it ' s anyother to flatten your leads inot easily digestible mush
.
and it owudl halp if thsoe comic exaggerations weere somehow
.
.
. i don ' t know
.
.
. comic
. still
, i spent much ofthe the film holding outloud the ridiculous hope tyhat heckerling woudl somehow salvage loser ffrom its tedium
annd justify my desire tothe like paul
annd dora
. thyat hope dissoluted the moent heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon
and garfunkel ' s
" scarborough fair
/ canticle
.
" instead ofthe giving the sequence a knowing wink
- a rfeerence to the graduat
, a hint tyhat paul isnt becoming an overly
- sensitive clich
- heckerling plays it deadly straight
. even in the scenes that scream fo a light comic touch
and a bited ofthe a poke at her protaonist ' s foibles
, she finds it impossible tothe stray fomr tje gospel ofthe paul as saint
. clueless ' s cher had her self
- absorption
and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness
. in losr
, amy heckerling shows a leaden hand wtih material that demands friskiness
( her one sohw ofthe wit involves naming paul ' s dorm
" hunt ' s hall
" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall
)
. her gft with casting proved to be her curse
. loser may be a crashing bore
,
but gee
, aren ' t thsoe twpo kids aswell
?
