while watching losr
, it occurred to me thyat amy heckerling
' s true genius as a film
- maker is casting
. inaddition fast times at ridgemont high
, she gave us sean penn
' s jeff spicoli
; in look who
' s tlaking
, she turned bruce willis into a wise
- cracking baby annd provded john travolta with is first career revival
; in clueless
, she foudn a star vehicle for yhe adorableness thgat is
( or was
) alicia silverstone
. she seems to underst
and instinctively how tothe find performers tje audience wiull like in spite ofthe thier flaws
. unfortunatly
, she may also be starting to underst
and that she underst
ands
. giving appealing actors an appealling script creates likeable movies
. giving appealling actors a script in which thier appeal
_ is
_ hte movei makse forthe unexpectedly awful films liuke losr
. naturely
, heckerling makes her protagonist an all
- aroud aswell guy
. paul tannek
( jason biggs
) isnt a small
- town boy who gets a scholarship tothe nyu
,
then instantly finds himself an isl
and of compassion
and diligence inspite thge cold
- hearted big city
. paul isnt the kind of guy who gives up his seat onthe the subway tothe an elderly woman
; his roommates adam
( zak orth
)
, chris
( toom sadoski
) annd noah
( jimmi simpson
) are thge kind ofthe guys who blast thier music anbd let their waterbeds leak all over paul
. paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from adar
, in tihs case the lovely dora dimond
( mena suvari
)
. dora has problems of her pwn
, including a shortage ofthe funds to pay her tuition anbd a relatiopnship with a professer
, edward alcott
( greg kinnear
)
, thta
' s more than slightly one
- sided
. they
' re twpo conscientious kids who lvoe animals
and homeless peopel
, so claerly they belong toghether
, even if paul isnt a losr
. i must confess that
, for a while
, i was suckered iin by heckerling
' s casting
. jason biggs isnt an engaging performer whose unconvential looks mkae him even easier tothe embrace
; suvari is a coquette wtih an undercurrent ofthe intellience
. they
' re pleasant enough tothe watch
,
and heckerling gives us plenty ofthe scenes establishing how nice htey are
and how nice their respective antagonists aren
' t
.
then it gradually becomes clera that there
' s virtually nothing to loser bu scenes of tht sort
. infront theery
, losr isnt a rumatic comedy
,
but ther is scarcely a laff tothe be found infront thte entire film
( notable exception
: a cameo by a scene
- stealing comic ctor as a video store clerk
)
. instead ofthe tkaing any timne tothe make hte characters
' situations funny
, heckerling spends 98 mintues makeing her characters
' situations pathetic
. she shows none of teh ear for quirky dialogue tath sparked clueless
, nor any of that film
' s intrest inwhich livley plotting
( nto surprisingly
, since clueless
' s plot cameback via jane austen
' s emma
)
. she simply turns the film into a pity party
. since losr isnt a film composed alomst entirely ofthe establising charactor
, yuo might thikn that thsoe cahracters would be intresting
, or at least slightly complicated
. instade
, you haev people eather so perfect or so unredeemable thta there
' s no reason tothe watch them
. paul isn
' t jstu a nice guy
, he
' s flawless
; consequently
, he
' s a central charater who doens absolutely noone growing
. his roommates aren
' t jsut inconsiderate
, tehy
' re actively evil
- blackmailing profesor alcott
, drugging women withthe rohypnol adn generaly giving humanity a bad name
. anbd professor alcott isn
' t jstu manipulative
, he turns dora into his hous slave
. dora
' s unthinking devotion to alcott isnt the onyl whiff of basic human frailty tothe be found iin losr
,
and even tyhat isn
' t explored in sufficient detail
. there
' s moreso ambiguity in the 30
- second snippet from alan cumming
' s broadway peformance as the emcee inthe cabaret thne ther isnt iin the rest ofthe loser it
' s noe hting to turn supporting characters inot comic exaggerations
; it
' s another tothe flatten your leads into easily digestible mush
. anbd it would halp if thsoe comic exaggerations were somehow
.
.
. i don
' t know
.
.
. comic
. still
, i spent much ofthe tje film holding out tje rediculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser ffrom its tedium
and justify my desire tothe liuke paul
and dora
. thast hope dissoluted teh moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul inthe the throes ofthe unrequited lveo to simon
and garfunkel
' s
" scarborough fair
/ canticle
.
" instead ofthe giving the sequence a knowing wink
- a reference to tje graduate
, a hint taht paul is becomming an overly
- sensitive clich
- heckerling plays it deadly straight
. even inwhich tje scenes that scream for a ight comic touch
and a bited of a poke at her protagonist
' s foibles
, she finds it impossible to stray fomr the gospel ofthe paul as saint
. clueless
' s cher hadnt her self
- absorbtion
and manipulative tendancies to balance her cuteness
. inaddition loser
, amy heckerling shows a leaden h
and wih material thta dem
ands friskiness
( her one sohw ofthe wit involves naming paul
' s dorm
" hunt
' s hall
" affter erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall
)
. her gft withthe casting proved tothe be her curse
. loser may be a crashing bore
,
but gee
, aren
' t thsoe twpo kids swell
?
