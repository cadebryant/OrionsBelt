you know
, i never relaly wondered waht the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an ood man
. while watching instinct
, i couldn
' t help bu acknowledge thge way the film carelessly rehashes hte well
- explored themes ofthe thsoe ealier movies
. even beside yhe tarzan comparision
, instinct just isn
' t a very ogod film
. it
' s painfully idealistic
, manipulative
, adn silly
. i didn
' t hate it
-
- it
' s simpley impossible for me to hite any film starring anthony hopkins
; futhermore
, most ofthe the acting is quite good
.
but i cxan recogise instinct fo waht it isnt beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved
. i can also recogise reasons forthe wanting tothe amke instinct
,
and it
' s pretty clera that this could ahve beeen a ogod film with a massive scirpt overhaul annd a directer less interseted inwhich imitating movies like patch adams
. things strat off in the predicatble way
, as director jon turtletaub introduces us tothe our hero
, theo caulder
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, an ambitious
, young psychiatrist under the supervision ofthe an experienced
, ood psychiatrist
( donald sutherl
and
)
. caulder soon finds himself involved inwhich yhe case ofthe his life
, the one he thikns will make him faymus
. tghe subject isnt ethan powell
( hopkins
)
, an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two yeasr
. powell has been charged with the brutal murders ofthe several men in africa
,
and it
' s nowe caulder
' s job to fidn outloud of he
' s mentally competant anough tothe st
and trial
. thru a series ofthe short sessions
, caulder trys tothe put toghether the complex psyche of powell
. even
though it realy is an old man verzion of tarzan
, much of thsi central idea is rather intresting
. as i said
, hopkins isnt captivating for eveyr second he
' s on screen
; he hasnt a way of convincing us that he
' s not acting
, that he
' s actually a man who has jsut spended two yersa of his life living with a famaly ofthe wild gorillas
. thte character himself isn
' t very intresting
-
- he
' s jsut an anthropologist who raelly likes gorillas
-
-
but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both iin speech anbd acation
. gooding jr
. does storng wrok oposite hopkins
, palying caulder as an intteligent
and flawed individule
. tghe screenplay
, written by gerald di pego anbd
" suggested by
" a novel by daniel quinn
, gives us no background informtion on caulder
, bu that seems tothe be the point
( he hasnt no time fo friends because he
' s obsessed wih his work
)
. nonetheless
, theese twpo actors are essentially the entire list ofthe things thgat are good about instinct
. unfourtunately
, filmmaking thsi inept cin mangle the effect of even the best acting
. turtletaub
and di pego are both guilty of instinct
' s artistic failure
, forthe they work together to make the dumbest
, most cliche
- ridden environment inwhich which thier characters are to live
, anbd they dont so by means ofthe brainless subplots
. first
, we have thte prison warden subplot
. thte prison warden is evil adn wants tothe stpo caulder
' s progress at any cost
; if this means taking caulder off tje powell case
, thn thgat
' s fine
. there
' s aslo the prison guard subplot
. teh prison guard is plyed by john ashton
; the prison guard seems tothe enjoy mercilessly beating upon yhe psychotics under his supervision
,
and he
' s intrumental inthe helping tjhe story along to its obvious conclusion
. thne there
' s teh daugher subplot
, in whcih maura tierney
( palying the daughter
) must look very upset a lot of the time
; affter all
, she isnt the daughter ofthe a deranged man
. if some ofthe this stfuf sounds familliar
, thta
' s because htey
' re all devices tht have been used annd reused in countless otehr films
. thge evil doctor inthe patch adams is not unlike teh evil warden here
. the offensive caricatures ofthe mental patients lack the depth thgat the similar portrayals inaddition one flw over the cuckoo
' s nest had
. ashton
' s evil prision guard pales in comparsion to clancy brown
' s infront thge shawshank redemption
. hopkins
' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn iin the silence of tje lambs
. annd hten there
' s hte whole tarzan hting
, wich isnt more thna a littel bit obvious thru tyhe entire film
. perhaps whta irritates me most about instinct isnt tyhe half
- hearted attempt at philosophical depth
. the message powell brings back from the wild isnt nto a subtle one
: he thikns tyhat humans are
" takers
,
" that tehy exp
and anbd kill
and that we should all jsut live like gorillas
. i can sympathize whith that
,
but onyl whn it
' s in a compelling film
. tihs isnt thge kind of stupid movie
-
- just liek patch adams
-
- iin whitch a big group ofthe charactors
( psychotic inmates
, infront tihs case
) ries againnst tyhe evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards
. what doesnt any of this ahev to dont with a man who hasnt jsut spended twpo yeras ofthe his life with gorillas
? if all the subplots of instinct had beeen left onthe the cutting room floor
, we would have hadnt a thirty
- minute movei far superior to the two
- hour oney that i watched todya
. if the central idea had been developped beyond thte ood man tarzan premise
, hten we woudl realy ahev had something interesting
-
- a movie taht doesn
' t rely on tyhe strength ofthe its actors
.
