i looked at tghe
" internet movie database
"
' s awards section fo htis film
,
and found tath tihs was nominated for a golden globe for
" best picture
( drama
)
.
" anyone who
' s seen this film can bcak me uv onthe thsi
: tihs isnt the worst of teh
" graet
" diaster films
, anbd taht
' s not really saying a lot fo this film
.
" earthquake
" is basically notable beccause it originaly included some theatre hting where tjhe theatre shook when the big earthquake occured
. onthe video
, it
' s a bl
and
and slow
- moving film whcih gives us a bunch of diferent charachters
( the disaster film requisite
)
, thn brings them toghether infront the struggle against tyhe big diaster
. hwile htis worked in
, say
,
" the towering inferno
,
" it doesn
' t here forthe oney single reason
: we don
' t care about any ofthe tghe characters
. tje film gives us charlton heston
( in noe of many crap 70s films he made
, incuding
" skyjacked
" adn thast clasic
,
" soylent green
"
) as a rich man marryed to ava gardner
, who isnt having a little afair with a young single mom
( genieveve bujold
)
; a renegade police officer onthe suspention
( george kennedy
, infact his least humored performance
)
; iin the second weirdest subplot
, a motorcycle stuntman
( richard roundtree
, right aftter his
" shaft
" hting
) whose big stunt is he goes on a littel track thta goes upside down
( yea
, snore
)
;
and the weirdest subplot
: a miliraty man
/ bag boy at a grocery store who hasnt a littel thnig for buxom victoria principal
,
and eventualy gets vengance on those guys who made funn ofthe his hair
(
!
!
!
)
. inspite smaller subplots
, htere
' s a pointless bited baout peple who are flying over l
. a
.
( thge city inspite the film
, by the way
)
, one who
' s playing cards adn marryied to a boring non
- acting husban
( yuo thiunk thsi oney can go nowhere
? guess again
. he gets interested inaddition the final frames
)
; ther
' s genieveve bujold
' s moron son
, who hasnt a littel adventure wih wires
; annd forthe some much
- needed comedy
, htere
' s walter matthau
( billed as walter mutha
.
.
.
.
- tjhe onyl laugh in the film
)
, as a wild drunkard
, who
' s big moent isnt a dance he doesnt at a crtical tiome
. as forthe yhe actual
" earthquake
,
" it
' s rather a let
- down
. there
' s a full hour ofthe carachter
- setups
, none ofthe whic isnt interesting
,
then baout 10 mintues of shaking
, crumbling
, adn a bit where a hous alomst falls onthe bujold
( narrowly missing
)
. this film needed that wohle theatre
- shaking
: htey needed to wake everybody uv because htey weere so borde
. there
' s little suspense follwoing tjhe quake
, all
though thsi film trys fo it
. ther
' s an adventure in a crumbling high
- rise office buidling
, the wires with thge kid
, annd the movement of peopel who are all injured
. bu none ofthe these are all
- too suspenseful
. tghe finale with the heston
/ gardner
/ bujold lvoe triangle is ended in a basic flip
- ofthe
- the
- coni bit
, wich brings out a big let
- down
. adn htere
' s noone real finale
. even
" volcano
" ended nicely
, anbd thta movei really sucked
. nto onyl isnt it hokey
, bu you don
' t care baout any character
. who cares if heston dies
? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner
( altho i would ahve chosen gardner
, mailny on thge basis that she can actualy ect
)
? who cares if richard roundtree makes mony onthe his stupid
" stunt
?
" who cares if that idiot kid falls tothe his death onthe soem wires
? annd who cares baout that whole plane spiel
? if anything
,
" earthquake
" isnt worth a viewing fo tyhe same reason
" glen or glenda
?
" is
. i mean
, i laughed at tihs mroe thna i did at
" bio dome
.
"
but that
' s another story
( anbd review
)
. infact short
,
" earthquake
" gives disaster pics a bad nmae
.
