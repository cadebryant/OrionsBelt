i looked at hte
" internet movie database
" ' s awards section for this film
,
and foudn that htis ws nominated for a golden globe fo
" best picture
( drama
)
.
" anyone who ' s seen thsi film cxan bcak me up onthe tihs
: this isnt the worst ofthe teh
" great
" disaster films
,
anbd that ' s not really saying a lot for this film
.
" earthquake
" isnt basically notable because it originially included soem theatre thign where the theatre shook whn tje big earthquake occured
. onthe video
, it ' s a bland
annd slow
- moving film hwihc gives us a bunch of different cahracters
( teh diaster film requisite
)
,
thne brings them together in tyhe struggle agains the big disaster
. hwile this worked in
, say
,
" the towering inferno
,
" it doesn ' t here for oney single reason
: we don ' t care about any of teh characters
. the film gives us charlton heston
( inaddition one of many crap 70s films he made
, including
" skyjacked
"
and that classic
,
" soylent green
"
) as a rich man marryied to ava gardner
, who is having a little affair with a young single mom
( genieveve bujold
)
; a renegade police officer onthe suspention
( george kennedy
, in his least humored performance
)
; in thte second weirdest subplot
, a motorcycle stuntman
( richard roundtree
, right aftter his
" shaft
" thnig
) whose big stunt isnt he goes onthe a little track that goes upside down
( yea
, snore
)
;
and tjhe weirdest subplot
: a miliary man
/ bag boy at a groshury stoer who hasnt a littel thing for buxom victoria pricipal
,
annd eventally gets vengence onthe thsoe guys who made funn of his hair
(
!
!
!
)
. inthe smaller subplots
, there ' s a pointless bited baout peple who are flying over l
. a
.
( yhe city inaddition teh film
, by the way
)
, one who ' s palying cards
and marryied to a boring non
- acting husban
( ytou think this one cant go nowhere
? guess agina
. he gets interested infront thge fianl frames
)
; there ' s genieveve bujold ' s moron son
, who has a littel adventure wtih wires
;
annd for some much
- needed comedy
, there ' s walter matthau
( billed as walter mutha
.
.
.
.
- the only laugh in the film
)
, as a wild drunkard
, who ' s big moment is a dance he doesnt at a critical time
. as for the actual
" earthquake
,
" it ' s rather a let
- down
. ther ' s a full hour of charater
- setups
, none of whitch is interesting
,
thn about 10 mintues of shaking
, crumbling
,
adn a bit where a house almost falls onthe bujold
( narrowly missing
)
. tihs film needed that whole theatre
- shaking
: htey needed to wake everybody uv becasue htey were so borde
. ther ' s littel suspense follwoing thte quake
,
although this film trys fo it
. there ' s an adventure in a crumbling high
- ries office buildng
, the wires with tje kid
,
anbd tyhe movement ofthe peopel who are all injured
.
bu none ofthe theese are all
- too suspenseful
. the finale with tjhe heston
/ gardner
/ bujold love triangle is ended inaddition a basic flip
- ofthe
- the
- coin bit
, which brings outloud a big let
- down
.
and htere ' s no rela finale
. even
" volcanoe
" ended nicely
,
and that movei really sucked
. nto onyl is it hokey
,
bu you don ' t care about any charcter
. who cares if heston dies
? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner
(
although i owudl have chosen gardner
, mailny on tjhe basis thgat she can actually act
)
? who cares if richard roundtree makes monye on his stupid
" stunt
?
" who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires
?
adn who cares baout thta wohle plane spiel
? if anytying
,
" earthquake
" is worth a viewing for thte same reason
" glen or glenda
?
" isnt
. i mean
, i laughed at htis more than i did at
" bio dome
.
"
but that ' s anohter story
(
and review
)
. in short
,
" earthquake
" gives diaster pics a bad name
.
