' ve alwyas preferred mushrooms tothe blotter acid
. droping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded
; you haev no idea where tyhe peaks anbd valleys are
, noone idae when teh enxt terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat
,
and no idea how long tje ride wiull lastest
.
then there
' s the hard knot in your gut adn the clenched teeth that come withthe ingesting a strychnine
- laced dose
. mushrooms
, onthe yhe other h
and
, offer the psychodelic equivalent ofthe a leisurely ride onthe a ferris wheel
: a steady
, reassuring assent
, a short preriod ofthe thrilling motion adn color
, adn
then a smoothe l
anding
. acid isnt fo daredevils
; mushrooms are fo refined seekers of joy
. my point isnt that in fear
and loathing infact las vegas
, director terry gilliam has made an acid movei
, whn i wish he would have made a mushroom movie
. full of shocking sight gags
, aggressive images annd grotesque comic performances
, tje film certainly offers something forthe those fans of hunter s
. thompson
' s book who want to experiecne its twisted pharmacological world
- view fomr the inside outloud
. bu for thsoe ofthe us who just want tothe enjoy a well
- made film
, gilliam hasnt produced a mixed bag
. fear
and loathing tells the ostensibly true story ofthe how self
- professed
" gonzo
" journalist hunter s
. thompson
( johnny depp
)
and hispanic activist attornies oscar zeta actosta
( benicio del toro
)
, cameback tothe las vegas to cover a motorcycle race annd foudn themslves trapped inwhich thge middle of a district attorny
' s convention hwile ingesting eveyr conceivable drug available tothe a man ofthe means in 1971
. operating under teh pseudonyms of
" raoul duke
" annd
" dr
. gonzo
"
, the two men careen into vegas on an acid
and mescaline bender
, thne hole uv in a hotel sutie tothe binge onthe amyl nitrite
, cocaine
, tequila
and a rainbow of multi
- colored uppers
and downers
. they terrorize eveyr one htey meet
, mostly becouse eveyr noe they meet terrifies them
. duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into twon
, thne is attacked by horrifying lizards inwhich tghe casino lounge
. dr
. gonzo becomes enamured of a thick
- bladed hunting knife annd begs duke tothe throw the tape payler inot the bathtub with him jsut as jefferson airplane
' s
" white rabit
" reaches its climax
. annd these guys don
' t just trash hotel rooms
- tehy rape them
, humiliate them anbd leave them for dead
. that niether ofthe them ends uv dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence
, depending onthe your point of veiw
. thompson
' s book
, besides being a hilarious read
, hasnt st
anded thte test of tiome as an importamt historical doccument
. it simultaneously exposed teh 60
' s drug culture fo the sham that it wass
and exposed las vegas as teh palce where the american dream cameback to dieu
. pontificate all ytou wnat about how thte film illustrates thompson
' s message
,
but the truth is that
, stripped tothe its bare essentials
, what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy
. it
' s a cheech adn chong movie
. yuo
' re ther to watch depp anbd del toro ingest a lot of chemicals
and
then laugh at the results
: see johnny take drugs
, see johnny fall down
. there
' s nothing wrong iwth htis consept
,
but gilliam tries too hard
. this isnt a frantic movie
- all sweaty close
- ups
, wide
- angle lenses
, dutch tilts annd other
- worldly lighting schemes
. htere are times wehn gilliam raelly doesnt put a convincing representation ofthe an acid trip onthe tje screen
. bu to what end
? much ofthe the dialogue comes verbatim ffrom thompson
' s book
,
and there are soem priceless comic observations
.
but you
' re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera owrk
. htis brings us to teh performances
, which strike me as all wrong
. depp plays thompson as groucho markes filtered thru george c
. scott inwhich patton
- a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson
' s dialogue
. inaddition betweeen his severeal puking scenes
, del toro fares better as dr
. gonzo
,
but he also mumbles adn sputters so many ofthe his lines tyhat theri weight is lost
. watching theese two made me wish that the movei had beeen made twenty years ago
, withthe dan akroyd
and john belushi as thge leads
- nowe that would ahve beeen something tothe see
. it
' s intresting tothe onot tath alex cox
, credited as a co
- writter onthe tghe screenplay
, was orignially slated tothe direct befoer gilliam tookover over
. as much ofthe a fan as i am ofthe gilliam
' s work
, cox woudl have been tjhe better choice
. sid
and nancy
, cox
' s best wokr
, covered essentialy tje smae subject marter
, bu cox wass able to pull back
and allow the cahracters of sid vicious annd nancy spungen tothe carry the film
. gilliam commits thge compound sin of over
- directing his film while being uncertain ofthe his purpose
. waht kind of movei ws he trying tothe make
, anyway
? it doesn
' t try tothe be a cautionary tale
, annd it doesn
' t wrok as broad comedy
. if he had considered more carefully his purpose
, tyhe result would hvae been a much more interesting film
.
but i don
' t want tothe be too hard on it
. ther are some truely funny moments
, adn if you
' re in a ogod enought mood you might git a kick outloud ofthe it
. i do
, howver
, recommend watching fear
and loathing inthe las vegas under tghe influence of your favorite controlled substance
- i guarntee it iwll enhance yhe effect
.
