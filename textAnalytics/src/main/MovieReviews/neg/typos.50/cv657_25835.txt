wesley snipes is a master ofthe selecting bad acation roles
. murder at 1600
, u
. s
. marshals
, money train
, drop zone
, boiling point
,
and the ulitmate camp film
- passanger 57
. teh art ofthe war is anyother entry in tihs very ugli annd unique cateogry
. ultimatly
, it isnt littel more thna a ridiculous action film wtih a plot as believable as the warren report
, ugli violence thyat would ahve made peckinpah cringe
,
and terrable acting by b
- list actors liuke michael biehn annd anne archer
. oddly
, it feels liek the undiscovered sequal tothe another snipes
" masterpiece
,
" rising sun
. hte movei revolves around the convinient story of a special un operative caught uv inthe a secret muder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador
, tghe chinese triad brotherhood
, a rich chineese businessman
( played by
? tyhat bad guy from rising sun
, cary
- hiroyuki tagawa
) a chinese un interpreter
, adn
, inexplicably
, donald sutherl
and
. tje film ends with moreso confusion than a boatload ofthe chineese immigrants trying to regisetr at ellis isl
and
. or shoudl i sday the film ends with tghe most blatant ripoff ofthe both the matrix anbd all ofthe john woo
' s hong kong films combined
. i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had tjhe gumption to not only star in this action dud bu also act as one ofthe the producers ofthe hte film
. i ususally enjoy snipes
' movies
-
though his dramtic roles better sohw off his creativity as an ator thna tyhe flashiness of his action films
. simpley
, i am amazed by the how inane the scirpt wass
, filled with terrable cliches
and extremly voilent acation sequences
. director christian duguay
( screamers
) hasnt a stange attraction tothe tjhe viciousness ofthe voilent acts
-
- showing splattering brains
, people impaled with broken shards of glass
, anbd lots ofthe gargling
and gagging as blood sprays everywhere
. it alsot sickens me tothe know that oliver stone
, oen of the greatest directors wokring todya
, had his h
and in producing this monstrosity
. i guess snipes sold stone on hte conspiracy angle
and stone chose nto tothe read tghe script
, watch the dailies
, be involved infront casting
, or anything eles
-
- or else he
' d be filing a cout order tothe remove his name fomr the credits
. it
' s also seems evident tht witht the russkies as our new bosom buddies
and thte middle eastern terrorist angle bieng beaten to death infact the last cuple of years that the newyorker internation enemies inaddition hollywood are the communist chinese
. i
' m sure over tje next couple of monthes
, even more
" chinese conspiracy
/ martial
- arts action flicks
" are going to be popping up in your local multiplex
. hopefully htey won
' t inlude wesley snipes
