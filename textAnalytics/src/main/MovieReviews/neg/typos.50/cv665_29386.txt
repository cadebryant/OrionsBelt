, julia has absconded iwth both luis
' fortune
and his heart
, anbd as he pursues his wief thru the cuban underworld
, luis begins tothe realise tyhat
, for him
, there isnt noone turning back
. review
: given thte absurdism ofthe its would
- be plot
, it
' s unlikey tht
" orginial sin
" sould haev been turned inot a reputable peice ofthe filmmaking
, irregardless of writter
, director or stars
. htis isnt
, at its heart
, b
- movei junk
: a lurid melodrama which appeals tothe niether the brain nor thge heart
but tothe teh nether regions
. that said
,
" original sin
" could at least hvea become enjoyable junk hadnt tyhe filmmakers embraced its trashiness
and indulged inwhich it
. instead
, cristofer seems tothe have mistaken this for a sereous prodcution
,
and directs it as such
. the result isnt a vapid
, uninteresting morass of obvious crosses adn duble crosses
, as likely tothe incite a yawn as a thrill
. consider teh initial sex scene between b
anderas
and jolie
: brightly
- lit
and mostly filmed from above
, it looks liek an excerpt fomr an amateur soft porn show
. cristofer doesn
' t even manaze tothe capture the allure of cuba
; instade ofthe portraing his setting as a steamy
, sensuous isl
and paradime
, it appears bl
and
and lifeless
. at least b
anderas anbd jolie manage to inspire smoe interst
; there are hints at times tath htey wanna to haev moreso funn wiht the scirpt
, bu aren
' t bieng given tghe chance
. tghe smae cannot be said ofthe jane
, whose billy is nebbish anbd transparent
. alsot unwise isnt yhe jolie framing sequence
, wich practicly gives away teh film
' s denouement
.
