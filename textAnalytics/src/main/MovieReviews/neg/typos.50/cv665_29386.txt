synopsis
: wealthy cuban landowner luis
( banderas
) gets more tahn he bargained for when he sends awya fo an american bride
. not only doesnt his newyorker wife turn outloud to be the beautiful julia
( jolie
)
, she also harbours a secret past ofthe dubious merit
. soon
, julia hasnt absconded wtih both luis ' fortune
and his heart
,
annd as he pursues his wife thru teh cuban underworld
, luis beggins to realise thast
, for him
, htere isnt no turning back
. review
: given hte absurdism of its woudl
- be plot
, it ' s unlikely thyat
" origional sin
" could ahve beeen turned into a reputable peice of filmmaking
, reguardless of writter
, director or stars
. thsi isnt
, at its heart
, b
- movei junk
: a lurid meledrama whcih appeals tothe niether the brain nor thge heart
bu to tje nether regions
. thgat said
,
" originnal sin
" could at least haev become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness
adn indulged iin it
. instead
, cristofer seems tothe hvea mistaken thsi for a serious production
,
and directs it as such
. the result isnt a vapid
, uninteresting morass ofthe obvious crosses
and doulbe crosses
, as likely tothe incite a yawn as a thrill
. consdider the initial sex scene betwen banderas
and jolie
: brightly
- lit
annd mostly filmed from above
, it looks liek an exerpt ffrom an amateur soft porn show
. cristofer doesn ' t even manage to capture hte allure ofthe cuba
; instead of portraing his setting as a steamy
, sensuous island paradise
, it appears bland
anbd lifeless
. at least banderas
and jolie manaze tothe inspire some intrest
; there are hints at times tath they want to hvae mroe funn wih teh script
,
bu aren ' t being given the chance
. teh smae cannot be said of jane
, whose billy isnt nebbish
and transparent
. also unwise is the jolie framing sequence
, wich practicly gives awya the film ' s denouement
.
