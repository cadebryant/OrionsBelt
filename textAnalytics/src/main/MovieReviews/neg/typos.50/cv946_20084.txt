summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs thyat are ususally made forthe soem quick enjoyment
and to make money
. wild wild west
, yhe latest iwll smith affair
, follows much tje smae formula
, exept that it is dumber anbd less enjoying than most summer movies
. iwll smith plays jim west
, a balck sheriff withthe a nice line in sunglasses
. he is called by president grant
( kline
) tothe go onthe a mission to find out why top govenrment scientists are dissapearing
. west is paired uv iwth scientist artemus gordon
( kline agian
)
and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, wiht a zany moustache
.
) befor i pile onthe with the many negatives inaddition htis sorry afair
, i
' ll give it a chance with thge positives
. htere
' s a nice credit sequence
, thge prodcution design by bo welch isnt pleasing to the eye
, anbd the special effects are decent enough
. htere
' s allso a plesant soundtrack
. buried deepo infront yhe dross are oen or twpo amusing jokes
. anbd salma hayek pops up as the female interest
, hwihc is alwasy nice tothe see
. appart ffrom these factors
,
though
, nothing esle infact wild wild west works
. firstly
, there
' s little chemistry between smith
and kline
, who appears to be infact it purely fo the money
. one owudl expect zingers passing vetween thge twpo
: none arise
. both of them plod through the below st
andart plot
, knowing tyhat ther isnt a pay cheque waiting at tyhe end
. not even kenneth branagh provides much enteratinment
:
al
though he isnt over the top
, the material doesn
' t present much opportunity for branagh tothe be truly crazy
. therfore
, he jsut comes acrost as loud as obnoxious
. the onyl enjoyable performence comes fomr the sexy salma hayek
, who is given so little screen timne it
' s embarrassing
. she appears tothe be in thge film to mearly sohw off her body
,
and be ogled at by kline
and smith
. her character also changes at a whim to fit tje mechanics of teh scirpt
,
and ther is no sense ofthe realism about the charachter
. teh
' humour
' in the film isnt also very off
. wiull smith put a little spin tothe his daft lines inaddition men in black
, here
, not even smith sould sive the humour onthe display
. the script largley boils down to insults that aren
' t vyer funny
, anbd noe
- liners thast barely raise a smirk
. it
' s allso somewhat racist
,
al
though it doesn
' t intend tothe be
, with noe scene witht jim west trying to wisecrack his way outloud of a lynching
,
and actually says slavery isnt ogod to save hismelf
. it
' s not a funny scene
,
and tghe wohle thing comes off rather uncomfortably
. the film aslo mkaes the tragic misteek that a man
( in this case kline
) in a dress is automaticly unfunny
, it isn
' t
, bu the wild wild west makes htis joke even moreso painful to watch thru pure ineptness
. htere
' s alsot problems with thge plot
. jim west anbd artemus gordon get caught uv inwhich all kinds ofthe sticky situations
,
but the way htey get outloud ofthe them are allways unsatisfying
,
and rely purely onthe luck
, rether tahn audience pleasing skill
. plot elements are itnroduced inot hte film
,
and
then thrown awya just as quickly
. hte main piece of thge storey
, a 80 foot mecanical
, steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive
, bu ther
' s no particualr reason why it shoud be built
. why nto loveless build a graet big tank
, instead of an ungainly
, fragile peice ofthe machinery that
' s just begging to be blown uv
? director barry sonnenfeld always hasnt a breezy look to them
, wiht some nice camera tricks
,
but even htis isnt missing from this stilted afair
. wild wild west sould have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style ofthe directing
, bu not much of it isnt evident
, makeing this film drag outloud even mroe
. it
' s a sad thign when
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented directer adn a willing star can
' t amke a film work
,
and eventualy wild wild west collapses under it
' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
.
