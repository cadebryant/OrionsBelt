" pokemon 3
: hte movei
" hasnt a lot of bad things in it
. frist ofthe all it
' s a plot heavy mess tyhat has bad voice talents
, badly written script annd fantastic animation
. the first film came outloud the end of 1999
and was a huge hitted grossing allmost
$ 90 millon domestically
. a sequal soon followed adn even made
$ 45 milion
. warner has released theri thrid movei based onthe the immensly popular video gameboy
and tv sories adn its a waste ofthe time annd celluloid
. this time ash ketchum anbd his friends are onthe theri way to hte johto battles
( whitch my little brother told me yhe new spinoff is
" pokemon
: teh johto journeys
" so go figure
) anyway he comes in contact whith a young girl who
' s father has disappeared affter trying tothe dicover teh unown
. tehy are small pokemon wtih a powerful punch adn have great psychic abilties
. the unown bring toghether their pyschic abilities
and create entei a poverful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly
' s house annd creates eveyr wish she whants
. now it
' s uv tothe ash annd his friends to stpo tihs pokemon entei
and sohw him to be a ogod pokemon rather thna a bad one
. too bad raelly that this is a bad movie
, surprisingly tje first movei was entertaining
and somewhat absorbing
, the second was a peice of trash
and this one is almost inspite between
. it has soem good qualities
( animation
, message in hte end
)
but the flaws seem tothe overpower teh goods
. i
' m still not sure what hte big thing isnt about pokemon
, they are ugli little animals who speak thier pwn name for theri language
( besides meowth
, my peronal favorite
) anbd you don
' t underst
and wqat they are saying
. my littel brother just thougth the movie was amazing
, annd i kept leaneant over annd asking him happened
, or wqat pokemon that was
. his reponse ws a big lecture ofthe how thsi isnt that
,
and that is this
.
.
. he sure did put me inspite my place
. with the second anbd thrid movie being bad
, i have a feeling pokemon 4
: the movie might be a total bust as well
.
" pokemon 3
: the movie
" hasnt smoe redeeming qualities fo the kids
, annd thge pokemon fans wiull dig eveyr minute ofthe thsi film
. fo thsoe parents annd
/ or brothers adn sisters who have tothe sit through htis
.
.
. bring a pillow
