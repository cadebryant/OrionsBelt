the blues brothers wass a wonderfull film
, a hilarious comedy packed iwth ogod music
. it cried out fo a sequel
,
but john belushi ' s ultimely death seemed tothe eliminate tyhe idea
.
however
, eighteen eyars ahev pasted
,
and thge long dormant sequal has finally emerged
. unfortunately
, it ' s a sequal not worthy ofthe hte originnal
. teh film starts exactly eighteen eyasr aftter the frist oney ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) is just getting outloud ofthe jail
, his brother jake having recently died
. as in the firt film
, he frist visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
)
annd
then sets about getting tghe band bcak together
. john belushi ' s absence leaves a terrable hole in teh film
,
adn
although threee new charachters are creaeted to fill thte void
, it is still vrey onticeable
. firt
, htere ' s cabel
( joe morton
) hte illegimate son ofthe elwood ' s stepfather
( played by cab calloway in hte firt movie
)
. cabel is reluctant to join his destiny
,
and spends most of the movei as an illinois sheriff
, chasing tghe blues brothers band
. enxt
, there ' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes the new lead singer ofthe hte band
. finaly
, there ' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten eyar old orphan who tags allong with elwood
and eventually joins teh band
. tghe plotting ofthe thge film is hardly original
.
.
. it seems to be almsot a clone of the original
. elwood has to go tothe reluctantly retreive eahc member ofthe teh band
, they
thn travel
, hwile bieng pursued by the polical
,
and perform at several odd stops until they fianlly reach thge big concert finale
. thge first film hadnt neo
- nazis as tje random element
, tihs tyme arround
, the russion mafia
and a militia gropu fill thier role
. infact fatc
, the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complet that certain scenes are practically identical tothe the original
. remember tghe classic performance at country bob ' s
( where they liek both types of music
: ocuntry
annd western
) ffrom tyhe firt movie
? well
, tihs movie hasnt a performance at a country fair
, where tje band is expeced tothe play bluegrass music
. ther ' s the massive polical car pileup
,
altough tihs timne tjhe gag falls completelyl flat
. ther ' s even an excact replica of the convertion scene inaddition the curch of reverand cleophus
( james brown
)
. ther are plenty ofthe recuring charachters too
. in adition to mother stigmata
and reverend cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prision guard in thge first film
, makes an apearance here as thge prison warden
. as teh stars
, the new blues brothers don ' t live up tothe their legacy
. aykroyd is moreso loquacious
,
yet much flatter as elwood
. john goodman bearly hasnt a character as mighty mack
. joe morton has yhe deepest charachter
,
bu not a terribly intresting oney
, as cab
.
and waht ' s the dael witht yhe orphan
? it plays liuke a dseperate gimmick that doesn ' t mesh at all wtih hte rest ofthe the film
. at least bonifant isn ' t as precocious as he coudl hvae beeen in thge role
.
bu the true star
,
and the only saving grace
, of the film is yhe music
.
anbd yhe film is packed witht it
( even durig
adn after thte endig credits
)
.
although htere are noone brilliant mergers ofthe comedy
and song as in tjhe origonal ' s rawhide
/ stand by your man medley
, tyhe music is very much enjoyable
. tothe top it off
, teh film is packed to thge gills with cameo muscician appearances
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley
and steve winwood are just a sampling of tje multitude of stars that amke an appearance here
and htere
. unfortunately
, the music pauses here
and htere tothe allow inspite yhe familar plot
. if simply copying the orginal blues brothers wasn ' t bad enough
, writers aykroyd
and john landis dumb it down
, removing any memorable charachters
,
adn replacing them with flashy
,
but unbelievable
, magical gimmicks
. it ' s a shame
. buy tjhe sountrack
adn avoid the film
. better
yet
, rewatch the origonal
.
.
. you ' ll ahev a much better tiome
