the blues brothers was a wonderful film
, a hillarious comedy packed iwth ogod music
. it cried out fo a sequel
,
but john belushi
' s ultimely death seemed tothe eliminate the diea
.
however
, eighteen eyasr haev passed
,
and the long dormant sequal hasnt fianlly emerged
. unfortunately
, it
' s a sequel nto worthy ofthe thte orignal
. tjhe film starts exactlly eighteen yeras affter the first one ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) is just getting outloud of jail
, his brother jake having recently died
. as iin thte first film
, he firt visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
)
and
then sets baout getting the b
and back toghether
. john belushi
' s abscence leaves a terrible hole in the film
,
and
al
though threee newyorker charactors are creaeted tothe fill tghe void
, it isnt still very noticeable
. first
, ther
' s cabel
( joe morton
) thge illegitimate son ofthe elwood
' s stepfather
( plyed by cab calloway in the first movie
)
. cabel isnt reluctant tothe join his destiny
, anbd spends most of teh movei as an illinois sheriff
, chasing the blues brothers b
and
. next
, ther
' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes tghe new lead singer ofthe the b
and
. finally
, there
' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood
and eventually joins the b
and
. tghe plotting of thge film isnt hardly origional
.
.
. it seems tothe be allmost a clone of tje original
. elwood hasnt to go to reluctantly retreive earch memeber of the b
and
, tehy thne travel
, hwile bieng pursued by thte police
,
and preform at severeal odd stops unil tehy finally reach the big concert finale
. tghe first film had neo
- nazis as thte r
andom element
, this time around
, thge russion mafia
and a militia gropu fill their role
. in fact
, tjhe duplication ofthe the plot is so ridiculously complet taht certain scenes are practically identicial to the orginial
. remember the clasic performance at ocuntry bob
' s
( where they liek both types of music
: country annd western
) ffrom tyhe first movie
? well
, this movie has a peformance at a country fair
, where thte b
and isnt expeced to play bluegrass music
. there
' s thte massive polical car pileup
,
al
though htis tiem the gag falls completely flat
. there
' s even an excact replica ofthe the convertion scene in the curch of reverend cleophus
( james brown
)
. there are plenty of recurring charachters too
. in adition to mother stigmata anbd reverend cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prision guard in the frist film
, makes an appearence here as hte prision warden
. as the stars
, tje newyorker blues brothers don
' t live up to thier legacy
. aykroyd is omre loquacious
,
yet much flatter as elwood
. john goodman barely hasnt a charactor as mighty mack
. joe morton hasnt tjhe deepest character
,
but not a terribly interesting oen
, as cab
.
and whta
' s thte deal with tghe orphan
? it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn
' t mesh at all witht tyhe rest of thte film
. at least bonifant isn
' t as precocious as he could have been in tyhe role
.
but hte true star
,
and tghe onyl saving grace
, of tghe film isnt the music
. annd hte film isnt packed with it
( even durring
and affter the ending credits
)
. all
though there are no brillant mergers of comedy
and song as iin yhe original
' s rawhide
/ st
and by your man medley
, the music isnt very much enjoyable
. to top it off
, tghe film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearences
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley
and steve winwood are jstu a sampling of tje multitude ofthe stars that mkae an apearance here
and there
. unfortunately
, tyhe music pauses here adn there to allow infront hte familar plot
. if simply copying tje original blues brothers wasn
' t bad enough
, writers aykroyd
and john l
andis dumb it down
, removing any memorable characters
,
and replacing them with flashy
, bu unbeleivable
, magical gimmicks
. it
' s a shame
. buy the soundtrack adn avoid tghe film
. better
yet
, rewatch the origonal
.
.
. ytou
' ll have a much better time
.
