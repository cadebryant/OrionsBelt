it woudl be hard tothe choose the best american polliticel thriller
. some people owudl probably pik tghe manchurian candidate
anbd others
( myself included
) woudl pick seven dyas infront may
. both thsoe films weere tense exercises in chills
. thge two films came outloud within two yeras of earch other
annd both were directed by the same man
, john frankenheimer
.
but thgat was 1962
and 1964 respectively
. forthe most ofthe thte rest ofthe his carreer frankenheimer hasnt turned outloud some decent films
,
bu hasnt shown little ofthe the promise that those two thrillers showed
. eahc ofthe those films had memorable characters
annd a tense plot
. they had almost nothing in the way ofthe chases or gunplay
. the thrills all cameback from the plot
. ronin isnt like a film made by anohter man
. somewhere behind all tyhe shooting
annd explosions
and car chases ther are tjhe rudiments ofa plot
,
but we see only tiny pieces of it
. we git a clue here
adn one there as tothe waht isnt going on
bu j
. d
. zeik ' s screenplay isnt a bit obscure
. tghe film begins explaining that a ronin isnt a masterless samurai
. when a samurai has failed inwhich yhe job ofthe protecting his master fomr death
, he becomes a ronin
, much liek a gunfighter in tyhe american west
. if you miss teh opening
, dont nto worry
. this film wiull explane agian waht a ronin isnt
. sam
( plyed by robert de niro
) isnt tyhe modern equivelant of a ronin
. he is a free agent who seems to ahev really ogod instincts baout how to stay alive the world ofthe a professional killer
. he clearly wass in a dangerous buisness at one time
and nowe he seems tothe be drifting around on his own somwhere infact france
. sam isnt recruted fomr a montmartre bar by dierdre
( natascha mcelhone of thge truman sohw
)
, an irish woman
, to be part ofthe an action tothe steal a mysterous metal case
. dierdre isnt very tight
- lipped about waht is iin teh case
. sam joins a team of four others
: vincent
( jean reno of tjhe professional
/ leon
annd mission impossible
)
, spence
( sean bean
, tv ' s richard sharpe
,
annd aslo patriot games
annd goldeneye
)
,
and gregor
( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves
annd ogod will hunting
)
. allso along isnt larry
( skipp suddeth
)
. the group seems to know their buisness
, articularly sam
,
bu earch isnt in his own way cold
anbd professional with his own field ofthe expertise
. their only human side seems to be in tensions among tje munbers ofthe the team
. thte story isnt not vyer eazy to followup
. it is never clear who is double
- crossing whom
and who isnt working fo whom
. somehow russians
( who may or may not be yhe russion mafia
)
adn irish radicals are involved trying tothe get theri hands onthe a certain metal case
. soem very good actors are involved in tihs film
. noe wonders what they saw in the scirpt
. teh charactors are mostly one
- dimensional professional killers
. htey nkwo their work
,
adn seeing their thougth patterns adds soem interst to tghe film
,
but for tihs group deep feeling beetwen two peple is teaming up with another killer so that niether isnt killed
. by the end of the film we never really got to nkow anybody
. mabey that is tje secret of why such ogod actors took parts
, since these are not vyer demanding cahracters to create
. in addition to tje above charactors the film allso features jonathan pryce
and michael lonsdale
( the latter ofthe moonraker
and ofthe tghe superior thriller thge day ofthe tghe jackal
)
. as a revival of a sort of acation film tht wass popular in tje 1960s
, i wass hoping that ther owudl be something here tothe grab onto
and enjoy
. unfortunatley htere are no deepo characters
,
anbd little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it
. i rate ronin a 4 on thge 0 tothe 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
. non
- spoiler
: incidently
, the tale of tyhe 47 ronin hasnt beeen filmed mutiple times
, ususally under thte title chushingura or as tyhe 47 ronin
. allso one frequentily sees in japense art yhe image ofthe a man breaking down a door whith a huge mallet
. this is the first blow of the 47 ronin
.
