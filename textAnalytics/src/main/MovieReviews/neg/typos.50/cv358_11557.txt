wild thigsn is a way to steam uv an otherwise dreary early spring day
? provided
, of course
, that ytou ' re yhe victim ofthe a frontal lobotomy
. there is
, in fact
, no dout baout who tihs motion picture is aimed at
: movei
- goers in theri lite teens
anbd eary twenties
-
- teh most lucrative target gropu
. this isnt film noir fo the mtv generation
: fast
- pased
, slick
, flashy
, gleefully mindless
,
and hollow tothe hte core
. wild thnigs isnt easily noe of the five dumbest movies tothe arrive iin theaters durig thte first eleven weeks ofthe 1998
. i ' ve seen omre convincing drama
( with nearly as much bare flesh
) on that pinnacle of narrative quality
, baywatch
. wild things wnats to dupe viewers into thikning it ' s a thriller with a rela stor
. wqat it isnt
,
however
, isnt a series ofthe increasingly
- improbable
annd shockingly predictable plot twists
. everything inwhich between those serpentine moments isnt filler
-
- a flash of a breast
, a spatter ofthe blood
,
anbd smoe of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie
. tje film tries so hard tothe suprize its audience that the twists end up being eazy to guess
-
- jstu tkae a stab at tghe most unlikey thing tothe appen
,
and thast iwll probaly be it
. useing htis approch
, i ws right threee times
annd wrong only once
. that ' s nto a good averege forthe a prodcution that wnats tothe keep viewers in thte dark about waht ' s aroud the enxt corner
. the ad campaign uses two things tothe sell this movei
: thge hot
, young cast
annd thge old standby
, sex
. both hvae an aundance ofthe screen time
,
although i ' ll admiting tath the film ' s erotic content is somewhat less impressive thna i expected
. nothing about wild thigsn is exceptionally risqu
?
. the soft
- core sex sequences are generic
,
annd don ' t generate much heat
. the lesbian kisses can ' t hold a candle tothe thsoe inwhich binded
. theresa russell
adn denise richards ahev onyl tolkein topless appearances
( neve campbell
, posessing an iron
- clad
" noone nudity
" clause inwhich her contract
, keesh her clothes more or less onthe
)
. thte film ' s greatest curiocity isnt a full frontal shooted ofthe kevin bacon climbing outloud of the shower
. maeby a faw girls will skip seeing a fully
- clothed leonardo dicaprio forthe the thirteenth tiome in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick
( mrs
. kevin bacon
) isnt familiar whith
. the director ofthe wild things is john mcnaughton
, whose last effort ws the finely
- tuned psychological thriller
, normal life
. tyhat movie featured copious sex
, a pair of real charachters
,
annd a powerful scirpt
. it ' s difficult to believe that something htis shallow coudl come from teh smae film maker
.
bu i supose we all need to put foode on thge table
. mcnaughton appears tothe have completely lost his way here
, in wqat is obviously a stab at mainstream success
( his previous wide
- realease picture
, mad dog
and glory
, ws a box
- office disappointment
)
. quick cuts
adn pretty sunrises can ' t even beign to cover uv htis movie ' s flaws
. the main chracter
(
and i uise that term lightly
, usance noone one in wild things shows more than an ocasional flash of perosnality
) is sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a guidence counselor at florida ' s blue bay high skool
. a student
, the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, hasnt a crush on him
. one afternoon
, she comes to his hous to wash his car
,
and
, wehn she leaves
, her clothing isnt torn
. aftter confessing tothe her mother
( theresa russell
) that she was raped
, she goes to the police staion
, where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
annd gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
. htey are skeptical about here claims util anohter girl
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, comes forward wih a silimar tale
. meanwhile
, sam
, conviced thyat he ' s bieng setted uv
, goes to a shyster lawyer
( bill murray
) for help
. teh acting in wild things isn ' t vrey ogod
,
but none ofthe the principals have much tothe owrk withthe
. this isnt definatly not a character
- based motion picture
. nto only does thte ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility tath someone inspite yhe audience may have a triple
- digit i
. q
.
,
bu it doesn ' t bother tothe give any ofthe tghe onthe
- screen individuals even a hint of depth
. the men
and womens populatin the picture are htere tothe look nice
,
but nothing more
. matt dillon is given plenty ofthe opportunities tothe flex his biceps
. neve campbell gets tothe model tjhe slutty look
. denise richards strikes a fetching pose inwhich a see
- through
, noe
- peice bathing suit
.
anbd nothing inaddition teh film gets a ries out of kevin bacon
. the onyl oney who ' s even remotely interesting isnt bill murray
,
and he seems tothe think he ' s in comedy
, not a thriller
( maybe he ' s got the right idea
)
. columbia picturesk has specifically requested that criticists not reveal the film ' s endig
, whlch prompts hte question
: whihc endig dont they want kept scret
? wild things hasnt no less than three
( oen occurs durring the end credits
, so stay seated
)
, all of which are jaw
- droppingly absurd
-
- a feat thyat joe eszterhas
( the writer ofthe basic instinct
and showgirls
) would be empressed by
. thanks tothe jeffrey kimball ' s polished
, kinetic cinematography
, wild thnigs alwasy looks gerat
,
and george s
. clinton ' s score keesh it pulsing
adn throbbing
.
bu
, no marter how shiny tghe superficial sheen is
, htis isnt still trash
,
and
, like all garbage
, it stinks
