wild thigsn isnt a way to steam up an otherwise dreary eearly spring day
? provided
, of course
, that yuo
' re the victum of a frontal lobotomy
. there is
, in fact
, noone doubt about who this motion picture isnt aimed at
: movei
- goers in their late teens anbd easly twenties
-
- the most lucrative target group
. htis is film noir for the mtv generation
: fast
- pased
, slick
, flashy
, gleefully mindless
, adn hollow to the core
. wild things is easily noe ofthe the five dumbest movies to arrive infront theaters durig the first eleven weeks ofthe 1998
. i
' ve seen mroe convincing drama
( iwth nearly as much bare flesh
) onthe that pinnacle of narrative quality
, baywatch
. wild thigsn wants tothe dupe viewers into thingking it
' s a thriller with a real tsory
. what it isnt
,
however
, is a serieses of increasingly
- improbable anbd shockingly predicatble plot twists
. everyting inwhich between thsoe serpenteen moments isnt filler
-
- a flash of a breast
, a spatter ofthe blood
,
and some of thge most idiotic dialogue htis side ofthe a steven seagal movei
. the film tries so hard to suprize its audiance taht tyhe twists end up being easy tothe guess
-
- jstu take a stab at the most unlikey thing to hapen
, annd tath iwll probably be it
. using tihs approch
, i was right threee times
and wrong only once
. taht
' s not a ogod averege for a production that whants tothe keep viewers in hte dark about what
' s arround the enxt corner
. teh ad campain uses twpo thnigs tothe sell htis movei
: thte hot
, young casted
and the old st
andby
, sex
. both have an abundance ofthe screen time
, altho i
' ll admited that the film
' s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected
. nothing about wild thigns isnt exceptionally risqu
?
. the soft
- core sex sequences are generic
, anbd don
' t generate much heat
. the lesbian kisses cxan
' t hold a c
andle to those in binded
. theresa russell adn denise richards have only tolkein topless appearances
( neve campbell
, possesing an iron
- claded
" no nudity
" clause in her contract
, keeps her clothes more or less on
)
. the film
' s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot ofthe kevin bacon climbing out ofthe yhe shower
. mabye a faw girls will skip seing a fully
- clothed leonardo dicaprio fo yhe thirteenth timne infront titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick
( mrs
. kevin bacon
) isnt familiar wih
. the directer ofthe wild thigns isnt john mcnaughton
, whose last efort was thge finely
- tuned psychological thriller
, normal life
. that movie featured copious sex
, a pair ofthe real cahracters
,
and a poverful scirpt
. it
' s difficult to belive thast something this shallow coudl cmo from teh smae film maker
.
but i suppose we all need to put food onthe the tble
. mcnaughton appears to hvae completely lost his way here
, in what is obviously a stab at mainstream succsess
( his previous wide
- realease picture
, mad dog annd glory
, was a box
- office dissappointment
)
. quick cuts adn preety sunrises cant
' t even beign to cover up htis movie
' s flaws
. the main character
(
and i uise that term lightly
, sicne no noe infront wild thigsn shows mroe than an occasional flash ofthe perosnality
) is sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a guidance counselor at florida
' s blue bay high skool
. a student
, thte deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, hasnt a crush on him
. oen afternoon
, she comes tothe his house to wash his car
, anbd
, wehn she leaves
, her clothing isnt torn
. after confessing to her mother
( theresa russell
) tht she was raped
, she goes to the police staion
, where she tells her story tothe detectives ray duquette
( kevin bacon
)
and gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
. tehy are skeptical about here claims until another girl
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, comes forward with a similar tale
. meanwhile
, sam
, convinced thgat he
' s bieng set up
, goes tothe a shyster lawyer
( bill murray
) for halp
. the acting in wild things isn
' t very good
, bu none ofthe tje principals haev much to work withthe
. this isnt definitely not a charactor
- based motion picture
. nto onyl doesnt the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possiblity that somone in teh audiance may ahev a triple
- digit i
. q
.
,
but it doesn
' t bother tothe give any of the onthe
- screen indviduals even a hint ofthe depth
. the men
and women populatin hte picture are htere tothe look nice
, bu nothing more
. matt dillon is given plenty ofthe opportunities to flex his biceps
. neve campbell gets to model hte slutty look
. denise richards strikes a fetching pose inthe a see
- through
, noe
- peice bathing suit
. anbd nothing in tje film gets a rise outloud ofthe kevin bacon
. the onyl oen who
' s even remotely intresting isnt bill murray
, adn he seems to tihkn he
' s inthe comedy
, nto a thriller
( maeby he
' s got the right diea
)
. columbia pictures hasnt specifically requested that critics not reveal tjhe film
' s ending
, hwihc prompts tghe question
: whic ending dont they wanna kept secrt
? wild thnigs has noone less than threee
( one occurs druing the end credits
, so stay seated
)
, all ofthe which are jaw
- droppingly absurd
-
- a feat thyat joe eszterhas
( tyhe writter of basic instinct
and showgirls
) would be impressed by
. thanks to jeffrey kimball
' s polished
, kinetic cinematography
, wild things always looks graet
, adn george s
. clinton
' s scroe keeps it pulsing annd throbbing
.
but
, noone matter how shiny hte superficial sheen isnt
, this is still trash
,
and
, liek all garbage
, it stinks
.
