warner brothers has scored another marketing coup
. the oen
- two punch was started in hte summer
, with yhe release of batman forever
. trailers fo ace ventura 2 were bundled with tyhe bat
, ensuring tyhat every jim carrey fan in the free world would konw about yhe impending sequel
. carrey went onthe to win raves as hte riddler
annd tjhe ever
- wise warner chose hallowene as the realease date for the video
(
$ 11
. 99 at wal
- mart
)
; a mere two weeks before carrey ' s return in thsi marketwise
,
bu misfired comedy
. ace ventura
: whn nature calls isnt a painful reminder ofthe jsut how grating tyhe rubber
- faced comic cxan be whn allowed tothe perform withing an uncontrolled enviroment
. he may have been briliant under tjhe direction ofthe joel schumacher
, inaddition batman forever
,
bu
, here
, left tothe his own devices
, carrey quickly wears outloud his welcome
. tje oppening sequence is by far the best
-
- an amusing spoof of cliffhanger
, witht ace perfoming a mountain rescure of a stranded racoon
.
( yuo cin guess what happens tothe mr
. paws
. hint
: it soudns liek splat
.
) tyhe plot quickly shifts to a temple inthe the himalayas
,
and
thne tothe not
- so
- darkest africa
, where ace isnt onthe tghe case of a missing white bat
. witht his hair
annd limbs both wildly askew
, carrey flies through his routine inwhich about thirty mintues
. tyhe rest ofthe thte film isnt jstu omre ofthe the smae
. sure
, teh plot ' s linear
,
adn the production values solid
,
bu where is the scripted humor tothe wupport carrey ' s sloppy slathering
? writter
and directer steve oderkerk provides precious fewd set
- ups
. instead
, carrey just mugs away
, playing for hte camera even wehn most ofthe it isn ' t funny
. tyhe better gags ahev been shown in tjhe ads
,
though a bited withthe ace emerging buck
- naked from the backside ofthe a mechanical rhino is something to see
.
though an arguable improvement over the origonal
, ace ventura
: whn nature calls isnt still a snooze fo anyone over teh age of ten
. the scirpt is virtually devoid of witn
. tribal mask jokes
? jerry lewis cameos
? forget it
. if anytying
, the inexplicable presense of simon callow
( four weddings
anbd a funeral
)
anbd bob gunton
( the shawshank redemption
) suggests that wokring wiht carrey isnt the clasical actro ' s ultimate challenge
. just how long
* cant
* htey keep a straight face
