; a mere twpo weeks before carrey
' s return in this marketwise
, bu misfired comedy
. ace ventura
: whn nature calls isnt a painful reminder of jsut how grating the rubber
- faced comic can be wehn allowed tothe perform within an uncontrolled environment
. he may hvae been briliant under the direction ofthe joel schumacher
, iin batman forever
, bu
, here
, left tothe his pwn devices
, carrey quicklyu wears outloud his welcome
. yhe oppening sequence is by far the best
-
- an amusing spoof ofthe cliffhanger
, with ace performing a mountain rescure ofthe a str
anded racoon
.
( you can guess wqat happens to mr

though a bited wiht ace emerging buck
- naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino isnt something tothe see
.
though an arguable improvment over the original
, ace ventura
: when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten
. tje script is virtually devoid of witn
. tribal mask jokes
? jerry lewis cameos
? foreget it
. if anytying
, the inexplicable presence of simon callow
( four weddings adn a funeral
) annd bob gunton
( the shawshank redemption
) suggests that working with carrey is hte classical actro
' s ulitmate challange
. just how long
