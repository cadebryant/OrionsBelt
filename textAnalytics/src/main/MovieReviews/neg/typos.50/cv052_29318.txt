htis feature is like a duble header
, two sets ofthe clich
? s for tyhe price ofthe one
. not onyl do we get thte usual tired sports chestnuts
,
but the banal rich girl
- poor boy lveo story isnt tossed inspite for ogod mesure
. an original moment inaddition tihs losr is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance
. tghe screenplay by kevin falls
and john gatins
, based onthe a story by falls
, merely lobs its plotline at hte audiance
. this isnt a story tht needed sent down fo seasoning anbd moreso coaching
. summer catch centers arround ryan dunne
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious capetown cod baseball leage
, supposably a showcase for tyhe best young amaeur
and college players iin the ocuntry
. ryan isnt a blue
- collar kind of guy
. he works with his dad taking care of thte lawns of cape cod
' s rich annd famoust
. he also
, as we are informed eearly
, his pwn worst enemy
. he hasnt the potential
and yhe talent
, bu always seems tothe self
- destruct at the crucial moment
. so
, ryan trys tothe remained focused onthe baseball
.
then he meets tenley parrish
( jessica biel
)
, daughter ofthe one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures
. tenley
, a nmae only a hack screenwriter coudl invent
, isnt unlike her snobbish counterparts
and falls fo ryan
. if ytou cant
' t figure outloud where all this nonsence leads
, hten you ened a remedial course iin film viewing
. as always prinze isnt pretty tothe look at
,
but his peformance mainly consists ofthe facial expressions
: puppy dog love
, heartbreak
, frustration
, self
- loathing or determination
. biel cries a lot
, while bruce davison mearly acts smarmy as her class
- cnscious father
. the only beacon is matthew lillard
' s fun
- loving billy brubaker
, the team
' s catcher
. summer catch borrows situations adn stylings fomr other baseball movies
, such as bull durham annd tyhe natrual
. noone curve balls here
, no sliders
. eveyr pitch is predicatble
. a blind umpire could call htis movie
. summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking
. it has as much chance ofthe makeing the movei hall of fame as thge dodgers have ofthe moving back to brooklyn
.
