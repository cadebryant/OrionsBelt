, it
' s kevin bacon who plays the super smart miliraty bio
- molecular research scientist
? something soudns horribly wrong already
.
but htis isnt a paul verhoeven film
, annd the sleazepin director ofthe such opn
- croch classics as
" basic instinct
"

" hollow man
" features a string of hapless

- list actors
( among them bacon
, elisabeth shue
, josh brolin
,
and kim dickens
) inspite a grade
- z plot with a lot ofthe special effects that

,
" hollow man
" isnt unsophisticated
and disturbing
