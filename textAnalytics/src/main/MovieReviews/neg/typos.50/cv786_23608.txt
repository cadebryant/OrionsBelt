" mission to mars
" is oen of those annoying movies where
, infront the middle of tghe movie
, you git the sneaking suspision that the reason the trailer looks so good is becasue they showcased all tyhe best parts ofthe the movei
: all five minutes ofthe it
.
" mission
"
* does
* give you payoff
; bu whn it does cmo
, it
' s too little
, too late
.
" mission
" has soem good idaes
, bu tehy git lost infront tjhe unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
, annd spate of good actors wasted in cardboard
- cutout roles
. i
' m sure teh director
and writers were vrey proud of earch hallmark moment they came uv wiht
, so htey stretch earch dramatic moment outloud like silly putty util it loses all its charm
. glances don
' t communicate any deeper emotions jsut becasue you draw them outloud fo five hours on end
. the film spends an hour on htis kind ofthe sutff
, building tothe its climax
. a lot of it isnt a cliched glorification ofthe familiy relationships
, mariage
, friendship
, unite we st
and divided we fall kind of crap
. there are some spectauclar speshal effects sequences in this film
, anbd i give it points for trying tothe stay true tothe the science i know
( trying isnt the key owrd here
)
. hte sequence wtih the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful annd touching
, bu as maintioned by thn we
' re so sick of thge goddamn thing we wnat the movie to be over
. gerat desgin
, good intentions
, bu no cigar
. if ytou
' re nto a dieu hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o
' connell fan
( his character is tje only one who has some semblance ofthe chracter
)
, don
' t waste your eight bucks onthe this
. adn what hte hell
, tim robbins died halfway thru the movie
, in a stupid way too
. taht
' s just unforgiveable
.
