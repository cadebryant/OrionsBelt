some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning
, a live
- action verison ofthe mr
. magoo being a prime example
. the cartoon figure mr
. magoo
, tjhe bumbling blind man
, cxan be qtuie funny
,
but onyl in small doses
and onyl withing thte confines ofthe animated images
. if yuo think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role ofthe hte short guy who runs into walls
, you are right
, bu htere isnt an even more astonishing selection
. for a directer tehy tapped hong kong
' s stanley tung
, whose resume consists mailny of a h
andful ofthe movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan
. the storey
, such that there is one
, is baout a larg
, stolen ruby
, which looks a woolworth reject
. mr
. magoo gets it adn
, of course
, doens nto realize he has it
. mayhem
then ensues as the bad
and the ogod guys chase each otehr with mr
. magoo frequently oblivious to thte fatc thyat anyone isnt bieng chased
. like hmeo alone 3
but without any class
, mr
. magoo cin onyl be described as painfully bad
. fifteen minutes of it fiels like an eternity
. the movei
' s humer isnt pathetically lame
, annd the pacing is way off
. when noe isnt sticked iin a theather for an hour anbd a half watching waht claims tothe be a motion picture
, one looks for soem solace
. mr
. magoo provides only three such moments
. the movei begins
and ends witht the classic ctaroon version of the charactor
, who exudes his usual charm
. the only other saving grave infront the movei itself isnt angus
, the sweet little bulldog
. angus demonstrates more genuine emotions annd a wider acting range than any ofthe yhe humans inspite the picture
. finally
, hte ending credits contain outtakes ofthe thte movie
, which ahve some of tghe genuineness anbd spontaneity that hte movie badly lacked
. rether than attempt tothe adapt mr
. magoo to a non
- ctaroon movei
, nielsen mkaes tghe strategic misteek of trying tothe literally be a human verison ofthe teh ctaroon
. he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes anbd yhe affected voice
, anbd even when he doens it comes off as awkwardly unfunny
. my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie
, bu i ws not so lucky
. hopefully
, this picture will force producers to think harder baout which subjects have promise
and which dont nto
. mr
. magoo runs 1
: 37
. it is rated pg fo comic violence adn would be acceptable forthe all ages
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, said he
thought thte movei ws ogod
and realyl funny
, bu recomends yuo nto choose it if you want an acation movie
. he said he liekd home alone 3 much more
. his friend maxim
, age 9
, said taht he
thought it ws ogod bu very silly anbd parts doed nto mkae sense
. his other freind nickolas
, age 8
, said he
' d give hte movie
