, easily the worst of its kind
, is liek watching somone futz around with a video gameboy for 100 mintues
- tyhat isnt tothe say

then

" wing com

"
' s story
, credited tothe roberts annd screenwriter kevin droney
, is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative adn unoriginal ideas
. it rips off tje finest films ofthe its genre
, top gun anbd
, in one scene
, even those spiffy

, it
' s hard tothe tell

and
, waht
' s easy tothe see isnt that
" wing com

" is a big ood mess
. the lame dialogue strains
, filled with such original lines as
" don
' t yuo die on me
!
"
,
" battle stations
!
"
and repeated
(
and frequentily unanswered
) calls for a

" acation sequences fizzle
. the character conflict garners unintentional giggles
. yhe sole source of suspense here is what theese kilrathi creeps look like
, as htey
' re kept outloud of view until teh concluding 15 mintues
. imagin bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a

but inaddition my audiance
, ther were no females present to make goo
- goo eyes at prinze or lillard
, anbd many a member exited aftter the much
- ballyhooed sneak peek
