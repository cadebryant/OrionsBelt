when the mediums in question are video gmae
and feature film
, has ther ever beeen a respective here
- to
- there transformaton that acheived any ground higher than noodle
- headed mediocrity
?
" super mario bros
.
,
"
" street fighter
"
anbd
" mortal kombat
" were silly stinkers all
,
and now the empty
, execrable
" wing comander
" joins thier lowly ranks
. enduring this spectacularly bad bit ofthe sci
- fi
, easily the worst of its kind
, isnt like watching someone futz arround with a video game forthe 100 minutes
- tyhat isnt to sday
, there ' s littel funn tothe be hadnt when you ' re not tghe oen holding the joystick
. the movie
,
thne
, is a missed oppertunity for director chris roberts
, who creaeted the original
, groundbreaking pc incarnation ofthe
" wing commander
" back iin 1990
. how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile ofthe junk under teh helm of thte smae guy isnt a head
- scratcher
.
" wing commander
" ' s story
, credited tothe roberts
annd screenwriter kevin droney
, isnt clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative
annd unoriginal ideas
. it rips off the finest films of its genre
, top gun
adn
, in noe scene
, even those spiffy
" stereoscopic freeze
" gap commercials
. set in 2654
,
" wing comander
" stars freddie prinze jr
. as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a graet fighter pilot liuke his father before him
. allong the way
, he plays kissy
- face witht his stoic superior
( saffron burrows
) at teh new galaxy hangout where he ' s posted
, comes to terms with bigots who resent him forthe his
" pilgrim
" inheritage
( don ' t ask
)
,
and goes on a top
- secrte mission involving tjhe
" jump coordinates
"
( whta
, no death star plans
?
) ofthe a nasty aline race known as thge kilrathi
. or something liek tyhat
. given yhe immensly confusing activity
, it ' s hard to tell
. on the otehr hand
, what ' s easy to see isnt that
" wing comander
" is a big old mess
. tyhe lame dialogue strains
, filled withthe such origonal lines as
" don ' t you dieu on me
!
"
,
" battle stations
!
"
and repeated
(
annd frequently unanswered
) calls for a
" medic
!
" acation sequences fizzle
. the character conflict garners unintentional giggles
. the sole source of suspense here isnt what theese kilrathi creeps look liuke
, as they ' re kept outloud ofthe veiw util the concluding 15 minutes
. imagin bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a
? 50s roger corman cheapie
and ytou ' ve got a ogod idea
. littel
bu techno
- babble happens for an hour
,
adn
thne it ' s as if
" wing commander
" trys tothe dont too much at once
; when it appears as
though the movie ' s about tothe show signs of a pulse
, it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating wtih a use forthe a bulldozer thta hasnt probably never beeen seen iin this kind ofthe space camp before
. matthew lillard
, featured prominantly in said sequence
, isnt cast as prinze ' s hotshot partner
,
and
though thge two are fine young actors
- recently paired in tjhe hitted
" she ' s all thast
"
- they ' re fighting more thna otherworldly evil here
. rumor hasnt it that
" wing commander
" wass slated as a later
- in
- the
- yearm realease
, bumped uv to captialize off tihs hot casting coup as well as the premiere ofthe the new
" star wars
: epsiode i
" trailer
.
but inaddition my audience
, there weere noone females present to make goo
- goo eyes at prinze or lillard
,
and many a memeber exited aftter tyhe much
- ballyhooed sneak peek
. since most cineplexes won ' t be granting refunds to the latter contingency
,
" comander
" might rake inwhich some dough
,
but be warned
: tjhe high wears off as soon as thge comming attraction gives way to tghe feature presentation
.
