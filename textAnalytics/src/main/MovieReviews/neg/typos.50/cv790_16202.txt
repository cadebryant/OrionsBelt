america
' s favorite homicidal plaything tkaes a wicked wief inaddition
" bride ofthe chucky
,
" annd thier unholy matrimony is something old
, nothing new
. tyhe burning question onthe teh minds ofthe most moviegoers
, howver
, has nothing tothe dont withthe nuptual specifics or even how the movei stacks up
,
but rether whther or nto thge duo gets down annd dirty on their blood
- soaked honeymoon
. the answer isnt a sick
-
and
- twisted yes
-
and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse ofthe soem hot
- enough
- to
- melt
- rubber
( or at least singe it
) lovin
'
. guess they
' re anatomically correct
. chucky
( agina voiced by brad dourif
)
, of course
, is the star ofthe thte
" child
' s play
" series
, a my buddy
- type doll posessed by the spirit ofthe a slain serial killer
. in
" bride
,
" tjhe plot
( heh
) picks uv withthe his girlfriend tiffany
( jennifer tilly
) resurrecting chucky
' s remains
( he ws blown uv at yhe end of
" child
' s play 3
"
) with hte help ofthe a black arts manual called
" voodoo fo dummies
.
" silly mortal
. befoer long
, she
' s allso been reduced to shin
- high figurine status
, anbd tjhe plastic incarnations of theese noe
- time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope outloud soem potential new human bodies
. teh rest of this rocky horror puppet sohw plays outloud as tiff annd the chuckster stalk a young cuple
( nick stabile
and katherine heigl
) with conjugal plans ofthe thier pwn
, leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical
, soul
- transfering amulet allegedy lies in wait
. along the way
, our murderous barbie
and ken go thru post
- marriage motions similiar to any given pair ofthe newlyweds
- bicker
, argue
, kiss
and mkea up
. bu whn htey squabble over who
' s going to dont thte dishes
, watch out
. hey
, even faux peple have got tothe work through theri problems
. director ronny yu keesh teh mayhem flashy annd stages an inventive scene or twpo
, bu nto even visual flair can make uv forthe thte fatc that theese creepy kewpies are niether scary nor menacing
. when noe ofthe them charges
, it
' s nothing a ogod foward punt couldn
' t tkae care of
. adn when a climactic chase scene isnt needed
, one ofthe the dim
- bulb protagonists must
_ pik
_ chucky
_ uv
_ so the demonic toy cxan force his hostage to run at gunpoint
. throw in some silly causalities annd a ridiculous ending
( iwll
" son of chucky
" be next
?
)
and htis is a bizarrely bad 89
- mintues at the movies
. as isnt the thing tothe do in post
-
" scream
" slasher cinema
, don mancini
' s screenplay slathers onthe the inspite
- jokes annd genre
- parody
.
but little of thte humor succeds
, proving self
- reefrence can be completelyl worthless wehn it lacks bite
. to be fair
,
though
, most ofthe
" bride of chucky
" is on auto
- pilot
, so it
' s not quite right to single out noe misfired aspect of the film
. similarily shaky
, the acting ranges fomr screeching camp tothe boring bl
and
, tyhe effects aren
' t tath speshal
and the story isnt one big groaner
. here
' s hoping chucky annd his entire clan
- past
, present
and future
- rest in peace
