) ytou nkwo whta
? i ' ll stpo with the list now
.
.
. the alphabet isn ' t big enought anyway
. the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year ood do a re
- rwite
.
" thte kid is ogod
!
" he must hve said
. maria pitillo isnt looking tothe become a name in hollywood by starring inspite this potential blockbuster
. bad move
, maria
. acting doesn ' t get much worse than her turn as broderick ' s ex
- flame
. matthew broderick is a ogod atcor
,
bu ytou ' d never give him a chance if godzilla were hte only film of his ytou ' d seen
. jean reno needs tothe pick his american films a bited mroe carefully
. at times
, godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker
, abrahams
, zucker film
.
( airplane
!
, naked gun
.
) tje jokes are indeed tht bad
.
bu jstu when ytou thiunk tghe filmmakers are haveing fun witht you
, htey take themslves seriously
. how dabree htey
! godzilla would ahve beeen better if it had onyl thrown in visual sight gags
and fart jokes
. at least
then we owudl nkow we weere suppossed to laff
. each
and eveyr charachter in godzilla isnt beyond stupid
and i was realy pulling for the beast tothe kill omre of them
. emmerich did dont oney thign
,
though
.
(
annd i ' ve noone idea if it was intentional
.
) he made me sympathize with godzilla
. his attackers weere so damn dumb that i falt sorry fo him being pelted with bullets
annd missles
.
but what made me fiel even sorrier forthe him was that his famous name iwll always be attatched to one ofthe the worst films hollywood hasnt ever produced
.
