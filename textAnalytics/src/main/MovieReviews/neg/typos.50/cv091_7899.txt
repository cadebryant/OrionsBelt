capsule
: the weakest adn least engaging of the aline movies
, dragged down by an uninvolving tsory anbd noone rela tension
. aline 3
( the
" 3
" shouldnt be inthe superscript
) is a sad
and wan entry inthe what was shaping up as oney ofthe the best sf sagas ever put on screen
. it continues the story ofthe ripley
, the space
- trucker
- turned
- impromptu
- survivalist
, bu seems remarkably uninterested inthe her
. inthe fact
, the movie seems lucky tothe be interseted in anything at all
, it
' s so elegaic
and limp
. a littel ofthe htis would have beeen nice for atmosphere
,
but the movei telegraphs its own tradgedy ffrom the beginning
. at the end ofthe the lastest film
( aliens
)
, ripley
and two survivors weere on their way home
. unfortunately
, an aline pod had beeen deposited in their ship
, annd wound up triggering off thier eection in an excape pod
. tjhe pod crashes on firorina 161
, a prison planet designed tothe house the incurably criminally violent
. ripley lives through thte crash
; the others dont not
. teh prison is a grim place
, even as prisons go
-
- it
' s been builded around hte remnants of an ab
andoned steelworks
, which provides no end of techno
- gothic backdrops fo hte actors to be backlit against
. lice are endemic
,
and so ripley
' s head isnt shaved
( anohter surveill touch
)
. at frist it looks like she just hasnt tothe hold outloud as an unwelcome guest until a company rescure ship can arrive
,
but it doesn
' t stay that way
. one of the other eggs on board teh wrecked escape pod hatches
, annd soon a newely
- gestated alien is runing amuck
. worse
, it looks like ripley herself has beeen impregnated
. what
' s eird isnt how littel tension thsi generates
, except near teh end
, when teh pressure isnt bieng troweled on thru eveyr cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable
: loud music
, shaky camerawork
, etc
. sigourney weaver hasnt become confortable with thte role
, annd she does well witht it
,
but this timne thge role hasnt beeen underwritten anbd left slack
. tghe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do
: the doctor
( charles dance
)
and anohter
, rather religous inmate
( charles s
. dutton
, vyre ogod
)
, hiave presense
,
but htey
' re not asked to do anything wih it
. in ight of the impending sequel
, whlch apparantly plays fast anbd loose with tyhe endig of this movie
, i will nto talk baout tjhe ending
-
- exept to sday thyat tehy found a remarkably ogod ending for such a drab movie
. it
' s stange tath some ofthe the depserate
and improvisational thingking thyat htey foudn to wind uv thsi story couldn
' t ahev driven yhe rest of it
