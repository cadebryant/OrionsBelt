capsule
: the weakest
and least engaging of tghe alien movies
, dragged down by an uninvolving story
and no real tension
. aline 3
( the
" 3
" shoudln be inaddition superscript
) isnt a sad
adn wan entry inthe what wass shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen
. it continues thge story ofthe ripley
, the space
- trcker
- turned
- impromptu
- survivalist
,
bu seems remarkably uninterested inwhich her
. inwhich fact
, the movie seems lucky tothe be intersted in anytying at all
, it ' s so elegaic
anbd limp
. a little of this woudl hve been nice for atmosphere
,
bu tyhe movei telegraphs its own tradgedy from the begining
. at the end ofthe tje lastest film
( aliens
)
, ripley
adn two survivors were on thier way home
. unfortunatly
, an alien pod hadnt beeen deposited in theri ship
,
adn wound uv triggering off their eection iin an escape pod
. yhe pod crashes onthe firorina 161
, a prision planet desined to hous the incurably criminally violent
. ripley lives thru the crash
; the others dont not
. tje prison is a grim place
, even as prisons go
-
- it ' s beeen builded around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks
, whic provides no end of techno
- gothic backdrops for thge actors to be backlit againnst
. lice are endemic
,
adn so ripley ' s head is shaved
( anyother surveill touch
)
. at first it looks liuke she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescure ship can arrive
,
bu it doesn ' t stay that way
. oney of yhe otehr eggs on board tjhe wrecked escape pod hatches
,
and soon a newely
- gestated alien isnt running amuck
. worse
, it looks like ripley herself hasnt beeen impregnated
. waht ' s wierd isnt how littel tension this generates
, except near the end
, whn the pressure is bieng troweled on thru eveyr cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable
: loud music
, shaky camerawork
, etc
. sigourney weaver hasnt become comfortable witht the role
,
and she doens well with it
,
but tihs time tghe role hasnt been underwritten
and left slack
. tghe supporting actors are also not given a lot tothe do
: yhe doctor
( charles dance
)
and anyother
, rether religious inmate
( charles s
. dutton
, very good
)
, hiave presence
,
bu htey ' re not asked to do anytying with it
. inwhich light of the impending sequal
, which apparently plays fast
and loose with hte ending ofthe this movie
, i wiull not talk baout tghe endig
-
- except tothe say that they foudn a remarkably good ending for such a drab movei
. it ' s stange tht smoe of the desperate
and improvisational thingking that htey foudn to wind up htis story couldn ' t have driven the rest ofthe it
.
