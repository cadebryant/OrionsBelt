i
' m giving thsi stinker
. normally
, thge worst tath i woudl ever rate a movie would be
. bu the total waste ofthe tiem thyat is blazing saddles isnt
, compounded by thge fatc taht tihs movei isnt incredibly offensive
, helped me come tothe teh big goose egg
. i
' m not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing
, or if he ws even thikning at all
. mabey in mel
' s littel mind a horse bieng knocked unconcious because ofthe a punch tothe thge face is funny
. inaddition mine
, it
' s nto
. or maybe mel graduated fomr the spike lee skool ofthe filmmaking
. beacuse onyl the self
- righteous lee uses the n
- owrd mroe oftenly in his films thna brooks did in this noe
. at least lee hasnt the smarts to relize that nobody isnt going to find thgat term amusing
. brooks b
andies it baout like he figures tyhe audience wiull be rolling inthe the aisles every tiem tehy hear it
. wrong mel
! i would call yuo a boob mel
, bu thast insults breasts everywhere
. thsi idiotic attempt at a comedy centers onthe tghe evil lewtenant gouvener
' s
( harvey korman
) attemts to claer outloud a town so he cant buy up tjhe l
and cheap
and sell it to yhe railroad
. he sends his goons tothe run tje townsfolk out
. bu teh twon appeals tothe thte governor
( mel brooks in noe of many uninspired
, anbd unfunny roles
) tothe send them a new sheriff to protect them
. the governer pawns thge task off to korman
' s charcter hedley lamarr
.
( i cxan tell you are rolling off your chairs right nowe jsut thingking of all thge humor in tath nmae
.
) lamarr decides to send tjhe town a black sheriff
( gasp
) inspite the hopes that the town iwll be so disgusted at the prospect ofthe a black man living amonst them that tehy wiull all just leave
. hold on
, i
' ve got tothe stpo while these gales ofthe laughter pass
. it
' s just too funny
. racism passing as humer
-
- gosh why didn
' t anybody ever think of thgat one befor
? oh wait
, i thiunk somebody might hvea
-
- they are called thte kkk
. i
' m nto calling brooks a racist
-
- bu i am calling him an insensative bastard who wouldn
' t nkow what ws funny if it hitted him over tjhe head
. bu i digress
. anyway
, the balck sheriff rides into twon amid a flurry of townsfolk useing the n
- word
. golly
, iwll tyhe hilarity jsut never end
? he ends up joining forces with a drunk
( ginee wilder
)
, who happens to be the fromer fastest gun in tghe west
. toghether
, they save the day fomr evil
. not one person in this movei gives a decent performance
. wilder looks liek he is recovering from a head injury forthe most of hte movei
, annd korman looks embarrassed tothe be a part of the movie
. ok
, he realyl didn
' t
-
- bu he shouldnt have
. the films star cleavon little goes along wih thte balck jokes as if tehy weere discussing the tiome ofthe day
. i doed not laugh once during htis hwole sory experience
. i admiting to starting to snicker on a couple ofthe ocasions
. actually
, the end started tothe look as if it wass going to hve smoe promise
, bu alas
, it ended uv being as crappy as the rest ofthe the movei
. i can say witht full confidence that blazing saddles has no reedeming qualities whatsoever
. mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy ofthe tihs film
.
