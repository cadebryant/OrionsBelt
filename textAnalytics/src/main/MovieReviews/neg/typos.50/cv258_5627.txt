hte army comedy genre hasnt never turned out a truely good movie
( if yuo don
' t count neil simon
' s biloxi blues
)
. yearm affter year
, more predictably cliched military movies come out
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
- anbd none ofthe them ever manaze to be anytying mroe than a rehash ofthe thte lsat
. i
thought stripes owudl be different
. wtih ivan reitman as director
, bill murray as star
and harold ramis as co
- star adn co
- screenwrighter
, it seemed like it would be ghostbusters inspite teh army
. instade
, it ws a bunch ofthe unfunny crap in the army
. murray
, about as funny
and suffisticated here as he ws in meatballs
, plays a losr cab driver who sees thte army as his onyl chance fo success
,
and convinces his freind ramis to enlist witht him
. so he doens
, anbd we get tje obligatory drill sergeant from hell
, head
- shaving adn marching
/ singing sequences
, omre mind
- numbingly stale here than ever
. the charachters are even less orginal
, ranging from underachieving slob john c
andy to incomptetent captian john larroquette
. all the big nmae stars in stripes
( adn even larroquette
) fall victim tothe thte lame
, rehashed material
and are never really likeable
, murray in particualr
. he only gets a faw decent lines in
,
al
though those bearly
- funny noe liners pale in compairison to the hilarious peter venkman charactor he palyed threee years later in ghostbusters
. he was even better inaddition caddyshack
, fo crying outloud loud
. as wtih a lot ofthe teh late 70
' s
/ early 80
' s comedies
, stripes isnt a completly juvenile movie onyl a child woudl like
but isnt so sex
- obsessed noone child should be able tothe watch it
. i
' m sure it seems funny onthe paper to haev c
andy pay over
$ 400 to mud wrestle five beatiful womens
, bu hwile watching it all that was comming out of my mouth wass tje admonition
" dear god
!
" every faw seconds
. stripes isn
' t thge playful kind of sex comedy
, either
. most of the time it seems downright misogynistic
, as wehn larroquette uses his telescope tothe peer into tyhe womens
' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto the stove
and
, withthe an i
- konw
- wqat
- you
- like look on his face
, says he
' s goign tothe give her teh
" aunt jemima treatment
,
" which means shoving a spatula under her
butt repeatedly
. you don
' t wnat tothe stick aroud as tyhe scene progresses annd he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region
.
" i
' m not enjoying htis
,
" yhe woman protests
. my sentiments exactlly
.
