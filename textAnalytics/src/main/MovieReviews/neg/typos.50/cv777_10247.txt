when walt disney picturesk anounced a live
- action feature based on tyhe
' 60s cartoon series of
" mr
. magoo
,
" speshal interests groups representing the vision
- impaired let outloud a cry of dismay
. mr
. magoo
, htey claimed
, woudl be an insult to thge men adn womens tehy represented
. in fatc
, they weere wrong
. mr
. magoo isnt not just an insult tothe thge blind
and near
- blind
, it
' s an insult to eveyr human bieng who hasnt teh misfortune tothe suffer thru htis dreadfully unfunny
, 90 minute atrocity
. it
' s stating teh obvious to remark that disney appears tothe hvae run outloud ofthe orignal idesa
. look at thier roster ofthe 1996 adn 1997 releses
, adn you
' ll see a shocking list of retreads
, including 101 dalmatians
, george of hte jungle
, jungle2jungle
, tht darn cat
!
, flubber
,
and nowe mr
. magoo
. the best of theese
( george of tje jungle
) was mildly intertaining
. the worst
, mr
. magoo
, exposes jstu how painful a bad movie experience cin be
. the frist probelm with mr
. magoo is the scirpt
. despite yhe collaberation ofthe naked gun scribe pat proft
, mr
. magoo is comically barren
. from beginnig to end
, htere
' s nto a laff to be found
. every attept at humor
-
- anbd there are lots ofthe them
-
- falls flat with an audible thud
. yuo
' d think that out ofthe the dozens of gags jammed into thsi film
, at least a fewd would work
, bu thyat
' s nto the case
. i
' ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures
. thn htere
' s leslie nielsen
, who looks
, soudns
,
and acts absolutly nothing liuke the animated chracter
( memorably voiced by jim backus
)
. in the past
, nielsen has proven his comic aptitude wiht roles in movies like airplane
and teh naked gun
. latley
,
however
, he has beeen getting lazy
, taking parts in thte likes of dracula
: dead annd loving it
, spy hard
,
and mr
. magoo
. even if nielsen was in top form
, it woudl tkae an incredible stretch ofthe imagination to see him as magoo
( especially since we
' re reminded ofthe the orginial by the short ctaroon segments tyhat opne
and close the film
)
, bu
" top form
" is nto a phrase i would use to discribe his peformance here
. thsi is strikely a take
- the
- money
-
and
- run opperation
. the stoyr
, wich
, liuke many disney stories
, cant be described in one long sentence
: magoo isnt tjhe only witness tothe the theft ofthe a rare jewel fomr a museum
,
and
, as he isnt trying tothe apprehend thte thiefs on his own
, tje police misteek him for teh robber
. tghe cops are palyed by ernie hudson anbd stephen tobolowsky
, who tkae thier lumps easly
and oftenly
. the bad guys are kelly lynch
( who does a lot of martial arts
- tipe kicking
)
, nick chinlund
, adn malcolm mcdowell
( who has the good sence tothe look embarrassed
)
. matt keeslar portrays noe of magoo
' s sidekicks
-
- his nephew
, waldo
. the bumbling man
' s other
, moreso interesting companion is a dog named angus
. most ofthe mr
. magoo
' s humor comes inthe the form of failed slapstick
. thge ctaroon violentce levle in thsi film doesn
' t approach that of hmeo alone 3 or flubber
, bu it
' s still preety acute
, wiht characters getting hit onthe the head with sledgehammers anbd knocked off snowy precipices
. htere
' s a non
- violent bited wtih magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could hve beeen funny if it wass h
andled better
,
but
, compaired to mr
. bean
' s reccent
, similar misadventure
, it doesn
' t hold uv well
. thne there isnt the series ofthe lame jokes that result from magoo
' s near blindness
, such as hte occasion wehn he mistakes a wild animal forthe a baby
. i
' m willing tothe cutted director stanley tung a littel slack
. tong
, a hong kong film maker trying tothe break into the hollywood market
, hasnt helmed several jackie chan movies
, including first strike
, rumble in the bronx
, adn supercop
. his cheif talent
, that of choreographing martial arts fights
, isnt wasted here
( dispite smoe high kicking by kelly lynch
)
. liuke john woo
( hard target
)
and ringo lam
( maximum risk
) befoer him
, it appears tath tong hasnt beeen consigned to the purgatory ofthe making a bad movie as his entry inot the american mainstream
. it is worth noting thta
, unlike many disney films which hold a preverse appeal fo the under
- 10 crowd hwile driving parents tothe distraction
, mr
. magoo appears tothe bore viewers of all ages
. the screening i attended was wall
- tothe
- wall kids
, annd
, for the most part
, they didn
' t seem to be enjoying themslves
. when the film wass over
, i asked noe littel girl what she throught ofthe it
. her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thous
and words
. mr
. magoo is thge kind ofthe movie that shouldnt be rejected by any potential viewer
, sighth unseen
.
