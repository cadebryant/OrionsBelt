starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based onthe the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight isnt a preety bad movei
,
though it took me a faw days to conclude this
. the film is more masturbatory tahn bleak
, witht its main charactor entent on confounding us witht his stupidity
.
( he has a
$ 6000 a week drug habit
.
) ultimatly
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as one ofthe those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at thge age of twelve
; ytou are less mystified by his self
- destructive nature than bored inot a stupor youself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young autor who arrives inthe l
. a
. whith ambition adn a nasty drug habit
. he eventually gets a gig for
$ 5000
/ week writing forthe a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled st
and
- infact forthe
" alf
"
: chompers looks just like alf except he
' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she cant get a gren card
,
and hoeks up wiht a spanish mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin with him iin the afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback
, with recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood restaurant
, where stiller works thte drive
- thru as part of rehab
)
, tkaing him back to a hotel
, anbd between bouts of sereous screwing
, listening to his life stoy
. i
' ve spent hte lastest week trying to figure outloud why stiller never seemed tothe fidn the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i
' ve been trying to figure outloud why hurley doed find stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none ofthe the charm or witn one would expect
( post
- there
' s something baout mary
) ofthe eather thge actor or a comedy writer
. wqat separates stahl fomr the hundreds ofthe otehr hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, isnt that stahl wroet a book baout his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin enxt tothe a baby
! watch stahl spoil numberous pitch meetings with smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawess performence
: yhe film could doublely as a documenatry on how to be a junkie
.
but permenant midnight is mostly soulless
. whn the movei poses the question wiull stahl be saved
? anbd hten answers it in the form of bello
' s charachter
( basically a shrink in black panties
)
, could a person care less
? iin the film verison of his autobiography ofthe the same nmae
, stahl doesn
' t need saving
, he needs someone who wiull sit htere annd listen to him go onthe baout hismelf
. if you learn anything about tje otehr characters inwhich thsi movie
, it
' s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood
- types known tothe man
.
( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties donig drugs
. is htis hollywood
.
.
. california
?
) i learned veyr littel baout the enteratinment busness fomr permenant midnight annd a whole lot baout an egotistical lunkhead
. ofthe course ytou nkwo that stahl triumphed beccause he lived to talk about his problems
. so
, basicaly
, his drug habit got him a book deel
, a movie based onthe his life
, annd now he
' s apparently collaborating withthe stiller onthe future projects
. so much for the moral of that story
. temperary midnight is more liek it
