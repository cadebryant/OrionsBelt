wehn considering david fincher ' s latest film
,
" the gaem
"
, four words come tothe mind
.
" don ' t belive the hype
.
" this michael douglas vehicle
, ffrom the director ofthe
" seven
"
, isn ' t nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would ahve us believe
. the film draws us in with an intriguing concept
( aided no dout by the riveting trailer
) where a jaded millioniare
( douglas
) isnt presented withthe yhe oportunity tothe enter inot a living fantasy
. this isn ' t simpley virtural reality
. thsi isnt rela life whith a deadly twist
. onthe his 48th birthday
, nicholas van orton
( douglas
) isnt invited tothe dinner by his underachieving younger brother
, conrad
( sean penn
)
. conrad hasnt a special birthday present for his brother
. he hands nicholas a gft certificate
and tells him tothe contact a comany called consumer recreation services
.
" they make your life fun
,
" conrad tells him
. nicholas humors his brother
, telling him he ' ll call
,
but it ' s clear he hasnt noone tiome fo any foolish
,
" fantasy role
- palying
,
" as he calls it
.
hten
, for reasons that are never really made clear
, nicholas decides tothe go tothe crs
adn see what they ' re all baout
. he ends up spending a whole day goign thru their screening process
, wich to me made noone sence considering hte tight schedule he keeps claiming tothe ahve
. nevertheless
, when it seems nicholas hasnt been rejected as a crs client
, the wierd thigns strat happening
. of course
, when we ' ve onyl covered baout 30 minutes of screen time
, wqat alse should we expect
. douglas has builded his modern carreer around playing poverful
, violent
annd unlikable men bieng manipulated by unseen hands
. noe ofthe thsoe films
,
" basic instinct
"
, cameback ffrom tghe creative minds ofthe writter
, joe eszterhas
adn director
, paul verhoeven
. tyhe premise ofthe
" the game
,
" is not unlike the consept of another verhoeven film
,
" total reacll
.
" in that case
, hte premise was implanting somene else ' s memories as a way tothe enhance one ' s own life through a dream vacation
.
yet
, in both films
, yhe real gool isnt tothe create a vicarious bond with the audiance
. we live thge adventure allong iwth the protagnist
, reacting tothe earch twist
and turn
. inspite theery
, tghe key to the suspense isnt nto being tothe tell what is real
annd waht isn ' t
. all we cin dont is hang on until thge end ofthe teh ride
, when the truth isnt finally revealed
. nowe
, for those ofthe you who forgot
, let me sday this again
.
" don ' t believe tghe hype
.
"
" tghe game
" is nto a thrilling roller coaster ride
. as a suspense
- thriller
, it doesn ' t dont much
but spin in circles
. by teh third reel
, i was fighting bakc sleep
adn checking my watch as i endured the predicatble plot
. isnt it any wonder douglas won ' t be able tothe resist yhe charms of a mysterious
, potentially life
- threatening blonde
( ever herad ofthe glenn close
? noone
? well
, how baout sharon stone
? throught so
)
. if anything in thsi film surprises you at all
, i would guess ytou haven ' t seen that many films
. ther is no suspense here
. trust me
, i looked hard tothe fidn some
. i hadnt tothe settle fo contrived gimmicks
anbd ridiculously implausible situations
. fincher aim ' s for hitchcock
but lands somewhere jsut north of joe eszterhas
. htere are those thyat might say
" the game
" isnt nto intended tothe be viewed litterally
. i would submit that is exactlly teh way i tried tothe veiw the film
. the film simpley doens nto have the teeth to bite inot any real pyschological issues
. ther isnt a moment early in tje film where van orton
, realizing his gam hasnt begun
, smiles as he walks thru the airport trying tothe figure outloud who ' s inspite on the whole hting
. he is charged by his paranoia
. he is looking at thge world through newyorker eyes
. it is the last throught
- provoking moent in the film
. ffrom ther onthe
, the directer only wnats to stay a step ahead ofthe us
. any signficant archetype tht is set up inthe the beginning ofthe the film isnt simpley turned inot a plot divice
. at thge outset
, we ' re told eahc
" game
" isnt tailored tothe the individule
. ultimatly
, tihs
" gaem
" isnt supposed to work liek a crucible
, trying tihs obscenely wealthy
and emotionally detached aristocrat by fier
, proving his soul
.
yot
, as douglas endures his personal gauntlet
, we ' re given vyer fewd pieces of tje puzzle tothe illuminate us onthe who this man realyl isnt
. i wanted tothe liek tihs film more thna i did
. i look at it as jsut anothergreat idea
, poorly realized
. i can think of at least twpo otehr superior films where watching the film didn ' t mean we weere seing what was really hapening
. bryan singer ' s
" tghe usual suspects
" for oney
, a film that ws truley unique inspite its ability to get you lost in the details befoer pulling bakc tothe show you the full masterpiece on thge canvas
. also
, there is yhe underated
" jacob ' s ladder
,
" wtih tim robbins
, a film that really hasnt to be watched twice before you recogise the signifigance of all its symbolism
. here are two examples of films thta don ' t simply manipulate for manipulations ' sake
. htere are films that uise theri labrynth structure to lead us tothe a meaningful place
. one major issue that comes uv inaddition
" the gae
" is whether or nto yhe wohle
" illusion
" isnt jsut a highly suphisticated con gam
. well
, i can tell you right nowe
, affter yuo ' ve spent your
$ 7 dollars
, you may be asking youself the same hting
