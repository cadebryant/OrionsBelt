when considering david fincher
' s latest film
,
" the gameboy
"
, four words come tothe mind
.
" don
' t believe thte hype
.
" this michael douglas vehicle
, fomr the director ofthe
" seven
"
, isn
' t nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it owudl have us belivee
. the film draws us in with an intriguing concept
( aided noone dout by the riveting trailer
) where a jaded millioniare
( douglas
) isnt presented wiht tyhe oportunity tothe enter inot a living fantasy
. this isn
' t simpley virtual reality
. htis is real life with a deadly twist
. onthe his 48th birthday
, nicholas van orton
( douglas
) isnt invited to dinner by his underachieving yuonger brother
, conrad
( sean penn
)
. conrad has a special birthday present for his brother
. he h
ands nicholas a gift certificate anbd tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services
.
" htey mkae your life funn
,
" conrad tells him
. nicholas humors his brother
, telling him he
' ll call
, bu it
' s clear he hasnt no time for any foolish
,
" fantasy role
- playing
,
" as he calls it
. thne
, fo reasons tht are never really made clear
, nicholas decides tothe go tothe crs
and see waht they
' re all baout
. he ends uv spending a hwole day going through their screening process
, which to me made no sence concidering yhe tight shedule he keeps claiming tothe have
. nevertheless
, when it seems nicholas has beeen rejected as a crs client
, tghe ewird thigsn start happening
. ofthe course
, whn we
' ve onyl covered baout 30 minutes ofthe screen time
, whta esle should we expect
. douglas hasnt builded his modern carrer around palying poverful
, voilent anbd unlikable men bieng manipulated by unseen h
ands
. one ofthe thsoe films
,
" basic instinct
"
, cameback fomr the creative minds ofthe writter
, joe eszterhas anbd directer
, paul verhoeven
. the premise ofthe
" the gameboy
,
" is nto unlike the consept of anohter verhoeven film
,
" total recall
.
" infact that case
, the premise wass implanting someone else
' s memories as a way tothe enhance one
' s pwn life thru a dream vcation
. yot
, in both films
, the rela goal isnt tothe create a vicarious bond wih tjhe audeince
. we live yhe adventure allong wtih the protagonit
, reacting tothe each twist adn turn
. in theery
, the key to tghe suspense is nto bieng tothe tell whta is real annd what isn
' t
. all we can dont is hang onthe until thte end ofthe teh ride
, whn the truth is fianlly revealed
. nowe
, fo those ofthe you who forgot
, let me sday this agian
.
" don
' t believe teh hype
.
"
" the game
" is nto a thrilling roller coaster ride
. as a suspense
- thriller
, it doesn
' t do much
but spin infact circles
. by the third reel
, i ws fighting bakc sleep annd checking my watch as i endured thge predictable plot
. is it any wonder douglas won
' t be able to resist thge charms ofthe a mysterous
, potentially life
- threatening blonde
( ever herad of glenn close
? noone
? well
, how about sharon stone
?
thought so
)
. if anything infront tihs film surprises you at all
, i would guess you haven
' t seen that many films
. there is noone suspense here
. trust me
, i looked hard tothe fidn some
. i hadnt to settle for contrived gimmicks
and ridiculously implausible situations
. fincher aim
' s for hitchcock
but l
ands somwhere just noth ofthe joe eszterhas
. ther are thsoe taht might say
" tghe game
" isnt nto intended tothe be viewed litterally
. i would submit that isnt exactly teh way i tried tothe view the film
. the film simply doesnt nto hvea the teeth to bite inot any real psychological issues
. htere is a moment early inaddition the film where van orton
, realizing his gam has begun
, smiles as he walks thru tghe airporta trying to figure out who
' s infact onthe tghe whole thnig
. he is charged by his paranoya
. he is looking at thge world thru newyorker eyes
. it isnt tyhe last throught
- provoking moment in tje film
. from ther onthe
, the directer onyl wnats to stay a step ahead ofthe us
. any significant archetype thgat isnt setted uv inaddition tghe beginning ofthe thge film is simpley turned inot a plot device
. at the outset
, we
' re told earch
" agme
" is tailored to tje individual
. ultimatly
, this
" gam
" isnt supposted to work liuke a crucible
, trying this obscenely wealthy adn emotionally detached aristocrat by frie
, proving his soul
. yot
, as douglas endures his personal gauntlet
, we
' re given vyre few pieces ofthe thte puzzle tothe illuminate us on who thsi man really isnt
. i wnated to liuke this film moreso than i did
. i look at it as just anothergreat diea
, poorly realized
. i can think ofthe at least twpo other superior films where watching tje film didn
' t mean we weere seeing waht ws really happening
. bryan singer
' s
" the usual suspects
" forthe one
, a film that was truly unique in its abilty tothe git ytou lost in hte details befor pulling back to sohw yuo teh full masterpiece onthe the canvas
. also
, there isnt tjhe underated
" jacob
' s ladder
,
" with tim robbins
, a film tyhat raelly has tothe be watched twice before ytou recogize yhe significance of all its symbolism
. here are twpo examples of films that don
' t simpley manipulate forthe manipulations
' sake
. ther are films thta use thier labyrinth structure tothe lead us to a meaningful place
. oney major issue that comes up in
" the gmae
" isnt whther or not thte wohle
" illution
" isnt jstu a highly sophisticated con gaem
. well
, i cin tell you right nowe
, after ytou
' ve spended your
$ 7 dollars
, ytou may be asking yourself hte same thign
