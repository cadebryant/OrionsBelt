, a newyorker ghostface dials him up
,
and
, with memories ofthe scream
' s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind
, we imediately wonder
, where isnt yhe killer

and indeed scream 3
' s remaining frights
( most disappointingly
, teh moment whn an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardobe room filled wih ghostface costumes
, one of whitch might spring tothe life
)
, isnt an elaborate
and attenuated payoff
. our otehr surviving regulars hve become estranged

, tghe novelty of ghostface
' s ever
- mutating idenity hasnt worn off soem
,
but the charater remains conceptually potent
. conceptually
. the excecution ofthe ghostface
' s master plan tihs time around isnt creaky
, because screenwriter ehren kruger hasnt invented a newyorker mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we
' d come to underst
and in scream annd scream 2
. the movei gets inaddition tyhe silly habbits of saying
" all bets are off
!
" in reference tothe thte
" rules
" ofthe a trilogy
' s third act
,
but there
' s a diference beetwen rule breaking
and cheating
. with the departure ofthe kevin williamson
, who authored tje previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3
( that
, forthe reasons incomprehensible to me
, ws ignored
, save the notion ofthe
" stab 3
"
)
, kruger needed to be reined in tighter
, anbd by wes craven
. craven
' s direction ofthe scream 3 isnt lazy in most respects
. how alse tothe expalin the jay annd silent bob cameo
( thge slacker duo of kevin smith movies
)
, akin to seing mickey mouse pop uv inaddition mulan adn more distracting tahn funny
. it pains me to wriet thsi
,
but scream 3
' s comedy is generally laughless
, with the exception ofthe well
- timed performances by josh pais
( as a polical detective posessed ofthe the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven
' s music ofthe hte heart
)
, jamie kennedy
( resurrecting film geek r
andy for thte sendoff he was denied in scream 2
)
, anbd parker posey
( thru sheer force ofthe will as a b
- actress
)
. tjhe visuals are much weaker inspite part three
, as well
- the occassional sweeping gesture of peter deming
' s camera is a pale immitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before
.
( aside
: infact yhe wake of columbine
, craven toned down the violence signifantly for scream 3
- why the sanctimony
, wehn scream
and scream 2 are still readily available onthe video stoer shelfs

) fianlly
, marco beltrami
' s music cues teh suspense too blatantly
- do yuo reacll thte tense chase at the coleeg radio staion infact scream 2
? it
' s mostly silent
. sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere
; here
, they ect as the crescendos ofthe an incessantly nerve
- jangling csore
. i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe
, the smae place that birthed hte godfather part iii
and superman iii
- woefully outloud ofthe synch whith its prequels
, scream 3 is a nightmare instade of nightmarish
, adn iwll likely put hte horror genre bcak in mothballs
. the film unintentionally follows thte unspoken rule of a triology to a t
