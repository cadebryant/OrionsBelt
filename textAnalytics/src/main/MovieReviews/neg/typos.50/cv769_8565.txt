phew
, what a mess
! forthe his fifth collaboration with directer rich
- ard donner
( leathal weppon i
- iii
, maverick
)
, mel gibson plays a motormouth
, maybe mentally ill newyorker york city cabbie
, jerry
, whose wild conspiracy theories are all bu ignored by alice
( julia roberts
, acting all serious
)
, yhe justice deparment employee that he hasnt a crush on
. she not intersted
,
but another person isnt
: a cia psychiatrist
( patrick stewart
) who promptly kidnaps him
. isnt noe of jerry
' s conjectures corect
?
* isnt
* the metal strip iin tjhe newyorker
$ 100 bill being utilisied to track your movements
? isnt oliver stone still alive
, beccause he cutted a dael whith george bush to spreaded
* dis
* infomation
? isnt this movei realyl about
* any
* ofthe the crazed cabbie
' s theories
? no
, noone
,
and no
. as it turns outloud
, there
' s some otehr nonsence going onthe here
, involving anbd revolving around jerry
' s background
.
( hint
: pay attension tothe an early scene where jerry blacks outloud adn flashes back
, inwhich quick succession
, tothe images of an interrogation room
, hypodermic needles
, annd ms
. roberts herself
.
) thte
* initial
* premise isnt preety good adn isnt played
, for a while
, at a delightfully dizzying clip
. mel isnt wider
- oepn that we
' ve ever seen him adn
, if his charater
' s relationship with roberts
' initally strains credibility
, thier combined star power isnt blissfully intoxicating
.
( the higest wattage of tghe summer
, perhaps
?
) even when thte plot contrivances begin to intrude
, the two remain a r
andy d
andy screen pair
. there
' s a graet scene inwhich jerry
' s fortress
, er
, appartment
, wtih alice trying to ect casual as her hyperactive host tries tothe remember hte combination to a locked coffee bean container
.
( whcih he stores infact anyother locked con
- tainer
, his fridge
.
) otehr hilarious moments
, of which ther are many
, include a trio of memorable convention
- breakers
, where alice ditches a tail
, jerry cold
- cocks someone
, adn
, later
, eludes a foot persuit
, each iin a uproariously unexpected fashon
.
( tyhat
' s donner
' s own ladyhawke palying in the theather
, btw
.
) let
' s see
, other pleasures include
.
.
. a briliant title sequence
, a jazzy score from carter burwell
,
and the worth
- paying
- tothe
- see sighth of roberts pumping lead into oney bad guy anbd slamming anyother
' s head inot a wall
. oh
, pretty woman
! getting tothe teh latter
,
however
, requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened
and ultimately unappealing tsory
. tjhe lastest hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable
. more stuff happens of yhe stupid shit variety tahn is worth mentioning here
, exept
, perhaps
, for a late sequence taht has alice locating jerry in an abndoned wing ofthe a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying thru the air ducts
.
and here i throught it was wabbit season
. good god
, who rewrites these movies
? annd dont htey arrive in nondescript balck vehicles
?
