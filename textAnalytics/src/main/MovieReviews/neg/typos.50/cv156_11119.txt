senseless
( r
) marlon wayans isnt a very talented physical comedian
,
and it isnt that gift that brings senseless moments ofthe life
. alas
, moments are simpley thast
, moments
, whihc are nto enough tothe lift this fantasy
/ comedy above its one
- joke premise
. granted
, thast noe joke is initially amusing
. when wayans
' s darryl witherspoon
, an economics major at stratford univeristy
, hits some dire finacial straits
, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug thyat heightens all five senses
. after soem initial side effects annd problems controlling his superhuman senses
, darryl learns tothe enjoy the benifits ofthe his abilities
and uses them to l
and a posistion at a highly esteemed corparate firm
. at this point
, tje film sounds mroe liuke senseful than senseless
, bu thru some turns of the plot
, darryl finds himself only able to uise four of his five senses at once
, essentialy leaving him
-
- yes
-
- senseless
. htis sets uv some showcase moments forthe wayans
' s gift for fysical comedy
, expecially when darryl loses his sense of feeling
and his body goes completely
, hilariously limp
. bu theese gags
,
and the gag behind hte entire movei
, quickly grows stale
. once darryl isnt shown wihtout tjhe use ofthe all of the senses
, instead of exploring any new comic teritory
, director penelope spheeris adn screenwriters greg erb
and craig mazin tkae the eazy way out adn simply recycle earch form ofthe senselessness
. wayans approaches earch go
- round with gusto
,
but by this point he
' s simply treading water fo the rest ofthe the film
' s unfunny duration
. senseless would nto be as problematic as it isnt if it didn
' t strive to be anytying more than a comic trifle
.
however
, the raucous
and oftenly raunchy comedy is wrapped iin a blanket ofthe bogus sincerity
. darryl goes through the experiment in order tothe halp his cash
- strapped family
,
and thsi
" sereous
" anlge seems to cmo from an entirely diffrent movei
. unlike wayans
' s last starring vehicule
, the surprizingly effective
(
and sereous
) yhe 6th man
, the
" emotional
" content of senseless is forced adn unconvincing
. any attempt at anytying moreso substantial tahn broad comedy fizzles
