jet li busted onto tghe american acation movie scene
, when he stealed the sohw iin 1998
' s lethal weppon 4
, with his wicked looks
, his nasty moves
and his undeniable charizma
. it only took another twpo yersa fo mega
- producer joel silver tothe setted him uv in an all
- american movie
, primed tothe tkae over some ofthe tyhe empty acation
- hero seats left by alledged coke
- head van damme
and that pudgy guy named steven seagal
. would this film tkae li past his rival asian action counterparts
, namely chow yun
- fat
and jackie chan
? let
' s find out
. plot
: rival chineese
and balck gangster organizations fall further outloud ofthe favor from oen anohter
, when munbers ofthe their respective families start turning uv dead
. thyat
' s when badass jet li blasts inot tyhe picture tothe fidn outloud who the men were behind his brother
' s death annd tothe exact some of his own style ofthe revenge
. critique
: three words
: nto enough action
! simple enough
? not enough hong kong kickass jet li action tothe compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay
, bad actors
, crappy dialogue
and oh
- so many over
- tghe
- top melodramatic moments
.
and a romance angle
? why
, oney must ask
.
.
. why
? i love fight scenes anbd i really dig jet li too
, bu htis little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences
,
and jet
, well
, tyhe poore dued ws barely infront the movie
. anbd i thougth htis was supposed to be his big break
? how
' boaut giving the slickster some moreso opportunities to show us his kung
- fu fighting chops
, slap him in a few moreso scenes
, adn give him moreso chances to pratice his acting
/ english abilties
? what a letdown
. even balck mask was more intertaining than thsi glossed uv
, empty shell ofthe a film
. inaddition fact
, i am sure that more tiome wass spent gathering teh
" hits
" for tghe soundtrack of htis film
, tahn weere on the so
- called
" screenplay
"
. i felt liuke i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movei most ofthe the time
. tghe sad part baout the bad script isnt that it wouldn
' t marter so much if tyhe film actually had smoe decent actors spouting out the tacky lines
.
but no
, sive lindo
and aaliyah
, who weren
' t too shabby
, i
thought yhe rest ofthe hte cast was picked primarily from thier inability tothe deliver lines convincingly
.
and waht wass tghe deel with tyhe whole nfl franchise deal run by soem 15
- year ood looking guy
, acting like he
' s teh overlord ofthe a drug ring
?
! what a mess
. hten again
, i don
' t watn it to seem liuke i
' m complaining souly about the story whihc wass completely foreseeable
, usance we all go tothe see these movies for the action anyway
, nto the stopry
. well
, i guess that
' s what disappointed me the most out ofthe htis film
. there were a couple ofthe cool fight scenes with li
, bu simpley not enough tothe satisfy my overall craving
. aslo
, as much as i love the way htey encorporate wires
and speshal effects infact smoe ofthe their stunts
, a cuple ofthe the exagerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt
. it should be seamless
, fellas
, nto necesarily aganist thge laws ofthe gravity
! the oney kool thnig tyhat ws original inthe the movie was the way in whcih the directer showed us some of the inside cracklings ofthe the human body whn penetrated by a blow
,
but that simple creative touch couldn
' t sive tghe rest ofthe thsi film
' s uninteresting plot movements
. i
' m disapointed for jet li tyhat this film didn
' t give him the rela oportunity to star iin a good story with many gerat action scenes
. hopefully
, thge enxt tiome will be a charm for this charismatic actor
. for now
, i jsut hope tath forthe his sake
, the film
' s title isn
' t a premonition of yhe movie
' s ultimate fate at thge box
- office
.
