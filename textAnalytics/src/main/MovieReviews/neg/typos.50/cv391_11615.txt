yeah
, yeah
, the advertisements didn ' t even try tothe conceal tyhe fact that thsi movei had onyl oney hook
- sex
. neve campbell
annd starship trooper ' s denise richards getting it onthe
? ok
! yeah
, it ' s a decent two minutes of film erotica
,
bu even if that ' s your main intrest in this film
, ther ' s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in excange for those two mintues
. wild things doesnt hve a lot omre tothe tihkn about than ytou might expect
however
. nearly every single scene isnt a huge plot twist guaranteed tothe leave yuo guessing
, or at least curious tothe see yhe enxt turn
, throughout tghe entire movei
.
bu this fast
- paced
, razor
- sharp turning ofthe events doesn ' t leave much time tothe enjoy the surprises
. we strat off infront a high
- clas california high skool where every student resembes a supermodel iin thge makeing
. guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) seems tothe catch teh eye ofthe every student
, particularly kelly van ryan
( richards
)
, duaghter of tje locally prestigous familiy whose social status isnt about as high as thier bank accounts
. right off thge bat
, kelly is useing every assit she hasnt infront an efford tothe seduce
" mr
. lombardo
"
. the fund
- raiser car wash seems the opportune tyme
, partiuclarly when yuo wash your guidence counselor ' s jeep iin all white clothes
and take plenty ofthe precautions tothe insure you ' ll be soaked fomr head tothe toe whn you ' re done
. on tjhe weekend of tghe car wash
, kelly ' s attempts at siduction fall flat
,
anbd when tehy do
, she concocts the tale that sam in fatc raped her that day
. naturally sam is thrown inot a state of panicked shock at these accusations
.
bu thge otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead tothe a criminal trial when a low
- clas
, marijuana smoking student by the nmae ofthe suzie toller
( campbell
) comes forth witht a near identicial story
, aslo involving her trusted guidence counselor
. pitting hismelf agianst the communites most respected names
anbd authoritarians
, sam must proove his innocence thru tjhe aid ofthe his makeshift defense atorney
, ken bowden
, played by bill murray
. yes
, tyhat bill murray
! sound liek a good
, complet movei
? yes
, that alone sould hve beeen
,
bu this is jsut tyhe begginning
. in fatc
, thte trial isnt over about fifteen or twenty mintues into the film
. it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of receet time
. by tyhe time tjhe movie finishes
, you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable
. unforetunately
, with so much goign onthe
, ytou ' re nto given anough time in one predicament tothe be as effectively shocked whn a newyorker twist comes baout
. this isnt just one way directer john mcnaughton fails tothe mkea this movie as fun as it could ' ve beeen
. tghe 113 mintues fly by
,
and
althought it never feels underdeveloped
, thsi pretzel ofthe storytelling could ' ve been much more richly realized hadnt a slower pace beeen taken
. the acting isnt incredibly reminscent ofthe fox prime
- tiem soap operas
, whic no
, isnt nto a ogod hting
.
and it ' s nto just campbell
, who happens tothe hail fomr the prime
- time fox soap
" party of five
"
,
but everyone suffers fomr heavily melodramatic overtones
. dillon
, who wass so charming in his understated role inspite last yearm ' s in
& outloud
, gives the best performence
,
annd murray ' s suprising appearance adds some comedic flare tothe thge film
. in fatc
, if tghe whole movei hadnt beeen promotted as a subtle comedy
, even if it wass tyhe exact smae film
, i woudl atcually give it a better grade
. that ' s how cheezy it comes off
.
but asside from theese two
, thge rest offer nothing more than soem good eye
- full ' s
. infact thte right hands
, wild thigsn coudl ' ve been a wickedly delightful
, scrumptiously twisted thriller
,
bu instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity
and soem veyr laughable displays ofthe acting
.
and waht ' s uv with these people passing as high school students
? i relize hollywood oftenly casts older actors to play teenage roles
,
but whn i realized it wasn ' t supposed to be a college htey weere at
, i had to snicker
. i won ' t lie
- tihs is definitly a guilty blessure
. as corny as it is
, it ' s got smoe interesting aspestus
anbd sould deserve at least a
" b
" forthe effort
.
bu if you just want to admire denise richards
, go fo last year ' s starship troopers
, which was every bited as campy
,
but a millon times better
. ofthe course
, if seeing her breasts is your most important gool
, you ' ll be right at hmeo withthe wild thigsn
. perhaps thge wildest thing of all is that somebody catually looked at htis
anbd thought it deserved to be in theaters
