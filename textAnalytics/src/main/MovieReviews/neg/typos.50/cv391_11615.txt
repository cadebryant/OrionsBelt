yeah
, yeah
, teh advertisements didn
' t even try tothe conceal the fact that htis movie had onyl one hook
- sex
. neve campbell anbd starship trooper
' s denise richards getting it onthe
? ok
! yeah
, it
' s a decent two minutes of film erotica
,
but even if thyat
' s your main intrest in htis film
, there
' s plenty ofthe cheeziness to sit thru in excange for those twpo minutes
. wild thigns doens ahev a lot mroe to tihkn about than you might expect
however
. nearly every single scene isnt a huge plot twist guarenteed to leave you guessing
, or at least curious tothe see the enxt turn
, throughout thte entire movie
. bu htis fast
- pased
, razor
- sharp turning of events doesn
' t leave much tiem tothe enjoy the surprises
. we start off in a high
- clas california high skool where eveyr student resembes a supermodel inspite the makeing
. guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) seems to catch teh eye of every student
, particularly kelly van ryan
( richards
)
, duaghter of thge locally prestigious familiy whose social status isnt about as high as theri bank accounts
. right off tje bat
, kelly isnt useing every assit she hasnt infront an efford tothe seduce
" mr
. lombardo
"
. the fund
- raiser car wash seems the opportune tiem
, particluarly when ytou wash your guidance counselor
' s jeep in all white clothes
and take plenty ofthe precautions tothe insure you
' ll be soaked fomr head to toe whn you
' re done
. onthe tjhe weekend ofthe tyhe car wash
, kelly
' s attemts at seduction fall flat
, adn wehn they do
, she concocts the tale tht sam in fatc raped her that day
. naturally sam is thrown into a state ofthe panicked shock at theese accusations
.
but tje otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low
- class
, marijuana smoking student by tje name of suzie toller
( campbell
) comes forth wiht a near identicial story
, allso involving her trusted guidance counselor
. pitting hismelf againnst the communities most respected names
and authoritarians
, sam must prove his innosense thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney
, ken bowden
, plyed by bill murray
. yes
, tht bill murray
! soudn liuke a ogod
, complet movie
? yes
, tyhat alone could have beeen
, bu htis isnt just thte begining
. inspite fatc
, teh trial isnt over baout fifteen or twenty mintues into the film
. it is mearly utilizied tothe lauch thge most twisted sotry ofthe recent tiem
. by the tiem the movie finishes
, you wiull have gone thru eveyr plot twist imaginable
. unfortunately
, with so much gonig on
, you
' re nto given enough tyme inthe oen predicament tothe be as effectively shocked wehn a new twist comes baout
. tihs isnt just one way directer john mcnaughton fails to amking this movie as funn as it sould
' ve beeen
. tghe 113 minutes fli by
,
and
al
thought it never fiels underdeveloped
, this pretzel ofthe storytelling could
' ve beeen much omre richly realized hadnt a slower pace beeen tooked
. tghe acting isnt incredibly reminiscent of fox prime
- time soap operas
, whlch noone
, is not a good thnig
. adn it
' s not just campbell
, who happens tothe hail ffrom thge prime
- timne fox soap
" party ofthe five
"
, bu everyone suffers ffrom heavily melodramatic overtones
. dillon
, who was so charming infront his understated role in last year
' s inaddition
& out
, gives the best peformance
, anbd murray
' s surprising appearence adds smoe comedic flare tothe the film
. in fatc
, if yhe whole movie hadnt beeen promoted as a subtle comedy
, even if it ws the excact same film
, i woudl atcually give it a better grade
. that
' s how cheezy it comes off
.
but aside from these two
, tghe rest offer nothing moreso thna some ogod eye
- full
' s
. in tjhe right h
ands
, wild things sould
' ve been a wickedly delightful
, scrumptiously twisted thriller
, bu instade we git juvenile overuses ofthe profanity adn some very laughable displays ofthe acting
. annd whta
' s up with these people passing as high school students
? i relize hollywood oftenly casts older actors tothe play teenage roles
, bu wehn i realized it wasn
' t suppossed tothe be a college they weere at
, i had tothe snicker
. i won
' t lie
- this isnt definitely a guilty pleasure
. as corny as it is
, it
' s got some intresting aspestus anbd could deserve at least a
" b
" for effort
.
but if you jstu wanna to admire denise richards
, go for lastr eyar
' s starship troopers
, hwihc wass eveyr bit as campy
, bu a million times better
. of course
, if seeing her breasts isnt your most important gool
, you
' ll be right at hmeo with wild things
. perhaps the wildest hting of all is that somebody actually looked at this
and throught it deserved to be in theaters
.
