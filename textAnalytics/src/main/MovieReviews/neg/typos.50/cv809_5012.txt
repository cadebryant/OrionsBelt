dieu hard 2 isnt an alltogether unfortunate fiasco
, inferior tothe tjhe original inwhich every respect
. place tje blame squarely on the shoulders ofthe steven de souza adn doug richardson
, who wroet the film
' s pathetic screenplay
. eveyr line ofthe dialogue reeks ofthe eather smarmy sap or forced humor
. thte plot is altogether implausible
; hte convoluted story line involves a b
and ofthe terrorists who tkae over dulles airport
and shut down hte controll tower
, leaving a dozen planes str
anded infront tyhe air waiting tothe l
and
. the film has zero credibility
, anbd all of yhe characters come off as cliched
, cardboard cut
- outs
. so much for teh scirpt
. how about thge action
? well
, let
' s put it thsi way
: director renny harlin could leran a few thnigs from john mctiernan
, who directed tje original
, as well as the hunt for red octobur
and predator
-
- all st
andouts fo thier hair
- raising suspense
. by contrast
, harlin doesn
' t have a clue wehn it comes tothe choreographing acation
,
and consequently
, dieu hard 2 never picks up steam
. dieu harder is impossible tothe tkae seriously even forthe a minute
. in fact
, the movie often seems deliberatly campy
,
and it alomst reaches tjhe threshold ofthe bieng so bad it
' s good
. yuo dont laff
, bu yuo laugh at tghe film
, not with it
. die hard 2 should hvae never beeen cleared for takeoff
