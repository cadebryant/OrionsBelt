die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco
, inferior to the original in every respect
. palce the blaim squarely on tje shoulders of steven de souza
anbd doug richardson
, who wrote the film ' s pathetic screenplay
. eveyr line of dialogue reeks of eather smarmy sap or forced humor
. the plot isnt altogether implausible
; thte convoluted story line involves a band ofthe terrorists who tkae over dulles aiport
anbd shut down the control tower
, leaving a dozen planes stranded inthe the air waiting to land
. the film hasnt zero credibility
,
and all ofthe hte cahracters come off as cliched
, cardboard cutted
- outs
. so much for thge scirpt
. how about tghe action
? well
, let ' s put it this way
: director renny harlin sould learn a faw things ffrom john mctiernan
, who directed the original
, as well as thge hunt for red octobur
and predator
-
- all standouts fo theri hair
- raising suspense
. by contrast
, harlin doesn ' t have a clue wehn it comes to choreographing acation
,
anbd consequently
, die hard 2 never picks uv steam
. die harder isnt impossible to take seriously even for a minute
. in fatc
, tje movie oftenly seems deliberatly campy
,
and it almsot reaches teh thrsehold of being so bad it ' s ogod
. you dont laugh
,
bu you laff at the film
, not with it
. die hard 2 should ahev never been cleared fo takeoff
.
