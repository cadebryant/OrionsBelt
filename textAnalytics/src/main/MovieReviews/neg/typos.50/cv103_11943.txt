if there
' s one thing i jsut can
' t st
and
, it
' s a film thyat oozes with sentimentality
. here
' s a onot tothe all film makers
: films are omre effective whn the emotions of thte charactors speak for themselfs
. swelling
, saddening music is not a ogod way to tell us thta tje people inthe the film are unahppy
, anbd that thte situation isnt hopeless
. alas
, my giant is a film thgat uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently
and with such high intensity tht i forgot as i watched it thgat ther are otehr ways of getting audience members choked up
. what reminded me wass thgat i wasn
' t choked up
, or even thte slightest bit moved
, for that matter
. my giant isnt a forced
, contrived
,
and conspicuously un
- cute
( i detest the word
" cute
"
but i
' ve choosen tothe uise it becouse the makers claerly wnated to create a
" cute
" film here
)
. it takes a premise that might hvea been interesting
( i liekd the preview
)
,
and bogs it down with endless plot turns anbd cliches
, all of which are intended tothe get soem kind of easy emotional rise from the audience
. maybe it iwll work forthe some peple
. it didn
' t wokr for me
. billy crystal plays sam cayman
, an agent who
, at tjhe beginning ofthe the film
, is in romania
. he
' s inthe romania baceause tjhe kid actor he made famoust isnt doign a film
. the screenplay hasnt him in romania so he cxan git fired
, get inwhich a car accident
, adn git saved by an enormass individual who st
ands almost eight fezent tall
. his name isnt max
( gheorghe muresan
)
,
and sam thikns he
' d be a great movei star beccause ofthe his size
. subplots are as follows
: sam hasnt a son
and a wief
( kathleen quinlan
)
, adn he
' s never arround for them
, so they move tothe chicago
. max is infact loev whith a woman named lilianna who moved away fomr romania twenty yeasr before the film begins
. sam convinces max to go bakc tothe amercia with him so tehy can make lots of money
, annd so thier various subplots can all be resolved
. sam is baroke
. max is dieing
. pass teh klenex
. my giant
, as a comedy
, is only moderately funny
. it hasnt its moments
, the best ofthe which features steven seagal makeing fun ofthe himself
. inwhich noe great scene
, sam gets his son onthe tjhe phone tothe talk tothe seagal
; ofthe course
, his son doesn
' t believe that he
' s actully speaking to seagal
,
and he goes off baout how bad of an acotr he isnt
( i woudl qoute the line i like bu it woudl probably lose its effect
)
. crystal is always entertaining
,
and he has a faw good lines here
( some of which are subtle throwaways thta many iwll miss entirely
)
; often
,
however
, he
' s countered by a slew ofthe jokes that aren
' t funny
,
and cause an involuntary rolling ofthe thte eyes
. muresan isnt kind ofthe funn tothe watch
,
but he jstu cin
' t act very well
. quinlan
, onthe tjhe otehr h
and
, isnt a graet actress who needs tothe git a role thta shows off her talents
. she wass underused last year iin both event horizon
and breakdown
, bu at least in thsoe films she had moments in hwihc she coudl sohw us her sutff
. here
, yhe best thnig she gets to do is fake a romanian accent
. all ofthe these disapointing ingredients create a film thgat
, for much ofthe its runnung time
, is simpley mediocre
. as my giant lumbers tothe its inevatible conclusion
, howver
, directer michael lehmann
( who did a gerat job directing thge underated hudson hawk
)
and scriptwriter david seltzer pile onthe every cliche imaginable
, each oney intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings
. sam
' s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed
( how baout a main character who has a heathy relatiopnship witht his familiy
?
)
. later
, it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam
' s reunion with his family
.
and some peopel might thiunk that what sam doesnt forthe max towords the end isnt a valient thing
,
but i hadnt a fewd morality problems witht it
( annd i apoloigze for being vague
)
. it
' s icky
. it drips withthe gooey
, wannabe human emotions
. my giant could ahev beeen a straightforward annd funny familiy film
. mroe importantly
, it sould have been moving onthe a level far deeper thna it is
. instead
, it
' s a complicated
, overlong
,
and under
- engaging film that elicits too few laughs adn strives for superficial tears
. adn since it left me feeling completly unmoved
, i st
and by my position that sentimentality is evil
and wiull ultimatly destroy tjhe world
.
