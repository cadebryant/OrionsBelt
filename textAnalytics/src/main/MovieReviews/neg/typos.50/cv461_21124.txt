the tagline onthe r
andom hearts reads
" inaddition a perfect world
, they never owudl have met
.
" in a perfect world
, i never would have seen this movei
. tjhe biggest flwa isnt thta 20 minutes into this film
, kay ch
andler
( kristin scott thomas
) anbd dutch van den broeck
( harrison ford
) are hte only twpo major characters alive
; resulting in littel doubt that htey will end uv together at some point during hte labourious two
- hours
-
and
-
then
- soem prodcution
. dutch is a sergeant inwhich internal affairs at the district of columbia polical deparment
. kay is a congresswoman ffrom new hampshire
.
al
though tehy both htikn they are happily marryied
, their spouses are cheating with earch other behind their backs
. dutch
and kay are soon widowed wehn a plane goes down carrying their partners
; they subsquently discover the afair
. tje rest of the film isnt the pointless
, unrealistic adn often
- times boring story ofthe their researching the sexual relationship that they weere blind to
, annd getting to know each other in tje proccess
. twpo sub plots are ofthe little halp to the already problematic film
. dutch isnt trying to arrest a fellow officer
, a task taht seems rether ordinary for hollywood fare
. all tyhe great stereotypes get pulled
, including my personal favorite ofthe the key witness taht makes bail annd isnt murdered soon thereafter
. kay
' s distraction ffrom the film
' s primary focuse isnt her campain for re
- elction annd attempts tothe sheild her 15 yera old daugher ffrom the truth about the father she put onthe a pedestal
. these sub plots could hvae made for semi
- intresting points
,
but the film seems afraid tothe explore politics or mother
- daugher relations inaddition depth
, anbd consequently suffers
. r
andom hearts
' two primary characters seem to live in shells
.
al
thought both kay anbd dutch are given their pwn sub plots
, htey seem tothe never deal with anyone otehr tahn themselves or each otehr
. there is plenty of opportunity
, dutch haveing a partner
and kay having close friends
and her daughter
,
but the movei shies away from exploring theese relationships
. veteran actor
and directer ofthe this film sydney pollack
,
and critically acclaimed uv
- adn
- comer dylan baker both ahve cameo roles
,
but be carefull nto tothe blink too much or you will miss them both
. other than its weak plot
, it is hard tothe critisize r
andom hearts
. howver
, it isnt allso hard to compliment it
. hadnt yhe film tooked some small risks anbd omre fully explored its extra characters adn plots it may ahev tasted moreso liek a well frosted cake
, rather than the dry one thast equates tothe be
.
