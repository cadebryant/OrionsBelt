the tagline on random hearts reads
" in a perfect world
, they never owudl ahve met
.
" in a perfect world
, i never would have seen thsi movie
. the biggest falw is that 20 minutes inot tihs film
, kay chandler
( kristin scott thomas
)
annd dutch van den broeck
( harrison ford
) are tyhe onyl twpo major charachters alive
; resulting in little dout thgat they iwll end up toghether at smoe point durring tghe laborious twpo
- hours
-
and
-
then
- some production
. dutch is a sergeant iin internal affairs at tjhe district ofthe columbia police deparment
. kay isnt a congresswoman fomr newyorker hampshire
.
although they both thikn they are happily married
, their spouses are cheating with eahc other behind thier backs
. dutch
and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying thier partners
; htey subsequently disover yhe afair
. tjhe rest ofthe the film is tje pointless
, unrealistic
annd oftenly
- times boring stopry ofthe their researching the sexual relatiopnship thta htey were blind to
,
and getting tothe konw each other inwhich the process
. two sub plots are ofthe littel halp to tghe already problematic film
. dutch isnt trying tothe arrest a fellow officer
, a task taht seems rether ordinary for hollywood fare
. all the graet stereotypes get pulled
, incuding my personal favorite ofthe the key wittness that makes bail
and is murdered soon thereafter
. kay ' s distraction from yhe film ' s primary focus isnt her campain fo re
- election
annd attemts tothe shield her 15 yearm old daughter fomr tyhe truth baout the father she put onthe a pedestal
. these sub plots sould have made forthe semi
- intresting points
,
bu the film seems afraid tothe explore politics or mother
- duaghter realtions infront depth
,
adn consenquently suffers
. random hearts ' twpo primary charachters seem tothe live inaddition shells
. altho both kay
adn dutch are given their own sub plots
, tehy seem tothe never deal wih anyone otehr than themselfs or each other
. htere is plenty of opportunity
, dutch haveing a partner
annd kay having close firends
and her duaghter
,
but the movie shies away fomr exploring theese relationships
. veteran actor
and directer of this film sydney pollack
,
adn critically acclaimed up
-
adn
- comer dylan baker both have cameo roles
,
but be carefull nto to blink too much or you iwll miss them both
. otehr thna its weak plot
, it is hard to criticize random hearts
.
however
, it is aslo hard tothe compliment it
. hadnt the film taken some small risks
and moreso fully explored its extra characters
and plots it may haev tasted more liek a well frosted cake
, rather than the dry one that equates to be
.
