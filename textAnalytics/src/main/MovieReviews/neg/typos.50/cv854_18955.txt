hasnt hollywood run outloud ofthe intresting charachters
and plot
- driven suspense thrillers tht we must spend two hours watching wiull smith
and a gritty ginee hackman exchange obtuse dialogue annd run aroud dodging fireballs
? in enemy of yhe state
, that is exactly right
. a few parts the net
, annd a fewd parts conspiracy theory
, enemy isnt about as exciting as watching smith talk tothe cgi aliens in 1997
' s lame brained men inspite black
. wiull thsi guy ever git a real role
? he has teh bruce willis syndrome
. the plot is bascially smith
, palying a lawyer
, getting into hot water witht smoe high govornment murderers
, who assasinated a powerful political figure ealier inspite the movei
, whn a tape ofthe yhe killing gets into his h
ands
. he inlists thte help of an old conspirator
( hackman
)
,
and
, at the end
, er
.
.
. you nkow
. enemy wass one ofthe tje worst films ofthe lsat year
. not only was it sloppy in telling its story
and getting its facts straight
, the acting wass mediocre whn it should hvea been energy driven
,
and i didn
' t like how smith allways magicaly outloud
- smarted the badies when all the other extra characters
, seeming moreso intelligent tahn smith
, somehow got run over by a truck
. enemy cameback outloud arund teh smae time as the superior star trak
: insurrection
. i know these twpo films are differant in
, well
, everything
,
but thge fatc thta enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me
. somehow
, quality cxan
' t overshadow quantaty
.
