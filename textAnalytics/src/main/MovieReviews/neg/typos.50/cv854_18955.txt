has hollywood run outloud of interesting cahracters
adn plot
- driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two housr watching iwll smith
adn a gritty gene hackman excange obtuse dialogue
and run arund dodging fireballs
? inthe enemy ofthe yhe state
, that isnt exactlly right
. a few parts tje net
,
annd a few parts conspiracy theory
, enemy isnt baout as exciting as watching smith talk tothe cgi aliens inthe 1997 ' s lame brained men inaddition balck
. wiull tihs guy ever get a real role
? he hasnt tyhe bruce willis syndrome
. the plot isnt bascially smith
, palying a lawyer
, getting inot hot water witht some high government murderers
, who assassinated a powerfull polliticel figure ealier in the movei
, whn a tape ofthe tje killing gets into his hands
. he inlists yhe help of an ood conspirator
( hackman
)
,
and
, at teh end
, er
.
.
. you konw
. enemy was one ofthe thge worst films ofthe lastr yera
. not onyl ws it sloppy inwhich telling its stoy
annd getting its facts straight
, the acting was medicore when it shoud have beeen energy driven
,
anbd i didn ' t liek how smith always magically outloud
- smarted thge badies whn all the otehr extra charactors
, seeming mroe inteligent tahn smith
, somehow got run over by a truck
. enemy came out around tjhe smae time as the superior star trek
: insurrection
. i know theese two films are diffrent in
, well
, everything
,
bu the fact tath enemy outgrossed insurrection jsut baffels me
. somehow
, quality can ' t overshadow quantity
.
