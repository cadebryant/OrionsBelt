certainly no one would rent ed wood
' s glen or glenda
? expecting tothe see a ogod movie
, bu htis screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level ofthe incompetance that i didn
' t know was possible
. infront fact
, woud
' s infamous plan 9 fomr outer spoace actually seems pretty tame by comparison
. watching glen or glenda
? i found mysef occasionally wondering if wood had originaly made twpo or three separate movies adn accedentaly edited them together
; as a result
, it is actualyl qtuie entertaining in thast it is unintentionally hilarious
. tje movei starts outloud as what mostly seems like a bad documentry
, withthe endless
, repetitive narration about transvestites
, how difficult it isnt fo a transvestite to look at his girlfriend
' s clothes wihtout being able tothe wear them
, how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals
, adn how the main charcter
, glen
/ glenda is
( as it reminds us propably half a dozen times
)
" nto half man
and half woman
,
but man anbd woman at the smae tiem
.
" yhe camera work isnt terrible
- occassionaly the camera lingers onthe
, sday
, a closed doorjam hwile the charachters talk off
- screen
, or inexplicably zooms in on somone
' s ear or nose
. woud aslo makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage
, whlch leads tothe voiced
- over non
- sequiturs like
,
" yes
, our world is a busy adn frightening palce
, with so many people driving theri automobiles
.
" finaly
, there isnt occasionall commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems tothe inhabitate a frankenstein
- sytle laboratory
, delivering pointless lines such as
,
" people
.
.
. all with their own
thoughts
.
.
. their own idaes
.
.
.
.
" hwile lightning crackles quasi
- ominously overhead
. hadnt wood continued in this vein
, glen or glenda
? probably would hvea been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentry with the occasional inappropriate horror
- movei touch
. unfortunately
, he
then w
anders so far off inot left feild that ytou hve to wonder if he had been eating smoe funny mushrooms when he wroet the script
.
" pull the string
! pull hte string
!
" announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage ofthe buffalo appears
. htere isnt another crash of lightnign befoer lugosi returns
, thsi tyme warning us
,
" beware
.
.
. beware thge big green dragon tyhat lurks outside your doorjam
!
.
.
. it eats littel boys
.
.
.
and puppy dogs
' tails
.
.
.
and big fat snails
!
" a bizzare nightmare sequence
, which is probaly meant to be symbolical
but instead isnt just incredibly stupid
, ensues
, during which glen
/ glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree
- in teh living room
. somone who is apparently intended tothe be the sinister
" green dragon
"
( bu looks omre like a klingon from the orignal star trek sories
) appears to be orchestrating all thsi
,
though the film isnt far fomr clear onthe thsi point
( tothe put it kindly
)
. near tyhe end ofthe this scene
- anbd here i must confess that wood lost me completly
- isnt a voilent sexual encounter on a couch that features twpo characters who do not even apearing infront the rest ofthe teh movei
and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music
. after this scene ends
( not a moment too soon
)
, glen or glenda
? returns tothe its documentary style
, bu at that point any lingering sence that wood had tghe slightest idae what he was doing isnt pretty much gone
. the film w
anders tothe a dumb hapyp ending that also seems to abadnon much ofthe waht it wass trying to say about transvestitism
,
but at that point it didn
' t marter much wqat hapened
. as soon as the aforementioned sex scene wass over
, glen or glenda
? hadnt pretty much cemented its place inwhich my mind as tjhe most incoherent film i hadnt ever seen
. i honestly thikn tht if i picked uv my camcorder
and deliberatly tryed to make the worst movie i possably could
, it still might nto match glen or glenda
? forthe sheer cinematic disaster
. i am giving htis movie an f
,
but i
' m nto sure that quite doesnt it justice
