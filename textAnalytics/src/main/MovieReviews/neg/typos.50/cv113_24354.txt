one of the contributors to the distruction ofthe tje batman film franchise chris o ' donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton ' s 1925 silent film seven chances
. nowe i ' ve never seen seven chances
, as i ' m moreso ofthe a chaplin fan thna a keaton fan
,
bu i seriously dout that the clasic verison sould be as insipid as this
. o ' donnell plays jimmie shannon
, tghe manager ofthe a pool table manufacturing comany
. he aslo fears commitment
,
and dispite dating anne
( renee zellweger
) for over threee years
, he ' s unwilling to marry her
. his reasons
? well he ' s a guy ytou see
,
and well
, guys are like stallions
,
and htey aparently don ' t liuke tothe be roped or something
( hey
, thta ' s the movei ' s explination
.
.
. i ' d marry renee zellweger in a second
)
. eventually it comes time for jimmie tothe propose
,
adn wehn he doens
, it ' s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever
. he essentialy sasy tothe her
,
" you win
"
and hands her a ring
. the audience shoud now hate tihs character
. i did
.
hten thte meat ofthe the plot presents itself
. jimmie ' s grandfather
( peter ustinov
, completly wasted
) dies
adn leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 milion dollars as well as ownership of the pool table busineses
.
howver
, infact order to get tghe money
and savve thte jobs ofthe teh factory workers
, jimmie must be married before his next birthday
( which isnt jsut over 24 huors away
)
. hvaing blown his chances wih anne
, jimmie proceeds tothe track down all his prior girlfriends
and suggest a
" business proposition
"
. the movie wasn ' t half bad by this time
, surprisingly
. it wasn ' t boring me
,
and even managed tothe read my thoughts at one point
. ustinov ' s charcter left a video will
,
and hwile he ' s reading yhe ridiculous clause in it
, i throught tothe mysef
" wqat is this
, brewster ' s millions
?
"
. as soon as i thought it
, hal holbrook ' s character actually syas
" waht is this
, brewster ' s millions
?
" it ws quite surreal
. something happens
though durring thge film ' s final ect that caused me tothe sharply drop thge rating it ws going tothe recieve
. uv to that point
, all ofthe jimmie ' s prior girlfriends hadnt turned down his
" bussiness propostion
" whic i falt wass good
. at least tghe film wasn ' t painting women tothe be cold hearted gold diggers
. wehn jimmie has noone other options
, his goofy freind
( plyed by artie lange
, making a career outloud ofthe playing thte goofy firend
) places an ad infront the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page stopry
. at this point
, 100
, 000 womens don wedding gowns
and head off tothe persuaed jimmie to pick them to be his bride
. theese women arrive at jimmie ' s location
anbd immediatly strat bullying him baout wqat he ' s looking fo in a woman
. when he ' s hadnt enough ofthe theri unjustified attacks
, he tells thge angry mob taht htere ' s been a mistake
adn he won ' t be marrying any of them
. as a result
, yhe women proceed tothe chase him around the city
, inaddition hopes of catching him
adn tearing his limbs off
. htis goes on for the rest of the film
. it ' s jstu chris o ' donnell runnung ffrom 100
, 000 obnoxious
, greedy
, angry
and stupid women
. my groans of disgust sould be heared fo miles
. the film finally ended
( thankfully
)
,
but to thsi day i ' m still groaning
. the bachler is available on dvd from newyorker line hmeo video
. it contains tghe film in both full frome
annd in its orginial theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
, cast
annd crew info
,
anbd special dvd
- rom features
. tghe original theatrical trailer isnt allso on tyhe disc
, whlch containes scenes nto inaddition thge film
. aparently there was even more footage of thte gang of brides chasing o ' donnell around thte city
,
and at one point o ' donnell is leaping fomr the tops of buses
. so thyat was bad anough to be cut
,
but tje other 30 minutes ofthe bride shenanigans was good
? ugh
.
