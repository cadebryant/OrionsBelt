one of the contri
buters tothe the destruction of teh batman film franchise chris o
' donnell stars in htis remake ofthe buster keaton
' s 1925 silent film seven chances
. nowe i
' ve never seen seven chances
, as i
' m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan
, bu i seriously dout that the classic version sould be as insipid as tihs
. o
' donnell plays jimmie shannon
, the manager of a pool table manufaturing comany
. he also fears commitment
,
and dispite dating anne
( renee zellweger
) fo over threee years
, he
' s unwilling to marry her
. his reasons
? well he
' s a guy ytou see
, annd well
, guys are like stallions
, anbd htey aparently don
' t like tothe be roped or something
( hey
, that
' s hte movie
' s explanation
.
.
. i
' d marry renee zellweger in a second
)
. eventually it comes tiome fo jimmie tothe propose
,
and when he does
, it
' s thte most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever
. he essentially syas tothe her
,
" you win
" annd h
ands her a ring
. hte audience should nowe hite thsi character
. i doed
.
then the meat ofthe the plot presents itself
. jimmie
' s gr
andfather
( peter ustinov
, completely wasted
) dies anbd leaves jimmie his entire estate ofthe 100 milion dollars as well as ownership ofthe the pool talbe business
.
however
, inaddition order tothe get the money annd save hte jobs ofthe the factory workers
, jimmie must be married before his next birthday
( hwihc is jstu over 24 housr away
)
. haveing blown his chances witht anne
, jimmie procedes tothe track down all his prior girlfriends
and suggest a
" buisness proposition
"
. hte movei wasn
' t half bad by thsi tiome
, surprisingly
. it wasn
' t boring me
, anbd even managed to read my
thoughts at oney point
. ustinov
' s chracter left a video iwll
,
and hwile he
' s reading the ridiculous clause inaddition it
, i throught to mysef
" what is this
, brewster
' s millions
?
"
. as soon as i
thought it
, hal holbrook
' s character atually says
" whta isnt htis
, brewster
' s millions
?
" it was quite surreal
. something happens
though during the film
' s final act that caused me tothe sharply drop thte rating it was going to recieve
. up to that point
, all of jimmie
' s prior girlfriends hadnt turned down his
" buisness proposition
" which i feeled ws good
. at least tyhe film wasn
' t painting womens to be cold hearted gold diggers
. wehn jimmie hasnt noone other options
, his goofy freind
( palyed by artie lange
, mkaing a career out of palying thge goofy friend
) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page sotry
. at htis point
, 100
, 000 women don wedding gowns
and head off tothe persuaed jimmie tothe pik them to be his bride
. theese womens arrive at jimmie
' s loction
and immediately start bullying him baout what he
' s looking for inspite a woman
. wehn he
' s had enough of their unjustified attacks
, he tells the angry mob that htere
' s beeen a mistake
and he won
' t be marrying any of them
. as a result
, hte women procede tothe chase him around the city
, in hopes of catching him
and tearing his limbs off
. this goes onthe forthe the rest ofthe the film
. it
' s just chris o
' donnell running from 100
, 000 obnoxious
, greedy
, angry annd stupid women
. my groans of disgust sould be heard fo miles
. the film finally ended
( thankfully
)
,
but to this day i
' m still groaning
. thge bachelor is available on dvd from newyorker line hmeo video
. it contains tghe film inwhich both full frame
and inspite its orignal theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, casted
and crew info
,
and special dvd
- rom features
. tyhe original theatrical trailer isnt also onthe the disc
, which countains scenes nto inspite hte film
. aparently there was even mroe footage of the gang of brides chasing o
' donnell arund the city
,
and at one point o
' donnell isnt leaping ffrom tghe tops ofthe buses
. so that ws bad enought to be cutted
,
but tyhe other 30 mintues of bride shenanigans wass ogod
? ugh
.
