sydney lumet isnt hte directer whose work happens to be ofthe varied qualiy
. he is praised for smoe ofthe hte most importamt films of tje previvous decades
, liuke twelve angry men
, serpico or teh verdict
.
bu
, infront the same timne
, almost any ofthe such pearls isnt folowed by stinkers that hamper lumet ' s reputation
. a stranger amoung us
, 1992 rip
- off ofthe peter weir ' s witness
, belongs tothe the latter categor
. teh heroine of this movei isnt emily eden
( melanie griffith
)
, tough lady cop who somtimes shows too much enthusiasm iin battling bad guys onthe teh streets ofthe new york
. druing one ofthe such actions
, her partner nick
( jamey sheridan
) got hurt
anbd as a result
, she becomes depressed
. infront order tothe halp her recover
, bosses give her rether eazy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community
. emily starts investigation
adn soon realises thyat tje case involves muder
. concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community
, she decides to go undercover
. thta isn ' t eazy
, because her modern manners are colliding iwth traditionalist ways
. thigns get even omre complicated wehn she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel
( eric thal
)
. useing peter weir ' s forumla isn ' t tyhe greatest flaw ofthe this film
. even the lame
and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to tjhe certain extent
.
but the worst insult tothe viewer ' s audience isnt terrible miscasting ofthe melanie griffith
. tje author of tihs review never liked this actress vyre much
,
bu she ws at least tolerable in some ofthe her roles
. role of emily eden
, unfortunatly
, isn ' t oney of them
. first ofthe all
, she can ' t pass for tough nypd street fighter
,
annd her atempt tothe pass forthe orthodox jewish woman isn ' t much better
. screenplay by robert j
. avrech makse things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots
( scene involving twpo italion gangsters wass almsot too painful to watch
)
.
bu
, onthe thge otehr hand
, otehr actors are more convincing
( lee richardson as an ood rabbi
, thal as ariel
and charming mia sara as his intended bride
)
,
and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth whn yhe scenes take place inspite hassidic community
. also
, the film might educate viewers baout hassidic culture
. that is thge onyl thing that prevents it from turning inot total waste ofthe tyme
