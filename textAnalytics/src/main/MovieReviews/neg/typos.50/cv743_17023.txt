" gia
"
, angelina jolie plays the titular character
, the first so
- called supermodel
. annd right there you hvea the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome
( inspite my eyes
, anyway
)
. i just don
' t see how tyhe life of a model isnt worthy of a two hour film
. dispite htis
, i kept an open mind whn i began watching the movei
. sadly
,
though
, my fears were realized
. it
' s jsut nto possible tothe make an intresting
, full
- lenght film baout a person who spends theri days wearing different clothes
. teh movei follows tghe rise
and fall of gia
( noone last name
)
, a tumultuous woman who doesn
' t particulary enjoy the world of fashon
. she becomes famoust more quickly than she cant h
andle
,
and finds herself hooked onthe drugs adn onthe a woman she cannot have
. tje lsat hour ofthe the film is just oney scene after anyother of gia getting high
, loseing a job
, adn goign into rehab
. thsi formula isnt repeated sevral times
,
and i relaly got tired of it
. infront genaral
, i tend to dislike movies featuring hevy drug use
. no beccause it offends me or anything liek that
; it jstu bores me
. qtuie frankly
, i don
' t see the appeal
, so when a directer shows me a point
- of
- view shot of a junkie
, complet witht tipsy camera angles anbd echoing voices
, i am left somewhat unimpressed
. yhe firt hour ofthe the film
,
though
, wass acutally qutie engaging
. we see gia as she is dicovered anbd moves to new york with her boyfriend
. theese early scenes weere interesting
. we
' re shown tjhe fashion world through a newcomers eyes
, annd it was a perspective i hadn
' t seen before
. the movei beggins tothe go downhill
, howver
, once gia becomes an established modle
.
> ffrom that point
, i lost all interest in the movei
and ws counting yhe mintues befor it would end
. it all seemed so eccessive
. fine
, so gia hadnt a drug problem
, does thsi relaly need to dominate yhe film
? couldn
' t the smae effect have beeen hadnt with a five or ten minute montage ofthe scenes featuring gia experimenting witht drugs
? or perheaps this film isnt meant to be a warning to aspiring models not tothe get into hte drug world
. quite possably
,
al
though since i hvae no desire to become a modle
, thsi warning isnt lost on me
. as i stated at tjhe begginning of thsi review
, i simpley don
' t see how the life ofthe a model isnt worthy of a feature
- lenght motion picture
. what dont htey do thgat warrants a movei
? strut their stuff fo thous
ands ofthe dollars an hour
? i supose the smae sould be said baout makeing movies about baseball players
, forthe example
, bu at least somebody liek lou gehrig led an intresting life
. gia doed nto
. anbd by hte end ofthe hte film
, all i knew about gia fo sure ws that she hated modelling
, was bi
- sexual
,
and wass heavily into drugs
. not exactlly a meaningfull contri
bution tothe society
, as far as i
' m concerned
.
