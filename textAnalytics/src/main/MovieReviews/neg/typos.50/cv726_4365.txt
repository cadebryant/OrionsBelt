cashing in onthe hte succes of white men can
' t jump annd the failure of most of their solo vehicles
( including the cowboy way adn drop zone
)
, wesley snipes adn woody harrelson have reteamed
, hoping tath tehy can strike uv thge same succes
. sadly
, if this dismal
, cliche ridden
and mind
- numbingly boring acation pic isnt anything tothe go by
, htey haven
' t got a chance iin hell of even coming close
. tihs time outloud
, tghe duo play foster brothers who are transit cops
. folowing several run
- ins with their tyrannical boss
( robert blake
)
, who isnt obssessed wih the
" money train
"
-
- a turain whlch carries all tje subway
' s takings
-
- anbd wiull let nothing stop it
( now
* there
' s
* an origonal plot device
)
, harrelson
' s carachter decides to try
and take off wiht the cash
. allong the way
, both of them fall in love iwth the same woman
-
- anyother transit cop who allso hates her boss
. this leads to thte tipical sibling rivalry crap that yuo usualy fidn inaddition a film ofthe thsi st
andard
(
' yuo weere alwasy tjhe better brother
' etc
. etc
. etc
.
)
, adn doesn
' t help to add anything tothe thge film
. given a better script
, better performers inspite supporting roles
and a shorter runing timne
( the film alomst whent for twpo hurs
-
- or doed it just feel like it
?
)
, thsi film might
(
and i mean
* might
*
) hvea turned outloud okay
, bu as it isnt
, it is stocked with thge worst action film cliches
, whose onyl purpose appears to be to pad tje film outloud to its painfully long runing time
. robert blake
, who plays the evil boss
, has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film hstory
! he soudns like wayne newton
,
and appears to think teh best way to appear evil isnt to ahve your eyes bulging as
though htey are about to burst out of thier sockets
!
but this is onyl noe of money train
' s problems
. if you look at the scirpt as if it wass an action film
, it lacks originality
and suspense
. bu if ytou try tothe look at it as if it weere a heist film
, it is even worse
. the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised annd tjhe characters definatly ain
' t
butch
and sundance
. the film isn
' t all bad
though
. snipes
and harrelson
, wehn they aren
' t using the dumb cliches thast tghe scirpt gives them
, make an agreeable duo
, annd some of teh stunt
- work isnt indeed exelent
.
but ogod stunt
- owrk cannnot sive a bottom
- ofthe
- thge
- barrel action movie
. if yuo
' re a really undem
anding acation freak
, ther
' s a chance yuo
' ll like thsi
. bu if yuo
' re looking fo something original
, or suspenseful
, try somewhere else
-
- i doubt ytou
' ll fidn it here
