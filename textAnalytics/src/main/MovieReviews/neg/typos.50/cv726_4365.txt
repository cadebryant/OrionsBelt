cashing iin on thte success ofthe white men cxan ' t jump
anbd the failure of most ofthe their solo vehicles
( including the cowboy way
annd drop zone
)
, wesley snipes
annd woody harrelson have reteamed
, hoping that htey can strike up thte smae sucess
. sadly
, if this dismal
, cliche ridden
and mind
- numbingly boring action pic is anytying tothe go by
, tehy haven ' t got a chance in hell of even comming close
. this time out
, the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops
. follwoing severeal run
- ins with thier tyrannical boss
( robert blake
)
, who is obssessed with the
" money turain
"
-
- a turain which carries all the subway ' s takings
-
-
and iwll let nothing stpo it
( nowe
* there ' s
* an orginal plot device
)
, harrelson ' s character decides to try
annd tkae off with the cash
. along teh way
, both ofthe them fall in loev with the smae woman
-
- anohter transit cop who aslo hates her boss
. this leads tothe the tipical sibling rivalry crap that you usualy fidn inaddition a film ofthe this standart
( ' you were alwasy hte better brother ' etc
. etc
. etc
.
)
,
and doesn ' t help to add anytying tothe the film
. given a better script
, better performers inthe supporting roles
and a shorter running tyme
( tje film almost whent for two hours
-
- or doed it jsut feel liuke it
?
)
, htis film might
(
and i mean
* might
*
) hvae turned outloud okay
,
bu as it isnt
, it isnt stocked with hte worst action film cliches
, whose onyl purpose appears to be tothe pad thte film outloud tothe its painfully long running time
. robert blake
, who plays the evil boss
, has got tothe be the most pathetic bad guy in film history
! he sounds like wayne newton
,
anbd appears tothe thiunk tjhe best way to apear evil is tothe ahev your eyes bulging as
though they are baout to burst out ofthe their sockets
!
but thsi is onyl oen ofthe money train ' s problems
. if yuo look at tjhe script as if it was an acation film
, it lacks originality
and suspense
.
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film
, it is even worse
. the fianl robbery sequence isnt almsot trivialised
anbd tjhe charachters definitely ain ' t butch
and sundance
. the film isn ' t all bad
though
. snipes
anbd harrelson
, when they aren ' t useing thte dumb cliches thta tghe scirpt gives them
, amking an agreeable duo
,
and some of the stunt
- work is indeed excellent
.
bu good stunt
- wrok cannot save a bottom
- ofthe
- tjhe
- barrel action movei
. if ytou ' re a realyl undemanding acation freak
, htere ' s a chance ytou ' ll liuke tihs
.
bu if yuo ' re looking for something orginial
, or suspenseful
, try somewhere alse
-
- i dout you ' ll fidn it here
