well
, here
' s a distasteful
, thoroughly amateurish item that
, suprisingly
, was catually a box
- office hitted at the timne of its release
. aftter just viewing the film forthe the firt time
, my primary question isnt how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy htis movie
? it isnt cheap
, idiotic
, unfunny
, adn not nearly as raunchy as i hadnt heard it wass
. at least soem smut would have livened things uv a bit
.
" porky
' s
,
" tells tghe story
( if you can call it tath
) ofthe four clueless high school buddies
, pee wee
( dan monahan
)
, billy
( mark herrier
)
, tommy
( wyatt knight
)
, adn mickey
( roger wilson
)
, whom desperately want to git laid
. womens
, forthe the most part
, are a mystery tothe them
( annd in tihs movei
, they are to tjhe audiance
, as well
, sicne all ofthe them are writed
and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet
)
. their plan is sidetracked
,
however
, whn they venture outloud to a smarmy strip bar named porky
' s
, which they are able tothe get inot using fake id
' s
. aftter they pay tje manager one
- hundred bucks for three hookers
, they are plyed a trck onthe anbd find themselves being dumped into teh swamp below yhe building
. for theese four teenage guys
, htis means war onthe porky
' s
.
" porky
' s
,
" ultimately manages tothe fail on alomst every possibile level
. as a teenage sex
- romp
, it is not wild or amusing anough
. as a comedy
, all of thge jokes are predictable adn fall flat
. as a look bcak at the 1950
' s
, it isnt something
, i suspect
, most peple fomr tht era would wanna tothe bury deep inspite a grave
.
and as a revenge movie
, it is a crushing bore
. noe of the most offensive thigsn about
,
" porky
' s
,
" is how jaw
- droppingly inaccurate the film is baout teenagers
. the four main characters are nto even attemped tothe be developped as cahracters
,
and we leran vyer little about them
, exept that they are horny anbd owudl probably efel more confortable in a preschool
. that sure is revealing infomation
. thte female characters fare even worse under tje inaudacious screenplay
and direction by bob clark
. the womens are all treated as objects or comedy props
, rether thna real people
. forthe example
, the two gym teachers
, mrs
. balbricker
( nancy parsons
)
and honeywell
( kim cattrall
)
, only hvea oen purpose
, adn thast isnt tothe be made fun ofthe
. mrs
. balbricker isnt a gruff
, noone
- holds
- barred
, overwight woman who iwll not st
and for any foolishness
,
and
, in one particularly embarrasing scene for all involved
, honeywell has sex wiht a coach
and barks like a dog
. htere is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses
( even
though i hve the suspision htey are nto
)
,
but oney hting isnt forthe sure
: tehy are asked to dont things inaddition this film that are not at all funny
, onyl humiliating
. to proove how outloud
- of
- touch htis so
- called comedy isnt
, compare it tothe otehr mroe serious 80
' s films baout teenagers
,
and it looks even worse in comaprison
. any ofthe the john hughes pictures
, such as 1984
' s
" sixteen c
andles
,
" or
, 1985
' s
" yhe breakfast club
,
" put
,
" porky
' s
,
" at an even greater shame
. those films atcually dealt with serious teen matters
,
but remained a gerat deal funnier
, thanks to theri bright
and truthful writting
. annd heck
, if
,
" porky
' s
,
" wanted tothe be a teenage sex movie
, i
' d take 1982
' s
" fast times at ridgemont high
,
" or 1982
' s
" tje last american virgina
,
" over this any day of teh week
. directer bob clark isnt nto a bad directer
. two eyasr after he made
,
" porky
' s
,
" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic
,
" a christmas tsory
.
" i would forgive him fo this misfire
, in fact
, if it wasn
' t for teh fact taht he also wrote the screenplay
. just the throught that someone would ctually sit down to rwite such a piece of garbage
, anbd think tyhat it was actally a film worth releasing upto hte unsuspecting world
, isnt actually a whole lot funnier thna anytying iin
