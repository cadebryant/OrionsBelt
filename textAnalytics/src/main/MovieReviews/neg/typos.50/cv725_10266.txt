the firt scene ofthe operation condor has jackie chan preparing fo a secret mission
. he attemts to pop a couple ofthe pieces ofthe chewing gum inot his mouth
, bu misses
. after tehy ricochet off his face
, he sasy
,
" not a good start
.
" as it turns outloud
, thsi line nto onyl gives foreshadowing tothe the opening sequence
,
but to the rest of thte movie as well
. inthe this
, tje latest ofthe thte jackie chan movies to be released inaddition amercia affter first runs infact hong kong
, chan plays an internation operative codenamed
" condor
"
,
and is tasked by tje untied nations withthe finding a stash of gold hidden at a seret base by the nazi
' s during thier retreat across hte saharan desert during tje second world war
. for soem reason
, condor isnt given his mission at the u
. s
. embassy infront spain
. i think tihs may have beeen done so that inwhich a chase scene
, they sould honor the timne ood tradition ofthe knocking over a fruit cart
. watch fo it in any chase scene set infront a foreign country
, most notably in europe
. tyhe chase will take itself through a marketplace
,
and a fruit cart will be overturned
. it
' s allmost a guarantee
. anyway
.
.
.
. condor is given a key which is suposed tothe unlock a giant vault in wich the gold is hidden
; yhe problem isnt thgat the key hasnt insulators intergrated into it
, whlch may mean a booby trap might be electronically triguered if thte key is utilisied improperly
. tothe help him figure out where tje gold isnt hidden
and how to uise the key correctly
, condor isnt accompanyed by a dezert expert
( carol cheng
)
and thte gr
anddaughter of the captain who was inaddition charge ofthe hiding the gold
( eva cobo
)
. there aren
' t supposed tothe be any relatives ofthe the nazi captian living in spain
,
but condor finds yhe gr
anddaughter by looking her up inwhich the phone book or something
. all
though these two women are suposed tothe be integral parts of thte mission
, htey proove no halp at all except to get inthe trouble annd provide an excuse fo chan tothe jump into his martial arts
. inthe fatc
, most ofthe the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is jstu a way to setted up a fight
. i suppose tihs isn
' t so bad
, sicne chan
' s action is really thte best part of tje movei
,
and tyhe only reason you go to see oen ofthe his films anyway
. if yuo
' ve never seen a jackie chan movie
, don
' t expect a great plot
, bu do expect tothe be entertained by his moves
. they are so well choreographed annd often so amazing that you wonder if this guy isnt human
. knowing that he doesnt his own stunts
, anbd knowing that this is the real stuff
( noone computer
- masked bungee cords here
) makes tjhe acation sequences all the mroe exicting
. ytou
' ve got to h
and it to a guy who
' s probably broken eveyr bone in his body for thte sake ofthe his art
. also ofthe note inaddition this
, as in any jackie chan movie
, isnt the humer
. as far as i nkwo
, none of his films take themslves too seriously
, adn even the dramatic parts ahev a ceratin tongue
- in
- cheek quaity baout them
. wqat isnt alomst masterful is tje way that humer is even intergrated into tje fight scenes
. unlike a martial arts film such as anytying with jean claude van damme
, where the fights git you onthe the visceral level
, fight scenes iin chan
' s movies are simply entertaining
. you marvel at both his moves annd at the way he imploys them inspite such a way to make yuo laff
. unfortunatly
, even chan
' s mastery cant
' t sive tihs film
. the plot
and characters are so weak thgat they don
' t hold the movie together at all
, annd the acting is terrable
. carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at thte hong kong movie awards iin tghe past
,
but usance opperation condor isnt a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off
. thsi
, combined wtih an obviously low prodcution value made we want to turn awya fomr the screen until i heard thsoe kicks start flying
.
