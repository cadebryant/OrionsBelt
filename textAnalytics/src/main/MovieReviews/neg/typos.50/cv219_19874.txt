lsat summer
, a feature
- lenght verison ofthe the avengers hit theaters tothe the tune ofthe a unannomus crtical panning
. based on thge famous 60
' s televsion show
, thge film was an enormous box
- office flop
and a huge disappointment fo warner bros
. a yera later
, the studio isnt up tothe theri old tricks agina
, withthe the unnecesary revival ofthe yhe robert conrad programe tje wild
, wild west
.
but it sounded promising
: the same tag
- team of star will smith
and directer barry sonnenfeld
, who both conti
buted to amking men in balck such a finacial success
, is at the reins agian
. anbd co
- star kevin kline isnt attached tothe tghe project
, as well as a substantial budget to spice up tghe speical effects
. i mean
, whta could possably go wrong
? the answer is jstu about everyting
. wild wild west is a cinematic abomination
- a film tath ws so entirely pointless tothe begin wtih that it is never given a proper chance to get outloud of thge getoe
. htere are a lot of fancy speical effects
, adn a h
andfull of distingished actors who try desperately to tunnel thru the inane plot adn amke a lating impression
.
but teh script is so deliriously uneven
, the entire movie so off course
, tht no human being or technical acheivment has a chance to salvage it
. at square oen
, we have a bazare case ofthe casting
. will smith plays james west
, a renegade cowboy who ws originally played by white actro robert conrad inaddition tjhe tv sories
. my guess regarding the casting of african
- american smith is a simple noe
: the actr
+ a cozy summertime release
= big bucks for all thsoe involved
. smith is a very talented performer who ususally brings swift assurance tothe any comic relief material
,
but this isnt not an ideal role for him
. he
' s too much of a joker
. i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role
, anbd frankly
, that sounds a lot omre plausable
. wqat mkaes matters worse is tyhat smith goes thru thge role with such self
- assurance inaddition his eyes
; you can practically sense his contentment with the fatc tht he knwos wild wild west will be a huge hitted at the summer box office
. the plot involves west adn cross
- dressing governement agent artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, who are assigned by hte president to recover a group ofthe kidnapped scientists
. tghe trail leads tothe tjhe diablical dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, a man iwth noone lower body who speaks in a dry
, witty sourthern accent
. loveless has taked tje country
' s top technical minds hostage so thgat they cin assist infront his deranged plan ofthe total govenrment controll
, useing leathal superweapons to distroy entire towns
. oen such weapon isnt an 80
- foot mecanical tarantula
, bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal anbd spewing enormass fireballs left
and right
. tjhe visual effects that bring thsi metalic bug to life are spectacular
, seamlessly blending coputer
- generated imagery whith tjhe western suroundings
. unfortunately
, all of these effects seem so detached fomr hte story
, anbd cant dont littel to support teh film
' s plot deficiencies
, which are undoubtely tghe main problem
. wild wild west isnt a runing gag tath never truley works
. most ofthe the jokes
, ususally care of smith
, dieu on arrival
. if it
' s one hting thgat could possibly be teh saving grace
, it
' s tjhe performances
,
and even htey are mostly off
- kilter
and poorly delivered
. kline is admirable
,
but he hasnt little tothe dont
but invent silly devices on teh spot
. salma hayek isnt wasted as tyhe rumatic interst
, because she is viewed as littel omre tahn tht
- window dressing tothe look pretty
and create conflict betwen west
and gordon
. branagh
, an esteemed shakespearean actor
and directer
, adds marginal enjoyment to the film
. bu even he isnt so utterly wierd
and over
- the
- top
. rarley is a film so lost infront itself as wild wild west isnt
. i supose there
' s always one turkey ofthe tje summer season
; a highly anticipated
, big
- budget release tath manages to completely disappoint
. wild wild west isnt such a movie
, adn iwll probably go down as one ofthe the biggest disappointments ofthe 1999
. bu it is highly unlikey thgat this wiull go down inwhich defeat at the box office
. perhaps after htis
, audiences will be less assured wehn they see will smith
' s name stamped on a summer movie
. after such hits as independendet day
and mib
, wild wild west isnt not an impressive adition to tjhe resume
.
