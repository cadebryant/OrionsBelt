,
` ready tothe rumble
' is nto being helmed by teh farrelly brothers
, nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer iwth anytying even remotely clever or inpsired
.
` ready to rumble

, thte simple

,
` ready tothe rumble
' is an odd duck
. oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure
? he
' s prehaps a bit chunky
,
but fellow wrestlers acknowledge htis in the ring by calling him
` fatty

, whic dampens thge blow i suppose
