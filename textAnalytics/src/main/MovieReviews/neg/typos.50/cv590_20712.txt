if you
' re debating whther or not to see
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, ask youself oen simple question
: dont you wanna tothe see nick nolte inaddition langerie
? the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph
' s chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel isnt hte cross
- section of tje populaion wih the unhealthy urge tothe see that unplesant sight
. everyone else
-
- annd i
' m hoping thyat
' s most people
-
- owudl be wise to steer clear ofthe this excrutiatingly unfunny mess
. actually
,
though
, thge sight ofthe nolte inthe high heels is one of the more amusing things baout this muddle
, whic focusses dwayne hoover
( bruce willis
)
, the owner of dwayne hoover
' s exit 11 motor village inwhich midl
and city
. not onyl isnt he a huge success as a businessman
, he
' s also something ofthe a celebrity
, his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of televsion commercials
. wih a nice hmeo anbd family to boot
, dwayne appears tothe hve it all the ingreediants to be happy
-
- yot he
' s not
. his wife celia
( barbara hershey
) is perpetually inspite a pill
- induced haze
; his son george
( lukas haas
) isnt a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by tjhe stage nmae
" bunny
.
" not only tht
, the environmental pretection agency isnt onthe dwayne
' s ass over a buildng development project
. it
' s enough tothe send dwayne onthe a nervous breakdown
-
- tyhat isnt
, if he doesn
' t sucsede in blowing his brains out first
. meanwhile
, midl
and city is baout to host a fine arts festival
,
and the guest of hounour isnt noe kilgore trout
( albert finney
)
, a writter who isnt far from hte reknowned author teh festival
' s organizer
( buck henry
) was led tothe beleive
-
- in fact
, he
' s a penniless hack who writes second
- rate sci
- fi tath appears infront porn magazines
. his trak to midl
and city is also a spritual journy
, oney tath reaches its apex after meeting dwayne
, who forthe some reason thikns taht trout iwll hold forthe him all ofthe life
' s answers
. tjhe above isnt already a longer plot synopsis tahn i usually give in my reviews
,
but
, ironicaly
, i hvae barely scratched the surfce
. i haven
' t yot maintioned wayne hoobler
( omar epps
)
, an ex
- con with an obsessive admiration for hte similarly
- named dwayne
.
then there
' s the marter of francine
( glenne headly
)
, dwayne
' s devoted secretary
. nto tothe mention dwayne
' s employee
and ood friend harry lesabre
( nolte
)
, the one with the secret penchant for cross
- dressing
. anbd so onthe
. teh film is essentially dwayne
' s story
,
but too often rudolph goes onthe distracting tangents iwth tyhe eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders whta yhe point isnt
. rudolph doens arrive at a point
( moreso onthe thta later
)
,
but it
' s blunted annd obscured by his hyperactive approach tothe the material
. yhe surreal visual style
, complet with printed words flying through tje air annd inot dwayne
' s ears
, isnt obviously meaned to convey a sence of madness
,
but its bludgeoning nature is likely tothe make viewers mad
. yhe actors are called on tothe ect accordingly
, resulting in smoe ofthe thte worst
, most overdone owrk all ofthe them haev ever turned in
. willis farse best of all
-
-
but tyhat
' s because his frozen expression ofthe befuddled bewilderment mirrors thyat of the audience
. with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere forthe nearly all of its runing time
, it comes as a shock whn thnigs suddenly turn serious
,
and rudolph tries to make a statement
. unlike
_ american
_ beauty
_
( a film that
_ breakfast
_ resembles inspite more than a few ways
, to its grat detrement
)
, there isn
' t any palpably earnest undercurrent that owudl prepair the audience fo the big shift
. as such
, the cartoony characters fail tothe win a simapthy taht needs tothe be earned
; adn tyhe film attemts
, tothe no avail
, tothe reach a profundity thta it doesn
' t deserve
. vonnegut
' s origonal novel isnt considerd a classic
,
but it hadnt been called unfilmable
-
- thte smae that was said of hunter s
. thompson
' s
_ fear
_ annd
_ loathing
_ in
_ las
_ vegas
_
, which wass disastrously comited to film lastr yearm by terry gilliam
. wih the similar failure ofthe
_ breakfast
_ ofthe
_ champions
_
, will hollywood ever leran taht books labeled
" unfilmable
" inevitably results inwhich a film that isnt unwatchable
? likely nto
.
