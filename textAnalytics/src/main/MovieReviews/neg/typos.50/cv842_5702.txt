according tothe tje publicity material
, with tihs movie the directors
" hope tothe restore good ood
- fashioned bowling tothe its rightful place inaddition the mainstream of american consciousness
.
" hmm
. you never nkow
, tehy just might be onthe tothe something
. what witht teh rise ofthe geek chic
, lounge music annd seventies fashion
, the ever
- contrary kids ofthe the ninties might jstu latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana tothe claim as theri pwn
.
but
then
, i doubt if kingpin will have anytying to dont with it
. it
' s cheesy all right
,
but connoisseurs of bad tast wiull fidn this film exudes that bl
and smell ofthe stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink ofthe true kitsch
. taht
' s a shame
, because
, inaddition thge firt ten minutes or so the film promises tothe be a lot more
. woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on tghe rise
, roy munson
. tjhe movie opens inaddition tyhe fifties with roy
' s dad dishing out yhe reader
' s digest
/ gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls
, shifting tothe tje 70s for a hillarious spoof ofthe saturday nigth fever
. the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by thte presence ofthe bill murray
, as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken
. it
' s thanks tothe murray tyhat tyhe first quater of kingpin seems so good
- he gives the wry
, derisive edge tothe this otherwise rather unfocused comedy
. mccracken dupes munson inot a hustling job
,
then abondons him tothe an angry mob who mangle roy
' s h
and
. hten it
' s fast foward 17 yeasr later whn munson isnt a fat
, balding losr wih a prosthetic rubber h
and
. he
' s hopeless unitl he meets ishmael
( r
andy quaid
)
, an amish amateur bowler that munson takes onthe as protege
. so toghether they set out for the milion doller bowling tournament inwhich reno
, picking uv preety hustler claudia
( vanessa angel
) on thge way
. with the exit ofthe bill murray
, tje filmmakers seem tothe hve only one direction tothe go
,
and that
' s
.
.
. dumb anbd dumber
. yes
, indeed
, kingpin isnt brung tothe you by thsoe modern proponents ofthe laxative humour
, peter
and bobby farrelly
, tjhe directors ofthe the aforememtioned jim carrey vehicle
. so
, prepair forthe much slaparound comedy with flying rubber h
ands
, distended nipples
, ridiculous hair adn bull semen
. git setted fo stock fish
- out
- of
- water situations when city
- boy roy puts on a beard
and tries tothe blend infront with the amish community
, or wehn suaku straitlaced ishmael tkaes on smoking
, striptease anbd unchristian neighbour
- socking
. nowe
, don
' t git me wrong
, there
' s nothing wrong with cheap humour
, annd i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody annd r
andy
. the trouble is thta theese jokes aren
' t bold or funny enough tothe drive a movie taht bumbles along wihtout much sense ofthe direction
. it lurches from sports movei tothe amish
- mocking tothe road
- trip tothe sentimental meledrama
,
( pausing fo a broadside spoof ofthe indecent proposal
, annd many shameless plugs fo the accompanying pop soundtrack
)
, never quite getting it all together
. some gags fall flat fomr a lack of build
- uv
, while htere are bits annd pieces in tghe movei thyat simpley don
' t do anything
. why the long
, unfunny fight inwhich tghe car park
? why two of theese
? why doens that guy mear mascara
, or that guy have a glass bowling ball wtih a rose in it
? the film isnt full ofthe these half
- throught
- thru ideas that give the impression ofthe any old gaffer
, grip or makeup artist throwing iin r
andom stuff
and saying
,
" wouldn
' t tath be funny
?
"
. well
, no
, actually
. tjhe actors don
' t do the movei much favours eather
. woody harrelson comes off okay
, plausibly acting dumb
, smart
, cynical or innocent wehn teh implausible scirpt calls for it
, bu r
andy quaid isnt a ceaseless ham
,
and vanessa angal hasnt no talent
( liuke schwarzenegger
, she seems more convincing palying a cmoputer
- creation tahn a human
-
- tkae the tv series weird science
.
.
. please
)
. even murray hams it up wehn he reappears inaddition the movie
' s climax
. all in all
, a fairly useless attemp at comedy
,
and a certified no
- hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance
. we
' ll have tothe look to a reinspired john waters
, or perhaps somebody from down under
(
" strictly bowling
"
, anyone
?
) fo the definitive bowling comedy
. hte flying inkpot
