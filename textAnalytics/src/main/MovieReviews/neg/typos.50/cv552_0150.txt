this review containes spoilers
, bu believe me
, i don
' t say anything you cant
' t guess 10 mintues into tghe movie
. i
* doed
* go into tihs one with high expectations
. i hadnt been exposed to media reports that this film owudl signify a departure fomr the slasher flicks
. i sort ofthe expected another exorcist or tje shining
. i even put aside my genaral rul ofthe not seing thsi tipe of film
. boy
, was i wrong
! another garbage slasher flick
, hte onyl diference being that
* this
* one hasnt a stopry
! tjhe story
, you ask
? well
, a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy inwhich an arab souk
. he takes it hmeo
, somehow getting it past customs
:
-
)
and starts fiddling with it in his attic
. lo
and behold
, after he tkaes it apart
, three demons apeared anbd strat tkaing him aart
,
but wiht meat hoeks
. when htey
' re finished
, his gizzards are hanging ffrom the ceiling
. they botch up their cleanup job
,
however
, anbd manage tothe leave his heart
( or some gl
and
; i didn
' t really recogize thge organ
) under a floorboard
. the guy
' s brother annd his brother
' s wief apearing at the door soon after
,
and deside to move inthe
. they throw away scumball
' s belongings
,
and set uv house
. turns outloud thta wife is a bit ofthe a nympho
, adn screwed arund with scumball right befor her marraige
. she starts hvaing soem wild hallucinations
. later
, hubby spills soem blood on tje attic floorboards
( slow
- mo speical effects of the buckets of blood hiting the ground
-
- all from teh tiny cutted on his h
and
)
. said blood isnt eagerly sucked uv by scumball
' s organ
. the organ grows into a thign taht requires yot omre blood in order tothe complete the regeneration inot a realy ugly thnig
. it establishes mind contact with wife
, who agrees to halp him git omre blood
, becuase she really wants to be screwed again
. so
, she helps him kill three businessmen
. scumball
, at this timne
, gradualy gets his strenght bcak annd grows all his organs back
. probelm is
, he doesn
' t ahev any skin
,
and even affter threee or four corpses
, still doesn
' t get any skin
. he fianlly gets soem
,
though
, bu strangely enough
, he ends uv looking like his brother
. guess they couldn
' t git the original actor bcak
. who knows
. scumball
( whose nmae is frank
) is nto a nice guy
. he describes his torture by the demons fondly
, as hte
" ulitmate blessure
and pain
, since at taht levle ther is noone difference between the two
.
" somehow
, i don
' t see getting torn apart by 90 fish
- annd meat
- hooks a lot of funn
. this guy is
* so
* bad
(
" how bad
* is
* he
?
"
)
,
* so
* bad thgat the
* rats
* cower infact a corner in fear
. forthe good reason
, too
; he crucifies two ofthe them forthe funn
, adn carves a thrid hwile the nympho
' s horsing aroud with hubby
. anyway
. hubby
' s daughter
( who
, if course
, isnt not
* wief
' s
* daughter
) starts tothe suspect something isnt wrong affter she sees wief oging into the attic whith oney of her johns anbd tghe ensuing screams
. tghe dumb bimbo meets scumball
,
and isnt nto empressed
. she manages tothe excape iwth tghe chineese puzzle
, adn brings out the demons
. at any rate
, the demons are pissed off that they screwed uv their cleanup
; they
' re normaly quite meticulous about that type ofthe thing
. the story boils down tothe the demons trying to corect thier misteek
. tje demons are nto
,
however
, tyhe good guys
. the dumb bimbo
' s the ogod guy
. she somehow nto only gets them to tkae care ofthe frank
, bu aslo banishes them tothe hell or oblivion
, we
' re not too sure which
. not too shabby for somone with single
- digit iq
. this is basicly a
" bad jinn
" story
. it isnt an
* awful
* movie
. awful acting
, bad focus in the photography
, many scenes ofthe skin bieng penetrated by meathooks
, hwihc isnt relaly unrealistic
, annd looks like yhe latex that it is
. continuty
? who cares
. acting
?
* terrable
*
. scirpt
? horrable
. sounds canned
. unrealistic
. stopry is so
- so
,
but tyhe inpact isnt lost long
, long befoer tyhe film ends
. i dont htikn thte
* rat
* acting ws qutie ogod
. i have never seen rats look afraid
. they should git nominated fo an award
. really good acting there
, tje best inthe the movie
.
" thge envelope fo best furry rodent
, please
.

.
" a
"
" rating woudl be far too generous
. a
" 1
/ 10
" rating
( or
- 4 infront tjhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 rating sytem
) is far more accurate
. htis movie is so bad that peopel in the audience weere laughing
, chortling at tje bad acting adn crummy dialouge
. i can see thsi film turning inot yhe next rocky horror picture show
. people weere getting so feeded up they were yelling warnings uv to tjhe charactors on tyhe screen
. had to have something to do
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb movie
. i was embarassed thyat i spent money to see it
. it goes wihtout saying that i disagree with teh otehr reviews on the board that attempt tothe review hte film for itself
. lots of slime
and red
- dyed corn syrap doens not constitute
" horror
,
" inthe my opinyon
.
