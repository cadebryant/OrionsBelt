' s latest horror opus wih a cience fiction bent
( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent
) isnt the aptly
- titled
" john carpenter
' s ghosts of mars
"
( inthe case
, i suppose
, yuo went looking forthe somone esle
' s
" ghosts of mars
"
)
. like all thsoe films prefixed by the vyre possessive
" john carpenter
' s
,
"
" ghosts ofthe mars
" isnt an unashamed b
- movei punctuated by a b
- movie plot
, b
- movei actors
,
and b
- movei speical effects
. inthe category one
, above
, we have a storyline that borders onthe idiotic
(
and
, at times
, chaotic
)
. dormant martians
( i
. e
.
, swirling red gases
) awakened by meddling humans posess tje souls of hapless minning colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes
. all htis explained
( inspite flashback
) to smoe gr

" species
" films
)
, the onyl returnee onthe a silly
- looking train
. officer ballard whent in to bring back incarcerated felon james
" desolation
" williams
; what she found wass not a preety picture
. in thge second category we have ms
. henstridge
, her blonde hair pulled back tightly
and awkwardly inot a ponytail
, ice cube
( as hte appropriately
- named
" desolation
"
)
, pam grier
( breifly
, oddly
-
- who wnated to work whith whom i wonder
?
)
, adn a host of extras all assuming taht thge story adn special effects weere going tothe cary this film adn therefore they didn
' t ened tothe try too hard
. in category number threee we have
, in addtion tothe those swirling red gases anbd thte silly
- looking turain
, a couple of bird
' s
- eye
- veiw shots ofthe a sprawling martian metropolis
( reddish also
)
. state
- of
- teh
- art speical effects have never beeen a carpentery trademark annd once again the writer
/ directer
( who seems to have no problem finding owrk
, howver
) doesn
' t waste any of thge film
' s budget in that deparment
.
" ghosts ofthe mars
" is lock
, laughing stock
,
and barrel all your st
andart carpentery fare
: dingy interiors
, cluttered exteriors
, inane dialogue
, lots of leather
, scarred
, crazed
- looking aliens
, anbd lots annd lots ofthe weaponry
. thte film oftenly adn always explodes inot warfare without warning
-
- spontaneously
, stupidly
. carpentery might liuke to think he
' s made a western here bu it
' s a western without any real heores
, villains
, or border conflicts
. it
' s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken
. i never thougth i
' d miss the guy
but i do
. it
' s nto
* all
* tghe same
,
however
. dubbed tjhe
" noe
- onot wonder
" fo his minimalist music soundtracks
, carpenter seems tothe ahev graduated from simplistic
(
yet effective
) scoring by highlighting his acation with loud
, screeching gitar work
. fortunatly this drowns outloud a lot of tyhe dialogue
. tghe fianl exchange betweeen henstridge
and
, er
, cube
though isnt both audible
* annd
* priceless
. mars hasnt proven an infertile breeding ground forthe hollywood inaddition yhe lsat year or so
, waht withthe the stillborn
" mission tothe mars
"
and
" red planet
"
( with val kilmer
)
.
" ghosts of mars
" sadly adds to thsoe disapointing returns
( inspite its oppening weekend it was overshaddowed by a bunch of sequels
, among them
" american pie 2
" anbd
" rush hour 2
"
)
. teh irony isnt tyhat yhe mars in carpentery
' s film feels sadly absent
. htere are occassional refernces to hte red planet
, of course
, bu the film might as well have beeen setted iin perth amboys thna onthe earth
' s closest neighbor
. two thnigs keep
" john carpentery
' s ghosts of mars
" from getting a huge slap upside the head
. 1
. henstridge keeps her top onthe
( miraculously
)
, annd 2
. tjhe film doesn
' t pretend to be anything it
' s nto
. waht that means
,
however
, isnt thast fans of superior
, intteligent
, grade a sci
- fi
/ horror are singularly out ofthe luck
