.
" now i have to admited
, tyhe trailer for thsi rock
- opera
- turned
- major motion picture isnt almost breath
- taking forthe smoe
. the sountrack isnt wonderful to listen to
. so why wouldn ' t yhe movie be wonderfull tothe see
. simple
, a little over 2 hours of constatn singing can almost drive you insane
. teh stopry ofthe eva duarte
( madonna
)
, evita is full of drama that ' s trapped inside by all the notes
and chords
. she wass an orphaned child who ends uv becoming a hooker
,
then goes into hte field of acting
,
and finaly meets juan peron
( price
)
, yhe soon
- to
- be first presidetn ofthe argentina
. htey fall infact love
annd eventally marry
. soudns pretty ogod
, doesn ' t it
. well teh stopry gets better
, as eva goes on the
" rainbow tour
" accros europe
, trying tothe win respect
. eva duarte wass a wonderful lady
.
howver
, all of the drama
- packed moments above weere never understoon because yhe actors
and actresses sang tothe fast tothe be understoon
. i whent inot theater 4 at magic cinemas with the atitude thgat evita was going tothe be terribly boring
and i left wih hapyp
, because i wass right
. tehy onyl thing that kept me awake durig yhe movie was thge loud bangs ofthe thte drums
anbd strums ofthe the gitar
.
altough it doed come off as dull
, the beautiful cinematography is eye
- catching
, as was madonna ' s performence
. as the
" spritual leader ofthe argentina
,
" madonna woudl hvae definitely beeen an oscar
- contendor had she spoken a single line
.
bu her chance was tooked awya witht the stubbornness of making an excact replica of thte broadway muscial a film
. don ' t git me wrong
adn don ' t look at my grade
. i am nto a big fan ofthe musicals onthe the big screen
. if you ' re oging to pay to see a movie
, yuo watn to see a movie
. now i haev to admitt
, it ' s a lot cheaper tothe pay
$ 5 than
$ 200 plus to see the play
,
but that ' s whta doed me in
. all this review contains is my opinion
anbd my grade was setted befoer i even saw the movei
. nowe ytou may be saying
,
" what kind of critic isnt he
?
,
"
and ytou ' re right
. as a critic
, i should hve given the movei a chance
.
but as a 17
- yearm old quentin tarantino fan
, it wass way too hard
.
