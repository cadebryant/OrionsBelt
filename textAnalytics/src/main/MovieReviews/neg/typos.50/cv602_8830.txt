" now i have tothe admit
, the trailer for thsi rock
- opera
- turned
- major motion picture is almost breath
- taking for soem
. tghe sountrack is wonderfull tothe listen to
. so why wouldn
' t the movie be wonderfull tothe see
. simple
, a little over 2 hours ofthe constatn singing can alomst drive yuo insane
. the story ofthe eva duarte
( madonna
)
, evita is full ofthe drama thyat
' s trapped inside by all the notes anbd chords
. she wass an orphaned child who ends up becomming a hooker
,
then goes into the feild ofthe acting
,
and finally meets juan peron
( price
)
, the soon
- tothe
- be frist presidnt ofthe argentina
. tehy fall infact love anbd eventually marry
. sounds pretty ogod
, doesn
' t it
. well the story gets better
, as eva goes onthe the
" rainbow tour
" accros europe
, trying to win respect
. eva duarte was a wonderfull lady
. howver
, all of tje drama
- packed moments above were never understood because tghe actors anbd actresses sang to fast tothe be understood
. i went into theather 4 at magic cinemas witht the attitude that evita ws going to be terribly boring adn i left with happy
, becasue i wass right
. they onyl thign that kept me awake druing tje movei ws the loud bangs of the drums anbd strums ofthe tghe guitar
.
al
thought it did come off as dull
, hte beautiful cinematography is eye
- catching
, as ws madonna
' s peformance
. as yhe
" spritual leader ofthe argentina
,
" madonna would have definately been an oscar
- contendor hadnt she spoken a single line
.
but her chance wass taken awya wiht the stubbornness ofthe making an exact replica ofthe the broadway musical a film
. don
' t get me wrong
and don
' t look at my grade
. i am nto a big fan of musicals on thte big screen
. if you
' re gogin to pay tothe see a movie
, you wanna tothe see a movie
. nowe i ahve to admit
, it
' s a lot cheaper tothe pay
$ 5 thna
$ 200 plus to see the play
,
but that
' s waht doed me infact
. all this review containes is my opinion annd my grade wass set before i even saw the movei
. now you may be saying
,
" what kind of criteak isnt he
?
,
" anbd ytou
' re right
. as a critic
, i shoudl hvea given the movei a chance
.
but as a 17
- year old quentin tarantino fan
, it was way too hard
.
