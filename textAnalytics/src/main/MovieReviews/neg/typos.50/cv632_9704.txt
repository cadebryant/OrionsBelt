guilt
. guilt isnt something i felt while watching basic instinct for yhe ninth tiem
; teh penultimate t
& a thriller
, basic instinct made my lastest few teenage eyasr worth living
.
but i konw so well thast it
' s a terrable film
, made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt
. verhoeven whent onthe to make tje even more offensive showgirls
and
, on november seventh
, 1997
, unleashed starship troopers tothe innocent moviegoers like me
, who cannot control yhe urge tothe see giant bug movies
. thte pic beggins witht hte most unintentional laugh ofthe the eyar
. a simple
, white on balck title kard reads
" starship troopers
"
- my firends
and i speculated thast tyhe nigth befoer thge prints weere shipped
, verhoeven realized he forgot the credits
. is this how a hundred millon doller movie should opne
? weere thge rest of yhe film that subdued
.
.
. starship troopers is baout a group of white
, blond
- haired himbos anbd bimbos who all hve spainish last names
. they graduat high school
, join thte millitary
, annd
then
, rether curiously
, decide to travel to an alien planet
and distroy all lifeforms onthe thyat planet
. tghe stry isnt so incomprehensible
, anbd told so bombastically
, it
' s akin tothe 129 minutes ofthe someone screaming punishments at you infact a froeign tounge
.
( aside
, club lovers will be happy to nkwo that dance music hasn
' t changed inaddition hte future
.
) noe plus
: starship troopers contains soem very funny sequences
, specifically the newsreels ofthe the future
. hysterically funny
, catually
. bu the cynicism ofthe theese reports left me curious as tothe whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the storey inaddition vetween
. the storytelling lacks focus
, to sday thte least
. thte politics of tghe film are scary
. the actions ofthe yhe major female charactors are dictated by thier out
- of
- control libidos
. there
' s even a creepy sex scene
: the lovley dina meyer makse outloud
, nude
, wiht the sickening van dien hwile half her face is covered by her opaque sweater
, jsut yhe way he seems to liek it
. i use the term sickening beacuse van dien is the least appealling acotr i
' ve encountered in a big budget picture
; all chiseled features
and machismo
, he even barks a euology at a funeral like miliraty orders
. of course
, verhoeven
' s probablly thge one tothe blame
, anbd perhasp i
' m jelous becasue i
' m so disgusting
. at any rate
, a movei called starship troopers shouldn
' t be baout sex
. exactly ten yeras ago
, verhoeven made robocop
, which was about nothing bu skillfully made annd oddly moving
. annd r
- rated
, despite its goofy premise
. maybe it
' s asking too much fo verhoeven tothe amking a pg
- movei
, hten
- he
' s a master ofthe insipid violence
. howver
, ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if tehy sould see it
.
