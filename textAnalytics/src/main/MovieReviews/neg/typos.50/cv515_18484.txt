when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villin
, you konw thyat yuo cin expect nothing omre than a b grade acation movie
.
however
, since thsi film also featured michael madsen
, mroe than capible character ctor
, this time in teh role ofthe protagonist
, the author of this review desided to give tyhe film some benefit of tghe doubt
.
howver
, tjhe very first scenes show clear b grade acation credentials
- madsen plays richard montnana
, tough policeman who radis a drug warehouse
and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio
( played by lynch
)
.
howver
, tjhe rayda wass onyl parshally sucessfull
,
anbd montnana isnt getting tyhe rap
. so
, he beigns his pwn private war agianst gio
, trying tothe penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt
. inthe the process
, he meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora
( plyed by rosie vela
)
and starts relationship with her too
.
although it doesn ' t stink like many of thge similar films can
, inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade acation routine
. nobody in this film actually puts much affort
, incuding madsen or lynch
,
and thsi is expecially case wih uninspired screenwrighter william tannen or directer warren clarke
. tghe onyl not so forgettable element in this film isnt presense ofthe former supermodel rosie vela
, who
, appart fomr showing her more than impressive looks
, shows smoe ofthe hte singing talent too
.
however
, this isn ' t reason enough forthe viewers tothe spend hour
adn half watching a film taht they would
, infact most likelyhood
, foreget the next day
