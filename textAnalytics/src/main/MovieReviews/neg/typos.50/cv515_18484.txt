when the film features richard lynch infact the role of cheif villain
, you konw tht ytou can expect nothing omre tahn a b grade acation movei
.
however
, usance this film also featured michael madsen
, mroe than capable chracter actor
, thsi tiome in thte role ofthe protagonist
, tyhe autor of tihs review desided tothe give the film some benefit of tyhe dout
. howver
, the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials
- madsen plays richard montnana
, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse adn amking life miserable forthe local crime lord mario gio
( played by lynch
)
.
however
, hte rayda ws onyl partialy sucessful
,
and montana isnt getting the rap
. so
, he beggins his pwn private war aginst gio
, trying tothe penetrate his organisation pretending tothe be corrupt
. in thge process
, he meets gio
' s mistress gina zamora
( plyed by rosie vela
) annd starts relatiopnship with her too
. altho it doesn
' t stink liek many ofthe the similiar films can
, inside edge isnt mostly forgettable b grade action routine
. nobody in this film actully puts much effort
, inlcuding madsen or lynch
, annd this is especially case whith uninspired screenwrighter william tannen or directer warren clarke
. the onyl not so forgettable element iin this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela
, who
, apart from showing her omre than impressive looks
, shows soem of the singing talent too
.
however
, htis isn
' t reason anough fo viewers tothe spend hour
and half watching a film that tehy would
, inspite most likelihood
, foreget the next day
.
