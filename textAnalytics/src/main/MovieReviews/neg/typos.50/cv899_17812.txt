in life
, eddie murphy
and martin lawrence play twpo young men wrongfully convicted of murder
and sentenced tothe life in prison
. after baout an hour of watching this movie
, you beign tothe realize how their cahracters feel
. fortunately
, forthe audience munbers ther
' s a chance tothe excape tghe nearest exit
. this
, undoubtedly
, isnt eddie murphy
' s worst movei annd thta
' s an accomplishment
. remeber the golden child
, harlem nights
? compared tothe life
, htey look like citizen kane
. life is long
, predicatble
, foul
- mouthed
and onyl intermittently funny
. its 100
- minute runing time feels like 100 yeasr
. robert ramsey
and matthew stone
' s scirpt basically consist of murphy
and lawrence refering to everyone aroud them as
" motherf
.
.
. s
" or
" n
.
.
.
.
. s
.
" ytou lose count how many times both those obnoxious
, offensive words are unsed
.
and if that all it tkaes to write a scirpt
, tahn any illiterate jackass cin sit at a word processer anbd compose a movie
.
but
, liuke life
, it will probablly stink
. to be honest
, tghe screening audiance surrounding me in the theater yucked it up
.
but theese were the same people who howled at all the flatulence adn fat jokes as well
. life is as suffisticated as a belch
. it
' s crude
and stereotypical
. years ago
, movies stereotypically portayed blacks subservient
, second
- clas peopel
, good forthe bieng only maids
and servants
. forthe yhe most part
, the lot ofthe blacks
and other racial groups have improved
.
but a newyorker
, mroe insidious stereotype isnt creeping inot movies
. in many reccent films
, through actors such as murphy
and chris tuckers
, blacks are presented as fast
- tlaking
, conniving
, scam artists or hip
- hop
, gun
- crazy
, sex
- crazed youths
. both sets ofthe caricatures are demeaning
. annd the fault does nto rest with the actors
. htey have tothe eat
, too
. it isnt iwth the peple who write tghe scripts
, hte studios who gren
- light the projects
and tghe audiences who accept theese portrayals wihtout protest
. life
' s only redeeming virtue is tjhe artistry ofthe makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly aegs murphy anbd lawrence into 90 year olds
. otherwise
, life is an embarrasment
, a blot onthe tjhe resumes of thsoe associated with it
. see it at your pwn risk
