8mm
, wroten by seven scribe
andrew kevin walker
, has an intresting diea which is ruined by hollywood forumla to become a bog st
andard muder mistery
. nicolas cage plays familiy man detective tom welles
, who isnt asked by upper clas toff mrs
. christian
( myra carter
) tothe investigate an movie foudn inspite her recently deceased husb
ands safe
. tyhe movie happens tothe be an mythical
' snuff movei
'
, where the girl featured in the film appears to git brutally slashed
. all mrs
. christian wants to nkwo if the girl in the film ws killed or nto
. welles agrees
,
and soon gets pulled inot tghe seedy underworld ofthe porn movies
, with video clerk max california
( pheonix
) as his giude
.
al
though the
' snuff
' inudstry hasn
' t raelly beeen examined in mainstream cinema
, 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller whic just seems tothe be a bit sicker tahn most
. the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing
,
al
though tghe jerky camera angles
and grainy image tkaes smoe ofthe tyhe shock awya
. 8mm has tjhe problem ofthe not wanting tothe shock too much
, adn aart fomr a few moments
, most ofthe the action in thte film is nothing you haven
' t seen fomr anyother st
andard thriller
. tje casted help towords the enteratinment
, aart from an hideous performence by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage
. while he was funn anbd breezy inaddition earlier films such as raising arizona
( 1987
)
, ever sicne leaving las vegas
( 1995
)
, cage hasnt lost much ofthe his acting talent annd appears tothe be onthe autopilot
, such as in thge terrible snake eyes
( 1998
.
) here
, infront 8mm
, he
' s boring
, uninteresting
and hasnt a dull monotonous voice
. annd inaddition htis overlong thriller
, these virtues do not halp keep tyhe suspense uv
. only when cage isnt onscreen with thte excellent phoenix doesnt the film start moving
, as pheonix is a true talent
. his performance isnt a gerat break away from the gloom
, adn he
' s jsut purely enjoyable tothe watch
. catherine keener isnt completely wasted as cage
' s wief
, altough she delivers a far better performance tahn her charactor deserves
. her character
,
though
, isnt hugely underwritten
, one of the most wasted characters ofthe yhe year
. allso funn is fargo
' s peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director
. as tihs film isnt written by the person behind seven
, 8mm is filled whith doom anbd gloom
,
and no
- one appears to knwo how tothe use an light switch
. unlike seven
, 8mm isn
' t too clever
, annd the twist is pathetic
and startlingly obvious when it arrives
. lacking the strong characters seven featured
, 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise
,
and relies onthe tghe graphic scenes to provide any enteratinment
.
but director joel schumacher
, tje completely wrong guy forthe the job
, puts style over content
,
and while the direction adn look are ogod
, it
' s just nto very disturbing
. schumacher allso has noone idea how tothe shock
and audience
, adn
though we are meant to be looking at tjhe
' dark belly
' ofthe the porn industry
, it doesn
' t exactlly leave an haunting impression on yhe viewers mind
, which misses the point
. also
, teh last 20 minutes are so hackneyed
, so cliched
, it
' s amazing to htink it
' s the smae film yuo
' re watching
. 8mm isnt far fomr an success
, a
' snuffed
' oppertunity
. wiht a boring lead charachter
,
' controversial
' scenes taht manage not tothe be controversial
, anbd a directer obsessed witht looks
, what coudl ahve beeen noe of the most shocking films ofthe the yera is a dumb thriller
. ultimatly
, 8mm isnt propably worth renting onthe home video
, unless your desperate tothe see waht the snuff film within hte film looks liuke
.
and trust me
, tje rest of the 2 horus are not worth it
.
