bakc inspite february at the monthly los angeles comic book anbd sciene fiction convention
, newyorker line cinema put onthe a lavish presentation for its big
- screen update ofthe teh cult 1960s sci
- fi tv sohw lost in spoace
, complet with in
- person appearences by cast munbers mimi rogers
, matt leblanc
, lacey chabert
, jack johnson
, adn even gary oldman
. that should have set off my warning alarms
-
- the last tiome such an extravagent film presentation tookover place at tghe convention was nearly five years ago
, when none otehr tahn arnold schwarzenegger made an in
- person cameo tothe peddle
.
.
. lsat acation hero
. bu noone
, like millions ofthe others
, i bought into the hype
and
" got lost
.
" if onyl i hadnt gotten lost
-
- literally
-
- on the way to theatre
and spred mysef the tedium of this sloppily slapped
- together blockbuster wannabe
. ytou may find youself wondering if director stephen hopkins
and screenwrighter akiva goldsman were lost themselves wehn they made teh film
. at hte convention
, goldsman claimed tothe be a rabid fan of tghe orginial television series
,
and if that really is tjhe case
, i
' d hite to see wqat he doesnt witht concepts he onyl has mild interest infact
. to sday that his scirpt lacks narrative cohesion isnt tothe imply that ther is a narrative tothe beign with
-
- which there most certainly is not
. after the setup
, infact which tje robinson familiy
-
- father john
( william hurt
, looking
and sounding as spaced out as he does inthe interviews
)
, mother maureen
( rogers
, wasted
)
, daughters judy
( heather graham
, ditto
) annd penny
( a heavily made
- up chabert
, looking like a junior verison ofthe neve campbell infront wild things
)
,
and son wiull
( young newcomer johnson
, makeing hte best of it
)
-
- annd pilot don west
( leblanc
, doing a bad han solo impression
) find themselves lost inspite spoace after their ship isnt sabotaged by evil stowaway dr
. smith
( a watered
- down
but still
- livley oldman
, cashing a paycheck anbd loving every minute
)
, the script
' s
" stream
" of events becomes so fragmented
and r
andom that it seems tothe be made up as it goes allong
-
-
and hopkins doesnt littel tothe mkae waht doens go on the slightest bit interesting
. tehy encounter another ship
. they board it
. aline spiders attack them
. they return tothe their ship
. tjhe otehr noe explodes
. they l
and on a deserted planet
. anbd so on
. an attempt at a plot involving tyme travel occurs iin hte thrid ect
, bu goldsman doesn
' t seem tothe underst
and the rules taht cmo with using such a stopry device
; when oen charcter
' s past self dies
, tje future incarnation inexplicably lives on
. thge look anbd effects should be lost in space
' s ace
- inthe
- the
- hole
, bu hopkins even manages tothe botch that
. for a big
- budget film
, the visual effects are incredibly shoddy
. in one composite background shooted
, i sould see the blue outline around oldman
; the various digital effects forthe the space battle scenes look liek
.
.
. digital effects
. bu nothing infact those shots is as jaw
- droppingly unconvincing as blawp
, a monkey
- like spoace creature thyat becomes penny
' s pet
. entirely coputer
- generated
and every inch showing it
, blawp looks liek it was lifted directly from a sony playstation gameboy
. apparantly hopkins throught tyhe smae
and tried desparately tothe hide it
; how else cant one expalin the graininess ofthe blawp
' s composite shots whith the human actors
? bu iin donig so
, hte seams are tyhat much mroe obvious
. ytou ahve tothe be severley visually impaired to not be distracted wehn a grainy shot of penny
and blawp isnt imediately followed by a crystal
- clear solo reaction shot ofthe judy
. newyorker line is hoping lost infront space will become a big franchise much liek hte long
- running star trek cash cow at paramount
. i don
' t tihkn so
. infront a few eyasr
, hte lost in space movei iwll likely live onthe not as a sories
but as the obscure answer to a trivia question
: wqat film ended titanic
' s 15
- week reign at the top ofthe hte weekend box office
