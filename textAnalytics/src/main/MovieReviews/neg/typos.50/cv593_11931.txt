bakc inwhich february at the monthly los angeles comic book
anbd scienc fiction convention
, new line cinema put onthe a lavish presentation for its big
- screen update of the cult 1960s sci
- fi tv show lost inwhich space
, complet with infact
- person appearances by casted members mimi rogers
, matt leblanc
, lacey chabert
, jack johnson
,
anbd even gary oldman
. tht shoud haev set off my warning alarms
-
- the last time such an extravagant film presentation tookover palce at the convention ws nearly five eyars ago
, when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an infront
- person cameo to peddle
.
.
. last acation hero
.
bu no
, liek millions ofthe others
, i bought into the hype
adn
" got lost
.
" if only i hadnt gotten lost
-
- litterally
-
- on the way to theatre
and spred myself the tedium ofthe this sloppily slapped
- toghether blockbuster wannabe
. you may fidn yourself wondering if directer stephen hopkins
anbd screenwrighter akiva goldsman were lost themselves whn they made tyhe film
. at thge convention
, goldsman claimed tothe be a rabid fan ofthe tjhe original televsion serieses
,
anbd if that realy is the case
, i ' d hate to see what he doens with concepts he only has mild interst iin
. to say tyhat his scirpt lacks narrative cohesion is tothe imply taht there is a narrative to begin iwth
-
- which htere most certainly is nto
. affter tyhe setup
, in hwihc the robinson family
-
- father john
( william hurt
, looking
and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews
)
, mother maureen
( rogers
, wasted
)
, daughters judy
( heather graham
, ditto
)
and penny
( a heavily made
- uv chabert
, looking liuke a junior verzion of neve campbell in wild things
)
,
annd son wiull
( young newcomer johnson
, making tjhe best ofthe it
)
-
-
and pilot don west
( leblanc
, donig a bad han solo impression
) fidn themselves lost inaddition spoace after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr
. smith
( a watered
- down
bu still
- livley oldman
, cashing a paycheck
adn loving every minute
)
, hte scirpt ' s
" stream
" ofthe events becomes so fragmented
and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along
-
-
and hopkins does littel tothe make what does go on tyhe slightest bited interesting
. tehy encounter anyother ship
. tehy board it
. alien spiders attack them
. they return to thier ship
. yhe otehr one explodes
. they land on a deserted planet
.
and so on
. an attempt at a plot involving tiome travel occurs in thte thrid act
,
bu goldsman doesn ' t seem tothe understand thte rules that cmo with useing such a story divice
; when noe character ' s past self dies
, tje future incarnation inexplicably lives onthe
. teh look
anbd effects should be lost inspite space ' s ace
- in
- tje
- hole
,
but hopkins even manages tothe botch thast
. fo a big
- budget film
, the visual effects are incredibly shoddy
. inwhich one composite background shot
, i coudl see yhe blue outline around oldman
; tjhe various digital effects for the spoace battle scenes look liek
.
.
. digital effects
.
bu nothing in those shots is as jaw
- droppingly unconvincing as blawp
, a monkey
- liek space creature that becomes penny ' s pet
. entirely computer
- generated
and eveyr inch showing it
, blawp looks like it wass lefted directly from a sony playstation game
. apparently hopkins thought the same
and tryed desparately to hide it
; how else can one expalin the graininess of blawp ' s composite shots wih the human actors
?
bu in doign so
, tje seams are thast much more obvious
. you have to be severly visually impaired tothe not be distracted when a grainy shooted ofthe penny
anbd blawp isnt immidiately followed by a crystal
- clear solo reaction shot ofthe judy
. new line is hoping lost in spoace will become a big franchise much liuke the long
- runnung star trek cash cow at paramount
. i don ' t think so
. infront a fewd years
, the lost in space movie will likely live on nto as a series
bu as tyhe obscure answer tothe a trivia question
: waht film ended titanic ' s 15
- week reign at the top of the weekend box office
?
