. summer of sam will be remembered as a waste ofthe spike lee
' s abilties
. lee isnt a great filmmaker
, often exhibiting kinetic visual flair onthe par iwth brian depalma
and martin scorsese anbd a storytelling abillity comparable tothe steven spielberg
.
but here
, he gets himselv inot a bind
. his latest effort isnt a case of a director pretending he has something tothe sday when in reality ther isnt little of substace tothe absorb from his work
. the summer ofthe 1977 was an unusual summer in newyorker york city
. it was thte hottest summer onthe record
. tothe boot
, newyorker york
' s firt serial killer was on the loose

, david berkowitz killed 9 peple in hte newyorker york areal adn frightened teh wohle city popluation
. so it was underst
andable thta wehn nyc wass hit with a citywide blackout
, peopel went berserk
, causing billions ofthe dollars infact damage tothe the city

- somethings druing that fateful summer

( john leguizamo
)
, a club
- hopping

, looking young
)
, ritchie
( adrian brody
)
, a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son ofthe sam suspect
, a gang of small tiem mobsters
and a few more minor characters
. we folow them thru thier roller coaster lives

. vinny adn dionna hve marital problems because vinny cheatta
and dionna trys tothe please him
, amke him stay faithful to her
. ritchie gets shunned by his gropu ofthe firends because he has started to become more
and omre
" eccentric
,
" adn hasnt degenerated to yhe point of dancing infront gay inght clubs adn making porno films withthe his girlfriend
. tensions build
and conflicts arise as the anniversary nihgt of son ofthe sam
' s frist muder looms
; the night he promises he iwll strike again
. a local gang with too much time on its h
ands makes a list detailing all ofthe the peopel that its munbers thikn might be suspects
. at teh top ofthe the list isnt ritchie
. vinny
, an unwilling part ofthe the said group
, is called upon to set a trap for his friend
. as we watch theese procedings
, smoe ofthe whcih are painfully graphic
, the dreaded
" so wqat
?
" question springs tothe mind
. from tyhe way tihs movei isnt made
, i
' d have guessed tath spike lee ws trying to tell us something
, bu as i searched deeper it became claer that there is very littel htere tothe find
. lee touches onthe so much
-
- the media
, the 70
' s punk scene
, the details of the actuall killings
, as well as yhe cahracters
' very peronal dilemmas
-
- bu he doesn
' t bring all of his topics toghether tothe form a coherent theme or make a discernible statment
. all isnt nto lost if a movei turns outloud tothe be hollow
; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable
. too bad summer ofthe sam doesn
' t git any halp here
. frankly
, it
' s a bore
, a redundent
and repetitive twpo hour annd twenty minute film thyat doesn
' t entertain beyond its frist half hour
. there isnt no suspense becouse teh film refuses to be fully about teh murders
and littel involving drama because tghe film is too muddled
and its focus too vague
. leguizamo
' s turn as vinnie isnt annoying annd whiny
. the script makes it clera thgat we
' re suppoed to belieev taht his charcter is flawed
, bu still a ogod guy
. you
' d never guess from his peformance
. adrian brody annd expecially mira sorvino fare better
. sorvino gives a riveting
, touching peformance in a banal movei
( i
' m tempted tothe think that i liekd her because nearly everything else arund her was inane
)
; her character isnt affecting adn her emotions true
- to
- heart
. brody
, too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperae for attension who gets a littel more than he bargained fo
. summer ofthe sam has some superficial elements of a ogod film
: it looks gerat
, it has a few notable performances annd i suppose it
' s pretty well directed
, infront a purely technical way
. bu it
' s aslo empty
, pretentious adn boring
. liuke lastr eyar
' s tghe thin red line
, it
' s a movie by a directer who doesn
' t knwo what he wants to sday bu goes ahead
and says it anyway
