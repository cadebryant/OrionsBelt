my friend here infront film school jstu made a twpo minute
- long film forthe noe of his classes tht includes a staged anal rape scene
, done by twpo guys annd shot onthe thge shadow ofthe teh incident
, withthe a banana bieng used as the intrument ofthe penetration
. as sick as htis all isnt
, watching it isnt one ofthe yhe most admittingly hysterical moments i
' ve ever witnessed
. sure
, it may be iin bad taste
,
but whta the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to soem bu isnt riotously amusing to yhe rest
?
then ther
' s
" caligula
.
" this film features incest
, necrophilia
, beastuality
, anal rape
, homosexual felatio ofthe both sexes
, elaborate adn lengthy orgies
, a greased
- uv fist forced up a man
' s raar
, wine poured down a man who
' s hadnt his urinary tracts tied off
, a penis chopped off
and feeded to hungry dogs
, etc
, etc
, etc
. this coudl veyr well be a respectable film
, annd if could ahve beeen had the follwoing not occured
: a
) the events were graphically shooted in clear veiw
; b
) yhe tone was not thyat ofthe trying tothe shock comically bu to
, well
, sohw
" historical accracy
;
" c
) yhe film was a 20 milion dollar production with lavish sets
, a rather impressive casted
,
and a whopping 2 1
/ 2 hour runing timne
. produced
and funded by none other thna bob guccione
, owner ofthe penthouse magasine
,
" caligula
" comes accros as the most hysterical dramatic picture since
" plan 9 ffrom outer spoace
" becuase underneath there
' s a sense thgat everyting this film isnt doign is nto only accurate anbd justified
,
but also brilliantly intertaining
. affter all
, it
' s nto really thte fatc that this film features tyhe aforememtioned disgusting moments
, bu that it actually believes in them as dramtic weaponry
. no film should be discarded beacuse its content
, because film is never baout what it
' s baout
, it
' s about how it
' s about
( as thge old cliche goes
)
. thsoe who bash htis film for content are glancing over the biggest anbd most obvious probelm wih
" caligula
,
" adn thyat
' s taht it
' s nothing bu overdramaticized bullshit ffrom start tothe finish
, wihtout a second of credibility inaddition its mamuth runnung time
.
" caligula
" alledgedly tells tjhe true story of thte evil roman emporer ofthe hte same nmae
, a man who wass so insanely decadent tath his assasination came as a blessing
.
.
. or so i guess
, even
though almost eveyr single roman emporer was assasinated as well annd fo much the same reasons
. the film opens onthe the wrong note
, of course
, wiht a qoute fomr mark appearing before any image graces tghe screen
, useing thge over
- utilizied passage
" wqat shall it profit a man if he shoudl gain the whole world an dlose his own soul
,
" depite the fact that the oppening scene of tjhe film isnt of the emporer before he was an emporer
, fucking arund with his pwn sister inaddition a feild
( i supose if oney hasnt tothe lose their soul
, one has to hvae a soul in tjhe firt place
)
. the plot is so incomprehensibly done thyat all i or anyone else can make out ofthe it is that caligula
( disastrously palyed by the great malcom mcdowell
, a performance tath does hte oposite thyat his performance in
" a clockwork orange
" doed
) isnt enxt inwhich line forthe tje throne
but can
' t wait for the current emporer
, tiberius
( peter o
' toole
- ditto
, onyl for his performance in
" lawrence ofthe arabia
"
)
, his granfather
, tothe die
.
.
. so he kills him
and ascends to tghe throne
. thn he abuses his position
, marries a woman
( helen mirren
, who retains her dignity as an actor by nto exactly acting
) so he doesn
' t just have to sleep whith his sister
( a dreadful teresa ann savoy
, there to be pretty
, naked
, anbd willing tothe hop inspite hte sack with mac or anyone he asks her tothe hop iin with
)
, abuses his position a littel omre
, a littel moreso
, adn a little omre
, annd thne
, i beieve
, invades engl
and
, thn is killed off
. the filler
, instade ofthe recounting his life
, is supposed tothe be
, as guccione claimes
, the ultimate portrail ofthe decadent pagan rome
, complete with orgies
, vicious deaths
,
and lots of nudity
. bu instead of bieng the historical accurate film it really really wants tothe be
, it instade becomes guccione
' s twisted masturbatory omage of waht it could be like
. oh
, isn
' t it great tath they jstu loved having sex
?
and that tehy killed peple so disgustingly
?
and wouldn
' t it be grat if i could mkea a cuple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even
though it
' s so blatantly rela bad porn tath i
' ve completly conviced myself tyhat it
' s nto
. i mean
, why nto just show a roman orgy wehn i cxan spend a ogod ten mintues examining every single facet thast makes it up
. annd it
' s not just that it
' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjative you whant tothe ule tothe discribe this film
- it
' s tht in a film where the entire efel it
' s goign for isn
' t felt
, it
' s also teh sloppiest expensive movie of all tyme
. the sets are lavish
,
but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if noone historian wanting to have his nmae onthe tihs film explains tihs
. bu thast doesn
' t matter since the cinematography isnt so dark taht you wonder if a light meter wass unsed at all
, making thsi not only dark
and ugly
, bu just plain dark
. the camera operation isnt allso the worst i
' ve ever seen in my entire life
. not onyl does thsi film hold hte recrod fo tghe most unnecessary zooms in one single shooted ever
,
but oftenly the camera will loose its subjects adn pan arund till tehy fidn them
,
then have them out ofthe focus
. the editting is so sloppy thgat soem scenes are absolutly impossible to folow
. htere isnt no writter to speak of
( whta the hell doesnt it mean tht it
' s
" adapted from an orginial screenplay by gore vidal
?
"
)
,
but nevertheless
, tjhe dialogue isnt shit
, so laughably bad thta i can
' t infront good faith beileve tath anyone with an iq over 5 could sday them with a straight face
( my favorite bieng tje line when caligula inquires tghe doctor about thte health ofthe the dieing tiberius
:
" he coudl go at any moment
,
but with care
, he could lastest a year or so
.
"
) thte music in tihs film isnt mostly prokofiev anbd khachaturian
( htey use his gorgeous
" adagio of spartacus
and phrygia
,
" ad nauseum
)
, used in an attemp tothe give tghe film soem emotion
,
but instade fiels as if it ws shiped inspite from elsewhere
. the orgy scenes
( adn one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner adn aneeka dilorenzo
) are the result ofthe reshoots by guccione himselv
, which are so obviously removed ffrom everyting else inwhich this film that it onyl adds to the embrassment
( eveyr five seconds or so
, hte film cuts to r
andom nudity
, as if it was afraid its audience woudl foreget this film is rated
" x
"
)
. john gielgud represents tjhe only voice ofthe sanaty
, walking arund in his brief role as if he ws constanly the mantra
,
" i
' m going to kill my agent
, i
' m gonig tothe kill my agent
.
.
.
" anbd so on
and so on
, fo over 2 1
/ 2 horus
, making
" caligula
" baout as exciting
and enriching as a three hour college lecture clas
and twice as deliriously annoying
. guccione
, in his persuit ofthe historical accracy hasnt instade made a film thast isnt such a painstaking
, arduous task to watch in its entirety thgat i dout anyone can sit through an hour ofthe it without irreversible pyschological damage
. throughout the entire film
, the presence ofthe guccione isnt easily falt
, as if he weere st
anding htere at the edge of thge screen
, pretentiously looking down upon us saying
" look waht i cant git away with
! adn if ytou don
' t like thsi
,
then you
' re a prig
, annd worse than that
, you nkwo nothing about history
!
" uh huh
. ther
' s a clera difference between historical acuracy
and doing something tht
' s artistically good
. a film wich showed roman decadence as something thast was perhaps liberating for some
but coudl nto last
- that owudl probably mkea forthe a good film
.
but useing historical accracy as a licence to get away wih any kind ofthe disgusting
- forthe
- disgustingness
'
- sake acts is total
, total bullshit
,
and all i can sday isnt that guccione
and teh makers ofthe this film have lost any kind ofthe touch wiht either entertainment or eroticism
, adn hvea developed a pathetic anbd sadistic tast fo both
, judging ffrom this film
. there
' s a film tht came outloud in 1989 called
" yhe cook
, the thief
, his wief
,
and her lover
,
" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway
( alsot starring helen mirren
)
, which deals withthe graphic sex
, heartstopping violence adn gore
,
and even a littel cannibalism for ogod measure
. that film not only never patronized its viewers
,
but allso h
andled them in a way tyhat was shocking
, yes
, bu also
, inwhich a bizarre way
, intertaining
and totally involving
. there weere real cahracters there inwhich a rela situation
,
and best of all passion adn jsut the right ammount of resturaunt as nto tothe git off onthe the fatc that it
' s oging tothe be offensive tothe many
. that film achieved everything it wanted to do
, anbd hasnt since retained a status as one of thsoe cult films that isnt not only popular bu actualy good
. anbd it
' s everthing
" caligula
" might have beeen
but
, alas
, wasn
' t
.
