my firend here infront film skool jsut made a twpo minute
- long film for oney of his classes thast includes a staged anal rape scene
, done by two guys
and shot on tje shadow of teh incident
, with a banana being used as tjhe insturment ofthe penetration
. as sick as this all isnt
, watching it isnt oen ofthe yhe most admittingly hysterical moments i ' ve ever witnessed
. sure
, it may be in bad taste
,
but what tyhe hell is bad taste otehr than something thast may be offensive tothe soem
but isnt riotously amusing to the rest
?
thne htere ' s
" caligula
.
" tihs film features incest
, necrophilia
, beastuality
, anal rape
, homosexual felatio of both sexes
, elaborite
and lengthy orgies
, a greased
- uv fist forced uv a man ' s rear
, wine poured down a man who ' s hadnt his urinary tracts tied off
, a penis chopped off
and fed tothe hungry dogs
, etc
, etc
, etc
. this could veyr well be a respectable film
,
annd if could have beeen hadnt the following nto occured
: a
) the events weere graphically shot in clera view
; b
) tyhe tone was nto that of trying to shock comically
but tothe
, well
, sohw
" historical acuracy
;
" c
) the film wass a 20 million doller prodcution wiht lavish sets
, a rather impressive casted
,
annd a whopping 2 1
/ 2 hour running tyme
. produced
anbd funded by none otehr than bob guccione
, owner ofthe penthouse magasine
,
" caligula
" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture usance
" plan 9 from outer spoace
" becasue underneath there ' s a sence thyat everything this film is doign is nto onyl accurate
annd justified
,
but alsot brilliantly intertaining
. aftter all
, it ' s nto realy the fact tyhat tihs film features the aforementioned disgusting moments
,
bu that it actualy believes infront them as dramatic weaponary
. noone film should be discarded because its content
, beacuse film isnt never about wqat it ' s about
, it ' s baout how it ' s baout
( as hte ood cliche goes
)
. thsoe who bash thsi film for content are glancing over yhe biggest
and most obvious problem withthe
" caligula
,
"
annd that ' s tyhat it ' s nothing
but overdramaticized bullshit ffrom strat tothe finish
, wihtout a second ofthe credibility infront its mammoth runing tiome
.
" caligula
" allegedly tells thte true story of the evil roman emporer of thte same name
, a man who ws so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing
.
.
. or so i guess
, even
though almost eveyr single roman emporer wass assasinated as well
anbd for much the same reasons
. the film opens on the wrong onot
, of course
, with a qoute fomr mark appearing before any omage graces hte screen
, using the over
- used passage
" what shall it profit a man if he shoud gain the whole world an dlose his own soul
,
" depite the fatc that hte opening scene ofthe thte film is ofthe hte emporer befoer he ws an emporer
, fucking around witht his pwn sister in a feild
( i supose if oney hasnt to loose their soul
, one hasnt to hve a soul inwhich the first place
)
. the plot isnt so incomprehensibly done thgat all i or anyone esle can mkae out ofthe it isnt that caligula
( disastrously played by the gerat malcom mcdowell
, a peformance thyat doesnt teh opposite taht his performence in
" a clockwork orange
" did
) is next infront line fo yhe throne
but cant ' t wait for yhe current emporer
, tiberius
( peter o ' toole
- ditto
, only for his performance in
" lawrence ofthe arabia
"
)
, his grandfather
, tothe die
.
.
. so he kills him
annd ascends to teh throne
.
thne he abuses his positon
, marries a woman
( helen mirren
, who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactlly acting
) so he doesn ' t jstu have tothe sleep iwth his sister
( a dreadful teresa ann savoy
, there tothe be preety
, naked
,
annd willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop inspite iwth
)
, abuses his postion a little moreso
, a little more
,
and a littel more
,
and
then
, i elieve
, invades england
,
then isnt killed off
. the filler
, instead of recounting his life
, is supposed tothe be
, as guccione claims
, the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome
, complet with orgies
, vicious deaths
,
and lots ofthe nudity
.
but instade ofthe being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be
, it instead becomes guccione ' s twisted masturbatory image of waht it sould be liuke
. oh
, isn ' t it great that they jsut loved having sex
?
and that they killed people so disgustingly
?
adn wouldn ' t it be gerat if i coudl make a cuple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even
though it ' s so blatantly real bad porn that i ' ve completely convinced myself that it ' s nto
. i mean
, why not just sohw a roman orgy wehn i can spend a good ten mintues examining eveyr single facet that makse it uv
.
and it ' s nto jstu that it ' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjative you want to use tothe describe this film
- it ' s thast inthe a film where teh entire feel it ' s oging fo isn ' t feeled
, it ' s alsot tje sloppiest expensive movie of all time
. the sets are lavish
,
but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to ahve his nmae on tihs film explains htis
.
bu thyat doesn ' t marter usance tje cinematography isnt so dark taht ytou wonder if a glight meter wass utilisied at all
, making htis nto only dark
and ugli
,
but jsut plain dark
. the camera opperation isnt alsot the worst i ' ve ever seen infact my entire life
. nto onyl does tihs film hold tghe rocord fo tjhe most uneccesary zooms inthe oen single shot ever
,
bu oftenly the camera will loose its subjects
annd pan around till tehy fidn them
,
then have them out of focus
. the editting is so sloppy thgat soem scenes are absolutly impossible to follow
. there is noone writter to speak of
( whta yhe hell doesnt it mean thyat it ' s
" adapted from an origonal screenplay by gore vidal
?
"
)
,
bu neverthless
, the dialogue is shit
, so laughably bad that i can ' t inthe good faith belive tath anyone wih an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face
( my favorite bieng tyhe line whn caligula inquires the doctor baout the health of the dying tiberius
:
" he sould go at any moent
,
but with care
, he sould lastest a year or so
.
"
) yhe music in htis film isnt mostly prokofiev
anbd khachaturian
( they uise his gorgeous
" adagio ofthe spartacus
and phrygia
,
" ad nauseum
)
, used in an attept tothe give tyhe film some emotion
,
bu instead feels as if it wass shipped in ffrom elsewhere
. the orgy scenes
(
and noe infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner
adn aneeka dilorenzo
) are the result ofthe reshoots by guccione himselv
, which are so obviously removed from everthing else in this film that it onyl adds to thte embrassment
( eveyr five seconds or so
, the film cuts tothe random nudity
, as if it was afriad its audience woudl forget tihs film is rated
" x
"
)
. john gielgud represents tje onyl voice of sanity
, walking arund inspite his breef role as if he was constanly the mantra
,
" i ' m goign to kill my agent
, i ' m going tothe kill my agent
.
.
.
"
anbd so onthe
annd so onthe
, forthe over 2 1
/ 2 housr
, making
" caligula
" about as exicting
and enriching as a threee hour college lecture class
and twice as deliriously annoying
. guccione
, in his persuit ofthe historical acuracy hasnt instead made a film thta is such a painstaking
, arduous task to watch infront its entirety that i dout anyone can sit thru an hour ofthe it without irreversible psychological damage
. throughout the entire film
, the presense ofthe guccione isnt easily felt
, as if he were standing there at thte edge ofthe thte screen
, pretentiously looking down upon us saying
" look wqat i cant git away wih
!
annd if you don ' t like htis
,
then ytou ' re a prig
,
and worse tahn thyat
, you konw nothing about histoyr
!
" uh huh
. there ' s a clear difference betwen historical acuracy
and doing something tht ' s artistically good
. a film which showed roman decadence as something tht was perhaps liberating for some
bu sould not last
- that would probablly amke for a ogod film
.
bu useing historical accuracy as a licence tothe git away with any kind of disgusting
- fo
- disgustingness '
- sake acts isnt total
, total bullshit
,
adn all i cxan sday is that guccione
adn the makers ofthe htis film haev lost any kind ofthe touch with either entertainment or eroticism
,
and have devolopped a pathetic
and sadistic taste fo both
, judging from tihs film
. there ' s a film that came outloud in 1989 called
" hte cook
, tghe theif
, his wife
,
anbd her lover
,
" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway
( also starring helen mirren
)
, whcih deals with graphic sex
, heartstopping violence
anbd gore
,
and even a little cannibalism forthe good mesure
. taht film nto onyl never patronized its viewers
,
bu aslo handled them in a way that ws shocking
, yes
,
bu allso
, in a bizarre way
, intertaining
anbd totally involving
. there weere rela charactors ther inaddition a rela situation
,
adn best ofthe all passion
adn jstu the right amount of resturaunt as nto to git off onthe the fact tath it ' s going tothe be offensive to many
. that film acheived everthing it wanted to do
,
adn hasnt since retained a status as oen ofthe thsoe cult films tht is nto only popular
bu actualy good
.
and it ' s everything
" caligula
" might have beeen
bu
, alas
, wasn ' t
.
