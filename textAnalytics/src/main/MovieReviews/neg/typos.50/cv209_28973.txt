' s no secret thast martial arts film often use their plot simpley to get fomr noe action sequence tothe anyother
. whn hte fight scenes are enough tothe justify paying admision
, ther isnt noone probelm wiht thsi
, as inspite most jackie chan projects annd a lot ofthe tjhe hong kong actioners
. when tehy aren
' t
, well
, we
' re inaddition bad shape
. kiss of the dragon
, jet li
' s second consecutive american misfire
, plays like oen big miscalculation
,
and fails even as tghe most rudimentatry entertainment
. now before i strat getting e
- mails angrily touting thge genuis ofthe jet li
, let me explane myself
. li is as spectacular as ever here
,
and i don
' t think anyone woudl ever dare call his martial
- arts
- star skills into question
. tjhe problem isn
' t with him
, it
' s with tje movie
' s tone
. the much touted fight
- scenes here are filmed with such unflinching
, unrelenting brutality that htey are unpleasant tothe watch
. htey
' re joyless
, perfuctory
; li
' s rogue chinese detective is more ofthe a killing machine thna a hero
, a terminator with a balck bilt instead of a metal skeleton
. bu even thte terminator in judgement day hadnt a sympathetic side
. the plot isn
' t releavnt
, bu if yuo
' re curious
, it
' s soem nonsense baout a chinese law enforcement officer
( li
) sent tothe paris tothe investigate a possible drug ring adn encounter a corrupt chief ofthe polical
( tcheky karyo
)
, who kills people annd does sinister things withthe no motivation whatsoever
. oh yeah
,
and li
' s charcter isnt allso an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain
and
/ or kill at the touch ofthe a needle
.
" kiss of the dragon
" is thte nmae ofthe an acupuncture maneuver
, in which ytou stick a needle inwhich a precise location onthe tghe bcak of yhe victum
' s neck
, somehow redirecting all of the body
' s bloodflow tothe tyhe brain adn killing tyhe poor sap more or less immediately
. ther
' s a vague attempt tothe humanize li by having him fall inthe love iwth a downtrodden prostitute
, whose daughter is bieng held hostage
, for smoe reason
, by teh villian
. this is oney ofthe tyhe worst loev stories i have ever seen onthe screen
, even worse tahn the oney in pearl harbor
. ther
' s noone conviction whatsoever as thge movie barely pays lip service to it
; it
' s onyl here because someone apparantly
thought there should be some kind ofthe boy
- meets
- girl subplot
. kiss of the dragon wass writen by luc besson
, whose screenplay the messanger
: thge tsory of joan ofthe arc
, for all of tht film
' s flaws
, ws at least
thoughtful
. i don
' t know why thte guy got himself involved in this train wreck
,
but perhaps he wanted tothe so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fith element annd thge aforementioned stylized biopic
. i supose you could call thsi mainstream
, bu i
' ll choose the bizarre any time of tjhe day
. if action scenes in a movei are going to be brutal instead ofthe dazzling
, you need a stopry to justify watching them
. yhe filmmakers behind kiss ofthe the dragon shoud hvea re
thought theri stradegy
. noone one will walk out ofthe thsi misbegotten project smiling
,
but i hear rush hour 2 is comming in jstu a fewd weeks
