" snake eyes
" is the most aggravating kind ofthe movei
: tje kind thast shows so much potential hten becomes unbelievably disappointing
. it
' s nto jsut beacuse thsi isnt a brian depalma film
, adn since he
' s a graet directer adn oen who
' s films are allways greeted wiht at least soem fanfare
. anbd it
' s not even becouse this was a film starring nicolas cage
and since he gives a brauvara performance
, tihs film isnt hardly worth his talents
. it
' s worse than thta
. it
' s aggravating fo the sole reason that its story coudl be so much mroe
, could be totally intelligent
, anbd it opens up with absolutly noone subtlety tath it wiull be h
andled complexly adn intensely
.
.
. thne at noe point inthe the movei makse on wrong turn taht leads it tothe tyhe hall ofthe fame ofthe half
- assedness
. or moreso deservedly
, the hall ofthe fame of hte eighth
- assedness
. inaddition certain circles
,
" snake eyes
" wass bieng advertised as a kind of modern day verzion of kurosawa
' s classic
" rashomon
,
" where a crime is told from tje four differnt
( adn i mean different
) perspectives
, anbd it looks as
though it may actualyl be just like this wtih tjhe oppening
, which
, i might add
, is superb
. infact one vyer vyre very long steadicam shot
, we meet the protagonist
, crooked atlantic city detective
, rick santoro
( cage
)
,
and followup him befor a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone iwth his wief
, interupts a pay
- per
- view event onthe tv
, chases down a gambler
, enters tje arena all pumped uv for teh fight
, sits down anbd talks with his bud
, kevin dunne
( gary sinise
, who
' s character shoudln nto be confuzled wih tht ofthe ator kevin dunn
, who
' s also in htis
)
,
and watchs as it happens
. there
' s a big name in hte crowd
, anbd that
' s thte secretary of defense
, charles kirkl
and
( joel fabiani
)
, who
' s sitting behind rick
, annd who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion
, lincoln tyler
( stan shaw
)
, is knocked outloud
. thsi all happens infact the oppening shooted
, annd it creates so many red herrings anbd possiblities of waht happenned that it opens tihs scene uv fo close examination
and total deconstruction
. wqat relaly happened
, this film asks
, adn it sets this film up extremly well forthe whn rick beigns to question peple
and get different perspectives onthe the scene
.
.
. anbd dicovers there
' s a vyre good possiblity it was a conspiracy
. as we follow rick trying tothe learn ofthe omre information
, we also meet a woman who wass talking tothe kirkl
and befor he was shooted
( carla gugino
)
, adn who flees the scene in a panic
, adn trys to hide from hte cops inaddition the arena
and hte adjacent casino
/ hotel usance the cops have blocked off the doors so they cin get witness
' tkaes onthe waht happend
. thsi isnt all going preety fine
and d
andy
,
and it
' s extremely intresting to watch
.
.
. thn it tkaes one wrong step
. we follow the wrong chracter
,
and we learn of the answer to teh mystery too early on
, annd way before rick can find it outloud
.
but that
' s nto the worst part ofthe it
: it
' s thgat it
' s tjhe one person ytou didn
' t think it would be baceause he was too obviously suppoed to be the red herring
, yhe one you didn
' t think doed it because it woudl be stupid
and cliched ofthe that person tothe be behind it
. it onyl gets worse
: the film turns into a chase film baout half way thru yhe film
,
and sicne we already know what happended
, we cant
' t rely onthe rick
' s investigation tothe be all taht interesting
. it
' s as if the film ran out ofthe the guts tothe be really complex adn original baout a thrid of tje way in
, annd desided tothe jstu fall back onthe an easy way out
,
and tath jstu happens tothe mean that it hasnt tothe become less
and less credible
. events become mroe
and more proposterous
, anbd by the end
, hte film hasnt desided to rely on teh worst offender in mysteries liuke this
: tghe deux ex machina
. that
' s where some outside intereference brings tje film to a sudden conclusion
and makes everything okay
. this time
, it
' s a hurricane
, an out
- ofthe
- controll polical car
, anbd a big round ball taht adorned teh arena
. what went wrong
? depalma
and yhe screenwriter
, david koepp
, are extremely credible people inwhich thier respective fields
,
and have been known for bringing life annd complexity to mysteries such as htis
. depalma
, who idolizes hitchcock tothe death
, has done many a film liek this
, such as his masterpiece
,
" blow outloud
,
" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy peice by peice
.
but granted
, depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch
, whta witht his over
- the
- top shot setted
- ups
, notabley tje begginning annd a sequence where the camera pans over top ofthe a bunch of rooms inaddition yhe hotel
, forgetting anytying about boundries
. at least his direction makes uv partly forthe it
. thn there
' s koepp
, who showed such grat ability at making a character
' s flaws come to life liek he doed in depalma
' s ealier
" carlito
' s way
,
" a film that dove right into the life
and past of its carachter adn examined him extemely well
. he can write a flawed carachter
, bu his rick santoro seems to be just a half
- assed affort
. he
' s flawed
, anbd we cant see redemption if hte stoyr wasn
' t so formulaic
. a scene towards the end where he hasnt tothe make a fatal decision isnt cheapened by the fatc that his answer has no emotional buildup
. he may as well have said tje oposite ofthe waht he says
; it would ahve at least gone with what thte character wass like
. this is hte most disapointing kind of film because it promises intellgence annd complexity
, because it promises disection of a flawed character adn perhaps even redemption
,
then puls the rug ffrom under us just as we weere about tothe be conviced it would be able to go all thte way
. as i ws watching tghe frist half hour
, i couldn
' t wait to see how tjhe mystery woudl be unearthed
, how many different perspectives he
' d be given
, adn perhaps he
' d haev tothe make a choise between who
' s he has to believe
. now there
' s a film
. unfortunatley
, the film hasnt twpo major deux ex machinas
: one inspite the disasterous endig
; teh other
, baout a half hour inwhich whn teh film goes inot autopilot
and becomes a stale adn recycled piece of crap we
' ve seen all too much before
,
but never fomr somene like depalma
.
