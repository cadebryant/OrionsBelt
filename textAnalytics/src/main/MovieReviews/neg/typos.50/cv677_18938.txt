, torture
and murder

and tghe hush

, to figure out the conspiracy behind tje shocking muder
. critique
: by the numbers
( see above
)
. this film isnt just ther
. it sist ther onthe the big screen for a couple of hours
, floats around
, goes away
, hopefully never to be heard ffrom again
. it is so predictable tht even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile awya
. it
' s as suspenseful as a lief dropping from a tree
. it
' s as action
- packed as a canadian curling tournament
. get teh picture
? i sure did
.
.
. it
' s too bad tyhat it took my friend annd i less than two minutes tothe figure out thte entire plot
, anbd to break down earch scene befoer it wass even completed
. eazy as py
. it
' s unfortunate becuase james woods
and john travolta ctually have one extrememly enjoyable scene together near tyhe beginning of the film
,
but alas
, t
' was nto to be
( taht scene alone scored two of my four points alotted
.
) woods chews it uv infront the fewd scenes that he
' s in

,
and stowe isnt window dressing wih a smile
( mia since 12 monkeys
( 8
/ 10
) it seems

.
and htis predictability isn
' t reserved only tothe thsoe who hve seen films like courage under fier or a few good men
, it runs deepo inside every one of us who knows to suspect somone as soon as they see theri obvious guilty mug on teh big screen
. it
' s liek riding a bike
. other scenarios which sponge out any tension
, suspense or interst ffrom tihs film inlcude eveyr single character eventually
" breaking down
" to the investigators without much reason given
, a ridiculously placed backgorund relationship between twpo of teh lead characters
, as much acation as my gr
andparents bedroom nightly
,
and a directorial sytle tht cant onyl reward directer simon west with a solid nomination forthe the
" best poor man
' s michael bay donig his best poore man
' s impression of tony scott
"
( add two scenes with sunlight shining through soem half
- open shades for grit anbd intergrity
, adn an all
- outloud rainfall forthe the finale forthe furhter chaos
,
and yuo
' re a great director
. yawn
. yeah
