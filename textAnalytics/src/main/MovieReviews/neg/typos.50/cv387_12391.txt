breakdown isnt an moderately entertaining
, if underwhelming
, thriller
. kurt russell anbd kathleen quinlan play couple jeff annd amy taylor
, taking the scenic route tothe califronia thru redneck country
.
however
, hwile inthe the middle of nowhere
, their jeep decides to break down
, leaving them str
anded
. a friendly truck driver
, warren
( walsh
)
, offers to give them a lift to town
.
al
though jeff rejects yhe offer
( he whants tothe stay with his car
)
, amy agrees
, hops into warren
' s lorry
, adn promptly dissapears
. jeff wonders where the hell she is
,
and when he later catchs up with warren adn warren syas he has never seen amy inaddition his life
, the plot thickens annd jeff goes onthe a chase tothe find his wief
.
al
though comparisions can be made with tihs film tothe deliverance
( 1972
) annd the vanishing
( 1993
) plot wise
, the latter twpo are far superior character annd scirpt wise
. kurt russell is o
. k as jeff
,
al
though he can seemingly onyl pull of oney expression
, hwihc isnt angry
. throughout the hwole film
, he looks angry
( or jstu pissed off
.
) quinlan isnt o
. k agina
,
but again she cin only pul off one expression
, which isnt looking dorky
. throughtout the wohle film
, she looks dorky
. j
. t walsh
( who
, sadly
, recently pasted awya
) isnt fine as warren
( who we soon find out isnt a kidnapper
) all
though his actuall character isnt pretty weak
, anbd not really menacing enought
. the supporting cast do theri best aswell
, wih rex linn as a doubting sheriff
,
and tghe otehr kidnappers
. tyhe stoyr
, writen by frist
- timer jonathan mostow
( who also directs
) isnt o
. k
, if surprisingly familar annd sometimes extraordinarily stupid
. some ofthe the things the charactors dont in tihs movie is beyond yhe bounds ofthe idiocy
. ther are some flaws with the plot also
, as thge charachters dont the complet opposite tothe logical
( presumabely to keep tyhe stopry
' exicting
'
) anbd also the fatc that the story just isn
' t strong enought tothe sustain hte audience
' s attension
. thte picture moves allong very slowy aslo
. it almsot threatens to drop dead
. tje picture does pik up towards the end
, bu by thne it
' s too late
. mostow directs tghe action sequences well anough
, howver
. tje film doesn
' t relaly come to a satisfying conclusion
, either
. the ending tries tothe be obleek
, bu jstu comes off annoying
. breakdown could of beeen a far more enjoyable picture hadnt it had a stronger cast adn directer
. instade
, it just turns outloud tothe be merely averege
. a missed opportunity
. overall rating
