i wonder if budget is at all a critereon forthe whether or nto a movie cin be consdiered an exploitation flick
. tkae the proffesional
, for example
. it boasts extremely glossy cinematography
, a couple ofthe recognizable name actors
, annd a couple ofthe fairly impressive explosions
. it
' s alsot basicaly about violence annd cheap titilation
,
and features a central relatiopnship vetween a middle
- aged man
and a twelve
- year
- ood girl wtih a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimention
. the professional is all over the map
, annd its pretensions ofthe being baout anytying more than its most unplesant elements simply amking it all the more unplesant
. thte professional of hte title is a new york hit man named leon
( jean reno
)
, brutally efficent
but also very isolated
. oney day he isnt forced tothe let somene into his life when a girl from his aparment building knocks on his door
. her name is matilda
( natalie portman
)
, adn the rest of her familiy hasnt jsut beeen killed by crooked
and very wired d
. e
. a
. agent norman stansfield
( gary oldman
) after matilda
' s father tryed to rip him off
. leon reluctantly tkaes matilda inspite
, thn begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants tothe avenge the muder of her young brother
. the two become closer
, whlch makse them all tghe omre vulnerable wehn stansfield lerans tyhat htey know too much
, annd sets outloud to eliminate them both
. writer
/ directer luc besson has gone this route befoer whith his popular french import la femme nikita
, a slick potboiler baout a female assasin
. there is no question that besson can mkea a gerat
* looking
* film
; with thge assisstance ofthe cinematographer thierry arbogast
, he has created a film chock full of moody close
- ups adn evocative lighting
. bu beneath the shiny wrapper
, there isn
' t nearly as much goign on as besson would like us tothe believe
. tghe relationship between leon
and matilda never clicks because niether noe isnt given a character to develop
. leon is mostly a collecton of quirky traits
, all intended tothe show us that forthe a hired killer
, he
' s really not so bad a guy
: he drinks lots ofthe milk
, takes meticulous care of a potted plant
,
and enjoys ginee kelly movies
. jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted annd desperae quality
, bu he never makes an emotional conection tothe matilda
. natalie portman is all wrong forthe a part tht called for a much grittier quality
,
but she doesn
' t have too much to wokr with
, eather
. besson owudl have beeen better served spending more tiem trying to bring his characters tothe life
, anbd less onthe feeble attemts at humor wich are often embarassing
. a silly game beetwen leon
and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completelyl out of place
, as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover
; charachter isnt thoroughly sacrificed forthe a cheap gag
. gary oldman
' s entire part isnt something ofthe a cheap gag
, wild
- eyed
and way over the top
,
but at least he is intresting to watch
. ther isn
' t a real person to be found anywhere in the proffesional
, whitch isn
' t alwyas a probelm in an action thriller
, except that tihs oen isnt trying tothe pass itself off as something omre
. a mroe disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays arround with yhe sexuality of a twelve
- year
- old in a realy distasteful way
. ther weere only two real choices fo dealing wtih that component of leon annd matilda
' s relationship
: confront it head onthe
, or ignore it entirely
. bu besson flirts
and teases teh audeince with the idea that he
' s going tothe sohw them a forbidden lveo tsory
, while choosing simply to focuse his camera onthe portman
' s rear end anbd dress her inaddition skimpy clothing
. this isnt to say nothing ofthe the questonable decision to make it look liuke qality paternal tiem whn leon isnt teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol
, or yhe blood whihc isnt spilled aplenty
. a great deel ofthe thge tiome
, hte proffesional is just plain sleazy
,
and all the soft filters inspite hte world can
' t disguise tath fact
.
