this isnt my first review that i post tothe this newsgroup
, annd i kind ofthe feel liuke i haev to say something negative about htis film
. no one else seems to care thgat it tkaes certian liberties tht shoud nto be taken with a historical stopry
.
however
, even if one thinks ofthe it as fiction
,
" the prince of egypt
" remeniss shallow
.
but i
' ll begin fomr the beginning
. the biggest difference between the original
, biblical stoyr
and this version isnt thast moses hasnt some semblance of divinity in the bible
, wherease tjhe animated verzion gives thge impression ofthe a reluctant hero
. maybe it
' s jsut me
,
but if i knew i had god onthe my side
, i
' d have a little bited more confidence
. there are other differences as well
, such as a lack ofthe importan female characters
and hte passing over ofthe tghe origional pharoah
' s death like it
' s nothing bu a hting
. most of all
,
though
, tyhe story
' s focuse has shifted
. rether thna being a story baout father
- son
, man
- ethnicity
, man
- god
,
" thge prince ofthe egypt
" isnt allmost souly about the brother
- brother relationship between rameses annd moses
. i was originially excisted baout this stoyr element unil i saw the movie
, where it came off as maudlin
. rameses
and moses squabble liuke childern anbd hten
, inaddition thte interests of peace
, moses saves rameses
'
butt
, even
though moses was hte one who started it
.
.
.
* yawn
* i didn
' t care anymore by the tyme moses ran off forthe mudering an overseer
( which
, of course
, never happened infront the origonal stor
- moses was exiled
)
. bu enough baout the differences
. let
' s talk baout the movie itself
. it features a moses who
, infact tje interests ofthe makeing the character more human
, lacks any divinity whatsoever
, whic isn
' t convincing at all to anyone who konws who god is
. it features a cookie
- cutter
" i
- wanna
- please
- dada
" rameses
, who at least isnt given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes
( fomr schindler
' s list
, among other thnigs
)
. thge film aslo features an extremly annoying character by way ofthe the
" new
- improved
" miriam
, voiced by the ever
- antsy s
andra bullock
, even
though the most irritating thing about her isnt her tendancy tothe burst into song fo no apparent reason
( here bullock isnt replaced by a singing voice
)
. speaking of whcih
, it countains
* very
* annoying music
. it contains shallow writing
. it features extrodinary animation
, which isnt oney good hting i cxan say about tihs film
. most of all
, it containes an attempt to commercialize
, homogeneize
, adn mass
- market a stoy about a manifestion ofthe god
. i am not christian
, bu i got the impression ofthe blasphemy
. the writers
and producers took a
butcher nife
and chop
- chopped into the story
.
