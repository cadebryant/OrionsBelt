' s a love it or hate it film
. i simpley hated it
. on its mneu fo funn
, isnt a voilent feast served up as charm annd done in a tongue
- adn
- cheek manner
. it
' s a serial killer
/ horror film farce of nonstop over
- the
- top acation
and sleaze
, involving decapitations
, vampires
, biker fights
, extended gun play
,
and an array of gore thast hasnt tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. a film that regales in its vulgarity
and campiness for blood
-
and
- gore
, as it goes out ofthe its way tothe gloss over the clich
? s of tghe conventional b
- films
. it
' s geared onyl for the cult film crowd
,
and wiull make its mark there noe way or the other
. the plot involves twpo psychopath brothers
, yhe older professional bank robber annd killer seth gecko
( clooney
)
and tghe perverted psychopath killer
, richie
( tarantino
)
, who kills fo pleasure
and is allso a rapist

and go on a killing spree in wichita annd hten flee tothe a liquor stoer in a small texas border twon
. they have jstu robbed a bank annd killed a number ofthe cops
, they have alsot taked a middle
- aged bank teller as a hostage
. iin tyhe liquor stroe tehy kill a texas ranger annd the store clerk
,
and burn down thte store
. stopping off in a flop
- house motel
, richie rapes annd slaughters the hostage
. these scenes are all done with an eye forthe comedy
and parody
, if that
' s possibile
. on tyhe tv news
, it sasy tehy have killed 16 so far adn most are texas rangers
. yhe brothers plan tothe git tothe mexico anbd meet carlos
( cheech
)

. wtih road blocks adn car seaches at the border
, the brothers comm
andeer a motor hmeo ofthe a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father coudl sleep in a real bed
. htere isnt thge father
, jacob fuller
( keitel
)

; his sexy 20
- yera
- ood
, innocent daughter
, kate
( lewis
)
;
and
, her shy brother scott
( liu
)
. it
' s not explained how he happens to be chineese
. tje stopry relaly becomes bizarre when tehy get across the border
and git ready tothe meet carlos inspite a bar
/ whorehouse forthe truckers anbd bikers called tyhe titty twister
. the palce isnt opne fomr dawn tothe dusk
, thus the film
' s title
. here
' s where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention outloud tjhe window anbd have some absurd fun
, as tje palce turns out tothe be a vampire hangout
. it sells sex tothe its patrons
, annd has exotic stripper santanico p
andemonium
( hayek
) dont her alluring strip befor turning into a vampire
. the brothers
and their hostages hve tothe fight their way out ofthe tje palce
, as tjhe vampires keep coming annd thte killings become thte film
' s staple
. this suposedly clever script doed nothing
but turn me off
,
though ther weere a faw funny moments infact a film tyhat was dripping iwth speical effects
and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings
. i
' ll tkae a pass onthe htis noe
, it
' s just not my style of a film
. thge characters weere as empty as tje stor
,
and the film was an easy one to forget
.
