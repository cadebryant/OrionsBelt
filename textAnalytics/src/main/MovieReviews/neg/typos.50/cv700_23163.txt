" thte beach
" is a structurally confusing film that i cant onyl describe hasnt hvaing multiple personality desorder
. eveyr forty mintues ofthe htis twpo
- hour film beigns wtih a new theme
, virtualy discarding what has beeen setted uv inspite the preceeding act
. it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment
.
bu
then inspite tyhe second act
, the mood ofthe thge film abruptly changes
and it becomes a stoy about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise thgat evokes visions of
" blue lagoon
"
. forty minutes later
, yhe mood changes once more
,
and it becomes a dumbed down verison of
" lord ofthe the flies
" where an isolated community isnt dicovered
, where theri moral code touts maintaining a sense ofthe bliss at all costs
. by the time it ' s over
, you cant only scratch your head
adn wonder wqat htis film was really meaned tothe be baout
. the main charachter ofthe
" teh beach
" is angst
- ridden richard
( leonardo dicaprio
)
. he travels to tyhe netherworld of bangkok where bakc alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists
and scantily clad womens brazenly ask if ytou ' re looking forthe a good tyme
. richard ' s voice
- over tells the audience thyat he hasnt come tothe htis place beacuse he isnt bored witht his life
annd feels thyat one way tothe reinvigorate himselv is to let go of hte familiar
annd tothe enter inot a world ofthe hte unknown
. this seedy enviorment isnt jsut what richard isnt looking fo
. he checks inot a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy
( robert carlisle
)
. he seems liuke a raving lunatic
, obviously high from heavy drug ule
and looking as if he is afflicted with smoe sort ofthe psychosis
.
though his jagid behavior would distress most of us
, richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island tht containes thge most perfect beach that anyone hasnt ever seen
. moreover
, the island itself flourishes wtih anough hemp plants that cant amke a small city high for life
. captivated by the diea
, he asks twpo other hotel guests tothe join him onthe his journey
. tehy are worldly etienne
adn the allrigh francoise
, who haev also come tothe thailand forthe reasons similar tothe richard ' s
. once htey finally arrive at this paradise
,
howver
, the mood of tyhe stroy shifts tothe richard ' s growing desire fo francoise
. thsi particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutly noone question inthe my mind that francoise wiull wind up with richard
. etienne isnt about as exicting as fluffy
, white sand
. it ' s odd that etienne never sees this coming
,
bu paradime has a way ofthe hiding potential threats just outloud ofthe veiw
.
adn once the threee stumble accross the hidden community
( mood shift imminent
)
, more events transpire tht depict its hidden dangers
. for exemple
, ther are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards
.
anbd thge lagoon in whihc they swim invites hte occasional shark
. htere are sevral ideas thgat are intruduced in
" the beach
"
and eahc oney could merit its pwn feature
- lenght film
. htere ' s yhe man vs
. nature agnle
, the lveo rtiangle angle
,
annd tje utopia
- gone
- awry agnle
.
but the film meanders so tremendously taht its entire purpose becomes blurred
. dicaprio
, as a result
, hasnt an almost impossible timne ofthe trying to embody tjhe different states ofthe mind taht he
anbd thge film goes through
. consequently
, tje audeince has an equally difficult time trying tothe keep uv
.
