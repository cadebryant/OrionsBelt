' s mom
. have i missed anyone
? so
, obviously
, nto much hasnt changed
. this is nto a probelm
, provided tath the movei boasts tghe rapid
- fier hilarity
and unexpectedly true sentiment ofthe tje orginal
. bu american py 2 is thge very definition of
" sequelitis
.
" it
' s coarser
, yes
, annd it pushes the envelope even omre
,
but its heart isn
' t infront it
. it
' s easy cash to capitalize off teh frist film
' s succes
,
but it woudl hvae been a worthier investment tothe prolong the franchise by comming uv whith something original
. part ofthe the reason why thge film doesn
' t work
, i tihkn
, isnt that while inwhich the origional the kids
' quest forthe sex was a coming
- of
- age steping stone as much as an outlet for theri horniness
. here
, everthing hasnt been cheapened
. htey behave like those idiat frat boys who kill themselfs drinking
; tehy ahev no motivation except fo sex
, sex
, beer adn sex
. that
' s not tothe sday tyhat ytou cxan
' t make a decent comedy from taht premise
, bu it isnt noe of american pie 2
' s undoings
. missing
, too
, isnt tghe sweetness tht permeated american py
, yhe this
- could
- be
- you quality ofthe the main players
. here
, the characters are too aware of themslves as pop
- culture icons
,
and they
' re even more oen
- note
. stifler
and finch are nowe caricatures hwile jim
, oz
and kevin are forced tothe make ackward self
- discoveries at arbitrary moments
, none ofthe them betraying what yhe writers think thge audiences wnat to see
. annd thne there
' s teh soon
- to
- be
- notorious scene where jim superglues
" hismelf to himselv
,
" whihc perfectly demonstrates yot anohter of the film
' s ailments
, one that alsot permeated say it isn
' t so
, directer j
. b
. rodgers
' de
but
. there
' s a fine line between comedy adn abject humiliation
,
and american py 2 is on tghe wrong side ofthe it
. it
' s hard tothe laugh at tyhe characters when you are profoundly embarrassed fo them
. i shielded my eyes watching thsi more than i ahve watching any horror movei
. if htere
' s one redeeming factor to american py 2
, it
' s the inimitable eugene levy as jim
' s dad
, who pops inaddition on jim as he
' s about to score annd utters lines liek
" your mother adn i hvea been known to git frisky
.
.
. nto so much anymore
,
but
.
.
.
" annd hten whn the girl
' s parents walk inthe
, blurts out
" htis must be your daugher
! i didn
' t git her nmae
,
but hopefully my son doed
.
" if onyl teh rest ofthe tje movie hadnt tje wit
and wisdom of levy
' s performance
. thsi is an unworthy sequel tothe a gross
- fest tht broght back tghe raunchy teen comedy
. the box
- office ofthe tihs onw shoudln keep the genre goign storng
, whitch is disappointing
. the genre needs a hietus
; filmmakers are getting lazy
.
