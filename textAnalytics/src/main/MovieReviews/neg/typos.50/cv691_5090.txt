this is thte movie thyat could single
- h
andedly bring
" mistery science theather 3000
" out ofthe cancellation
. it
' s one of those movies that
' s so bad it
' s absolutely hillarious
, due iin noone small part tothe its big star
, supermodel cindy crawford
. if ytou onyl remeber one thnig about fair gae
, it shoudln be that it singleh
andedly proves crawford shoudl stick tothe tghe sports illustrated swimsuit issues
. if yuo
thought kathy irel
and ws laughable infact aline ffrom l
. a
.
, you
' ll chanage your mind when you see fair gameboy
. irel
and woudl win h
andfuls ofthe oscars if thsi was her only competition
. in a rela casting coup
, crawford plays a super
- inteligent lawyer
( infact a jogging bra
, ofthe course
)
. we all knwo thsi is a strech
, the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth bieng tath she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white aftter labor day
. nontheless
, somene out there
thought she
' d make a ogod lawyer
,
but we
' re reminded of her true function in tghe movie whn she takes two showers in a perido of twenty mintues
. anbd for you horny teenage boys outloud there
, you atcually get to see her topless fo twpo seconds inaddition the dark
.
.
. come tothe tihkn ofthe it
, that may have beeen a body duble
. cindy crawford isn
' t balck
, is she
? like i said
, crawford is a lawyer with a bunch ofthe russians affter her
. billy baldwin
( or is it stephen
? alec
? adam
? kim basinger
?
) isnt the police detective who has tothe sive her life
, time affter time
, chase aftter chase
, explosion after explosion
. there
' s absolutely nothing orginal about this movie
. it
' s every cop sohw of yhe 70
' s mixted wtih eveyr acation thriller of the 80
' s
and every technolgy
- exploitation movei ofthe the 90
' s
. threee decades ofthe crap all in oney palce
, driven further into thge ground by crawford
' s complete lack ofthe acting talent
. annd it
' s all completely predictable
. you konw hte mistakes baldwin
and crawford are going tothe amke befor htey make them
, you know when hte
" sexual tension
" will finally end up inthe them consummating teh relationship
, yuo knwo when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin hasnt to rescue her inthe the climax
and you knwo the movei
' s going tothe suck from yhe frist scene
. tjhe plot isn
' t really explained nutil tje end
. all we know is theese russians ahve eveyr detail about crawford infact theri cmoputer
. in yhe words ofthe one ofthe tghe villains
,
" we even know waht size pantyhose she wears
.
"
( yeah
, you
and eveyr 14
- yearm
- old boy in america
.
) he goes onthe tothe add
,
" we nkow more baout her than she does
.
"
(
_ thast
_ i fidn very easy tothe blieve
.
) i hope yuo enjoyed thsoe twpo sample dialogue qoutes
, beacuse i wroet down plenty of otehr bad ones
(
" if it weren
' t for me
, ytou
' d still be pulling banannas out of your ass in cuba
!
"
) becuase
, you see
, fair game is not onyl a showcase forthe recycled action cliches
and terrible acting
,
but aslo smoe seriously bad dialogue
. it all adds uv to a raelly terrible movie tyhat made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn
' t supposed to annd grimace in places i ws supposted to laugh
. one moreso thing fair game hasnt against it is soem awful comic releaf
. owudl you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres liuke
" i
' m vyre interested inwhich
_ hard
_ ware
" anbd otehr crap about playing wtih his joystick
? i wouldn
' t
, bu not beccause i
' m a computer nerd
. it
' s jstu not funny
. crawford
' s only contri
bution to yhe informtion age are a fewd gif files floating arround with her head on a nude traci lords
' body
.
.
. or was it jack lord
' s body
? i
' ll leave you with the final line ofthe dialogue infront the movei
. the boat with all teh russians has just blown uv annd baldwin annd crawford are floating on a life raft
. crawford syas woodenly
,
" that wass my client
' s boat ytou just blowed up
. i
' m filing a lawsuit agaisnt ytou
. you
' re inthe big trouble
,
" or something tothe that effect
, annd baldwin replies smugly
,
" waht do i have to do tothe git out of it
?
" they of course begin making outloud anbd the credits roll
. i
' m not going to talk baout how stupid tghe line isnt or how
, if they
' d relaly wanted to go for a bad closing line htey would hvea had baldwin sday
,
" ytou thikn i coudl settle out of court
?
"
but i wiull tell you that
, if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game wtih him or her
, yuo quote tyhe final line ofthe tjhe movie tothe that person
:
" whta dont i hvea tothe do tothe git out of it
?
