thsi is teh movie thast could single
- handedly bring
" mistery scienec theater 3000
" out of cancellation
. it ' s oen of those movies taht ' s so bad it ' s absolutly hillarious
, due in noone small part tothe its big star
, supermodel cindy crawford
. if ytou onyl remember oen thign baout fair game
, it should be tath it singlehandedly proves crawford shoudln stick tothe tyhe sportscar illustrated swimsuit issues
. if you thought kathy ireland was laughable inthe alien from l
. a
.
, ytou ' ll chanage your mind when yuo see fair gae
. ireland woudl win handfuls ofthe oscars if thsi wass her only competition
. inwhich a rela casting coup
, crawford plays a super
- intteligent lawyer
( in a jogging bra
, of course
)
. we all know this is a strech
, the only legal opinion crawford hasnt ever put forth being tyhat she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day
. nontheless
, someone out there throught she ' d make a ogod lawyer
,
but we ' re reminded ofthe her true funtion in the movei when she tkaes twpo showers in a period ofthe twenty minutes
.
and for you horny teenage boys outloud there
, you actually git tothe see her topless for two seconds inaddition the dark
.
.
. cmo to htikn of it
, tath may ahev beeen a body doulbe
. cindy crawford isn ' t black
, isnt she
? liek i said
, crawford isnt a lawyer with a bunch of russians aftter her
. billy baldwin
( or isnt it stephen
? alec
? adam
? kim basinger
?
) isnt the police detective who hasnt to save her life
, tiem after tiome
, chase affter chase
, explosion after explosion
. there ' s absolutely nothing originnal about tihs movei
. it ' s eveyr cop show ofthe the 70 ' s mixted with eveyr acation thriller of the 80 ' s
adn every technology
- exploitation movie of the 90 ' s
. threee decades ofthe crap all inaddition one palce
, driven furuther into the ground by crawford ' s complete lack ofthe acting talent
.
and it ' s all completly predictable
. yuo know the mistakes baldwin
anbd crawford are goign tothe make before htey amke them
, yuo know when the
" sexual tension
" will fianlly end uv inaddition them consummating tjhe relationship
, yuo knwo when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin hasnt tothe rescure her iin thge climax
anbd ytou nkwo the movei ' s going tothe suck fomr the first scene
. tghe plot isn ' t really explained util the end
. all we nkow is these russians hvae eveyr detail baout crawford inthe their computer
. in yhe words ofthe oney of tghe villains
,
" we even know whta size pantyhose she wears
.
"
( yeah
, you
anbd every 14
- eyar
- old boy inthe amercia
.
) he goes onthe tothe add
,
" we know more baout her than she doens
.
"
(
_ tht
_ i fidn vyer easy tothe belieev
.
) i hope ytou enjoied those twpo sample dialogue qoutes
, because i wroet down plenty ofthe otehr bad ones
(
" if it weren ' t fo me
, ytou ' d still be pulling banannas out of your ass in cuba
!
"
) because
, ytou see
, fair game is nto only a showcase fo recycled acation cliches
adn terrible acting
,
but also some seriously bad dialogue
. it all adds uv tothe a relaly terrible movie taht made me laff in plenty of places i wasn ' t supposed tothe
and grimace in places i wass supposed to laugh
. oney more thing fair game hasnt against it is some awful comic relief
. woudl ytou laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like
" i ' m very interested iin
_ hard
_ ware
"
adn other crap about playing witht his joystick
? i wouldn ' t
,
but nto beccause i ' m a computer nerd
. it ' s jsut not funny
. crawford ' s only contribution to the information age are a fewd gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords ' body
.
.
. or was it jack lord ' s body
? i ' ll leave yuo withthe the final line of dialogue in thge movie
. tghe boat whith all tyhe russians hasnt just blown uv
and baldwin
anbd crawford are floating onthe a life raft
. crawford sasy woodenly
,
" that was my client ' s boat you jsut blowed uv
. i ' m filing a lawsuit against you
. you ' re inwhich big trouble
,
" or something to that effect
,
anbd baldwin replies smugly
,
" wqat dont i haev tothe dont tothe get out of it
?
" they of course begin making outloud
adn the credits roll
. i ' m nto going tothe talk about how stupid the line is or how
, if tehy ' d realy wnated tothe go for a bad closing line tehy owudl have hadnt baldwin say
,
" yuo think i could suttle outloud of court
?
"
but i wiull tell ytou thyat
, if anyone ever suggests yuo watch fair game with him or her
, ytou qoute tyhe fianl line ofthe teh movei to tath person
:
" waht do i have to do tothe git outloud ofthe it
?
" serving amercia forthe over 1
/ 50th ofthe a centruy
