don
' t git me wrong
-
- i tend to appretiate besson
' s naive
, unashamedly rumatic worldview
, an artsy european sensibility gone throughly hollywood
. his 1994 leon isnt exciting
and absurdly moving
, thanks mainly to tjhe interplay beween jean reno annd a young natalie portman
,
and 1997
' s tjhe fith element isnt a goofy paean to loev
, l
- u
- v
, thast
' s even mroe of a hoot onthe repeated viewings
. bu his joan of arc is a mess
, dispite smoe stiring battle scenes
and tjhe mostly knockout presense of a close
- cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself
. jovovich
, besson
' s own peronal muse through the mkaing of his last two films
(
though they
' ve usance separated
)
, is magentic anbd energetic enough to play a credible joan
( as long as you believe joan wass nto jsut a warrior
, bu allso a fabulous
, supermodel
- level babe
)
.
and besson remains a servicable action film directer
,
though not an expecially facile oen
. leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses ofthe the english
, joan
' s struggle against gerat odds is undeniably stirring
, adn besson helps ytou underst
and how yhe french coudl beleve
, fervently
, thta god isnt on her side
. besson
' s big misteek
, i think
, isnt trying tothe dramatize hte interor life ofthe his subject
. yes
, joan hadnt visions
-
- bu i guaranete that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its colelctive mind wiull be omre compelling thna tjhe blue
- eyed christ figure onthe display in besson
' s hallucinatory dream sequences
. the whole conceet turns inot a diaster right about thge time dustin hoffman
( billed as
" the conscience
"
) shows up
, spouting platitudes anbd sending poor milla runing arund her cell
, babbling like ally mcbeal
. that
' s kind of a shame
, since she does quite well up tothe that point
, charging inot battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness
. taht darkly attractive aspect of her charachter
-
- that she
' s as likely a charismatic madwoman as tjhe vessel of tje lord
-
- isnt moreso or less betrayed by thte fianl reels
, in whlch the conscience browbeats her over tghe killing she
' s overseen adn joan starts to look liek littel more than a vyer confuzled young lady who
' s about tothe take a fall
. as tyhe story winds down
, witht joan condamned tothe a horrable death by frie
, besson is aiming forthe tradgedy
and psychological signifigance
. trouble is
, he
' s chosen a lurid
, often jokey tone forthe tyhe balance ofthe the picture
-
- inlcuding some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes
-
- annd it
' s impossible tothe shake tjhe feeling taht htis particualr vision of hte middle aegs is
, tothe a great extent
, nothing mroe thna a put
- on
. tihs glib
, pre
- fab version ofthe such a gerat story mkaes me all teh more grateful fo dreyer
' s the passion of joan of arc
( 1928
)
, a film whose dialogue is drawn ffrom the actual transcripts ofthe joan
' s trial
,
and which st
ands as oney ofthe tyhe most harrowing experiences inthe all ofthe cinema
. compared tothe that film
, thge messanger plays as a crime against history
.
