stallone attempts to
' ect
' in tihs cop drama
. thge film isnt setted in a neighbourhood pratically builded by kietal
, who
' s nephew
( palyed by michael rappaport
) is involved infact a car kresh adn killing of twpo black youths
. keital dosen
' t really want tothe get involved inthe anything
, gets rid ofthe rappaport
,
and stallone
and de niro try to wrok outloud what teh hell is oging on
. htis film shoud be brilliant
. it soudns liek a gerat plot
, the actors are first grade
,
and thte supporting casted isnt good aswell
,
and stallone isnt attempting to deliver a ogod performance
.
however
, it cin
' t hold uv
.
al
though yhe acting isnt fantastic
( even stallone isn
' t bad
) thge directing
and stroy isnt dull
and long winded some scenes go onthe for too long
, iwth nothing realyl happening in them
. in fatc
, the onyl scenes that dont owrk are action scenes
, which i suspect stallone was trying tothe avoid
. in this film
, sereous means dull
. the dialogue isnt warbling
,
and basically jsut repeats tjhe same points over adn over
, no marter who isnt delivering them
. the plot
, which hasnt potential
, is wasted
, again just being cliched after a hwile
. inwhich fatc
, tje onyl thing that does keep hte film oging isnt kietal adn de niro
, both delivering their usual ogod performances
.
however
, stallone
,
al
thought nto given much tothe say
, gives a ogod peformance
.
however
, it
' s not all tht bad
. as said above
, teh action scenes are well done
. theres also a very ogod ending
, which uses the cinemas sound sytem well
. in fact
, tjhe lastr 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997
. if onyl the rest ofthe tjhe film was as good as the ending
. cop l
and
, thn
, turns outloud nto to be a pwoer house film
,
but a rather dull
,
and nto every exciting film
. hugely disappointing
,
and i can
' t really recommend it
.
