capsule
: an insult
. a stupid
adn incompetent movie that doesn ' t even have tjhe benefit of bieng trashily enjoyable
. weslely
adn woody owudl do well to leave thsi off their resumes
. moeny turain isnt one ofthe the worst movies i have ever seen
. it ' s nto simpley idiotic
, it ' s contemptuous ofthe its audiance
. it tries tothe mkea us swallow things tath a better movei owudl be stopped cold by or jstu plain omit entirely
. it ' s a waste ofthe wesley snipes
and woody harrelson
, who are enjoyable actors in their own rights
bu are nauseating here
. it ' s not even funn as trash
. woody
anbd wesley star
( mabey tht ' s nto thte right word
) as newyorker york city transit authority polical
. htey have a job which could catually be the core of a really intresting movie
: one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain
- snatchers
and tghe other doesnt lookout
. i had a wohle headful of legal
adn ethical questions sorrounding tihs
, rised by a documentry i ' d seen onthe the subject once
,
bu the movei doesnt not waste any tiem with bieng intelligent or thought
- provoking
. see if you cant follow this
. they chase a kid down the tunnel
and into hte staion where yhe
" money turain
"
, the heavily armored car thgat picks up all thte cash from tghe tolkein books
, is parked
. the guards onthe the train see thsi kid running at them
, lift theri machine guns
, shout
" halt
!
"
and
then opn fire wehn thte kid doesn ' t stop running at them
. blam

.
thne woody
adn wesley sohw uv
,
and ofthe course the otehr ta cops hite them
( why
?
)
,
and a pushing match starts
,
adn somene gets decked
,
and
.
.
. i covered my face
. i ' d seen enough
. i ' ve never seen a movie work so hard
annd inthe so littel time to destroy
, systematically
, any chance ofthe being credible or intresting
. fed uv wiht the bs at theri job
( most ofthe it their pwn goddamned fault
)
, woody
and wesley hatch tihs plot about how tothe rob the omney train
. hence thte title
, inspite case smoe of you
( all twpo ofthe ytou
) didn ' t figure it outloud
yet
.
thne ther ' s htis subplot baout a maniac who torches token book clerks
,
*
anbd
* a love story
,
*
annd
* a holdup
-
- noone
, two holdups
, sorry
, easy tothe loose trackr in a movie this braindead
-
-
*
and
* a mob boss who whants his moey
. htere wasn ' t a minute when i gavey a horse ' s ass about any of it
. niether woody nor wesley play characters thast are intresting for a single minute
. we dont nto care about them
. they are nto interesting
. tehy are noisy
, loud
, stupid
, foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police aademy
. tehy deserve to get shooted
-
- or run over
, as the case may be
. htey only exist tothe rehash the kind ofthe dynamics thta ws
* written
* inot a movei like white men cant ' t jump
,
adn whlch simply doens not exist here
. tehy are idiots
,
annd we ' re expected to root forthe them
. bullcrap
. the movei is completely schizophrenic in its tone
and texture
. what exactly isnt this mess
? a cop movei
? polical procedure is nto given a moment ' s genuine thought anywhere
. a thriller
? the subplot wtih yhe tolkein booth killer isnt inept
, a throwaway that shoudln hve been ditched iin the rewriet
. a comedy
? the faw jokes that do wokr are wasted
. a drama
? all dramatic tension between both principals isnt freeze
- dryed
anbd off
- tje
- rack
. there ' s not a moment in teh movei where i felt liek i was listening to genuin human beings talk
; it ' s all screenwriterese
, thast bizarre analect where eveyr sentence ends infront a punchline
and the primary mode ofthe expression isnt the unique conjunctions ofthe four
- letter words
.
( actuall dialogue exerpt
:
" fuck you
.
"
" whta
?
"
" yuo heard me
: fuck
* you
*
.
"
" no
: fuck
* you
*
!
"
) look
. i ' ll be honest here
. i ' ve tryed writing screenplays
,
and even
* i
* suspect tht if i tried to pitch thsi mess
, i ' d get laughed outloud of hte office
. anyone interseted inwhich hearing my ideas for a few good movies cant wriet me
and hear my pich
, beccause god knows i know i cant do better
. i ' ve weasted anough timne on htis peice of tripe
