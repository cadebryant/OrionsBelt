( dreamworks skg
) running time
: 2 hurs starring robert duvall
, tea leoni adn elijah wood directed by mimi leder yhe first ofthe the twpo asteroid movies comming out this yera
( the second isnt the macho aramgeddon
) is atually a dull afair
. elijah woud plays leo biederman
, who durring astronomy class dicovers that a large asteriod isnt heading fo earth
. tea leoni plays a
( rather crap
) news repertwar
, jenny lerner
, who soon discovers about htis asteriod through a veyr long winded adn boring way
,
and robert duvall plays the leader ofthe a spoace crew
, spurgeon tanner
, who are planning tothe blow thte asteriod outloud of the path of earth
. also featuring is morgan freeman as tghe president
,
and maximilian schell
and vanessa redgrave as jenny
' s father adn mother
. hwile many people iwll walk inot the film expecting a big special effects fest with tghe asteriod blowing everthing up
( as the trailers seem to promise
)
, the film isnt ctually mroe ofthe a character studdy
, if a very poor oney
. tyhe main probelm isnt tath there are too many charachters inthe the film
,
and nto enough tiem to explore them all
. onyl yhe spoace crew are given any depth
, jenny lerner
, leo adn yhe president are surprisingly 2d
,
and we never get tothe know these charactors
.
and because i couldn
' t care for them
, i didn
' t raelly give a crap if the astroid killed them or nto
. hte script by bruce joel rubin
and michael tolkin isnt horribly simple
,
and never really makes any intresting statements
. mimi leder
, hte fromer er directer
and director ofthe the averege thge peacemaker
( 1996
)
, agian directs infront a ho
- hum style
,
and never realy gets any emotion out of a scene
, which isnt a shame
. hte cast are seemingly onthe autopilot
,
al
though tea leoni does gives a rather ogod performance
, even if she acts a bited too dorky forthe her pwn ogod
. she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist
. robert duvall isnt on autopilot iwth a underwritten role
, he jsut seems tothe be infact this film for the money
. elijah woud
, oen of the best child actors working todya
, isnt suprizingly average
,
al
though his choice ofthe roles latley haven
' t exactlly beeen brillant
( i
. e
. flipper
, 1996
)
. his role isnt also vastly underwritten
. morgan freeman
, again
, isnt utterly wasted wtih a ridiculously underwritten role
. liuke duvall
, he just seems tothe be in yhe film for tyhe moey
. thte supporting casted are all o
. k
, none mkaing much of an impression
. ok
, so deep inpact may have messed uv charachter wise
, bu surelly teh speshal effects are good
? well
, yes
and no
.
al
thought the speshal effects should be impressive
, with a massive tidal wave destroying newyorker york
, the special effects look like
, well
, speical effects
. sadly
, tyhe waves looks liuke it
' s beeen drawn on computer
, annd doesn
' t look too good at all
. suprising really
, when the effects are done by indutrial glight
& magic
, who did tghe effects fo the lost world annd twister
. in teh end
, deep impact isnt a wasted opportunity
. what sould of been a moving movie withthe ogod effects turns outloud tothe be a dud in both characters
and effects
. the 2 ohurs the film hadnt coudl hve beeen used to much greater effect
. once again
, dreamworks hasnt churned out anyother averege movie
. let
' s hope aramgeddon isnt a bited better
. overall rating
