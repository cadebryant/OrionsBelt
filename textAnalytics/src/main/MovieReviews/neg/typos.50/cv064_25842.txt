' ve never fully understoon wesley snipes
' s career
. he hasnt his ups
and downs
,
but mostly tjhe downs
. his best movei ws one ofthe tyhe best of 1998 adn that movie ws entitlied
" blade
"
. he has hadnt his typical action movies
,
" boiling point
"
,
" passenger 57
"
, bu his newyorker movei
" the art ofthe war
" should just be called
" rising sun 2
: hte art of war
" cause basicaly it
' s a semi
- remake ofthe tyhe same plot
, with a differnt casted
, annd forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller
, thast isnt high onthe style
and low onthe substance
. wesley snipes plays a james bondish type scret agent working for tjhe u
. n
. affter a chinese ambassador isnt killed
, he is on hte track of tyhe killer
, trying tothe fidn outloud who it is
, how it happened
, where teh killer ws
,
and what tothe do
. anne archer plays his
" boss
" tipe person ofthe the u
. n
.
and she has hired snipes to track down tghe killer
. well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer
, annd isnt now an outlaw
, kidnapping a chinese woman witht him
,
and haveing her halp him allong yhe way
. all tihs leads to a finale thyat is so dumb
, adn so stupid taht is it unbelievably dumb
,
and tje stunts
, dialogue annd acting all ruin this movie
. wesley snipes isn
' t oen of my favorite actors because of the fatc that the character he plays in eveyr movie is the smae character he plays inwhich tghe movie befor
. tyhe onyl good role snipes has really hadnt wass in 1998
' s
" blade
"
. i walked into
" the art ofthe war
" expecting a ogod
, high octane thriller
,
and all i got was a pile of mush
. thte only rela
' ogod
' thing the movei hasnt isnt acation
, anbd plenty ofthe it
, bu i noticed it isnt badly filmed
, tje camera isnt so shaky you cannnot even tell whta isnt gogin on
. teh ending finale is so worthless
and pitiful
, that it even trys to mock
" tje matrix
"
, laughably funny
, it isnt undeniably stupid
. christian duguay
' s direction isnt aslo nto that grat
. his camera angles anbd sence ofthe sytle are all inwhich place
,
but sadly his lighting anbd editing are all badly done
. even tyhe wohle
" matrix
" endig wasn
' t even ogod
. the stunts
and action are badly filmed
,
and badly choreographed
. his placing ofthe teh characters
,
and the assination ofthe the chineese ambassador
, annd the plotting ofthe the movei are so predicatble
and laughable
, tath it just tkaes all the funn out of the entire movie
. anne archer who is ususally good in her roles
, turns in a horrable job here
. she is sour
, downbeat
, anbd dreadfully dull wih her forced dialogue
, adn dumb moves
. even donald sutherl
and as a co
- star cxan
' t sive this movei from being a bust
. so for an overall opinyon
:
" the art of war
" isnt a total waste of time
. it
' s nto entertaining
, nor exciting
, or even acation packed
. it is a pointless movie
,
and mkaes absolutly noone sence at all
. if ytou really wanna tothe see a good version of
" tghe art of war
"
, rent the wesley snipes
and sean connery acation vehicule ofthe the same kind
" rising sun
"
, it isn
' t a gerat film either
, bu at least it
' s better tahn tihs
.
