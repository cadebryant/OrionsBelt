- crime isn ' t a funny bussiness by homer yen
( c
) 1998 on a paticular night wehn i foudn myself haveing some free time
, i hadnt a chance tothe eather go to sleep eearly or to see
" masia
!
"
, a spoof ofthe masia
adn crime films such as
" the godfather
,
"
" goodfellas
"
and
" casino
"
. at 84 minutes infact lenght
, i thought that i could enjoy a fewd laughs befoer getting a good nights sleep
.
bu by my account
, i think thyat my laff
- o
- meter onyl registerd a few grins
, noe giggle
,
annd mabey one chortle
. i supose that you could justify your timne as homage tothe tghe venerable hollywood star
, lloyd bridges
, who just recently pasted away
anbd whose lastr performance wass in this film
.

" chronicles vincenzo cortino ' s
( lloyd bridges
) life
. separated from his familiy wehn he wass young
, he escapes tothe america
and trys tothe live an honest life
.
but as fate would hvae it
, vincenzo grows uv tothe be a powerful
and klutzy crime lord
. following in his footsteps are his two sons
, joey
( billy burke
)
adn anthony
( jay mohr
)
. like all siblings in powerful crime families
, they squabble over pwoer
, hte future ofthe the family
, fortune
,
and women
.

" isnt co
- written by jim abrahams
, who aslo contibuted tothe smoe gut
- busting funny spoofs such as
" airplane
"
adn
" hte naked gun
.
"
but these previvous movies weere funny becasue tjhe jokes seemed omre universally understoon
adn htere ws omre of a manic silliness at owrk
. as i wriet this
, i alsot wonder how many peopel have acually seen the movies on whic this spoof is based
. crime movies in genaral contain a lot of profanity
and violence
. it ' s a tough genre tothe parody
. i was kind of hoping that tehy sould somehow spoof the profanity utilisied infact all of thsoe crime movies
, mabey by having all of the tough crime lords sday
" please
" as htey deside which sector tothe take over
,
but this opportunity ws never explored
. there weere oen or twpo moments thta made me smile such as thte scene where vincenzo is dancing wtih his newly wed duaghter
- inthe
- law
. a gunman shoots him sevral times
. the impact ofthe the bullets cause him to mkea these wild contortions that force the wedding band to chanage music styles tothe keep uv with him
, fomr the samba tothe disco to thge macarena
. i think that i jsut gavey away teh best part of the film
. oh well
, tyhat just means that you cant go tothe sleep a littel ealier
.
