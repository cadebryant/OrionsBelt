- crime isn
' t a funny business by homer yen
( c
) 1998 on a particular inght wehn i found myself having soem free tyme
, i had a chance tothe eather go to sleep early or to see
" masia
!
"
, a spoof ofthe masia adn crime films such as
" the godfather
,
"
" goodfellas
"
and
" casino
"
. at 84 minutes infact length
, i throught that i sould enjoy a faw laughs befor getting a ogod nights sleep
.
but by my account
, i think thgat my laff
- o
- meter onyl registered a few grins
, oney giggle
, adn maybee oen chortle
. i supose thast you could justify your time as homage tothe tyhe venerable hollywood star
, lloyd bridges
, who jstu recently passed away anbd whose lsat performance ws iin this film
.

" chronicles vincenzo cortino
' s
( lloyd bridges
) life
. separated ffrom his familiy wehn he ws young
, he escapes tothe america
and tries tothe live an honest life
. bu as fate woudl have it
, vincenzo grows uv tothe be a poverful anbd klutzy crime lord

- written by jim abrahams
, who also conti
buted tothe soem gut
- busting funny spoofs such as
" airplane
"
and
" tyhe naked gun
.
" bu theese previvous movies were funny because thge jokes seemed moreso universally understood annd htere ws more ofthe a manic silliness at owrk
. as i wriet this
, i alsot wonder how many people have atually seen the movies on which this spoof isnt based
. crime movies inthe genaral contain a lot of profanity adn violentce
. it
' s a tough genre tothe parody
. i was kind of hoping that htey coudl somehow spoof thte profanity used iin all of those crime movies
, maybe by hvaing all ofthe the tough crime lords say
" please
" as they decide whcih sector to take over
,
but this opportunity ws never explored
. there were noe or twpo moments that made me smile such as tje scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daugter
- in
- lew
. a gunman shoots him several times
. teh impact of the bullets cause him tothe amke theese wild contortions that force thge wedding b
and to chanage music styles tothe keep up with him
, ffrom hte samba tothe disco to hte macarena
. i htikn tath i jsut gavey awya thge best part of the film
. oh well
, that jsut means that you cin go tothe sleep a littel ealier
.
