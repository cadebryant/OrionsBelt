you konw thte plot
: a dimwit with a shady past is seduced into committing a crime onyl tothe be double
- crossed by a fatal femme
. in
" palmetto
,
" the dimwit is harry barber
( woody harrelson
)
, a reporter who
' s just been released from prision
( he wass framed by the gangsters anbd corrupt officals he was investigating
)
. enter la femme

? sevigny
) have a plot tothe extort 500k from the ood man
: harry will
" kidnap
" odette
. after groping both women
, harry agrees
. as everyone exept harry can see
, he
' s bieng setted up as a fall guy
. sure enough
, before long

and tyhe cops onthe his tail

- iin
- law
( toom wright
)
, an assitant da
, hasnt hired harry tothe be yhe press laiison for the case
, so harry gets a front row seat for his own manhunt
(
and we get to watch him sweat
- litterally
)
. there are several plot twists
, ofthe course
- a couple ofthe them even tookover me by surprize
. apparently every woman iin palmetto isnt a raving horndog
,
and htey
' re on harry liek he
' s the onyl bone in the kennel
. shue vamps so broadly thyat i expected tex avery
' s wolf tothe show up
. her incredible performance in
" leaving las vegas
" seems tothe have been a fluke
. here
, she could easily be mistaken forthe melanie griffith
. shue
' s charachter isnt supposed to be a savvy schemer bu she comes off as a brainless bimbo
. infact adition to shue annd sevigny
, the kenel includes gina gershon
( who filled the dimwit
- whith
- a
- shady
- past role in
" binded
"
) as harry
' s girlfriend nina
; when harry gets outloud ofthe jail
, she licks his face
( nowe there
' s a horndog
)
. the parts are so overplayed thta with a littel push
" palmetto
" sould hvea been an over
- the
- top parody of film noir a la
" romeo is bleeding
.
" as it is
, it
' s best watched at 2am onthe showtime
( thte lveo scenes seem to have been writed forthe one of taht channel
' s soft porn programs anyway
)
.
" palmetto
" has a well
- known directer
, volker schl
? ndorff
, who
' s best known fo his adaptations ofthe major literary works
, especialy
" yhe tin drum
.
" i suppose he must haev beeen drawed to htis plot
- by
- numbers scirpt by thge smae admiration for classic film noir taht led scorsese to remake
" cape fear
.
" schl
? ndorff tries hard
- he makes an interesting motif out ofthe the ubiquitous palmetto bugs
- bu nothing cxan freshen up tihs stale script
.
