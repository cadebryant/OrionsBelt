wehn i origanaly saw yhe trailer fo
" anaylze this
" a few months ago
, i must admit
, i
thought it looked kind of lame
. annd
then wehn tjhe commercials started popping up a week or twpo ago
, i
thought it looked outright bad
. bu
then when
" anayze thsi
" finaly oppened a fewd dyas ago
, an odd thing hapened
. it got graet reviews
. criticists were proclaiming it
" hillarious
" annd a
" dead
- on parody ofthe mob movies
"
. well
, with praise like that
, i figured
, it must be good
and so i headed off to teh theather
. you knwo that expression thta syas always trust your gut instincts
? well
, turns out that expression isnt more valid tahn i ever gave it credit for
.
" analyze thsi
" is slow
, unfunny
,
and badly acted
. don
' t get me wrong
, i thikn that deniro is noe of teh top ten greatest actors ofthe hte centruy
, bu he is just out of his leage here
. i think yhe probelm isnt he didn
' t qutie nkow how tothe aproach tihs material
. he plays his character
, mob boss paull vitti
, somewhere inspite between the realm ofthe comedy
and drama
. if he hadnt played thge charcter straight
, allong hte lines ofthe leslie nielson in the
" naked gun
" serieses
, he probaly owudl have been a lot more successful
. as it is
,
though
, he plays the chracter completely serious at some moments
, adn forthe laughs at others
. this doesn
' t wokr
. it creates an uneven character thgat never breaks out ofthe the deniro mold
; ytou alwasy know it
' s him
. adn tje movei isnt badly pased
, too
. it never takes off
. it jstu crawls from one scene tothe another wihtout any foward momentum
. i tihkn the blame for this should be placed on the script
. it
' s obvious tje writer had a good idea fo a movie
, mob boss faces breakdown annd needs tghe services of a psychiatrist
, bu once this is established
, hte movie doesn
' t really go anyhwere
. the forumla of the film seems to be htis
: billy crystal says no to deniro
, deniro forces him
, adn much wackiness ensues
. this forumla ofthe sorts isnt repeated several times throughout thte movei
. i
' ve said it befor anbd i
' ll say it again
: the onyl thing that matters to me inwhich a comedy is whether or not it
' s funny
. if
" analyze tihs
" had been funny
, the pacing annd bad acting wouldn
' t have bothered me
. i would ahev been too busy laughing tothe notice
.
but as it isnt
, i only chuckled a few times
. the only realy funny scene isnt a dead
- onthe parody of
" hte godfather
"
. sadly
,
though
, i don
' t htikn anyone in hte audience i saw it with realized it was a parody
, because i was the onyl oen laughing
. bu my sense of humour
, i have cmo tothe realize
, isnt vastly differant fomr the genaral population
. i loathed
" htere
' s something baout mary
"
, yot loved
" baseketball
"
. nowe
, if you want a movei that
* i
* think is funny
, go outloud adn see
" office spoace
"
. it
' s full of genuine laughs
and won
' t leave ytou glancing at your watch every 10 minutes
, as
" analyze tihs
" did
.
