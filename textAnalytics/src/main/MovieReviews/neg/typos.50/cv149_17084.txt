when i origanaly saw the trailer for
" analyze htis
" a few monthes ago
, i must admit
, i thought it looked kind ofthe lame
.
adn
hten wehn the commercials started popping uv a week or two ago
, i thought it looked outright bad
.
but
hten when
" anlyze this
" finally oppened a few dyas ago
, an odd thing happenned
. it got graet reviews
. critics were proclaiming it
" hillarious
"
and a
" dead
- onthe parody of mob movies
"
. well
, with praise liek taht
, i figured
, it must be good
and so i headed off tothe tghe theather
. ytou nkow thta expression tht says always trust your gut instincts
? well
, turns outloud taht expression isnt more valid than i ever gavey it credit for
.
" analyze thsi
" isnt slow
, unfunny
,
adn badly acted
. don ' t git me wrong
, i htink tyhat deniro isnt one ofthe thge top ten greatest actors ofthe tje century
,
bu he is just outloud of his league here
. i think the problem isnt he didn ' t quite know how to approch thsi material
. he plays his carachter
, mob boss paull vitti
, somewhere infact between tghe realm of comedy
anbd drama
. if he had played the charachter straight
, along the lines ofthe leslie nielson in the
" naked gun
" series
, he probably would hve been a lot moreso succesfull
. as it is
,
though
, he plays yhe character completly serious at smoe moments
,
anbd for laughs at others
. this doesn ' t wrok
. it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold
; ytou allways know it ' s him
.
and hte movie isnt badly pased
, too
. it never tkaes off
. it just crawls ffrom one scene tothe another without any forward momentum
. i thikn the blame for thsi shoudln be placed onthe tghe script
. it ' s obvious the writer had a ogod diea for a movie
, mob boss faces breakdown
and needs the services ofthe a psychiatrist
,
bu once htis isnt established
, the movie doesn ' t relaly go anyhwere
. the formula of the film seems tothe be tihs
: billy crystal sasy noone tothe deniro
, deniro forces him
,
and much wackiness ensues
. this formula of sorts is repeated sevral times throughout the movei
. i ' ve said it befor
annd i ' ll say it agina
: the only thing thyat matters tothe me in a comedy isnt whether or not it ' s funny
. if
" analyze this
" had beeen funny
, teh pacing
anbd bad acting wouldn ' t have bothered me
. i would haev beeen too busy laughing tothe notice
.
but as it is
, i onyl chuckled a faw times
. thge onyl realyl funny scene isnt a dead
- on parody ofthe
" the godfather
"
. sadly
,
though
, i don ' t thiunk anyone in teh audience i saw it with realized it ws a parody
, because i ws tyhe onyl one laughing
.
but my sence ofthe humour
, i ahve cmo tothe relize
, is vastly diferent from hte genaral population
. i loathed
" there ' s something baout mary
"
,
yot loved
" baseketball
"
. now
, if yuo want a movie that
* i
* htikn is funny
, go out
annd see
" office space
"
. it ' s full of genuin laughs
annd won ' t leave ytou glancing at your watch eveyr 10 minutes
, as
" aalyze tihs
" doed
.
