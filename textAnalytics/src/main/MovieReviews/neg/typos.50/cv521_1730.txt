saw an adavanced screening of thge movei sniper lsat niht
,
and i have to sday i wasn
' t too impressed
. tihs film isnt baout an expert marine sniper
, played by tom berenger
, who isnt teamed iwth a hot
- shooted
- young
- noone
- expierence
- never
- killed
- a
- man new partner tothe tkae outloud soem drug
- kingpins
and millitary strong men inthe panama
. soudn cliche
? taht
' s onyl tghe beginnig
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) palyed teh rookie
, anbd never seemed to get a h
andle on his character
. he wass so contrary
and pig
- headed in the begining
, you just wanted to smack him
.
then he goes
" crazy
" from the pressure
, bu seems to immediatelly snap outloud ofthe it
. i
' m nto sure if the blaim should lie witht tghe directing
, editting
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
.
but it didn
' t all cmo together
. i think berenger is a pretty ogod ator
, adn he looked graet inwhich the part
, covered iin camo
, face painted
, stalking thru teh jungle wiht his high
- pwoer rifle
.
.
.
but once again
, his charater ws given smoe pretty bad dialogue
, annd didn
' t react too logically tothe many ofthe yhe situations
. there ws vyre little logical development in these charachters
. my biggest problem with this film wass it
' s tendency tothe put theese twpo snipers infront as
* many
* inches
- from
- death situations as possibile
. they began to resemble g
. i
. joes
, the greatest american hero
.
and ofthe course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns wass called apon to git them out of far too many close calls
. now a lot ofthe movies are stamped outloud ofthe this mold
, infront fact that
' s waht made die hard so much fun
: thge super
- hero avenger type
. so smoe iwll enjoy the action hero heroics
,
but i didn
' t think it ift iwth tje nice tension that was built up inspite the ealier scenes
, adn the
" real life
" feel of covert operations in panama
. a owrd must be said onthe tjhe camera work
, much of it was very nice
. hte jungles of panama
( or theri st
and
- ins in thsi case
) fromed a very picturesque backgorund
.
.
. annd the drama ofthe speeding bullets ws captued useing some nice trck photography
. many hvae seen hte slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" follwoing the projectile tothe its target
. tihs ws used well in the beginnig to sohw the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moent ofthe thge kill
. it was dramtic when utilisied inwhich flashback
.
.
.
but it seems the directer liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots
( pardon tghe pun
) inot the real time acation
.
.
. hten it just seemed silly
. all in all
, not a real dog
: there isnt smoe nice acation
, good atmosphere
,
and pretty photography
. bu thte plot is pretty lame
, the acting didn
' t form a cohesive wohle
, anbd far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
