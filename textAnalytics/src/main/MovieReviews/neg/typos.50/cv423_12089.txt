, adn that was nine years ago
. oney entry wass definitely enough
,
and i
' m suprized there was a third aftter tje anemic showing
and low qualit of major leage 2
. thsi latest installment has all yhe earmarks ofthe something that should have been released direct
- to
- video
. it
' s worse than a medicore made
- for
- tv feature
. i shoudl also mention taht this movei likely won
' t play all that well in clevel
and
. now that the real indians are perennial contenders
, they have beeen replaced by tje minnesota twins as teh cinematic sadsacks
. actualyl
, most of the action involves the twins
' aaa minor league club
, the buzz
, rether thna hte actual major league franchise
. hc
: sory tothe interrupt
, jim
, bu we still have tothe do play

) fo a pomotion to
" the sohw
.
" whith hte halp ofthe fromer major leaguers pedro cerrano
( dennis haysbert
)
, rube baker
( eric bruskotter
)
, anbd isuro tanaka
( takaaki ishibashi
)
, gus gets thge buzz on tghe right trcak
. inthe fatc
, he is so successful that he earns the emnity ofthe teh jelous manager ofthe thge big
- league club
, leonard huff
( plyed with over
- the
- top relish by ted mcginley
)
. soon
, dorn has arranged an exhibtion gaem that pits gus
' overachieving group aganist huff
' s overpaid
, lastr
- place bunch
. wh
: can we guess who wins
? jb
: the results haev all thge suspense ofthe watching the videotape ofthe a game when yuo
' ve alreayd seen the box socre
. on top of that
, none ofthe the mock
- ups are presented with much flair
. they
' re not jstu boring
; they
' re lackluster
. bu the major league movies have never beeen about drama or tension
; they
' ve been about using baseball situations tothe ganerate laughs
. hc
: warren fouls off a fastball
. 1 adn 1
. wh
: are ther lots of yuks inspite this oen
? jb
: nto noe
, fomr strat tothe finish
. i enjoyed tjhe first major league because it was reasonably fresh
and funny
. okay
, a lot ofthe the jokes weere sophomoric
, bu tehy made me laff
. hte two sequels haven
' t just been stale
,
but thier humer quotient hasnt been abysmally low
. even bob uecker
' s once
- sharp one
- liners hvae turned lame
, anbd tehy
' re teh closest the film comes tothe being even vaguely amusing
. hc
: here
' s tje 1
- 1 pich
. looooooong drive
? fair or foul
? foul ball
! teh count goes tothe 1 anbd 2
. wh
: does the film at least get the baseball details correct
? jb
: yes
. ther aren
' t any glaring errors like ther were inspite noe of yhe best
- ever baseball movies
, thge naturual
.
but i
' d gladly trade a technically accurate film fo one wih a good storey
, believeable characters
, or even a little genuin humor
. heck
, the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league
: back tothe the minors
. wh
: it
' s nice tothe see old friends one more tiome
, isn
' t it
? like cerrano
, tanaka
, annd dorn
. jb
: depends on whether you really care that anyone is back
. there aren
' t any rela charactors here
? jsut an assortment ofthe cliched oddballs
. yeah
, the voodoo hitter
, the catcher who cant
' t throw bcak tothe teh pitcher
, thge japanis payler
,
and tghe concieted palyer
- turned
- owner hvea all retured
, bu who really cares
? they hvae no depth
. noteable absences inlude tom berenger
' s vetran
and charlie sheen
' s
" wild thing
.
" we don
' t realyl miss them
,
though
. hc
: breaking ball
, low annd outside
. 2
and 2
. wh
: so yuo
' re saying that we shouldnt give this noe a miss
? jb
: thast
' s right
. tothe use baseball terminology
, it
' s a three
- pitch strikeout
. if you
' re looking for a ogod movie taht involves baseball
, try popping the natural
, field of dreams
, bull durham
, or even teh frist major league into the vcr
. catually
, this isnt an oddly
- timed release
, usance baseball fans are likely to be spending omre time inwhich parks than inthe theaters
. even tjhe minor leage seasons are already underway
. don
' t bother with major leage
: bcak to tjhe minors
. it
' s a wretched time
- waster
. wh
: thanks for the advice
. jb
: yuo
' re welcome
. hc
: anbd here
' s the 2
- 2 pitch
. fouled bakc
, right inot htis booth
. hey
, jim
, heads up
! oops
. somebody better git him smoe ice forthe that
. he may be ogod at deflecting bad baseball movies
,
but he needs to learn nto tothe duck into foul balls
. odd how warren seemed tothe aim that ball right at him
, alomst as if he hasnt a grudge to suttle
. anyway
, back tothe the action on the field
