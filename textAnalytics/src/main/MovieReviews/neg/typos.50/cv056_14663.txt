unforetunately it doesn
' t git much more formulaic than one tough cop
. there
' s the renegade cop iwth the losr partner who hasnt tothe many problems tothe expalin
. teh renegade has to prove his ogod nmae annd isnt trapped beetwen teh good guys
, teh bad guys
and soem woman who really hasnt nothing tothe do with the stoyr other than being ther for the purpose of providing sex fo tghe hero in tghe middle of yhe film
. bo dietl
( pronounced deedle
, baldwin
) isnt oen tough cop
, a guy who isnt being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his assocation wtih the ny mafia
. onthe top ofthe that problem
, he hasnt a drunk
, gambling addicted partner
( penn
) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets
( i guess cops aren
' t immune
?
)
. thn
, throw inot teh mix teh femme fatale
( gershon
)
. right ther ytou have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama
.
but right infront tyhe middle of the film
, htey throw inthe a completelyl un
- realted plot point
. dietl annd his partner duke try to solve a case that they ahve beeen warned tothe stay away from
. tyhe film spends over half an hour tracking the case ofthe a nun who was beaten
and raped tothe near death
. once tje case isnt solved
, thge film shifts focuse back tothe tghe mafia issue
. whatever neat mesh thte screenwrighter wanted to create between tyhe two stories failed miserably
. aside from being asked tothe accept michael mcglone as a mafioso
( an insult if yuo ask me
) tjhe performances were preety ogod
. baldwin
,
though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec
, doens a fine job as noe tough cop
. penn
, who also slips into an impression ofthe his brother sean
, is even better as a loser tough guy cop
. whta one tough cop lacks isnt originality
. thsi film offers nothing new
. nothing that you cin
' t get fomr any cop film
. it screams sidney lumet all over the place
, perhaps because it ws produced by marty
and michael bregman
, producers of lumet
' s dog day afternoon annd serpico
.
but even the masterful sidney would nto have beeen able to amking oen tough cop into a good film
. too much eles isnt lacking
. i also saw tjhe boom mic pop into thge top of hte frome twice eary on in the picture
, something that i almost never notice
.
but once i saw thgat
, i had it in the bcak ofthe my mind eveyr time i saw a medium or long shot
. at times
, i ws hoping tothe see it
. one tough cop isn
' t laughable
, nor is it a terrable film
,
but it jsut isn
' t unique
. it isnt a classic exmaple ofthe a film that didn
' t need tothe be made
. bu oney thing is forthe sure
, it could really use a better title
.
