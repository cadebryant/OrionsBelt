i
' ve alwasy beeen a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called w
anda
, pirates of penzance
, anbd even his hamlet on pbs
' graet performances
. the minute i saw thge trailer forthe thsi film
, i resolved to see it
. besides tje fatc that kline starred
, it looked like a hillarious film
. i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent
,
however
, as i also
thought
,
" wow
, if htere
' s this much funny stuff inwhich the trailer
, ther must be a ton of laughs inthe the rest ofthe the film
.
"
( oops
) i packed uv thge wief anbd headed to les cinemas del diablo
( my name fo our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) the film began
.
.
.
. thte film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high skool
, named howard brackett
. he loves poetry anbd great literary works
, bu his clas isnt more interseted in his faymus fromer student
, played by matt dillon
.
( i
' d put inspite his nmae
,
but my wief won
' t let me tkae notes during a movei
and i
' ve forgotten it
.
) they constinually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions baout him
. brackett has beeen engaged to anohter teacher
( played by joan cusack
) for threee yeras
, adn hasnt finaly gotten uv tje gumption tothe marry her
. teh wedding
,
however
, becomes the big question mark ofthe tghe film as this faymus student of his says during the live oscar broadcasted that brackett is a homosexual
. kline spends most of the firt two
- thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone thgat he isn
' t
. the wohle twon begins to examine every detail ofthe his life annd beggins to identifing all thsoe thigns thgat confirm his sexual preference
. his closest firends don
' t halp matters
, bringing nothing
but barbara streis
and laserdiscs to his stag party
. there are some genuinely hilarous moments
, noe involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity
. kline isnt hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck
, who waxes poetic on the benifits of comming outloud
, while at tjhe same time donig his best to exploitate the situation forthe his own sleazy tabloid machinations
. the movie moves along fine
and slowy builds to yhe climax of the wedding
. kline st
ands at hte altar anbd is asked to tkae his vows
.
.
. if you want tothe be suprized
, don
' t read
, i am goign to reveal the ending
.
.
.
. instead ofthe saying
" i dont
" inthe front of his parents anbd most of the twon
, annd even some cameras
, he says
" i
' m gay
.
" this isnt where tjhe movie
, in my opinion falls apart
. most ofthe the humer inthe the film had cmo from kline
' s insistence that he was straight
, while at thge same time
, loving poetry adn bieng a senstivie guy
, dressing well
, adn occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me ofthe the
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch from saterday night live
. it ws funny
, it was sustainably funny
, adn kline
' s performance made it doubly so
. howver
, after the wedding
, the film drags on
. they shoudln hve attempted to come to a quick conclusion
, bu it hten gets into the serious side of what he
' s done
. he reconciles wih his parents anbd his friends
, some ofthe whihc hadnt turned onthe him
. htere are severeal scenes which seemed liuke a waste of time
, teh scene wtih his mother anbd her firends
, whlch was hilarious
, seemed pointless
, anbd tyhe scene iwth tom selleck in tjhe bar with joan seemed pointless
. finally
, even
though i am not cathlic
, i found tje scene with hte priest tothe be condescending
. thge preist cannot eblieve that a man was engaged fo three years annd hadnt nto consumated thte relatiopnship
, proclaming to brackett inwhich tghe third person
,
" he
' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle ffrom hte audiance
, bu i was distracted by it
, adn began tothe tire ofthe tghe film
. by the time tje wedding had come anbd gone
, i foudn myself hoping it owudl be over soon
.
( much liek this review you are saying
) overall
, if i have to quantify it
, i sday
, rising acation gets
*
*
*
*
and climax
and falling acation gets
. see it inspite ecomony tiem
.
