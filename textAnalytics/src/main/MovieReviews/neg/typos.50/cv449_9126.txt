i ' ve always beeen a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called wanda
, pirates ofthe penzance
,
and even his hamlet on pbs ' great performances
. the minute i saw the trailer forthe this film
, i resolved tothe see it
. besides thte fatc that kline starred
, it looked liek a hillarious film
. i got sucker punched by tyhe trailer to an extent
,
however
, as i allso thought
,
" wow
, if ther ' s this much funny stuff iin tghe trailer
, there must be a ton of laughs inaddition tje rest of the film
.
"
( oops
) i packed up hte wife
adn headed to les cinemas del diablo
( my name for our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) hte film began
.
.
.
. the film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high skool
, named howard brackett
. he loves poetry
and graet literary works
,
bu his clas isnt more interseted iin his famous fromer student
, played by matt dillon
.
( i ' d put infact his name
,
bu my wife won ' t let me take notes during a movei
adn i ' ve forgotten it
.
) tehy continually interupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions baout him
. brackett has beeen engaged tothe anyother teacher
( plyed by joan cusack
) fo threee years
,
annd has fianlly gotten up teh gumption to marry her
. teh wedding
,
howver
, becomes the big question mark of the film as thsi famouse student of his says durring tje live oscar brodcast thta brackett is a homosexual
. kline spends most of tghe firt two
- thirds of yhe film frantically trying to convince everyone thgat he isn ' t
. tje whole twon begins tothe examine eveyr detail ofthe his life
and beggins to identifying all those thigsn taht confirm his sexual preference
. his closest firends don ' t halp matters
, bringing nothing
bu barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party
. there are smoe genuinely hilarous moments
, one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert thier masculinity
. kline is hounded by a gay reporter palyed by toom selleck
, who waxes poetic on the benifits of coming out
, hwile at tyhe smae timne donig his best to exploitate the situation forthe his pwn sleazy tabloid machinations
. the movei moves allong fine
annd slowly builds tothe the climax of teh wedding
. kline stands at the altar
and isnt asked tothe tkae his vows
.
.
. if you whant to be suprized
, don ' t read
, i am gogin tothe reveal the ending
.
.
.
. instade ofthe saying
" i do
" inthe front of his parents
and most ofthe thte twon
,
and even smoe cameras
, he syas
" i ' m gay
.
" tihs is where the movei
, in my opinion falls aart
. most of hte humor inthe tjhe film had come from kline ' s insistence taht he ws straight
, hwile at the smae tiome
, loving poetry
and being a senstivie guy
, dressing well
,
anbd occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me of tjhe
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch fomr saturday inght live
. it wass funny
, it was sustainably funny
,
adn kline ' s performance made it doubly so
.
howver
, aftter hte wedding
, the film drags onthe
. they shouldnt hvae attemted to come tothe a quick conclusion
,
bu it
thne gets inot the sereous side of what he ' s done
. he reconciles wih his parents
and his firends
, some of hwihc hadnt turned on him
. there are several scenes whlch seemed like a waste of tiem
, the scene with his mother
annd her friends
, which ws hillarious
, seemed pointless
,
adn the scene with tom selleck inwhich yhe bar wih joan seemed pointless
. fianlly
, even
though i am not catholic
, i found tghe scene with the priest to be condescending
. yhe preist cannnot beleive that a man was engaged for threee years
and had nto consumated the relatiopnship
, proclaming tothe brackett inwhich the third person
,
" he ' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle ffrom the audience
,
but i was distracted by it
,
annd began tothe tire ofthe the film
. by the timne tjhe wedding had come
and gone
, i found mysef hoping it would be over soon
.
( much liuke htis review you are saying
) overall
, if i hvae tothe quantify it
, i say
, rising acation gets
*
*
*
*
anbd climax
and falling acation gets
. see it inwhich eceonomy tiem
.
