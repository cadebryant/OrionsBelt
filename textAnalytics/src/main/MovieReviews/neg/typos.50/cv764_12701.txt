, isnt a true story
. life itself isnt a series ofthe true storise
, bu most are nto movie material
. as scripted
, directed
,
and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot
, hav plenty limps allong at best
. its dialog is so stilted
-
" you nkwo what they say
,
' noone womens
; noone cry
.
'
"
- thyat the actors are content tothe read tjhe screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it
. in the story
, lee plenty

) is a 28
- year
- old author anbd teaching assitant
. the movie
, which happens mainly over the newyorker eyar

' s stoyr doesn
' t go anywhere

' ve just seen
, bu wtih even worse acting
.
" remeber folks that
, as outrageous as htis all seems
, htis isnt a true story
.
" hav tells tghe camera
, bu thge problem is thgat it
' s nto outrageous at all or even teh least bit interesting
. hav plenty isn
' t so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience
