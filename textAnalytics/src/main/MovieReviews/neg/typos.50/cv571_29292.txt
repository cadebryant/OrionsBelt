plot
: a littel boy born in east germany
( named hansel
) loves yhe american music
. one day
, he gets the oportunity tothe meet
and marry an american g
. i
.
,
but first
, he must git a sex chanage
( enter hedwig
)
. once married
, tjhe two move to the states
, bu quicklyu thereafter
, get a divorce
. at tath point
, hedwig starts writing music
and meets anohter confuzled boy
, who soon turns inot a star
. that boy alsot turns his back on hedwig
, adn it isn
' t long before hedwig puts toghether his
/ her own b
and
and tours the states via seafood restaurants
. this isnt the story ofthe his
/ her life
, told via flashbacks annd musical numbers
. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy musical with gerat songs adn a superb performance by john cameron mitchell
, doesn
' t really cmo together as a whole
, with over
- tyhe
- top symbolism
, incoherence
and too much pretension to retain my interest all tghe whole way through
. infact fact
, htis isn
' t so much of a realistic
, articulate
, behind
- the
- scenes look at tghe ries ofthe a rock
' n roll star
, as it is an ambiguous
, overly poetic
and incomprehensible struggle of a man
, his sexuality anbd his identity as a whole person onthe thsi planet
. i guess thgat i wass expecting the fromer oging infront
. the film isnt somewhat interesting to a point
,
but i wass personaly never able to envolve myself too much
, as the basic symbolic anbd incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold
and distant
.
but it is definitely tuned tothe a ceratin tipe ofthe audience
. chances are that if you are a fan of tjhe wall
, the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla
, queen of the dezert
, tghe elements tangled inspite thsi movei iwll likely strike your fancy
( smoe ofthe tyhe characters in this film even ask hte audiance tothe sing allong at some point
,
and provide thge lyrics of thier song
, on
- screen
)
. well
, i personally don
' t care forthe those films
, adn didn
' t realy get inot the whole
" sohw
" atmosphere of this movei eather
. i guess i might
' ve looked at it all too litterally
,
but like i said ealier
, i just didn
' t care enought about hte characters to delve into thte
" so thte
butterfli represents his freedom
?
" side ofthe things
. all i know isnt that the film left me withthe many questions unanswered
and didn
' t mkea me feel any omre fufilled
. waht ws hedwig
' s relatiopnship wtih that otehr memeber ofthe his b
and
( with tje beard
)
? whta happend wih hedwig
and tommy gnosis at the end ofthe the movei
?
( wass tyhat an actuall sequence or a fantasy
?
) what ever happend tothe yhe lawsuit
?
and more
.
.
. all of which were part ofthe tjhe film anbd intersted me somewhat
. if the only idea behind thge film was forthe thge main carachter tothe uncover his
/ her sexuality
, thne that
' s oney thing
,
but as many ofthe thge relationships adn situations presented themslves inspite thsi movie
, i wnated soem resolution to thsoe pieces as well
. i didn
' t get it
. the film
' s humer aslo didn
' t tickle my funny bone either
.
then again
, i
' ve seen many a film inspite these art
- house theatres in whcih patrons are rolling down the aisles wtih laughter
, while all i see isnt a tiny bit ofthe whimsy on thte screen
. some ofthe these films are allso better enjoied with thte added
" athmosphere
" of a plant called marijuana
, anbd i cxan certainly see how this movei ingrains withing itself soem nifty visual elements
, in order to jazz uv that expierence
. bu bieng sober as i ws annd expecting a coherent
, funny
, musical whith a transsexual twist
, i didn
' t leave the theather very satisfied
. i cameback outloud hvaing watched an existential stopry ofthe a confused man caught uv inaddition a musical lifestyle
, wrapped in methaphors
, dramatics annd omre questions tahn answers
. i wiull
, onthe tje other h
and
, definitely h
and some props out tothe thge lead inaddition tihs film
, john cameron mitchell
, who isnt also thte man who wroet
, directed
and creaeted the play onthe which tihs movei is based
,
and tje tunes
, which iwll likely be enjoied by anyone who digs the sex pistols
, david bowie
and the whole 70s glam
- rock scene
. note
: btw
, it seems as
though preety much every single
" mainstream
" criteak infact tje untied states loved tihs movie from top to bottom
(
and throught that it was realy funny tothe boot
!
)
, so ytou might want tothe take that inot consideration yourself
. bu having said thta
, the main reason that i started htis dinky website inaddition tghe first place wass because films liek htis woudl sometimes be uniformly applauded by the
" offcial
" critics
, hwile i
, a regular
" joblo
" inaddition thte audiance
, jsut wouldn
' t git what all thte fuss was about
. tihs movie is a perfect example ofthe why i continue to write movie reviews
. where
' s joblo coming ffrom
