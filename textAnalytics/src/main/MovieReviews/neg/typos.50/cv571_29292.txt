: a littel boy born in east germany
( named hansel
) loves the american music
. oen day
, he gets thge opportunity tothe meet
adn marry an american g
. i
.
,
but first
, he must git a sex chanage
( enter hedwig
)
. once marryied
, the two move to the states
,
bu quickly thereafter
, git a divorce
. at thast point
, hedwig starts writing music
adn meets anyother confused boy
, who soon turns inot a star
. thyat boy alsot turns his bcak onthe hedwig
,
and it isn ' t long before hedwig puts together his
/ her own band
and tours the states via seafood restaurants
. this is thge story of his
/ her life
, told via flashbacks
anbd muscial numbers
. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy muscial with graet songs
anbd a superb performance by john cameron mitchell
, doesn ' t raelly come together as a hwole
, wiht over
- teh
- top symbolism
, incoherence
annd too much pretension tothe retain my interest all the hwole way through
. infact fact
, htis isn ' t so much of a realistic
, articulate
, behind
- the
- scenes look at tghe rise of a rock ' n roll star
, as it is an ambiguous
, overly poetic
adn incomprehensible struggle ofthe a man
, his sexuality
and his identity as a wohle person on this planet
. i guess taht i was expecting the former gonig inspite
. the film isnt somewhat interesting to a point
,
bu i ws personally never able tothe envolve mysef too much
, as teh basic symbolic
and incongruent nature ofthe the film left me feeling cold
and distant
.
but it isnt definitely tuned to a certian type ofthe audience
. chances are that if yuo are a fan ofthe thte wall
, the rocky horror picture sohw or even priscilla
, queen of hte desert
, thge elements tangled in thsi movie will likely strike your fancy
( soem ofthe the characters in thsi film even ask the audeince tothe sing along at smoe point
,
and provide the lyrics ofthe theri song
, on
- screen
)
. well
, i personaly don ' t care forthe those films
,
annd didn ' t relaly get inot hte wohle
" sohw
" atmosphere of this movei either
. i guess i might ' ve looked at it all too literally
,
but like i said earlier
, i just didn ' t care anough about hte characters to delve into the
" so the butterfly represents his freedom
?
" side ofthe things
. all i knwo is that tje film left me with many questions unanswered
and didn ' t mkea me fiel any mroe fullfilled
. whta was hedwig ' s relationship with thta otehr member ofthe his band
( withthe hte beard
)
? what happenned with hedwig
adn tommy gnosis at tyhe end of the movie
?
( ws that an actual sequence or a fantasy
?
) what ever happened tothe thge lawsuit
?
annd more
.
.
. all of whcih were part of the film
and intersted me somewhat
. if the only idea behind the film was forthe the main carachter tothe uncover his
/ her sexuality
,
then taht ' s one thing
,
bu as many ofthe yhe relationships
annd situations presented themselfs in this movie
, i wanted soem resolution to thsoe pieces as well
. i didn ' t git it
. teh film ' s humor also didn ' t tickle my funny bone eather
.
then agina
, i ' ve seen many a film in theese art
- hous theatres infront which patrons are rolling down thge aisles with laughter
, hwile all i see is a tiny bited of whimsy onthe the screen
. soem of theese films are also better enjoyed wih tghe added
" atmosphere
" ofthe a plant called marijuana
,
anbd i cin certainly see how this movei ingrains within itself smoe nifty visual elements
, inaddition order tothe jazz uv that expierence
.
bu bieng sober as i wass
and expecting a coherent
, funny
, musical with a transsexual twist
, i didn ' t leave hte theater very satisfied
. i cameback out having watched an existential story ofthe a confuzled man caught uv infact a muscial lifestyle
, wrapped infact metaphors
, dramatics
adn moreso questions thna answers
. i will
, on the otehr hand
, definitly hand some props out tothe the lead inthe thsi film
, john cameron mitchell
, who isnt also the man who wroet
, directed
adn creaeted the play on hwihc thsi movei isnt based
,
annd teh tunes
, whic iwll likely be enjoied by anyone who digs tghe sex pistols
, david bowie
anbd thge hwole 70s glam
- rock scene
. note
: btw
, it seems as
though preety much eveyr single
" mainstream
" criteak inthe tyhe untied states loved htis movie ffrom top tothe bottom
(
anbd thougth thgat it was really funny to boot
!
)
, so yuo might wanna to take thgat into consideration youself
.
bu having said thta
, the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first palce was becuase films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the
" offical
" critics
, while i
, a regluar
" joblo
" in the audiance
, just wouldn ' t git what all tjhe fuss was about
. this movei is a perfect exmaple ofthe why i continue to rwite movei reviews
. where ' s joblo coming from
