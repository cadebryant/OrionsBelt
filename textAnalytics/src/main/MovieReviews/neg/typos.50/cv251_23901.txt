let me jsut start tihs review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling annd have been forthe fifteen years
. i am not too fond ofthe ted turner
' s world championship wrestling
,
however
, annd i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse fo a wrestling movei tongiht
. the plot concerns twpo losers named gordie boggs
( david arquette
, aptly cast as a ne
andrathal
)
and sean dawkins
( scott caan
) who are so obssessed wih professional wrestling tht htey believe everthing tehy see on wcw monday nitro is something more tahn a flashy sohw
. whn they fianlly git to see their hero
, wcw world champion jimmy king
( played by oliver platt
. i personally woudl have gotten a wrestler tothe play king
)
, he ends uv getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meaned for real
- life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired
and rehired six months later
,
and if anyone reads htis who knows bischoff
, they will agree witht me that tjhe role of sinclair hadnt his name written all over it
)
, htey embark onthe a quest to find him annd halp him git his title bakc
. when htey fidn him
, htey dicover iin horror that jimmy king
' s rela life is nothing liuke it is onthe wcw tv
. king is a drunken atlanta native rether tahn an english king
. after convincing king thgat htey don
' t care that his persona isn
' t rela
, gordie
and sean sneak him back onto wcw omnday nitro
, aftter wich sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title
and his job back inspite las vegas at wcw
' s pay
- per
- veiw
. gee
, whiz
, there are so many thigsn wrong with this movie
, i don
' t know where to beign
. yes
, i do
.
.
. 1
. the cahracters of gordie annd sean sohw you whta eric bischoff
, wcw president who throught uv thsi project
, thikns ofthe wrestling fans
. he thikns of us as idiots who tkae everyting wrestlers do seriously
. he actually thikns wrestling fans are dumb enough to beleve this is meant tothe be tooked seriously
. i got news fo you
, eric
: nobody above the age of four isnt dumb anough forthe that
, this isnt 2000
, you knwo
, nto 1985
! i know he
' ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn
' t meaned to be taken seriously
but it is
, becasue that
' s how big an ego bischoff hasnt
. 2
. htere wass a documentry made in 1998
, wrestling whith shadows
, that doccumented the owner ofthe tjhe world wrestling federation
, vince mcmahon
' s screwing bret
" thte hitman
" hart outloud of the title
. this movei
' s storyline is basicly a comic rip
- off of that plot with the poor man
' s wayne
and garth thrown infact
. eric bischoff is trying tothe amke vince mcmahon look bad with tjhe character of titus sinclair
,
but any wrestling fan knows titus is moreso like bischoff tahn mcmahon
,
and that vince did whta he hadnt to dont tothe bret hart
. 3
. the movei
' s main wrestler
, jimmy king
, hasnt an english king gimmick adn the audience cheered big forthe him
. no wrestling fan atcually enjoys charactors liek that inspite htis day anbd age
, we want bad asses todya
! 4
. why amke this a comedy
, instead of an emotional
, rocky
- stlye drama
? i know wrestling isn
' t a sport
, bu ytou cxan still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler
and finaly mkaes it inthe the end
. 5
. inaddition tje movei
, gordie starts uv an ill
- fated romance wtih nitro girl sasha
( the lovley rose mcgowan
. what she sees in thgat freak marilyn manson i
' ll never underst
and
)
, onyl tothe find tht she hasnt hospitalized king
' s trainer for sinclair
. wouldn
' t it have beeen easier to just have them fall in love instade of doing the tipical spy
- girl
- forthe
- the
- bad
- guy cliche
? i hite that
. 6
. last
,
but certainly not least
, ther was nto oen single moent infact tihs movie thta i could nto predict would happn
, nor did i laugh once eather
. the world wrestling federation shouldnt hvea been the wrestling comany tothe make the movei
, fo these reasons
: 1
. tehy
' re the better pomotion
. 2
. they ahve better
and yuonger talent
, performers annd wrestlers
. 3
. htey give their fans what tehy want
and don
' t treat them like idiots
. 4
. they
' re winning tghe ratings anbd they
' re tjhe promotion everybody cares about
. 5
. simply put
, htey sould mkea a movei a hundered times better
,
and tehy could dont a wrestling movei tjhe right way
. the only good thing about this movei ws they played outtakes at the end
. annd if i spoiled it forthe you
, ogod
, i saved you from wasting seven dollars
.
