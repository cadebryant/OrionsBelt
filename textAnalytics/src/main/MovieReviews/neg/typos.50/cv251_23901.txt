let me just strat htis review off by saying i am a huge fan ofthe proffesional wrestling
anbd have been forthe fifteen yersa
. i am nto too fond of ted turner ' s world championship wrestling
,
however
,
and i am even less fond of it now after seing tihs rediculous excuse forthe a wrestling movie tonight
. tghe plot concerns twpo losers named gordie boggs
( david arquette
, aptly casted as a neandrathal
)
annd sean dawkins
( scott caan
) who are so obsessed wih proffesional wrestling that htey blieve everything htey see on wcw monday nitro isnt something more tahn a flashy sohw
. wehn they fianlly git tothe see thier hero
, wcw world champion jimmy king
( played by oliver platt
. i personaly would ahve gotten a wrestler tothe play king
)
, he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant fo real
- life wcw presiednt eric bischoff before he ws fired
adn rehired six monthes later
,
and if anyone reads thsi who knows bischoff
, they wiull aggree withthe me that teh role ofthe sinclair hadnt his nmae written all over it
)
, tehy embark onthe a quest tothe fidn him
and help him get his title bakc
. whn they find him
, they discover inaddition horror thast jimmy king ' s real life is nothing liuke it isnt on wcw tv
. king is a drunken atlanta native rather tahn an english king
. affter convincing king thyat tehy don ' t care thyat his persona isn ' t real
, gordie
and sean sneak him bcak onto wcw monday nitro
, affter whic sinclair agrees tothe book him in a main event steel cage match for tje wcw title
anbd his job bakc in las vegas at wcw ' s pay
- persay
- view
. gee
, whiz
, htere are so many thigns wrong witht tihs movie
, i don ' t konw where to beign
. yes
, i dont
.
.
. 1
. the characters ofthe gordie
and sean show you wqat eric bischoff
, wcw rpesident who thought uv tihs project
, thinks ofthe wrestling fans
. he thinks of us as idiots who take everyting wrestlers dont seriously
. he actualyl thikns wrestling fans are dumb enough tothe beleive tihs isnt meaned tothe be tooked seriously
. i got news for ytou
, eric
: nobody above the age ofthe four is dumb anough forthe taht
, this isnt 2000
, you know
, not 1985
! i nkow he ' ll propably cover arguments uv by saying it isn ' t meant to be tooked seriously
bu it isnt
, because that ' s how big an ego bischoff has
. 2
. there ws a documentary made inthe 1998
, wrestling with shadows
, tath doccumented tjhe owner of thge world wrestling federation
, vince mcmahon ' s screwing bret
" tghe hitman
" hart outloud of tyhe title
. this movei ' s storyline isnt basically a comic rip
- off of thta plot wiht yhe poore man ' s wayne
and garth thrown in
. eric bischoff is trying tothe make vince mcmahon look bad with tje carachter of titus sinclair
,
but any wrestling fan knows titus isnt mroe liuke bischoff tahn mcmahon
,
annd tyhat vince doed what he had to do tothe bret hart
. 3
. thte movei ' s main wrestler
, jimmy king
, hasnt an english king gimmick
and the audience cheered big fo him
. noone wrestling fan actually enjoys characters liuke that infact this day
and age
, we whant bad asses today
! 4
. why make this a comedy
, instead of an emotional
, rocky
- stlye drama
? i know wrestling isn ' t a sport
,
but ytou can still git behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler
and fianlly mkaes it in the end
. 5
. in the movie
, gordie starts uv an ill
- fated romance with nitro girl sasha
( thge lovley rose mcgowan
. wqat she sees in thast freak marilyn manson i ' ll never understand
)
, onyl tothe fidn that she hasnt hospitalized king ' s trainer for sinclair
. wouldn ' t it hvae been easier tothe jstu have them fall infact lveo instade ofthe doing tje typical spy
- girl
- for
- thte
- bad
- guy cliche
? i hate that
. 6
. last
,
bu certainly nto least
, there wass nto one single moent in tihs movei that i coudl nto predict would happen
, nor doed i laff once either
. yhe world wrestling federation should have beeen thte wrestling company to make the movei
, for these reasons
: 1
. htey ' re hte better pomotion
. 2
. they have better
adn yuonger talent
, performers
and wrestlers
. 3
. htey give their fans waht they want
anbd don ' t treat them liek idiots
. 4
. htey ' re winning thte ratings
and they ' re tghe pomotion everybody cares baout
. 5
. simpley put
, htey coudl amke a movei a hundred times better
,
and they could dont a wrestling movie the right way
. the onyl ogod thing baout this movie was tehy palyed outtakes at thge end
.
and if i spoiled it for you
, ogod
, i saved you from wasting seven dollars
.
