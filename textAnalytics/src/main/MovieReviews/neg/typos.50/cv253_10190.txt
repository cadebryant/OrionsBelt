hey
, i
' ve got a great diea for a movie
! ok
, here it isnt
: we
' ll get tim allen to pul angry faces fo baout two hours or so
! whta
' s thast
? sounds too boring
? ok
, how baout this hten
: we still haev tim allen pull faces for about two hurs
,
but half ofthe them are angry looks annd half of them are
" i
' m in pain
!
" looks
! waht
' s that
? that still doesn
' t soudn funny tothe you
? how baout if we through in some
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still not funny
? if you anwsered
" noone
, thta doesn
' t soudn funny
"
,
then
( ding ding ding
!
) yuo
' re absolutely corect
! for richer or poorer isnt a moronic farce about a rich marryied cuple
( plyed by tim allen annd kirstie alley
) who seek refuge in an amish comunity after their bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best know as newman onthe tv
' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them infront trouble fo tax evasion
. what ensues isnt a badly scripted adn horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell
. waht makes this all wrong is thta nobody seems to ahev wqat tje film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing up
, tjhe marryied cuple is brad
and caroline sexton
( allen anbd alley
)
, a populer snobby duo who seem totally in lveo tothe everyone alse
,
but iin reality are onthe thte brink of divorce
. just as theri marriage seems tothe be hanging from it
' s fianl thread
, brad dicovers taht his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, has been engaging in illegitmate deals inaddition the sexton
' s names
. tje irs catchs on
,
but sicne everthing points bcak tothe thte sexton
' s anbd not lachman
, there is nothing much to dont
.
.
. exept run awya
and join an amish community
. firt time screenwriters jana howington
and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle
- outloud
- loud moments
,
and even some decent laughs here annd
* way
* over there
, bu ther isnt so much tothe cringe at inspite htis horribly made film thta yuo
' ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn
. alley is absolutly unwatchable
,
and tje chemestry between her adn allen is about as believeable as my chemestry homework ffrom tenth grade
( which
, i inform ytou
, wass total b
. s
.
)
. allen
and alley are in noone way convincing as tycoons
, nor are htey veyr convincing as an amish couple
! this entire movie is one bad ill
- concieved notion thgat should hvae been curtailed ffrom hte vyer begining
! tje amish infront htis movie are allso flimsy
and unconvincing
. it
' s such a trite
, stereotypical scirpt thta i imagine thge actors that were casted
( noticeing tht htey
' re all predominantly tv figures
) were probablly the only ones htey could git
! bryan spicer
' s directing doesn
' t help one bited
, either
. inaddition fact
, listing spicer
' s filmography
( which includes hte first
" power rangers
" movei
and the big screen adaption of mchale
' s navy
) isnt omre of an insult than a r
? sum
?
! now tath i
' ve pretty much run for richer or poorer inot thte ground
, i will let you in on tjhe best thing baout it
. it bumped seven films uv a nitch onthe my
" worst ofthe
" 1997 movie list
. thast
' s right
, thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for tjhe year
' s worst
, six films are nowe not seamingly as bad
,
and a smile like yours
, previously inhabiting the number ten spot
, now doesn
' t hvae to suffer yhe ridicule of mkaing my bottom ten list
. if you look at it inwhich thta respect
, fo richer or poorer iwll end up making someone happy after all
!
