htere are smoe pretty impressive stars in lost in space
- it
' s jsut that none of them happen tothe be actors
. the stars i
' m referring to are the coputer generated ones tyhat make uv the movei
' s
" outer space
"
; thge stars thgat teh less impressive actors hurtle thru as tehy try tothe find their way hmeo
. yes
, in terms of acting
, hte star power isnt
.
.
. well
, mroe liuke a falling star
. kinda preety
, short
- lived
, annd preety much dead
. lost inwhich space
, as if you really didn
' t know
, isnt based onthe the 60
' s sci
- fi televsion series of tyhe smae nmae
. it
' s the yera 2058
,
and earth
' s prescious resources are quicklyu bieng usurped by tjhe needs ofthe its massive opulation
. john robinson
( william hurt
) is the scientist leading a mission program tothe colonize a foreign planet
. earth
' s entire existance is contingent apon a sucessful mission
,
but nobody
, whether it be john
' s famaly or hired battle pilot don west
( matt leblanc
)
, seems too enthusiastic about leaving thier hmeo planet for sevral years
. john
' s familiy consists of his wife maureen
( mimi rogers
)
, his atypical teenage daugter penny
( lacey chabert
)
, his ingenius son will
( jack johnson
)
, annd his beautiful scientist daughter judy
( heather graham
)
. despite everyone
' s reluctance
, the jupiter 2 spacecraft abondons planet earth
and mkaes its way into the vast eternity of spoace
. unknown tothe anyone bu the audiance
, there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage tjhe entire mission
. dr
. smith
( gary oldman
) hasnt beeen hired by a gropu of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour
, annd dr
. smith has re
- programmed a tlaking robot tothe
" destroy robinson familiy
"
! whn everything that coudl go wrong does go wrong forthe both sides
, the spaceship isnt warped to an unkown destination
,
and nowe the premise of bieng lost in spoace is complete
. as for tjhe audience
, yuo will likely be lost inaddition boredom by tihs point
, wondering if the plot
, liek the jupiter 2
, wiull ever git off tyhe ground
. it
' s hard tothe tell who deserves yhe most blame
- hte incredibly bl
and
and corny charachters or the horrifically lame script
? chabert isnt basicly the onyl one tothe overdo it
, sounding like a whiny munchkin onthe helium
. if yuo
, liek me
, were conviced by commercials thyat her voice was altered fo smoe sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens
, you
' re wrong
! that
' s jstu her normal voice
! iin yot another exemple ofthe a
" friend
" faltering onthe the big screen
, leblanc is so incredibly dull anbd yot so obviously trying so hard tothe be so incredibly charming
( make sence
?
)
, it makes ytou want to shove his ass out tjhe escape pod corridor wihtout an excape pod
. graham isnt a babe
- thank goodness htere wass something for me tothe think baout during this film
. hurt
, the balck hole ofthe excitement
, sucks up any energy that might have been left
. if hurt were available inwhich tablet form
, he owudl be a prescription stregth sleeping pill
. johnson isn
' t dull
, he
' s jsut lame as the young know it all who winds uv saving everybody
' s ass all the time
. wnat an example of how kool this kid cin be
? how about when he convinces tjhe robot tothe think with its heart adn reconsider killing the familiy
? hey
, don
' t laugh
- the thing actually listened tothe the mr
. rogers
- would
- be
- proud sentiment
.
but alas
, if yuo
thought a charcter couldn
' t be much worse
, ther wass rogers as the epitome ofthe generic
( or
, mother as she was known
)
. why hire an actress
? they could
' ve hadnt a white cardboard cutout with teh owrd mom printed on it
. nowe tath would
' ve hadnt some pizzazz
! lost infront spoace luckily doesn
' t suffer in every single category that it sould have
. teh spacial effects are crisp
, clear
, anbd at least mildly captivating
, unlike any ofthe the presences onscreen save it be oldman
, who plays his evil charactor with a great deal ofthe fun annd finesse
. unforetunately
, oldman is locked away for most of tyhe film
, giving us nothing
but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy
. hwile hte speical effects are pleasing to thge eye
, tehy are nothing yuo couldn
' t fidn infront most modern sci
- fi films
. contact
, forthe example
, far exceeds tihs film in terms of imagery adn immagination
. lost in space jsut hasnt too many shortcomings to ever be considered a wokr ofthe cinematic art
, whith numerous contradictions
( tje tyme travel aspect wass horribly flawed
!
)
, wooden
and corny acting
, worse dialogue
,
and an endig so disapointing
, yuo
' d be happier tothe have seen tghe entire robinson familiy get blown tothe smithereens
. hten again
, iwth an ending like this film has
, it
' s obvious a sequel is aleady bieng considered
. what an awful onot to end onthe
, knowing there coudl be omre of this in a yearm or two
. teh attempt to be famaly oriented is commendable
,
but lost in spoace isnt lost iwth tje illution taht speshal effects anbd the nostalgia ofthe a classic tv serieses being revisited isnt enough to satisfy all age groups
. well
, danger potential movie goers
! danger
! this movie kresh l
ands without ever breaking thru the atomsphere of mediocrity
