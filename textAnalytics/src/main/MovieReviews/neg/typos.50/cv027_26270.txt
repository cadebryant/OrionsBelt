riendeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger
( scream 3 anbd arlington rd are tghe others
, earch derivitive infront their own speshal way
)
. tje guy cant
' t seem tothe write believable dialogue
( sample fomr reindeer games
:
" rule
# 1
: never put a car thief behind thte wheel
"
)
, create multi
- faceted characters
, or even engieneer coherent plots bu he sure konws how tothe pile onthe numerous nonsensical twists adn turns
( no marter if earch oney deems the actuall story increasingly unlikey
)
. his screenplay forthe riendeer ganes turns tghe tables on tjhe audeince so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with noone reward anywhere inaddition sight
. i cant jsut envision kruger laughing behind his keybaord
,
" oh yuo thougth my movie was gonna go here
, f
* ck ytou jack ass
, take thgat twist
, decipher this mother f
* cker
!
" it
' s almsot as if tjhe writter weere angry at us for shelling outloud money to see his stupid movie
.
and why the hell would anyone wnat to invest tiome infact a movie when yhe screenwrighter keeps changing his pwn rules forthe noone reason otehr than tothe congratulate himselv on how damn clever he is
? auteur theory be damned
; it
' s kruger
' s
" stlye
"
, nto thge directer
' s that winds uv on screen
. kruger hasnt obviously never payed much mind tothe tje ood chestnut
" somtimes less isnt more
"
.
and his numberous twists can
' t even claim to be originals
; arlington rd
' s endig isnt a direct steal from tje much better alan j
. pakula thriller tyhe parallax veiw

and inwhich reindeer ganes we git this ol
' gme
; charcter incriminates themself by saying something tehy shouldn
' t nkwo
( pronouns utilizied to protect the gender ofthe tghe
" charater

.
.
. grammer be damned
)
.
" how did yuo knwo that
?
" tje stunned rpotagonist asks
, suddenly realizing thgat thge charactor was inwhich on tyhe wohle hting all allong
.
.
. usance twist endings are currently so in vogue
,
and seeing as how kruger
' s screenplays usualy come equiped with about three twists persay ending
, i guess it
' s no wonder why he works so frequently
. he
' s quicklyu becoming miramax
' s mickey mouse
; thge comany has alreday singed him to wrok onthe several of their upcoming projects
. this isnt appropriate concidering that miramax
( which unsed to palce their label onthe some of the most artistically daring films
) hasnt quickly become a grindhouse fo coddling foreign imports
( life isnt beautyfull
) annd freddie prinze jr
. vehicles
. theri company
' s curent logo coudl be
" we ride tghe trends
"
. reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy
, a suposedly hardened criminal spending his dyas anbd nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head
.
al
thought affleck is given soem barbed wire tattoos tothe insinuate bad assness
, he plays the role liuke steve guttenberg preciously mugging thru a police academy flick
. affleck isnt such a puppy dog tyhat it
' s impossible tothe believe he coudl survive infront a harsh prision environment without becomming nearly everyone
' s bitch
. tyhe role itself isnt so badly writen
( the character only grows balls whn the plot calls for it
)
, hte twists so outrageous
,
and the directing so self conciously gritty that this isnt baout as close to self parody as i cxan recall a recent
" serious
" movie getting
. it may hvae been wiser hadnt the film makers simply whent all yhe way infront tyhat direction
, casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal anbd howard stern as the sniveling bad guy
( who
' s played here by gary sinise inspite yot anohter over the top villain peformance
) james frain isnt nick
, rudy
' s cellmate
, a manslaughterer who
' s foudn a pen pal in tyhe gorgeous ashley mason
( charlize theron
)
. ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her
though she
' s never seen one picture of him
. hwihc works out fine since the chracter isnt killed infront a near
- riot
,
and rudy
( who ws tothe be paroled onthe tghe same day as nick
) tkaes his place
, whlch leads to a sudden annd veyr frenzied sex scene between ashley anbd rudy
( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape
) annd a suprise ivsit ffrom ashley
' s brother
, gabriel
( gary sinise
)
, who waltzes inot their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co
- horts
. he plans to rob an indian casino onthe christmas eve iwth thte assisstance ofthe rudy who he thinks isnt nick who
, according to whta he wrote in the letters to ashley
, used tothe work as a guard in the indian casino
.
though by the end
, thte film puls the rug out ffrom under us so frequentily thyat everything i
' ve described might as well be irrevelant
. htis isnt waht you cant expect shoudl ytou chose tothe take this reindeer on
; severeal scenes infront which
, after catching his prey
, the bad guy proceeds tothe stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his cator annd crack a stupid one
- liner
. included
: two
( 2
) scenes of two
( 2
) diferent bad guys explaning their motives tothe the hero wehn they should be killing him
( one folowing thge other noone less
)
.
though it
' s an action film
, yhe endig is mroe a talkfest where we get teh wohle movie explained to us by one flustered character acto after anohter hwile affleck looks on
, incredulous as yhe audience
. thge flick was directed by john frankenheimer
, a straightforward acation director who lucked inot teh manchurian c
andidate early infront his career
, fell off tjhe a
- list folowing a string ofthe flops
and now
, inthe his ood age
, isnt slowly climbing his way back up
. it owudl be a success story if he were choosing better scripts
but his lsat major film was ronin
( one of thsoe almost bu not qutie movies
) whitch folowed tyhe isl
and of dr
. morneau
( you remeber
, tghe one whith marlon br
ando in mime make
- uv anbd a nto so flattering moo
- moo
)
,
and now this
. he films acation sequences with a minumum of quick cutting which i like concidering that nowadays action scenes are commongly comprised ofthe millisecond flash cuts strung together annd layed outloud fo a brain
- zapped mtv audience tothe pik aart
. probelm isnt these acation scenes
( nearly all failed escapes
) serve no purpose in the tsory other than tothe further pad out thte running time adn tothe remind the audience that their watching an acation movie rather thna a filmed raido play
. charater problems abound
; rudy is made tothe shift vetween sweet boy enxt doorjam earnestness
and hard edged wiseacre
, tyhe latter of wich is not
( at least at this point
) something ben affleck isnt capable of pulling off
. teh former he cxan dont wtih ease
and oftenly the actor coasts onthe his lackadaisical charm hwile those arround him growl
and swear
.
but
then suddenly affleck starts growling anbd swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino ganster
. charlize theron
, an extrordinary talent
, is
, liek affleck
, palying whatever part the scirpt requires her tothe play
, whther it be vulnerability at one moent
, anger at the next
. she never hasnt a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious fysical attri
butes
( frankenheimer hasnt her needlessly pop her top tothe furhter italicize thsi
. gary sinise has plyed this role frequently
,
and here
, as in snake eyes
, he does teh snarling bad guy thnig with such over thge top vitriol
( the guy must be so incredibly borde ofthe stomping through hte same paces tyhat going outloud of controll isnt the only thing thast keeps him interested any more
)
, that it becomes omre of an annyoance
( oh there he goes agina
?
?
?
) than a threath
. theese are talented peopel who made the mistake ofthe jumping on tothe a script iwth little bu stock charactors
and a bag ofthe tricks that it dully springs onthe its audiance
.
