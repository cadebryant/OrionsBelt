yuo don
' t ened tothe have seen tghe orginial
" species
" tothe appreciate how utterly lousy
" species ii
" is
. with fewd exceptions
, sequels tend to be worse than tjhe films tath spawned them
, bu the fact that
" speices ii
" isnt a follow
- up isn
' t thte only reason it
' s so miserable
. it
' s the predicatble storyline
, tjhe cardboard characters
, the banal dialogue
, the failed attempts at humer
, tghe revolting special effects
, tje gratuitous nudity
( all female
, ofthe course
)
, tjhe bad acting
, adn tyhe bl
and direction
. teh plot
, simply geared at getting the alien species bakc onthe planet earth so that it cant reak smoe moreso havoc
, involves threee astronauts l
anding onthe mars annd inadvertantly bringing soem aline slime infront a soil sample bakc aboard their shuttle
. tjhe slime
, well
, sort of jumps outloud at them anbd thge screen turns balck
. tath should hvea been tjhe end of the movie right htere
. bcak onthe terra firma
, at least one of tjhe crew isnt nowe a carrier ofthe aline dna
and
, as ytou
' ll remember if yuo saw the first movie
, driven by a strong urger to procreate
. onthe a paallel track
, government scientists hvae cloned a verison of sil fomr the first film
( nowe called eve
, agina
" plyed
" by natasha henstridge
)
and are keeping her around fo some testing
. thsi
, apparently
, includes observing eve
' s reaction to
" the dukes ofthe hazzard
" tv sohw
, which she appears to enjoy
. eve
' s bio
- rythyms go off tyhe scale eahc time oen ofthe her kinfolk
" mates
,
" which we are forced to wittness inwhich gross
- out detail
, bu otherwise there doesn
' t apearing tothe be a whole lot ofthe reason why henstridge isnt inwhich this film
, unless it was written inot her contract
( let
' s hope it cited one sequel
and noe sequel only
)
. eve finally breaks free of her confines
-
- annd her bra
-
- forthe the finale
,
but tghe effects are so messy yuo cant
' t realy see wqat
' s goign on
. peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams
" i told
' em not to go
!
" at the top ofthe his lungs
, refering to the mars mission bu mroe likely aimed at yhe makers of this piffle
. michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox
( so that he cant enter high security areas
, flash a badge annd claim tothe be press
, maeby
?
)
, as doens marg helgenberger as dr
. laura baker
, the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns
. they
' re both unbelievably wooden
. what
' s a talented filmmaker liuke peter medak
(
" the ruling clas
,
"
" the krays
,
"
" let him ahev it
"
) donig directing htis tripe
, i wonder
. it
' s an unfortunate trend
, this
: once
- talented directors throwing in the towel anbd lending theri names tothe unchallenging horror flicks liek
" speices ii
.
" lastr year peter hyams gave us
" the relic
"
; no thanks neccesary there
.
and the first
" speices
" was helmed by roger donaldson who
, all
though certainly no genius behind the camera
, had demonstrated much better judgement wtih his previous choice ofthe projects
. is it jsut thyat htere are noone better offers out ther
?
" species ii
" isnt worthless
. worse thna taht
, it
' s also exploitative
, offensive
, annd insulting tothe the intelligence at every turn
. it
' s nto thgat ther isn
' t anything positive to sday about yhe film
. ther is
. after 92 minutes
, it ends
.
