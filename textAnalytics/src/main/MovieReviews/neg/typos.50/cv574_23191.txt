tghe charactors infact jonathan lynn
' s
" the whole nine yards
,
" yot anohter infront an endless reccent string ofthe mob comedies
( 1999
' s
" naalyze this
"
and
" mickey blue eyes
,
" 2000
' s
" gun shy
"
)
, are rarely ever written as rela peple
,
but merely as oney
- dimensional caricatures
. wehn an added layer tothe oney ofthe their personalities isnt revealed
, it is not tothe sevice the character devolopment
, or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations
, bu tothe accommodate the convoluted plot
. in a lightweight comedy
, yuo might say
, it is not required tothe hvea perfectly realized figures
, just as long as they get tjhe job done
. unfortunately
, fo a comedy to wokr
, it has to at least succeed at bieng funny
, adn if there was a laugh
- o
- meter availble
, i
' d guess that it briefly ascended arund 2
. 5
% of the time fo me
. suffice to sday
, the comedy in
" teh hwole nine yards
" works baout as well as the broken
- down lawnmower inthe my backyard
, adn when a giggle surprisingly arises eveyr twenty tothe thirty minutes
, it is by sheer luck
. nicholas
" oz
" oseransky
( matthew perry
) is an amater dentist living in tghe quiet suburbs ofthe quebec
. trapped infact a hateful marriage withthe hte conniving sophie
( rosanna arquette
, delightfully hamming it uv with a clearly artifical french
- canadian accent
)
, one day oz sees that somene isnt moving inot the house next
- doorjam
. walking over tothe greet him
, he isnt horrified to dicover it isnt jimmy
" tyhe tulip
" tudeski
( bruce willis
)
, a former contract killer for teh mafia who has jsut been released ffrom prision
. once getting tothe konw him adn becoming his friend
, oz is more comfortable wiht his identity
,
but fo sophie
, it means a possible hitman tothe do away with oz
. inwhich her scheme
, sophie sends oz to chicago tothe cash infront by informing his ood mob boss
( kevin pollak
) about jimmy
' s whereabouts
,
but iin the proccess
, he falls in loev with jimmy
' s wief
, cynthia
( natasha henstridge
)
, who isnt being held hostage
. apon return tothe quebec
, adn iwth noe contrivance after the next
, oz
' s dental assitant
, jill
( am
anda peet
)
, is overjoyed to disover that he lives beside
" yhe tulip
,
" adn forces him tothe set up a meeting
, since jill
' s dream in life turns outloud bieng a contract killer herself
. hvae you got all thta
? becuase htere is mroe
. much
, much more
. anbd tihs is a movei thast
, without credits
, is littel over 90 minutes annd fiels only like an hour
.
" the whole nine yards
" is an ultimately unsatisfying
and empty
- headed excursion inot well
- worn terrain laready set by far superior pictures
. how tghe cast
, most ofthe which are respectable actors
, got caught uv infact such a cliched
, defishant film rimaniss a mistery
, unless htey thougth it might aspire tothe match hte congenial screwball zaniness of directer lynn
' s 1985 comedy classic
,
" clue
: the movei
.
" oging into the theather
, preliminary comparisions beetwen the two movies were unavoidable
,
but by yhe twenty
- minute mark
, when i had chuckled once anbd laughed nary a single tiem
, it wass clear tihs prodcution wass infront sereous trouble
. usance thte entire runnung timne depends on the mechanisms ofthe tje plot
, anbd the screenplay
, inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner
, collapses with every failing
" comedy
" bited
, the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substace
and
, frequently
, entertainment value
.
" thge whole nine yards
" is neither facetious nor
, asside from tghe subplot baout jill
' s shocking eagerness tothe become a professional hitwoman
, inventive
,
and more often thna not
, jstu lies ther
, tyhe film spinning drearily arund
and around inaddition the projector
,
but never igniting any sort of spark
. a few select actors dont what they cant withthe tyhe material
, hwile others make noone inpact at all
. on tjhe mediocre side are actually those palying teh two central charachters
: matthew perry
and bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable on tv
' s
" firends
,
" plays the same exact sitcom
- style charactor in all of his movies
( from 1997
' s
" fools rush inthe
" tothe 1999
' s
" three to tango
"
)
, anbd it hasnt become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makes enxt tothe noone impression
, anbd becouse of thge limited guise ofthe his jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes dissappears inot the background
. thier threee female counterparts fare noticably better
. best of all is natasha henstridge
, far more radiant thna inthe the exploititive
" species
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth anbd emotion tothe cynthia
. henstridge hasnt hte talent
, for sure
, tothe break out of theese countless throwaway roles
, bu first she must fier her agent
. am
anda peet hasnt a lot of fun as teh quirkily straightforward
and giddy jill
,
and seems tothe know omre baout the art ofthe comedic payoff tahn even perry who
, thus far
, has strived on a career based souly on comedy
. it is too bad
, thn
, thast peet isnt unnecesarily asked tothe disrobe in a climactic scene
, whith the obvious sole purpose bieng to show off her breasts
. fianlly
, rosanna arquette isnt awful as sophie
, bu something tells me thast was her purpose
,
and her claer overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time
. alsot popping up isnt michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in
" thte gren mile
,
" as jimmy
' s largely builded friend
and fellow killer
, frankie figs
. whn
" the whole nine yards
" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion
, one isnt left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a grat deal ofthe movies of this type have been made inaddition the past
,
and this one is nothing bu a duplication ofthe better films
, so what ws tjhe point
? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments
,
" the wohle nine yards
" rests souly onthe the presumed charm ofthe the cast
,
and half ofthe the actors are nto charming at all
. now
, what does taht tell you
?
