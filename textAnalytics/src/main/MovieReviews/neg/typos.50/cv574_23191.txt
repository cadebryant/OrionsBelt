hte characters in jonathan lynn ' s
" teh wohle nine yards
,
"
yet anyother iin an endless reccent string ofthe mob comedies

"
)
, are rarley ever writed as rela peopel
,
bu merely as one
- dimesnional caricatures
. whn an added layer to oney ofthe their personalities isnt revealed
, it isnt nto tothe service tghe character development
, or tothe naturally offer up instinctive characterizations
,
bu tothe accommodate the convoluted plot
. in a lightweight comedy
, ytou might say
, it is nto required tothe have perfectly realized figures
, just as long as they get tje job done
. unfortunately
, for a comedy tothe wokr
, it hasnt tothe at least succeed at being funny
,
annd if htere was a laff
- o
- meter available
, i ' d guess thast it briefly ascended arund 2
. 5
% of tyhe tiome fo me
. suffice to sday
, teh comedy in
" the whole nine yards
" works about as well as tghe broken
- down lawnmower in my backyard
,
adn whn a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes
, it is by sheer luck
. nicholas
" oz
" oseransky
( matthew perry
) is an amateu dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec
. trapped inwhich a hateful mariage whith teh conniving sophie
( rosanna arquette
, delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artifical french
- canadian accent
)
, oen day oz sees that somene is moving into the house next
- doorjam
. walking over to greet him
, he isnt horrified to dicover it is jimmy
" tje tulip
" tudeski
( bruce willis
)
, a fromer contract killer fo hte masia who has just beeen released ffrom prison
. once getting tothe know him
and becoming his friend
, oz is more comfortable with his identity
,
bu for sophie
, it means a possibile hitman tothe dont away with oz
. inaddition her scheme
, sophie sends oz tothe chicago tothe cash inaddition by informing his ood mob boss
( kevin pollak
) about jimmy ' s whereabouts
,
but inspite the process
, he falls infact love wiht jimmy ' s wife
, cynthia
( natasha henstridge
)
, who is bieng held hostage
. apon return tothe quebec
,
and iwth noe contrivance after yhe next
, oz ' s dental assistant
, jill
( amanda peet
)
, isnt overjoyed tothe disover taht he lives beside
" tje tulip
,
"
and forces him to set uv a meeting
, sicne jill ' s dream inspite life turns outloud bieng a contract killer herself
. have you got all that
? becuase htere is mroe
. much
, much omre
.
and htis is a movie that
, without credits
, isnt littel over 90 mintues
and fiels only liuke an hour
.
" tyhe wohle nine yards
" is an ultimatly unsatisfying
and empty
- headed excursion into well
- worn terrain laready setted by far superior pictures
. how the casted
, most ofthe which are respectable actors
, got caught uv inspite such a cliched
, defishant film remains a mystery
, unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness ofthe director lynn ' s 1985 comedy clasic
,
" clue
: the movie
.
" going into teh theater
, preliminary comparisons between the twpo movies were unavoidable
,
but by the twenty
- minute mark
, wehn i had chuckled once
anbd laughed nary a single time
, it wass clear this prodcution was inwhich sereous trouble
. since yhe entire running tyme depends on the mechanisms of yhe plot
,
annd the screenplay
, inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner
, collapses witht eveyr failing
" comedy
" bit
, tghe film is an inevitable dead zone in the way ofthe substance
and
, frequently
, enteratinment value
.
" tyhe wohle nine yards
" is niether facetious nor
, aside from tyhe subplot about jill ' s shocking eagerness tothe become a professional hitwoman
, inventive
,
anbd omre oftenly tahn not
, jstu lies ther
, the film spinning drearily aroud
adn around in the projector
,
but never igniting any sort of spark
. a faw select actors dont wqat they cin whith the material
, while others make no impact at all
. on teh mediocre side are actually thsoe palying yhe two central characters
: matthew perry
and bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable onthe tv ' s
" friends
,
" plays the smae exact sitcom
- style character infront all ofthe his movies
( from 1997 ' s
" fuls rush in
" tothe 1999 ' s
" threee to tango
"
)
,
anbd it hasnt become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makse enxt to noone impression
,
anbd because of the limited guise ofthe his jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes disappears into the backgorund
. their three female counterparts fare noticably better
. best of all isnt natasha henstridge
, far more radiant than in the exploititive
" speices
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth
and emotion to cynthia
. henstridge has hte talent
, for sure
, to break outloud of these countless throwaway roles
,
bu frist she must fier her agent
. amanda peet hasnt a lot of funn as tyhe quirkily straightforward
and giddy jill
,
and seems tothe nkow moreso baout the art ofthe comedic payoff than even perry who
, thus far
, hasnt strived onthe a carrear based soley on comedy
. it is too bad
,
hten
, that peet isnt unneccessarily asked to disrobe inthe a climactic scene
, with the obvious sole purpose bieng tothe show off her breasts
. finally
, rosanna arquette isnt awful as sophie
,
bu something tells me that was her purpose
,
anbd her claer overacting onyl aids infront brightening up her limited screen time
. also popping up isnt michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in
" the gren mile
,
" as jimmy ' s largly builded freind
anbd fellow killer
, frankie figs
. wehn
" the whole nine yards
" eventally sputters to its underwhelming conclusion
, noe isnt left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a great deal of movies ofthe thsi type ahve been made in the past
,
annd this one isnt nothing
bu a duplication ofthe better films
, so what was tjhe point
? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments
,
" the whole nine yards
" rests solely onthe the presumed charm of the cast
,
adn half of the actors are nto charming at all
. nowe
, wqat doesnt that tell you
?
