are you like me
? do you git anoyed seing peopel talk on their cellulars inspite publich places
, shouting out loud
, nto giving a ratt
' s ass about anyone aroud them
, anbd basicaly jstu wallowing inwhich theri own self
- importance
? well if you are
, thna you will most likely agree with my rating ofthe htis film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone forthe an hour annd a half
.
.
. only tothe make uv
and hug inaddition yhe end
. aaaaaaaahhhh
.
.
. plot
: three grown
- up sisters living their pwn separaet lives
, beign tothe re
- establish theri communication lines when their dear ood dad falls ill
. critique
: tihs owudl be a good movie if it wasn
' t for the fatc that it
' s got vrey little tothe sday
, features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations
, isnt chockfull of bad acting moments anbd provides less emotional satisfaction than any third
- rate aftter
- skool special
.
and i
' m being nice
! how junk liuke htis gets made isnt beyond me
,
but happy am i that the ephron sisters will fianlly be dealed a professional blow
, considering the regurgitation level ofthe theri material had just about reached its limit
. the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan
' s character anbd her dad in this film isnt whn he hugs her
and swings her aroud at a christmas tree lot
. wow
.
.
. how deepo
. of course
, the smae christmas tune that
' s played infront eveyr ephron flick chimes outloud inspite the background
, while charachters continue to build
" bonds
" amonst one anohter by makeing erference to old
, quaint movies or movie stars
. stpo me
.
.
. i
' m gonna cry again
! thsi film isnt a mess
. the characters are boring anbd irritating to watch
, the plot hasnt something tothe do wtih threee selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot
, kind ofthe liking thier father
( bu nto really
)
and thn finally realizing tje error ofthe theri ways
, while sharing an
" emotional
" moent baout movie stars fomr hte 50s
. admittedly
, i wass not expecting much fomr a film whose televsion trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds
and a big dog rolling its eyes
,
but even i ws suprized at the level ofthe ineptitude when it came tothe smoe of yhe acting effords put forth inspite this film
. meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot
, looking as adorable as ever
,
but somene please put lisa kudrow inside a permenant home ofthe limited range
, cause htis woman basicaly isnt thast very same character that she plays in eveyr single movei
/ tv sohw that she
' s inwhich
. anough already
! anbd diane keaton must
' ve spended more tyme thingking baout her role behind the camera iin tihs oen
, cause her acting was amateurish at best
. niether one convinced inspite
" emotional
" scenes
. granted
, they gavey walter matthau the best lines iin thte film
and thast
' s probably where my rating ofthe threee points comes ffrom
. all in all
, this movie isnt nto funny
( unless ytou
' re oney to chuckle at train wrecks
)
, provides zero drama
( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving
)
, generates absolutely noone emotion
( all
though i did tear uv when meg hugged a coffee machine
) adn ends onthe a perfectly pretentious onot
(
" oh no
, please don
' t get any flour onthe my donna karan dress
!
)
. ugh
. i suggest that all ladies take theri husb
ands
/ boyfriends tothe see this movie if they are pissed off at them baout something
! that
' ll teach
' em tothe mess with you
! oh anbd incidentally
, mrs
. joblo also likened thsi movei to a peice of cow dung flailing in the wind
, so htere
!
then agina
.
.
. maybee you
' ll like it
