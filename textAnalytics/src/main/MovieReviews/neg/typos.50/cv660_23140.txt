are you like me
? do yuo get anoyed seeing peopel talk onthe thier cellulars in publich places
, shouting out loud
, nto giving a ratt ' s ass about anyone arround them
,
anbd basically just wallowing infact their pwn self
- importance
? well if ytou are
, than yuo wiull most likely agree wiht my rating ofthe this film sicne it basicaly features a trio ofthe annoying ladies bickering awya on the phone fo an hour
and a half
.
.
. onyl tothe mkae uv
annd hug in the end
. aaaaaaaahhhh
.
.
. plot
: three grown
- uv sisters living thier own seaprate lives
, begin to re
- establish their communiation lines whn thier dear old dad falls ill
. critique
: thsi would be a good movie if it wasn ' t fo the fatc that it ' s got very littel tothe sday
, features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations
, is chockfull of bad acting moments
and provides less emotional satisfaction than any thrid
- rate affter
- school special
.
anbd i ' m being nice
! how junk like htis gets made isnt beyond me
,
but happy am i that the ephron sisters wiull fianlly be dealed a professional blow
, concidering tje regurgitation levle ofthe their material hadnt just baout reached its limitate
. the onyl true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan ' s character
annd her dad in this film isnt whn he hugs her
and swings her arund at a christmas tree lot
. wow
.
.
. how deep
. ofthe course
, tje smae christmas tune thgat ' s played inwhich every ephron flick chimes outloud inaddition the background
, hwile cahracters continue tothe build
" bonds
" amung one anohter by making refference tothe old
, quaint movies or movie stars
. stop me
.
.
. i ' m gonna cry again
! this film isnt a mess
. hte characters are boring
anbd irritating tothe watch
, the plot has something tothe do wiht threee selfish sisters tlaking onthe teh phone a wohle lot
, kind ofthe liking theri father
(
but nto really
)
and
thne finally realizing thge error of thier ways
, hwile sharing an
" emotional
" moent about movei stars from thte 50s
. admitedly
, i was nto expecting much fomr a film whose televsion trailer features meg ryan screaming eveyr two seconds
adn a big dog rolling its eyes
,
but even i was surprised at the level ofthe ineptitude whn it cameback to smoe ofthe the acting efforts put forth iin tihs film
. meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot
, looking as adorable as ever
,
but somene please put lisa kudrow inside a permenant hmeo of limited range
, cause htis woman basicaly is thast very same character that she plays inthe every single movie
/ tv show tyhat she ' s inaddition
. anough already
!
adn diane keaton must ' ve spended more time thinking baout her role behind the camera in tihs one
, cause her acting was amateurish at best
. niether one conviced inspite
" emotional
" scenes
. granted
, htey gave walter matthau the best lines in the film
and that ' s probably where my rating ofthe three points comes ffrom
. all in all
, this movei is nto funny
( unless yuo ' re oney to chuckle at turain wrecks
)
, provides zero drama
( unless you concider loud phone conversations moving
)
, generates absolutely noone emotion
(
althought i did tear uv wehn meg hugged a coffee machine
)
adn ends on a perfectly pretentious note
(
" oh no
, please don ' t git any flour onthe my donna karan dress
!
)
. ugh
. i suggest tht all ladies tkae their husbands
/ boyfriends to see htis movie if they are pissed off at them about something
! that ' ll teach ' em tothe mess with ytou
! oh
and incidentally
, mrs
. joblo alsot likened this movie tothe a piece of cow dung flailing iin tjhe wind
, so htere
!
then agina
.
.
. maeby yuo ' ll like it
.
