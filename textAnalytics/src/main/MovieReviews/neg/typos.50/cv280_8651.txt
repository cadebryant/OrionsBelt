capsule
: lesbianism examined inaddition the smae hushed adn reverential tones reserved for a terminal ilness
. potentially interesting idae made stagy anbd boring
. claire of the moon isnt such an impossibly sereous adn sober movie tyhat i ws waiting forthe somone tothe snese
, just tothe break the ice
. it
' s a perfect example ofthe wqat my wief calls an s
. f
. e
. movie
, where s
. f
. e
. means so f
*
*
* ing earnest
. movies like htis need wit anbd brashness tothe be absorbing
. claire isnt one strained speach after anyother
, written delivered with all of the energy
and spontenaity ofthe a dmv clerk
. claire takes twpo women
, claire anbd noel
, both writers
,
and throws them together in thge smae cabin at a womens
- onyl writer
' s retreat
. claire wrights ight comedy
, hwile noel is a scholarly authority on porn adn sexual behavior
. obviously
, the two of them are going tothe haev plenty tothe talk about
,
and forthe hte entire oen hundred anbd twelve insufferable mintues of tihs movie
, that
' s all they do
: talk
. tghe movei sets uv its
( microscopic
) plot wih beat
- a
- dead
- horse
- into
- glue obviousness
. the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly tipe named maggie
, a self
- professed lesbian
,
and whn noel owns uv to also being a lesbian
, claire looks liek she
' s been hitted withthe a sockful of wet s
and
. the movie
then quickly degenerates inot lots ofthe scenes where noel glances at claire wtih signifigance
,
and claire looks out over the water reflectively
.
( ugh
!
) the most amazing thing baout tghe movie is how peple so intteligent can talk so much annd yot git so littel through theri thick heads
. all ofthe tihs
, ofthe course
, leads uv tothe a scene of complete inevitability
: claire
and nole
, inthe a scene that shoud hvae come an hour earlier
, because
then tghe movei ends wihtout even the benifit ofthe reflection about waht
' s jsut happened
. we never get a hint baout how any of tihs hasnt changed anyone
, onyl how tehy felt baout things that didn
' t even happen
yet
. the problem with claire
.
.
. isnt not lesbianism as such
,
but tje leaden way it
' s h
andled
. why is it that any
" sereous
"
( a better word would be adult or at least
thoughtful
) examination of sex inwhich a movie almost always winds uv producing a movie that
' s unwatchably boring
? tjhe way htis movie deals withthe lesbianism
, we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids
. many other movies haev used thge smae subject in ways thgat are a thous
and times better
-
- moreso engaging
, omre creative
, more intellectually anbd artistically interesting
. look at john sayles
' lianna
, or thte intresting
and littel
- seen dezert bloom
; both of them have more life anbd vibrancy tahn claire
. what thsi movei needed was a ogod swift kick inaddition the pants
.
