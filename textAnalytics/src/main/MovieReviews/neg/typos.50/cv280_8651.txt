capsule
: lesbianism examined infact the smae hushed
and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illess
. potentially intresting idea made stagy
adn boring
. claire ofthe the moon is such an impossibly sereous
and sober movie that i was waiting for somone to snese
, just to break the ice
. it ' s a perfect exmaple of waht my wief calls an s
. f
. e
. movei
, where s
. f
. e
. means so f
*
*
* ing earnest
. movies like tihs need wit
and brashness to be absorbing
. claire is one strained speach aftter anyother
, written delivered withthe all of tje energy
anbd spontenaity ofthe a dmv clerk
. claire tkaes twpo womens
, claire
and neol
, both writers
,
and throws them toghether iin the smae cabin at a womens
- only writer ' s retreat
. claire wrights light comedy
, while noel is a scholarly authorithy onthe porn
annd sexual behavior
. obviously
, the twpo ofthe them are gonig to have plenty tothe talk about
,
and for tyhe entire oney hundered
adn twelve insufferable mintues of this movei
, that ' s all they do
: talk
. the movie sets up its
( microscopic
) plot wtih beated
- a
- dead
- horse
- into
- glue obviousness
. tghe evening talks at thge camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie
, a self
- proffesed lesbian
,
adn when nole owns up tothe allso bieng a lesbian
, claire looks like she ' s been hitted wiht a sockful of wet sand
. the movie
thn quicklyu degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire witht signifigance
,
and claire looks outloud over the water reflectively
.
( ugh
!
) the most amazing thign about the movie is how peopel so intelligent can talk so much
and
yet get so little through theri thick heads
. all of this
, ofthe course
, leads up to a scene ofthe complete inevitability
: claire
annd neol
, inaddition a scene thgat should have come an hour ealier
, because
then the movei ends without even yhe benifit ofthe reflection baout waht ' s jsut happended
. we never get a hint about how any of htis hasnt changed anyone
, onyl how they falt about things that didn ' t even happen
yot
. the probelm with claire
.
.
. isnt nto lesbianism as such
,
bu teh leaden way it ' s handled
. why isnt it that any
" serious
"
( a better owrd would be adult or at least thoughtful
) examination of sex inthe a movei almsot always winds uv producing a movei tht ' s unwatchably boring
? tyhe way this movei deals with lesbianism
, we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama baout aids
. many otehr movies have unsed teh smae subject inaddition ways tath are a thousand times better
-
- omre engaging
, more creative
, more intellectually
adn artistically intresting
. look at john sayles ' lianna
, or the intresting
and little
- seen dezert bloom
; both of them have more life
and vibrancy tahn claire
. what this movei needed ws a ogod swift kick in tjhe pants
.
