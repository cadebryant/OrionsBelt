synopsis
: a small twon thug convinces a dimwitted high
- skool student tothe spy onthe his girlfriend
, who isnt babysitting three unruly kids for theri alcoholic parents on a friday night
. while tihs is oging on
, the thug
, the father
, tje boyfriend
, anbd a kid reaching tjhe onset ofthe puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter
. comments
: tothe sday tihs movei is bad woudl be quite an understatement
. i
' m nto sure wqat writer
and directer ferl
and ws hoping tothe acomplish wih the babysitter
. suspense
? family drama
? humor
? erotica
? elements of each ofthe theese genres exsist inaddition teh film
, yot it fails to sucesfuly achieve any ofthe them
. instead
, the babysitter isnt a dull
, lifeless movie which manages tothe bore annd ultimatly irritate its viewers
. i supose this film sould hve beeen watchable if it weren
' t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone isnt completely wasted palying jennifer
, the babysitter
. her character hasnt absolutly noone depth at all
, anbd her sole purpose in tjhe movei is to be the object ofthe tghe other characters
' fantasies
. everyone else in the film seems tothe be in a competition tothe see who cxan stoop tothe yhe lowest level by the timne the film ends
. yhe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds
. tjhe father
( played by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes about tjhe babysitter
; the mother fantasizes baout her husban
' s best freind
. none ofthe these fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are thnigs that need to be seen
,
but we see them anyway
, complete withthe cheesy
, amking
- out saksaphone music
. thte thug
, in yhe meantime
, proves tht he
' s evil thru his annoying hebit ofthe smashing half
- empty beer bottles all ofthe a sudden annd fo no apparent reason
. the most absurd character
,
however
, is tjhe babysitter
' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. the thug
, inwhich a manipulative
, iago
- like manner
(
though he doesn
' t really need to try hard
)
, manages tothe talk the boyfriend into binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, running awya from cops
, adn playing peeping toom onthe his pwn girlfriend infront a matter ofthe minutes
. incredible
!
( of course
, the boyfriend
' s original plan for the evening was
, try not to laff
, to sit inaddition an empty diner
and read catcher in tjhe rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if thge goal ofthe the babysitter ws tothe be suspenseful
, thn it fails
. ther are suprisingly faw tense moments inwhich thsi film
, annd nearly all of them come at the final minute
. by that time
, howver
, thge audiance is so tired ofthe the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them
. no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence ffrom its insepsion
. if tghe goal ofthe the babysitter was tothe be humorous
, hten it also fails
. i foudn nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, to be played fo laughs
. if tje goal of tjhe babysitter was to be dramtic
, thn
, once agian
, it fails
. the charachters are one
- dimesnional
and uninteresting
. fianlly
, if tyhe gool of the babysitter was to be titillating
( the type ofthe film destined tothe be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning
)
, hten it fails as well
. yhe dream sequences aren
' t erotic
; tehy are too brief
and
, outside of oen very short scene
, contain noone nudity
. i can
' t completely trash this movie
. the frist 10 mintues or so vaguely resemble an intresting film
, adn thge conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight
. thge otehr 79 mintues
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone
' s character
, at the end of the movei
, turns tothe her boyfriend adn asks
" what were ytou thikning
?
" i asked myself tjhe smae question
, having spent 99 cents renting this turkey
.
