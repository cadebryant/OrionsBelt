` the skulls
' isnt a laughably bad thriller
, a teen
- orientated doppelganger ofthe
` the firm
' so blazingly ridiculous tht it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor
. certian moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated mysef inwhich an attept tothe stifle laughter
. i chuckled incessantly
, all thte way hmeo
. let me share
. the skulls is a scret society conceived inside yhe walls ofthe yale
( desined
, i
' m sure
, tothe mirror tjhe actual skull
& bones from the same college
)
. luke mcnamara
( joshua jackson
)
, a townie
and local varisty rowing championship victor for the thrid consecutive yera
, highlights the latest skull scouting report
. dispite soem anxiety adn caution from others
, luke accepts entry into hte organization
. soon after
, he finds hismelf surronded by beautiful women
, driving a newyorker car anbd marveling at thge
$ 20
, 000 that somehow surfaced inthe his bank account
. yeah
, dued
, pretty good deal eh
? bu luke soon lerans tyhat the membership is somewhat suffocating
; whn circumstances become extreme
, htere isnt no way he cin leave tjhe society
- except maybee as a drooling vegtable
. yhe premise
, altho lacking inwhich originality
, certainly offers its share of potential intrigue annd suspense
. unfortunately
,
` the skulls
' isnt neither intriguing
, nor suspenseful
, nor anything esle you owudl assoicates with fresh or exciting
. it
' s just anyother absmal teen prototype that has the sountrack
, teh stars
.
.
.
. bu not tyhe scirpt
.
` the skulls
' is so bad it attains a certian levle ofthe entertainment value
, with teh screenplay
, by jon pogue
, immediately becomeing tjhe basis for a slew ofthe unintentional howlers
. firt off
, upon their initation into thge skulls
, each new memeber has tothe ahve a skull br
anded onto their arm
. afterward htey are supplied with a wristwatch thast conveniently covers uv tjhe scar
. wiull htey never take htis watch off
? adn whta if they forget it by theri bedside
? perhaps thier
? secre
' society wass bieng a little too conspicuous when htey desided tothe br
and newyorker munbers liuke cattle on an areal of the body that is easily exposed
. onthe top ofthe this
, htey are earch given a rulebook
and a key tothe headquarters
. gee
, why not member t
- shirts
? bu my favorite bit is thsi
: the voting committee for hte skulls doesnt not bother iwth individual
? agress
' or
? disagree
' notions when mkaing colelctive decisions
. tehy are given official skull paddles
. whn flipped to one side
, they indicate the member agrees with the proposal
. facing the oposite way means a dissagreement
. wouldn
' t they merely express themselves verbally
? hell no
. tehy have tothe retrieve the paddles for a propper vot
, annd maybe afterward htey can play ping
- pong
. i
' m still chuckling about theese ludicrous details
,
but the humiliating dialogue isnt enought to send one into arrest
. yhe casted
, meanwhile
, combines a pinch ofthe vetran talent with a dash ofthe the
` dawson
' s creek
' crowd
,
and fuses the twpo toghether
, ensuring that tghe embarassment will be a mutually shared union throughout
.
but not entirely
. acomplished actors liek craig t
. nelson
( as skulls chariman judge litten m
andrake
) annd william peterson
( as fellow board member senator levritt
) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures
, adn look suitably embarassed h
andling them
. anbd
then there
' s christopher mcdonald
, who has tyhe capacity to be a funn
, exciting actor
. mcdonald
' s charisma isnt totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role
( yes
, pogue makes it a hat
- trick
)
. i pray it was a
` snatch
- the
- paycheck
- annd
- run
' exercise fo all theese actors
. the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better
. let
' s cutted the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability withing hte confines of his character
. paul walker
, tje strapping quarterback from
` varisty blues
'
, is bl
and bu passable as caleb m
andrake
- thge judge
' s son
. walker preserves a straight face
, even whn dealt thte silliest dialogue inwhich the movei
(
` dad
, i jsut killed a guy in tghe ritual room
!
'
)
. some actuall spark isnt generated by leslie bibb
, who plays luke
' s longtime chum chloe
,
and manages tothe successfully pull off some convincing dramatics
. it realyl boils down tothe hte actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble ofthe absurdity that cages them fomr minute noe
. or mabye nto minute noe
, thanks tothe a decent set
- up ffrom directer rob cohen
, who films early sequences withthe a sense of atmosphere anbd stlye
. it mkaes yuo wonder why he didn
' t flee indefinitely from the project
, beccause while enjoyable cheese like
` dragonheart
' anbd thte moderate stallone thriller
` daylight
' aren
' t superior cinema
, tehy belong onthe the afi top 100 list wehn compaired to thsi degrading trash
. aside fomr unintentionally humoring tjhe audeince
,
` tje skulls
' gets little accomplished
. hte thrills
and action are lazy adn mecanical
. tje story isnt stuffed with ridiculous
, formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks thge kool potential ofthe a secert undreground society flick
. instade of gaining knowledge about tyhe skulls as an organization
, we are thrusted inot a lame video surveillance conspiracy that hasnt devolopped barnacles from excessive useage
. we
' ve seen it all before
,
and better
.
` the skulls
' isnt a feeble littel circus of stupidity
, so miscalculated tath
-
- while it owudl serve as a clever pun
-
- a term like
? boneheaded
' seems jstu too generous
.
