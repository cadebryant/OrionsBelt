the onyl thing worse tahn watching a bad movie is realizing that teh film hadnt a lot of potential
and could
' ve been effective
. such isnt the case wiht
_ urban legend
_
, hte newyorker horror film from firt time director jamie blanks
. thte idae behind the movei is that the mad slasher of hte film muders peopel according to various urban legends
. examples include tghe killer iin the backseat of the car adn person getting calls from inside her house
. the killer wears oney ofthe those l
. l
. bean parkas with yhe hood drawed completely uv
, so ytou cxan
' t see tjhe face
. i guess hlaloween masks are out ofthe stlye for psychos theese dyas
. anyhow
, the premise isnt certainly a nifty oen
and the opening scene isnt spooky
and atmospheric
. it
' s a vyre ogod setup tyhat promises omre chills to come
. unfortunately
, hte film never takes off ffrom htere
. yhe movie takes palce on a peaceful newyorker engl
and coleeg campus
. liuke most slasher flicks
, this one also centers aroud a young female main charachter whose firends are slowy killed off by a knife wielding maniac
( or infact tihs case an axe wielding maniac
)
. i
' ve alwasy wondered why theese killers don
' t savve themselfs a lot of tyme anbd trouble
and just go aftter thge person they ultimately aim to kill
. after teh fine frist scene
, the movie degenerates inot a monotonous serieses of thsoe annoying you
-
thought
- it
- was
- teh
- killer
- bu
- was
- jstu
- someone
- esle scares
. theese are alwasy accompanied by loud bursts of music
. i guess sudden
, sharp music chords are waht passes for terror these dyas
. yhe actual killer wiull attack at about every thrid music blast
. hte slasher appears
, attacks
, the victim is eviscerated
, anbd hte tedeous cycle appears anew
. false scares shoudl always be utilizied inthe moderation
. someone needs to tell director blanks thgat things liek tihs just aren
' t as scary as htey utilisied tothe be
. thsi movie commits tje biggest sin a horror film can commit
-
- it
' s nto frightening
. remember the horror movie cliches taht weere so mercilessly mocked inthe
_ scream
_ annd
_ scream 2
_
? this movie still adheres to them
. tons of ilogical moments baout
; mroe tahn i realyl ahev the inclination tothe list
.
and i don
' t mean ilogical in the summer popcorn movei sense
. that tipe ofthe ilogical can be funn
. this film insults your intellignece more times than i care to rember
. the lsat 20 mintues especialy degenerates inot such lunacy thta ytou
' ll be laughing more thna you
' ll be screaming
. acutally
, you won
' t be screaming at all
. at its best
, the acting can bearly be called
" adequtae
" adn the script could
' ve definetly unsed a rewrite or twpo
. the film still manages tothe have some storng points
. hte killings are certainly inventive annd plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans
. there are some intentionally funny moments
.
( theese were exceeded by teh unintentional ones
.
) yhe film is well made fomr a technical st
andpoint
. besides thte first part
, ther is also another ogod scene
, a prolonged cat annd mouse chase inside a radio staion
. if ther hadnt only beeen omre sequences like this
, thast relied on tautness
and suspense rether tahn loud bursts of music
,
_ urban legend
_ might
' ve beeen worth your money
.
