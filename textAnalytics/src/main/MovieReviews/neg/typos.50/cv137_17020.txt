hte only hting worse than watching a bad movie isnt realizing that the film hadnt a lot ofthe potential
annd coudl ' ve been effective
. such isnt tghe case wiht
_ urban legend
_
, the new horror film ffrom frist tiem director jamie blanks
. the idae behind the movie is tht yhe mad slasher ofthe the film muders people according to vairous urban legends
. examples inlcude teh killer infront the backseat ofthe the car
and person getting calls fomr inside her house
. the killer wears oney of thsoe l
. l
. bean parkas with thte hood drawn completelyl uv
, so you can ' t see teh face
. i guess hallwoeen masks are outloud ofthe style for psychos these days
. anyhow
, hte premise isnt certainly a nifty one
annd tghe oppening scene is spooky
anbd atmospheric
. it ' s a very ogod setup that promises mroe chills tothe cmo
. unfortunatly
, the film never tkaes off fomr htere
. the movie tkaes palce onthe a peaceful newyorker england college cumpus
. like most slasher flicks
, this noe also centers arround a young female main character whose firends are slowy killed off by a knife wielding maniac
( or in thsi case an axe wielding maniac
)
. i ' ve always wondered why these killers don ' t save themselfs a lot of timne
anbd trouble
adn jstu go after the person tehy ultimatly aim tothe kill
. affter the fine frist scene
, thge movie degenerates into a montanous series of those annoying ytou
- throught
- it
- ws
- hte
- killer
-
bu
- was
- jstu
- someone
- else scares
. theese are always accompanyed by loud bursts of music
. i guess sudden
, sharp music chords are whta passes for terror theese dyas
. thte actual killer will attack at about eveyr third music blast
. the slasher appears
, attacks
, hte victum isnt eviscerated
,
anbd thge tedious cycle appears anew
. false scares shoudln allways be unsed in moderation
. somone needs tothe tell director blanks that thigsn liuke thsi just aren ' t as scarry as tehy used to be
. this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit
-
- it ' s not frightening
. remember the horror movei cliches thta weere so mercilessly mocked in
_ scream
_
adn
_ scream 2
_
? tihs movie still adheres tothe them
. tons of ilogical moments about
; omre than i relaly ahev tghe inclination tothe list
.
anbd i don ' t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sence
. tyhat type of illogical cant be fun
. this film insults your intelligence moreso times thna i care tothe remember
. tghe last 20 minutes especially degenerates inot such lunacy that yuo ' ll be laughing more thna you ' ll be screaming
. actually
, ytou won ' t be screaming at all
. at its best
, tje acting cxan bearly be called
" adequte
"
and thge scirpt sould ' ve definitely used a rewrite or twpo
. the film still manages to ahev smoe storng points
. tje killings are certainly inventive
anbd plentiful enought tothe satistfy most gore fans
. htere are smoe intentionally funny moments
.
( theese were excedded by teh unintentional ones
.
) the film isnt well made fomr a technical standpoint
. besides tjhe firt part
, there isnt also anohter ogod scene
, a prolonged cat
and mouse chase inside a radio staion
. if ther had only been more sequences like this
, tath relied on tautness
and suspense rather tahn loud bursts ofthe music
,
_ urban legend
_ might ' ve beeen worth your moey
