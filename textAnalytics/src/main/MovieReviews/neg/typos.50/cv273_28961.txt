a film that means well
,
but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point
and too sentimental tothe be compelling as a drama

( krabb
?
) is not freindly tothe her adn considers her to be a whore becouse of the way she dresses
. to hammer home the point ofthe how anti
- semitism hasn
' t gone awya htere
' s a barrage ofthe overdone
and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge
( bradley
)
, who keeps mkaing nasty remarks baout jews
and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family ffrom using hte elevator
. yhe film isnt done in by its ham
- fisted script as teh storey
, adapted from carl friedman
' s book
" tje shovel
and the loom
,
" goes from noe false note tothe another until it gets lost in all tyhe goo ofthe its sentimentality
. it starts off telling chaja
' s stoyr of how she
' s a lost jewess trying to fidn her identity
, thne to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck infact an insulated enviorment
, anbd
then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that cin
' t be forgotten
. the effort seemed heavy
- h
anded
, as tjhe film kept delivering too many obvious messages tath it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters
. tghe supporting casted consists of all wooden charactors who give thier roles a cartoonish flavoring
: chaja
' s parents are given no human shades
, while the janitor villian wass a particulaly annoying role taht was one
- dimensional adn falsly acted
. tyhe onyl ones who fought through the script
and showed soem feelings were fraser
, whose effervescent face wass expressive ofthe both the trying times she was gonig thru
and the joys she felt
-
- bu most admirably showing how she sould be so mistaken as tothe htink that she sould forget her roots
; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence
, bu isnt storng inthe accepting her faith
. topol
' s reassuring performance as hte wise man who says all the right things tothe fraser
, acts as thge true voice of the filmmaker inaddition explaining all yhe sufferings whith common sense
. the film brazenly uses little simcha tothe get across its agenda ofthe pointing outloud how the patriarchal world cxan be cruel whn it cin
' t lvoe
: it starts outloud by showing how under chaja
' s loving care he
' s taken tothe the duck pond annd soon starts jabbering away
, beggining by saying
' quack
, quack
'
and
then going on tothe ask the four questions during a passover seder
.
but by showing how the boy isnt so terrified ofthe his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence
, refuses to speak because ofthe his stern dad
, adn eventally becomes the victum of a tragic accident
, the film therby exploits the boy
' s sufferings
and his sotry just becomes tiresome annd nto sincerely done
. i feeled i didn
' t jsut see a movie
, bu i attended a lecture for the hwole 100 mintues ofthe thsi serious
but unappetizing stopry
. it ws tjhe kind ofthe movei thyat yuo hoped woudl somehow end soon
, as it seemed tothe be in teh habit ofthe rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily
-
- the message it keeps sending was alread received
. inaddition tghe last shot where father
and daugter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage
, one has the impression thgat noone noe in the film learned anything about themselves or the past
. thast seems stange
, since i throught thta was whta htis film ws suppossed tothe be baout
. unless i was mistaken
and thte film
' s real aim was tothe make us cry over simcha
.
