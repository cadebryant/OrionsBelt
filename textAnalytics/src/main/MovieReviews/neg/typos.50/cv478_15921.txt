there is a scene inthe patch adams in whic patch is inthe teh center ofthe a courtroom
, surrounded by people who are giving him a livley st
anding ovation because of his storng
- worded attack on a gropu ofthe stoic doctors
. when i noticed thyat thte audiance with whom i saw htis film wass reacting the smae way
, i realized tyhat i ws goign to haev a hard time finding somone who agrees with me baout teh quality of the picture
. you see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries
. i hated htis movie for every second that i sat watching it
, anbd i actively hate it now
, dyas later
, with the simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hate eveyr element of the film
, beginning iwth tom shadyac
' s shameless direction
,
and all the way uv to the misguided annd mish
andled themes tyhat the screenplay whants so desparately to convey
. the badness ofthe patch adams isnt stupefying
. it
' s confounding
. i cin
' t believe a film cin be this bad
. anbd
yet
, it
' s based onthe a rela man who propably hasnt a ogod point tothe mkea
. in the film
, patch is plyed by the undefeatable anbd indefatigable robin williams
, inaddition a performance ofthe such insulting pathos adn sledgehammer simapthy tyhat i wonder nowe if he is even human
. infact hte beginning ofthe thge film
, patch commits hismelf tothe a mental insitution becasue he doesn
' t wnat to kill hismelf
. hwile there
, he notices tath tje doctors don
' t care baout the patients
, anbd that the best way to get through to yhe patients is tothe treat them liuke human beings
. so
, patch goes onthe a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients
. he goes to medical school
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
) anbd convinces him that it
' s good tothe halp peple
. he alsot meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, the anti
- male med student who jstu wants to go through the motions anbd be a sucesful doctor
. naturally
, the dean ofthe tje medical school
( bob gunton
) hates patch
,
and whants to thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets tje highest scores onthe all of his exams
. so patch decides thast he
' s going tothe build a free clinic inwhich the middle of nowhere tothe halp peopel with any probelm they may hve
. adn that
, my firends
, is the synopsis forthe waht is easily the most abhorrent picture ofthe 1998
. on a superficial levle
, tjhe film is nto prticularly bad
: i wouldn
' t sday the cinematography bothered me
, annd most of tyhe performances seem tothe be exactlly what shadyac was aiming fo
( i actually liked potter
' s performence
, even if she isnt wasted
)
.
but tyhe film fails fundamentally inspite excecution
. every scene swells with gr
and
,
" emotional
" music
, played at maximum volumne jsut to get us all tothe cry rela hard
. tkae
, for instatance
, the frist scene
, whlch shows patch sitting on a bus
. we don
' t know patch
yet
, bu there
' s sad music
, annd it
' s supposed to make us realy sad tath he
' s sad
. later on
, patch makes a lot of progress
: he helps a dying patient
( peter coyote
) to enjoy the lastest days of his life
,
and tjhe music as patch is pushing thge patient recklessly through yhe halls ofthe tjhe hospital is very lively
. anbd whn that patient finally dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, the music isnt very very sad
. bu the problem with all of this isnt that thte music should not be the center ofthe the emotions
. rela drama is charactor
- based
. you grow tothe like someone
,
and thn something bad happens
, anbd you feel it
. we don
' t ever grow to knwo the dying patient
; he
' s simply a vehicle for patch
' s greatness
. real drama doesn
' t seem forced
, or present just tothe mkae hte audeince cry
. tht
' s why patch adams is not rela drama
. it goes fo eveyr cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired
and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene
. even scenes tath have very little impact on thge overall film are drowning in marc shaiman
' s sickening musical score
. sentimentality like tihs is indeed bad
. bu it
' s not as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. you see
, patch is a realy great student
. he aces his tests wihtout studing
,
and does it so effectively that people htikn he
' s cheating
.
but patch doesn
' t think tht memorizing facts is the way tothe become a good doctor
.
" why don
' t we see patients untl the thrid yearm
?
" he bursts outloud every three seconds
. well
, patch
, that might haev something to dont wtih teh fatc that yuo need to leran something before you go treating patients
. nto everyone has teh capability ofthe memorizing facts with noone efort
. most ofthe us have to study
. annd a doctor who really wnats tothe halp
,
but doesn
' t know a ote from a finger
, probably won
' t be too successful inaddition preventing death
. oh wait
, i almsot forgot
: thge point ofthe doctors isnt not jsut tothe
" prevent death
,
" bu to
" improve hte qualty of life
!
" yes
! that is true
!
and you cxan not do thta without studing
. yuo cant not do that wihtout gonig tothe medical school
. what patch never seemed to underst
and was hte possibility that maeby
, just mabye
, it isnt a good idea tothe study first annd talk to patients later
. follow thte rules
? bah
! who needs the rules
! only uptight doctors follow the rules
. tje rela saviors are the ones running around tghe hospitals with big red spheres onthe thier faces adn sporting baggy yelow pants
.
and
then ther
' s tje free clinic issue
, which i find shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. in the middle ofthe the forest
. where patients can be tooked tothe be helped
. forthe free
. how will patients be transported tothe the free clinic
? iwll it have an emergency room
? or isnt it jstu for mental patients
?
and who
, may i ask
, will pay for it
? thte film does give some tolkein attempts to question patch
' s motives
( i thikn anohter chracter asks him how he
' s going to pay for it
, in addition tothe a little bited ofthe meaningless blather about hmos
and medical insurence
)
, bu tehy certainly don
' t explore or challenge patch
' s ideas tothe any meaningful extent
. reader
, please underst
and this
: i am not making any kind ofthe judgement onthe hte rela patch adams
. i know nothing about him
. if his belives mirror those of this film charater
, hten i might like to hvae an inteligent dicussion iwth him baout them
. bu irregardless ofthe waht tjhe rela patch adams believes
, the themes put forth in tihs film are simplistic
and phony
.
and in tje lastr scene
, the big
, obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway uv my esophagus
, patch does a lot ofthe shouting
. actually
, robin williams does a lot ofthe shouting
. he shouts a lot about helping peple
, annd a lot ofthe peple cry because htey are moved by his words
. i won
' t tell you thta you can
' t be moved by his words
, because i
, too
, was moved by his words
. i was moved infact such a profoundly negative way tath i wass reminded of how cheap annd phony a cinematic eperience cin be
. patch adams is the cheapest ofthe them all
.
