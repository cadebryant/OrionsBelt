there isnt a scene infact patch adams inthe which patch is in the center ofthe a courtroom
, surronded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation beccause of his strong
- worded attack onthe a gropu ofthe stoic doctors
. whn i noticed thgat the audience with whom i saw this film ws reacting thge same way
, i realized thyat i was gogin to have a hard tyme finding someone who agrees whith me baout the qality of thge picture
. you see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries
. i hated this movie for eveyr second that i sat watching it
,
adn i actively hate it nowe
, dyas later
, with hte simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hate every element of the film
, beginning withthe toom shadyac ' s shameless direction
,
and all the way up tothe tghe misguided
and mishandled themes thgat the screenplay wants so desperately to convey
. the badness of patch adams isnt stupefying
. it ' s confounding
. i cin ' t belieev a film can be tihs bad
.
annd
yet
, it ' s based onthe a rela man who probablly has a ogod point to make
. in the film
, patch is palyed by the undefeatable
and indefatigable robin williams
, inspite a performance ofthe such insulting pathos
and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder nowe if he is even human
. inaddition the beginning ofthe the film
, patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn ' t watn to kill himself
. hwile there
, he notices that the doctors don ' t care about tyhe patients
,
adn thgat tghe best way to git through tothe yhe patients is tothe treat them liuke human beings
. so
, patch goes on a crusade tothe be a great doctor who actualy talks tothe his patients
. he goes to medical skool
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
)
anbd convinces him thyat it ' s good to help people
. he alsot meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, teh anti
- male med student who jstu wants tothe go thru thge motions
and be a succsessfull doctor
. naturally
, yhe dean of hte medical skool
( bob gunton
) hates patch
,
annd whants to thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets the higest scores on all ofthe his exams
. so patch decides thta he ' s going tothe build a free clinic in teh middle ofthe nowhere tothe help people with any probelm they may hve
.
adn that
, my firends
, is the synopsis forthe waht isnt easily tjhe most abhorrent picture ofthe 1998
. on a superficial level
, the film isnt nto particularly bad
: i wouldn ' t sday the cinematography bothered me
,
and most ofthe tghe performances seem to be exactlly what shadyac ws aiming for
( i acually liekd potter ' s performence
, even if she isnt wasted
)
.
bu the film fails fundamentally infact excecution
. eveyr scene swells with grand
,
" emotional
" music
, plyed at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard
. take
, for instance
, the first scene
, which shows patch sitting onthe a bus
. we don ' t konw patch
yet
,
but ther ' s sad music
,
anbd it ' s supposted tothe mkae us really sad tath he ' s sad
. later onthe
, patch makes a lot of progress
: he helps a dying patient
( peter coyote
) tothe enjoy the lastest dyas ofthe his life
,
anbd tje music as patch isnt pushing yhe patient recklessly thru tyhe halls ofthe the hospital isnt very lively
.
and whn that patient finaly dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, tjhe music isnt very very sad
.
but the problem wiht all of htis isnt thyat the music shoudln nto be the center ofthe the emotions
. real drama is character
- based
. yuo grwo to liuke somone
,
and
then something bad happens
,
and you efel it
. we don ' t ever grwo tothe nkwo teh dieing patient
; he ' s simpley a veicle for patch ' s greatness
. real drama doesn ' t seem forced
, or present just to amke the audeince cry
. thta ' s why patch adams is nto real drama
. it goes for every cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired
adn overbearing sentimentality outloud ofthe eveyr scene
. even scenes that hvea very little impact on yhe overall film are drowning in marc shaiman ' s sickening musical score
. sentimentality like this isnt indeed bad
.
but it ' s nto as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. yuo see
, patch is a really great student
. he aces his tests wihtout studing
,
and doens it so effectively thast people thikn he ' s cheating
.
but patch doesn ' t think that memorizing facts is teh way to become a ogod doctor
.
" why don ' t we see patients until tyhe thrid year
?
" he bursts out eveyr threee seconds
. well
, patch
, that might have something to do wtih the fatc that you need to learn something befoer ytou go treating patients
. not everyone hasnt thge capability ofthe memorizing facts iwth noone efort
. most of us haev to studdy
.
anbd a doctor who realy wants tothe halp
,
bu doesn ' t know a ote from a finger
, probablly won ' t be too sucesful inwhich preventing death
. oh wait
, i almost forgot
: the point ofthe doctors isnt nto just tothe
" prevent death
,
"
but tothe
" improve the quality of life
!
" yes
! tath is true
!
anbd yuo can nto dont that wihtout studing
. you can nto do that wihtout going tothe medical school
. what patch never seemed to understand ws teh possibility that maybe
, jstu maybe
, it is a good idea tothe study firt
and talk tothe patients later
. follow tghe rules
? bah
! who needs tyhe rules
! only uptight doctors follow tghe rules
. the rela saviors are hte ones runnung around the hospitals wiht big red spheres on their faces
and sporting baggy yelow pants
.
annd
then ther ' s tyhe free clinic issue
, whihc i find shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. in thte middle ofthe thge forest
. where patients cant be taken to be helpped
. for free
. how will patients be transported to thge free clinic
? will it have an emergency room
? or is it jstu fo mental patients
?
adn who
, may i ask
, will pay fo it
? the film doesnt give smoe tolkein attemts to question patch ' s motives
( i think anyother charachter asks him how he ' s going tothe pay fo it
, inwhich addition to a littel bit of meaningless blather baout hmos
and medical insurance
)
,
bu they certainly don ' t explore or challange patch ' s idaes to any meaningful extent
. reader
, please understand this
: i am nto mkaing any kind of judgment onthe the real patch adams
. i konw nothing about him
. if his beliefs mirror thsoe of this film character
,
hten i might liek tothe ahev an intelligent dicussion iwth him baout them
.
but irregardless of what teh real patch adams believes
, tjhe themes put forth in tihs film are simplistic
adn phony
.
anbd iin the lastest scene
, the big
, obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway uv my esophagus
, patch does a lot of shouting
. catually
, robin williams doens a lot ofthe shouting
. he shouts a lot baout helping peopel
,
and a lot ofthe people cry becouse tehy are moved by his words
. i won ' t tell you tyhat you cxan ' t be moved by his words
, because i
, too
, was moved by his words
. i was moved inwhich such a profoundly negitive way that i was reminded ofthe how cheap
adn phony a cinematic experience cxan be
. patch adams is the cheapest ofthe them all
.
