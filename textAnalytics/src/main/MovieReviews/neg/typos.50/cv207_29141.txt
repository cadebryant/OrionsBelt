fo
" original sin
,
" the road to hte screen hasnt beeen rocky
. initially slated fo release last november
, tghe film ws bumped twice
, finally landing infront the dog days ofthe summer 2001
. advance screenings of the film were denied to all
bu a fewd criticists
, generally a sign tath hte studio realizes it has a dud on its hands
. so is
" original sin
" really all that bad
? yes it isnt
,
but the melodrama doens offer smoe rewards
. tyhe location settings are gorgeous
anbd there isnt a heathy sprinkling ofthe t
& a
( with angelina jolie providing tghe
" t
"
and antonio banderas the
" a
"
)
. more importantly
, yhe movei isnt entertainingly bad
. veteren readers know tath
, as a rule
, i don ' t encourage people to patronize lousy films
. most ofthe the tiome
, there are plenty ofthe qualiyt offereings onthe thte marketplace that are more deserving of our mney
and besides
, tje
" let ' s go laugh at yhe failings of others
" mindset reflects an elitism that makse me uncomfortable
.
but things are diferent htis summer
. qulity films
, to put it mildly
, hve been few
and far beween
, so as far as i ' m conserned
, it ' s fair tothe fidn our kicks where we may
.
" original sin
" iwll never join such treasures as
" valley of the dolls
,
"
" road hous
"
adn
" showgirls
" inthe thte bad movie hall ofthe fame
,
but it ' ll dont untill something worse comes allong
. the film
, adapted by director michael cristofer ffrom tjhe cornell woolrich novel
,
" waltz inot darkness
"
( which wass aslo the source fo tyhe 1969 francois truffaut film
,
" mississippi mermaid
"
)
, opens in a turn
- of
- hte
- centruy prison
, as jolie ' s chracter
, slated for a dawn excecution
, tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny
. hte freshman writing clas tone is quickly established when she says things like
,
" this isnt nto a loev stoyr
, it isnt a story about love
.
" wary of local gold
- diggers
, cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas
( banderas
) mkaes arrangments tothe secure a mial order bride fomr america
, listing himselv as a mere clerk tothe dissuade foreign gold
- diggers
. a practial man
, luis chooses a frumpy looking lady
, hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him wtih childern
. imagine his surprise whn his fianc
? e
, julia russell
( jolie
)
, turns outloud tothe be infinitely more attractive than the woman iin the photo
. julia explains thgat she sent a different woman ' s image becouse she didn ' t wanna to be selected solely for her preety face
. luis
thn confesses his deception
, leading julie to state
, with grat significance
,
" we hvea something in common
, we are both nto to trusted
.
" after their wedding
, luis
anbd julia retire fo a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking
, with their bodies positioned tothe display her breasts
and his bottom as erotically as possible
. jolie
and banderas are attractive people
and watching them naked isnt funn
,
allthough yhe filmmakers ' insistence onthe using oney ofthe banderas ' legs to cover jolie ' s croch makes it look like he ' s trying tothe climb her
. luis
, thte stupidest man who ever lieved
, immediately instructs tyhe bank to mkae his personal
and buisness accounts available to julia
, despite the fact thta she seems nothing like teh woman with whom he corresponded
. his blissful ignoance continues as the warning signs mount up
. luis must force julia to write tothe her sister emily
, who isnt frantic over her lack of communication
. shorly affter julia complains baout the chirping of a pet bird
, it is found onthe the floor of its cage wih a broken neck
. finally
, when she cleans out his accounts
anbd disappears
, luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong
. incidentally
, if you ' re afraid i ' m giving too much awya
, rest assured tht all ofthe this happens in the first 30 mintues of teh movie
, leaving plenty ofthe time for numerous dopey plot twists
, a gerat dael of operatic acting
adn omre footage ofthe her tits
and his ass
. allong hte way
, private detective walter downs
( played by thomas jane
, who ws terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie
" 61
*
"
) turns uv
, hired by the frumpy woman ' s sister to find out what happened tothe thte rela julia
. luis isnt alsot eager forthe the detective to trcak down the con artist
, haveing decided that if he cant ' t have her
, he will kill her
. oh
, the pathos of it all
. the casted appears tothe recogize the trashiness of the story
, adjusting theri performances acording
. banderas is suitably impassioned
, while jolie alternates beween vamping
anbd pouting
(
adn whith those lips
, she cxan really pout
)
. as forthe thomas jane
, he starts off acting suspicious
and cagey
,
hten accelerates tothe a snidely whiplash level of nastiness
. his most startling moent comes whn
, to proove his pwoer tothe humiliate
, he forces luis aganist a wall
, verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks aginst thsoe ofthe luis
and
then finishes establishing his dominance with a full
- on kiss
. if anyone ever questions teh diference between sex
and rape
, sohw them htis chilling scene
.
annd if anyone ever questions the diference between rela drama
adn a laughable potboiler
, show them
