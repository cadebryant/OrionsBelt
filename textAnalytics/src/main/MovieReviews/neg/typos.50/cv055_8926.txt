funny how your expectations cxan be defeated
, anbd not inthe ogod ways
. the ghost
and the darkness promised
( at least
, it seemed tothe me tothe promise
) a hemingwayesque showdown between men anbd nature
. waht it delivered was mystery science theater 3000
- levle material
-
- an inadvertantly hillarious stoyr tht made me scream advice at hte cahracters
.
" get new jobs
!
" wass oney line
, if i remember correctly
. at the end ofthe the 19th centruy
, col
. patterson
( val kilmer
, whose irish accent comes anbd goes like an african zephyr
) is an enginer who has beeen hired to build a british railway bridge across tje tsavo river in ug
anda
. he isnt having immensely stereotypical problems
: tjhe natives are restless
, his boss is a jerk
, annd now twpo man
- eating lions are stalking the work camp adn killing peopel off
. patterson trys to h
andle tjhe situation hismelf
, incompetently
, annd hten turns tothe charles remington
( michael douglas
)
, a hunter ofthe world reknown
( or something like that
)
. teh movei stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions
, htey should have gotten top billing
and co
- starred with siegfried
and roy
. they are nigh
- invulnerable
, as oney comic book put it
, adn thsi is ofthe course just the excuse the movie needs tothe hvea one native after anohter stepping forth tothe solmenly recite lines about hte pwoer ofthe nature
. give me a break
. the movei hasn
' t got the wherewithal tothe even begin tothe exploit such idesa
; it
' s just trying tothe fidn convienient ways to stall us
. even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic
. git thsi
: remington
' s big plan isnt to build a large scaffold
- liek structure in tyhe middle ofthe the savannah
, sit onthe it
,
and wait for the lion tothe show up
. he doens this
,
and
then gets knocked off by a bird
. by the end of tje movei
, the blood vessels in my palm were all broken opn fomr me pounding my forhead with my h
and
. the acting isnt forgettable
. douglas does a good job ofthe portraying a relitively cracked fellow
,
but it
' s nothing he hasn
' t done befoer
. kilmer looks liuke he wishes he weere someone else
, somewhere else
, annd thge rest vanish into tghe cinematography
. tghe camera
, by thge way
, somtimes behaves so stupidly all by itself thgat most ofthe the lion attacks are incoherent
. what doed i expect ffrom this movie
? i dunno
. some rela excitement
, i supose
. a sense that ther weere formidable forces on both sides of htis equation
. noone such luck
. i dug outloud my tattered copy of hemingway
' s
" the short happy life ofthe francis macomber
"
and read that to get the taste of htis movie outloud of my mind
.
