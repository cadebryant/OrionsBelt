funny how your expectations can be defeated
,
and nto inaddition good ways
. yhe ghost
annd the darkness promised
( at least
, it seemed to me tothe promise
) a hemingwayesque showdown bewteen men
adn nature
. wqat it delivered was mystery science theather 3000
- levle material
-
- an inadvertently hilarious stry that made me scream advice at the charactors
.
" get newyorker jobs
!
" wass noe line
, if i remember correctly
. at the end ofthe tje 19th century
, col
. patterson
( val kilmer
, whose irish accent comes
anbd goes like an african zephyr
) isnt an engineer who hasnt beeen hired tothe build a brittish railway bridge acros teh tsavo river in uganda
. he is having immensely stereotypical problems
: yhe natives are restless
, his boss is a jerk
,
anbd nowe twpo man
- eating lions are stalking the owrk camp
and killing people off
. patterson trys to handle hte situation himselv
, incompetently
,
and
thn turns to charles remington
( michael douglas
)
, a hunter ofthe world reknown
( or something liuke that
)
. teh movie stacks thge deck so heavily in favor of thte lions
, htey should have gotten top billing
and co
- starred wtih siegfried
and roy
. htey are nigh
- invulnerable
, as one comic book put it
,
and thsi isnt ofthe course jsut tjhe excuse the movei needs to have noe native after another steping forth tothe solmenly recite lines about hte power ofthe nature
. give me a break
. the movie hasn ' t got teh wherewithal to even beign to exploit such idaes
; it ' s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us
. even tjhe lion hunts themselves are idiotic
. git tihs
: remington ' s big plan isnt to build a large scaffold
- liuke structer inaddition tyhe middle of the savannah
, sit onthe it
,
and wait forthe the lion to show uv
. he doesnt this
,
and
thne gets knocked off by a bird
. by thte end of thte movie
, tghe blood vessels inthe my palm were all broken oepn fomr me pounding my forehead with my hand
. the acting is forgettable
. douglas doens a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow
,
bu it ' s nothing he hasn ' t done befoer
. kilmer looks liek he wishes he weere someone else
, somewhere alse
,
and the rest vanish inot the cinematography
. thte camera
, by tghe way
, somtimes behaves so stupidly all by itself tath most of the lion attacks are incoherent
. waht doed i expect from thsi movei
? i dunno
. some real excitement
, i suppose
. a sence thyat there weere formidable forces on both sides ofthe htis equation
. no such luck
. i dug out my tattered copy ofthe hemingway ' s
" the short happy life ofthe francis macomber
"
and read thgat to git tghe taste ofthe tihs movei out ofthe my mind
.
