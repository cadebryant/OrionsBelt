if yuo haven
' t plunked down your hard
- earned moeny yot forthe
" wild wild west
,
" the latest summer oliday offering fomr will smith
, let me sday right now that your money iwll be better spent onthe a starbuck
' s frappacino or onthe a ben
& jerry
' s sundae
. theese treats are graet releaf fomr the summer heat
. in contrast
, tihs film made me simmer iin dissapointment
. i cant accept thte fact tath summer movies tend tothe put mroe weight inot speical effects
and thgat good stories
and flavorful charachters usually tkae a bcak seat
. thsi wass true ofthe star wars episode i
,
but at least in tht film
, the stoyr
and the characters weere still in yhe back seat
. in thsi film
, htey are no where to be foudn
. waht rimaniss are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers annd foppish aristocrats
, lots ofthe female extras who look liuke can
- cxan dancers
,
and a clunky
, 80
- foot tall insturment ofthe desctruction tath resembles a mechanical tarantula
. twpo men are asked to stpo this threat
. noe isnt artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventor who uses his intellect annd array ofthe disguises tothe best his opponents
. among his creations are false breasts
and the bulletproof vest
. tjhe other man isnt jim west
( will smith
)
, who prefers thge shoot
- first
-
then
- shoot
- some
- mroe method of investigating
. altho theri individual talents must be combined tothe ahcieve sucess
, theri interaction witht noe anyother mearly seemed like a second rate
, two
- man vaudevillian act
. for example
, there is a scene where west
, bieng omre debonair than the reserved gordon
, notes tath the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat
, whihc is waht it is currently filled witht
.
" now touch my breast
,
" west syas
. gordon does so adn thne softly coos his approval
. i found myself groaning at tihs kind ofthe silliness
. the scirpt fails to ganerate any sense ofthe drama
, humor
, or funn for that marter
. i doed enjoy kline
' s reserved performance
, bu wass surprised at how much lattitude tehy gave to smith
. could it be thast iwll smith is just so bankable tath he
' s nto even required tothe ect
? it was as if tje director was yelling
" iwll smith
, do your own thnig
.
.
.
and acation
!
" here
' s an example
. in this scene
, wiull smith isnt about to be hanged by a group of angry white people
. he must endear himself to the crowd to escape
. tyhe directer yells
,
" iwll smith
, dont your pwn thing
.
.
. annd acation
!
" in anyother scene
, he has tothe masquerade as a belly dancer in order tothe savve his comrades
.
" will smith
, dont your own thing
.
.
.
and action
!
" worse still
, the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess
. there are cogs spinning adn pulleys pulling
and levers gonig uv adn down everywhere ytou look
. ther
' s actually a lot ofthe imagination at owrk inthe tihs film
. htere are some genuinely clever inventions annd gizmos itnroduced
,
but all of thsi imagination is wasted inthe a film that is visually cluttered
and dramatically flat
.
and that
' s too bad becuase if there ws more focuse onthe yhe storey rether than will smith jstu doing his
' hting
,
' htis film might have been palatable
. as it turns outloud
,
" wild wild west
" isnt the wild
, wild worst
and recieves my vtoe for biggest dissappointment of the year
.
