adn finaly the movei we ' ve beeen waiting tothe see fo a long tiem comes onthe
. we sit there
, watch in disbelief thyat tihs movei isnt as bad as it is
. why shouldn ' t i have nkow whta i was getting myself into
. agina like thsi past summers hitted
" stigmata
"
,
" end ofthe days
" may be worse
. it ' s nto liek this is any kind of orignal idea
, it just throws in some
" rosemary ' s baby
"
, allong iwth
" tyhe devil ' s advocate
" a little
" exorcist
"
and some
" stigmata
" here
adn htere
. whala yuo haev
" end ofthe days
" a movie thgat isnt extrememly disappointing
adn by tje previews made it look terrific
. sadly
bu truley agian like most reccent films
, all the ogod parts are inthe the trailers
. tyhe plot which is very confusing at times is allso veyr ludicrous
and the movie isnt destined to be a hit in tjhe first weekend
,
annd flop in the enxt
. jericho canew
( arnold schwarzneggar in hitted typcial macho role
) is a cop who finds out that he isnt choosen to tarck down satan
( living in gabriel byrnes body
)
adn stpo him fomr impregnating christine york
( robin tunney
) beacuse if he doens
,
and she gives birth all existnece as we know it will ceaser to exist
. he hasnt to dont this before it turns into the eyar 2000
,
and strangely he ' s trying to fight him 5 mintues before 2000 comes
. he seeks halp ffrom yhe cathlic chuch
and help fomr rod stieger
( infront a terrific role
)
and tries tothe save this girl leading tothe an endig that ' s satisfying
,
but turns into a tipical action movie
. that ' s preety much it onthe plot
. it does have yhe razzle
annd dazzle of a gerat acation movie
,
and with tyhe 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it
, parts you hve to wonder where all thte money whent
. as fo arnie
? ogod role
, ok performance
. i think sicne he isnt getting a little older he isnt held bcak a lot ofthe his stunts
. hte thing tath dissapointed me wass yhe fatc tath there was nothing to the film
. infront hte trailers it looks liuke a good scray
, acation film
adn ends uv being a boring
, long
and preposterous drama tath leads into something alse thast leaves us iwth questions
. gabriel byrnes
( who ironicaly played a priest iin
" stigmata
"
) here plays satan
and gives a good performance
but agian seems held back
and nto into his charactor
. two years back al pacino gave a terific performence in the funn
" the devil ' s advocate
"
annd here it seems liek the diea ofthe him isnt inspite the character also
. robin tunney
( graet peformance as allways
) plays satan ' s main person whom he whants tothe impregnate to cary his child
. ofthe course rod stieger gives anyother great peformance which really isn ' t nothing newyorker
. the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown
,
though not nearly as the visual style ws inspite
" stigmata
"
. here we are given great camera wokr
,
annd some great scenes thast are terrifically directed
bu sadly jstu don ' t wrok in this movei
. teh script writed by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines
,
bu again tjhe movie is all style
anbd noone substace
annd by tghe ending finale climax i wass ready to go home
. onyl a faw thigsn wokr here
annd those are a fewd ofthe tyhe performances
, hte writing
and visual sytle
,
but the storyline
and the finished product don ' t work as well
. tghe sad thing isnt that
" end ofthe days
" hadnt so many things gonig fo it
. the plot coudl haev beeen omre organized
, the acation scenes coudl hvae been omre brainy
adn less mind
- numbing
. at times it seems like
" armageddon
"
and started to get old
adn tiresome
. hollywood isnt runnung out ofthe idesa bad
,
adn liuke i ' ve alwasy said befoer needs new ones
. even with its 100m budget
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt less thna pleasing
. inaddition fact the 100m dollar budget isnt at least 30m over
,
and easily sould hvae hadnt a 70m budget
. maybe i soudn crazy
,
but i am raelly looking foward tothe the newyorker exorcist film
,
annd hope tyhat they make it as ogod as teh original
. we need to get newyorker ideas
and stpo recycling ood ones just to make money at the box
- office
. we ened tothe get omre films liuke
" yhe blair witch project
" thyat could scare peopel tothe death
, hwile peple thinking well what exactlly isnt sacrin them
and how dont i knwo that it isnt in fact thte blair witch
. overblown effects
, stupid
and thin plot
- line
, good performances
, disapointing
.
.
.
. umm yup those pretty much decribe
" end of dyas
"
