, our hearts race
, we go through ten mintues ofthe preview anbd finally tjhe movei we
' ve been waiting tothe see for a long time comes onthe
. we sit htere
, watch iin disbelief tath this movie is as bad as it is
. why shouldn
' t i haev know waht i wass getting mysef into
. again liek tihs past summers hitted
" stigmata
"
,
" end of days
" may be worse
. it
' s nto like htis isnt any kind ofthe orginial idea
, it jstu throws inwhich some
" rosemary
' s baby
"
, allong whith
" the devil
' s advocate
" a little
" exorcist
"
and smoe
" stigmata
" here adn ther
. whala ytou have
" end of days
" a movie that isnt extremely disappointing anbd by thte previews made it look terific
. sadly bu truely again liuke most recent films
, all thge ogod parts are inthe the trailers
. the plot which isnt very confusing at times isnt also very ludicrous anbd teh movie is destiend tothe be a hit inthe thte first weekend
, anbd flop in the enxt
. jericho cane
( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role
) is a cop who finds outloud taht he is chosen tothe track down satan
( living in gabriel byrnes body
)
and stpo him from impregnating christine york
( robin tunney
) because if he doens
, annd she gives birth all existence as we knwo it will ceaser tothe exsist
. he has tothe dont this befoer it turns into thge yera 2000
, annd strangely he
' s trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes
. he seeks halp ffrom tyhe cathlic chuch
and halp fomr rod stieger
( in a terific role
)
and trys tothe savve this girl leading tothe an endig that
' s satisfying
,
but turns inot a typcial action movie
. that
' s preety much it on plot
. it does have the razzle
and dazzle of a grat action movie
,
and with the 100m doller budget parts seem tothe sohw it
, parts you have tothe wonder where all teh omney whent
. as for arnie
? good role
, ok performance
. i thiunk since he isnt getting a littel older he isnt held back a lot of his stunts
. the thing tyhat disappointed me was hte fact that there ws nothing tothe the film
. inaddition tje trailers it looks liuke a good scayr
, action film annd ends up being a boring
, long
and preposterous drama that leads into something else thyat leaves us with questions
. gabriel byrnes
( who ironically plyed a priest iin
" stigmata
"
) here plays satan
and gives a good performance bu agian seems held back
and not into his character
. two yeras back al pacino gavey a terrific performence inwhich the fun
" tje devil
' s advocate
"
and here it seems liuke thte idea ofthe him is inaddition tjhe charcter aslo
. robin tunney
( graet performance as always
) plays satan
' s main person whom he wnats to impregnate to cary his child
. ofthe course rod stieger gives another great performence which really isn
' t nothing newyorker
. the direction by peter hyams is at times a bited overblown
,
though nto nearly as the visual style ws infact
" stigmata
"
. here we are given great camera work
,
and some gerat scenes tath are terrifically directed bu sadly just don
' t owrk in this movei
. thte script written by
andrew marlowe hasnt a faw witty lines
,
but again tyhe movie is all style annd no substance annd by teh ending finale climax i ws ready to go home
. onyl a fewd things wokr here annd those are a few of yhe performances
, yhe writting anbd visual style
,
but the storyline adn teh finished product don
' t wokr as well
. the sad thing is that
" end ofthe dyas
" had so many thigsn gogin for it
. the plot coudl hvea beeen more organized
, thge action scenes could haev beeen moreso brainy
and less mind
- numbing
. at times it seems like
" armaegddon
"
and started to git old annd tiresome
. hollywood isnt runing outloud of ideas bad
, annd like i
' ve alwyas said befoer needs newyorker ones
. even with its 100m budget
" end ofthe dyas
" is less than pleasing
. in fatc the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over
, anbd easily could haev hadnt a 70m budget
. maybe i soudn crazy
,
but i am really looking foward to tyhe newyorker exorcist film
, anbd hope that tehy amking it as good as the orignal
. we ened to get new ideas adn stpo recycling ood ones just tothe mkae moeny at teh box
- office
. we need tothe get more films liuke
" tghe blair witch project
" that coudl scare peopel tothe death
, hwile peopel thikning well what exactly isnt sacrin them annd how do i know tath it isnt in fatc the blair witch
. overblown effects
, stupid adn thin plot
- line
, good performances
, disappointing
.
.
.
. umm yup thsoe pretty much describe
" end ofthe days
"
.
