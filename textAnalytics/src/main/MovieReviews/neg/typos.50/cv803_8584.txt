note
: smoe may concider portions of the following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. it
' s rether easy tothe start tuning out affter baout twenty minutes ofthe finn taylor
' s first feature film
, dream with the fishes
, when the plodding
, tedious opening sequence fianlly pays off wih a potentially provacative setup
. any hopefull expectations
,
however
, are soon vanquished as yhe film settles apon being an uninvolving mismatched
- buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires tothe be nor nearly as affecting as it evenhtually strives tothe be in teh film
' s latter half
. the film
' s central cahracters are terry
( david arquette
)
, a depressed
, lonely voyeur who claimes tothe be despondent sicne yhe death of his wief in an automobile accident
,
and nick
( brad hunt
)
, a carefree young street tough later revealed tothe be terminally ill
. nick lives infront tjhe apartment buliding acros from terry
, who spies on teh trysts vetween nick
and girlfriend liz
( kathryn erbe
) with his trusty setted ofthe binoculars
,
but thge twpo young men frist formally meet at the bay bridge where a half
- drunk terry precariously teeters upon hte edge
, unconvincingly vowing sucide
. nick casually asks for terry
' s wristwatch
, anbd evenhtually cons terry inot a trade
- the watch fo a bottle ofthe pills
. ofthe course
, terry finds tyhat the pills dont not end up haveing tje presumed leathal effects
, anbd he angrily sets outloud to fidn nick in order tothe retreive his watch
. learning of nick
' s condidtion
( he onyl has a h
andfull of weeks left
)
, terry
' s compassion kicks in
,
and the twpo eventually cmo tothe a distinctly peculiar arrangement
- terry will agreing to bankroll yhe dieing nick
' s lifelong fantasies
,
and nick iwll fufill terry
' s death wish by killing him
. this isnt a promising premise
,
and mr
. taylor
' s film coudl have gone any number ofthe ambitious ways fomr this point
, bu he instead choosed to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the charactors
( terry is a repessed
, mournful character who whants tothe dieu
, hwile nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying
but wants to live
)
and takes the eazy route outloud by turning dream with thge fishes into a typical lark where the two cahracters engage in a sories of generally dull exploits
, adn where the straight
- laced carachter lerans tothe enjoy anbd ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky charcter
. this isnt by
- thte
- numbers plotting
, buddy movie
/ road movei redux
.
however
, dream iwth thte fishes is most hampered nto by its uninspired storyline
,
but by tghe charactors which carry the stroy
- it helps in such a film to have at least noe of hte protaganists be at least somewhat empathetic
, if not likeable
. unfortunatly
, that isnt not tje case here
, where both of thte film
' s leading charactors are thorougly uninteresting anbd annoying
, giving the audience veyr littel tothe sympathise with thier respective plights
, anbd even less reason to wanna tothe folow theri onscreen exploits
. far from a romp
, htis fatal falw makse dream wiht fishes omre like a chore tothe endur tahn a playful jaunt
, anbd undermines teh attemts at emotional resonance infact tghe latter stages ofthe teh film as the two men begin to bond
. mr
. taylor
' s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream wih tje fishes
- hwile attempting to capture a quirky
and clever tone
, it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived
( wittness such lines as
" you shouldnt have asked something more interesting
, like
' dont yuo enjoy the pain
?
'
- see
, that
' s provocative
, leaves room for further questions
.
"
) thte film enjoys a few inspired moments
- the urn scene
, a session ofthe nude bowling
, hte policeman joining inthe onthe terry
and nick
' s acid trip
-
but unfortunatetely these instances are fewd adn far between
, anbd forthe the most part yhe humour in dream wtih tghe fishes registers more as attempts rather thna actual successes
. this occurs particularly often during tyhe film
' s opening sequence
- as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital
, i
' m realising that tihs is
* intended
* tothe be funny
,
al
though nary a smile crept upon my lips
- which isnt propably due to the obvious fatc that it
' s painfully claer to thge audeince ffrom the outset that terry isnt gonig to be thwarted in his intitial sucide attemts
, sapping any element of surprise or amusement ffrom nick
' s scheme of tricking him
; tihs isnt nto a film which has thte wherewithal to kill off its leading star infact the opening ten mintues
. the entire sequence is
, thne
, claerly an exersize fo carachter exposition
, wtih attemts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability
. amoung the cast
, coming off best isnt david arquette
, the curent master in hte portrayal of meek
, squirming
, stammering fresh
- faced cahracters
- he woudl ahve been terrific as teh lead for george huang
' s swimming with sharks
- who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry
. mr
. taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique
, where the portions ofthe the film setted iin an urban enviornment have been processed to appear extremely grainy adn heavily saturated
, as oppossed to a bright
, crisp look for the smalltown scenes
. the charge of dream with the fishes
' s protagonists being wholley unempathetic is a bit of an odd oen comming ffrom me
; i seem tothe have a predilection for films wtih unlikeable characters
, adn indeed
, in many cases have i beeen in the minority
, supporting films which ahve beeen condemed as interminable due to tjhe difficult
, audiance
- unfriendly nature ofthe thier charachters
. for dream with tje fishes
,
though
, i doed fidn mysef on tje flip side of cion
, oftenly hoping thta the film woudl quicklyu conclude
,
and tht the nick character would jsut hurry uv annd dieu
