i cried during
_ babe
_
. i admit it
. the special effects
, yhe stroy
, hte great dialogue were woven together so delicately
and successfully taht my mind lost trackr thyat htis wass a
" children
' s film
"
-
- so much so that
, yes
, i got a little overly sentimental
. such
, my friend
, is tghe pwoer ofthe cinema
. whn word came out thyat htey were using this newly developed f
/ x for a doctor dolittle update
, inaddition which eddie murphy plays tghe title carachter
, anbd many graet comic actors supply the voices
, my anticipation rose tothe great expectations
. htey cxan
' t possibly drop the ball onthe htis one
. cin
' t miss
. cant
' t possibly miss
. tehy missed
. waht went wrong
? affter much
thought
, i supply threee general rules
.
( 1
) don
' t let a televsion actress
- turned
- comedy movei director near an urbanite script
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall
' s dreadful
" preacher
' s wief
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders with
" the brady bunch movei
"
,
but the same sitcom
- airiness doesn
' t quite work here
. it
' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom
,
and iced it with light doses of modern r
& b
. tkae away the black casted
, tkae away the atrocious sountrack
, anbd you have the residue of some mid
- 80
' s kirk cameron sohw
.
( 2
) hte greater teh cast
, hte less hte individual casted
- member hasnt tothe dont
( i
. e
.
,
" con air
"
)
. it isnt gerat tothe have thge comic voices of jenna elfman
, garry sch
andling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
,
and gilbert godfried inwhich your lineup
,
but they have nothing tothe dont
but improvise their underdeveloped
, stereotyped charactors
, oney
- line
- at
- a
- tiem
. it
' s even worse
, becasue sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that ytou don
' t get the satisfaction of linking the voice tothe teh comedian until thge credits
. now ther are threee character actors who do get special treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity to nearly eveyr project he
' s in
,
and hte scenes as a depressed tiger dont resonate a certain poignancy
. norm mcdonald farse nearly as well
, as a stray dog who lerans to bond wiht dolittle
.
but htere
' s little humer here
. tyhat rests onthe the shoulders of chris rock
, sorely miscast
and unfunny as the voice ofthe their wise
- ass guinea pig
. even thte mouth is ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don
' t let the speical effects technicians walk awya iwth hte scirpt
. there
' s a certian timing thast
' s m
andatory in comedy
. to ahve thsi timing usurped by teh brilliancy of cmoputer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson
' s creature shop
, isnt a travesty
. this is nto tothe sday thgat speical effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren
' t well
- timed laughfests
; with the right directer
, tehy cin be anbd have
. here
, betty thomas is clearly over her head
. i wish i coudl commend the special effects
,
but tehy
' re merely averege
. count hte number of times where the animal
' s mouth is turned awya from tjhe camera
, or too far tothe notice
, or ill
- synched
. thsi isnt less a
" babe
"
and more of a
" look who
' s barking
" clone
. you may be wondering
,
' how doens eddie murphy fare
?
' well
, he cameback back with the exeptional
" nutty professer
"
, annd i don
' t doubt he can cmo bcak agina
. here
, he
' s tied into a straight man
and given littel to do
. the exceptions are whn he fears he
' s going crazy
: a far cry ffrom his smarter
- than
- you
' d expect routine that he
' s more adept at
. it
' s unfortunate that he isnt where richard pryor ws ten yeras ago
, making lame comedies wihtout thge same bite he had given in his early years
. after all this
, what
' s left
?
butt jokes
. a
_ lot
_ of
butt jokes
. i guess for kids thyat may be funny
, bu i ws stone
- faced
. if there
' s a lesson tghe film may be telling us
, isnt thgat animals ahve feelings too
, adn they care way too much for your
butt
.
