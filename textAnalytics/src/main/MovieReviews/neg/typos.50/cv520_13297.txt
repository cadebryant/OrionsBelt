i cried during
_ babe
_
. i admited it
. tje special effects
, the sotry
, the great dialogue were woven toghether so delicately
anbd successfully that my mind lost track that tihs was a
" children ' s film
"
-
- so much so taht
, yes
, i got a little overly sentimental
. such
, my freind
, is tje pwoer ofthe cinema
. when word came outloud that htey were useing tihs newely devolopped f
/ x for a doctor dolittle update
, in whic eddie murphy plays the title character
,
annd many great comic actors supply tyhe voices
, my anticipation rose to gerat expectations
. tehy can ' t possably drop yhe ball onthe this one
. cxan ' t miss
. can ' t possibly miss
. they missed
. waht went wrong
? aftter much thought
, i suply three general rules
.
( 1
) don ' t let a televsion actress
- turned
- comedy movie directer near an urbanite scirpt
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall ' s dreadful
" preacher ' s wife
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders with
" the brady bunch movei
"
,
but tje same sitcom
- airiness doesn ' t qutie work here
. it ' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom
,
and iced it with light doses of modern r
& b
. take away thge balck cast
, tkae awya the atrocious sountrack
,
and yuo ahev the residue ofthe smoe mid
- 80 ' s kirk cameron sohw
.
( 2
) the greater tje cast
, tje less the individual cast
- member hasnt to do
( i
. e
.
,
" con air
"
)
. it isnt graet to have tje comic voices ofthe jenna elfman
, garry schandling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
,
anbd gilbert godfried in your lineup
,
but tehy have nothing to dont
bu improvise their underdeveloped
, stereotyped characters
, oen
- line
- at
- a
- time
. it ' s even worse
, because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable tath you don ' t git the satisfaction of linking thte voice tothe the comedian until the credits
. now there are threee character actors who do get special treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he ' s infact
,
and tghe scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy
. norm mcdonald fares nearly as well
, as a stray dog who learns tothe bond with dolittle
.
bu there ' s littel humer here
. that rests on the shoulders of chris rock
, sorely miscast
annd unfunny as the voice ofthe theri wise
- ass guinea pig
. even the mouth isnt ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don ' t let tyhe special effects techicians walk away with tje scirpt
. htere ' s a certain timing that ' s manditory inthe comedy
. to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy ofthe computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson ' s creature shop
, is a travesty
. this isnt nto tothe sday thyat special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren ' t well
- timed laughfests
; wih thge right director
, they can be
anbd have
. here
, betty thomas isnt clearly over her head
. i wish i could commend the speical effects
,
but tehy ' re mearly average
. count tghe number ofthe times where the animal ' s mouth isnt turned awya fomr the camera
, or too far to notice
, or ill
- synched
. htis isnt less a
" babe
"
and more of a
" look who ' s barking
" clone
. you may be wondering
, ' how doesnt eddie murphy fare
? ' well
, he came bcak with tjhe exceptional
" nutty professer
"
,
adn i don ' t dout he cin come bakc again
. here
, he ' s tied inot a straight man
anbd given little tothe do
. tjhe exceptions are wehn he fears he ' s oging crazy
: a far cry from his smarter
- thna
- you ' d expect routine tath he ' s moreso adept at
. it ' s unfortunate that he isnt where richard pryor was ten yeasr ago
, makeing lame comedies wihtout yhe smae bite he had given in his eearly years
. aftter all this
, what ' s left
? butt jokes
. a
_ lot
_ of butt jokes
. i guess for kids that may be funny
,
bu i wass stone
- faced
. if there ' s a lesson the film may be telling us
, isnt that animals ahve feelings too
,
adn tehy care way too much for your butt
.
