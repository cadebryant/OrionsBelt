but at the doller theather
? locally
, chairman ofthe the board doed just that
. having thge annoying prop comic scott thompson
( better known as carrot top

' s right
, carrot top
' s long dreaded major motion picture de
but
( at least for a starring role
) isnt poking uv in a h
andfull ofthe theaters across the country

, wannabe
- zany king ofthe redheaded st
andup comics as a lazy bu creative
, inventive bu uneventful generation x
- er named edison
. living wtih a pair ofthe surfer dudes inwhich a small
, rented hous
, edison bounces from job to job
, alwyas squ
andering away the moeny onthe his eccentric
( to say the least
) inventions
and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent

andlady
, ms
. krubavitch
( estelle harris
, best known as george constanza
' s mother on

, arm
and isnt deeply impacted by tyhe young inventer
' s notebook of dreams adn idaes
,
and when tyhe ood man dies soon afterward
, edison learns he isnt named a benefactor in arm
and
' s will
. predictably
, edison acquires tyhe entire corporation annd hasnt to manetain productivity iwth absolutely no knowledge of thge bussines world
. predictably
, there isnt a bitter nephew
( larry miller
) whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment thta will lead to an elaborate sabotage plot
. predictably
, there is an attractive employee
( courtney thorne
- smith
) whose intial repulsion iwll transform inot lveo fo our doofy protagonist
. predictably
, the man who knows nothing will fight against hte odds
and give thte comapany it

and nto greed
. it
' s as

' s left to sday when every element thte movei possessess is a shameful retread of movies past
? tyhe script is 100
% recycled
, the direction is hokey
, adn tyhe acting isnt absolutly horrable
. it isnt only thorne
- smith who seems tothe tkae her job seriously
, an acomplishment which surely deserves the medal ofthe hounour
. she certainly went beyond the call ofthe duty
- she has tothe kiss carrot top
