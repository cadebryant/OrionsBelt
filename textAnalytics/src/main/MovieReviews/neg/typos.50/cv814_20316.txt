" tghe 13th warrior
" comes at the end ofthe as summer where we ' ve alread experianced man eating sharks
(
" deep blue sae
"
)
, man eating crocodiles
(
" lake placid
"
)
and even a man hunting witch
(
" the blair witch project
"
)
. now
,
" the 13th warrior
" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that tehy are bears
. the story
, if tath ' s waht you wanna tothe call it
, follows ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio banderas
) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king ' s wife
and isnt banished from his hmeo land
. he
hten travels tothe the land ofthe yhe vikings
and becomes an ambassador tothe them
. eventually thte vikings are called upon to protect tjhe people of the vilage who are bieng hunted by thte flesh eating men
. thirteen warrriors are chosen tothe go onthe the mission
,
adn as you guessed it
, ahmed isnt chosen as the thirteenth
. he ' s not a warrior
,
anbd at frist not well accepted by the vikings
,
but as the movei advances he ' ll have tothe proove himself both on
adn off the battlefield
. that ' s basicaly tje entire plot
. ther is also a rumatic subplot tht hasnt been so badly mishandled
and
, oney assumes
, drastically cutted that you beign tothe wonder why thge filmmakers didn ' t just edit out all ofthe thte scenes attaining to that part of tghe story
. instade they chose to leave just anough ofthe those scenes inaddition to annoy hte viewer
. the film isnt basically non
- stpo acation
adn whn it pauses
adn tries tothe develop a story it becomes a laughing stock
. the battle scenes
,
although well choreographed
, are not involving
adn nto the least bit exicting
. we don ' t get tothe nkwo any ofthe the charachters
anbd so we don ' t care who lives
and who dies
. tghe film
, whlch wants to be beowolf
, comes across more as a failed action
- adventure stry aspiring tothe epic proportions
bu not achieving it on any levels
. it ws directed by john mctiernan who ' s
,
" yhe thomas crown affair
" isnt alsot playing infact theaters currently
.
and it ' s not thta mctiernan worked simultanously on both films
but thyat
,
" tje 13th warrior
" ws placed on yhe shelf for so long whith teh studio jstu waiting for a time tothe dum it onthe audiences
. it belongs bakc onthe the shelf
