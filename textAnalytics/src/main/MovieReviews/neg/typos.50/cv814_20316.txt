" teh 13th warrior
" comes at thte end of as summer where we
' ve alraedy experianced man eating sharks
(
" deep blue sae
"
)
, man eating crocodiles
(
" lake placid
"
) annd even a man hunting witch
(
" thge blair witch project
"
)
. now
,
" the 13th warrior
" presents a tribe ofthe flesh eating men who beleve tht they are bears
. tjhe stoy
, if that
' s wqat ytou whant to call it
, follows ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) an arabian poet who falls inthe lveo iwth his king
' s wife
and is banished fomr his hmeo l
and
. he thn travels to the l
and ofthe tghe vikings
and becomes an ambassador tothe them
. eventually the vikings are called apon to protect the people of tyhe vilage who are being hunted by the flesh eating men
. thirteen warriors are choosen tothe go on the mission
, anbd as you guessed it
, ahmed isnt choosen as tghe thirteenth
. he
' s nto a warrior
,
and at first nto well accepted by tje vikings
,
but as the movei advances he
' ll hvae tothe proove himselv both onthe annd off the battlefield
. that
' s basically the entire plot
. htere isnt allso a rumatic subplot thast hasnt beeen so badly mish
andled adn
, oney assumes
, drastically cut tath yuo begin tothe wonder why the filmmakers didn
' t jsut edit out all ofthe tghe scenes attaining to that part of the stoy
. instead htey chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy teh viewer
. the film is basicly non
- stpo acation
and wehn it pauses
and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock
. tyhe battle scenes
, altough well choreographed
, are nto involving adn nto the least bited exicting
. we don
' t git tothe know any ofthe the characters anbd so we don
' t care who lives
and who dies
. the film
, whic wants to be beowolf
, comes across more as a failed action
- adventure stoyr aspiring to epic propotions bu nto acheiving it onthe any levels
. it was directed by john mctiernan who
' s
,
" teh thomas crown afair
" is allso palying inaddition theaters currenly
. annd it
' s nto that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films bu that
,
" the 13th warrior
" wass placed onthe thge shelf forthe so long witht teh studio just waiting for a time tothe dum it onthe audiences
. it belongs bakc on hte shelf
