how do films like mouse hunt get inot theatres
? isn
' t there a law or something
? this diablical load ofthe claptrap from steven speilberg
' s dreamworks studio is hollywood familiy fare at its deadly worst
. mouse hunt takes the bare threads ofthe a plot annd trys tothe prop it up wtih overacting adn flat
- out stupid slapstick that makes comedies liuke jingle all yhe way look decent by comparison
. writter adam rifkin adn director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible fo thsi swill
. hte plot
, fo waht its worth
, concerns two brothers
( nathan lane adn an appalling lee evens
) who inherit a poorly run string factory anbd a seemingly worthless hous fomr their eccentric father
. deciding tothe check out the long
- abnadoned house
, they soon learn tath it
' s worth a fortune
and setted about selling it inthe auction tothe the higest bidder
. bu battling them at eveyr turn isnt a very smart mouse
, hapyp witht his run
- down little abode adn wanting it to stay tht way
. yhe story alternates vetween unfunny scenes ofthe thge brothers bickering over whta to dont with their inheritence anbd endless action sequences as tjhe twpo take onthe their increasingly determined furry foe
. whatever promise tyhe film starts with soon deteriorates inot boring dialogue
, terrible overacting
, adn increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all soudn annd fury
, signifying nothing
. hte scirpt becomes so unspeakably bad taht teh best line poore lee evens cant utter after anyother run inspite withthe the rodent is
:
" i hite that mouse
"
. oh cringe
! this is home alone all over agian
,
and ten times worse
. oen touching scene early onthe isnt worth mentioning
. we follow thte mouse thru a maze of walls anbd pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere infact a wall
. he jumps into a tiny bed
, puls uv a makeshift sheet
and snuggles up to sleep
, seemingly hapyp adn just wanting tothe be left alone
. it
' s a magical littel moment inaddition an otherwise soulless film
. a message tothe speilberg
: if ytou want dreamworks tothe be associated with some kind ofthe artistic credibility
,
then either give all conserned inwhich mouse hunt a swift kick uv tyhe arse or hire yourself some decent writers
and directors
. htis kind of rubbish will jstu not dont at all
