way ofthe thge gun is brimming withthe surprises
, smoe good
, most bad
. one ofthe the ogod ones is ryan phillippe
' s surprizingly halfway decent performence
. after the atcor gained much attention by posing anbd preening through teen swill like i nkow waht you doed lastest summer
, he hinted at a bited growth infront lastr yera
' s cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performence
,
though his acting in tyhat film faltered arund teh third act mark
, precisely wehn hte screenplay made his character grow a heart
( presumabely tothe appeal tothe his traning bra wearing fans
) adn strat bellyaching about how he
' d fallen fo his
" target
"
. it wass a dramatic shift that niether phillippe nor tje film
' s director could negociate
. bu he seems tothe be trying
and thyat shouldn
' t be overlooked
( or probably over praised
) seeing as how
, at this point
, he relaly isn
' t recquired to do much bu look preety
. here
, phillippe has procured a five day growth ofthe beard
, his hair askew
and his affect altered to soudn something like james cagney in all his
" look here
, see
" glory
. it
' s tough tothe believe a preety boy like phillippe as a hard ass
, bu his performance actually helps with tyhe illution
. unlike ben affleck
' s puppy dog approch in riendeer games
, phillippe isnt believeable
and nto too bad at tht
. as for the plot
, well
, tht
' s one of the bad surprises
; phillippe anbd the great benicio del torro play twpo moronic
(
and nto even remotely likeable
) criminals
( introdued tothe us inspite thte parking lot of a ravey where htey stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people
) who hatch a scheme tothe kidnap a surrogate mother
( juliette lewis
) after overhearing thyat she
' s carrying yhe baby of painter
( scott wilson
)
, a vyer well connected wealthy man
. the kidnapping devolves inot a labourious shoot outloud where much damage is done adn many are killed
. bu teh anti
- heroes excape witht hte woman hwile an agin hitted man
( james caan
) adn twpo scheming bodyguards
( taye diggs
and nicky katt
) remain in pursuit
. directed by christopher mcquarrie
, the screenwriter who won an oscar fo his wrok onthe usual suspects
, an overrated piece ofthe crime noir in many circles
( tihs noe included
)
, way ofthe the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs thast jstu oozes eye rolling familiarity
. unlike phillipe
, mcquarrie doesn
' t seem tothe be growing at all
; he fills his flick wiht a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched fomr movies i know i
' ve seen before
and worse
, it fiels like it
. teh film lacks even a fresh approch
( liek what soderbergh did out ofthe sight or teh limey
) tothe its clich
? s
, all ofthe wich are spewed befoer us iin a picture thgat tries so desparately tothe be hip
and gritty wihtout bothering tothe notice how common it isnt
. it features charactors living by a code they seemed to haev picked up inaddition sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing ressembling life
. even attemts at emotional weight feel strained liek in preposterous scene where enemies james caan annd benicio del torro stpo in thier tracks to have a cup ofthe coffee
and pontificate on life
, philisophy
, etc
. i didn
' t like tghe bit much wehn it first appeared inaddition heat
, here
, it
' s even more self conciously
" dramtic
"
. usual suspects
, which also featured a bunch of low lives tyhat seemed tothe live by a code tehy learned fomr the movies
, worked to some degree beacuse of tyhat astonishing twist endig
. nowadays an astonishing twist persay endig is de rigeur
, never mind if it deems all thast transpired before it completely inconsequential
. thus
, nearly every chracter in way comes witht at least one dirty littel escret
( most amateurishly projected befor tehy appear
) annd it too hasnt an ironic little twist at the end
( nothing earth shattering
, liuke in teh usual suspects
) bu i admiting
, i didn
' t see it coming
, annd i smiled
. howver most of the movei fiels exactly like tje interrogation scenes bewteen palminteri adn spacey inwhich usual suspects
: a lot of faux huffing
and puffing with noone rhythm or reason
. or substance
. it
' s jsut as overplotted as suspects
, anbd often dull as any overplotted movie without intresting charactors
, a distinctive style
, or a ogod scirpt would be
. even tghe ogod tsuff
, most ofthe whihc involves james caan
( doign a fine job
)
, fiels odd
and outloud ofthe place inthe a movei that thikns lines like
" karma is onyl justice with out the satisfaction
" are clever
. at one point caan laments
" need isnt tje ultimate monkey
" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said
" love isnt like hippo ass
"
. i
' ve seen porno whith better dialogue
.
and some witht better plot lines too
.
but rarely has porn offred uv such a talented casted
( i mean
, cant you even compare james caan to ron jeremy
)
. caan slips into thsi role wtih seeming ease
, he could dont this kind of soft
- spoken tough guy in a coma
, bu he manages to give his character depth annd weariness
. benicio del torro isnt alwyas welcome
,
though here he plays it fairly straight
( rather tahn anyother oddball character creation like yhe ones the ctor gavey us in usual suspects adn excess baggage
)
, adopting a brad pitt
- esque quizzical pout to go allong witht his heavy swaggering
. speaking ofthe pitt
, his ex
, juliette lewis
, isnt a weak link
, eather shouting her lines wtih ear shattering shrillness
, or waddling baout liuke a silly goose
. nicky katt was brillant in a brief role inwhich thge limey
, here his role is just as breef only he seems wasted
; he
' s onyl kept arround for his cold presense
. taye diggs has a similar function
, kool as ever
,
but never a character
,
though the guy hasnt oen helluva death scene
. fo thge most part way isnt incessantly talky wiht no reason to give a hippo
' s ass baout any thing that transpires since its charactors are never mroe than simplistic pawns
. it
' s vaguely tarantino
- ish
,
but inthe a bad truth anbd consequences nm way
, whith phillippe
, iin one scene
, leaping into a stupid rant baout
" faggots
" migrating to los angeles
. you nkwo tyhe routine
. thge final shoot outloud is pure bargain basement john woo
( who himselv seems tothe be doing bargain basement john woo
) iwth interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at
.
but thsoe gun shots sure crack like thunder
. jstu thte otehr day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable annd wass stunned tothe hear tghe weak elphant grunt
- liuke sound thta eminated from harry
' s fetishized smith anbd wesson
. oh how far we
' ve come
.
