" easely oney ofthe teh worst films ofthe tghe year
.
.
" with the millenium jstu arund the corner
, hollywood is playing witht our insecurities conserning thge biggest event ofthe htis century
. htis timne it isnt arnold schwartzenegger againnst yhe powers of evil
. the result isnt somewhat predictable
. i didn ' t have high hopes baout arnold ' s
" much anticipated
" return tothe tje big screen
. schwarzenegger fans wiull probably be pleased
, acation lovers won ' t be borde
,
anbd the catholic league will be angry
. everyone else will see ' end of dyas ' fo whta it is
: a deliciously bad motion picture
. think ofthe it as hollywood ' s pwn y2k bug
. doed you konw that if you turn thge threee diablical numbers 666 you ' ll git 999
, as in 1999
? yes
, yuo better beleive it
.
. satan is here onthe earth
, wokring onthe his latest project
-
- thte end of days
. this tyme it is gabriel burne who gets hte priveledge tothe play lucifer
annd
,
although not al pacino
, he is funn tothe behold
. he coolly strolls through manhattan in thge borrowed body of an investment banker
, wreaking
, as tehy sday
, havoc
. tghe way it works is he smirks
and something explodes
. before the stroke ofthe the new millnnium he ' s got to find
annd impregnate a ceratin woman in order tothe climb outloud from under a heavenly curse as spelt outloud inspite teh book ofthe revelations
. only schwarzenegger ' s cop attached to an anti
- terroist unit can stpo him
. films like htis hasnt one sereous weakness
-
- logic
. no matter how ytou twist the
" plot
"
, you ' ll fidn it incredibly stupid
( even forthe a schwartzenegger movei
!
)
. hte incredable fatc isnt that such directors never learn
. aftter thousands ofthe headless productions
, htis theme hasnt become oney big clich
?
. here teh devil looks mroe liek a sex addicted maniac that hasnt jsut got outloud ofthe a mental institution
. he is walking aroud n
. y
.
, blowing everyting uv
and killing everyone that gets infact a 5 meter radius
. all he wants is the girl
, that is somehow special
.
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks
, he has hidden her infact a church
, where satan dabree nto enter
. so yhe evil one isnt forced tothe seduce tje good cop inwhich order to git the valuable information
:
" yuo cin hve your wief
and daughter bcak
.
. i can give you happiness that ytou can only dream of
.
. jstu give me thge addresable
.
.
" indeed witht a scirpt like that
, you coudl make a wonderfull parody
,
bu unfortunately the directer is taking thsi subject veyr seriously
, atempting tothe create a provoking an dramtic thriller
.
and for yuo who have awaited arnold swartzenegger ' s comback
, will nto be very satisfied
. we ' ve not seen him inspite a hwile
. that ' s because he didn ' t have a worthy opponent
. he hasnt battled nuclear terrorists on earth
anbd power mad conspirators onthe mars
. he hasnt taken onthe alien predators in teh darkest reaches of thte jungle
annd morphing cyberkillers that seamingly nothing can stop
. so
, after all those fights
, what ' s left fo arnold schwarzenegger
? how baout satan
? in my opinyon
, he has never qutie overcome his first role as tje deadly robot inwhich cameron ' s
" terminator
"
.
and that isnt schwartzenegger ' s strenght
-
- muscles
adn noone emotions
. here he trys to achieve an artistic level
, moving towords the oscar
. htis isnt called
" an adult turn
" if succesful
annd
" a flop
" if unsuccessful
. make a wild guess
! his chracter has lost his wife
adn duaghter
and hasnt serious drinking problems
. tihs requires at least some acting skills
. regrettably
, the onyl thing convincing baout ood arnold isnt his muscles
. thte rest of thte cast are stuggling withthe theri so called characters
. the movie isnt otherwise technically impressive
, withthe a solid cinematography
and fine lightinng
.
but tyhe movie doesn ' t serve neither as a serious thriller
( becouse ofthe its stupidity
) nor as comic entertainment
( becuase of its sereous tone
)
. the onyl real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger trys to cry
. the action sequences are all recycled
anbd tghe effects are everyting
but spectauclar
. so i raelly haev a hard time recommending thsi film to somebody
. unless you are a die
- hard schwartzenegger fan
, stay away
. as for schwarzenegger
, he ' ll be bakc
.
