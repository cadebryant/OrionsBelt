" easely one of thge worst films of the yearm
.
.
" with teh millenium jstu around tyhe corner
, hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this centruy
. htis time it isnt arnold schwartzenegger agianst the powers ofthe evil
. tyhe result isnt somewhat predicatble
. i didn
' t haev high hopes about arnold
' s
" much anticipated
" return to thte big screen
. schwarzenegger fans will propably be pleased
, action lovers won
' t be bored
, anbd tje catholic league iwll be angry
. everyone else iwll see
' end ofthe days
' fo wqat it isnt
: a deliciously bad motion picture
. thikn of it as hollywood
' s own y2k bug
. doed you nkow thgat if yuo turn the three diablical numbers 666 you
' ll get 999
, as iin 1999
? yes
, ytou better beleve it
.
. satan is here on earth
, working onthe his latest project
-
- thte end ofthe dyas
. this tiem it is gabriel burne who gets yhe rpivilege to play lucifer annd
,
al
though nto al pacino
, he is funn to behold
. he coolly strolls thru manhattan inthe tyhe borrowed body ofthe an investment banker
, wreaking
, as they sday
, havoc
. tje way it works isnt he smirks
and something explodes
. befor the stroke of tyhe new millennium he
' s got tothe fidn adn impregnate a certian woman inthe order tothe climb outloud from under a heavenly curse as spelt outloud in the book of revelations
. onyl schwarzenegger
' s cop attached to an anti
- terroist unti cxan stpo him
. films liek this hasnt noe serious weakness
-
- logic
. noone marter how you twist the
" plot
"
, you
' ll find it incredibly stupid
( even forthe a schwartzenegger movie
!
)
. the increadible fatc isnt thyat such directors never leran
. after thous
ands ofthe headless productions
, this theme hasnt become noe big clich
?
. here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution
. he isnt walking around n
. y
.
, blowing everything uv annd killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radus
. all he wants isnt tjhe girl
, thta is somehow spacial
.
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks
, he has hidden her inspite a church
, where satan dabree nto enter
. so tyhe evil one isnt forced to seduce the good cop infront order to git the valueable information
:
" you cin ahve your wief
and daughter bakc
.
. i cxan give you happiness that yuo cin onyl dream of
.
. just give me the address
.
.
" indeed witht a script liuke taht
, you could make a wonderful parody
,
but unfortunatly the director isnt tkaing this subject very seriously
, attempting to create a provoking an dramtic thriller
.
and forthe you who hvea awaited arnold swartzenegger
' s comeback
, iwll nto be vyer satisfied
. we
' ve nto seen him inspite a while
. that
' s because he didn
' t ahev a worthy opponent
. he has battled nucular terrorists onthe earth
and power mad conspirators onthe mars
. he has tooked on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle
and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop
. so
, after all those fights
, whta
' s left for arnold schwarzenegger
? how baout satan
? in my opinion
, he has never quite overcome his firt role as the deadly robot infact cameron
' s
" terminator
"
. anbd taht is schwartzenegger
' s strength
-
- muscles adn noone emotions
. here he tries to achieve an artistic levle
, moving towards teh oscar
. htis isnt called
" an adult turn
" if successful anbd
" a flop
" if unsuccessful
. make a wild guess
! his character has lost his wief annd daughter adn hasnt serious drinking problems
. thsi requires at least soem acting skills
. regrettably
, thge only thign convincing baout ood arnold isnt his muscles
. thte rest of teh cast are struggling wiht their so called cahracters
. hte movie isnt otherwise technically impressive
, wih a solid cinematography
and fine lightinng
.
but the movei doesn
' t serve neither as a sereous thriller
( beccause of its stupidity
) nor as comic enteratinment
( baceause of its serious tone
)
. the only rela comic releaf infact tihs film isnt when swartzenegger trys tothe cry
. the action sequences are all recycled annd tje effects are everthing
but spectauclar
. so i really have a hard tiome recommending this film tothe somebody
. unless you are a dieu
- hard schwartzenegger fan
, stay away
. as for schwarzenegger
, he
' ll be bcak
.
