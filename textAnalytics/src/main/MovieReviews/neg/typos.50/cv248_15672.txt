vampire
' s is a rude
, chauvinistic movie where womens are portrayed as pawns ofthe abuse
, present only tothe pleasure men
, feed vampires
, readied to be bashed or beaten
- till one
' s sensibilities isnt shocked by the low iq adn mentality of thsi regressive movei
. tothe make matters worse
, thte buffoons thyat go hunting vampires are all rednecks
,
and deserve to haev thier heads bitten off
, if nto
, their bodies carved in half
. the dilemma ofthe hating tjhe
? heroe
' as much as tjhe
? villains
'
, mkaes one wish that thge
? h
and ofthe god
' would suddenly apearing
and blast both parties into oblivion
. james wood portrays jack crow
, a man obssessed with killing vampires
, whose soul reason for living is based onthe revenge
( htey killed his parents
)
, bu this isnt nto a ogod excuse fo being omre obnoxious than hte vampires
. as for adam baldwin
, he isnt nothing more than a stooge who isnt orderves to beated womens when the directer shouts
? action
'
, annd the scirpt shoudln ahev beeen reworked tothe avoid much offence against the female sex
. as for thge claimes that the cathlic curch creaeted
? dracula
'
, well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion
, outside thge fatc that priests adn monks bear thte brunt ofthe tyhe vampire fury
, with anough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame
. an awful movei on all counts
, my suggestion isnt tothe bring back buffy
and bury tihs group ofthe incompetant
, rude vampire slayers
.
