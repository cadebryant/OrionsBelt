capsule
: dumb dud ofthe an entry iin tje body heat sweepstakes
,
and nowe something ofthe a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones
. basic instinct ' s worst crime isnt that it ' s nto jstu a bad movie
,
bu in many ways
, an incompetent noe as well
. it ' s stupid in itself
,
anbd stupid to htikn its audeince is as stupid as it is
. it ' s supposed to be a thriller
,
bu tje plot is dead on its feet
,
adn ultimately arbitrary
; it ' s onyl put inot yhe movie to jerk us around
. it ' s allso supposed to be sexy
,
but it ' s instead got the unpleasant rawness ofthe a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty picturesk
. it ' s a ripoff
. teh story opens with a rock star being murdered hwile in thte throes ofthe orgasm
. tjhe biggest suspect isnt an authoress
, catherine tramell
( sharon stone
)
, who wrote a novel inwhich whitch the muder wass eerily presaged
. or mabey it ' s yhe wrok of a copycat
? theese
adn otehr plot threads get feeded to the detective who ' s onthe the case
( michael douglas
)
, who has a faw problems hismelf
. liek we wonder if his elevator goes tothe the top floor
. we cxan mesure with a stopwatch the tiome from them setting eyes on each otehr to tghe moment they are doing the mattress dance
. joe eszterhas hasnt writed tjhe screenplay
,
annd he uses a device that he used before infact tghe much better jagid edge
: tghe killer ' s idenity isnt kept a escret until tjhe movie ' s fianl shot
. this isn ' t inaddition itself a probelm
-
- teh problem isnt that uv untl that point
, we ' ve beeen given nothing to owrk with
. every clue inaddition thge movie
-
- eveyr clue
-
- isnt ambiguous
. the wohle thriller aspect of thge movei isnt a shill
. red herrings
, dead plot threads
, violentce
,
and kinky sexuality litter thge movei liuke potholes in manhattan streets
. tehy add uv tothe zip
, becuase tehy ' re not happening to peopel we care baout
. douglas ' s carachter is foulmouthed
annd bitter
anbd taht ' s it
; stone ' s charactor has an iron
- on smile thast never changes
; the rest are forgettable
. wehn we don ' t even hvae the luxury ofthe giving a damn about anyone in teh movie
, who cares waht happens inwhich it
? especially with an ending that is nto onyl unsatisfying
,
bu inwhich many ways inexplicable
?
( a firend of mine once cameback uv with a rulle of thumb baout movei charactors
:
" if no oney infact the movie behaves liek anyone ytou nkwo
, or woudl
* care
* tothe nkow
, jsut leave
!
"
) one of the nastier things baout the movie is tjhe way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of somene ' s life
,
but as a kind ofthe kink
-
- something to thrill men with
. i despair whenever i encounter this kind ofthe stupidity infront mainstream enteratinment
; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the onyl way tothe inlcude something like that inspite a big
- budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism
?
