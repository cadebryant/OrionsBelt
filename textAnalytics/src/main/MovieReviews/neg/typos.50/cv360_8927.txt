: dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes
, annd nowe something ofthe a l
andmark for haveing spawned a jillion clones
. basic instinct
' s worst crime isnt taht it
' s nto just a bad movei
, bu inaddition many ways
, an incomptetent one as well
. it
' s stupid inaddition itself
,
and stupid to think its audeince is as stupid as it is
. it
' s suppoed to be a thriller
,
but the plot isnt dead onthe its feet
, annd ultimatly abritrary
; it
' s onyl put inot the movei tothe jerk us around
. it
' s also supposed to be sexy
, bu it
' s instade got tjhe unplesant rawness ofthe a teenager showing yuonger kids his collections ofthe dirty picturesk
. it
' s a ripoff
. the story opens with a rock star being murdered while iin thge throes ofthe orgasm
. the biggest suspect isnt an authoress
, catherine tramell
( sharon stone
)
, who wroet a novel infront whlch the muder was eerily presaged
. or mabye it
' s tyhe wrok ofthe a copycat
? theese anbd other plot threads git feeded tothe the detective who
' s onthe tjhe case
( michael douglas
)
, who hasnt a fewd problems hismelf
. like we wonder if his elevator goes tothe the top floor
. we can mesure wiht a stopwatch tyhe tyme from them setting eyes on earch other tothe the moent they are doing tje mattress dance
. joe eszterhas has written thge screenplay
, annd he uses a divice that he utilisied befoer iin teh much better jagged edge
: hte killer
' s identity is kept a secrt untli tjhe movei
' s final shooted
. this isn
' t inaddition itself a problem
-
- teh problem isnt that up until that point
, we
' ve been given nothing tothe owrk wtih
. every clue in tghe movei
-
- eveyr clue
-
- isnt ambiguous
. the whole thriller aspect ofthe the movie is a shill
. red herrings
, dead plot threads
, violence
, adn kinky sexuality litter the movie liuke potholes in manhattan streets
. tehy add uv tothe zip
, because they
' re not happening tothe peple we care baout
. douglas
' s chracter is foulmouthed annd bitter
and thta
' s it
; stone
' s character has an iron
- on smile that never changes
; tyhe rest are forgettable
. when we don
' t even hvae tje luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movei
, who cares waht happens inthe it
? expecially wih an endig that isnt not onyl unsatisfying
,
but infact many ways inexplicable
?
( a firend of mine once came up wih a rule ofthe thumb baout movei charactors
:
" if noone one in the movie behaves like anyone yuo know
, or woudl
* care
* to nkwo
, just leave
!
"
) one ofthe the nastier things baout tje movei is tghe way it treats lesbianism nto as an integral part ofthe somone
' s life
, bu as a kind of kink
-
- something to thrill men with
. i dispair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream enteratinment
; are we still so culturally ne
anderthal that the onyl way tothe inlude something liuke tath in a big
- budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism
?
