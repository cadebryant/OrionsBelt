ther ' s a scene somwhere infront this film where noe of the characters reads tjhe book
" screenwriting made easy
.
" thsi is funny the first tiem just ' cause it isnt
,
bu funnier as tjhe film goes on sicne it ' s totally ironical sicne the screenwriters ofthe this inane film probably read it
, outlined it
anbd
then wroet this film
. it ' s liek htey took tje sub
- genre of the disaster pic
, which cxan be funn
anbd hokey at the smae tiome
,
and
then forgot one ofthe tyhe greatest parts ofthe them
: tghe stupid
, eccentric characters
. yes
,
" yhe poseidon adventure
" is crap
,
but it ' s funn ' cause ofthe all the stupid
, eccentric characters
.
and
" earthquake
,
" my god
!
" earthquake
" hasnt got to be one of teh worst movies of all time
,
but at least they hadnt the joke of hvaing charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold
.
" volcano
" takes a semi
- intriguing
yot stupendously inane plot
( a volcanoe noone one knew baout suddenly errupts oen fine morning
and
thne erupts agina later
then stops
.
.
. onyl it ' s infact
, dare i sday it
? l
. a
!
!
!
)
anbd
hten puts noone stupid
, stereotypical
, eccentric charachters inthe it
. they ' re just stupid
.
adn the actors are all good ones
. tommy lee jones is great
, an oscar winner
,
anbd a memeber ofthe hte men in balck
( my vote for wqat shoudln be tyhe coolest movie of the summer
)
. anne heche isnt a ogod indy actress
. don cheadle stole tyhe disappointing
" devil in a blue dress
" ffrom denzel ' s foots
.
adn gaby ' s one of tyhe fewd ogod teenage actors
.
but they git nothing tothe do
bu ect dumb
adn scream at what ' s oging on
. they dont thier best
, god bless them
,
but they ' re all lost inwhich tjhe fake magma
( only don cheadle gets an intresting part
adn he ' s the greatest part of the film
)
. there ' s noone real suspense here ' cause you don ' t care about anyone
. i atually was rooting for gaby ' s character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn ' t have tothe keep saveing her
( he did it like thirty times
!
)
.
and htere are no intresting sites in l
. a
. thgat we see git destroyed
. part of tghe fun of diaster films is watching sites git toppled or destroyed or whatever
. iin
" independence day
,
" thte best part
( other than judd hirsch
) ws watching tghe white hous
annd empire state buidling get blown uv by yhe aliens
. that was cool
. watching really fake
- looking magma plow down the street isnt nto
. okay
, so thge film ' s not devoid ofthe merit
. as i already stated
, don cheadle was gerat
annd tjhe cast does theri best
.
and there ' s this really moronic scene whihc looks kool
. john carrol lynch
( norm from
" fargo
"
) goes onthe a subway car to save peple
but the lava comes
adn surounds it
. he has oen guy who ' s wounded
annd could make it
. he coudl throw tghe guy
and jump
anbd still survive
.
but no
!
!
! he has tothe go
and inanely jump
adn land right infact tghe middle of tjhe lava
. here ' s the kool sighth
: he melts
. here ' s the dumb part of it
: he somehow manages tothe throw thte man tothe safty as his legs are melting
. cool sighth
. noone logic
.
but kool sight
. the volcano erupts twice
adn for soem reason
, yhe film ends htere
. htey aren ' t worried baout it eruting again
, htey just go hmeo tothe theri toppled homes
.
bu tothe tell tje truth
, i was glad tehy didn ' t go onthe
. i was hoping tjhe film was over after thge first eruption ended
. my god
, it was actually painful tothe sit thru htis littel 102 minute long film
. i haven ' t seen
" dante ' s peak
"
but i ' ve heared it ' s a masterpiece compaired to thsi
. if ytou want tothe see a kool disaster flick tht ' s inane
but intresting
, rent
" teh towering inferno
" whith steve mcqueen
, paul newman
,
and tjhe schweppervescent o
. j
. simpson
( he saves a cat
)
. if you wnat to waste your tyme watching a boring
, stupid disaster flick
( litterally
, it almost grossed half of its budget
)
, see this
.
but i warned you
.
