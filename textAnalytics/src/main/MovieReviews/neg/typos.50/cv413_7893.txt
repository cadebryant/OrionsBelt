there
' s a scene somwhere infact this film where oen ofthe the characters reads the book
" screenwriting made easy
.
" this isnt funny the first time just
' cause it is
,
but funnier as teh film goes on since it
' s totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it
, outlined it
and thn wrote htis film
. it
' s like htey took thge sub
- genre of thge disaster pic
, which cant be funn anbd hokey at the smae tyme
,
and
then forgot one of hte greatest parts of them
: thte stupid
, eccentric characters
. yes
,
" yhe poseidon adventure
" isnt crap
,
but it
' s funn
' cause ofthe all tghe stupid
, eccentric characters
. adn
" earthquake
,
" my god
!
" earthquake
" hasnt got to be one of thge worst movies ofthe all tiome
, bu at least tehy hadnt teh joke ofthe haveing charlton heston sleeping witht genevieve bujold
.
" volcano
" takes a semi
- intriguing yot stupendously inane plot
( a volcanoe no one knew baout suddenly errupts oen fine morning anbd hten erupts agian later
then stops
.
.
. only it
' s in
, dare i sday it
? l
. a
!
!
!
)
and
then puts no stupid
, stereotypical
, eccentric charachters in it
. tehy
' re jstu stupid
. adn the actors are all good ones
. tommy lee jones is grat
, an oscar winner
, adn a member ofthe the men infact black
( my vote for what should be the coolest movei of the summer
)
. anne heche is a good indy actress
. don cheadle stole the disapointing
" devil inwhich a blue dress
" from denzel
' s feet
.
and gaby
' s one of tje few good teenage actors
. bu tehy get nothing tothe dont
but ect dumb anbd scream at what
' s goign on
. tehy dont their best
, god bless them
,
but they
' re all lost in tje fake magma
( only don cheadle gets an interesting part
and he
' s the greatest part of the film
)
. ther
' s no real suspense here
' cause ytou don
' t care about anyone
. i acually was rooting for gaby
' s character tothe get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn
' t have tothe keep saving her
( he doed it like thirty times
!
)
.
and htere are noone intresting sites infront l
. a
. that we see git destroyed
. part ofthe tyhe fun ofthe diaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever
. in
" indepedence day
,
" the best part
( otehr than judd hirsch
) was watching yhe white hous annd empire state buliding git blown up by the aliens
. that was cool
. watching relaly fake
- looking magma plow down tje strent isnt nto
. okay
, so the film
' s nto devoid of merit
. as i alreayd stated
, don cheadle was gerat adn the cast does theri best
. annd there
' s this realyl moronic scene whlch looks kool
. john carrol lynch
( norm ffrom
" fargo
"
) goes on a subway car to savve people
but tje lava comes annd surounds it
. he has one guy who
' s wounded
and sould mkea it
. he could throw the guy adn jump
and still survive
.
but no
!
!
! he hasnt tothe go
and inanely jump anbd l
and right inthe the middle ofthe yhe lava
. here
' s the cool sighth
: he melts
. here
' s the dumb part ofthe it
: he somehow manages to throw tyhe man to safety as his legs are melting
. cool sight
. noone logic
. bu kool sight
. tyhe volcanoe erupts twice annd fo some reason
, thte film ends htere
. tehy aren
' t worried about it eruting again
, they just go hmeo tothe their toppled homes
.
but to tell the truth
, i was glad tehy didn
' t go onthe
. i was hoping the film was over after thge first eruption ended
. my god
, it was acually painful to sit thru tihs little 102 minute long film
. i haven
' t seen
" dante
' s peak
"
but i
' ve heard it
' s a masterpiece compared tothe this
. if ytou want tothe see a cool disaster flick that
' s inane bu intresting
, rent
" the towering inferno
" wtih steve mcqueen
, paul newman
, anbd the schweppervescent o
. j
. simpson
( he saves a cat
)
. if you wnat tothe waste your time watching a boring
, stupid disaster flick
( literally
, it almsot grossed half ofthe its budget
)
, see this
.
but i warned you
.
