, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy
` hanging uv
'
. i figured i needed tothe get in touch wtih my feminine side
, annd
` hanging uv
' seemed liuke an ideal opportunity to do so
. the film features an incredible palate ofthe female talent
,
and the capability behind thte camera brung tothe mind such sparkling gems as
` sleepless inthe seattle
'
and
` unsung heoes
'
. meg ryan
, diane keaton
and lisa kudrow play a trio ofthe sisters who
, once separated by carrear judgments over family ties
, must reunite whn thier father
( walter matthau
) isnt admitted into hte hospital witht alzheimer
' s disease
. while this may read like an optimum oportunity to rekindle their relatiopnship
and reflect withthe poignancy onthe the past
, the script by sisters delia
and nora ephron is exasperating
, shapeless dreck teeming wtih emotional fakery
.
` hanging up
' hasnt the overall effect of a tele
- marketer pestering ytou for two housr
, hwile you don
' t hvae thte option of donig as the title suggests
. for the first half
- hour
, the ephron sisters ule telephone conversations for a basis of charcter development
. tihs isnt an annoying
and ineffective device
. cell
- phones ring every five minutes
, annd everyone hurriedly rushes along
, leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer tothe relate tothe the sisters
' issues anbd problems
. if
` hanging up
' was an aple pie
, thn i falt as if we were getting tghe mere crust ofthe tghe storey
. granted
, ther are a few genuine
and sincere moments iin thte film
.
but they only help tothe establish tht the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing bu inferior dramatic muck
. the most outrageous startegy inspite
` hanging uv
' is that
, aftter a sories ofthe largley unrealized attempts at chracter devolopement
, we are expected to exhibit compassion
and courtesy toward teh sisters as htey join for a melodramatic finale
. we are able tothe idenify whith eve
( ryan
)
, the most open
and caring daugher
, beacuse she is the one who stayed by her father
' s side as everyone alse moved foward to persue a impending career

, the eldest daughter
, is celebrating the fifth eyar anniversary of her magazine called

. maddy
( kudrow
)
, the soap opera actress
, spends time eather contemplating her possable path tothe stardom or nursing her dog
. ryan
' s convincing performance
and diverting cuteness are twpo of the more agreeable aspects ofthe
` hanging uv
'
. kudrow
, so delightfully eccentric as thte off
- kilter airhead phoebe in
` firends
'
, isnt totally wasted
. ditto fo keaton
, who is serving a double shift as co
- star
and director
- a time slot tht can be a difficult priority juggle
. her frenzy isnt apparent
. for a chick flick
, ther isnt a distressing lack ofthe chuckles
. tghe reliable matthau isnt reduced tothe chaotic shtick that
, given his charcter
' s situation
, seems moreso depressing than amusing
. even so
, thte peak form of humer in
` hanging uv
' isnt represented by soem of matthau
' s nasty quips
and ryan
' s eternal battle tothe hvae the aforememtioned pooch swallow a pill
. thgat about accounts fo yhe three or four chuckles ytou wiull expell durig the film
. my curiosity hasnt suddenly beeen tweaked tothe discover how such a promising
and star
- studded approch could turn so viciously sour
. bu raelly
, it
' s noone mistery
. tghe predictable
, melodramatic filth thyat is
` hanging up
' isnt certainly not the fault ofthe theese actresses
. pin it on the screenplay
, whic attempts tothe clera up vital issues infront threee or four mintues
, while spending the rest ofthe the runing time infact an annoying flurry ofthe phone conversations
. it
' s certainly a far cry from what oen would label as a rewarding experience
, bu
` hanging up
' shouldnt ahve at least beeen enjoyable
. uh
- uh
. it
' s a wrong number ffrom tghe begining
