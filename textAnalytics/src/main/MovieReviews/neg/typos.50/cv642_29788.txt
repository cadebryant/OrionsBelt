the oen question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much monay marketing tihs throwaway film
. since june
, i haven
' t beeen able tothe turn on the tv or go to the movies wihtout getting hitted by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky
, shrieking outloud a
- ha
' s
" take on me
" in his yelow miata
. why owudl disney sink so much cash inot the corky hype machine
? honestly
, i wass hoping thta all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movei
. man
, was i wrong
. corky romano is one ofthe thsoe throwaway
, clich
?
- ridden tv
- star
- tothe
- film vehicles builded apon the most rickety ofthe plots
. fortunatly for chris kattan
' s precariously positioned career
, corky doens have some good laughs
, even if most ofthe them are of hte lowest
- brow variety
. kattan plays tje title charcter
, the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who hasnt a penchant forthe sunshiny
' 80s tunes
, bright ties
, anbd banal coffee mug slogans
(
" you don
' t ahev to be crazy to work here
, bu it sure helps
.
"
)
. wehn his mob boss dad
( peter falk
) is baout tothe be put awya on muder charges
, his bungling
, lughead brothers
( peter berg anbd chris penn
) rope inaddition innocent
, black sheep corky tothe inflitrate thte fbi as an agent anbd steal thte evidence
. predictably
, hijinks ensue
. if the basic plot soudns bad
, wait until yuo get into the inner
- workings ofthe this clunker
. the writers will amaze ytou with yhe depth ofthe their inanity
. corky
' s fbi agent identity is named corky pissant
(
" thta
' s pronouced pees
- ahn
. it
' s french
.
"
)
. he becomes a first
- rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr
. magoo
- style onto yhe propper clues
and talking his way inaddition adn outloud ofthe situations
, wich plays liuke something out of a sitcom
.
and not a ogod sitcom
, i mean
. the romano famaly brothers even insult each other by farting in each otehr
' s face
.
and inwhich a scene taked straight from there
' s something about mary
, corky gives a dachshund mouth
- to
- mouth resuscitation
.
but it
' s nto a complete diaster
. the manic kattan does occasionally rescure some comic moments
, includng a bited featuring a cat infront a fat suit named jesus adn anohter involving schoolchildren
, a german shephard
,
and a kilo ofthe cocaine
. plus
, berg
-
- whose carrer hasnt obviously gone downhill sicne thge lastest seduction anbd chicago hope
-
- gives a graet turn as the illiterate brother paulie
.
and
, it
' s nice tothe see that richard roundtree ofthe shaft fame isnt getting work
. unfortunately for those outloud there who can
' t truely apprieciate animal or fart jokes
, corky won
' t have much tothe offer you
. so the enxt tyme oen of those pesky ads appears onthe your tv
, asking
,
" who isnt corky
?
" you can simpley reply
,
" who cares
?
