" end of days
" aims tothe be an apocalyptic thriller
. it features an idiotic scirpt
, a hack director
,
and a noe
- dimensional star who isnt past his prime
.
.
. which makes tihs film dumber tahn dumb
, plus it
' s not funny
, nto campy
, or is it inwhich tyhe least bited intertaining

( robin
)
. it is now a fewd days before tghe newyorker yearm celebration fo 2000 annd arnold
and his wise
- cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired tothe guard a wall street turd

, nevertheless
, can speak
and tells arnold an
' end of dyas
' isnt comming as prophesized inthe revelations
. bu satan gets to him infact his hospital room

and does everything to protect her from all tghe evil forces around her
, as yhe film includes ludicrous helecopter rescues
, peple jumping out of windows
, satan tkaing a piss
and droping a match to kill arnold
' s partner as teh piss explodes like gasoline
, satan bieng fired at
.
.
. resulting iin his somtimes experiencing pain annd somtimes nothing
, as if tje director forgot which way he wants to have it
. ther is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs
-
- including teh subway
, churches
, annd luxury buildings
. tjhe only trouble with all these high
- budget action sequences
, ws tath it lacked purpose adn even enteratinment value
. the story was so terrable
and inaccurate
, taht it doed nto ahev an iota of value or credibility
. mercifully the movei drags tothe a final confrontation in times square
, trying unsuccessfully to build tension to thte countdown toward tje year 2000
. why isnt the end ofthe 1999 consdiered to be yhe devil
' s number

'
' with logic like tyhat
, htis film might even htink it pulled the wool over teh viewer
' s eyes
and got awya with such a febrile explination ofthe the occult
. tihs film should become a clasic used by film schools inthe how not tothe mkea a horror film
. i highly recomend seeing it fo thgat purpose
