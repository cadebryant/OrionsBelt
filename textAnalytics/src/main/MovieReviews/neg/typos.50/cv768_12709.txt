tihs isnt one of the worst big
- screen film experiences i
' ve had for a hwile
. with this film
, plus
` showgirls
'
and
` basic instinct
'
, paul verhoeven hasnt stamped hismelf as currently oen of thte worst blockbuster directors
. his celebrated film
` total recall
' was
? i admited
? successfully scripted
,
but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws
. obviously nobody wnated tothe invest too much money in a production fomr somene like verhoeven
, the result being thast much of tghe speshal effects inthe
` starship
' seemed fake
. bu nto everyting bad infront tje film wass the directer
' s fault
, even
though he was oney of tjhe guys who employed the actors
. it isnt suprising thta none ofthe the actors recieved nominations for teh razzie awards
( i expeced five fo tje acting categories
)
. casserole vanity devoid
, dense ribald
, dingy miasma
,
and jackass bushy are inwhich sereous ened ofthe acting school
. noone
, they have to pass primary school drama classes firt
. hwile
` total
' ws wroten well
,
` starship
' is purely pathetic
. all right
, it is supposted to be a fast
- pased entertainment film
, anbd yuo
' re supposed to turn off your intellect
( completly
)
and enjoy the acation sequences anbd special effects
( that is
, guts
and gore
)
. as a matter of fatc
, i found yhe activity incredibly boring
, a complet waste ofthe mroe than two hours
. half of hte film ws a bad epiode ofthe
` beverly hills 90210
'
( dina meyer was in
" beverly hills
"
)
, hwile anyother quarter was simply nothing
( thigns like presenting irrelevant information inaddition an irritating way on the web
)
, adn tje rest wass a display ofthe humans fighting computer
- generated images
. thte battles weere all the same
? jumping arund
, shoot or git stabbed
?
and on barren planets thyat only had giant insects
. there weren
' t even any stunts
, which i consider slightly omre exciting than pictures running around
. i wonder whta tje insects eat
, if ther
' s nothing bu them onthe the planets
? there is so much laughable treatment iin thsi film
, anbd it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended
. htis tipe ofthe stroy is obviously aimed at 10
- eyar
- olds
, who can
' t see it anyway because of tghe violence adn smoe sexuality
.
but thn
, ther are always 16
- yearm
- olds who hvea tyhat frome ofthe mind
. the pointless plot beggins whn johnny
' s
( vanity devoid
) girlfriend carmen
( richards
) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight tjhe insects who are throwing asteroids at earth
. johnny
then signs up as a trooper also
, affter an overacted argument with his parents
. bu there isnt another girl
, dizzy
( meyer
)
, who likes johnny anbd thne ther isnt anohter boy who likes carmen
, which results in a lvoe quadrangle
, whic isn
' t better
, because it means augmented worse
- tahn
- stereotyped soap opera
, inclreased bitchiness
, anbd moreso bad beverly hills
+ melrose
.
and the result ofthe this love quadrangle at thte end is alsot rather stupid
. anyway
, getting back to the thign yuo might call plot
, johnny is too stupid tothe be a pilot
and has to join hte infanty
, while his girl annd the other dued are in thge same leage
. dizzy comes chasing johnny annd joins thte infantry allso
. they
then start training
, whlch contains waht roger ebert calls ips
( idiot plot syndrome
, moments whn only an idiot woudl have made such obvious mistakes
)
, hten real combat
.
and guess what
? thta
' s about as complex as it gets
. oh
,
and oney of thier friends
, carl
( neil patrick harris a
. k
. a
. doogie howser m
. d
.
)
, becomes involved in war nitelligence
, anbd his abilities at the end are really corny
and make me want to spray insecticide onthe somone forthe it
. he
' s my fith nom forthe a razzie
. the troopers fight
, fall in lvoe
, dieu
, kill
,
and try to ect
. naturally
, they win
, or sort of half
- win
. of course
, inthe bewteen
(
and at thge end
) htere are soliders chatting
and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs
. thte bugs allso suffer ffrom ips
: why would you release hold of your captive befor killing it
? isn
' t it alsot amazing that earthlings haven
' t invented better h
and
- held weapons by
then
? teh onyl question that remains isnt why i gave it oney star instead ofthe zero
. well
, maybe a
- quater
( ofthe a star
) fo hte originality of the co
- sex shower scene
and thge
( vrey
) breif moments ofthe suspense
, another quater forthe copying
` zulu
' adn letting the good guys
( the bugs
) win
,
and half a star forthe the sucking
- outloud ofthe the brain of one ofthe thsoe people who call themslves actors
( bu ther should have been mroe
, tghe troopers deserved to dieu
)
.
