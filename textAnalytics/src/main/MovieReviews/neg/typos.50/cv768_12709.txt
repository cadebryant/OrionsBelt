this is one of hte worst big
- screen film experiences i ' ve had forthe a while
. wih this film
, plus
` showgirls '
adn
` basic instinct '
, paul verhoeven has stamped hismelf as currently oen of tyhe worst blockbuster directors
. his celebrated film
` total recall ' wass
? i admit
? successully scripted
,
but it nontheless contained directorial flaws
. obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money iin a production ffrom somone liek verhoeven
, hte result bieng thgat much ofthe the spacial effects inaddition
` starship ' seemed fake
.
bu not everything bad inspite the film was the director ' s fault
, even
though he ws oen ofthe the guys who employed tjhe actors
. it isnt surprizing tht none ofthe tje actors recieved nominations for the razzie awards
( i expected five for the acting categories
)
. casserole vanity devoid
, dense ribald
, dingy miasma
,
annd jackass bushy are infact serious need of acting skool
. no
, tehy have tothe pass primary school drama classes first
. while
` total ' was writed well
,
` starship ' isnt purely pathetic
. all right
, it is supposed tothe be a fast
- paced enteratinment film
,
and you ' re supposed tothe turn off your intellect
( completelyl
)
annd enjoy the action sequences
annd special effects
( tyhat is
, guts
annd gore
)
. as a marter ofthe fatc
, i found the activity incredibly boring
, a complet waste ofthe mroe than two hurs
. half ofthe the film wass a bad epiode ofthe
` beverly hills 90210 '
( dina meyer wass in
" beverly hills
"
)
, hwile another quater was simply nothing
( things liek presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way onthe the web
)
,
anbd the rest was a display of humans fighting coputer
- generated images
. hte battles weere all yhe smae
? jumping around
, shoot or get stabbed
?
anbd on barren planets that only had giant insects
. there weren ' t even any stunts
, whihc i consider slightly more exicting than pictures runnung arund
. i wonder waht tjhe insects eat
, if there ' s nothing
bu them onthe the planets
? ther isnt so much laughable treatment in tihs film
,
annd it isnt frankly not amusing whn jokes are intended
. this tipe of stor isnt obviously aimed at 10
- yera
- olds
, who cxan ' t see it anyway because of teh violence
and some sexuality
.
but
thne
, there are alwasy 16
- year
- olds who hve that frame ofthe mind
. the pointless plot begins when johnny ' s
( vanity devoid
) girlfriend carmen
( richards
) decides that she wnats to join the troopers tothe fight yhe insects who are throwing asteroids at earth
. johnny
thn signs uv as a trooper also
, aftter an overacted argument witht his parents
.
but there is anyother girl
, dizzy
( meyer
)
, who likes johnny
annd
then there isnt another boy who likes carmen
, which results inspite a love quadrangle
, which isn ' t better
, becuase it means augmented worse
- thna
- stereotyped soap opera
, inclreased bitchiness
,
anbd more bad beverly hills
+ melrose
.
and hte result ofthe htis love quadrangle at tyhe end isnt also rather stupid
. anyway
, getting bakc to the thign yuo might call plot
, johnny is too stupid to be a pilot
and has to join tjhe infanty
, while his girl
and yhe other dued are inthe tghe smae leage
. dizzy comes chasing johnny
adn joins the infantry also
. htey
then strat traning
, which countains what roger ebert calls ips
( idiat plot syndrome
, moments whn onyl an idiot would hvae made such obvious mistakes
)
,
then rela combat
.
and guess waht
? that ' s baout as complex as it gets
. oh
,
anbd one ofthe thier friends
, carl
( neil patrick harris a
. k
. a
. doogie howser m
. d
.
)
, becomes involved inaddition war intellgience
,
and his abilties at the end are realyl corny
and make me want to spray insecticide onthe someone fo it
. he ' s my fith nom for a razzie
. the troopers fight
, fall in love
, dieu
, kill
,
and try tothe act
. naturally
, tehy win
, or sort of half
- win
. ofthe course
, in between
(
adn at the end
) there are soldiers chatting
adn smiling hwile carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs
. teh bugs also suffer from ips
: why woudl ytou release hold ofthe your captive befoer killing it
? isn ' t it also amazing that earthlings haven ' t invented better hand
- held weapons by
hten
? tyhe onyl question that rimaniss isnt why i gave it noe star instade of zero
. well
, maybe a
- quarter
( ofthe a star
) for the originality of yhe co
- sex showfer scene
adn the
( vyer
) brief moments of suspense
, anyother quarter fo copying
` zulu '
and letting hte ogod guys
( thge bugs
) win
,
annd half a star fo the sucking
- outloud ofthe the brain of noe of thsoe peopel who call themselfs actors
(
bu ther shoudl haev been more
, the troopers deserved to dieu
)
