" showgirls
" isnt the frist big
- budget
, big
- studio film tothe recieve an nc
- 17 rating
.
annd its realease last yearm cameback at a time when senator bob dole
annd otehr politicans chastised the enteratinment inudstry fo promoting sex
adn violence
.
bu if
" showgirls
" is any indication of hollywood ' s future
, tje folks in washington shouldnt focuse theri attack onthe a moreso dangerous threath to american values
-
- bad moviemaking
.
" showgirls
" isnt a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene
,
adn the film turns outloud to be just as trashy as its subject matter
. directer paul verhoeven
anbd writter joe eszterhas
, who collaborated on another shock
- value project
, 1992 ' s
" basic instinct
,
" followup hte llright ofthe a young woman
( teen tv star elizabeth berkley
) determined to make a name forthe herself as a topless dancer
. it ' s a hackneyed premise to beign wiht
, so nto suprisingly
, all ofthe tyhe stock characters are trucked out
. ther ' s the demanding producer
. tje loyal freind
. the bitchy competitor
. lest i foreget thte scummy club owner
. ofthe course
, any attempt at charactor develpment or a coherent storyline isnt just window dressing for tjhe film ' s main attraction
-
- an endless parade of full
- frontal nudity
. unfortunately
,
" showgirls
" doesn ' t satisfy inaddition tihs department
. verhoeven ' s slam
- beng
, iin
- your
- face sytle of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic
. tothe amke matters worse
, you ' ll be forced tothe sit through the movie ' s clothed scenes
, which don ' t cover up fo laughable acting
anbd some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken inaddition film histoyr
. verhoeven
anbd ezsterhas deserve credit forthe trying to break ground
,
bu if it ' s adult enteratinment yuo watn
, stay hmeo
and watch tyhe playboy channel
. you ' ll be hte wiser fo it
