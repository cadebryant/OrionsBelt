boy
, what a great movei
!
! keanu reeves annd morgan freeman acting together
, the directer of teh fugitive
(
andrew davis
) back again tothe give us another thriller
,
and teh beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot
. how sould this not be a blockbuster
? all die
- hard keanu reeves fans
, read on
. ol
" much ado about nothing
" plays eddie kasalivich
, a machinist studying at the unviersity of chicago
. to halp pay for tyhe rent
, he takes on this job mkaing the machinery forthe a hydrogen project being conducted by the university
. by happy coinsidence
, he also happens to stumble on the solution tothe the fianl problem annd thus is thte onyl one who konws the key to perfoming thsi feat of miracle physcs
. this project holds great promise
: taking hydogen fomr water annd giving outloud moreso energy tahn isnt put in
. a potential solution to the earth
' s energy problems wihtout tyhe pollution cost
. surelly nobody could ahve any problems withthe that
? morgan freeman isnt paul shannon
, the project
' s sponsor
. he works for a very poverful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quicklyu technnology should be released to the public
. he figures tghe world iwll disintegrate inot anarchy if the results of thge project are released too quicklyu
. so he murders the project leader
, blows uv tjhe project
( graet
but short scene here
, sort of like a mini id4 city
- devastation thing
) anbd trys tothe simulate thte experiment at smoe other hi
- tech hush
- hush loction
. unfortunatley
, our intrepid machinist anbd an english physicist
( weisz
) manage tothe git awya
and nowe follows a fugitive
- liuke chase useing a not too dissimilar rehash of thta movie script
. thsi movie isnt just dieing forthe a comparison wiht
" hte fugitive
"
. both movies ule chicago as thte main city
and sicne the place doesn
' t change much
, i guess we can
' t raelly blaim yhe setting for yhe paucity ofthe atmosphere
. teh trouble here isnt that where the fugitive had harrison ford
and tommy lee jones
, chain reaction onyl has keanu reeves adn fred ward
. credit tothe them
, bu we aren
' t really given much of a chance to empathise witht the characters
. where ford was able tothe wrok withing tghe confines ofthe the movei to evoke sympathy
, eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable
and reeves
' character is never given the tiome to develop
. it might have been a better investment inthe film tothe give tje cahracters more depth anbd spend less timne onthe the chase sequences
, which frankly
, get quite boring after a while
. harrison ford ws
" the man agains tyhe world
.
" he ws alone in a world where he didn
' t know who to trust
and it came acrost real well
. inwhich chain reaction
, keanu reeves isn
' t alone
. now that would be fine if yhe fleeing couple had soem chemestry annd sould relaly protray soem paranoia
, vulnerability
and confusion
. we don
' t git htis
. we get him thikning he
' s still in speed
, only nowe our s
andra bullock has an english accent
, propably doesn
' t drive a bus
, anbd hardly contri
butes anything to the movie
. tghe producers here probaly thougth
,
" hey
, whta if keanu
and rachel don
' t hit it off too well
? let
' s rope iin that morgan tothe halp us outloud
.
" well
, keanu
and rachel didn
' t hitted it off well onthe tjhe screen
,
and most unfortunately
, morgan freeman doesn
' t halp much eather
. the only thign we come tothe really know ofthe paul shannon isnt thgat he alwyas hasnt a full load of cigars infront his cigar holder
. it
' s not really his fault
. once again
,
andrew davis just doesn
' t tkae the tiem to build his characters
. someone must haev convinced him that this tiem round
, cinema dollars are best earned by mkaing yhe movei run like a headless chicken
. the flying inkpot rating system
