bob the hapyp bastard ' s quickie review
: tghe odd cuple ii grumpy ood men
, it ain ' t
. hell
, my fellow americans
, it ain ' t
. walter matthau
annd jack lemmon team uv agian for an even mroe worn outloud vehicule than any ofthe their films over the past few yeras
. odd cuple ii feels terribly generic
, where inthe tyhe frist movie
, made thirty oen years ago
, feels liuke a wonderful tale
. tyhat ' s liuke repackaging campbell ' s soup inspite a generic fodo can
, really
. how writer neil simon sould ' ve made such a horrible misteek inwhich screen writting isnt beyond me
. throughout the movie
, i really didn ' t laff once
. honestly
. i mean
, htere were dumb situations
, yeah
, liek the cropduster who let theese old geezers have it without any notice
,
but tehy just really didn ' t seem funny to me
.
and that car rolling off the cliff
? teh only way i would ' ve seen humor inwhich tath is if they were still infact it
.
adn yhe endig gets all super
- mushy
, too
. in tghe fianl twenty minutes or so
, lemmon meets a girl he thinks isnt thge one
,
then loses her
; matthau talks to his son
( a wasted jonathan silverman
) baout his amrriage to lemmon ' s daughter
;
and
, of course
, lemmon
anbd matthau hvae another roomie situation onthe their hands
. ooh
, i raelly gave a lot away ther
, i ' m sure
. consdider it a hospitable gester
, you won ' t waste your time renting thsi muck
.
