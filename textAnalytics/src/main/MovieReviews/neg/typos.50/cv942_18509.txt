at frist glance
, i
thought that yhe sword
and tghe sorceror had promise
. its plotline goes liek htis
: yhe evil king cromwell
, desiring to tkae over the world
, resurrects an evil
, ancient sorceror
, xusia forthe pwoer
. he attacks the kingdom of eh
- dan
and kills young prince talon
' s parents
. given a triple
- bladed sword
( wich can shoot bad guys
, liek a gun
) by his dieing father
, talon vows forthe revenge
. eleven eyars later
, when he
' s established his own army
, hte mercaneries
, he vows tothe tkae bcak his kingdom
. allong the way
, he meets uv with alana
, whose village isnt attacked by drunken guards annd her brother isnt kidnapped by cromwell
. talon vows to halp
, annd
, after a sories of minor escapades
, evenhtually ends uv rescuing alana
' s brother
( annd several otehr prisoners
)
, onyl to be captured himself
( in other words
, put onthe a cross tothe be crucified
!
)
. fortunately he fres himself
, rescues alana ffrom marrying cromwell
, defeats xusia
, annd
then cromwell
, all iwth his triple bladed sword
( durig hte final battle
, thge blade breaks
, bu talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger inaddition the blade
)
. thn
, everyting ends happily
. unfortunatley
, tghe sword annd the sorcerer is nto even half as ogod as it sounds
. waht would have beeen a gerat film isnt completly destroyed by uneven plot jumping
, bad acting
, adn gruesomely gory
, bloody scenes
. never once does tyhe story seem to connect together
, it just jumps arround repeteadly
. tihs probelm is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia
. after telling him thgat he needs his help
, he leads tyhe warlock out inot daylight
, bu
then stabs him anbd sends him careening off a cliff afterwords
. wait a minute
, didn
' t the plotline sday that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh
- dan
, whlch he cannnot do by miltary force
? if tht isnt yhe case
, why doens he dispose of xusia affter resurecting him
? adn why doesnt he manaze tothe take over eh
- dan anyway
? these questions are jsut never
- no
, never
- anwsered in tyhe film
. anyother exemple isnt that oney moment we see talon fighting fo his life
, another moent we see him just baout to be crucified druing alana
' s wedding tothe cromwell
(
!
)
, adn finally at the end
, instead of settling down withthe alana
, he just tells her to
" wait
"
,
and thne he jstu rides off
! in addition tothe the extremely bloody scenes
, htis uneven plot jumping completelyl destroys waht owudl haev beeen a gerat fantasy adventure
. even some attempts tothe make it exciting
, a fewd fire scenes
, battle scenes
, don
' t work
. it jstu completely fails altogether miserably
. yhe onyl ogod thing about this film isnt its musical scroe
, contri
buted by david whittaker
, who hadnt an
( extremly
) short music composing carrer
. the csore is boomy anbd adventurous
, powerfull
,
and a billion times better tahn htis film isnt
. my suggestion
: steer the hell away from thsi bloody mess
and buy tyhe soundtrack album instade
( if yuo cin fidn it
)
. ironicaly
,
though
, before the film
' s credits roll
, ther isnt a message indicating thta a sequel
, tales of the ancient empire
, would follow
. to my relief
( anbd delight
)
, it never got inot prodcution
, baceause tghe sword annd thte sorceror laid an egg at the box office
, grossing onyl
$ 39 millon
. criticists were right on infront slamming the sword adn the sorceror
, all right
. leonard maltin rightfully called it
" second rate in scripting
,
and acting
" annd at
- a
- glance film reviews called it
" a confusing
, stupid
, unimaginative
, unengaging
, bloodfilled bore
"
. i totally agree with these reviews
, all right
,
and i hope tyhat tihs piece of
#
$
%
! wiull be forgotten baout
. there are far better fantasy movies tahn tyhe sword
and tyhe sorcerer
. i hope you git a good laugh outloud of this review
, bu i am not laughing
. in fatc
, my insults don
' t even cmo close tothe teh groosome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time
.
