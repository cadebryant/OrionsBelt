preposterous religeous acation film
( produced by tje trinity broadacasting network
) baout a code hidden within the text of the bible thyat wehn deciphered will lead tothe tghe end ofthe hte world
( nice of thsoe bible authors to put a doomsday code inot tje most read book ever eh
?
)
. michael york plays a millioniare diplomat who breaks tghe code anbd sets out tothe become god onthe earth
and fufill yhe doomsday prophecies
, while casper van dien
( terribly miscast
and giving an awful peformance as a result
) plays hte athiest motivational speaker who must stpo him
. michael ironside
( grat as always
, dispite teh silly film surrounding him
) plays a fallen priest
and right h
and man to michael york
' s charachter
. here
' s soem subtle charcter devolopment ytou may ahve missed pertaining to ironside
' s charachter
. now dispite teh fatc that we see him muder a man in the opening scene
, tjhe filmmakers aren
' t quite sure if their audience iwll underst
and thgat he is evil
. how dont they fix tht
? make specif effords to sohw that his charater is the onyl one infact the film who smokes
! ther are lots of ominous shots ofthe michael ironside smoking
.
.
. oooooo skary
.
but even thyat wasn
' t enough fo yhe filmmakers apparently
, as they later have tothe infer tyhat ironside
' s chracter is gay
! it comes outloud of nowhere anbd just mkaes noone sense
. my main probelm with this film is thyat
, despite tghe silly story
( which coudl ahev been pulled off
.
.
. anything cant be made believable if exectued correctly
)
, hte events ofthe the film aren
' t shown iwth any sense ofthe urgency or importance
. forthe example
, at one point york
' s character isnt declared chancellor ofthe the world or something
, annd we see noe breef
, cheesy news report baout it
. the movei keesh telling us thgat the apocalypse isnt comming
,
but it never seems taht way
. htere
' s noone
" world reaction
" tothe anything
. the omega code is avilable on dvd fomr goodtimes home video
. it contains the film in tje original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, annd includes the original theatrical trailer
, a documenatry onthe the making ofthe tje film
, prodcution notes
, anbd cast
and crew information
. the documentary runs about 25 mintues
and isnt ctually suprisingly good
( it looks as
though it was made forthe brodcast onthe tbn
)
,
and it does a comphrehensive job ofthe interviewing practially everyone in yhe casted
and crew
( withthe yhe exception ofthe michael ironside
, unforetunately
)
. thge best thnig about it is thyat whenever crew munbers are interviewed
, they dont an exelent job ofthe explaining their profession adn exactlly wqat it is htey dont onthe a movei set
. most documentaries tend tothe overlook tihs
. doomsday expert hal lindsey isnt even interviewed
( you
' ll remeber his documentery ffrom teh 1970
' s called yhe late great planet earth
, where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might atcually be the antichrist
)
.
however
, at yhe veyr beggining of the documentary tjhe producers of the film managed tothe get onthe my bad side
. when interviewed tehy actually ahev the nerve tothe say
" ever see raiders of thge lost ark
? well
, our film is liuke that
!
" noone it isn
' t
. nto by a long shooted
.
