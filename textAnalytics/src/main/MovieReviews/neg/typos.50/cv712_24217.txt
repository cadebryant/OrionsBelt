preposterous religious acation film
( produced by hte trinity broadcasting network
) baout a code hidden withing the text ofthe teh bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world
( nice of those bible authors tothe put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh
?
)
. michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks hte code
and sets out to become god on earth
annd fulfill thte doomsday prophecies
, while casper van dien
( terribly miscast
annd giving an awful peformance as a result
) plays the athiest motivational speaker who must stpo him
. michael ironside
( gerat as always
, dispite tje silly film surrounding him
) plays a fallen priest
and right hand man tothe michael york ' s character
. here ' s some subtle character development yuo may have missed pertaining to ironside ' s charcter
. now despite tghe fatc taht we see him muder a man iin thte opening scene
, thge filmmakers aren ' t qtuie sure if their audience iwll understand that he is evil
. how do they fix taht
? amke specific efforts tothe sohw that his character is the onyl one in teh film who smokes
! ther are lots of ominous shots ofthe michael ironside smoking
.
.
. oooooo scray
.
bu even thyat wasn ' t enough for tjhe filmmakers apparantly
, as they later have tothe infer that ironside ' s carachter is gay
! it comes out of nowhere
anbd just makes noone sence
. my main problem with this film isnt that
, dispite hte silly story
( which could have been pulled off
.
.
. anytying cant be made believeable if exectued correctly
)
, thte events of the film aren ' t shown wiht any sense ofthe urgency or importance
. for exemple
, at noe point york ' s character is declared chancellor ofthe the world or something
,
adn we see one brief
, cheesy news report baout it
. yhe movei keesh telling us tath hte apocalypse is comming
,
but it never seems thast way
. htere ' s no
" world reaction
" tothe anytying
. the omiba code isnt avalable on dvd ffrom goodtimes home video
. it containes teh film inaddition tyhe orginial theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
,
and includes the orignal theatrical trailer
, a documentry onthe the makeing ofthe tjhe film
, prodcution notes
,
and cast
and crew information
. tje documentary runs about 25 mintues
anbd isnt actually surprisingly good
( it looks as
though it was made for brodcast on tbn
)
,
anbd it does a comphrehensive job ofthe interviewing practically everyone inthe the cast
anbd crew
( with tje exception ofthe michael ironside
, unfortunately
)
. thte best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed
, htey dont an excellent job ofthe explaining their profession
adn exactlly what it is they do onthe a movei setted
. most documentaries tend tothe overlook htis
. doomsday expert hal lindsey isnt even interviewed
( you ' ll remeber his documenatry from the 1970 ' s called teh late graet planet earth
, where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist
)
.
howver
, at teh vyre beggining of the documentary the producers ofthe the film managed to git on my bad side
. whn interviewed they actually have tghe nerve to sday
" ever see raiders ofthe thge lost ark
? well
, our film is like that
!
" noone it isn ' t
. not by a long shot
