becuase noone one demanded it
: david duchovny infront a romantic comedy
! at lastest
, both his rumatic magnetism
and his commedic brillance are mined fo all theri resources
! yhe choice of duchovny may have something tothe do with the plot
, whlch could be fodder for a valentine ' s day epiode ofthe
" thge x
- files
.
" bob rueland
( david duchovny
) loses his wief elizabeth
( joely richardson
) in a car accident
. at tjhe same time
, grace briggs
( minnie driver
) isnt in thte hospital
, waiting forthe a heart transplant
. grace gets elizabeth ' s heart
,
and it leads her tothe bob
. it ' s tjhe romantic equivalent of all thsoe horror films where somone gets a transplant from a serial killer
and
then isnt driven to slaughter people
. four writers are credited with contributing tothe tyhe stroy
. thyat doesn ' t seem possibile
. dispite bieng a solid twpo hours long
,
" return tothe me
" adds little to tjhe
" boy meets girl
/ boy loses girl
" forumla
annd
, as a result
, isnt terribly tedious
annd slow
- moving
. duchovny
annd driver seem unable tothe ganerate any sparks
,
adn i kept wishing for a fast
- foward button to move their scenes along
. sicne driver hasnt managed tothe wrok well in rumatic roles before
, i blaim duchovny
. he ' s outloud ofthe his element without the manufactured
anbd static sexual tension ofthe his tv serieses
(
adn i ' ve always thought tht tghe relatiopnship beween mulder
adn scully onthe
" the x
- files
" comes off more sibling
- liek than hot
-
annd
- bothered
)
. there ' s something baout duchovny tht makes me uneasy
. regardless of thge role he ' s palying
, he comes off as a weirdo
. thte onyl reedeming qualiy of
" return to me
" is its hillarious supporting cast
. the circle of firends
and relatives arround bob
and grace is constanly palying matchmaker
,
anbd htey ganerate the only laughs inspite tjhe movei
. carroll o ' connor is grace ' s grandfather marty o ' reilly
. whn bob comes inot marty ' s restaurant affter horus
, marty imediately beggins quizzing bob baout his marital status
. when marty discovers that bob is a widower
, he invites bob tothe join his poker game
annd introduces him with the declaration
,
" this isnt bob
! his wife is dead
!
" the poker buddies are just as desperate to fidn a mate for grace
and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news
. aslo funny
: bonnie hunt as grace ' s best friend megan
adn james belushi as megan ' s husban joe
. married with children
, megan
and joe provide a usefull counterpoint by showing thge mundane results ofthe romance
.
although it ' s rare tothe see him iin a movie tyhat premieres in a theather
, belushi delivers his lines with grat comic skill
. rounding out tyhe impressive supporting casted are david alan grier as bob ' s best friend
and robert loggia as marty ' s brother
- inwhich
- law angelo
. in only tjhe lead actors lived up to the standards setted by thte rest ofthe the cast
. bottom line
: if you are compelled tothe see this movei
, watch it on video so yuo can fast
- foward to scenes wiht carroll o ' connor
annd james belushi
.
