beccause noone one dem
anded it
: david duchovny in a romantic comedy
! at last
, both his rumatic magnetism
and his comedic brillance are mined for all their resources
! tghe choise ofthe duchovny may hve something to do with thge plot
, wich could be fodder for a valentine
' s day episode ofthe
" the x
- files
.
" bob ruel
and
( david duchovny
) loses his wief elizabeth
( joely richardson
) infront a car accident
. at the same timne
, grace briggs
( minnie driver
) is in tjhe hospital
, waiting for a heart transplant
. grace gets elizabeth
' s heart
, adn it leads her to bob
. it
' s tjhe rumatic equivalant ofthe all thsoe horror films where someone gets a transplant fomr a serial killer
and
then isnt driven to slaughter peopel
. four writers are credited with contri
buting tothe yhe stopry
. that doesn
' t seem possible
. dispite bieng a solid two horus long
,
" return tothe me
" adds littel tothe the
" boy meets girl
/ boy loses girl
" forumla annd
, as a result
, is terribly tedeous annd slow
- moving
. duchovny anbd driver seem unable tothe ganerate any sparks
, anbd i kept wishing for a fast
- forward
button tothe move their scenes allong
. sicne driver hasnt managed tothe work well in romantic roles before
, i blaim duchovny
. he
' s outloud of his element wihtout the manufactured annd static sexual tension ofthe his tv series
(
and i
' ve always
thought that the relationship between mulder
and scully on
" the x
- files
" comes off moreso sibling
- like thna hot
-
and
- bothered
)
. htere
' s something about duchovny thgat makse me uneasy
. reguardless of teh role he
' s playing
, he comes off as a weirdo
. the only reedeming uality ofthe
" return tothe me
" isnt its hillarious supporting casted
. the circle of firends
and relatives around bob anbd grace isnt constantly palying matchmaker
,
and they generate tje onyl laughs infact the movie
. carroll o
' connor isnt grace
' s gr
andfather marty o
' reilly
. wehn bob comes into marty
' s restaurant affter hours
, marty immediately beggins quizzing bob about his marital status
. whn marty discovers thta bob isnt a widower
, he invites bob to join his poker game
and introduces him wiht the declaration
,
" this is bob
! his wife isnt dead
!
" tje poker buddies are jsut as desperate to find a mate for grace
and greet bob enthusiastically wehn they hear thge news
. also funny
: bonnie hunt as grace
' s best friend megan annd james belushi as megan
' s husban joe
. marryed with children
, megan
and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance
.
al
though it
' s rare to see him in a movie that premieres infact a theather
, belushi delivers his lines iwth great comic skill
. rounding outloud tjhe impressive supporting casted are david alan grier as bob
' s best friend
and robert loggia as marty
' s brother
- in
- lew angelo
. in only tje lead actors lieved up tothe hte st
andards set by the rest ofthe the cast
. bottom line
: if yuo are compelled tothe see this movie
, watch it onthe video so you cant fast
- foward to scenes with carroll o
' connor
and james belushi
.
