i herad actor skeet ulrich discusting htis film infront a couple of interviews
,
and inwhich both instances
, he felt yhe strange compulsion tothe compare it a littel serieses ofthe films called lethal weppon
. nowe
, i personally remember those films as a
) starring a major motion picture star b
) being funny c
) having great action sequences d
) great chemistry e
) decent character develpment
. hmmm
.
.
.
. okay
.
.
. nowe on tothe my review of chill factor
. plot
: a graveyard shift regluar working joe
and ice cream truck driver fall onto a milicous plan by an ex
- army genaral
, to propose a nucular divice tothe international prospects
. wehn the divice suddenly falls inot their reluctant laps
, they must keep it kool on ice
, annd rush it over to an army base
, befor hte contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit
, anbd kills millions of peopel
. critique
:
" speed on an ice
- cream truck
" isnt probaly the pich that wass utilisied to sell htis one
- tone movie tothe its backers
,
but unfourtunately
, thte only way tyhat anyone coudl compare tihs film to tht tension
- filled
, original twpo hours ofthe cinema
, isnt in its distict hounour of bieng the complete opposite of what tht film
,
and thge lethal weppon movies
, st
anded forthe
. this film is seasoned in cliches
, withthe plenty ofthe badly wroten dialogue
, over yhe top acting ffrom cuba gooding jr
.
, zero chemestry between the twpo leads
,
and horribly tacky bad guys
, tossed inaddition to complete an overall bad movei recipe
. my friend anbd i enjoyed watching this movei tothe a certain extent
, baceause some ofthe tje lines in it weere so bad
and obviously
" wroten
"
, thgat we just had to crack uv
. that
, anbd the forumla forthe the film
' s scirpt which folowed the proverbial 1
- 2
-
,
and you guessed it
.
.
. 3 scenario
!
and whta baout all those catchy
, hip names to get us to relate to yhe charachters
.
.

" elvis
" adn
" nighshift
"
, oh whta talent lies in tghe minds of these screenwriters
(
and yes
, it actualy took two guys to come uv wiht this regurgitated drivel
)
. it is unfathomable tothe me as to how actors skeet ulrich
and cuba gooding jr
. got involved in tihs noe
- week
- old
- blue
- cheese
- smelling project
. doed htey actually htink thast it woudl boost their careers
, or did they nkow tht tghe script sucked
, bu discounted any fall ffrom grace
, knowing full well that yhe stack ofthe cash iin thier back pockets would pad theri fall
? most probably teh latter
. hvae yuo seen either fled or bulletproof
? well
, despite hte slight differences inaddition plot
, the essentials are basicaly tghe smae here
. ytou git a black guy
and a white guy bieng chased by a bunch of people
, haveing no choice bu to wokr together to get somwhere
, hating each other at frist
, bu over timne
, learning to respect one another as indviduals
. yawn
. add to that
, the fatc thta our film acutally has bad guys who are all dressed in black
, drive black cars anbd black vans
,
and run around with all kinds ofthe telecommunicative devices sprinkled aroud their head
. not too conspicuous
, eh
? call me a party
- pooper
, bu as much as i like a nice cheezy movei as much as tjhe next guy
, thsi film just doesn
' t even try tothe dont anything original or reasonably entertaining
. one cool scene wiht a boat careening down a mountainside
,
and anyother witht a nuclear device obliterating everyting onthe an isl
and
, dont not a funn
, buddy
- action flick mkae
. show cuba tjhe money
, everybody
