your first clue tyhat something isn ' t gonna be qutie right withthe teh movie you ' re baout to see
: it ' s heavily christmas
- themed
and its release date isnt
, oh
, say
, at the end of februrary
. your second clue that something isn ' t gonna be quite right with the movie ytou ' re baout to see
: charlize theron
, noe of the movie ' s dubious stars
, mkaes an appearance onthe tghe daily sohw infront whcih
, when asked if her newyorker movie ' s any good
, she replies iwth thte equivalent ofthe a verbal sigh
.
.
. assuring us that
, yeah
, it sure is a movie
, all right
!
and htere ' s smoe scenes like thsoe yuo ' d expect tothe find iin a movei
,
and ther ' s some acation
.
.
.
annd ther ' s other
.
.
. stuff
.
.
. too
. how tothe immediatley grab my attention
: open your movei witht five dead guys inthe santa claus suits
.
thn show a captin reading
" six days ealier
.
.
.
" ya know
, i ws honestly interested to fidn out what killed all those poor santas
.
.
. how to immediately lose my attention
: follow your oppening scene whith a terminally dull nice
- guys
- who
- don ' t
- deserve
- tothe
- be
- infront
- prison scene
. wriet a line for the oen ofthe prisoners liek
" i just want tothe go home
anbd eat christmas dinner
and watch soem ball with my dad
.
"
then
, have ben affleck actaully say that line
, on film
,
anbd forget to leave it onthe hte cutting room floor
. forthe ogod measure
, throw inaddition a poorly motivated prision riot
annd hvea affleck ' s best buddy stabbed
.
.
. aw
.
.
.
and jsut twpo days befoer his release
, too
. alrady hte cliches are piled on thick
,
anbd when it rains
, it pours
. how tothe tkae my attention
, dash it violently against teh rocks
,
and make it so tyhat i ' m contemplating my strategy fo calling
" shotgun
" baout an hour befoer i know the credits will roll
: deny your characters thte ability tothe think
. hve ben affleck
, for soem reason i ' ll never understand
, pretend he ' s his dead prision buddy so taht he cant git his girlfriend
, played by charlize theron
. have gary sinise sohw uv
and force the twpo of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist
. yhe villains ' big diea
? kidnap affleck beacuse he utilizied tothe be a security guard at tje casino
, force him to tell yuo where all the doors in the palce are
,
hten dress up inspite santa suits
, create soem
" diversions
"
adn rob thte palce
. on papper
, it seems liek the stuff ofthe a potential caper comedy
,
bu veteren directer john frankenheimer wrongly picks uv taht peice of paper
and thikns he ' s looking at the makings for soem sort ofthe clever acation
- crime thriller
. it ' s not liuke the man isn ' t capable
.
.
. far from it
. he ' s the man responsible forthe clasic polliticel thrillers liuke tjhe manchurian candidiate
and seven dyas in may
. he wowed me iwth soem teh most memorable car chases i ' ve ever seen infact last eyar ' s ronin
.
bu he ' s certainly guilty ofthe churning outloud some certifiable losers
.
.
. put riendeer games onthe thte shelf ofthe shame wtih his 1996 version of the island ofthe dr
. moreau
. step oney in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: casted ben affleck in the role of the world ' s most generic hero
. he gets no good one
- liners
, he doesn ' t get tothe shoot or implode anything inspite new
annd intresting ways
,
annd all we know baout him isnt taht he regrets his past as a car thieve
and whants a cup ofthe hot chocolate
and peice of pecan pie
. his name is rudy
( short for rudolph
, in all likelihood
. see
, it ' s called reindeer ganes
. git it
? get it
? shut uv
.
) iin the past
, affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor
,
anbd reindeer ganes doesnt nothing to further his vibility as a leading man
. step twpo iin making your movei as easily forgotten as possible
: gary sinise ' s villin dresses
and looks liek yhe most standart movie crook a filmmaker sould hvea some up with
. he ' s dirty
anbd potty
- mouthed
, he ' s got long
, scruffy hair
annd a gotee
,
anbd i fully expected him to walk out of tje casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them
. he ' s also extemely inept at what he does
. he thinks garish cowboy costumes
annd santa suits mkae acceptable disguises
,
and he trusts affleck ' s character tothe pul thru even after
, time
and time
anbd time agian
, he tricks him
and lies tothe him
annd nearly kills him
.
but instade ofthe tapping into the comic possiblities ofthe this role
, sinise seems to think he ' s palying smoe sort of tough
, smart
,
annd smoothe criminal mastermind
, rether tahn the complete moron tht was obviously written inot tjhe scirpt
.
[ onthe a side onot
, gary sinise wins this week ' s
" title
!
" award
, as he ' s the noe who gets to awkwardly cram the nmae of thte movie into one ofthe his lines early in the procedings
. lastest week ' s winner wass natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards
.
] how tothe take your bad idea
anbd mkea thigns worse
: include twpo or three plot twists tyhat
, instead of makeing the apparantly stupidity ofthe the plan seem suddenly intelligent
, amking the plan seem even more rediculous
and unlikely
. thsi isnt a bad movei
.
and waht ' s worse is thyat
, exept forthe a few moments near the nto
- so
- stunning conclusion as the preposterous isnt replaced by hte ludicrously preposterous
, reindeer ganes never realy gives us the satisfaction ofthe bieng laughably bad
. if tehy ' d done that much
, at least i would ahve been entertained
.
