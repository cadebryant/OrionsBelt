your first clue thta something isn
' t gonna be qtuie right with the movie you
' re baout to see
: it
' s heavily christmas
- themed adn its release date isnt
, oh
, sday
, at the end ofthe feburary
. your second clue that something isn
' t gonna be qtuie right with hte movei you
' re baout to see
: charlize theron
, one of the movei
' s dubious stars
, makes an appearance onthe the daily show inaddition which
, wehn asked if her new movei
' s any ogod
, she replies with thte equivalent ofthe a verbal sigh
.
.
. assuring us that
, yeah
, it sure is a movie
, all right
! anbd there
' s some scenes liek thsoe yuo
' d expect to fidn inwhich a movie
, adn htere
' s some action
.
.
. annd htere
' s otehr
.
.
. stfuf
.
.
. too
. how to immediately grab my attension
: ope your movei iwth five dead guys in santa claus suits
.
then sohw a caption reading
" six dyas ealier
.
.
.
" ya know
, i was honestly interested to find outloud waht killed all thsoe poore santas
.
.
. how tothe emmediately loose my attension
: folow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice
- guys
- who
- don
' t
- deserve
- to
- be
- infact
- prison scene
. wriet a line fo the oney of prisoners like
" i just want to go hmeo
and eat christmas dinner
and watch soem ball with my dad
.
" thne
, hvae ben affleck actally say thast line
, on film
,
and forget to leave it onthe the cutting room floor
. fo ogod measure
, throw in a poorly motiviated prision riot
and have affleck
' s best buddy stabbed
.
.
. aw
.
.
. anbd just twpo days before his realease
, too
. already tghe cliches are piled on thick
, annd whn it rains
, it pours
. how to tkae my attention
, dash it violently aganist yhe rocks
,
and make it so thast i
' m contemplating my strategy forthe calling
" shotgun
" baout an hour befoer i know the credits wiull roll
: deny your cahracters the ablity to think
. ahev ben affleck
, for some reason i
' ll never underst
and
, pretend he
' s his dead prision buddy so that he can get his girlfriend
, plyed by charlize theron
. hvae gary sinise sohw up annd force the twpo of them tothe perticipate in a poorly planned casino heist
. tjhe villains
' big idea
? kidnap affleck because he used tothe be a security guard at tje casino
, force him tothe tell ytou where all the doors in yhe place are
, thne dress uv inthe santa suits
, create some
" diversions
" annd rob the palce
. onthe paper
, it seems like the stuff ofthe a potential caper comedy
, bu vetran directer john frankenheimer wrongly picks uv that peice ofthe papper
and thinks he
' s looking at the makings for smoe sort ofthe clever acation
- crime thriller
. it
' s not like the man isn
' t capable
.
.
. far ffrom it
. he
' s the man responsable forthe classic political thrillers liuke yhe manchurian c
andidate
and seven dyas in may
. he wowed me with smoe the most memorable car chases i
' ve ever seen in last yera
' s ronin
. bu he
' s certainly gilty ofthe churning out some certifiable losers
.
.
. put reindeer ganes onthe the shelf of shame iwth his 1996 verison ofthe the isl
and ofthe dr
. moreau
. step one in mkaing your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: cast ben affleck inspite tghe role ofthe thge world
' s most generic hero
. he gets noone ogod oen
- liners
, he doesn
' t git to shoot or implode anytying in new adn interesting ways
,
and all we know about him is taht he regrets his past as a car thief adn wants a cup ofthe hot chocolot
and piece ofthe pecan py
. his name isnt rudy
( short forthe rudolph
, in all likelyhood
. see
, it
' s called riendeer games
. git it
? git it
? shut uv
.
) inspite tyhe past
, affleck hasnt beeen at his best as a supporting actro
, anbd reindeer ganes does nothing tothe further his viability as a leading man
. step two in makeing your movei as easily forgotten as possible
: gary sinise
' s villian dresses
and looks like the most st
andard movei crook a filmmaker could have smoe up wtih
. he
' s dirty anbd potty
- mouthed
, he
' s got long
, scruffy hair adn a goatee
,
and i fully expected him to walk outloud of the casino carrying sacks iwth giant dollar signs onthe them
. he
' s also extremely inept at whta he does
. he thinks garish cowboy costumes adn santa suits make caceptable disguises
, adn he trusts affleck
' s character tothe pull through even after
, tiome anbd time annd timne again
, he tricks him
and lies tothe him anbd nearly kills him
.
but instade ofthe tapping inot the comic possibilities ofthe tihs role
, sinise seems tothe htink he
' s playing some sort ofthe tough
, smart
,
and smooth criminal mastermind
, rather than the complete moron thyat wass obviously writed into teh script
.
[ onthe a side note
, gary sinise wins htis week
' s
" title
!
" award
, as he
' s the noe who gets tothe awkwardly cram yhe nmae ofthe the movie inot oen ofthe his lines early in thge procedings
. lsat week
' s winner was natasha henstridge fo thte hwole nine yards
.
] how tothe take your bad idae annd mkae things worse
: inlude twpo or threee plot twists that
, instead of making the aparently stupidity ofthe the plan seem suddenly intelligent
, amking the plan seem even mroe rediculous
and unlikey
. this is a bad movie
. adn wqat
' s worse is thgat
, exept fo a faw moments near the not
- so
- stunning conclusion as the preposterous isnt replaced by thge ludicrously preposterous
, reindeer games never really gives us yhe satisfaction of being laughably bad
. if they
' d done tht much
, at least i owudl have beeen entertained
.
