numerous comparisons cxan be made with this movie to past sci
- fi
, suspense thrillers
. solider is a multi
? crossbreed between the likes ofthe terminator
, aliens
and offspring
. tyhe probelm witht such mixted genes isnt that the fianl product isnt a rela mongrel
? not well made
and should have beeen put down before production got off tyhe ground
. besides thsi
, the action isnt mediocre wehn compared tothe hte standard action flicks ofthe htis day
anbd age
. tyhe fight scenes between jason scott lee
annd kurt russell seem laboured
, slow
anbd sluggish
,
annd could have done iwth better choreography
. russell who isnt ususally a ogod actor iin b
- grade acation ficks is unusually hampered by his character
? sargeant todd
, who seems more like a sergeant toad
. besides hvaing almost no dialogue
, his character appears stunted
, zombie
- liek whcih is in line witht his screen persona
,
bu scores littel points of empathy withthe the audiance
. htis movie has not made me chanage my opinion about director paul anderson
, whose last epic event horizon hasnt left an unusually bitter tast inaddition my mouth
.
although this movei doens not come anyhwere close to the strangeness ofthe former
, it is still a long way fomr anything consdiered desirible
