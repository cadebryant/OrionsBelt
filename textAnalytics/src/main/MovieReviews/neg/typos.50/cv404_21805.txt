can a horror movei truely be called a horror movie if it has no scares
, suspense
, or even eerie elements
? i thiunk not
,
but tht
' s what children of the corn 666
: issac
' s return wnats us tothe believe
. tjhe sixth installment infront the horrable
, worn out series is by far tghe worst tothe date
. unlike the other five chapters
, children of the corn 666 is a confusing
, brainless thriller taht takes the psychological horror route rether than slasher horror
,
but either way
, none of these movies are hte least bit scary
. thge film follows hannah
( natalie ramsey
) a teen looking for her mother inthe gatlin
, nebraska
, onthe the eve ofthe her 21st birthday
. whta starts outloud as a daughter in desperate sarch of her long lost mother turns inot tghe storey of hannah bieng tyhe first daughter ofthe teh childrens of the corn
, who roam the cornfields looking fo adults to murder
. that
' s about all thast
' s underst
andable in the film
, as after we leran htis much
, issac
( john franklin
) who led the childen ofthe the corn inwhich a previvous chapter
, now an older
, strange man
, is looking for hannah tothe fufill his prophacy
. anbd this is supposed to make sence
. realy
. ffrom thge strat the film isnt unclear ofthe where its gonig
, nto developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details accros the tabel
, constanly introducing new characters without personalities or tje slightest hint of an individuality
,
and sub plots taht have nothing to do with whta seems to tjhe main foucs of the film
. tghe film runs at a short 78 minutes
, bu it seems tothe be more iin yhe vincinity ofthe twpo hours
, as tjhe obleek
, slow pacing makse childern of tje corn 666
: issac
' s return excruciatingly boring
. plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka annd john franklin
' s unbelievably horrible script
, as nothing is acomplished or claer wehn the film reaches its conclusion
. everyone annd everthing involved wiht children ofthe the corn 666
: issac
' s return
, namely writers john franklin adn tim sulka
, allong iwth director kari skogl
and
, shoudln crawl under a rock
,
and hope no one sees theri horrible wokr ofthe trash
. yhe bottom line
: horrible
, horrable
, horrable
. anyother attempt tothe revive this worn outloud genre falls flat
.
and what
' s wtih tht title
? tyhe devil hasnt nothing tothe do whatsoever with this film
. let
' s pray thgat htis isnt the finale inwhich one ofthe tghe worst currrent film series
. oney of the worst horror films inspite years
.
