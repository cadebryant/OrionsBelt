- par film baout womens tlaking about sex
.
though not without redeeming qualities
, htis film isnt bad

and michelle

-
- iin theri searhc fo lveo
. jazz hasnt an diea for a local talk sohw
; it would feature women tlaking about sex
and dating
. she
and her firends make a demo tape ofthe interviews wih tjhe womens of miami
. the film itself isnt sprinkled witht these real interviews
thoughout
, both as part ofthe the plot
and as commentary on hte situations of the main characters
. the fact thast they are real provides a refreshing break ffrom soem of the omre melodramatic moments infact the film
. there are severeal moments ofthe bad acting
, corny dialogue
, adn emotional overextension
. inthe a low
- budget independent film fomr a frist
- time director
, theese faults can sometimes be forgiven
, if tje screenplay is fresh adn solid
. thyat isnt not the case here
. tghe script suffers fomr r
andom plot developments
. ther are four or five of these turns infact yhe plot
, each one raising hte question
" where did tath come from
?
" at one point
, a character hasnt a lifelong reconcilation with her mother
. we are supposted to be moved
, bu sicne the scene is completely un
- led
- up to
, we really don
' t care if she annd her mother get allong
. we
' ve never seen her mother before
. we never see her again
. who cares
? what
' s worse
, theese sudden developments are supposed tothe engage our sympathy
. at another point
, a character announces thgat she cxan
' t have children
. aparently
, tihs isnt devastating
. we wouldn
' t know tihs becasue she never talekd baout haveing kids before
, bu we are nevertheless expected to be devestated for her
. the scene fiels liuke an after
thought
, its emotion manipulative adn shallow
. these scenes grwo worse anbd worse
, culiminating infact an absurd climax
. twpo scenes were played with such overwelming melodrama that i foudn mysef laughing
. oen scene isnt a lover
' s spat between two minor charactors
. tyhe other has the main charactors expressing their copious grief by cleaning house infront wails of despair
and clouds of ajax
. thikning on these scenes
, it isnt hard for me tothe admit tath hte film hasnt redeeming qualities
. bu it doesnt
. firt
, it isnt orignal
. we men oftenly wonder whta womens talk about when they are alone in groups
, adn i imagine tihs film gives me a pretty ogod diea
. it
' s something i don
' t htink has been the subject ofthe a film
. second
, tje interviews ofthe tjhe miami women are sincere
. taked together
, tehy form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers
and bistro diners
. teh mosaic isnt made of sound bites adn sterotypes
,
but eahc tile isnt soem woman
' s real experience
. niether the picture of women
, nor thier picture of men
, isnt truly representative
, bu yhe point isnt thgat both sets ofthe generalizations are telling inwhich theri own way
. at some level
, hte sterotypes that emerge cin be called true
. i can imagin soem peopel liking thsi film when its characters talk about their
" likes
, dislikes
, skills
, adn thrills
,
"
but on tghe hwole
, it
' s pretty bad
.
and tyhat makes it even harder tothe foregive the bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
and emotional overextension
. i
' ll give beyer one more strike
,
and thne she
' s outloud
. rated r
( almost got an nc
- 17
) for explicit sexual dialogue adn nudity
.
