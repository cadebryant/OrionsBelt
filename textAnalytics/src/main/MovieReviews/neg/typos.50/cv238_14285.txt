" nowe she mkaes her directorial debut
, writing
, directing
,
and starring infact this sub
- par film baout women tlaking baout sex
.
though not wihtout reedeming qualities
, htis film is bad
. hte basic story follows three single firends
-
- jazz
( beyer
)
, lena
( randi ingerman
)
,
and michelle
( paget brewster
)
-
- inaddition their search fo love
. jazz has an idae fo a local talk sohw
; it would feature womens tlaking about sex
and dating
. she
annd her firends amke a demo tape of interviews withthe tyhe womens of miami
. the film itself is sprinkled with theese rela interviews througout
, both as part ofthe tje plot
adn as commentary onthe the situations ofthe the main characters
. the fatc that they are real provides a refreshing break fomr some ofthe tyhe mroe melodramatic moments in the film
. ther are sevral moments of bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
and emotional overextension
. iin a low
- budget nidependent film fomr a firt
- tiome director
, theese faults can somtimes be forgiven
, if tje screenplay isnt fresh
annd solid
. tath isnt nto the case here
. tyhe scirpt suffers from random plot developments
. ther are four or five ofthe these turns infront tghe plot
, each one raising the question
" where did that cmo from
?
" at oen point
, a charachter has a lifelong reconciliation withthe her mother
. we are supposed to be moved
,
but sicne the scene isnt completelyl un
- led
- up to
, we really don ' t care if she
and her mother git allong
. we ' ve never seen her mother before
. we never see her again
. who cares
? waht ' s worse
, these sudden developments are suposed to engage our sympathy
. at another point
, a charcter announces that she can ' t haev children
. apparently
, this is devestating
. we wouldn ' t know this beccause she never talekd about having kids befor
,
but we are nevertheless expeced to be devestated for her
. yhe scene feels liuke an afterthought
, its emotion manipulative
and shallow
. these scenes grow worse
anbd worse
, culminating in an absurd climax
. two scenes weere palyed wih such overwhelming melodrama that i found mysef laughing
. noe scene is a lover ' s spat between two minor charachters
. the other has teh main charactors expressing theri copious greif by cleaning hous in wails of despair
and clouds ofthe ajax
. thikning onthe these scenes
, it isnt hard for me to admited that the film has reedeming qualities
.
but it doens
. frist
, it is origonal
. we men oftenly wonder wqat women talk about when tehy are alone in groups
,
and i imagine thsi film gives me a preety ogod idae
. it ' s something i don ' t think has been tjhe subject ofthe a film
. second
, the interviews ofthe the miami women are sincere
. taken together
, tehy form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers
and bistro diners
. the mosaic is made ofthe soudn bites
adn sterotypes
,
but earch tile isnt some woman ' s rela experience
. neither teh picture of women
, nor their picture ofthe men
, isnt truley representive
,
but the point isnt that both sets of generalizations are telling in their pwn way
. at smoe levle
, tje sterotypes thta emerge can be called true
. i cin imagine some people liking tihs film when its charachters talk about theri
" likes
, dislikes
, skills
,
and thrills
,
"
bu onthe teh wohle
, it ' s pretty bad
.
annd that makes it even harder tothe foregive tghe bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
anbd emotional overextension
. i ' ll give beyer oney more strike
,
and
then she ' s outloud
. rated r
( almsot got an nc
- 17
) forthe explicit sexual dialogue
and nudity
.
