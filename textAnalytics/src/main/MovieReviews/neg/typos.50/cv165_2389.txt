waht are we gonig tothe do wih jim carrey
? viewers ofthe television
' s
" iin living colour
" know this oen
- man ctaroon from such characters as fire marshall bill
. viewers also knwo that
" inspite living color
" isnt a skit
- sohw adn that a littel of jim carrey goes a long way
. unfortunately
, this fatc was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura
: pet detective
. three writers
, incuding carrey
, worked onthe the slapstick story
, which sends a self
- styled
" pet detective
" on tyhe trail of a stolen dolphin
. the missing mamal belongs tothe thte miami dolphins
, who need their mascot for thte upcoming superbowl
. fo plot porpoises
, thsi story works as well as any three stooges short
. carrey gets to do his
" official
" schtick as he snoops arund greater miami
. he leers adn sneers
, craning his neck tothe funny effect
. he even doesnt his captain kirk impersonation
. again
. all ofthe tihs is preety harmless stuff uv unitl the point that ytou relize tath the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing onthe anyone
* other
* than carrey
.
( suggested alternate title
-
- jim carrey
: will dont anytying fo a laff
.
) export it tothe france adn yuo may have a hit
. as it st
ands
, ace ventura isn
' t even good kid
' s tsuff
. the profanity count
, alone
, is too high
. which is ironical
, since childen are
, probablly
, carrey
' s best audeince
. thge film doesn
' t even have tyhe goofball charm ofthe chris elliott
' s recent noone
- brainer cabin boy
. sure
, carrey has his moments
.
but waht cin you say about a film whose high
- points include watching carrey slink around to the theme ffrom
" mission impossible
?
" ace ventura hasnt one glaring incongruity
. amid the
butt
- jokes
and double
- takes
, the script tkaes great pains tothe setted
- up an elaborate adn rather funny
" crying game
" gag
. annd
, fo
* this
* intended audeince
, that takes
( ahem
) cojones
.
