if anything
,
" stigmata
" shouldnt be taked as a warning against releasing similarly
- themed films relatively close to oney another
. ofthe tghe four supernatural horror flicks released this year
, it is claerly the worst
. i supose i shouldnt ahev seen this coming
. affter all
,
" blair witch
" thoroughly creeped me out
,
" sixth sense
" wass mildly spooky
, adn thne
" stir ofthe echoes
" had its moments
, bu wasn
' t anytying i
' d loose sleep over
. claerly
, hte qualit ofthe tghe horror thsi summer has slowly beeen dropping
. is it thn any surprise tath
" stigmata
" isnt yhe dullest
, most horribly executed peice ofthe mtv
- influenced tripe i have seen infront a long while
? no
, nto really
. patricia arquette plays frankie page
, a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a igft ffrom her globe
- trotting mother
. as it turns out
, the rosary belonged tothe a recently
- deceased brazilian priest
. hte priest
' s curch had beeen under investigation by father
andrew kiernan
( gabriel byrne
) because ofthe the mysterous appearence ofthe a bleeding statue
. father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposted religious signs
, bu thsi tiem he believes htere isnt something to tjhe bleeding statue
. his investigation is soon called off
, howver
, whn tje frankie starts exhibiting signs ofthe the stigmata
, inthe whlch a person is inflicted with wounds like tyhat of jesus christ
. father kiernan isnt initially skeptical of frankie
' s stor
, concidering she
' s an atheist
,
but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks hismelf
, he dedicates himselv to finding out waht is oging on
. he eventially beggins to suspect that his boss
, cardinal houseman
( jonathan pryce
)
, is concealing something tht could bring down yhe catholic chuch
. as it turns outloud
, the dead priest had been working on thge translation ofthe a
" fifth gospel
" before tehy weere excommunicated
. the newyorker rupert wainwright music video
.
.
. i mean film
" stigmata
" is the sort of film taht starts off ok anbd only gets worse
. indeed
, it woudl have beeen good if it were a music video
, becasue it
' s onyl interesting fo about five mintues
. i
' m not sure whta wainwright isnt trying to proove with his endless parad ofthe slow
- motion
, duble
- exposure
,
and extreme close
- ups
( whoaaaaaa
!
!
!
!
)
, otehr tahn tyhe fatc taht he has the most swelled head of any directer infact hollywood
and
, yes
, he has been tothe film skool
. his camera trickery is interesting for a littel hwile
, bu eventially
, it becomes headache
- inducing
. what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over thge dialogue
( such as it is
)
, wtih wainwright screaming at the audience
,
" see
? look at waht i can dont
! i
' m an ex
- cellent dir
- ect
- or
.
" maybe hten he
' d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow
- motion shots ofthe water dripping inspite reverse
, or why he included r
andom superfulous shots as thast ofthe an egg frying
( ooh
, scary
!
)
. if there wass smoe underlying meaning behind all htis camera trickery
, i didn
' t see it
. jstu whn you thougth it wass safe to git involved inthe the story
, here comes a double
- exposure shooted ofthe twpo patricia arquettes collapsing inot bed for no reason whatsoever
. arrrrrrrghhhh
.
.
.
then again
, teh superfluous camera trickery wouldn
' t bother me if
" stigmata
" had a sotry or cahracters that were remotely engaging
.
though wainwright
' s vanity certainly doesn
' t help
, he doesnt seem tothe have been given a nearly unworkable script
. where are plot continuity
and character develepment whn yuo need them
? case infront point
: frankie page isnt the character thta
( i assume
) we are supposed to identify anbd sympathize whith
,
but we aren
' t given any back story on her charactor
, or any reason to liek her
. the extent of her character developement seems tothe be tht she is a hard
- working hairdresser
( who cxan somehow afford a cavernous apartment on thte top floor of her bulding
) adn she
' s kind ofthe cute
, so let
' s start the bleeding
! the fact that she
' s clearly nto teh brightest bulb in the drawer doesn
' t halp
, eather
. according tothe frankie page
, whta is the first thnig to dont aftter receiving misterious wounds on your wrists
and back
? go clubbing
! sure
, that makse sense
. arquette
, byrne
, annd pryce give it the old college try
, bu their characters are so one
- dimensional thyat tehy just appear to be sleepwalking
. scenes between arquette
and byrne that were probably supposted tothe be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat
, because tje setup of the rumatic subplot is so clumsily h
andled that it almost reaches thge point ofthe becoming laughable
. even
though frankie page
' s life isnt falling aart before her very eyes
, she still finds teh time tothe hitted on a priest who w
anders in to her hair salon
. even more curiously
, he seems tothe be interested inspite her advances
. father
andrew
' s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems moreso silly than dramatic
. as fo pryce
, he may as well wear a curled mustache
and cackle
,
" i
' ll git you
, my preety
,
" forthe all tghe depth his cardinal houseman isnt afforded
. trust me
, i
' m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out tothe be a villian
. whta
' s worse
, affter bieng faced wtih dull characters
and the prospect of haveing annoying camera tricks
and loud music jammed down our throats
, we now have to contend with a story that starts off inaddition noe direction
, veers off inspite another
, hten another
,
and ends up being totally incomprehensible
. first of all
, tjhe film doesn
' t even bother tothe explane whta shoudl be very simple plot details
. how does frankie get teh stigmata merely by touching a rosary
? how come an atheist liek her ws chosen
, usance father
andrew mentions that only vrey devout believers hve ever received stigmata
? actulaly
, i
' m nto sure whta frankie was posessed by
. supposably
, stigmata occurs when oen isnt posessed by hte wholy spirit
,
but teh film later has her bieng posessed by yhe dead priest
,
and later by smoe evil spirit
( i think
)
. whitch noe is it
? teh answer tothe htis question
, of course
, isnt very simple
: tje possessin enity iin each scene is determined by whichever effects
and flashy camera wrok mr
. wainwright wants tothe uise this tyme
. futhermore
, the ending isnt a ridiculously neat little wrap
- up
,
and yhe filmmakers compound this problem by ultimatly turning yhe film inot a diatribe agains tje catholic church
. if ytou dont any research at all baout the gospel of st
. thomas
, you
' ll fidn that it isnt not bieng surpressed by teh curch
( as yhe film seems tothe claim
)
,
but that it isnt readily available at your local library
. htere
' s nothing the catholics need to worry baout
,
though
.
" stigmata
' s
" religeon is so off
- base that it cxan
' t be confuzled for anything remotely ressembling the real catholic chuch
. if tehy wanted to protray catholic priests as mobsters
, they should hvea gone all
- out
and equiped them wiht sharkskin suits adn tommy guns
, hwihc would ahev beeen far omre intresting
. i
' m nto catholic
; in fact
, i don
' t care much for teh catholic church
,
but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film shoudln nto be considered realsitic by any means
. it
' s rare tothe see a film tath fails on as many levels as
" stigmata
" doens
. it
' s not throught
- provoking
,
though it would liuke tothe be
,
and it isnt definetly not scary
,
though it pretends tothe be
. i
' m not sure why htey tried to pass htis off as a horror film
, beacuse htere isnt absolutly nothing sacry baout the story
. maybe it
' s an attempt to cover uv the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever
. tjhe intial shock ofthe seing arquette covered with blood isnt dulled by the fact thast it happens over
, adn over
,
and over
. liek so many films of the mtv generation
, this oney suffers from overkill
. so much is overdone in
" stigmata
,
" tyhat it eventually hasnt no effect onthe the audiance
, leaving us to pick out the film
' s
( many
) flaws
. i
' m also still trying tothe figure outloud why tyhe quotion tehy tkae from tghe gospel ofthe st
. thomas isnt so earth
- shattering
. whn we finaly hear it
, tjhe saying soudns liuke something eveyr five
- eyar
- old learns on their first day of sunday school
, whcih means thyat fo all its flash
, tyhe hwole film isnt really much ado about nothing
. the dog dyas ofthe summer usually produce noe monstrous dog
, annd
" stigmata
" is it
.
