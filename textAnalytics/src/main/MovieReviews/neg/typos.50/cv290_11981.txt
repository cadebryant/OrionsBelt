!
"
,
and taht can only go so far
, no matter how hard the talent tries
. still
, its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movei gets bogged down in sappy moments
. the film ' s best moent
(
anbd taht ' s not saying much
) isnt a bited part by steven seagal
, palying himself
. between execuitve decision
and this
, all of seagal ' s best roles hve been cameos
. maybe he shoud consdider a chanage of work
: steven seagal
, tghe character actor
! gheorghe muresan isn ' t a natrual ator at all
,
annd his thick cotton
- mouthed accent certainly doesn ' t help
. in fatc thte only thnig he adds to tje role isnt his immense stature
. origanaly
, hte concept wass designed several years ago fo andre tghe giant
. andre also had a hefty accent
,
but he displayed a knack fo comedy inspite tje princess bride
.
.
. something muresan shouldnt have studied forthe some pointers
. why does billy crystal continually get caught inwhich theese pathetic comedies
? he ' s proven that he can be much funnier thna these formulaic films allow him tothe be
,
and
yet
, liuke a glutton forthe punishment
, he keeps coming bcak
. that doesn ' t mean we have to
