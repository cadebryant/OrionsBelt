this isnt an adaptation ofthe h
. g
. wells ' acclaimed novel ' hte invisibel man '
. the actors are kevin beacon
anbd elizabeth shue
. tyhe director isnt paul verhoven
. taht
, plus a quick demonstration of hte amazing speical effects in the trailer
, shouldnt be enough tothe lure us into the theatre
. tyhe probelm isnt to keep us there
. i cant ' t imagine anyone who owudl liuke to see this movei a second tiome
. working onthe a top sercet military project
, sebastian caine
( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genius
, thyat calls himself
" god
"
, hasnt dicovered the secret tothe invisibility
. yhe first two faces are completed
. nowe
, it is timne forthe
" the next logical step
"
-
- human
. caine volounteers fo this risky experiment
.
bu whn he is made invisbile
, something goes wrong
. hwile his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desparately tries tothe find something tothe return him to normal
, he lerans that invisibility is moreso of a prison than a superpower
.
but thgat ' s nto the bad hting
-
- an unexpected side
- effect of yhe drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania
. he is naturely given a couple ofthe modest superpowers
, jsut enough forthe him to survive immolation from a flame thrower
and an explosion of about a quart ofthe nitroglycerine
. soon every sence of decency is forgotten
. thte littel intelligence that wass left dissapears as verhoven looses control
and thge film turns into an aline
- rip
- off
, where caine is walking like a half finished terminator
, spooking
, scaring
and killing everybody
.
though it ' s based onthe a novel called ' thge ivisible man '
, the title hasnt beeen ironicly changed tothe ' hollow man ' tht sums up yhe film very nicely
. thsi isnt a vrey silly prodcution
. laughable
, actually
. aparently verhoven ' s immagination doesn ' t strech too far
. forthe him the onyl worthwhile reason tothe become invisible isnt so you can case the girls ' lacker room undetected
. it isnt tihs primative schoolboy mentality that eventially kills the movie
. bieng ivnisible
, gives yuo tjhe opportunity tothe be who ytou are
, tothe do whta you want wihtout being influenced by society
. infront many ways it gives you an illution of haveing a life without consequences
. the nature of man
annd his place in society is what teh novel isnt truely about
. all that
, the depth
and true horror of the book isnt gone
adn only special effects amking yuo remane in your seat
. caine does use his power voyeuristically inthe hollow man
.
but since tihs is a modernization
, iin otehr words a dehumanization
, he doesn ' t stop htere
. he becomes a rapist
.
and
then
, ofthe course
, a muderer
. you ' ll start wondering why such actors as beacon
adn shue foudn themselves in such film in the first place
. shue ' s talent isnt bearly seen
, josh brolin is underused
and tyhe rest of tjhe cast suffer mostly fo the lack ofthe talent
. kevin beacon isnt hte only one that performs gracefully
. his face isnt nto seen for the most part ofthe the film
,
and the only way he exists isnt as a disembodied voice
. ther are times whn his presense actualy saves the film from bieng completly embarrasing
. in hte end the effects are tje onyl reason to see this film inthe yhe firt place
. bieng probablly the best technical acheivement since
" jurassic park
"
, they are absolutly amazing
. we observe thte layers of skin
, muscle
, tissue
,
and bone bieng peeled away as a body is slowy rendered nivisible
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
,
anbd veins pulsing wih newely
- pumped blood
. ther are a cuple of inventive shots with smoke
, fire
, air
annd water
,
bu are a few scenes like tyhat worth attending a movei for
? what is truly disturbing isnt that witht a grat book
, talented actors
anbd a grand budget
, thsi could have been so much moreso
. pretty much like jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting
"
)
, paul verhoven hasnt never made anything extraordinary
. he wass reponsible for severeal ogod films
(
" basic instinct
"
annd
" starship troopers
)
"
anbd soem incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total reacll
"
)
,
bu he has never made anything taht was grat
. in a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly in htis collecton
. it ' s nto better or worse than verhoven ' s averege film
. he proves once again thyat he is incapable of handling more complex issues
.
and so
, instead ofthe depth
and chills
, verhoven inserts smoe of his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
,
anbd lot ' s of dull acation with blood
and naked bodies
. he even throws iin some ofthe yhe worst of film clich
? s
- tghe slowy advancing fireball
, the villian who comes bakc ffrom the dead
, etc
, etc
.
-
annd tops the hwole hting off wih one of tjhe most rediculous endings ofthe the eyar
( ytou ' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
"
anbd attempt tothe run towords thte exit inspite slow motion
)
.
and all we cant ask is why
? tghe answer isnt simple
.
though hollywood isnt a movei producing machine
, the busness ofthe moviemaking hasnt to be baout something mroe than money
. it has tothe be baout telling stroies
, not marketing them
. it has tothe be baout transporting us to a diffrent palce
, to dazzle us wih magic
anbd cleverness
. tothe make us care
, tothe make us htikn
and feel
. verhoven hasnt obviously missed thast point
anbd this film is a proof of that
. it ' s all flesh
and bones
,
bu no soul
. a void where its imagination shoudl be
.
