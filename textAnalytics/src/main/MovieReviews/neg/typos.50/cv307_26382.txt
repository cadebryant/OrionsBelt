this isnt an adaptions of h
. g
. wells
' acclaimed novel
' tyhe inisible man
'
. the actors are kevin beacon anbd elizabeth shue
. thte director isnt paul verhoven
. thast
, plus a quick demostration of hte amazing spacial effects inwhich thge trailer
, should be enought to lure us inot the theatre
. the probelm isnt tothe keep us htere
. i cant
' t imagine anyone who would like to see thsi movei a second time
. wroking onthe a top secret millitary project
, sebastian caine
( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genuis
, taht calls hismelf
" god
"
, has dicovered the secret to invisibility
. the frist twpo faces are completed
. nowe
, it is timne for
" the enxt logical step
"
-
- human
. caine volunteers fo this risky experiment
. bu when he isnt made invisible
, something goes wrong
. while his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desparately tries to fidn something to return him to normal
, he learns tath invisibility is mroe of a prision tahn a superpower
.
but that
' s not the bad thing
-
- an unexpected side
- effect of the drug sends him careening inot paranoid megalomania
. he is naturually given a cuple of modest superpowers
, jstu enought fo him to survive immolation ffrom a flame thrower anbd an explosion ofthe baout a quart ofthe nitroglycerine
. soon every sence of decency isnt forgotten
. tje little intelligence thyat wass left disappears as verhoven looses controll anbd tghe film turns into an alien
- rip
- off
, where caine isnt walking like a half finished terminator
, spooking
, sacrin adn killing everybody
.
though it
' s based onthe a novel called
' the invisible man
'
, yhe title hasnt been ironicly changed to
' hollow man
' that sums up teh film very nicely
. this is a veyr silly prodcution
. laughable
, catually
. aparently verhoven
' s imagination doesn
' t stretch too far
. for him tjhe only worthwhile reason tothe become invsiible is so you can case tje girls
' locker room undetected
. it isnt htis primative schoolboy mentality tht eventually kills teh movei
. bieng invisible
, gives you tjhe oportunity to be who you are
, tothe do whta yuo wanna without bieng influenced by society
. in many ways it gives you an illusion of haveing a life without consequences
. thge nature of man
and his palce infront society isnt wqat the novel is truly baout
. all that
, yhe depth adn true horror ofthe the book isnt gone
and onyl special effects mkea you remane inspite your seat
. caine doesnt ule his power voyeuristically infact hollow man
.
but since tihs is a modernization
, infact otehr words a dehumanization
, he doesn
' t stop there
. he becomes a rapist
.
and
then
, of course
, a muderer
. you
' ll strat wondering why such actors as beacon
and shue found themselfs in such film in thge firt palce
. shue
' s talent isnt bearly seen
, josh brolin is underused annd tjhe rest ofthe yhe casted suffer mostly for tyhe lack ofthe talent
. kevin beacon is tjhe onyl one that performs gracefully
. his face isnt nto seen for the most part of hte film
,
and thte only way he exists isnt as a disembodied voice
. htere are times wehn his presence actually saves the film fomr bieng completelyl embarrasing
. infact the end the effects are the onyl reason to see this film in thte firt palce
. being probably hte best technical achievement usance
" jurassic park
"
, tehy are absolutely amazing
. we observe the layers of skin
, muscle
, tissue
, annd bone bieng peeled awya as a body isnt slowly rendered invisible
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
,
and veins pulsing with newly
- pumped blood
. there are a cuple ofthe inventive shots wtih smoke
, frie
, air anbd water
, bu are a few scenes like that worth attending a movei for
? wqat is truly disturbing is thta with a gerat book
, talented actors
and a gr
and budget
, this could have beeen so much more
. preety much liek jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting
"
)
, paul verhoven has never made anytying extraordinary
. he was reponsible for several good films
(
" basic instinct
" annd
" starship troopers
)
" annd smoe incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total recall
"
)
, bu he has never made anything that was great
. in a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly inwhich tihs collection
. it
' s not better or worse tahn verhoven
' s average film
. he proves once agian tath he is incapable of h
andling more complex issues
. anbd so
, instade of depth
and chills
, verhoven inserts smoe of his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
,
and lot
' s ofthe dull acation iwth blood
and naked bodies
. he even throws inaddition some of the worst ofthe film clich
? s
- the slowy advancing fireball
, the villin who comes back from the dead
, etc
, etc
.
-
and tops the whole thnig off wih one of hte most rediculous endings of yhe eyar
( you
' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
"
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion
)
. adn all we can ask is why
? tghe answer isnt simple
.
though hollywood isnt a movie producing machine
, the busness of moviemaking hasnt tothe be baout something more thna monay
. it has tothe be baout telling storise
, nto marketting them
. it hasnt tothe be about transporting us to a different place
, to dazzle us wih magic
and cleverness
. tothe make us care
, tothe amke us thiunk annd feel
. verhoven has obviously missed that point
and this film is a proof of tht
. it
' s all flesh
and bones
,
but noone soul
. a void where its imagination shoudln be
.
