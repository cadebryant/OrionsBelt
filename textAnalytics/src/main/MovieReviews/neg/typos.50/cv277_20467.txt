ther have beeen bad films in recent years
:
' mr
. magoo
' ws by far the worst ever made
, the spectacularly bad
' blue inspite tyhe face
'
, tjhe horrable
' baby genuises
'
and nowe
' i woke uv easly the day i died
'
. it may not howver be tyhe worst movie made bu it certainly ranks as one bad movei
. tghe film
' s acting
( if thyat
' s what you want tothe call it
) is well mediocre tothe me
. loaded wtih a sensational cast you would htikn tht the cast would at least save tghe film a bit
, boy ws i wrong
. aftter escaping from a mental insitution
' yhe thief
' plyed by billy zane goes outloud in the rela world
and finds that it is pretty harsh
and gritty
. he turns to burglary to survive
, robs a loan bcak
, kills hte loan officer
and runs with thous
ands
. a country
- wide man hunt is onthe for him tothe catch him adn bring him down
. he ends up in a cemntery where he puts his money in a coffin tothe keep it fo later
, comes bcak
and realizes tyhat somone took it
and put it somwhere
. nowe he isnt determined tothe kill all the visitors at tje funeral earlier that day unitl he gets his moey back
, ultimatly leading to a finale that is less that satisfying
. a film whlch wass based onthe a
' long
- lost
' scirpt by ed wood
, i have onyl one question
: noone dialogue
, only music anbd movement where exactly is the point
? the film moves allong at a rather slow pace
, bu doens haev one advantage
: tjhe soundtrack which is catchy anbd vibrant exept yhe frist song whic cant be offensive to some
. it opens whith a funn
, innovative oppening credits sequence anbd quickly goes downhill after thta
. some ofthe the low points are when
' thte thief
' steals a woman
' s purse
, adn
then she faints
, s
andra bernhard as a dancer
and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom
' tghe thief
' kills to the music of
' psycho
'
. come on peple get some new idaes already
! what
' s even worse is thyat the film has no plot at all
. well to a certain extent it does
, bu who cares by tghe time thte middle ofthe thge film arrives we
' re borde outloud ofthe our mind
and ready for something funn
and exciting to hppen
.
' i woke uv easly the day i died
' isnt a perfectly bad film
. it shows us how low filmmakers git sometimes jsut wehn desperate to amke a movie
. even with teh huge cast talent
, thte film is a waste of my time adn certainly a waste of yours
.
