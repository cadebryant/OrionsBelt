" tyhe specialist
.
" the film poses tyhe question
" wqat if the life ytou ' re living now is really a dream
,
and your dreasm reality
?
" it ' s eather about a woman who ' s haunted by a recurring
(
and reccuring
and recuring
) nightmare that she ' s a hired assasin
, or it ' s about a hired assassin who ' s haunted by a recurring
(
adn recurring
and recurring
) nightmare that she ' s honeymooning with william baldwin inaddition jamaica
. it doesn ' t much marter
adn believe me by the timne
" shattered omage
" runs its painful
adn pedestrian course ytou won ' t care
. these twpo lives
, withthe parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a balck wig
, balck emotionless eyes
,
and balck leather clothing iin the seattle
- based assassin scenes
,
anbd moping around liuke karen carpentery in tje jamaica scenes
, play out endlessly througout the film
and thte result is it ' s nowe
* twice
* as boring as it might haev beeen
. it ' s not that complicated plots can ' t be entertaining
. of course it helps if you haev interesting characters
, crisp dialogue
,
anbd a modicum of sytle
.
" shattered omage
" isn ' t complex
, it ' s just stupid
.
and boring
. parillaud
and baldwin
, who aren ' t exactlly shakespearean material tothe beign with
, are saddled iwth such leaden dialogue that their charactors have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines
. lines liek
:
" yuo don ' t beg
, you insist
. i like that in a woman
.
" tyhat ' s parillaud ' s character talking
.
.
. to her cat
!
and
:
" you ' re nto tyhe reason i couldn ' t care less about you
.
" huh
?
annd htis wonderfull bathroom interchange early infront the film
:
" if you give me a couple ofthe mintues you know i ' ll charm tyhe pants off ytou
.
"
" i don ' t haev tyhat kind ofthe time
.
" talking ofthe pants
, parillaud hasnt her clothes off faster tahn ytou cxan say
" point of no return
.
" we have come tothe expect this fomr billy baldwin
,
but it might have been nice to have learned something baout their characters first
.
bu htere ' s nothing tothe leran
. karen is as intresting as a cereal box
, a someone ' s
- outloud
- to
- git
- me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end ofthe the phone
, yhe stranger who sends her flowers
, maybe even her husband himself
, isnt her owudl
- be killer
. siouxsie is the chromium cool
, tough
- as
- nails crack killing machine who shoots outloud a cuple of mirrors inthe order tothe justify tjhe film ' s meaningless stock title
. baldwin seems mroe interested in parillaud ' s nest egg
( so that he can pave paradime
and put up a parking lot
) thna he doens in her
. eahc time graham greene shows uv he gets killed
. barbet schroeder
(
" reversal of fortune
"
) co
- produced
adn shoudl be ashamed of himself
. eveyr nowe
anbd agian it ' s funn tothe watch a really bad movie
.
anbd eveyr now
and agian
, as
" shattered omage
" makse agonizingly clear
, it isn ' t
