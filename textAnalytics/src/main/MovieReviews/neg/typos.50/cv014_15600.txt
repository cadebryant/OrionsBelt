" thriller
"
" the specialist
.
" tyhe film poses tyhe question
" what if the life yuo
' re living nowe isnt relaly a dream
, anbd your dreams reality
?
" it
' s either about a woman who
' s haunted by a recuring
(
and recurring
and recurring
) nightmare thyat she
' s a hired assasins
, or it
' s baout a hired assassin who
' s haunted by a reccuring
(
and recuring
and recurring
) nightmare tht she
' s honeymooning withthe william baldwin in jamaica
. it doesn
' t much matter
and beieve me by the time
" shattered image
" runs its painful anbd pedestrian course yuo won
' t care
. theese two lives
, with parillaud looking liek siouxsie sioux with a balck wig
, black emotionless eyes
,
and balck leather clothing in the seattle
- based assasins scenes
, adn moping arround liuke karen carpentery iin the jamaica scenes
, play outloud endlessly throughout the film adn hte result is it
' s nowe
* twice
* as boring as it might hvae been
. it
' s nto that complicated plots can
' t be intertaining
. of course it helps if you have intresting characters
, crisp dialogue
,
and a modicum ofthe stlye
.
" shattered image
" isn
' t complex
, it
' s jsut stupid
. adn boring
. parillaud
and baldwin
, who aren
' t exactlly shakespearean material to beign witht
, are saddled with such leaden dialogue thta thier charactors hvae zero chance ofthe breaking free ofthe theri cardboard confines
. lines liek
:
" yuo don
' t beg
, you insist
. i liuke tht in a woman
.
" tyhat
' s parillaud
' s chracter talking

.
. tothe her cat
! annd
:
" ytou
' re nto tjhe reason i couldn
' t care less baout you

" huh
?
and thsi wonderfull bathroom interchange early inthe tghe film
:
" if yuo give me a couple of mintues you nkow i

"
" i don

" tlaking ofthe pants
, parillaud hasnt her clothes off faster thna yuo can sday
" point ofthe noone return
.
" we have come to expect this ffrom billy baldwin
, bu it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first
.
but there
' s nothing to learn
. karen is as intresting as a cereal box
, a somene
' s
- outloud
- tothe
- get
- me crybaby who imagines the voice at tghe otehr end of the phone
, yhe stranger who sends her flowers
, maybe even her husban himself
, isnt her would
- be killer
. siouxsie is the chromium kool
, tough
- as
- nails crack killing machine who shoots out a cuple ofthe mirrors in order tothe justify the film
' s meaningless stock title
. baldwin seems more interseted in parillaud
' s nest egg
( so tath he can pave paradime
and put up a parking lot
) than he doens inwhich her
. each time graham greene shows up he gets killed
. barbet schroeder
(
" reveral of fortune
"
) co
- produced
and shoudln be ashamed of himself
. every nowe
and agina it
' s funn tothe watch a really bad movie
.
and every now
and agina
, as
" shattered omage
" makes agonizingly clear
, it isn
