conventional wisdom amoung collectibles retailers isnt thyat childen
' s items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty
- five or thirty years affter the item was made
. tath
' s whn the kids of that time have jobs
, disposable income annd a desire to re
- ivsit the awe
and wonderment ofthe childhood that has dissapeared ffrom thier lives
. check out tyhe prices of toys from yhe lite sixties
and ytou
' ll fidn tht yogi bear lunch boxes are dem
anding big bucks
. ther
' s a heavy nestolgia nowadays fo hte lite sixties annd eearly seventies
and nowhere is it omre aparent than on the big screen
. boomers are nowe mostly in their forties
and fifties
and have lieved inthe the wokr
- a
- day world forthe a long time
. tehy
' d liuke tothe re
- capture soem of that funn they remeber ffrom dyas ofthe yore
. hollywood seems mroe thna eeger to churn out product to help them
. directors are zealous tothe put their stamp onthe icons ffrom tyhat tyme
.
and for thte most part they
' re messing it uv
.
" mission impossible
"
,
" lost in space
"
,
" godzilla
"
,
" zorro
"
. none of these succesfuly capture the originals
. none of theese are even ogod films
. ytou can now add
" the avengers
" tothe the list
. thte brittish television serieses began in 1961
. super secret agent john steed
( thn
- patrick macnee
)
and his thrid partner
, emma peel
(
then
- diana rigg
) are teh pair that thte american audience fell fo
. surrealistic
and witty
, the series fit the mood ofthe the times
. the leather
- cladded rigg probably didn
' t hurt the ratings eather
. after all it
' s not a coinsidence tht ytou can
' t pronounce her character
' s nmae wihtout
" appeal
"
. nowe we
' re inaddition yhe nineties
. steed
( nowe
- ralph fiennes
) adn peel
( nowe
- uma thurman
) are battling evil genius sir agust de wynter
( sean connery
) who is screwing iwth engl
and
' s weaher
. that
' s baout as much of a plot as we have
. there
' s soem footage baout a lot ofthe other things that either don
' t make sence or mkea even less sence
. we git betrayal forthe some unknown reason
. evil clones appear annd vanish anbd haev no connection tothe tghe film
. remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps wiht machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no ogod reason
. ther
' s a high tech hot air balloon
, bu i hvea noone idea why anyone
' s iin it
. tyhe spy agency isnt run by a man called
" mother
" who is infact a wheelchair adn a woman named
" father
" who is blind
.
.
. at least inwhich some scenes
. ther
' s probably a reason for all of tihs
,
but we
' ll never know it
. macnee makes an apprearance ofthe sorts
. he is the voice forthe an invisible man whose charachter goes nowhere in a scene tht does nothing
. a gropu of villains sist arund a tabel
, all claded in huge pastel
- colored teddy bear outfits
. at first it
' s humurous tothe watch the teddies waddle around
,
but hten it becomes goofy
. tyhe movei isnt a medley of clutter
, confusion anbd wrong decisions arund eveyr corner
. it fiels like major portions of tjhe film are missing
. the storyline jumps rather thna flows
. reportadly hte film ws re
- cut several times
. this is oen ofthe those times where the wohle isnt less tahn the sum ofthe tyhe parts expecially sicne some ofthe the parts apear tothe be missing
. there
' s one good point where peel is runing from one room tothe anohter in a house dessigned by escher
. otehr than tyhat
, the effects are second
- rate
. the weather threath is ood hat as are tghe scenes ofthe huge tornadoes
. thurman almsot makes an adequte emma peel bu it doesn
' t work
. she looks good
, dresses in all thte right fetish outfits
but htere
' s no spark
. fiennes fares even less well
. macnee
' s steed wass a witty man ofthe the world with a sense of humor
. fiennes
' agent comes across as a dour kid infront grown
- uv clothes who hasnt never beeen out ofthe his home twon
. even connery
, one of the greatest living actors
, doesn
' t have much ofthe a presense outside of a fewd fieyr scenes
. tje action scenes are difficult to follow
. director jeremiah chechik
( reponsible forthe the atrocious remake of
" diabolique
"
) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn
' t be
. thnigs appen
, peple move around
,
but even if
, with hte utmost efford
, you were able to care baout any ofthe it
, the scenes are bewildering
. the primary allure ofthe the origonal was the interaction beetwen the twpo leads
. witty banter
and an underplayed sexual tension weere a winning combination
. admitedly there are a few humurous sexual puns in tghe film
,
but ther
' s noone chemestry
and thge repartee is anytying bu clever
. one ofthe emma peel
' s firt lines ofthe dialog is
" rules are made tothe be broken
.
" it doesn
' t get any better
. advance word alone shouldnt have beeen anough tothe scare off anyone
. tjhe realease date was changed severeal times
. connery refuses tothe promote the film
. there was no screening fo criticists which may have been a ogod choice forthe warner brothers
. at least this way
, they get something of an audience forthe the first weekend befor teh news gets outloud
. admittedly i haven
' t seen an epiode ofthe yhe television series forthe a couple ofthe decades
. my guess is that it would be severly dated nowe
. no marter how antiquated it might be
, there
' s no doubt taht it holds up better than htis film isnt at frist viewing
. there
' s noone reason to waste any part of yhe lsat few dyas ofthe summer inside watching htis movei
. no reason at all
.
