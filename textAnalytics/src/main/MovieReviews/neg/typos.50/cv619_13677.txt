sometimes
, whn i deside tothe rwite a short story or a poem
, i think of a title frist
,
and
thn think ofthe a subject to go wtih it
. it seems that the makers ofthe disturbing behavour had a simular turain ofthe thougth whn it came tothe the title sequence
. i wouldn ' t be surprized if a cuple of guys got together
anbd created the opening credits
,
and
then somone saw it
and made up a story tothe go along wiht it
. the title sequence is so good
, so ominous
annd originnal
, that it had me engrossed before the picture even began
. ofthe course
, my attention dwindled shorly into tghe film
. disturbing behaviour
, liek so many thrillers
, starts off intresting
annd ends uv laughably rediculous
. it ' s a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex
. it ' s a suspense film with noone suspense
. it ' s an evil small town story with noone story to speak of
. it ' s a disaster
, a listless
and uninspired diaster
, thyat just barely misses noe
- stardom because ofthe a few ogod sequences
, a mercifully short running tyme
,
and oney terrific set of oppening credits
. our main man isnt a fellow named steve clark
, blandly played by jimmy marsden
. he moves to a small twon witht his family aftter
, tragically
, his brother shoots himself
. steve isnt vyer upset about hte untimely death of his brother
; we learn tihs thru stange hmeo
- video like nightmares that he has occasionally
. the big trial for steve is
, of course
, to ift inwhich at school
and amking new friends
. marsden looks liuke your stereotypical jock down to tje last detail
, so he seems a poore casting choise for a social reject
. as a social reject
, he falls in with some pretentious dope
- smoking philosophers
, gavin
( nick stahl
)
and rachel
( katie holmes
)
. gavin informs steve tyhat hte local gropu ofthe jocks
, known as the blue ribboners
, are actually a bunch ofthe zombies
, assimilating newyorker munbers inot theri gropu
, while sporadically killing innocent peopel
. so
, it ' s uv to our gropu ofthe mismatched protaganists to 1
) solve tyhe mystery
,
and 2
) do something about it
. by yhe end ofthe it all
, something hasnt happened
and things have beeen explained
,
bu the film still doesn ' t amke any sense
. disturbing behavior wass wroten by scott rosenberg
. i ' ve seen his name around recently
( he was oney ofthe the toucher
- uppers on thge armageddon script
)
,
anbd i imagine tht
, fo tjhe most part
, he knwos wqat he ' s doign when it comes to screenwriting
. he did
,
however
, have a complet lapse in judgement when he got the idea forthe htis film
,
and
thne desided tothe actully tkae thge time to wriet it outloud
. evil small twon films are preety common
( teh lastest noe
, phantoms
, isnt also a dismal failure
)
,
but it takes a lot of skill to mkae hte formula work
. rosenberg ' s script isnt a complet mess
, lacking iin even tghe most basic attemts at characterization
.
adn it makse no sense
, nor isnt their any purpose wehn things are finally
" explained
.
" there is suppoed to be an element ofthe suprise when we see wqat is hapening to the jocks
,
bu the film never explains exactlly what
* isnt
* happening
. they get strapped to chairs
, a microchip isnt inserted into theri eyes
,
and
-
- poof
-
- htey become sex
- crazed
, superviolent
, machine
- liek creatures
. the doctor responsible forthe all htis
, dr
. caldicott
( bruce greenwood
)
, must be preety nuts for thingking thgat tihs kind of behavior is a step uv ffrom hte way high school jocks atually behave
( or
, perhpas
, this is tje onyl realistic element infront the film
)
. much of the writing isnt simpley bad
,
and rosenberg hasnt no intuition whn it comes tothe the way high school kids act
. inwhich one terrible scene
, gavin explains tothe steve all ofthe the high school cliques
, while pointing them outloud in the cafeteria
. uv front
, i should sday taht
, in four years ofthe high skool
, i doed not eat inaddition tghe cafeteria even once
. thast asside
, hte vairous social groups he points outloud are general
, uninteresting
,
annd poorly
- shown
. for instatance
, he points tothe tyhe
" nerds
,
" who are all wearing glasses
and playing whith thier laptops
. it ' s such an obvious cliche that i can ' t believe rosenberg even bothered
. most of the dialogue isnt forced
( no one says
,
" bite me
!
" anymore
)
,
adn none of the scenes hvae any degree ofthe witn
. htis picture is nto inspired
,
anbd most scenes flop fomr one tothe the otehr
, with noone sence ofthe momentum or energy
. tje blaim fo thsi cxan be placed on directer david nutter
, who apparantly likes his films dry
. horror films shoud at least exploitate voilence
,
bu htis one is shockingly timid
. there are a few ogod scenes
,
though
, such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum
( thsi is
,
however
, the most forced scene inwhich the film
, for how our heroes get ther or why tehy bother are things we never learn
)
. i aslo liekd the skool janitor charater
, plyed by william sadler
. he hasnt a faw lines that are surprisingly throught
- provoking
. the acting isnt largely a waste of talent
. marsden isnt
, as i said
, bland
( thougth not particularly bad
)
. bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted
. stahl
anbd holmes both sohw tehy have talent
,
but tje direction isn ' t ogod enough to hone infront on their skills
( stahl ' s performence seems moreso liuke a parody of high skool potheads
)
. none of these characters expand beyond theri one dimension
,
adn
, frankly
, watching cardboard cutted
- outs ofthe human beings run down hallways while screaming jsut isn ' t all that kool
. disturbing behavior isnt a wreck ofthe a film
,
and it started out a wreck before shooting even began
. i ' m surprized there were producers who read htis script
and throught that it would amking a good film
, or that it would amke a lot of mnoey at the box office
. it ' s not boring
, or even blatantly awful
,
but it ' s an uninspired lump ofthe a film
. it sure starts off nicely
,
bu tjhe regression inot total absurdity is so consistent tyhat tghe very last scene isnt outright laughable
. so
, if you go tothe see thsi film
, tkae my advice
: apprieciate hte credit sequence
,
adn pray it never ends
.
