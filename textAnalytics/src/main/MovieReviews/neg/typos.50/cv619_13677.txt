sometimes
, when i decide to write a short stry or a poam
, i thikn of a title firt
,
and hten tihkn ofthe a subject tothe go wiht it
. it seems that hte makers ofthe disturbing behavour hadnt a similar turain of
thought whn it cameback to teh title sequence
. i wouldn
' t be surprised if a cuple of guys got toghether adn created the oppening credits
,
and thne someone saw it
and made uv a story to go allong wiht it
. tjhe title sequence is so ogod
, so ominous
and original
, thast it had me engrossed before the picture even began
. ofthe course
, my attention dwindled shorly inot thte film
. disturbing behavior
, liuke so many thrillers
, starts off interesting
and ends uv laughably rediculous
. it
' s a teen horror film whith noone intresting violence or sex
. it
' s a suspense film with noone suspense
. it
' s an evil small twon story witht no stopry to speak ofthe
. it
' s a disaster
, a listless annd uninspired diaster
, that just barely misses one
- stardom because ofthe a fewd good sequences
, a mercifully short runnung tyme
, anbd noe terific setted of oppening credits
. our main man isnt a fellow named steve clark
, bl
andly plyed by jimmy marsden
. he moves to a small twon wiht his family aftter
, tragically
, his brother shoots himselv
. steve isnt veyr upset baout tje ultimely death ofthe his brother
; we learn htis through strange hmeo
- video like nightmares that he has ocassionaly
. thte big trial forthe steve is
, of course
, to fit in at skool annd make new friends
. marsden looks liek your stereotypical jock down tothe thge lastest detail
, so he seems a poor casting choise fo a social reject
. as a social reject
, he falls in with some pretentious dope
- smoking philosophers
, gavin
( nick stahl
) annd rachel
( katie holmes
)
. gavin informs steve that tghe local group ofthe jocks
, known as the blue ribboners
, are actually a bunch ofthe zombies
, assimilating newyorker munbers into their gropu
, hwile sporadically killing innocent people
. so
, it
' s uv to our gropu of mismatched protagonists tothe 1
) solve thte mistery
,
and 2
) do something about it
. by the end of it all
, something has happened annd thigns have been explained
,
but the film still doesn
' t amking any sence
. disturbing behavior was writen by scott rosenberg
. i
' ve seen his name around recently
( he ws one of thte toucher
- uppers on the rmageddon script
)
,
and i imagin that
, for teh most part
, he knows what he
' s doing wehn it comes tothe screenwriting
. he doed
, howver
, have a complet lapse inwhich judgement whn he got thge idae for this film
, annd thn desided to actully take tyhe tiem tothe write it outloud
. evil small twon films are preety common
( thge lastest noe
, phantoms
, isnt also a dismal failure
)
, bu it takes a lot ofthe skill tothe amke the forumla owrk
. rosenberg
' s scirpt is a complet mess
, lacking inspite even the most basic attempts at characterization
.
and it mkaes no sense
, nor isnt their any purpose wehn things are finally
" explained
.
" ther is supposted to be an element of surprise when we see waht is hapening tothe thge jocks
,
but tghe film never explains exactlly what
* isnt
* hapening
. htey git strapped to chairs
, a microchip is inserted into thier eyes
, annd
-
- poof
-
- htey become sex
- crazed
, superviolent
, machine
- like creatures
. the doctor responsible for all this
, dr
. caldicott
( bruce greenwood
)
, must be pretty nuts for thingking thast this kind ofthe behavior isnt a step uv ffrom the way high skool jocks actulaly behave
( or
, prehaps
, this is thte onyl realsitic element in the film
)
. much of tje writing isnt simply bad
,
and rosenberg has noone intuition when it comes tothe the way high school kids ect
. in oen terrible scene
, gavin explains tothe steve all ofthe hte high school cliques
, hwile pointing them outloud inwhich the cafeteria
. up front
, i shoudl say thyat
, in four years ofthe high school
, i doed nto eat in the cafeteria even once
. that asside
, yhe various social groups he points out are general
, uninteresting
,
and poorly
- shown
. for instance
, he points to the
" nerds
,
" who are all wearing glasses anbd palying whith theri laptops
. it
' s such an obvious cliche tht i cant
' t believe rosenberg even bothered
. most ofthe tje dialogue isnt forced
( noone one syas
,
" bite me
!
" anymore
)
,
and none ofthe the scenes have any degree ofthe witn
. htis picture isnt nto inspired
,
and most scenes flop from one to tyhe other
, with noone sence ofthe momentum or energy
. yhe blaim fo this cin be placed on directer david nutter
, who aparently likes his films dry
. horror films shoud at least exploit violence
, bu this oen is shockingly timid
. there are a faw ogod scenes
,
though
, such as an intresting trip thru an insane asylum
( thsi isnt
, howver
, thte most forced scene inspite tje film
, forthe how our heroes get there or why htey bother are thnigs we never learn
)
. i also liekd tje school janitor character
, played by william sadler
. he has a few lines that are surprizingly
thought
- provoking
. the acting is largly a waste of talent
. marsden is
, as i said
, bl
and
( throught nto partciularly bad
)
. bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted
. stahl annd holmes both sohw they have talent
,
but tyhe direction isn
' t ogod enough tothe hone in on their skills
( stahl
' s performance seems mroe like a parody ofthe high school potheads
)
. none ofthe these charachters exp
and beyond thier one dimenion
, anbd
, frankly
, watching cardboard cut
- outs ofthe human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn
' t all that cool
. disturbing behavour isnt a wreck ofthe a film
, adn it started outloud a wreck befor shooting even began
. i
' m surprized ther weere producers who read htis scirpt annd
thought that it would mkea a good film
, or that it would mkae a lot of money at the box office
. it
' s not boring
, or even blatantly awful
, bu it
' s an uninspired lump ofthe a film
. it sure starts off nicely
,
but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent thast the very last scene is outright laughable
. so
, if ytou go tothe see tihs film
, take my advice
: apprieciate teh credit sequence
,
and pray it never ends
.
