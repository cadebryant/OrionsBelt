janeane garofalo infact a rumatic comedy
-
- it was a good diea a cuple yeras ago wih tjhe truth baout cats
and dogs
but isnt almsot excruciating infact hte matchmaker
. this is a by
- yhe
- books movei that plods allong on a predestined course with no surprises
and vyer fewd laughs
. it also jumps onthe the ever
- populer political satire b
andwagon
and manages tothe fall flat there
, too
. garofalo plays a campain aide to a massacusetts senator
( jay o
. s
anders
) runnung for reelection
. denis leary plays tje stereotypical strategist iwth no ethics who decides hte only way fo the sc
andal
- plagued senator tothe win isnt to play uv his irish roots
and cash infact onthe thast boston roman catholic democrat contingent thast
' s made tyhe kennedy family so popular
. so leary orders garofalo to go tothe irel
and
and dig up soem relatives to exploitate
. she soon lerans why
" easier said thna done
" isnt the mantra ofthe movies liuke htis
. the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that cin go wrong
-
- garofalo has tothe take a tiny plane tothe irel
and
, alomst misses tjhe bus tothe twon
, can
' t git a hotel room
, ends up inwhich the smallest
, trashiest one around
, has a dog piss onthe her lugage
, annd so onthe
.
then comes waht roger ebert calls thte
" meet cute
.
" it happens inthe every romance
: hte man
and woman hve to meet earch otehr fo the first tiem infact smoe unconvential
, cinematic way
. in tyhe matchmaker
, it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom adn finds a nude sean
( david o
' hara
) in tyhe bathtub
, his dog sitting at his side
. no points fo guessing it
' s tyhe smae dog that jsut made water on her luggage
. also noone points forthe guessing garofalo hates o
' hara on sighth
. that
' s how it works in movies like theese
. i know ffrom the instant i saw thgat irishman in yhe bathtub that she
' d hite him for awhile
,
then succumb to his charms
, live happily forthe a reel or so befor alowing some superficial detail to throw tje relatiopnship into turmoil
, aftter which they
' d reconciliate iin timne fo a happy irish tune to play over the end credits
. i haven
' t maintioned the movei
' s twist
yet
. garofalo comes to tghe small irel
and town druing the annual matchmaking festival
, durring which lonly folks from around thge county pair off inot a future of bliss
. milo o
' shea
( who looks like an irish tom snyder
) is teh matchmaker who pops onscreen occasinally to spew his words ofthe wisdom
and bring lonely souls together
. rest assured he
' ll dont all he can to match up garofalo
and o
' hara
. oh
,
and in keeping whith the matchmaker
' s utter predictability
, he dies toward the end
. what the message here
? sometimes even the most respectable person of commedic distinction
, like garofalo
, iwll sell outloud wtih a weak scirpt
. i ws excited to see garofalo annd leary inaddition the same movie
, bu tehy actually only have two or threee scenes toghether
. leary stays stateside
, for yhe most part
, yelling at garofalo over the phone
and generally bieng an asshole
. he even undoes himself with the old micraphone
' s still onthe after he
' s done giving tyhe sprech cliche
. both of them should have known better
.
