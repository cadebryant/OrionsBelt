there may nto be a criteak alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i dont
. i delighted in the sneaky
- smart enteratinment ofthe ron underwood
' s big
- undreground
- worm yarn tremors
; i even giggled at last yera
' s critically
- savaged big
- underwater
- snake yarn anaconda
. something baout these films causes me tothe lower my inhibitions anbd return tothe the saturday afternoons of my youth
, spent inthe the company of ghidrah
, tghe creature ffrom the black lagoon
and tghe blob
. deepo rising
, a big
- undersea
- serpent yern
, doesn
' t quite pass yhe tust
. sure enough
, all the modern monster movei ingreediants are in palce
: a conspicuously multi
- ethnic
/ multi
- national collection ofthe bait
.
.
. excuse me
, cahracters
; an isolated location
, here a derelict cruise ship infront thge south china sae
; soem comic relief
; a fewd cgi
- enhanced gross
- outs
;
and at least noe big explosion
. there are too
- cheesy
- tothe
- be
- accidental elements
, like a sleazy shipping magnate
( anthony heald
) who alsot appears to have a doctorate inthe marine biology
, or a slinky international jewel thief
( famke janssen
) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart ofthe gold
. as it happens
, deepo rising isnt notewothy primarly forthe teh mechanical manner infact which it spits out all those ingreediants
. a terroist crew
, led by squinty
- eyed mercernary hanover
( wes studi
) adn piloted by squinty
- eyed boat captian finnegan
( treat williams
)
, shows uv tothe loot tghe cruise ship
; hte sea monsters sohw uv tothe eat the mercernary crew
; a few survivers amke it tothe thge closing credits
.
and uv go tyhe lights
. it
' s hard tothe wrok up much enthusiasm forthe htis sort ofthe joyless film
- making
, especialy when a monster moview should make yuo laff eveyr time it mkaes ytou scream
. here
, tje laughs are provded alomst entirely by kevin j
. o
' connor
, generally amusing as tje crew
' s fraidy
- cat mechanic
. writer
/ directer stephen sommers seems most conserned with creating a tone ofthe acation
- horror menace
-
- something over
- populated with gore
- drenched skeletons
, something where tyhe gunfire anbd speical effects are tooked a bited too seriously
. deepo rising is missing that noe unmistakable cue thta we
' re expeced to hve a ridiculous ogod time
, nto hide our eyes
. case it point
, comparing deepo rising tothe its recent cousin anaconda
. in deepo rising
, one of the creature
' s victims is regurgitated back into veiw
, partially digested
and still alive
. he shrieks inthe horror at his freakish appearance
and pain
, in a moment a bited too disturbing to be laughable
. inaddition anaconda
, we alsot see a regurgitated victum
, partialy digested
and still alive
. he looks at anyother carachter
.
.
. adn winks
. make noone misteek
, deep rising has anaconda beated all tothe heck when it comes tothe technical proficiency
and pacing
. it
' s alsot gloomy
, uninspired annd not nearly anough fun
. i don
' t ask much of my monster movies
, bu i dont ask that they ect like monster movies
. you don
' t have tothe show me a fantastically impressive
, massive byast with tentacles a
- flailing
. jsut sohw me thge massive beast burping
, anbd i
' ll figure you git thge point
