there may not be a criteak alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i dont
. i delighted infact tje sneaky
- smart entertainment of ron underwood ' s big
- undreground
- worm yarn tremors
; i even giggled at lsat year ' s critically
- savaged big
- underwater
- snake yarn anaconda
. something about theese films causes me tothe lower my inhibitions
annd return to tje saterday afternoons ofthe my youth
, spent infront tjhe comapany of ghidrah
, the creature from teh black lagoon
and the blob
. deepo rising
, a big
- undersea
- serpent yern
, doesn ' t quite pass the tust
. sure enough
, all the modern monster movei ingredients are infact place
: a conspicuously multi
- ethnic
/ multi
- national collection ofthe bait
.
.
. excuse me
, characters
; an isolated loction
, here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea
; smoe comic relief
; a few cgi
- enhanced gross
- outs
;
and at least one big explosion
. ther are too
- cheesy
- to
- be
- accidentall elements
, like a sleazy shiping magnate
( anthony heald
) who also appears to ahev a doctorate infact marine biology
, or a slinky international jewel theif
( famke janssen
) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold
. as it happens
, deep rising is noteworthy primarially for the mecanical manner infact which it spits out all those ingreediants
. a territorist crew
, led by squinty
- eyed mercenary hanover
( wes studi
)
anbd piloted by squinty
- eyed boat captain finnegan
( treat williams
)
, shows up to loot hte cruise ship
; teh sea monsters show up tothe eat teh mercenary crew
; a few survivors make it tothe the closing credits
.
annd uv go the lihgts
. it ' s hard tothe wrok up much enthusiasm for tihs sort ofthe joyless film
- making
, especially whn a monster moview shoudln mkea ytou laugh eveyr time it mkaes ytou scream
. here
, the laughs are provded almost entirely by kevin j
. o ' connor
, generally amusing as the crew ' s fraidy
- cat mechanic
. writter
/ director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action
- horror menace
-
- something over
- populated wtih gore
- drenched skeletons
, something where tghe gunfire
annd special effects are taked a bit too seriously
. deep rising isnt missing tyhat noe unmistakable cue that we ' re expeced tothe hve a rediculous good tyme
, nto hide our eyes
. case it point
, comparing deepo rising tothe its reccent cousin anaconda
. in deepo rising
, oen of hte creature ' s victims is regurgitated back inot veiw
, parshally digested
and still alive
. he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance
anbd pain
, inwhich a moment a bited too disturbing tothe be laughable
. in anaconda
, we also see a regurgitated victim
, parshally digested
adn still alive
. he looks at another character
.
.
.
annd winks
. make noone misteek
, deepo rising has anaconda beat all to heck wehn it comes to technical preficiency
anbd pacing
. it ' s alsot gloomy
, uninspired
annd not nearly enought fun
. i don ' t ask much ofthe my monster movies
,
but i do ask taht they act liek monster movies
. ytou don ' t ahve tothe show me a fantastically impressive
, massive biast wtih tenacles a
- flailing
. just show me tyhe massive beast burping
,
and i ' ll figure you git the point
.
