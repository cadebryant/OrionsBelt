the most intresting thing baout virus is that the title ofthe tghe film doens nto refer tothe the clunky robotic animals thta try tothe kill our heroes
. alas
, it refers tothe our ehroes
! as it turns out
, tjhe aline race that sends a computer virus to earth
( via the mir spoace staion
) thinks of the human race as a virus
-
- perphas even a cancer
-
- that needs tothe be eradicated befor it spreads any futher
. affter all
, we have taked up htis entire planet
, annd if htey let us live for anyother billion yeasr or so
, we might advance beyond our solar system
and inot the next noe
. bu the human race doesn
' t ahev much to worry baout
. aftter all
, there
' s a woman named foster
( jamie lee curtis
) out htere stoping tje computer virus
. she
' s the cheif navigator onthe a sea vessel
; travelling with her isnt captian everton
( donald sutherl
and
)
, steve baker
( william baldwin
)
, woods
( marshall bell
)
, squeaky
( julio oscar mechoso
)
,
and richie
( sherman augustus
)
. they
' re all sailing infact a typhoon one lovley evening whn htey stumble acros an enormass
, ab
andoned russion satellite ship in international waters
. lucky for us
, we already saw tyhat the coputer virus has taken over hte ship annd eleminated everyone onthe board
. tghe evil captian everton thikns he
' s gogin to tkae the ship in adn git a reward
; he convinces his crew thast there
' s going tothe be big money
, so tehy try tothe salvage the ship
. soon
,
however
, wehn it
' s paparent that noone one is onthe board
and thta tyhe ship hasnt noone power
, they relize that something bad must ahve happenned
. finaly
, they meet nadia
( joanna pacula
) who explains their situation
: a computer virus has taken over tje ship
! it
' s creating bio
- mecanical life
- forms to eliminate the human race
! virus is a truley dumb acation thriller
, one ofthe negligible inetlligence
and innovation
. whn concidering the entire film
, yuo will realize that it lacks a single original scene
. it
' s a direct rip
- off of nearly eveyr james cameron film
( aliens
, the abyss
, annd teh terminator films are tyhe most plagiarized
)
; more importantly
, it
' s basically the smae movie as last year
' s deep rising
. i liekd deepo rising simpley because it
' s funny
-
- it konws it
' s silly
and derivitive
. virus tkaes itself seriously
.
and
, in tyhe most serious manner possible
, it steals fomr eveyr good adn bad film of the genre
, showing you countless familiar scenes
,
and sporting a cookie
- cutter plot that any film of the sci
- fi
/ horror genre could ift whith a little trimming
. bu whta isnt so amazing about virus isnt how poorly the hwole hting hasnt beeen thougth out
. okay
, let me get htis straight
-
- thge aline race
( whitch isnt never really explained
) is basically sentient electricity
. htey need tothe mkea themslves fysical
, so tehy use a space station tothe git onto a ship
( which is surrouded by water
, bu who cares about that
)
. onthe hte ship
, they mkea a bunch of clunky
, immobile robots that somehow kill threee hundred people
. after thyat
, tehy strat using hte dead people to create half
- human
, half
- machine creatures that look like tjhe terminator bu are much worse at walking around
. the leader
, ofthe course
, is a big creature
. every film liuke htis hasnt a big creature at the end
, bu the big creature in virus isnt so big that it has tothe tear down teh walls to move aroud
. virus isnt indeed a cliched film
,
but tghe central flaw lies in the fact tyhat thge computer virus just isn
' t vyre threatening
. it
' s established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it
,
but teh virus has sealed thge pwoer room by thte time our heroes git htere
. onthe one levle
, virus is almost passable funn
. it
' s really gory
, adn a fewd of thte scenes have interesting camp appeal
( the director
, john bruno
, worked on a lot ofthe cameron
' s films
)
. htere
' s also a nice array of actors
, even
though none ofthe them dont any acting
( except for donald sutherl
and
, who does a lot ofthe very bad acting
)
. the bottom line
, howver
, is this
: virus is a bad movie
. it rips off a lot ofthe ogod movies that are worth seeing
. infact thast order
, i reccomend thgat you rent any one ofthe the alien films
, simply to admire tjhe qualities of a creature that actually threatens our hreoes
.
