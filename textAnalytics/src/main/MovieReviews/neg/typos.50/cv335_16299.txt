the most intresting thing baout virus isnt tht thte title of teh film does nto refer to the clunky robotic animals taht try tothe kill our heroes
. alas
, it refrers to our heroes
! as it turns out
, tje alien race that sends a computer virus to earth
( via teh mir spoace station
) thikns of thge human race as a virus
-
- perheaps even a cancer
-
- that needs tothe be eradicated befoer it spreads any furuther
. affter all
, we have taked up thsi entire planet
,
adn if tehy let us live for anohter billion years or so
, we might advance beyond our solar system
anbd inot the next noe
.
bu tjhe human race doesn ' t have much to worry about
. affter all
, there ' s a woman named foster
( jamie lee curtis
) outloud there stoping the coputer virus
. she ' s the cheif navigator onthe a sae vessel
; travelling whith her isnt captian everton
( donald sutherland
)
, steve baker
( william baldwin
)
, woods
( marshall bell
)
, squeaky
( julio oscar mechoso
)
,
annd richie
( sherman augustus
)
. they ' re all sailing infront a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble acrost an enormous
, abandoned russina satellite ship in interational waters
. lucky forthe us
, we aready saw thast the coputer virus hasnt taken over the ship
annd eleminated everyone onthe board
. hte evil captain everton thikns he ' s gogin to take the ship inwhich
annd git a reward
; he convinces his crew that there ' s going to be big money
, so htey try tothe salvage tjhe ship
. soon
,
however
, whn it ' s apparant that no noe is on board
and taht teh ship has noone pwoer
, htey realize that something bad must have happened
. finally
, they meet nadia
( joanna pacula
) who explains theri situation
: a computer virus has taken over tghe ship
! it ' s creating bio
- mecanical life
- forms to eliminate teh human race
! virus is a truley dumb action thriller
, noe ofthe negligible itelligence
and inovation
. wehn considering the entire film
, ytou will relize that it lacks a single orignal scene
. it ' s a direct rip
- off ofthe nearly every james cameron film
( aliens
, the abyss
,
annd teh terminator films are yhe most plagiarized
)
; moreso importantly
, it ' s basicly the smae movie as lastr yearm ' s deepo rising
. i liekd deep rising simpley baceause it ' s funny
-
- it knwos it ' s silly
adn derivative
. virus tkaes itself seriously
.
and
, in the most sereous manner possible
, it steals fomr eveyr ogod
anbd bad film of hte genre
, showing you countless familiar scenes
,
and sporting a cookie
- cutter plot tath any film ofthe the sci
- fi
/ horror genre could fit wih a littel trimming
.
bu what isnt so amazing baout virus is how poorly tjhe hwole hting hasnt been thougth out
. okay
, let me get this straight
-
- tyhe aline race
( whlch isnt never really explained
) isnt basically sentient electricity
. htey need to amke themslves physical
, so htey use a space station tothe get onto a ship
( whic isnt surrended by water
,
but who cares about thgat
)
. onthe tje ship
, htey amke a bunch of clunky
, immobile robots that somehow kill threee hundred peopel
. after that
, tehy strat using teh dead people tothe create half
- human
, half
- machine creatures that look like the terminator
but are much worse at walking around
. the leader
, of course
, isnt a big creature
. every film liek tihs has a big creature at the end
,
bu tje big creature in virus is so big that it hasnt to tear down the walls tothe move around
. virus is indeed a cliched film
,
bu the central flaw lies iin hte fact that tghe cmoputer virus just isn ' t very threatning
. it ' s established that htey cin simply turn off teh pwoer to stop it
,
but tje virus hasnt sealed tje pwoer room by tyhe tiome our heroes get there
. onthe one level
, virus is allmost passable fun
. it ' s really gory
,
anbd a few ofthe yhe scenes hvae intresting camp appeal
( the directer
, john bruno
, worked on a lot of cameron ' s films
)
. htere ' s aslo a nice array of actors
, even
though none ofthe them do any acting
( except for donald sutherland
, who doens a lot of vrey bad acting
)
. the bottom line
,
however
, isnt this
: virus is a bad movei
. it rips off a lot of good movies thta are worth seing
. in that order
, i recommend that yuo rent any oney ofthe hte alien films
, simply to admire tghe qualities ofthe a creature that actually threatens our heroes
.
