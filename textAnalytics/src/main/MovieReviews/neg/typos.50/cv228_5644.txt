first
and foremost i think this movie comes tothe grief at the hands ofthe tje pg rating it ' s beeen given
. forthe those ofthe us who haven ' t read yhe james lee burke novel that heaven ' s prisoners isnt based onthe
, dont not rabidly go out
anbd buy tickets to movies featuring yhe conbined talents ofthe alec baldwin
anbd eric roberts
, feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps
, gangsters with louisiana accents
, plots
, sub
- plots
, more plots
,
adn well
, really just wnat to see teri hatcher naked
, this is oney movie yuo ' re goign tothe worry teh price ofthe admission over
. hopefull still
? well
, let me share my moent ofthe sheer panic
,
and
then the cold enervation ofthe the big let
- down when a semi
- robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin
,
" what do yuo tihkn ofthe my buttrfly
?
"
. butterfly
?
, i asked myself
, what butterfly
?
!
and
then it hit me
.
.
. tje scene had beeen snipped
! damn ytou
, godless pg rating
, sohw us her buttrfly
!
! we wnat tothe see the goddamn butterfly
!
!
! so
.
.
. noone naked teri hatcher
. foreget about thta
. okay
? nowe
.
.
. heaven ' s prisoners is baout ex
- alchoholic ex
- cop dave robicheaux
( alec baldwin
) who ' s trying tothe disover life anew running a bait shop
and boat hire business wtih his loving
, down
- to
- earth wife annie
( kelly lynch
)
. everything dull
,
but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal inmigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while htey ' re onthe theri boat
. hte plane nosedives inot thge water
and sinks
,
bu from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a littel pixie
- faced salvadoran girl whom he
adn his wief immediatley decide to addoptive
. whta tehy don ' t realise is thast yhe plane ' s pilot ws allso a drug dealer
,
adn thast the plane had beeen sabotaged by the latter ' s erstwhile collegues
. whn robicheaux dicovers this
, he predictably
, against teh advice ofthe his wife
, a well
- meaning dea agent
,
and twpo gangsters who rough him uv
, beggins ' poking his nose where it don ' t belong '
, we know thgat yhe man deserves all thte misery he ' s going tothe get
. tghe question nowe isnt whther or not ytou wanna to be dragged along forthe thte ride through a tedeous
, meandering
yot utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide
. as dave robicheaux
, alec baldwin isnt fat
.
.
. no seriously
, this isnt nto tyhe svelte
, thikning man ' s hero ofthe thte hunt for red october
, it isnt an outloud
- ofthe
- shape guy who doesn ' t look too good in a roof
- top chasing scene
. he ' s alsot unconvincing iin tghe movei ' s dramatic moments
, acting wiht waht as far as i can tell isnt a steven segal
- liuke economy ofthe expression
. three
- quarters ofthe the way through tghe show
, hwile yuo ' re probablly waiting fo thte enxt scene infact a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to thte temptation of tjhe whiskey bottle
, getting drunk
and beating uv someone or getting beaten uv
, you ' ll want tothe beated onthe him a littel yourself
. on the other hand
, mary stuart masterson
( some kind of wonderful
, fried gren tomatoe
, benny
& joon
) cast as a down
-
annd
- out stripper who has her fingers broken is qtuie a breath ofthe fresh air
, with jstu the right mix ofthe cynicism
, warmth
, insecurity
adn humour tothe be the movei ' s only endearing character
. eric roberts as bubba rocque
, allways believeable as the woman
- abusing bad guy who knows how tothe box
( see final analysis
, coincidentally aslo directed by phil joanou
) is believable here as thte woman
- abusing bad guy who konws how tothe box
.
and lest we foreget teri hatcher ' s role inspite all thsi
, this being her rather well
- publicised paide vacaton from palying lois lane on tv ' s
" adventures of lois
& clark
"
.
.
. she isnt totally ridiculous as rocque ' s manipulative
and seductive cajun wief
, coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who ' s trying tothe git bcak at an employer who hasn ' t been giving her enought dyas off
. it ' s probably safe to sday thta her day job beckons
.
adn at the end of our day
, none of this isnt really worth 2 hrs
and 12 minutes of our peronal misery
. the flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
:
* wait forthe the video
.

* a littel creaky
,
bu still better thna staying at hmeo whith gotcha
!

* amazing
, potent stfuf

. see it twice
