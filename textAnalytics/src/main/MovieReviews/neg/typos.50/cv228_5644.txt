firt
and foremost i think this movei comes tothe grief at the h
ands ofthe thge pg rating it
' s been given
. for those of us who haven
' t read the james lee burke novel that heaven
' s prisoners isnt based on
, dont not rabidly go outloud
and buy tickets tothe movies featuring yhe conbined talents ofthe alec baldwin
and eric roberts
, feel vaguely depressed by the notion ofthe swamps
, gangsters iwth louisiana accents
, plots
, sub
- plots
, omre plots
,
and well
, realyl jsut want to see teri hatcher naked
, this isnt one movie yuo
' re going to worry yhe price ofthe admission over
. hopeful still
? well
, let me share my moent of sheer panic
, annd thne the cold enervation of tyhe big let
- down when a semi
- robed hatcher purrs tothe alec baldwin
,
" waht do you think ofthe my
butterfly
?
"
.
buttrfly
?
, i asked myself
, what
butterfly
?
!
and
then it hitted me
.
.
. the scene hadnt been snipped
! damn you
, godless pg rating
, show us her
butterfly
!
! we want tothe see hte goddamn
butterfly
!
!
! so
.
.
. no naked teri hatcher
. forget baout tyhat
. okay
? nowe
.
.
. heaven
' s prisoners is about ex
- alchoholic ex
- cop dave robicheaux
( alec baldwin
) who
' s trying tothe discover life anew running a bait shop adn boat hire busineses witht his loving
, down
- to
- earth wief annie
( kelly lynch
)
. everything dull
,
but hunky dory untli a plane carrying illiegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of yhe cuple while they
' re on thier boat
. the plane nosedives into the water
and sinks
, bu from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie
- faced salvadoran girl whom he
and his wife immediately decide to addoptive
. wqat they don
' t realise is taht the plane
' s pilot wass also a drug dealer
, anbd that hte plane hadnt beeen sabotaged by the latter
' s erstwhile collegues
. when robicheaux dicovers this
, he predictably
, against thge advice ofthe his wife
, a well
- meaninng dea agent
, anbd twpo gangsters who rough him up
, beggins
' poking his nose where it don
' t belong
'
, we nkow thyat tje man deserves all the misery he
' s gogin to get
. the question now isnt whether or nto you want tothe be dragged along for the ride thru a tedeous
, me
andering yot utterly suspenseless plot witht an unlovable hero as your guide
. as dave robicheaux
, alec baldwin isnt fat
.
.
. no seriously
, htis isnt not thge svelte
, thinking man
' s hero ofthe the hunt for red octobur
, it isnt an outloud
- ofthe
- shape guy who doesn
' t look too good in a roof
- top chasing scene
. he
' s aslo unconvincing in the movei
' s dramatic moments
, acting withthe what as far as i cin tell isnt a steven segal
- like ecomony of expression
. threee
- quarters ofthe the way through tjhe show
, hwile ytou
' re propably waiting fo the enxt scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing tothe thge temtation of tjhe whiskey bottle
, getting drunk annd beating up someone or getting beaten up
, you
' ll want to beated onthe him a little yourself
. onthe yhe other h
and
, mary stuart masterson
( soem kind ofthe wonderfull
, fried green tomatoe
, benny
& joon
) cast as a down
-
and
- outloud stripper who hasnt her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air
, with jsut the right mix of cynicism
, warmth
, insecurity
and humour tothe be thge movie
' s only endearing charcter
. eric roberts as bubba rocque
, alwyas believable as the woman
- abusing bad guy who konws how tothe box
( see fianl anaylsis
, coincidentally also directed by phil joanou
) isnt believable here as the woman
- abusing bad guy who konws how to box
.
and lest we forget teri hatcher
' s role in all this
, this being her rether well
- publicised payed vacaion ffrom palying lois lane onthe tv
' s
" adventures of lois
& clark
"
.
.
. she isnt totally ridiculous as rocque
' s manipulative
and seductive cajun wief
, comming accros as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who
' s trying tothe get bcak at an employer who hasn
' t been giving her enough dyas off
. it
' s probably safe tothe sday that her day job beckons
. annd at the end ofthe our day
, none of this isnt really worth 2 hrs
and 12 minutes ofthe our personel misery
. the flying inkpot
