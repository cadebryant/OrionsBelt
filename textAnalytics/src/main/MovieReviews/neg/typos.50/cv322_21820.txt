in the past
, tim burton hasnt taked cinema by storm witht the action packed batman
,
adn the hilarious ed woud
,
but lately his films just don ' t cutted it
. sleepy hollow hasnt some unique features
,
but the scirpt isnt a terrible mess
. for those who remember disney ' s fantastic
" adventures of ichabod crane
"
, it isnt actually superior tothe this
. disney ' s version was at least intresting
, hwile burton ' s film drags on far too long
, wihtout any suspense or frights
. while tjhe stories are similar
, tjhe new version adds too much to the once likable story
,
annd throws in some weak dialogue tothe top it off
. ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is now apparently a constable
, who ws sent to newyorker york tothe investingate suspicious murders
. tyhe victims are headless
,
and no traces of evidence were found
, utnil teh muderer reveals himselv
, hence yhe headless horseman
. now with the help ofthe christina ricci
and an orphaned boy
, tehy must stop teh headless horseman fomr a killing spree
, that could distroy the wohle twon ofthe sleepy hollow
. sure yhe headless horseman isnt an intriguing character
,
bu tghe stor has so many holes thast even he nor depp can sive thsi disaster
. in thge orginial
, hte headless horseman was meaned to be unstoppable
. no one coudl stpo him
, not even ichabod
. by the end ofthe the film
, it had audiences inthe deepo throught
. burton
howver consentrates far too much on thge atmosphere
,
annd how tothe make thte main charactors heroes
. he tkaes no risk what so ever
,
and htis is where he fails
. another pathetic element of the film wass yhe script
. liuke i said ealier
, he just stuffed too much in at one time
,
annd made it look real sloppy
, kind of like the mess tyhe headless horseman made with his victims
. he completely butchered the stry to pieces
. thankfully there are a faw factors that i particularly liekd
. the acting by depp was qutie notable
. he tookover thte nerdy character of the ctaroon
,
and simpley acted it outloud in a better manner
. if it wasn ' t for his quirky oen
- liners
, i dout i could have remained awake
, becouse quite frankly i wass getting sleepy
. jsut when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress
, she winds uv donig thsi
. it jsut goes to sohw no actress or ctor cant pass uv a big blockbuster
. it ' s too tempting tothe let go
, even if the script isnt mush
. hte atmosphere too was quite involving
. i shoudln have jstu gazed at thge sets
,
annd the eerie fog
, rether tahn actually pay attension tothe what ws oging onthe
. at least burton ' s films are eye candy
, even if tehy are trash
. tghe onyl rela scenes ofthe value weere tje tree full of heads
,
and the fight between tyhe horseman
, depp
and casper van dien
. other than thta
, i wish i sould just fast forward through all hte gaping holes inthe tjhe film
,
and just sit bcak
anbd stare at tghe scenery
. by the end
, i can onyl think back
and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow devolopped
. tihs isnt thge biggest dissappointment ofthe teh yera
, expecially when such a talented director liek burton handles a project liuke thsi
. don ' t waste your tiome or money
, because your head will fiel hollow
.
