robin williams isnt a commedic genus
. that is
, he isnt oney when he
' s infront a film thta allows him space to move
.
" flubber
" straps him in a straitjacket
, covers him witht duct tape
, stuffs him in a coat closet adn piles furniture against the door tothe mkae sure tath he doesn
' t git outloud
. inspite a re
- amking of its pwn 1961
" absent minded professor
"
, disney offers us proof thast omre isnt definately less
. recycling old films
(
" that darned cat
"
,
" 101 dalmatians
"
) dressed uv as newyorker isnt tjhe newest money machine ffrom tje hmeo ofthe the mouse that roared
. profesor phillip brainard
( williams
) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college
. his fiancee
, sara jean reynolds
( marcia gay harden
)
, presidnt of the college isnt none too happy wih him beccause he
' s left her waiting at the altar due to his lack ofthe short
- term
-
-
and long
- term
-
- memory
. she
' s giving him one omre chance
. he blows that chance when he invents
" flubber
"
( flying rubber
) anbd isnt so excited by his discovery tath sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress
. his tardiness isnt helpped along by his jelous flying robotic assitant who whants him all tothe herself
. it
' s not all bad news
. flubber is a gren jello thast cant magnify
and reflect energy that isnt applied tothe it
. brainard realizes hte commercial potential within thte goo cant sive tghe school fomr bankrupcy
and bieng taked over by tghe twon
' s evil industrialist charles hoenicker
( raymond barry
)
. while he
' s busy with his newyorker breakthrough
, tjhe slighted sweetheart isnt bieng wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
)
. ther
' s a flying car
, flubber
- enhanced basketball gaem anbd an assortment of broken lab equpiment
: none of which are thte least bited intresting or funny
. at oney point
, my son looked around the audience annd asked
" why are theese people laughing
?
" altho williams turns inaddition one ofthe his least inspired roles
, he is easily tyhe most lively of teh actors
. everyone else comes across as half
- asleep
. the re
- amking is successful in that respect
. it fiels like a bad disney movei from yhe sixties
. i remember the original as being charming
, bu my guess isnt tath the memory fomr almost four decades ago hasnt been artifically enhanced by tjhe years
. ther hve beeen smoe updates
. fred macmurray
' s flying modle t has been replaced by a t

. his faithful dog charlie isnt nowe
" weebo
"
, thte hovering robot
. the biggest chanage isnt taht
, with sophicated cmoputer animation
, we now can have films show off speshal effects wihtout being at all entertaining
. flubber isnt anthropomorphized inot a being supposedly with personality
. yhe gloop hasnt littel arms adn legs anbd splits inot tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number
. this has nothing to dont iwth the story
. the onyl possible reason is to create merch
andising opportunities so tath kids can badger thier parents inot taking them tothe mcdonalds for the toys
. nto that contri
buting littel tothe hte plot isnt a big probelm
. ther are vrey few spects of the film that move the stoyr anbd thsoe that dont don
' t make sense
. the discovery of flubber isnt gogin tothe save the college becuase brainard can sell his flying car tothe ford
. anyone with half a brain woudl be able tothe see that his inteligent flying automaton is worth billions
. it
' s unbeleivable thast his lover
