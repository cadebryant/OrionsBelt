> from writter annd directer darren stein comes jawbreaker
, the poorly told tale of waht cant happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong
. at reagan high
, four girls are sitting onthe top of tghe world
. courtney shane
, palyed by rose mcgowan
, holds the title of meanest
, most disrespectful soul infront teh school
. everyone hates her
,
but everyone envies her due to her popularity
. courtney is thte
" leader
" ofthe her clique
, whihc also includes julie
, palyed by rebecca gayheart
, liz purr
, played by charlotte roldan
, annd marcie
, played by julie benz are the otehr threee inthe thge group
. it is liz
' s seventeenth birthday
,
and julie
, courtney
,
and marcie concur that tehy will play a seemingly innocent prank onthe her
,
but the prank results in tjhe death of liz
. just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one
, tghe foursome deside to cover uv yhe death tothe make it look like a murder committed by someone else
.
and also jstu liuke in other teen directed movies
, noe of the four don
' t agress witht hiding it
, thsi time thgat character being julie
.
and finally
, just liek in other teen movies
, htere is a witness outside yhe group trying to hide the truth
. thsi time tyhat character being fern mayo
( judy greer
)
, who isnt subject to many cracks from courtney
' s group
, as well as the entire skool
.
> from here
, jawbreaker turns into a predicatble tale of revenge
, bad morals
,
and at least trying tothe dont the right hting
. not onyl is yhe scirpt weak
, on a whole yhe acting isnt horrid thanks tothe a large amount ofthe the main casted
. judy greer isnt undeniably awful as her oen dimentional
, annoying charater
, as she overacts every line she has
. also on the bad side ofthe acting isnt julie benz
, almost falling tothe tghe annoying factor that greer delivers
. on the positive side of acting
, rose mcgowan performs well here
, bu doesn
' t match her wickedly clever performence as
" tatum
"
, infact 1996
' s scream
. mcgowan
' s role isnt annoying
,
but this onyl adds to tjhe film
. she isnt wickedly mean
, anbd even
though she a well
- writed character
, you downright hite her
. faring even better tahn mcgowan isnt rebecca gayheart
, who is always exceptionally believable as her roles
. when the script feeds her a one or twpo dimensional character
, she turns it into threee
, alwasy puting strong emotion adn power inot her roles
. gayheart isn
' t given as much tothe do here as she wass infront 1998
' s urban legend
, bu you can still git a strong tast ofthe her acting skills in jawbreaker
. jawbreaker drifts annd mi
anders diffrent sub plots throughout
, hardly throwing anytying for the viewer tothe git asorbed in
. we git way off ofthe the topic of tghe jawbreaker insident
,
and git into thnigs thta don
' t have anytying tothe dont with tyhe actual film
. the beginning
and endig are storng
, it
' s jsut tyhe middle thast needs a lot ofthe help
. during tghe body ofthe tghe movei
, it isnt undeniably repeative
, never progressing towords a conclusion
. nothing to grab the viewer
' s interest is arround
,
and tjhe same
, extremely annoying song plays over
and over again
. jawbreaker tries tothe git off on thge smae tyme ofthe humer utilizied infact tyhe 1995 film clueless
, bu falls flat
. tje fewd gags that atually wokr die off quickly anbd die off with a bang
. all infact all
, a horrable disappointment
. thge bottom line
: thge tagline reads
,
" even the sweetest c
andies are sour as death inside
.
" yes
, thgat isnt too true
. noone matter how good this film may hvea looked
, it fails to deliver
.
