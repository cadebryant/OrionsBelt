teh sequel to tyhe fugitive
( 1993
)
, u
. s marshals isnt an averege thriller using it ' s association with hte fugitive just so it can mkea a fewd extra bucks
. tommy lee jones returns to his role as cheif deputy samuel gerard
, yhe grizzly cop who wass after harrison ford iin tje fugitive
. thsi time
, he ' s affter fugitive mark sheridan
( snipes
) who thte police thiunk killed twpo fbi aggenst
,
bu ofthe course he ' s beeen setted uv
,
adn whn tje polical plane escort he
(
and gerard
) are riding crashes
, he makse a run for it
, gerard nto so hot onthe his tail
. whta follows is about 2 hours ofthe acation
, brought to us by thge directer of exceutive decision
( 1995
)
, another film curiously involving a plane
. wehn comparing this movei to the fugitive
, tjhe prequel isnt far superior
.
bu even on it ' s pwn
, u
. s marshals is a pretty lousy movei
. hwile the originnal ws reasonably intelligent
,
and had a fugitive tothe root for
, the audience feels strangely distanced ffrom snipes fugitive
, mailny beccause we know so little about him until way inot tyhe film ' s overlong running time
. hwile the fugitive gave a littel tiem to develop harrison fords charachter
, u
. s marshals isnt straight in there
, pulling it ' s trump card
( the place crash
) almsot immediately
. to be honest
, i couldn ' t care less if snipe ' s charactor got captured or nto
. snipes peformance is averege
,
adn his carachter gets surprisingly littel screen time
( considering he isnt the fugitive
) fo reasons i ' ll explain later
. tommy lee jones is as fine as ever
,
allthough his role isnt hardly a challenge
. tje sence ofthe deja vu was overwhelming
. i know it ' s thge smae role fomr the fugitive
,
bu htere is seamingly no attempt tothe deveop his character ffrom the lastr film
. there ' s a few ' nudge nudge ' references from the first film
,
but apart from thgat
, nothing
. nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie
. downey jnr isnt ok as fbi agent john royce who ' s roped inot the chase
,
anbd sexy french actress irene jacob wanders inspite
annd out ofthe the movie as snipes wife
. nobody looks as if theri hvaing a good time
,
annd all thge performers are on autopilot
. the supporting cast are o
. k
,
bu when it comes to performances
, u
. s marshals falls flat on it ' s face
. it doesn ' t fare any better plot
- wise
, either
. thte film starts off iwth gerard trying to capture snipes
,
but
thn veers off into terrorists territory
. as said above
, hte film is an normal
, averege terroist thriller
, seen a milion times befoer
,
bu is useing the fugitive reputation tothe mkea it soudn more professional
. if thsi film wasn ' t tjhe ' sequel ' to the fugitive
, this would probablly go straight to video
, or nto even beeen made at all
, because it ' s so averege
.
and because ofthe the film ' s plot changing it ' s course
, snipes is almost forgotten aart
,
annd hardly features inwhich the movei
. stuart baird
, tghe director
, isnt all right
,
but there ' s no particular scene that stands outloud
. it ' s directer isnt tjhe usual action movei style
. even tyhe plane crash isnt sorely lacking in tension
. the special effects are nice
, especially teh plane crash
,
and there ' s a ogod
( if veyr loud
) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith
.
but iin the end
, u
. s marshals suffers fomr an overwhelmingly lack ofthe excitement
. sure
, it ' s loud
adn dumb
,
bu in thte end u
. s marshals just ain ' t fun
. borde performers
and a lackluster plot
and script
, dont not amke a ogod action movie
. overall rating
