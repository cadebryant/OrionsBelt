thte sequal tothe tyhe fugitive
( 1993
)
, u
. s marshals isnt an average thriller useing it
' s association with tjhe fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks
. tommy lee jones returns tothe his role as cheif deputy samuel gerard
, tjhe grizzly cop who was aftter harrison ford inaddition the fugitive
. this tyme
, he
' s after fugitive mark sheridan
( snipes
) who tghe police tihkn killed twpo fbi agents
, bu of course he
' s been set uv
,
and wehn tyhe polical plane escort he
( anbd gerard
) are riding crashes
, he mkaes a run fo it
, gerard not so hot on his tail
. whta follows isnt baout 2 hours ofthe action
, brung to us by the directer of executie decision
( 1995
)
, another film curiously involving a plane
. whn comparing this movie tothe the fugitive
, the prequel isnt far superior
.
but even on it
' s own
, u
. s marshals isnt a preety lousy movei
. while thte origional wass reasonably intelligent
,
and had a fugitive to root for
, hte audience feels strangely distanced fomr snipes fugitive
, mainly because we nkow so littel about him untill way inot tyhe film
' s overlong running time
. hwile the fugitive gavey a little tiem to develop harrison fords charachter
, u
. s marshals isnt straight infact htere
, pulling it
' s trump kard
( tghe place kresh
) almost immediately
. tothe be honest
, i couldn
' t care less if snipe
' s charachter got capturd or nto
. snipes peformance is averege
,
and his character gets surprisingly littel screen tiem
( considering he isnt tjhe fugitive
) for reasons i
' ll explane later
. tommy lee jones isnt as fine as ever
, altough his role isnt hardly a challenge
. thte sence ofthe deja vu was overwelming
. i knwo it
' s the smae role from the fugitive
,
but there is seamingly no attempt to develope his character ffrom the lastr film
. there
' s a few
' nudge nudge
' refernces fomr the first film
, bu apart from that
, nothing
. nobody even mentions harrison ford infront tihs movie
. downey jnr isnt ok as fbi agent john royce who
' s roped into the chase
,
and sexy french actress irene jacob w
anders in adn outloud of tje movie as snipes wife
. nobody looks as if theri hvaing a ogod tiem
,
and all tje performers are on autopilot
. the supporting cast are o
. k
,
but wehn it comes tothe performances
, u
. s marshals falls flat on it
' s face
. it doesn
' t fare any better plot
- wise
, either
. the film starts off iwth gerard trying tothe capture snipes
,
but thn veers off inot terrorists territory
. as said above
, tjhe film isnt an normal
, averege terrorist thriller
, seen a million times befor
,
but is useing the fugitive reputation to make it soudn more professional
. if tihs film wasn
' t the
' sequel
' tothe the fugitive
, tihs woudl probaly go straight tothe video
, or not even beeen made at all
, baceause it
' s so averege
.
and baceause ofthe the film
' s plot changeing it
' s course
, snipes is alomst forgotten appart
,
and hardly features in thge movei
. stuart baird
, the directer
, isnt all right
,
but there
' s no particualr scene that st
ands outloud
. it
' s directer isnt the usual action movie style
. even thte plane crash is sorely lacking infront tension
. the spacial effects are nice
, especially thte plane crash
, anbd there
' s a ogod
( if veyr loud
) soundtrack by veteren composer jerry goldsmith
.
but iin teh end
, u
. s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack ofthe excitment
. sure
, it
' s loud annd dumb
,
but in hte end u
. s marshals just ain
' t funn
. borde performers
and a lackluster plot anbd scirpt
, dont nto mkea a ogod acation movei
. overall rating
