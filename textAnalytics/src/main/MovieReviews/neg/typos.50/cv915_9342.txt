' s onyl one presidental electon every four yersa
, bu it seems like every few monthes we get anohter presidental conspiracy movei painted as
_ the
_ thriller ofthe the yearm
. infact 1997
, we
' ve hadnt absolute power
, air force one
, shatow conspiracy
and murder at 1600
. thsi noe is baout as lame duck as old gerald ford
, trying tothe bring us a complex plot ofthe cover
- up
and intrigue bu copping outloud over anbd over agina with rehashes ofthe acation flick st
andbys
. here
' s what happens htis tiem
. it
' s night at hte white house
. a secretery is having sex wtih smoe unidentified guy with a cute
butt
. thge next day she
' s dead
and hotshot detective wesley snipes isnt called in
. how do we know he
' s a hotshot
? we
' ve seen the traditional acation flick opener
-
- the clever hostage negotation scene
. it
' s not so clever htis time
, consisting ofthe snipes disarming a suicidal ex
- government employee holding a gun tothe his head infront tyhe middle of thge strent
. snipes is off tothe the white house
, where he finds yhe secret service head
( the shiny bald head ofthe daniel benzali
) won
' t cooperate iwth him at all
. inaddition fatc
, if not for the intervention ofthe national security adviser alan alda
, snipes wouldn
' t have beeen alowed in teh white house at all
. alda helps snipes outloud furuther
, assigning a sexy escret service agent
( diane lane
) to ect as his liaisn
.
.
. a very dangerous liaison
. well
, nto really
, i jsut wnated to sday that
. almost immediately
, a suspect is foudn
, an eccentric night janitor seen flirting whith tyhe deceased onthe noe ofthe the security videos
. snipes doesn
' t buy it
, adn launchs into an indeendent investigation of his own
, oen that reveals planted evidence
and rumatic involvement by teh rpesident
' s son
. snipes
' partner
, an alwyas
- wisecracking dennis miller
, calls him up every once infront awhile with more news
and lane
, who at first doesn
' t believe snipes
, eventually
and predictably comes arround
, annd risks her ass tothe break into social security storage
and break out smoe classified information
. forthe the frist hour or so
, muder at 1600 looks liek it sould be gonig somewhere interesting
. sure
, we hvae tothe sit through the lame opening sequence
and plenty mroe lame scenes aftter that
,
but hte hwole muder in tghe white house thing mkaes fo an interesting premise that isnt never quite delivered upon
. snipes adn lane don
' t amking for a bad acation team
,
but with nothing to wokr with
, they
' re jstu cogs in thge bad movei machine
. dennis miller might as well not even be in yhe movei
; tehy waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than tehy doed in bordello ofthe blood
,
and that
' s saying a lot
. whn you git tothe tyhe lastr half
- hour
, teh movie hasnt descended metaphorically adn litterally inot a wet sewer
, busting outloud the ood break
- into
- the
- building undreground climax
. adn when htey finally reveal who killed tjhe woman anbd why
, ytou
' ll wish you never sat through tihs movie at all
