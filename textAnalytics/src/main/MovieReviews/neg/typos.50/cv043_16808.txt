" party camp
,
" isnt oen of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i
' ve seen iin awhile
. a lite rip
- off of the
" meatballs
" series
, tghe film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk
. that
' s realyl baout all thta can be said about thge
" plot
" beccause nothing much happens
, exept that tjhe main character
, wise
- cracking jerry
(
andrew ross
)
, hasnt the hots for a cute blonde
( kerry brennan
)
, annd there is a big contest in hte climax
. how fun
! sicne
,
" party camp
,
" has practically no screenplay adn htere is noone talent at all involved
, the least the makers coudl have done was make it raunchy
and exploitative
. it
' s nto thta i htikn exploitation isnt necessarily a good qualiy
,
but when you are tlaking baout a dull turke like htis
, the least tht could have been done would be tothe fill it iwth a lot of mindless sex
. even a psychopathic slasher at the camp owudl hvea done the trick
. at least
, thne
, it wouldn
' t have been such a chore to sit thru
. never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat
. thge comedy was eazy tothe spot
,
but it wasn
' t the least bit funny
. it was groan
- inducing
. constanly throghout
, i was asking myself if directer gary graver acually thougth thsi movie ws worth anything
. so what saves
,
" party camp
,
" ffrom the dreaded zero star rating
? well
, that
' s simple
: jewel shepard
, as a flighty bimbo
, was admitedly fun tothe watch
. altho nothing sould ahev saved htis film from the lowest depths ofthe motion picture trash
, at least if yhe film hadnt centered on shepard
, she might have been able to add a little spice tothe an otherwise rancid
, low
- budget teen comedy
.
