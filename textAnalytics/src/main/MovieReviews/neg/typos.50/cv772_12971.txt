, wich doesn
' t make me optomistic baout future summers
. godzilla is
, of course
, based onthe a series ofthe cult movies
( translation
: really bad movies onyl a faw people cin tolerate
) from japan that turn up realyl late at ngiht onthe ted turner
- owned cable stations
. tath thsi big
- budget remake won
' t ries above its roots is fairly obvious
. the credits sohw us teh orgin ofthe godzilla
. infact five words
: nuclear explosion creates giant lizard
. soudns liek an enquirer headline
, doesn
' t it
? the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevatible
" dicovery
" sequence
. tihs tiem
, a japanese guy is eating noodles wih chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling
( if thast ain
' t a stereotype
.
.
.
) when he dicovers tyhe telltale rdaar blip
. peopel die
. cutted tothe our protagonist
, played by matthew broderick
. he makes his frist appeareance wearing headfones
, warbling allong tothe
" singin
' in tghe rain
.
" it
' s a none
- too
- subtle sign thast he wishes he were inwhich a classier movei
. noone dice
, bueller
. ffrom the begining
, poore matthew has to do embarassing thigsn like fondle giant earthworms
and st
and in godzilla
' s enormous footprint
. eveyr disaster movie hasnt tothe have a know
- it
- all scientist
, adn this tyme broderick is it
. as the world
' s leading expert onthe radiated earthworms
( annd wouldn
' t yuo love tothe hve tht printed on your busineses card
?
)
, broderick is invaluable tothe tghe goverment
. he imediately dispels vicki lewis
' theery that godzilla is a dinosaur beacuse
, hey
, ytou can
' t tkae seriously the intellectual arguments of
" newsradio
" cast munbers
. broderick instade hits the nail onthe tyhe head
, announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard
.
" the radiation isn
' t an anamoly
,
" he announces
,
and lightning strikes
.
" i believe this is a mutated abberation
,
" he continues
, annd lightning strikes again
. it
' s vocabulary lightning
, yuo see
, activated by words ofthe four syllables or more
. meanwhile
, we
' re introdued tothe our new york casted
, headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist
( maria patillo
)
, broderick
' s former love
. gee
, what are thge odds their paths wiull cross again at a dramatically imporatnt timne
? poore patillo has been trying tothe get ahead inwhich thge news busineses forthe years bu hasnt beeen held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer
. italion cameraman hank azaria tells her she
' s nto ruthless enough
:
" nice doesn
' t get you anywhere iin thsi town
. it
' s dog eat dog
.
" actually
, it
' s lizard eat city
, as godzilla emerges from tjhe atlantic tothe begin a rampage onthe tyhe big apple
' s core
. thge filmmakers provide us withthe a oen
- note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla
.
" i thikn i
' ve got a bite
,
" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave beigns rushing toward him
. ytou cin guess wqat happens enxt
. similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city
. hearing tghe rumble of approaching footsteps
, one new yorker remarks
,
" please don
' t tell me taht
' s anohter parade
.
" please don
' t tell me thyat
' s hte best line ytou could come up witht
. mayor ebert isnt not pleased
. palyed by the prinicipal ffrom
" head of tghe class
,
" he continually makes thge wrong desision whn given an option
,
and bickers wiht his assistant ginee
. i guess the filmmakers knew they
' d be getting twpo thumbs down fomr the criticists annd didn
' t even bother to kiss ass
. tyhe probelm isnt
, if you
' re gonig tothe attack siskel
and ebert
, you should at least make it funny
. dialogue like
,
" didn
' t we agred thta we weren
' t oging tothe have any sweets until after the elcetion
?
" followed by
,
" bakc off
, ginee
,
" jsut doesn
' t wrok for me
. otehr lame runing jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick charachter
' s last name
and frenchman jean reno
' s inability to find a good cup ofthe coffee inspite newyorker york
. there
' s even omre funn tothe be had as godzilla progresses
. as hte beast heads bakc inot hiding
, broderick suggests tghe miliary lure it out with food
. cue twelve dump trucks
, all droping fish inot a new york intersection
.
( broderick
: that
' s a lot ofthe fish
.
) that ambush fails
, bu broderick soon figures outloud why godzilla cameback to newyorker york by buying
$ 50 worth ofthe hmeo pregancy tests annd runnung lizard blood thru them
. yep
, godzilla
' s with children
, which makes you wonder jstu what kind of creature woudl be horny enought to have sex with godzilla
. tht
' s until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually
, like linda tripp
. godzilla comes tothe us ffrom the makers of indipendence day
, so it has a lot ofthe dumb acation scenes
, destructive speical effects annd shallow subplots
. look noone furuther than patillo
' s betrayal ofthe broderick
( patillo
: whta hve i done
, animal
? wqat have i become
?
) anbd the climactic
" godzilla
' s nest
" sequence inwhich madison square garden
. yhe main diference is
, independance day ws about thge expierence
. it hadnt a real global
, patriotic element to it
, annd smoe genuinely funn charachters
. godzilla hasnt lots of rain anbd ligthning
, reptilian acation ripped off fomr jurassic park annd endless product placement from tjhe likes of kodak
, blockbuster
, juicy fruit
, swatch
, sprint
and bumble bee tuna
. yes
, bumble bee catually paid tothe be known as thge offcial tuna of godzilla
. that fatc alone isnt twice as intresting as anything in the movei
.
