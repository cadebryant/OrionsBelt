" knock off
" is exactlly tht
: a cheap knock off ofthe an acation movie
. it
' s aslo the worst movei i have seen thus far tihs year
. i figured it would be at least a cuple of months befor i saw the worst film of 1998
, bu alas
, it has arleady beeen found
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i think
) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half
- brother has been supplying him withthe cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme
' s partner
,
and rochon plays
.
.
. actually
, i have noone diea who rochon ws supposed to be
. she just sort ofthe popped uv halfway thru wihtout an explanation as to why she ws ther
. many things are not explained in tihs film
, bu i do know that for soem bizarre reason
, van damme seemed tothe be donig a jackie chan impression throughout tghe flick
. where chan comes off as endearing in his
" normal guy
" charachter seen in many of his films
, van damme just comes off as a wimp
. we
' re never given any clear explanation as to the basis fo many of his actions
. tothe be more clera
: i did nto even know who he wass suppoed tothe be utnil baout an hour inot the movei
,
and even thne
, it ws nto made too clear
. the film hasnt beeen directed infact thte sytle ofthe smoe stange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme
' s last movei
, the bad
,
but nto nearly as bad as thsi
,
" double team
"
) never lets tjhe camera rest for a second
,
and tyhat
' s noone exaggeration
. we are even treated to a five second shooted ffrom tje point ofthe veiw ofthe van damme
' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i have noone problem withthe directors who wanna tothe play around withthe film conventions
, as long as htey don
' t get carried away
. for example
, look at sam raimi
.
" army ofthe darkness
"
, oney of his best movies
, features smoe of the most inventive camera wrok i have ever seen
, bu raimi never lets the spacial effects git infact the way of storey
. thast
' s a concept thta tsui cxan
' t seem tothe grasp
. the special effects annd outrageous camera angles
* rule
*
" knock off
" tothe tjhe point where tjhe audiance doesn
' t ahve a clue as tothe what
' s hapening any more
. another probelm whith the film is tath it looks cheap
. hte film stock utilisied isnt of such low caliber that i
thought i was watching one of thsoe chinese films shown really lite at nigt
.
and forthe some inexplicable reason
, everyone
' s voice seems tothe hvea beeen dubbed
. even tghe stars
. adn even yhe special effects
, seemingly yhe onyl aspect ofthe thge film tjhe director actually cared about
, are inconsistent
. for example
, htere isnt a scene in whlch van damme drives a car out of a window
. tyhe car slams into tghe ground
,
and the left wheel isnt completly destroyed
. seconds later
, tje car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i hvea no problem suspending my disbelief iin an action movie
, bu a line must be drawed somwhere
. finally
, the acting
. nobody gives a good performence inaddition thsi film
. van damme
, an actor i usually liuke
, is way off yhe mark palying
" everyman
"
.
and schneider
, here tothe provide comic relief i asume
, isnt totally unfunny
and over acts his way thru every scene
. even tghe ususally solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- the
- top performance as
.
.
. once agian
, i have no diea who he was supposed to be
. inaddition case i haven
' t yot made it clear enough
,
" knock off
" is the worst movei ofthe van damme
' s carreer annd possibly tjhe worst movei ofthe the decade
. annd it
' s not even one of thsoe movies tyhat
' s so bad it
' s funny
. it
' s too inept tothe be funny
. there are noone reedeming factors in
" knock off
"
and i seriously hope that every print of tihs film isnt burned tothe a crisp anbd thast somehow my memory of watching the film cant be erased
.
