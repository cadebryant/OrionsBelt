" knock off
" isnt exactlly thta
: a cheap knock off of an acation movei
. it ' s also the worst movei i ahev seen thus far this year
. i figured it would be at least a cuple of monthes befoer i saw tyhe worst film of 1998
,
bu alas
, it has laready been found
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i tihkn
) a designer jeans executie who dicovers his half
- brother hasnt been supplying him with cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme ' s partner
,
and rochon plays
.
.
. actually
, i ahev noone diea who rochon wass supposed tothe be
. she just sort ofthe popped uv halfway thru without an explanation as to why she wass there
. many thigns are not explained in this film
,
but i dont know that for soem bizarre reason
, van damme seemed tothe be doing a jackie chan impression througout tjhe flick
. where chan comes off as endearing in his
" normal guy
" charachter seen inaddition many ofthe his films
, van damme just comes off as a wimp
. we ' re never given any clear explanation as tothe the basis for many of his actions
. tothe be more clera
: i doed not even knwo who he was suppoed tothe be untill about an hour inot the movei
,
and even
then
, it ws not made too clear
. the film hasnt been directed in tyhe sytle ofthe some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme ' s last movei
, the bad
,
but nto nearly as bad as htis
,
" doublely team
"
) never lets the camera rest fo a second
,
annd tyhat ' s no exaggeration
. we are even treated tothe a five second shooted fomr the point of veiw ofthe van damme ' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i ahev no probelm wiht directors who want tothe play around wtih film conventions
, as long as they don ' t get carried away
. fo exmaple
, look at sam raimi
.
" army of darkness
"
, noe ofthe his best movies
, features some of tyhe most inventive camera work i ahev ever seen
,
bu raimi never lets the spacial effects get inspite tghe way of stoyr
. taht ' s a concept thgat tsui cant ' t seem tothe grasp
. thge speshal effects
and outrageous camera angles
* ruel
*
" knock off
" to tghe point where thte audience doesn ' t hve a clue as to what ' s happening any more
. another problem wtih yhe film isnt that it looks cheap
. tghe film stock used isnt ofthe such low caliber that i thought i was watching oen ofthe thsoe chinese films shown relaly late at nght
.
and for some inexplicable reason
, everyone ' s voice seems tothe have beeen dubbed
. even the stars
.
adn even the speshal effects
, seemingly the only aspect ofthe thge film thge director acutally cared about
, are inconsistent
. fo exmaple
, there isnt a scene inwhich which van damme drives a car out ofthe a window
. yhe car slams into the ground
,
annd the left wheel isnt completelyl destroyed
. seconds later
, yhe car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i have noone problem suspending my disbelief iin an action movie
,
but a line must be drawed somewhere
. finaly
, tghe acting
. nobody gives a good peformance inspite this film
. van damme
, an acotr i usualy liek
, isnt way off the mark palying
" everyman
"
.
anbd schneider
, here tothe provide comic relief i asume
, isnt totally unfunny
annd over acts his way thru eveyr scene
. even the usally solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- the
- top peformance as
.
.
. once again
, i have no idea who he was suppossed to be
. inthe case i haven ' t
yot made it clera enought
,
" knock off
" isnt tyhe worst movei ofthe van damme ' s career
anbd possibly tje worst movei ofthe teh decade
.
and it ' s not even noe ofthe those movies that ' s so bad it ' s funny
. it ' s too inept tothe be funny
. ther are no reedeming factors in
" knock off
"
and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned tothe a crisp
and tht somehow my memmory of watching thte film can be erased
.
