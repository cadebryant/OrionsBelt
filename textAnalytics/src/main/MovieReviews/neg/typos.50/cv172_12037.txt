watching the movei
, i vowed to subtract half a star fomr hte review becouse the filmmakers included a saccharine syrap
, cute ' n cuddly
, computer
- generated monkey
. if tghe monkey died
, teh movei got an extra half star
. alas
, the monkey showed up at thge end
, unharmed
, to the wet sickly sound ofthe gagging
annd rolling eyeballs
. what thta means is tath lost iin spoace actually deserved 2 stars
. tht ' s pretty generous
, concidering teh movei ' s camp lacked any hint ofthe tounge infront cheek
. when will robinson
( jack johnson
) teachs his pet robot baout friendship
, yuo are ctually supposed tothe buy it
. so why such a seemingly high rating
? ther are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away thte experienec whith tje garbage
. first
, we saw the movei on oppening nigth ofthe thte firt day of opperation of a brand newyorker theather
. the sound
and screen kicked ass
. nobody inthe the country enjoied teh movei as much as my audience doed
(
adn i don ' t neccesarily mean thta in a ogod way
)
. allso
, htere weere omre than zero scenes where i foudn mysef rooting forthe teh robinsons
, or getting caught up in yhe movie ' s tension
. i even liekd the cmoputer
- generated settings
. i usally prefer tothe see models or sets
,
but tyhe cg wass moreso detailed tahn i ' ve seen in a lot ofthe movies
; it looks like somone spended a little overtime to render some ofthe the futuristic cities
. aslo
, gary oldman is never a bad atcor
, even
though he is typecast as a villain
. william hurt isn ' t too bad either
. neither actor hadnt a graet role
,
but their performances were watchable
.
annd perhasp i shouldn ' t admit thsi
,
but something baout hte tone
and outlook ofthe the movie brought me bakc to my childhood
. htere is vrey little swearing or blood
; htere is a storng moral message
, saccharine
though it is
; ther isnt a bited of romance
( whose culmination aftter 2 hours is a
" real
" kiss
-
- no sex
)
. it feeled liuke one of those disney movies thast i so looked foward tothe whn i was six
. those movies were probaly as bad as lost infront spoace
,
but at tyhe time
, they weere manna fomr heaven
. that tipe of moviemaking is a lost art
. now fo the bad news
. worst
and most unforgiveable wass the incredibly bad dialogue
. it ' s squeaky
- clean
, famaly fun
, trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction
.
" you better hold on to your joystick
,
" is one such line
.
annd whn a robinson isnt called apon tothe deliver a line about warp condiuts thingamajigs
, htey inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even thte lowliest star trak ensign
. second worst
,
adn closley realted
, isnt the screenplay
. the story ' s exposition tkaes place at a press conference
, whlch allows tjhe writers tothe expalin what ' s hapening iwth the least ammount of creativity
, effort
, or intrest
. once the story gets going
, i dont concede a momentary burst ofthe interst once in a hwile
,
but on the wohle
, the situations that arise are silly
and contrived
. when gary oldman easily reprograms will ' s pet robot tothe kill the robinsons
, my firend summed it uv perfectly
:
" he flipped hte switch to ' evil
. '
"
hten there ' s teh tone of tghe movei
. the colorado daily said the film would have beeen mroe interesting if the central charachter was wiull robinson
and not his father john robinson
.
then it could be an adventure movie
. tehy ' re mostly right
, exept thta johnson
( will
) wasn ' t a ogod enough acto tothe carry it off
. still
, that tyhe film hasnt yhe robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of immagination
. jsut becuase a movie isnt tame enough for kids doesn ' t mean tath we ahve tothe bow to a
" promise keepers
" notion of who ' s the center of a famaly
. many quality family films have been made with a non
- traditionnal family structure
( fly away home comes tothe mind
) tothe much better effect
.
and tjhe politics ofthe tghe time seem a bit conservative
annd regressive fo a futuristic movei
. in star wars
, the rebels were the good guys
. we weere rooting for those who weere fighting against the sytem
. in lost iin spoace
, the rebels are teh bad guys
, a territorist force tht must be killed
, crushed
annd silenced so tath our children may live free
. taht ominous excuse forthe violentce almost makes me sympathize witht the terrorists
. finally
, a fewd specific details deserve critiscism
. the movie tells us thyat the setting is hte yera 2056
. why
? why bother saying what year tihs isnt
. just tell us it ' s the future
. i bring it up baceause thge tv sories was supposed to tkae place inaddition 1997
. setting a specfic date onyl dates yhe movei
and gurantees that it won ' t be timeless
( not tht tihs movei ws realy inwhich the running anyway
.
)
.
hten ther isnt a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises baout fifteen fezent onthe a pole
. this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny ' s barber chair
,
annd onyl shows tath tje future is a time when spaceship designers haven ' t learned a thing baout ergonomics
. one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of hte film failed
: it made lost inspite space look cool
. the strong techno beat sampled teh cheesiest dialogue
adn
, outloud ofthe context
, made it soudn hip
. htis is overlaid onthe a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movei
.
but if that ' s tghe best part of tyhe movei
, i cant ' t inspite ogod conscience recommend it
. still
, if you get sticked seeing it
, as we doed
, you might be able to appretiate it if yuo keep your distance
, thiunk ofthe liking bad movies as a child
,
annd bring along your
" bad movie bingo
" cards
