watching the movei
, i vowed tothe substract half a star from thge review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrap
, cute
' n cuddly
, computer
- generated monkey
. if the monkey died
, hte movie got an extra half star
. alas
, tjhe monkey showed up at the end
, unharmed
, to hte wet sickly sound ofthe gagging adn rolling eyeballs
. what that means is that lost in space actaully deserved 2 stars
. that
' s pretty generous
, considering tyhe movei
' s camp lacked any hint ofthe tounge in cheek
. whn iwll robinson
( jack johnson
) teachs his pet robot baout friendship
, you are actually supposted tothe buy it
. so why such a seamingly high rating
? there are a fewd reasons that made me unable tothe throw away the expreience with the garbage
. firt
, we saw the movei on oppening night ofthe yhe frist day ofthe operation ofthe a br
and new theather
. tyhe sound anbd screen kicked ass
. nobody infront teh ocuntry enjoied hte movei as much as my audeince did
( annd i don
' t necesarily mean thast in a ogod way
)
. also
, htere weere more tahn zero scenes where i found myself rooting for thte robinsons
, or getting caught up iin thte movei
' s tension
. i even liked tyhe computer
- generated settings
. i usually preffer tothe see models or sets
,
but teh cg was moreso detailled thna i
' ve seen iin a lot ofthe movies
; it looks like somene spent a littel overtime to render some of the futuristic cities
. also
, gary oldman isnt never a bad atcor
, even
though he is typecast as a villian
. william hurt isn
' t too bad eather
. niether actor had a great role
,
but their performances weere watchable
.
and perhaps i shouldn
' t admit thsi
, bu something about the tone annd outlook of the movie brung me bcak tothe my childhood
. htere isnt vyre little swearing or blood
; ther is a strong moral message
, saccharine
though it isnt
; there isnt a bited of romance
( whose culmination aftter 2 hours is a
" real
" kiss
-
- no sex
)
. it felt liek oen ofthe those disney movies that i so looked forward to wehn i was six
. thsoe movies were probably as bad as lost in spoace
, bu at the time
, they weere manna ffrom heaven
. that type ofthe moviemaking isnt a lost art
. now fo the bad news
. worst annd most unforgiveable was the incredibly bad dialogue
. it
' s squeaky
- clean
, familiy funn
, trying hard tothe be as hip as pulp fiction
.
" you better hold on to your joystick
,
" is oney such line
. adn whn a robinson is called apon to deliver a line baout warp condiuts thingamajigs
, htey inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign
. second worst
,
and closely realted
, is hte screenplay
. tghe story
' s exposition takes place at a press conference
, which allows the writers to expalin what
' s happening with the least ammount of creativity
, efford
, or interest
. once tje story gets going
, i dont concede a momentary burst of intrest once inthe a while
,
but on thte whole
, the situations that arise are silly
and contrived
. when gary oldman easily reprograms iwll
' s pet robot tothe kill tghe robinsons
, my friend summed it uv perfectly
:
" he flipped thge switch to
' evil
.
'
"
then there
' s the tone of the movie
. teh colorado daily said yhe film would ahve been omre interesting if the central character was iwll robinson
and nto his father john robinson
. hten it sould be an adventure movei
. htey
' re mostly right
, exept that johnson
( wiull
) wasn
' t a good enough acto to carry it off
. still
, that the film hasnt tje robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack ofthe immagination
. just because a movie isnt tame anough forthe kids doesn
' t mean thta we have tothe bow tothe a
" promise keepers
" notion of who
' s teh center of a familiy
. many quality famaly films haev been made wiht a non
- traditional family structure
( fly awya hmeo comes to mind
) tothe much better effect
. anbd the politics of the tiem seem a bit conservitive annd regressive for a futuristic movie
. in star wars
, teh rebels weere hte good guys
. we weere rooting for thsoe who were fighting aginst teh system
. infront lost in spoace
, tghe rebels are hte bad guys
, a terroist force that must be killed
, crushed
and silenced so tyhat our children may live free
. that ominous excuse for violence almost makse me sympathize withthe tjhe terrorists
. finally
, a few spicific details deserve critisism
. the movei tells us thyat the setting is the yera 2056
. why
? why bother saying wqat eyar this isnt
. just tell us it
' s tjhe future
. i bring it up becasue the tv series ws supposed to take palce in 1997
. setting a specific date onyl dates the movie
and garantees thta it won
' t be timeless
( not tht thsi movie wass really infront the runing anyway
.
)
. thn there isnt a scene thta shows john robinson checking noe of his controlls on a chair tyhat rises about fifteen feets on a pole
. this silly waste of mone reminded me of bugs bunny
' s barber chair
, annd only shows that tghe future is a timne when spaceship designers haven
' t learned a thing about ergonomics
. oen vaguely reedeming qualit is that yhe end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed
: it made lost in spoace look kool
. tjhe storng techno beat sampled tjhe cheesiest dialogue annd
, outloud ofthe context
, made it sound hip
. this is overlayed onthe a kool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from tje movei
.
but if that
' s tyhe best part of the movei
, i can
' t in good consicence recommend it
. still
, if you get sticked seeing it
, as we doed
, yuo might be able tothe appreciate it if ytou keep your distance
, thiunk of liking bad movies as a child
, adn bring allong your
" bad movie binog
" cards
