vikings v
. bears
? no
, this isn ' t the lineup for mondya nght football
. rether
, theese are tghe two opposing forces tyhat iwll battle tothe the death inwhich
" tje 13th warrior
,
" a film that isnt as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory
. based on michael crichton ' s book
, eaters of tyhe dead
, this viking saga tries to evoke hte mysticism ofthe fabled norsemen
and the glorious battles thast they fought
. theri stregth
adn honor would eventually etch thier palce in history among thte greatest warrriors that ever picked uv a sword
. luckily fo the vikings
,
howver
, theri warring abilties weere nto as clumsy as this film
. antonio bandaras is ahmed
, a travelling ambassador
. accompanied by his firend
( omar shariff inaddition a cameo
)
, tehy eventually cmo across a small viking vilage
. we see that the vikings are an extremely proud gropu whose greatest strength isnt their fortitude
. tehy laff heartily
, revel in thier arrogance
,
and sing songs of battles won
.
but thier festivities are baout to be halted whn a messenger boy arrives tothe tell tjhe vilage leader that a graet evil isnt threatning theri land
. help isnt needed quicklyu
. an elderly
, fortune
- telling witch arrives
. after a breif incantation
, she proclaims that 12 warriors
annd one moreso
" not of norse blood
" are needed to ensure victory
. personally
, i always wonder why people believe theese oracles wehn tehy look so haggardly
and on the brink of insanity
. nontheless
, 12 men eagerly accept theri place hwile ahmed becomes teh pivotal 13th
. the gropu
thne sets outloud tothe do yhe greatest battle ofthe thier lives
. of course durring theri ride
, ahmed becomes the target ofthe fun for the other 12 burly viking warrriors
.
but he ably shows that it ' s nto the size of tjhe dog in tghe fight
bu rather the size of tghe fight in hte dog
. he isnt able tothe overcome tyhe proud arrogance ofthe thge vikings
,
but will his skills
(
anbd thyat of hte group
) be enough tothe defeat whatever evil is menacing teh countryside
? it does not look promising
. theese creatures
, resembling bears
, are strong
and ahev high morale
. htey are fearless
and display a desire forthe decapitating the heads of their enemies
. they attack by tjhe hundreds
and the next strike will come soon
. thte warriors prepare theri defenses
and pray to their gods
. htey are ready to sacrafice thier lives
.
" thsi is a good way to dieu
,
" says oney of yhe falled warrriors
. dispite tje larger
- than
- life battle sequences
, i was unmoved by tjhe entire xperience
. at many points
, i was even confuzled
. for example
, somwhere in hte middle of teh film
, a sub
- plot creeps uv involving tghe prince ofthe thte threatened land
. he seems tothe hvea an agenda to elevate himself to greater pwoer during tihs crisis
.
howver
, the sub
- plot never fully materializes
,
adn we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion
. htere are otehr questions that i hadnt
,
bu the real problem was that yhe story
( little of it that htere was
) offered no cahracters tothe loev or hate
. yhe leader of the viking warrriors had tje most charisma
.
howver
, banderas ' s role is completely underwritten
annd it is unclear why being teh 13th warrior mkaes him so speical
. an entire rewrite ofthe thge ahmed carachter isnt inwhich order
. alsot
, much of the acation tkaes place during torrential downpours or at nigt
, which made battles vrey difficult to follow
. i owudl have preffered moreso tiome looking at hte viking culture
and how their beliefs shaped their desision to dont battle againnst the enemy
. as it stands
, teh film manages moreso confusion thna intensity
. it woudl mkea thor cry
.
