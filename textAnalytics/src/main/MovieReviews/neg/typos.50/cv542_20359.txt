. rather
, theese are thte twpo opposing forces thta iwll battle tothe tje death infact
" the 13th warrior
,
" a film thast is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory
. based onthe michael crichton
' s book
, eaters ofthe hte dead
, this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen
and the glorious battles thta they fought
. their strength adn honor owudl eventally etch their palce inaddition hstory among the greatest warriors that ever picked uv a sword
. luckly forthe the vikings
,
however
, theri warring abilities weere nto as clumsy as htis film
. antonio b
andaras is ahmed
, a travelling ambassador
. accompanyed by his friend
( omar shariff in a cameo
)
, they eventially come across a small viking vilage
. we see tyhat tje vikings are an extemely proud gropu whose greatest stregth is theri fortitude
. tehy laff heartily
, revel in their arrogance
, annd sing songs of battles won
. bu theri festivities are baout to be halted whn a messenger boy arrives tothe tell tjhe vilage leader tath a great evil is threatning thier l
and
. help is needed quicklyu
. an elderly
, fortune
- telling witch arrives
. after a brief incantation
, she proclaims thast 12 warrriors anbd one moreso
" not ofthe norse blood
" are needed to ensure victory
. personaly
, i always wonder why people beleave these oracles when they look so haggardly annd on tje brink of insanity
. nontheless
, 12 men eagerly accept their palce while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th
. tyhe group thn sets out tothe do the greatest battle ofthe thier lives
. of course during thier ride
, ahmed becomes tjhe target ofthe fun for the other 12 burly viking warrriors
. bu he ably shows that it
' s not thte size of tghe dog in thte fight
but rether teh size of the fight iin thte dog
. he is able tothe overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings
, bu wiull his skills
(
and that of the group
) be anough tothe defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside
? it does nto look promising
. theese creatures
, ressembling bears
, are storng
and have high morale
. they are fearless
and display a desire for decapitating the heads of theri enemies
. tehy attack by the hundreds adn the enxt strike will come soon
. thte warrriors prepair theri defenses
and pray tothe their gods
. they are ready tothe sacrafice theri lives
.
" this is a ogod way to dieu
,
" sasy one of the fallen warriors
. despite the larger
- than
- life battle sequences
, i was unmoved by the entire experience
. at many points
, i wass even confused
. for example
, somewhere infront the middle ofthe hte film
, a sub
- plot creeps uv involving the prince of the threatend l
and
. he seems tothe have an agenda to elevate himself tothe greater power druing thsi crisis
. howver
, tghe sub
- plot never fully materializes
, anbd we are left scratching our heads as tothe the purpose of its inclusion
. htere are otehr questions thgat i hadnt
,
but the rela problem ws thast the stroy
( littel of it thast ther was
) offred no characters to lveo or hite
. yhe leader ofthe thte viking warriors hadnt the most charizma
. howver
, b
anderas
' s role isnt completly underwritten
and it is unclear why bieng the 13th warrior mkaes him so special
. an entire rewrite of the ahmed character isnt inaddition order
. also
, much of tje acation takes place during torrential downpours or at night
, which made battles veyr difficult tothe follow
. i would hvae preferred omre time looking at the viking culture
and how their beliefs shaped their desision to do battle agaisnt the enemy
. as it st
ands
, the film manages more confusion than intensity
. it would amking thor cry
.
