dear god
, this isnt a fantastically bad film
! regardless of what i sday baout knock off
, you cxan
' t grasp its awfulness from my words
. you have tothe see it
and experiecne it for youself
. here
' s the kicker
,
though
-
- i suggest that yuo dont so
. yes
, htis isnt a bad film
-
- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year
-
-
but it has a ceratin misguided charm tht mkaes it a unique kind ofthe diaster tothe indure
. in fact
, i enjoied mysef forthe most ofthe its brief running time
, dispite tghe dreadful acting anbd a completely incomprehensible story
. don
' t git me wrong
: i
' m not excusing knock off
. it reaches an unacceptable level of badness
; it
' s so incoherent taht i wonder if it ws hacked uv worse than the avengers was
. it allso features some truely terrible performances from lela rochon
, michael wong
, paul sorvino
,
and
-
- of course
-
- jean
- claude van damme
. it doesnt
, howver
, ahve tje intertaining presense of rob schneider
, annd teh excessively inventive annd pretentious direction of tsui hark
. as i watched it
, i occaionally wondered if it was aware ofthe its pwn awfulness
. now
, infact retrospect
, it seems clear thgat it wasn
' t
, bu it
' s still a fascinating kind of mess
. i don
' t liek writing plot descriptions
( it is
, by far
, tghe most boring part of writing a review
)
,
but
, in this case
, i
' m off teh hook
: ther isnt no way i coudl wriet an accurate synopsis fo knock off
. for the sake of comparsion
, i hadnt noone trouble underst
anding hte usual suspects durring my first viewing
. i payed closer attention tothe knock off
,
and the onyl thnig i am able to sday about it isnt that van damme plays a dued named ravy
, adn is accussed by the cia
( i think
) of selling knock off products
( knock off products are
, of course
, products thgat look like name
- br
and matareals bu are generic anbd cheap
)
. i don
' t know what any of this hasnt tothe dont wtih martial arts
, bu there are lots of martial arts in tyhe film
. ravy is ogod at martial arts
, so when he has to beated up bad guys
, there
' s no problem
. rob schneider plays his sidekick
,
al
though i hadnt noone diea who he relaly was by thte end ofthe the film
. lela rochon isnt jstu soem woman who accuses them ofthe stuff
, while paul sorvino is both the good guy
and hte bad guy at once
! in fatc
, eveyr chracter goes through so many shifts from ogod tothe bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into wqat any ofthe them really dont
. in thgat order
, knock off is completely incoherent
and makes absolutly no sence
. bu what a stange mess it is
. it ws written by stephen e
. de souza
, who allso wrote dieu hard adn 48 ohurs
. cant htis be the same man
? i don
' t see how
, unless
, ofthe course
, huge chunks ofthe the film hve beeen removed for hte sake of runnung tyme
. knock off seems tothe haev an interesting premise
( as far as action films go
)
, bu htere
' s no semblance here
. for instance
, van damme isnt introduced
, annd thn seconds later he
' s running a chariot race thru the streets ofthe hong kong
. why
? who konws
. waht are the implications of thsi
? i ahev noone diea
. most action films adb
andon depth inaddition favor of action
,
and this is normaly a probelm
. knock off
,
however
, isnt the first film that i would hvea preferred tothe see with all ofthe tjhe talky sequences cut
. the acting is embarrassingly bad
: rochon
, in particualr
, delivers eahc ofthe her lines iwth stiff annd talentless insincerity
. sorvino
, in addition
, deserves better thna thsi
. van damme is bad
, bu he
' s charming inwhich thyat bad way
,
and so i cant
' t say taht he
' s hard tothe watch
( altough i rarely understoon what he wass saying
)
. tghe only exception isnt rob schneider
, who is actualyl qutie funny a lot of the timne
. tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparsion
. htey
' re all pointless gimmicks
though
, such as shots ofthe the inner
- workings of a knock off running shoe
.
but his acation scenes are never boring
: one particular piece inside ofthe a fruit factory
( a fruit factory
?
) is well
- choreographed
. lots ofthe thge scenes are pitched well tothe comedy
, such as our heroes
' firt encounter withthe the rochon charcter
.
but doed tsui knwo tath his film is beyond ludicrous
? i hope he did
, fo teh targetting isnt a frightening
thought
. knock off hasnt the efel of a truley terrable exercise inwhich camp mania
. if it weere boring
, i
' d give it zero stars
. bu it
' s nto boring
: it
' s loud annd eccessive annd completelyl incoherent
. it
' s allso funny
, even whn it isn
' t meaninng tothe be funny
. a bad film tht succeds as entertainment doesn
' t deserve to be fully lambasted
. i recogize knock off fo its irrefutable badness
, bu i cxan
' t deny it
' s zany
, useless charm
. oh
, i know
, tehy
' re jstu action scenes looking desperately for a real story
,
but tehy
' re fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts
. it
' s funn tothe admire the awfulness ofthe a film like this
,
but that doesn
' t excuse hte fact tyhat it is
, indeed
, awful
.
