sometimes i wonder jstu what hte censors are thinking
. take this film
,
" naked killer
"
, amoung it
' s ingredients are hevy doses ofthe voilence
, rape sequences
, straight
and lesbian sex scenes adn what our sytem calls
" coarse laguage
"
. bu waht do those intelligent peopel at the censorship bereau choose to remove infact case someone wiull get offended
? noe word
- penis
. thyat
' s it
. inaddition spite ofthe everthing else iin hte movei thge oen thing tyhat tjhe censors deside is too much is
" penis
.
"
. it raelly restores ytou
' re faith inthe tghe system
, huh
? anyway
, tyhat
' s just a side point
. whn naked killer was released in the local independant cinemas around melbourne
, it ws advertised ad nausuem as a hip
, cool
, controversial thriller
. what htey forgot tothe mention was that it isn
' t very good
. teh plot involves male cop tinam
( simon yam
)
, investigating a series of brutal murders
. while getting a haircut he meets adn finds himselv attracted to a girl named kitty
( chingmy yau
)
, who
, after extracting revenge onthe the man who killed her father
, falls in with professional killer sister cindy
( svenwara madoka
)
. realising kitty hasnt potential
, cindy decides to turain kitty in sevral unusual
and rediculous ways
and gives her a newyorker idenity
.
however iin tghe course ofthe his investigation tinam
( who believed kitty had disappeared
)
, runs inot her again
, bu isn
' t qutie sure if it
' s her
. to complicate matters thge actuall serial killlers
, princess annd baby
, who a fromer students of cindy
,
and have beeen told to kill their old master annd her newyorker student
. ffrom
then teh action ensues
.
.
. all in all
, thsi is nto a well done movie
. tje script isnt awful
, the direction all over the place
, thge editing isnt jerky
and confusing
and yhe subtitling is suprizingly poore
.
however the are a fewd st
and alone pieces that dont entertain
. tjhe shoot outloud inspite tyhe car park is almost woo
- like inthe adrenaline
. the fight scenes are energetic annd i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different
. let me put thsi way
, if ytou liek action
- git something else
, if yuo like storng womens iin movies
- get something else
, if ytou hve dont deside between thsi
and
" black cat
" for your hong kong female acation
- don
' t git eather
. even forthe curiousity value it just isn
' t worth it
. let
' s face it
- if ever the ws a movei that became popular on it
' s subject alone
, htis isnt it
.
