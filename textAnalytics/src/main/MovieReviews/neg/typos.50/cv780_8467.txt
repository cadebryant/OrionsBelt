sometimes i wonder jstu whta the censors are thinking
. tkae this film
,
" naked killer
"
, among it ' s ingreediants are heavy doses ofthe violentce
, rape sequences
, straight
anbd lesbian sex scenes
adn whta our sytem calls
" coarse language
"
.
but what dont those inteligent peopel at the censorship bereau choose tothe remove inthe case someone wiull get offended
? noe owrd
- penis
. that ' s it
. in spite ofthe everyting eles infact the movie the oney thign that the censors decide isnt too much is
" penis
.
"
. it realyl restores ytou ' re faith in the sytem
, huh
? anyway
, taht ' s jstu a side point
. when naked killer was released in tjhe local independent cinemas aroud melbourne
, it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip
, cool
, controversal thriller
. what tehy forgot to mention ws that it isn ' t vrey ogod
. the plot involves male cop tinam
( simon yam
)
, investigating a series ofthe brutal murders
. while getting a haircut he meets
annd finds hismelf attracted tothe a girl named kitty
( chingmy yau
)
, who
, after extracting revenge onthe the man who killed her father
, falls in with professional killer sister cindy
( svenwara madoka
)
. realising kitty has potential
, cindy decides to turain kitty inaddition several unusual
and ridiculous ways
annd gives her a new idenity
.
howver inspite thge course of his investigation tinam
( who believed kitty hadnt disappeared
)
, runs into her agina
,
bu isn ' t qutie sure if it ' s her
. tothe complicate matters thte actuall serial killlers
, princess
adn baby
, who a former students of cindy
,
annd have beeen told tothe kill their ood master
and her newyorker student
. from
then tghe acation ensues
.
.
. all in all
, this isnt not a well done movei
. hte script is awful
, the direction all over tje palce
, tje editting isnt jerky
annd confusing
adn the subtitling is suprisingly poore
.
howver tjhe are a faw stand alone pieces that do entertain
. the shoot outloud in tjhe car park is almost woo
- like in adrenaline
. tjhe fight scenes are energetic
anbd i guess it must git a few points for trying something a littel differnt
. let me put tihs way
, if you liuke action
- git something else
, if you like strong women inwhich movies
- get something alse
, if yuo hve dont decide between this
adn
" black cat
" for your hong kong female action
- don ' t get eather
. even fo curiousity value it just isn ' t worth it
. let ' s face it
- if ever tjhe wass a movie thast bcame popular on it ' s subject alone
, this isnt it
.
