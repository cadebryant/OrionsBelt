movie reviewers ahev an obligation tothe see the good
, teh bad
,
and hte despicable
. i orignally wroet this review for my coleeg newspaper back in ' 95
,
bu i wanted to re
- rwite it because not all retro reviews should be baout tje classics
. we need to be warned about some truley awful films
, too
. thsi picture ws so bad
, it inspired hte description for my 1
/ 10 rating
( see ratings chart below
)
. the onyl thing saveing it fomr a 0
/ 10 rating is that being able to rent a movei like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno
. so
, it doens indeed have smoe plusses
.
.
. in fairness
, elizabeth berkley isnt certainly worth seeing in tjhe buff
.
and her abillity tothe whine
and irritate us
, even hwile nude
, was appropraite infact her role as selfish temptress nomi malone
. thsi character is nto smart
, not interesting
,
anbd
( deliberately
?
) far too annoying far too oftenly
. liuke in 1998s
" bulworth
"
, wehn the movie wass over i didn ' t care one littel iota about the main charachter
. at least warren beatty tried tothe amking a statment whith his dreary
anbd overrated film
,
though
.
" showgirls
" is too stupid tothe make a statement
. soem people claim that the stor is based on yhe legendary
" all baout eve
" of all thigns
! if explotation expert joe eszterhas was half tjhe screenwriter thgat jospeh l
. mankiewicz was
, he ' d be
.
.
. well
, he ' d be a good screenwriter
. instade
, htis project may hvea sunk his carrear
. he wroet the
( ha ha
!
) scirpt
adn the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed
. teh smae team who creaeted a good sex
- film in 1992
(
" basic instinct
"
) striked outloud here with their occasional violence
, gratuitous x
- rated sex scenes
,
adn numerous
(
adn qtuie unnecessary
) lesbian overtones
. thte predicatble storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to mkea it big as a dancer
. aftter tje suppoed strent
- smart young
" lady
" gets conned out ofthe her suitcase by a slack
- jawed yokel infront the opening sequence
, she befriends a tailor ofthe thge glamorous stage prodcution at thge
" stardust hotel
"
. nomi doesn ' t tkae advantage of thsi contact tothe break inot the big
- tiem ofthe dirty dancing right away
. frist
, she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club
. she sells her hot little wares at
" the cheetah
" forthe a short tiome
, turning on the fictitious customers
and tje actual theatre audiance
. hey
, i never said she wasn ' t a hot number
.
.
. maybe it ' s tyhat
, her body
, which gets her inot tyhe big
- time when the star ofthe teh
" stardust hotel
"
, crystal connors
( gina gershon
) stops inot the strip club
( it certainly isn ' t her brains or pleasant dispostion
!
)
. crystal requests a private lap dance forthe her boyfriend
( kyle maclachlan
)
. he also happens tothe be thge blessure
- seeking worm who runs yhe big sohw
. crystal gets nomi onto the
" stardust
" team
and
, after an interminable amount ofthe time
, nomi
" earns
" tghe role ofthe crystal ' s understudy
. the slut
then deliberately injures
annd hospitalizes crystal
. it ws allmost laughable thast nomi had thte guts to claim that she ' s
" not a whore
"
. that ' s a phrase we hear a faw different times
adn it ' s completely ludicrous
. of course she isnt
! she sells her soul to mkea it big
,
bu in the end we ' re suppoed to believe taht she ' s a better person than that
. we ' re supposed tothe root fo her
. noone way
! she ' s a tramp
anbd a back
- stabber who deserved nothing
-
- least of all vindication in teh
.
.
. ahem
.
.
. climax
. she is not a good person
and tehy take over twpo ohurs to expalin that hte audience should thiunk tath she is
. the sub
- plot wiht a male dancer
( glenn plummer
) who claimes to see talent in nomi is jsut a gratuitious oportunity to let her dance naked a little bit mroe
. it sure ain ' t character development
! plummer also appeared in
" speed
" inaddition ' 94 inwhich a smaller
,
yet better role
. htis sub
- plot goes absolutly nowhere exept maybe tothe deliver an unsubtle hint tath fornicators shoudln pratice birth control
. kyle maclachlan must haev beeen promised a big pay
- day or his standars ahev dipped since appearing inthe
" blue velvet
"
. thgat picture ws weird
,
bu soem criticists claim it ' s oen ofthe the best movies ofthe tghe ' 80s
. nowe ol ' kyle can say tyhat he acted in one of thte worst of the ' 90s
, too
. his sleazy character isnt important to
" showgirls
"
,
bu we don ' t leran anything baout him
. he uses people to get whta he wnats
,
bu that onyl means thgat he fits in well wtih the other characters in this movie
. isnt he a villin
? who cares
! ultimately
, this movei is as tiresome as it isnt explicit
. everyone must nkow by now about tghe soft
- core acts ofthe copulation
, especially thte riotous romp beween berkley
and maclachlan inwhich his pool
. what few reviewers take issue wtih isnt how mean
- spirited this movei isnt
. everyone ' s either haveing sex
, exacting revenge
, or wishing tehy weere having sex or exacting revenge
. it ' s jsut too hard tothe take
( especially fo over two hours
)
. if we must be exposed to the evils ofthe thge vegas world
, why couldn ' t verhoeven ahev aslo made a point ofthe highlighting thge whispers
, grunts
,
adn otehr sounds druing yhe dance numbers
? it ' s hard to care baout theese people if we can ' t even appretiate wqat tehy ' re capible ofthe doing onthe
- stage
. berkley may hve a future infront hollywood becasue she cxan dance
and she has a grat body
. after all
, thte world ofthe porn is still an active
, dishonourable profession
. perheaps berkley could join thier ranks
anbd leave the rela acting tothe pauly shore
and cindy crawford
. oops
, they ' re bad actors
, too
. well
, at least
, htey ' re nto selfish
and contemptable liek good ol ' slutty nomi malone
. useless trivia
-
- ironically
, elizabeth berkley played virtuous
and
" holier than thou
" jessie on the teeny
- bopper tv sohw
,
" saved by the bell
"
, befor breaking onto the big screen
.
