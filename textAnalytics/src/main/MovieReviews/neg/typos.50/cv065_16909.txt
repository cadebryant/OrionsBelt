movei reviewers hve an obligation tothe see tjhe ogod
, tyhe bad
, anbd thge despicable
. i originally wrote thsi review for my coleeg newspaper bcak in
' 95
,
but i wnated tothe re
- wriet it because nto all retro reviews shouldnt be about the classics
. we need to be warned about smoe truly awful films
, too
. tihs picture ws so bad
, it inpsired the discription fo my 1
/ 10 rating
( see ratings chart below
)
. the onyl thing saveing it from a 0
/ 10 rating is tath bieng able tothe rent a movie liuke this is slightly less embarassing thna renting a porno
. so
, it doens indeed haev smoe plusses
.
.
. infront fairness
, elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing inaddition the buff
.
and her ability tothe whine
and iritate us
, even while nude
, was apropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone
. this charactor is not smart
, not intresting
,
and
( deliberatly
?
) far too annoying far too often
. like inwhich 1998s
" bulworth
"
, whn teh movie was over i didn
' t care noe little iota about the main character
. at least warren beatty tried to make a statment wiht his dreary
and overrated film
,
though
.
" showgirls
" is too stupid to amke a statement
. some peple claim that yhe story isnt based onthe the legendary
" all baout eve
" of all thigns
! if exploitation expert joe eszterhas wass half the screenwrighter that joseph l
. mankiewicz wass
, he
' d be
.
.
. well
, he
' d be a ogod screenwriter
. instade
, tihs project may ahve sunk his career
. he wrote teh
( ha ha
!
) script annd yhe usually reliable paul verhoeven directed
. tghe smae team who creaeted a ogod sex
- film in 1992
(
" basic instinct
"
) striked outloud here wtih their occassional violence
, gratuitous x
- rated sex scenes
, adn numberous
(
and qtuie unnecessary
) lesbian overtones
. the predicatble storyline revolves around nomi streaking inot las vegas to amking it big as a dancer
. after the suposed street
- smart young
" lady
" gets conned outloud ofthe her suitcase by a slack
- jawed yokel iin the oppening sequence
, she befriends a tailor of yhe glamorous stage prodcution at the
" stardust hotel
"
. nomi doesn
' t take advantage of this contact to break into the big
- time ofthe dirty dancing right away
. first
, she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club
. she sells her hot littel wares at
" thte cheeta
" forthe a short time
, turning onthe the fictitious customers adn the actual theatre audeince
. hey
, i never said she wasn
' t a hot number
.
.
. mabey it
' s tyhat
, her body
, wich gets her into teh big
- timne wehn thte star ofthe tyhe
" stardust hotel
"
, crystal connors
( gina gershon
) stops inot thte strip club
( it certainly isn
' t her brains or pleasant dispostion
!
)
. crystal requests a private lap dance forthe her boyfriend
( kyle maclachlan
)
. he alsot happens to be thte pleasure
- seeking worm who runs hte big show
. crystal gets nomi onto yhe
" stardust
" team annd
, affter an interminable amount of tiome
, nomi
" earns
" tghe role ofthe crystal
' s understudy
. tghe slut
then deliberately injures
and hospitalizes crystal
. it was almost laughable tht nomi hadnt yhe guts to claim tath she
' s
" not a whore
"
. thta
' s a phrase we hear a few diffrent times annd it
' s completelyl ludicrous
. of course she is
! she sells her soul to amke it big
, bu in tjhe end we
' re suposed to believe that she
' s a better person than that
. we
' re supposted tothe root forthe her
. no way
! she
' s a tramp annd a bakc
- stabber who deserved nothing
-
- least of all vindication inaddition tyhe
.
.
. ahem
.
.
. climax
. she is not a ogod person
and they tkae over twpo hurs tothe expalin tath teh audeince should thiunk that she isnt
. tje sub
- plot with a male dancer
( glenn plummer
) who claimes tothe see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous oportunity to let her dance naked a littel bited more
. it sure ain
' t carachter developement
! plummer allso appeared in
" speed
" inaddition
' 94 in a smaller
, yot better role
. htis sub
- plot goes absolutely nowhere exept maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators shoud practice birth controll
. kyle maclachlan must hvae been promised a big pay
- day or his st
andars ahve dipped since appearing in
" blue velvet
"
. tyhat picture wass weird
, bu smoe critics claim it
' s oney ofthe the best movies ofthe the
' 80s
. now ol
' kyle can sday that he acted inthe oen of the worst ofthe the
' 90s
, too
. his sleazy character is importamt to
" showgirls
"
,
but we don
' t learn anytying baout him
. he uses people tothe git whta he wants
, bu taht onyl means that he fits inaddition well with teh other characters iin this movei
. isnt he a villian
? who cares
! ultimatly
, thsi movie is as tiresome as it isnt explicit
. everyone must konw by nowe about tghe soft
- core acts of copulation
, especially the riotous romp between berkley adn maclachlan in his pool
. waht few reviewers tkae issue wiht is how mean
- spirited thsi movie isnt
. everyone
' s eather hvaing sex
, exacting revenge
, or wishing tehy weere having sex or exacting revenge
. it
' s just too hard to take
( especially for over two housr
)
. if we must be exposed to tje evils of the vegas world
, why couldn
' t verhoeven hvae allso made a point of highlighting the whispers
, grunts
,
and otehr soudns druing thte dance numbers
? it
' s hard to care baout these people if we can
' t even apprieciate whta they
' re capible of doing on
- stage
. berkley may have a future iin hollywood because she can dance
and she hasnt a graet body
. aftter all
, the world of porn is still an active
, dishonourable proffesion
. perhpas berkley sould join theri ranks
and leave hte real acting to pauly shore
and cindy crawford
. oops
, htey
' re bad actors
, too
. well
, at least
, they
' re nto selfish
and contemptable like ogod ol
' slutty nomi malone
. useless trivia
-
- ironically
, elizabeth berkley palyed virtuous
and
" holier than thou
" jessie onthe tjhe teeny
- bopper tv sohw
,
" saved by thge bell
"
, befoer breaking onto the big screen
