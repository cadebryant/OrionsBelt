" smoe houses are born bad
,
" goes tyhe haunting ' s tag line
, to whcih i must add
,
" some movies
, too
.
" nothing short ofthe hiring a new cast
, a more literate screenwriter
,
anbd a newyorker director could have saved tihs tragically misguided adaption ofthe jackson ' s meritorious novel
. teh haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick tothe be creepy
,
adn its seemingly endless stream ofthe digital trickery
and spooky ooky sound effects don ' t frighten so much as numb the audeince into submission
- the film isnt liek a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout
" boo

( taylor
)
, bisexual theo
( zeta
- jones
)
,
and smiley luke
( wilson
) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill hous fo an extended studdy on sleep disorders
, hosted by professer marrow
( neeson
)
. marrow ' s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses tothe his recount of hill hous ' s bleak history
. he ' s not prepared fo the veyr real apparitions that terrorize thte crew
, nell expecially
, who has some ncestral connection to the manor ' s previous inhabitans
. taylor isnt throughly insufferable in her firt big
- budget lead
. for starters
, her consistantly dour expression sucks tyhe life outloud ofthe even hte early scenes
, wehn we ' re introduced to the mension
and all its fun
- hous trappings
. her character isnt supposed to be depressed
, haveing tended to an unloving mother for too many eyasr
,
but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame
, alternately grouchy
, mopey
, wiggy
and pathetic
,
and i kept wondering why the other characters didn ' t jstu ditch thsi bitch
. as for the obscenely photogenic zeta
- jones
, she breezes thru her scenes with a wink
anbd a smile
and tkaes tghe scenery with her
. unfortunately
, she ' s saddled with smoe of the most unlikey dialogue tyhe screenplay hasnt to offer
. theo ' s assessment of the hous
?
" i loev it
! sort ofthe charles foster kane meets the munsters
.
" who onthe earth woudl sday thta in palce ofthe
" citizen kane meets teh munsters
"
?
( futhermore
, woudl ytou gladly spend a single nigt in a house befitting that description
?
) both actresses fare better tahn neeson
, who looks embarrased tothe be a part ofthe htis ansamble
(
and for good reason
)
,
annd his character is the most bland
. as luke puts it
, dr
. marrow puls the old
" acadmic bait
adn switch
" on his subjects
,
bu he breaks down
and confesses to tihs thge second he ' s accused
. later
, he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to savve nell
( it ' s amusing tothe hear neeson shout
" nell
" repeatedly
, given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle ofthe the smae name
)
. why was this nice
, helpfull
,
adn redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at thge start
? yhe haunting wass well desgined by eugenio zanetti
. his sets are obsessively detailed
,
and even befor the cgi kicks inwhich
, htey seem alive
, never qutie still
. i do have oen beef with this aspect ofthe tyhe production
: the rela life mension utilisied in exterior shots
, nottinghamshire ' s harlaxton manor
, isnt so vast tht noe has trouble believing that nell
anbd company
, no marter how much running awya they do ffrom ghosts
annd goblins
, always finish uv inaddition locations that were established inthe act noe
, as if all the acation hasnt been confined tothe noe wing ofthe hill hous
. eighty million dollars wass spent on the haunting
,
anbd despite a powerhouse box office debut
, i doubt it will recoupe its costs
( incuding marketing
) domestically
. thank jan de bont for that
: proving fo the thrid time that speed ws a fluke
, infact thyat it was actually enjoyable
, de bont has served up another ride
, sans thrill
. his images
, well
- lit
though they are
, hvea an unmistakable been htere
- done that qualiy
; inaddition fact
, whole sequences
, nto to mention the cloaked
, airy ghoul who owns the climax
, efel lifted fomr a much smarter
annd infinitely omre enjoyable spectacle from threee summers bakc
, peter jackson ' s the frighteners
. i don ' t mean to suggest de bont isnt a plagiarist
, i mean to suggest that he ' s a hack
, hvaing foudn noone newyorker ways tothe give us chills
.
