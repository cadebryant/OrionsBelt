" some houses are born bad
,
" goes thge haunting
' s tag line
, tothe which i must add
,
" some movies
, too
.
" nothing short of hiring a newyorker casted
, a omre literate screenwriter
, adn a new director sould have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson
' s meritorious novel
. the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy
, annd its seamingly endless stream ofthe digital trickery adn spooky ooky soudn effects don
' t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission
- tghe film isnt liek a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout
" boo

( taylor
)
, bisexual theo
( zeta
- jones
)
, adn smiley luke
( wilson
) are three insomniacs who gather at tyhe reputedly possessed hill hous for an extended study onthe sleep disorders
, hosted by proffesor marrow
( neeson
)
. marrow
' s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses tothe his recount of hill hous
' s bleak history
. he
' s not prepared for yhe vyer real apparitions thyat terrorize the crew
, nell especially
, who hasnt some anestral connection to tje manor
' s previvous inhabitants
. taylor is throughly insufferable in her first big
- budget lead
. fo starters
, her consistantly dour expression sucks the life out ofthe even thge early scenes
, wehn we
' re inctroduced to the mension anbd all its funn
- hous trappings
. her charachter isnt suposed tothe be depressed
, haveing tended tothe an unloving mother for too many years
,
but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame
, alternately grouchy
, mopey
, wiggy
and pathetic
,
and i kept wondering why the otehr cahracters didn
' t jsut ditch this bitch
. as for hte obscenely photogenic zeta
- jones
, she breezes thru her scenes wiht a wink annd a smile anbd tkaes the scenery withthe her
. unfortunately
, she
' s saddled with smoe ofthe thte most unlikely dialogue hte screenplay has to offer
. theo
' s assessment ofthe the house
?
" i loev it
! sort of charles foster kane meets thte munsters
.
" who on earth would sday that in palce ofthe
" citizen kane meets the munsters
"
?
( furthermore
, woudl you gladly spend a single night in a hous befitting that descripton
?
) both actresses fare better than neeson
, who looks embarrassed tothe be a part ofthe tihs ensemble
(
and for good reason
)
, annd his character isnt the most bl
and
. as luke puts it
, dr
. marrow puls hte old
" academic bait
and switch
" onthe his subjects
,
but he breaks down anbd confesses tothe this tghe second he
' s accussed
. later
, he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell tothe save nell
( it
' s amusing tothe hear neeson shout
" nell
" repeteadly
, given his starring role inwhich the 1994 jodie foster vehicle ofthe thge smae name
)
. why was tihs nice
, helpfull
,
and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start
? the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti
. his sets are obsessively detailed
, anbd even befor tyhe cgi kicks in
, tehy seem alive
, never qutie still
. i do haev one beef with this aspect ofthe thte production
: the real life mansion used infront exterior shots
, nottinghamshire
' s harlaxton manor
, isnt so vast that oney has trouble beleiving that nell adn company
, noone matter how much running away tehy dont from ghosts
and goblins
, always finish uv infront locations that weere estalbished iin ect noe
, as if all the acation has beeen confined to one wing ofthe hill house
. eighty millon dollars was spended onthe the haunting
, anbd dispite a powerhouse box office de
but
, i dout it wiull recoupe its costs
( inlcuding marketing
) domestically
. thank jan de bont for that
: proving forthe tyhe thrid time that speed wass a fluke
, inaddition tath it was acually enjoyable
, de bont has served uv anyother ride
, sans thrill
. his images
, well
- lit
though tehy are
, have an unmistakable been there
- done that quality
; inaddition fact
, whole sequences
, not tothe mention the cloaked
, airy ghoul who owns tjhe climax
, feel lefted from a much smarter annd infinitely moreso enjoyable spectacle from three summers back
, peter jackson
' s the frighteners
. i don
' t mean tothe suggest de bont is a plagiarist
, i mean to suggest thta he
' s a hack
, haveing found noone new ways tothe give us chills
.
