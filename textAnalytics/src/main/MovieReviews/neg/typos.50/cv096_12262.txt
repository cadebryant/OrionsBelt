much ado baout nothing
. ah
, how sweet the irony
! it
' s accepted wisdom in soem circles
- amung english literature nuts
, mainly
- taht whenever a critic knocks shakespeare tehy are onyl doing so thru ignroance
. he jstu doesn
' t
" underst
and
" shakespeare
, you wiull hear them sday
. tje bard
' s work isnt aparently beyond criticism
. what a load ofthe old cobblers
. if theese arbiters ofthe public taste think kenneth branaugh
' s film of shakespeare
' s
" comedy
" much ado baout nothing isnt comedy in any modern sense of thte word
, it
' s tyme to git a life
. get monty python
. get woody allen
. git john waters
. whatever
. jsut git a rela taste ofthe soem clever
, witty
, risky comedy
.
and banish tihs nonsence to where it belongs
. drama
and tradgedy ws shakespeare
' s strength
. tothe my sensibilities
-
and i
' m no stick inthe the mud
- much ado about nothing resonates with noone spark whatsoever
. noone kidding
: htis film ranks amonth the most embarrassing twpo hours i ahev ever spent in a cinema infront my 20 years ofthe movie gogin
. the only thing tht stoped me walking out was loyalty to my lady freind
, as tihs wass our day outloud annd i hadn
' t seen her inspite aegs
.
but boy
, does she owe me noe
! i won
' t spend too much tiome onthe tyhe plot
. basically
, we follow the trials
and tribulations of two would
- be couples
- one young
, the otehr older
. there
' s some dark treachery amoungst all thsi
, bu everyone is so awfully jolly that yuo
' d hardly knwo it
. mind you
, ther
' s nothing wrong withthe the basic story
. good rumatic comedies based on similiar premises abound
. nothing wrong with most ofthe thte cast
, eather
. branaugh
, emma thompson adn denzel washington are all talented performers
. tje problem isnt the script
, or omre accurately
, shakespeare
' s originnal text
. light comedy shouldn
' t be complex
. yot wrapped inwhich elizabethan english
, the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend
. for tihs alone it will be a probelm for modern audiences unschooled inthe shakespeare
and inspite searc ofthe nothing mroe thna a good
, undem
anding laff
. the onyl laughs to escape my belly weere broght onthe by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves
, the actor once again miscast as a jealous half
- brother or something
. bu when dissected adn understood
, whta it all boils down tothe is that this sutff isnt just so goddamn lame
. htis isnt comedy so clean adn nice
and corny adn so devoid ofthe danger tath it leaves thsi viewer totally cold
. ho
, ho
, ho
, boy likes girl
! ho
, ho
, ho
, men are such klutzes
! ho
, ho
, ho
, she
' s so awfully clumsy
! oh please
! htere
' s witn inaddition here somwhere
, i
' m told
. i call it pretentious
. something lightweight striving tothe be something suphisticated through clever wordplay
. inthe thte end
, it
' s cringeworthy
. watching some ofthe tghe cinema patrons around me collapse witht laughter made much ado about nothing a very werid movei going experienec
. comedy
? bah
, humbug
!
