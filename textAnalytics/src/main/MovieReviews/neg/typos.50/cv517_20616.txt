ytou don
' t look at a ren
? magritte painting
and search for a deeper meaning
. yuo likewise don
' t look at noe for 88 minutes straight
. surrealist works are notable fo theri quirks
,
and tehy are fun
,
but looking at oen quirk fo an hour adn a half is exhausting
. that was my experience wiht i woke uv easly tghe day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy withthe no dialogue
. it
' s not a silent movie
; there isnt lots ofthe atmospheric music
, occasional screams annd weird sound effects
,
but nobody ever utters an audible word
.
though the film is disctinctive
, its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes
,
and as it progessed
, watching became a chore
. the only reason tjhe scirpt ever got filmed is becouse it ws wroten by thge psuedo
- legendary ed woud
, tyhe man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> from outer spoace adn night ofthe the ghouls
. the joke
, ofthe course
, isnt thyat his films are so bad
, tehy
' re good
; so humorous in theri inanity that they become hits
. i woke up early the day i died
, unfortunatly
, is so bad that it
' s raelly bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes from a mental hospital adn proceeds tothe wonder around
, stealing a car
, clothes
, adn a load of monay
. our thieve reaches a cementary
, where he witnesses a bizarre ritual
. he falls asleep anbd finds hismelf
, litterally
, in a hole
, with his money gone
. for whatever reason
, he isnt bent onthe getting his hard
- unearned cash bcak
( considering how easily he stealed it the firt timne
, why didn
' t he just go steal soem more
?
)
. he comes upon a list of the people who were at hte mysterious cerimony anbd commences to seek outloud earch ofthe them annd kill them if htey don
' t hvae wqat he is looking for
. i don
' t tihkn either director aris iliopulos nor ed woud realized thyat tihs would hve made a glorious 20 minute short
. the subject adn the style seem tothe have beeen made for it
. unfortunately
, twenty mintues worth of material isnt stretched outloud to moreso than four times thta lenght
,
and tje film simply overstays its already dubious welcome
. it grabbed my attention infact the begginning
and gradualy lost it as it whent on
, uv tothe tghe point where halfway thru i was already weary
. it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as htis noe can be so tedeous
; bu tje suprise wiull mear off when you consider how repeative it is
. i woke up eearly tje day i died isnt a comedy
, i guess
,
though it coudl have fooled me
. unlike most ed woud films
, htis one trys tothe be funny
and fails
, instade ofthe the otehr way around
. there
' s nothing inherently wrong witht that
, inspite fatc
, i thiunk it would only mkae sence for someone who hasnt been so
" good
" at mkaing unintentional comedies to tkae a stab at a rela one
. whether woud actulaly went for comedy in his scirpt we
' ll never know
,
but inwhich eather case
, htis is a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer phoenix
, john ritter
and others sohw uv fo short anbd pointless cameos
. ricci
, fo exmaple
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists of dancing arund wih zane in his motel room
and thn being thrown outloud
. thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. ws the home improvement teen heartthrob realyl thast desperate fo work
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies himself by making eird faces at the camera when he is not called apon tothe run arround wildly
and beated people up
. lack of dialogue makes him thte ultimate caricature
. teh carnival side
- sohw climax manages to demonstrate everthing thyat isnt wrong with this no
- budget production
. it
' s desparately unfunny
,
but thikns it
' s the funniest thing since plan 9
;
, it
' s so spontaneously surrealistic it makse your head spin all hwile bieng confusing anough to mkae your head spin twice as fast in the other direction
. i hope another film is made ffrom an ed woud screenplay forthe i woke uv eary thge day i died isnt not a fitting send
- off
