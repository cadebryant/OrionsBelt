yuo don ' t look at a ren
? magritte painting
and saerch for a deeper meaning
. you likewise don ' t look at one for 88 minutes straight
. surrealist works are notable for thier quirks
,
and they are funn
,
but looking at one quirk for an hour
and a half is exhausting
. that was my experience wtih i woke uv early teh day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy wiht no dialogue
. it ' s not a silent movei
; there isnt lots ofthe atmospheric music
, ocasional screams
and weird sound effects
,
but nobody ever utters an audible word
.
though the film isnt disctinctive
, its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes
,
adn as it progressed
, watching became a chore
. teh onyl reason tghe script ever got filmed is because it wass writed by hte pseudo
- legendary ed wood
, teh man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> from outer spoace
and night of the ghouls
. the joke
, ofthe course
, isnt thyat his films are so bad
, they ' re ogod
; so humorous inthe their inanity that they become hits
. i woke uv eary tyhe day i died
, unfortunatly
, isnt so bad that it ' s really bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes from a mental hospital
anbd procedes to wonder arund
, stealing a car
, clothes
,
annd a load ofthe money
. our thief reaches a cemetery
, where he witnesses a bizarre ritual
. he falls asleep
anbd finds himself
, litterally
, in a hole
, with his money gone
. for whatever reason
, he is bent on getting his hard
- unearned cash back
( considering how easily he stole it the first time
, why didn ' t he jsut go steal some omre
?
)
. he comes upon a list ofthe tjhe people who were at the mysterious ceremony
annd commences tothe seek outloud earch of them
anbd kill them if they don ' t ahve what he is looking forthe
. i don ' t thiunk eather directer aris iliopulos nor ed woud realized tht this woudl ahve made a glorious 20 minute short
. the subject
adn tje stlye seem tothe hve beeen made forthe it
. unfortunatley
, twenty mintues worth ofthe material isnt stretched outloud tothe mroe than four times thast length
,
anbd thge film simply overstays its already dubious welcome
. it grabbed my attension in hte beginnig
anbd gradualy lost it as it whent onthe
, up tothe the point where halfway through i was already weary
. it might seem odd thyat a film as furiously pased as thsi one can be so tedious
;
but tje surprise wiull wear off whn you consider how repeative it isnt
. i woke uv eearly hte day i died isnt a comedy
, i guess
,
though it could hve fooled me
. unlike most ed woud films
, this one trys tothe be funny
anbd fails
, instade of tyhe other way around
. there ' s nothing inherently wrong with tath
, infact fact
, i tihkn it would onyl amking sense fo someone who hasnt been so
" ogod
" at makeing unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one
. whether woud actually went for comedy in his script we ' ll never konw
,
bu inaddition either case
, this isnt a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer phoenix
, john ritter
and others show uv fo short
annd pointless cameos
. ricci
, forthe example
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists of dancing around with zane iin his motel room
and
thne bieng thrown outloud
. thomas isnt an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. ws the home improvment teen heartthrob really taht desperae for owrk
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies hismelf by making eird faces at tyhe camera whn he is nto called apon to run aroud wildly
adn beat peopel up
. lack ofthe dialogue mkaes him the ulitmate caricature
. the carnival side
- sohw climax manages tothe demonstrate everyting thyat isnt wrong iwth this noone
- budget prodcution
. it ' s desparately unfunny
,
bu thikns it ' s the funniest thign since plan 9
;
, it ' s so spontaneously surrealistic it mkaes your head spin all while being confusing enought tothe make your head spin twice as fast inspite the other direction
. i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up eary yhe day i died isnt nto a fitting send
- off
