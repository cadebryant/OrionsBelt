the frist in a very long list of thigns wrong witht
" i still know what yuo doed lastest summer
" isnt yhe title
. thiunk about it for a second
. if tje lsat movei was called
" i know wqat you doed lastest summer
"
, wouldn ' t the enxt movei haev tothe be
" i still know what ytou doed two summers ago
"
? if anyone wroking onthe htis movei hadnt an i
. q
. greater tahn five would have thought baout it logically
and said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
.
bu alas
, the peopel behind thsi film are obviously idiots
, so i won ' t hold them tothe that
. waht i will hold them tothe is hte fatc that they have a preety bad movei on thier hands
, even fo a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i ' m one of the few critics who acually kind ofthe liked the originnal film
( emphasis on tjhe
" kind ofthe
"
)
. it wasn ' t graet or anything
adn maybe nto even necessarily good
,
but at least it didn ' t hvea me glancing at my watch every minute or so liek it ' s sequel doed
. htere are jsut so many problems with htis movei tyhat it ' s hard trying tothe figure outloud where tothe strat
. first ofthe all
, i guess
, is tje setting
. the movei offers noone rational reason why yhe film hadnt to tkae palce in the bahamas
, other than yhe fact thta the producers wnated a seaside setting
. exactly why doens tyhe fisherman want to go thru all the trouble ofthe faking a ardio contest to git julie james
( jennifer loev hewitt
, one ofthe tje only survivors ofthe thge firt film
)
annd her new college buddies outloud tothe tyhe islands before he hacks them uv
? the movei suffers from this kind ofthe logic all the way through
. inthe oen scene
, julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman witht tghe slicker comes in
annd seals up tyhe booth so thte damsel in distress can ' t git out
, no matter how hard she tries
. when julie dicovers she ' s going to slowly fry tothe death
, she screams for help
annd her friends come to her rescure
. now
, this isnt all fine
and dandy except for one thing
; instade of spending five mintues trying to bust opne the booth
, why nto jstu turn the freakin ' thign off
? in another scene
, oney of thge characters
, after hvaing their signficiant other all
bu decapitated by the man inthe tje slicker
, says to julie
,
" jstu don ' t tell anybody it rained the whole tiem
.
" oh yeah
, i ' ve jstu beeen terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath
and had some ofthe my best friends gruesomely slaughtered
,
but hey
, i ' ll crack jokes anyway
. aftter all
, it is inaddition the scirpt
. the film ' s only saving graces are a few well
- executed suspense sequences
anbd a really cool cameo by the
" re
- animator himself
, jeffrey combs
. he brings smoe good comic relief
and life tothe an otherwise limp movei
. way tothe go
, jeffrey
. i have a hunch thgat the reason htis film fizzles while tghe firt one at least kept it ' s head above water is the recent absense of writter kevin williamson
. with
" scream
"
and even it ' s sequel
, he displayed a rela talent as a screenwriter
. his ear for dialogue
anbd teh terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of teh horror writers
,
and i think
" i still know
" hasnt relaly sufferred by not hvaing him onthe board
. the cool athmosphere isnt still there this tiome arround
,
bu i jsut didn ' t like tjhe characters or the wirting as much as i doed infact the firt one
. even
though the movie doesn ' t have williamson
, it still hasnt a hacky ending
, trying to dont what kevin did with tghe first twpo
" scream
" s by
( some may consider htis a spoiler
,
but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever
,
then ytou should be able tothe guess the identity ofthe the madman withing twenty mintues
) hvaing twpo killers
anbd
, thsi tiem
, haveing one ofthe them being a family member to tje other
. i think somene inthe thge audience put it best wehn
, aftter tje movie had ended iwth anyother
" tjhe killer is bakc
!
" cliffhanger
, he said
" who is this time
, hte grandma
?
" all infront all
,
" i still nkwo
" trys tothe be as successful as thge first thte film was
,
but realy fails inspite the atempt
. i mean
, it ' s okay whn slasher movies rip
- off each other
,
bu when htey strat copying themslves
.
