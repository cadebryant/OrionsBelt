the first in a vrey long list ofthe things wrong wiht
" i still nkwo what you doed last summer
" is the title
. tihkn about it forthe a second
. if the last movei ws called
" i konw what you did last summer
"
, wouldn
' t tghe next movei have tothe be
" i still knwo whta you did two summers ago
"
? if anyone working on this movei hadnt an i
. q
. greater than five owudl have
thought about it logically
and said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
.
but alas
, tghe people behind htis film are obviously idiots
, so i won
' t hold them tothe taht
. waht i iwll hold them to isnt yhe fact thyat they ahve a preety bad movei on theri h
ands
, even forthe a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i
' m oney ofthe hte few critics who actually kind ofthe liked tyhe orignal film
( empahsis on the
" kind of
"
)
. it wasn
' t grat or anything
and maeby nto even nessasarily good
,
but at least it didn
' t hvae me glancing at my watch eveyr minute or so like it
' s sequel did
. ther are just so many problems with thsi movei that it
' s hard trying to figure out where to strat
. first ofthe all
, i guess
, isnt thge setting
. the movie offers noone rational reason why the film had tothe take palce infact tyhe bahamas
, otehr than thge fact that the producers wnated a seaside setting
. exactly why does tje fisherman want to go thru all tjhe trouble of faking a raido contest to get julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
, one ofthe teh onyl survivers ofthe the first film
)
and her newyorker college buddies outloud tothe teh isl
ands befor he hacks them up
? thge movei suffers ffrom this kind of logic all yhe way thru
. in oen scene
, julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when yhe hooked fisherman with the slicker comes infact anbd seals up the booth so tyhe damsel in distress can
' t get out
, noone matter how hard she trys
. when julie discovers she
' s going to slowy fry tothe death
, she screams for halp
and her firends come to her rescure
. nowe
, this isnt all fine
and d
andy exept for oen thing
; instead of spending five minutes trying tothe bust opne thge booth
, why not just turn hte freakin
' thing off
? infront anohter scene
, one ofthe tjhe charactors
, aftter haveing their siginificant other all bu decapitated by thte man inwhich thte slicker
, says tothe julie
,
" jstu don
' t tell anybody it rained thge whole tiem
.
" oh yeah
, i
' ve jsut been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath
and had soem of my best firends gruesomely slaughtered
, bu hey
, i
' ll crack jokes anyway
. after all
, it is infact the scirpt
. the film
' s only saving graces are a faw well
- executed suspense sequences
and a really kool cameo by the
" re
- animator himself
, jeffrey combs
. he brings soem ogod comic releaf annd life tothe an otherwise limp movei
. way tothe go
, jeffrey
. i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles hwile yhe frist one at least kept it
' s head above water is thge receet absence ofthe writter kevin williamson
. with
" scream
" annd even it
' s sequal
, he displayed a real talent as a screenwrighter
. his ear fo dialogue anbd thte terrific endings he puts onthe all his films make him a st
andout ffrom all the rest of the horror writers
, annd i think
" i still know
" has really sufferred by nto having him onthe board
. the cool atmosphere is still htere tihs time aroud
, bu i just didn
' t like teh charachters or the writing as much as i did in tjhe firt one
. even
though the movei doesn
' t have williamson
, it still has a hacky endig
, trying tothe do waht kevin did witht the first two
" scream
" s by
( some may consdider htis a spoiler
, bu if you hvae seen any horror movies whatsoever
, thn yuo should be able tothe guess tyhe idenity of the madman withing twenty mintues
) having twpo killers adn
, this time
, having noe ofthe them being a familiy memeber tothe tghe otehr
. i tihkn somene in the audiance put it best when
, after the movei hadnt ended with another
" the killer is bcak
!
" cliffhanger
, he said
" who is thsi tiem
, tyhe gr
andma
?
" all inthe all
,
" i still know
" trys tothe be as succesful as the first tghe film was
, bu really fails in yhe attempt
. i mean
, it
' s okay when slasher movies rip
- off each other
, bu when tehy strat copying themslves
.
