the most interesting part of
" cin ' t hardly wait
" just happens to be nto onyl the most human
,
but for many of us
, tjhe oney part that many of us can easily relate to
. thgat is teh charcter of denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, tjhe film ' s sole sarcastic member who mocks everyting that goes on in thge film
,
annd at one point sist down on a couch
anbd looks totally borde
. thge film wisely holds over this moent
, nicely showing her alienation in the midst ofthe a large high school party
.
.
. almost too nicely
. for some members of the audience
( read
: me
)
, thsi is basically a mirror of what ' s going onthe with them watching htis film
. we sit ther wondering why we ' ve even bothered tothe see a film about a long high school party we probaly never felt the desire to go tothe inwhich the frist palce
. i would actually highly recomend tihs film if it satirized all of thsi
. after all
, this film isnt filled with a bunch ofthe pathetic stereotypes much ofthe whcih i went tothe high school wiht
. everyone ' s here
: hte jock
, tghe homecoming queen
, the nerd
(
annd his dominions ofthe trekkies
and x
- philes
)
, teh alienated wannabe writer
, the school spirit girl
, the pothead
( s
)
, the wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
,
anbd weirdly enought this film shows them as superficial
, lame
,
adn basically as a bunch ofthe losers
. exept for denise
, who rolls her eyes at everthing
,
adn easily becomes the most likable character even befoer she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something which is done fo each main character
, qoutes oscar wilde
- definite pointers ther
)
. unfortunatly
, tjhe writers
adn directors tkae sevral major misteps onthe thte way to mkaing tihs into an admirable
annd even likable film
. thge film
, as i said
, portrays most ofthe its characters as superficial
and jsut totally ignorant to everthing
.
howver
, instead ofthe sticking iwth this
, perhasp even going a bited further with it
, they let this lie
,
and actualyl mkea these characters into our heroes
. we follow several ofthe them
, all a bunch of moronic sterotypes with onyl a shread of humanity
and realism
,
anbd trys tothe tell boring
and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared
and
/ or identified wih them
.
and if we doed
, we certainly don ' t want to revisit that state of being
. here ' s a quick low
- down
: it ' s graduation
,
and we follow a bunch of seniors onthe the last niht
, otherwise known as the
" american grafitti
" or
, to a lesser extent
, yhe
" dazed
and confused
" cliche
. tyhe formal just followed them as htey drove aimlessly
; tghe latter doed a littel bited ofthe that
adn featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" cant ' t hardly wait
" just opts for a big indoor keg party
,
and a littel bited of aimless driving
, albiet ofthe tyhe i ' m
- whining
- becuase
- i
- cxan ' t
- get
- a
- girl
- i
- whant brand
. we follow many people aroud
,
bu mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, of
" that thing you do
!
"
)
, tyhe alienated writer
, who ' s been pining over tjhe homcoming queen
, amanda
( tjhe totally overrated jennifer loev hewitt
)
, fo the entirety of high skool because he thikns htey shared a moment their freshman yera over a freaking pop tart
. now tath she ' s broken up with her footall player boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides to go tothe hte party wiht a note he ' s written declaring his
" loev
" for her infact the hopes he ' ll build uv hte guts to give it tothe her
.
.
. even
though he ' s leaving fo a multi
- week intensive writing program hosted by none otehr tahn kurt vonnegut
( okay
: thge ingenius vonnegut or smoe icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. since that plot is incredibly lame
annd a track record of waht goes on wih it wouldn ' t be able to cary a commercial let alone a feature film
,
anbd because it ' s a party
, ther are some omre main charactors
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, fianlly surfacing affter
" dick tracy
"
)
, the nerd
(
and his dominions
) who has come uv with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike
, who ' s humiliated him for eyars
,
bu gets too caught uv infact drinking tothe do it
; kenny
( seth green
)
, hte wigger
, who has decided thast this party wiull be where he iwll finally get layed
( uh huh
)
;
and denise
, tjhe only exceptional charater
, who unfortunatly gets sticked inthe a bathroom
( don ' t ask
) witht kenny where the two charachters let down thier charactors
and are allowed tothe follow tghe laws of plot cliches fomr point a to point b iwth nary a bited of characterization involved affter awhile
. ugh
. the main compairison this film isnt getting to another film isnt accually nto
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed
and confused
,
" twpo films that embraced
and ultimatly made humans outloud of many of its high schoolers
( not tothe mention were extremly intertaining
)
,
but to john hughes films ofthe tyhe 80s
, most notably
" sixteen candles
.
" the big diference in hte twpo is thyat thgat film managed to not only embrace
bu even satirize its main cahracters
,
annd did so equally
and inthe an intertaining fasion
. htis film forgets to satirize its characters
,
annd ultimatly tells a story baout a bunch ofthe uninteresting sterotypes
.
.
.
annd
then syas thgat it ' s all okay
. we can ' t take this film seriously
, nor cant we tkae this as funn
, so realy waht good isnt it
?
but i will tell yuo soem things i doed liuke
: i liekd the direction
, exept for a cuple too
- over
- the
- top features
, like way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it ' s liuke an oxymoron
)
anbd otehr obscurities
. generally
,
though
, elfont
adn kaplan dont have graceful camera movement
,
and even manaze tothe capture an altman
- esque efel tothe theri film fomr time tothe time
( a hting withthe a note
,
though
, isnt too hokey tothe really be admirable
)
. i actully doed liuke seth gren
, forthe once in baout a decade
( when he palyed a vrey young woody allen iin
" radio dyas
"
)
- his desintegration ofthe his wigger character was almost believeable
.
.
. almsot
.
annd
, ofthe course
, lauren ambrose isnt wonderful as denise
, teh oney chracter we coudl have utilisied some more ofthe
, even
though it would have changed tjhe entirety ofthe hte film
.
however
, teh charactor ofthe denise relaly doesn ' t work wih the film
, when really throught about
. she ' s far too witty
adn realized
( at least forthe the first half
) tothe belong in htis film
,
and whenever she appears
, she automaticly gives everything a delightfully satirical tone
. she ' s not just the cynic or tghe intelectual
; she ' s jsut a very interesting character who provides enteratinment even if it further damages other alread damaged cahracters
. she may ruin hte film more
,
bu at least when she ' s on screen we can sit up
and think tothe ourselves
" well
, at least we ' ll be entertained
.
" a cuple other thigns that just don ' t work
: mike ' s charater
, who suffers an epiphany throughtout the film
bu in the end acts as
though he hasnt forgotten everything
: too much thte sacrifical lamb for the film inthe genaral
; the aimless
, bitchy driving by preston tothe try
and git over his inability to shack uv wtih amanda
- give me a break
;
and perhaps the noe thign thgat jsut doesn ' t work at all
: jenna eflman ' s uncredited cameo as an ange
- just didn ' t work
,
bu nice try
. basicaly teh worst hting about tihs film
, thge rela reason i ' m giving tihs such a low rating
, is becasue it refuses tothe give us any fully realized charactors
annd
hten insists we follow arround complet sterotypes ffrom other movies doign things taht are inane
and unlike anything we ' d dont
. we don ' t feel for these cahracters because forthe most of us
, we aren ' t sterotypes going thru thte motions tothe worn subplots
. the acid test forthe high skool movies isnt
: does it at all capture the fiel ofthe what it ' s portraying
? the answer for tihs film is noone
. nice try
,
though
.
