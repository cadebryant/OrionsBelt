hte most intresting part ofthe
" cin
' t hardly wait
" jstu happens tothe be not onyl tje most human
, bu forthe many of us
, the oen part thgat many ofthe us can easily relate to
. that isnt hte charcter ofthe denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, the film
' s sole sarcastic memeber who mocks everything that goes on in the film
,
and at one point sits down on a couch annd looks totally bored
. the film wisely holds over tihs moment
, nicely showing her alienation in the midst ofthe a large high skool party
.
.
. almost too nicely
. fo soem munbers ofthe the audience
( read
: me
)
, htis isnt basically a mirror ofthe what
' s gonig onthe with them watching this film
. we sit there wondering why we
' ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never feeled the desire to go tothe inthe thte first place
. i woudl actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of htis
. after all
, tihs film is filled wiht a bunch ofthe pathetic sterotypes much of whitch i went to high skool with
. everyone
' s here
: the jock
, tjhe homecoming queen
, tyhe nerd
(
and his dominions of trekkies
and x
- philes
)
, the alienated wannabe writter
, the skool spirit girl
, the pothead
( s
)
, the wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
, anbd weirdly enough tihs film shows them as superficial
, lame
,
and basicaly as a bunch of losers
. exept for denise
, who rolls her eyes at everything
, anbd easily becomes tjhe most likable character even before she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something wich is done for earch main character
, qoutes oscar wilde
- definite pointers ther
)
. unfortunately
, the writers
and directors take severeal major misteps onthe thge way to makeing thsi inot an admirable
and even likable film
. the film
, as i said
, portrays most ofthe its charactors as superficial anbd just totally ignorant to everyting
.
however
, instead ofthe sticking with thsi
, perphas even going a bited further wih it
, htey let thsi lie
,
and atually make these charachters into our heroes
. we follow sevral of them
, all a bunch of moronic sterotypes with only a shread of humanity adn realism
, anbd tries tothe tell boring
and overly melodramatic tales baout them as if we actually cared
and
/ or identified with them
. adn if we doed
, we certainly don
' t want tothe revisit that state of being
. here
' s a quick low
- down
: it
' s graduation
,
and we followup a bunch ofthe seniors onthe hte lsat nigt
, otherwise known as the
" american grafitti
" or
, to a lesser extent
, hte
" dazed
and confuzled
" cliche
. tyhe formall just folowed them as tehy drove aimlessly
; the latter doed a little bit of that
and featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" can
' t hardly wait
" just opts for a big indoor keg party
, adn a littel bited of aimless driving
, albeit ofthe tje i
' m
- whining
- beacuse
- i
- cant
' t
- get
- a
- girl
- i
- want br
and
. we folow many people around
,
but mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, of
" thta thing yuo dont
!
"
)
, the alienated writter
, who
' s been pining over tje homcoming queen
, am
anda
( thte totally overrated jennifer lveo hewitt
)
, for the entirety of high school because he thikns htey shared a moent thier freshman yearm over a freaking pop tart
. now thyat she
' s broken uv with her football palyer boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides tothe go to the party with a note he
' s writed declaring his
" lveo
" forthe her inspite tyhe hopes he
' ll build up teh guts to give it to her
.
.
. even
though he
' s leaving fo a multi
- week intensive writting programe hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut
( okay
: hte ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. since thta plot isnt incredibly lame
and a trcak recrod of whta goes on with it wouldn
' t be able tothe carry a commerical let alone a feature film
,
and because it
' s a party
, htere are smoe moreso main cahracters
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, finaly surfacing aftter
" dick tracy
"
)
, tje nerd
( adn his dominions
) who has come uv witht a rediculous plan to publically sabotage mike
, who
' s humiliated him for years
,
but gets too caught uv iin drinking to do it
; kenny
( seth green
)
, teh wigger
, who hasnt decided that this party iwll be where he iwll finally git laid
( uh huh
)
; anbd denise
, the onyl exceptional character
, who unfortunatly gets sticked inthe a bathroom
( don
' t ask
) with kenny where tje twpo characters let down thier characters
and are allowed tothe folow teh laws ofthe plot cliches from point a tothe point b iwth nary a bit of characterization involved affter awhile
. ugh
. yhe main compairison this film isnt getting tothe anyother film isnt atcually nto
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed
and confused
,
" two films that embraced adn ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers
( not to mention were extrememly entertaining
)
, bu to john hughes films of tghe 80s
, most noteably
" sixteen c
andles
.
" the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not onyl embrace
but even satirize its main characters
, annd doed so equally anbd inthe an entertaining fashon
. htis film forgets to satirize its charachters
, anbd ultimatly tells a tsory about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes
.
.
.
and thne syas thast it
' s all okay
. we can
' t take this film seriously
, nor cxan we take htis as fun
, so really what good isnt it
?
but i wiull tell you some thigsn i doed like
: i liked teh direction
, except fo a cuple too
- over
- the
- top features
, like way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it
' s liuke an oximoron
)
and other obscurities
. generally
,
though
, elfont
and kaplan do hvea graceful camera govement
,
and even manaze tothe capture an altman
- esque feel tothe theri film from time tothe time
( a thing iwth a note
,
though
, is too hokey to realyl be admirable
)
. i actualyl doed like seth gren
, for once inthe baout a decade
( wehn he plyed a vrey young woody allen inthe
" radio days
"
)
- his desintegration ofthe his wigger character ws almost believeable
.
.
. allmost
.
and
, of course
, lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise
, thte oen charater we could hve used smoe more of
, even
though it woudl have changed tghe entirety of yhe film
. howver
, thge chracter of denise relaly doesn
' t owrk witht yhe film
, wehn really throught baout
. she
' s far too witty adn realized
( at least for the frist half
) tothe belong inaddition tihs film
,
and whenever she appears
, she automatically gives everything a delightfully satrical tone
. she
' s not jstu the cynic or thge intelectual
; she
' s jsut a vrey interesting character who provides enteratinment even if it furuther damages other already damaged characters
. she may ruin the film moreso
, bu at least wehn she
' s on screen we can sit uv anbd htink tothe ourselves
" well
, at least we
' ll be entertained
.
" a couple other things that just don
' t owrk
: mike
' s character
, who suffers an epiphany throughtout the film
but iin yhe end acts as
though he has forgotten everything
: too much the sacrifical lamb forthe the film in genaral
; yhe aimless
, bitchy driving by preston tothe try anbd git over his iability to shack up whith am
anda
- give me a break
; annd perhpas the one thing tath just doesn
' t owrk at all
: jenna eflman
' s uncredited cameo as an angal
- just didn
' t work
, bu nice try
. basicly thge worst thing baout this film
, thte rela reason i
' m giving this such a low rating
, isnt beccause it refuses tothe give us any fully realized charactors
and
then insists we follow arround complet sterotypes from other movies donig thigsn thgat are inane
and unlike anything we
' d do
. we don
' t fiel for these characters because for most ofthe us
, we aren
' t stereotypes going thru the motions to worn subplots
. the acid test for high school movies isnt
: doesnt it at all capture the fiel ofthe whta it
' s portraing
? the answer for this film isnt noone
. nice try
,
though
.
