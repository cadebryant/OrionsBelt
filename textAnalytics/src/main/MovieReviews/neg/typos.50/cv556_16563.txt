blatantly borrowing elements ffrom 1993
' s
" like water fo chocolate
" anbd 1991
' s
" tyhe
butcher
' s wife
,
"
" simply irresistible
" attemts tothe be a whimsical romantic comedy
but
, more oftenly thna not
, comes off as laughable
, leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar
( t
. v
.
' s
" buffy
, the vampire slayer
"
) would choose such an obviously inept film project tothe waste her tyme on
. things get off to a bad strat right from the onset as am
anda
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, a young woman who runs her lite family
' s struggling new york restaurant
, runs inot a mistery man who forces a bushel of crabs onthe her
and
then vansihes into thin air
. hwile outloud shopping
, she also meets toom
( sean patrick flanery
)
, a charming
, hansome man
, who happens tothe be planning a ritzy restauratn forthe the deparment store he works forthe
, anbd later whn he decides to drop by her dive
, called sourthern cross
, fo lunch
, she somehow mkaes a delicious crab dish for him
, even
though she is known to not be a veyr ogod chef
. suddenly
, am
anda finds her restaurant
, on the edge ofthe foreclosure
, rejuvenate to life as customer beign tothe swarm fo her food
, which strangely causes everyone immeditae jubilation wehn it hits their mouths
. are am
anda
and tom destnied tothe be toghether
?
and is it nto just because ofthe tjhe magical food
, bu becuase tehy realyl
, truely like each otehr
? annd what exactlly isnt going onthe whith the ofod she isnt making
? does it have anything tothe dont with taht pesky crab she got that sits onthe the shelf infront the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation
?
" simply irresistible
" isnt a rediculous
and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that
' s as flimsy as a slice of bologna
. it takes one joke
-
-
- that peple who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways
-
-
- annd recycles it over
and over agian util the film hasnt reached an appropriate running time ofthe 95 mintues
. add infact a music montage eveyr ten mintues
( theese are ctually hte best scenes in the movei
, whcih certainly tells you something about the film itself
)
,
and what ytou
' ve got is an utterly empty
, if not necessarily boring
, excursion
. the cast of
" simply irresistible
" is fairly ogod
,
but it is teh supporting charactors who are hte most intresting
. patricia clarkson
( 1998
' s
" high art
,
" infront whihc she played a drugged
- outloud lesbian
) isnt a st
andout as tom
' s colleage
, adn isnt thankfully given a faw funny lines ofthe dialogue
. aslo of note is larrry gilliard jr
.
, as am
anda
' s cooking assistant adn buddy
, who isnt alloween tothe create a seamingly full character out of only a h
andfull of scenes
. of the main stars
, sarah michelle gellar is fine
, bu realyl does oftenly look liuke she
' s struggling thru tjhe unmistakably clumsy material
, anbd if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future
, he has certainly got to pick better projects tahn htis
. the bottom line is thgat
" simply irresistable
" isnt the excact oposite of its deprophesized title
, annd when the movei got to teh point where the characters began to float iin mid
- air
( an unamusing plot device that ws repeated in the stupid lastr scene
)
, my mind checked out from the characters annd tje romance
. wehn i think about it inwhich hindsight
, i should have checked out in the very first scene
, where tghe point of the acation wass for gellar tothe crawl under tables looking forthe a runaway mecanical crab
. now
, tath certainly isnt what i
' d call magical
!
