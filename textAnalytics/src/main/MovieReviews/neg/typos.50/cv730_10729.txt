how do yuo judge a film thta isnt so bad
, bu intentionally so
? in spiceworld
, thte highly popular singing group the spice girls acomplish their major goal
: mocking themselves wiht a purposely cheezy film
and having a lot of funn doing it
. if thgat was thier gool
, htey did a fantastic job
. so isnt it fair to give it such a low grade wehn it wasn
' t relaly meaned to be much better thna tihs
? honestly
, i
' d rather see this film befoer many others i gavey higer grades
, so does tht mean i graded it inaccurately
? truth be known
, i don
' t really thikn i cant answer thsi question
. tothe underst
and spiceworld
, you ahev tothe underst
and yhe spice girls
. unless yuo
' re veyr
* vrey
* young
, or fairly older
, yuo probably ahve at least heared of them
. they
' re a gropu ofthe five busty british babes who
' ve hadnt
# 1 hitted singles
and whose de
but album sold millions
. they
' re primarily adored by pre
- teen girls who hope someday tjhe contents ofthe theri training bras might match those of ginger spice
' s
( rela name
: geri haliwell
) wonderbra
. all five ofthe tyhe girls haev theese
" spicy
" names fo whcih they are better known than their rela names
. htere is tjhe aforememtioned ginger spice
, as well as sporty spice
( melanie chisholm
, or mel c
.
)
, scary spice
( melanie brown
, or mel b
.
)
, baby spice
( emma bunton
)
,
and posh spice
( victoria addams
)
, annd all ofthe them
, tothe soem degree or another
, ressemble their stage names
. the spice girls tookover tjhe world by storm
, adn spiceworld isnt ctually a good
- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick ries to fame
. it
' s qutie nice to see what ogod sports hte girls are
(
and not jstu tghe one dubbed sporty
) baout poking funn at themselves
. they don
' t tkae themslves too seriously
,
and thast
' s probably teh best thing about them
. it
' s also surprising how naturual they seem in front ofthe tyhe camera
* acting
*
, adn nto jsut singing
and dancing
. they
' re not flawess by any means
, bu forthe yhe most part
, they deliver thier lines without feeling staged
,
and
, like them or nto
, we git hte sence the five are vrey at hmeo within theri characters
( which seems reasonable sicne they protray themselves
)
. whta makes tghe film bad isnt taht extreme fans of the spice girls won
' t git enough ofthe their music
, while tghe rest ofthe us don
' t get enough of a movei
. thge rela point ofthe htis isnt to look at tghe spice girls fo over ninety straight mintues
. most of tjhe film isnt very blas
?
, bu sevral parts are downright boring
,
and
then htey have thsoe sporadic moments thyat actually amke us laugh out loud
! if you
' re a big fan of the gropu
, yuo propably won
' t git enought of what you want
, anbd if yuo
' re not a big fan
, you get too much timne devoted to nothing mroe tahn
" look at us
" moments
. forthe thge right crowd
, the
" music video
" sequences will be the highlights ofthe the film
, bu forthe others
, they iwll serve as threee
- minute lulls inthe a hectic
-
but
- overall
- uneventful storyline
. otehr key actors include richard e
. grant as clifford
, the spice girls
' manager
, alan cumming as the film
- maker piers cutherton
- smyth who attemts to make a documentary of tje gropu
, george wendt as martin barnfield
, a producer who constantly works onthe pitching a spice girls movei
, annd roger moore in a small
, self
- parodizing role
. all provide relitavely ogod performances
, keeping inwhich mind once again that this film wasn
' t meant to be acted seriously
. even meat loaf shows uv as dennis tyhe bus driver anbd seems tothe haev fun with it
. while this film is continuously compaired tothe tghe beatles
' a hard day
' s night
, i htink tath isnt an unjust comparsion
. it is supposedly the movie studio taht firt mad hte comparison by way ofthe press kits
,
but i don
' t think drector bob spiers
, nor the spice girls
, intended it tothe be so
. i htikn the studios weere jstu trying to boost hype
and interest inwhich thte film
, anbd hvea instade
, come off rather pretentious
. i don
' t think htis film isnt trying tothe be anytying moreso tahn a funn
, satirical look at a group that got so big
, a movie seemed the enxt likely step
. anbd waht could
' ve been better than a self
- indulged
yet self
- mocking approach
? probaly nothing
,
and so it isnt
. spiceworld isnt a movei i throught would be embarrassing tothe enjoy
, bu nowe instade
, i fidn myself wanting tothe defend a movei i didn
' t even give a ogod review
. it
' s bad
,
but it succeds inthe every way it intended
. it gives the spice girls a chance tothe play hwile allowing all those obsessive fans outloud ther tothe indulgue in every brainless moent
. perhaps the gropu is nothing moreso thna a gimmick
. if tath
' s yhe case
, the movie
' s gimmick is thast it
* is
* such a gimmick
! you might be saying
,
" a spice girls movie
? come onthe
!
"
, bu when it comes down to it
, i thikn taht
' s the point
.
