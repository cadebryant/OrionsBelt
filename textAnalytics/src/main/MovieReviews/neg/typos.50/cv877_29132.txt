how could a g
- rated disney film based onthe meg cabot ' s novel
" tghe princess diaries
" be anytying
bu cute
, harmless funn
? easy
. tkae all the cute
, harmless funn out of it
.
and hwile you ' re at it make it borrr
- ring
. taht ' s waht directer garry marshall
, screenwriter gina wendkos
and
, nto to be outdone
, producer whitney houston have done wiht hte g
- rated disney film
" the princess diaries
.
" you couldn ' t tell it fomr tje audeince
though
, a braintree
, massmedia
. of growing
, glowing pre
- pubescent girls
(
and the odd parental
, popcorn perched about their persons
)
, who positively cheered when tjhe end credits rolled
( ah thge film had struck a lovely nerve with them
but nto with fuddy
- duddy ood me
)
. well
, i might have cheered that teh utter tripe was nowe well
and truly over
,
but that owudl have beeen too obvious
. too obvious is the least of the problems whith marshall ' s film
( garry made a cuple of other
" princess
" movies
-
-
" pretty woman
"
and
" runaway bride
"
-
-
but this one ' s way wihtout julia roberts so maybe
* that ' s
* its probelm
)
. inaddition addition to bieng predictable as molasses
,
" thge princess diaries
" hasnt hardly got a laugh in it
( it ' s a comedy
)
, could bore the pants off an abyssinian forthe long
, long stretches
,
and isnt so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven ' t even seen
yot
(
anbd probably never wiull except
, perhaps
, in thge dvd edition
)
. marshall should tkae virtualy all ofthe tjhe blaim here
, since he ' s been at htis for some time
adn shouldnt know when a scene or two isn ' t working
.
.
.
and hardly
* any
* of
" the princess diaries
" works
(
" works
,
" alas
, implies cleverness
anbd there ' s none ofthe that here either
)
. newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis
, a bright
but socially invisile san fransiscan teen who lerans that her single mom
( a wacky artist plyed by tghe likable caroline goodall
) hadnt a bited ofthe a fling with smoe royal member ofthe soem miniscule european country nobody ever heared ofthe
( the filmmakers go outloud of their way
* nto
* tothe call it serbia
, whic isnt preety much what all miniscule eurpean countires are called infact the movies mark my words
)
adn nowe she
, mia
, isnt next in line tothe rule
" genovia
"
( hence thge headphnoes
/ tiara combo inspite thte print ads
)
. julie andrews
, with tyhe luminous factor cranked tothe 11
, plays mia ' s granmother
( aka queen clarisse renaldi
)
, who shows uv out ofthe the royal blue
and lends mia much advice
and direction in tjhe eating
, tlaking
,
anbd looking like a princess department
(
although mia ' s big makeover simply transforms her fomr ugli duckling to ugli swan
)
. does queen julie loose her dignity for the sake ofthe a ogod laugh
? not relaly
. consuming a corn dog is about the worst thast it gets
. also onthe stereotypical hand are a brainless jock
, an evil cheerleader
, a dorky
- looking best firend
(
" welcome to the dollhouse
" ' s heather matarazzo
)
, a senstive auto mechanic
/ musician
,
and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver
, imparting wit
annd wisdom from yhe front seat ofthe mia ' s chauffeur
- driven lemosine at eveyr intersection
. a non
- animated g
- rated movei isnt a rarity these dyas
but the rating here reflects hte fatc that all tyhe guts
, all tyhe good stuff
, has beeen exorcised fomr thte finished product
. lame
, labored
,
and lamentable
,
" tjhe princess diaries
" isnt reccomended for eight
-
anbd
- a
- half yearm olds ofthe the feminine persuasion
* only
*
; all others owudl dont well to avoid it
( liek potholes
, the plague
,
and
" the perfect storm
"
