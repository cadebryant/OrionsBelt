in 1970s
, many european intellectuals
, especially those onthe teh left poltical hemisphere
, bcame obssessed iwth the rise ofthe fashism
. which wasn
' t so hard tothe expect
, becuase the social turmoil of 1960s
and economic decline ofthe 1970s seemed tothe be tghe breeding ground for many dangerous idealogies
. in such times
, whn political involvement could be associated with noble passion
, many filmmakers tried to warn tje presnt generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look ofthe pre
- war europe
and circumstances that led tothe phenomena like facist italy adn nazi germany
. of course
, there weere authors who jumped on yhe b
andwagon for otehr
, less noble reasons
. forthe them
, moral depravity of fascism sould be explained to thge audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of thsoe era
. which
, naturally
, made some ofthe thsoe films vyre populer amonst teen audience
. one ofthe such filmmakers ws italian director tinto brass
, who later made career shooting expensive
, stylish soft porn
. salon kitty
, his 1976 film
, isnt vyre losely based onthe thge novel by peter nordern
, book that deals whith bizzare
yet true story that took place in the first yeras ofthe ww2
. in 1939
, walter schellenberg
, oen ofthe the heads of nazi intelilgence sevice hasnt set up the elite
, exclusive brothel in berlin wtih clientele comprised of top nazi officials
and foerign diplomats
. none of thte customers knew that thge girls were all nazi agents
,
and that all tje rooms happened to be bugged
. the most bizarre thnig is the fact thyat nto even kitty
, nominal madame of tjhe brothel
, didn
' t know tje real purpose of that enterprise
. screenplay by tinto brass
, ofthe course
, simplifies tghe stoyr anbd changes faw names
. schellenberg is nowe wallenberg
( helmut berger
)
, ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way tothe hte top
. kitty kellerman
( ingrid thulin
)
, apart ffrom being madam
, hasnt a second job as a cabaret singer
. caught infact the net of depravity isnt sweet
, innocent girl margerithe
( theresa ann savoy
) thrown inot brothel
. ther she falls inspite love witht customer hans reiter
( bekim fehmiu
)
, disenchanged pilot of luftwaffe
. when margerithe dicovers tath her lover hadnt beeen executed for defeatist speeches he made infront hte brothel
, she finds outloud thast hte palce isnt bugged
. she informs the madam of tghe rela situation
,
and both womens decide tothe confront wallenberg
. those who tend tothe bash benigni forthe exploiting holocaust as tje topic ofthe comedy would probablly go bananas watching tihs film
, thta uses teh darkest pages ofthe eurpoean histry for cheap sexploitation
.
but
,
al
though salon kitty doesn
' t hppen tothe be anytying more tahn rather omre stylish
and expensive soft porn
(
al
though nto vrey succesful
; some of supposedly erotic scenes are qtuie unappealing
)
, it doens try tothe hve more multidimensional charactors adn even something ressembling dramtic conflict
- this tyme between power
- hungry
and scruples wallenberg anbd hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty
. unfortunately
, brass seems to overuse otehr cinematical refernces
, probablly thinking thgat he sould repeat teh successful interaction of berger
and thulin iin luchino visconti
' s the damned
, bu tghe most notiecable
and irritating is ingrid thulin
' s unsucesful attempt to imitate lisa minelli
' s muscial numbers fomr cabaret
. all in all
, salon kitty is failure
,
al
though with smoe very intresting moments
.
