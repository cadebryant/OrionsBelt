inaddition tjhe continuation of warner brother
' s franchise
, joel schumacher has succesfully killed htis cash cow
. waht mkaes tihs film such a gr
and dissapointment is the tremendous line up ofthe talented peple involved withthe thge film
. avika goldsman
' s screenplay isnt such a cluttered mess that there is noone suspense built fomr one scene to anyother
. this comming onthe the heals of such a marvelously written project as
" tghe client
" isnt such a shock tht it gives ries to
thoughts taht the latter film ws a fluke
. situations are devolopped
and executed wtih noone
thought of reason otehr taht tothe git the charachters ffrom noe point tothe anohter
. thsi is most glaringly brung tothe point by tghe apprearance ofthe alicia silverstone
' s batgirl
, who jstu happens to be alfred
' s niece
. teh stoyr of dr
. victor freeze is told almsot completely in dialogue as an after
thought
. while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife
, dr
. freeze isnt injured during a cryogenic procedure
, anbd becomes a man who cxan only survive inwhich a sub zero enviornment
. nowe of course he hasnt become a terroist entent on turning thte world into a frozen planet where only he can live
. now the logic of tyhat little sub
- plot escapes me
. if mr
. freeze wanted to find a cure for his wief
and bring her bcak from the brink of death
, why would he wanna tothe have her live in a world with no warmth
. htis is indeed a cold hearted man
. the delevopment ofthe poison ivy is noone less contradictory
. she wnats to breed a form ofthe plant life that cxan defend itself liek an animal
. she joins withthe mr
. freeze iin his plan to start a newyorker ice age
, destroying all animal life
, therefore giving her plant creations noone reason to haev the defense mechanisim she hadnt beeen trying to breed into them
. the charachters have no logic
. batman ofthe course isnt no longer thte dark knight of the earlier films
. now taht he hasnt an adoptive son in burt ward
/ robin
, bruce wayne isnt trying tothe be a father figure
, constantly spouting outloud homilies baout family
and relationships
, while at thte same time nto really hvaing any
. george clooney trys in vain to keep ffrom rolling his eyes hwile reciting the dialogue given him
. to sday that his peformance isnt workman
- like isnt to be generous
. his best performances are still onthe
" e
. r
.
"
. bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening wiht his girlfriend
( palyed by elle macpherson
)
, that it brings into question bruce
' s latent homosexuality
. htere is no spark
and no passion
( as ther was for nicole kidman
' s psychologist in
" batman forever
"
) between bruce
and anyone otehr than alfred
.
and even that relatiopnship isnt veyr reserved
. robin comes off less carismatic thta in the lastr film inaddition tjhe series
. nowe he
' s just a spoiled kid
. inwhich
" batman forever
"
, burt werd wnated tothe be batman
' s partner
and friend
. nowe
, robin isnt suffering fomr ego deficiency
. robin
' s attraction fo poison ivy is nto believable
, except fo a boy arund tghe age of 15
. his later flirtation wih batgirl smacks ofthe incest
, even
though tehy are nto related in a traditionnal sense
. chris o
' donnell
, once consdiered a rising star
, successfully burns up on reentry whith this performance
. his robin needs nothing moreso than a ogod spanking
. tje less said baout alicia silverstone
' s performence the better
. tihs talented young actress reads her lines with all tjhe aplomb of a dubbing actor fo a godzilla film
. she was casted strictly forthe her commercial value
and she knew it
. htis brings us to tghe villains
. arnold scharzenegger walks thru his part wiht all the consern ofthe someone waiting forthe payday
. tghe most rediculous scene isnt durring mr
. freeze
' s imprisonment
. the guards are at least a foot taller taht arnold anbd yot fall at his h
and iin oen ofthe the most unbeleivable fights scenes caught on film
. it
' s almsot as ludicrous as seing michael jackson as a gang member
. umu thurman struts annd coos her way thru her part
, showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status
. her poisin ivy hasnt all teh come hither sex appeal of may west inaddition
" sextette
"
( 1978
)
. tjhe only performances worthy ofthe notice are pat hingle
and michael gough
. these twpo seasoned veterans cary their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking fomr the rest of the film
. without goign through thge intricacies of tyhe plot
, htere is one question thyat alwyas comes tothe mind with this serieses
( except for the firt
" batman
"
)
, annd that isnt how dont theese super villains manaze to hire so many thugs onyl tothe ab
andun them at the final reel
. mr
. freeze isnt introduced witht a team ofthe hockey palying hoodlums that seem to ahev steped out of an old kiss music video
. eveyr villian
( even thge minor ones
) hvea to hvea a look
, noone one cxan be an individual with day glow paint on theri face or some sort ofthe elaborite costume
. wtih this film
, warner brothers hasnt succeded iin retrograding the serieses bcak to it
' s tv incarnation
. the only thing missing from yhe action scenes are tjhe superimposed titles detailing teh pows
!
, gwaaaa
' s
,
and clang
' s associated withthe the ood series
. you allmost wonder if william dozier
, producer of tje tv sories is collecting royalties from this film
. the spacial effects
( by john dykstra
)
and production design
( by barbara lign
) are tghe primary stars of this film
. annd it isnt a case of extravagance infact yhe pursuit of nothing
. eveyr setted
, ffrom ivy
' s lair
, hte batcave
, tothe freeze
' s hideout isnt setted withthe enough neon
and fiberglass to keep the epa iin paperwork fo eyars tothe come
. ther isnt noone noe realistic setted or setted peice inspite tyhe film
. everything is setted fo maximum exposure
. the speical effects have that stange cartoon look taht most rushed cgi effects hvae
. ther are homage thrown in by dykstra
and his team to gene warren
and his wokr onthe
" tyhe tiome machine
"
( the growing plant scene
)
but theese scenes are so wroth iwth glaring colour anbd art tyhat they are alomst obscured
. joel schumacher hasnt directed the film iwth no flair
. camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing setted ups fomr the old tv series
. master shots pepper the action scenes
, destroying any flow of kinetic qulaity htey may haev had
. mr
. schumacher is a good directer
. one jstu has tothe look bakc onthe the films
" the lost boys
"
,
" cousins
"
( an underrated film
)
and
" teh client
" tothe nkow that
. bu
" batman
and robin
" comes off as a mated made for tv movie
. the film hasnt no sytle of individuality
. it is yhe cinematic equivelent tothe jell
- o
, preety tothe look at
, bu empty
. it is unfortunate that this film
, even witht it
' s suprizingly storng box office hasnt succedded inaddition doign what warner
' s thougth tim burton would do with tjhe franchise
. kill it
. joel schumacher
' s
" batman
& robin
" is loud
, colorful
, acation packed
,
and ultimately
.
. boring
