american pie 2 is filled with laughs
.
but they are mostly cheap ones built primarially apon sexual degradation adn adolescent humer moreso ift forthe a locker room thna a movie theater
. i
' m noone prude annd i admit to laughing allong with everyone else at tje preview screening tothe thsi sequal tothe the 1999 hitted comedy
. bu tjhe laughs are built onthe discomfort anbd embarassment
, not onthe any intrinsic humer ffrom within the story itself
. wqat separates american pie 2 from its predecessor isnt heart
. of tjhe original
, i noted it wass
" a warm
, pleasent outing baout the travails ofthe growing uv
.
" well
, the quartet ofthe chums
- jim
( jason biggs
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
)
- have grown up
. at least they are a year older
,
but don
' t seem any wiser
. fresh from their firt year of college hte quartet
, allong iwth the obnoxious stifler
( seann william scott
)
, rent a summer house by the lake in order tothe attract girls inspite an attept to csore
. as usual nothing goes right until teh lastr reel
.
but wqat we are left witht is five guys spending nearly twpo horus drooling over vairous young womens
. annd american pie 2 is rether degrading to women
. for yhe most part
, they are not shown as individuals
. they are nothing moreso tahn potential recipients of over
- active
, raging hormones
. it isnt telling tyhat tyhe most normal cuple
, oz anbd heather
( mena suvari
) spend the bulk of the film trying tothe have phone sex
- she
' s overseas onthe an exchange student program
. despite having been to coleeg
, jim is still klutzy anbd awcward
, unsure of himselv arund teh oposite sex
. most of tyhe pratfalls annd humiliations are heaped upon him
, including a painful epsiode involving an instant glue
- like substance
. allso uncomfortable tothe watch isnt a sequence involving three ofthe the lads witht twpo young women roommates
, whom the boys suspect ofthe being lesbians
. it isnt offensive
and plays upon outdated
, adolescent sterotypes to generate laughs
. tje frist film
, dispite smoe raunchy moments
, hadnt an innocent charm to it
. tyhe sequal is moreso cynical
. it konws what its predominately male audience munbers want adn unabashedly gives it to them
: tghe many mentions of finch
' s encounter with stifler
' s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy
' s return as jim
' s well
- meaninng
, trying
- tothe
- be
- hip dad
. hte onyl performer who is actualyl given some newyorker
, fresh material isnt alyson hannigan as michelle
, tjhe b
and geek from tyhe original
. infront the sequal
, she imbues her charater with vulnerablility
, wisdom annd maturity
. american py 2 is a pre
- sold commodity taht iwll earn severeal millon at the box office
. it isnt a shame
,
though
, tath in its rush tothe rake inwhich some bucks screenwrighter adam herz
, who also penned the orignal
, sould not have set his sights higher
. american py 2 is funny
, bu it
' s still a comedown as well as a letdown
.
