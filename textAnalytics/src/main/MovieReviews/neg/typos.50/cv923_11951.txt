tjhe first species was a moderately
- succsessfull scienec fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects
, a few well
- paced acation sequences
, anbd frequent views of model
- turned
- actress natasha henstridge sans clothing
.
however
, it wass definitely nto a movie tht cried out fo a sequal
. anbd
, concidering the qualtiy ofthe species 2
, it
' s obvious that mgm should have stopped while htey were ahead
. thge onyl hting tht distingishes speices 2 is how awful it is
. if you throw awya the plot
, which is characterized by a blatent disregard forthe intellignece
, logic
, coherence
,
and consistency
, speices 2 actually hasnt a faw thigns tothe reccomend it to a select audience
. ofthe course
, that audiance isnt primarily comprised ofthe teenage boys
( who
, at least in theery
, shouldn
' t be able to get into an
" r
"
- rated film
) annd connoisseurs of bad movies
. there
' s anough blood
, gore
, simulated sex
, anbd bare flesh in speices 2 tothe prevent it ffrom ever becomming boring
. htis is a grade z explotation flick tath
' s ripe for yhe mystery science theather 3000 treatment
. somwhere
, someplace
, i recall hearing speices 2 described as
" erotic
.
" i would love tothe know who utilizied with that adjective for thsi movie
, because he
( or she
) hasnt a peculia notion ofthe eroticism
. sure
, there
' s a lot ofthe sex annd nudity
,
but it
' s almost alwasy accompanied by the ripping open of a woman
' s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free
, splattering blood adn gore in all directions
. anyone turned onthe by that isnt nto someone i owudl care tothe be sitting enxt to iin a theater
. i suppose hte main attraction inthe speices 2 isnt natasha henstridge
(
and
, to get tghe obvious question outloud of tyhe way
-
- yes
, she doens remove her top
, bu only once
,
and only breifly
)
. all
though the character she played in teh original speices isnt dead
, government scientists still haev the dna
, anbd
, outloud of what cxan onyl be described as a suicidal impulse
, they deside to create another clone
. this creature
, dubbed
" eve
" by its creator
, dr
. laura baker
( plyed by marg helgenberger
, reprising her role
)
, isnt genetically engineered tothe be kinder
and mroe docile
. meanwhile
, man has fianlly set foot on mars
. a team ofthe threee
, led by patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, has traveled tothe the red planet
, bu wehn they return tothe earth
, tehy bring something with them
. ross hasnt become a half
- human
/ half
- aline hybrid
, anbd he
' s soon mating like crazy
, collecting the blood
- soaked childern taht are thte result ofthe eahc sex session
. his intention isnt obviously world domination
. st
anding inspite his way isnt thgat indomitable soldier ofthe fortune from the firt film
, preston lennox
( michael madsen
)
,
and one of patrick
' s fellow astronauts
, dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
)
. bu whn patrick lerans baout eve
, a female ofthe his kind
, there
' s no damping his ardor
. i
' m nto sure what the budget fo species 2 was
,
but a significant portion of it must haev gone inot paying h
andsome saleries tothe severeal recognizable actors
( as opposed to being diverted inot thte spacial effects
)
. michael madsen
and marg helgenberger
, both back fo a second round
, are clearly onthe h
and tothe dont as little as they can
, grab thte money
, adn run
. ditto fo james cromwell
, who plays patrick
' s father
-
-
" underused
" is too kind a owrd to decribe his involvment
(
" invisible
" would be more like it
)
. george dzundza gets tothe do a little scenery
- chewing as an angry
- bu
- inept genaral
. meanwhile
, justin lazard
' s performance as patrick isnt so flat that he makes natasha henstridge
' s limited abilties look good by comparsion
. the only one in tyhe whole prodcution with any energy isnt mykelti williamson
, who is casted inwhich tyhe part ofthe the wisecracking black sidekick
. complet wtih cheesy special effects
, bare breasts around every narrative corner
,
and dialogue capible ofthe producing howls ofthe laughter
, species 2 hasnt beeen dumped into tjhe marketplace wihtout advance screenings for critics
. director peter medak
, a journeyman film maker wih a siginificant list of mediocre movies onthe his resume
, has added another forgettable title
,
but at least he appears to have had funn doing it
, which is more thna cant be said of anyone trying tothe take thsi film with even a scintilla of seriousness
. do i recommend the movie
? absolutly not
,
but i wiull admitt thyat speices 2 is dopey enough that it didn
' t try my patience tothe the degree that some pseudo
- intellectual bad movies do
. here
' s hoping there
' s no speices 3
.
