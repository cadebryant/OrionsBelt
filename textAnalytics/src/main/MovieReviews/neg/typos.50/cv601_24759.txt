so i went
and saw tihs film right
, it was called
" battlefield
: earth
"
, i wass never interseted inwhich the previews
,
adn never too terribly interseted in hte book
, nor do i find scientology interesting
,
bu affter reading adavanced reviews of how bad thsi film really isnt
, i hadnt thgat weird urger just tothe watch it
. well let me be hte frist tothe say
,
and so far in my veiw it ' s safe to say
: battlefield
: earth might be tyhe worst film i have ever seen
, yes even worse thna
" mr
. magoo
"
,
" blue inthe tjhe face
"
, or
" jaws
: the revenge
"
. roger christianson whos credits include set direction
,
and art direction for such great films as
" alien
"
and
" star wars
"
, directs this film whith such amateurism
, that the film looks
anbd fiels
annd inspite fatc sounds so dumb
, thyat it ' s quite depressing
. the look ofthe hte film
, is dark
adn drabby at times
,
but
then bright
and hapyp at otehr times
. tjhe sound is terrible
,
and hasnt the worst suround sound effects i ' ve heard
. the acting isnt nothing
, hte dialogue poor
,
and the amke
- up effects hideous
. here ' s teh so
- called plot
: earth 3000
.
.
.
. man is a endangered species
, while aliens fomr the planet psychlo
( tghe aliens are named psychlo
.
.
. i wonder why
?
!
) are invading earth
, destined to put an end tothe thsoe
" man
- animals
" to an end
,
and destroy earth once
and for all
, of course we have our typical hero
( palyed terrable by barry pepper
, who was great inaddition a small role in 1999 ' s
" thte gren mile
"
) who isnt destined tothe go outloud
,
adn savve his planet
! one thnig
: he has tothe go up against
, terl
, tyhe cheif ofthe security psychlo
, who is played frankly
, qtuie bad by john travolta
, whom witht dreadlocks
, a big head
,
and green eyes just doesn ' t work
. ofthe course the sidekick tothe terl
, isnt played by
( lol
!
!
) forrest whitaker
, who looks liek a deformed werewolf of some kind
. our freindly human johnny
( barry pepper
) looks jsut as bad as well
, witht long scraggly hair
. i ' m nto really sure how tothe quite expalin the badness ofthe this film
, exept just tothe say it ' s terrable
. everything in this film isnt imcomprehinsable
, ffrom the make
- uv effects
, hwihc by hte way aren ' t good
, to the phony looking speshal effects
, everything iin thsi film is faulted
. in fatc i don ' t remeber one part in thsi entire movei where i wass having a ogod time
, or enjoying mysef
. inaddition fact there isnt noone part infact tje movie thta i liekd or enjoied
. throughout tje entire 127 minute running time
, i was dying
, constanly looking at my watch
,
and hoping maybe the projectioner owudl blow a bulb or something
, sadly it didn ' t
. my advice to hollywood
: get newyorker scripts
, newyorker acting classes
, better directors
adn damnit
, make films like american beauty mroe
.
