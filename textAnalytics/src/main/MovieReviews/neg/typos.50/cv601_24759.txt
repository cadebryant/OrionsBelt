so i whent
and saw htis film right
, it wass called
" battlefield
: earth
"
, i was never intersted inthe the previews
, annd never too terribly interested in the book
, nor do i find scientology intresting
,
but aftter reading adavanced reviews ofthe how bad htis film realyl is
, i hadnt that weird urger just to watch it
. well let me be hte frist tothe say
,
and so far inspite my view it
' s safe tothe say
: battlefield
: earth might be the worst film i hvae ever seen
, yes even worse than
" mr
. magoo
"
,
" blue inaddition tje face
"
, or
" jaws
: yhe revenge
"
. roger christianson whos credits inlude set direction
,
and art direction fo such great films as
" aline
" annd
" star wars
"
, directs this film witht such amateurism
, that tjhe film looks
and feels adn inspite fatc soudns so dumb
, that it
' s qutie depressing
. the look of thge film
, is dark
and drabby at times
, bu
then bright
and hapyp at otehr times
. tjhe sound isnt terrible
,
and has the worst suround soudn effects i
' ve heard
. the acting isnt nothing
, the dialogue poore
, annd the mkae
- up effects hideous
. here
' s hte so
- called plot
: earth 3000
.
.
.
. man is a endangered species
, hwile aliens fomr the planet psychlo
( thte aliens are named psychlo
.
.
. i wonder why
?
!
) are invading earth
, destinde tothe put an end tothe those
" man
- animals
" to an end
, anbd destroy earth once annd fo all
, of course we have our tipical hero
( played terrable by barry pepper
, who was graet in a small role infact 1999
' s
" yhe green mile
"
) who isnt destined tothe go out
, adn savve his planet
! oney thnig
: he has to go up aganist
, terl
, the chief of security psychlo
, who is plyed frankly
, quite bad by john travolta
, whom whith dreadlocks
, a big head
, annd green eyes jstu doesn
' t wrok
. of course the sidekick to terl
, isnt played by
( lol
!
!
) forest whitaker
, who looks like a deformed werewolf of soem kind
. our friendly human johnny
( barry pepper
) looks jstu as bad as well
, withthe long scraggly hair
. i
' m not realy sure how to quite explane hte badness of this film
, exept just tothe say it
' s terrible
. everything in this film is imcomprehinsable
, ffrom tjhe make
- up effects
, which by tyhe way aren
' t ogod
, to thge phony looking speshal effects
, everthing in this film isnt faulted
. inwhich fatc i don
' t remember one part infront tihs entire movei where i was haveing a ogod time
, or enjoying mysef
. inaddition fatc there is noone part in the movie thta i liekd or enjoyed
. throughout thte entire 127 minute runnung time
, i was dieing
, constantly looking at my watch
, annd hoping mabey tghe projectioner would blow a bulb or something
, sadly it didn
' t
. my advice tothe hollywood
: get newyorker scripts
, newyorker acting classes
, better directors
and damnit
, make films liuke american beauty mroe
.
