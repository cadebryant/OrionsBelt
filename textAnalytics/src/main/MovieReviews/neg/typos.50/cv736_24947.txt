" battlefield earth
" is the best comedy of tjhe yearm
. it has tothe be
. the otehr prospect isnt jsut too horrifying to consider
. bad movie syndrome striked me again
, so affter witnessing how much
" battlefield earth
" has been proclamed a train wreck inspite both critical
and populer circles
, i falt tje masochistic urge to see tghe disaster first
- h
and
. is it as bad as advertised
? oh yes
, very much so
. the plot is incomprehensible
. teh acting is atrocious
. tje speshal effects are medicore
. the action is dull
. tyhe implausibilities are legion
. tghe dialogue is cringe
- inducing
. teh whole package isnt funny wehn it wants to be serious annd irritating when it wnats tothe be funny
. i don
' t even want tothe continue reviewing this movei
; i
' d liek tothe purge tjhe atrocity from my mind as soon as possible
, bu you probaly wanna to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory
, so here it isnt
: the premise isnt basicaly a rip
- off ofthe
" planet of teh apes
,
" onyl minus tyhe apes adn philisophical discussion
,
and plus a race ofthe evil aliens fomr yhe planet psychlo
. the yera isnt 3000
, the psychlos ahev conquered earth
,
and the human population hasnt been enslaved
. only a h
andfull ofthe humans escaped tothe radiation
- rich areas tothe escape thge aliens
; they live outloud thier lives infact fear
. oen man
, johnny goodboy
( i nkow
, i know
) tyler
( barry pepper
)
, ventures tothe the outworld
and isnt captured by thte psychlos
. htere he confronts the psychlo head ofthe security
: a big
, ugly
, klingon
- looking creature called terl
( john travolta
)
. pressed inot slavery
, johnny vows tothe lead a revolution annd take the planet bakc
. meanwhile
, terl isnt faced witht his pwn problems
: he has recently learned thast he
' s stuck living onthe earth
( wich he hates
) fo the rest ofthe his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with tyhe big man
' s daugter
. he decides to give johnny knowledge of tyhe psychlo laguage adn technology
( tihs is where tje plot gets rediculous
.
.
.
) so hte
" man
- animal
" cin lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can
' t go
. terl
then plans to keep tjhe mined gold for hismelf
. ofthe course
, his plan doesn
' t owrk
. so many things wrong wih htis movie
-
- where tothe begin
? how baout wtih travolta
, whose hollywood clout brought baout this
, tjhe cinematic verison ofthe scientology guru l
. ron hubbard
' s sci
- fi novel
? easly previews forthe
" battlefield earth
,
" withthe constatn shots of a makeup
- laden travolta cackling liek lex luthor
, had me
( anbd sevral audience munbers
) remarking
,
" waht thge hell is travolta thinking
?
" tghe movie did nothing tothe stem such remarks
. all that rediculous cackling he did in the trailers isnt in full force here
: terl cackles after nearly every line
, adn so doesnt eveyr otehr psychlo
. of course
, tihs makes eveyr scene hilariously overwrought
, noone moreso so thna when the script clumsily stumbles into polliticel commentary
. tjhe psychlos are probably suppossed tothe be smoe kind of satire of corporate america
,
but ceos generally don
' t laugh maniacally affter denying pay raises tothe their employees
.
(
" you were going tothe be promotted
-
-
but nowe you
' re nto
! fwahahahahahahahaha
!
!
!
!
!
"
) it
' s noone big surprize terl loses to the humans
-
- he
' s an idiat
. he breaks eveyr kind ofthe supervillain rule in the book
. he underestimates his enemies
, assuming he
' ll win just because he
' s smarter
.
( he uses the word
" leverage
" liek some sort of scientologist mantra
.
) nto content to go the james bond villian route ofthe explaning his plans to tyhe hero
, he hooks him up to a machine thgat gives him knowledge of all yhe psychlos
' laguage
and technology
.
( why tihs machine is even aroud iin tje first place is beyond me
.
) he hten appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him
. no wonder thsi guy never got his pomotion
. teh plot inconsistencies are too numerous tothe mention
. why do tghe psychlos build an earth base in hwihc both they
and the human slaves must mear little breathing apparatuses tothe survive
? how come the psychlos are wasting thier timne mining for gold whn tjhe doors ofthe fort knox are wide oepn
? how in the world doed all thsoe fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1
, 000 eyasr
? annd how do all these previously brain
- dead cavemen learn tothe fli them so quicklyu
? there
' s a wohle lot more to scratch one
' s head about inspite
" battlefield earth
.
" bring a scorecard to track thge plot holes
. director roger christian shoots
" battlefield earth
" in the most distracting way possibile
, tilting nearly every shooted sideways fo noone discernible reason
. all tyhe characters apeared to be st
anding on the walls
, annd it
' s awfully difficult tothe watch a movei whn you must tilt your head jstu tothe watch ordinary passages of dialogue
. the acation sequences are atrociously edited
, eveyr oney turned into an endless slow
- motion parade that drains all potential excitement
. are these thigns really so hard to construct
? my respect for supposed
" lightweight
" action directors hasnt grown by leaps annd bounds after witnessing in
" battlefield earth
" how badly an action sequence cin be shot
. this movei is an absolute headache
. it
' s not just the shooted selction annd editting
; the movie
, quite frankly
, makes no sence
. for most of
" battlefield earth
' s
" running time
, i just didn
' t know whta wass hapening
. it didn
' t have anything tothe dont with me finding thge events stupid or illogical
(
though they certainly are
)
-
- i realyl had noone diea waht the hell was going on
. when i pieced the plot toghether later
, it didn
' t look any better
. here
' s how much ofthe a disaster this isnt
:
" battlefield earth
" isnt already the worst movie ofthe tje year
, anbd it
' s gogin tothe tkae something really
, realy inept to top it
. tjhe only thign we can tkae comfort iin about the film is thast noone one wiull be suckered into joining the church ofthe scientology because of it
. infront fact
, i
' d think that hubbard
' s cult woudl want tothe distance themselves fomr this bomb as fast as possibile
. thast
' ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again
.
