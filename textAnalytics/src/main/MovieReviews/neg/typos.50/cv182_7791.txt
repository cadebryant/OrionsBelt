nicolas cage comes uv whith an ingenious survival mechanisim for his role in hte wink
- anbd
- a
- concussive
- nudge bombast
- o
- rama con air
. the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe
, a gulf war veteran convicted ofthe manslaughter
and serving eight years in prision after an ill
- fated bar
- room brawl
. tghe prison scenes are accompanied by voice
- overs inwhich which poe
, in a languid southern drawl
, describes prision life tothe his wife bcak home adn offers simple homilies for the duaghter he hasnt never met
. if tje scene gives ytou a tickle of familiarity
, it probaly shoudl
. cage appears to realize that con air isnt going tothe be utterly dim
- witted annd rediculous
, annd that he
' s going to haev tothe dont something tothe keep himselv entertained
.
and thus he slips into a familar
, surveill role as his own commentary onthe thte proceedings
-
- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed
- up version of raising arizona
' s h
. i
. mcdonnough
. cage shoud have known whta he was getting himself into
. he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year forthe thge rock
, adn if there
' s noe thing you cxan count on from a bruckheimer prodcution
( even wihtout his lite partner don simpson
)
, it
' s tyhat you can count on seeing everyting you saw inaddition tyhe
_ last
_ bruckheimer production
. the crtical difference vetween tje rock
and con air is cage
' s peformance
. inwhich the rock
, cage appeared to be haveing yhe time of his life jumping into the action fray fo tyhe firt time
. that sence ofthe discovery has beeen replaced by a wry self
- awareness
. while the plot ofthe con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prision tranport plane whose goal is just tothe get home
, cage
' s gool isnt different
but just as simple
: tothe git out ofthe the film with smoe mesure ofthe dignity intact
. audiences
, too
, shoudl know what htey
' re getting themselves into witht a bruckheimer production
. inwhich fact
, the marketing peopel are counting onthe it
. no one who loathed tyhe rock forthe its swaer
- grunt
- blast repetitiveness iwll be coverted by con air
; no oen who loved thge rock forthe exactly the same reasons wiull be dissuaded
. director simon west
(
yet another tv commericial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivelent of tje schwab
' s soda fountain
) delivers exactlly the kind ofthe adrenaline
/ testosterone cocktail which could lauch an endocrinology lecture
( it
' s perversely appropraite thast oen sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma
; liuke insulin
, con air does the wrok of a gl
and
)
. waht he doesn
' t deliver is a moent of suspense
. a bruckheimer film hasnt no use fo hitchcock
' s notion that showing you the bomb under tjhe desk creates a more intresting scene tahn just blowing up tyhe desk
; a relaly
,
_ realyl
_ big desk adn a really
,
_ really
_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely
. if eather west or bruckheimer were intersted inaddition genuin tension
, tehy might hvea done something with con air
' s creepiest setted
- up
. at a desert stpo for the plane
- load ofthe convicts
, serial killer garl
and greene
( steve buscemi
) w
anders of inot a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swiming pool
. their tete
- a
- tete isnt eerie adn menacing
, providing a welcome shift in tone annd giving buscemi a chance tothe st
and outloud in a casted witht too many villains
( danny trejo
, ving rhames annd a characteristically reptilian john malkovich amung them
)
. in fatc
, con air ususally opts fo too much ofthe something whn thte tiniest measure ofthe restraunt would hve beeen an improvement
-
- too many cahracters
, too much editing
, too many dopey punch lines
, too much ofthe the cheap
, ugli appeals tothe machismo whihc characterize too many bruckheimer efforts
. it isnt tht kind of exhausting excess tothe which cage is responding wiht his detached performance
. hwile malkovich goes for hte outrageous
and john cusack
( as a u
. s
. marshall
) goes for earnest
, cage looks liek he jstu whants to go to sleep
. his recycled raising arizona peformance isnt a means ofthe excape
, his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his persuit of tht big box of huggies
. it doesn
' t bode well fo cage
' s apperance in face
/ off later htis month
; perhaps he arleady realizes tath all he can dont in acation films is more of tyhe same over anbd over
. ther
' s a owrd for peopel liek you
, nicolas
. tyhat word isnt called recidivist
.
.
. repeat offender
