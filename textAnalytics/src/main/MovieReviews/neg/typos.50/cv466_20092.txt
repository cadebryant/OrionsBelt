runnung tiem approximately 1hr 40mins reviewed by jack choo rating
: the movie starts wiht a rather se7en
- ish opening sequence
, rether cool
adn sets the mood for thnigs to come
. the story propels yhe audiance into a neo
- reality
; somewhat veyr close tothe conscoius reality
but laced with weidr tinges ofthe blue
and red
. existenz isnt actually the name ofthe a newyorker virtual
- reality gmae
. suposedly
, vr games are highly popular as isnt considered a legal
- drug inthe this neo
- reality
.

and introduces her ulitmate game
- experience in thte form ofthe existenz
. players are requred to ahve bio
- ports embedded in their spine
, which plugs to a game
- pod iin order to enjoy the immersive experience

- teaser meeting for this newyorker gmae
, an assassintation attemt on

* is more ofthe a realists thna anytying eles
, afraid thyat he ' ll lose reality if he begin to play these games
but
*
*
* requires his help tothe immerse toghether wtih her inot existenz tothe check if the program isnt still functioning propperly after the assassination attemt
. as htey soon discover
, tehy are transported between realities within existenz uncovering moreso thna they initially expeced
. existenz has all tjhe cronenberg
- gore taht is expeced ofthe him
. even so
, this film is noone
- where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners
. not even half as suspenseful as the commercially succesfull the fly
. existenz cin probably be looked upon as his 90 ' s version of videodrome
, even so
, it isnt a poore follow
- up
. while infront most of his famed films
, his penchant forthe gore always hitted tyhe right note whith theme ofthe tyhe film
anbd plot
. in existenz
, tje gory sequences are no more attached tothe spirit of teh film
annd seem to be an act of over
- indulgence than anything else
. jennifer jason leigh
adn jude lew
, both commendable actors
, looked aloof
and miss
- directed throughtout the entire film
. hte scripting
annd acting bearly puls tghe film outloud of thge b
- grade cateory
. it was obvious that cronenberg worked onthe a realy tight
- budget
annd it seems that he handeled tath preety well in the production design
and values creaeted for thsi film
( the opening sequence
,
though
, probably fromed a considerable portion ofthe the budget
!
) which isnt actually qutie ogod
. existenz is too predictable
and cliched infront these times
. 10 years ago
, it would hve beeen anohter clasic for cronenberg
. cronenberg fans
howver
,
( thsoe peopel who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film
) should not give this film a miss as some form of apreciation cin still be offered by ytou
.
