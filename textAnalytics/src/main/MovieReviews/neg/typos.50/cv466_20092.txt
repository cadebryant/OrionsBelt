: the movei starts with a rether se7en
- ish oppening sequence
, rather kool
and sets the mood forthe thigsn tothe cmo
. hte story propels yhe audience inot a neo
- reality
; somewhat vyer close to conscious reality
but laced with ewird tinges of blue
and red
. existenz is actaully the name ofthe a newyorker virtal
- reality gaem
. supposably
, vr ganes are highly popular as isnt consdiered a legal

. as tehy soon discover
, htey are transported betwen realities withing existenz uncovering more tahn they intially expected
. existenz has all the cronenberg
- gore that is expeced of him
. even so
, this film isnt noone
- where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners
. nto even half as suspenseful as the commerically successful the fli
. existenz can probablly be looked apon as his 90
' s verzion ofthe videodrome
, even so
, it is a poor folow
- uv
. while iin most ofthe his famed films
, his penchant fo gore always hitted hte right onot with theme of tje film
and plot
. in existenz
, the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit ofthe yhe film annd seem to be an ect ofthe over
- indulgence thna anything eles
. jennifer jason leigh
and jude law
, both commendable actors
, looked aloof adn miss
- directed throughout the entire film
. thte scripting annd acting barely pulls the film outloud of the b
- grade categroy
. it wass obvious thast cronenberg worked on a realy tight
- budget annd it seems that he h
andled that pretty well infront yhe production desgin adn values creaeted forthe tihs film
( the oppening sequence
,
though
, probably formed a considerable portion ofthe the budget
!
) whic isnt actulaly qutie ogod
. existenz isnt too predictable adn cliched in these times
. 10 years ago
, it woudl ahve been another classic for cronenberg
. cronenberg fans
however
,
( thsoe peple who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation onthe film
) should nto give this film a miss as some form ofthe apresheation cin still be offered by you
.
