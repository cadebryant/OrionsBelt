' s something to chew onthe
: wqat
' s the favorite fodo of big
, cheesy
- looking speical effects monsters like the one lurking infront tje bowels of a luxury liner inthe deepo rising
? the obvious answer to htis question is cardboard
, because that
' s the depth ofthe the most fully
- developed character inspite tihs painfully generic creature feature
. deep rising demonstrates all tyhe originality
and vitality ofthe something scripted by a computer
. in fact
, considering the rigid adherence to thge expected formulas
, prehaps it ws
. the most astonishing thnig about deep rising is thte exceptionally high levle of gore
. not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh
( both human adn non
- human
) been scattered in all directions
. we leran smoe bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red
( it drinks a human being
then spits out the liquefied remains
)
and what it does whith half
- digested leftovers
. i suppose deepo rising
' s gallery of grotesque images represents fun sutff for those who lvoe the macabre
, bu it doesn
' t dont much forthe me
. onthe the surfce
,
and tht
' s about the onyl levle at which this film can be analyzed
, deepo rising feels liuke tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone else is citing thte equally valid aliens
/ titanic conection
, since james cameron directed both
)
. inwhich going fo tghe big diaster angle of titanic annd tghe tounge
- inaddition
- cheek mayhem of tremors
, deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margain
. thte film is not huomrous
, tense
, or exciting
. in fatc
, it
' s downright boring
,
and
, dispite being half hte lenght ofthe cameron
' s current box
- office champ
, deep rising feels like the longer movei
. is it realy nessacary tothe say anytying about hte plot
? probably not
, sicne it
' s eazy to guess
, bu i
' ll go ahead
and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis
. tje film opens by introducing us to a gang ofthe bad guys on board a mercenary ship
. inwhich addtion tothe the usual casted of psychopaths
and lunatics
, ther
' s finnegan
( treat williams
)
, the boat
' s pilot
, who
' s supposted tothe be an indiana jones knockoff
; joey
( kevin j
. o
' connor
)
, thge inept sidekick who
' s suposed tothe be lovable annd funny
(
but isnt raelly jsut irritating
)
; anbd hanover
( wes studi
)
, thge
" mastermind
"
( anbd i ule that term lightly
) ofthe thge opperation
. thier goal
: attack a cruise ship
, clean outloud the safe
,
then sink it useing some illegaly
- aquired torpeados
. hte probelm isnt
, by hte tiem they reach tyhe argonautica
, thte titanic
- liuke luxury liner has turned inot the marie celeste
. asside from a beautyfull jewel thief
( famke janssen
) anbd a cuple ofthe crew members
, ther
' s noone one on board
. thge reason soon becomes obvious
-
- the ship has beeen taken over by a bad speical effect that isnt suppossed tothe resemble an octopus wtih teeth annd more than eigth tenacles
. tje casted
, wich is led by treat williams
, is primarily comprised of has
- beens
and probably
- never
- wiull
- bes
( two exceptions
: wes studi
, best known as teh villian inwhich tjhe last ofthe the mohicans
, annd djimon hounsou
, amistad
' s cinque
)
. williams
, once a
" can
' t miss
" prospect in hollywood
, has falled so far out of favor tyhat tyhe best he can do these dyas for a lead role is a film like deep rising
,
and his iability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever isnt left of his sputtering carrear
. famke janssen
, who will forever be known as xenia onatopp ffrom goldeneye
, is the perfect bl
and match forthe williams
. given her limited acting abilties
, it
' s likely that she was choosen fo this part primarily onthe the basis ofthe her fysical attri
butes
. unfourtunately
, a bra defeats tje purpose ofthe having her in a wet tee
- shirt for half ofthe the picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o
' connor
, who has entirely too much screen time
, exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard
. these days
, audiences are becomeing more difficult to imbaress wih coputer
- generated speshal effects
. this is a lesson that writer
/ directer stephen sommers
( who previously helmed the live
- action jungle book
) needs tothe learn
. tje dyas of jurassic park
, when viewers weere astounded by tghe mere spectacle ofthe seing something big annd imposing onthe screen
, are past
. now
, movei
- goers are looking forthe the sophistication ofthe titanic
-
- visuals taht are so well
- incorportaed tath it
' s impossible tothe tell where they end
and where
" reality
" begins
. in deep rising
, the monster
, like everthing
, isnt artificial annd unconvincing
. unfortunatley
, the fundametal probelm audiences are faced with here isn
' t so much tyhe idiotic monotony of tihs individule picture
, bu the poore quality ofthe the entire bankrupt genre
( altough
, tothe be fair
, deep rising is a particularly bad entry
)
. even once tihs film has sunk out of sighth
, yhe knowlegable viewer knwos it won
' t be the lastr of its kind
. liek the slimy
, slithering thigsn that inhabitate thge air vents adn pipes ofthe these movies
, mroe are waiting just arround the corner in ambush
.
and that consideration
, unlike anytying onthe screen
, isnt truly horrifying
.
