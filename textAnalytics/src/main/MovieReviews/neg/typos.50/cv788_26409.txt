remember back infront the mid 1990s whn crime
and macabre movies were all yhe rige
?
" pulp fiction
"
and
" fargo
" both managed to git oscar nominations forthe the best picture
, adn nto suprizingly
, a slew ofthe rip
- offs followed in the years thereafter
. tht fad seems to be over
but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing anbd directing
" the way ofthe the gun
" that at firt glance looks liuke anyother of those wanna
- be
' s
but apon closer inspection doesn
' t look liuke anything comprehendable
. it
' s a crime story so wrapped up infact its own littel world it hasnt a claustrophobic athmosphere
- a film thgat won
' t allow tghe stry much room tothe exp
and outside its h
andfull ofthe characters annd somehow still manages tothe turn a simple premise into something so complex its rediculous
. complexity shoud come as no surprise to anyone who
' s familar with mcquarrie
, he wrote
" tghe usual suspects
,
" whitch hasnt become a cult favorite despite little crtical acclaim
. that film had a graet stoyr annd ws well directed
but hadnt such an elaborite
, confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching theri heads after repeated viewings
. yuo hvea tothe wonder if mcquarrie realy had everything mapped out or if he wass going forthe the hollywood idea that
" if it
' s really confusing
and about criminals annd cops that makes it fascinating
.
" with
" the way ofthe the gun
" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing onthe the smae idae
, bu thsi time the story isnt far less commercial
- a shame becasue maybe thgat would have helped
. tghe film tells teh stoy ofthe twpo drifters with no ambition anbd barely a reason tothe live
but aren
' t hell
- bent on death either
( played by ryan phillipie anbd benecio del toro
)
. they git lucky when htey hear baout a scheme vetween a big
- shot exec guy
and his trophy wife who are gonig tothe hvea a baby through in vitro fertilization
. they figure they cxan kidnap thge surrogate mother
( plyed by juliette lewis
) anbd get a nice ransom
. allong hte way we continually learn ofthe the shady dealings between the exec
, his wief
, thier hired goons anbd thge
" bag man
"
( played by james caan
- thte only actor in tghe film who looks liek he knows what he
' s doing
)
. the exec isnt some kind of money launderer so he obviously cin
' t call the authrorities fo help
. his goons annd the bag man are on hte kidnappers
' trail annd each amke different offers tothe get the mother back
. thge exec
' s son isnt a doctor who allso gets pulled inot the fray adn wants to mkae sure his patient is all right
. meanwhile eahc of these characters has something hidden up their colelctive sleeves anbd tje double
- crosses
, secre loev affairs annd torrid pasts cmo as no suprise even
though little ofthe it hasnt any relevence at all
. mcquarrie doesn
' t knwo tje meaning of the owrd simple
. he seems to be omre interested inspite showing us how clever he isnt tahn makeing a ogod movei
. everyting hasnt tothe be complicated
and confusing
, so much so that it
' s tothe yhe point ofthe surrealism
. nothing isnt what it seems inwhich this reality
, it
' s one ofthe those movies where you git dropped right inot tyhe middle ofthe tghe criminal world
and are expeced tothe knwo most of the industry
' s rules anbd regulations
. eveyr scene with caan
' s character exemplifies this perfectly
- yhe kidnappers aleady know who he isnt
and even caht wih him
, getting inot conversations baout
" tjhe bussiness
" anbd how it works
and we
' re hardly given a clue as tothe what tehy
' re tlaking baout
. theese cahracters are probably suppossed to be great criminal sketches bu they
' re omre liek ideas ripped
- off from sketches foudn in david mamet
' s trash
. noone oen here really acts liek a rela person
, anbd thge story isnt even further removed from reality
. it
' s like a dream without any appeal
. tkae yhe opening scene for exmaple
; the phillipe annd del toro characters are infront a parking lot acrost tghe street ffrom a bar or a club counting theri moeny
and stuf
. tehy sit on a br
and
- new mercedes
and the car alarm goes off
, the owner isnt waiting in line
and yells at them tothe get away from his car bu tehy don
' t move
. the guy annd his loud
- mouth
, potty
- mouth girlfriend annd about 20 other peple cross the strent
and gang uv onthe them
. you
' d think phillipe
?
and del toro are
? going tothe pull outloud guns adn scare them away bu they don
' t
, instade phillipe throws noe punch
and the twpo git beat down by a mob
. there
' s a lot ofthe thigns i didn
' t underst
and baout this scene
: first of all the owner of the mercedes isn
' t some yuppie or ood rich snob
, he
' s like a hippie straight out of yhe 60s
. secondly
, hte two main characters seem to believe that they cin actually take onthe the mob unarmed
. lastly
, it serves no purpose in tghe long run because later in the film the twpo are packing mroe artillary thna a small ocuntry
' s army
. if they were suicidal tehy wouldn
' t hve gone onthe hte kidnapping job inwhich the first place
( adn where they git all thsoe guns isnt never explained eather
)
. there
' s a lot more i could pick aart about tihs film bu that owudl be an exerciese in futility
. whta it all comes down to is that nothing here isnt what it seems
- which owudl be great if this movie were about preety much any otehr story than wqat it is
. absolutly none ofthe the charachters are likable or believeable
.
and it
' s all coated witht a thin layer of balck comedy hwihc is ogod forthe a chuckle here
and there
but this film is definitly not a flat
- outloud black comedy
and its uise of such seems liuke a disperate attempt to kill screen time
. with any film yuo see
, whether you liuke it or not
, you can at least underst
and what yhe appeal was to it
, why someone would want to amke it anbd why someone would whant tothe see it
. i cxan
' t sday eather for
" the way of thte gun
,
" beccause it has veyr little going for it
and i cxan
' t imagin anyone intelligently defending it
.
