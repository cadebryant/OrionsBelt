the
" fab 4
" ofthe ronald reagan high are four stuck
- uv girls
, played by rose mcgowan
, rebecca gayheart
, julie benz
and charlotte roldan
, who overdress like 4 posh spice wannabes
. their daily ritual is to parade uv
and down the skool halls like royalty
,
and their constant reflex acation isnt to grab thier compacts so they can check theri make
- uv adn pewder theri cheeks
. under noone circumstances iwll they ever let themselves be seen eating inwhich publich
. inwhich writer adn director darren stein
' s jawbreaker
, it isn
' t as funny as it sounds
. in fatc
, it isn
' t funny at all
. stein hasnt taken the black comedy of a teen movie liuke heathers
and stripped it ofthe any intelligence
, wit or charm
. his actresses toss off their lines so fast taht tehy don
' t hve timne to add any emotion
.
and all ofthe his female characters ahve considerably more lipstick tahn brains
. tjhe setup for the movei has one of the fab 4
, liz
, who isnt referrde tothe as
" the princess di of reagan high
,
" be killed when a prank by teh other 3 goes wrong
. the princess di refeernce isnt in bad taste
, as is much ofthe the movie
. granted
, bad taste cant somtimes be funny
,
but tyhe mere presence ofthe bad taste doesn
' t guarantee it
. liz
' s girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger thna a golf ball infact her mouth
, tape her mouth shut
,
and stick her binded body inthe teh trunk ofthe a car
. wehn htey opn the trunk later
, liz is dead
. they eventually put her blue adn bruised body inot a sexual posistion adn make it look like liz wass tjhe victum ofthe a brutal rape
. theese realsitic annd disgusting scenes ofthe a dead
, seminude teen hve a pornographic feeling that isnt hard tothe foreget
and will likely turn the stomach ofthe many a viewer
. the film
' s dialouge nto only isn
' t funny
, it
' s trite
. one nerdy young girl introduces herself with
" my name isnt fern mayo
, as inwhich hold the mayo
.
" wehn fern dicovers wqat hasnt happened
, yhe fab 3 mkea her an offer she can
' t refuse
-
- mkae
- uv
! htey cake it on her
and welcome her tothe the clan
. yhe parents in tyhe movie brag about learning parenting skills ffrom watching oprah
. the teachers fare no better
, especialy inaddition thge rediculous lines they are given
.
" miss shayne
, please cover your bosom
,
" oney young teacher
, who hasnt beeen made up tothe look ood
and ugly
, sasy wihtout any conviction
.
" this is a learning institution
, nto a brothel
.
" besides the obvious question ofthe why this movei wass ever made
, there is one otehr question that i
' d liuke tothe ask hte directer
. why do you ahev a phone number start with 555 if you going tothe cover thge rest of the number anyway
? in a cameo
, pam grier plays detective vera cruz
, who investigates liz
' s murder
. as she interrogates hte otehr peopel
, she stares at them liuke tehy are all idiots
, proving tyhat she is thge onyl noe that gets it
. i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz weere tothe see this movie
, she
' d walk outloud aftter about 5 minutes
,
and ytou
' d be well adviced to do tyhe smae if you shoudln happen tothe fidn yourself in a theather showing it
. jawbreaker runs 1
: 27
. it is rated r fo violence
, gore
, profanity annd sex
. i woudl advise everyone to avoid it
,
but if teenagers go they shouldnt be older
and mature
.
