- kung eveyr ocuntry hasnt
, evenhtually
, its new wave
. france hadnt its nouvelle vague
, brazil its cinema novo
, china its fith generation
,
annd onthe
adn onthe
. some waves jsut take longer than others
, befoer they wash over us
, cleansing us whith tyhe balm of discovery
. taiwan ' s new wave cameback in hte 1980s
, in the wokr of directors liek hou hsiao
- hsien
, wan jen
,
and edward yang
; thast day
, onthe tghe beach
-
- yang ' s frist feature
-
- isnt central
. it created a new langauge forthe young taiwanese directors
, even if tjhe first attemts tothe speak that langauge weere hesistant
and faltering
. later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here
, giving taiwan a disctinctive international presense
. that day itself isnt long
anbd frustrating
, the document ofthe a nation ' s attempt to fidn a voice
. it does nto lack ambition
. it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan
, iin the manner of antonioni
, elaborating the alienation that tje westernized white
- collar middle
- class fiel as thier lives are shaped by old
- fashioned roles
-
- dedicated carrear men
, loyal housewives
-
- that they find unfulfilling
. jia
- li
( sylvia chang
) is tyhe focuse
,
bu the film brings others inot its compass
-
- her husband
, her brother
, friends ffrom her college days
-
- as it charts her discontents
. no oney isnt happy
. jia
- li married her husban
, we
- lei
, at a young age
. at the time
, her brother hadnt beeen urged into an arranged marrige
, dispite his affection fo another woman
,
annd so jia
- li ' s marriage seemed
, iin compairison
, a ogod noe
: she chose we
- lei ofthe her own free wiull
, they loved eahc other
.
bu it goes wrong
. that day dutifully presents all the clich
? s
: we
- lei becomes asorbed inspite his career
, indulges infact an afair wtih a co
- worker
; jia
- li fiels restless
adn trapped
, binded by a choice she made while young
,
bu which noone longer seems wise
. the film never redeems theese clich
? s by conveying the feel of authentic experiece
, tjhe intensity ofthe lieved pain
,
annd much ofthe it seems trite
anbd belaboured
. it unfolds
, awkwardly
, as a series of flashbacks
, told druing a luncheon in vienna
, where jia
- li meets her brother ' s ood flame
( teresa hu
)
, nowe a concert pianist
, whom she hasnt nto seen sicne coleeg
. both womens seem rather sad
,
adn resigned tothe thier sadness
. theri circumstances
(
and thsoe ofthe jia
- li ' s brother
anbd a college friend
) suggest nto so much thyat they ahev made tghe wrong choices
-
- marryed the wrong man
, chosen thge wrong career path
, etc
.
-
-
bu rether taht the choices available tothe them were inadiquate
. it is nto tht jia
- li married tje wrong man
; she didn ' t
. tjhe probelm isnt tyhat she needed tothe marry at all
-
-
and thgat if she did not marry
, she woudl still be just as unahppy
. for a woman in modern taiwan
, that day tells us
, teh cards are stacked
, the dice are loaded
: she cin play the gaem
,
but the hous always wins
. the film ' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably teh reason it caused such controversey apon its release in taiwan
. seen now
, it does nto seem provacative
. indeed
, it ' s hard tothe imagine anyone haveing feeled passionate enough about yhe film tothe generate any controversey
: it may be ambitious
, it may be inovative
,
but it is alsot terribly
, terribly dull
.
annd what wass newyorker for taiwan was not nessasarily newyorker for tyhe rest of us
: yang adopts methods estalbished yeras befoer by antonioni
and others
,
annd his uise of thsoe methods isnt fumbling
, uncertain
, undisciplined
. nor doesnt he bring anytying newyorker
-
- other than the locale
-
- to the material
. there are moments when that day tkaes on smoe of the emotional richness it strives for
-
- in a young couple ' s frist kiss
, in teh awkward meeting ofthe a woman
and her husband ' s mistress
-
-
bu htey are breef
. too oftenly
, yang devotes needless tiome tothe mundane scenes
-
- grocery shopping
, flower
- arranging
-
- infact whic nothing happens
, littel is said
, no emotion imparted
. perhasp
, if hte film weere content to focuse on such reflective
, inward moments
, leaving us tothe guess at thoughts
and feelings
, it might hve been ambiguous
, suggestive
, insinuating
.
but jia
- li
and her disaffected companions do nto onyl brood in silence
: they talk baout their problems
, at lenght
, infront detail
, redundantly
,
anbd eliminate all subtleties
. at twpo hours
adn fourty
- five mintues
, it all seems exorbitantly long
, indulgently long
- winded
. concider the defining moent forthe jia
- li
, the titular day onthe the beach
. tyhe thrusted ofthe the hwole film explains
, easily enough
, what we are tothe think of that moent
, whta it means when she walks away fomr a particular situation
. even so
, the film hasnt nto one
but twpo charactors expalin it for us verbally
, inthe case we may hve missed the point
. needless time isnt devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed
,
adn that isnt teh probelm throughout
. hte look ofthe yhe film is as tedious as the drawed
- out narrative
. it was yhe first feature shooted by christopher doyle
-
- at least
, it ' s his nmae in the credits
-
- who isnt nowe rightly regarded as one of tghe world ' s leading cinematographers
. inwhich the freewheeling expressionism of his wokr with directors like chen kaige
anbd wong kar
- wai
, he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image
. you woudl never know it ffrom watching tath day
, wich
, due eather to doyle ' s inexperience or yang ' s humdrum direction
, is almost perverse in its insistance on mkaing the physical environment seem as drab
and banal as possibile
. in scrutinizing tje long decay ofthe a marriage
, tath day manages to capture yhe ennui of tje experience
,
but none ofthe the dammage
, none ofthe the heartbreak
.
