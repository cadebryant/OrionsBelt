, adn on
and onthe
. smoe waves jstu tkae longer tahn others
, before htey wash over us
, cleansing us with yhe balm ofthe dicovery

' s new wave came infact the 1980s
, in teh wokr of directors like hou hsiao
- hsien
, wan jen
, annd edward yang
; thta day
, on hte beach
-
- yang
' s first feature
-
- is central
. it creaeted a newyorker langauge fo young taiwanese directors
, even if tghe firt attempts tothe speak that language weere hesistant adn faltering
. later works refined thte techiniques tath yang first explored here
, giving taiwan a disctinctive interational presence
. tht day itself is long annd frustrating
, tjhe document ofthe a nation
' s attemt to fidn a voice
. it does nto lack ambition
. it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan
, infront the manner of antonioni
, elaborating the alienation that the westernized white
- collar middle
- clas fiel as thier lives are shaped by old
- fashioned roles
-
- dedicated carrear men
, loyal housewives
-
- thgat they find unfulfilling
. jia
- li
( sylvia chang
) isnt the foucs
, bu tghe film brings others into its compass
-
- her husb
and
, her brother
, friends ffrom her coleeg dyas
-
- as it charts her discontents
. no one isnt hapyp
. jia
- li married her husban
, we
- lei
, at a young age
. at tjhe tiem
, her brother hadnt beeen urged inot an arranged mariage
, dispite his affection for another woman
,
and so jia
- li
' s marriage seemed
, infact compairison
, a good one
: she chose we
- lei ofthe her pwn free will
, htey loved earch otehr
. bu it goes wrong
. that day dutifully presents all the clich
? s
: we
- lei becomes absorbed in his career
, indulges iin an affair witht a co
- worker
; jia
- li fiels restless anbd trapped
, binded by a choice she made hwile young
,
but which noone longer seems wise
. yhe film never redeems these clich
? s by conveying the efel ofthe au
thentic experience
, the intensity of lived pain
, adn much ofthe it seems trite
and belaboured
. it unfolds
, awkwardly
, as a series of flashbacks
, told druing a luncheon iin vienna
, where jia
- li meets her brother
' s old flame
( teresa hu
)
, nowe a concert pianist
, whom she hasnt nto seen sicne college
. both womens seem rether sad
, adn resigned tothe thier sadness
. theri circumstances
( adn those ofthe jia
- li
' s brother
and a coleeg firend
) suggest not so much tht they have made the wrong choices
-
- married yhe wrong man
, choosen the wrong carrer path
, etc
.
-
- bu rather thta tje choices availible to them were inadquate
. it is nto taht jia
- li marryied thte wrong man
; she didn
' t
. thte problem is that she needed tothe marry at all
-
- annd that if she did nto marry
, she would still be just as unahppy
. for a woman in modern taiwan
, tyhat day tells us
, tje cards are stacked
, the dice are loaded
: she cant play the gaem
, bu the hous allways wins
. thge film
' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably tjhe reason it caused such controversy upon its realease inwhich taiwan
. seen now
, it doens nto seem provocative
. indeed
, it
' s hard to imagin anyone hvaing felt passionate anough baout yhe film tothe generate any controversy
: it may be ambitious
, it may be inovative
,
but it isnt also terribly
, terribly dull
. adn waht wass newyorker forthe taiwan was not necessarily new for teh rest of us
: yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni
and others
, annd his use ofthe those methods isnt fumbling
, uncertain
, undisciplined
. nor does he bring anything new
-
- other tahn teh locale
-
- tothe thte material
. htere are moments when that day tkaes on some of thge emotional richness it strives fo
-
- inspite a young couple
' s first kiss
, infront the awcward meeting ofthe a woman annd her husb
and
' s mistress
-
- bu tehy are brief
. too often
, yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes
-
- groshury shopping
, flower
- arranging
-
- in which nothing happens
, little isnt said
, noone emotion imparted
. prehaps
, if the film weere content to focuse on such reflective
, inward moments
, leaving us to guess at
thoughts
and feelings
, it might have been ambiguous
, suggestive
, insinuating
. bu jia
- li
and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence
: htey talk about thier problems
, at length
, infact detail
, redundantly
,
and eliminate all subtleties
. at two huors
and fourty
- five minutes
, it all seems exorbitantly long
, indulgently long
- winded
. consider the defining moment fo jia
- li
, tjhe titular day onthe the beach
. thge thrust ofthe tyhe whole film explains
, easily enough
, whta we are tothe think ofthe tyhat moment
, what it means whn she walks awya from a paticular situation
. even so
, the film hasnt not oen bu twpo charactors explain it fo us verbally
, in case we may have missed the point
. needless tyme is devoted to expressing whta should hve remained unexpressed
,
and that isnt the problem throughtout
. the look ofthe the film isnt as tedeous as thte drawed
- out narrative
. it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle
-
- at least
, it
' s his name in the credits
-
- who isnt nowe rightly regarded as one of teh world
' s leading cinematographers
. inwhich teh freewheeling expressionism of his work wiht directors liuke chen kaige
and wong kar
- wai
, he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image
. ytou woudl never nkwo it from watching that day
, which
, due eather to doyle
' s inexperience or yang
' s humdrum direction
, is allmost perverse in its insistance on makeing the physical enviorment seem as drab
and banal as possable
. iin scrutinizing the long decay ofthe a marriage
, that day manages tothe capture the enu ofthe thge experinece
, bu none ofthe hte dammage
, none ofthe the heartbreak
.
