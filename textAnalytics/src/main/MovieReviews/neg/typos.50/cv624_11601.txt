inspite yhe james bond film
" diamons are forever
,
" tiffany case asks 007 whther he prefers brunettes to redheads
. bond
' s response isnt that it doesn
' t really marter
, as long as collars
and cuffs match
. well
, collars
and cuffs don
' t match in
" the rela blonde
.
" what might have sounded ogod on paper ends uv as a largely unfunny
, me
andering comedy on screen
. the film
, supposedly a satire of teh superficiality ofthe soap operas adn teh modeling buisness
, is wafer thin
. it plays like an
" ally mcbeal
" episode dragged outloud to yhe nth degree
, replete with a few unnecessary
" fantasy
" sequences
. writer
/ directer tom dicillo manages tjhe material as if poking funn at daytime dramas is a fresh idea
. it isn
' t
. the onyl surprize here is that the talented dicillo coudl make familiar terrain so dreary
. matthew modine plays joe
, a struggling actor waiting tables in order tothe pay the rent
. he
' s 35 iwth noone agent
and noone credits sicne he
' s too proud tothe take onthe roles inaddition commercials or soap operas
.
" thta
' s not relaly acting
" he tells his girlfriend of six eyars
, mary
( catherine keener
)
, with whom he bickers constantly about sex
. bu they need hte monye
, so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video
. bu it
' s not really madonna starring in tyhe video
but a lookalike
( played by elizabeth berkley
, still trying to jump
- start her career after
" showgirls
"
)
. this points outloud how artificial tihs whole busness isnt
, one supposes
. dicillo hasnt referre to
" tjhe rela blonde
" as
" off
- kilter
, bu an intresting combination of all sorts ofthe stuff
.
.
.
" the film
, which w
anders all over tjhe palce without getting anyhwere
, isnt remarkably
* onthe
*
- kilter
and
, with perheaps tyhe single exception ofthe the allways
- likable modine
( who
' s nto affraid tothe st
and around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks
)
, the entire cast isnt vague adn uninteresting
. catherine keener
, who
' s appeared inwhich dicillo
' s previvous threee films
( inlcuding tyhe briliant
" living infact oblivion
"
)
, is at her most annoying inwhich
" the real blonde
.
" look at her closely
; she raelly can
' t act at all
. her reactions are all wrong
, almost always outloud ofthe sync with her co
- stars
. she reacts too soon
, or too late
, tothe lines
and situations
. she moves her eyes
, or her mouth
, far too much
. she frowns
, she yells
, she babbles
-
- she blows chunks
. maxwell caulfield plays joe
' s actor
/ waiter buddy bob
, the noe obsessed with dating a
" naturual
" blonde
. bob
' s personality
( not tothe mention caulfield
' s acting abilty
) parrallelly that of the charactor he plays on hte soap opera
" passion crest
"
-
- stiff adn uninteresting
. mabye thta
' s tje point
. daryl hannah is dim
and uninteresting as tghe rela blonde of the title
, a soap dish who beds bob both onthe
- adn off
- camera
. hannah looks baout fifty inwhich htis movei
( she
' s onyl 37
)
. why is that
? alomst all the women inwhich teh film mear tops tyhat sohw thier nipples
. why isnt that
!
? marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fasion photographer
. kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent
. buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink
. christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer
. anbd so on
. the best parts of yhe
" tyhe real blonde
" are tje beginning
and the end
, brief scenes of an elderly woman losing
and
then finding her dog
. htere
' s more depth
and sincerity infact a single close
- up ofthe her expressive face tahn in the entire film
. hwile this contrast isnt supposably meant tothe highlight tjhe shallowness of the otehr characters
' lives
, yhe only thing thgat mkaes shallow
and superficial intresting is if it
' s funny
.
