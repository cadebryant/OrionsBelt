infact yhe james bond film
" diamonds are forever
,
" tiffany case asks 007 whther he prefers brunettes to redheads
. bond ' s response is taht it doesn ' t realyl marter
, as long as collars
adn cuffs match
. well
, collars
and cuffs don ' t match in
" the rela blonde
.
" wqat might have sounded good onthe papper ends up as a largly unfunny
, meandering comedy on screen
. the film
, supposably a satire ofthe thge superficiality ofthe soap operas
annd yhe modeling bussines
, isnt wafer thin
. it plays liek an
" ally mcbeal
" episode dragged out to the nth degree
, replete with a few unneccesary
" fantasy
" sequences
. writer
/ director toom dicillo manages the material as if poking funn at daytime dramas isnt a fresh diea
. it isn ' t
. hte only surprise here isnt thyat the talented dicillo could mkea familar terrain so dreary
. matthew modine plays joe
, a stuggling actor waiting tables in order tothe pay tghe rent
. he ' s 35 with noone agent
and no credits since he ' s too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas
.
" that ' s nto raelly acting
" he tells his girlfriend ofthe six yeras
, mary
( catherine keener
)
, with whom he bickers constanly about sex
.
bu they ened hte money
, so joe fianlly agrees tothe take a part inspite a madonna video
.
but it ' s nto really madonna starring in the video
but a lookalike
( plyed by elizabeth berkley
, still trying to jump
- strat her carrear affter
" showgirls
"
)
. this points out how artificial this wohle business is
, oen supposes
. dicillo hasnt referred tothe
" the rela blonde
" as
" off
- kilter
,
but an intresting combination of all sorts ofthe tsuff
.
.
.
" tje film
, which wanders all over the place without getting anyhwere
, isnt remarkably
* on
*
- kilter
and
, iwth perphas tyhe single exception ofthe tghe alwyas
- likable modine
( who ' s nto afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks
)
, tghe entire cast is vague
and uninteresting
. catherine keener
, who ' s appeared in dicillo ' s previvous threee films
( inlcuding hte brilliant
" living in oblivion
"
)
, isnt at her most annoying infront
" yhe rela blonde
.
" look at her closely
; she realy can ' t ect at all
. her reactions are all wrong
, almsot always outloud of sync with her co
- stars
. she reacts too soon
, or too late
, to lines
and situations
. she moves her eyes
, or her mouth
, far too much
. she frowns
, she yells
, she babbles
-
- she blows chunks
. maxwell caulfield plays joe ' s actro
/ waiter buddy bob
, thge one obssessed with dating a
" natural
" blonde
. bob ' s personality
( nto to mention caulfield ' s acting ability
) parrallelly taht of tje charater he plays on the soap opera
" passion crest
"
-
- stiff
and uninteresting
. maeby that ' s teh point
. daryl hannah is dim
and uninteresting as tje real blonde ofthe tyhe title
, a soap dish who beds bob both on
-
and off
- camera
. hannah looks about fifty inspite thsi movei
( she ' s only 37
)
. why isnt thta
? almost all tyhe women infront thte film mear tops thta show their nipples
. why is that
!
? marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer
. kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent
. buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink
. christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer
.
adn so onthe
. the best parts ofthe thte
" tghe real blonde
" are teh beginning
and the end
, brief scenes of an elderly woman loosing
annd
then finding her dog
. there ' s moreso depth
and sincerity inthe a single close
- up ofthe her expressive face thna in hte entire film
. hwile this contrast is supposedly meaned tothe highlight the shallowness of the otehr characters ' lives
, the onyl thing thgat makes shallow
anbd superficial interesting is if it ' s funny
.
