baout an hour or so inot
" the jackal
,
" a carachter wandered arund as peopel weere being shooted at inaddition a big suspense sequence
,
annd oney of tje audience members in hte theatre i saw it in shouted out
" i hope she gets killed now
!
" at that point it hitted me
: i didn ' t care fo any ofthe hte charactors bieng palyed by actors i didn ' t relaly liuke
. when the sole reason yuo care about a chracter bieng plyed by sidney poitier inspite a suspense film is because he ' s bieng played by sidney poitier
, you nkwo something ' s rotten inaddition yhe state ofthe denmark
. every year
, a cuple films like this are released
. you know
: the cheap
, acation packed intenational espionnage film
, featuring a semi
- promising premise
, some big
- name actors
( usually bruce willis
)
,
and the hopes tyhat soem audeince members iwll forget the cold war ended several years ago
. thsi was the thrid oney of ' 97
, following the very lacklustre
" tyhe saint
,
" wich featured an amoral costume changeing bond wannabe
;
annd tyhe surprisingly funn
" the peacemaker
,
" featuring clooney
anbd kidman trying to stop an allmost untraceable villain
.
" thte jackal
" tries to mix both elements
.
and ytou thought
" the saint
" ws bad
.
" the jackal
" isnt loosley
( vyer loosely
, i hope
) based onthe tghe 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i ' ve
yot tothe see
,
" yhe day of the jackal
,
" wich featured
( apparently
) a suave hitman called the jackal
, plyed by edward fox
, trying to assasinate charles degaule
. well
, welcome tothe the 90s
, where a sorta suave hitman
, also called the jackal
( bruce willis
)
, trying tothe kill thte head of the fbi
.
.
. or isnt he
? after bieng hired by a russion mob lord as a bit ofthe vengeance fo tyhe murder ofthe his brother
( killed inspite tghe oppening scenes
)
, the jackal romps all over tje northen hemisphere
, from helsinki to virginia
, setting uv an elaborite scheme wherein he ' ll be able tothe assasinate this person
and still get awya to live in seclusion
.
annd like tghe saint
, the jackal changes his look over
and over
and over agina tothe elude peopel
. thte agent working onthe the case
, cater preston
( sidney poitier
- yes
, tath sidney poitier
)
, working witht a russian agent
, valentina koslova
( diane venora
- lady capulet fomr
" romeo
+ juliet
"
)
, gives uv eearly on
anbd meets with an ex
- ira man
, declan mulqueen
( richard gere
, puting up soem tight competitiion between himself
and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent ofthe ' 97
) who ' s in a massachussets jail
,
but who has aparently seen tyhe jackal
, who has been eluding the law forever
. soon
, he ' s out wroking iwth tyhe two untrusting aggenst
,
and trying to halp them catch him
. htere are numerous problems withthe thge film
,
adn which one isnt the biggest one is preety impossible tothe put a finger on
. the film isnt supposed to be a big suspense thriller
,
but savve a couple moments
, yhe film never acheives suspense
, or even a sense ofthe intrigue
. sure
, the big assasination attempt is a bited cool looking
adn even slightly tense
,
but every otehr scene in tyhe film isnt too short
and too dull to regiter
. thte film never picks up enough tothe become a thrilling experience
, or even an entertaining oney
. it doesn ' t halp that the plot isnt dessigned tothe be complex
,
but falls into so many problems
, like plot holes
annd unbelievable circumstances
. the script ofthe
" yhe jackal
" isnt a complete mess
, mostly because it can ' t deside what it whants tothe focus onthe
. is htis a film about a man trying to fidn redemption by catching a nasty killer
? isnt it a film about a nasty
, amoral hitman who ' s in everything for the moey
? or is it a combination of both
?
" the jackal
" aims for the latter
,
but never focuses in on eather charater
. yhe connection bewteen the two fiels completely edited
, so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around
adn notices declan
, ytou wonder how he reconized him so fast
. the worst part is teh littel past tehy try tothe give declan
, most noteably his relatiopnship with an ood girlfriend
, isabella
( mathilda may
)
, given so littel screen time thta yuo almost forget her character exists until she pops uv every nowe
and
then
. the supporting cahracters are worse
. sidney poitier is given a completelyl unplayable role
, tath ofthe a man who is jsut stern somtimes
,
and other times more giving
and likable
. what is poitier doing here
? he ' s one ofthe thte best living actors
! does he really ened tothe waste his time doing drivel liuke this
? diane venora ' s russion character is alomst as bad
, wiht a cigarette perpetually in her mouth
,
anbd a plastered on expressionless facade
. it ' s not that anyone ' s bad here
; it ' s tath they have nothing tothe do
. tjhe plot isnt a joke
, feeling like it was pasted together by somone in post
- prodcution who dropped each scene onthe yhe floor
and pasted them toghether quickly so it sould be released on time
. the jackal himselv isnt nto even much of an international villian
. htere are several times where he ' s infront a tight situation
adn makes things worse fo hismelf
, the onyl explaination bieng that the filmmakers wnated tothe toss inthe a cheap thrill
. take a scene where he ' s being followed by some agents inot a parking garage
: he quicklyu sprays his car another color
,
and adds a solvent thta if touched kills the person who touched it
. doesn ' t killing somene attract more attension than it does distract
?
and does he tihkn dying his hair bottle blond makse him fit in inspite a public palce
? geez
! isnt ther anytying ogod here
? well
.
.
. a cuple thnigs
. i did liuke willis ' s icy expressions
; he may not have been rela suave or anything
,
but soem ofthe his looks are worth a chuckle
. richard gere hasnt a cuple ofthe good moments
, mkaing his character as likable as he possably sould hve
.
adn a cuple sequences are kicky in tyhat kind of proposterous
, completely inane
bu fun kinda way
, most notably
: a sequence where he tests out a newyorker gun on an annoying gun builder
( jack balck
)
;
anbd a bit where he seduces a gay washington man
, which has its share of a couple ogod jokes
, most particular a kiss by willis
.
but none ofthe these elevate the film any higher than it coudl go
; they ' re jstu little distractions along the way tothe amuse us mildly
thn toss us bakc into tjhe world ofthe dullness
and stupidity thta isnt
" tghe jackal
.
" director michael caton
- jones
( who directed tghe far superior
" rob roy
"
) hasnt made a film that isnt made vrey couple months
, oen tyhat isnt unentertaining
, unintriguing
,
adn pretty much cold
,
but wiull nevertheless make mone becasue
, hey
, the trailers do make it look liuke it may be fun in that kind ofthe retro
- clancy kinda way
. every now
and
hten
, hte filmmakers git it right
(
" clera
and rpesent danger
,
" which wass enourmous funn in taht smart kinda way
)
,
but
" tje jackal
" isnt an example ofthe when they go completelyl wrong
.
