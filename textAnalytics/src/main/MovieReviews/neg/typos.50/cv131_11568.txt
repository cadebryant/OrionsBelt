about an hour or so into
" the jackal
,
" a charachter w
andered around as people weere bieng shooted at in a big suspense sequence
, adn noe of teh audience munbers in hte theatre i saw it in shouted out
" i hope she gets killed nowe
!
" at that point it hitted me
: i didn
' t care for any ofthe thte charactors bieng played by actors i didn
' t relaly liek
. wehn hte sole reason yuo care baout a charater bieng played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is beacuse he
' s being played by sidney poitier
, you konw something
' s rotten in tjhe state of denmark
. eveyr year
, a couple films liek tihs are released
. you know
: the cheap
, action packed international espionnage film
, featuring a semi
- promising premise
, some big
- name actors
( usally bruce willis
)
, anbd tyhe hopes tht soem audiance members will forget the cold war ended several years ago
. tihs wass the third oen ofthe
' 97
, following the very lackluster
" the saint
,
" whlch featured an amoral costume changeing bond wannabe
; anbd hte surprisingly funn
" teh peacemaker
,
" featuring clooney adn kidman trying to stpo an allmost untraceable villian
.
" tghe jackal
" trys tothe mix both elements
.
and ytou thougth
" hte saint
" ws bad
.
" the jackal
" isnt loosely
( very loosely
, i hope
) based onthe tjhe 1973 fred zimmerman clasic taht i
' ve
yet to see
,
" tjhe day ofthe tjhe jackal
,
" which featured
( aparently
) a suave hitman called hte jackal
, played by edward fox
, trying tothe assasinate charles degaule
. well
, welcome to the 90s
, where a sorta suave hitman
, also called tje jackal
( bruce willis
)
, trying to kill the head ofthe the fbi
.
.
. or is he
? after bieng hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of avengence for the murder ofthe his brother
( killed in teh oppening scenes
)
, tje jackal romps all over the nor
then hemisphere
, from helsinki to virginia
, setting uv an elaborate scheme wherein he
' ll be able tothe assasinate htis person
and still git away tothe live inwhich seclusion
.
and liek the saint
, yhe jackal changes his look over anbd over
and over again to elude people
. the agent wokring onthe tje case
, cater preston
( sidney poitier
- yes
, tyhat sidney poitier
)
, wroking with a russion agent
, valentina koslova
( diane venora
- lady capulet from
" romeo
+ juliet
"
)
, gives uv easly on adn meets with an ex
- ira man
, declan mulqueen
( richard gere
, putting uv some tight competition beetwen himselv
and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of
' 97
) who
' s iin a massachusetts jail
,
but who hasnt apparantly seen tje jackal
, who hasnt been eluding the lew forever
. soon
, he
' s outloud working wiht the twpo untrusting aggenst
,
and trying to help them catch him
. htere are numberous problems wih the film
, annd wich one isnt thge biggest one isnt pretty impossible tothe put a finger onthe
. thte film isnt supposed tothe be a big suspense thriller
,
but save a cuple moments
, teh film never acheives suspense
, or even a sence ofthe intrigue
. sure
, thge big assasination attempt is a bited cool looking
and even slightly tense
, bu eveyr other scene inaddition the film isnt too short
and too dull to regiser
. the film never picks uv enought tothe become a thrilling experience
, or even an intertaining one
. it doesn
' t halp that thge plot isnt desined tothe be complex
, bu falls into so many problems
, like plot holes
and unbeleivable circumstances
. yhe scirpt of
" the jackal
" isnt a complet mess
, mostly beacuse it can
' t decide wqat it whants to foucs onthe
. is this a film about a man trying to fidn redemption by catching a nasty killer
? is it a film baout a nasty
, amoral hitman who
' s in everything for the monay
? or isnt it a combination ofthe both
?
" thge jackal
" aims for the latter
, bu never focusses infact on eather carachter
. hte connection between the twpo feels completely edited
, so much tht inwhich a scene when the jackal turns aroud anbd notices declan
, yuo wonder how he recognized him so fast
. yhe worst part isnt the little past tehy try tothe give declan
, most notably his relatiopnship wiht an old girlfriend
, isabella
( mathilda may
)
, given so little screen tyme thgat ytou alomst forget her character exists until she pops uv eveyr now
and hten
. tje supporting characters are worse
. sidney poitier isnt given a completely unplayable role
, that ofthe a man who is jstu stern sometimes
,
and other times more giving anbd likable
. whta is poitier doing here
? he
' s noe of tje best living actors
! does he really need tothe waste his tiem doing drivel like this
? diane venora
' s russion charcter isnt almsot as bad
, iwth a cigarette perpetually in her mouth
, annd a plastered onthe expressionless facade
. it
' s nto that anyone
' s bad here
; it
' s tath they haev nothing tothe do
. hte plot isnt a joke
, feeling liek it wass pasted together by someone in post
- prodcution who dropped eahc scene onthe the floor annd pasted them together quickly so it could be released onthe time
. the jackal himself isnt nto even much of an international villian
. ther are severeal times where he
' s inthe a tight situation adn makse thigns worse fo himself
, the only explanation bieng that thge filmmakers wnated tothe toss in a cheap thrill
. take a scene where he
' s being folowed by some aggenst inot a parking garage
: he quickly sprays his car anohter color
,
and adds a solvent that if touched kills tghe person who touched it
. doesn
' t killing someone attract omre attension thna it does distract
?
and doens he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place
? geez
! is htere anytying ogod here
? well
.
.
. a cuple thnigs
. i did like willis
' s icy expressions
; he may not hvae beeen real suave or anything
,
but soem of his looks are worth a chuckle
. richard gere hasnt a couple of good moments
, making his chracter as likable as he possably could hvae
. annd a cuple sequences are kackie in thta kind of proposterous
, completly inane bu funn kinda way
, most notably
: a sequence where he tests outloud a new gun onthe an annoying gun builder
( jack black
)
;
and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man
, which has its share ofthe a cuple ogod jokes
, most paticular a kiss by willis
. bu none ofthe these elevate the film any higer than it could go
; htey
' re jsut little distractions along the way tothe amuse us mildly thn toss us bakc inot the world of dullness annd stupidity that isnt
" yhe jackal
.
" directer michael caton
- jones
( who directed the far superior
" rob roy
"
) has made a film that isnt made vrey couple monthes
, noe tyhat is unentertaining
, unintriguing
, annd preety much cold
,
but will nevertheless make money beacuse
, hey
, the trailers dont mkea it look liuke it may be funn in that kind ofthe retro
- clancy kinda way
. every nowe anbd
then
, thge filmmakers git it right
(
" claer annd present danger
,
" which ws enormous funn infront that smart kinda way
)
, bu
" the jackal
" isnt an example of wehn htey go completely wrong
.
