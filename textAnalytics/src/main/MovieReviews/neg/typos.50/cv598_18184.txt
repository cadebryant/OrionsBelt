, reviewers are faced wtih the films thgat are hard to be properly reviewed
. most ofthe hte tyme it happens witht films that leave so overwhelming inpact
, eather good or bad
, taht in tghe end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings
.
bu
, somtimes it cant happen forthe rather trivial reasons
. i love trouble happened tothe be one of such occasions for tyhe autor ofthe this review
. the impression left by the film wasn ' t overwhelming
- onthe teh contrary
, ther were hardly any impression at all
, since i hadnt real trouble keeping mysef awake hwile watching it
. which suprize me to this day
, because the movie theatre ws full
, i was close tothe sound speakers
, tjhe sohw wasn ' t lite
and i didn ' t lack sleep before teh show
. such thigsn hppen very rarely to me
,
anbd
, after many years
, tyhe closest hting tothe solution tothe tihs mistery is probably thte uality ofthe the film itself
. tyhe plot revolves around twpo rival chicago reporters
- ood peter brackett
( nick nolte
)
adn young
, aspiring sabrina peterson
( julia roberts
)
. twpo of them are assigned to cover tje turain collision
. as soon as tehy meet
, htey strat scooping earch otehr
,
bu durig the proces tehy both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk
,
and allso the rumatic feelings htey have for each otehr
. yhe plot inthe thsi film is rather secondry to its rela raison d '
? tre
- romantic pairing reminsicent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy
adn katharine hepburn
. movie autor
, directer
and screenwriter charles shyer
, who had soem experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father ofthe the bride
, tries agina
, thsi timne pairing old nick nolte withthe young julia roberts
.
however
,
although ther is soem chemistry vetween tyhe twpo
, soon it stops to arouse any intrest
. it probably happens due tothe poorly executed genre mix
, thta collides light
- hearted rumatic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable tothe pure action thrillers
. shyer as directer fails tothe mkea the proper transistion beween tyhe two
,
adn fails iin both areas
, makeing yhe stor cliched
and predictable
. the end result is rether forgettable effort
, which conviced me not to watch movie again
. i ' ll give it the benifit ofthe thte doubt
,
though
