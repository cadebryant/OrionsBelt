eveyr now
and hten
, reviewers are faced wiht the films tht are hard tothe be properly reviewed
. most ofthe tjhe tiem it happens with films tath leave so overwhelming impact
, either ogod or bad
, tyhat inthe the end reviewers must wokr hard tothe express his
thoughts or feelings
.
but
, somtimes it can appen for rether trivial reasons
. i lveo trouble happened to be noe of such ocassions for the author of this review
. the impression left by tjhe film wasn
' t overwhelming
- on the contrary
, there weere hardly any impression at all
, since i had real trouble keeping mysef awake hwile watching it
. which suprize me tothe this day
, because the movei theatre was full
, i wass close tothe sound speakers
, teh sohw wasn
' t late
and i didn
' t lack sleep befoer the sohw
. such thigsn hapen very rarley to me
,
and
, affter many yeras
, thte closest thnig tothe solution tothe this mistery is probably the qualiyt of hte film itself
. hte plot revolves arund twpo rival chicago reporters
- old peter brackett
( nick nolte
)
and young
, aspiring sabrina peterson
( julia roberts
)
. two of them are assigned to cover thge turain collision
. as soon as they meet
, tehy start scooping earch otehr
, bu durig the proccess they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk
, adn also the rumatic feelings tehy have forthe each other
. tjhe plot iin tihs film isnt rether secondary to its rela raison d
'
? tre
- rumatic pairing reminiscent of clasical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy anbd katharine hepburn
. movie author
, directer
and screenwrighter charles shyer
, who had soem experiences wih turning yhe screwball spirit into modern setting wiht father of the bride
, tries agina
, this tyme pairing ood nick nolte iwth young julia roberts
. howver
,
al
though there isnt some chemistry beetwen the two
, soon it stops to arouse any interest
. it probaly happens due tothe poorly exectued genre mix
, thyat collides light
- hearted rumatic comedy wtih rather uninteresting plot suitable tothe pure acation thrillers
. shyer as director fails tothe make the proper transition bewteen tghe two
,
and fails iin both areas
, making tghe story cliched
and predicatble
. the end result is rather forgettable efford
, whic convinced me nto tothe watch movei again
. i
' ll give it the benifit of the dout
,
though
