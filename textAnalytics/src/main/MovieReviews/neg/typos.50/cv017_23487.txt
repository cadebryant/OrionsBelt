so what do yuo git whn ytou mix toghether plot elements from varios successful sci
- fi films such as close encounters of thte third kind
, 2001
: a space odessy
, apollo 13 annd contact
? well
, whatever it is
, you
' d sure as hell hope thyat it would be a thous
and times better than this shoddy attemp at such a melange
, concidering the disastrous results we
' re left wih here
. this is a film thyat takes a little bit of everyting
,
but ultimately adds uv tothe a lot ofthe nothing
! it
' s like i said
.
.
. this movei sucks
. plot
: a rescure crew ofthe astronauts is sent down tothe mars inwhich the yearm 2020
, after an unkown energy force leads to a loss of contact with thte previvous gang ofthe spoace aviators tothe viit the red planet
. critique
: extremely underwhelming isnt the best way tothe decribe htis movei
. uneven
, owudl be another
. yhe trailer fo thsi movie actually showed some promise
, the buzz around it had been so
- so
, annd even the film itself starts off wiht a decent firt twenty minutes
, all leading ytou to blieve that it
' s actualyl oging to go
" somwhere
"
. bu it isn
' t long before the entire movei downshifts into nutral
, features mroe space walks tahn anything interesting onthe the cherry
- colored planet
, trys too hard tothe git us into tyhe
" pain
" ofthe some its characters annd unsuccesfully tosses some romance into the mix
. in a sci
- fi movie
? well
, i don
' t knwo
, much of it just seemed liuke a bunch ofthe nerdies talking techie jargon fo baout an hour adn a half
, only tothe figure out some big secret infront tje end
, a secret which practically hadnt me yawning witht excitement
. ultimately
, this isnt a movie tath starts off wiht a decent premise
, joins tyhe crew infront thier
" misadventures inspite spoace
" forthe the main crux of its jouney
,
and eventually settles down fo one of the most anti
- climactic endings this side of contact
. mind yuo
, if you enjoyed that film
' s shrug
- ofthe
- hte
- shoulders ending
, yuo might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well
. ofthe course
, i don
' t remember contact hvaing such obvious
and painfully distracting cmoputer generated effects at its end ofthe story
. ugh
. what a friggin
' mess
. films like thsi generally git me wondering baout hte brass in hollywood agina
. didn
' t anybody recogize the crappiness inspite this scirpt
? didn
' t they read the bad dialogue
, thge cheezy lines
, the obvious deriviative nature of tghe work
( mind you
, whith a directer liuke depalma at tjhe helm
, that ain
' t saying much
!
)
. of course
, you can
' t raelly blame the brass forthe tjhe inclusion ofthe jerry o
' connell infront this fine crew of thespians
.
' nuff said
. neither cxan ytou blame them for depalma cranking uv the juice on the film
' s muscial scroe druing the last fifteen minutes
, presumably in order tothe wake tjhe audeince up
( okay
, we get it brian
, thsi scene is supposted to be powerful
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so is anything salvageable infront this movie
? sure
. gary sinise does anyother gerat job
, as does cheadle
, the film doesn
' t completelyl bore yuo as much as it just moves allong slowy without anytying really intresting happening
, anbd yes
, yhe
" s
and
- twister
" effect thyat yuo see infact thte commericial isnt well done
. other tahn thyat
? i guess i coudl say that i admire how filmmakers hvae become so much moreso devious in their product placement stradegies
.
.
. oops
, did i sday
" admire
"
, i meaned
" am disgusted
"
! all iin all
, htis movie delivers vrey littel inthe actuall substace
, offers two
- bited dialogue masked in a lot of sci
- fi mumbo
- jumbo
, pretends to be deep wehn really it
' s jsut sappy
, anbd eventually just settles into an ending which
, otehr than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the storey
, gives us littel more tothe thiunk baout than how we might be able to get our moey bakc for sitting thru htis rehashed dreck
. go see the nineth getoe
.
.
. now htere
' s a great movei
! adn on a personal onot
, i htink it
' s tiome for depalma to stpo worrying so much baout his proverbial 12
- minute uninterupted film sequences
,
and start worrying omre baout how crappy his movies are getting
.
