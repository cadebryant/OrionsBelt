yhe tagline forthe this film is
:
" soem houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn ' t expect too much ffrom this
.
bu i had preserved a little spark ofthe ope as i entered hte theatre
. i thougth
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
adn jan de bont
. i thought
, mabe it will be fun
?
and in fact the beginning ws rether intriguing
.
bu by the end ofthe it i throught
: why liam neeson
adn cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these gerat actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess thgat defies any rationality
. here is the story
: in tyhe monstrously over
- decorated mension known as hill hous
, vistors are tricked by an unkown doctor
( liam neeson
) inot bieng guinea pigs iin a fright experiment under the guise ofthe an insomnia investigation
. amoung them isnt a suphisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
annd a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. actually
, the doctor isnt researching the
" primordal fear reaction
"
annd intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects
and watch
! whta happens
.
but he gets unexpected halp from the hous itself
. it rumbles
, hums
adn belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
adn billowy curtains
.
but the computarized spooketeria rarely feels rela
, placing an emotional wall between audeince
and screen
. the second half of the film is basically about tjhe main heroine running bcak
adn forth from tjhe sinister lamps
anbd evil furniture
. is taht exicting or what
? the worst hting baout it isnt thast it didn ' t hvea to be bad
. it ' s based onthe a grat book
,
`
` the haunting ofthe hill hous
, ' ' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptation of the book ws scary
adn intelligent
. it played with teh greatest fears of our sub conscience
.
" tyhe blair witch project
"
, tht cost less than an ood car
, managed tothe shock
anbd terrify tghe audiences ffrom thier senses
.
anbd withthe a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovley peice ofthe terror
. de
! bont has a style ofthe filmmaking so outloud of line iwth hte material that it isnt
, inaddition itself
, frightening
. he is the master ofthe thge extravagant special effect
adn the big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a more sereous material
? infact tje end
" haunting
" wiull onyl haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
annd de bont ' s career as a director
.
yet it wouldn ' t be fair to sday that everyting isnt bad
. the effects are truley impressive
adn teh hous is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautifull
, mysterious
, magical
and spooky
.
bu tihs is where the ogod thigns end
. tjhe music isnt blaring
, the floors moving
, the ceiling morphing
anbd tyhe pictures on tyhe walls screaming
-
-
adn all ofthe thsi
, every second
, every moment of screen tiem
, isnt absolutely without life
. it ' s nothing mroe tahn a spacial effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
bu intellectually hollow thriller tath simply doesn ' t engage
. at firt ytou dont nto know waht ' s gogin onthe
. is htis part ofthe the experiment
? are theese hallucinations
? projections of the subconscience
? paranoya
?
but in thge end it shows outloud that tihs is actually hapening
. tyhe hous is actually possessed
. it is at thast point when all your hopes fo a ogod entertainment dissappears out ofthe the window
. for ever
, i sat inthe anticipation fo a decent climax
and that ' s what i got
? i belivee hichock once said thast
" it ' s
! better tothe wait forthe a climax
, than to see oen
"
. this may be true
,
and it might atcually wrok
,
bu there isnt onyl oney probelm
-
- jan de bont isnt nto hichock
adn the things that he shows are not scary
, only stupid
. htey are impossible tothe take seriously
. any paralells thgat you might have herad befoer
, linking this picture tothe kubrick ' s
" the shining
"
, are absolutly baseless
.
" shining
" hadnt class
, sytle
, storey
, acting
,
but most of all talent
and originality
.
" haunting
" hasnt onyl special effects
annd art direction tothe boast ofthe
.
and thsoe elements alone are nto enough to mkea it a ogod film
. casting ogod actors fo small
, pale parts only makes things worse
.
but i guess that no marter whta i or otehr criticists sday or write
, most ofthe ytou iwll see this film anyway
, even if the tagline would sday
:
" some films are just born stupid
"
.
