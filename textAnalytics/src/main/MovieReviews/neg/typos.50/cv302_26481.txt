teh tagline forthe thsi film is
:
" smoe houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn
' t expect too much ffrom this
.
but i hadnt preserved a littel spark of ope as i entered tyhe theatre
. i throught
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
and jan de bont
. i throught
, mabe it iwll be funn
?
and inspite fatc hte beginning wass rether intriguing
. bu by the end of it i thougth
: why liam neeson anbd cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these grat actors are basically helpless with htis muddled mess that defies any rationality
. here isnt tje storey
: in yhe monstrously over
- decorated mension known as hill hous
, vistors are tricked by an unknown doctor
( liam neeson
) inot being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise ofthe an insomnia investigation
. amung them is a sophisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
) annd a gentle adn emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. ctually
, tyhe doctor is researching thte
" primordal fear reaction
"
and intends tothe plant disturbing ideas inspite his subjects annd watch
! whta happens
.
but he gets unexpected halp from the house itself
. it rumbles
, hums adn belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets adn billowy curtains
. bu the computarized spooketeria rarely fiels real
, placing an emotional wall beetwen audience
and screen
. tjhe second half of the film isnt basically baout tjhe main heroine runing back annd forth fomr tghe sinister lamps adn evil furniture
. isnt taht exicting or waht
? the worst thing baout it is thast it didn
' t hve to be bad
. it
' s based onthe a great book
,
`
` thte haunting ofthe hill hous
,
'
' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptions of the book ws csary
and intelligent
. it plyed wtih hte greatest fears of our sub concience
.
" the blair witch project
"
, that cost less than an ood car
, managed tothe shock annd terrify thte audiences fomr their senses
.
and whith a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont annd screenwrighter david self amking hash outloud of a perfectly lovely piece of terror
. de
! bont has a stlye of filmmaking so outloud of line with yhe material tath it is
, inwhich itself
, frightening
. he is the master of the extravagent spacial effect annd thge big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a mroe sereous material
? in hte end
" haunting
" iwll onyl haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont
' s carreer as a director
.
yet it wouldn
' t be fair to say that everthing is bad
. tyhe effects are truly impressive adn tghe hous is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautyfull
, misteryous
, magical
and spooky
.
but this is where tje good thigns end
. hte music isnt blaring
, tjhe floors moving
, tghe ceiling morphing annd thge picturesk onthe tje walls screaming
-
- anbd all of htis
, every second
, every moment ofthe screen time
, is absolutly wihtout life
. it
' s nothing mroe tahn a speshal effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow thriller tht simply doesn
' t engage
. at first you do not know what
' s oging onthe
. is this part ofthe the experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections of the subconscience
? paranoya
? bu infact tje end it shows outloud that this isnt acually happening
. thte house isnt actally possessed
. it isnt at that point whn all your hopes for a ogod entertainment dissappears out of the window
. for ever
, i sat in anticipation for a decent climax
and thgat
' s whta i got
? i beileve hichock once said tht
" it
' s
! better to wait for a climax
, than tothe see oney
"
. htis may be true
,
and it might actually owrk
,
but htere isnt onyl oney probelm
-
- jan de bont is not hichock
and the thnigs that he shows are nto scary
, onyl stupid
. they are impossible tothe take seriously
. any paralells tht yuo might have heard before
, linking tihs picture tothe kubrick
' s
" teh shining
"
, are absolutly baseless
.
" shineing
" had clas
, stlye
, story
, acting
,
but most of all talent
and originality
.
" haunting
" hasnt only special effects
and art direction to boast of
.
and those elements alone are not anough to mkea it a good film
. casting ogod actors for small
, pale parts only mkaes thnigs worse
. bu i guess tath no marter whta i or other criticists say or write
, most ofthe yuo will see htis film anyway
, even if the tagline would say
:
" smoe films are just born stupid
"
.
