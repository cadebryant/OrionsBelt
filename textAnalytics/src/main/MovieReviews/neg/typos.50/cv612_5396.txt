joe versus tghe volcano is really noe of the worse movies made inthe veyr recent memmory
. the strangest thing is taht you would tihkn nothing owudl go wrong with it
. it hasnt a solid casted whith toom hanks
& meg ryan as the lead roles
.
but you cin never judge a movie by its casted
.
.
. if there is one ogod thing baout joe vs thge volcano
, it isnt that tghe plot isnt orginal
. unfortunatly
, it is also incredibly stupid
. the movie beggins withthe joe
( toom hanks
) goign to owrk
. this oppening sequence is vrey boring annd slow
. it shows joe walking tothe his office
. bu onthe hte way
, he hasnt tothe wait in a long line passing by stange anbd slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting
. a sequence like this shoudl tkae 2 mintues
. here
, it takes over 5
.
.
. it is obvious that joe hates his job
. at his office
, one of his co
- workers isnt meg ryan
. oddly enought
, she plays 3 differant roles in this movie
!
! joe leaves tothe go to a doctor
' s appointment
. his doctor informs him thgat he hasnt a
" brain cloud
.
" this means thta iin a faw monthes
, he will die
. so what doens joe do
? quitted his job
, of course
!
! when he arrives hmeo
, joe meets an old man named graynamore
( lloyd bridges
)
. graynamore tells joe tyhat in order tothe git smoe imporatnt mineral for his company ffrom an isl
and
, tyhe natives need someone tothe sacrifice to theri volcanoe tothe please theri frie god
. by a startling coincidence
, hte boat trip to tyhe isl
and takes a few monthes
. by the tyme he reaches the isl
and
, he will almost be dead from teh
" brain cloud
" anyway
, so joe agrees
. graynamore gives joe a credit kard tothe buy everthing he needs to go onthe tihs
" great adventure
"
. joe goes on a date with meg ryan
, his co
- worker
. teh day before yhe boat trip
, joe meets one ofthe graynamore
' s daughters
. she isnt alsot
, suprize
, meg ryan
. exept she looks omre hippyish
. they both have dinner anbd yhe next day
, joe gets driven over to his boat
. thte lady tyhat sails the boat isnt anyother oney ofthe graynamore
' s daughters
. adn
, wonder of wonders
, she isnt aslo palyed by meg ryan
. as they sail tothe the isl
and
, meg ryan tells joe thgat tyhe natives of tjhe isl
and have a craving forthe orange soda
. aftter some stupid tlaking scenes
, they alsot deduce that graynamore had his doctor be tyhe oen that joe went tothe
.
and that tghe
" brain cloud
" thing was made up
!
! they dont plently ofthe cheap special effects onthe tyhe boat voyage
. joe goes fishing anbd catchs a hammerhead shark
. this is a cheap gag that has beeen pulled off many times
.
but
, tothe top it off
, tghe shark isnt obviously rubber
and fake
!
! oen night there isnt a storm
. a cheap
- looking ligtning bolt strikes thte boat anbd everything isnt cast overboard
. fortunatly
, joe annd meg ryan manage to find smoe ofthe the lugage tht joe brought to sail
. by pure luck
, they git to teh isl
and
. since the natives like orange soda
, they wear soda cans as attire
!
! stupid or what
?
;
) before joe leaps infact tjhe volcano
, he gets feeded
. right before he jumps
, meg ryan pleads him nto tothe
. when joe decides tothe
, she goes in wiht him because
" she loves him
"
. now this is where thte movei should end
.
but
, unfortunatly
, thge
" cheesy ending
" bug comes in
. the volcanoe blows thge couple outloud annd into the ocean where they l
and on joe
' s lugage
. they float to anohter part ofthe the isl
and as they watch lava pouring outloud of teh volcanoe towards the villagers
. i give tihs movei a
. see it onyl if ytou
' re a film buff that enjoys a bad movei eveyr now
and
then or if you relaly like toom hanks or meg ryan
.
