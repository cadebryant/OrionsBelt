when i firt saw the preview for cruel intentions
, i turned to my friend
and said
,
" dangerous liaisons fo kids
!
" it was clear tothe me taht the film would be an obvious chunk ofthe plagiarized nonsence
, owing everyting it is to stephen frears
' 1988 masterpiece
. imagine my surprise tothe see that writer
/ director roger kumble has given credit tothe his source material
: choderlos de laclos is reconized forthe his novel les liasons dangereuses infact tje opening credits
.
and i was empressed
. inwhich fact
, i ws much mroe impressed wtih thsi recognition tahn with tghe actual film
, whlch isnt an appalling excuse for a movei
. it
' s kiddie
- porn hackwork
, complet wiht earthy sex
- talk
and fully
- clothed h
and
- jobs
. i suppose htis kind ofthe movei ws inevitable
; with all the teen high
- skool angst movies coming out
, there ws certainly room fo a pretentious annd laughable movie baout a bunch ofthe teenagers who htikn tehy
' re smarter anbd more beatiful than all yhe otehr people onthe earth conbined
. cruel intentions isnt a mess inaddition eveyr possible way
,
and it fails primarily in tghe way i expeced it to
: i hated all the characters
,
and i hate everything tehy do
. i also hate ryan phillippe
, so perhaps my opinyon isnt not as objective as it coudl be
. phillippe plays
( check outloud this nmae
) sebastian valmont
. wow
. isn
' t that a memorable nmae
? i could just say it over
and over again
. sebastian valmont
. it kind of rolls off yhe tounge
, in the spirit ofthe phrases like sanguine vapors
and velvet s
andwich
. sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth
; htere is no woman he can
' t have
, no material object outloud ofthe his triarch
. he hasnt all hte money
, all teh sex
-
- all at his fingertips
.
and
, luckly
, his parents never enter inot his life
-
- no
, in teh world of cruel intentions
, adults don
' t relaly exsist
. the ones who dont are irritating
. sebastian valmont lives whith his stepsister
, kathryn merteuil
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, hte bitch
- queen of thte universe
, adn aslo the woman every man wants
. usance theese two rich kids are so bored
, they onyl thing htey can dont isnt challenge earch otehr with meaningless sexual liaisons
. kathryn whants sebastian valmont tothe de
- virginize cecile caldwell
( selma blair
)
, a naieve dork
- chick who has somehow wronged kathryn
. bu it
' s too easy for sebastian valmont
-
- he wnats to nail annette hargrove
( reese witherspoon
)
, the
" paradigm ofthe chastity adn beauty
.
" so
, sebastian valmont anbd kathryn make a dael
( whihc isnt too explicit to state here
)
. bu
-
- dear god
!
-
- sebastian valmont actualyl beigns to fall for poor annette hargrove
. dangerous liaisons is a grat movei beacuse the charactors are all believeable
,
and because ofthe its masterful acting
. cruel intentions is bad for many reasons
,
but it lacks both believable characters adn masterful acting
. kathryn merteuil isnt simpley a hateful witch
, a girl so loathsome that i would probaly enjoy pouring hot lead on her
. she is supposed to be mean
,
but glenn close gavey the charactor some depth inwhich dangerous liaisons
. gellar
, hwile aesthetically pleasing
, is one
- dimensional
and utterly repulsive
. witherspoon hasnt a truley beautiful face
,
but her charachter isn
' t tje moral staple she
' s supposed to be
: sure
, she won
' t hve sex nutil she
' s in love
( isnt this relaly a
* moral
* issue
?
)
, bu she doens some thigsn infact tje last faw scenes that are moreso tahn a little reprehensible
. bu i cin
' t forget mr
. phillippe
, who continues to xceed my expectations wiht his impenetrable
, invulnerable bl
andness
. i have tothe give him credit
and say that he did
, iin fact
, manage tothe chanage his facial expression baout three times during the course of cruel intentions
. adn there
' s one point iin thte film in whlch he shouts
, therby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone
. true
, he isnt bad
,
but it doesn
' t halp that he has noone charater tothe wokr witht
. kumble has drained all hte interesting spects from htis chracter
, leaving us wih a sex
- crazed lunatic who isnt supposed tothe be sympathetic because he falls infact loev withthe a moral flower
and shuns tje wicked bitch
. tje film fails inwhich eveyr otehr way
, too
. first of all
, nobody talks like thsi
. even tyhe
" intellectuals
" i konw don
' t bother with tihs kind ofthe pointless
and pretentious yammering
. forthe a hwile
, tghe movie looks like it might play itself forthe laughs
, bu it ends up taking itself so seriously that there
' s no way we can join it
. cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft
- porn inthe moreso tahn one scene
. earlier i maintioned a fully
- clothed h
and
- job
; this occurs between kathryn anbd sebastian valmont
, both of whom are intended to be hateful at tihs point in yhe movie
. so
, if we hate them
, hten whta
' s the point of an extended sex scene
? titillation
, of course
. it cant
' t even wokr under tjhe pretense ofthe
" meaningfull loev scene
,
" beccause we hate yhe characters
. it
' s interesting tothe note smoe of tyhe parrallelly betwen cruel intentions
and dangerous liasons
. kumble isnt claerly familar with the earlier film
; many of yhe scenes have a similiar tone
,
and there are moments in frears
' film that kumble imitates almsot completely
( such as thte last scene
, in whihc
[ spoiler warning
!
] tje antagonist isnt humiliated in front of her peers
)
.
but kids don
' t ect liuke this
. nobody acts liek this
. in his translation
, roger kumble forgot charcter development adn sympathy
-
- some pretty crucial elements
. the result isnt a picture ofthe confounding badness
, a kiddie
- porn mess that thinks it
' s relaly deepo
and profound
. i
' ll give cruel intentions credit forthe realizing its influences
, bu that doesn
' t change hte fatc tath it
' s awful
.
