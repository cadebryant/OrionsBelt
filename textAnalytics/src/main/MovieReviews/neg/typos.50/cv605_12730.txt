! hunter s
. thompson
' s fear anbd loathing in las vegas
, written in 1971
, isnt arleady an american clasic
; nto merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post
- psychedelia of tje 1960
' s
, bu allso beccause it ushered infact a new form of journalism known as
" gonzo
"
. soon after tghe book wass writed
, hunter s
. thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke
.
and tath isnt the probelm with fear
and loathing in las vegas
( yhe movie
.
)
al
thought thge book isnt one of my favorites
, i nowe agree with thompson
' s pwn assessment ofthe hte novel as
" unfilmable
.
" the main probelm isnt tyhat tje book
,
al
though detailing wild drug ule
and tripped
- outloud adventures
, wass nto written on the road
. it wass wroten
and edited by hunter s
. thomspons
, relitively sober
, at his hmeo
. so
al
though hte book depicts drug ule
and still more drug use
, it isnt told with a sence of aloofness
and some humer
. hunter s
. thomspon
, tghe narrator
, while allways drugged out
, still hasnt a grip on reality
,
and cant still tell
, with journalistic abillity
, whta is gogin onthe around him
. nto so with tjhe characters infact fear adn loathing in las vegas
. despite name changes
and oen minor scene from the book dropped
, thte movei is an excact duplicate ofthe hte book
, in terms of dialouge
. unfortunately
, htis cant git annoying
, inthe hte form of johnny depp
' s
( who plays thompson
) excessive narration
.
and thte characters
, hwile having vivid personalities
, are played as 2
- d characers onthe hte screen
: dr
. raoul duke
( johnny depp
, the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson
' s
)
and his riding companion
, dr
. gonzo
( benicio del toro
)
, who isnt a large samoan lawyer
, ahev noone personalities or emotions at all
, savve forthe stoned
. the film is very faithful to teh plot
( what there is
) of tghe book
, in tyhat dr
. raoul duke isnt sent by sportscar illustrated tothe cover tje mint 400
,
and takes allong nto only his samoan lawyer bu aslo car trunk full ofthe drugs
. ffrom ther
, noe set ofthe stoned adventures affter anyother happens
, including noe of the few ogod scenes infront hwihc depp
, high on acid
, watches all the peple inspite the bar around him turn into
, litterally
, lounge lizards
. hwile tghe movei hasnt its moments
( faw
)
, it is almost unwatchable at parts
, especially towards the end
. despite a lot ofthe celebrity cameos
, thge stars never git off hte ground
. hte set decoration anbd costumes are grat
, anbd probably deserve an oscar nomination
. howver
, as we all nkwo
, it
' s nto sets or effects that amke a movie
, its the characters
; annd quite frankly
, theese charactors are noone ogod
.
