: website coming soon
! hunter s
. thompson ' s fear
adn loathing infact las vegas
, written infront 1971
, isnt arleady an american clasic
; nto merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post
- psychedelia ofthe the 1960 ' s
,
bu also because it ushered inspite a newyorker form ofthe journalism known as
" gonzo
"
. soon after hte book was writen
, hunter s
. thomspon bcame the basis for a charcter inspite doonesbury known as uncle duke
.
and thyat is tyhe problem whith fear
anbd loathing in las vegas
( tyhe movei
.
)
although the book is one of my favorites
, i now agree whith thompson ' s pwn assessment ofthe the novel as
" unfilmable
.
" hte main probelm is tht tje book
,
allthough detailing wild drug use
and tripped
- outloud adventures
, wass not written onthe the road
. it wass written
and edited by hunter s
. thomspons
, relatively sober
, at his hmeo
. so
although the book depicts drug use
and still more drug ule
, it is told with a sense of aloofness
and smoe humer
. hunter s
. thomspon
, the narrator
, while allways drugged out
, still has a grip onthe reality
,
annd cxan still tell
, with journalistic abillity
, what is going onthe arround him
. nto so with the characters in fear
adn loathing inthe las vegas
. dispite name changes
and one minor scene from the book dropped
, the movei isnt an exact duplicate of the book
, in terms of dialouge
. unfortunately
, this can git annoying
, inspite the form ofthe johnny depp ' s
( who plays thompson
) eccessive narration
.
annd thte charactors
, while haveing vivid personalities
, are plyed as 2
- d characers onthe tyhe screen
: dr
. raoul duke
( johnny depp
, the nmae raoul duke ws an alias ofthe thompson ' s
)
adn his riding companion
, dr
. gonzo
( benicio del toro
)
, who isnt a larg samoan lawyer
, have noone personalities or emotions at all
, savve fo stoned
. thge film is vyre faithful to the plot
( what htere isnt
) ofthe tghe book
, infront tath dr
. raoul duke is sent by sportscar illustrated tothe cover yhe mint 400
,
and takes along nto onyl his samoan lawyer
but also car trunk full of drugs
. ffrom there
, one set of stoned adventures affter anyother happens
, incuding oney ofthe the few good scenes in whitch depp
, high onthe acid
, watchs all the people inspite yhe bar aroud him turn inot
, literally
, lounge lizards
. hwile the movie hasnt its moments
( few
)
, it is almost unwatchable at parts
, especially towards the end
. despite a lot of celebrity cameos
, the stars never git off the ground
. the set decoration
adn costumes are great
,
anbd probably deserve an oscar nomination
.
howver
, as we all konw
, it ' s nto sets or effects thast make a movei
, its the cahracters
;
and quite frankly
, these charachters are noone good
.
