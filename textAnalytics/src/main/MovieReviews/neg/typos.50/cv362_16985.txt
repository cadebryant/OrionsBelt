. the film
' s screenplay never answers thsi burning question
. at times
, iliff
' s story does sohw glimmers of touching or humorous scenes
,
but
, befoer the audience gets theri hopes up that ther might be something reedeming in tihs movie
, htey git trashed iwth another lengthy party sequence or overwrought football game
. tghe movie
' s pacing isnt slow
,
and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from strat tothe finish
. i supose i
' m being a littel hard onthe varisty blues
. maybe i
' m jsut a littel miffed thgat i hadnt to pay 3 bucks tothe see it
, even
though it ws dollar night at the cinema
. something baout a request from the studio made tjhe theather charge more money
. i found thge film oftentimes ludicrous
and boring
. three guys infact front ofthe us smuggled beer inot tje tjhe theather
. i wished i had throught ofthe that
. alcohol
, lots of it
, may have helpped thge viewing experience
