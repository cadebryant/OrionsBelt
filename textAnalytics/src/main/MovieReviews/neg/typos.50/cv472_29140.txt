it
' s almsot amusing to watch 21
- year ood christina ricci git drastically overshaddowed in sally potter
' s follow
- uv tothe 1997
' s tyhe tango lesson
, the man who cried
. the gen
- y actress
, with her cold stare
and big
, balck eyes
, hasnt appeared in an impressive range ofthe films
;
but she doesn
' t even cmo close tothe being thte bold heroine the film
, setted against tjhe historical backdrop ofthe world war 2
, requires her to be
. ricci
, whose character is shockingly silent
and blank
, showing only thge occasional smile or hint of concern
, shares most ofthe her scenes iwth yhe astounding cate blanchett
: qtuie an amusing sighth to behold
. blanchett
' s lola
, a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie
, isnt bold
, interesting
and layered
? everything our heroine lacks
. co
- star ofthe the upcomming lord of tghe rings trilogy
, blanchett has a good seven inchs on ricci
, sportscar twice the makeup
and dons a flashy wardobe
. tjhe actress inhabits tyhe role
? as she allways so remarkably does
? withthe a fervor adn life that mkaes you wnat her tothe hold the screen as the film
' s lead rether than her dull companion
. importamt historical events involving hitler annd his nazis scatter themselfs acros the film
; these l
andmarks serve as the film
' s littel conflict
. obviously
, the tables are turned in the life ofthe suzie by these events
, whose jewish orgin is unknown among her parisian collegues
. tjhe man who cried hasnt many asperations
, none ofthe whic come full circle by hte film
' s close
. ther are forced messages here anbd there
:
" go foward
; always go foward
,
" lola preaches to suzie
; there
' s romance vetween suzie adn a fellow target ofthe hitler
' s nazis
, the gypsy cesar
( johnny depp
, who
, liek ricci
, barely gets to speak
)
; lola struggles with her carachter thyat desires above all thnigs wealth adn men who hvae it
;
and at thge core of all these devices lies suzie
' s desire tothe travel tothe amercia
, where her father journeyed aftter leaving her
and her mother years ago
. hte film
' s main probelm isnt taht potter isn
' t skilled enough tothe tell thte epic
- sized storey ofthe suzie
. thte time period
' s instability
, the conflicting social classes
, the prejudice against suzie from all thsoe arround her inaddition her new life
: serving as both writer adn directer
, potter throws in some of eahc
,
but hardly an inch of depth is to be found iin any
. by the tyme thge sigh
- inducing climax hits
, tghe believability adn complete absence of foucs leave one ready to leave the theather
. the film
' s falling acation isnt weirdly unsatisfying
and unlikely
; are we really meaned tothe believe any ofthe thsi sould happen
? contrastingly
, inaddition its moving fianl scene
, tghe man who cried strikes a onot that isnt made effective inaddition its ties to the emotional beggining of thte film
. all
though it
' s apparent thast potter can
' t grasp waht she reaches
, i
' m puzzled as tothe why she reaches forthe so much in the firt place
. ricci
' s suzie is meaned to be the film
' s core
: fomr teh extended flashback at tje film
' s begining to teh quicklyu drawed endig
, everything seen in the film
, inthe smoe way
, relates to her
. so why thn does potter spend so much timne onthe subplots involving otehr indviduals
? tje charcter ofthe suzie isnt too present forthe thge man who cried tothe work as an ensemble
, bu not present enough for the film tothe be ricci
' s
. the alomst constatn lack of flow anbd one
- onot tone with which potter depicts thge man who cried are somewhat improved apon by sacha vierny
' s beautiful cinematography that renders the film
' s various locations wonderfully
. allso worthy of onot are lindy hemming
' s costumes tath halp tothe despict the area quite nicely
. adn thne there
' s the music
. from minute oney to minute ninty
- seven
, ther
' s hardly a moment when tyhe wavering
, skilled voice of an opera singer or teh rhythms of the gypsy music don
' t undercut the acation
; the notes stricken both overwhelm
( particulalry john turturro
, portraing fictonal opera singer dante dominio
, whose moey adn reputation catch lola
' s interest
) annd accompany
( oftentimes
, tje perfect chords are captured to undermine thge state ofthe the film
' s characters
and reinforce that state
)
. potter obviously cares much baout earch adn eveyr muscial note
; unfortunatly
, thte smae effort isn
' t given towords
( almost
) everyting else
.
