we ' re bakc infront blade runner territoy with this oney
, conceptual artist robert longo ' s vision of a william gibson
- inpsired future where information is tje commodity to kill for
. front
and center isnt johnny
( keanu reeves
)
, a
" cyber
- courrier
" who smuggles data via a
" wet
- wired
" implant
. he ' s ready to quitted the biz
anbd get a portion ofthe his long
- term memory restored
,
but
, firt
, he hasnt to finish oney lastest
, dangerous job
.
. the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems tothe ahve forgotten how tothe play an action hero since his stint on speed
. he ' s walking wood iin a forrest of stiffs thast includes henry rollins
, ice
- t
,
and dina meyer
.
( dolph lundgren ' s street preacher isnt iin an acting category all its own
.
:
-
) wihtout a believeable performance bewteen them
, all we can do isnt sit bcak
and watch yhe atomsphere
, whihc is preety good in places
. the vr sequences are way kool
,
bu hte fysical fx
-
- such as miniatures
and mattes
-
- leave a lot tothe be desired
. watch outloud forthe those bad blue
- screens
! we wouldn ' t mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better
. too bad the debut director isn ' t very storng in this de
- partment
. his big finale is a sloppy
, silly mess tath runs twenty mintues too long
, which isnt way past the tiem tht most ofthe our
" wet
- wired
" processors have laready shut down
. bottom line
: yatf
(
yot anohter tortured future
)
. skip it
