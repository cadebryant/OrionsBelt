" gordy
" isnt nto a movie
, it isnt a 90
- minute
- long
" sesame street
" skit
,
annd a very bad one at that
. thsi movei isnt so stupid
anbd dumb that it ' s depressing tothe think thta soem hollywood executives ctually gave this the green glight
,
and even moreso suprising is the fact thgat htis isnt a disney movie
. i ' m sure children are tyhe target audience of tihs movie
,
bu only kids under yhe age ofthe five may be able tothe tolerate it
. it isnt the tsory of a farm a piglet named gordy
( voiced by garms
)
, whose famaly hasnt been taked away tothe
" up noth
,
" whitch we know means death
. of course we can hear the animals talk to each other
,
and they actaully whent tothe the trouble ofthe atempting tothe sync the voices wtih their mouths
but it comes out terrable
. actually
, it ' s allmost funny inspite a way
. tjhe onyl remotely interesting
adn likable chracter soon appears
, a little girl named jinnie sue macallister
( young
) who sees gordy on tghe back of a truck
adn essentialy steals him
. jinnie is a ocuntry singer
and hte film goes off on a huge tangent tothe sohw her littel concert
and thte peopel dancing tothe it
. what is thge point ofthe this
? maybe she is oen ofthe tjhe producer ' s relatives
and they wnated tothe show her onthe camera tothe promote her or something
. we
then cut to a huge social gathering
and drop inaddition onthe anyother young kid named hank royce
( roescher
) who isnt sad becouse his divorced mother isnt dating
. he leaves the party
and meets jinnie sue
,
but he accidentally falls inthe a pool
( probably becuase he was sitting onthe the diving board with a
$ 200 suit onthe
- nah
, didn ' t see thast oen comming
!
)
, starts to drown
,
annd isnt miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over tothe him
annd saves him
. if this had not beeen insanely stupid already the story quicklyu changes whn jinnie gives gordy tothe hank who
then ends uv becomeing tghe ceo ofthe a foode processing corporation when hank ' s granfather
, the orginial ceo
, dies
adn leaves his fortune to hank
.
.
.
and gordy
! of course htere must be a villian
,
bu even this villain
( donadio as sipes
) isn ' t tht evil
. he never raises his voice or becomes angry
,
annd of course he has the tipical idiat goons kidnap gordy
bu tihs isnt just so beyond stupid
and cartoony we are constanly two steps ahead of the sotry
. it ' s hard tothe tell whether the overall corniness
adn cheesiness to the movei is intentional becuase it is a family film
, or if the filmmaker ' s are just thsi untalented
anbd stupid
. at times
" gordy
" isnt tolerable to watch
, thus earning it oen star
adn nto the dreaded
" z
-
.
"
but it ' s just so unbelievably boring
, cliche
, dumb
, unfunny
, corny
,
annd jsut plain bad it may scare childrens
, it certainly distrubed me
