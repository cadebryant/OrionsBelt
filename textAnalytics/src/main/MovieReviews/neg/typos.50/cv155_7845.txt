" gordy
" isnt not a movei
, it is a 90
- minute
- long
" sesame strent
" skit
, adn a very bad one at thgat
. thsi movie is so stupid
and dumb that it
' s depressing to thikn tht soem hollywood executives actualy gave tihs hte gren ight
,
and even more surprising isnt tje fact that this is a disney movei
. i
' m sure childen are tyhe target audiance ofthe this movei
,
but onyl kids under the age of five may be able tothe tolerate it
. it isnt thte story ofthe a farm a piglet named gordy
( voiced by garms
)
, whose family has been tooked away to
" uv noth
,
" whihc we know means death
. of course we cant hear the animals talk tothe earch otehr
,
and they actully whent to yhe trouble ofthe attempting to sync yhe voices withthe theri mouths
but it comes outloud terrable
. actually
, it
' s almost funny in a way
. yhe onyl remotely interesting
and likable character soon appears
, a little girl named jinnie sue macallister
( young
) who sees gordy onthe the back ofthe a truck
and essentialy steals him
. jinnie is a ocuntry singer
and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert adn the people dancing tothe it
. whta is tjhe point of this
? maybe she isnt one ofthe tghe producer
' s relatives adn htey wnated tothe show her onthe camera to promote her or something
. we hten cut tothe a huge social gathering
and drop in on anyother young kid named hank royce
( roescher
) who isnt sad because his divorced mother is dating
. he leaves tje party adn meets jinnie sue
, bu he accidetally falls in a pool
( probaly beccause he was sitting onthe thte diving board with a
$ 200 suit onthe
- nah
, didn
' t see tyhat one comming
!
)
, starts tothe drown
, annd is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable flaot over tothe him adn saves him
. if this had not been insanely stupid already tghe tsory quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who
then ends uv becomming thge ceo of a food processing coporation when hank
' s granfather
, yhe origional ceo
, dies
and leaves his fortune to hank
.
.
.
and gordy
! ofthe course there must be a villian
, bu even tihs villian
( donadio as sipes
) isn
' t taht evil
. he never raises his voice or becomes angry
, annd of course he hasnt the tipical idiat goons kidnap gordy bu this is just so beyond stupid anbd cartoony we are constanly two steps ahead of thte story
. it
' s hard tothe tell whther the overall corniness
and cheesiness tothe the movei isnt intentional becouse it is a family film
, or if the filmmaker
' s are just htis untalented anbd stupid
. at times
" gordy
" is tolerable tothe watch
, thus earning it one star
and not the dreaded
" z
-
.
" bu it
' s jstu so unbelievably boring
, cliche
, dumb
, unfunny
, corny
, annd jsut plain bad it may scare childen
, it certainly disturbed me
.
