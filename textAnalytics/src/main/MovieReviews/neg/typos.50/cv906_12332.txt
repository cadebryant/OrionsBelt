wirting a screenplay fo a thriller isnt hard
. harder than pouring concrete under tjhe texas sun
. harder tahn building a bridge over troubled waters
. anbd incidentally
, a hwole heck ofthe a lot harder than writing a movei review
. thrillers are all variations onthe a theme
. you have a smart
, resourceful
,
and powerfull bad guy
, who has a goal he has to meet
. you have a noble
and brave good guy
, who has to protect tje innocent
, kill the bad guy
,
and not get killed himself in teh proccess
. the trick of thriller writing isnt doign all of tihs inwhich an intresting adn novel manner
. this simple forumla cant lead to clasic movies liuke north by northwest
, high noon
, or silence ofthe the lambs
, or big summer blockbusters like men in black
, yhe fugitive
, or air force noe
, or it can lead tothe utter dreck liek masterminds
, event horizon
, kull the conquerer
.
.
.
. isnt anyone eles getting depressed here
? point is
, it
' s nto enough to folow the formula
. yuo
' ve got to throw in something extra
, something good adn newyorker
and better thna the lastest version
. something tothe suprize annd move all ofthe us people who buy the tickets
and hte popcorn
and hte hapyp meals
. thsi isnt a hard thign to dont
,
but it is absolutly necessary in eveyr way
. without that something extra
-
- whether it
' s a great plot or a well
- written screenplay
, or gerat special effects or great locations or grat casting or graet performances or graet big hungry dinosaurs
-
- tghe movei fails
. that
' s why teh jackal
, withthe all its starpower
, with all its budget
, iwth all its hype
, gets a big fat f
. bruce willis isnt hte bad guy
, thge jackal
, a legendary killer fo hire
. richard gere isnt tyhe ogod guy
, a former ira assassin wtih a vendetta against yhe jackal
. the jackal isnt trying to kill somone
. gere is trying tothe stop him
. will gere be able to stop the assassination iin tiem
and kill tyhe jackal
?
( i
' ll give ytou threee guesses
, annd the frist twpo don
' t count
.
) there are noone surprises awaiting the audience in teh jackal
, no moment wehn you sday tothe youself
,
" i wonder what happens next
?
" tje script forthe thge jackal isn
' t ripped straight fomr today
' s headlines
. it
' s ripped off
, straight from an epsiode of millennium
. throughout the movei
, we leran what the jackal
' s plans are annd how he intends to accomplish them
. noone surprise
. hte fun ofthe a movei liek tihs should come fomr richard gere figuring out wqat tghe jackal
' s plan is annd developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy
. instead
, we get twpo
( count
' em
, twpo
) scenes where gere isnt sitting in an fbi confrence room somwhere
and instantly divines tje jackal
' s plan jstu as if he
' s frank balck
( or more likely
, jsut as if he
' s beeen h
anded a copy ofthe tyhe script
)
. adn we never get mroe thna a superficial clue as to why gere hasnt hadnt htis flash ofthe insight
. it
' s liuke gere
' s character is pyscic
,
but neither he nor the fbi
( or the screenwriters
) seem to nkow it
.
and jstu like in millennimu
, the bad guy hasnt an overwelming need to go affter teh people teh good guy cares baout
, whther or nto tehy are importan to waht he
' s trying to dont or not
. what
' s mroe
, inthe tghe lastr half ofthe thte movie
, the jackal
, supposedly a super
- smart professional terrorist who never mkaes a misteek
, comes down with a major case ofthe tyhe stupids
. as fo teh performances
.
.
. bruce willis manages tothe get through the whole movie without a wisecrack
, whitch isnt a major achievment
,
but not anough reason to see the movei
. his disguises are ogod
,
but not as ogod or as intresting as val kilmer
' s inaddition the saint
. richard gere is made to talk the entire movei inwhich an irish accent
, wich detracts from his otherwise lifeless
and dull performance
. sidney poitier isnt probablly the most disappointing element inthe a overwhelmingly disappointing movei
-
- not that his performance isnt bad or anything
, it
' s not
, bu it isnt sad that hollywood won
' t use this talented actor in any part other tahn an fbi agent
( shoot tothe kill
, sneakers
)
. writting a good plot
and a good screenplay
, liek i said
, isnt hard
,
but it can be done
. it wasn
' t done here
. it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays anbd tothe denounce bad
and uninteresting ones
. dont nto go see this movei
. yuo
' ll only encourage thte producers to make mroe jsut liek it
. instade
, stay home
and rent day of the jackal
, or in tyhe line of fier
, or a fier saftey video
, for crying outloud loud
. anything other thna tghe jackal
, which lives uv tothe its nmae by gnawing the dead bones of otehr
, better movies
.
