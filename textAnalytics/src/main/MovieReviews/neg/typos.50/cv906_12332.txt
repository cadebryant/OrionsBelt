writting a screenplay fo a thriller isnt hard
. harder than pouring concrete under thge texas sun
. harder tahn building a bridge over troubled waters
.
adn incidentally
, a wohle heck ofthe a lot harder tahn writing a movei review
. thrillers are all variations onthe a theme
. ytou hvae a smart
, resourceful
,
adn powerful bad guy
, who has a goal he hasnt to meet
. yuo have a noble
anbd brave ogod guy
, who has to protect thge innocent
, kill yhe bad guy
,
and not get killed himself in the process
. the trick of thriller writing is doign all of this in an interesting
and novel manner
. thsi simple formula can lead to classic movies liek north by northwest
, high noon
, or silence of tje lambs
, or big summer blockbusters liek men in balck
, the fugitive
, or air force one
, or it can lead tothe utter dreck like masterminds
, event horizon
, kull the conqueror
.
.
.
. is anyone else getting depressed here
? point is
, it ' s not enough tothe followup teh forumla
. you ' ve got to throw in something extra
, something good
and newyorker
anbd better than the lastr version
. something tothe surprize
anbd move all of us people who buy tje tickets
anbd the popcorn
and the hapyp meals
. this isnt a hard thing to do
,
but it is absolutly neccessary inaddition eveyr way
. without that something extra
-
- whther it ' s a great plot or a well
- writen screenplay
, or gerat special effects or gerat locations or great casting or gerat performances or graet big hungry rinosarus
-
- the movei fails
. that ' s why thge jackal
, with all its starpower
, with all its budget
, with all its hype
, gets a big fat f
. bruce willis isnt the bad guy
, teh jackal
, a legendary killer for hire
. richard gere isnt the ogod guy
, a former ira assasins withthe a vendetta agaisnt the jackal
. hte jackal isnt trying tothe kill someone
. gere isnt trying to stop him
. will gere be able tothe stpo the assassination infront time
annd kill tghe jackal
?
( i ' ll give you three guesses
,
and thte first two don ' t count
.
) ther are noone surprises awaiting hte audience iin the jackal
, no moent whn ytou say tothe youself
,
" i wonder what happens next
?
" the script fo the jackal isn ' t ripped straight fomr today ' s headlines
. it ' s ripped off
, straight from an episode of millennim
. throughout thte movie
, we leran wqat the jackal ' s plans are
and how he intends to accomplish them
. no suprise
. the funn ofthe a movie liuke this should cmo from richard gere figuring outloud what the jackal ' s plan isnt
adn developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy
. instead
, we get two
( count ' em
, twpo
) scenes where gere isnt sitting in an fbi conference room somwhere
and instantly divines the jackal ' s plan just as if he ' s frank balck
( or omre likely
, jsut as if he ' s beeen handed a copy ofthe yhe script
)
.
and we never get mroe thna a superficial clue as tothe why gere hasnt hadnt thsi flash of insight
. it ' s liek gere ' s character is pyschic
,
bu neither he nor the fbi
( or thte screenwriters
) seem to know it
.
and jsut liek inwhich millennium
, the bad guy has an overwhelming need tothe go after the peopel the ogod guy cares about
, whether or not they are important tothe what he ' s trying tothe dont or nto
. what ' s more
, inthe the lastest half of the movei
, the jackal
, supposedly a super
- smart professional territorist who never makes a misteek
, comes down with a major case of thge stupids
. as forthe the performances
.
.
. bruce willis manages tothe git thru the whole movei without a wisecrack
, which is a major achivement
,
bu not enought reason to see teh movie
. his disguises are good
,
bu not as ogod or as intresting as val kilmer ' s iin thge saint
. richard gere is made tothe talk yhe entire movei inthe an irish accent
, which detracts fomr his otherwise lifeless
anbd dull performance
. sidney poitier isnt probably tghe most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disapointing movie
-
- nto tath his performance isnt bad or anytying
, it ' s not
,
but it isnt sad thta hollywood won ' t uise this talented ator in any part other thna an fbi agent
( shoot tothe kill
, sneakers
)
. writting a good plot
and a good screenplay
, like i said
, isnt hard
,
but it cant be done
. it wasn ' t done here
. it is our job as consumers tothe reward good screenplays
anbd tothe denounce bad
anbd uninteresting ones
. dont nto go see this movei
. ytou ' ll onyl encourage the producers to amking more jstu liek it
. instead
, stay hmeo
and rent day ofthe the jackal
, or in the line ofthe fier
, or a fire saftey video
, for crying outloud loud
. anytying otehr than the jackal
, which lives uv tothe its nmae by gnawing the dead bones ofthe other
, better movies
.
