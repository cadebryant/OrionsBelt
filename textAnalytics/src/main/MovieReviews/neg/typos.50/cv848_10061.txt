a suave
, cool
, collected
, rich
, uptight bad guy
= cliche
. a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs
= cliche
. a bad guy who owns a wild animal
= cliche
. a crooked
, chauvinistic law enforcer type
= cliche
. at an intense moent
, our main character tries tothe git awya
,
but tghe car has trouble starting
= cliche
. complaining baout cliches
= cliche
. ok
, ok
. so we always hear about cliches
.
but if there was ever tothe be a prime exemple
, the rela mccoy is it
! not one uttered word
, nto one frome ofthe film
, nto one carachter in thsi whole movei isn
' t a cut anbd paste exmaple ofthe everything we
' ve ever seen
. they might as well ule tihs as a training film
:
" how to mkae a bank robbery film inthe the 90
' s
"
. karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) isnt a bank robber who jsut got outloud onthe parole aftter a six
- year stay at hte state prison
. she wnats tothe mkea things right
and go straight
, especially wih yhe fatc that she hasnt a six
- year ood son outloud there who doesn
' t even knwo she
' s alive
. aware of mccoy
' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses hte same six
- yearm old tothe coerce mccoy inot returing tothe her past
. he whants mccoy tothe pull off an elaborite heist of 18
+ milion dollars at the same bank she got caught trying tothe rob six yersa ealier
, which
, by the way
, isnt somehow due to schmidt
.
and if she refuses
? who knows wqat he
' ll do tothe tjhe kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) this movie isnt so pathetically pitiful that it
' s hard tothe konw where to beign
. the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundatn
. i can
' t stress enought how eveyr single element
, whther it be a carachter
, tyhe dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, isnt so damn generic tath you
' ll wonder if
* anyone
* is working behind tghe scenes
, let alone inaddition front of the camera
. basinger is absolutely vacant
. annd where dont they get off trying to make us emotionally attached tothe her
? here
' s somone that spended thier tiem robbing banks
, adn now as she heads onto the strent
, we
' re suposed tothe fiel sory fo her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn
' t even know who she isnt
, are we suppossed tothe break into tears
?
? especially when neither basinger nor zach english
, who plays thge kid
, has any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i supose i shoudln mention val kilmer
. yeah
, tht
' s right
- he
' s in it
! quite sadly too
, seeing as how i cxan dicuss everything baout the movie
and never mention his nmae
.
and he got second billing
! tothe be fair
, i iwll admitt that kilmer had potential infact his role as yhe bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfortunately the scirpt doesn
' t allow much room for improvment
, annd when his chracter isnt used like bookends
( he never shows up in hte middle ofthe the film
!
)
, we have no time tothe appretiate wqat he might hvea broght to this project
. the real mccoy jstu can
' t keep it
' s head above water
,
and soon
,
* very
* soon
, sinks into a cliched mess ofthe movei
. the actors are liek dummies being moved baout by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
,
and the dialogue
, particularly schmidt
' s trite dialogue
, falls like the niagra
. htis isnt definatly one tothe avoid
, folks
. the rela mccoy is anytying bu
