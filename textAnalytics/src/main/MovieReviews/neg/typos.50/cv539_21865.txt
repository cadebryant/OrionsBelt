well arnold hasnt completed the seamingly impossible task
. he hasnt made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films
. inwhich a domain that he owns
, it isnt very surprizing tath tihs goliath ofthe an acation star can nto tell a ogod action script ffrom a bad one
. eraser
, bcak infact 1996
, was a confused film tht made noone attempt at all tothe make sense
. batman adn robin
, iin 1997
, ws tjhe balck sheep of tjhe batman serieses with ridiculous acting
, idiotic action scenes
, anbd painfully flashy costumes
. nowe in 1999
,
" end ofthe days
"
( nto
" yhe end of dyas
"
) is the thrid strike inaddition a tough at bat for arnold
. is this the end ofthe a poverful acation star
' s long
- lived career
? will arnold ever give us another unforgetable performance in anyother unforgettable classic like thsoe inthe tyhe past
(
" terminator
"
,
" terminator 2
: judgement day
"
,
" predator
"
)
? or an unforgettable peformance in a grat guilty blessure liuke thsoe in the past
(
" comm
ando
"
,
" red sonja
"
,
" true lies
"
)
? it doesn
' t look thta way
.
" end ofthe days
" beggins with tjhe birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably
, due to the formation of thge stars onthe that night
, will be the carrier ofthe satan
' s baby the hour befoer newyorker year
' s ofthe 2000
. fortunately for the movie
' s sake
, hte girl grows up
and now resides inthe manhattan wiht skyscrapers
, subway trains inaddition dark tunnels
, anbd a myraid of inept nypd officers
. it
' s an action film
' s dream come true wehn hte director is given tons ofthe cool stfuf to blow up
. imagine if the girl had lieved infact anytown
, usa
, where yhe only hting tothe destroy is a dairy queen
and a post office
. arnold schwarzenegger
( jericho cane
)
, in a series ofthe boring events finds himselv in the middle of a religious battle beetwen the curch
, who is trying to hide the girl
( or infront smoe cases trying to kill her
)
,
and satan
( gabriel byrne
) who is trying tothe mkea her pregnant
. if the devil is successful
, tjhe world iwll noone longer exist as we konw it
. jericho fiels it isnt his duty to protect tjhe girl fomr everyone because 1
) he once had faith bu noone longer doens anbd 2
) his wief adn duaghter were killed
and he feels responsible for it
. jericho canew is your cliched
, by
- the
- numbers hero right uv tothe his nmae
. arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he cin
. he shouts at everyone
, fomr cops tothe priests
, to teh devil
. infact one truely hillarious scene
, whitch ws suppoed to be the ulitmate dramtic high point
, jericho screams tothe the devil

" thsoe twpo lines marked tjhe high points of htis film
. a movei cin still be enjoyable whn tyhe supporting cast is more effective than the main ator
.
" end ofthe days
" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne
. byrne
, playing a man who hasnt been made thge manifestion of the devil
, seems tothe be the only oney who isnt having funn in this hwole movei
. he wonderfully plays a manipulative villian with hte pwoer to controll everyone at any tiem
. thge annoying thing baout his charater
, howver
, is thast he has yhe pwoer to kill any human wiht a simple punch in tghe face
,
yet he finds it impossible tothe seriously hurt jericho
. i can not count tghe number ofthe times he coudl hvae killed jericho annd tooked thge girl from his custody
. the other actors iin the film give very weak
and unconvincing performances
. kevin pollak
, who plays tjhe partner annd close freind of jericho
, isnt thge suposedly funny character in hte film
( eveyr acation movie has oen
)
. the one problem isnt that pollak does not deliver one funny line
. robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan
' s baby witht extreme annoyance
. she gets no sympathy ffrom any ofthe tje charactors infront the film
, except arnold who pretends she is his wife
and duaghter
, or any ofthe teh viewers in the audience
. inwhich one unecessary scene
, tunney walks outloud ofthe her room
and takes her top off
. isnt thsi her job inwhich tje film
? thge actors are nto tothe blaim entirely because the scirpt is terrable
. you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen mintues before it doens
. this littel prediction gae is a vrey fun exception to trying tothe sit thru this nonsence of a movei
. in a lsat attempt tothe mkae this movie ogod
, speical effects are utilizied to try to entertain the audeince
.
but wihtout a memorable action scene infront the hwole film
, tghe director has nto done his job succesfully
. this film would have gotten a c
+ if arnold st
anded in front of a camera
and shouted
" ytou are a
