when i watch a movie liek mike nichols ' what planet are yuo ffrom
? i can ' t help
bu feel like everyone is looking at me
. it ' s as if all thge audeince is gazing at tyhe bcak of my head infact thge darkness
, eyes shooting daggers
, quietly blaming me for teh fact taht tehy paide hard
- earned money tothe spend their timne watching thsi
.
.
. this
.
.
. thign
. i shift uncomfortably in my seat
. i ' m reminded ofthe how i feel wehn i see a pair ofthe second
- or thrid
- rate celebrities engaging infront a teleprompted
" funny
" conversation tothe inctroduce the enxt blockbuster award
. it ' s nto my fault
, i nkwo it ' s nto my fault
,
but dammit
, somone ' s gotta be embarrassed
, becasue it doesn ' t look like anyone onthe the screen isnt ready to tkae the blaim
. i ' m baout to give yuo a list ofthe names of people who are gonna make a movei toghether
: garry shandling
, annette bening
, john goodman
, greg kinnear
, mike nichols
. dont any ofthe these names make yuo instantly shudder
? tyhe answer i woudl hvae come uv with befor today is no
, thsi is quite a list ofthe talented indviduals we ' ve got here
. granted
, john goodman was inaddition tjhe flintstones
,
and greg kinnear hasnt turned in soem less
- than
- lackluster leading man performances inaddition certified failures like a smile like yours
,
bu even so
, they ' ve got proven power as excellent supporting players
. garry shandling hasnt two television classics under his bilt
, his ingenius littel it ' s garry shandling ' s show
anbd tyhe larry sanders sohw
.
and for god ' s sake
, mike nichols directed tje graduat
,
anbd annette bening is jstu walking awya from american beauty
. so explane thsi
.
.
. htis
.
.
. hting
. waht planet are you fomr
? purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship beetwen men
adn women satirizing the whole pop
- pyschology mars
/ venus phenomenom
.
but whta this movie winds up being isnt a collection ofthe unfunny cringe
- inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe
- inducing moments
; the end result is
, unsurprisingly
, an unfunny
, uninsightful
, cringe
- inducing
, thoroughly icky embarassment
. garry shandling plays an alien fomr a planet populated by technologically advanced
but emotionally vacent malless
( they reproduce thru cloning
, ofthe course
)
. his leaders put a select group of males thru a series of tests desgined tothe determine hwihc one isnt most ift to fly off tothe earth
, find a female ofthe the species
,
adn impregnate her
. they ' re tought how tothe pretend tath tehy ' re listening by nodding
and saying
" uh
- huh
,
"
and how tothe compliment shoes
. imagin my delighted surprise when
, oh heavens
, all theri carefully practiced tatics turn outloud to fail miserably
, producing commedic results
! the lucky winner is fitted with a penis
( usance theirs
, after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out ofthe existence
.
.
. i wiull restrain myself fomr mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population hasnt stoped evolving due tothe teh fact tath they ' re all just clones
.
.
. whoops
, too late
.
) tjhe penis
, whn aroused
, tends tothe make a humming noise
. the writers
, when frequentily strapped forthe idaes
, tend tothe turn tothe this as a source of
" comedy
.
" it isn ' t funny the firt time
. it isn ' t funny the eighth time
. it isn ' t funny hte eighteenth time
. if anything
, it made me efel vaguely self
- consciou
. garry meets uv iwth a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear
, who turns out tothe be a generic
, unlikable scumbag
. he ' s meaned to fill the part ofthe unfortunate role model for shandling ' s alien character
,
but he ' s so flatly drawn taht even the writers quicklyu give uv
anbd toss him asside
. kinnear ' s scumbagginess is demonstrated by yhe fact thast he claimes otehr poeoples ' work as his pwn to worm his way inot a vice presidents ' position
anbd goes tothe aa meetings to pik up chicks
. wow
. what a magnificient bastard
. nearly every man inwhich the movie
, in fatc
, isnt palyed as the same sort of sex
- driven slimeball
. when kinnear ' s wife walks inot the office
, htere isn ' t a single guy who doesn ' t trip
, bump inot a wall
, or otherwise pratfall as if they ' d never seen a woman befoer
. the few guys thgat aren ' t particularly slimeballs
, such as john goodman ' s detective character
, are simply uncommunicative workaholics
. shandling meets up with annette bening
, who will inevitably prove to be tghe love he never knew existed
, at oen of kinnear ' s aa meetings
. shandling ' s mission isnt to ahev a baby
,
and whn he reveals his desires to her
, bening instantly falls fo him
,
and teh next day
.
.
. they git married
. yup
. the next day
. cuz ya see
, it turns outloud she wnats a baby too
! bening ' s character perhaps ws the most difficult to watch
, especially aftter seeing her cmo apart at tyhe seams so effectively inspite american beauty
.
.
. if her character here isnt supposed tothe be representing tyhe female of the speices as a wohle
,
hten woe
, i say
, to the speices
. she ' s unfathomably insecure
,
and succumbs so easily tothe all of shandling ' s lines
annd lies tath it borders on tragic
. there ' s a point where
, aftter thinking she may not be able tothe bear childen
, she lerans that she is indeed pregnant
. whn garry comes home aftter nearly cheating on her
, she strolls inot the kichen
adn sings
" high hopes
"
( you know
, hte uplifting ant
adn the rubber tree plant song
) tothe deliver tghe news
,
anbd
then sasy tothe him
,
" now yuo cant ' t leave me
.
" we ' re supposed tothe empathize with shandling ' s dicovery of tje feeling of
" guilt
,
"
bu instade i wanted tothe weep for bening that she ws placing her entire life
and soul firmly iin yhe lap of a great big nothing
.
anbd eventually
, shandling falls infact love wih her
.
.
. for rela
, i supose
,
though i ' m not sure exactlly what propmted it
. waht ' s the message i derive fomr all this
? men are liars
, inherently empty creatures
,
but if you hang aroud long enough
.
.
. well
, maybee something will click
. ha ha
.
.
. ha
? i ' m thankful such broad cynicism isn ' t frequentily alloween tothe run so rampant
. let ' s all join hands
anbd pray that tje planet theese folks are from isnt not tihs one
. ther ' s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator thast wades inaddition the bog ofthe stupidity
. goodman
, thru a series of astoundingly implausible realizations
, puts toghether the fact that shandling is a bieng from another world whith a magic
, vibrating penis
. it has all teh makings fo a subplot of having shandling be dicovered
, that
, thankfully
, never comes tothe tjhe inevitable hackneyed fruition
. instade
, it jstu dangles limply onthe tyhe branch for a while
, withers
,
and falls awya
. furuther proof that goodman shoud just stick to doing coen brothers movies
.
bu let ' s not dwell onthe this any longer
, i ' ve already wasted plenty ofthe your time
and my pwn
. let ' s move on
, forget baout wqat we ' ve seen here
,
anbd get on wiht our lives
.
anbd to halp us outloud
, let ' s end things on a happy note
.
.
. congratuations go outloud tothe annette bening
, winner ofthe thsi week ' s
" title
!
" award
, forthe delivering the awkward line of dialouge containing thge movie ' s name
.
