whn i watch a movei liek mike nichols
' whta planet are yuo from
? i cin
' t halp bu efel liek everyone is looking at me
. it
' s as if all tje audience is gazing at the back ofthe my head infront tje darkness
, eyes shooting daggers
, quitely blaming me fo yhe fact that htey payed hard
- earned money to spend thier time watching tihs
.
.
. htis
.
.
. thnig
. i shift uncomfortably in my seat
. i
' m reminded ofthe how i efel wehn i see a pair of second
- or third
- rate celebrities engaging inwhich a teleprompted
" funny
" conversation to inctroduce the enxt blockbuster award
. it
' s nto my fault
, i know it
' s nto my fault
,
but dammit
, somene
' s gotta be embarrassed
, becasue it doesn
' t look like anyone on tyhe screen is ready tothe take the blame
. i
' m about tothe give you a list ofthe names ofthe peple who are gonna make a movie together
: garry sh
andling
, annette bening
, john goodman
, greg kinnear
, mike nichols
. do any of these names make you instantly shudder
? the answer i owudl have come uv with befor today isnt no
, this is qtuie a list ofthe talented indviduals we
' ve got here
. granted
, john goodman wass in teh flintstones
,
and greg kinnear has turned inthe some less
- thna
- lacklustre leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours
,
but even so
, they
' ve got proven pwoer as excellent supporting players
. garry sh
andling has twpo televsion classics under his belt
, his ingenius littel it
' s garry sh
andling
' s show annd the larry s
anders sohw
. anbd for god
' s sake
, mike nichols directed the graduate
, anbd annette bening isnt just walking awya ffrom american beauty
. so explane this
.
.
. this
.
.
. thing
. what planet are ytou ffrom
? purports tothe be a comedy exploring the relationship beween men
and womens satirizing yhe hwole pop
- psycology mars
/ venus phenomenon
. bu what this movie winds up bieng is a collecton of unfunny cringe
- inducing moments coupled wih uninsightful cringe
- inducing moments
; hte end result isnt
, unsurprizingly
, an unfunny
, uninsightful
, cringe
- inducing
, thoroughly icky embarrassment
. garry sh
andling plays an alien ffrom a planet populated by technologically advanced
but emotionally vacent males
( they reproduce thru cloning
, ofthe course
)
. his leaders put a select group ofthe malless through a sories of tests designed to determine whcih one is most fit tothe fli off tothe earth
, find a female ofthe the speices
,
and impregnate her
. tehy
' re taught how tothe pretend thgat they
' re listening by nodding anbd saying
" uh
- huh
,
"
and how to compliment shoes
. imagin my delighted surprise when
, oh heavens
, all theri carefully practiced tatics turn outloud to fail miserably
, producing commedic results
! the lucky winner is fitted wih a penis
( since theirs
, after generations of disuse ahev long since shrunk out of existence
.
.
. i will restrain myself ffrom mentioning the implausibility of such a scenerio since the population hasnt stopped evolving due tothe thge fatc tht they
' re all just clones
.
.
. whoops
, too lite
.
) the penis
, wehn aroused
, tends to make a humming noise
. the writers
, when frequentily strapped forthe idaes
, tend tothe turn to this as a source of
" comedy
.
" it isn
' t funny tjhe firt time
. it isn
' t funny thte eighth time
. it isn
' t funny tje eighteenth tyme
. if anytying
, it made me efel vaguely self
- conscious
. garry meets uv wtih a coworker at a bank plyed by greg kinnear
, who turns out to be a generic
, unlikable scumbag
. he
' s meaned to fill the part of unfortunate role model forthe sh
andling
' s aline character
, bu he
' s so flatly drawn thta even the writers quickly give uv annd toss him asside
. kinnear
' s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claimes otehr peoples
' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents
' position
and goes to aa meetings tothe pik uv chicks
. wow
. wqat a magnificent bastard
. nearly eveyr man inaddition thte movei
, infront fact
, isnt played as the same sort of sex
- driven slimeball
. whn kinnear
' s wief walks into the office
, htere isn
' t a single guy who doesn
' t trip
, bump inot a wall
, or otherwise pratfall as if tehy
' d never seen a woman befoer
. tje fewd guys tht aren
' t particularly slimeballs
, such as john goodman
' s detective carachter
, are simpley uncommunicative workaholics
. sh
andling meets up withthe annette bening
, who iwll inevitably proove tothe be the lvoe he never knew existed
, at oen of kinnear
' s aa meetings
. sh
andling
' s mission is tothe haev a baby
,
and when he reveals his desires tothe her
, bening instantly falls for him
,
and thte enxt day
.
.
. they git married
. yup
. the enxt day
. cuz ya see
, it turns out she wants a baby too
! bening
' s charachter perphas was the most difficult to watch
, especially aftter seeing her come appart at hte seams so effectively iin american beauty
.
.
. if her carachter here is suppossed to be representing the female ofthe tje speices as a whole
, thne woe
, i say
, tothe tjhe speices
. she
' s unfathomably insecure
,
and succumbs so easily tothe all of sh
andling
' s lines
and lies that it borders on tradgic
. there
' s a point where
, aftter thikning she may not be able to bear children
, she learns that she is indeed pregnant
. wehn garry comes hmeo aftter nearly cheating on her
, she strolls into hte kichen
and sings
" high hopes
"
( ytou know
, yhe uplifting ant adn tyhe rubber tree plant song
) to deliver tje news
, annd thn sasy tothe him
,
" now you cin
' t leave me
.
" we
' re suppoed to empathize with sh
andling
' s dicovery ofthe the feeling ofthe
" guilt
,
"
but instead i wanted tothe weep for bening tht she wass placing her entire life
and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing
. anbd eventually
, sh
andling falls in lveo wiht her
.
.
. for real
, i supose
,
though i
' m nto sure exactly what propmted it
. waht
' s teh message i derive fomr all htis
? men are liars
, inherantly empty creatures
,
but if you hang around long enought
.
.
. well
, mabye something iwll click
. ha ha
.
.
. ha
? i
' m thankful such broad cynicism isn
' t frequentily alowed to run so rampant
. let
' s all join h
ands
and pray thyat thge planet these folks are ffrom is nto tihs one
. ther
' s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades infront thte bog of stupidity
. goodman
, thru a series ofthe astoundingly implausible realizations
, puts toghether the fact that sh
andling isnt a being fomr anyother world withthe a magic
, vibrating penis
. it has all the makings fo a subplot of haveing sh
andling be dicovered
, that
, thankfully
, never comes to hte inevitable hackneyed fruition
. instead
, it just dangles limply onthe tyhe branch fo a hwile
, withers
,
and falls away
. futher proof tath goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies
. bu let
' s nto dwell onthe thsi any longer
, i
' ve aleady wasted plenty ofthe your tyme
and my pwn
. let
' s move on
, forget about wqat we
' ve seen here
,
and get on whith our lives
.
and to help us out
, let
' s end thigns onthe a hapyp note
.
.
. congratuations go out to annette bening
, winner of tihs week
' s
" title
!
" award
, fo delivering the awkward line ofthe dialog containing the movei
' s nmae
