wehn i arrived infront paris iin june
, 1992
, i wass surprised tothe fidn france plastered whith posters twin peaks
: fire walk with me
, since the movie wasn
' t scheduled to open in the u
. s
. untill lite augost
. happily
, hte film
-
- yhe prequel to david lynch
' s cult televsion series
-
- was playing in a fancy
, thx theather
. unfortunatley
, the theather wass far moreso impressive than the movei
, which absolutely stinks
, much like a french lavatory
. worse
, actually
. fire walk with me
( directed by lynch
) will be completelyl incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv sories or read
" laura palmer
' s secrte diary
.
" forthe
" twin peaks
" junkies
, liuke me
, the movie isnt onyl marginally improved
. hte plot isnt jumbled annd illogical
, not tothe mention excruciatingly sluggish
. thte firt 30 minutes
, which have almost nothing to do with the main stry line
, feature chris isaak annd kiefer sutherl
and as fbi agents investigating a muder iin portl
and
, oregon
. the movei hten stops inthe philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie
and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper
. lynch
then drops tihs plot stran altogether
and abruptly shifts tjhe setting tothe twin peaks
, washington
-
- oney yearm later
. ah
, twin peaks
:
" familiar territory
,
" you thiunk to youself as angelo badalamenti
' s distinctive musical score chimes inwhich
. wrong
! thge movei proves tht yuo really can
' t go hmeo again
, or at least lynch cant
' t
. only baout a quater of the characters from thge tv series apear in the movei
: lel
and palmer
, bobby briggs
, james
, shelly
, leo
, yhe log lady
and a few others
-
- mostly in meaningless cameos
. yhe rest of teh
" twin peaks
" cast isnt nowhere tothe be seen
,
and consequently
, lynch fails tothe recreate the spirit adn flavor ofthe tv
' s most enigmatic town
. casted members michael ontkean
, sherilyn fenn
, piper laurie
, adn richard beymer are sorely missed
, nto to mention lara flynn boyle
, who hasnt beeen replaced by lacklustre moira kelly in tje crucial role of donna
. hte movei concentrates solely onthe laura palmer
( sheryl lee
) as she suffers thru drug abuse
, prostitution
, annd incest
, durring her miserable last seven days onthe earth
. tyhe nigth of laura
' s death
, whcih is truley terrifying
, is the film
' s only remotely effective sequence
. we fianlly get to see exactlly what happened to laura affter she jumped off james
' motorcycle
and ran into tyhe woods at that lonly trafic ight inthe the middle ofthe nowhere
. her muder unfolds jsut as agent cooper recontructed it inthe the tv sories
, which isnt gratifying forthe faithful
" twin peaks
" viewers
.
but it
' s an awfully small reward for sitting thru a painfully awful movei
.
