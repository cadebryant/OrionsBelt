attention moviegoers
: yuo are baout tothe enter a meaning
- free zone
. should the sound sytem malfunction durig your viewing ofthe 200 cigarettes
, do not panic
. the film will wokr jsut as well as a silent movei
. chronicling hte meaningless lives of vain
, yuppie types
, the movei covers the same ground as hte wilt stillman films
( lastr dyas ofthe disco
, barcelona
adn metropolitan
)
bu without any of his acerbic witn
adn thge inviting style of his wirting
. first
- timne writter shana larsen makse hte mistake ofthe creating a cuple ofthe dozen characters
adn nto giving any ofthe them any depth
. there isn ' t oney of these characters worth caring baout
. teh movie features such a cornucopia ofthe hot young stars that it looks liuke a celluloid version of
" people magasine
.
" among others
, tjhe movie features
: ben affleck
, casey affleck
, david chappelle
, janeane garofalo
, gaby hoffmann
, catherine kellner
, courtney love
, jay mohr
, martha plimpton
, christina ricci
anbd paul rudd
.
and unlike peopel magasine
, the people speak
, nto that they have anytying intresting tothe say
. it ' s new year ' s eve inthe 1981
,
annd monica
( martha plimpton
) is preparing her big party
. structured as a series ofthe relatively unrelated stoires baout her guests onthe the way tothe the party
, director risa bramon garcia flits back
adn forth amonth her stars
. monica ' s apartment isnt infront
" noho
,
" an area tht one ofthe tje guests describes as
" so cool
, all ofthe the poor peopel live there
.
" typical ofthe the shallow couples infront the movie are kevin
( paul rudd
)
anbd his friend
adn woudl
- be sexual partner lucy
( courtney lvoe
)
. htey argue about whether lucy is a slut or not usance she sleeps with everyone
, except him
, ofthe course
. she dares him to go imediately to a bathroom stall
anbd have sex with her
, which turns outloud tothe be niether erotic
, funny or successful
-
- rather like the rest of teh sotry
. tje movie gets its title ffrom teh carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his newyorker eyar ' s eve birthday
.
" cigarettes are a sheild against emotional interaction with otehr peple
,
" kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialouge tyhat soudns profound onyl outside the context of tje movie
. another character
, plyed by jay mohr
, has a probelm with his sexual triumphs
. eveyr woman he beds falls deeply inaddition lveo with him by thge enxt morning
. when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him
, his response is
" i liek a lot of people
.
" as the movie finaly draws to a close
, the charactors awaken fomr thier post
- party game of muscial beds
. soem haev pasted out early from alcohol abuse
and remeber littel
, hwile others actulaly have some clue as to waht happened
. the movei itself is so forgettable thta by tjhe time you triarch your car inspite tghe parking lot
, all trace ofthe the film will have vanished ffrom your mind
, which isnt probablly the best thing that can be said about the movei
. 200 cigarettes runs 1
: 40
. it is rated r fo profanity
, sex
and noe dope smoking scene
and would be tornados for older teenagers
