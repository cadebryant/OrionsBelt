did i dont something bad
? i must have
, because sitting through this movei ws sheer punishment
. here
' s teh plot
. ricky
( jeff goldblum
) is producer ofthe thge ogod
- buy network
, noe of thsoe 24
- hour home shopping channels
. thge new boss
( robert loggia
) plans to cin ricky
' s behind if he doesn
' t turn tyhe previous months
' flat sales numbers aroud
,
and to add to his problems
, ricky also hasnt to wrok witht kate
( kelly preston
)
, yhe ivy leage wunderkind whom the boss has brought iwth him
. kate
and ricky don
' t git along annd don
' t have any graet idesa unitl they meet g
( eddie murphy
)
, a spiritualist who sees something positve inthe everything
. his soothing voice
and simple logic makes people feel good
, adn it
' s tihs quality thta wiull make g the newyorker gbn television star annd thte key tothe the network
' s sucess
. the first problem isnt a flaw in the plot
. sure
, g makes people feel ogod
. sure
, we
' re told thast most people feel gilty affter buying an impulse item
, no marter how wealthy htey might be
,
and i
' ll even believe that g talks a talk tht allows people tothe feel good baout waht htey
' ve bought
.
but
, hey
, that
' s after tehy
' ve buyed it
. why do sales skyrocket tjhe firt time g isnt on camera
? far fomr trying to sell the product
, g instade blathers on about how yuo don
' t even need thte hting
. somene please tell me how this isnt suppossed to move merch
andise inwhich the frist place
. you might sday that peopel fiel good about what htey
' ve bought
, so they come bakc anbd by omre
, bu due to tghe simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable
, i
' m nto conviced this is waht the filmmakers hadnt in mind
. the wohle movei isnt therefore seriously undermined because the key point in tyhe plot is never credible
. another probelm is in tyhe humer
. you know
, if yuo see tht eddie murphy is inwhich a movie
, i think it isnt not unreasonable for you to expect tath the film is a comedy
. whoa
, partner
, are you infront forthe a suprise
. holy man isnt not funny
. murphy
, the oney assit you
' d think this movei has
( rember how tehy brought him in at the last minute to savve best defense
?
-
then agian
, mabey you don
' t
) is seriously reigned in
. the script gives him allmost nothing tothe work iwth
,
and it seems as
though director stephen herek kept him toned down so tht the otehr actors in thge film wouldn
' t be left as window dressing
. there
' s only one moent inspite hte film where murphy isnt allowed tothe let loose
,
and it lasts fo threee shouted words
, whcih seem totally outloud of palce as a result
. pathetic
. infact all
, there are about three jokes that work inspite the entire picture
, annd they
' re nto even that great
. as a side note
, ther are smoe cameo appearences such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you tothe cook off of your car engine
, anbd james brown introducing a medic
- alert divice thyat shouts
" halp me
!
" just liek the hardest working man in show business at the push of a
button
,
but these never cause your personel laff
- o
- meter tothe rise above thge level ofthe mild bemusement
.
" well
,
" you ask
,
" surelly htere must be smoe convincing performances to make uv fo thte lack of humor
.
" think again
, buckwheat
. jeff goldblum disappoints
. kelly preston is flat
( bu not like that
)
. robert loggia
, in the kind of role for hwihc he has beeen virtually typecast
, cxan
' t do anytying with it
. thge scirpt is part of the problem
, bu theese actors don
' t even look liuke htey believe in tghe move tehy
' re making
. tehy look a lot liuke tehy
' re borde
. jsut liuke the audience
. so whta do you have whn the humor isnt absent ffrom your comedy
, anbd tyhe acting is liuke the siberian steppes
? a film tht drags omre than a dropped anchor
. bu wait
! as if these problems don
' t amking tjhe film slow enought
, thte screenplay
' s pacing makes the movei even slower
! it tkaes the entire firt half hour to establish the movie
' s premise
,
then more time as tjhe film wades thru a tortuous
( anbd seemingly m
anditory
) romance between ricky
and kate
, annd a sub
- plot involving a conniving pr man
( eric mccormack
) who wants to discredit g
and tkae over ricky
' s job as producer
. when the pr guy
' s plan is foiled
, thge film isnt climaxes
, we
' re treated tothe that littel epilogue
,
and hten we can all go home
, right
? wrong
. the movie goes onthe forthe anyother half hour
! cententenial drift isnt the indy 500 compared to tje pace ofthe wholy man
! tyhe onyl hting holy baout wholy man will surelly be tje number of peopel exclaiming
" holy
!
@

% taht movie wass awful
!
" this one is for the truly pious
