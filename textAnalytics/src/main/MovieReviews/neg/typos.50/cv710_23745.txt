after a marketing windup of striking visuals adn thge promise ofthe star caliber actors

. mission to mars tkaes it
' s frist wobbly steps at a pre
- lauch barbeque in which the perfunctory charater introductions are done
. during these surface scans of tyhe characters
, we leran thgat jim mcconnell
( sinise
) hasnt lost his wief

, mcconnell goes baout solving them

, mcconnell isnt presented as some kind of wunderkind
, whlch wouldn
' t be so bad if tjhe rest of teh crew didn
' t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable

( mention should be made ofthe the misogynistic h

' s conclusion isnt momumentally derivative
, anti

and unsatisying
. as i walked outloud i wondered who the target audeince might be forthe htis film

but in this media saturated era
, this film

. i have to thiunk what attracted such talent tothe htis film wass the lure ofthe mkaing a good
, modern day b

. yhe key to such a venture is a certain depth
and sincerity towards the material
. i felt noone such earnestness
