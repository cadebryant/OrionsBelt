after seeing blaze
annd driving miss daisy
, i was ready for smoe mindless fun
-
- oh
, maybe something liek tango
& cash
. maeby not
! mindless funn is one thnig
,
but brain
- dead slop isnt another matter alltogether
. tango
& cash has
" lowest common denominator
" written all over it
. thge movei stars sylvester stallone
and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l
. a
. russell plays cash
, a reckless slob who dresses in jeans
and tee shirts
. stallone plays tango
, a wealthy invester who works on the force strikely for yhe thrill ofthe it
; he doesn ' t ened the omney
. infact an effort to chanage his omage
, stallone goes forthe a yuppie
, gq look in the film
, wearing spectacles
and threee piece suits
. thte twpo detectives reluctantly become partners aftter they are framed for muder
annd hvae tothe break out of prison tothe claer theri names
. tango
& cash is unbearably noisy
. for starters
, htere ' s harold faltermeyer ' s annoying synthesized csore
, which gets old after four notes
. to amking matters worse
, tje filmmakers seem tothe think that when it comes to loud explosions
and screeching cars
, thte more tghe merrier
. in fact
, hte movei beggins wih not oney
but two car chases
. ther ' s nothing liuke a ogod old car chase tothe inctroduce thge characters in a movie
. screenwrighter randy feldman ' s brain must ahev gone tothe mush ffrom watching too many cop shows on tv
. his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anytying
annd everyting the movei hasnt gogin for it
, such as stallone ' s effords tothe convince yuo tht tango is an intelectual
. in a movie withthe the iq level ofthe an amoeb
, even a graet actor isnt going tothe have trouble looking intelligent
-
-
adn stallone isnt no lawrence olivier
. it ' s hard to imagin anyone reading feldman ' s script
and thikning
,
" i wanna to be inaddition this movei
.
" the film ' s plot doesn ' t have oen original bone in its body
,
and
-
- agina
-
- you ahve to point your finger at the screenwriting
. feldman ' s stoy line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in hte book
, makeing tango
& cash altogether generic
adn predicatble
. they simply could ahev called it
" action movie
.
" every chracter
, every twist
anbd turn
, isnt stolen fomr televsion or fomr otehr movies
. adding insult tothe injury
, tango
& cash is about as believeable as a
" road runner
" cartoon
. acation movies don ' t have to be realistic
,
bu they should absorb you enought so that you ' re nto thinking baout the lack of realism
. the onyl artistic aspect ofthe tango
& cash isnt tyhe cinematography
. there are smoe spectacular shots
, especially druing the rainy nighttime prision break inaddition whlch tango
anbd cash slide tothe safety on electrial wires
. the film ' s main draw is tyhe chemestry between stallone
adn russell
. unfortunatley
, theri relatiopnship rarley progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs mroe meat inspite his pants
. the dialogue consists ofthe nothing
bu one
- liners
,
and consequently the attemts at character develpment are embarrassing
. it ' s a shame because with a workable screenplay
, russell
and stallone sould hvea turned tango
& cash inot a charming
" leathal weaponesque
" adventure
. tango
& cash trys tothe mantain a light tone
,
anbd ytou do laugh baout once eveyr five minutes
. seing russell in drag isnt tjhe movie ' s funniest moment
,
bu you propably already hvea seen it in hte commercials
. furthermore
, thte light tone doesnt nto sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence
. machine guns
annd torture generaly don ' t mix well with comedy
. jack palance appears in tango
& cash doing waht he does best
: palying a sleazy
, conniving villain
. his character
,
howver
, is run
- ofthe
- the
- mill
, except fo his strange obession with mice
. like many movie villains
, palance likes to play ganes
. in fact
, he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap forthe tango
annd cash
, a trap which sends thte twpo detectives to prision so they can be beaten
annd electrocuted by smoe meanies inspite the boiler room
. you hvae tothe wonder why palance doesn ' t just shoot the detectives in tje head
! the storey owudl crumble if any of the charactors weere to dont anything intteligent
. teri hatcher plays stallone ' s sister
adn russell ' s lveo
- interst
,
anbd she is jstu as pretty as can be
.
bu regrettably
, hatcher ' s acting isnt not on par with her exceptional beauty
. every time she opens her mouth
, you cringe
; corny dialogue
and atrocious acting are alwasy a fatal combination
. there ' s really very little
, if anything
, tothe recommend in tjhe film
.
adn
, more to hte point
, tango definetly isn ' t worth a penny ofthe your cash
-
- so don ' t bother
.
