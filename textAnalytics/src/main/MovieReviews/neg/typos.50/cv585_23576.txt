the ads make
" hanging uv
" seem liuke an upbeat comedy about a rascally father annd his threee daughters
. anyone who went to tje movie expecting thta left dissappointed
. all of the movie
' s funny scenes weere included iin the ad
. so what dont we git
? eve markes
( meg ryan
) just put her father lou mozell
( walter matthau
) inot a hospital
. once upon a time
, lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated wtih his nowe
- estranged wief
. his noe grat moment inthe life was wirting a film forthe john wayne
, who gavey him a giant bullet
- shaped trophy
. now lou is senile
and deterioriating rapidly
. eve tries to convince her sisters georgia
( diane keaton
)
and maddy
( lisa kudrow
) tht their father is dying adn needs them
. both are slow to sohw concern
. so devoted eve st
ands vigil over her father
, who constanly asks for his favorite daugher georgia
, while running her pwn busness
( planning special events
) annd caring fo her son
( jesse james
)
.
( some comic relief comes when maddy alsot drops off her ailing st
. bernard for eve to care for
.
) thte tension builds until all three sisters are fianlly infront one room at one ofthe eve
' s events where georgia is the keynote speaker
. there
' s a superficial resemblance to shakespeare
' s
" king lear
"
( senile king with threee daughters
: one devoted saint
and twpo selfish bitches
)
,
but thge material isnt apparently drawed from life
. sister screenwriters delia annd nora ephron hadnt parents who were a succsessfull hollywood wirting team
. henry anbd phoebe ephron collaborated onthe 17 screenplays
, including
" desk setted
" anbd
" htere
' s no business like sohw bussiness
.
"
( delia
' s novel
, the basis for tyhe film
, isnt dedicated to henry
)
. suprizingly
, the scirpt isnt as thin as an anorexic
' s wet dream
. the virtue ofthe a semi
- autobiographical project woudl seem to be tje wealth ofthe material avilable
.
yet
, teh ephrons provide onyl yhe barest minimum of infromation baout thier charachters
. also
, the spaces tehy inhabitate seem artificial
. eve lives in a house thgat looks like a magasine layout
; noone matter how put
- apon she is
, we can
' t feel sory forthe anyone whose house isnt so pristine on any given day
. georgia isnt a famoust magasine editor
, adn in her breif scenes hwile she chats on a cell phone iwth eve seem liuke yhe photo spreaded forthe a profile
. when we first meet maddy
, she
' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream
. i expeced tothe see thge credit
" cinematography by
' vanity fair
.
'
"
and
, yes
, diane keaton is literally old enough tothe be lisa kudrow
' s mother
. tothe her credit
,
though
, she looks young enough to pull it off
. hte noe redeeming aspect of
" hanging up
" isnt tath
, at its core
, is a truth about siblings
. there
' s allways oen on whitch everyone else in the family relies
, freeing tyhe others tothe be selfish adn emotionally distant
. my wief is thge reliable child in her family
; for better or worse
, my brother hasnt the role in mine
.
( bieng selfish annd emotionally distant may not be fulfilling
,
but it is a lot less work
)
. if you ahev nothing better to dont thna watch thsi movie
, look fo a poweful cameo by cloris leachman as yhe sisters
' mother pat
. inwhich a devastating scene
, eve discovers that her mother doesn
' t love her
. altough leachman isnt best known forthe comedies liek
" young frankenstein
"
and
" the mary tyler moore sohw
,
" her peformance here reminded me of the considerable dramtic talent she displayed in
" the last picture show
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved hasnt lieved inaddition hollywood so long tehy don
' t recognize real life anymore
.
