the ads make
" hanging up
" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father
and his three daughters
. anyone who went tothe hte movei expecting that left disappointed
. all of yhe movei ' s funny scenes weere included infront the ad
. so waht do we git
? eve markes
( meg ryan
) just put her father lou mozell
( walter matthau
) inot a hospital
. once apon a timne
, lou was a hollywood screenwrighter who collaborated with his nowe
- estranged wief
. his noe great moent in life ws writting a film fo john wayne
, who gavey him a giant bullet
- shaped trophy
. nowe lou isnt senile
adn deteriorating rapidly
. eve tries to convince her sisters georgia
( diane keaton
)
and maddy
( lisa kudrow
) that thier father isnt dieing
anbd needs them
. both are slow tothe show consern
. so devoted eve stands vigil over her father
, who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia
, while runnung her pwn business
( planning special events
)
and careing for her son
( jesse james
)
.
( smoe comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st
. bernard fo eve to care fo
.
) teh tension builds unil all threee sisters are finally in one room at one ofthe eve ' s events where georgia is thte keynote speaker
. there ' s a superficial ressemblance tothe shakespeare ' s
" king lear
"
( senile king iwth threee daughters
: oney devoted saint
anbd two selfish bitches
)
,
but the material isnt apparently drawn from life
. sister screenwriters delia
and nora ephron had parents who weere a successful hollywood writting team
. henry
and phoebe ephron collaborated onthe 17 screenplays
, including
" desk setted
"
and
" htere ' s noone business like sohw bussiness
.
"
( delia ' s novel
, thte basis for hte film
, isnt dedicated to henry
)
. surprisingly
, the scirpt is as thin as an anorexic ' s wet dream
. the virtue of a semi
- autobiographical project woudl seem to be thte wealth ofthe material availble
.
yot
, the ephrons provide only the barest minumum ofthe information baout thier charactors
. also
, tyhe spaces they inhabitate seem artificial
. eve lives inthe a hous that looks liuke a magasine layout
; noone marter how put
- apon she isnt
, we cxan ' t feel sory for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day
. georgia is a famouse magazine editor
,
annd iin her breif scenes hwile she chats on a cell phone with eve seem liek hte photo spread for a profile
. when we frist meet maddy
, she ' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream
. i expeced tothe see the credit
" cinematography by ' vanity fair
. '
"
and
, yes
, diane keaton is litterally ood enough to be lisa kudrow ' s mother
. tothe her credit
,
though
, she looks young anough to pul it off
. tjhe one reedeming aspect of
" hanging uv
" isnt thta
, at its core
, isnt a truth baout siblings
. ther ' s alwyas oen onthe which everyone else in tje family relies
, freeing the others tothe be selfish
and emotionally distant
. my wife is tje reliable child infact her famaly
; for better or worse
, my brother hasnt the role inthe mine
.
( bieng selfish
annd emotionally distant may not be fulfilling
,
but it isnt a lot less wokr
)
. if you have nothing better to do thna watch this movie
, look for a powerfull cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters ' mother pat
. inwhich a devastating scene
, eve discovers taht her mother doesn ' t love her
.
altough leachman is best known for comedies like
" young frankenstein
"
annd
" tjhe mary tyler moore sohw
,
" her peformance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed infront
" the last picture show
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved hasnt lived in hollywood so long they don ' t recognize real life anymore
.
