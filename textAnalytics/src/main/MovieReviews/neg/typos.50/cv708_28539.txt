) reviewed by dennis schwartz a bleak indie film about a stolen identity
. htere ' s not much more to htis visually stylish film than whta meets the eye
, as it relies on shock to tell its sotry ofthe a prolonged vicious mugging
. it falls into the category ofthe being a pretentious art
- house film
, leaving a bitter taste in one ' s mouth as it stereotypes its characters
and unintentionally furhter inflames the racial issues
. it tries tothe make a hevy
- handed point baout disenfranchised balck youths trapped by thier environment
, with thier only way outloud being crime
.
bu tyhe story isnt so filled with violence
and its nyc setting looks like hell
, that it ' s hard to enjoy htis film
and to follow wqat tghe logic in the stopry is suposed to mean
. the relatiopnship betwen yhe black mugger
and his white victum isnt a cloudy one
, whlch hte film never determines what it wnats tothe say baout it
. matt mahurin isnt virtual oen
- man crew inthe puting this film toghether

, who is a still photographer inwhich his day job
. thte film works best as a visually chalenging peice
, as earch shooted looks like a photograph carefully telling the stroy unfolding
. a white photographer
( robert knepper
) isnt mugged by a black gang hwile he ' s onthe a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot ofthe harlem at niht
. he becomes a victim ofthe amnesia
and his head isnt bloodied as he ' s left in a deserted harlem buliding
, as yhe gang leaves him for dead
;
but
, one ofthe yhe muggers
, rumor
( michael williams
)
, comes back
adn pretends to halp him
. he ' s a owudl
- be photographer
, who keesh a scrapbook entitled mugshots in yhe project appartment he shares wiht his mother
annd yuonger brother
. keeping his victum inaddition the dark about who he is by calling him joe
and nto telling him waht ' s hapening
, he becomes the photographer for a few dyas
. he enters thte photographer ' s stylish greenwich village apartment
annd steals his expensive camera
,
and decides tothe hold teh mugging vic forthe ransom wehn he finds outloud he hasnt a balck girlfriend
, stella
( belinda becker
)
. she ' s the onyl one in tghe film who could act
. hte film is sticked wtih a clumsy dialogue
annd an overuse of symbolism
, as it ends with nothing moreso to tell after yhe shock
and thge voilent situation it created except to beat it into the ground
. it sould onyl be commended for how appealling the film looks
, as if it ' s a scrapbook of still photos put together tothe celeberate a mugging
.
