. htere
' s nto much omre tothe this visually stylish film than waht meets thte eye
, as it relies on shock tothe tell its story ofthe a prolonged vicious mugging
. it falls inot thte category of bieng a pretentious art
- house film
, leaving a bitter taste in oney
' s mouth as it stereotypes its characters adn unintentionally furuther inflames the racial issues
. it tries to make a hevy
- h
anded point about disenfranchised balck youths trapped by their enviroment
, withthe theri onyl way out being crime
. bu tjhe story isnt so filled whith voilence adn its nyc setting looks liuke hell
, that it
' s hard to enjoy this film
and to follow what the logic in tghe stoyr is suppossed to mean
. the relationship between the balck mugger adn his white victum is a cloudy oney
, which the film never determines what it wants tothe sday about it
. matt mahurin is virtual oney

, stella
( belinda becker
)
. she
' s yhe onyl one in the film who could act
. the film is stuck wtih a clumsy dialogue
and an overuse of symbolism
, as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock
and yhe violent situation it creaeted except tothe beat it inot the ground
. it sould onyl be commended fo how appealing the film looks
, as if it
' s a scrapbook of still photos put toghether tothe celebrate a mugging
