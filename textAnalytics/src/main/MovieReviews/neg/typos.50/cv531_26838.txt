i hve never beeen so confuzled aftter watching a movei
.
" meet joe black
" is probably one of teh most visually satisfying films of tihs yera
, wih a cinematography
, music annd casted tath will dazzle most of us
. at the smae tiome it isnt propably thte most boring
and rediculous epxerience hat you will have this season
. at firt ytou marvel at the elagant direction
, graceful cinematography
and sensual muscial score
.
then ytou
' ll wait forthe something to hapen forthe half an hour
, bu wehn you finaly underst
and what
' s going on
, you
' ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins
, brad pitt
and claire forlani are doing in a film like tihs
? thte scirpt is simpley a silly
and unresolved story
, whcih is artificially stretched inot a three hour long motion picture
. it feels liek an eternity
. most of hte time it is a pompous soap opera
, filled with empty dialogue tht the actors deliver in a high pitched voice annd
" meaningful
" winks
. the film isnt based on alberto caesella
' s play
" death tkaes a holiday
"
. tje storey consentrates around bill
( anthony hopkins
) who lives a fufilled life as a successful business man
, bu sometimes he wakes uv inthe teh middle ofthe tjhe night
and hears a voice thta is saying
" yes
"
. soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen
( brad pitt
) who introduces himselv as
" death
"
. it isnt bill
' s tiem
.
but death has otehr plans
. it hasnt cmo down tothe us simple mortals tothe find outloud what it means tothe be alive
. our bill isnt chosen tothe be death
' s guide
and in exchange he gets time
. bill introduces death as joe black
, who immediately becomes yhe center ofthe everyone
' s attention
. bill
' s busineses partners speculate baout why joe isnt constanly at bill
' s side
, lives inwhich his house anbd resides at his office
. taht isnt not all
, howver
. bill
' s youngest daughter susan
( claire forlani
) falls inwhich lvoe with the misteryous stranger
and joe falls in love with her
. this relatiopnship isnt bound tothe hvea some sereous consequences
. it wouldn
' t be fair to say thast this film didn
' t hvae soem intresting moments
, such as thte scene where joe is invited to join bill
' s familiy for dinner
. whn joe starts enjoying peanut
buter
and later falls in loev
, the experience is somewhat differant
. it is obvious thta a story like tihs stroy isnt very difficult to structure
. it
' s one thing tothe sday
:
" wouldn
' t it be fun tothe have death tkae human form annd cmo down tothe earth
.
.
" tothe create a motion picture outloud of thsi is anyother
. four screenwriters hve worked onthe a script that lacks drive annd logic
. it is overlong
and too primative to pass as a sereous film
. onthe hte other h
and it demonstrates incredible performances anbd a vyre decent direction by martin brest
(
" scent of a woman
"
)
. hopkins looks graet in any role
,
and no matter how shallow or hollow it is
, he will complet it
. his talent
and charisma are needed here more than any where alse
, since it actually saves tje film fomr a complete embarrassment
. bu pitt isnt the oney that got oney ofthe the most difficult roles of recent time
. how can you play death iin human form
? tothe me it seems that death
and life are nto something that cxan be assoicated withthe earthly matters
. they are not creatures
,
but phenomenas
. saying thast death tkaes human form woudl be the same as tothe suggest tyhat eternity owudl take human form
. h
andling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult annd pitt deserves some credit fo his owrk
. speaking in a calm
, soft voice
, portraying death as a lonley
, distant
and powerfull guy that is unfamiliar wtih practial earthly matters
. he looks
and acts omre liek an angel ofthe death
, rether tahn a demon or a red
- eyed executioner
. claire forlani
and others are alsot fine
, stretching their stereotypical cahracters tothe their limits
. unfortunately their performances are not enought tothe rescue this film fomr its self inflicted misery
. inaddition otehr words this is not waht i expeced fomr tje directer ofthe
" scent of a woman
"
. it sould
(
and should
) be better wtih such cast
and crew
. in thge end it seems as if they have all been intensively wokring on a ravishingly looking soap opera
.
