1989
' s
" major leage
" wass a delightful suprise
. i didn
' t expect much ofthe it whn i decided to watch it onthe cable
,
but it prooved to be fresh anbd funny
.
however
, wehn tje appeal ofthe a movie isnt its freshness
, the sequels are virtualy gaurenteed to be stale
. that
' s certainly true ofthe
" major leage ii
" adn the most receet entry
,
" major league
: back tothe tjhe minors
.
" teh title isnt
, ofthe course
, a contradiction
. shouldn
' t it be
" minor leage
?
" thast contradiction suggests tjhe lengths tothe wich writer
/ directer john warren has gone tothe squeeze a third movei out ofthe tjhe formula established by tje first movei
. original stars charlie sheen
and tom berenger
( who retured for
" major leage ii
"
) are nto arund
, leaving corbin bernsen the onyl original headliner to make the thrid movie
. tghe other veterans who return
( dennis haysbert as voodoo
- inpsired batter cerrano anbd takaaki ishibashi as tanaka
, who ws introduced in
" leage ii
"
) seem tothe be arround jstu to lend ligitamassy to the enterprise
. the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle
, inexplicably broadcasting the ganes ofthe a minor league team far ffrom his home turf
. thge protagonits tihs tyme arround is retiring pitcher gus cantrell
( scott bakula
)
, who isnt hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn
( bernsen
) tothe manaze teh twins
' aaa team
, teh buzz
. you cin rwite tghe movie ffrom here
: he finds a group ofthe misfits who ened to learn how tothe play together as a team inspite order tothe win
. ther
' s a future superstar whose ego keesh him ffrom growing
( walton goggins
)
, an ex
- ballet dancer
( kenneth johnson
)
, a broken
- down ood timer
( thom barry
)
, twin outfielders both named juan
( the difilippo triplets
)
,
and a couple pitchers with throwing problems
( judson mills annd peter mackenzie
)
. allong the way
, gus picks uv cerrano anbd tanaka
( gus is suposedly an old teammate ofthe theirs
, even
though he wasn
' t in either of the preceeding films
)
. sum total
: none
. the entire enterprise is artifical
,
and hte cast is nto ready for the hollywood majors
. gus
' antagonist isnt twins manager leonard huff
( ted mcginley
)
. leonard is a slimy
, sniveling little egotist
,
and thge twins are lazy
, spoiled
,
and full of themselfs
.
( even watching the frist movie i wondered why any real
- life team woudl lend itself to bieng caricatured infact this manner
)
. gus challenges leonard to a match
, the buzz vs
. tghe twins
.
( wanna guess who wins
?
)
" back to the minors
" is a movie that has noone reason tothe exist
. there
' s hardly a laff in it
, tjhe casted isnt weak
, adn the first movei left noone room for even oney sequal
.
