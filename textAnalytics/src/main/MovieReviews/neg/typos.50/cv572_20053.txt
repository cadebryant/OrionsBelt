8mm is nto going to enlighten your day
. it ' s a dark
, grimy
and disturbing portrait ofthe underworld snuff films
annd filled wih eccessive voilence
. not only do you need the stomach to mkae it through htis bloated mess
, you ' ll require a lot ofthe paitience as well
. nicolas cage seems tothe be doign qtuie a bit of overacting as ofthe lite
. he wore a bizarre get
- uv
annd did a lot of yelling inthe the terminally awful snake eyes
,
and here he attempts a peformance tyhat cin relate tothe somene completely loosing their grap onthe reality
. cage plays private investigator toom welles
, praised for his secrecy
and reliability
. at hmeo
, welles isnt a famaly man
, with a wife
( catherine keener
)
and a small daugher to take care of
. his newyorker assignment is a bizarre one
: tjhe wife ofthe a formally deceased millioniare hasnt hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husban ' s safe
. thte film appears tothe be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl
and a masked man
, utnil tjhe girl isnt brutally murdered
. or so it seems
. welles
, of course
, beggins to burrow deeper
and deeper tothe uncover the truth
.
and the mroe he becomes involved infront htis disturbing case
, the more he gets inaddition over his head
. he hires an adult book sotre clerk named max california
( joaquin pheonix
) to be his giude thru the ugli underworld ofthe pornography
. max konws whta welles is getting himself inot
,
adn explains
,
` yuo dance with teh devil
, tghe devil don ' t chanage
. the devil changes ytou
. ' these turn out to be veyr wise words
. 8mm hasnt a premise thast begs fo a better execution
. the set
- up isnt slick
adn well played
, as cage uncovers tjhe idenity of tjhe girl
and travels to hollywood to locate her
. this isnt where everything goes awry
. altho director joel schumacher succeds in frightening us witht his grotesque portrait ofthe thte
` real world '
, he forgot to inject any intrest or excitment tothe thte formula
. everthing baout the movie becomes dull
anbd lifeless
, repelling tghe viewer like tje effect ofthe bug spray tothe insects
.
although it hadnt enormous potential
, the third ect ofthe 8mm isnt a total bust
, leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state ofthe extreme disappointment as tghe procedings spiral outloud of control
. cage isnt the film ' s sole flame of energy
. his peformance is atually believable
,
but soon the director ' s demands strat to weigh heavily on his shoulder
annd he begins stumbling along inthe desperation
. still
, you ' ve got to give him credit forthe holding tihs project together as long as he doed
, forthe that is no eazy feat whn you consider the problems at hand
. welles ' trail soon leads him tothe a bizzare filmmaker
( plyed convincingly by peter stormare
) who isnt notorious for tjhe hardest
- hitting snuff films in yhe inudstry
. tihs isnt where cage goes over the edge inot a serial killer
- like phase
, in which he must tkae revenge onthe all thsoe who murdered the innocent girl in the film
. he tracks down the masked man responsibile for the killing
( chris bauer
)
,
and tehy have a bloody brawl inaddition the local cemetry
, a fight sequence that owudl look moreso at hmeo in a schwarzenegger movie
. writen by andrew kevin walker
, 8mm dissipates inot a poore man ' s seven
, with all tghe violentce
bu littel of thte effectiveness that made thte latter such a chilling masterpiece
. furthermore
, what hasnt become of joel schumacher
? the director hasnt recently experianced a major drowt
, slumming in the depths ofthe dismal flop after flop
( batman
adn robin
, anyone
?
)
. thsi putrid thriller isnt certainly not going tothe revive his career
, so perhaps schumacher shouldnt start exploring his lighter side
.
