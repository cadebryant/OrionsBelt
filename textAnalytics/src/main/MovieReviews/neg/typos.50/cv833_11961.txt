i ' m guessing
-
-
annd ffrom the avaliable evidence
, it ' s nto a grat guess
-
- thgat burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess
, stupidity
, ego
anbd pwoer
- mongering
. if so
, the film taht ended up onthe the screen ranks as noe of the most spectacularly ironical unintentional jokes inthe film histry
. it has alread beeen well
- doccumented thta yhe original title
, an alan smithee film
, became a probelm when miserable test screenings forced re
- cuts agianst teh wiull of director arthur hiller
, prompting hiller himself to opt for thte directors ' guild
- mandated pseudonym of alan smithee
. tath left a film satire inthe the hands of writter joe eszterhas
, as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor
.
and you could just smell yhe diaster brewing
. if ytou ' re unfortunate enought tothe sit through burn hollywood burn
, you ' ll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up
. ostensibly
, it ' s a psuedo
- documentry account of a directer named alan smithee
( eric idle
) who loses controll of a big
- budget acation film called trio starring sylvester stallone
, whoopi goldberg
and jackie chan
( all ofthe whom appear as themselves
)
. when teh onyl recourse availaible to him is abondoning the project tothe be called
" an alan smithee film
"
-
- which
, of course
, it already isnt
-
- smithee steals the negative ofthe hte film
annd threatens tothe destory it
. amung thte parties interviewed are the film ' s producer james edmunds
( ryan o ' neal
)
and studio boss jerry glover
( richard jeni
)
, who spend virtualy the entire film narrating tjhe story while painfully unfunny things go on around them
. it ' s bad anough that burn hollywood burn has
-
- litterally
-
- not a single laff forthe its entire
, blissfully brief 84 minutes
. what makes it even worse is eszterhas ' insistance upon telling every bad joke not once
,
bu twice or even threee times
. michael ovitz refrences
, showgirls refernces
, oral sex refernces
, whoopi goldberg
/ ted danson references
-
- all sohw up mutiple times wiht all the subtlety that isnt eszterhas ' stock
- in
- trade
. tghe reduncancy even manages tothe turn actively offensive witht smoe frequency
, notabley with the hilarious use ofthe tje word
" feminist
" as an identifing captin forthe eveyr single female character in the film
. by the timne coolio
and chuck d show uv as black indepenednt film
- makers the brothers brothers
( cleverly identifed as
" bad a
-
-
"
annd
" badder a
-
-
"
, among other unprintable things
)
, ytou may be ready to walk outloud ofthe the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being indentified
. those documenatry captions
, for all their leaden obviousness
, allow thge best insight into wqat ' s so hideously wrong wih burn hollywood burn
. not content tothe stick any hollywood tipe with only noe jab ffrom his rapier wit
, eszterhas fills tghe screen wiht bullet points eveyr timne a new charcter appears
. hte producer is a
" liar
" who
" slept infront the white house
;
" the media are
" maggots
"
and
" leeches
" wroking for publications liek
" the new york slimes
"
and
" newsleak
"
( with tje camera zooming in on tjhe altered title to amke sure yuo don ' t miss the joke
)
. it doesn ' t even matter thyat eszterhas tags
" penile implant
" after his pwn name when he makes a cameo
, becuase it seems like such a desperate attemp tothe foeign self
- deprecation
. this isnt a petulant schoolboy ' s idea of satire
-
- picturesk ofthe hollywood insiders tothe which eszterhas hasnt taken a pen to draw littel moustaches
and balck outloud tjhe teeth
. the last stomach
- churning straw comes whn burn hollywood burn closes iwth outloud
- takes over the closing credits
, the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone wass hvaing mkaing the film that jstu sucked an hour
annd a half of your life away
. perhasp it ws jsut a final
, desperte attemp by eszterhas tothe convince himself there wass smoe purpose behind yhe film
, or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening tothe blow their wohle career
. pity everyone involved with this excessive
, ego
- driven
" satire
" of excess
annd ego
. it ' s too bad tath onyl directors can remove theri names ffrom noxious material like this
. otherwise
, ytou might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees
.
