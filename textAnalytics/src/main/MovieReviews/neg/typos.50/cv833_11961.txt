i
' m guessing
-
- annd from the availaible evidence
, it
' s not a great guess
-
- tath burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess
, stupidity
, ego anbd pwoer
- mongering
. if so
, the film that ended uv on tje screen ranks as one ofthe yhe most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history
. it has already beeen well
- doccumented that tyhe original title
, an alan smithee film
, became a probelm wehn miserable tust screenings forced re
- cuts against the will of director arthur hiller
, prompting hiller hismelf to opt for hte directors
' guild
- m
andated sewdonim of alan smithee
. that left a film satire in the h
ands of writer joe eszterhas
, as humorless a hack as ever put finger to owrd processer
. adn yuo could jstu smell thge diaster brewing
. if you
' re unfortunate enough tothe sit thru burn hollywood burn
, yuo
' ll still be smelling that diaster long aftter yhe lights come uv
. ostensibly
, it
' s a psuedo
- documentary account ofthe a director named alan smithee
( eric idle
) who loses controll ofthe a big
- budget acation film called trio starring sylvester stallone
, whoopi goldberg
and jackie chan
( all of whom apeared as themselfs
)
. wehn the onyl recourse available to him isnt abondoning tghe project to be called
" an alan smithee film
"
-
- which
, ofthe course
, it arleady is
-
- smithee steals tghe negitive of tyhe film
and threatens tothe distroy it
. among tghe parties interviewed are tjhe film
' s producer james edmunds
( ryan o
' neal
)
and studio boss jerry glover
( richard jeni
)
, who spend virtually the entire film narrating the sotry while painfully unfunny thigns go on around them
. it
' s bad anough that burn hollywood burn hasnt
-
- literally
-
- not a single laff forthe its entire
, blissfully breef 84 minutes
. whta makes it even worse is eszterhas
' insistence upon telling eveyr bad joke not once
,
but twice or even threee times
. michael ovitz refrences
, showgirls refernces
, oral sex refrences
, whoopi goldberg
/ ted danson references
-
- all sohw uv mutiple times with all the subtlety that isnt eszterhas
' stock
- in
- trade
. the reduncancy even manages tothe turn actively offensive wiht soem frequency
, notabley with the hillarious ule ofthe the word
" feminist
" as an identifing caption for every single female chracter in the film
. by tyhe time coolio
and chuck d sohw uv as black indepedent film
- makers yhe brothers brothers
( cleverly indentified as
" bad a
-
-
"
and
" badder a
-
-
"
, among otehr unprintable things
)
, yuo may be ready to walk out of the theather with your coat over your head to avoid bieng identifed
. those documentary captions
, fo all thier leaden obviousness
, allow yhe best insight into what
' s so hideously wrong witht burn hollywood burn
. nto content tothe stick any hollywood type with only noe jab from his rapier witn
, eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every tiem a new character appears
. thge producer isnt a
" liar
" who
" slept infact the white house
;
" the media are
" maggots
" anbd
" leeches
" wokring fo publications like
" tyhe newyorker york slimes
" anbd
" newsleak
"
( with the camera zooming in onthe hte altered title to amking sure you don
' t miss the joke
)
. it doesn
' t even marter thta eszterhas tags
" penile implant
" affter his pwn name wehn he makes a cameo
, becouse it seems liek such a desprate attemp tothe feign self
- deprecation
. htis is a petulant schoolboy
' s idae ofthe satire
-
- picturesk ofthe hollywood insiders tothe which eszterhas has taken a pen tothe draw littel moustaches anbd balck outloud tje teeth
. tje lastr stomach
- churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with outloud
- takes over yhe closing credits
, the kind that show teh audiance how much funn everyone wass haveing making yhe film thta just sucked an hour
and a half ofthe your life away
. perhaps it was just a fianl
, desperate attept by eszterhas tothe convince hismelf there was soem purpose behind the film
, or to convince everyone involved that a faw blown lines warranted threatening tothe blow their whole career
. pity everyone involved wiht thsi eccessive
, ego
- driven
" satire
" ofthe excess
and ego
. it
' s too bad thta only directors can remove theri names from noxious material liek thsi
. otherwise
, you might have seen credits forthe burn hollywood burn overflowing witht alan smithees
.
