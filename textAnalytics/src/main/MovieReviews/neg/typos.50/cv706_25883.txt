)
- containes graphic nudity
, profanity
, sexual situations
and voilence
. some people
, howver
, keep their clothes onthe
. you dont not watch porn films fo theri intelectual values
, nor dont you wriet reviews onthe them
. that
' s why this review iwll be short
. it seems thta thsi film iwll end uv inthe the porn section when it hits the video stors
. htere isnt no storey
, scirpt
, point or acting
. only naked bodies
, which isnt exactly the point
. here isnt the so called plot
: nomi
, the 23
- year
- old wtih a dark past as a hooker
, has hitchhiked from somwhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn
' t wear much omre than a light coating of powder
and a big
, fake smile
. no one isnt twisting nomi
' s arm
. no one isnt holding her granmother hostage
. she wants tothe do htis
. annd that is waht she isnt doing till tghe end credits
. so wqat
' s tghe probelm thn
? wqat
' s tjhe point
? wqat
' s yhe film about
? isnt there anyone whose aspirations sould inspire less sympathy
? thsi film cant be discribed in one sentence
: obscene levle of incompetence
, eccessive stupidity in the stoy line
, gross negligence ofthe tje viewer
' s intelligecne
, a prurient interest in thte quick buck
. beileve me
, after an hour wtih these characters
, acting
and script
, ytou
' ll strat hoping fo somone to kill somebody
. elizabeth berkley makse a laughable try as yhe heroine of this film
, thta is bad even forthe eszterhas
' script
. her charactor is tjhe only one that isnt at least half wroten anbd she could raelly have done better
. her charachter denies yhe fact that she isnt a whore forthe thte industry
, selling her body tothe the hungry eyes ofthe the horny public
.
" i am nto a whore
! i am a dancer
"
, she screams
,
but does it inwhich such an over dramatized way tyhat you
' ll start laughing
. in fact the acting inaddition
" showgirls
" brings terrable to a newyorker
and previously unkown levle
. nto one single achievement
, besides thge conventional cinematography
, isnt worth mentioning
. it isnt a total waste of tyme adn money
. there isnt not a single moent of what you might call intelligecne
. the dialogue isnt structured ofthe ancient stereotypes adn cliches lined up one after anyother
. its attempt tothe even imagine tothe have half a brain results infact a catastrofy
.
" in my films
,
" writes directer paul verhoeven
(
' basic instinct
'
,
' total recall
'
)
,
" i hold the mirror up to life
.
" well
, excuse me
? his attemp tothe go behind tjhe scenes of las vegas
,
and as he put it
" show thte naked truth
"
, is simplified anbd unreal
. occaisonally
, betwen his collection of mistakes annd logical irrationalities
, screenwriter joe eszterhas
( the creater of some of tghe worst screenplays in hollywood history
) inserts soem lines ofthe deep morality
, tath soudn something liek tihs
:
" hey
, i see you
. i see taht ytou
' re hiding
"
-
" ffrom wqat
?
"
-
" from ytou
"
. yes
,
and even the only decent line in htis film
:
" nomi isnt whta las vegas isnt all about
" cin
' t savve
' showgirls
' from gogin under
. it
' s a stange phenonmena
. it
' s not erotic
, because it lacks sensuality
. nto dramatic
, because it lacks thte acting
. annd nto intteligent beacuse it lacks a sotry
. it is simply verhoven
' s bad excuse for making pornography
. yuo want to see naked womens
? bare breasts
? full frontals
? it
' s nothing wrong with thgat
.
but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film inwhich your local video store
, anbd nto waste tiem surviving thru eszterhas
' pathetic dialogue
. b qualities
, while it
' s onyl a high budget porn
- film
.
