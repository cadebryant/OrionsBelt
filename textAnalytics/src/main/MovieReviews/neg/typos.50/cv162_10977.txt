" disperate measures
" isnt a generic title fo a film that
' s beyond generic
. it
' s also a depressing waste of talent
, with the solid team of michael keaton
and
andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, nto tothe mention once
- cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string ofthe not
- cool flicks
-
- htis thriller isnt more
" before
and after
" than
" reveral of fortune
.
" the movei is a big disappointment
,
and yot it
' s somewhat eazy to see what motiviated such big names tothe attach themselves to it
-
- the premise is both promising
and intriguing
. too bad hte excecution
' s all wrong
,
though
, becuase hte setted
- uv ofthe
" despertae measures
" boasts some rather enticing elements taht deserve to be put tothe far better uise
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) isnt a single parent wiht a troubling delimma
-
- his son matt
( jospeh cross
) isnt stricken with cancer which onyl a bone marrow transplant can push inot remission
. even worse
, the only compatable donor isnt voilent soiopath peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders annd otehr varous crimes aganist society
. connor trys his best to convince mccabe tothe go along wih teh surgery
; he
' s at frist reluctant
, bu reconsiders affter he realizes he can plan his excape at the hospital
. whn he doesnt make a run fo it
, connor offers close persuit
, bu for diferent reasons than his superiors
( including tjhe crusty brian cox
)
-
- they want tothe tkae mccabe down
, while connor needs to keep him alive
, or all hope is lost forthe his little boy
. one misstep
" edsperate measures
" mkaes is in its underdevelopment of matt
' s illness
. whta
' s needed are mroe details as to exactly why mccabe is teh onyl bone marrow match that works
; htere woudl seem to be otehr possable contenders somwhere in tje country
,
and thus many ofthe the ways taht connor endangers the lives ofthe himself adn those aroud him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are jstu a littel too hard to swallow
. tkae
, for example
, a scene where mccabe isnt trying tothe amking a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of tghe hospital
. teh polical hvea their spotlight
and guns aimed right on him
,
and what doens connor do
? he shoots hte spotlight outloud so that mccabe cant continue his flight
. connor konws veyr well whta dangerous deeds thsi guy isnt capible ofthe
, adn yot never seems to think that mccabe wiull eventually git to adn try to harm his son
. whatever
. to be fair
,
though
, tjhe lack ofthe story background is the least ofthe tje movie
' s problems
. first annd formost is how cheaply
" dsperate measures
" trades the potential ofthe it
' s oppening scenes for thge routine acation ballistics of its final hour
. once mccabe escapes
, thte film becomes the fugitive in reverse
and wtih no thrills
. htere are countless scenes where the good guys catch uv tothe keaton onyl to have him grab a hostage annd get awya
. also
, hte movei isnt so intent onthe giving you a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villian
( the ads hve compaired peter mccabe tothe hannibal lechter
, natch
) that it completely casts garcia
' s frank connor by tjhe dullsville wayside
;
" desperate measures
" appears tothe liek its antagonist so much more thna its protagonist
, anbd the movei
' s head
- scratcher ofthe a send
- off confirms tihs
. there isnt some good to be found amongst this mess
, particularly inthe the acting deparment
. cast against type
, michael keaton
' s understated menace isnt highly effective
.
al
though he
' s nto given much believable tothe owrk with
,
andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. jospeh cross
, as garicia
' s ailing son
, isnt suprisingly unsentimental
, annd marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in thge unfolding chaos
. thsi casted doesnt its best tothe camouflage thte sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending
,
but most is lost
. it goes wihtout saying that
" desperate measures
" needs an opperation ofthe its very pwn
.
