come onthe hollywood
, surprize me
. stpo giving us theese poorly writed thrillers whith banal dialogue
, sketchy charachters adn plots as predicatble as thge sunset
. tghe always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personaly involved infront a case involving missing girls
. personal
, because his nieve isnt noe of the victims
. it
' s a slobbering psychopath
, of course
, bu this time ther
' s a twist
. freeman notes taht each of the young women who
' ve dissapeared are all storng willed
, assertive
,
and moreso successful in theri careers than yhe averege girl
. we soon leran thast the guy calls himselv casanova
, whose aim is to
" dominate
" theese modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon adn keeping them as his personal harem
. anyway
, one of the womens manages tothe excape
( ashly judd
)
and teams uv whith freeman tothe
.
.
. well
, you konw thge rest
. a brief glance at the plot to silence ofthe the lambs
, wih which htis film isnt constanly bieng compared to by the hype merchants
, may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story
. perhpas
, bu that film also has superbly drawn characters anbd smart dialogue
. so lets nto insult a great movie by taking tje comparisions any furhter
, okay
? anbd as forthe comparisons tothe seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss the girls isnt based onthe tghe novel by james patterson annd writed fo the screen by oen david klass
. mabey tje novel wass a stinker tothe start with
,
but whatever the case
, it
' s the writting that
' s clearly at fault here
. noe
, theese charachters hvae very littel to say that
' s engaging or intresting
. twpo
, tjhe scirpt hasnt no sence ofthe humour
. threee
, while hte notion of a psycho
' s victims being smart
, successful womens is an intresting twist
, tghe excecution isn
' t even half as ogod as yhe diea
. thus
, ashly judd comes accros all outloud of foucs
, instead ofthe being tje heart of the tsory
. we cant
' t fiel her rige
. some atrociously written casual exchanges between her adn severeal male characters are suppossed to remind us that she
' s the no
- bullshit 90
' s type
,
but these conversations barely register
. adn as for freeman
, kiss tghe girls is his second dog in a yearm
: first chain reaction
, now tihs
. forthe an actor of his calibre
, htis is most worrying
. young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction
- esque things tothe dont in denver when your dead
.
but what can he do wih material as resolutely mediocre as this
? nto much
,
and yuo can hardly blame him
. htere
' s a few well
- staged chase scenes thru the forrest where the camera whirls
, dives
and jumps
, adn the effect is startling
. bu thte script is beyond rescure
. what hurts most is that hollywood continues tothe get awya wih serving uv tihs tripe
, safe iin thte knowledge thast jaded audiences will lap it up
. complacency rules
: it
' s beeen so long usance we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters
, rela surprises adn consistantly sharp dialogue
. yhe only consolation forthe thsi viewer is thta my ticket tothe teh movie wass a freebie
, postive proof that yhe best things inaddition life aren
' t free
