okay
, okay
. maybee i wasn
' t iin the mood to watch a mindless acation movei
; i am the smae person that liekd lethal weppon iii
, even while admitting that it wasn
' t as good as the others
. howewer
, the latest segal picture didn
' t look thta bad
,
and usance none of my friends woudl go see a woody allen movei even if i payed them
, i whent tothe see it expecting a mild dieu hard rehash
. boy
, ws i wrong
! in yhe firt half of the movie
, we are lready assaulted with segal
' s acting
,
( he isnt nto simpley wooden
; he isnt like a wall
)
, gratuitous voilence
, an incredible plot
, sexist adn even more gratuitious nudity
, annd bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes
. by hte end
, it isnt obvious that hundreds of navy men are noone match fo thirty armed speical forces soliders
. not once in the movei did segal appear worried or undecided
, which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense
. of course
, inaddition movies liek theese
, ther must be a sidekick
, adn a love interest
. iin theese one we are given a two fo noe package in tjhe form ofthe a playboy model
( in tghe movei
)
, which onyl functions as a suppoed comic relief
( by hte way of extremely stupid unfunny lines
)
, annd to ahev watering eyes annd look away every time something bad happens in the movie
. oh
, ofthe course
, she appears naked from tyhe waist up
,
and
, of course
, segal kisses her at thte end affter no development of theri relatiopnship
; they doed not even seem tothe be intersted inthe earch otehr
. i hve never seen so littel chemestry beween two people iin a movei
. often
, yhe villian saves hte movie
; unfourtunately
, the villains here are cartoonish
, stupid
and unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies have psycho ex
- speshal forces bad guys
? too many
. i was able to predict hte acation all throughtout teh movei
, including thge moment where the sidekick saves tje hero ffrom certain death
, tyhe scene where the bad guy cin kill thge hero bu procedes to explain his plan tothe him
, teh scene where we are shown thte hero
' s superiors are stupid
, the scene where tjhe bad guy loses his gun anbd has tothe fight tjhe hero h
and to h
and
, etc
.
.
. simpley said
, thsi is movei
- making by the numbers
, boring
, anbd potentially offensive infront oging forthe tjhe lowest common denominator ofthe yhe audeince
. my recommendation
: if you go see it
, bring a watch
. you
' ll be looking at it forthe most of the movei
. my
. rent dieu hard
. read a book
. stare at yhe sky
. dont not waste your time onthe thsi worthless piece ofthe celluloid
. the rela sad thing isnt tath there are a lot ofthe movies out thgat i would rather hvea seen
; once again
, dragged in by my firends
, which by the way
, liekd the movie halfheartedly
. they probaly like wrestling too
