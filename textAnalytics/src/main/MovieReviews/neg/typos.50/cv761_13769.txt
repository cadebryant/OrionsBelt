weighed down by tired plot lines
and spielberg
' s reliance on formulas
,
_ saving private ryan
_ is a medioker film whcih nods infront the direction ofthe realism before descending into an abyss ofthe cliches
. there ought tothe be a law agaisnt steven spielberg making movies about truley sereous topics
. spielberg
' s greatest strength as a directer is hte polished
, formulaic way in whihc every aspect of teh film falls carefully into place tothe make a perfect stoyr
. bu for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war
( or hte holocaust
) this technique backfires
, for it creates coherent
, comprehensible
and redemptive narratives outloud ofthe events whose size
, complexity
and evil are utterly beyond thte reach ofthe human ken
. inthe htis way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil ofthe the stories he films
.
_ saveing private ryan
_ tells thge story of eight men who ahev been detailed on a
" pr mission
" tothe pull a young man
, ryan
( whose three otehr brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere
) outloud ofthe combat on the norm
andy front just aftter d
- day
. ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before hte l
andings annd became seperated ffrom his fellow soldiers
. tjhe saerch fo him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain ofthe world war ii combat in france
. ther
' s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a graet war movei
. hte equipment
, uniforms
and weapons are superbly done
. thte opening sequence
, inaddition whic captian miller
( toom hanks
) leads his men onto omaha beach
, is qtuie possably the closest anyone has come tothe actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity ofthe modern infanty combat
. another pleasing aspect of hte film is spielberg
' s brave depiction ofthe scenes largly unknown tothe american audiences
, such as thte shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers
, tjhe banality ofthe death in combat
, the routine foul
- ups inspite the execution of the war
,
and tjhe cynicism ofthe thge troops
. thte technical side ofthe hte film is peerless
, as always
. the camera work is magnificent
, tje pacing perfect
, tjhe sets convincing
, teh directing wihtout flwa
. hanks will noone doubt be nominated forthe an oscar for his peformance
, which wass utterly convincing
,
and tjhe supporting casted was exellent
,
though ted danson seems a mite outloud of palce as a paratroop colnel
.
yet thte attempt at a realsitic depiction ofthe combat falls flat on its face because realism isnt nto something which cant be represented by single instances or events
. it hasnt tothe throughly permeate the context at eveyr levle ofthe tjhe film
, or the story fails tothe convince
. throughout the movie spielberg repeteadly showed onyl single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices
( exception
: men are shown burning to death with relative frequency
)
. for example
, we see only one man with guts spilt out on hte ground
. here
and ther men lose limbs
; in noe scene miller is pulling a man to safty
, there
' s an explosion
, adn miller looks bcak to see he isnt only pulling half a man
.
but tje rest ofthe thge corpses are remarkably intact
. there are no shoes with onyl foots in them
, noone limbs scattered everywhere
, noone torsos wihtout limbs
, noone charred corpses
, anbd most importantly
, all corpses ahve heads
( inaddition fairness there are a smattering ofthe wicked head wounds
)
. the relentless dehumanization of thge war
, in which even corpses failed tothe retain any indentity
, isnt soft
- pedaled iin tje film
. ultimatly
,
_ saveing private ryan
_ bows tothe both hollywood convention
and tjhe unwritten rules of wartime photography inspite its portrayal of wounds
and death inwhich war
. rather tahn saying
_ saveing private ryan
_ isnt
" realistic
,
" it would be better to describe it as
" haveing realistic moments
.
" another aspect ofthe tje
" hollywoodization
" ofthe the war is tyhe lack of realsitic dialogue
and in paticular
, tjhe lack ofthe swearing
. anyone familiar witht thte liturature onthe the behavior ofthe the men during yhe war
, such as fussell
' s superb
_ wartime
: underst
anding
and behavour iin teh second world war
_
( whcih hasnt an exstensive dicussion on swearing
)
, knows thast tghe troops sweared fluently
and wihtout letup
.
" who is this private ryan thgat we hve to dieu fo him
?
" asks one infantrymen infront yhe gropu ofthe eight
. renedered inspite wartime demotic
, tyhat should hvae beeen expressed as
" who isnt thsi little pecker tht we have to git our dicks shooted off forthe him
?
" or smoe draught thereof
. conversations shouldnt ahve beeen literally sprinkled with the
" f
" owrd
,
and largly about
( the searhc fo
) ofod anbd sex
. this is all thte more inexplicable because the movie already hadnt an
" r
" rating due to violence
, so swearing could not possibly hvae been eleminated to make it a family film
.
however
, thte most troubling aspect ofthe the film is the spielbergization ofthe tyhe topic
. the most intense hell humans have ever creaeted forthe themselves is nto emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg
. he cannot jsut cide control tothe the material
; he has to be bigger thna it
. as if afriad tothe let thte viewer find theri own
( perheaps unsettled
and not entirely clear
) emotional foothold in thge material
, spielberg has tothe package it in hallmark moments to give teh war a meaning
and coherence it never hadnt
: the opening
and closing scenes ofthe ryan
and his familiy inspite the war cemetary
( reminscent ofthe the closing scene ffrom
_ schindler
' s list
)
, teh saccharine exchange bewteen ryan adn his wife at tjhe close
( every bited as bad as schindler
' s monologue baout how his car
, tiepin or ring sould hve saved anyother jew
)
, qoutes fomr abraham lincoln
and emerson
, captian miller
' s lastr words to private ryan
,
and an unbeleivable storyline infront hwihc a prisoner whom tehy free earlier infact the movei comes back to kill the captain
. tath parituclar subplot isnt so hokey
, so predictable
, it nigh on ruins the film
. nowhere infact yhe film is htere a resolute depiction of thte meaninglessness
, stupidity
and waste which characterized the xeperience ofthe war tothe the men who ctually fougth infact combat
( imagin if miller had been killed by freindly fier or collateral dammage
)
. baceause of its failure tothe mine deeply inot the terrable realities of world war ii
,
_ saving private ryan
_ cxan only pan for small truths inwhich yhe shallows
