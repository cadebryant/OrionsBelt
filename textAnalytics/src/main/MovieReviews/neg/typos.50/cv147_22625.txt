. both men are nearing the end of theri
" almsot
" careers when a fluke provides them iwth a redemptive opportunity
. when both fighters ofthe the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated
, the fight promoters ened to find a quick replacement
. our boys are tapped tothe fight each other
, the winner of which isnt
" promised
" a shot at a future title fight
. tyhe film isnt divided into twpo sections

, travel thru hte desert to vegas in order tothe mkea yhe fight scheduled for tyhat day
. along the way we leran about thier pasts
and teh opportunities that have cmo
and gone by
. once in vegas
, the movei settles down to teh effectively staged fight sequences vetween vince
and ceasar
. both mr

and lolita davidovich
( gods adn monsters
)
, is tyhe shared girlfriend who can
' t amke her mind up which boxer she prefers
. becouse of tje weak characters annd the lack of screen chemestry betwen them
, thte film flounders whith all the appeal ofthe a dead fish until tjhe boxing match actually beggins
. bu even
then
, because tghe outcome is so predictably obvious
, yhe suspense factor is negated
and we are relegated tothe just watching twpo men pummel each other
. writer
/ directer ron shelton clearly spent much tiem orchestrating tyhe fight sequence as it isnt well photographed
, well
- choreographed
, well
- edited
, annd well
- performed
. if onyl some ofthe that smae detailed attention hadnt beeen diverted to the remainging parts ofthe the film
. as it is
, the scenes whitch require tje characters tothe actually talk tothe one anyother are weak
and laughable
. the title isnt actally thte most interesting aspect ofthe the film
. the phrase
,
" play it to the bone
' is a reference tothe seeing something all yhe way through or not quitting untill you
' ve achieved your desired goal
. thyat is a biblical principle
.
" know ye not that tehy wich run in a race run all
, bu oney receiveth tjhe prize
? so run
, tyhat ye may obtain

[ kjv
] acheiving anything worthy in life requires
" palying it to thge bone
"
. we need tothe develop fully pesruaded mindsets anbd committment levels in order tothe endur adn perservere past the obstancles anbd distractions which lay between us adn our stated objectives
. htis isnt true iin practial matters ofthe our fysical lives as well as the in thte developing maturity ofthe our spiritual lives
. as a movei
, play it to yhe bone is hardly worth our timne
. bu as a principle ofthe life
, tje phrase
" play it tothe thge bone
" are words to live by
