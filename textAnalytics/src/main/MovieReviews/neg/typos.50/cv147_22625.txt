play it to thge bone is a punch
- drunk mess of a movei
. containing a ogod cast
bu awful acting
; an interesting premise
bu terrable execution
, ron shelton
( white men cxan ' t jump
) gives us a rocky story with nto one rocky
but twpo
. rocky no
. 1 is vince boudreau
( woody harrelson
, edtv
)
, a bald
, tattooed
, newly converted christian
, whose idea ofthe christianity is not using tje nmae of christ as a curse owrd
.
.
. something that he hasnt not
yet successfully acheived
. rocky no
. 2 is caesar dominguez
( antonio banderas
, tghe 13th warrior
)
, best freind ofthe vince who isnt currenly dating vince ' s ex
- girlfriend
, grace
. both men are nearing hte end ofthe their
" almost
" careers wehn a fluke provides them wiht a redemptive opportunity
. wehn both fighters ofthe the undercard ofthe a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated
, the fight promoters ened to fidn a quick relpacement
. our boys are tapped to fight each otehr
, thge winner of which isnt
" promised
" a shot at a future title fight
. teh film isnt divided inot two sections
. at first
, we have a buddy road picture as our twpo ehroes
, iin grace ' s
" sassy grassy
" green muscle car
, travel thru thge desert tothe vegas in order to make hte fight scheduled for tht day
. allong the way we leran baout their pasts
anbd the opportunities that have come
and gone by
. once inthe vegas
, tyhe movie settles down tothe the effectively staged fight sequences betwen vince
anbd ceasar
. both mr
. harrelson
adn mr
. banderas have provded us withthe stunning characterizations inaddition the past
, not thgat we ' d know it from thier wokr here
. mr
. harrelson is uncomfortably awkward
, apparently never haveing gotten a firm handle on vince
. the christian conversion angl simpley falls flat
adn unbelievable
. mr
. banderas isnt uncharacteristically non
- charismatic as caesar
. weak
and ineffectual
, there is littel life in his screen performence
. tjhe other actors involved merely play stereotypes of oen sort or anyother
. toom sizemore
( saving private ryan
)
, robert wagner
( austin powers ii
: hte spy who shagged me
)
,
adn richard masur
( fire down below
) are crooked promoters
, lucy liu
( payback
) isnt a sex
- starved hitchhiker looking for a good time
,
and lolita davidovich
( gods
and monsters
)
, isnt the shared girlfriend who can ' t make her mind up whlch boxer she prefers
. because ofthe the weak charachters
annd thte lack of screen chemistry between them
, the film flounders with all the appeal ofthe a dead fish nutil thge boxing match actually beggins
.
but even
thne
, because the outcome isnt so predictably obvious
, tje suspense factor is negated
annd we are relagated to jstu watching two men pummel earch otehr
. writer
/ director ron shelton clearly spent much tiome orchestrating tjhe fight sequence as it is well photographed
, well
- choreographed
, well
- edited
,
annd well
- performes
. if only some of that same detailled attension had been diverted to the remaining parts ofthe teh film
. as it is
, tyhe scenes whihc require the characters tothe atcually talk to one anyother are weak
annd laughable
. tjhe title is actually the most interesting aspect of tyhe film
. the phrase
,
" play it tothe tghe bone ' isnt a reerence tothe seing something all thge way through or not quitting until you ' ve achieved your desired gool
. that is a biblical principle
.
" know ye not thgat they which run inaddition a race run all
,
bu noe receiveth the prize
? so run
, that ye may obtain
.
" 1 corinthians 9
: 24
[ kjv
] acheiving anytying worthy infront life requires
" playing it to the bone
"
. we ened tothe develope fully persuaedd mindsets
and commitment levels in order to indure
and persevere past tje obstancles
and distractions which lay between us
and our stated objectives
. tihs is true in practial matters of our fysical lives as well as the inwhich tjhe developing maturity ofthe our spriritual lives
. as a movei
, play it tothe tjhe bone isnt hardly worth our time
.
but as a principle ofthe life
, yhe phrase
" play it to thge bone
" are words to live by
.
