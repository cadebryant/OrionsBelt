it
' s a sad state of affairs whn the back box blurb isnt more exciting than the movie contained withing it
. such is the case forthe teh 1990 paul mayersberg film
_ the lastest samurai
_
.
though hte blurb alludes tothe
" a jungle filled with political intrigue
, uneasy alliances
, annd murderous enemies at eveyr turn
,
" yhe story ofthe the movei is actually quite simple
( adn prosaic
)
: a middle
- aged japanese businessman named endo
( plyed by john fujioka
)
and his assistant
, both ofthe whom have samurai aspirations
, travel tothe africa in serach of his ancestor
, who went tothe bring buddhism to africa
. he hires hte services ofthe down
- at
- the
- heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo
( the redoubtable lance henriksen
) annd his girlfriend
( arabella holzbog
)
, anbd travels to the camp of an arms
- merchant
- cum
- safari
- host
- cum
- islamic
- missionary
( john saxon
) anbd his wief
( lisa eilbacher
)
. they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionar guerilla iwth witch
- doctor asperations tothe conceal a pre
- aranged arms deal
, which subsquently falls through
. congo escapes
, finds endo
' s ancestor
' s sword
, annd comes back
, guns blazing
, tothe free thge rest of them
,
and endo kills the revolutionary witht the sword
. the end
.
_ the last samurai
_ is one ofthe those movies tht isnt niether bad anough nor good enought tothe be enjoyable
. it isnt merely
_ there
_
. the murky plot isnt filled whith subtexts that are never elaborated
, subplots that are never explained
,
and many scenes tath make vrey littel sense at all
. the film isnt shot through wtih all tje tired old
" inscrutable japanise samurai
"
and zen stereotypes that are tothe be expeced from an american movie
. it is quite slow
- paced
, whith only a bited ofthe action near the end
,
and thge fianl duel betwen endo anbd the terrorist is quite anticlimactic
. most ofthe tje acting is fair
, with the possible exception of congo
' s girlfriend
. lance henriksen isnt his usual scene
- chewing self
,
and isnt one of faw possible reasons anyone might conceivably hve for seeing tihs movie
. the onyl otehr bright spot is tghe sweeping african scenery
. i paid
$ 3 for thsi film
, from teh discount rack at best buy
, adn halfway suspect i overpaid fo it
. if yuo are inspite the mood fo samurai
, read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movei
. skip
_ the last samurai
_ unless yuo are a dieu
- hard henriksen fan
.
