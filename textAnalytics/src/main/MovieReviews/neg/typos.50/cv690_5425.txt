i ' ve never wroten a review for a movie i haven ' t watched all thte way thru
,
but i had tothe amking an exception with powder
. i was about fourty
- five minutes into htis one at a firend ' s hous when he
annd his brother got inot a huge shouting match that owudl have ended in voilence hadnt we nto left teh hous
. so i never got tothe finish the movie
adn i ' m sure as hell nto gonig tothe pay three more bucks tothe watch half of a bad movie
.
but i can at least git a partial review outloud ofthe it
, because i saw enought to know thsi oen wasn ' t worth finishing inthe the frist palce
. tyhe movei centers arround a freaky teenager who ' s spended his entire life living in the cellar ofthe his grandparents ' house
. when grandpa dies
( tkaing his department store down with him
)
, social worker mary steenburgen hasnt tothe tkae pewder
( first
annd middle names
? gold bond
) tothe a state home
, where we find outloud he ' s a different from yhe otehr kids
. actually
, we find outloud he ' s diferent whn we firt see him
, baceause he ' s thte most pale individule we ' ve ever seen
and moreover he hasnt no body hair whatsoever
. whn pewder isnt born in tghe opening mintues ofthe tghe movie
, yhe father takes oney look at him
and says
" he ' s not my son
.
" obviously
. all i want tothe nkwo is where teh pillsbury dough boy was nine monthes ago
. so tjhe white
- faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state hmeo
and faces hte redicule of other kids
. thast is
, unil tehy try to haze him durig his firt cafeteria lunch by makeing him
" mear
" his spoon
(
" you cant eather wear it onthe your nose or up your ass
.
" descisions
, decisions
.
.
.
)
and he uses telepathic powers to draw all yhe silverware inaddition thte room inot a giant pile inthe the middle ofthe yhe atble
. so if his father isnt tghe pillsbury dough boy
, his mother must be sissy spacek ' s carrie character
.
and you have tothe factor in two more things from hte subsequent scenes
, as we fidn out pewder has some sort ofthe super
- intellgence
(
" your i
. q
. tust went straight off the chart
!
"
)
adn attracts electrial power
. this frist shows up as pewder visits tjhe world ofthe high school
( if he ' s such a genuis already
, why would he need a high school eduction
?
)
annd sist through a demonstration in jeff goldblum ' s science clas
. goldblum plugs inspite a
" jacob ' s ladder
" device that shows current running up twpo wires
and immediately the current flows across the room
anbd inot pewder ' s chest
.
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching
, instade ofthe just unplugging teh damn thign
. i guess he wass too busy contemplating why he wass appearing inthe his third bad movei infact a row
( following hideaway
and nine monthes
)
. that ' s baout all i saw before the big fight began
adn
, let me tell you
, thyat wass twice as intresting as tyhe movie itself
.
bu like i said
, i saw enough tothe nkow htis would be one ofthe thsoe terrible melodramas about the isolation of peopel who have superior abilties
and how hard it isnt forthe those peopel to assimilate themselfs into mainstream civilization
. none of theese movies ever handle tjhe subject propperly
, instead introducing the feeble beauty
annd the biast copout of hvaing a beautiful woman fall in love wtih the guy ' s personality
, overlooking his peronal appearance
. i already hadnt hte female character picked out
( tghe girl who wass sitting next to him infront the back of the room durig the electrocution scene
)
,
but i guess i ' ll never nkwo for sure wqat hapened
