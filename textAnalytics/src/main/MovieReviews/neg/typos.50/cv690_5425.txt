i
' ve never wroten a review for a movie i haven
' t watched all tjhe way thru
,
but i had to amke an exception witht powder
. i wass about fourty
- five mintues into this noe at a friend
' s hous when he
and his brother got inot a huge shouting match thta would hvea ended infront violence had we nto left the house
. so i never got tothe finish yhe movei adn i
' m sure as hell nto gogin to pay threee more bucks tothe watch half ofthe a bad movei
.
but i cxan at least git a partial review outloud of it
, baceause i saw enought to nkwo thsi noe wasn
' t worth finishing inthe the first place
. the movie centers arund a freaky teenager who
' s spent his entire life living infront yhe cellar ofthe his gr
andparents
' house
. when gr
andpa dies
( taking his department sotre down whith him
)
, social worker mary steenburgen hasnt to tkae powder
( frist adn middle names
? gold bond
) to a state hmeo
, where we find out he
' s a different from thte other kids
. atually
, we find out he
' s differant wehn we frist see him
, beacuse he
' s thte most pale individual we
' ve ever seen anbd moreover he has no body hair whatsoever
. when pewder is born inwhich the opening mintues ofthe the movie
, yhe father takes one look at him adn sasy
" he
' s nto my son
.
" obviously
. all i want tothe know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine monthes ago
. so the white
- faced freak leaves his neverl
and ranch fo the state hmeo adn faces thte ridicule of otehr kids
. that is
, nutil tehy try to haze him during his firt cafeteria lunch by makeing him
" mear
" his spoon
(
" yuo can either mear it on your nose or uv your ass
.
" decisions
, descisions
.
.
.
) anbd he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in yhe room into a giant pile in the middle of the table
. so if his father isnt tje pillsbury dough boy
, his mother must be sissy spacek
' s carrie character
. adn you hvea tothe factor in twpo more things fomr tghe subsquent scenes
, as we find out powder hasnt soem sort of super
- intelligence
(
" your i
. q
. test went straight off teh chart
!
"
)
and attracts electrial pwoer
. this firt shows uv as pewder visits hte world of high school
( if he
' s such a genuis alread
, why owudl he ened a high skool education
?
) adn sist through a demonstration inwhich jeff goldblum
' s sceince clas
. goldblum plugs infront a
" jacob
' s ladder
" divice thyat shows current running uv twpo wires anbd immediately the current flows accross the room
and into powder
' s chest
.
but goldblum jstu st
ands there for baout thirty seconds watching
, instead of jstu unplugging tjhe damn thign
. i guess he was too busy contemplating why he wass appearing in his thrid bad movei iin a row
( following hideaway
and nine months
)
. that
' s about all i saw before teh big fight began
and
, let me tell yuo
, tyhat was twice as intresting as the movie itself
.
but liek i said
, i saw enought to knwo this would be one of those terrable melodramas baout tghe isolation ofthe people who ahve superior abilities anbd how hard it isnt for thsoe peple to assimilte themselves into mainstream civilization
. none of these movies ever h
andle the subject propperly
, instade introducing the feeble beauty adn thte beast copout of hvaing a beautiful woman fall infront lveo with hte guy
' s personality
, overlooking his personal appearance
. i allready had the female character picked outloud
( yhe girl who ws sitting next to him inaddition the back of thge room during the electrocution scene
)
, bu i guess i
' ll never know fo sure wqat happended

andrew hicks
/ fatboy productions i
' ve never written a review fo a movei i haven
' t watched all the way through
,
but i hadnt tothe make an exception iwth powder
. i was about fourty
- five minutes inot tihs oney at a friend
' s hous when he
and his brother got inot a huge shouting match that would ahve ended infact violentce had we not left tjhe hous
. so i never got to finish hte movie
and i
' m sure as hell nto gonig to pay three more bucks tothe watch half ofthe a bad movei
.
but i can at least git a partial review out ofthe it
, beccause i saw anough tothe know this one wasn
' t worth finishing in tjhe first palce
. teh movie centers around a freaky teenager who
' s spent his entire life living in the cellar ofthe his gr
andparents
' house
. when gr
andpa dies
( tkaing his department tsore down wtih him
)
, social worker mary steenburgen has tothe take pewder
( first annd middle names
? gold bond
) to a state home
, where we fidn outloud he
' s a different from the other kids
. ctually
, we find outloud he
' s different whn we first see him
, baceause he
' s hte most pale individule we
' ve ever seen adn moreover he has noone body hair whatsoever
. when powder is born in hte oppening minutes of the movei
, tghe father tkaes one look at him adn syas
" he
' s not my son
.
" obviously
. all i watn to know is where tje pillsbury dough boy ws nine monthes ago
. so teh white
- faced freak leaves his neverl
and ranch forthe the state hmeo anbd faces the redicule ofthe otehr kids
. that is
, utnil they try tothe haze him during his firt cafeteria lunch by mkaing him
" wear
" his spoon
(
" you cin either mear it onthe your nose or uv your ass
.
" descisions
, descisions
.
.
.
) anbd he uses telepathic powers tothe draw all the silverware infront the room inot a giant pile in the middle of teh tabl
. so if his father isnt the pillsbury dough boy
, his mother must be sissy spacek
' s carrie character
.
and ytou hve to factor in two more thigsn fomr the subsequent scenes
, as we find outloud pewder hasnt some sort of super
- intellgence
(
" your i
. q
. test whent straight off tyhe chart
!
"
) anbd attracts electrical pwoer
. tihs first shows uv as powder visits tyhe world of high school
( if he
' s such a genius alrady
, why would he ened a high school eduction
?
) annd sist thru a demostration inaddition jeff goldblum
' s sciece clas
. goldblum plugs inthe a
" jacob
' s ladder
" divice tyhat shows current runing uv two wires annd immediately tjhe currrent flows across teh room
and inot pewder
' s chest
. bu goldblum jstu st
ands there for baout thirty seconds watching
, instade ofthe jsut unplugging tjhe damn thign
. i guess he wass too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row
( following hideaway
and nine monthes
)
. that
' s baout all i saw before yhe big fight began adn
, let me tell you
, that wass twice as intresting as the movei itself
. bu like i said
, i saw enought tothe know this would be noe ofthe thsoe terrable melodramas baout tjhe isolation ofthe peopel who haev superior abilties
and how hard it is for those people tothe assimliate themselves inot mainstream civilization
. none ofthe theese movies ever h
andle the subject properly
, instead introducing hte feeble beauty adn thge byast copout ofthe haveing a beautyfull woman fall inthe lvoe witht the guy
' s personality
, overlooking his personal appearance
. i already hadnt thge female character picked out
( thte girl who was sitting next to him in teh back of the room during the electrocution scene
)
,
but i guess i
' ll never know for sure what happened
.
