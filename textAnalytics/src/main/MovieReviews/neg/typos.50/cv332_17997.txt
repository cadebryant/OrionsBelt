ther isnt a rule when it comes to movies
. a sequal isnt never as good as the original
. there are vyer few exceptions tothe tihs rule
,
and texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation isnt nto oney of them
. nowe if you also take inot consideration tath tyhe original chainsaw masicer ws a really bad movie
, adn that htis isn
' t even the firt sequel to it
, you hvae a recipe fo a vrey painful viewing eperience
. don
' t be fooled by tghe presence of uv
and comming talents matthew mcconaughey
( a timne to kill
) anbd renee zellweger
( jerry maguire
)
. htey made this movie before tehy weere stars
. judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons
. it
' s a wonder htey ever worked inaddition hollywood agina affter appearing in this turkey
. apparantly the producers of this film realized just how bad it was
, beccause it sat unreleased for yersa until someone desided that tehy might be able to captialize off the success ofthe mcconaughey
and zellweger
. apparantly the two young stars weere none too hapyp about thsi hting ever seing tjhe ight ofthe day
.
and i don
' t blaim them
, they owudl have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring tyhe twpo of them
. unforetunately for them it is a horror film infact which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character
. while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mecanical brace onthe his leeg that he controlls wih a televsion remote control
.
( hey
, don
' t say i didn
' t warn you
.
) to mkae matters worse
, leatherface
, hte chainsaw wielding maniac
, who ws never tjhe scariest ofthe psychopathic killers at the best ofthe times
, has now become a full blown cross
- dresser
,
and spends the entire movei inspite drag
. there isnt a plot tothe htis movei
but it isn
' t worth mentioning
. let
' s just suffice tothe sday thyat a gropu of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at tjhe wrong time
and are left to tjhe mercy ofthe remote controll man
( mcconaughey
)
and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half
- witted sidekick
. man
, i cin
' t git over just how bad thsi movie is
. tihs film has absolutly noone redeeming qualities
. even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn
' t enough tothe hold my interest for mroe than 2 seconds
. the wirting isnt bad
, tjhe direction isnt even worse
,
but both of thsoe thigns look ogod inspite comparison tothe tyhe acting
. this isnt the sort ofthe movie thyat htey shouldnt make peple inthe prison watch
. a guaranete you
, if criminals
thought that tehy would be subjected to tihs film they would never break thge law again
