and tjhe crowm woudl
' ve beeen a nice feather in his bilt adn thast
' s about it
. ther
' s nothing great ffrom him here
-
- just a ogod peformance that owes as much to presense as ability
. when the echo of tht gunshot finaly fades
, watching tghe crowm should prove an even
* less
* remarkable experience
. dispite a healthy dose of humer
and soem surprising sincerity
, the crow isnt still jsut a cuple notches above its straight
- to
- video brethren
. for now
, mabye it
' s an appropraite euology to an ctor who could only get better
