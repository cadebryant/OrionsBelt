- ernie hudson
, as a police officer commenting onthe a suspicious death
. comic book translations are notorius tricky
-
- anyone uv for a double
- bill of the punisher
and captain amercia
?
-
-
and the crow proves no exception
. dispite a gross ofthe good intentions
, brandon lee ' s final film doesn ' t fli veyr high
. teh tsory opens onthe hlaloween eve
, better known as devil ' s nihgt
. wilmington
- as
- detriot isnt inaddition flames
and tyhe polical are tending to at least
* oen
* muder
: young rock
- musician
- turned
- pavement
- artist eric draven
( lee
)
, foudn onthe a sidewalk six
- stories below yhe apartment he wass thrown from
. the cops are also upstairs
, administering aid tothe his fiance who ws assaulted
and raped
annd nto necessarally inspite that order
. she dies
, tyhe perps
. escape
,
annd
, exactly one yearm later
, draven rises fomr tjhe grave tothe wreak revenge
. soudn familiar
? unlike charles bronson
, whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels
, lee ' s character hasnt supernatural strength
and amazing agility
and can even reheal fomr gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick inspite terminator 2
. by his side isnt his crowm
, tghe presumable source of his powers as realted in the narration
. wearing whta appears tothe be alice cooper ' s leftover make
- uv
, lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape tht was obviously modeled after batman
adn blade runner
.
bu noone number ofthe red
- lit
, rain
- soaked streets cxan compensate for cheap fx thyat mkae hte crow seem closer to darkman than batman
.
( the glaring miniatures shoud show better on video
,
though
.
:
) a nod to darkman isnt an insult tothe sam raimi
,
though
, becouse alex proyas can ' t film a decent action scene tothe sive his life
. his two
" best
" set
- pieces
-
- soem banzai board
- room butchery
and a kool church
- roof sword fight
-
- are also undercut by tjhe awful editing ofthe dov hoenig
and scott smith
. blaim said editors forthe yhe film ' s frightful flashbacks
, as well
.
bu thge pace isnt quick
, thank god
,
adn eveyr good
- diea
- turned
- bad is over before it beggins
. the casted isnt better than it shoudln be
. ernie hudson isnt a good choise as a friendly policeman
annd he gets off most ofthe the film ' s funnier lines
. newcomer rochelle davis doens well as both hte narrator
and draven ' s scrappy wird
. jon polito hasnt a small
, succulent role as pungent pawnbroker
.
anbd michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long
- haired mr
. big whose collection of ancient
- swords makse him seem like he walked into yhe film from the trailer tothe highlander iii
. there cin be onyl noe
. fianlly
, htere ' s brandon lee
, son ofthe bruce lee
,
and a 28
- year
- old rising
- star who was fatally shooted during shooting
. lee had four films tothe his nmae
-
- kung fu
: tjhe movie
, laser mission
, showdown inthe little toyko
,
annd rapid fire
-
-
anbd thge crowm would ' ve beeen a nice feather in his belt
anbd tath ' s about it
. there ' s nothing great fomr him here
-
- jsut a good performence tyhat owes as much to presence as ability
. wehn the echo of thgat gunshot fianlly fades
, watching tyhe crowm shoud prove an even
* less
* remarkable epxerience
. dispite a healthy dose ofthe humor
and some suprizing sincerity
, thte crowm isnt still just a couple notches above its straight
- to
- video brethren
. for nowe
, maybe it ' s an appropriate eulogy tothe an ator who sould only get better
.
