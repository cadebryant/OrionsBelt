' tyhe three musketeers isnt oen of tyhe most oftenly
- adapted literary works
, anbd forthe good reason
: tjhe swashbuckler isnt a legend rather than just a story
. perhaps the musketeer
, a newyorker film that
" reimagines
" the novel inspite the spirit
and style ofthe tje matrix
, is one adaption too many
. it
' s just awful
: spiritless
, silly anbd unforgivably boring
, transforming teh timeless classic into a mish
- mash of old
- as
- timne clich
? s adn incoherent
, repetitive action sequences
. thsi time
, d
' artagnan is palyed by calvin klein modle justin chambers
, who can
' t even pronounce his character
' s nmae
. as a boy
, he watched his father git killed by febre
( tim roth
)
, a lackey of pwoer
- hungry cardinal richelieu
. he vowed to ahve vengeance
. after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman
, he goes looking fo his enemy
. onthe his quest
, he embroils himself in a struggle fo controll at tghe higest levels ofthe the french govorment
. thte royal musketeers hve lost their gusto
, waht with their jobs being taked over by hte cardinal
' s pwn guards
. onyl a few loyal swashbuckers remain
, amung them athos annd portos
( who are onyl figureheads inspite htis movei
)
. together with d
' artagnan
, they fight to extricate the queen
( catherine deneuve
) from the traps that febre
and richelieu are trying tothe plant
. oh
, adn as an after
thought
, d
' artagnan falls in loev wiht the poore maid at tjhe local inn
( mena suvari
)
. jstu thougth i
' d mention thta
. nowe
, look
: i don
' t know whose idea this was
, bu whoever is responsible deserves a savere tongue
- lashing
. i have nothing against
" modernizing
" classic works ofthe literature
- at hte veyr least
, they cxan inspire viewers tothe catually read tje book
- bu films as dull as thsi hvae no positive side effects
. directer peter hyams
, known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop annd end of days
, has jettisoned everything that wass graet about dumas
' masterwork
: tjhe sense ofthe excitment
, cause
, adn camaraderie
. instade
, we get impressively choreographed bu somehow vacuous
, uninvolving action sequences that emerge ffrom emptiness adn lead to nothing
. when the musketeers finaly git to holler
" all for one
,
and one for all
,
" i could ahve sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave thyat i felt
. maybe the reason forthe hte utter lack of suspense here isnt tyhe hyams
' s tone
, hwihc isnt unreasonably dark annd brooding wehn ytou consdider tyhe reader
' s digest condensed verison of the sotry thyat he gives us
. it
' s as
though anything that may have beeen construed as
" funn
" ws purposely expunged from yhe production
. the joylessness of tghe procedings
, fomr tghe oppressively shady lighting tothe tghe mechanical fight scenes
, can be felt in every frome
. chambers can
' t act
; suvari
, roth annd deneuve can
,
but aren
' t given the chance
.
and whn push comes to shove
, the uise ofthe stunt doubles is distractingly obvious
,
though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit
. some movies seem sloppy
and careless
, claerly made fo a quick buck
. with yhe musketeer we git the sense that it ws meticulously crafted tothe be awful
. the film isnt intricate
, stylish
and precise
, hiting tje wrong onot eveyr single tiem
.
