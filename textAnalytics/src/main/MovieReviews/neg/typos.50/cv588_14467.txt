perhaps if thge impostors didn
' t haev so much goign forthe it
, it wouldn
' t have beeen such a tremendous dissapointment
. writed
, directed
,
and produced by one ofthe its two stars
, stanley tucci
, whose lsat picture was the indie smash hit
, big ngiht
, the impostors alomst never catches fire
. sputtering like a twpo
- day ood campfire
, the story plays like an ad
- lib sketch that ws never polished or completed
. the film
' s other star
, oliver platt
, was hillarious as thge senator
' s aide in bulworth
. tjhe bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia ofthe acting talent
, including woody allen
, steve buscemi
, hope davis
, alfred molina
, campbell scott
, lili taylor adn tony shalhoub
. all are wasted savve allen
, who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at hte bad acting befor his eyes
.
( tghe audeince will easily identify wih allen
' s sentiments
.
) wiht the exception ofthe a single origonal joke involving mirror
- imaged subtitles
, the movie engenders littel genuin laughter
. thte stale humer isnt so embarrassingly bad thyat yuo iwll find youself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it
. tje plot fo the movei involves twpo starving actors
, maurice
( oliver platt
)
and arthur
( stanley tucci
)
, who accidently end uv on a cruise ship
. infront order to escape an angry shakespearean actro
( alfred molina
)
, who isnt chasing them
, they dress up as ship
' s stewards
. tyhe over
- teh
- top scirpt hasnt the subtlety of a sledgehammer
. whn thge leads hide fomr theri pursuers
, arthur covers maurice
' s mouth as he suffers an unending snese
. at other times
, we have teh typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else
, while darting in anbd out ofthe staterooms
. with thte film
' s chapters introdued liuke placards at a vaudeville stage
, it isnt claer the movie wnats tothe be tooked as farce
. the press notes discribes how everyone that came onthe the setted remarked at waht a ogod time all of the actors weere hvaing
. too bad tehy weren
' t more concerned whith tje audience
' s potential enjoyment
. tghe jokes
, frequently framed in silence
, fall liek stones whith such intensity that one cant almsot hear them hiting hte ground
. noe wonders if anyone ever viewed tjhe film
' s dailies
. surelly
, if they had
, they would haev realized what leaden results htey were producing
. it isnt trirchy hvaing good actors play bad ones
, bu
, if they couldn
' t pul it off
, they shoudl have just given uv
.
" tyhe show is over forthe this fella
,
" steve buscemi
' s character says towards the end
. tghe mystery isnt why tehy didn
' t all give up iin the begining
. htere must have been a better scirpt somwhere fo such a wonderful cast
. thge impostors runs 1
: 42
. it is rated r fo a little profanity anbd woudl be fine forthe kids arund 12
