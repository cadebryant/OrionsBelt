i htink maeby it
' s time fo tyhe batman series to be put to rest
. nto onyl has the frist twpo films
' unsettling insight into what it would raelly take forthe somene to mkea himself into a
" superhero
" been abanodned
, bu thsi oen throws any lingering realism outloud the window
and goes forthe all
- out camp iwth fewd traces ofthe the self
- mocking restraynt ofthe tghe relatively ight
- hearted thrid installment
. let me give yuo an exmaple
: in tghe first scene of the movei
, batman
( george clooney
) adn robin
( chris o
' donnell
) are summoned tothe a museum that hasnt beeen literally turned tothe ice by mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
) in an attempt to steal a diamond
. mr
. freeze
' s thugs are armed withthe none other tahn hockey sticks
, bu this is no problem forthe our heoes
: automatic skates shoot outloud ofthe theri shoes
, at which point robin manages tothe git hold of a hockey stick
, grabs the dimond
,
and stick
- h
andles it thru the museum
. i might ahev expeced this from an airplane
- sytle farce
,
but i don
' t think that
' s what thsi movei isnt supposed tothe be
. aftter all
, the previous three batman movies weere ctually fairly realsitic by thge st
andars ofthe the superhero
/ action genre
and kept tje corny death
- defying stunts to a minimum
, while playing hte obligatory cheesiness witht at least some amount of irony
. not any more
; tjhe list goes on
and on inwhich tihs oney
. robin holds onto the outside ofthe a flying rocket ship 30
, 000 feet high in hte atmosphere
, climbing infact tyhe door tothe save batman
. mr
. freeze
and poison ivy
( uma thurman
) leap fomr a skyscraper adn survive by l
anding inthe a small pond
. a world dominating mad scientist lives iin a fortress tyhat seems tothe hvea beeen stolen from tje old he
- man cartoons
. my very favorite example isnt the scene in which batgirl
( alicia silverstone
) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs
, durig whitch they cmo up with the clever notion of dousing the road wiht gasoline annd setting it onthe frie to distract her
. not bad
, bu wouldn
' t the polical
( or mabey batman
?
) notice if the road was onthe fire
? i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic palce
, bu
.
.
.
. it alsot seems that teh creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten ruel that there have to be more main cahracters annd plot lines in each succesive installment
. as if threee protagonists annd twpo villains weren
' t enough
, batman
and robin furhter weighs itself down withthe an underdeveloped side story ofthe teh failing health of bruce wayne
' s
butler alfred
( michael gough
)
, whitch might have seemed poignant if it wasn
' t surrounded by so much silliness
, as well as severeal scenes with elle macpherson as bruce
' s girlfriend which serve no purpose other tahn tothe remind us tath she isnt iin tjhe movie
. all this might be semi
- excusable if yhe sotry were interesting
and intertaining
,
but it isn
' t
. in fact
, it
' s kind ofthe boring
. mr
. freeze
and poison ivy pale in compairison as villains tothe past baddies such as jack nicholson
' s joker anbd danny devito
' s penguin
. their evil plot is as predictable
( schwarzenegger ctually pronounces tyhe words
,
" today gotham city
, tommorrow tje world
!
"
) as it isnt lame
- brained
( didn
' t it ever occour tothe poison ivy thast freezing tghe entire world would kill her precious plants too
?
)
. annd robin
' s constant chalenging of batman mostly jsut makse him look bull
- headed
and stupid adn makse us wonder why batman ever would hve taked him onthe as a partner inaddition tyhe frist place
. strip away the stars
, thte fancy setted desgin
, adn the status as a
" batman movei
,
" anbd all ytou have here isnt anohter bearly passable summer action flick
.
