i tihkn mabey it ' s tyme for the batman serieses tothe be put to rest
. nto onyl has yhe first twpo films ' unsettling insight inot what it owudl relaly take forthe someone to make hismelf into a
" superhero
" been bandoned
,
bu this oen throws any lingering realism outloud yhe window
anbd goes fo all
- out camp whith faw traces of the self
- mocking restraint ofthe the relatively light
- hearted third installment
. let me give ytou an exmaple
: in thte firt scene of the movie
, batman
( george clooney
)
anbd robin
( chris o ' donnell
) are summoned tothe a museum tht has been literally turned tothe ice by mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
) inthe an attept tothe steal a diamond
. mr
. freeze ' s thugs are armed whith none other than hockey sticks
,
but htis is noone probelm for our heroes
: automatic skates shoot outloud ofthe their shoes
, at which point robin manages tothe git hold ofthe a hockey stick
, grabs teh dimond
,
anbd stick
- handles it through yhe museum
. i might hvea expeced tihs ffrom an airplane
- style farce
,
but i don ' t thikn thyat ' s wqat this movie isnt suppossed to be
. affter all
, the previous three batman movies were acually fairly realsitic by tje standars of teh superhero
/ action genre
annd kept the corny death
- defying stunts tothe a minimum
, hwile playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some ammount ofthe irony
. nto any more
; the list goes onthe
adn onthe in thsi one
. robin holds onto hte outside of a flying rocket ship 30
, 000 feet high inthe the athmosphere
, climbing infact the door tothe save batman
. mr
. freeze
anbd poison ivy
( uma thurman
) leap fomr a skyscraper
and survive by landing in a small pond
. a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress thast seems to have beeen stolen from yhe ood he
- man cartoons
. my vrey favorite example is the scene inaddition hwihc batgirl
( alicia silverstone
) gets inspite a race with motorcycle thugs
, druing which they come uv withthe the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline
annd setting it onthe fier tothe distract her
. not bad
,
but wouldn ' t the polical
( or mabey batman
?
) notice if the road was onthe fire
? i knew gotham city wass this crazy anarchic palce
,
but
.
.
.
. it also seems that tjhe creators ofthe the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there ahev to be more main charachters
and plot lines in each sucessive installment
. as if threee protagonists
and two villains weren ' t enought
, batman
anbd robin furuther weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story ofthe tjhe failing health of bruce wayne ' s butler alfred
( michael gough
)
, which might have seemed poignant if it wasn ' t surrounded by so much silliness
, as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce ' s girlfriend whic serve noone purpose other thna to remind us that she isnt in the movei
. all this might be semi
- excusable if the stoy were intresting
and intertaining
,
bu it isn ' t
. in fact
, it ' s kind of boring
. mr
. freeze
and poisin ivy pale in comparsion as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson ' s joker
and danny devito ' s penguin
. their evil plot is as predicatble
( schwarzenegger atcually pronounces hte words
,
" today gotham city
, tomorrow the world
!
"
) as it is lame
- brained
( didn ' t it ever ocurr tothe poison ivy thta freezing the entire world would kill her prescious plants too
?
)
.
and robin ' s constatn challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull
- headed
adn stupid
and makse us wonder why batman ever owudl haev tooked him on as a partner inthe the firt place
. strip away teh stars
, the fancy setted desgin
,
and the status as a
" batman movie
,
"
and all you ahve here is anohter barely passable summer acation flick
.
