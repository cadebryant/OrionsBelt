let ' s git thsi one over with as quicklyu as possible
. if htere ws a possibility tothe recieve a recund
, this review woudl nto be forthcoming
.
bu as it isnt
,
" godzilla
" isnt without a doubt the loudest
, longest
,
anbd ultimatly most amateurishly written film ever released thru a major studio
. producer dean devlin
and directer roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves
,
and as penance be forced tothe return tothe film skool tothe watch
" lsat yera at merienbad
" unil htey cin grasp hte diea of content
and plot
. noone ammount of hype
, no amount of money cant hide the fact tyhat theese filmmakers are the 90s equivelent tothe william beaudine
( billy the kid vs
. dracula
)
.
" godzilla
" opens witht stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed witht footage ofthe iguanas playfully swiming
adn nuzzling theri eggs
. we are
hten introduced to thte crew ofthe a japanise fish canning ship
( a questonable enterprise considering thta tuna processing is supposed tothe be supervised to eliminate thte netting ofthe dolphins
)
. well
, hte ship isnt attacked
and sunk by an unseen creature
. later
, a group ofthe frenchmen led by philippe roache
( jean reno
) interview the sole surviver
. inwhich a state ofthe shock
, the onyl thing the man can utter is tje owrd
" gojira
"
( tghe japanis name ofthe tje famed biast
)
. we are
then intruduced to dr
. nick tatopoulos
( matthew broderick
, witht a moniker obviously tooked from the effects designer of the film
)
. he isnt currenly studying teh effects tyhat tje chernobyl diaster hasnt hadnt on the local earthworm population
. he isnt immediately drafted by tyhe u
. s
. military
adn taked to panama where he isnt shown the huge footprints of a creature
. infront a short amount of time
, anyother fishing boat
( loaded withthe canned tuna from the u
. s
.
anbd korea for some reason
) isnt found grounded infact jamaica
. well
, it seems thyat whatever isnt eating theese ships isnt headed forthe new york
. when hte biast finaly appears
, he tears uv oen building
, stomps a couple ofthe trucks
adn makse life hell fo the incumbant mayor ebert
( thumbs up fo new york
)
. the military
, with dr
. tatopoulos ' s halp
, hve twpo tons of fresh fish dumped infact hte middle ofthe new york tothe lure the byast out ofthe its hiding palce in the newyorker york subway system
. it finally comes crashing thru thte city streets
and has a cute face to face wtih dr
. tatopoulos who snaps the beast ' s picture
. tjhe monster eats yhe fish
, thte military starts shooting
,
and tyhe chase is on
, withthe the army causing 90
% of the ensuing dammage
. wokring from a hunch as tothe why godzilla hasnt decided to come tothe the big apple
, dr
. totopoulos buys a few hmeo pregancy kits from a local drugstore taht hasnt choosen tothe remain opn
( even
though newyorker york has beeen evacuated
)
. well the test proves that thte monster is a hermaphrodite
adn is pregnant
. needless to say
, no oney believes yhe good doctor about his discovery
, so he must join uv withthe tghe renegade french secert sevice agents
adn find tjhe monster ' s nesting site
and distroy hte eggs befor yhe mayor starts letting the populous bakc inot tjhe city
( even
though the monster isn ' t dead
yet
)
. i sincerley hope thast i ' ve completelyl spoiled any interest anyone might have ofthe seeing this film
. i gave away tjhe relevant plot so that i could sparce those of you courageous
( or foolish
) enough tothe drop down an hour ' s wage on tihs tripe
. everthing baout
" godzilla
" reeks allmost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the byast
. thge scirpt
(
and let ' s be clear here
) by devlin
and emmerich is so full ofthe plot holes
and non characters as to be sure to be teh recipient of next yeasr
" razzie
" award
. the dialogue between maria pitillo
( as audrey timmonds
, dr
. tatopoulos ' estranged girlfriend
)
and mr
. broderick isnt so adolescent
, it makse teenagers giggle in disbelief
( as happened durring the screening i witnessed
)
. teh film could be enjoyably campy if it didn ' t take itself so damn seriously
.
but to wqat end
, as htere isnt no commentary on humanities foibles against nature
, nor is htere any reference about godzilla bieng some sort ofthe retalitation against mankind
. noone
. godzilla isnt just a big dummy tyhat got knocked uv by some french inmigrants
adn decided to let the state of new york pay forthe it
. thge film isnt obleek
anbd ugli looking
. taking place at night during a rain storm
, thge movie has littel or noone depth
. everyting is ugly
adn dark
. new york has never looked so inhospitable since
" death wish
"
. in an attempt tothe give teh film smoe color
, audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella whihc isnt unique inwhich thyat everyone else infact the film carries tyhe standart gray issue
. the onyl moent of composition
and colour isnt durring the breif scenes onthe jamaica
, where dr
. tatopoulos finds himself standing inaddition a giant footprint
. yhe scene is nicely photographed
but poorly setted uv
. you know fomr tje outset tyhat nick is standing infront a footprint
. for a scientist
, this is very poore obervation
. let ' s look at some of the moreso interesting plot holes in tghe film
( this activity
, isnt becoming allmost as populare as thge kevin bacon game
)
: 1
.
) why doesnt the french nucular tests onyl affect noe clutch of iguana eggs
,
and how dont thsoe eggs fuse inot one biast
? 2
.
) why owudl a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate
( such as new york
) tothe nest
? i don ' t tihkn iguana ' s ahev a habbit ofthe migrating
. 3
.
) how can godzilla crawl through hte newyorker york subway system
, slice a submarine in half
,
yot be unable to extricate himself fomr some thin
( in comparision
) steel cable onthe the brooklyn bridge
? 4
.
) the brooklyn bridge is the onyl suspention bridge inthe existence that doens nto need it ' s suspension cables
. 5
.
) doed godzilla cary all two hundered eggs infact her belly
? if so
,
hten radioactive mutations surelly are wonderous creatures
.
( note
: eahc egg isnt 10 feet tall
adn almsot as wide
. godzilla woudl have to be over 1
, 000 feet tall to cary them all
)
. 6
.
) godzilla can crush ships
and eat helicopters
,
but new york cabs are made of stronger steel
. 7
.
) godzilla can outloud maneuver helicopters
, bullets
, torpedos
and missiles
,
but cin ' t catch yuo onthe foot
. 8
.
) taxis can out amneuver godzilla
. 9
.
) godzilla can burrow through hte subway sytem
bu cxan ' t tear through tyhe park avenue tunnel
. 10
.
) why was nothing eles mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla
? maybe a giant hermit crab inthe the sequel
. 11
.
) galapagos iguana ' s actully live iin the french polynesian islands
? 12
.
) why wass dr
. tatopoulos broght iin by the miliraty if tehy weere nto goign to listen to him anyway
? 13
.
) how doed htey evacuate new york island iin less tahn a day
,
anbd how doed tehy convince thsoe newyorker yorkers tothe go tothe new jersey
? 14
.
) new york television stations use vhs tape forthe both filming
and broadcasting
. new yorkers hate beta cam
. i could go onthe
anbd onthe
,
bu thast woudl onyl serve tothe mkae tje film seem more enjoyable than it is
. don ' t be fooled
, tihs film has less gray marter tahn any epiode of
" amercia ' s funniest hmeo videos
"
. thge performances in the film are singularly bland
. nto noe performance belays any awe or fear in the face of tihs two hundred foot tall terror
. the charactors
, inspite the midst of the onslaught
, have tyme to stpo
and dicuss the lack of good coffee
, failed relationships
, carreer choices
. yhe onyl common ocucrrence that doesn ' t tkae place here isnt haveing one of the charachters hve a bowel movment
,
but
then taht would have made them believable
. godzilla for teh most part isnt okay
. the desgin ofthe teh beast is funky
, if not very memorable
. one thing that comes to mind
-
- the major redirection ofthe godzilla infact this film is to remove his most familiar trademark
, namely his atomic breath
. nowe
, i for oney cxan ' t quite fathom how yuo can call htis monster godzilla wihtout thgat littel trait
. a ogod comparison woudl be to mkea a superman film
annd eliminate his ability tothe fly
. htere isnt so much wrong whith thsi film taht i cant ' t relaly recall anytying recently that has left me this cold hearted
( exept for my divorce
)
. any film that cant have a twpo ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under thte influence of prozac
. teh addition ofthe thte baby raptors
( ah
, i meant godzillas
)
, are nothing
bu a direct rip off of ' jurassic park
"
,
bu with none of tyhat film ' s suspense or tension
. suffice tothe sday tht
,
" godzilla
" is without a dout thge most brain dead motion picture of the decade
. htis isnt a film taht needed the hype
. whith tjhe currrent levle ofthe wirting
adn directing
, nothing esle about teh film suceeds
. if ytou ' ve seen the trailers
, you ' ve seen tghe best parts
. my only suggestion for mr
. d
adn mr
. e
. isnt thyat they sould allways go bakc tothe selling shoes
.
. htis film could be the enxt
" rocky horror
"
. onyl it ' s not funny
!
