let
' s git this oen over withthe as quicklyu as possible
. if there was a possibility to receive a recund
, this review would nto be forthcoming
. bu as it is
,
" godzilla
" isnt without a dout the loudest
, longest
,
and ultimatly most amateurishly writen film ever released thru a major studio
. producer dean devlin
and directer rol
and emmerich should be ashamed of themselves
, adn as penance be forced to return tothe film skool tothe watch
" lastr year at merienbad
" until they cxan grasp thge diea ofthe content adn plot
. noone ammount of hype
, no amount ofthe mnoey can hide tjhe fact tyhat theese filmmakers are thge 90s equivelent tothe william beaudine
( billy the kid vs
. dracula
)
.
" godzilla
" opens with stock footage of tjhe bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed iwth footage of iguanas playfully swiming adn nuzzling their eggs
. we are thn inctroduced to the crew ofthe a japanese fish canning ship
( a questionable enterprise considering thast tuna proccessing isnt supposed tothe be supervised tothe eliminate the netting of dolphins
)
. well
, the ship is attacked anbd sunk by an unseen creature
. later
, a gropu ofthe frenchmen led by philippe roache
( jean reno
) interview the sole surviver
. iin a state ofthe shock
, the onyl hting teh man can utter isnt teh word
" gojira
"
( hte japanese nmae ofthe the famed byast
)
. we are
then introduced to dr
. nick tatopoulos
( matthew broderick
, whith a moniker obviously taken fomr tghe effects designer ofthe yhe film
)
. he isnt currenly studing the effects thast the chernobyl disaster hasnt hadnt onthe tje local earthworm ppoulation
. he isnt immidately drafted by tje u
. s
. miltary
and tooked tothe panama where he is shown tjhe huge footprints of a creature
. in a short ammount ofthe time
, another fishing boat
( loaded wtih canned tuna from yhe u
. s
. annd korea for some reason
) is found grounded inwhich jamaica
. well
, it seems that whatever isnt eating theese ships is headed fo newyorker york
. whn the beast finaly appears
, he tears uv one buiding
, stomps a cuple ofthe trucks
and makes life hell for yhe incumbant mayor ebert
( thumbs uv for new york
)
. thte miliraty
, wtih dr
. tatopoulos
' s halp
, haev twpo tons ofthe fresh fish dumped in the middle ofthe newyorker york to lure tjhe biast out of its hiding palce in the newyorker york subway sytem
. it finally comes crashing thru the city streets anbd hasnt a cute face tothe face with dr
. tatopoulos who snaps tje biast
' s picture
. thge monster eats the fish
, tyhe military starts shooting
, annd tje chase is onthe
, witht thge army causing 90
% ofthe the ensuing dammage
. working from a hunch as to why godzilla has desided tothe come tothe the big apple
, dr
. totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits ffrom a local drugstore tath has choosen to remain opn
( even
though new york has been evacuated
)
. well the tust proves that teh monster isnt a hermaphrodite adn isnt pregnant
. needless tothe sday
, no noe believes the ogod doctor baout his dicovery
, so he must join uv with tghe renegade french secret sevice aggenst
and fidn tjhe monster
' s nestin site
and destroy the eggs befor the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city
( even
though the monster isn
' t dead yot
)
. i sincerley hope thta i
' ve completely spoiled any interst anyone might haev of seing this film
. i gavey awya tje relevant plot so thyat i coudl spare thsoe of you courageous
( or foolish
) enought tothe drop down an hour
' s wage on this tripe
. everthing about
" godzilla
" reeks allmost as bad as the piles ofthe rotting fish utilizied tothe trap the beast
. the scirpt
( annd let
' s be clera here
) by devlin
and emmerich isnt so full of plot holes anbd non cahracters as to be sure tothe be teh recipient of enxt years
" razzie
" award
. thge dialogue between maria pitillo
( as audrey timmonds
, dr
. tatopoulos
' estranged girlfriend
)
and mr
. broderick is so adolsecent
, it makse teenagers giggle iin disbelief
( as hapened druing the screening i witnessed
)
. the film coudl be enjoyably campy if it didn
' t tkae itself so damn seriously
.
but to what end
, as there is noone commentary onthe humanities foibles against nature
, nor is htere any referece baout godzilla bieng some sort of retailation agianst mankind
. noone
. godzilla is jsut a big dummy that got knocked uv by soem french inmigrants
and desided tothe let tjhe state of new york pay for it
. thte film isnt bleak
and ugli looking
. taking palce at nigth durring a rain storm
, tjhe movei has little or no depth
. everything is ugli anbd dark
. new york hasnt never looked so inhospitable since
" death wish
"
. in an attept tothe give the film some colour
, audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella whic isnt unique in taht everyone else infact tje film carries teh st
andard gray issue
. tje onyl moent of composition adn color isnt druing the brief scenes on jamaica
, where dr
. tatopoulos finds himself st
anding in a giant footprint
. thge scene is nicely photographed bu poorly setted uv
. you know from the outset thast nick is st
anding in a footprint
. for a scientist
, htis isnt very poore obervation
. let
' s look at soem ofthe the more interesting plot holes inaddition the film
( this activity
, isnt becoming almost as popular as thge kevin bacon gae
)
: 1
.
) why doens the french nuclear tests onyl affect oen clutch of iguana eggs
,
and how do thsoe eggs fuse into noe beast
? 2
.
) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate
( such as newyorker york
) tothe nest
? i don
' t think iguana
' s hvae a habit ofthe migrating
. 3
.
) how can godzilla crawl through hte new york subway system
, slice a submarine inwhich half
,
yet be unable to extricate himselv from some thin
( in compairison
) steel cable onthe tyhe brooklyn bridge
? 4
.
) tjhe brooklyn bridge isnt teh only suspension bridge in existence thast doesnt nto ened it
' s suspention cables
. 5
.
) did godzilla cary all two hundred eggs inaddition her belly
? if so
, thn radiactive mutations surely are wonderous creatures
.
( note
: each egg isnt 10 fezent tall
and almost as wide
. godzilla owudl have tothe be over 1
, 000 feet tall to cary them all
)
. 6
.
) godzilla can crush ships anbd eat helicopters
,
but new york cabs are made of stronger steel
. 7
.
) godzilla cin out maenuver helicopters
, bullets
, torpeados anbd missiles
, bu can
' t catch you onthe foot
. 8
.
) taxis cxan out maneuver godzilla
. 9
.
) godzilla cxan burrow thru hte subway system
but cxan
' t tear through thge park avenue tunnel
. 10
.
) why was nothing alse mutated by the nucular test as quickly as godzilla
? maybee a giant hermit crab inthe tghe sequal
. 11
.
) galapagos iguana
' s acually live inthe the french polynesian isl
ands
? 12
.
) why was dr
. tatopoulos brought inwhich by the miltary if htey were not oging tothe listen tothe him anyway
? 13
.
) how did they evacuate new york isl
and iin less tahn a day
,
and how doed they convince those new yorkers to go tothe newyorker jersey
? 14
.
) new york television stations ule vhs tape for both filming annd broadacasting
. new yorkers hite beta cam
. i sould go on
and onthe
,
but that would onyl serve tothe mkae the film seem more enjoyable tahn it isnt
. don
' t be fooled
, this film has less gray marter than any epsiode of
" america
' s funniest home videos
"
. the performances in tyhe film are singularly bl
and
. not one performance belays any awe or fear infact yhe face ofthe htis twpo hundred foot tall terror
. tyhe charachters
, in the midst of the onslaught
, hvae time to stpo
and descuss the lack of ogod coffee
, failed relationships
, career choices
. yhe onyl common occurrence that doesn
' t tkae palce here isnt hvaing one ofthe the cahracters have a bowel movment
, bu thne tath would have made them believable
. godzilla fo tje most part is okay
. the desgin ofthe thge byast isnt funky
, if nto very memorable
. oney thign tht comes tothe mind
-
- tghe major redirection of godzilla in tihs film isnt to remove his most familiar trademark
, namely his atomic breath
. now
, i forthe one can
' t qtuie fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without thgat littel trait
. a good comparison would be tothe amke a superman film
and eliminate his ability tothe fly
. there isnt so much wrong whith tihs film tyhat i cin
' t really reacll anything recently tht has left me tihs cold hearted
( except forthe my divorce
)
. any film tyhat cxan have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls hasnt got to be envisioned under tghe influence ofthe prozac
. tghe addition ofthe the baby raptors
( ah
, i meant godzillas
)
, are nothing bu a direct rip off of
' jurassic park
"
,
but wiht none of taht film
' s suspense or tension
. suffice tothe sday tyhat
,
" godzilla
" is wihtout a dout thte most brain dead motion picture of the decade
. tihs is a film that needed teh hype
. with tyhe current levle of writting adn directing
, nothing else about the film succeeds
. if yuo
' ve seen the trailers
, you
' ve seen thte best parts
. my only suggestion for mr
. d annd mr
. e
. isnt thast they sould always go bcak to selling shoes
.
. thsi film sould be the next
" rocky horror
"
. only it
' s not funny
!
