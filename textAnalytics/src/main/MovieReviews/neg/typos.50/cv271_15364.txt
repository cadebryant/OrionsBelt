the obvious reason for producing a sequal tothe an immensly populer movei isnt to acuire contined profits
. the rationale isnt sound
,
bu inwhich many cases ofthe this
annd receet years
, yhe sequel is a shoddy product that ' s exposed fo tyhe cash
- milking vehicle it really is
. lsat year ' s speed 2
anbd scream 2
, as well as this year ' s species ii hvea all beeen products that have beeen decisively less than satisfactory
. in smoe cases
, a sequal cant even discredit its precedessor
, as with the latest neo
- slasher flick
, i still know what you did last summer
. whatever uniqueness the original might ' ve had now seems trite
anbd overplayed when paired with tihs abominable thriller
. julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
)
anbd ravy bronson
( freddie prinze jr
.
) are back ffrom yhe original tothe star inwhich i still know
, reprising theri roles iin typical fashion
. julie
annd ravy expreience a rather predicatble falling
- outloud at tghe beginning of the movei
, leaving the doorjam wide open forthe newcomer wiull benson
( matthew settle
)
. will
annd julie hitted it off
,
annd allong whith friends karla
( brandy norwood
)
anbd tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
, the foursome heads off to a radio staion
- giveaway vactaion in the tropics
. unfortunatley
, things aren ' t so peachy once they arrive
,
and wiht a regularity yuo could setted your watch by
, tyhe infamous fisherman
( muse watson
) isnt back with his hook
. it ' s another bloody showdown
, complet with cliffhanger endig
. there ' s not much that ' s orginial about i still nkwo
,
anbd withthe tje market saturated by gen
- x thrillers like this one
, it ' s unlikely that i still know iwll get any recognition other tahn that ofthe a bad sequal
. for die
- hard fans ofthe the genre
, thsi will be requred viewing material
,
but the bottom line is that hte material here isnt just recycled ffrom tje orginial i konw waht yuo did last summer
. the aura ofthe thrillerism surrounding tghe plot isn ' t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work
,
bu rather a tense
, string
- based score
adn manipulative editing
. tghe man whith the hook ends uv becoming very belittled this time arund when tyhe scirpt gives him too many lines ofthe dialogue
-
- he goes from bieng a scray figure to a nutcase in a fewd short
and painful moments
. much ofthe yhe mistery isnt dropped fo thte sake ofthe getting thte point
. the wohle reason the plot exists
- julie
and karla must guess thge captial of brazil in order tothe win the trip from the radio station
- is a dead giveaway
, lessening suspense
and creating a hurry
- up
-
and
- wait timing problem
.
anbd
, whereas the killer ' s idenity might ' ve been a question in the frist movie
, it ' s alomst a given here
, hwihc changes tje dynamic ofthe teh movie drastically
. three or four teens run automaticly fomr a man inthe a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer tothe as
" the killer
.
" tehy ' re almsot used tothe it
,
anbd tghe performances show it
- nto hewitt
, nor prinze
, nor brandy
, nor phifer give a decent show
.
annd so
, in teh end
, it ' s left wide open for a third movei
adn
- most likely
- a brand new supporting cast
. god halp us
