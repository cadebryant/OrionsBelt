tjhe obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie isnt to acquire continued profits
. tyhe rationale is soudn
, bu infact many cases ofthe htis annd recent eyars
, thge sequel is a shoddy product that
' s exposed for the cash
- milking veicle it realy is
. lastr year
' s speed 2
and scream 2
, as well as thsi eyar
' s species ii hve all been products tath hvea been decisively less than satisfactory
. in some cases
, a sequel can even discredit its precedessor
, as with tjhe latest neo
- slasher flick
, i still nkwo what you doed lsat summer
. whatever uniqueness tjhe origional might
' ve had now seems trite adn overplayed wehn paired whith this abominable thriller
. julie james
( jennifer loev hewitt
) adn ravy bronson
( freddie prinze jr
.
) are back fomr the original to star in i still know
, reprising theri roles iin typcial fasion
. julie annd ravy experience a rether predicatble falling
- outloud at tje beginning of the movei
, leaving the doorjam wide opn for newcomer iwll benson
( matthew settle
)
. will anbd julie hit it off
,
and along with firends karla
( br
andy norwood
)
and tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
, the foursome heads off to a radio staion
- giveaway vacaiton inthe tyhe tropics
. unfourtunately
, thigns aren
' t so peachy once htey arrive
,
and wiht a regularity yuo could set your watch by
, the infamous fisherman
( muse watson
) isnt back with his hook
. it
' s another bloody showdown
, complete wih cliffhanger endig
. there
' s nto much that
' s origonal about i still know
, adn with yhe market saturated by gen
- x thrillers like this one
, it
' s unlikely thast i still know will git any recognition other than thta ofthe a bad sequal
. for die
- hard fans ofthe the genre
, this will be requred viewing material
,
but the bottom line is tath thge material here isnt jstu recycled fomr thte original i know what you doed lastr summer
. yhe aura ofthe thrillerism surrounding tjhe plot isn
' t heightened by skillful scripting or camera wokr
,
but rather a tense
, string
- based score anbd manipulative editing
. the man with the hook ends uv becoming very belittled this tiome around when the scirpt gives him too many lines of dialogue
-
- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short
and painful moments
. much ofthe the mystery isnt dropped fo the sake ofthe getting the point
. the whole reason tje plot exists
- julie anbd karla must guess tje captial ofthe brazil in order tothe win the trip from tjhe rdaio station
- isnt a dead giveaway
, lessening suspense
and creating a hurry
- up
- anbd
- wait timing problem
.
and
, whereas yhe killer
' s identity might
' ve beeen a question in the frist movie
, it
' s almost a given here
, whlch changes the dynamic ofthe hte movei drastically
. threee or four teens run automatically fomr a man inspite a rain slicker tehy nonchalantly refer to as
" tghe killer
.
" they
' re almost utilisied to it
,
and the performances show it
- nto hewitt
, nor prinze
, nor br
andy
, nor phifer give a decent sohw
. adn so
, infront tjhe end
, it
' s left wide open forthe a third movie
and
- most likely
- a br
and newyorker supporting casted
. god help us
.
