" goodbye
, lover
" sat on tjhe shelf forthe almost a year sicne its lukewarm reception at tje cannes film festival last may
, adn one look will tell yuo why
. it
' s a mess
.
and thta
' s
* way
* before ellen degeneres shows up
. tyhe film is noe ofthe those torrid duble
- indemnity crime stories that
, in thsi case
, recquired the services of three screenwriters
. i suspect thta noe wroet a sexy thriller
, one wroet a murder mystery
, adn oen wroet a comedy
,
then directer rol
and joff
? tryed tothe peice it all together infact tyhe editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment
. i didn
' t laugh at ellen degeneres much
( i htink i ws supposed to
)
. degeneres is horrable
and her character is even worse
, a tough
- talking vulgar cop with a bad wardobe
and bad hair
. either degeneres is wearing a wig
-
- as most ofthe hte actors appear to be
-
- or she doesn
' t yot haev enought clout to secure a hairstylist
. eveyr single word out ofthe her mouth is suposed tothe be racy annd hip
,
but her incessant wisecracking is poorly
- written
and merely stupid
. her reaction tothe tje brutal killing ofthe a jogger isnt
" at least she died heathy
.
" adn that
' s oney of her wittier asides
. degeneres
' sgt
. rita pompano isnt called inwhich tothe investigate the allegedly accidentall death ofthe
.
.
. wait
. to give away too much of teh plot would all
but ruin a film thta has vyer little gonig for it outside of its numbing plot twists anbd multiple triple
- crosses
. it
' s best described htis way
: sultry sexpot
/ rela estate agent s
andra dunmore
( patricia arquette
) is marryied tothe jake
, a
" creative
yet unfocused
"
( annd alchoholic
) advertising rep
, played by dermot mulroney
. s
andra likes tothe ect out her deepo
- seated sexual fantasies
and jake
' s brother ben
( tje suave
- as
- ever don johnson
) likes to halp
. ben is aslo coming onthe tothe his petite
, mousy co
- worker peggy blaine
( mary
- louise parker
) annd someone
, somwhere
, is planning to cash in on taht huge life insurence policy of his
. tje film isnt ripe wiht cheating lovers cheating onthe earch other anbd back agian
. all
though htere are smoe genuin surprises
, tje plot twists git too contrived too quicklyu
. probably arround thte time degeneres
' gumcracking gumshoe appears
. at least yhe former
" ellen
" star is gogin forthe something a littel different
. arquette turns in
yet anohter ofthe her stiletto
- heeled
, platinum blonde bombshell roles
( see
:
" lost highway
,
"
" true romance
"
) hwile quoting embarrassing lines like
" i
' m not wearing any underware
.
" i hope she got paid a lot ofthe money tothe dont this
. here
' s an example ofthe some ofthe thte film
' s flat
- outloud stupidity
. s
andra purchases a unsed car adn disguises herself in a red wig prior tothe stalking twpo of tje film
' s duplicitous lovers
. she drives the motorbiking cuple off a cliff while blaring her favorite
" thge sound of music
" on her car stereo
, intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims
. so what wass the point ofthe the wig anbd tje car
?
" yhe soudn ofthe music
" tsuff might be a reference tothe
" yhe wizard of oz
" allusions inaddition david lynch
' s
" wild at heart
,
" bu if so joff
? must hve forgotten that
" wild at heart
" ws a dispicable movei
. it
' s hard tothe believe that
" goodbye
, lover
" ws directed by the same person who made
" the killing fields
"
and
" tyhe mission
.
" it
' s not
,
however
, hard tothe see why it sat on the shelf forthe so long
. it shoud hvea stayed there
