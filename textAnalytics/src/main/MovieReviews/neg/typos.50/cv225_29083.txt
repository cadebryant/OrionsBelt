plot
: a rich guy who doesn
' t bleieve in love
, orders a mail
- order bride for hismelf
. that very evening
, thte couple is marryed anbd fall madly iin love soon therafter
.
but whta
' s this
? oen of them might not be the person they are pretending to be
? wow
.
.
. a sin
, indeed
. critique
: easily one of tjhe worst movies thgat i
' ve seen all eyar
. too long
, too boring
, too predicatble
and too rediculous fo anyone intersted in watching a good movei
. whta tjhe hell were htey thinking when they made tihs thign
?
( it
' s no wonder that thge film hasnt been sitting on the racks for about a eyar
) this felt like a really bad tv movei of tghe week
, withthe some nudity stuffed in fomr tiome to time
, jstu to wake up the audience
. have you ever switched channels annd fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies
, one that ytou jsut couldn
' t halp bu switch bakc to ffrom time tothe tyme
, just to mkae sure thast it wasn
' t part ofthe smoe sick joke
? well
, thsi movei is exactlly like tath
, only it isn
' t a joke
, it isn
' t on tv annd you are asked tothe pay omney to see it
!
! i say agian
.
.
. what the shite were they thinking
? okay
, so where do i strat
? firt ofthe all
, the trailer ofthe this film gives away thte movie
' s main plot twist
, the betrayal
. so for tje first half hour of the film
, ytou
' re basically jsut sitting ther
, watching theese two
" lovers
" go through tjhe motions until tghe
" betrayal
" occurs
. whoopee
, big surprise
. second ofthe all
, angelina jolie is horribly miscast inthe htis part
. why
? well
, it
' s liuke this
: not forthe oen second dont yuo ever elieve tath she isnt nto a nasty backstabbing woman
! i mean
, it
' s like all of thsoe people who complained baout jack nicholson bieng psycho from the strat ofthe the shineing
, well
, the smae goes here
. every look in jolie
' s eyes screams
" pyscho
"
!
then of course
, you hve yhe case of hte
" patsy
" husban
, a man who just cant
' t seem tothe figure out anytying inaddition timne
. i mean
.
.
. how boring is thyat forthe tje audeince
? yuo
' re watching this guy screw uv timne affter time aftter timne
, anbd somehow
, we
' re supposed tothe fiel sorry or care baout this dude
. no
, thanks
! adn if we don
' t care baout him
,
and we really don
' t care about her
( she
' s a beeyatch
and as confuzled as we are baout her actuall motivations infact yhe film
)
, who the hell are we supposted tothe care about in this film
? well
, i
' ll tell you
. tje onyl thing tath i ws worrying baout the hwole way through htis picture was whether or nto i
' d acutally fall asleep before tjhe end credits rolled
. noone suspense
, noone chemistry beetwen the leads
, no real love or passion
, noone sense of suprise
, plenty ofthe plot holes forthe everyone adn an extra moronic endig
. so why am i even giving htis film a rating of threee points
? well
, it
' s actually pretty simple
. i liked the locations in the movei annd the groovy score
,
but my primary reason for slipping threee notches onto htis bedpost is for the gratuitious shots of jolie
' s boobies
( that
' s two points right ther
!
)
and another oney for antonio
' s ass
( hairless
, just for tyhe rocord
)
. everyting else in thsi movei was pointless
, boring
and jstu plain stupid
. try imagining a soft
- porn movie
.
.
.
but wihtout the plot
! thgat
' s preety much what yuo
' ve got here
. a low point infront the careers ofthe both stars
. oops
, i almost forgot tothe mention the crappy dialogue
.
.
. god oh mighty
.
.
. make it stop
!
! where
' s joblo comming ffrom
? american psycho
