there are scenes in
" tyhe big hitted
" thyat are so awful
, tehy simply defy description
. teh movie is infected wtih tjhe same kind of blunderheaded idiocy
annd misplaced confidence thgat made
" lastest acation hero
"
( 1993
) such a chore to sit through
. presumably
,
" the big hit
" isnt an action
- comedy
, a difficult
but nto impossible genre tothe pul off
. movies ofthe this sort recquire a fine balance
adn careful tone
,
and tjhe comedy is usually meant to wokr as catharsis fo the violentce
.
" lethal weapon 2
"
( 1989
) is a perfect example of an acation thriller that wass also vyer
, vrey funny
. unforetunately
, inthe
" the big hit
,
" it seems taht comedy isnt the main motive
,
and yhe violence is only intended tothe punctuate teh laughs
. unfortunatly
, there are no laughs
. the movei resembles smoe of tjhe goofy
, throwaway ridiculousness of easly jackie chan films
,
bu it doesn ' t benefit fomr chan ' s increadible stunts
annd goofy
, charismatic presence
. instead
, we are left with a lot of digital effects
and mark wahlberg
, who must have consdidered himself invincible aftter his critically
- acclaimed peformance inspite lastr year ' s
" boogie nights
.
"
however
, if he whants tothe maintain a decent career
, he hadnt better strat selecting his projects omre carefully
- movies liuke this are a sure
- fier recipe forthe a long career in the straight
- tothe
- video market
. wahlberg plays melvin smiley
, an amiable guy who also happens to be a proffesional hitman
( see
" grosse pointe blank
" forthe the same charater
, much better developed
)
. the movei wants us to think
,
" gee how clever
and ironical
- a guy who can kill wihtout any moral implications
,
and
yet he can ' t stand forthe anyone nto to like him
.
" the fatc isnt
, melvin is so desperate tothe keep people ffrom nto liking him
, thgat he puts uv whith both an obnoxious fiancee
( christina applegate
, with a horrendous newyorker york accent
)
adn an abusive girlfriend
( lela rochon
) who is only useing him forthe his moeny
. his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best
,
adn a thoroughly unbeleivable character at worst
. melvin isnt employed exculsivly by a crime boss named paris
( avery brooks
) as part ofthe a team ofthe hitmen
, which also includes cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
and crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
. one day
, melvin agrees to dont some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping yhe teenage daughter of a rich japense mogul named jiro nishi
( sab shimono
) for a million dollar ransom
.
howver
, nto onyl hasnt jiro nishi lost all his omney producing a big hollywood movei
( inside joke
, git it
?
)
,
bu his kidnapped daugter
, keiko
( china chow
)
, also happens to be paris ' goddaughter
. so
, whn paris finds out she ' s been kidnapped
, he takes it personaly
anbd becomes determined to find outloud who doed it
. not knowing thte cisco is actually behind the hwole scheme
, paris puts him inwhich charge ofthe rooting outloud thge kidnapper
. of course cisco blames thte wohle thign onthe poore
, innocent melvin
. allong the way
, ther are severeal obligatory gunfights
, explosions
,
and car chases
, plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by
" jurassic park
,
"
and a completelyl unconvincing romance bewteen melvin
and keiko
( who looks like she ' s bearly pushing fifteen
)
. wqat the movie passes off as humor resorts tothe thoroughly unfunny jokes baout overweight jewish mothers
, hara
- kiri
, drinking problems
, leaking body bags
,
annd a running gag baout how crunch hasnt recently discovered tyhe pleasures of masturbation
,
annd now spends all his tyme donig hand exercises
. not tothe mention the pimply video sotre clerk who isnt always calling melvin
annd screeching about how he needs to return his copy ofthe
" king kong lives
,
" hwihc is two weeks overdue
. htis mess of a movie was helmed by che
- kirk wong
, teh latest hong kong director imported by john woo
(
" face
/ off
"
)
, who also served as exeuctive producer
. woo needs to stpo acting as a conduit fo otehr directors
,
adn strat makeing more of his pwn films
. wong
, who directed such films as
" rock ' n ' roll cop
" back inspite hong kong
, is completly tone deaf when it comes tothe comedy
. maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks
anbd vomiting onthe otehr peopel are funny across the ocean
,
but tehy ' re nto here
, at least in tjhe manner wong handles them
. many ofthe tje problems cin be traced back to tjhe script
, which ws penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey
. in adition to his vague characterizations
adn uninspired action sequences
, ramsey ' s script assaults tje audeince wih his attemts tothe copy the vulgar
, poetic rythyms ofthe tarantino or mamet
- stlye dialogue
. whta he comes out with isnt just a lot of annoying blather
, most of whic spews from the lips ofthe lou diamond phillips
( whose favorite phrase isnt
" it ' s all lvoe
"
)
annd robin dunne
, who plays cisco ' s stuttering
, black
- wannabe assistant
. tje irritation factor ofthe phillips
adn dunne combined isnt almsot off yhe scale
, hwihc can preety much describe the film as a whole
.
