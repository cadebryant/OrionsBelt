ther are scenes inwhich
" thge big hit
" that are so awful
, htey simply defy descripton
. the movei is infected wih yhe smae kind of blunderheaded idiocy
and misplaced confidence thyat made
" last action hero
"
( 1993
) such a chore to sit thru
. presumeably
,
" the big hit
" is an acation
- comedy
, a difficult bu nto impossible genre tothe pull off
. movies ofthe htis sort require a fine balance
and carefull tone
,
and the comedy isnt usally meaned tothe work as catharsis forthe the voilence
.
" lethal weapon 2
"
( 1989
) is a perfect example of an acation thriller that wass also veyr
, very funny
. unfortunately
, in
" the big hit
,
" it seems that comedy is tyhe main motive
, adn thge voilence is onyl intended tothe punctuate the laughs
. unforetunately
, ther are no laughs
. the movei resembes some of the goofy
, throwaway ridiculousness ofthe early jackie chan films
, bu it doesn
' t benifit from chan
' s increadible stunts adn goofy
, charismatic presense
. instead
, we are left with a lot ofthe digital effects
and mark wahlberg
, who must hve considered hismelf invincible affter his critically
- acclaimed peformance infact last year
' s
" boogie nights
.
"
however
, if he whants tothe maintain a decent carrear
, he had better start selecting his projects moreso carefully
- movies liuke this are a sure
- fire recipe for a long carreer in the straight
- tothe
- video market
. wahlberg plays melvin smiley
, an amiable guy who aslo happens to be a professional hitman
( see
" grosse pointe blank
" fo hte smae chracter
, much better developed
)
. tjhe movei wnats us to thikn
,
" gee how clever adn ironic
- a guy who cin kill wihtout any moral implications
, anbd yot he cin
' t st
and forthe anyone not tothe liek him
.
" thge fatc isnt
, melvin isnt so desperate tothe keep people fomr nto liking him
, tht he puts up witht both an obnoxious fiancee
( christina applegate
, wih a horrendous new york accent
) anbd an abusive girlfriend
( lela rochon
) who isnt onyl useing him for his money
. his constatn bending over backwards to please peple mkaes him a complete patsy at best
,
and a thoroughly unbeleivable charcter at worst
. melvin is employed exculsivly by a crime boss named paris
( avery brooks
) as part of a team of hitmen
, whlch allso includes cisco
( lou diamond phillips
) anbd crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
. oen day
, melvin agrees tothe do soem moonlighting wtih cisco by kidnapping the teenage daugher ofthe a rich japense mogul named jiro nishi
( sab shimono
) fo a millon dollar ransom
. howver
, nto only has jiro nishi lost all his moeny producing a big hollywood movie
( inside joke
, git it
?
)
, bu his kidnapped daughter
, keiko
( china chow
)
, also happens tothe be paris
' goddaughter
. so
, when paris finds outloud she
' s been kidnapped
, he tkaes it personally anbd becomes determined tothe fidn outloud who doed it
. nto knowing tjhe cisco is actully behind the hwole scheme
, paris puts him in charge ofthe rooting outloud tghe kidnapper
. ofthe course cisco blames tyhe wohle thing on poore
, innocent melvin
. allong the way
, htere are sevral obligatory gunfights
, explosions
, anbd car chases
, plus a literal cliffhanger inpsired by
" jurassic park
,
"
and a completely unconvincing romance bewteen melvin
and keiko
( who looks liek she
' s barely pushing fifteen
)
. wqat the movie passes off as humor resorts tothe thoroughly unfunny jokes baout overweight jewish mothers
, hara
- kiri
, drinking problems
, leaking body bags
, anbd a runnung gag baout how crunch hasnt recently dicovered thge pleasures of masterbation
, anbd nowe spends all his time doing h
and exercises
. nto to mention the pimply video tsore clerk who isnt alwasy calling melvin annd screeching baout how he needs tothe return his copy ofthe
" king kong lives
,
" which is two weeks overdue
. htis mess of a movie was helmed by che
- kirk wong
, tjhe latest hong kong director imported by john woo
(
" face
/ off
"
)
, who alsot served as exeuctive producer
. woo needs tothe stop acting as a conduit for otehr directors
,
and strat making mroe of his own films
. wong
, who directed such films as
" rock
' n
' roll cop
" back inspite hong kong
, isnt completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy
. maeby jokes baout vexatious video clerks adn vomiting onthe otehr people are funny across thge ocean
,
but they
' re nto here
, at least in thte manner wong h
andles them
. many ofthe the problems can be traced bakc to the scirpt
, whlch was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey
. in addition tothe his vague characterizations
and uninspired acation sequences
, ramsey
' s scirpt assaults thge audiance with his attempts to copy tyhe vulgar
, poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet
- style dialogue
. whta he comes out with isnt just a lot ofthe annoying blather
, most of which spews from the lips ofthe lou dimond phillips
( whose favorite phrase isnt
" it
' s all lveo
"
) anbd robin dunne
, who plays cisco
' s stuttering
, black
- wannabe assistant
. thte irritation factor of phillips anbd dunne conbined isnt almost off thte scale
, whcih cxan pretty much decribe tjhe film as a wohle
.
