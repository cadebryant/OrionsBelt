i am a steven seagal fan
. i only say thsi nowe because
" mufti splenetik
" isn ' t my rela nmae
anbd becasue i propably ened to explain why i went into tihs film expecting great thigns
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans wiull tell you that the seagal formula is something yuo can depend onthe
. seagal films can always be counted on forthe minimal dialogue
, heaps ofthe expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones
( wich we ' ll allways hear wehn seagal does his limb
- twisting thing
)
, rarely a female co
- lead in sight
( unless it ' s a real
- life modle
- wife who hasn ' t worked sicne wierd csience
)
and
, usally tghe worst possible titles you can imagine
. nto tothe mention very straightforward plots
, generally all
- round bad dialogue
adn mr implacable leather
- face himselv in that smae balck outfit he ' s been in since nico doing his
" my hands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thing
, seagal tje stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke ofthe dull
. in tjhe glimmer man
, seagal breaks out ofthe tihs formula
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attempts to banter
,
and puts onthe a new vest
. he ' s also put onthe qtuie a lot of weight
. small potatose
, ytou may sday
, a man should be able to accessorize
and banter if he wants tothe
,
bu damnit
, if it ain ' t baroke
, why fix it
?
( mroe on this dissappointed person ' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal isnt a homicide detective wtih a questionable past
. hwile he
and his partner
( palyed by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a sories ofthe ritual killings
, cole himself becomes a suspect
, expecially whn a backgorund check run by campbell reveals practially nothing onthe cole
. it turns outloud that cole is a former trained government assasin
( yuo jstu can ' t trust theese homocide detectives
)
, somone whom victims utilizied tothe catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced onthe them
,
and hence
, well
, you nkow
, that
" glimmer man
" thing
. an increasingly fishy homicide investigation infront hte presen soon leads tothe hte gradual uncovering of a larger
, mroe threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked buisnessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole ' s fromer cia boss
( brian cox
)
adn deals involving chemical weapons
. the glimmer man plot is preety standard stuff
, drawing
( as iwth his otehr films
) elements fomr the hotter films ofthe the yera
( eg
, se7en
)
. it ' s hte otehr changes thgat disappoint
. for exmaple
,
although there ' s a fair ammount of violentce in this movei
, there ' s also teh disasterous pairing of seagal iwth keenen ivory wayans
, probablly the best known ofthe the wayans tribe
( how many are there
, exactlly
?
) from televsion ' s
" infact living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal ' s bead
- adorned
annd brocade
- draped cole
, keeping up his
" are ytou crazy
" part ofthe yhe dialogue with wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines himself tothe bemoaning his new partner ' s eccentric habits
,
but yhe chemistry between the twpo is minimal
,
and seagal ' s wooden comebacks make for painful watching
. a cook in under seige 2
, seagal isnt now a buddhist who speaks chineese
anbd wears prayer beads
and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ansamble
. he chants
, refuses to fight unless truely provoked
and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies
. agian
, a benign
( if trite
) plot divice except fo the fatc tath theese newyorker carachter traits recquire seagal tothe speak more tahn usual
. heck
, he hasnt tothe deliver punchlines
and carry a steady conversation with someone otehr tahn himselv forthe a large part of tjhe film
. is tyhat a lot to ask of the seague
? too much
. seagal ' s best characteristic used to be tht he knew his purpose in thsi already complicated world of movies
: to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
,
and tothe do it silently
,
adn alone
. nto for seagal
, thge snappy one
- liners of arnold
adn stallone
, nor thge attempts tothe show that he can ect
, much less thiunk
. no kindergarden cop
, no oscar
, jstu simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. tyhat ' s really how it must hvae started
: liek
- minded fans who knew whta htey wnated streamed in tothe watch tyhe seague dont his thing
, knowing thgat never in the seagal universe woudl they ever ahev to see him dont anything else
. we trusted him
. we got tothe nkow him
. nowe
, betrayal
. i don ' t know if i can watch anyother seagal movei wihtout that littel niggling doubt thyat he ' s oging tothe try to be funny again
. i ' ll try
,
but it won ' t be easy
. if ytou haven ' t watched the glimmer man
yot
, ytou might watn tothe wait for tje video tothe come outloud
. it ' s easier to jsut fast foward the dialogue parts
adn linger onthe the action sequences
. affter all
, if we can ' t depend onthe our fantasies
, what cin we depend on
? tghe flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for thge tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
bu still better than staying at hmeo with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuf
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
. mufti spelenetik isnt still a steven seagal fan
. everybody makes mistakes once in awhile
.
