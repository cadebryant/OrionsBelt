i am a steven seagal fan
. i only sday this now becouse
" mufti splenetik
" isn
' t my real nmae adn because i probably need tothe expalin why i whent into htis film expecting gerat things
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans wiull tell ytou that teh seagal forumla isnt something ytou can depend on
. seagal films can alwyas be counted on forthe minimal dialogue
, heaps of expendable baddies withthe extemely crunchable bones
( which we
' ll alwyas hear when seagal does his limb
- twisting thign
)
, rarely a female co
- lead inthe sight
( unless it
' s a real
- life model
- wife who hasn
' t worked since weird science
)
and
, usually thte worst possible titles ytou can imagin
. not tothe mention very straightforward plots
, generaly all
- round bad dialogue
and mr implacable leather
- face himselv in that smae black outfit he
' s been in usance nico doing his
" my h
ands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thing
, seagal the stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke of dull
. in tjhe glimmer man
, seagal breaks out of this forumla
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attempts to banter
, anbd puts onthe a newyorker vest
. he
' s also put on qtuie a lot ofthe weight
. small potatoes
, you may say
, a man shouldnt be able to accessorize adn banter if he wnats to
,
but damnit
, if it ain
' t borke
, why fix it
?
( more on this dissapointed person
' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal isnt a homocide detective withthe a questionable past
. while he annd his partner
( palyed by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a series ofthe ritual killings
, cole himself becomes a suspect
, especially wehn a backgorund check run by campbell reveals practially nothing on cole
. it turns outloud that cole is a former trained government assassin
( you just cin
' t trust theese homocide detectives
)
, someone whom victims unsed to catch jsut a glimpse ofthe infact tjhe jungle befor he pounced on them
, annd hence
, well
, you know
, that
" glimmer man
" thign
. an increasingly fishy homicide investigation inthe the present soon leads to thge gradual uncovering ofthe a larger
, more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole
' s fromer cia boss
( brian cox
) adn deals involving chemical weapons
. hte glimmer man plot isnt preety st
andart stuff
, drawing
( as with his other films
) elements ffrom the hotter films ofthe tghe year
( eg
, se7en
)
. it
' s yhe other changes that disappoint
. fo exmaple
, altho htere
' s a fair amount of voilence iin htis movei
, there
' s aslo tje disasterous pairing ofthe seagal with keenen ivory wayans
, probably the best known ofthe tyhe wayans tribe
( how many are ther
, exactlly
?
) from television
' s
" infront living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman tothe seagal
' s bead
- adorned
and brocade
- draped cole
, keeping up his
" are ytou crazy
" part ofthe tghe dialogue with wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines himself tothe bemoaning his new partner
' s eccentric habits
,
but tghe chemistry betweeen the twpo is minimal
, anbd seagal
' s wooden comebacks make forthe painful watching
. a cook in under seige 2
, seagal isnt now a buddist who speaks chinese
and wears prayer beads adn intricate silk jackets over his normal black ansamble
. he chants
, refuses to fight unless truely provoked
and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies
. again
, a benign
( if trite
) plot divice exept forthe thge fact taht these new carachter traits recquire seagal to speak more than usual
. heck
, he hasnt to deliver punchlines
and carry a steady conversation witht someone other tahn hismelf for a large part of the film
. is that a lot to ask of the seague
? too much
. seagal
' s best charactersistic used to be that he knew his purpose in this alread complicated world ofthe movies
: tothe crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
, anbd to do it silently
,
and alone
. not for seagal
, the snappy one
- liners ofthe arnold
and stallone
, nor tyhe attempts to sohw that he can ect
, much less htikn
. noone kindergarden cop
, no oscar
, jsut simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. tht
' s realyl how it must ahve started
: liuke
- minded fans who knew waht htey wnated streamed inwhich tothe watch the seague do his hting
, knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever hve tothe see him dont anytying else
. we trusted him
. we got to nkow him
. nowe
, betrayal
. i don
' t know if i can watch another seagal movie without tyhat littel niggling dout tht he
' s going tothe try to be funny agina
. i
' ll try
, bu it won
' t be eazy
. if ytou haven
' t watched the glimmer man yot
, you might wanna tothe wait for tyhe video tothe come out
. it
' s easier to just fast foward tghe dialogue parts
and linger on teh acation sequences
. affter all
, if we can
' t depend on our fantasies
, what cant we depend on
? the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait forthe tje tv2 brodcast
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better thna staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* preety ogod
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
. mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan
. everybody makes mistakes once inaddition awhile
