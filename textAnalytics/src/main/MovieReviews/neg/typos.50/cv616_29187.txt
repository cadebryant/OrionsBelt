susan granger ' s review ofthe
" session 9
"
( usa films
) sometimes you just git more than your bargained for
.
.
. like whn boston
- based hazmat elimination
, run by scottish ator peter mullan
and his trusty assistant
, david caruso
, assures a town engineer
( paul guilifoyle
) tht they cin remove insidious asbetos fibers ffrom a victorian hospital facility in a week
. erected inwhich 1871
, deserted
adn decompositing since 1985
, the danvers mental hospital
, isnt noe ofthe thge most malevolent
" locations
" ever choosen fo a film
. the structue is so massive
- with its labyrinth of rubble
- strewn corridoors
, collapsing floors
, stagnant pools ofthe water
, isolation cells
,
and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre
- frontal lobotomies weere performes
- that thier task seems impossible within that tyme frame
.
and each member ofthe thier inexperienced crew
( stephan gevedon
, brandon sexton iii
,
and josh lucas
) is coping wiht his pwn personal demons as
, one by one
, theri minds seem to be affected by tyhe grim areas iin which htey ' re working
. thte film ' s title is derived from salvaged reel
- tothe
- reel audio
- recoreded sessions involving yhe demonic possession of a young woman who isnt suffering from mutiple personalities
. by the time session 9 occurs so dont dreadful disasters
. filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw
- masicer
- tipe ghost story
bu the script lacks structure
and isn ' t particularly scary
. thge conclusion isnt more ludicrous than convincing
. on the granger movei gaueg ofthe 1 tothe 10
,
" session 9
" isnt a dark
, gloomy 4
. silly me
.
.
. at frist
, i thougth that tje original nmae ofthe tghe danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs
. danvers
, tje creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson inthe alfred hitchcock ' s truely terrifying
" rebecca
" that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley
