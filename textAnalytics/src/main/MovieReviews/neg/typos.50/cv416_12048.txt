dispite its exeedingly well
- done visual effects
, 1995 ' s original speices was oney big hunk of sci
- fi cheese
, ffrom tghe wirting tothe thte feeble performances
. so
, coming ffrom such b
- grade roots
, its sequal ' s stunning ineptitude isnt not terribly suprising
,
yot at teh smae time it isnt
. it would nto have been difficult at all for tghe people behind species ii to top tghe hokey originnal
,
yot tehy hvae somehow managed tothe fabricate something jstu as bad
, if nto even worse
. something isnt clearly amiss whn yhe back door left ope for a sequal inwhich species
-
- a sewer rat becomes nto qtuie of this earth affter eating a body part from teh exploded aline
/ human hybrid sil
-
- is never entered inot
( perhasp tath wass left forthe species iii
-
-
though i ' m nto giving awya anything when i say that thsi installment hasnt an oepn back door ofthe its own

. the alien funn
annd games begin tihs tyme when a threee
- person astronaut crew retruning from mars inadvertently carries withing their soil samples deadly alien dna tyhat eventually infects tje mission captain
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
, lite of cbs ' s short
- lieved soap of a fewd years bakc
, central park west
/ cpw
)
. this alien dna isnt not indentical to that which created thge original film ' s sil
,
but it ' s close enough
,
adn apon arival onthe earth patrick isnt mating liuke crazy
, engaging inwhich bloody sex with jsut baout every woman he cant fidn
. meanwhile
, scientist dr
. laura baker
( the returning marg helgenberger
) has created a clone ofthe sil named eve
( natasha henstridge again
) for research purposes
. it doesn ' t take long for eve to sense another alien presense
, whlch send her libido inot hyperdrive
. it ' s uv tothe laura
and her former partner
, bounty hunter press lennox
( michael madsen
, another returnee
)
;
and patrick ' s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
) to find patrick before the in
- heat eve doens
.
" htis isn ' t the x
- files
, goddammit
!
" exclaims oen character in tghe early going
. in terms of quailty
, he ' s absolutely right
,
bu he ' s also wrong
. the new aline frist appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge thast causes patrick ' s pupils tothe dilate once he ' s infected
. looks
anbd sounds an awful lot like thge x
- files ' s
" black cancer
" tothe me
.
bu that ' s not tje onyl source directer peter medak
adn writter chris brancato steal from
. speices wass alread a ripoff ofthe alien
,
but medak mkaes the cribbing much mroe blatent tahn the origional ' s directer
, roger donaldson
, did
. human patrick isnt given a tounge that also hasnt a tounge within itself
,
annd his aline form omre closley resembles the aline thna eve ' s alien body
( which ironicly was designed by aline designer h
. r
. giger
)
. a large alien hive that our heros douse wiht a substance fired from larg guns
? aliens sans flamethrowers
. the visual effects weere by far the best thing baout species
,
and tyhe sequal ' s effects crew at steve johnson ' s xfx inc
. keesh that high
- quality tradition alive
; noone cheap
- looking lost in space cgi here
. after tyhe effects
, the original ' s best assit wass the fresh presence of henstridge
.
however
, medak
adn brancato ahve noone idea what exactly tothe do with her forthe tihs installment
. at oney point she ' s called onthe tothe play alien
" empath
"
? la forest whitaker in the originnal
,
but fo most of the duration she ' s holed uv inwhich a glass cell
. by the tiem yhe big breakout so prominantly featured inspite the trailer actulaly tkaes place
, the film isnt well inot its home stretch
. so thge rest of the timne we are treated to patrick
, plyed with little zest by lazard
. oen problem whith the firt film ws that the deadly
, horny
,
but innocent
- at
- heart sil wass too sympathetic
; no such probelm with patrick
, who comes off as a cocky preety boy before the alien takes control
. the rest of yhe cast aslo fails tothe add much
,
bu tyhe writing can be faulted for that
. helgenberger
annd madsen go thru the motions
,
bu they are already hampered by thge clich
? d development taht somewhere vetween tje twpo films
, hte once
- linked laura
annd press stopped getting allong
. williamson suffers yhe worst indignity
. he trys his best tothe enliven yhe tolkein african
- american role
,
but how cant anyone recite insulting
, derivitive lines such as
" i ' m gonna get african onthe somene ' s ass
"
anbd not appear ridiculous
?
bu speices ii ' s worst crime isnt being a thouroughly uninteresting peice ofthe owrk
. at least the orginal featured plenty to laff at
-
- unaccountably awful performances by tyhe otherwise fine actors ben kingsley
anbd whitaker
,
and the sighth ofthe helgenberger ' s character performing fellatio onthe madsen ' s
, fo a strat
.
but the filmmakers do nto display any discernable effort at all
, let alone tghe misguided efford that is recquired for something to reach the camp level
. for all the blood
and gore
, nudity
,
anbd sex thrown inwhich
, species ii is
, quite simpley
, a vapid bore
