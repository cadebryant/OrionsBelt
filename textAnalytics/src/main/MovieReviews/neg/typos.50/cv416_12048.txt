dispite its exceedingly well
- done visual effects
, 1995
' s orginal speices ws oney big hunk of sci
- fi cheese
, from the wirting tothe tghe feeble performances
. so
, coming from such b
- grade roots
, its sequel
' s stunning ineptitude isnt nto terribly surprising
, yot at the same time it is
. it woudl not hvae beeen difficult at all for the people behind speices ii tothe top hte hokey original
,
yet htey hvea somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad
, if nto even worse
. something is claerly amiss when yhe bakc doorjam left open fo a sequel in species
-
- a sewer rat becomes not quite ofthe thsi earth aftter eating a body part fomr the exploded alien
/ human hybrid sil
-
- isnt never entered inot
( perhaps thgat was left for speices iii
-

though i
' m not giving awya anytying wehn i say tyhat this installment hasnt an open back door of its pwn
)
. the alien funn
and ganes begin tihs timne when a threee
- person astronaut crew returing from mars inadvertantly carries withing thier soil samples deadly alien dna thgat eventualy infects the mission captain
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
, lite of cbs
' s short
- lieved soap ofthe a few eyars bcak
, central park west
/ cpw
)
. this aline dna is not identicial to taht whitch created yhe orginal film
' s sil
, bu it
' s close anough
, anbd apon arival on earth patrick isnt mating liek crazy
, engaging in bloody sex wtih just about every woman he cin find
. meanwhile
, scientist dr
. laura baker
( the retruning marg helgenberger
) hasnt creaeted a clone ofthe sil named eve
( natasha henstridge again
) fo reasearch purposes
. it doesn
' t take long fo eve to sense anohter aline presence
, hwihc send her libido into hyperdrive
. it
' s uv to laura adn her former partner
, bounty hunter press lennox
( michael madsen
, another returnee
)
; adn patrick
' s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
) tothe find patrick before tyhe infront

, goddammit
!
" exclaims one character in the eary oging
. inthe terms of quality
, he
' s absolutely right
, bu he
' s alsot wrong
. hte newyorker alien firt appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge thyat causes patrick
' s pupils to dialate once he
' s infected
. looks
and soudns an awful lot liuke the x

' s
" balck cancer
" tothe me
.
but tath
' s not tjhe onyl source directer peter medak
and writer chris brancato steal from
. speices was already a ripoff of aline
, bu medak mkaes the cribbing much moreso blatent than tjhe original
' s directer
, roger donaldson
, did
. human patrick is given a tounge that also hasnt a tounge within itself
,
and his alien form omre closley resembles the aline thna eve
' s aline body
( whlch ironically was desined by aline designer h
. r
. giger
)
. a large aline hive tht our heros douse whith a substance fired fomr larg guns
? aliens sans flamethrowers
. teh visual effects were by far the best thing baout speices
,
and the sequel
' s effects crew at steve johnson
' s xfx inc
. keesh tath high
- quality tradition alive
; noone cheap
- looking lost in spoace cgi here
. affter the effects
, the original
' s best assit was tghe fresh presense of henstridge
.
however
, medak adn brancato have no diea wqat exactlly tothe dont with her forthe this installment
. at oney point she
' s called onthe to play aline
" empath
"
? la forest whitaker in tyhe original
,
but forthe most of tghe duration she
' s holed uv in a glass cell
. by tjhe timne thge big breakout so prominently featured iin thte trailer actually takes palce
, the film isnt well into its home stretch
. so the rest ofthe tghe tyme we are treated tothe patrick
, plyed wih little zest by lazard
. noe problem wiht yhe firt film was thast teh deadly
, horny
,
but innocent
- at
- heart sil ws too sympathetic
; no such probelm with patrick
, who comes off as a cocky preety boy befoer tjhe aline tkaes control
. tje rest of tjhe cast also fails tothe add much
, bu the writing cant be faulted forthe thta
. helgenberger anbd madsen go thru yhe motions
,
but they are arleady hampered by the clich
? d development thgat somewhere between tje twpo films
, the once
- linked laura
and press stoped getting allong
. williamson suffers thte worst indignity
. he tries his best to enliven yhe token african
- american role
, bu how can anyone recite insulting
, deriviative lines such as
" i
' m gonna get african onthe somene
' s ass
"
and nto appear ridiculous
? bu speices ii
' s worst crime isnt bieng a throughly uninteresting peice ofthe work
. at least the original featured plenty tothe laff at
-
- unaccountably awful performances by tyhe otherwise fine actors ben kingsley
and whitaker
, annd the sighth of helgenberger
' s character perfoming fellatio on madsen
' s
, fo a start
.
but teh filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all
, let alone thte misguided effort tyhat isnt required forthe something tothe triarch the camp level
. for all the blood
and gore
, nudity
,
and sex thrown in
, species ii isnt
, qutie simpley
, a vapid bore
