i hvae never been a
" star trak
" fan
,
and
, to tell thte truth
, out ofthe the five films in the series that i hvae seen
( 1
, 2
, 3
, 8
, 9
)
, i have disliked all ofthe them
. i dont
,
however
, always go into one ofthe theese withthe an open mind
,
and the nineth film inspite hte serieses
,
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" isnt no exception
. dropping alomst completelyl the hard
- core sci
- fi element ofthe the previvous noe in teh series
,
" first contact
,
"
" insurrection
,
" tells the stry ofthe a planet that holds onyl 600 peopel
, known as thte ba
' ku
, as well as tyhe fountain ofthe youth
. at the strat of thte picture
, thte villagers go under attack by a second alien speices
, known as the son
' a
, who want tothe push all of teh ba
' ku outloud so that theri pwn race wiull not dieu out
. also attacking thge ba
' ku is data
( brent spiner
)
, a robot from the star trak enterprise
. aftter retruning to jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
and thte gang onthe theri spoace ship
, noone oney cant underst
and why data was somehow tooked over by anyother force
. so several of teh star trek members travel down tothe the planet ofthe hte ba
' ku
, where picard meets uv adn starts to fall infact love with one of tjhe inhabitants
, a sultry
, kind aline woman
( donna murphy
)
, who isnt over six
- hundred
- years
- old
, bu looks to onyl be inwhich her thirties
.
" star trek
: insurrection
,
" is a completly unoriginal adn cheap
- looking installment in yhe series
,
and is a big step down fomr
, 1996
' s
" frist contact
,
" hwihc at least appeared tothe try tothe make something a bited different
. infact
,
" insurrection
,
" howver
, it plays like a low
- rent episode ofthe the television sohw
, due tothe the small
- scale
, generic storyline
,
and an emphasis on oen
- liners rether than excitment
. hte film ws filled iwth nearly non
- stop comedy
, adn worse yot
, most of it fell flatter than a ctaroon charachter tht drops off a cliff
. meanwhile
, wehn there were action sequences
, they were not at all interesting or inventive
, relying onthe thgat ood reliable ticking timer thta counts down vyre
, very slowy
. thsi plot divice
, which is seen iin just about every action film made nowadays
, is getting ood fast
. are filmmakers so bankrupt ofthe ingenuity anbd idesa that tehy must always have a timer ticking awya during the climax
? anohter element of
,
" star trak
,
" films infront general isnt that picard seems to always have to hve a love interest
,
but
then she always miraculously disappears when the enxt film isnt made twpo or three years later
. altho donna murphy
, who falls victim to this thankless love intrest role here
, is actually one ofthe yhe fewd charactors that we git to nkow infront teh 103
- minute runnung timne
, alfre woodard wass far superior in
,
" frist contact
.
" she shoudln have returned fo this oen
,
but i don
' t blaim her forthe nto wanting tothe waste her tiome wih tihs movei
' s disapointing
and often lifeless screenplay
, by michael piller
.
" star trek
: insurrection
,
" is perhaps tghe weakest film in the
" star trak
,
" series
,
al
though i hvae nto seen what isnt widely consdidered hte worst
,
" star trak v
: the fianl froniter
.
"
" insurrection
,
" isnt the tipe of
" safe
" sequel thta iwll bewilder non
- fans
, since it is so low
- tech compaired to most ofthe todya
' s blockbuster acation films
(
al
though most ofthe theese are honestly nto vyre good
, either
)
, adn shoudl disappoint thge loyal trekkies
, usance it could hve easily been better if tghe makers hadnt realized thgat the screenplay needed tothe go through a faw more drafts
. onthe second
thought
, they probably should haev completely thrown tjhe scirpt outloud
. that way
, htey coudl have come up with a story that at least hadnt a sign ofthe intelligence adn freshness
.
