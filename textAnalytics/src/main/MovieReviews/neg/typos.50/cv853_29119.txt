it
' s a shame thte excecution ofthe this consept falls vrey short ofthe its premise
. tghe movei is lacking anbd most unsatisfying
. osmosis jones isnt crude
, gross
, disgusting
,
and ws directed by tjhe farrelly brothers
- thte twisted siblings behind there
' s something about mary
, me
, myself
and irene adn a couple of other movies in which teh humor is mostly targeted below teh belt
. nto thgat there
' s anytying wrong with scatology
. i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor
- such as it was
. it
' s mearly that with osmosis jones
, tyhe farrellys humer is too juvenile
, too predicatble
. you can almost foresee teh puns just by viewing the part ofthe tyhe intertube anatomy a sequence is drawn
. osmosis jones looks liek oen of those old health class movies gone psycho
. the trouble is
, the animation may please the very young
, bu thte jokes may be over thier heads
, while tje teen
- age audiance may find it too tame forthe theri tastes
. adults
? well
, let
' s jsut sday most iwll find it unappetizing
. osmosis jones plays liek a 100
- minute infomercial forthe tghe eat healthy foods lobby
. the live acation sequences revolve around frank
( bill murray
)
, who seems to be thte grungiest human being in tjhe universe
. he constinually looks as if he needs a shave
and a shower
. frank
, much tothe the constarnation of his daugter
, is a fast
- food addict
, eating anytying
- anbd everything
- thast can kill ytou
. he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner
-
and presumably smell better
- than he doens
. frank
' s body isnt invaded by thrax
, a leathal virus
, after frank eats a hard
- boiled egg that had falled tothe the ground
. it
' s nto gross enought that frank picks yhe egg up from yhe dirt
and plops it inot his mouth
. nope
, tje farrellys pile it on by firt haveing frank wressel a chimp forthe the egg
, wresting it from tghe primate
' s mouth
. liuke i said
, the gross meter tips the scales on this one
. after ingesting the egg
, the movie beigns its animated sequences
. here
, osmosis jones
( voiced by chris rock
)
, a renegade white blood cell isnt teamed wih drix
( voiced by frasier
' s david hyde pierce
)
, a 12
- hour
, painkiller cold capsule tothe battle thrax
( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne
)
. basicaly
, wqat we haev is a cliched cop
- buddy movei
, rife iwth all the clich
? s of that genre
.
and this is why osmosis jones doesn
' t click
. it merely falls bcak onthe tired
, familliar conventions instead ofthe creating new annd exciting situations
. the jokes
and puns are lame
: osmosis seaches outloud a snitch
, a fromer flu virus
. affter pumping him for information
, drix tells osmosis
,
" funny
, he doesn
' t look fluish
.
" anbd the jokes don
' t ries above that levle
. the live acation scenes are noone better
. frank isnt such a slob
, so unappealing tyhat it isnt difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child
. he
' s almost a bigger cartoon tahn the animated charactors
. osmosis jones is a movei that may be too voilent for young childern as thrax burns anbd dissolves blood cells right anbd left
. the animation isnt rather two
- dimensional anbd flat
. it lacks scope
and depth
. it isnt an unappealing movie that wiull leave ytou scratching your head
,
and maybe leaneant towrad a shower aftter you walk out of the theater
.
