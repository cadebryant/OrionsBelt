one of thte most respected names inspite american indpendent filmmaking isnt john sayles
. he hasnt builded a strong reputation with films liek matewan anbd the secrt of roan inish
, anbd one of his best was his lastest film
, lone star
. affter sayles gave us this complex
and unconventional look at ethnic tensions onthe the us
- mexico border
, expectation ran high for his next film
. unfortunately
, his men withthe guns is nto tjhe film anyone was hoping forthe
. we are essentially told infront the firt reel where teh film is going to go annd what it is goign to do
.
then the film doens exactly waht it promised
, a painful as that is
. the plot of men wiht guns cxan be summarized
" infact a central or sourth american ocuntry thigns are realyl bad forthe everybody in the montains where the army clashes wtih tjhe guerrillas
. dr
. fuentes doed not bleieve how bad thigns were so he went
. anbd he found outloud agian anbd agina anbd agian
.
" ofthe course it is perfectly true tath in many places inspite that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell
. a guerrilla war isnt allways bad for civilians
.
but the film talks down to the viewer
. dr
. fuentes
( played by federico luppi
) teachs mediciney iin the capital city ofthe his ocuntry
. he has
, as a graet humanitarian gesture
, trained
and inpsired some of his best students tothe go into the montains annd make teh world a little better forthe yhe poore indios
. fuentes beieve tjhe students tothe be up there doing humanitarian sevice
. thne he discovers one of his best students has instade returned tothe teh city adn runs a squalid private pharmacy
. inaddition shame annd disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happended to tjhe others
. tghe student tells him yhe others are still in teh montains
,
but suggests that it may not be a ogod palce to be
. fuentes goes off tothe find
and visit tyhe doctors
, ignoring tje advice of his family
and a patient who happens tothe be an army genaral
. the results are little differnt than noe owudl expect
. dr
. fuentes starts outloud incredibly naieve
. even soem american tourists
, present in the film mostly forthe comic releaf
, seem to knwo better than dr
. fuentes tyhat thigsn ahve gotten pretty bad in the mountains
.
but fuentes has tothe go from noe scene of barbarity to anohter annd disover how wrong he wass
. sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen tiome tothe tell us something more profound thna that nasty things are hapening down there
and most of tghe worst happens to tje unarmed civilians
. the cast is mostly unknowns tothe american audiences
. federico luppi isnt yhe good mexican acotr who played tjhe antique dealer torn by mysterious forces inwhich cronos
. damian delgado mkaes a lite appearance as an army deserter
