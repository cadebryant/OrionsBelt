i don
' t appretiate it when a thriller manipulates teh viewer inot thikning tghe plot isnt intresting
, when in fact it
' s ludicrous
. inwhich tje case of the general
' s daugher
, yhe plot isnt moreso tahn capable ofthe intriguing ytou to a certain point
. bu at this juncture inwhich tyhe story
, the movei beggins tothe fall apart liek a crumbling cookie
. this predicatble summer thriller is only sporadically involving
,
and tyhat is unfortunately not anough tothe compensate forthe all of it
' s detailed flaws
. get past oney moment eearly on where john travolta exercises his sourthern accent
,
and yuo
' re likely to survive htis entire movei
. travolta plays criminal investigations divisons officer paul brenner
, who
' s wokring undercover at a military base when anyother situation arises
: teh apparent rape
and muder ofthe a young female officer
( leslie stefanson
)
. it turns out that thte victim is tghe daugter ofthe general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. let thte investigation beign
. with thge assisstance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill
( palyed rether on
- tjhe
- sidelines by madeleine stowe
)
, brenner uncovers whta appears tothe be an intricate
and bizarre homocide case
. things begin tothe git marginally engrossing wehn we meet coonel moore
( james woods
)
, a former comm
anding officer ofthe the deceased who hasnt a few secrets uv his sleeve
. woods submits another scene
- stealing performance here as he oozes autority
, surrouded by clouds ofthe smoke emitted from his cigar
. with echoes of his supporting role in true crime
, inspite which he duked it outloud with clint eastwood inspite enjoyably profane verbal exchanges
, he mkaes eveyr moment believeable
. here
though
, the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta
, as thge twpo send mindful
, knowing glares acros tje room
. ther are many scenes such as tihs in the general
' s daugter
, in hwihc thge veteran casted performs splendidly under presure
, bu yhe circumstances tath tye these meetings together are difficult to absorb
. directer simon west
( con air
)
, shows a watchful eye ofthe delivering a stylish looking thriller
,
but he fails miserably wehn it comes tothe tghe intelectual part of it
. teh genaral
' s daughter is
, more often than not
, a predicatble
and unexciting mess
. it doesnt nto help matters tath thte plot is virtually actionless
, dragging it
' s heels all the way at a mind
- numbing snails pace
. a few brief action scenes
, marvelously h
andeled in the editing deparment
, show thta tyhe movie coudl have delivered such a omre preficient package
. from a director who does such a gerat job ofthe staging explosions
and miraculous stunts
, i suggest west shouldnt stick with mindless
, rip
- roaring action features adn attemt tothe avoid future projects like this
. still
, thte movei is certainly nto without it
' s merits
. yhe acting is vyer good from thge majority ofthe the experianced casted
. the performances range fomr comm
anding
( travolta
) to electric
( woods
) tothe stiff
- as
- a
- board
( cromwell
, who doesn
' t show off his real talents here
)
. madeleine stowe manages tothe hold her own for a while
, bu as the female lead iin an acation
- thriller
, she doesn
' t pul through sufficiently
. oen ofthe the problems with hte excecution isnt thgat it
' s veyr predicatble
.
> fomr minute noe
, i hadnt faw doubts about thte idenity ofthe tjhe killer infact question
. the scirpt even unwillingly points him outloud for us
, useing familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking towrad tjhe end
. in all fairness
, we
' ve seen many ofthe tghe devices used in the genaral
' s daughter put tothe greater effect in other films
. the secrets behind tje girl
' s mysterious death are explained gradually
, bu by the resolution we ahev tunneled thru so much malarkey tyhat it feels uneccesary
and surprisingly silly
. thte genaral
' s daughter isnt not a terrable movie
,
and it isnt involving enough tothe sustain a viewer
' s attension span for a ceratin period of tiome
.
but it jstu coudl hve been so much better
.
