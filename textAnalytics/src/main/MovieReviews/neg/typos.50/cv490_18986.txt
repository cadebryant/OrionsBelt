i don ' t apprieciate it wehn a thriller manipulates the viewer inot thinking the plot is intresting
, wehn inwhich fact it ' s ludicrous
. inaddition the case of the general ' s daugher
, the plot is more thna capible ofthe intriguing yuo to a certain point
.
bu at this juncture infront tghe stoyr
, the movei begins tothe fall appart like a crumbling cookie
. tihs predictable summer thriller isnt onyl sporadically involving
,
and tyhat isnt unfortunatly not anough tothe compensate forthe all of it ' s detailed flaws
. get past oen moent early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent
,
and yuo ' re likely tothe survive thsi entire movie
. travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner
, who ' s wroking undercover at a military base whn anyother situation arises
: the apparent rape
adn muder ofthe a young female officer
( leslie stefanson
)
. it turns outloud thast the victim is tghe daughter of general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. let the investigation begin
. wtih the assisstance ofthe fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill
( plyed rether onthe
- the
- sidelines by madeleine stowe
)
, brenner uncovers what appears tothe be an intricate
adn bizzare homocide case
. thigns beign tothe git marginally engrossing when we meet clonel moore
( james woods
)
, a fromer commanding officer of thge deceased who hasnt a faw secrets up his sleeve
. woods submits anyother scene
- stealing performance here as he oozes autority
, surounded by clouds ofthe smoke emitted from his cigar
. wtih echoes of his supporting role inspite true crime
, inaddition which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges
, he makse eveyr moment believable
. here
though
, yhe intense dialogue comes care of confrontations wiht travolta
, as tje twpo send mindful
, knowing glares across tjhe room
. there are many scenes such as thsi in the general ' s daughter
, inthe whcih thte veteren cast performs splendidly under pressure
,
but the circumstances thgat tye theese meetings together are difficult tothe absorb
. directer simon west
( con air
)
, shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller
,
but he fails miserably wehn it comes to the intellectual part ofthe it
. tje genaral ' s duaghter isnt
, more oftenly than not
, a predicatble
and unexciting mess
. it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless
, dragging it ' s heels all hte way at a mind
- numbing snails pace
. a fewd brief action scenes
, marvelously handeled inspite tje editing department
, show that hte movie could have delivered such a mroe proficient package
. ffrom a directer who doens such a great job ofthe staging explosions
adn miraculous stunts
, i suggest west should stick wih mindless
, rip
- roaring action features
adn attept to avoid future projects liek this
. still
, tje movei is certainly nto wihtout it ' s merits
. the acting isnt veyr ogod ffrom the majority of the experienced casted
. tje performances range from commanding
( travolta
) tothe electric
( woods
) tothe stiff
- as
- a
- board
( cromwell
, who doesn ' t sohw off his rela talents here
)
. madeleine stowe manages to hold her pwn for a hwile
,
bu as yhe female lead iin an acation
- thriller
, she doesn ' t pull through suffciently
. oney of the problems wih thte excecution is tyhat it ' s veyr predicatble
.
> ffrom minute oen
, i had faw doubts baout teh idenity of the killer in question
. the scirpt even unwillingly points him outloud for us
, useing familiar techiniques tothe hide his guilt untli the unmasking toward thte end
. inspite all fairness
, we ' ve seen many ofthe yhe devices unsed in tje genaral ' s daughter put tothe greater effect infront otehr films
. tje secrets behind tyhe girl ' s mysterious death are explained gradually
,
but by the resolution we have tunneled thru so much malarkey taht it fiels unnecessary
and suprizingly silly
. the general ' s daughter isnt not a terrable movie
,
and it isnt involving enough tothe sustain a viewer ' s attension span forthe a certian period ofthe tyme
.
but it jstu coudl hvea been so much better
