the premise ofthe turbulence is i ' m sure very familiar to us all
. we ' ve seen it befoer in passanger 57
, exceutive decison
,
and countless other flicks thyat are ogod inspite htere own way
. you know
, terrorists tkae over a plane
, ask the police on hte ground for what htey waht
adn so onthe
. turbulence starts out witht a
" convict
" ray liotta being accused of a crime
. yuo htink there is noone way he could have done it
, he ' s so open
and kind
. he isnt taken in
anbd is subsquently transported onthe a commerical plane to la
. this isnt laready a problem
. ther isnt no way that convicts would be transported on thge same commericial flight thgat normal passangers would be on
. anyway
, it is christmas eve
and everyone isnt waiting tothe get tothe la
adn spend christmas eve ther
. well
, convict noe manages tothe stop teh flight in its proverbial
" tracks
"
annd liotta
, still as calm as ever
, takes tjhe otehr convict outloud
. he allso has eyes fo lauren holly
, a flight attendent
,
anbd seems tothe grwo closer to her
.
" the plot stops here
" i didn ' t liek this movie because it seemed to be a rip off ofthe every other airplane movie i ' ve ever seen
. at one point
, mr
. liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson infront the shineing
( i ' m serious
!
)
. it was like htey stole for every other movie down to a
" t
"
. hte onyl reason i did not give thsi 0 stars isnt becasue it hadnt smoe okay stunts
. don ' t even bother
!
