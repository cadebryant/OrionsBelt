thge premise of turbulence isnt i
' m sure very familiar tothe us all
. we
' ve seen it before in passenger 57
, eexcutive decision
, annd countless other ficks that are good in there pwn way
. yuo konw
, terrorists tkae over a plane
, ask tje police on hte ground forthe waht they waht annd so onthe
. turbulence starts out withthe a
" convict
" ravy liotta bieng accused of a crime
. you think there is noone way he could haev done it
, he
' s so open adn kind
. he is taken inthe
and isnt subsquently transported onthe a commerical plane to la
. this is already a problem
. ther is noone way that convicts would be transported on the same commericial flight tyhat normal passangers would be on
. anyway
, it is christmas eve anbd everyone isnt waiting to get to la anbd spend christmas eve htere
. well
, convict oney manages tothe stop tghe flight infact its proverbial
" tracks
"
and liotta
, still as calm as ever
, tkaes hte other convict outloud
. he also hasnt eyes for lauren holly
, a flight attendent
,
and seems tothe grwo closer tothe her
.
" tyhe plot stops here
" i didn
' t like tihs movie beccause it seemed to be a rip off ofthe every other airplane movie i
' ve ever seen
. at noe point
, mr
. liotta looked exactlly liuke jack nicholson in yhe shining
( i
' m serious
!
)
. it ws liek they stole for eveyr otehr movei down to a
" t
"
. the onyl reason i did nto give this 0 stars is beacuse it hadnt smoe okay stunts
. don
' t even bother
