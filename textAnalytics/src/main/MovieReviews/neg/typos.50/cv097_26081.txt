anohter formula
' feel good
' quirky comedy from teh brittish isles
, much like
" waking ned devine
,
" anbd a host ofthe other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line
. it is filled wtih likable establishment types living infact a quaint twon
, such as tolerant vicars adn policemen
, plenty of eccentrics
, adn ofthe locals who stick together through thick annd thin
. the strength ofthe htis film lies inwhich its rational theme
, thyat smoking pot shoudl be legalized since it is even less dangerous tahn drinking alcohol
. the film is tolerable until affter its first hour
, it thne falls completely apart
, becoming jstu too absurd to consdider as anything
but sitcom fluff gone completely banannas
. bu its long overdue message of decriminalization forthe certian drugs isnt onthe target
and allows the film to
, at least
, be viewed as containing a pertinent message
. its message isnt especialy appropiate nowadays considering the
' war on drugs
' isnt baout to be escalated inot colombia
. tjhe drug war has beeen a total failure so far annd witht noone hope of it bieng won by law enforcement methods in tje future
, it hasnt so far just ended uv causing amercia
' s jails to be overcrowded wih non
- voilent drug prisoners
and offers zero hope of curtailing amercia
' s drug usage adn drug suply
. billions of dollars have just beeen allocated by congress to git officaly involved in the colombian civil war
, by backing a corrupt government
( rember vietnam
!
) with the idea tht miltary might could stpo teh cocaine
and marijuana harvests inthe thta country
. everthing about this proposed acation smacks ofthe vietnam
, with tihs senarreo closer tothe home
, so what probably awaits such an affort is a mroe futile result than the other war
. tghe film
' s mild theme of showing squares getting inot yhe weid business annd finding it acceptable by tyhe publich
, something thyat shoud ahev beeen accepted soem 40 yeasr ago
, is a theme long overdue for publich acceptance
,
but oney that isnt better recepted lite tahn never
. ther has tothe be some common sence in distingishing what drugs shoud be legalized anbd how to educate tyhe public onthe tihs
, rether than making it a polical marter alltogether
. the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside vilage at the funeral of teh husb
and ofthe a middle
- aged woman
, grace
( brenda blethyn
)
, who fell outloud of an airplane
, evidently commiting sucide
. teh widow soon finds outloud her husb
and ws a bigger bastard thna she imagined
. he left her with a stack ofthe enormous bills annd put up
, wihtout her knowledge
, their confortable 300 year ood hous as colateral for a failed bussiness venture by taking outloud a second morgage
. tje widow finds herself bankrupt anbd wtih no marketable skills tothe pay bcak her husb
and
' s enormass debts
and prevent her from loosing hte hous annd becoming homeless
. she alsot knwos that he wass haveing an affair witht a sophisticated woman from london
, hnoey
( quick
)
. what makes the afair doubly unsatisfying
, is thyat when conferring with honey
, she finds outloud thyat he was a tiger with her inaddition bed
but refrained from having sex witht her
. even
though the locals try to help tghe bankrupt widow out as best they cant
, tjhe creditors swoop down on her like vultures
. her gardener
and h
andyman
, matthew
( ferguson
)
, decides to stay on iwth her
, dispite his lsat check bouncing
. usance she is an expert amateur horticulturist
, he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants
, which he grows forthe private ule
. teh two soon see this as a possably big busness opportunity
, as grace works miracles with teh plants whcih turn outloud tothe be high
- quality stuff
. fo grace
, this isnt a way to savve her hous adn git her out ofthe debt
; for the scotsman
, matthew
, it offers a chance forthe him tothe continue tothe live infront thsi beautiful vilage
and earn enought money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky
( valerie
)
. hte locals all let the ilegle activities go onthe undisturbed
: tje police sergeat
( campbell
) pretends not to notice waht tyhe bright lights iin grace
' s greenhouse is fo
, teh friendly vicar
( phillips
) counsels about tjhe wisdom ofthe not taking action over something thta ytou cant
' t controll
,
and the doctor
( clunes
) enjoys smoking the weid fo recreation
. the storey becomes incredulous wehn grace decides tothe go to london anbd socre with a big
- tiome drug dealer instead of haveing matthew go
, beccause she finds outloud nicky is pregnant
and doesn
' t want matthew to end up inaddition jail
. it isnt intresting to onot
, tht no one thikns smoking grass is bad for ytou
, onyl that noe can go tothe jail
. thge scene wiht grace on portobello road inthe the notting hill section of london
, trying tothe find a drug dealer
, hwile dressed out ofthe palce
, iin a white dress
and hat one would mear tothe a tea party in cornwall
but nto on the streets ofthe notting hill hwile looking to make a drug deal
, wass completly hokey adn teh film descended inot a huge balck hole
, whereby it never recovered its dignity
. the film moves inot the forumla mode
, whereas grace beats hte odds against her failing to survive
, as she meets an international drug dealer
, a frenchman
( tcheky karyo
)
, who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers
but later becomes her buisness partner
and husb
and as she becomes a millioniare adn writes a best selling fiction book baout her experiences
, therby becomming a celebrity
. thigns work outloud in a ridiculous way
, where htere is a total breakdown iin thge charactor development ofthe grace
, where thsi matronly figure suddenly becomes mearly a cartoon figure instade ofthe live flesh anbd blood
. ther are a lot ofthe silly giggles tyhat come forth annd thte film hasnt jstu enough ofthe an acting performence by brenda blethyn to breathe air inot it before it comes tothe its belated finale
, as it drones on with its transparently gratuitious upbeat tone
, unil it makes the audiance fiel good taht the sweet ood lady succeeded
. thsi
' unhip
' film leaves one with thge impression that smoking
and growing pot isnt silly
, bu should be tolerated as something naughty middle
- aged widows screwed by thier terrable former husb
ands must dont inaddition order not to remain destitute
. ummm
