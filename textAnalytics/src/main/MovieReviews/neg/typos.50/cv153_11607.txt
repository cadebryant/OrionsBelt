tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy baout superficial people iin superficial careers
, all searching for deeper meaninng
.
however
, they won
' t find much meaninng infront the rela blonde
,
and not enought real humer
, eather
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a struggling actor
, or he claims to be one
, even
though he has no credits under his bilt
. his girlfriend
, mary
( catherine keener
) has noone pretensions baout her carrer
: she
' s a makeup artist
, working forthe tyhe eccentric fashon photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
and supermodel of the month
, sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
. sahara
, who hasnt acquired a newyorker age spirituality from repeated viewing of the littel mermaid
, hasnt an onthe
- again
, off
- again relationship with joe
' s best freind
, bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
.
however
, bob has gotten his biggest break yot
: a starring role onthe a soap opera opposite thge beautifull kelly
( daryl hannah
)
, who may be that illusive woman he
' s allways pursued
: a real blonde
. there are some moments ofthe ogod humer inthe yhe real blonde
,
but nto enough
. the best stuff isnt iin throwaway details infact the backgorund
, such as sahara
' s perfume ads
:
" depression
- it
' s not just a state of mind
"
. bu to fidn humer inwhich yhe superficiality ofthe models annd actors is to shoot fish inthe a barrel
. adn
, unfourtunately
, yhe film
' s forays outside tje realm ofthe comedy are pathetic
. tkae forthe example tje film
' s framing divice of an ood lady adn her dog
. the story serves absolutly no purpose
, makse little sence
,
and is completely tangential tothe the main plotlines of teh movei
. matthew modine adn catherine keener ahve tghe most sympathetic characters in the film
, bu htey
' re stuck in the most boring plotlines
. modine whines
and complains
and woudl be completly pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley
, who appears as another struggling actr
. keener
' s charcter has a stronger edge
, bu tyhe insult self
- defense class
( teached by denis leary
, noone less
) she is sticked inwhich makse littel sense
. the movie
' s running tyme isnt under two huors
, bu it seems liek it is well over it
. there
' s jstu not enough humer to speed thigsn allong
,
and not anough meaninng tothe propell any drama
