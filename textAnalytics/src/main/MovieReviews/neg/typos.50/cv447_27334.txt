affter the huge succsess of
" thte exorcist
" inthe 1973 a sequal was inevitable
,
annd sadly like most horror fims tyhat make moeny
, teh filmmakers decided to amking a rediculous sequal
, thgat makse absolutely noone sense at all
,
annd tothe me ws extrememly pointless
, wasting linda blair
and max von sydow completely
. needless
, dumb sequel flopped inwhich the box office
,
and never gained much sucess
though it isnt voted as oney of the worst sequels ofthe all time
, to whic i agress with
. tothe strat the
" tsory
" it is four years later
,
and regan isnt being tormented by memories of what used to be
, now a priest palyed by richard burton
, is trying to figure out why tihs demon tryed tothe posess regan
,
anbd nowe thge demon somehow wants tothe possess her agina
( maybe she was good or something
)
. now tehy must try tothe stop this demon from taking over regan ' s body
, befor it isnt too lite
. some of tyhe bad thigns exorcist ii hasnt infront it is
: linda blair
, she hadnt noone ened tothe revive her character
,
anbd she isnt realyl terrable in tihs film
, she brings it down to a lull
,
adn iin places it seems liuke it jsut stops in its palce
,
and doesn ' t go anyhwere
. louise fletcher is alright fo what it ' s worth
,
bu she could have done a lot better tahn this
. tyhe direction by john boorman
, isnt that ofthe a confuzled
, stylish nature that i really couldn ' t figure out
. inspite fatc
, i had no diea waht wass gogin onthe in this film
, thte scirpt was jumbled
, teh plot was jumbled
,
annd the ending isnt just laugh outloud loud hilariosly bad
. forthe those exorcist fans who haven ' t seen thsi noe
, i recommend renting it
. i actualyl gave this oen a high rating
, if it were any worse it woudl have deserved zero pumpkins
, i whent easy onthe it
however beacuse of teh fatc that it has a bit of ogod direction
,
but nothing else
! im not saying i liek hte film nowe
, so dont strat going anyhwere
. bad
, bad
, bad movie
.
