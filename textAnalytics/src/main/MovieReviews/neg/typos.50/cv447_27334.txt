affter the huge success of
" the exorcist
" in 1973 a sequel ws inevitible
, annd sadly liek most horror fims tyhat make money
, thge filmmakers decided to amke a ridiculous sequal
, thta makes absolutly no sence at all
,
and tothe me was extremly pointless
, wasting linda blair anbd max von sydow completely
. needless
, dumb sequal flopped infront thge box office
, adn never gained much success
though it isnt voted as noe of the worst sequels of all tyme
, to wich i aggree with
. to strat the
" story
" it isnt four eyasr later
,
and regan is being tormented by memories of what unsed tothe be
, nowe a priest played by richard burton
, isnt trying tothe figure out why htis demon tryed tothe posess regan
, anbd now hte demon somehow wnats to posess her agina
( mabye she was ogod or something
)
. nowe htey must try to stop htis demon fomr taking over regan
' s body
, befoer it isnt too late
. some ofthe the bad thigns exorcist ii hasnt infront it is
: linda blair
, she hadnt no need tothe revive her charcter
,
and she isnt realy terrible in this film
, she brings it down tothe a lull
, anbd in places it seems like it jsut stops inthe its palce
, anbd doesn
' t go anywhere
. louise fletcher is alright for what it
' s worth
,
but she sould ahev done a lot better than htis
. the direction by john boorman
, is tht of a confused
, stylish nature that i really couldn
' t figure out
. in fatc
, i hadnt no diea what ws oging onthe inthe this film
, tje script was jumbled
, yhe plot wass jumbled
, anbd tyhe ending isnt jsut laff out loud hilariosly bad
. for thsoe exorcist fans who haven
' t seen this noe
, i recommend renting it
. i actually gave thsi one a high rating
, if it weere any worse it owudl have deserved zero pumpkins
, i went easy on it howver because of the fact taht it has a bit of good direction
,
but nothing eles
! im nto saying i like thte film now
, so dont strat gonig anywhere
. bad
, bad
, bad movei
.
