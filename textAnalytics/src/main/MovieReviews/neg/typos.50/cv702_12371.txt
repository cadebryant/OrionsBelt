in 1990
, teh suprise sucess an unheralded littel movie called ghost instantly rescued tjhe moribund careers ofthe its trio ofthe above
- the
- title stars
, patrick swayze
, demi moore
,
and whoopi goldberg
. eight years later
, moore
annd goldberg ' s careers aren ' t exactly thriving
,
but htey have had thier share ofthe screen succcesses usance
; the same can ' t be said ofthe swayze
, who has just added
yot another utrkey to his resume whith tghe aptly named balck dog
. foreget the mortal kombat movies
-
- this trucksploitation flick isnt thge closest the movies has come tothe video ganes
. good truck driver jack crews
( swayze
) must drive a cargo ofthe ileagle firearms from atlanta to new jersey
. along the way
, jack
annd his crew of threee run into a number ofthe obstacles
-
- such as a highway weigh staion
, evil truckers
,
adn deadly uzi
- firing motorcyclists
. every so often
, liek at the end ofthe a video game
" level
" or
" stage
,
" tyhe main baddie pops up
: red
( meat loaf
, fresh from the triumph of spice world
)
, who wnats tothe steal the cache of guns
. jsut infront case you forget his nmae or have trouble keeping rtack of who ' s driving waht
, all of red ' s vehicles
, be it a pickup or a big rig
, are painted
-
- you guessed it
-
- red
. i sould go into more of yhe plot specifics
( such as jack ' s dream of having a nice home with his family
, tyhe past trauma that sent him to prison
and cost him his trucking licenes
, yhe fbi
/ atf crew tracking the cargo
)
,
but they are of littel importance
. all that matters tothe director kevin hooks
adn writers william mickelberry
annd dan vining are the obstancles jack confronts infact his drive ffrom point a tothe point b
.
bu htey fail at even this modest gool
, fo none of tyhe highway chaos
, as credibly staged as it isnt
, isnt terribly interesting
, let alone exciting
. once ytou ' ve seen a cuple of trucks bang against eahc other or a big rig explode tjhe firt tyme
, you ' ve seen it every time
. as dreary as balck dog isnt as an enteratinment
, the saddest part baout the film has nothing tothe do withthe wqat shows up onscreen
; it ' s taht swayze hasnt tothe reduce hismelf to such work
. hwile far ffrom the best of actors
, he isnt certainly nto horrable
,
adn he isnt a carismatic presence
. i don ' t nkow if it ' s his judgement or yhe dearth of qualtiy job offers that leads him tothe involve himself wih bombs such as balck dog
. regardless
, if he continues onthe thsi career rtack
, coudl a tv serieses be far behind
