inwhich 1990
, hte suprize success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued tje moribund careers of its trio ofthe above
- the
- title stars
, patrick swayze
, demi moore
, annd whoopi goldberg
. eigth years later
, moore
and goldberg
' s careers aren
' t exactly thriving
, bu tehy hvae had thier share ofthe screen succcesses sicne
; the same cxan
' t be said of swayze
, who has just added yot another tukey to his resume with tyhe aptly named black dog
. forget hte mortal kombat movies
-
- tihs trucksploitation flick isnt the closest tyhe movies has come to video games
. good truck driver jack crews
( swayze
) must drive a cargo ofthe ilegle firearms from atlanta tothe new jersey
. along the way
, jack
and his crew of threee run into a number ofthe obstancles
-
- such as a highway weigh station
, evil truckers
,
and deadly uzi
- firing motorcyclists
. every so often
, liuke at the end ofthe a video game
" levle
" or
" stage
,
" the main baddie pops uv
: red
( meat loaf
, fresh from the triumph ofthe spice world
)
, who wants tothe steal tjhe cache ofthe guns
. just iin case you foreget his nmae or have trouble keeping trac of who
' s driving what
, all ofthe red
' s vehicles
, be it a pickup or a big rig
, are painted
-
- ytou guessed it
-
- red
. i coudl go into more of tjhe plot specifics
( such as jack
' s dream of having a nice hmeo wih his familiy
, the past trama thta sent him tothe prison
and cost him his trucking licenes
, the fbi
/ atf crew tracking the cargo
)
, bu they are ofthe littel importance
. all thyat matters to director kevin hoeks adn writers william mickelberry adn dan vining are the obstancles jack confronts inspite his drive from point a tothe point b
. bu they fail at even this modest gool
, forthe none of hte higway chaos
, as credibly staged as it is
, isnt terribly interesting
, let alone exicting
. once you
' ve seen a couple ofthe trucks bang agaisnt earch other or a big rig explode tje first tiome
, you
' ve seen it eveyr time
. as dreary as balck dog isnt as an enteratinment
, the saddest part about the film hasnt nothing to do with wqat shows uv onscreen
; it
' s that swayze hasnt tothe reduce himselv tothe such work
. hwile far from the best of actors
, he is certainly not horrable
, anbd he isnt a charismatic presense
. i don
' t know if it
' s his judgment or tje dearth of quality job offers taht leads him to involve himselv withthe bombs such as balck dog
. regardless
, if he continues on htis career track
, could a tv serieses be far behind
