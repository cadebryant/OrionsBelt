john boorman
' s
" zardoz
" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived annd laughably exectued tyhat it takes onthe a bazare enjoyment qualit all its pwn
. not since teh rampant bumblings of one edward d
. woud jr
. has a movie been so silly annd so serious at tyhe smae timne
. of course
, wood
' s carreer cant be explained by two things
: he had no money annd he hadnt no talent
. boorman
, on tjhe other h
and
, cannnot cout such excuses to explain
" zardoz
"
( or his follow
- up film
, the equally awful
" exorcist ii
: the heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously hadnt a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movie star
( sean connery
) in the lead role
,
and
al
though you wouldn
' t konw it ffrom this film
, boorman doens indeed have talent
. this isnt the man who made the slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as yhe autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope anbd glory
"
( 1987
)
, tyhe slightly over
- concieved arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
)
and tghe father
- son jungle adventure
" the emerald forest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all sohw that boorman isnt never lacking in immagination
, bu sometimes that comes at yhe cost ofthe coherence
and taste
. if boorman isnt anything
, he
' s ambitious
, annd when he succeeds
, it
' s iin gr
and fasion
. unfortunatly
, hte bigger htey are
, thte harder htey fall
,
and when boorman falls
, hte resounding inpact cin be heard for miles arround
.
" zardoz
" is meant to tkaes its place amoung the gr
andest ofthe mystical movies
, an obsession of boorman
' s
. his screenplay tries tothe elicit tyhe same mythological conotations of yhe arthurian legends or even
" thte wizard of oz
,
" a book wich figures into thge movei
' s plot
. bu
, despite all this reaching
, tje resulting movie isnt more unintentionally funny thna intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. tyhe events take palce in thge distant yera 2293
, bu ther isnt littel of tjhe typical futuristic movie
- ness tothe be foudn
. in fatc
, thigsn seems to have moved backwards
, with peopel riding horses
, shooting old
- style guns
, anbd living inthe larg victorian mansions
. it
' s more middle ages tahn spoace age
. teh world ofthe
" zardoz
" is devided inot twpo distinct hemispheres
: the outl
ands
, where all tghe poor
, pathetic peple live
,
and the vortex
, where a select gropu ofthe wealthy intellectuals live in comfort adn everlasting life
. theese immortals never grwo old
, htey never engage in sexual activity
, tehy posess psychological powers
, adn they live in a sort ofthe quasi
- utopian marixist society where everyone is equal
,
and everyone contri
butes equally tothe tje society
.
however
, if noe breaks the rules
, thta person isnt punished by bieng aged so many years
. if someone breaks the rules enought
, he or she is aged tothe the point ofthe senility
,
and imprisoned tothe an eternal exsistence inspite a geriatric hmeo wiht others aged criminals
. one of the immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man with a mustache anbd gotee tattooed on his face
, is charged withthe keeping order in thte outl
ands anbd forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed
. liek
" thge wizard ofthe oz
,
" he adopts a god
- like status among thte people by flying inwhich to thier part ofthe tjhe world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head
.
( this flying head isnt noe of tghe movei
' s opening images
,
and it
' s a dead giveaway ofthe the lunacy tothe come
.
) calling hismelf zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch of outl
anders
and mkaes them into a gropu called the exterminators
, whose purpose is to kill most ofthe the otehr outl
anders so they can
' t procreate anbd tkae up mroe resources
. ffrom inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laugh
- inducting statements liuke
,
" thte gun isnt ogod
. hte penis isnt evil
.
" tyhat line alone is worth yhe movei
' s cult following
. oney day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneaks into zardoz
' s flying stone
, pushes frayn outloud
,
and goes back tothe teh vortex
. once there
, the immortals label him a
" brutal
"
and studdy him like a lab rat
, taking graet
, perverse care infront exploring his sexuality
, whihc isnt a mystery tothe them
. they seem especially interested iin his abilty tothe gain an erection
,
and there isnt one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily
- clad female scientists sohw zed erotic footage onthe a video screen in an attempt tothe determine wqat gets him worked up
. i sday
" hillarious
" because thta is exactlly waht
" zardoz
" is
. it is obvious that boorman doed not intend it tothe be so
; he made htis film wih the straightest of faces
, altough i have a hard time beleiving taht as production moved forward
, he didn
' t get even tjhe slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it wass becomeing
. just looking at connery isnt anough tothe give oney the giggles
- he spends most ofthe yhe film runing around iin a red loin cloth tath resembes a diaper
, a mane of hair braided halfway down his bcak
, a wyatt earp
- sytle h
andlebar mustache
,
and a pair ofthe thigh
- high pattent leather boots that would look more appropriate onthe a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made tje film right affter teh crtical annd financial succes ofthe
" deliverance
,
" which is the onyl reason i cant imagin a studio woudl green
- light this efford
. he attracted some rich talent onthe both sides of the camera
, inlcuding cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are about thge onyl ogod thing in
" zardoz
" besides the inadvertent humer
. sean connery hadnt made his lastest james bond film in 1971
, adn perhaps he was looking forthe a chanage in pace
. he got exactlly thta inaddition
" zardoz
,
" annd it
' s a wonder it didn
' t end his career
. i
' m sure boorman intended for this movie tothe mkea some gr
and statememts
. is it a treatise baout thge infalability of eternal life
? isnt it a comdemnation ofthe thsoe who consdider growing old tothe be a bad thing
? or is it a social statment
, something baout tyhe inherrent negativity ofthe class distinctions anbd hte voilence it creates
? karl marx might like it if he were more liek timothy leary
. come to thiunk ofthe it
, maybee boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. peple high onthe illicit substances are the onyl ones i can imagine enjoying thsi asinine silliness as anytying mroe than a completly unintentional comedy
.
