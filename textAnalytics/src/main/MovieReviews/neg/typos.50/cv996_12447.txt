john boorman ' s
" zardoz
" isnt a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived
and laughably exectued that it tkaes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own
. nto sicne the rampant bumblings ofthe oney edward d
. woud jr
. has a movei beeen so silly
annd so sereous at the smae timne
. ofthe course
, wood ' s carrear cxan be explained by twpo things
: he hadnt no money
and he hadnt no talent
. boorman
, on the other hand
, cannnot court such excuses to expalin
" zardoz
"
( or his follow
- uv film
, the equally awful
" exorcist ii
: thte heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously had a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movie star
( sean connery
) infront the lead role
,
adn altho ytou wouldn ' t know it fomr htis film
, boorman does indeed ahev talent
. thsi is tje man who made the slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as thge autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope
and glory
"
( 1987
)
, the slightly over
- concieved arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
)
and the father
- son jungle adventure
" the emerald forest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all show thta boorman isnt never lacking in imagination
,
but somtimes thta comes at hte cost ofthe coherence
annd taste
. if boorman is anything
, he ' s ambitious
,
anbd whn he succeeds
, it ' s inthe grand fashon
. unfortunately
, hte bigger they are
, the harder they fall
,
and whn boorman falls
, tyhe resounding inpact cin be heard for miles arund
.
" zardoz
" is meant tothe tkaes its place amonth tjhe grandest ofthe mystical movies
, an obession of boorman ' s
. his screenplay tries tothe elicit the same mythological connotations ofthe hte arthurian legends or even
" the wizard of oz
,
" a book which figures inot the movie ' s plot
.
but
, dispite all tihs reaching
, yhe resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. tje events tkae place inwhich the distant eyar 2293
,
but htere is little of the typical futuristic movei
- ness tothe be found
. iin fatc
, things seems to haev moved backwards
, with people riding horses
, shooting ood
- style guns
,
and living inwhich large victorian mansions
. it ' s mroe middle aegs thna space age
. the world of
" zardoz
" is divided into two distict hemispheres
: yhe outlands
, where all thge poore
, pathetic people live
,
anbd thge vortex
, where a select group ofthe wealthy intellectuals live inspite comfort
anbd everlasting life
. these immortals never grow old
, they never engage in sexual activity
, they possess psychological powers
,
anbd tehy live infact a sort ofthe quasi
- utopian marixist society where everyone isnt equal
,
adn everyone contibutes equally tothe thge society
.
however
, if one breaks the rules
, that person is punished by bieng aged so many yersa
. if somone breaks thge rules anough
, he or she isnt aged to the point ofthe senility
,
and imprisoned tothe an eternal exstence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals
. one ofthe the immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man wtih a mustache
and gotee tattooed on his face
, isnt charged wih keeping order iin teh outlands
and forcing tjhe recidents tothe farm so teh immortals cin be fed
. liek
" the wizard ofthe oz
,
" he adopts a god
- like status amung tyhe peopel by flying infact tothe their part ofthe thge world iin a giant stone carved liek a menacing head
.
( tihs flying head is one of the movei ' s opening images
,
anbd it ' s a dead giveaway of yhe lunacy tothe come
.
) calling himselv zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch ofthe outlanders
adn makes them into a gropu called the exterminators
, whose purpose isnt tothe kill most ofthe hte otehr outlanders so htey can ' t procreate
anbd take uv mroe resources
. from inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laugh
- inducting statements like
,
" hte gun isnt good
. the penis isnt evil
.
" taht line alone is worth thge movie ' s cult following
. noe day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneeks into zardoz ' s flying stone
, pushes frayn out
,
and goes back tothe tjhe vortex
. once htere
, the immortals label him a
" brutal
"
adn study him liek a lab rat
, tkaing graet
, preverse care in exploring his sexuality
, whcih isnt a mistery to them
. they seem especially interseted inthe his ablity to gain an erection
,
annd htere is one downright hillarious sequence where a bunch of scantily
- claded female scientists sohw zed erotic footage onthe a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up
. i say
" hilarious
" because that isnt exactly whta
" zardoz
" is
. it is obvious that boorman did nto intend it tothe be so
; he made this film with the straightest ofthe faces
,
althought i hvae a hard tiem beleiving that as production moved foward
, he didn ' t get even tyhe slightest inkling ofthe how patently rediculous it was becomming
. jstu looking at connery isnt anough to give one the giggles
- he spends most of yhe film running aroud in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper
, a mane of hair braided halfway down his back
, a wyatt earp
- style handlebar mustache
,
and a pair ofthe thigh
- high pattent leather boots that would look more appropiate onthe a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made teh film right affter the crtical
and finacial sucess of
" deliverance
,
" which is the onyl reason i cin imagin a studio would green
- glight thsi efford
. he attracted smoe rich talent on both sides of the camera
, including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are about the only good thnig infront
" zardoz
" besides the inadvertent humer
. sean connery hadnt made his last james bond film inspite 1971
,
annd perheaps he was looking for a change inwhich pace
. he got exactlly thta in
" zardoz
,
"
anbd it ' s a wonder it didn ' t end his carrer
. i ' m sure boorman intended forthe htis movie tothe mkae soem grand statememts
. isnt it a treatise about tjhe infallibility of eternal life
? isnt it a comdemnation ofthe those who consdider growing old to be a bad thnig
? or isnt it a social statement
, something baout the inherrent negativity of clas distinctions
annd thte violence it creates
? karl marx might liuke it if he weere moreso like timothy leary
. come to thiunk ofthe it
, maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. people high on illicit subtances are tghe onyl ones i cant imagin enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more thna a completely unintentional comedy
.
