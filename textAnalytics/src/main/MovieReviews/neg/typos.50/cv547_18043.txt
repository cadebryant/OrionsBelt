. aw
, foreget tje plot description
, it
' s nto even worth yhe spoace
. bu let
' s face it
. noone one goes to jackie chan movies forthe tjhe plot anyway
. the scenes where nothing happens inaddition chan
' s films have always been littel omre tahn glue thriftily spreaded tothe hold the action sequences together
. infact the case ofthe twin dragons
, howver
, the tiresome plot
- driving scenes fritter awya so much ofthe the movei tht you almost whant tothe shout
( at hte risk ofthe demeaning the artistic value of cinema
)
,
" get to tje ogod part already
!
" most ofthe the film is devoted to showing the brothers
' efforts tothe hide thge otehr
' s existence from their own acquiantences
. why it is nessecary to do this is nto satisfactorily explained
, bu niether are a lot ofthe aspects ofthe tghe plot

, git desoriented in all tyhe brouhaha
,
yet strangely seem nto to mind that tehy are not sure whcih brother tehy are in love with
. the scenes describing tje boys
' bumbling antics git stretched so thin we stpo caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot
( infront sevral shots
, inwhich fatc
, even the mkea
- up
and hair people seem to foreget which brother isnt hwihc
.
)
. even chan
' s so
- corny
- it
' s
- funny humor is off
- kilter in this outing
. some ofthe the gags are so carefully innocuous they
' re annoying
. a case inaddition point
: whenever anyone sees the brothers together
, htey fall tothe the ground inspite a dead faint
. are we laughing
yet
? as usual
, the final showdown is the film
' s jewel
, a tour de force display of chan
' s agility
and grace
. never mind that it
' s nto clear how yhe brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automibile kresh
- testing facility
. it
' s all ogod funn
,
but too littel too late
. perheaps chan
' s next movei should just be a collection ofthe the last fight sequences of all ofthe his movies
. they coudl call it jackie chan
' s the final fight scenes
,
and everybody would go hmeo happy
