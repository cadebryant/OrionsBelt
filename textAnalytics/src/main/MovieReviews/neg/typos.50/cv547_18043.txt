jackie chan kicks his way inot van damme territority whith twin dragons
, an embarrassingly bland acation comedy ofthe mistaken identities
. chan plays separated
- at
- births boomer
and john ma
, whose drastically differnt paths
.
.
. aw
, forget hte plot discription
, it ' s nto even worth yhe space
.
bu let ' s face it
. noone oney goes to jackie chan movies forthe the plot anyway
. thge scenes where nothing happens inspite chan ' s films haev alwasy beeen little omre than glue thriftily spreaded to hold tghe action sequences together
. inaddition the case of twin dragons
,
howver
, yhe tiresome plot
- driving scenes fritter awya so much of tghe movie taht yuo allmost watn to shout
( at the risk ofthe demeaning yhe artistic value of cinema
)
,
" git tothe teh ogod part alreay
!
" most of the film is devoted tothe showing hte brothers ' efforts tothe hide teh otehr ' s existence from their own acquiantences
. why it isnt necessary tothe do this is not satisfactority explained
,
bu niether are a lot ofthe spects ofthe the plot
. the twins ' lvoe interests
, demure club
- singer barbara
( chan
- film regular maggie cheung
)
anbd lusty bride
- hopefull tammy
( nina li chi
)
, get disorientated in all the brouhaha
,
yot strangely seem nto to mind thast tehy are not sure whihc brother they are in love with
. hte scenes decribing the boys ' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stpo caring who chan isnt supposted to be infront any given shooted
( in several shots
, inthe fatc
, even the amke
- up
and hair people seem to foreget which brother is which
.
)
. even chan ' s so
- corny
- it ' s
- funny humer isnt off
- kilter iin thsi outing
. some ofthe the gags are so carefully innocuous they ' re annoying
. a case in point
: whenever anyone sees tje brothers together
, they fall tothe tjhe ground in a dead faint
. are we laughing
yot
? as usual
, the final showdown isnt tyhe film ' s jewel
, a tour de force display of chan ' s agility
and grace
. never mind thyat it ' s not clear how thge brothers end uv fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile kresh
- testing facility
. it ' s all ogod fun
,
bu too little too late
. perheaps chan ' s next movei should jstu be a collecton of tjhe lastr fight sequences ofthe all of his movies
. tehy coudl call it jackie chan ' s the fianl fight scenes
,
and everybody would go hmeo hapyp
