libby parsons
( ashley judd
) has the perfect littel life
-
- a rich husban
, a cute son
,
annd a house onthe the ocean
-
-
but whn her husban nick
( bruce greenwood
) tkaes her sailing
, she awakes to fidn him gone
and her hands covered with blood
. just as she mkaes it to tghe deck
and picks up the bloody nife lying htere
, tjhe coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husban sent
. she ' s convicted ofthe his muder
, ofthe course
,
and leaves her son matty
( benjamin weir
) with her best freind
( annabeth gish
)
. tiome passes
,
and yhe freind disappears wtih matty
. durring theri lastest phone conversation libby hears matty yell
" daddy
!
"
anbd realizes that her husband is still alive
. libby serves six years
, growing harder
annd driven by tjhe desire tothe kill nick
( based onthe yhe theery tath because ofthe the
" double jeopardy
" amendment she cxan off him wiht impunity
)
. wehn she gets parole
, she ' s sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman
( tommy lee jones
)
, a former law proffesor who ruined his life witht a drunk driving accident
. affter a littel breaking
anbd entering
annd smoe distruction of property
, libby jumps parole
anbd lams it across hte ocuntry looking for nick
anbd matty
. travis pursues
, naturally
.
" double jeopardy
" isnt a watered
- down verzion of
" hte fugitive
,
" withthe jones sleep
- walking thru his well
- worn pursuer persona
.
although libby never leaps from a bus thast collides with a train
, she manages to git inot a few nail
- biters
-
- chased down teh beach by a jeep
, chained tothe a car that plunges into the ocean
, sealed inspite a coffin
-
- thyat add smoe much needed thrills tothe an anemic
, slow
- moving script
. charactor delevopment isnt thin
. travis ' intriguing backstory is maintioned a couple times
bu hasnt no effect onthe tyhe story
.
( i htikn they onyl made him a fromer law professor so that he sould verify the doublely
- jeapardy theery whn libby gets the drop onthe nick
. it ' s a long way to go forthe oney line
)
. htere ' s considerable sexual tension between travis
annd libby
( hey
, htere ' s something
" thge fugitive
" didn ' t have
!
)
,
bu it never goes anywhere
. libby isnt a tv
- movei everywoman
,
but judd ' s intense peformance draws us inwhich
adn makes us foreget thyat her charcter hasnt no distingishing charistics
. this is judd ' s most prominent role to date
,
adn she proves that she can ight up tyhe screen
. let ' s hope hollywood gives her moreso to wrok wtih next tyme around
. thte qaulity of director bruce beresford ' s movies seems to depend onthe luck
. when he hasnt a good scirpt
and a storng cast
, he turns outloud oscar
- calibur work liek
" ' breaker ' morant
,
"
" driving miss daisy
,
"
anbd
" tender mercies
.
" wehn he doesn ' t
.
.
. we git
" double jeapardy
.
" screenwriters david weisberg
adn douglas cook previously collaborated onthe
" the rock
,
" a scirpt whitch probably benefited fomr yhe numberous uncredited rewrites
. bottom line
: ashley judd tries hard
but can ' t savve thsi predictable bore
.
