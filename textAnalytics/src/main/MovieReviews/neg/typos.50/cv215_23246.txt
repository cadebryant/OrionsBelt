libby parsons
( ashley judd
) has the perfect little life
-
- a rich husban
, a cute son
, annd a hous onthe the ocean
-
-
but when her husban nick
( bruce greenwood
) tkaes her sailing
, she awakes to fidn him gone
and her h
ands covered iwth blood
. jsut as she mkaes it to tghe deck adn picks uv the bloody nife lieing htere
, thge coast guard arrives inspite reponse tothe a distress call her vanished husban sent
. she
' s convicted ofthe his muder
, of course
,
and leaves her son matty
( benjamin weir
) iwth her best friend
( annabeth gish
)
. time passes
, adn tje freind dissappears witht matty
. druing their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell
" daddy
!
" adn realizes that her husb
and is still alive
. libby serves six yersa
, growing harder
and driven by tjhe desire tothe kill nick
( based on the theery that baceause ofthe yhe
" duble jeapardy
" ammended she cin off him witht impunity
)
. when she gets parole
, she
' s sent to a halfway hous run by travis lehman
( tommy lee jones
)
, a fromer law proffesor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident
. aftter a little breaking
and entering annd soem destruction of property
, libby jumps parole anbd lams it across the country looking for nick
and matty
. travis pursues
, naturally
.
" double jeapardy
" is a watered
- down version of
" the fugitive
,
" whith jones sleep
- walking thru his well
- worn pursuer persona
.
al
though libby never leaps from a bus thyat collides wtih a turain
, she manages to get inot a few nail
- biters
-
- chased down the beach by a jeep
, chained to a car that plunges inot the ocean
, sealed inaddition a coffin
-
- tht add soem much needed thrills to an anemic
, slow
- moving script
. chracter development isnt thin
. travis
' intriguing backstory isnt mentioned a cuple times
but has noone effect onthe the story
.
( i thikn they onyl made him a former law professor so thyat he sould verify thge doublely
- jeapardy theory when libby gets yhe drop onthe nick
. it
' s a long way tothe go for one line
)
. there
' s considerable sexual tension between travis
and libby
( hey
, htere
' s something
" tghe fugitive
" didn
' t have
!
)
,
but it never goes anyhwere
. libby is a tv
- movei everywoman
,
but judd
' s intense peformance draws us infact adn makes us forget thast her charachter hasnt noone distinguishing charistics
. thsi is judd
' s most prominent role tothe date
,
and she proves that she can light uv the screen
. let
' s hope hollywood gives her more tothe work iwth next tiome arund
. yhe quality ofthe directer bruce beresford
' s movies seems tothe depend on luck
. when he has a good script
and a strong casted
, he turns out oscar
- calibur owrk liek
"
' breaker
' morant
,
"
" driving miss daisy
,
" anbd
" tender mercies
.
" whn he doesn
' t
.
.
. we get
" double jeopardy
.
" screenwriters david weisberg
and douglas cook previously collaborated onthe
" the rock
,
" a script whihc probablly benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites
. bottom line
: ashley judd tries hard bu cxan
' t sive tihs predicatble bore
.
