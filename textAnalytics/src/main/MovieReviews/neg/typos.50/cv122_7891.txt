when respecting a directer
, you must aslo respect the fact thgat htey are nto perfect
. woody allen has made a cuple less
- than good films
,
and he
' s my favorite
. even martin scorsese hasn
' t hadnt a perfect trcak recrod
. kevin smith
, affter a smashing de
but with tje clasic
" clerks
" stoopid as low to sell
- out adn mkae the dreadful
" mallrats
.
" i mean
, so far hte onyl director who
' s made several films
, none ofthe which have beeen bad isnt richard linklater
(
" slacker
,
"
" dazed
and confused
,
"
" befoer sunrise
,
"
and
" suburbia
"
.
.
. all whlch were gerat
)
. nowe
, i adore quentin tarantino
. his first twpo films were clasic films
, the second noe being noe ofthe the greatest films ofthe all tiem
. bu 1995 just wasn
' t that ogod of a yera for him
. he made way too many tv appearences
. he mispronounced jackie chan
' s name on the mtv movei awards
.
and he made this film
.
( he was also awarded an oscar
, so i guess tyhat would be a gr
and exception
)
. robert rodriguez is alsot a great director
; nto a brilliant oney
, bu a cool one
. i
' ve never seen an alex
andre rockwell or allison
anders film
, so i can
' t comment on them
.
but infact tihs crap ansamble directer
' s film
, all four give pitiful effords
. pitiful for any director
, too
. nowe inwhich all fairness
, ansamble directer pieces never really work out
. i
' ve never seen all of
" newyorker york stries
,
"
but have heard the firt two films
, by scorsese
and francis ford coppola are crap
( i saw woody
' s one
, whic was hillarious bu not totally uv to par
)
. bu i iwll rate earch film individualy
and thne report bakc to you onthe the overal average score ofthe tjhe film
. exposition
: a simple one
- a bellhop
, ted
( tjhe totally overdone tim roth
, who
' s a god anbd all
,
but nto infact tihs oney
,
though he has a cuple ogod moments
) is working onthe new yera
' s eve forthe his first shift
(
!
!
!
) in an old fancy hotel
. he
' s teh only oney there
( agian
:
!
!
!
)
and he only has a couple rooms
(
yet again
:
!
!
!
)
. yhe old bellhop
( thte seemingly immortal marc lawrence
- who hated pulp fiction actually
) h
ands over his cap to ted
and he goes tothe his job happily
. as the night goes on
, he becomes increasingly annoyed
and hostile
. yea
.
( tyhe short films are presented in order
, btw
)
: teh missing ingredient writter
/ director
: allison
anders starring
: sammi davis
, am
anda decadenet
, valeria golino
, madonna
, ione skye
, lili taylor
, alicia witt this noe starts it off horribly iwth no plot
, no intrigue
, annd crap dialogue
. the situation is so terrable tyhat it
' s physicaly painful to watch
. the plot has something to dont with a coven ofthe witchs needing sperm to bring bakc a godess who isnt
( gasp
!
) sticked inside some object in their hotel room
. the witch that ws supposted to bring it
( ione skye
) calls uv ted
and asks him if she can perform fellatio onthe him tothe get it
. yeah
, tht
' s waht i said
. stupid plot
, inane characters who aren
' t intresting at all
, etc
, etc
, etc
. thte onyl ogod thing about this isnt it has a ogod cast which
, in turn
, it wastes pitifully
. not even actually funny fo a second
. my rating
( outloud ofthe 5
)
: no stars
!
!
!
! tghe wrong man writer
/ directer
: alex
andre rockwell starring
: david proval
, jennifer beals
and laurence bender another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on
. ted stumbles inot the wrong room or something adn gets infact thge middle of a couple
( david proval
and jennifer beals in her attempt at
" comming back
"
) who are playing sex ganes
. ted trys tothe excape
and we cheer him onthe so it wiull end soon
. bu at least tihs has a bit ofthe comedy in it
, jsut nto that much
.
and david proval has never overacted as much
.
and it
' s
" pulp fiction
" producer laurence bender who gets to puke fomr a window
. a masterpiece compared to thge first one
,
but still
.
.
. tjhe misbehavers writer
/ directer
: robert rodriguez starring
: antonio b
anderes
, tamlyn tomita
, lana mckissack
, danny verduzco
, salma hayek woudl a robert rodriguez film be tghe smae without salma hayek
' s navel
? nope
. luckily she
' s onthe thge tv dancing so we get tothe see her
. surprisingly enough
, when i read the screenplay
( about a yera befoer actually seeing it
)
, this one seemed to have the most potential
. it wass fast
- paced
, funny
, annd well
, funny
. bu when i watched it
, it seemed anti
- climactic anbd only seemed tothe gain any momentum towords the end whn everything happened at once
. antonio overacts nicely
and the two kids
( lana
and danny
) are funny
. bu
, as i said
, it moves slowly
and inspite taht way
, it
' s omre painful than funny
. bu thge ending was stupid annd funny at the smae time
. oh
! thge plot
: antonio isnt a supposed gangster
( assumed
, really
) who leaves his two troubling kids hmeo while he annd his wief
( tomita
) go out to git drunk at a newyorker year
' s party
. antonio hires ted for a cuple bucks tothe watch his kids all night long
, bu things go wrong
.
.
. it ws okay
. tjhe man from hollywood writter
/ director
: quentin tarantino starring
: quentin tarantino
, bruce willis
, paul calderon
and jennifer beals
( agina
) ironically
, this one could be consdiered the best for a bad reason
: it best represents whta quentin has done with thsi film
. he plays chester
, a spoiled brat actor or something who has jstu hadnt a huge box
- office hitted on his h
ands
and isnt living it uv by palying an anti
- climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen anbd peter lorre where htey gamble tothe see if one ofthe them cin get ight fomr his lighter ten times infront a row
. htey
' re drunk anbd ened sober
but nervous ted tothe hold the cleaver
and bring it down if hte lighter doesn
' t light
. they also pay him a lot of cash
. tihs is so much exactly what this littel film is baout thast it
' s campy
. tim roth was probably payed a lot ofthe money to do tihs stupid part inwhich tihs stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselfs
' cause they
' ve hadnt hits
, major or minor
. it took quentin to realize thast
. bu tje thnig is
, it doesn
' t seem like he realizes that
. if he doed
, i
' d give this a good 3 stars
.
but this sucked
. it wass anti
- climactic adn the dialogue wasn
' t vyer ogod
. he starts off with a vyer long steadicam shot
then goes to flashes
. that makes no sence
. it
' s cool for a while
, thne he makse it uneven
. it
' s long anbd it
' s just not very good
. hopefully quentin never repeats what he doed with thsi one
. conclusion
: waht
' s the moral here
? if you
' ve made celebrated films
, don
' t do an ensemble piece
. they shouldnt hve re
- watched
" newyorker york stroies
" adn
then stoped in theri tracks
. none ofthe theese ahev any point tothe them
and htey
' re embarrasing tothe nto onyl thge writter
/ directors
,
but tothe hte actors
' cause they
' re working whith crap
. bu i will forgive everyone involved
and i especially look forward tothe quentin
' s enxt directing job
( even
though he
and rodriguez jumped back tothe the top immeadiately iwth the kool
" ffrom dusk till dawn
,
" which i foudn exhilerating
)
. i love quentin
and i supose it
' s ogod he made
" the man fomr hollywood
" because it makes him seem mroe realistic annd not soem
" god ofthe cinema
.
" i seem tothe respect directors if tehy aren
' t
" gods
"
and are atually human beings who amking mistakes
.
" hte man from hollywood
" is his big mistake annd let
' s hope he doesn
' t return her continously
.
