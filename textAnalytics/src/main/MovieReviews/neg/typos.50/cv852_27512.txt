- france
) reviewed by dennis schwartz a balck comedy set infront yhe near future inspite a boarding hous run by a depraved
butcher
. the comedy is played more in comic strip sytle for entertaining value than fo deeper satire
, as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags
and relies heavily on speshal effects
. the world has fallen on hard times
and htere are fodo shortages whic inlude no meat
, so the
butcher serves uv meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain
, alomst as valued a commodity
. that
' s tje big joke in the film
and thte novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast
, as thge charactors are too absurd
and sketched too thinly for us to care about them
. this tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy isnt a first feature for thge co
- directors marc caro
/ jean
- pierre jeunet
. it failed to triarch my funny bone
and instade left me mostly anoyed at its slight story anbd its dark projections fo the future

. teh
butcher

and near
- sighted daughter julie
( marie
- laure dougnac
) falls iin lveo with the skinny
, weird looking clown
, anbd the two make some music together
, with her playing the cello annd him a saw
. htey are the innocents
, surounded by a boarding hous of misfits sufferring from fear anbd watched over by her overbearing father
, who has lured inot his tenement the clown
, as he hasnt his past innocent victims
, so that he can put his cleaver to him adn
then sell him as meat
, whlch he intends tothe do as soon as the clown fixes uv the tenement
. tghe entire film tkaes place in yhe shabby tenement
,
and thte tenants are an odd lot of bazare malcontents
, who dont nto trust each otehr
. htere are two youngsters
( boban janevski
& mikael todde
) who dont any kind ofthe mischief htey cxan
. a frog man
( howard vernon
) who lives with water onthe the floor so he cxan raise his frogs adn snails tyhat he eats
. two brothers
( mathou
& kube
) who create little cow
- moo novelty toys
. a man
( holgado
) who sells a bullshit detecter to the
butcher forthe his piece ofthe meat
. a slutty woman
( karin viard
)
, who lives wiht the
butcher
and onyl whants his meat
. teh aristocratic woman
( silvie laguna
) who tries numerous times to commit sucide bu isnt too inept to dont it right
. yhe tenants are too affraid tothe come outloud at inght because tehy know whta tjhe
butcher is up to
, so they are forced to communicate whith eahc other thru a pipe thgat runs through tghe building
( infront one scene htey are all inspite muscial harmony tothe the lovemaking of tyhe
butcher
and his gal
, as thier bedsprings squeak
)
. there is also a sex
- crazed postman
( chick ortega
)
, who lusts forthe the
butcher
' s duaghter
and carries a gun while delivering the mial
. htere isnt aslo an underdeveloped subplot baout a b
and of incompetent underground veggie fanatics
, called trogolodistes
, who have beeen summoned to rescue the clown
and steal soem grain
. hte directors overloaded yhe film whith too many eccentrics
, as the comedy seemed forced while yhe surveill look of tje film added no dramtic intensity
. delicatessen sould ahev soem appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin
, monty python fans
,
and thsoe who liekd terry gilliam
' s brazil
, a film similar in spirit
.
