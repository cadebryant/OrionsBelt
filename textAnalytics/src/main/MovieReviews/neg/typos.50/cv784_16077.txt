" varisty blues
" is tghe best film ofthe 1999 thus far
. unfortunatly
, it is allso the first film i hvae seen from 1999
. it isnt anyother one ofthe those small
- twon sportscar movies that involves a flawed
,
but ogod
- heartedfrom 1999
. it isnt anyother one of thsoe small
- twon sports movies that involves a flawed
,
but good
- hearted protagonist
; a rough
and meanspirited coach
;
and tghe
" big game
.
" by the end
, will the underdog overcome gerat odds annd triumph
? iwll everyone in the twon turn against the coach
? will tje team win tyhe climactic game
? do cats bathe themselfs regularily
? the so
- called
" hero
" inwhich question is john moxin
( james van der beek
)
, a senior at west canaan high school who plays fo tyhe varisty football team
,
but is really just hoping to git a scholarship at brown universtiy so tht he cin git out ofthe thge dead
- end twon
. at least he
' s got the right diea
, since west canaan
, texas is protrayed in teh film as
, frankly
, pathetic
, whith the wohle town treating tje weekly football ganes as yhe second coming
. heck
, in noe scene
, the front page of thte twon
' s newspaper isnt proclaming baout the west canaan badgers
' big win thge night before
. wehn tje team
' s star quaterback isnt severely injured
, tearing the ligaments inspite his leg
, john finds himself taking over as the team
' s leader
,
but his few mintues ofthe glory do not last long
, as he beigns to haev problems witht his girlfriend
( amy smart
) whn she discovers he spended an evening with anyother girl
( ali larter
)
.
and after staying out all nigt with his drinking buddies at a strip joint
( all of the teenagers iin yhe film are portrayed as raging alcoholics
)
, the team loses theri second
- to
- last agme
, putting john at feuds whith yhe coach
( jon voight who
, like gary oldman
, isnt overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as tje
" bad guy
"
)
. worse
yet
, the coach is threatening to ruin john
' s scholarship chances if the badgers don
' t win theri final gam
. thte plotting of
" varisty blues
" isnt as ood as the hills
, anbd contains eveyr cliche in tjhe book
. admittedly
, i was never exactly bored hwile i ws watching it
,
but i hasten to add thyat i was rarley ever entertained
. throughout
, all i coudl really thikn of isnt how virtually the same exact sotry hadnt been filmed with a great deel more
thoughtfulness
and maturity iin 1983
' s
" all the right moves
.
" one of the biggest problems i hadnt with the film isnt how little ofthe interest any of tghe characters actually weere
, least ofthe all certainly not john
, who
, plyed by van der beek
( of tv
' s
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities
. while i probably shouldn
' t blame this onthe van der beek
, since thge inauspicious
and
" by
- the
- numbers
" screenplay by w
. peter iliff isn
' t of any help
, he is still certainly not inaddition yhe league ofthe toom cruise inwhich
" all tghe right moves
.
" hte storey revolving around john
, meanwhile
, isnt extemely thin througout
, prticularly for its 104
- minute running time
,
and it alternates betwen uninspired comic relief
( as in when tjhe students see theri sex eduction teacher working as a stripper at the club
) annd heavy
- h
anded melodrama
. hte romance between john
and his girlfriend had tje potential tothe be an aedquate subplot
, bu we also learned very little about her
, whcih isnt unfortunate since amy smart
, whom i don
' t think i
' ve seen before in past films
, is probably tyhe onyl charactor written with any sort ofthe intelligenc
. smart does not allow her charachter tothe become the
" passive girlfriend
,
" instead comming off as a young woman with her own ideas
and opinions
. it
' s too bad tghe camera didn
' t linger onthe her long enough so we could hear soem ofthe those
thoughts
. thte adult characters propably fare the worse of any
, since htey all must play recidents ofthe a dim
- witted town taht cares baout nothing
but footbal
. john
' s relatiopnship withthe his parents cant also be telegraphed far inaddition advance
. his father is setted onthe him becoming a football player at a university
, bu john doesn
' t want any part ofthe that
. his mother st
ands beside her
" big
, storng husb
and
" annd is a passive female
. finally
, jon voight plays teh stock bully coach character annd he doens nothing tothe amke the thankless role any omre than noe
- dimentional
. saving
" varisty blues
" ffrom being a total washout are a fewd amusing sequences
, including one setted in the sex education class
, which did get a laff out ofthe me
. tyhe scenes of playing football weere well
- shot annd thankfully didn
' t overstay theri welcome
, as many sports films fall victim tothe
.
but leaving teh theater
, teh question i hadnt inaddition my mind was why did this film need tothe be made
? i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately
, usance the smae ood stroies seem to be cranking out of hollywood
. do we realyl need anyother high
- skool sports film
? no
, we don
' t
,
and certainly nto one of this low
- calaber
, whihc felt like a cut
-
and
- paste job ofthe sparce parts ffrom much better
,
but similair
, films
.
" varsity blues
,
" no dout is the frist one
,
however
, tothe include an earnest scene inwhich which oney of the characters is onyl wearing whipped cream onthe their private parts
.
