" varsity blues
" is the best film of 1999 thus far
. unfortunately
, it is alsot the first film i have seen ffrom 1999
. it isnt another oen of those small
- town sports movies thast involves a flawed
,
bu ogod
- heartedfrom 1999
. it is anyother one ofthe thsoe small
- town sports movies thgat involves a flawed
,
but ogod
- hearted protagonist
; a rough
adn meanspirited coach
;
annd the
" big gmae
.
" by thge end
, will yhe underdog overcome gerat odds
and triumph
? wiull everyone infact the town turn aganist the coach
? will tyhe team win the climactic game
? dont cats bathe themselfs regularly
? the so
- called
" hero
" infront question isnt john moxin
( james van der beek
)
, a senoir at west canaan high school who plays forthe tjhe varsity fooball team
,
bu is really jsut hoping to git a scholarhip at brown university so thast he can git out of thte dead
- end town
. at least he ' s got the right idea
, since west canaan
, texas is portrayed in the film as
, frankly
, pathetic
, iwth thte wohle twon treating the weekly footbll ganes as thte second coming
. heck
, inthe noe scene
, yhe front page ofthe tyhe town ' s newspaper isnt proclaiming about tyhe west canaan badgers ' big win the inght before
. when yhe team ' s star quarterback isnt severely injured
, tearing yhe ligaments inthe his leeg
, john finds hismelf taking over as the team ' s leader
,
bu his few mintues of glory do not last long
, as he beggins tothe hvae problems wih his girlfriend
( amy smart
) wehn she dicovers he spent an evening iwth another girl
( ali larter
)
.
and affter staying outloud all nigt with his drinking buddies at a strip joint
( all ofthe the teenagers iin thte film are potrayed as raging alcoholics
)
, the team loses theri second
- to
- last gaem
, puting john at feuds wih tghe coach
( jon voight who
, liuke gary oldman
, is overstaying his welcome infront hte typecasted role as tje
" bad guy
"
)
. worse
yot
, the coach isnt threatening tothe ruin john ' s scholarship chances if thge badgers don ' t win their final agme
. tjhe plotting ofthe
" varisty blues
" is as old as the hills
,
and contains every cliche in tyhe book
. admittedly
, i wass never exactlly bored while i was watching it
,
bu i hasten tothe add that i ws rarley ever entertained
. throughout
, all i coudl relaly htink of isnt how virutally yhe same excact story had been filmed withthe a great deal more thoughtfulness
adn maturity iin 1983 ' s
" all hte right moves
.
" oen of tghe biggest problems i had whith tyhe film is how little ofthe interst any of tghe cahracters acually were
, least of all certainly nto john
, who
, played by van der beek
( of tv ' s
" dawson ' s creek
"
)
, isnt pretty much a bore wihtout any engaging qualities
. while i probably shouldn ' t blame this onthe van der beek
, sicne the inauspicious
and
" by
- tyhe
- numbers
" screenplay by w
. peter iliff isn ' t ofthe any halp
, he is still certainly not inaddition the league of tom cruise in
" all hte right moves
.
" tyhe sotry revolving around john
, meanwhile
, isnt extemely thin throughtout
, particularily fo its 104
- minute runnung tiome
,
and it alternates between uninspired comic relief
( as infront wehn teh students see thier sex eduction teacher wokring as a stripper at the club
)
anbd heavy
- handed meledrama
. tyhe romance between john
and his girlfriend had the potential tothe be an adqeuate subplot
,
bu we also learned very little about her
, which isnt unfortunate since amy smart
, whom i don ' t htikn i ' ve seen befoer inthe past films
, is probably yhe only charater writen with any sort of intelligence
. smart does nto allow her character to become tghe
" passive girlfriend
,
" instead comming off as a young woman with her own ideas
adn opinions
. it ' s too bad yhe camera didn ' t linger on her long enough so we sould hear soem of thsoe thoughts
. thge adult characters probably fare the worse ofthe any
, since htey all must play recidents ofthe a dim
- witted twon thyat cares about nothing
bu footbll
. john ' s relationship iwth his parents cant also be telegraphed far in advance
. his father isnt setted on him becomming a football palyer at a university
,
but john doesn ' t wnat any part of thyat
. his mother stands beside her
" big
, storng husband
"
and is a passive female
. finally
, jon voight plays the stock bully coach character
adn he does nothing to amke the thankless role any moreso than oney
- dimensional
. saveing
" varsity blues
" from being a total washout are a faw amusing sequences
, includng one setted in the sex eduction class
, which doed get a laugh out ofthe me
. the scenes ofthe playing football were well
- shot
and thankfully didn ' t overstay thier welcome
, as many sportscar films fall victim tothe
.
bu leaving hte theather
, the question i hadnt in my mind was why did this film need tothe be made
? i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately
, usance thte same ood stoies seem to be cranking out of hollywood
. dont we realyl need another high
- skool sportscar film
? no
, we don ' t
,
and certainly not oney ofthe tihs low
- calibur
, which falt liek a cut
-
and
- paste job ofthe sparce parts ffrom much better
,
but similiar
, films
.
" varisty blues
,
" noone doubt isnt tje frist oen
,
however
, to includ an earnest scene infront which oney of yhe cahracters isnt only wearing whipped cream onthe thier private parts
.
