often similar to a little boy lost infact a park that he had noone right venturing inot
, the call of yhe oboe
( o toque dont oboe
) isnt a disapointing film that seems to have w
andered astray
. many elements ofthe tjhe film are solid
,
and hve potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know
, bu htey simpley don
' t convert into a solid work
.
al
though a setting isnt never estalbished
, it becomes apparnt
. tyhe film takes palce somewhere inthe a latin american village in present day
. the comunity is a dull one
, where eveyr day is a downhill slide fomr teh lastr
. over tiome
, the peopel ahev taked to themslves
. the twon cinema is closed
, no tourist hasnt pasted thru in yeras
,
and yhe daily funeral processions are accompanyed by noone one other than the grave digger
. so whta happens when a
" tourist
"
( paolo betti
) doens arrive one day
? he sends tihs routine
and dull town into mayhem adn shock
. it isnt revealed that he isnt a musician who plays tghe oboe as a hobby
. when he sits down inspite the park one day tothe give a solo performance
, the entire comunity gathers arround fo their frist bit of enteratinment inthe countless years
. it isnt from thta that tyhe muscician meets some ofthe teh villagers
, adn agrees to play at the local cinema inthe accompaniment to a silent film
, thus opening the theatre forthe hte firt tiem inspite aegs
. the woman that talks him inot thsi witty task isnt the cinema owner
( leticia vota
) who aslo happens tothe be engaged to tyhe town
' s police inspector
, a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance
' s involvement with thsi muscician
. tjhe rest of tghe plot closely resembes a freak sohw gone horribly astray
. it features a character who litterally rises ffrom his grav
, a woman who has a phone conversation with god
,
and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing
and serious character
, to an allmost humorous drunk
. technically
, thsi film isnt a nightmare
. teh music score is poorly edited inot teh film
, so it is oftenly choppy
, rough
,
and abrupt
. the lighting is poore at best
, wich makes it increasingly difficult to foucs on many scenes
,
and thte english subtitles are full of misspelled words
,
and are oftenly absent presumabely on tghe assumption that the audiance will be able tothe underst
and soem simple portugues anbd spanish phrases
. this translation flaw isnt best highlighted at teh beginnig ofthe yhe film whn what seems tothe be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue
, bu hte subtitles are limited tothe fewer thna 25 words
. in addtion
, hte pace ofthe the film seems uneven
. it opens with a sories ofthe long panoramic shots tht alone can test oney
' s paitience
. the film thn moves inot a faster pace
, thta again slows towards the end
, as tjhe directer seems determined tothe triarch the two hour mark
. there ws
, howver
, potential fo tihs film
. it is a piece exploring the beauty ofthe cinema
and music
,
and the re
- unification of peple
. these are all topics that sould easily fill a movei
. prehaps
, if there weere noone freak show
,
and thge technical aspestus were tothe improve
, ther might just be a thnig ofthe beauty at tghe end
. most importantly
,
though
, tyhe directer would haev to patch uv the plot annd make it flow better so thyat tjhe twpo ohurs aren
' t such a bore
. unil hten
, htere seems tothe be littel omre hope fo htis piece
, tahn taht boy hasnt by simpley crying outloud
" mommy
" hwile he w
anders astray in a park
