movies baout teenagers
and teenage culture rarley proove to be eather intresting
, entertaining or convincing
, because ofthe one fundametal reason
: movies are made by adults
and not teenagers
. occationally
,
howver
, films like sday anything
, dazed
adn confused
and the breakfast club will break thge mold
and offer genuine insight inot thte lives ofthe thsoe bizarre creatures whitch suround us called
" teenagers
.
" cxan ' t hardly wait
,
however
, doesnt nto
. instead
, tje writting
/ directing team of harry elfont
adn deborah kaplan manages tothe tkae eveyr clich
? found iin the teenage genre
, strip it completely of perception
, intellignece
and witn
-
annd turn it inot one of tje most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever beeen subjected tothe
. cxan ' t hardly wait follows a gropu of cahracters as htey attened a house party on thge nigth ofthe theri high skool graduation
. tghe main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no anaylsis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them
: ther ' s hte average male protagonist preston
( ethan embry
)
, prom queen
anbd cheerleader amanda
( jennifer loev
- hewitt
)
, fotoball star mike
( peter facinelli
)
, white rapper wannabe kenny
( seth gren
)
, cmoputer geek william
( charlie korsmo
)
,
adn brainy outsider denise
( lauren ambrose
)
. i couldn ' t stand any ofthe thsoe charachters
. whether it was william getting drunk
annd signing allong to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaming
" yo
, i gotta hvae sex tonight
!
"
, all i coudl think ofthe wass how elfont
and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia picturesk out of ten millon dollars tothe fund their film
. apparently
, cant ' t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy
,
bu it tends tothe fail in htis respect because of tje fact taht it ' s not funny
. in all honesty
, elfont
and kaplan should be forced by thier employers to attent remedial classes inspite humour
.
and wehn i sday
" forced
"
, i mean it
. tehy should be strapped down tothe a chair
and have thier eyes wedged open infront a silimar fashion to alex inspite a clockwork orange
. htis is how desparately tehy ened to be educated baout the consept of humour
. for instatance
, cin ' t hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as
" i am a sex machine
.
" fo smoe reason
, elfont
and kaplan beieve tyhat if this carachter repeats it enought
, eventualy it iwll be funny
. if only elfont
and kaplan coudl recognise teh irony that tehy accually got payed for making tihs junk
- nowe that ' s funny
.
