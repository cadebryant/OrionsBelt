movies baout teenagers
and teenage culture rarely proove tothe be either interesting
, intertaining or convincing
, baceause ofthe oney fundamental reason
: movies are made by adults annd nto teenagers
. occasionally
,
however
, films liuke say anytying
, dazed
and confused adn tje breakfast club will break the mold anbd offer genuin insight into teh lives ofthe thsoe bizarre creatures whcih suround us called
" teenagers
.
" can
' t hardly wait
,
however
, does nto
. instade
, the wirting
/ directing team of harry elfont annd deborah kaplan manages to take every clich
? found iin the teenage genre
, strip it completely of preception
, intelligenec
and witn
-
and turn it inot one ofthe the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to
. can
' t hardly wait follows a gropu ofthe charactors as they attend a hous party on tjhe night of their high school graduation
. the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provded to perfectly underst
and them
: ther
' s teh average male rpotagonist preston
( ethan embry
)
, prom queen
and cheerleader am
anda
( jennifer love
- hewitt
)
, footall star mike
( peter facinelli
)
, white rapper wannabe kenny
( seth gren
)
, cmoputer geek william
( charlie korsmo
)
,
and brainy outsider denise
( lauren ambrose
)
. i couldn
' t st
and any ofthe those characters
. whther it ws william getting drunk
and signing allong tothe heavy metal songs or kenny proclaming
" yo
, i gotta have sex tonight
!
"
, all i coudl thiunk of was how elfont anbd kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten millon dollars to fund their film
. apparantly
, can
' t hardly wait isnt supposed to be a comedy
, bu it tends tothe fail in htis respect becuase ofthe the fact that it
' s nto funny
. infront all honesty
, elfont annd kaplan should be forced by their employers to attent remedial classes in humour
. annd when i say
" forced
"
, i mean it
. tehy shouldnt be strapped down to a chair
and ahev theri eyes wedged open in a simular fashion to alex in a clockwork orange
. htis is how desparately they ened tothe be educated baout tyhe consept of humour
. for instance
, cant
' t hardly wait features a foreign excange student who isnt instructed tothe repeat absurd statements such as
" i am a sex machine
.
" fo some reason
, elfont
and kaplan belive that if this charactor repeats it enought
, evenhtually it wiull be funny
. if only elfont
and kaplan sould recognise the irony taht htey acutally got paid for making tihs junk
- now that
' s funny
.
