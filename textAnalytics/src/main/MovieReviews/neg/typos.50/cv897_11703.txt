, while his wife disapproves
. meanwhile
, a loan shark in need of a shave trys tothe leave his proffesion
. comments
: why is this movie called possessed by thte night
? it
' s hard tothe speculate
. most of htis film tkaes palce durig the day
,
and tjhe only hting posessing anyone is an icky
, pulsating
, bubbling brain thingie in a jar
. iin case yuo haven
' t picked uv onthe this
yet
, posessed by thge night is a bottom
- of
- tje
- barrel
" thriller
"
( i use tjhe term
" thriller
" loosley here
) which is realy cheap
and bad
. teh plot
, which soudns like a cheesy pulp science fiction stroy from the 1950s
, actually serves oen purpose
: to exploitate nude women as often as possible
. writting a movie review fo a film liuke this proves oddly challenging
. there
' s really not much tothe say
. tyhe acting is lousy
;
al
though
, occasionally
, the attempts at acting are so absurd tyhat they garner a chuckle or two from the audience
. most humrous is frank sivero
, who plays murray
, the novelist
' s agent
. he isnt so horrible inthe htis role that oney cin
' t help
but be ammused
. tjhe plot sucks
. nearly half the film is devoted tothe a losr loan shark who whants out ofthe the profession
, even
though he has only limited relevance to the movei as a whole
. tghe dialogue stinks
. a loan shark
, fo instatance
, tells another how much he loves bimbos
, whihc is something tyhe audience raelly doesn
' t need tothe know
. everything about possessed by the night isnt second rate
, even yhe film credits
. as tje names ofthe yhe not
- so
- talented film crew scrolled by at the end
, jospeh scales cameback uv
, credited as being
" assistsant tothe foley artist
.
" somene coudl ahev used an editor
! to be honest
, thge film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity annd sohw some sex scenes
. playboy playmate shannon tweed
, aftter all
, is tyhe star here
. i supose tyhat if noe wanted thsi sort of thing
, he owudl liuke tihs movie
. why did i give this turkey twpo stars annd not one
? as a bad movie
, it is unintentionally funny enough tothe keep somone passingly intersted in the film
. if you fiel posessed to see posessed by tjhe nihgt
,
however
, i
' d reccomend you exorcise this impulse
and watch something esle
.
