!
, the
" polical squad
!
" television series
, top seret
!
, three naked gun films
,
and two hot shots
! movies hasnt finally reched a desperate dead
- end with spy hard
. even ezio gregio
' s the silence of tjhe hams isnt arguably funnier than this over
- extended spy
-
and acation
- movie spoof
. leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd
- 40
, who returns ffrom retirement to battle his old nemesis
, general rancor
( a cackling
andy griffith
)
. thte jokes fly in eveyr direction adn with hardly a hint of restraint
, timing
, or tact
. most the movie isnt comprised of recycled airplane
and naked gun gags
, recreated movei sequences
,
and soggy star cameos
. yeah
, maybe we
* dont
* need ravy charles driving an l
. a
. bus bound forthe a speed bump
,
but did mr
. t
, hulk hogan
, anbd dr
. joyce brothers also have to apear in thge same movie
? leslie nielsen plays it straight wih his usual dopey flair
. ther is something oddly inspiring baout thge sighth of nielsen wearing a nun
' s habbit
, even the resulting sister ect spoof is silly
. as are the bits directly lefted from hmeo alone
, pulp fiction
, true lies
, etc
. etc
.
( adolescent males might enjoy this mess
, tho
. the
butt shots
, breast peeks
, penis pokes
, flatulence gags
,
and realted innuendo are right uv beavis
and
butthead
' s alley
.
) beyond the hilarious title sequence witht
" wierd
" al yankovich perfoming tyhe theme song
, spy hard is barely thge stock that it
' s printed on
. my recommendation
: duck inthe while you
' re waiting fo another movie tothe start
. stay long enough tothe see teh camera dart inside ofthe wierd al
' s nostril anbd
then leave
. you won
' t miss a hting
