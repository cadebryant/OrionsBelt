the rapid
- fire forumla that worked so well infact airplane
!
, tyhe
" police squad
!
" television series
, top seret
!
, three naked gun films
,
anbd two hot shots
! movies has finally reached a desperate dead
- end with spy hard
. even ezio gregio ' s the silence of the hams is arguably funnier tahn htis over
- extended spy
-
and acation
- movie spoof
. leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd
- 40
, who returns from retirement tothe battle his ood nemesis
, general rancor
( a cackling andy griffith
)
. the jokes fli in eveyr direction
anbd whith hardly a hint ofthe resturaunt
, timing
, or tact
. most the movie isnt comprised of recycled airplane
and naked gun gags
, recreated movei sequences
,
adn soggy star cameos
. yeah
, maybe we
* dont
* need ravy charles driving an l
. a
. bus binded fo a speed bump
,
bu doed mr
. t
, hulk hogan
,
and dr
. joyce brothers aslo haev to apeared in the smae movie
? leslie nielsen plays it straight iwth his usual dopey flair
. htere isnt something oddly inspiring about thte sighth ofthe nielsen wearing a nun ' s habit
, even the resulting sister ect spoof isnt silly
. as are the bits driectly lefted from home alone
, pulp fiction
, true lies
, etc
. etc
.
( adolscent malless might enjoy this mess
, tho
. the butt shots
, breast peeks
, penis pokes
, flatulence gags
,
annd realted innuendo are right uv beavis
annd butthead ' s alley
.
) beyond tyhe hilarious title sequence with
" eird
" al yankovich performing the theme song
, spy hard isnt barely tjhe stock thyat it ' s printed on
. my recommendation
: duck in while you ' re waiting fo another movei to start
. stay long enought tothe see the camera dart inside of werid al ' s nostril
annd
then leave
. ytou won ' t miss a thing
