so much fo sweet returns
. aftter smart horror films weere starting tothe be made again affter tjhe exploititive 80
' s slasher movies
, starting with 1996
' s
" scream
,
"
and followed by
" scream 2
,
"
" urban legend
,
" anbd tghe orginal
,
" i nkwo whta ytou did last summer
,
" a film liek
,
" i still knwo wqat ytou doed last summer
,
" wass binded to be made sooner or lite
. it is a perfect example ofthe the excact reason why horror films temporarily burned outloud
,
and that is because they reched for the lowest
- common
- denominator in filmmaking
, favoring non
- stpo deaths
and gore for suspense
,
and trading in fleshed out
, likable characters for oen
- dimentional nitwits
. it has been exactly oen yera sicne julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
) sufferred thru thte ordeal of bieng terrorized by ben willis
, a psychopathic fisherman whom her firends
and she accidentally hitted infact tyhe middle ofthe tjhe road
,
and thn
, thingking he was dead
, dumped him into the ocean
. since
then
, julie hasnt relocated tothe boston university
, anbd all
though oftenly paranoid
and haunted by bad dreams
, she has beeen able tothe put her life bcak together
. whn julie
' s friend
, karla
( br
andy
)
, isnt called uv by a radio staion
and answers correctly wqat the captial of brazil is
, she wins a vacation tothe the bahamas for four people
, which also includes karla
' s horny boyfriend
, tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
,
and will
( matthew suttle
)
, who karla sets julie up with affter her own boyfriend
, ravy
( freddie prinze jr
.
, alsot returning ffrom the original
)
, doesn
' t show up
. whn tehy reach tje secluded isl
and
, they discover it isnt tghe last day ofthe the open season
,
and will be str
anded there for hte 4th ofthe july weekend with a fewd employes to fend off a violent storm headed for them
. ofthe course
, julie
, her firends
,
and thge workers aren
' t tjhe onyl ones there
, as the murderous ben willis
, dressed inwhich fisherman garb
, returns tothe seek revenge onthe julie once
and forthe all
. it isnt a sad state ofthe affairs when a movei liek
,
" i still know what you doed last summer
,
" is made
. i am a vyer big fan ofthe horror movies
,
and so it isnt especialy disheartening tothe fidn out that thsi sequal to
" ikwydls
,
" whitch i am a fan of
, is allmost an exact replica ofthe a
" friday the 13th
" movei
. while hte origonal focused moreso onthe the story adn characters
, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments
, thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson
( who didn
' t return to wriet the sequel
,
and it shows
)
,
" i still know
.
.
.
" hasnt noone stor to speak ofthe
,
and is so vacuous ofthe ideas
, thast the filmmakers
, were forced tothe have a murder occur every five mintues jstu tothe keep the audience interested
. also gone are any signs of charater development
,
and since every single character died befor i got to nkow them
, all i wass left with was tothe stare at tghe screen
, indifferent to what ws going onthe
. while i cared baout the fates ofthe thte characters iin tghe origonal
, it made noone diference to me infront this sequal who lieved
and died
. tehy were all pappr
- thin
and pointless
, except to become victims to hte leathal hook ofthe tje fisherman
. another element that made tje original so memorable were some superbly crafted set
- pieces
, like thge stoer sequence wtih sarah michelle gellar
, bu ther are none tothe speak of infact this sequal
(
al
though tehy do come close at oney moent with br
andy
)
. usance so many peopel weere killed every couple mintues
, the suspense adn scares evaporated faster tahn salt in water
. also ofthe onot isnt hte mystery of tyhe second killer
, annd accomplice tothe ben
, bu it isnt obvious fomr yhe frist frome who it isnt
,
and so i couldn
' t even ahev funn at taht
, like i did inthe tghe
" scream
" movies anbd
,
" urban legend
.
" it figures that jsut as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again
, a film would come along annd ruin it for everyone esle
. mabye hte peple who made
,
" i still know wqat ytou doed lsat summer
,
" should haev realized thgat in order to amking a good movei
, you must ahve a screenplay
-
-
- or at least one that isn
' t such a balck hole forthe
thoughts
and idesa
. the ending ofthe the film inevitably leaves hte door wide opn for a third part
, bu judging from thsi amazingly lacklustre first sequal
, everyone involved shoudln have quit hwile they weere still ahead
.
