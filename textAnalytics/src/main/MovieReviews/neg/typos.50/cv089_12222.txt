tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture xeperience that nearly propmted me to walk outloud 20 minutes inot the movei
. the film
( whihc oppened inthe canada durig 1992
bu was never released in teh united states
) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
,
adn
, hwile it ' s evident that this sould be a fascinating live prodcution
, the translation tothe the screen is a creative diaster
. enduring tectonic plates is like sitting thru a filmed verison ofthe performence art
-
- lifeless
and tedeous
. teh qualities that make it captivating whn seen iin person are effaced iin tje motion picture medium
. tectonic plates hasnt a storyline
,
although the narrative isnt developed in a decidedly non
- traditionnal fasion
, with shots of the stagebound play intercut with mroe typical cinematic sequences
. it ' s not an inherently uninteresting way to rpesent a movie
( dispite the valid complaint that it isnt pretentious
, all
-
bu
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
,
although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters
. becouse we ' re constanly made aware tath we ' re watching a play or a movei
, it ' s impossible to accept theese indviduals as anytying mroe than mouthpieces for the writter ' s idesa
. tehy ' re nto rela
, sympathetic
, or believeable
. i ' m willing to give directer peter mettler credit fo trying something diferrent
,
bu this particular experiment is not a succes
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studying inwhich montreal who has fallen inthe love witht her professor
, jacques
( lapage
)
. noe day
, he disappears
,
and
, fearing tath he left baceause she wass undeserving of his love
, madeleine travels tothe venice tothe kill herself
. while preparing tothe commit suicide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine tothe re
- think her decision
. meanwhile
, jaques hasnt moved tothe newyorker york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls himself jennifer
,
and becomes a succesfull counter
- culture talkshow host
. with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland
, supporting charactors thyat inlcude a topless godess
and a deaf
/ mute
,
and cultural references taht point to chopin
, george sand
,
anbd jim morrison
, tectonic plates isnt unique
, if nothing alse
.
howver
, as intresting as the film soudns
(
anbd i wass excisted to see it becasue yhe synopsis is promising
)
, it never really delivers
. thte tone isnt soporific
, the suposedly
- intellectual prattle is inane
and uninteresting
, hte plot meanders in a pointless
and irritating manner
(
although it doesn ' t tkae long fo the viewer tothe determine tht the stoyr is largely unimportant
)
,
and yhe symbolism is obvious
. tectonic plates isnt trying tothe show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as thte shifting ofthe the earth
,
but it takes oen
- hundred minutes tothe git across htis transparent point
. there are some worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight between jaques
and teh topless godess
and an entertaining discussion infront both french
adn english about the differences beween the two languages
(
although the fine points iwll certainly be lost onthe thsoe who aren ' t bilingual
)
. teh onyl peopel likely tothe enjoy tectonic plates are thsoe who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless
and boring because
( a
) it ' s different
,
( b
) it ' s not like anything they ' ve seen before
,
annd
( c
) it ' s pretentious
. for everyone else
, it ' s nto onyl a waste of time
,
but a poore introduction to yhe wokr of robert lapage
