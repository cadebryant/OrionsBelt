tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly propmted me tothe walk out 20 minutes into the movie
. thte film
( wich oppened in canada during 1992
but was never released infront the untied states
) isnt based onthe a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
, anbd
, while it
' s evident that thsi could be a fascinating live prodcution
, the translation to tyhe screen isnt a creative disaster
. enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version ofthe peformance art
-
- lifeless anbd tedious
. the qualities that make it captivating when seen inaddition person are effaced in the motion picture medium
. tectonic plates hasnt a storyline
,
al
though the narrative is devolopped inspite a decidedly non
- traditionnal fashon
, with shots of tghe stagebound play intercut wiht mroe typical cinematic sequences
. it
' s nto an inherantly uninteresting way to prsent a movie
( despite the valid complaint thgat it is pretentious
, all
-
but
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
,
al
though it keesh the audience distanced ffrom the characters
. baceause we
' re constanly made aware thta we
' re watching a play or a movie
, it
' s impossible to accept theese indviduals as anything more tahn mouthpieces fo yhe writer
' s idesa
. they
' re not rela
, sympathetic
, or believeable
. i
' m willing to give directer peter mettler credit for trying something different
,
but this paticular experiment is nto a succsess
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us tothe madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studying iin montreal who hasnt fallen in lvoe with her professor
, jacques
( lapage
)
. noe day
, he dissapears
,
and
, fearing thyat he left because she wass undeserving ofthe his love
, madeleine travels tothe venice to kill herself
. while preparing tothe commit sucide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine to re
- htikn her decision
. meanwhile
, jaques has moved to newyorker york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls himselv jennifer
, adn becomes a sucessfull counter
- culture talkshow host
. wtih settings that shift ffrom paris tothe venice tothe montreal to manhattan tothe scotl
and
, supporting cahracters tath inlcude a topless goddess adn a deaf
/ mute
, anbd cultural references tath point tothe chopin
, george s
and
, adn jim morrison
, tectonic plates isnt unique
, if nothing esle
.
however
, as interesting as the film sounds
( annd i was excisted tothe see it baceause the synopsis isnt promising
)
, it never relaly delivers
. the tone isnt soporific
, tghe supposably
- intelectual prattle is inane adn uninteresting
, thge plot me
anders infront a pointless adn irritating manner
( altough it doesn
' t take long fo the viewer tothe determine tyhat the stoyr is largely unimportant
)
,
and the symbolism isnt obvious
. tectonic plates is trying tothe sohw thgat human interaction isnt as volatile as unpredictable as tghe shifting of the earth
,
but it takes one
- hundered mintues tothe git accros thsi transparent point
. htere are smoe worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight between jaques adn the topless goddess annd an entertaining discussion in both french anbd english about the differences betwen tje two laguages
( altough tghe fine points will certainly be lost onthe those who aren
' t bilingual
)
. the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are thsoe who feel a storng ened tothe praise something this rootless annd boring becasue
( a
) it
' s differnt
,
( b
) it
' s not liek anything they
' ve seen befoer
, adn
( c
) it
' s pretentious
. for everyone alse
, it
' s nto only a waste ofthe time
, bu a poor introduction tothe the work ofthe robert lapage
