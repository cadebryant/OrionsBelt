the only twpo really good things that i cin say baout tarzan anbd thte lost city are as follows
: jane march was vrey cute as jane
,
and teh movei was thankfully under 90 minutes in lenght
. if you haven
' t already figured it out
, i didn
' t like thsi movei very much
. the plot ws boring annd contrived to tje extreme
. tarzan
( casper van dien
) has now left the jungle adn living in civilized society
. he isnt jstu days awya from his impending marraige tothe jane
, plyed by the aptly named jane march
. back inthe his former hmeo ofthe africa
, a gropu of looters has foudn hte key tothe locating a lost city
.
( mind ytou i never raelly figured out why they actualy wanted tothe find this city
.
) anyway
, tarzan
' s old jungle firend appears to him in a vision
. tarzan realizes that he must return tothe africa to help stop the bad guys fomr finding the lost city
. he leaves jane
( his first mistake
, inaddition my opinion
)
and travels tothe africa
. ofthe course
, jane is hot onthe her ape man
' s heals
. tje twpo of them are reunited iin africa where htey do battle iwth the bad guys
. sound liek a dumb explination ofthe the plot
? it
' s actaully an improvment over the real thing
. tje acting isnt just plain awful
. i
' m nto quite sure wqat casper van dien wass donig inaddition tihs film
,
but it wasn
' t acting
. jane march wasn
' t a heck of a lot better
,
but at least she is easy onthe the eyes
. compounding the bad acting was the fatc that infact many places the dialogue had obviously beeen re
- recorded
,
and i
' ve seen better dubbing in soem old bruce lee movies
. added tothe the sound problems wass tje cinematography
. htis film wass filled with beautyfull african scenery
.
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me
. qtuie frankly
, i tihkn yuo coudl probably dont a better job capturing teh beauty of africa iwth a camcorder tahn this bunch did with professional film equipmetn
.
then we have the special effects
.
" special effects in a tarzan movie
?
" you are noone doubt asking yourself
? yes firends
, the writers injected soem very out of place supernatural elements into the stoyr
. probably for the sake of useing cgi
, sicne it did nothing
but hurt tjhe story
. inwhich most parts
, they weren
' t bad
, just nothing special
.
but
, tehy were more than a little onthe the hokey side
. exept of course
, wehn we got tothe the ridiculous climax ofthe thsi movei
. the gr
and finale
' s special effects went right inot the toilet at thyat point
. it alomst looked like tehy had run out ofthe monye
. these effects were ofthe noticably lower qualty than those inthe thge rest ofthe the film annd looked liuke something inaddition an aateur video production
. i took one lesson awya ffrom watching tarzan
and yhe lost city
-
- ape men
and bones that morph inot skeletal warriors don
' t mix
. stay far away ffrom htis version ofthe tarzan
.
