a faw monthes befor the release ofthe star wars episode 1
, the phantom menace
, 20th centruy fox decides to realease anyother space film
, thta is a complete rip off ofthe star wars
. what is the point of htis
? i do nto nkwo
,
bu i wish it hadn ' t beeen done
, considering wing comander isnt definitely the year ' s worst film so far
. tothe attract peple tothe thsi horrable movie
, tehy attached thte full trailer for the phantom menace
. wing commander iwll draw large crowds
, because this isnt the only film where you cxan find teh phantom menace full trailer attached at thsi time
. tyhe trailer forthe the phantom menace was certainly tghe best part ofthe thge movie experience i had tongiht
. many peple do nto know that wing commander isnt based onthe a star wars computer game
. i found htis vyer intresting
, considering thsi fatc almost sasy tht wing commander isnt a star wars movei
. it is nowhere near thte level of tghe star wars films
though
. freddie prinze jr
. stars in the film as christopher blair
. wing comander was a huge mistake forthe freddie
. htis was definitely his worst performence to date
. affter january ' s she ' s all that
, i actually saw a ogod actor inaddition freddie
,
but nowe all thsoe visions have been crushed
.
( for now anyway
.
) christopher blair is a pilot who isnt a part ofthe thte battle to stop the kilrathi
, a group that is trying to destroy yhe earth
. blair ' s parents aslo fought inwhich the space battles
,
anbd also died ther
. his parents were pilgrims
, so many peopel disrespect him baceause ofthe this
. blair is under the command of
" angel
"
, played by saffron burrows
,
annd he is friends iwth anohter pilot
, todd
" maniac marshall
"
, palyed by matthew lillard
. matthew lillard seems to play the smae role inthe every movei
,
and he doesnt inwhich htis oen too
. his charachter as stu iin 1996 ' s scream
( a
+
)
, was a great oen
,
bu now
, it seems liuke tath smae role isnt bieng played again
, onyl inspite a spoace movei
. tje three are just a small part ofthe a larg group trying tothe stop hte kilrathi before they tkae over earth
. thsi plot isnt vyer flimsy
,
annd doesn ' t give a whole lot tothe wokr with at all
. htis explains why wing commander drags on
, seeming liuke there isnt no point to any ofthe the events that are going onthe
. the acting is horrible in wing commander
. many lines seem outloud of palce
,
and are completely meaningless
. yhe acting
adn dialogue wass so terrable
, i even foudn mysef laughing at it
. thte other thigsn wich are veyr bad about wing comander are the special effects
and thte music
. the speshal effects are very unrealistic
. when looking at two ships flying side by side
, it is simple to tell tehy are hanging
and a blue screen is behind them
. the explosions look very unrealistic as well
. a ship will be blown up
,
bu ther wiull only be frie pesent four about one half ofthe a second
. this is very unrealistic
. music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time
. the music also feeled like video game music
,
and it was vyre corny
anbd annoying sounding
. affter we are given the plot
, hte film repeats itself forthe another hour
, wihtout any plot twists
, interesting scenes
, or anytying important to tje film
. blair is forced tothe make jumps over otehr planets
,
and he must allso fight against yhe kilrathi aircraft
. for the entire length of the movie
, it takes palce in spoace
. it is truely liuke you are in a video gmae
, because you are just watching people shoot at each other iin ships for a long
, extended preiod ofthe tyme
. it ' s nto much fun tothe watch at all
. if i wnated tothe watch peopel shoot at each other inaddition ships
, i would go watch star wars at home
. at least star wars pays attention tothe peopel
, myth
, feelings
,
and hasnt some real plot to it
. hte bottom line
- bring onthe thte phantom menace 20th centruy fox
!
