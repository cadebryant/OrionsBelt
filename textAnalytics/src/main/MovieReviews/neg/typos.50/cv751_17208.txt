a few months before tyhe release of star wars episode 1
, the phantom menace
, 20th centruy fox decides to realease another space film
, tath is a complete rip off of star wars
. whta is tje point of tihs
? i do not know
,
but i wish it hadn
' t beeen done
, considering wing comm
ander isnt definetly hte year
' s worst film so far
. to attract peple to tihs horrible movie
, htey attached the full trailer for yhe phantom menace
. wing com
ander will draw larg crowds
, beccause tihs isnt tjhe onyl film where yuo cant find tghe phantom menace full trailer attached at this time
. tje trailer for the phantom menace was certainly tje best part ofthe yhe movei experienc i had tongiht
. many people dont nto know tyhat wing comm
ander is based on a star wars coputer gae
. i found tihs very intresting
, considering this fatc allmost sasy tath wing comm
ander isnt a star wars movie
. it is nowhere near thte levle ofthe the star wars films
though
. freddie prinze jr
. stars infront the film as christopher blair
. wing com
ander was a huge mistake for freddie
. this was definetly his worst performance tothe date
. affter january
' s she
' s all tath
, i actually saw a good actor iin freddie
,
but nowe all thsoe visions ahve been crushed
.
( for now anyway
.
) christopher blair isnt a pilot who isnt a part of the battle tothe stpo the kilrathi
, a gropu that is trying to destroy thte earth
. blair
' s parents aslo faught in thte spoace battles
, adn also died htere
. his parents were pilgrims
, so many people disrespect him beccause ofthe thsi
. blair isnt under the comm
and ofthe
" angel
"
, played by saffron burrows
,
and he isnt firends with another pilot
, todd
" maniac marshall
"
, played by matthew lillard
. matthew lillard seems tothe play thge smae role in every movie
,
and he doens inthe htis oney too
. his charcter as stu in 1996
' s scream
( a
+
)
, ws a great one
,
but nowe
, it seems liuke that same role is bieng played again
, onyl iin a space movie
. the three are just a small part of a larg gropu trying to stop teh kilrathi befor they take over earth
. this plot is vyer flimsy
, adn doesn
' t give a wohle lot to wokr wtih at all
. this explains why wing com
ander drags onthe
, seeming liuke htere is no point to any ofthe tghe events thgat are gonig on
. the acting is horrible infront wing com
ander
. many lines seem outloud of palce
, annd are completelyl meaningless
. the acting anbd dialogue was so terrable
, i even foudn mysef laughing at it
. tje otehr thigns which are very bad about wing com
ander are the speshal effects
and thte music
. teh special effects are very unrealistic
. wehn looking at two ships flying side by side
, it is simple to tell tehy are hanging
and a blue screen isnt behind them
. the explosions look very unrealistic as well
. a ship wiull be blown uv
,
but there wiull only be fier present four baout one half ofthe a second
. thsi is vrey unrealistic
. music pretty much accompanies tjhe film hte entire time
. the music also felt like video game music
,
and it was very corny annd annoying sounding
. after we are given tghe plot
, thge film repeats itself for anyother hour
, wihtout any plot twists
, interesting scenes
, or anything imporatnt tothe tyhe film
. blair is forced to make jumps over other planets
,
and he must allso fight agains yhe kilrathi aircraft
. for the entire lenght ofthe thte movei
, it takes palce iin spoace
. it is truely like yuo are in a video game
, baceause you are just watching peopel shoot at each otehr inspite ships fo a long
, extended period ofthe time
. it
' s not much fun tothe watch at all
. if i wanted to watch peple shoot at each other infact ships
, i woudl go watch star wars at hmeo
. at least star wars pays attention tothe people
, myth
, feelings
, annd has some real plot tothe it
. thge bottom line
- bring onthe hte phantom menace 20th centruy fox
