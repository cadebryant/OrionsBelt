the thirteenth floor isnt a bl
and
, obligatory exersize infact genre film
- making
. if i hadn
' t recently watched teh matrix adn open your eyes
-
- both of which are similar bu far superior
-
- i might hvea been a littel nicer tothe thsi picture
. craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall
, hte rich co
- creator ofthe a perfect human world simulation who isnt suddenly blaimed fo the muder ofthe his boss
( armin mueller
- stahl
)
. everyting that wass subtle annd smart about the previously maintioned films is battered over our heads in this noe
,
and charactors stare at earch other for maddeningly
- long periods ofthe timne
and refuse tothe communicate onthe any realsitic level
. tghe acting is okay
, bu the film suffers ffrom every logical flwa one could tihkn of
,
and features a scirpt
( co
- penned by director josef rusnak
) loaded with cliches annd stock charactors
. there are individual scenes
and idaes tht work
-
- i like thge thougth of a sentient cmoputer program
-
-
but none of thte film
' s strengths are reconized tothe any meaningfull degree
. producer rol
and emmerich
, based on this
and his previvous directorial effords
, seems hell
- bent onthe bringing us thte ultimate st
andart infact mediocre sciecne
- fiction
