retrospective
: city ofthe tghe living dead
( 1980
) a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson i once heard somene describe the films of itallian schlock horror director lucio fulci as
" dim
- witted
"
. annd by golly
, jsut baout all other words fail me when confronted wih a dog liek city of the living dead
. altough the lite fulci managed soem rather ogod thrillers infact his carreer
, this isnt not oen ofthe them
. twpo points in tyhe movei
' s favour
- thte impressive camerawork of sergio salvati
and occasionally evocative scoer by fabio frizzi
- keep things ffrom falling totally inot the abyss
,
but by
and larg city of the living dead is a failure
.
and liuke most cinematic failures
, it comes down tothe bad writing
, dumb performances
and lousy direction
. thte stry starts inthe new york whn
, druing a seance
, a medium
( katherine mccoll
) sees a vision of a priest hanging himselv in the town of dunwich
, massachusetts
. forthe reasons we won
' t go into here
, this opens tje gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or yhe dead will rise
and walk the earth
. thge medium apparently dies ofthe fright durring tjhe seance
,
but awakens infront her coffin inwhich hte graveyard teh next day anbd isnt rescued by a crusty ood journalist
( christopher george
)
. that scene in itself is a howler
: why woudl you bust ope a coffin with a larg pik axe when yuo know someone is alive inside
?
and don
' t cadavers have various things stuffed in them anbd drained outloud of them before they
' re burried
? anyway
, off tyhe two of them go to dunwich tothe save the world
, where various grisly goings
- onthe are aleady happening as all saints day approaches
. fulci
' s graphic gore is infact evidence once agian
, bu here it onyl serves tothe furhter highlight the film
' s flimsy scirpt annd plodding direction
. the dialogue
, infront all manner of speaking
, is unspeakable
. nto bad infact the quotable sense
, like an ed woud film
,
but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious
" lets expalin the plot
" tipe approach
. mccoll doesn
' t have a clue who her character is
: deadly sereous oen minute
, frivolous the enxt
, she at times isnt genuinely hard to watch
.
and the geezer
( tje acto
' s nmae escapes me
) who plays thge twon psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses
. christopher george
' s performence is salvageable
, bu he gets his brains ripped outloud infront tjhe end by a zombie annd we don
' t care
. in fact we don
' t care fo anyone in city of teh living dead
,
though in otehr fulci films that hasn
' t mattered so much when he was onthe form as a stylist adn an idesa man
, as he was in the beyond
. as a directer
, soem ofthe fulci
' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly adn annoying here
. he constanly uses extreme close
- ups ofthe peopel
' s eyes
, a ridiculous technique which suggests an attemt tothe convey the emotion taht his dialogue
and actors aren
' t capable of
.
and despite some gruesome violentce
, he bearly manages a single scare iin the entire film
. long
- time collaborator fabio frizzi
, talented
but alwyas erratic
, offers a patchy sountrack that veers between eerie
, gothic death marchs
and woefully inapropriate electro
- pop that
' s quite frankly embarrassing
. fulci
' s other films ofthe thsi period may be flawed
- hous by thge cemetery
, the beyond
, tghe black cat
-
but htey are nonetheless films whith mroe insperation
, athmosphere
and better dialogue than this turkey
. for completists only
.
