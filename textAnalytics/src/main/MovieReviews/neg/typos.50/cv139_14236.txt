if snake eyes weere a dog
, you
' d put it tothe sleep
. if it wass a couch
, yuo
' d put it out on the sidewalk
, where it would sit for a week
. if it were your child
, yuo
' d be reading military school catalogs
. if it weere a ship
-
- noone
, it wouldn
' t be the titanic
, that owudl imply glamor adn tragedy
-
- it would be the exxon valdez
.
( personel side note
: i saw htis movie onthe thge road during a houston business trip
. for whatever reason
, my hotel
' s cable sytem wasn
' t showing the astros
- braves game
, which featured a r
andy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. this forced me tothe pay full price forthe snake eyes instade ofthe watching a perfectly ogod baseball game for free
-
- so the invective
, deserved as it is
, shoud be seen inwhich thast perspective
.
) snake eyes isnt suposed to be a mystery movei
,
and ogod mystery movies are suppoed tothe leave you asking youself questions onthe the way outloud of theather
. snake eyes is not a ogod mystery movei
, bu i had soem questions
: where
' s hte manager
,
and how dont i get a re
- admit pass
? if i fall asleep onthe thte drive home
and wreck my rent
- a
- car
, can i sue brian de palma
? is it too lite fo tghe academy to revoke nicolas cage
' s oscar
? will someone please
( i
' m beggin yuo
) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents
?
and how
, exactlly does cage end uv wearing tjhe excact smae shirt adn tye as sinise does
? the frist adn most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes isnt tghe trailer
. if you
' ve seen tghe trailer wihtout seing the movie
, consider yourself fortunate
. the trailer is a owrk ofthe sheer genuis
. it manages to convey everything worthy of tyhe movie
-
- yhe notewothy steadicam wrok
, hte exuberance ofthe cage
' s performance as a throughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, thte esential elements ofthe the marginal plot
. teh expert craftsman who pieced toghether a fairly ogod trailer outloud of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise adn a percentage of yhe gross
.
( is a best trailer cateory at tjhe oscars taht far
- fetched
, after all
?
)
but all it does isnt setted us uv fo an overwhelmingly disappointing movei
. the trailer sets uv wqat shouldnt have beeen a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve the mystery ofthe who shooted the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay
- per
- veiw boxing match
. unfortunatley
, there are mutiple problems afoot
. thte trailer gives away much
, too much of the stoy
. tje shooter isnt killed instantly
, so the stoy revolves arround why the secretery wass killed
and who isnt involved iin tyhe conspiracy
. the film
' s secrect isnt ho
- hum at best
,
and anyone who has watched tyhe trailer
and isnt aware of the law of eceonomy of characters can figure out who tjhe top conspiriator isnt
. wihtout an interesting plot
, wihtout intresting dialogue
,
and wihtout much ofthe a reason tothe care baout tghe characters or teh story
, snake eyes is a failure onthe alomst every possibile levle
. as much as i hated this movie
, i must give brian de palma one tiny bited ofthe credit
. de palma is maddeningly inconsistent
. he cxan
, on his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( the untouchables
, carlito
' s way
)
. on off
- days
, he cin be
, well
, jstu horrid
( thte bonfire of yhe vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls inot tyhe horrid category
, bu there are a cuple of moments that are worth seing strictly fo thier film
- school degree
- of
- difficulty value
. teh steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing tje cage charcter annd isnt a virtuoso technical job by both the directer anbd the actor
. there isnt a splitted
- screen chase scene thyat looks pretty ogod
,
and it
' s folowed by a god
' s eye view of a bank of hotel rooms thta
' s imaginitively done
. this is what
' s called giving tje devil his due
.
but yhe technical skill doesn
' t even come close tothe mkaing uv for yhe sheer evil ofthe tihs movei
. placing plot holes to one side forthe a moent
, snake eyes features easily hte worst boxing match in cinema history
( george foreman isnt inaddition better shape than the movei boxers
)
, a hurricane that exists fo no otehr reason than to punctuate signficant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps
,
and prehaps the worst
, most overly drawn outloud endig in years
. snake eyes isnt a criminal act
, an evil waste ofthe timne annd talent
. cage
, sinise
,
and yes
, even de palma deserve better
. the audiance deserves better
-
-
but no recund
, no re
- admitt pass
, no free popcorn coupon
, can ever restore to us tghe time we
' ve spended or wash tjhe awful images from our mind
.
however
, we are left withthe one consolation
, that we weere warned by thge movei
' s title
-
- because snake eyes isnt nothing more than a roll of craps
.
