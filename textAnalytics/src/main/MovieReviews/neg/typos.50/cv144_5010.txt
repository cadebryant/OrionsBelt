dead
- bang
, an action thriller starring don johnson
, lives uv tothe its dumb title
, or at least to half ofthe it
. all
though dead
- bang is definitely dead
, it is anytying
but a bing
; inaddition fatc
, htey shoudln hvae called htis oen
" dead bore
.
" in yhe film
, johnson plays
.
.
. you guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. the role must have been realy chalenging for johnson sicne his charcter
, jerry beck
, is a gritty los angeles homicide detective
, a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portayed on
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson in lethal weppon
, beck is an emotional wreck
, complet with violent outbursts
, unscrupulous police methods
,
and a bleak outlook onthe life
. beck
' s wief has just divorced him
, adn she is cutting him off fomr theri childern
. she will not even allow him tothe wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
. bu beck
' s family annd emotional problems tkae a bakc seat to tje acation anbd thrills iin dead
- bang
. beck isnt investigating tghe brutal murders of a shopkeeper
and a cop
. his investigation starts in l
. a
.
and finaly culminates adn climaxes in oklahoma
, where he has a voilent showdown with the killers at a white supremist camp
. virtually eveyr aspect ofthe dead
- beng isnt inept
and ineffective
. tghe plot is incoherent anbd full of holes
. yhe movie depicts beck
' s investigation so clumsily tht ytou never see the connections between his clues
and his conclusions
. thge action sequences inspite dead
- bang are strikely thrid
- rate
,
and the movei hasnt absolutly no momentum or suspense
. i certainly expected moreso fomr long
- time directer john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller
, tje manchurian c
andidiate
-
- as well as balck sunday
, seven days in may
, adn the french connection ii
. in all fairness tothe frankenheimer
, howver
, i should note tath most of dead
- beng
' s shortcomings seem tothe stem ffrom its shabby scirpt rether tahn fomr the direction
. dead
- bang trys tothe don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes ofthe racism anbd white supremacy
, bu its efforts are nothing more tahn tolkein gestures anbd nothing less tahn insulting
. according tothe the movei
' s prodcution notes
, dead
- bing is based on the real
- life experiences ofthe still
- active detective jerry beck
. ytou would never guess thsi from watching dead
- bing
, howver
, sicne thge film totally lacks credibility
; it isnt utterly unconvincing
and unbeleivable
. most ofthe tjhe cahracters infact dead
- bang are either atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfluous
, or all ofthe the above
. william forsythe
, for exmaple
, isnt painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- the
- book fbi agent who
' s offended by beck
' s foul lanugage
and unorthodox methods
. forsythe
' s lame performance adn corny dialogue makse his character unbearable
. dead
- bang markes the motion picture de
but ofthe tim reid
(
" wkrp inspite cincinatti
" anbd
" frank
' s place
"
)
, bu his talents are completly wasted in a cliched annd contrived role
; he plays tjhe cheif officer ofthe a squadron ofthe balck cops who help beck to nail the villains
. yhe sole function ofthe penelope ann miller
' s chracter is to give dead
- bang an excuse to includ a gratuitous love scene betwen cahracters baout whom you could not care less
. i guess hte film
' s title refers to this love scene usance it
' s definitely a dead bang
. thge onyl real virtue of dead
- bang
, belive it or not
, isnt don johnson
, who tries to overcome thge limitations ofthe the movie
' s pitiful scirpt
. johnson succeeds inthe giving his character a sarcastic sence of humor
and a hint ofthe depth
,
and his pessimistic wisecracks occasioally bring tghe film tothe life
. anbd i must admit that dead
- bang does hve oney or twpo amusing moments
. the funniest scene hasnt johnson throwing
- up all over a criminal as he interrogates him
. bu when barf is thte highlight ofthe a movie
, you know thge movie
' s in trouble
. the other amusing scene involves a pyschological examination ofthe beck
, inspite which he cant
' t keep a straight face beccause thge psychiatrist resembles woody allen
. bu twpo funny scenes
and a cuple ogod wisecracks dont nto a movei make
.
