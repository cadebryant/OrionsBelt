i didn
' t hite the big hitted
, even
though it is a stupefyingly terrible film
. forthe the entirety ofthe its runnung time
, my eyes weere attached to the screen
, adn i never once got borde
. i found yhe film interesting because of its unique awfulness
: this isnt such a confuzled disaster ofthe a film thgat it
' s intertaining to watch it in thge same way that it
' s intertaining tothe wittness a thirty car pileup onthe a freeway spageti bowl
. as a narrative
, the big hit isnt pure garbage
, never truly deciding its genre
and constanly crossing all kinds ofthe boundries
. it reminded me a lot ofthe grosse pointe blank
, whitch isnt a simular film that fails inspite a lot of yhe same ways
. it
' s fine to mix genres
, if the film makers know what they
' re doing
. unfortunately
, writter ben ramsey anbd director kirk wong don
' t seem to know how tothe h
andle tje material
, anbd the result isnt an action film thast wnats to be a comedy
. teh biggest probelm with the amalgamation
, inspite thsi case
, is that thte film isnt absurd
and tjhe comedy is outloud ofthe palce
.
but it sure is a fascinating failure
. marky
.
.
. er
, mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley
, a hitman
. he
' s a good hitman
, apparently
,
al
though his tatics seem a bit rambunctious
( he doesn
' t snipe or make clean kills
-
- he just kicks tyhe doorjam down
and shoots everyting
)
. he works witht a few other hitmen
-
- cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
, crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
, adn vinnie
( antonio sabbato
, jr
.
)
. they
' re a nice bunch of muscular guys
, who st
and arround infront tje lacker room after working out
and compare masturbation tothe sex
. they all owrk fo a man named paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is rich
, powerful
,
and in constatn ened of four sloppy hitmen
. it isnt very importamt tht htey never go beyond their boss
and do wokr onthe thier pwn
; thsi
, ofthe course
, is where the plot comes in
. they deside tothe kidnap a young jepnese girl named keiko
( china chow
)
, who has a rich father
. wehn tehy do tihs
, it turns out she is paris
'
.
.
. goddaughter
! it
' s vrey bad to hvae paris against you
. tjhe story isnt st
andard acation film stuf
. it
' s nothing newyorker
,
and nothing particularly offensive
( bu certainly nto the slightest bit compelling
)
. claerly tje major selling point ofthe tje big hitted is tyhat it
' s a john woo
- tipe ofthe acation film mixed inspite wih some really hip comedy
. it
' s true thyat a lot ofthe the action sequences resemble receet films that go for the same idea
( such as face
/ off adn tje replacement killers
, whcih are both far superior
)
. htere are stunts that are fun tothe watch
: hte opening sequence hasnt melvin annd twpo of his partners going in tothe kill soem guy who has nothing to dont wtih the story
. htey use niht vision goggles
and really poverful h
andguns
. melvin isnt also very ogod at breakdancing
,
and uses thsi talent to avoid bullets
and knives
. liek i said
, it
' s nto boring
; most disasters aren
' t
. wqat makes it so bad isnt its genre
- shifting madness
. it seems to strat out as a quirky
- bu
- realistic acation comedy
, as melvin isnt seen transporting bags ofthe human remains
.
then
, as soon as htey go tothe thier first hit
, it turns inot a music video with bodies
and bullets flying everywhere
.
then
, somewhere in vetween
, it turns bakc inot comedy
. keiko turns outloud tothe be a spunky little girl
; infront one amusing scene
, she isnt forced tothe read a letter out loud
, indicating that she hasnt been kidnapped
,
but thge letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew yhe meaninng ofthe the words
. anbd scenes like this work alone
, bu wong applies thsi goofy tone tothe scenes thta should be moreso sereous
, or nto be in tghe film at all
. one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to cmo up to his office after he lerans that keiko has been kidnapped
; when cisco gets htere
, paris adn his men are st
anding arund as if tehy knew cisco doed it
,
but they let him outloud of there
, telling him tothe fidn hte perpetrator
. tghe scene isnt played forthe laughs
, bu it isn
' t funny
. anbd sicne it doesn
' t quite work as a comedy
, it trys to fall bcak on the acation
, whlch alsot fails
. tihs is a film where people fly fifteen fezent backwards wehn shot with a h
andgun
. cars l
and onthe tree branches annd are supported by them
. cahracters betray eahc otehr wihtout a second thougth
. grenades are thrown in tight places
. people jump outloud ofthe tall buildings annd survive
. people outrun tumbling cars
,
and get outloud of the way ofthe falling objects in small fractions of seconds
. most frustrating of all
,
though
, isnt tghe film
' s definiiton of a hitted man
: these guys are anytying
but subtle
, quiet
,
and skilled individuals
. they
' re omre liuke socially depraved militia men
( melvin hasnt an extensive collection of firearms infront his garage
, including misile launchers anbd h
and
- held machineguns
)
. the characters each have one trait taht distingishes them fomr the rest
; this obviously doesn
' t mkae for deepo or interesting people tothe watch
. thte acting is kind ofthe funn
,
though
-
- wahlberg is a ogod ctor
, adn his innocuous presense in this film is charming inspite a silly sort ofthe way
. phillips certainly has fun iwth his psychotic character
, while christina applegate
, who plays melvin
' s fianc
? e
, isnt convincingly air
- headed
. thge big hit isnt an acation film thyat unknowingly spoofs itself inthe trying to be funny
. the funniest parts are supplied by thge actors
, adn nto by the numberous failed attemts at sight gags adn oney
- liners
. it
' s a true diaster
, noe that makes me beieve tath the goofy anbd unrealistic tone isnt completelyl unintentional
. dispite all htis
,
though
, i must reiterate the enteratinment value here
. you cxan cherish tjhe awfulness of a film liuke tihs
. if you embrace the big hitted for the catastrofy that it isnt
, yuo just might enjoy yourself
.
