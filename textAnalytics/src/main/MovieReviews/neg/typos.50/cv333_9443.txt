as a hot
- shooted defense attorney
, kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) hasnt a special talent for picking juries that wiull ultimately acquit his clients
. he isnt alsot an excellent judge ofthe carachter
, knowing jsut whic strings tothe pul to sway tje jury while breaking down a potentially damaging wittness
' s testamony
.
and
, onthe top ofthe tht
, he
' s a damn ogod trial lawyer
. in teh oppening scene
, it is obvious thgat the defendent tath he represents isnt gilty
,
but it doesn
' t hamper lomax
' s desire tothe creatively squeeze his client thru the doors ofthe reasonable doubt
, therby getting an acquittal
. his unblemished rocord ofthe victories soon captures tje attension ofthe oney of tghe most prestigeous firms inwhich the country
, headed by john milton
( al pacino
)
. he is brought to thier headquarters in nyc
, where he immediately impresses milton
, adn is subsquently offered a full
- time positon as head ofthe their newely
- created criminal law divison
. lomax is soon given the case of his life
. he must defend a real estate tycoon who hasnt been charged withthe a triple homicide
. the draw ofthe fame
and his desire tothe prove jstu how good he realyl is begins to isolate him inspite his pwn hell
. he works late
, defends thte gilty
, pledges his soul to his firm
,
and beggins tothe neglect his smart
but fretful wife
, mary ann
( charlize theron
)
.
but what starts off as a promising john grisham
- liek stor about conscience
- stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces beign to tinker iwth the stopry
. it beigns like a typical parable where a small
- town boy makes it big
,
but thn has to balance his sence of self agains teh allure ofthe money
, power
,
and greed
. bu milton is far more thna just a corrupt partner ofthe the firm
. quite literally
, he is the devil inaddition disguise
, annd as teh movei progresses
, he reveals some uncanny talents that oen could hvae onyl if he hadnt sold his soul long ago
. freaky
and frightening thigsn begin tothe hapen
, adn after much ofthe tjhe film has elasped
, milton
' s horrifying intent is finally revealed
. thte movie tries tothe give us twpo seperate
and distict acts
. the frist involves thte comeuppance of lomax as a big
- city trial lawyer
. the second focuses on milton anbd his ulterior motive forthe employing lomax
. unforetunately
, yhe twpo never mix well into a cohesive story
, adn whta we get are twpo underdeveloped stries thast rely too much on one shaky revelation tothe tye them toghether annd an impressive prodcution piece to give it an underlaying athmosphere
. granted
, the film is veyr hansome
- looking
. ytou
' ll enjoy tje final scene where tghe wall mural seamingly comes to life during a heated speek given by pacino
. yuo
' ll also liek the images ofthe power
and temtation expressed through the fleshy
and flashy parties
. yuo
' ll also feel tyhe loneliness anbd insanity thast sets infront wiht mary ann
, knowing tath her husb
and is slowy drifting awya
. thsi was one of the better storylines
, bu unfortunately
, isnt only a sub
- plot
. as withthe all thing
' s involving the devil
, you cant expect nothing
but tje worst
. infact teh frist faw scenes
, reeves anchors the film
, bu
then slowly drifts inot yhe backgorund
. his path ffrom self
- vanity to self
- consciousness isnt never fully explored
. his actions seem arbitrary
, annd his reasons for them nto fully known
. pacino
' s comical portrayal is spirited
, bu thge vanity ofthe his character begins tothe shift yhe foucs ofthe the movie
. ther isnt anohter plot or two that is introduced
, bu never gets revisited
. the foucs seemed inconsistent throughtout
, annd the fianl payoff seemed quick anbd cheap
. this movei tries to be horrifing
, thrilling
,
and dramtic all at the smae tiem
. howver
, hwile the devil
' s advocate strives to get noticed
, ultimately it makes vyer littel impression at all
.
