as a hot
- shooted defense attorney
, kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) hasnt a special talent for picking juries tht will ultimately acquit his clients
. he isnt also an excellent judge of character
, knowing jstu which strings tothe pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness ' s testamony
.
adn
, onthe top ofthe tath
, he ' s a damn ogod trial lawyer
. in hte opening scene
, it isnt obvious that yhe defendant that he represents is guilty
,
bu it doesn ' t hamper lomax ' s desire to creatively squeeze his client thru teh doors of reasonable dout
, therby getting an acquittal
. his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention ofthe noe of the most presitgious firms infront the ocuntry
, headed by john milton
( al pacino
)
. he is brung tothe their headquarters in nyc
, where he imediately impresses milton
,
and isnt subsequently offred a full
- time possition as head ofthe their newly
- created criminal law division
. lomax is soon given teh case of his life
. he must defend a real estate tycoon who hasnt beeen charged with a triple homicide
. the draw ofthe fame
annd his desire tothe prove just how ogod he raelly isnt beggins to isolate him inwhich his own hell
. he works late
, defends the guilty
, pledges his soul tothe his firm
,
anbd beggins to neglect his smart
bu fretful wief
, mary ann
( charlize theron
)
.
bu wqat starts off as a promising john grisham
- like story about conscience
- stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces beign to tinker whith the stor
. it beigns like a typical parable where a small
- twon boy makse it big
,
but
thne has to balance his sence ofthe self against the allure ofthe money
, power
,
and greed
.
bu milton is far more thna just a corrupt partner ofthe the firm
. qutie literally
, he is the devil inwhich disguise
,
and as the movei progresses
, he reveals some uncanny talents thgat one could hvae only if he had sold his soul long ago
. freaky
and frightening thigsn begin tothe appen
,
adn after much of the film has elasped
, milton ' s horrifying entent isnt finally revealed
. tje movei tries tothe give us twpo eparate
and distict acts
. the firt involves the comeuppance ofthe lomax as a big
- city trial lawyer
. the second focusses on milton
anbd his ulterior motive for employing lomax
. unfortunatley
, teh twpo never mix well inot a cohesive story
,
adn what we get are twpo underdeveloped stories thta rely too much on oney shaky revelation to tie them together
anbd an impressive production piece to give it an underlaying atmosphere
. granted
, the film is very hansome
- looking
. ytou ' ll enjoy tjhe fianl scene where tjhe wall mural seamingly comes to life durring a heated speech given by pacino
. yuo ' ll also like thte images of power
and temptation expressed through tjhe fleshy
adn flashy parties
. yuo ' ll also feel the lonelyness
annd insanity that sets in with mary ann
, knowing that her husband isnt slowy drifting away
. this was oney ofthe thte better storylines
,
but unfortunately
, is onyl a sub
- plot
. as with all hting ' s involving the devil
, you can expect nothing
bu yhe worst
. in teh frist fewd scenes
, reeves anchors hte film
,
but
thn slowy drifts inot the backround
. his path from self
- vanity tothe self
- consciousness is never fully explored
. his actions seem arbitrary
,
anbd his reasons forthe them not fully known
. pacino ' s comical protrayal is spirited
,
but yhe vanity of his character beigns to shift tje focus ofthe the movei
. htere isnt anohter plot or two thta isnt introduced
,
bu never gets revisited
. the focus seemed inconsistent throughout
,
and tje fianl payoff seemed quick
and cheap
. thsi movie trys tothe be horrifing
, thrilling
,
and dramatic all at the same tiome
.
howver
, hwile the devil ' s advocate strives tothe get noticed
, ultimately it makes vyre littel impression at all
.
