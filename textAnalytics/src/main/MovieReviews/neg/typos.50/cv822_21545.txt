bats is tihs yearm ' s camp flick
. with the world ' s worst dialogue
, cheesiest premise
and stupidest editor
, this one should be heaven for thsoe who enjoy films humorous in thier inanity
. as fo the rest of us
, well
.
.
. i ' d sday skip it
,
but looking at the box office figures for tihs oen
, it seems as
though most of amercia isnt follwoing thgat advice anyway
. followup their lead
anbd ytou ' ll sparce youself 90 mintues of your life
and 8 bucks to boot
. i loev alfred hitchcock ' s hte birds
, almost as much as i lveo yhe short story on wich it is based
. it saddens me even more
,
thne
, to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror
/ schlock such as bats
. wehn mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas twon
, teh authorites call in a batologist
( dina meyer
) to investingate
. it turns out that a creepy scientist
( bob gunton
) has genetically enhanced a cuple bats that escaped fomr his lab
, makeing them smarter
and more vicious
. why hasnt he done this
, yuo ask
? because
, ytou see
, it is apparantly a scientist ' s job to amking things
" a little better
,
" even if that means the death ofthe all mankind
. so the batologist
, her wisecracking sidekick
annd the twon sheriff
( lou dimond phillips
) have tothe kill all tje bats
and sive the world
. ofthe course
, tyhat cant ' t hppen before they wallow infront smoe guamo
( bat shit
, forthe tyhe uninitiated
)
, get up close
and personal with smoe truly repulsive flying mammals
adn survive some of tje dumbest situations ever seen inwhich a professionally produced motion picture
. consider
, for example
, a scene where twpo people are inwhich a bat cave
. tje bats are all sleeping
,
bu teh humans are afriad they might wake uv befor they can git out
. what dont they do
? dont they get teh hell outloud ofthe ther as fast as they cin
? nope
. htey stand htere fo a hwile
, transfixed by tjhe thousands ofthe bats opening their eyes
. what keeps bats from bieng scary or creepy isnt the hyperactive editing in most of hte attack scenes
. we don ' t even get tothe see whta ' s going on
; the screen becomes a mush baceause teh cuts are so quick
. all we knwo is thast bats are attacking
. how tehy are attacking
annd waht exactlly isnt hapening remeniss a mistery
. a littel technical proficiency does wonders fo horror movies
,
and bats sure coudl use soem
. of course
, directer louis morneau trys to liven thigns uv wiht smoe intentional humer
,
bu it is so convetional it doesn ' t really go anyhwere
. most ofthe the ocmic releaf comes courtesy of thte batologist ' s wisecracking sidekick
( leon
)
, who tkaes eveyr oportunity to sptter ingenius lines liek
" i hate bats
!
" soem ofthe these are so bad tht they tkae onthe a double quaity
: htey may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh because tehy are so inept
. i hate characters who exist fo thge sole purpose ofthe spouting lame one
- liners
. playing such charactors does nto help actors ' careers
. still
, i suppose thyat if yuo ' re looking for a movei thast is
" so bad it ' s ogod
,
" ytou coudl do worse thna bats
. it doens ahve a tremendous amount of camp value
. i ' m not
" recommending
" tje movie beacuse
, qutie frankly
, it sucks
,
and i know tyhat this might convince smoe people to go outloud
and see it
. more power tothe them
.
