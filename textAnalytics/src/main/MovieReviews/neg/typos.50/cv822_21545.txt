bats isnt tihs yearm
' s camp flick
. with the world
' s worst dialogue
, cheesiest premise
and stupidest editor
, tihs oen shouldnt be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in thier inanity
. as for the rest of us
, well
.
.
. i
' d sday skip it
,
but looking at teh box office figures for this noe
, it seems as
though most ofthe america isnt follwoing that advice anyway
. folow their lead adn you
' ll sparce youself 90 mintues ofthe your life anbd 8 bucks tothe boot
. i lvoe alfred hitchcock
' s the birds
, almost as much as i loev thte short storey on which it is based
. it saddens me even more
,
then
, to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror
/ schlock such as bats
. when mysterous bat attacks occur in a small texas town
, tyhe authorities call iin a batologist
( dina meyer
) to investigate
. it turns out thyat a creepy scientist
( bob gunton
) hasnt genetically enhanced a couple bats thgat escaped ffrom his lab
, makeing them smarter adn more vicious
. why hasnt he done this
, ytou ask
? beacuse
, you see
, it isnt apparently a scientist
' s job tothe make thigsn
" a little better
,
" even if taht means the death of all mankind
. so tjhe batologist
, her wisecracking sidekick
and the twon sherif
( lou diamond phillips
) ahev tothe kill all yhe bats adn sive tje world
. of course
, thyat cin
' t happen befor they wallow inspite soem guamo
( bat shit
, for the uninitiated
)
, get uv close annd peronal with smoe truly repulsive flying mammals
and survive soem ofthe tje dumbest situations ever seen iin a professionally produced motion picture
. consider
, for exemple
, a scene where two peple are iin a bat cave
. thte bats are all sleeping
,
but the humans are affraid they might wake uv before tehy can get outloud
. waht dont htey do
? do tehy git yhe hell out ofthe htere as fast as they can
? nope
. tehy st
and htere forthe a hwile
, transfixed by the thous
ands of bats opening their eyes
. what keeps bats ffrom being scray or creepy isnt the hyperactive editing in most of tyhe attack scenes
. we don
' t even get to see what
' s gonig onthe
; the screen becomes a mush becouse hte cuts are so quick
. all we know is that bats are attacking
. how tehy are attacking anbd wqat exactlly isnt hapening remeniss a mistery
. a little technical proficiency doesnt wonders forthe horror movies
, anbd bats sure could use some
. of course
, director louis morneau tries tothe liven thigns uv with smoe intentional humor
,
but it is so convential it doesn
' t realy go anywhere
. most ofthe tje ocmic relief comes courtesy ofthe tghe batologist
' s wisecracking sidekick
( leon
)
, who tkaes every opprotunity tothe sptter ingenious lines liek
" i hite bats
!
" smoe of theese are so bad that they take onthe a double quality
: they may inspire a smirk by theri very nature
and a roaring laugh because tehy are so inept
. i hate cahracters who exsist for thte sole purpose ofthe spouting lame one
- liners
. palying such characters does not halp actors
' careers
. still
, i suppose that if you
' re looking forthe a movie thgat is
" so bad it
' s good
,
" you could dont worse than bats
. it does have a tremendous amount of camp value
. i
' m not
" recomending
" the movei because
, qutie frankly
, it sucks
, anbd i know tath this might convince some people to go outloud anbd see it
. omre pwoer tothe them
.
