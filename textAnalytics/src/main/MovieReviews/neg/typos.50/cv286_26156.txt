here i sit at my computer about tothe rwite my review of thte reccent acation comedy
" bait
" starring jamie foxx adn david morse
. htis isnt a review i don
' t even want tothe rwite because i
' d jstu be laying tje same criticisms on it tath i woudl wiht any other so
- generic
-
and
- predictable
- it
' s
- beyond
- rediculous piece of hollywood fluff
. if they
' re nto oging to give us
, the audiance
, just a littel credit
and put something toghether with half a brain
, why should i waste my time anbd mental energy criticising it
? last summer i tookover this smae approach with my review ofthe
" the mummy
,
" inaddition thta review i jsut qouted phrases my reviews ofthe otehr sub
- par movies
. i thikn i shall do tjhe smae thing here
but wih a few less quotes
( not all are applicable
)
. i hope this goes to show you waht i think of
" bait
" annd why yuo can fidn outloud all you ened to know baout it without haveing tothe tkae a wild guess
. it
' s genuinely unfunny
( i
, adn yhe otehr audiance munbers only laughed once during the entire twpo hours
)
, unoriginal
and unthrilling
. it
' s not so bad tothe yhe point where it
' s fun to watch because of its badness anbd it
' s no so bad yuo absolute loathe it anbd are pained by watching it
, it
' s jstu such a cliche inspite annd ofthe itself
, that
, uhh
.
.
. lost my turain of thougth
. anyways
, here
' s those quotes
, enjoy
!
" getting an audience
' s attension right fomr tje beginnig plays a major role inwhich how todya

. we want tothe have something exicting to watch
, not a slow build
- up ofthe a storey
( god forbid

" it
' s clear tyhe film doesn
' t want tothe waste tiome onthe reality
and thus tghe attempt to establish plausability
( hte most minimal amount neccessary
) comes across as a half
- assed efford
. supporting characters
and shady sup
- plots are intruduced
, bu as is the case witht films made up ofthe a larg cast ofthe charactors
, onyl a h
andfull have any rela signifigance
.
.
. there
' s a fine line separating homage from plagiarism
