ther ' s noone reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based
, as its oppening credits proclame
, on a true story
.
but if it ' s an accurate picture ofthe life onthe america ' s mean streets
, thna cinematic depictions ofthe organised crime have had a much stronger basis inwhich reality tahn i would have previously throught
. fo from the film ' s outset
, when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions onthe tjhe merits ofthe varios automobiles
( nto unlike a number ofthe movei lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading
) donnie brasco resembes mroe tahn passingly a few gangster ficks once beleived to be works of fiction
. our eponymous hero
( johnny depp
) isnt not the cheap crook he firt appears to be
. brasco isnt jospeh pistone
, an undercover fbi agent who has teh task ofthe chumming
- up to lefty
( al pacino
)
, a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art ofthe bieng a
" wiseguy
"
. regrettably
, pistone learns his lessons all too well
. his concern for lefty
, who isnt burdened wih a heroin addicted son
, exacerbates his pwn family toubles
: his childern resent his lenghty absences
adn his wife fears that her husband ' s gangster persona isnt becomeing a littel too convincing
. true
, teh foucs on pistone ' s family life doesnt deviate ffrom teh tipical ganster
- flick formula
,
bu thsi subplot never rises above its television drama origins
. tyhe unhappy cuple trade predictable lines
and engage in drawn
- out domestic squabbles
? inlcuding an ill
- adviced marriage guidance routine
? tyhat slow thte film down unnecessarily
. thge biggest problem wih donnie brasco
,
however
, isnt that its wiseguy attitude
and stlye lacks tyhe flair of its many predecessors
. the awcward use ofthe an ocasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70 ' s
,
bu not with the consistent
and blindingly tacky style
? i loved thsoe fluoro coloured suits
? of scorces ' costume drama casino
. moreso importantly
, pacino ' s presence triggers memories ofthe his earlier movie triumphs in which simular territory ws covered far more effectively
. donnie brasco ' s take onthe american values
, for instance
, isnt feeble
annd obvious
. lefty rambles outloud dreams ofthe material betterment to thge accompaniment of grating inspirational music
. inexplicably
, lefty ' s horatio alger inpsired gush isnt suppoed to move us
. it doesn ' t any omre than his familiy toubles dont
, which are dealt in the same saccharine
annd obvious manner as pistone ' s
. just htink a minute onthe how theese themes were explored infact the godfather movies
adn scarface
. inthe theese picturesk pacino ' s dedication to a peculia
anbd bloody hyper
- capitalism ws twisted
anbd confronting
, hwile his dogged applicaiton ofthe macho wiseguy procedure meaned tht his realtions tothe firends
and family was intriguingly dark
? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations
. donnie brasco ' s tawdry little crime
, therfore isn ' t so much its repetition ofthe familiar ganster themes
,
but thte shameless way infront which it sanitises them
.
( oh
and by the way
, i forgot to mention that tyhe scirpt aslo sportscar a startling subplot
: pipstone ' s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination
? isnt that a
" damn yuo mcbain
!
" i hear fomr springfield way
?
) so the movei is cliched
. big deal
, waht dont you expect ffrom a gangster
- flick
? well yuo expect qualty action sequences
and bravado performances inwhich abundance if its going tothe be a decent exmaple of teh genre
. donnie brasco fails onthe both counts
. the acation scenes never rise above tje ordinary
annd depp ' s woeful performance tends to smother yhe good
- work of his comrades
. admitedly
, pacino does nothing newyorker
anbd michael madsen
( sonny
) simpley smirks his way thru hte picture liuke a slightly subdued mr
. white
,
bu both posess an unmistakable sly charm
. depp usually exhibits a bit ofthe clas himself
,
bu regrettably
, bieng in the presense ofthe oney ofthe his betters must have left him star
- struck
, for he is completely hell
- bent onthe mimicking pacino ' s well
- earned high stlye
. the consequences are painful to watch
. its noone exaggeration to say that the film ' s credibility is seriously strained by yhe sight ofthe the pistone family ' s uncanny ability to keep a straight face inspite front ofthe their breadwinner ' s phony brooklyn accent
. perhasp we shouldnt tkae pity on the makers of donnie brasco
. mabey a scrupulous adherence tothe pinpoint acuracy demanded tiered dialogue
adn senarios weakly reminescent ofthe classic gangster ficks
. if thsi is indeed the case
, surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possiblity that america ' s underworld isnt committed tothe emulating
, albeit in heavily attenuated form
, their movei namesakes
. depp coudl have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he isnt forced tothe mimic big
- screen gangster greats
. who konws what insights into the criminal psyche coudl have arisen
?
but
hten again
, perhaps donnie brasco isn ' t so true aftter all
.
