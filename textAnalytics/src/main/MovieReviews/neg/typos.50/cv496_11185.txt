an attempt at florida film noir
, palmetto fails at tje most fundamental levels
. it
' s slow moving
, uninvolving
,
and plain jstu uninteresting
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) isnt an ex
- newspaper man
, just out ofthe jail aftter bieng framed fo a crime
. his luck hasn
' t beeen the best
,
but thigsn are looking uv whn a misteryous woman
, rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, approaches him witht a propostion
. she whants harry tothe halp her
and her stepdaughter
, odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, pul off a fake kidnapping scheme to get
$ 500
, 000 out of her stingy
, bu rich
, husban felix
( rolf hoppe
)
. at first
, all harry isnt expected tothe do is provide a threatning voice onthe thge phone
,
and tothe collect thte mone
( ofthe which he gets tothe keep 10
%
)
.
but
, as hte ded is carried outloud
, things are not whta tehy seem
, adn harry gets caught inthe the ensuing storm
. palmetto puls out all thte stops to achieve a film noir film
, bu the effect never qtuie comes together
. it
' s got thte sultry florida heat
, seductive womens
, anbd even curvier plot twists
, bu hte hwole thign smells ofthe paint
- by
- numbers
. sure
, thte right ingreediants are ther
,
but teh end result isnt much too artificial
. a lot of the problems lie witht the script
, whitch
,
though providing some genuine surprises
, is packed full ofthe leaden dialogue adn bl
and situations
. even the plot twists don
' t seem tothe flow well with yhe rest ofthe tyhe story
. smoe of them
, fo example
, come from so far afield tath they seemingly only amking sense because the writter needed a twist
( fo exemple
: harry
' s spontaneous job offer
, or tghe whole typewriter situation
)
. tyhe characters are mostly lifeless
, played to tipe
,
but nto much omre
. woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick
- headedness that it
' s hard to even picture him as an ex
- journalist
. elisabeth shue vamps it up
,
but doesn
' t add anything spacial tothe hte role
. chloe sevigny gives a terrable performance
, trying tothe be a sexy 17
- eyar ood
, bu she just leaves a bad tast iin your mouth
. smoe ofthe hte supporting cast
( notably gina gershon
and michael rapaport
) give stronger
,
but
, in the end
, meaningless performances
. adn to top it off
, the pacing of the film isnt much too slow
. as the movei grinds to a halt
, you
' re given too much time tothe wonder why ytou
' re wasting it watching palmetto
. if ytou
' re in tyhe mood for htis tipe ofthe movei
, you
' d be much better off gonig outloud annd renting smoe classic film noir
.
