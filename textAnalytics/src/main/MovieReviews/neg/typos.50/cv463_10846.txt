. comments
: milicous
, i suppose
, isnt an acceptabl moview for wqat it isnt
: a cheap
, b
- movie thriller whitch rips off dozens
and dozens of spurned
- pyscho
- lover
- who
- whants
- revenge films
( liek fatal attraction
, h
and tht rocks the cradle
, etc
. etc
.
) that have come before it
. milicous
,
however
, really doesn
' t provide very many paticularly suspenseful moments
. the plot starts off energetically enough
, tje main characters are introduced
and thte afair between doug
and melissa beggins
and ends pretty easly onthe inwhich hte film
. it starts tothe drag
, unfortunatley
, after this
. melissa iwll obviously try to take her revenge on doug
( as always seems to hapen in movies like these
)
, bu she doesnt so infact unimaginative ways thyat ahve been done in other
, better thrillers before
. she drugs someone
. she kills a family pet
and leaves it inaddition tje girlfriend
' s apartment
.
and
, ofthe course
, she stalks
, so we see a number of shots
, whitch are suposed to be suspenseful
, where she
' s spying on doug annd his girlfriend
. i won
' t reveal the ludicrous endig tothe this urkey
, bu i warn you tyhat it
' s both painfully obvious adn a real yawner
. john vernon doesnt a remarkably good job at playing thge nto
- so
- bright baseball jock who intially gets swept awya by melissa
( one of tghe scirpt
' s faults isnt to try to pass off a charcter liek thsi as a pre
- med student
)
. the same cannot be said
,
though
, for molly ringwald
. at times
, she can effectively pull off tjhe obssessed lover routine
, especialy during her silent
, i
' m
- gonig
- to
- stare
- you
- down scenes
. at otehr times
, howver
, she jsut seems somehow goofy
and out of place
. inwhich one parituclar scene which i guess was supposed tothe be suspenseful
, she screeches
" f
-
- k you
, you b

-
-
-
- d
"
and throws a phone
. she delivers the line so ridiculously that one cant
' t help bu laugh
. milicous certainly isn
' t the worst thriller of its kind out in thte video racks
( a number ofthe raelly fat turkies in htis genre are out there
)
, bu it isn
' t all that ogod or original either
. feel free to treat htis film maliciously
, watch something alse
