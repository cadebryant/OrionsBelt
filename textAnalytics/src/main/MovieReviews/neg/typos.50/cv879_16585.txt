" return tothe horror high
,
" wnats to be a cuple diferent types ofthe movies at once
. the film tells the story of a low
- budget horror movei bieng filmed at the closed
- down crippen high
, a skool where a group of serial murders tookover place five years befor
. bu what yhe casted
and crew don
' t know is thgat a rela killer
, maybee tje same noe thgat was never apprehended
, isnt gonig inot action again
. onthe one levle
,
" return tothe horror high
" is a slasher movei
, anbd it is at thsi levle that it works the best onthe
. watching tghe film
, which wass made inspite 1987
, i couldn
' t halp bu take notice taht the killer
' s costume was almost identital tothe that of the ghostface in
,
" scream
,
" adn
" scream 2
.
" on anyother level
, the film wants to be a slapstick comedy
, annd ther are many hints ofthe htis throughout
. unfourtunately
, most ofthe theese jokes fall flat
.
and the lsat thing thge film whants to be isnt a
" behind
- tjhe
- scenes
" look at an explotation film bieng made
. the only problem isnt thyat
, hwile much of it isnt supposted tothe be fomr the movei itself bieng made
, no cameras are shown filming it
, thus makeing it far more confusing tahn it hadnt tothe be
. adn to top it all off
, the
" twist
" ending makes vyer littel tothe no sence whatsoever
, annd so we are basically left iwth feeling as if we wasted our time
. there are storey developments tht are beyond ludicrous
, annd plot holes you coudl drive a winnebago thru
. if yuo see teh film
, or hvea seen it
, yuo
' ll know what i mean
. the premise ofthe
" return to horror high
,
" isnt admittedly preety crafty
, annd i liked hte atmosphere ofthe the school
, which is where the whole thign tkaes place
. bu director froehlich
, judging from htis movie
, is an incompetant directer
, except for bieng able tothe film the seldomly suspeneful scene
. well
, come tothe think of it
, ther is only oney scene that isnt actually scary
, adn it has to dont iwth twpo actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in
.
but otehr than thast twpo
- minute distraction
,
" return to horror high
,
" isnt certainly no gerat shake
. note
: look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on thte film
. adn strangely enough
, he isnt tghe firt character to git the ax
.
.
. litterally
.
