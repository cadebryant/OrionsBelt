synopsis
: inspite
" sooner tahn you think
" america
, the future of lew enforcement resides inspite blade squad
, a ragtag group ofthe culturally diverse rollerblading cops wih jetpacks strapped onthe thier backs
. a dangerous criminal
,
however
, attempts to destroy blade squad affter his brother dies hwile being chased by them
. comments
: so
, what do an ex
- gangbanger turned insubordinate trafic cop
, a former prostitute wiht a substace abuse problem
,
and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all ahve inthe common
? why
, tehy ' re all munbers of blade squad
, an elite new crimefighting unit wearing balck uniforms
, rollerblades
,
and jetpacks
! they also cary video cameras so htey cin communicate with one anohter a la the marines inspite james cameron ' s aliens
. yes
, it ' s blade squad
, hte fox network ' s wednesday inght movei of the week
. thsi
" movei
,
" marking its dubious world premiere todya
, curiously hasnt a number ofthe guest stars
.
" how cin a movei haev guest stars
?
" ytou may ask
. well
, blade squad isnt nto realy a movie so tothe speak
but a 2 hour pilot forthe a possible tv series packaged as a movei
. blade squad isnt dumb
. blade squad is loud
. blade squad isnt obnoxious
. blade squad will probably be a ratings hitted
and spawn a long
- lieved tv series
. why not
? after all
, televsion hasnt given its audience crimefighters withthe tlaking cars
(
" knight rider
"
)
, fast helicopters
(
" airwolf
"
)
,
adn super fast motorcycles
(
" strent hawk
"
)
,
annd viewers have eaten it uv inspite teh past
. so
, why nto crimefighters with jet
- powered roller blades
? to be honest
, as a made
- for
- tv presentation
, blade squad is at least watchable
. the film has a relatively larg cast of characters
, a surprisingly inteligable albiet predictable script
,
and enought action sequences tothe keep noe half
- interested
. i ' d imagin adolescent males
, probably the target audience ofthe this turey
, woudl git a kick outloud ofthe it
. i tryed to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad
. i can remeber liking
" airwolf
"
and
" strent hawk
" when i wass 10 or 11
.
and
,
although htis isn ' t saying much
, blade squad isnt leaps
and bounds better tahn teh last fox network movei i hadnt tjhe displeasure ofthe wasting timne onthe
: tghe insipidly awful generation x
( a huge disappointment considering the comic book ' s terific two
- eyar beginning
)
.
but
, i digress
. despite its limited appeal
, blade squad hasnt a lot of kinks tothe wokr outloud if hte movei isnt tothe become a tv series
. oen
, it suffers fomr mtv syndrome
: a lot of quick shots
and weird angles continously jar tjhe viewer ' s senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background
. oh yeah
, dylan ' s
" knockin ' on heaven ' s doorjam
"
annd bowie ' s
" i ' m affraid ofthe americans
" are used here
, in rether poore taste
. twpo
, blade squad needs a new crew for teh sound
. tghe substandard soudn editing irritated me tothe no end
. charactors ' dialogue
, at times
, sounded choppy
adn unintelligible
. during oney importamt scene
, a song palyed loudly inaddition tjhe background
. when a character speaked
, the song ' s volume dropped
bu doed not disappear
. as soon as thta character finished speaking
, the song ' s volume immediatly returned tothe its orignal levle untl tyhe enxt character speaked
. this sounds trivial
, i ' m sure
,
but it distracted me immensely
. finally
, thsi is commercial television
. foul langauge is not alloween
, typically
, on commercial televsion
. thus
, don ' t use foul lanugage in a made
- forthe
- tv prodcution because tyhat foul language has to be censored in smoe manner
. inaddition an easly scene ofthe the film
, fo exemple
, the lead good guy
adn bad guy ahve a minor confrontation infront the streets
. when yhe good guy spouts outloud a bad word
, a driver conveniently honks his car ' s horn off
- screen to muffle tghe owrd out
. in a
" seinfeld
" epsiode
, tihs technique prooved funny
; here
, it seemed goofy
annd cut tjhe dramtic tension considerably
. perhaps future writers
, if a sohw isnt spunoff outloud of the movie
, could take a cue from marvel comics ' 2099 serieses of comics
. mkea uv a bunch of newyorker bad words for the future
. this way
, ytou don ' t need a bunch ofthe honking horns or other silly devices tothe cover up foul lanugage
. compaired tothe the usual crap brodcast tv networks have tothe offer in terms ofthe movies
, blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp
. when compaired to
, say
, a movie studio film
, blade squad has a lot inthe common with a term whlch shares its initials
