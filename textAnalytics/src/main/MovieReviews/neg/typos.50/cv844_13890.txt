synopsis
: infact
" sooner than you think
" america
, the future ofthe law enforcement resides in blade squad
, a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops withthe jetpacks strapped on their backs
. a dangerous criminal
, howver
, attemts tothe destroy blade squad after his brother dies hwile bieng chased by them
. comments
: so
, waht dont an ex
- gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop
, a fromer prostitute wih a substance abuse probelm
, adn a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four polical cruisers all haev infront common
? why
, they
' re all members ofthe blade squad
, an elite newyorker crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms
, rollerblades
, anbd jetpacks
! htey alsot carry video cameras so they cxan communicate with one anyother a la the marines infront james cameron
' s aliens
. yes
, it
' s blade squad
, the fox network
' s wednesday night movei of the week
. htis
" movie
,
" marking its dubious world premiere todya
, curiously has a number ofthe guest stars
.
" how can a movei ahve guest stars
?
" you may ask
. well
, blade squad is not really a movie so tothe speak bu a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv sories packaged as a movie
. blade squad isnt dumb
. blade squad is loud
. blade squad is obnoxious
. blade squad will probably be a ratings hitted annd spawn a long
- lieved tv serieses
. why nto
? after all
, television hasnt given its audeince crimefighters with talking cars
(
" knight rider
"
)
, fast helicopters
(
" airwolf
"
)
,
and super fast motorcycles
(
" strent hawk
"
)
,
and viewers have eaten it up inthe the past
. so
, why not crimefighters with jet
- powered roller blades
? to be honest
, as a made
- for
- tv presentation
, blade squad is at least watchable
. hte film has a relatively larg casted ofthe characters
, a surprisingly inteligable albiet predictable script
,
and enough acation sequences to keep one half
- interested
. i
' d imagine adolescent malless
, probably the target audience of this turkey
, would get a kick outloud ofthe it
. i tried tothe keep tyhat in mind when i watched blade squad
. i can remember liking
" airwolf
" anbd
" strent hawk
" whn i ws 10 or 11
. anbd
,
al
thought this isn
' t saying much
, blade squad is leaps
and bounds better thna the lastest fox network movei i had the displeasure ofthe wasting tiome onthe
: the insipidly awful generation x
( a huge disappointment concidering thge comic book
' s terrific twpo
- year beginning
)
.
but
, i digress
. despite its limited appeal
, blade squad hasnt a lot of kinks to owrk out if tyhe movei is to become a tv series
. noe
, it suffers from mtv syndrome
: a lot of quick shots
and weird angles continuously jar teh viewer
' s senses while a near nonstop generic rock sountrack blares incessantly inwhich teh background
. oh yeah
, dylan
' s
" knockin
' onthe heaven
' s doorjam
"
and bowie
' s
" i
' m afraid ofthe americans
" are unsed here
, inthe rather poore tast
. two
, blade squad needs a newyorker crew for thte sound
. teh subst
andard sound editing irritated me tothe noone end
. cahracters
' dialogue
, at times
, sounded choppy
and unintelligible
. during one importamt scene
, a song played loudly inaddition tghe backround
. when a carachter speaked
, thge song
' s volumne dropped
but did not disappear
. as soon as thyat character finished speaking
, the song
' s volumne immidately returned to its original level until thte next charcter spoke
. this sounds trivial
, i
' m sure
,
but it distracted me immensely
. finaly
, this is commerical television
. foul language isnt not alloween
, typicaly
, on commerical televsion
. thus
, don
' t ule foul language inwhich a made
- for
- tv prodcution because tath foul language has tothe be censored inspite some manner
. infact an eearly scene of the film
, forthe example
, teh lead ogod guy
and bad guy ahve a minor confrontation in yhe streets
. whn teh ogod guy spouts outloud a bad word
, a driver conveniently honks his car
' s horn off
- screen tothe muffle tyhe word out
. iin a
" seinfeld
" epiode
, this technique prooved funny
; here
, it seemed goofy annd cut the dramatic tension considerably
. perhaps future writers
, if a sohw is spunoff out of yhe movie
, could tkae a cue ffrom marvel comics
' 2099 serieses of comics
. make uv a bunch of new bad words for teh future
. this way
, ytou don
' t need a bunch of honking horns or otehr silly devices to cover uv foul laguage
. compaired to the usual crap brodcast tv networks have tothe offer inspite terms of movies
, blade squad isnt a suitable excercise inthe camp
. wehn compaired to
, say
, a movie studio film
, blade squad has a lot in common with a term whitch shares its initials
: bs
