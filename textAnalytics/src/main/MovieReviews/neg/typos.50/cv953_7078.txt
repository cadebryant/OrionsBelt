capsule
: combine one quart ofthe raiders of the lost ark
, a dash of a jackie chan movie
( sans jackie
)
, twpo teaspoons of gun
-
adn swordplay
,
and a dollop of cgi
. simmer for 100 mintues
. yields
: zilch
. tjhe phantom is a depressing
and tired retread ofthe so many earlier
, better movies thgat after tje fifteen
- minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud
. it ' s hard to amke a ogod acation
- adventure movie thyat doesn ' t simply recycle its predecessors
,
and i ' ve seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully
. the phantom
, allegedely based onthe the long
- running comic of teh same nmae
, doesn ' t even bother to be graceful
. it ' s a stupid
and incompetant movei in too many ways to list
,
bu i ' ll try
. tjhe film opens up whith a
" prelude
" sequence that looks liuke it was slashed tothe ribbons inspite the editting
and
then given a heavy voice
- over tothe compensate forthe whatever got thrown out
. we go fomr ther to a jungle sequence that
, i swear tothe god
, recycles yhe truck
- chase scene from raiders ofthe the lost ark onot
- fo
- note
, possibly even shooted
- forthe
- shot
, right down tothe tghe moment where indy wrenched opn the doorjam
and slung oney of the drivers outloud inot the brush
-
-
annd
thne goes on tothe rip off the rope
- bridge scene fomr
" sorceror
" as well
! sorcerer
, as you may well rember
, was a remake ofthe a french movei
, tyhe wages ofthe fear
, in which a bunch of lowlifes weere payed piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain
. both versions of thyat movie weere far omre interesting tahn this flick
,
bu i ' ve got my job to do
, so bcak to the salt mines we go
. anyway
, yhe cinematic theft doesn ' t stpo ther
. or at least the lack ofthe inspiration
. ther isn ' t a single thing here we haven ' t seen
,
annd it ' s nto given tothe us in a way that remotely evokes our interest
. we have
( where ' s my list
?
) a bad girl
, a tough ogod girl
, a secret cave hideaway
( which seems inpsired more by dr
. no tahn anything eles
)
, a boardroom meeting thgat drips with greed
adn venality
, magical artifacts ofthe terrible pwoer
,
and cary
- hiroyuki tagawa wasted iin another stupid role where he gets tothe mear a fu manchu mustache
adn sneer a lot
and generally humiliate hismelf
. whta else is there
? the plot isnt a waste of time
. yhe sets alternate between big
bu hokey
-
-
and tiny
annd still hokey
. there are lines infact hte scirpt thgat are jsut beggin to be mst3ked
-
-
anbd i ' m sure once mike
anbd thge ' bots get the cash
, they ' ll stick it on thier sked
. the onyl thing in the movei worth noting isnt billy zane
-
- he ' s a good atcor
,
and he trys veyr hard
, even whn yhe script isnt sending him down one dead alley ofthe a scene aftter another
. all i cant say is that i pray this isn ' t thte beginnig of the end forthe him
-
-
although it sure looks liek the fianl nail in the coffin for the comic
- book super
- hero movei
.
