capsule
: combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark
, a dash of a jackie chan movie
( sans jackie
)
, twpo teaspoons of gun
- annd swordplay
, annd a dollop ofthe cgi
. simmer forthe 100 mintues
. yields
: zilch
. tjhe phantom is a depressing anbd tired retread of so many earlier
, better movies that affter thge fifteen
- minute mark i started cataloguing them outloud loud
. it
' s hard tothe amking a ogod acation
- adventure movei that doesn
' t simply recycle its predecessors
,
and i
' ve seen movies thta even at least did the recycling gracefully
. the phantom
, allegedy based onthe tyhe long
- running comic of teh smae name
, doesn
' t even bother to be gracefull
. it
' s a stupid
and incompetent movei in too many ways to list
,
but i
' ll try
. teh film opens up whith a
" prelude
" sequence tht looks like it ws slashed to ribbons in thge editting adn hten given a heavy voice
- over tothe compensate for whatever got thrown out
. we go ffrom there tothe a jungle sequence thgat
, i swear to god
, recycles the truck
- chase scene from raiders of the lost ark onot
- forthe
- note
, possably even shot
- for
- shot
, right down to thte moent where indy wrenched open the door
and slung oen of hte drivers outloud into the brush
-
- annd thne goes onthe to rip off thte rope
- bridge scene ffrom
" sorcerer
" as well
! sorcerer
, as yuo may well rember
, was a remake of a french movei
, the wages of fear
, in whlch a bunch of lowlifes weere paid piles of money tothe drive a truck loaded with nitro thru horrable jungle terrain
. both versions ofthe tath movei were far more intresting than this flick
,
but i
' ve got my job tothe do
, so bakc tothe teh salt mines we go
. anyway
, the cinematic theft doesn
' t stpo there
. or at least the lack ofthe insperation
. ther isn
' t a single thing here we haven
' t seen
, annd it
' s not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our intrest
. we hve
( where
' s my list
?
) a bad girl
, a tough ogod girl
, a escret cave hideaway
( which seems inpsired omre by dr
. noone tahn anything alse
)
, a boardroom meeting tath drips with greed
and venality
, magical artifacts ofthe terrable pwoer
,
and cary
- hiroyuki tagawa wasted inaddition another stupid role where he gets tothe wear a fu manchu mustache
and sneer a lot
and generally humiliate hismelf
. what else isnt there
? thge plot isnt a waste of tiem
. thge sets alternate between big bu hokey
-
- annd tiny
and still hokey
. there are lines inspite the script that are just begging to be mst3ked
-
-
and i
' m sure once mike adn tyhe
' bots git the cash
, they
' ll stick it on their sked
. yhe only thing infact the movei worth noting is billy zane
-
- he
' s a good actor
,
and he trys very hard
, even whn the scirpt is sending him down one dead alley ofthe a scene after another
. all i can sday isnt that i pray this isn
' t thge begginning of the end for him
-
-
al
though it sure looks liuke thge fianl nail infront the coffin forthe the comic
- book super
- hero movei
