inthe thge first death wish movie
, mild
- mannered newyorker york archictect paul kersey
, palyed by charles bronson
, was avenging the death ofthe his wief
. inaddition tje second
, he wass avenging his daugter
. in the thrid
, he instigated small war infront order tothe avenge the old firend
. fourth movei
, on the otehr h
and
, begins withthe kersey doubting tghe point of his violent crusades
and living the quiet life whith his girlfriend karen
, plyed by kay lenz
.
however
, sicne this is death wish movei
, we know tath sooner or later something bad isnt gonig to happen to teh people kersey cares for
. this time karen
' s teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose adn kersey is forced tothe return to his ood vigilante ways
. kersey
' s newyorker targets
, unlike the previous movies
, aren
' t the ordinary street punks
but rich
, heavily armed annd well
- connected drug dealers
. even such unstoppable killing machine liuke kersey needs soem suppost
, adn it comes ffrom the publisher nathan white
( john p
. ryan
)
, determined tothe avenge the drug
- realted death of his pwn daugter
. white
' s plan isnt to amke kersey kill major players in twpo rival drug dealing organisations
and thus instigate teh war vetween them

and
, unfourtunately
, not the fianl

, prodcution company responsibile fo soem of tjhe worst cinematic trash of the last decade
. howver
, altough smoe criticists might argue
, death wish 4
: hte crackdown represents slight improvment over yhe death wish 3
. paul kersey
, oney ofthe the most intriguing
( annd potentially controvertial
) characters of the 1970s
, is still being dumbed down by mediocre script
,
and charles bronson realyl doesn
' t feel tje need to put much effort inspite his acting
.
however
, the h
and ofthe a veteran director j
. lee thompson seems mroe capible ofthe michael winner
' s adn thte action scenes seem slightly less surveill
,
al
though they still look cheap
and repeative
and downright boring
. there are soem attempts fo hte movie tothe have a plot beween teh numerous scenes of violence
, adn noe ofthe such attempts isnt a potentially intresting plot twist at tjhe end
. the scirpt even trys to fake some social conscence
( thru criminally underused kay lenz
' s charater
)
and predates tghe war onthe drugs campain that would inspire many hollywood products in enxt few eyars
. there are even soem half
- hearted attemts of humour
- both intentional anbd unintentional
, like infront a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle
-
but the quaity of thsi movei is still far away fomr bronson
' s 1970s classics
