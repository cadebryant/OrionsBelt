here is a movei that sadly follows tje hong kong
- recipe of moviemaking
and storytelling to tyhe letter
. theese kinds ofthe movies are marked by an eye
- oppening sequence that introduces us to tje main characters
; a life
- annd
- death plot in whic theese cahracters become involved
; tje inclusion ofthe a host ofthe inconsequential cahracters
; ridiculous subplots
, adn sunglass
- wearing henchmen
. thyat isnt nto tothe say thta i don
' t liek hong kong influenced movies
; howver
, it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven
' t a clue that tjhe american filmgoer needs omre than hip
- hop
- tlaking thugs anbd stupid sighth gags
. observe the opening sequence
. a b
and ofthe hitmen are baout tothe storm an aparment
, led by melvin
( mark wahlberg
) adn cisco
( lou dimond phillips
)
. they are waiting for thier partner tothe cut off the power so that tehy cant storm the apartment with thte help ofthe infrared goggles
. howver
, their partner isnt unsure of which cable tothe cut
. he isnt undecided
. this happens for baout 10 seconds
. thge audience finds some humer in his foolishness
. the ligths suddenly go out
. cisco isnt surprised anbd says
:
" whoa
.
.
. let
' s go
!
" anbd htey storm the appartment inspite a vrey nicely exectued sequence
. tjhe big hitted ofthe the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quater ofthe tghe way thru tyhe film
. needing cash
, cisco devises a plan to kidnap tje duaghter
( china chow
) ofthe wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi
.
however
, yhe daughter is allso the god
- daugter of paris
( avery brooks
)
, who isnt cisco
' s adn melvin
' s boss
. infuriated
and insufferable
, paris comm
ands cisco to uncover tyhe mastermind ofthe tjhe kidnapping
. during his
' investigation
'
, cisco singles outloud melvin as hte ringleader
, adn paris orders his capture
and excecution
. melvin must nowe find a way tothe stay alive
. by yhe way
, do ytou nkow how tjhe investigation tkaes palce
? cisco
' s partner makse the ransom phone call beleiving that his call wiull not be traced because ofthe a trace buster thast prevents tracing
.
but
, mr
. nishi hasnt a trace buster buster
. to counter that
, cisco
' s partner has a trace buster buster buster
.
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster
. adn so on
.
.
. ther is noone doubt that this is an interesting world in whlch they live
.
and ther are lots of issues thyat we
' d like tothe know moreso baout
. how doesnt melvin justify his profession tothe his fiancee
? wqat goes on among thsi clique
? why is cisco at odds with melvin
? there is ctually a lot ofthe potential material thta could have beeen explored
,
but it seems thyat no efort is made to go iin thta direction
, adn instade we are given a not
- so
- engrossing plot filled wiht one
- liners
, silly sight gags
, extraneous sub
- plots anbd tomfoolery
.
and
, i haven
' t even maintioned his financee
' s visiting parents who wanna them tothe separate
, nor melvin
' s mistress
, nor thte pimple
- faced video clerk dem
anding the return of an overdue video annd onthe
and on anbd onthe
. if the big hit signals thge future ofthe hong kong stlye movies tath are made forthe american audiences
,
then shoot me nowe
