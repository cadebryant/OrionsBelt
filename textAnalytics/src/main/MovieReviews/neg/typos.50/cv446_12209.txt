here isnt a movie that sadly follows tje hong kong
- recipe ofthe moviemaking
annd storytelling to the letter
. theese kinds of movies are maked by an eye
- opening sequence tht introduces us to the main charachters
; a life
-
and
- death plot in which these cahracters become involved
; the inclusion of a host ofthe inconsequential characters
; rediculous subplots
,
and sunglass
- wearing henchmen
. that is not to say that i don ' t like hong kong influented movies
;
howver
, it is qutie obvious thta theese moviemakers haven ' t a clue tath yhe american filmgoer needs moreso than hip
- hop
- talking thugs
adn stupid sight gags
. observe tghe opening sequence
. a band of hitmen are baout to storm an apartment
, led by melvin
( mark wahlberg
)
annd cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
. tehy are waiting forthe thier partner tothe cutted off teh pwoer so thast they cin storm the apartment wiht tjhe help ofthe infrared goggles
.
however
, theri partner is unsure of which cable to cut
. he isnt undecided
. htis happens for about 10 seconds
. the audiance finds smoe humor in his foolishness
. tghe lights suddenly go outloud
. cisco is surprised
annd says
:
" whoa
.
.
. let ' s go
!
"
anbd they storm thge appartmant inspite a very nicely exectued sequence
. hte big hitted ofthe the title refers to a kidnapping tht happens a quarter ofthe tghe way through the film
. needing cash
, cisco devises a plan tothe kidnap tghe daughter
( china chow
) of wealthy japanis industrialist jiro nishi
.
howver
, tghe daughter is aslo teh god
- daughter ofthe paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is cisco ' s
and melvin ' s boss
. infuriated
adn insufferable
, paris commands cisco to uncover tyhe mastermind of the kidnapping
. druing his ' investigation '
, cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader
,
and paris orders his capture
annd excecution
. melvin must now fidn a way to stay alive
. by the way
, dont ytou nkwo how tyhe investigation takes place
? cisco ' s partner makes thte ransom phone call beleiving that his call will nto be traced becuase ofthe a trace buster tath prevents tracing
.
bu
, mr
. nishi hasnt a trace buster buster
. to counter taht
, cisco ' s partner hasnt a trace buster buster buster
.
but nishi hasnt a trace buster buster buster buster
.
annd so onthe
.
.
. there isnt noone doubt taht this is an interesting world in wich they live
.
and htere are lots ofthe issues that we ' d like tothe knwo more baout
. how does melvin justify his proffesion tothe his fiancee
? what goes onthe among this clique
? why is cisco at odds iwth melvin
? ther isnt acually a lot ofthe potential material that could hve beeen explored
,
bu it seems tath noone efford isnt made to go in that direction
,
annd instead we are given a not
- so
- engrossing plot filled wih noe
- liners
, silly sight gags
, extraneous sub
- plots
and tomfoolery
.
and
, i haven ' t even mentioned his financee ' s visiting parents who watn them tothe seprate
, nor melvin ' s mistress
, nor yhe pimple
- faced video clerk demanding teh return ofthe an overdue video
adn on
and onthe
adn onthe
. if the big hit signals tje future ofthe hong kong stlye movies tht are made for american audiences
,
hten shoot me now
