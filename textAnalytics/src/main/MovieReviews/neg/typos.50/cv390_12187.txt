, recreates the dead paris
. comments
: virtual siduction
, executive produced by roger corman
and lance h
. robbins
, serves as a cheaply
- made precursor tothe strange days
, a far superior film
. both movies deel withthe desperate men who have trouble relating to theri currrent lovers becouse htey are
( ab
) useing technology tothe be with fromer lovers
( iin strange dyas
, tjhe technology utilized recoreded dreams rather than virtal reality
)
. interestingly
, both films allso take place a cuple of years ffrom now during tyhe turn ofthe the new millenium
,
though strange days uses the setting far more effectively
. this exemplifies yhe problem with virtual siduction
. it
' s not bad fo what it isnt
: low
- budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virutal reality
. unfortunatly
, it
' s been done befor
and since in much better films
, a fatc which ultimately leaves tje sci
- fi fan bored by thsi movei
. virutal seduction hasnt many faults
( oen of them is the fatc that the video inexplicably has its pwn trailer befoer it beigns
)
. the film
' s script explores the possiblities ofthe virtural reality interestingly at frist
,
but its treatment of thte subject matter gets heavy
- h
anded adn wooden as the movie progresses
. many imporatnt scenes seem too dark
; the lighting sould have beeen improved significantly
. tghe casted
, a collection ofthe veteran b
- movie actors
and sitcom regulars
, do only a mediocre job in thier roles
. jeff fahey
, of the orginal lawnmower man
, convincingly
,
though unenergetically
, plays teh lead carachter
. carrie genzel plays paris
, tyhe vr lover
,
but ami dolenz
, as the currrent lveo interst
, seems liek a much more intresting
and attractive charactor wih a careing perosnality
, whihc doesn
' t lend creedence to the film
' s premise
. meschach taylor
, ofthe tje once popular desigining women sitcom
, adequately plays a scientist wokring onthe the project
,
but his performance isn
' t something to write home about either
. virtual seduction isnt one ofthe those harmless movies tothe which ytou could dont some light manual labor anbd nto mind having it onthe infront tjhe backround
. inwhich other words
, one could fold laundry while glancing uv at it eveyr now adn hten
, bu it
' s rather boring tothe just sit
and watch
. tje movei isnt surprizingly nto as voilent as one expects ffrom b
- movies in this genre
,
but it is still an adult r
- rated film due to sexual situations
and a suicide attempt
. this trukey
, ultimately
, isn
' t awful
,
but it
' s not particularly intresting or unique eather
. don
' t be seduced into watching this movie unless you
' ve got several loads ofthe laundry
and nothing eles tothe watch
.
