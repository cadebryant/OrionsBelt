i didn
' t come into city of angels expecting greatness
. i
' ve never seen wim wenders
' wings of desire
, thge clasic movei apon which city is loosly based
.
then again
, i ahve seen anough stries which are based apon a similar plot device
, witht the littel mermaid
( both teh disney verison
and thte orignal folktale
) bieng amonth them
, that i hadnt soem high expectations about tje possibile power such a story ofthe impossible lvoe can hold
. unfortunately
, city of angels ended uv fulfilling fewd of them
. the plot
, forthe those that couldn
' t tell from the previews
, revolves aroud tjhe angel seth
, palyed wiht an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage
, who
, in thge midst ofthe his angelic duties
, falls in love withthe a heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan in her most endearing performance usance wehn harry met sally
)
. of course
, his bieng an angel prevents him fomr donig much baout his loev except appearing at r
andom times to talk tothe her
, watch her buy groceries
, only tothe disappear in the blink ofthe an eye
. thier lvoe must reamain unrequited unless seth decides to amking the ulitmate sacrifice anbd become human
. useing this framework as a jumping
- off point
, the movie attemts tothe veer through some hevy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire
, the joys of being human
,
and teh defiintion of perfection
. the frist half ofthe teh movei suceeds on most points
. cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role ofthe an angel who doesn
' t nkwo feelings so can
' t raelly express
, preventing the chracter ofthe seth fomr getting boring dispite his limited reprtoire of intent looks
and hang
- dog expressions
. unfortunatley
, cage tkaes the intensity too far sometimes
, annd thne seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive
. as maggie
, ryan manages tothe be convincing as a heart surgeon who hasnt trouble coming tothe terms with her having lost a patient onthe the operating tabl dispite having done everthing right
. her beauty
, unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss
, is mature
, inteligent
,
and winning
. likewise
, smoe intresting ideas float aroud at yhe beginning of the film
. wehn the camera pans through trafic jams annd libraries
and we get to hear tje
thoughts ofthe thge r
andom peple who flash acros the screen
, the audience experiences a littel of what it must be like to be an angel
. the beatiful camera wrok
, shooting down onto the hectic world ofthe los angeles ffrom the improbable perches of the angels
, also gives us a sense of thte unique wonder angels feel
. the film begins to lose its way
,
though
, wehn hte focuse tightens mroe
and more on seth
and maggie
. the gr
and
, angelic prespective gets lost
, except fo smoe idly tossed lines baout yhe increadible beauty ofthe tghe world through an angel
' s eyes
. tje movei devolves inot an examination ofthe how seth cin
' t feel the world or
, more importantly
, he can
' t efel maggie
: he can
' t smell her hair
, efel her touch
, or taste thte pears she eats
. tihs chanage in focuse attemts to capture the audeince inspite seth
' s intense longing
,
but in doing so
, the conflict dissappears
. if he wnats maggie so badly
, thn why doesn
' t her just amke the leap anbd become human
? affter all
, what
' s so great baout being an ange
? sure
, ytou get tothe sit on marlboro signs
, bu what
' s that compaired tothe getting tothe be withthe meg ryan
?
and fomr there
, once thge yearning hasnt been estalbished anbd tjhe romantic denouement must occur
, it
' s all downhill
. the philosophy becomes hevy
- h
anded
, yhe dialogue pedestrain when it trys tothe be deep
, annd the plot twists simply attemp to yank a few moreso tears inot the audeince
' s hankie
. it
' s the last thirty mintues of the movie
, thn
, thgat wrecks thte film
. i feel like tjhe writter
, by pulling out all teh melodramatic stops
, has robbed me ofthe what coudl hvae beeen a genuinely powerfull movie experience on both the rumatic anbd the phylosophical levle
. i cameback outloud feeling robbed
, seing so much possiblility inaddition a film becomeing nothing
. i coudl go on longer
, bu i don
' t watn to
" ruin
" thge end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices tyhe film relies onthe
. city ofthe angels
, thne
, is a paradox
. it
' s a well
- acted
( particulraly look forthe dennis franz cutting againnst tipe
- casting as a happy
- go
- lucky falled angel
)
, well
- filmed
,
and based on a wonderful idea
. all these possibilities
,
though
, are wqat amking the film so unredeemable whn the closing credits come uv
.
