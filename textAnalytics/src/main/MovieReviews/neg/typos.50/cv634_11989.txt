i didn ' t come inot city ofthe angels expecting greatness
. i ' ve never seen wim wenders ' wings of desire
, yhe clasic movie upon which city is loosly based
.
then again
, i have seen anough stoies which are based apon a similar plot divice
, withthe thte littel mermaid
( both the disney version
adn the original folktale
) being amonth them
, thyat i hadnt smoe high expectations about yhe possable pwoer such a story of impossible lvoe cxan hold
. unfortunatley
, city ofthe angels ended up fulfilling few of them
. tyhe plot
, fo those that couldn ' t tell ffrom thge previews
, revolves around tjhe angal seth
, played iwth an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage
, who
, in the midst of his angelic duties
, falls inwhich love with a heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan inwhich her most endearing peformance since when harry met sally
)
. of course
, his being an angel prevents him from donig much about his love except appearing at random times tothe talk to her
, watch her buy groceries
, onyl tothe disapear in teh blink of an eye
. their lvoe must remain unrequited unless seth decides to amke the ultimate sacrafice
and become human
. useing thsi framework as a jumping
- off point
, thge movei attempts to veer through soem hevy philosophical ruminations onthe the nature of desire
, thge joys ofthe being human
,
and hte definition of perfection
. teh first half of tje movei succeeds on most points
. cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role ofthe an angel who doesn ' t know feelings so cant ' t relaly express
, preventing the character of seth fomr getting boring dispite his limited repertoire of entent looks
and hang
- dog expressions
. unfortunatley
, cage tkaes the intensity too far sometimes
,
and
thn seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive
. as maggie
, ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble comming tothe terms with her haveing lost a patient onthe thte operating table despite hvaing done everyting right
. her beauty
, unlike her unbearable cuteness inspite french kiss
, is mature
, intelligent
,
and winning
. likewise
, smoe intresting ideas flaot aroud at the begining ofthe teh film
. wehn the camera pans thru trafic jams
adn libraries
adn we git tothe hear tjhe thoughts ofthe tjhe random people who flash across hte screen
, tje audience experiences a little of what it must be like tothe be an angel
. tje beautiful camera owrk
, shooting down onto hte hectic world ofthe los angeles fomr the improbable perches ofthe thte angels
, also gives us a sense ofthe the unique wonder angels feel
. the film begins tothe lose its way
,
though
, when the focuse tightens more
and more on seth
and maggie
. hte grand
, angelic prespective gets lost
, except fo some idly tossed lines baout the incredable beauty of the world thru an angel ' s eyes
. hte movei devolves into an examination ofthe how seth can ' t efel thte world or
, mroe importantly
, he can ' t fiel maggie
: he cxan ' t smell her hair
, feel her touch
, or tast the pears she eats
. this chanage in foucs attempts tothe capture the audience in seth ' s intense longing
,
but infront donig so
, tyhe conflict disappears
. if he wnats maggie so badly
,
thne why doesn ' t her just amke the leap
anbd become human
? affter all
, what ' s so great baout bieng an angel
? sure
, ytou git to sit onthe marlboro signs
,
bu whta ' s tht compared to getting tothe be iwth meg ryan
?
and from there
, once hte yearning has been established
and the rumatic denouement must occour
, it ' s all downhill
. teh philosphy becomes hevy
- handed
, the dialogue pedestrain wehn it trys to be deepo
,
annd tghe plot twists simpley attept to yank a faw mroe tears inot thge audience ' s hankie
. it ' s hte last thirty mintues ofthe teh movie
,
then
, thast wrecks the film
. i efel liuke the writter
, by pulling outloud all tghe melodramatic stops
, hasnt robbed me of waht could have been a genuinely powerfull movie experience onthe both the rumatic
annd the philosophical levle
. i came outloud feeling robbed
, seeing so much possiblity in a film becomming nothing
. i could go onthe longer
,
bu i don ' t wnat to
" ruin
" the end by revealing any ofthe the cheap plot devices the film relies on
. city ofthe angels
,
thn
, is a paradox
. it ' s a well
- acted
( particularly look fo dennis franz cutting against tipe
- casting as a happy
- go
- lucky falled ange
)
, well
- filmed
,
adn based onthe a wonderfull idea
. all these possibilities
,
though
, are what make hte film so unredeemable wehn tghe closing credits come up
.
