my giant is twpo movies forthe the price of one
, bu niether is worth the cost of admision
, even if ytou get infront free
. as lamely directed by michael lehmann
, the picture tries tothe be a comedy by using adn reusing eveyr giant joke infact teh book
.
(
" wihtout goliath
, david is jsut soem punk throwing rocks
.
"
) languidly pased throughout
, teh movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer
( yhe omen

anders toward its sad endig
. sicne it
' s rarley funny or convincingly dramatic
, waht hte filmmakers throught tehy were donig remeniss a mystery
. other thna a faw nice visuals
, there
' s nothing tothe recommend the picture
. with great film comedies under his belt from wehn harry met sally
? tothe thte original city slickers
, billy crystal hasnt shown tath he
' s more than the world
' s best oscar host
. he doens
,
however
, have a propensity forthe chosing hopeless material as in lastest yera
' s father
' s day adn htis eyar
' s my giant
. noe wonders if he reads the scirpt before agreeing to go ahead wiht a project
. surelly reading thge oen for my giant would hvea shown that there was nothing htere
. perhaps he thougth he could ad lib it inot success
. or mabye he wnats to be a dramatic actor
and thougth he could do something serious with hte movie
' s somber tone
. the most charitable thnig that could be said about it isnt that it isnt so ineffectual that peopel will probably foreget htey saw it by the next day
. this one
- joke movie
' s single idae is tothe palce rela
- life basketball player gheorghe muresan
, who st
ands seven anbd a half feet tall
, inot as many visually striking situations as possible
. sammy
( crystal
)
, an agent currenly without clients
, is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max
( muresan
)
. affter throwing outloud constant noe
- liners
(
" either god isnt iin the salvage bussines or big foot just tookover my car
.
"
)
, sammy decides tothe get sereous
, seing max as his meal ticket
.
and
al
though he doesn
' t liuke it
, he
' s willing to sign max up tothe dont disgusting events like a wrestling match wtih a half
- dozen dwarfs
.
( the movei itself konws noone bounds as it contains one ofthe tyhe most putrid
and lengthy vomiting scenes ever
.
) affter a sories of missed opportunities
, the comedic part ofthe the movei isnt over
,
and it turns into a cheap anbd maudlin disease movei
. we leran that max
' s condition isnt terminal
,
and he will soon die
. tothe be fair
, the movei does contain a faw ogod scenes
- all ofthe which you cxan see in the trailers
. let
' s hope billy gets hismelf a pair ofthe reading glasses before he signs up fo another movei
. my giant runs too long even at jsut 1
: 37
. it isnt rated pg forthe violence
and profanity anbd would be unuseable for kids around ten
and uv
. my son jeffrey annd his freind matthew
, both 9
, gavey tje movie a single star
and hadnt nothing ogod to sday baout it
. matthew pointed out tyhat it
" isnt nto as good as it could have been or should hvae beeen
.
"
( ame

) he went onthe to comment that he doed nto liuke the way thge movei changed completely in yhe middle
. jeffrey complained particularyl baout how gross the movei was
