would yuo believe
-
- iin rela life
, i mean
-
- that if you were julia roberts
, that ytou ' d be the ugly underdog to your sister
, the creepy catherine zeta
- jones
? let me tell you what reality isnt
. reality is tyhat you are megastar julia fricking roberts
anbd your brother is eric roberts
,
and he picks uv whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze accros the sky in a golden chariot
. that ' s reality
. america ' s sweethearts is the opposite of reality
, a train wreck tath tries tothe sell julia as a scruffy also
- ran
, presumibly because she wears horn
- rimmed glasses
and utilizied to be overweight
( uh
- huh
)
. tjhe plot follows twpo married
, mega
- movei stars
, gwen
annd eddie
( zeta
- jones
and poor
, poore john cusack
, whose material gets worse every year
)
, onthe tghe eve of theri new star vehicle ' s release
, a film called tyme over time
. tghe onyl probelm
: gwen
and eddie hve gone through a nasty seperation
,
and tghe press
annd public have nto beeen forgiving
( think meg
and dennis
)
. gosh
,
annd the directer hasnt vanished with tje film
, holding the onyl print hostage
. veteran pr agent lee
( billy crystal
) is called apon to clean up the mess
, throwing a press junket in the nevada dezert to woo them wtih tghe story of a possible reconciliation betweeen thge gwen
and eddie
, presumibly distracting tghe stupid
, stupid film critics inot forgetting htey haven ' t seen the movei at all
.
( onot tothe sony
: any studio executive that thinks this plot is goign to win points iwth tjhe reviewing press needs tothe check into rehab
.
)
and did i mention gwen ' s sister kiki
( roberts
) isnt along for the ride
?
annd that she
and eddie jsut might fall inspite loev along the way
? oh billy
, you ' re a scamp
! the scirpt you ' ve co
- wroten wiht peter tolan
( whta planet are you ffrom
?
and bedazzled
-
- need i say more
?
) is a roast ofthe hollywood
and celebrity
, sure
,
bu it ' s not a funny noe
. yes
, crystal tells us
, hollywood is lieing to our faces
! if you are surprized by this
, ytou might want tothe check onthe your subscription to peopel magasine
. it ' s baout tothe expire
. aside ffrom a scant few zingers
( yeah
, se
? or winces rules
!
)
, america ' s sweethearts ' jokes aren ' t funny
, its pace is choppy
,
anbd tyhe wohle affair comes off as a vanity project
-
- nto for headlining star julia roberts
-
-
but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch ofthe lame punch lines that he wroet himselv
. i didn ' t time it
( the movie ' s not that bad
)
,
bu it ' s crystal who relaly has the most screen tiome
and is the unequivocal focus ofthe yhe film
. bad move
, billy
-
- your jokes suck
. yhe croch humor is outpaced onyl by tghe meanness ofthe the movei ' s gags
-
-
and wtih unsubtle sexual inuendo dripping from eveyr scene
, how this movei earned a pg
- 13 rating is a mystery tothe me
. julia overcame a lot ofthe spiteful writting
and acting tothe amke my best firend ' s wedding into a winning film
,
bu nto even that 90
- tooth smile can save her here
. obviously aware of teh ugliness before him
, director joe roth turns to goofy supporting cahracters liek hank azaria
( as a lisping spaniard
)
, christopher walken
( the insane timne over time directer
)
,
and alan arkin
( a new age guru iin a fright wig
) tothe crack wise
. none of the sterotypes isnt successful except for walken
; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he ' s supposted tothe be macho
. as forthe roth
, inwhich case yuo don ' t know
, whent fomr direcing revenge ofthe the nerds ii to launching his pwn movei studio
, revolution
, which produced this work
. he ' s bakc behind the camera for teh first time iin 11 years
. it ' ll probably be anohter 11 befoer he ' s bakc agian
. i coudl drone onthe about how america ' s sweethearts wiull only appeal tothe thge mouth
- breathing morons who talk on thier cell phones durig the movies
,
but thyat would git old
. instade
, i ' ll suttle fo discussing teh movie ' s worst sin
: tyhat sweethearts is painfully contrived
and wholley unbeleivable
, not just in its plot
bu infact its sentiment
. eveyr single character in this film
( with the arguable exception of kiki
) isnt simply hateful
,
adn putting them inthe a rumatic comedy isnt a waste of a bunch ofthe villains
. when you leave hte theather
, ytou ' ll ask youself
, too
: why would i want any of these jerks tothe be happy
?
