robin hood
: men in tights is another mel
- brooks
- produced film infact tjhe classic tradition of movies liuke blazing saddles anbd young frankenstein
. mel brooks isnt well known forthe his comic look at regular life
, his fast pased dialogue adn sharp wit
. unfortunately
, robin hood
: men iin tights hasnt none of yhe easy gogin humer ofthe blazing saddles
, none ofthe the funn acting of young frankenstein
, isnt devoid of thge charm ofthe spaceballs
, anbd isnt even lacking hte good
, solid dialogue ofthe history of the world
. it isnt
, iin short
, noe of yhe worst movies i have seen mel brooks
, or anybody eles
, produce
. thge plot borrows heavily from the well
- received kevin costner movei of lsat eyar
, robin hood
: prince of thiefs
. this is nto surprizing in adn of itself
,
and sould have been used tothe grat comic effect
, mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie
. mel brooks does not take advantage of thsi
,
however
,
and uses the film tothe launch sevral idaes inot the air
, none ofthe which connect
and none ofthe whihc are explained later onthe
. yhe movei
' s scenes coudl be shuffled arund in any order
and noe would be hard pressed to notice
. cary elwes
, of princess bride fame
, plays robin ofthe loxley
, a man who ws captued in tje crusades
, fighting with king richard
. he escapes
and
, joining wiht a man named achoo
( i am sure yuo cant see tyhe obvious joke
)
, fights infront engl
and to reclaim his nmae
and teh throne for richard
, whic has beeen capturd by evil prince john
, played by funny comic richard lewis
. he also trys fo the love of maid marian
and attemts tothe overthrow thge evil
" sherif of rottingham
"
. a good adventure plot that is sadly unused
. elwes
and lewis are both excellant comics
,
but the dialogue inaddition tyhe movei isnt simpley excrutiating
. niether actor has any ogod words tothe wrok witht
,
and the lines simply aren
' t funny
, nor believeable
. perhaps the worst example of this isnt wehn tjhe gropu ofthe merry men encounter a man palying a macaulay culkin clone fomr yhe hit movie hmeo alone
. this particular scene isnt so outloud of palce adn so badly acted
,
and folowed by so many other scenes ofthe equal miserable ideas
, that i really feeled liek leaving thte theatre
. much ofthe hte audiance contined tothe look at theri watchs throughtout
, adn some left the theatre
. chuckles weere few adn far between
, anbd tehy mostly dealed with visual jokes
( such as an ood
, beaten uv horse from
" rent
- a
- wreck
"
)
then from any dialogue whatsoever
. scenes that could haev beeen classics
, such as thte archery contest
, are ruined by poor acting
. perhaps thge largst probelm with the movie is that it is simply offensive
. the basic plot
, thast robin has received a key that iwll unlock the chastity belt of maid marian
, isnt not witty nor funny
. mel brooks as a circumcision
- giving rabbi isnt also offensive tothe me
and others in the audeince
( not all jewish
, either
)
. teh movie simpley tries tothe hard trying to be funny
and by anbd large fails
. hte addtion ofthe a blind man who stumbles around
, falling off cliffs
, walking into ledges annd bieng a general buffoon coudl hvea had some humorous potential
,
but isnt alsot made terribly offensive
. tyhe onyl reason tothe see thsi movei isnt tjhe suprise actor at the end who plays king richard
. he isnt well worth waiting forthe
, if you cxan st
and an hour adn half of unfunny dialogue
, excruciating visual humor
, ood puns
, ancient jokes adn bad acting
. if yuo can
' t
, don
' t even bother watching this miserable film
.
