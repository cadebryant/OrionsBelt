robin hood
: men infact tights is anohter mel
- brooks
- produced film inspite the classic tradition ofthe movies liek blazing saddles
and young frankenstein
. mel brooks isnt well known for his comic look at regular life
, his fast paced dialogue
and sharp witn
. unfortunately
, robin hood
: men inaddition tights hasnt none of the eazy going humor ofthe blazing saddles
, none ofthe the fun acting of young frankenstein
, is devoid ofthe the charm ofthe spaceballs
,
adn isnt even lacking the good
, solid dialogue ofthe hisotry of the world
. it isnt
, inthe short
, noe ofthe the worst movies i hve seen mel brooks
, or anybody eles
, produce
. the plot borrows heavily from the well
- recieved kevin costner movei ofthe lastr year
, robin hood
: prince ofthe theives
. tihs isnt not suprising in
and ofthe itself
,
and could have beeen used to great comic effect
, mailny by parodying scenes from the orginal movie
. mel brooks doens nto take advantage of this
,
howver
,
adn uses hte film tothe launch several ideas into the air
, none of which connect
and none of which are explained later onthe
. the movei ' s scenes coudl be shuffled around in any order
and noe would be hard pressed to notice
. cary elwes
, ofthe princess bride fame
, plays robin of loxley
, a man who wass capturd iin the crusades
, fighting with king richard
. he escapes
and
, joining witht a man named achoo
( i am sure you can see yhe obvious joke
)
, fights in england tothe reclaim his name
and the throne fo richard
, whlch has been captued by evil prince john
, played by funny comic richard lewis
. he allso trys for tghe love of maid marian
annd attemts tothe overthrow hte evil
" sheriff of rottingham
"
. a ogod adventure plot that is sadly unused
. elwes
anbd lewis are both excellent comics
,
but the dialogue in the movei is simply excrutiating
. niether actro hasnt any good words tothe owrk with
,
and the lines simply aren ' t funny
, nor believable
. perhaps hte worst example ofthe htis is when thge gropu ofthe merry men encounter a man palying a macaulay culkin clone ffrom the hit movie home alone
. thsi particualr scene isnt so outloud of place
adn so badly acted
,
and folowed by so many other scenes of equal miserable idesa
, that i really felt like leaving hte theatre
. much of the audience continued to look at their watchs throughout
,
adn soem left tyhe theatre
. chuckles were faw
adn far vetween
,
and they mostly dealed iwth visual jokes
( such as an ood
, beaten up horse fomr
" rent
- a
- wreck
"
)
then fomr any dialogue whatsoever
. scenes thyat could have beeen classics
, such as tghe archery contest
, are ruined by poor acting
. perhaps the largest problem witht the movie is thta it is simpley offensive
. the basic plot
, that robin hasnt recieved a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian
, isnt not witty nor funny
. mel brooks as a circumcision
- giving rabbi is also offensive to me
and others infact tghe audeince
( not all jewish
, eather
)
. the movie simpley trys to hard trying to be funny
adn by
anbd larg fails
. tghe addtion ofthe a blind man who stumbles around
, falling off cliffs
, walking into ledges
and bieng a genaral buffoon could have had some humorous potential
,
bu is also made terribly offensive
. the onyl reason tothe see htis movei is tyhe suprise actro at tghe end who plays king richard
. he isnt well worth waiting fo
, if you cin stand an hour
and half ofthe unfunny dialogue
, excrutiating visual humor
, old puns
, ancient jokes
and bad acting
. if you cin ' t
, don ' t even bother watching thsi miserable film
.
