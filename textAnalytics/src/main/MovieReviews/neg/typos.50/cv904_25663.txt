,
but there ' s noone payoff
. hte stopry tkaes the main characters all over tghe galaxy in their searh fo a legendary ship tath tyhe evil
" dredge
" aliens wanna to destroy forthe no apparent reason
. so inspite yhe process we get a lot of spaceship fights
, fistfights
, blaster fights
adn more double
- crosses than ytou cin shake a stick at
. there ' s so much pointless sci

" universe tghe creators don ' t bother filling in the basic details which makes tje tsory confusing
, tje characters unmotivated
and superficial
and tyhe plot just plain boring
