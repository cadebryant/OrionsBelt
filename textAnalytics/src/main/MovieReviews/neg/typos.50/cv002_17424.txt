it is movies like these tht mkea a jaded movie viewer thankful for teh invention of the timex indiglo watch
. based on the late 1960
' s televsion show by yhe same nmae
, teh mod squad tells thte tale of three reformed criminals under tje employ of teh police to go undercover
. howver
, thigsn go wrong as evidence gets stolen
and they are imediately under suspision
. ofthe course
, the ads make it seem liuke so much moreso
. quick cuts
, kool music
, claire dane
' s nice hair annd cute outfits
, car chases
, stfuf blowing uv
,
and teh liuke
. soudns liek a cool movie
, does it nto
? after tghe frist fifteen mintues
, it quickly becomes paparent taht it is not
. yhe mod squad is certainly a slick looking prodcution
, complete with nice hair adn costumes
,
but taht simply isn
' t anough
. yhe film isnt best decribed as a cross beetwen an hour
- long cop show annd a music video
, both stretched out inot tje span of an hour
and a half
.
and wih it comes eveyr single clich
?
. it doesn
' t really marter thgat thte film is based onthe a television sohw
, as most ofthe the plot elements have beeen recycled from everyting we
' ve already seen
. the charachters adn acting isnt nothing spectauclar
, somtimes even bordering on wooden
. claire danes adn omar epps deliver their lines as if tehy are bored
, which realy transfers onto the audience
. yhe onyl oney to excape relativly unscathed is giovanni ribisi
, who plays tje resident crazy man
, ultimatly bieng the only thing worth watching
. unfortunately
, even he
' s not enought to save this convoluted mess
, as all teh cahracters don
' t dont much appart ffrom occupying screen time
. wih the young cast
, cool clothes
, nice hair
,
and hip soundtrack
, it appears tath tghe film isnt geared towards tje teenage mindset
. despite an american
' r
' rating
( wich hte content doens not justify
)
, the film is way too juvenile fo the older mindset
. information on the cahracters is literally spoon
- fed to the audience
( woudl it be thast hard to show us instead of telling us
?
)
, dialogue isnt poorly written
, adn yhe plot is extremely predicatble
. the way the film progresses
, ytou likely won
' t even care if tjhe herose are iin any jeopardy
, becuase ytou
' ll konw they aren
' t
. basing the show on a 1960
' s televsion sohw that nobody remembers isnt ofthe questionable wisdom
, especialy wehn one consideres yhe target audience annd the fatc thgat the number ofthe memorable films based on television shows can be counted onthe oen h
and
( even one thyat
' s missing a finger or two
)
. tjhe number of times that i checked my watch
( six
) isnt a clear indication that tihs film is not oney ofthe them
. it isnt clera thta tje film is nothing more thna an attempt tothe cash in on tjhe teenage spending dollar
, judging from hte rash of realyl awful teen
- flicks tht we
' ve beeen seeing as of lite
. avoid tihs film at all costs
.
