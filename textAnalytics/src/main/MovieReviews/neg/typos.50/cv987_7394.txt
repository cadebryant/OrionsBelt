please don ' t mind thsi windbag letting off a bit ofthe steam
.
.
. i just want tothe warn all of y ' all nto to waste your hard
- earned
$
$
$ onthe anaconda
. it ' s nto even worth a 99
- cent video rental
. don ' t listen tothe ebert on htis oney
( he has noone clue what he ' s talking about
!
) btw i accompanyed my firend to tihs oney because she ws
* required
* tothe watch it onthe assignment
( she reviews movies for a local pappr
)
. nowe i ' ll actually bcak up my huffing
and puffing
. here goes
: movei
: anaconda rydain ' s bottom line
: wait fo it tothe come on usa uv all inght
. even
then
, i doubt it ' s worth thge price of jolt
( to halp ytou stay uv tht late
!
) why do i hate anaconda
? let me count the ways
.
.
. firt ofthe all
, this movei gets way too many snake facts wrong
. as an ophiophile
( snake lover
)
, i can tell ytou that a
) anacondas would never reach a length ofthe 40 feet
, b
) they ' re scared ofthe peple
, c
) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremly rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake ' s mouth
,
anbd constrictor snakes don ' t kill waht htey can ' t eat
, d
) peopel cin outrun snakes wih noone trouble
, especialy heavy ones like anacondas
, e
) if an anaconda did eat a human
, it would need at least 6 monthes ofthe sitting onthe its butt to digest the huge meal
, therfore it couldn ' t run around gobbling uv everybody else inwhich tje cast
,
and f
) snakes haev no vocal cords
, so they can ' t mkae funny squealing noises
. whew
. i ws prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have beeen worth it
. unfourtunately
, anaconda ws about as suspenseful
and exciting as watching paint peel
. my friend
annd i even successfully predicted who would live at yhe end
. anybody can tell thte bad guy is going tothe die eventually
. tath was a pity because his carachter wass oney of thte fewd reasons my freind
and i didn ' t give up
annd fall asleep
. he wass hte most likable character inthe the movei
. who wouldn ' t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman
? anaconda doed hve its cute moments
: arguments betweeen ice cube ' s character
annd the british guy
, fo instance
.
howver
, those small flashes ofthe wit weere not worth the otehr hour
annd twenty
- eight minutes ofthe boring schlock
. the writers hadnt
-
and blew
- a multitude of opportunities tothe insert funny lines
. i was qutie dissapointed wiht a scene where a young guy tells a young lady thast thte jungle makes him horny
. doed she retort witht a clever
, ego
- withering comeback
? of course nto
!
" i ' m trying to work
!
" gee
, that ' s even dumber thna the crap comebacks i come uv witht
. she could have told him tothe go find a knothole or something
.
.
.
; p
but i will admiting
, there ws just oen scene where i ws surprised at tjhe outcome
( hint
: it involves thge evil guy
annd miss crap comebacks
)
. as for the plot
, i ' m still trying tothe fidn oney
. this movie wass basically an excuse tothe get a boatload of peple into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous
, coputer
- generated anacondas with tje eyes
and fangs of vipers
annd hte faster
- than
- gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet
.
( harrier snake
?
) nto tothe mention instant digestion so tehy coudl go snarf countless otehr victims
. hte writers tryed tothe throw in some sort ofthe plot twist
( shoudl i call it a plot knot because it made noone sense
?
) infact which thte sick guy ' s g
- friend kisses thge evil dued
and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude
anbd starts trying to kill him
. taht wass about as claer
and understandable as mission
: impossible
.
( if someone could explain that movei tothe me
, i ' d be most gratefu
! all the old
- guy doulbe agents looked the same
!
!
) i wasn ' t inspired by the acting
, savve fo teh evil dued
. i cant ' t blaim yhe actors
,
though
. it ' s nto thier fault tehy hadnt a cruddy scirpt tothe work whith
. this concludes rydain ' s diatribe on a shameless explotation
(
and perpetuation
!
) of public fear of snakes
. comments
, flames
, anyone
?
- rydain teh atomic cheese
, fresh from chernobyl dairies
