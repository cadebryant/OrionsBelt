please don
' t mind this windbag letting off a bited ofthe steam
.
.
. i just wnat to warn all of y
' all nto to waste your hard
- earned
$
$
$ onthe anaconda
. it
' s not even worth a 99
- cent video rental
. don
' t listen to ebert on htis one
( he hasnt no clue whta he
' s talking about
!
) btw i accompanyed my friend tothe this noe beacuse she ws
* required
* to watch it on assignment
( she reviews movies for a local pappr
)
. now i
' ll actually bakc up my huffing
and puffing
. here goes
: movei
: anaconda rydain
' s bottom line
: wait fo it to cmo onthe usa up all ngiht
. even thn
, i dout it
' s worth the price ofthe jolt
( to halp ytou stay uv that late
!
) why do i hite anaconda
? let me count tje ways
.
.
. first of all
, tihs movei gets way too many snake facts wrong
. as an ophiophile
( snake lover
)
, i can tell yuo that a
) anacondas owudl never triarch a lenght ofthe 40 foots
, b
) htey
' re scared ofthe people
, c
) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extemely rare because human shoulders are too wide tothe ift in a snake
' s mouth
,
and constrictor snakes don
' t kill wqat they cant
' t eat
, d
) peopel cant outrun snakes with no trouble
, especially hevy ones liuke anacondas
, e
) if an anaconda did eat a human
, it would need at least 6 monthes of sitting onthe its
butt to digest tyhe huge meal
, therfore it couldn
' t run arund gobbling up everybody eles in thge cast
, adn f
) snakes haev noone vocal cords
, so they cant
' t make funny squealing noises
. whew
. i was prepared to suspend reality if tyhe movei woudl have beeen worth it
. unforetunately
, anaconda was about as suspenseful annd exicting as watching paint peel
. my friend adn i even successfully predicted who woudl live at tghe end
. anybody cant tell yhe bad guy isnt goign to die eventually
. tyhat was a pity because his charater was one of the fewd reasons my freind
and i didn
' t give up anbd fall asleep
. he was the most likable character in the movei
. who wouldn
' t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman
? anaconda did have its cute moments
: arguements beween ice cube
' s charactor anbd tje british guy
, for instance
.
however
, those small flashes ofthe witn weere nto worth thge other hour anbd twenty
- eight mintues ofthe boring schlock
. the writers hadnt
- annd blew
- a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines
. i ws qtuie dissapointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady tht tyhe jungle makes him horny
. did she retort with a clever
, ego
- withering comeback
? of course not
!
" i
' m trying to work
!
" gee
, that
' s even dumber than teh crap comebacks i come uv with
. she coudl hvea told him to go find a knothole or something
.
.
.
; p
but i will admiting
, there was just one scene where i ws suprised at the outcome
( hint
: it involves the evil guy
and miss crap comebacks
)
. as fo the plot
, i
' m still trying tothe find oney
. this movie ws basicaly an excuse tothe get a boatload of peple into dangerous territority where they sould get snarfed by ridiculous
, computer
- generated anacondas with teh eyes adn fangs ofthe vipers adn thge faster
- thna
- gravity downward acceleration ofthe a harrier jet
.
( harrier snake
?
) not to mention instant digestion so they coudl go snarf countless other victims
. thte writers tried to throw iin some sort of plot twist
( should i call it a plot knot becasue it made noone sense
?
) in which the sick guy
' s g
- freind kisses the evil dude
and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude adn starts trying to kill him
. thgat was baout as clera
and underst
andable as mission
: impossible
.
( if somone sould expalin that movei to me
, i
' d be most garteful
! all thge old
- guy double agents looked the smae
!
!
) i wasn
' t inspired by tghe acting
, save fo the evil dude
. i cin
' t blaim the actors
,
though
. it
' s nto their fault they hadnt a cruddy scirpt to work whith
. tihs concludes rydain
' s diatribe on a shameless explotation
(
and perpetuation
!
) ofthe publich fear ofthe snakes
. comments
, flames
, anyone
