since director steven zaillian previously wrote tjhe poverful screenplay fo 1993
' s steven spielberg drama
" schindler
' s list
"
and directed 1993
' s intelligent
" searching for bobby fischer
,
" his newyorker film
,
" a civil acation
,
" shoudln most likely be looked apon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career
. waht doesn
' t mkae sense is how such high
- profile
and superb actors as john travolta
, robert duvall
, william h
. macy
, adn kathleen quinlan got involved in thsi project
, whcih isnt both dull anbd completely ineffective
. the film
, which involves a small comunity ofthe children who mysteriously died of leukemia
, certainly containes the type ofthe stopry to be emotionally
- charged
, bu somehow all signs ofthe feeling ahev been completely removed from tghe procedings
, leaving us wtih nothing omre thna a poorly
- done courtroom drama
. based onthe a book by jonathan hart
, which was consequently based onthe a true account
,
" a civil action
" is set in 1982 in the twon ofthe woburn
, massmedia
.
, where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann
( john travolta
) decides tothe tkae onthe hte case ofthe eight familys who simpley wanna an apology forthe their children
' s death from leukemia due to unknown causes
. jan originally decides to drop teh case
,
but when he stumbles across to corporate giants
, grace
and beatrice foods
, who ahve plants located near thge familys
' homes
, he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into palce
: the two companies hve been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which
, thus
, goes into the city
' s drinking water
. suddenly
, affter hearing baout tjhe familes
' heartbreak annd personel stories
, he begins tothe care for them annd becomes determined tothe git tothe the bottom of the mistery
, even
though he isnt warned by his staff accountant
( william h
. macy
) that noone mney is coming inwhich to them
, onyl oging out
. also figuring inot the tsory is jerome facher
( robert duvall
)
, beatrice foods
' corporate counsel
, who finds hismelf in heated waters when jan iwll not accept his
$ 20
- millon offer to settle the case
. coming fomr such a talented writter
, director
, anbd casted
, nto to mention oen of thge most interesting film composers
, danny elfman
,
" a civil action
" is an astoundingly empty
- headed drama
, one thta includes an intriguing stor anbd somehow transforms it inot an admittedly tiresome
and occasionally even boring expeirence
. perhaps one ofthe its major problems was that in its attemts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture
, zaillian hasnt misplaced its refreshing unconventional atitude withthe an absence of magnetism
and even meaninng
. watching the film
, i couldn
' t halp
but notice its similarities whith 1997
' s far
, far superior film
" the sweet hereafter
,
" whlch dealed with a lawyer
, played brilliantly by ian holm
, investigating a school bus accident thast killed a number ofthe children
. in his attempts to find someone who may hvae beeen responsible forthe tghe accident
, holm interviews the grieving parents
, as well as tyhe sole surviving passenger
, a teenage girl
, which starts tothe remind him ofthe his own teenage daugter
, a young drug
- addict who has run away from hmeo
. nto onyl wass the plotting similar to
" a civil acation
,
"
but it allso had yhe smae excact running tiome of 115 mintues
. concidering thsi
, it is amazing how fulfilling anbd truthful
" a sweet hereafter
" ws
, not only concentrating on thte skool bus accident
,
but delving deeply inot ian holm
' s character annd his pwn personal demons
, as well as tghe teenage girl
. iin
" a civil acation
,
" howver
, i ahev noone idea where the running timne went
, sicne thge film isnt virtually two huors of nothingness
. we do not get tothe know teh parents very well
, nor any of tghe main charactors
. thru its whole duration
, i doed not leran oen thign
_
_ nto one thing
_
_ about travolta
' s lawyer charater
, jan schlictmann
, who doesn
' t appear to have any sort ofthe life or purpose outside of his job
. every scene isnt tediously related direcly tothe hte premise
,
and therfore
, ther was noone one fo me to care baout or root for
. yuo
' ve got tothe work pretty hard
, acutally
, to nto get an audiance tothe become involved infront the parents
' llright
, usance thier childen are dead
, bu that is exactly waht
" a civil action
" does
. tothe be honest
, i would be fairly hard
- pressed tothe state an aspect ofthe tyhe film thgat i actually liked
. asside fomr oney flashback to whn a man
' s young son died onthe tjhe way tothe tyhe doctor
, i remained unmoved
and passive about waht ws gonig on in teh scenes
, adn more thna once foudn my mind w
andering
. i could sday tghe performances weere ogod
,
but who
' s fooling who
? sicne eveyr character isnt one
- dimensionally written
, noone oney
' s acting abilities are challanged inthe any way
. travolta plays a lawyer well enough
,
but tyhat
' s about all he does
. duvall virutally sleepwalks thru his role
, aparently onyl appearing to give one
- liners at every chance he gets
. annd whta infront the world isnt kathy bates doign iin the picture
' s fianl scene
, as a judge
? she appears unbilled
, since it is jsut a cameo
,
but why doed she even agress tothe do it inaddition teh firt place
? finally
, when teh conclusion arrived
and the end credits began tothe role
, teh film left me wiht anohter question
: what ws yhe point
? abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum
, where none came befor that tothe beign with
,
" a civil action
" seemed tothe me
, at least
, tothe be an example ofthe how not tothe make a courtroom drama
,
and it certainly did nto do justice tothe the veyr sereous subject marter tje film deals with
.
