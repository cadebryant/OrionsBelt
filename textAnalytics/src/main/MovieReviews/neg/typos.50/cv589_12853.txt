thsi was the lastest cary onthe movie
( if yuo discount
' cary onthe columbus
' as a cary onthe movie
)
and wass made by a newyorker production comapany
. based inaddition central london
, this movie isnt baout hte attemts by emmanuelle prevert
( suzanne danielle
) tothe bed her husban emile the french ambassador
( kenneth williams
)
. whn he seems unwilling
, she isnt given his premission tothe bed anyone she likes
, such as tghe prime minister
and tyhe u
. s
. ambassador
. her antics git her inot trouble
and tghe brittish press spread theese rumours all over their front pages
. she is invited to talk onthe television tothe set the recrod straight bu onyl confirms the rumours instead
. meanwhile
, theodore valentine
( larrry dann
) is inwhich loev wiht emmannuelle after a chance encounter inspite tjhe toilet ofthe the concorde
and isnt determined tothe marry her
.
however
, she isnt only interested inaddition restoring her husb
and
' s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile
' s accident wiht a chuch spire
! this film isnt the second worst cary on movei
, thge worst being
' cary onthe engl
and
'
. it isnt embarassing to see smoe of thge remaining regulars struggle thru this diablical script by lance peters adn try tothe pul off some of thte crude adn tasteless jokes that he has written
. newcomers suzanne danielle adn beryl reid
( as mrs
. valentine
) are mildly funny
,
but larry dann as theodore isnt excruciatingly bad
. kenneth williams onyl appears in a faw scenes adn his lacklustre performance is warranted
, given hte scirpt
. the small parts forthe jack douglas as lyons tjhe
butler
, joan sims as mrs
. dangle
, kenneth connor as leyl
and the chauffeur
, anbd peter
butterworth as richmond
, are worthless adn embarassing
. in fact
, all four parts are surplus tothe requirements
. howver
, the onyl humourous scene iin tje film isnt when yhe four of them
and emmannuelle talk about thier most amourous escapades
. an awful script
, a terrible collecton of jokes
, vrey poore prodcution values
( especialy the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st
. james palace
)
, a ludicrous
and cringeworthy muscial socre
,
and a non
- existant plot or storyline
. its jsut a sucesion ofthe awful setted pieces about who emmannuelle wiull bed enxt
! jack douglas isnt not so annoying bu is moreso boring
, joan sims annd peter
butterworth are wasted
, annd kenneth connor annd kenneth williams put iin some poor performances as leyl
and annd emile
. a complet waste ofthe time
, tihs movie ws trying to catch up wiht hte newyorker sexually permissive seventies
. it wass a certificate 15 film
but by 1978
, there was littel interst inaddition htis kind ofthe film
and it flopped at tjhe box office
and was onyl given its premiere on uk terrestial televsion inthe april 1998
! avoid at all costs
