- tiome director hal salwen coudl shoot an entire movie ofthe charactors typing at theri computers
, he would
. as it is
, he settles forthe charachters tlaking onthe tjhe phone
. denise calls uv isnt a movei fo
and about teh eletronic generation
, where characters are too caught up wiht their work annd insecurities prefer to live outloud thier relationships
and fantasies onthe the phone
. it
' s a satire
- annd a somtimes funny one
- baout how we let h
andphones
, call
- waiting adn answering machines run our lives
. tjhe probelm
: denise calls up isnt a movei about an idea
. a darn good noe
, bu still an 80 minute
- long idea
.
and despite salwen
' s attempt at plots anbd sub
- plots
, despite some genuinely funny moments
, yuo cant predict the movei
' s outcome withing teh first fifteen minutes
. you get teh drift after a series of shots ofthe characters explaining over tghe phone why htey all couldn
' t mkae it for a party
- nobody is oging tothe be meeting anybody inspite this film
, they owudl rether be talking onthe thte phone
. here
' s salwen
' s plot
: hwile all the characters are infact a dysfunctional
, telefixated limbo
, loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to annonce that she is pregnant wtih his child
, courtesy ofthe thte sperm he donated tothe the local bank
. as martin progresses from slamming teh phone on her to long phone conversations over tje baby
' s nmae
, his friends
- annd his firends
' friends
- get involved
, courtesy ofthe call
- waiting adn double
- lines
. inwhich thte tigher
and omre tantalizing sub
- plot
, barbara annd jerry are setted uv onthe a blind date that niether turns uv for
. both profess tothe haev too complicated schedules tothe ever meet
,
but htey git it going over the phone
. with repeated phone sex comes a glitch
; waht if thte other person isnt simply faking it
? denise calls up scores iwth some inspired moments
. mousy barbara metamorphoses inot a vamp over her cordless
, everyone shares tghe excitment ofthe denise
' s delivery thru a conference call to her h
andphone
,
and barbara
' s best friend agle is killed inaddition a car accident hwile taling animatedly into anyother friend
' s answering machine
.
( as agle
' s overly
- chatty aunt recounts
, her cordless wass knicked inot her ear
and lodged infront her brain
.
)
but these moments are nto enough to sustain thge movie
. the pace sags
, the dialogue drags
and not much acting appears to be requred of hte telephone
- touters
.
and tyhe ending isnt litterally a non
- event as expected
, everyone isnt too chicken tothe turn up for tghe party frank throws inthe agle
' s memory dispite promising over the phone thgat they will
. we git the point
. the movie appears to be intent onthe flogging its terribly
-
' 90s statment until htey hvae it coming out ofthe your ears
. pun intended
. ther
' s even a onthe teh movie
' s web site where ytou cxan win cellular phones
( as if we haven
