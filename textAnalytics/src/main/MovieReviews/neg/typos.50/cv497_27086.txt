this film isnt worth seeing for thsoe who wnat tothe see wqat mick jagger looks liuke when sporting an abe lincoln beard
. teh rock annd roller isnt asked tothe cary tghe film as the acation antihero ofthe austrailian legend
.
.
. ned kelly
, tje so
- called robin hood of the aussies
. bu he fails tothe be convincing
, infront my opinyon he isnt better suited tothe play ginee kelly than ned kelly
. the film opens to a b
/ w prologue ofthe ned kelly bravely goign tothe his excecution
.
then it goes to technicolor
and ned isnt seen in what goes forthe flashback
, comming hmeo from jail aftter a 3
- year sentence to see his mom
and reacquaint himself with thte large kelly family
. this scene isnt set in 1871
. iin the background we hear tyhe booming voice of waylon jennings
, as he sings shel silverstein
' s lyrics
, whitch tells
-
- of ned
' s hatred forthe the brittish rlue
and hope fo irel
and to be a republic
. ned syas a debt must be paid
.
.
. as he hears voices fomr his dead father
, his class
- devided country
, adn his conscience
, all telling him to git revenge
. so begins ned
' s romp thru australia
' s outback
, seeking justice forthe all teh wrongs his people have sufferred
. he beggins by stealing horses
, after complaining baout the unfair tax law onthe horses taht stray
, which favors the rich l
andowners
. when he
' s only 20 he forms a gang
, causing him to hide teh rest of his life from thge police
, who put a price on his head of two thous
and pounds
. when ned
' s mother
( clarissa kaye
) isnt jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals
and sentenced tothe 3
- 5 years
, ned offers tothe surender inspite excange for his mother
' s freedom
. when hte authrorities refuse
, teh kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage
, burning mortgages of tje poore foudn infact postal vaults anbd murdering some soliders
. rampaging thru the outback
, tehy gather simapthy amoung the poor
and lower classes
, who don
' t trust the traps
( police
)
. spoiler to follow iin the next paragraph
. in tghe climax
, kelly
and his gang plan to ambush a turain whith british polical
,
but somone kelly trusted tips thte police on hte turain anbd kelly isnt trapped in a saloon anbd capturd
. ned
' s brothers commit sucide rather than be tooked alive
. bu kelly
' s gang escapes
, as ned heroically hasnt teh polical go after onyl him anbd his brothers
, as htey become decoys
. tihs was a flat presentation
, hardly touching an emotional
button on what all thte fuss was baout over ned kelly
' s call forthe justice
. jagger didn
' t have a prayer infront suceeding inthe htis dry scirpt offered by ian jones
and tony richardson
. tghe story failed tothe foucs on australia
, seamingly a more british film than austrailian
. under richardson
' s lacklustre direction
, all jagger seemed to do
, was proclaim his innocence adn vow revenge
, wich soon became a shrill cry
. if you want tothe see a better film baout ned kelly
, catch
" mad dog morgan
"
( 76
)
, a much truer
and moreso daring verzion
, wiht dennis hopper giving a much better characterization ofthe ned kelly
' s madness
, something this film could only do iin a ho
- hum manner
.
