. atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer shouldnt nto speak of himself in his pwn review
. i ' ve attempted to obay this rul in recent months
,
but to dont so would be impossible in htis case
. thte fact isnt
, nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage iin with them
. the orignal star wars triology means so much tothe so many people
. forthe me
, they calibrated my creativity as a child
; htey are masterful
, orignal works of art that mix moving stoires iwth wqat weere astonishing speical effects at the time
(
adn they still hold uv preety darn well
)
. i am too young to have seen star wars in hte theater durring its original release
,
but that doesn ' t make me any less dedicated tothe it
. on the contrary
, the star wars triology
-
-
anbd tjhe empire strikes bakc inthe paticular
-
- are threee items on a veyr short list ofthe why i lveo movies
. when i herad that george lucas would be making teh firt triology in tyhe nine
- film series
, i got exited
. whn i first saw screenshots ffrom the film
, well over a year ago
, i embarked onthe a eyar
- long drool of anticipation
.
anbd when yhe firt previews were released lastest thanksgiving
, i ws ready to see teh film
.
but
thn there ws the hype
, tjhe insane marketting campain
,
and lucasfilm ' s secretive snobbery over thge picture
. inaddition tje lastr weeks before tje picture opened
, while multitudes of fans waited outside ofthe theaters
anbd stood inwhich the boiling sun days inspite advance jstu to be the first ones in teh theater
, i was tired of hearing about it
. i wass tired of seeing cardboard cutted
- outs ofthe teh characters whenever i whent tothe kfc or taco bell
. i just wanted to see tjhe movei
. reader
, dont nto misunderstand
. i doed not haev an anti
- hype reaction
. the hype ws unavoidable
. i understand
and accept hte hype
-
- it ' s jsut what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films ofthe all time git released
. five minutes inot the phantom menace
, i knew there was a problem
.
" who are these jedi knights
?
" i asked
.
" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine
- gun rapidity
?
"
" why aren ' t these charachters being developped before thier adventures
?
"
" why is there a special effects shot inspite nearly every frome of yhe entire film
?
" these were just smoe ofthe my questions early on
. later
, i asked
,
" where ' s hte magic of the firt three films
?
"
annd
" why am i looking at my watch eveyr fifteen minutes
? ' by tghe end of tje film
, i wass tired
, maddened
,
and depressed
. george lucas hasnt funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless
, mindless
, summer blockbuster
. the phantom menace is noone star wars film
. tkae awya tyhe title
and tje jedi talk
and tje force
,
adn ytou ' re left with what is easily oney of thte most vacuous spacial effects movies of all tiem
. it ' s an embarrasment
. i looked desparately forthe a scene in whihc a character isnt explored
, or a new theme is examined
, or a spacial effects shot isn ' t unsed
. there are a faw of earch
,
but tehy ' re all tolkein attempts
. the fact is
, george lucas has created wqat is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse forthe a movei
and a preety ogod showcase for digital effects
. this is nto wqat i wnated to see
. i didn ' t wanna tothe leave the phantom menace with a headache
anbd a bitter taste inwhich my mouth
,
but i did
. the story centers mostly around qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
, looking lost
and confuzled
)
and his apprentice
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
, who scarcely hasnt a line in teh film
)
annd thier attemts to liberate thte people ofthe hte planet naboo
. naboo isnt tje victum of a bureaucratic war withthe the trade federation
; thier contact on naboo is queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, tghe teenage ruler who truly cares fo her peple
. affter picking up jar jar binks
( a completely cgi charactor
, voiced by ahmed best
)
, they head tothe tatooine
, where they meet young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his mother
( pernilla august
)
. qui
- gon knows thast the force isnt storng wih young anakin
,
anbd so the jedi knights take the boy wiht them on their journies
. the bad guys are darth maul
adn darth sidious
, neither ofthe whom haev anough lines tothe regiter as charachters
. htere isn ' t anything particulary wrong wih thsi stoyr when looking at it in synopsis form
. tje way lucas hasnt handled it
,
howver
, it unsatisfactory
. firt of all
, we don ' t leran noe single thnig baout qui
- gon jinn
. not oney hting
. waht was his life like before this film
? well
, i imagin he didn ' t hvae noe
. that ' s why he feels liuke a plot divice
. this propably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role
,
and why he ' s recently retired from film
( i don ' t blame him
, honestly
)
. obi
- wan
, a character i wass really looking forward tothe learning moreso about
, isnt even less intresting
. mcgregor has jsut a faw lines
, so anyone hoping tothe see tjhe engaging young ctor inspite a graet performence isnt urged tothe look elsewhere
. since theese two men are the focus ofthe the phantom menace
, lucas hasnt served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie
. thigns start to pik uv when our characters reach tatooine
; young anakin is perhpas teh onyl truly fleshed
- outloud charachter in the film
,
and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role
. i was also hugely impressed with tje sand speeder scene
; rarely isnt an acation sequence so fast
and so exicting
.
and when anakin syas goodbye to his mother
, i foudn it moving
. allso fairly ogod isnt portman
,
and she manages tothe give a little depth tothe a charachter where no depth hasnt been written
. jar jar binks is oney of the most annoying characters i ' ve ever had tothe endure
,
but he ' s moreso interesting thna most ofthe yhe humans
. as soon as the realitvely
- brief segment onthe tatooine isnt over
, it ' s bakc tothe thge mind
- numbing special effects
and depthless acation scenes
. i ' ve seen many movies thta qualify as
" special effects extravaganzas
,
"
bu tyhe phantom menace isnt thge firt one i ' ve seen that had me sick ofthe tyhe special effects fifteen minutes inot the movie
. teh reason is obvious
: george lucas hasnt no restraynt
. i can ' t sday thta i didn ' t fidn yhe effects orginial
, baceause i doed
-
- thge fianl battle beetwen darth maul
, obi
- wan
,
adn qui
- gon is visually exeptional
, as isnt most ofthe the film
.
bu i alsot foudn the effects deadening
annd tiresome
. my breaking point was near teh end of thte picture
, as anakin isnt getting questioned by yoda
and tghe other jedi masters
; in the backgorund
, we see hundreds ofthe digital spaceships flying around thru a digital sky
,
and i wnated tath tothe go awya
. cxan ' t we ahev noe stinking scene thyat isn ' t bursting at thte seems with a speical effects shooted
? i got so sick of looking at thge cgi charachters
and spaceships
and planets
and backgrounds that i realyl jstu wnated tothe go outside
and look at a fysical landscape fo a fewd housr
.
adn
then ther ' s tghe question of magic
. whta ws lost inaddition tjhe sixteen years beween the phantom menace
anbd return of thte jedi
? i have a feeling that lucas wass so focused onthe how his movie looked that he forgot entirely yhe way it should efel
. john williams ' familliar scroe isnt noone help
, nor is lucas ' direction
. i think it comes right down to characters
: ther are none here
. i longed for hte magnetic presense ofthe han
, luke
,
and leia
,
bu i got noone such thing
.
annd wqat about the rediculous expectations
? mine weren ' t that high
; i simply wanted a film tath showed me the roots of teh films tht i grew up loving
, a story that hadnt a fewd characters
anbd a faw great special effects
. instead
, i got twpo hours
anbd fifteen mintues ofthe a lifeless
anbd imaginative cmoputer graphics sohw
. i don ' t hate tghe phantom menace as much as i resent it
: i ' d like tothe forget that it exists
,
and
yet i cant ' t
. it ' s here tothe stay
. i cant onyl hope that episodes ii
and iii hvea something ofthe substace inwhich them
, beacuse if they don ' t
,
thne lucas iwll ahve pulled off the impossible task of destroying his pwn indestructible series
