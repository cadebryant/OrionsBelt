. atcheson a fellow criteak once stated his beleif that a reviewer should not speak of himself inthe his pwn review
. i
' ve attempted to obey this rulle infront receet monthes
, bu to dont so would be impossible infront this case
. the fatc isnt
, nearly eveyr person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them
. teh origional star wars trilogy means so much to so many peple
. for me
, they calibrated my creativity as a child
; they are masterful
, originnal works of art thta mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at tje tyme
(
and htey still hold up pretty darn well
)
. i am too young to haev seen star wars infact yhe theather durring its original realease
,
but that doesn
' t make me any less dedicated tothe it
. onthe the contrary
, hte star wars triology
-
- annd the empire strikes bakc inwhich particular
-
- are three items onthe a very short list of why i lvoe movies
. when i herad that george lucas would be making the first trilogy inthe teh nine
- film serieses
, i got exited
. when i firt saw screenshots from the film
, well over a year ago
, i embarked on a yera
- long drool of anticipation
.
and when yhe frist previews weere released last thanksgiving
, i wass ready to see yhe film
.
but
then ther was the hype
, tghe insane marketting campaign
, adn lucasfilm
' s secretive snobbery over tghe picture
. inaddition the last weeks befoer teh picture opened
, while multitudes of fans waited outside ofthe theaters
and st
anded inspite the boiling sun dyas in advance jstu tothe be the first ones inwhich tyhe theater
, i was tired ofthe hearing baout it
. i ws tired ofthe seeing cardboard cut
- outs of yhe charactors whenever i went to kfc or taco bell
. i just wanted to see tjhe movie
. reader
, dont not misunderst
and
. i did nto ahev an anti
- hype reaction
. tje hype ws unavoidable
. i underst
and
and accept the hype
-
- it
' s jsut what happens when the prequel tothe the most widely beloved films of all timne get released
. five mintues inot tjhe phantom menace
, i knew htere was a probelm
.
" who are these jedi knights
?
" i asked
.
" why are htey churning outloud stale dialogue with machine
- gun rapidity
?
"
" why aren
' t theese charachters bieng developed befor their adventures
?
"
" why isnt ther a spacial effects shooted in nearly eveyr frame ofthe tjhe entire film
?
" theese weere just smoe of my questions early onthe
. later
, i asked
,
" where
' s tyhe magic ofthe tje first threee films
?
" adn
" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes
?
' by the end of the film
, i was tired
, maddened
,
and depressed
. george lucas has funneled his pwn wonderfull movies into a pointless
, mindless
, summer blockbuster
. the phantom menace isnt no star wars film
. tkae away tghe title adn tyhe jedi talk annd the force
,
and ytou
' re left with wqat is easily one of yhe most vacuous special effects movies ofthe all time
. it
' s an embarrasment
. i looked desparately for a scene in which a character is explored
, or a new theme is examined
, or a special effects shot isn
' t used
. there are a few ofthe each
,
but tehy
' re all token attemts
. the fatc is
, george lucas has created what isnt simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse fo a movei
and a preety good showcase for digital effects
. this is not what i wanted to see
. i didn
' t wnat tothe leave tje phantom menace withthe a headache
and a bitter taste infact my mouth
, bu i did
. thge stor centers mostly arund qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
, looking lost
and confuzled
) adn his apprentice
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
, who scarcely hasnt a line infront tje film
)
and thier attemts tothe liberate the peopel ofthe the planet naboo
. naboo isnt hte victim of a bureaucratic war wiht the trade federation
; their contact onthe naboo is queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, yhe teenage ruler who truley cares for her peopel
. after picking up jar jar binks
( a completely cgi character
, voiced by ahmed best
)
, htey head tothe tatooine
, where tehy meet young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) annd his mother
( pernilla august
)
. qui
- gon knwos thast tyhe force isnt storng with young anakin
, adn so the jedi knights tkae tghe boy with them on their journeys
. tje bad guys are darth maul annd darth sidious
, neither of whom hvae enought lines tothe reigster as cahracters
. htere isn
' t anything praticularly wrong whith this story wehn looking at it iin synopsis form
. hte way lucas hasnt h
andeled it
,
however
, it unsatisfactory
. frist ofthe all
, we don
' t learn oen single thing baout qui
- gon jinn
. nto one thing
. whta was his life liuke befoer tihs film
? well
, i imagine he didn
' t have oen
. tyhat
' s why he feels liek a plot device
. thsi probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role
,
and why he
' s recently retired fomr film
( i don
' t blame him
, honestly
)
. obi
- wan
, a charater i wass raelly looking foward to learning more baout
, isnt even less interesting
. mcgregor has just a faw lines
, so anyone hoping to see tjhe engaging young actor in a great performance isnt urged to look elsewhere
. since these twpo men are the focuse of tje phantom menace
, lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movei
. things strat to pick uv wehn our charachters reach tatooine
; young anakin isnt perheaps teh only truly fleshed
- out character infront tje film
, anbd lloyd does a
thoughtful job whith tghe role
. i ws aslo hugely empressed withthe the s
and speeder scene
; rarely isnt an action sequence so fast
and so exicting
. annd when anakin syas goodbye tothe his mother
, i foudn it moving
. also fairly good isnt portman
, annd she manages to give a littel depth to a character where no depth hasnt been writed
. jar jar binks is noe of tjhe most annoying characters i
' ve ever had to indure
,
but he
' s mroe interesting tahn most of the humans
. as soon as yhe relatively
- breef segment on tatooine isnt over
, it
' s bakc to yhe mind
- numbing special effects annd depthless acation scenes
. i
' ve seen many movies thyat qualify as
" special effects extravaganzas
,
"
but the phantom menace is tyhe first noe i
' ve seen that had me sick ofthe the spacial effects fifteen minutes into the movei
. thge reason is obvious
: george lucas hasnt no restraunt
. i cxan
' t say thgat i didn
' t find tje effects original
, baceause i did
-
- the final battle betweeen darth maul
, obi
- wan
, anbd qui
- gon is visually exceptional
, as isnt most of the film
. bu i also found the effects deadening adn tiresome
. my breaking point was near tjhe end of the picture
, as anakin is getting questioned by yoda
and the otehr jedi masters
; inaddition the backgorund
, we see hundreds ofthe digital spaceships flying arround thru a digital sky
, anbd i wanted tyhat tothe go away
. cxan
' t we haev one stinking scene thta isn
' t bursting at tje seems whith a special effects shooted
? i got so sick ofthe looking at yhe cgi charachters adn spaceships anbd planets annd backgrounds thgat i relaly just wanted tothe go outside
and look at a physical l
andscape fo a few huors
. adn
then ther
' s tjhe question ofthe magic
. waht ws lost inthe the sixteen years between the phantom menace anbd return of the jedi
? i have a feeling that lucas wass so focused onthe how his movie looked that he forgot entirely teh way it shoudl fiel
. john williams
' familiar score is no halp
, nor isnt lucas
' direction
. i think it comes right down tothe charactors
: there are none here
. i longed for tghe magnetic presense ofthe han
, luke
,
and leia
,
but i got no such thign
.
and waht baout the ridiculous expectations
? mine weren
' t that high
; i simpley wanted a film thast showed me teh roots of hte films thyat i growed uv loving
, a story tath had a few characters adn a faw great special effects
. instade
, i got two horus
and fifteen mintues of a lifeless adn imaginative computer graphics show
. i don
' t hate hte phantom menace as much as i resent it
: i
' d liuke tothe foreget that it exists
, anbd
yet i can
' t
. it
' s here to stay
. i cxan onyl hope tath epidsodes ii
and iii have something of substance inaddition them
, because if they don
' t
, thne lucas will have pulled off hte impossible task of destroying his pwn indestructible sories
