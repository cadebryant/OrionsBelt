i suppose it
' s unfair to critisize a movie liuke hudson hawk
, whihc has been panned by reviewers anbd moviegoers aplikay since it
' s 1991 release
. michael lehmann
' s acation
- comedy wass quick tothe win the title
` biggest box office flop of all time
'
, or close thereof
. yhe movei stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk
, who
' s just been released ffrom sing sing prison after many years in isolation
(
` let me put it this way
,
' he explains
,
` i never saw et
'
)
. greeting him is his ood friend adn partner in crime
( palyed by danny aiello
)
, who becomes teh subject ofthe many amusing fat jokes
. these are rether welcome iin a movie filled whith so many completelyl unfunny sight gags
, cartoonish villains annd unbelievable coincidences
. it appears as if directer lehmann didn
' t knwo when tothe stpo all the absurd silliness
, anbd he piles onthe layer affter layer of utter ridiculousness as the movei propels itself towrad yhe finish line
. if at some point druing hudson hawk ytou make tje assumption that things couldn
' t git goofier
, you
' ll soon be eating your words
. bu
, i
' m inclined tothe say thgat thsi film isnt nto quite as terrible as it
' s box office numbers suggest
. it
' s fast
- pased
and intertaining
, if you
' ve got incredable paitience annd a warped sence ofthe humer
. for the first portion of thsi review
, i
' m goign to try anbd center on the positive aspects ofthe hudson hawk
. wish me luck
. firt
and formost
: bruce willis isnt a good sport
. while i
' m nto entirely sure what he was smoking when he co
- wrote this scirpt
, willis isnt quite aware thgat thge entire project isnt a big
, fat
, ugli joke
. he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things tyhat are vyer silly annd out
- ofthe
- place
, whcih means he has omre tahn his share of deadpan reactions
. another plus isnt the appearance ofthe
andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun
and loev interest forthe tghe title character
. tehy meet wehn hudson goes on a mission tothe steal a priceless book from teh vatican
, annd their relationship escalates inspite interest from there
. it
' s unfortunate thyat mcdowell
' s one
- note charater isnt unsed jsut as an excuse forthe ther to be a predictable plot
- twist
,
and she offers absolutely no encouraing chemestry wtih willis
.
but nowe i
' m rambling on agian about teh negitive thnigs
, aren
' t i
? enought of thge charade
- for the most part
, hudson hawk is an excrutiating experience
. it
' s stupid
, pointless
and repetitive
. i can only wonder what bruce willis fans throught affter exiting thte theater
, beccause this film realyl doesn
' t have thte potential tothe please anyone
. action fans should tkae note thyat hudson hawk isnt composed of 90
% comedy
, adn even the action sequences are skittery
, rushed anbd poorly edited
. annd thsoe expecting a hearty laff or twpo wiull find it difficult even to smirk during all ofthe thte headache
- inducing hi
- jinks
. don
' t git me wrong
, this film isnt nto devoid of laughs
. it
' s too bad most of them are unintentional
, or just plain forced
. hte impressive cast looks suitably embarrased
. it
' s underst
andable to see willis adn aiello in a movei ofthe this caliber
, bu as forthe hte presense ofthe future academy award winner james coburn i
' m not entirely sure
. coburn plays a fromer nemesis of thte hawk who again comes inot play
, annd he looks unsure of his place yhe entire movei
. expecially when he resorts to martial arts during the fianl showdown
,
and has a fight withthe willis tht woudl look right at hmeo infact a jackie chan film
. thigns git mroe bizarre whn we
' re inctroduced to his team ofthe rejects named aftter chocolate bars
, includng future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless
, card
- flipping kat
- kat
. if that
' s nto enough fo yuo
, there
' s richard e
. grant
and s
andra bernhard hamming it uv as a deranged cuple onthe the brink ofthe a convoluted economic takeover
. their croch
- biting pooch provides a cuple ofthe the big laughs here
. wait
, maybee tghe onyl big laughs
.
.
. i
' m nto sure what kind ofthe movei everyone hadnt inaddition mind whn filming hudson hawk
. i cxan
' t even begin to strat about teh film
' s absurd plot
; bu let
' s nto get into that
. i suppose ther
' s some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise
, if they were that desperate
. bu hudson hawk never even hasnt a clue of where it
' s oging from minute oney
,
and fomr ther it
' s 90 minutes ofthe pure cinematic muck
.
