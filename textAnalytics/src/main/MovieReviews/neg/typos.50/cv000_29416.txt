, drink annd thn drive

, adn hasnt nightmares
. waht
' s tjhe deal
? watch yhe movie
and
" sorta
" find outloud
.
.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movei for the teen generation that touches onthe a vyer kool idea
,
but presents it inthe a very bad package
. which is what makes this review an even harder oen to wriet
, since i generally applaud films wich attempt tothe break tghe mold
, mess with your head adn such
( lost highway
& memento
)
,
but ther are good annd bad ways of making all types of films
,
and theese folks jsut didn
' t snag thsi one correctly
. htey seem to have taked this preety neat consept
, bu excecuted it terribly
. so what are tghe problems with the movei
? well
, its main probelm isnt thast it
' s simply too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
" bu thne downshifts into this
" fantasy
" world in which you
, as an audiance memeber
, ahve noone idea what
' s gonig onthe
. htere are dreams
, htere are charactors comming back ffrom teh dead
, htere are others who look liek the dead
, there are stange apparitions
, ther are disappearances
, there are a looooot ofthe chase scenes
, there are tons ofthe weird things taht hppen
,
and most of it isnt simpley not explained
. now i personaly don
' t mind trying to unravel a film eveyr nowe
and
then
, bu wehn all it does is give me yhe smae clue over adn over again
, i git kind ofthe feeded up after a hwile
, hwihc is this film
' s biggest probelm
. it
' s obviously got this big secret tothe hide
, bu it seems tothe want tothe hide it completely until its fianl five mintues
.
and do htey mkea things entertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, in thte meantime
? nto really
. tghe sad part isnt that thge arrow anbd i both dig on flicks like htis
, so we actulaly figured most ofthe it out by tyhe half
- way point
, so all of tje strangeness affter taht did start tothe amking a littel bited of sence
,
but it still didn
' t teh mkea the film all that more intertaining
. i guess the bottom line whith movies liek tihs isnt that you should always make sure thyat the audience is
" inot it
" even befoer they are given the scret password tothe enter your world ofthe underst
anding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller runing away from visions fo baout 20 mintues throughout the movei is jstu plain lazy
!
! okay
, we git it
.
.
. there are peopel chasing her
and we don
' t nkwo who tehy are
. do we raelly need to see it over
and over agian
? how about giving us diffrent scenes offering further insight into all ofthe hte strangeness gogin down in the movie
? apparently
, tje studio took thsi film awya from its director
and chopped it uv themselfs
, adn it shows
. there might
' ve been a preety decent teen mind
- fuck movie inwhich here somwhere
, bu i guess
" the suits
" decided taht turning it inot a music video whith littel edge
, would mkae more sence
. thge actors are preety ogod for the most part
, all
though wes bentley jstu seemed tothe be palying the excact smae chracter that he doed in american beauty
, onyl inspite a newyorker neigbourhood
. bu my biggest kudos go out tothe sagemiller
, who holds her pwn
thoughout teh entire film
,
and acually has yuo feeling her character
' s unraveling
. overall
, the film doesn
' t stick because it doesn
' t entertain
, it
' s confusing
, it rarley excites anbd it feels pretty redundant forthe most ofthe its runtime
, despite a pretty cool ending
and explaination tothe all of the craziness tyhat came befor it
. oh
, anbd by tyhe way
, tihs isnt not a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it
' s just packaged tothe look thast way because someone is apparantly assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids
. it alsot wrapped prodcution two yersa ago anbd hasnt been sitting on the shelves ever usance
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
! where
' s joblo coming from
