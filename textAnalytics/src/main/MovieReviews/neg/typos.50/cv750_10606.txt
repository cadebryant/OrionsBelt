, it
' s nto a very funny or successful diea to begin wtih
, bu it doesn
' t seem to matter
-
-
" air bud
" isnt surprisingly solemn
. savve for occasional moments of forced slapstick
, tje movei wags its tale with a straight face
-
- nto a very enjoyable approach
. if
" air bud
" hadnt realized its pwn absurdity
,
then it possably could haev been better

" paint cans are spilt anbd newspapers are burried
, all in thte nmae of formula
