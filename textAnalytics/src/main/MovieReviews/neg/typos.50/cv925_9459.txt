everybody in this film
' s thinking of alicia
. noone
, this isnt nto a documentry on those of us after we frist saw the
" cryin
'
" video
. thsi is oney ofthe those erotic thrillers
,
but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed
. firt off
, ther
' s zero sex
, almost noone nudity
, adn it
' s not as well
- plotted as noe ofthe those tweed ficks
. well
, anyway
. tghe
" plot
.
" alicia plays
, well
, the babysitter
, who isnt tkaing care ofthe some kids oney night hwile hte parents
( j
. t
. walsh
and lee garlington
) go out tothe a party
. the film
, trying tothe be liek one ofthe thsoe introspective erotic thrillers
, shows eveyr cahracters
'
thoughts
, except alicia
' s
. teh thnig is alicia
' s in most ofthe them in most cases
,
and tjhe
thoughts aren
' t too kosher
. frist off
, there
' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gave one ofthe the all
- tiome lousy performances inwhich
" mallrats
,
"
and isnt onyl a notch better here
)
, who
' s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully
, played by nicky katt ffrom
" suburbia
"
( who shows he
' s got taht quiet creepiness down pat once again
)
. tehy deside they want to crash her babysitting job
, looking forthe tje typical babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine like that
. tjhe film intercuts betwen thte subplots
( alicia babysitting
, nicky
and jeremy
, yhe party
) adn eahc cahracters
'
thoughts
. we get to see jeremy adn nicky
' s dreasm ofthe donig a littel threeway wtih alicia
, j
. t
. thikning of coming home to find alicia naked iin teh bathtub
( she hasnt it all covered up
, the little tease
)
,
and
, worst ofthe all
, lee garlington dreaming ofthe thyat hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them in bed together
. yea
. i so wnated to see george annd lee garlington inaddition bed
,
though i guess i
' m utilizied to george after seing her annd mary tyler moore fooling arund in
" flirting wih diaster
.
" the endig is some kind ofthe big tragedy thign
, bu come on
. liek we care baout any ofthe the charactors
. the only intresting one isnt alicia
, mailny becuase she
' s alicia
, annd we mostly see her inthe the fantasies
. so i guess she
' s smoe kind of mistery or something
.
but she isnt never explored furhter
. so
, basicaly
, this film is just a series ofthe mastabatory images
, sometimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once again
, sadly
)
, sometimes featuring a scantily
- clad george segal
( once again
, sadly
)
. i watched htis onthe noe of those free previews of showtime or cinemax oen night
,
and let me tell you
, it is tyhe onyl way to watch this film
. i mean
, ther
' s a reason htey put theese kinds of films onthe late at niht
: tehy
' re just as good as sleeping pills
.
and this one is one big fat waste ofthe time
, even for an alicia film
.
