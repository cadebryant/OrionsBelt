depending on who ytou ask
, tje origonal sin ws either yhe eating ofthe the aple
, the ect of disobedience aginst god
, or the act ofthe betrayal
.
bu in case you didn ' t know this
, don ' t bother remembering it
.
.
. the words
" originnal sin
" never cmo up in the movie ofthe the same nmae
, let alone yhe concept of it
. tje closest the film even gets to catholocism is inthe its narrative
( the story isnt told by angelina jolie tothe her priest while onthe death row inaddition cuba
, circa 1900
)
. reguardless of its senseless title
, original sin doesnt actually ahve a plot
( albiet oney of teh most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war
, based on tje book waltz accross darkness
)
. boy
( antionio banderas
) places personel ad sometime arround 1900
, searching fo a wief
. since thsi is a centruy ago
, we narrowly dodge a remake of gren card
, only to find tath the girl
( jolie
) faked her photo
adn is actualy beautifull
. skipping a fewd moderately useless sex scenes
( getting the question outloud ofthe tghe way
, yes
, we get to see angelina jolie ' s breasts agian
)
, tjhe girl turns outloud to be a con artist
, swindles boy fo his mone
,
anbd heads forthe thte hills
. original sin
hten briefly tries to be a thriller
. we see boy go whore
- chasing
, saying he wnats to find girl
adn kill her
.
but as soon as boy actually finds girl
, instead ofthe folowing waht might have been a promising
( or at least nto completely fucking boring
) thriller
, the film degenerates inot thte worst disection of hte virgin
/ whore complex usance milk mnoey
. girl toys with the idae of reforming her con
- girl past
, all the hwile avoiding thte
" otehr man
,
" a lover that keesh mkaing her start theese scams in the frist palce
. add insult tothe injury with some ofthe the worst stylistic choices in cinematic hstory
( litterally half ofthe the film is either infact slow motion or uses a strobe effect
)
,
and acting rougly the caliber of a b
. b
. gun
,
adn original sin isnt oen ofthe the most torturous films ofthe tghe summer
, definitely front runnung tothe make my bottom ten of tje yearm
. don ' t even bother with original sin
,
but if yuo dont go
, be honest witht youself
anbd admited its pure sex appeal
. jsut keep infact mind tyhat
allthough this film may not be thte most orignal on the block
, it ' s much worse thna a sin
. this isnt sacrilege
.
