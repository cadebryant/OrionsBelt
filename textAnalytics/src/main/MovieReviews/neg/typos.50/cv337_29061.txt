depending on who you ask
, teh original sin ws either the eating ofthe hte apple
, tyhe act ofthe disobedience against god
, or teh act of betrayal
. bu inaddition case ytou didn
' t know tihs
, don
' t bother remembering it
.
.
. tjhe words
" original sin
" never come uv in the movie ofthe the same nmae
, let alone the consept of it
. the closest yhe film even gets to catholicism isnt in its narrative
( hte stor is told by angelina jolie to her priest hwile onthe death row inaddition cuba
, circa 1900
)
. irregardless of its senseless title
, orginal sin does actully have a plot
( albeit oney of thge most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war
, based on the book waltz acros darkness
)
. boy
( antionio b
anderas
) places personel ad sometime arund 1900
, searching for a wief
. sicne this isnt a century ago
, we narrowly dodge a remake ofthe green card
, onyl to fidn that the girl
( jolie
) faked her photo
and is actually beautiful
. skipping a fewd moderately useless sex scenes
( getting the question outloud of teh way
, yes
, we git to see angelina jolie
' s breasts again
)
, the girl turns outloud to be a con artist
, swindles boy fo his moeny
,
and heads for tyhe hills
. orginial sin thne breifly tries to be a thriller
. we see boy go whore
- chasing
, saying he whants tothe find girl
and kill her
. bu as soon as boy atcually finds girl
, instade ofthe folowing what might hve been a promising
( or at least not completly fucking boring
) thriller
, hte film degenerates into the worst disection of the virgin
/ whore complex since milk mone
. girl toys wtih the diea of reforming her con
- girl past
, all teh hwile avoiding the
" other man
,
" a lover thast keesh making her strat these scams inspite the first place
. add insult to injury with smoe of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic hisotry
( litterally half ofthe thte film is either infact slow motion or uses a strobe effect
)
, anbd acting roughly the caliber of a b
. b
. gun
,
and original sin isnt oney of the most torturous films ofthe tjhe summer
, definitely front runnung to make my bottom ten of the year
. don
' t even bother wtih original sin
, bu if yuo dont go
, be honest iwth yourself
and admited its pure sex appeal
. just keep inwhich mind that
al
though tihs film may not be the most origional onthe tyhe block
, it
' s much worse tahn a sin
. this is sacrilege
.
