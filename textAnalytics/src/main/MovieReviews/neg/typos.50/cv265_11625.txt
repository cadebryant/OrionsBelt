) is not offred a job
yet
, he isnt asked tothe simpley pick a jurny
. he accepts
. tjhe jury he selects wrok outloud well
and before long he is offred a job withthe the firm
. making his desision eazy isnt the fact tyhat nto only is he offered big mone
,
but a gorgeous apartment
. he convinces his wief
, mary ann
( charlize theron
) to mkae the move tothe new york
. the frist case given to him isnt a big test
; a
" winless
" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement
. thge charge wass health code violations
and kevin once again shows his skill anbd earns an acquittal
. his newyorker boss
and partner iin the firm
, john milton
( al pacino
) isnt quite empressed
and takes kevin under his wing
, explaning many of his philosophies on law
, women
and sex
,
and angles tyhe promise of a blissful
, wealthy life
. kevin
' s next case isnt a dream case
, given tothe him by milton himself
( much to the chagrin tothe his collegues
)
, defending a triple murder suspect who hasnt hadnt a history of problems iwth the law
.
al
though kevin
' s career is tkaing off
, his hmeo life isnt nto doing vyre well

and hallucinations ofthe peple turning into ghouls
, theri faces becoming horribly disfigured
. kevin does nto halp matters by dismissing his wife
. he does nto spend moreso tiem wiht her as he explains to milton thast he needs to spend as much tyme onthe the case as possible to git it over wtih
, thn focus all ofthe his attention onthe his wife
. not helping matters isnt yhe fact tath kevin isnt having idesa about a possible afair whith a sexy lawyer
( connie nielson
) alsot working wtih tjhe firm
. mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends omre time awya ffrom hmeo
. kevin evenhtually looses control ofthe his life
and has to institutionalize his wief
,
and gets disturbing news fomr his mother
( judith ivey
) about the mistery concerning teh idenity ofthe his father
. he aslo starts tothe loose control ofthe his case
. kevin learns that all ofthe his problems have been caused by tjhe work ofthe oney man
. that man is his boss
, mr
. milton
, a truely evil character who just may be tyhe devil himselv
. kevin must somehow confront milton
and thwart whatever diablical plan he hasnt inaddition tsore
.
but how do you defeat the devil
? why is it that most courtroom scenes in thte movies are absurd
? do filmmakers really believe that
" normal
" courtroom drama doesn
' t ift the bill anbd they have to juice them up
? thte courtroom scenes iin htis movie would never appen in a rela courtroom
, which wouldn
' t have been too bad if it weren
' t keanu reeves trying to pull it off
. i give reeves credit for trying hard
, bu throughout thte movie i never saw the kevin lomax character
, jsut an actr trying very hard tothe play kevin lomax adn coming uv short
. charlize theron defines the term
" over
- the
- top
" in her peformance as mary ann lomax
, a dissappointment inaddition contrast to her ogod performence iin
" 2 dyas infact yhe valley
"
. the only good performence inspite tghe movie isnt by al pacino
,
but i kept asking myself what hte heck he was doign in htis mess
? maybe he falt it would be interesting playing hte devil
,
and yuo can tell he is haveing funn doign so
, bu his skill as an atcor cannnot save tje poore performances adn lackluster scirpt tyhat surround him
. it
' s pretty st
andard stuff
, including the fatc thgat teh hotshot lawyer appears to be thge onyl competent person onthe the planet who cant do anything right in hte courtroom
. please read no further if you dont not watn the endig spoiled
,
but i have tothe git something off of my chest
. inaddition 1986 i rember watching a movie called
" wisdom
" with emilio estevez annd demi moore
, anbd the endig of that film doed yhe worst possible thnig that a movei coudl do
. waht i like tothe call
" guess whta
, it was all a dream
" scenaireo
. in
" wisdom
" tje two lead characters are killed at tje end
, onyl to ahev one of thge charachters
" wake up
" ffrom an apparent
and sday
" gosh
, i
' m glad thgat didn
' t relaly happen
!
"
. i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed wiht
. well
, the smae thnig happens inaddition
" the devils advocate
"
,
and
al
though arguments coudl be made surrounding whether it was ctually a dream
( perhaps milton went back iin timne tothe try a differnt route fo his plan
, since it failed
and he is the devil
)
,
but thge point isnt that teh last 90
% ofthe the film didn
' t happen
. i know it
' s a strech
, after all it is a movei
and nothing realy happenned
, bu i just get annoyed to get toyed wih liek thgat
. of course
, tje dream endig could almost be forgiven if thge storey that preceeds it ws at least an intresting oney
. as i recall
,
" wisdom
" wass a decent film
.
" yhe devil
' s advocate
" isnt nto
. teh devels advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton
