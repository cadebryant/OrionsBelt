a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously gilty child molester acquited
,
and shorly affter during the victory celebratuin gets offered an opportunity to sohw his prowess in new york city
. tjhe lawyer
, kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) is nto offred a job
yot
, he is asked tothe simply pick a jury
. he accepts
. the jurny he selects work outloud well
annd befoer long he isnt offered a job wih the firm
. makeing his decision easy isnt the fatc that not only isnt he offered big money
,
but a gorgeous appartmant
. he convinces his wief
, mary ann
( charlize theron
) to make the move tothe new york
. the frist case given to him is a big test
; a
" winless
" case conserning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement
. tghe charge was health code violations
and kevin once agina shows his skill
anbd earns an acquittal
. his newyorker boss
and partner infact tjhe firm
, john milton
( al pacino
) isnt quite empressed
anbd tkaes kevin under his wing
, explaning many of his philosophies onthe law
, women
adn sex
,
annd angles yhe promise ofthe a blissful
, wealthy life
. kevin ' s enxt case is a dream case
, given to him by milton himself
( much to the chagrin tothe his colleagues
)
, defending a triple muder suspect who has hadnt a hitsory ofthe problems with the law
.
although kevin ' s carrer isnt tkaing off
, his home life is nto donig vyer well
. mary ann isnt starting to ahve numerous problems
. she isnt experiencing severe depression over kevin ' s long hours
,
adn befor long isnt haveing horrible dreams
and hallucinations ofthe peopel turning inot ghouls
, theri faces becoming horribly disfigured
. kevin does not halp matters by dismissing his wife
. he doens not spend moreso tiome whith her as he explains to milton thyat he needs tothe spend as much time on the case as possable to get it over withthe
,
thn focuse all of his attention onthe his wief
. not helping matters is the fatc thast kevin is haveing ideas about a possible affair iwth a sexy lawyer
( connie nielson
) also working withthe the firm
. mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time awya ffrom hmeo
. kevin eventally looses control of his life
and hasnt tothe institutionalize his wief
,
and gets disturbing news from his mother
( judith ivey
) about yhe mistery concerning tyhe identity of his father
. he alsot starts to lose controll ofthe his case
. kevin lerans that all of his problems have been caused by yhe work ofthe one man
. tyhat man is his boss
, mr
. milton
, a truly evil charcter who jsut may be the devil himself
. kevin must somehow confront milton
adn thwart whatever diablical plan he hasnt inspite tsore
.
bu how do you defeat tyhe devil
? why is it that most courtroom scenes inspite teh movies are absurd
? do filmmakers relaly beleave that
" normal
" courtroom drama doesn ' t ift the bill
adn tehy have tothe juice them up
? the courtroom scenes iin thsi movie would never hppen in a real courtroom
, which wouldn ' t have been too bad if it weren ' t keanu reeves trying to pul it off
. i give reeves credit forthe trying hard
,
bu throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax charactor
, jstu an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax
annd coming uv short
. charlize theron defines the term
" over
- the
- top
" in her peformance as mary ann lomax
, a dissappointment infront contrast tothe her ogod performance in
" 2 dyas in tghe valley
"
. yhe onyl ogod peformance in the movei is by al pacino
,
but i kept asking mysef whta the heck he ws donig in this mess
? maybee he felt it woudl be interesting palying tyhe devil
,
and ytou cin tell he isnt hvaing funn doing so
,
bu his skill as an acotr cannot save the poor performances
adn lackluster scirpt that suround him
. it ' s pretty standart stuff
, including tjhe fatc thta teh hotshot lawyer appears to be the onyl competent person on yhe planet who can do anything right infront tghe courtroom
. please read noone furuther if ytou dont not want tghe endig spoiled
,
bu i ahev to git something off of my chest
. infact 1986 i remember watching a movie called
" wisdom
" with emilio estevez
and demi moore
,
and hte ending ofthe that film did the worst possibile thnig that a movei could do
. waht i like tothe call
" guess what
, it ws all a dream
" scenario
. in
" wisdom
" the two lead characters are killed at tyhe end
, onyl tothe have one of the characters
" wake up
" fomr an apprent
adn sday
" gosh
, i ' m glad that didn ' t really happen
!
"
. i considerd it inexcusable the way the audiance was toyed with
. well
, teh same thnig happens iin
" the devils advocate
"
,
and altho arguements coudl be made surrouding whether it was actually a dream
( perhaps milton went bcak iin time tothe try a diffrent route for his plan
, sicne it failed
and he isnt tjhe devil
)
,
but thte point is taht the last 90
% of the film didn ' t hapen
. i know it ' s a strech
, affter all it is a movei
adn nothing really happened
,
but i just get anoyed to git toyed with like that
. ofthe course
, the dream ending could alomst be forgiven if the story thast precedes it ws at least an intresting oney
. as i reacll
,
" wisdom
" wass a decent film
.
" the devil ' s advocate
" is nto
. tyhe devils advocate directed by taylor hackford john milton
