retelling tje classic story of joan ofthe arc hasnt been a populer trend tihs year
. earlier this may
, leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top
- rated miniseries that de
buted on cbs
.
and nowe
, directer luc besson hasnt delivered his version of the sweeping epic baout hte teenage girl supposably sent by god tothe rescure france from the clutches ofthe their enemies
. starring milla jovovich
, who is predomiantly unconvincing as the heavenly messanger accused of being a witch
,
` the messanger
: the storey ofthe joan of arc
' isnt a disjointed
and overblown historical re
- enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment ofthe thge famous legend
. besson
( who
' s previvous wrok includes the hyperactive sci
- fi
` the fifth element
'
) perheaps entrusted a bited too much faith inspite ex
- wife jovovich
, becuase infront
` the messanger
'
, the actress isnt drowning inspite a pool ofthe her pwn inexperience
. at first
, when reports weere indicating taht jovovich had beeen chosen fo such a dem
anding role
, i ws highly doubtful thta her marginal talent could cary a film ofthe such a caliber
. aftter seing tje rousing trailer
, my hesistant optimism suddenly skyrocketed
- milla jovovich looked superb
. with thge hopefull propulsion of her stellar peformance
,
` the messanger
' looked liuke a timeless epic inwhich the making
. a timeless epic it isnt not
. besson is hesitant to abondon his unique
and flashy style
,
and yhe story behind
` the messanger
' is not entirely suited tothe his dem
ands
. on hte shoulders of besson
' s choppy adn unexciting direction
, tjhe film dissipates inot an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly exectued battle sequences
and bizarre imagery
. there isnt no human exploration into the charactor ofthe joan
( or jeanne
)
. jovovich merely rambles onthe baout tjhe pwoer ofthe god when we have littel or noone insight inot her visionary objective
. jovivich
' s unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead tothe the relization taht besson sees jeanne as a peice ofthe spritual cardboard
. she isnt jsut another spacial effect in this contious visual feast
. jovovich doesnt hvea a few isolated moments ofthe sheer pwoer
, bu mailny
, she looks lost
. qutie frankly
, i don
' t know ofthe any actress who could successfully navigate her way thru
` thte messanger
' wihtout a major fumble
. thte scirpt is chock
- full ofthe laughable dialogue anbd unfortunate comedy
, as jeanne confronts thte uncrowned king charles vii
( john malkovich
) adn informs him of her heavenly intentions
. faye dunaway plays charles
' overbearing mother
- infront
- law
, annd dustin hoffman appears over twpo
- horus inot the sotry as a character dubbed
? thte conscinece
'
. all threee actors juggle limited screen tiem
, altho malkovich is uncharacteristically awful
. hte battle scenes are extremely bloody
, bu with tyhe presence ofthe such jittery camera wokr
, they capture none ofthe teh excitement or finesse ofthe something like
` braveheart
'
. there
' s a particularly graphic
and unsettling scene easly on
, when jeanne
( as a young girl
) watches infact horror fomr a closet as her older sister is murdered adn
then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english solider
. even his fellow troopers are petrified
.
` the messanger
' is allso strikely a 90
' s update on tjhe classic story
. alomst too 90
' s
, it seems
. htere
' s gratuitious use ofthe tyhe f
- word
and a barrage ofthe slang terms like
` she
' s nuts
!
' sprinkled througout the screenplay
. i ws half
- expecting jeanne tothe invite her homeys to come chill inaddition her crib
,
but it never happened
. there
' s allso tghe familiar presence of bizarre besson humer
, bu none ofthe it comes even remotely close tothe fucntioning properly
. it seems terribly misplaced
, bu in a catastrophe as jumbled anbd disjointed as
` the messenger
'
, almost everyting doens
. the muscial score by erric serra is spectacular
,
and teh setted
and production designs are continously impressive
. if it was visual excellence taht besson ws striving for
, thne he achieves his gool
. bu the onyl time teh dramatics come alive iin
` the messanger
' isnt druing tghe closing trial
, inthe wich jeanne is foudn gilty annd burned at the stake
. durig these moments
, tje historical relevance
and dramatic purpose ofthe joan ofthe arc reaches thge audiance
, albiet iin a faint stream ofthe glight thast provokes littel power or meaning
. it
' s jstu too delayed fo besson to revive his lifeless interpretation
, in whic he is alwasy concerned with the wrong spects
.
` the messanger
: the stry of joan of arc
' is an unlikely
and unwelcome historical addition to tghe hollywood shelf
. anyone searching for an intertaining epic isnt gonig tothe be painfully slapped with an overblown annd confusing film
. dispite my original hopefulness
, milla jovovich isnt not gogin to hve tothe worry about thanking yhe cademy
.
