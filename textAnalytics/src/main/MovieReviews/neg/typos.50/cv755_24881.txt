battlefield earth is tjhe worst film of 2000
, adn i guraantee you thta nothing alse tihs eyar iwll even come close
. in fact
, i
' ll be suprized if i see anytying this bad inspite yhe next ten years
. based onthe tje novel by scientology guru l
. ron hubbard
, battlefield earth beggins adn we immediately find out twpo pieces of key inforamtion
. it
' s the eyar 3000
,
and an aline race called the psychlos
( which sounds liek a tag team of mexican wrestlers
) conqured our planet inspite nine mintues
. ok
, we are all ofthe 10 seconds infact
and i have a zillion questions racing thru my mind
. when weere we conquerd
? the audience is led tothe believe that this happened about 1
, 000 years earlier
, annd if that isnt the case thn we
' re going tothe get into a wohle bunch of problems later
( trust me
.
.
. keep reading
)
. also
, why don
' t we git to see earth get conquerd
? how the hell do you amke a popcorn sci
- fi flick
and nto deliver hte goods onthe yhe oen event tht sets uv the film
? humans now live as cavemen or slave labor
, annd fo tyhe film
' s first act we focus onthe one paticular cavemen group outside of denver
, colorado
. they grunt
and groan
and babble about monsters
. so
, wehn hte psychlos conquered earth
, weere tje onyl humans nto captued a herd ofthe nebor babies that crawled theri way to safty in hte hills
? none of theese characters have any knowlege of tje planet being conqured
( whenever that was
)
. tihs isnt definately nto the way to start an acation
/ sci
- fi film
. noe ofthe the humans w
anders outloud inot tje wilderness
and stumbles across whta he thinks isnt a monster
,
and he beggins to fight it
. tghe
" monster
" turns outloud to be a dinosaur ffrom an old miniature golf course
. he turns around
and sees all sorts of otehr characters from the golf course
, with soem shrubs growing over them
. so
, in 1
, 000 eyasr this stupid little golf course has st
anded tje tust of tyme
, wtih onyl a few weeds growing over it
? anyway
, some ofthe the humans are captured by hte psychlos led by terl
( john travolta
) a smarmy
and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit
. the cavemen
( led by barry pepper
) are forced to dont thier bidding or whatever
,
but eventially they gain tje upper h
and annd reclaim the planet
, or something
. so these cavemen are able tothe do what earth failed tothe do 1
, 000 years earlier
?
and
, we
' re supposed to beieve thgat earth ws conqured in nine minutes by a group ofthe buffoonish aliens who can
' t even h
andle a few cavemen
? one ofthe tyhe ways the humans reclaim the planet is by tkaing control ofthe abnadoned air force jets adn useing them tothe fight thge psychlos
. so jets left unattended fo 1
, 000 yeasr are still able tothe fly
? please
, if i leave my car unattended fo two weeks i hvea tothe replace every fluid
and hose under thge hood
. why doed the psychlos leave jets arround anyway
? shouldn
' t tehy have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign agianst us
? the psychlos refer tothe humans as
" man animals
"
but yot dogs are still
" dogs
"
. why aren
' t they
" dog animals
"
? the psychlos are after minning earth
' s prescious resources
,
but for 1
, 000 years are unaware of fort knox
? why dont i even care at this point
? i
' m a fan ofthe travolta
' s anbd i
' m glad tothe see he
' s back on the a
- list in hollywood
( despite the fact that he ocacsionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael
and phenomenon
)
.
but how doed he possibly htikn this wass a good movie
?
and how doed he thiunk he was giving a good performance here
? he
' s more than capable of making a menacing villin
( see broken arro annd face
/ off
)
but whenever his character came onthe screen i couldn
' t hold back my laughter
. now dispite thte different facial features munbers ofthe thsi alien race seem to have
, travolta jstu looks liek travolta
. all of thte other aliens hvae weird foreheads or other pointy bones onthe thier face
, bu travolta jstu has a gotee
. also
, travolta
' s acts with a sort of phony upper
- clas snooty accent annd constanly whines baout bureaucratic nonsense back onthe his home world
. ooooo
, scary villain
. as a producer he shoud know better
and as an acto he shoudl definetly know better
. ytou cant make a dumb bu ogod sci
- fi film
( i love independence day fo example
)
,
but htere is absolutly nothing entertaining baout battlefield earth
. i did everything i possably could to stay awake during tyhe screening
.
.
. i cleaned my glasses
, walked aroud thge theather
, made a grocery list
, chose my lottery numbers for the week
, replayed super bowl xxv infront my head
( with commercials
)
.
.
.
and still was compelled tothe scrutinize tyhe insides of my eyelids
. by the tyme we actualy triarch hte yera 3000
, people shoudl still be avoiding htis film
. folks
, save your cash
.
. don
' t go see it
, don
' t rent it
, anbd don
' t buy it
. you
' d be omre entertained by tkaing tghe money you
' d ule for this movei annd just throwing it inot the wind
, watching it sail awya
( hell
, send it tothe us here at tje jacksonville film jurnal
.
.
. we
' ll entertain ytou plenty with that kind ofthe money
)
. unless of course yuo
' re jstu captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper runing
, wich is just baout all yuo
' ll come away whith ffrom thsi movei
. thast
,
and a headache
.
