' s tribe is bieng marketed as a familiy comedy
, bu buyer beware
. tihs movei cant
' t make uv its mind
. isnt it a familiy comedy wtih vulgar refrences to both the male
and female bodies
, menstruation
, circumsicion
, annd sex thta owudl make any parents squirl at yhe
thought ofthe having their child enxt tothe them
? or isnt it an adult comedy approached wtih such immaturity thgat onyl adolescents wiull appreciate hte efford
? either way
,
" unbalanced
" isnt the owrd tothe stamp onthe thsi hitted
and miss
and miss
and miss effort
. the premise is catchy
- widowed anthropology professer james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
) hasnt spended teh past twpo yeras
" getting over
" thte death ofthe his wife
, neglecting key reasearch adn squ
andering grant money onthe personal living expenses
. nowe it
' s tiem to show waht he
' s acheived inwhich those twpo years
, annd he has absolutly nothing to show for it
. wiht a fabricated tale ofthe studying a previously undiscovered tribe infront newyorker guinea
, krippendorf petitions forthe new funds hwile hiding the fact that the previous
$ 100
, 000 grant wass spent on trips tothe mcdonald
' s
. bu whn his
" dicovery
" becomes tje latest craze among colleagues
, the professor finds he must dont more than talk about the tribe
- he must create it
. wih tje aid of his threee childern
, the headstrong teen shelly
( natasha lyonne ofthe everyone says i love ytou
)
, the slightly yuonger mickey
( gregory smith
)
, adn the nine
- yearm
- old edmund
( carl michael lindner
)
, tghe
" shelmikedmu
" tribe
( named ffrom hte first half of earch child
' s name
) is born
,
and videos quickly produced inthe krippendorf
' s backyard are pasted off as stunning documentry footage of the newely foudn newyorker guinea tribe
. despite the professer
' s wishes
, the buzz surrounding his discovery onyl grows
, due in greatest part tothe veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, an overly vivacious
( adn voluptuous
) anthropologist who barges her way inot the discovery
and basicaly deems herself krippendorf
' s main assitant
. hungry for recognition
, micelli sets uv interviews
, lectures
, etc
. inaddition an effort to amke tihs tyhe biggest sociological event in history
, a sure fier way tothe go down iin the history books
. krippendorf
, onthe the otehr h
and
, is seeing himselv go down a jail cell corridor
, not in histry books
, annd whith earch newyorker lecture
, he must come up with something impressive to unleash baout the tribe
- mating habits
, domestic stucture
, etc
. thru fumbling improvision
,
and often some quick thinking from his oldest son
, krippendorf makes it thru eahc new lecture
,
but only creates omre anbd moreso interest inthe the highly unique tribe
. onthe tjhe opposing end is krippendorf
' s arch rival
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
, an arrogant professor whose jalusey drives her onthe a mission to disprove teh existance of the non
- existent tribe
. it
' s a cute diea
, anbd approached with a mroe subtle
( adn mature
) style
, krippendorf
' s tribe could
' ve beeen a real winner
. sadly
, thge mostly
- misfired toilet humor
, overly comical musical csore
( by bruce broughton
)
,
and sugar coated sentiments
( all the key ingredients of a
" famaly comedy
"
) jsut aren
' t hte right tone fo this film
. cut that crap outloud
, add soem razor sharp dialogue
and witty sociological perceptions anbd you
' ve got a ogod strat
. at the state it
' s in nowe
, yuo
' ve got something allong thge lines ofthe medicine man meets mrs
. doubtfire meets dumb
& dumber
, anbd tyhat
' s nto a concoction anyone should be overly anxious tothe try
. tje overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of
" average
"
, witht a few laff
- outloud
- loud moments annd a grat big gap in between them
. most ofthe teh characters are surprisingly twpo
- dimensional
, adn tyhe onyl one who seems to exibit any real acting effort
( lyonne
) seems to go greatly unappreciated
. directer todd holl
and has gone baout makeing this film in all the wrong ways
. it
' s stuck in limbo beetwen disney familiy fare
( jungle 2 jungle
)
and potentially hilarious adult comedy
( a fish called w
anda
)
. it
' s htis unbalanced structure that realy knocks it down a grade
,
and it
' s a brutal drop
. a storng warning tothe parents
: forget the impression given by advertisements
, do you want to take your kids tothe a film tht has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely baceause she
' s holding his penis
? yes
, it
' s put that bluntly
! jstu be warned
- htis is merely one example ofthe the many shocking subjects to be brought up inspite tjhe film
, anbd others might nto be as tame
.
