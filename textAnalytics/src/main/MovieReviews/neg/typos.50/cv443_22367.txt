at firt i was intrigued by tje strange cast
and odd creatures onthe thge galaxy quest trailer
,
bu tyhat wass before i saw the film
. now my veiw hasnt completelyl changed
. it ' s tiem to embrace forthe impact
, because this is a veyr bumpy ride
. teh stoy beggins wih teh cast of galaxy quest includng
: jason nesmith
( tim allen
)
, alexander dane
( alan rickman
)
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
) signing autographs at a convention
. they meet fans who dress up in costumes
, fans who worship the ground htey walk onthe
,
and a group ofthe aliens called thermians who beleave that they are tjhe ultimate saviors against yhe dreaded aline collony lead by sarris
( robin sachs
)
. of course htey are unaware ofthe tihs unitl htey actually beign performing their duties
,
and meet the ugly aliens themselves
. thus beggins the long adventure to help sive tjhe thermians
. the movei plays like a really bad star trak episode
, in fact it ' s worse
. i don ' t even think trekkies iwll appreciate this weak spoof
, becasue quite frankly it ' s jstu nto funny
. all thte jokes are basicly collected observations from thge sories
. one such continious joke involves a simple crew memeber who believes he wiull dieu infact spoace
, baceause noone extra onthe the tv show ever lives
, as proven in tghe star trak sories
. creative jokes like thsi may seem liek a clever idea
,
but nto when they are unsed to death
. a person cant only tkae so much
. we do nto need tothe be tortured
, especialy when you hvea tothe pay forthe it
. it ' s preety bad wehn even tim allen isnt pitiful
. it ' s not like i expeced an oscar worthy performance form him
,
but a few laughs would hvae beeen helpful
. speaking ofthe acting
, 2 fine talents were wasted as well
. sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage
, well at least it worked
. it ' s pretty bad whn the only entertaining value ofthe thte film isnt cleavage
. it jsut shows ytou how disgraceful tje film really is
. alan rickman
however was not so lucky
. affter his last hit
( dogma
) he embarrasses himself by doign this sloppy mess
. it ' s jstu a shame tothe see talented actors
and actresses throw thier abillity away
. when the film couldn ' t get any worse
, thankfully soem nice special effects pop uv
. liuke many big blockbusters
( armageddon
, hte haunting to name a fewd
) they rely heavily onthe effects tothe help boost the film ' s box office results
. times it works
,
bu unforetunately we ahev to shell outloud hard earned moeny
and suffer thru thsi junk
. wehn will it stpo
? i am getting tired ofthe being suckered inot seing such trash
. it may look fine
and dandy
,
bu we ened to at least have a story
. is tath too much tothe ask
? obviously it is
. wehn galaxy quest finally ends
, it litterally kresh lands
. aside from tyhe impressive looking creatures fomr indutrial light
annd magic
, it ' s an embarrasment tothe thge cast
,
adn it ' s embarrasing to the science fiction genre
. it ' s not thte least bit fun
, nor ws it intertaining
. the onyl place where htis movie belongs isnt tothe infinity
and beyond
.
