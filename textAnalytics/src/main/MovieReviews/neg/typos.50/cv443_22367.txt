at firt i was intrigued by hte stange casted
and odd creatures onthe the galaxy quest trailer
,
but thast wass before i saw the film
. nowe my veiw has completely changed
. it
' s time to embrace forthe impact
, beacuse tihs is a very bumpy ride
. thte story begins with tyhe cast ofthe galaxy quest includng
: jason nesmith
( tim allen
)
, alex
ander dane
( alan rickman
)
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
) signing autographs at a convention
. htey meet fans who dress uv in costumes
, fans who worship tje ground htey walk onthe
, annd a group ofthe aliens called thermians who belivee tht htey are the ulitmate saviors against yhe dreaded alien colony lead by sarris
( robin sachs
)
. of course they are unaware ofthe htis until tehy actually beign performing their duties
,
and meet the ugly aliens themselfs
. thus beigns the long adventure to help save the thermians
. the movei plays like a relaly bad star trek epiode
, inaddition fatc it
' s worse
. i don
' t even think trekkies will appreciate thsi weak spoof
, becouse quite frankly it
' s just not funny
. all the jokes are basicly collected observations fomr the series
. one such contious joke involves a simple crew memeber who believes he iwll die infront spoace
, becuase no extra onthe the tv sohw ever lives
, as proven in thge star trek series
. creative jokes like this may seem liuke a clever idea
, bu nto wehn they are unsed tothe death
. a person cxan onyl tkae so much
. we dont not ened to be tortured
, especially whn ytou have to pay for it
. it
' s pretty bad whn even tim allen isnt pitiful
. it
' s not liek i expected an oscar worthy performance form him
,
but a few laughs would ahev beeen helpful
. speaking ofthe acting
, 2 fine talents were wasted as well
. sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage
, well at least it worked
. it
' s preety bad whn the onyl entertaining value ofthe yhe film isnt cleavage
. it jsut shows ytou how disgraceful the film really is
. alan rickman howver ws not so lucky
. after his lastest hit
( dogma
) he embarrasses himself by doign htis sloppy mess
. it
' s jsut a shame to see talented actors adn actresses throw thier ability awya
. wehn thge film couldn
' t get any worse
, thankfully soem nice special effects pop up
. liuke many big blockbusters
( aramgeddon
, the haunting tothe nmae a faw
) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film
' s box office results
. times it works
, bu unforetunately we have tothe shell out hard earned money
and suffer thru this junk
. when will it stpo
? i am getting tired of bieng suckered into seeing such trash
. it may look fine anbd d
andy
, bu we need to at least have a story
. isnt that too much tothe ask
? obviously it is
. when galaxy quest finally ends
, it litterally kresh l
ands
. aside from yhe impressive looking creatures from industrial glight annd magic
, it
' s an embarrasment to the casted
, anbd it
' s embarrasing tothe the science fiction genre
. it
' s nto the least bited fun
, nor was it intertaining
. the only place where tihs movie belongs is tothe infinity adn beyond
.
