it ws with a huge lack of something to dont that i decided tothe watch this on good old upn onthe sunday afternoon
, whn tjhe only ogod thigns on tv are teh second
- rate movies htey sohw
( some are ogod
: they showed
" total recall
" befor tihs noe
)
. if you knwo me
, i think seagal is probably thte most boring acation star tothe ever live
.
and thsi includes keanu reeves
. what do i hate about seagal
? i hate how he uses one facial expression forthe every single threatning
and non
- threatning situation
( tjhe squint
)
. i hate those scenes in eveyr movei where he goes arround
, bullying people up
, saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold
' s hairpiece in
" boogie nights
.
" i descize how he never gets a bruise in any ofthe his fights
. i hite how eveyr single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he annd tjhe chief villain
. i hate his non
- satirical messages
( inwhich tjhe begginning of this noe
, he slaps on a qoute from arthur miller
, whitch hasnt nothing to do whith the film
, exept it
' s baout brooklyn where this film takes palce
)
.
and i hite how he
' s so narcissisitc that he thinks taht he can actualyl fucking sing
( during the end credits
, he has a ogod old hill billy rock tune sung anbd penned by him
)
. sure
, thte guy
' s probably a nice guy inthe person
( i actually foudn him vrey non
- threatning when he ws on letterman nto too long ago
)
.
but tghe guy mkaes worse films than reagan did
. so what
' s yhe plot of thsi shit
- terpiece
? well
.
.
. something baout him trying to catch a stupid
- ass crook
( william forsythe
) who shot
and killed his partner inaddition broad daylight
. i couldn
' t believ how bad this scene ws
- the guy was conveniently wih his family so we get hte maximum emotional effect
( ahem
!
)
.
and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him befor he tookover off
. i
' m sory
, did anyone ever hear ofthe concealing oen
' s self
? so in comes ex
- brooklynite seagal
, who dedicates his life to catching htis guy
. adn i jsut wished he had caught him inspite the beginning
,
then ended the film
.
but noooo
, this drags on
, as he bullies forsythe
' s familiy members
( including a stupid bar
- owner
, annd none otehr thna gina gershon as his other bar
- owner sister
)
. anbd forsythe more than once threatens his family
. at oen point
, he actulaly comes tothe their hous adn stalks them liuke a non
- threatening nicholson in
" teh shineing
"
( complete withthe them all hiding in teh bathroom
, bu whith an added bonus of oen girl conveniently loosing her kool anbd screaming tothe give them away
)
. seagal paints himself as a lovable person
, with a son
,
and a fiancee
. he even shows him hanging with his son
, checking uv on his homework
,
and
then about to take him out for a bited of
" catch
,
" wehn he
' s conveniently called away on assignment
. i dunno about you
,
but palying
" catch
" witht seagal was oney of my childhood nightmares
. he alsot shows him as taht bad
- ass he wnats tothe be
, with scenes of him bullying crooks around
, adn tkaing out peopel who are stupid anough to attack him even aftter he
' s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats wiht a pool cue
. serves them right
. this film
, as smoe of his do
, has an intresting supporting casted ofthe actors who are actually talented
,
but don
' t appear to be in tihs film
. i already maintioned gina gershon
( who
' s pretty horrible inspite tihs noe
)
, as well as william forsythe
, who over
- acts terribly
. i know this guy cant ect
: he was awsome inthe
" raising arizona
" as goodman
' s partner inspite crime
. bu he
' s jstu awful here
. jerry orbach gives the onyl credible performence in yhe film as yhe polical chief who checks uv onthe segal affter thigns ahve gone down
. why isnt he tjhe onyl one who gives a good performance
? well
, becuase his role isnt small enought anbd sporadic enough to nto tarnish his credibility
. he seems to be in here jsut to give it a kool
" lew adn order
" feeling
( even if it
' s nto a
" cool
" feeling
)
.
and inwhich cameos are b
- rated erotic
- thriller
- cinemax
- style stars
, shannon whirry
( as
" terry malloy
,
" which is omre ofthe a bad joke than a clever one
)
and a
thena massey
. oh
! annd
" er
"
' s julliana margiulles has two scenes
.
" out forthe justice
" jsut proves once again thast american acation films just suck
. i know that there
' s such a ogod hting as ogod action
- he
' s called john woo
.
but if you
' re in the mood fo some good ood no
- brainer
, fun
- yot
- dumb action
, don
' t bother watching htis
. it
' s so stupid that it
' s boring
.
