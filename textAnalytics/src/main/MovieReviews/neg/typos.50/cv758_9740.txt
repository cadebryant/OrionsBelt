it was wtih a huge lack of something to dont that i desided to watch this onthe ogod ood upn on sunday afternoon
, wehn thge onyl good thigsn on tv are thte second
- rate movies they sohw
( soem are good
: they showed
" total recall
" befoer thsi noe
)
. if you nkwo me
, i think seagal is propably the most boring acation star tothe ever live
.
and this includes keanu reeves
. what dont i hite about seagal
? i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatning
and non
- threatening situation
( the squint
)
. i hite thsoe scenes inwhich eveyr movie where he goes aroud
, bullying peple up
, saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent mroe fake than burt reynold ' s hairpiece inwhich
" boogie nights
.
" i descize how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights
. i hite how every single plot twist leads tothe just a melodramatic fight between he
annd the cheif villain
. i hate his non
- satirical messages
( inthe tjhe begginning ofthe this one
, he slaps onthe a qoute from arthur miller
, whic has nothing tothe do wih hte film
, exept it ' s about brooklyn where htis film takes place
)
.
adn i hite how he ' s so narcsisistic that he thinks that he cin actually fucking sing
( durring tjhe end credits
, he hasnt a ogod old hill billy rock tune sung
annd penned by him
)
. sure
, the guy ' s propably a nice guy in person
( i actualy found him vrey non
- threatning when he was onthe letterman not too long ago
)
.
bu the guy makes worse films than reagan did
. so what ' s the plot ofthe thsi shit
- terpiece
? well
.
.
. something baout him trying tothe catch a stupid
- ass crook
( william forsythe
) who shot
adn killed his partner in broad daylight
. i couldn ' t beleive how bad thsi scene was
- tjhe guy wass conveniently withthe his famaly so we git hte maximum emotional effect
( ahem
!
)
.
and forsythe even said some stupid lines tothe him befoer he took off
. i ' m sorry
, doed anyone ever hear ofthe concealing oen ' s self
? so in comes ex
- brooklynite seagal
, who dedicates his life to catching this guy
.
and i jsut wished he had caught him in the beginnig
,
thn ended the film
.
but noooo
, thsi drags on
, as he bullies forsythe ' s famaly munbers
( including a stupid bar
- owner
,
and none other than gina gershon as his other bar
- owner sister
)
.
and forsythe moreso than once threatens his family
. at oen point
, he actually comes tothe theri house
anbd stalks them like a non
- threatening nicholson in
" tjhe shineing
"
( complet with them all hiding in thge bathroom
,
but witht an added bonus of noe girl conveniently loosing her kool
anbd screaming tothe give them away
)
. seagal paints himself as a lovable person
, with a son
,
and a fiancee
. he even shows him hanging with his son
, checking uv onthe his hmoework
,
and
then about to tkae him out forthe a bit ofthe
" catch
,
" whn he ' s conveniently called awya onthe assignment
. i dunno baout you
,
but playing
" catch
" iwth seagal wass one of my childhood nightmares
. he also shows him as that bad
- ass he whants to be
, wih scenes ofthe him bullying crooks arund
,
annd tkaing out people who are stupid enough to attack him even affter he ' s unarmed a chineese guy swinging bats witht a pool cue
. serves them right
. this film
, as some of his dont
, has an interesting supporting cast ofthe actors who are atcually talented
,
bu don ' t appear to be infact this film
. i alredy maintioned gina gershon
( who ' s preety horrible in this noe
)
, as well as william forsythe
, who over
- acts terribly
. i know tihs guy cant ect
: he was awesome in
" raising arizona
" as goodman ' s partner infront crime
.
but he ' s jsut awful here
. jerry orbach gives thge only credible performence in the film as yhe police chief who checks up on segal aftter things haev gone down
. why isnt he the only noe who gives a good performance
? well
, beccause his role is small enough
and sporatic anough to nto tarnish his credibility
. he seems to be infront here jstu tothe give it a cool
" lew
and order
" feeling
( even if it ' s not a
" kool
" feeling
)
.
and inthe cameos are b
- rated erotic
- thriller
- cinemax
- stlye stars
, shannon whirry
( as
" terry malloy
,
" which isnt more of a bad joke than a clever one
)
adn athena massey
. oh
!
anbd
" er
" ' s julliana margiulles hasnt twpo scenes
.
" outloud for justice
" jstu proves once agian that american acation films just suck
. i nkow thta htere ' s such a good thnig as good action
- he ' s called john woo
.
bu if you ' re inwhich the mood for some ogod old noone
- brainer
, fun
-
yot
- dumb action
, don ' t bother watching tihs
. it ' s so stupid that it ' s boring
.
