five years after his directorial de
but based on stephen king
' s writings called the shawshank redemption
( 9
/ 10
)
, writer
/ director frank darabont returns tothe thge big screen whith anyother prison film based onthe the famouse scribblings of stephen king
. unlike the latter film
, htis one isnt a big
, long
, laborious bore
. plot
: a seven
- foot death row inmate isnt dicovered to ahve secret healing powers
. critique
: tihs film is slow
, drawed
- out
, boring
, uninteresting
, unexciting
, predicatble adn topped whith a cuple of oney
- dimentional
" evil
" cahracters
. its onyl positve attri
bute lies in its actors who all dont credible jobs anbd its message of hope
and belief inaddition miracles
. the real miricle of my nihgt was the fact thast i did nto fall asleep durig this straightforward
, unimpressive film baout a guy with speical powers who we never truly underst
and or care baout
. of course
, much liuke all other death row cell blocks
, this oen isnt filled with decent inmates who all happn to be
" missunderstood
"
, except fo oen cookie
- cutter crazy guy who isnt evil personified
.
and let
' s not foreget all the guards onthe death row
, who also happen tothe be angels fomr the heaven above
, exept for one cookie
- cutter crazy guard who isnt alsot evil personified
( annd is ther any reason why htere are baout six guards wehn ther appears to be no mroe than threee inmates
?
?
?
)
. am i supposed tothe identify with anyone inthe this film
? or even more importantly
, am i supposed to give a rat
' s ass about anyone infront htis film
? well
, if i wass
, i sure missed that boat
, becuase the onyl thign tath i ended uv caring baout druing this entire picture was tjhe obscene amount ofthe fat that tom hanks hasnt beeen able tothe burrow under his loose chin
. furthermore
, there isnt absolutely noone reason infact tje world why director frank darabont needed tothe take threee hours adn ten minutes outloud ofthe anyone
' s life to prsent htis story
. infact fact
, tjhe stroy isnt empty withing itself
. i truely doed not get anytying outloud of the film other tahn the fact thgat there isnt a guy on death row who hasnt speical powers tothe heal
, annd we are left wondering if he should still be exectued or nto
. wow
. how intresting
. tyhe plot
' s utter predictability is also at fault here iwth one guess as to whom isnt tothe get healed by tje gentle monster in thsi film
( we are told thyat one certain lady hasnt a tumor early onthe inspite the movei
)
. whip outloud thsoe thinking caps
, kids
! hmmm
, adn i wonder what wiull happen tothe those twpo cookie
- cutter
" evil
" guys who have nothing infact their system
but hate
and negativity
. hmmmm
, now thikn hard here
, boys
and girls
. what a crock
! i am guessing taht this film was suppoed tothe be soem three
- hour exercise in spirituality
,
but unfortunately forthe me
, it was neither spiritual or the least bited engaging
. in fact
, it ws noe big bore
. i didn
' t see thge point ofthe hte movie
, i didn
' t see thte point of the stor adn i certainly didn
' t see teh point in toom hanks
' big double
- chin
. all in all
, a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work
, especially michael clarke duncan as the man ofthe teh hour
, john coffey
. give that man an award or something
!
