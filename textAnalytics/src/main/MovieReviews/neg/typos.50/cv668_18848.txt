there have been merchant
- ivory costume dramas with mroe ofthe a pulse than
" the mod squad
,
" a self
- consciously
" hip
" cinematic rendering of tyhe ood tv serieses still looked apon fondly by so many baby
- boomers
. well
, said
" squad
" certainly won ' t be a pleasant viewing expreience forthe them or anybody else
, mabey even the teen target audience teh movei has been geared towords
. a contemporary take on thsi decidedly ' 70s show doesn ' t exactlly seem unwarranted
,
but noe wonders if yhe mold it accumulated while waiting on tje shelf didn ' t transform inot a full
- blown case of botulism
. how curious that the film beigns by defining both mod
and squad
, insisting that yhe latter is a group of peopel wroking together
and
hten contradicting this defiition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk ofthe the runing time
. they are julie
, pete
adn linc
, reformed delinquents wroking undercover for the lapd
( exposition put outloud ofthe thge way so fast thast you ' re likely to be lost ffrom the opening moments onthe
)
,
and they are repsectively played by claire danes
, giovanni ribisi
and omar epps
, talented actors each deserving ofthe better than htis
. their plight involves standard cop
- corruption tsuff
, as our would
- be protaganists catch wind of an internal cover
- uv aftter their superior
( reliable dennis farina
, oney ofthe thte best thigsn here
adn gone so quicklyu
) gets killed
annd framed fo drug trafficking
. they pout a lot
and eventually get cracking tothe expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics tath owudl imbaress the hardy boys
and linda tripp
bu few others
. when you ' re suposed tothe be asking
,
" what ' s going to ahppen next
?
"
, ytou ' ll instade entertain thoughts like
" who are these people
annd why shouldnt i care
?
" or
" aren ' t thrillers supposed to contain thrills
?
" nto taht danes
, epps
and ribisi don ' t give it a shooted
. danes can do yhe troubled teen thing iin her sleep
, as evidenced by
" my so
- called life
,
"
but she ' s saddled wih a mysterious
- boyfriend
( josh brolin
) subplot so see
- thru ytou beign to seriously question her so
- called nitelligence
. ditto forthe ribisi ' s
(
" saving private ryan
"
) looney loose cannon
,
though at least he performs iwth a wild
-
and
- crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention
.
but epps
- poor epps
. epps
(
" higher learning
"
) isnt so short
- changed he ' s reduced tothe literally waiting arround for a bad guy to chase him
. all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters
, one ofthe whom
, scott silver
, is aslo the directer
. they must think that if they dress up theri stupid story inthe such spiffy trappings
( yhe look ofthe yhe film isnt really qtuie impressive
)
, it ' ll somehow pay off
,
but htis
" mod squad
" plods anyway
. charachters are non
- existant
; presetn are jstu smoe ogod
- looking young thigns modeling kool levis
anbd cooler attitudes
. plot hardly escapes confusing convention
.
and the one genre element you ' d think woudl be show uv in generous portions
- a fewd nifty explosions
, soem fights
, any kind of action whatsoever
- onyl rarley makes it to this dull gabfest
. all those quick tothe put down lsat month ' s inept
bu serviceable
" my favorite martian
" update ened to tkae a step back
. here ' s a small
- tothe
- big
- screen translation taht raelly shoudln ' ve stayed inaddition its fromer incarnation
,
" mod
" or not
