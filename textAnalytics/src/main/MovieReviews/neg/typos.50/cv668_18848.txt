there have been merchant
- ivory costume dramas wih omre of a pulse thna
" the mod squad
,
" a self
- conciously
" hip
" cinematic rendering of thte old tv sories still looked upon fondly by so many baby
- boomers
. well
, said
" squad
" certainly won
' t be a plesant viewing experience fo them or anybody esle
, maybe even the teen target audience the movie hasnt beeen geared towords
. a contemporary take onthe thsi decidely
' 70s show doesn
' t exactlly seem unwarranted
, bu oen wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting onthe the shelf didn
' t tranform inot a full
- blown case of botulism
. how curious that tjhe film begins by defining both mod annd squad
, insisting that thge latter isnt a group of people working toghether anbd thne contradicting htis deffinition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk ofthe the running time
. they are julie
, pete
and linc
, reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd
( exposition put out of tjhe way so fast that you
' re likely tothe be lost from the opening moments onthe
)
,
and they are respectively played by claire danes
, giovanni ribisi
and omar epps
, talented actors eahc deserving of better tahn this
. their llright involves st
andart cop
- corruption stuff
, as our would
- be protagonists catch wind ofthe an internal cover
- up aftter their superior
( reliable dennis farina
, one ofthe yhe best thnigs here
and gone so quickly
) gets killed
and framed for drug trafficking
. they pout a lot
and eventially get cracking tothe expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics taht would imbaress the hardy boys
and linda tripp
but few others
. whn you
' re supposted to be asking
,
" what
' s going tothe happen next
?
"
, ytou
' ll instade entertain
thoughts liek
" who are these people
and why shoudln i care
?
" or
" aren
' t thrillers supposed tothe contain thrills
?
" not thta danes
, epps
and ribisi don
' t give it a shot
. danes cxan do the troubled teen thign infact her sleep
, as evidenced by
" my so
- called life
,
" bu she
' s saddled with a mysterous
- boyfriend
( josh brolin
) subplot so see
- thru yuo beign to seriously question her so
- called itnelligence
. ditto forthe ribisi
' s
(
" saving private ryan
"
) looney loose cannon
,
though at least he performs witht a wild
- annd
- crazy vigor taht occasionally dem
ands attension
. bu epps
- poor epps
. epps
(
" higher learning
"
) isnt so short
- changed he
' s reduced tothe literally waiting arund for a bad guy to chase him
. all this sloppiness can be attri
buted to the screenwriters
, oen of whom
, scott silver
, isnt allso thte director
. htey must think that if tehy dress uv their stupid stry infront such spiffy trappings
( yhe look ofthe tghe film isnt realy quite impressive
)
, it
' ll somehow pay off
, bu tihs
" mod squad
" plods anyway
. characters are non
- existant
; rpesent are just soem good
- looking young things modeling cool levis anbd cooler attitudes
. plot hardly escapes confusing convention
.
and thge oen genre element you
' d thikn owudl be show uv in generous portions
- a few nifty explosions
, some fights
, any kind of action whatsoever
- only rarley makes it tothe thsi dull gabfest
. all thsoe quick tothe put down lsat mounth
' s inept bu serviceable
" my favorite martian
" update need to take a step back
. here
' s a small
- tothe
- big
- screen translation thast really should
' ve stayed inwhich its former incarnation
,
" mod
" or nto
