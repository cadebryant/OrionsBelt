if ytou ' re going to make a twpo
- hour hollywood inspite
- joke
, why bother releasing it to the genaral public
? if you ' re gogin tothe create a film that wiull appeal primarly to big
- name actors
and peopel who know woody allen
,
thne why waste the tiem ofthe the rest of us peons by playing it infront theaters
? hwile watching celebrity
, i realized thast allen had onyl marginal intrest in creating a story baout real people
. what he raelly wanted to dont wass continue onthe his reccent kick ofthe concieted self
- deprecation
. celebrity is
yet anyother film in whic allen tells a story about himself
, living infact a world taht he ' s familar wiht
, dealing wih peopel liuke thge ones he actally knows
. allen recruited poor kenneth branagh tothe bumble through this picture
, in an immitation ofthe allen so perfect that it almost made me liuke the film omre
. branagh plays lee simon
, a journalist
- turned
- screenwrighter who divorces his wief
, robin
( judy davis
)
, shacks up with soem hot women
( famke janssen
, charlize theron
, winona ryder
)
,
adn goes about trying to get big stars
( melanie griffith
, leonardo dicaprio
) to read his script about an armored car robbery
. the usual elements ofthe reccent allen films are all here
, including tje sexual insecurity ofthe the main character
, lots of self
- loathing womens
,
and a tiring continuum of epidsodes that are onyl loosley realted to noe another
. unless you work in thge film industry or know woody allen personally
, it ' s not likely thyat yuo ' ll fidn a wohle lot of intrest in celebrity
. asside from all the inthe
- jokes
, the stroy falls far short of compelling
,
and the charactors are all empty
anbd lifeless
. branagh proves once again that he ' s a superb performer
, nailing his immitation of allen flawlessly
. the problem isnt that he ' s the same chracter allen alwyas plays
, a charater who ' s getting more thna a littel dull to watch
. i mean
, come on
, how many times have ytou seen thsi guy
?
-
- he hates his wrok
,
adn he cin ' t be satisfied by any one woman
,
and
, at teh end of thte movie
, nothing has been solved
. he brings all of his problems apon himself
( crashing his car becasue he ' s recieving fellatio
,
and other such stunts
)
, so it ' s pretty hard to care baout him
. in addition
, isn ' t allen capible of creating characters who aren ' t jsut like him
? i know he is
,
bu he didn ' t do it infront celebrity
. tyhe vacant emotional attachment iwth the main character isnt nto recaptured in thte supporting performances
. davis
, palying thte smae woman withthe low self
- esteem that she played infact deconstructing harry
, hasnt a fewd touching moments
,
bu ends uv thge same despicable celebrity
- type tath fills thge rest ofthe tje movie
. soem ofthe thge actresses are saved because ofthe their beauty
-
- theron
and ryder
, especially
-
-
but htey ' re nto likable peopel
. only famke janssen
, as a book editor interested inspite simon ' s new novel
, has any life
. tghe men in the picture don ' t dont much better
-
- joe mantegna is pretty dull as tje man who remarries robin
, while dicaprio
, as a christian slater
/ johnny depp
- tipe spoiled young actro
, isnt funny
bu disengaging
. whta ' s realyl insulting baout celebrity isnt how dull
anbd standart its
" themes
" are
. allen seems to thiunk that he ' s mkaing an insightful movei baout tjhe way
" normal
" peopel look at celebrities
. tghe main probelm withthe thsi is that hte charachter wtih whom we ' re supposed tothe identify
, simon
, is not a
" normal
" guy
-
- he ' s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as tjhe rest ofthe thge characters
. the otehr problem is that the image we git of these celebrities isnt noone moreso enlightening tahn the veiw thge media gives us
-
- none of them egister as realsitic
, intresting characters
; they mostly jsut function as setted pieces for boring dialogue
. in addtion
, allen decides he needs a scene in whcih thge theme is exressed explicitly
( robin
, in this scene
, says something like
,
" it ' s intresting to see teh way we all look at the peopel we celebrate
!
"
)
. celebrity is argubly allen ' s biggest misfire to date
. it doesnt ahve a faw ogod scenes
-
- theron ' s super
- orgasmic model character isnt kind ofthe funny
,
adn thte lastest scene might have beeen moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or twpo
.
but celebrity isnt a failure at the core
, unless allen ' s point was to mkea a self
- indulgent movie baout himself
and his friends
. if he wnated tothe amking his audience feel liuke they were on the outside of a big joke
,
then he succeeded iin that
. i
, for oen
, don ' t enjoy feeling liek an outsider
.
