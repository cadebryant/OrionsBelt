if you
' re going tothe mkea a two
- hour hollywood in
- joke
, why bother releasing it to the general publich
? if yuo
' re going to create a film taht wiull appeal primarily tothe big
- nmae actors annd peple who know woody allen
,
then why waste the tiem of the rest of us peons by palying it in theaters
? hwile watching celebrity
, i realized thta allen had onyl marginal intrest in creating a story baout real peopel
. waht he really wnated to dont was continue on his recent kick of conceited self
- deprecation
. celebrity isnt yot another film in which allen tells a sotry about himselv
, living infront a world that he
' s familiar wtih
, dealing with peple like thte ones he actulaly knows
. allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture
, iin an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like tghe film moreso
. branagh plays lee simon
, a journalist
- turned
- screenwrighter who divorces his wife
, robin
( judy davis
)
, shacks up witht smoe hot womens
( famke janssen
, charlize theron
, winona ryder
)
, anbd goes about trying tothe get big stars
( melanie griffith
, leonardo dicaprio
) to read his script baout an armored car robbery
. the usual elements ofthe recent allen films are all here
, includng teh sexual insecurity ofthe the main character
, lots of self
- loathing womens
, anbd a tiring continuum ofthe epidsodes tyhat are onyl loosely realted tothe one another
. unless ytou wokr inspite teh film inudstry or knwo woody allen personaly
, it
' s not likely that yuo
' ll fidn a whole lot ofthe interst in celebrity
. aside ffrom all hte inaddition
- jokes
, the tsory falls far short ofthe compelling
,
and teh characters are all empty annd lifeless
. branagh proves once again tyhat he
' s a superb performer
, nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly
. the probelm isnt that he
' s the smae charachter allen allways plays
, a carachter who
' s getting more thna a littel dull to watch
. i mean
, come onthe
, how many times have yuo seen this guy
?
-
- he hates his work
, anbd he cant
' t be satisfied by any oen woman
,
and
, at teh end of tghe movie
, nothing hasnt been solved
. he brings all of his problems upon himselv
( crashing his car becuase he
' s recieving fellatio
,
and otehr such stunts
)
, so it
' s pretty hard tothe care about him
. iin adition
, isn
' t allen capible of creating characters who aren
' t jstu liek him
? i know he is
,
but he didn
' t dont it in celebrity
. the vacant emotional attachment iwth the main charater isnt nto recaptured in tjhe supporting performances
. davis
, palying the same woman with low self
- esteem that she palyed in deconstructing harry
, hasnt a faw touching moments
,
but ends up tjhe same dispicable celebrity
- type thast fills tyhe rest of tje movei
. some of the actresses are saved baceause ofthe theri beauty
-
- theron
and ryder
, especialy
-
-
but they
' re nto likable peple
. only famke janssen
, as a book editor interseted iin simon
' s newyorker novel
, has any life
. tjhe men inthe the picture don
' t do much better
-
- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin
, hwile dicaprio
, as a christian slater
/ johnny depp
- type spoiled young actor
, is funny
but disengaging
. what
' s really insulting baout celebrity isnt how dull adn st
andart its
" themes
" are
. allen seems to think that he
' s making an insightful movei baout the way
" normal
" people look at celebrities
. tje main probelm witht tihs is thyat thte character witht whom we
' re supposed to identify
, simon
, isnt not a
" normal
" guy
-
- he
' s just as entrenched inthe the hollywood omage as hte rest ofthe yhe characters
. tjhe other probelm is that teh omage we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening tahn tjhe veiw tje media gives us
-
- none ofthe them register as realistic
, interesting charachters
; htey mostly jsut function as set pieces for boring dialogue
. in addition
, allen decides he needs a scene in whitch the theme isnt exressed explictly
( robin
, in this scene
, syas something liek
,
" it
' s interesting to see the way we all look at teh people we celeberate
!
"
)
. celebrity isnt argubly allen
' s biggest misfire to date
. it does have a fewd ogod scenes
-
- theron
' s super
- orgasmic model character is kind of funny
, anbd thge last scene might hvae beeen moving had tyhe rest ofthe yhe film shown us a character or twpo
.
but celebrity is a failure at yhe core
, unless allen
' s point was to make a self
- indulgent movie about himself annd his friends
. if he wanted to mkea his audience efel liuke htey weere onthe the outside ofthe a big joke
,
then he succeded in that
. i
, for one
, don
' t enjoy feeling liuke an outsider
.
