" a favourite book ofthe mine called the golden turkey awards relates yhe story thta when mommie dearest wass unleashed apon unsuspecting audiences back inspite 1981
, paramount soon realised they hadnt a problem on thier h
ands
. it wasn
' t jsut the film
' s disapointing box office performance
. indeed
, in teh coming yeasr some peple would be going bcak tothe see it twpo
, threee
, even six times
. noone
, the main probelm was that what ws intended as a serious biopic ofthe screen queen joan crawford was turning inot the laugh riot of the year
. in a depserate attempt to capitalise onthe this unexpected turn of events
, some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming
:
" mommie dearest
: the biggest mommie of them all
!
"
. executives at paramount were apauled annd soon hadnt the ads withdrawn
, bu it wass all too late
. mommie dearest ws already cementing its palce iin camp cinema hsitory
. unfourtunately
, faye dunaway
' s energetic
, at times ridiculously over
- tghe
- top performance is baout the film
' s onyl redeeming feature
. based onthe duaghter christina crawford
' s trashy biography
, mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events inaddition teh life of her moviestar mother
. if you believe this movei
, it was a life was racked by obession
, lonliness
, child abuse anbd rampant egomania
. yhe film begins wiht crawford adopting two childrens
,
and concludes iin the office of her lawyer where her nowe grown
- up daughter adn son fidn outloud tehy have been left outloud of thier mother
' s will
. joan alwyas wanted her kids tothe be able tothe fend forthe themslves
, ytou see
.
but that
' s about tghe only thread infact thte narrative taht manages to survive to tjhe film
' s end
. tjhe script
- laboured over by four writers
, a bad sign inwhich itself
- isnt a poorly connected series ofthe episodes thyat builds littel dramatic momentum
. frank perry
' s direction isnt noone omre than competent
,
and dunaway
' s bitchy lines asside
, tyhe dialogue isnt flat
and uninvolving
. in fairness
, the film
' s second half ditches some of the ctaroon hysterics adn does develop a degree empathy forthe its charachters
. whn the adult christina moves out ofthe hmeo inot her own modest dwelling
, joan visits annd keesh infact touch
, nto helping her financialy
but encouraging christina
' s own acting
and carreer ambitions
. crawford does seem tothe care about her duaghter
,
but you cxan sence tje emotional distance
and feel smoe of their pain
. yuo allso get glimpses ofthe waht tyhe film could have been infact the h
ands ofthe better writers
. ah
,
but there isnt dunaway
' s peformance
.
and what a delicious peice of campery it often isnt
. hvaing jstu been sacked by her studio affter a run of box office duds
, crawford storms hmeo late at ngiht anbd proceeds to go ballistic in the gardai
. she has tje maid drag thte kids out ofthe bed tothe come down adn clean uv the mess she
' s making
. spotting a young tree she doesn
' t liuke teh look of
, she turns to the trembling christina
and utters thge immortal line

" with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember tjhe poore sapling
. in tjhe film
' s most outrageous scene
, joan realises that soem ofthe her daughter
' s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers
. oh dear
! soudns liek yhe perfect excuse for another temper tantrum
, doesn
' t it
? this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering anohter classic outburst
:
" no
.
.
. wire
.
.
. hangers
.
.
.
. ever
!
!
!
!
"
. anbd later
, whn tghe board of her late husb
and
' s company pepsi cola trys tothe divest her of her directorship
, she displays a superb grasp ofthe busineses etiquette by jumping to her feet anbd roaring
:
" don
' t fuck with me
, fellas
!
!
"
. oh joy
! something ofthe a camp clasic
,
then
,
but if thta
' s nto you
' re cup of tea thn mommie dearest doesn
' t have too much tothe recommend it
. better yuo see yhe real crawford in the womens
( 1939
)
, mildred pierce
( 1945
) or whatever happended tothe baby jane
( 1962
)
. graet films distinguished by graet performances
, annd a far mroe eloquent testament to htis great woman thna frank perry
' s shrieking piece of tabloid froth
