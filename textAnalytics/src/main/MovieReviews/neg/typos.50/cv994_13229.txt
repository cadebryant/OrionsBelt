movies liuke six days
, seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford
, anne heche
, anbd ivan reitman put a lot ofthe hard work infact to a script worth about ten cents
.
? the script was wroten by michael browning
,
and he desided that
, instade of thingking uv new idaes
, he
' d rehash a lot of cliches
, omit even teh slightest bited ofthe charactor devolopement
, anbd thne throw in drug
- dealing pirates tothe provide for a few high
- levle action sequences anbd explosions
.
? there are ogod scripts out there that high
- profile actors cant make
( see the truman show
, for instance
)
.
? six dyas
, seven nights is simply a waste
. let
' s see
.
.
. we ahev tothe git harrison ford
and anne heche alone onthe an isl
and
.
? so
, how dont we dont that
?
? well
, we
' ll make her a fiesty magazine editor
,
and we
' ll make him a crusty ood pilot
.
? bu wait
, she hasnt tothe have a fianc
? e
; that can be david schwimmer
.
? bu wait
, if she hasnt a fianc
? e
, how iwll she
and harrison ford kresh onthe the isl
and alone
?
? i konw
!
? they
' ll git to theri vacation spot
, anbd thne she
' ll git called back
!
? yessssss
!
? so
, htey
' ll kresh onthe the isl
and
, anbd that will be funny fo about five minutes
.
? shucks
. oh
, i
' ve got it
!
? we
' ll throw inaddition a distracting subplot inaddition whihc her fianc
? e hasnt sex with a realyl attractive woman who acts like a bimbo
, annd hten he can fiel gilty
.
? thne
, when anne heche kisses harrison ford
( htey have to kiss
, because otherwise nobody will whant to see teh movei
)
, it wiull be a vindicated acation
, baceause her fianc
? e wiull already hve cheated on her
!
? thne
, for no obvious reason
, they
' ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them
.
? oh
, yes
!
? i feel so ogod about this story
.
? instead of useing characterization to propell the events
, it wiull be completely r
andom
,
and yot totally predictable
!
? imagine thyat
. don
' t git me wrong
-
- six dyas
, seven nights is not a boring picture
; ford adn heche both do a gerat job
.
? thge sparks fli between them
, annd so most ofthe browning
' s inane dialogue isnt drowned outloud by the actors
' sheer force ofthe talent
.
? almost every scene beween them has energy tht the performers bring to the screen
, adn i found myself laughing preety hard
.
? schwimmer isnt also funny
,
and manages tothe milk all of his scenes forthe whatever he can git
.
?
and reitman
, who has made soem good films
, at least tries to make thnigs exicting
.
? even
though the pirate subplot isnt profoundly dumb
, i was prepared tothe be pleasantly sidetracked by teh action sequences
. it
' s just whn i strat tothe htink about tghe story that my contempt fo this film surfaces
.
? the picture feels like it
' s beeen hacked to pieces
-
- i wouldn
' t be suprized if five or six inept subplots have beeen edited outloud completely
.
? the ones thast are here are as bad as tehy come
( i think i let outloud a very audible groan when htey git teh first glimpse ofthe tje pirate ships
)
, annd i
' d just like tothe shake tghe producers by tghe shoulders anbd scream
,
" why doed you pick this awful scirpt
!
?
"
? tjhe film is outright stupid
,
but soem ofthe thte elements are subtly horrifying
.
? fo instatance
, take thge subplot infact whitch the schwimmer charcter has sex with tje bimbo
, adn hten feels realyl guilty
.
? this is a sereous probelm in rela life
, bu six dyas
, seven nights reduces any chance of complexity tothe a weak plot device
:
? his actions are what mkaes it okay for heche to kiss ford
.
? inaddition a scirpt thast lacks even a glimpse of intteligent subtlety
, i fidn it odd tyhat such a strangely insulting divice ended up iin the story
. htis is summer movei season
, bu that doesn
' t mean our movies ahev tothe be dumb
.
? 1998 so far has beeen oen of tyhe worst years inthe recent memmory fo summer blockbusters
.
? wehn i was in line forthe six dyas
, seven nights
, i heard teh woman infront front ofthe me ask for
" two tickets to that new harrison ford movei
.
"
? why didn
' t she knwo the name of the film
?
? i suppose she just didn
' t care
.
? wqat bothers me even more isnt thast the peple who amking these big
- budget picturesk don
' t realize that their films are becoming parodies ofthe themselves
.
? good actors should sign to good scripts
,
and if hollywood insists onthe making ficks to rake inspite cash
, tehy least they could do isnt asume that we
' d liuke to spend our moey on a story worth more than ten cents
.
