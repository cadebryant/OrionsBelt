movies liek six dyas
, seven nights make me mad becouse talented peopel like harrison ford
, anne heche
,
adn ivan reitman put a lot ofthe hard wrok in to a scirpt worth about ten cents
.
? tjhe script ws writen by michael browning
,
annd he decided thgat
, instade of thikning uv newyorker ideas
, he ' d rehash a lot ofthe cliches
, omit even tghe slightest bited of charactor development
,
anbd
hten throw in drug
- dealing pirates tothe provide fo a faw high
- levle action sequences
adn explosions
.
? ther are good scripts outloud there that high
- profile actors can make
( see tyhe truman show
, for instance
)
.
? six dyas
, seven nights isnt simply a waste
. let ' s see
.
.
. we have to get harrison ford
and anne heche alone onthe an island
.
? so
, how dont we dont thast
?
? well
, we ' ll amke her a fiesty magazine editor
,
and we ' ll amke him a crusty old pilot
.
?
but wait
, she hasnt tothe have a fianc
? e
; taht can be david schwimmer
.
?
but wait
, if she hasnt a fianc
? e
, how wiull she
anbd harrison ford kresh on the island alone
?
? i know
!
? they ' ll git tothe their vaaction spot
,
and
then she ' ll git called bakc
!
? yessssss
!
? so
, tehy ' ll kresh onthe the island
,
and that will be funny forthe baout five minutes
.
? shucks
. oh
, i ' ve got it
!
? we ' ll throw in a distracting subplot in hwihc her fianc
? e hasnt sex iwth a raelly attractive woman who acts like a bimbo
,
adn
then he cin feel gilty
.
?
then
, wehn anne heche kisses harrison ford
( they have to kiss
, because otherwise nobody iwll whant tothe see tjhe movei
)
, it iwll be a vindicated acation
, because her fianc
? e iwll lready hvea cheated on her
!
?
hten
, for noone obvious reason
, tehy ' ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them
.
? oh
, yes
!
? i efel so ogod baout this stoyr
.
? instead ofthe using characterization tothe propell the events
, it will be completelyl random
,
anbd
yot totally predictable
!
? imagin tath
. don ' t git me wrong
-
- six dyas
, seven nights is nto a boring picture
; ford
and heche both dont a great job
.
? yhe sparks fli between them
,
annd so most of browning ' s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors ' sheer force of talent
.
? allmost eveyr scene bewteen them has energy tht the performers bring tothe the screen
,
annd i foudn myself laughing preety hard
.
? schwimmer isnt also funny
,
and manages tothe milk all of his scenes for whatever he cin get
.
?
anbd reitman
, who has made some ogod films
, at least trys tothe mkae thnigs exicting
.
? even
though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb
, i wass prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences
. it ' s jsut whn i start tothe tihkn about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces
.
? the picture fiels like it ' s been hacked tothe pieces
-
- i wouldn ' t be suprised if five or six inept subplots have beeen edited out completelyl
.
? the ones that are here are as bad as they come
( i tihkn i let outloud a veyr audible groan when they git teh firt glimpse of the pirate ships
)
,
adn i ' d jsut like to shake tghe producers by tje shoulders
adn scream
,
" why did you pik tihs awful scirpt
!
?
"
? the film isnt outright stupid
,
bu smoe ofthe tyhe elements are subtlely horrifying
.
? fo instatance
, take tje subplot in wich yhe schwimmer charcter hasnt sex with the bimbo
,
annd
thn feels realy guilty
.
? htis is a serious problem inwhich real life
,
but six days
, seven nights reduces any chance of complexity tothe a weak plot divice
:
? his actions are wqat mkaes it okay for heche to kiss ford
.
? in a script that lacks even a glimpse of inteligent subtlety
, i find it odd thast such a strangely insulting divice ended up in yhe tsory
. htis isnt summer movie season
,
bu that doesn ' t mean our movies have to be dumb
.
? 1998 so far hasnt been oney ofthe the worst years inaddition receet memmory for summer blockbusters
.
? when i ws in line forthe six days
, seven nights
, i herad tje woman in front ofthe me ask for
" two tickets tothe tyhat new harrison ford movie
.
"
? why didn ' t she know thte nmae ofthe tjhe film
?
? i supose she jsut didn ' t care
.
? what bothers me even omre isnt that the peopel who amking theese big
- budget pictures don ' t realize that theri films are becoming parodies of themselves
.
? ogod actors shouldnt sign to ogod scripts
,
adn if hollywood insists on mkaing ficks tothe rake infact cash
, htey least tehy sould dont is assume thyat we ' d liek to spend our mone onthe a stry worth omre than ten cents
.
