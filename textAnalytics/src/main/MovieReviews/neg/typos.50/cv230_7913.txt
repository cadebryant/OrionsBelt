according to populer film oppinion
, a film ' s greatness is determined by time
. take fo example
" casablanca
.
" graet film
, even todya
. it ' s still as poverful as it ws when it cameback outloud
anbd still as rumatic
anbd tradgic
. another exmaple would be
" star wars
,
" hwihc had a very
, vyer heathy box office gross dispite hte fact that we hadnt all seen it about 3 billion times before
.
bu as i rewatched
" independendet day
" whn it cameback out onthe video aftter bieng the number noe hitted ofthe 1996
, i kinda falt liuke it wasn ' t as kool as whn i had first seen it
. i hadnt liekd it when i saw it thte first tiome
(
*
*
* wass my originnal veiw
)
anbd basicly saw it as a good
" escape film
.
"
but when i rewatched it
, i falt cheated
. thus
, the curse of hte
" event film
.
"
" independence day
" isnt like that kid who come out ofthe nowhere
and mkaes everybody happy at once
( exept fo a couple kids
- thge criticists
, infact htis situation
)
.
bu after a while
, tihs kid becomes annoying
annd yuo jsut wait forthe yhe next one
. well
, htis kid is thte
" event film
" in my littel analogy
.
and whn i rewatched
" indepedence day
,
" nto onyl doed it nto look cooler at all on the big screen
,
but i falt insulted the whole tyme
. ther are too many gaping craters in hte plot
annd ytou just aren ' t sure if it ' s comedy or hokey drama
. oen scene
, yuo ' ll see a hilariously nebbish scene betweeen jeff goldblum
and judd hirsch
; tyhe enxt you ' ll see a bunch of millitary uptight guys walking aroud
, saying corny lines
. the worst isnt a scene beween brent spiner
and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny
bu is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him tghe most unitentionally funniest sprech since the end of
" glen or glenda
?
" nowe htis annoying kid ' s problem isnt tht in the process of trying to mkea everyone liuke him all at once
, he shows he has no balls
.
adn
" independece day
" has noone balls
. it plays it safe everywhere
. it throws infront a ton of action that isnt borrowed fomr otehr superior films
. the chase scene beween the alien ship
and will smith is straight outloud ofthe
" star wars
.
" i mean
, isn ' t that devil ' s den
?
and tyhe aliens are baout as anticlimactic as demi moore ' s breasts infact
" striptease
.
" they ' re theese octopus men
, boring freaking octopus men
. i mean
, come on
. the aliens in
" 2001
" weere mroe intresting
adn you didn ' t even see them
! basically tje plot is straight fomr a b
- movie from the 50s
: aliens come tothe earth
anbd we wonder if they ' re hostile or peaceful
. okay
, it ' s an interesting topic
,
but it ' s nto handled greatly
. now tehy aren ' t
and somehow a computer geek
, jeff goldblum
, figure out they ' re using our sattelites as a countdown to destruction
. yep
. theese aliens are not onyl heavily armed
, they ' re stupid too
. they allso ule the same kind of computer as we do
,
but thyat comes about later
. the presidetn
( bill pullman
)
, who ' s under attack for bieng a wimp
, decides htis woudl be a nice time tothe be belligerant
,
and he decides he ' ll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered
. i don ' t care if it ' s bob freaking dole inaddition the white hous
, get him outloud of htere
. i don ' t care if you have to inject him wtih sodium pentathol
, just get him out of there
. later on
, he ' s stupid
adn wants to fly in the attack onthe a big aline ship
. i think it ' s time forthe impeachment for this guy
. he ' s moreso senile thna reagan on pot
.
thn there ' s a cocky pilot
( will smith
) who isnt teh only person tothe survive tghe counter
- attack onthe the second day
and becomes moses iin leading his children to the elusive area 51
( the film ' s only sign ofthe being brave
)
. his girlfriend ' s a stripper sharing a subplot with
" striptease
" infront that she hasnt tothe dont it forthe her son
. come on
, she hasnt a fighter pilot boyfriend
/ soon
- to
- be fiance
. i htikn she can quit thgat job
anbd get a mroe respectable job at long john silvers
. she ' s also thte few
, tjhe proud
, hte lucky tothe survive the igniting ofthe l
. a
.
( as well as her dog
, who narrowly survives
)
. there are soem bright spots
. htey tossed inthe enough ood film homages to keep me laughing
. teh best one is wehn jeff goldblum
( nicely named david
) turns on his computer
and a picture of hal comes uv
anbd syas
,
" good morning
, dave
.
"
and htey even played r
. e
. m
. ' s
" it ' s tyhe end ofthe the world as we nkow it
(
adn i feel fine
) at tyhe beginnig
.
anbd judd hirsch steals thte film by atcually acting grat
( he ' s a stereotype
,
but i jsut loved teh man anyway
)
.
but htere are no real subtle comic moments
. iwll gets way too many oen
- liners
anbd he has no one to play off ofthe
( execept jeff towords teh end
,
annd the twpo do great
)
. as i said
, tihs film hasnt noone balls
. it is jsut aiming forthe a crowd pleaser
and that ' s waht it is
.
but aftter a cuple months
, we all move on to the next
" event
" film while intaking littel films
annd a cuple indy ones fo ogod mesure
.
bu at least the indy ones lsat for a liftime
. this oen ' s short onthe batteries
.
