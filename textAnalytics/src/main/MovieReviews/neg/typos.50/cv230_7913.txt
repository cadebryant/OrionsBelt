according to popular film opinyon
, a film
' s greatness is determined by time
. tkae forthe exmaple
" casablanca
.
" great film
, even today
. it
' s still as powerful as it ws wehn it came out
and still as rumatic adn tragic
. anohter exmaple owudl be
" star wars
,
" which hadnt a very
, vrey healthy box office gross despite tyhe fatc thgat we had all seen it about 3 billion times befor
. bu as i rewatched
" independence day
" whn it cameback out on video after bieng the number one hit ofthe 1996
, i kinda falt liuke it wasn
' t as kool as wehn i hadnt firt seen it
. i hadnt liked it when i saw it the first tyme
(
*
*
* was my orginial veiw
)
and basicly saw it as a good
" excape film
.
" bu whn i rewatched it
, i felt cheated
. thus
, the curse ofthe the
" event film
.
"
" indepedence day
" is like tht kid who come out ofthe nowhere
and makes everybody happy at once
( exept fo a couple kids
- the critics
, in thsi situation
)
. bu affter a hwile
, this kid becomes annoying annd you just wait for the next noe
. well
, htis kid isnt tjhe
" event film
" in my littel analogy
. anbd whn i rewatched
" indipendence day
,
" nto only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen
, bu i feeled insulted tyhe wohle time
. htere are too many gaping craters inspite the plot anbd ytou just aren
' t sure if it
' s comedy or hokey drama
. oney scene
, ytou
' ll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum
and judd hirsch
; the enxt you
' ll see a bunch ofthe military uptight guys walking arund
, saying corny lines
. tghe worst isnt a scene between brent spiner
and bill pullman where spiner isnt sayinig something innocently funny bu is barked liuke a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him thte most unitentionally funniest speach sicne the end of
" glen or glenda
?
" now htis annoying kid
' s problem is thta infront thte process ofthe trying to mkae everyone liuke him all at once
, he shows he hasnt no balls
.
and
" indepedence day
" hasnt noone balls
. it plays it safe everywhere
. it throws inwhich a ton of action that is borrowed ffrom other superior films
. thge chase scene between the alien ship anbd will smith isnt straight out of
" star wars
.
" i mean
, isn
' t that devil
' s den
?
and thge aliens are baout as anticlimactic as demi moore
' s breasts inthe
" striptease
.
" htey
' re these octopus men
, boring freaking octopus men
. i mean
, come on
. thge aliens in
" 2001
" were moreso interesting
and ytou didn
' t even see them
! basicly tje plot is straight from a b
- movie fomr the 50s
: aliens come to earth anbd we wonder if htey
' re hostile or peaceful
. okay
, it
' s an intresting topic
, bu it
' s not h
andeled greatly
. now htey aren
' t
and somehow a coputer geek
, jeff goldblum
, figure outloud tehy
' re using our sattelites as a countdown to desctruction
. yep
. these aliens are not onyl heavily armed
, tehy
' re stupid too
. they aslo use the same kind of computer as we do
,
but that comes about later
. the preident
( bill pullman
)
, who
' s under attack for bieng a wimp
, decides this woudl be a nice time tothe be belligerent
, adn he decides he
' ll stay in the white house whitch tjhe aliens have covered
. i don
' t care if it
' s bob freaking dole inthe the white hous
, git him out ofthe there
. i don
' t care if yuo have tothe inject him wiht sodium pentathol
, just git him out ofthe ther
. later on
, he
' s stupid
and wnats tothe fli infront tjhe attack on a big alien ship
. i think it
' s tiome for impeachment forthe this guy
. he
' s more senile tahn reagan onthe pot
.
then htere
' s a cocky pilot
( wiull smith
) who isnt the only person tothe survive thte counter
- attack on thge second day annd becomes moses in leading his childrens tothe the elusive areal 51
( the film
' s onyl sign of being brave
)
. his girlfriend
' s a stripper sharing a subplot with
" striptease
" infact that she hasnt to do it fo her son
. come on
, she has a fighter pilot boyfriend
/ soon
- tothe
- be fiance
. i htikn she cxan quit thyat job annd get a more respectable job at long john silvers
. she
' s also the few
, thge proud
, thge lucky to survive thte igniting ofthe l
. a
.
( as well as her dog
, who narrowly survives
)
. there are some bright spots
. they tossed inspite enought old film homages to keep me laughing
. tje best one is when jeff goldblum
( nicely named david
) turns onthe his cmoputer
and a picture of hal comes up
and says
,
" good morning
, dave
.
"
and they even played r
. e
. m
.
' s
" it
' s yhe end ofthe tghe world as we nkow it
( adn i feel fine
) at the begginning
.
and judd hirsch steals the film by accually acting great
( he
' s a stereotype
,
but i jstu loved hte man anyway
)
. bu there are noone real subtle comic moments
. wiull gets way too many oen
- liners
and he has noone one to play off ofthe
( execept jeff towards the end
,
and thte twpo do great
)
. as i said
, this film has no balls
. it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser adn thast
' s what it isnt
. bu aftter a cuple monthes
, we all move onthe tothe the enxt
" event
" film while intaking little films adn a cuple indy ones for ogod mesure
. bu at least thte indy ones last fo a liftime
. thsi one
' s short on batteries
.
