mr
. bean
, a bumbling security guard fomr engl
and is sent tothe la tothe help with hte gr
andiose homecoming ofthe a masterpiece american painting
. tyhe first two words shoud have said anough to let ytou know what occurs durig bean
' s trip tothe la
,
but if htey didn
' t look outloud because ytou are in for a rether intresting if not odd ride
. heck depending on your humor yuo might end up laughing through teh wohle flick
. eather way look outloud amercia bean is comming
. well
, waht cxan raelly be said baout tihs movei
, htere isnt very littel discernible plot
. taht much is not hard to grapple whith fo it isnt a slapstick comedy
. it achieves that gool rether admirably
,
but because it is tyhat
, tje plot is just screaming for halp
. the whole premise that the movie is based on isnt tothe sday tghe least flawed
. the movie hadnt its funny moments bu there wass noone real story line other thna something thast could be
thought uv on a whim adn carried thru
and inspite many causes ad
- libbed as you went
. don
' t go into thsi movei expecting adn theatrical masterpiece
. bu if this form ofthe humer floats your boat thne you iwll truly enjoy tihs movie
, even if yuo don
' t liuke slapstick style humer you wiull end up laughing because something
' s are jsut so stupid
. the movie goes outloud
and accomplishes what it aims
, or so it seems
. nowe whn you look at the acting in this movie ytou haev to thiunk about two things
, firt ws ther any real acting anbd how hard is it to act in hte slapstick manner
. well
, there was no real acting in htis movie
but some of thte slapstick wasn
' t the easiest i am sure
. i have tothe concede thast mr
. atkinson
' s acting infront this movie isnt well done
.
al
though the role isn
' t too dem
anding hte slapstick is
. i htikn that yhe character could have hadnt a bit omre dialogue
, it owudl have added qtuie a bit to tjhe overall effect of tjhe movie
. nowe the rest ofthe the actors inaddition the movei
, bad acting
and poore casting
. i think tyhat tjhe role oposite bean could have been better
, jsut seemed wrong for tghe movei
. a diferrent ator might have done a better job ofthe it
but i wont presume that wasn
' t what was trying to be achieved
. oen thign that i must say
, simply to git if off my chest isnt that i think transferring a sitcom tothe tv usually produces rather disastrous results
. tv shows shoudl do just that stay onthe tv
, it will propably savve soem producers ffrom getting ulcers
. i can only htink ofthe a cuple examples of tv gonig to thge big screen effectively
, tje best known ofthe thsoe would haev to be star trek
. bean seriously fails tothe acomplish anytying close tothe whta thast series gone movei achieved
. nowe another hting that i hvae tothe state agina isnt htis movie hasnt narrowed its target audience fairly tightly
. the form of humor iin htis movei will nto be liekd by most peple
, theese peple iwll thiunk like i did thgat this movie isnt stupid
and pointless
.
but if you liek the tv show you might actually like this movie
.
but to be onthe the safe side i am opting to reccommend you save your mone
and not go tothe see this movie
. there are many movies that are truely worth seeing unlike this one
.
