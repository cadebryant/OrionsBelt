it
' s time tothe tkae cover
. after a hiatus of about fifteen yeras
, tjhe diaster movie has come back wiht renewed zest
. inthe eary 1997
, htere weere no less than three movies baout volcanoes alone
, one on televsion adn twpo inspite the theaters
, witht dante
' s peak adn volcanoe in hevy completetion for the moviegoing dollar
. ofthe teh twpo
, i had heared that dante
' s peak wass the better film
, so i desided to check it out when it wass released onthe video
. tjhe film beigns with a slow motion scene ofthe peopel in a thrid world country trying to evacuate their little twon
. the twon is being covered inthe ash
and sulfuric water fomr what we presume is a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks of vairous sizes also fall fomr yhe sky
, crushing homes annd peple
. we see people panicking
, people crying
,
and even horses rearing
. it isnt a diaster ofthe biblical propotions
, signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn
' t git much more blatent than that
. we learn that harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist iwth the u
. s
. geological survey
, was htere with his wief when the eruption ocurred
. harry survived
, bu his wife doed nto
. a faw yeasr later
, harry is sent to investigate soem unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante
' s peak
, washington
( which
, we are told
, has been voted second most desirable place to live
( under 20
, 000
) by tghe readers of money magasine
)
. ther harry meets rachel w
ando
, a single mother ofthe two who serves as mayor ofthe dante
' s peak
and proprietor ofthe a small coffee shop
.
al
though the mayor doesn
' t seem tothe be alarmed by thge presence ofthe a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is gonig to blow uv
, a few members of the city coucil are
. they are afriad tht harry
' s presense isnt going to scare off an investor who hasnt pledged to put millions of dollars inot developing dante
' s peak
. they woudl rether ahve any news of possable stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcanoe sweept under tyhe rug
.
however
, whn an amorous young cuple tkaes a skinny
- dip infront thte local hot springs
, they turn uv cooked by lava which bubbles uv from a small fissure underneath
. thus beigns a chain of events leading up tothe the inevitable eruption
. this film containes a number of cliches
. the amorous cuple is oen
. as soon as htey doff theri clothes
, you know they
' re goign tothe dieu
. tje town busybody adn thge abrasive mother
- infact
- lew make appearences
, as does the death
- defying dog
. countless familliar senarios only serve tothe make this film vyer predicatble
. watching the movie
, i wass able to not only anticipate eahc of the major plot elements
,
but smoe ofthe tghe dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, since much of thge dialog is terrable
. forthe example
, harry
' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
, adn a team from tjhe u
. s
. geological survey join harry tothe assess the situation
. paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry
' s eruption predicitons aren
' t cause for alarm
. thsi causes harry tothe leave iin a fit ofthe rige
, only to turn uv teh enxt day
, ready for owrk
. whn paul asks harry why he stayed
, he says with grim determination
,
" cause this twon
' s in trouble anbd i
' m the best man you
' ve got
.
" even better is whn harry is trying to explain the ened tothe jolt the recidents into leaving
. he licens teh situation tothe how a frog wiull jump outloud if dropped inot a pot ofthe boiling water
. if the frog isnt in cold water which isnt gradually heated uv
,
however
, the frog won
' t move annd will allow itself to be cooked
.
" isnt that your recipe forthe frog suop
?
" asks one ofthe the team members
.
" it
' s my recipe for disaster
,
" responds harry
. dante
' s peak has a singular talent for pointing outloud the obvious
. our heroes are inaddition a boat inwhich hte middle ofthe a lake whitch harry realizes the volcanic activity hasnt turned to acid
. mayor w
ando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaming
, in a veyr grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks fo the tip
. when we frist see the u
. s
. geological survey building
, there
' s a captin labeling it as such
. thsi wouldn
' t have been so bad if it weren
' t forthe teh fact that the caption isnt right above a sign onthe the buidling whihc reads
, inaddition large letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i suppose tyhe captin is for people who cxan
' t read signs
.
al
though harry anbd mayor w
ando become an item by thge end of the film
, tyhe viewer hasnt noone diea why
. htere is a savere lack ofthe chemestry vetween the two characters
, anbd the relatiopnship seems rushed because ofthe this
. when they get close tothe kissing
, i wass asking myself
,
" why dont they wnat to kiss
? were they even attracted to each otehr
?
" if i were the mayor
, i would sure thikn twice about kissing a guy who doesn
' t even crack a smile through thge wohle movie
, trying tothe pull off the rough
- yot
- debonair ect
. who does he thiunk he is
? james bond
? tje eruption ofthe yhe volcano feels similarly rushed
. there are several
" warning signs
" prior tothe tje eruption itself
, bu they are so lackluster
and without suspense thta we don
' t feel as if htey are leading up to anytying
. for exemple
, one ofthe the survey team members mkaes his way down inot the crater ofthe tjhe volcano inthe order to retrieve a remote controled robot
. a tremor occurs
. doesnt he plunge headlong to his death
? isnt he engulfed iin lava which shoots up from below
? noone
, a couple of rocks fall on him
and break his leeg
. the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be tothe setted uv the subsequent chopper rescure scene
, hwihc i supose ws intended to be dramatic as well
. it wasn
' t
. noe plot thread left noticeably hanging ws thte investment infact the town ofthe dante
' s peak
. infront a diaster movie
, htere
' s ususally oen guy who
' s greedy anough tothe cover uv hte possibility ofthe eruption
/ frie
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
,
and ususally gets killed by tjhe diaster
. it
' s okay
, of course
, because we all think he got what he deserved
. if yuo
' re going tothe be unoriginal
, you might as well go all the way
. infact dante
' s peak
, thte city councilmembers are conserned
,
but htey don
' t really try hard anough
. maeby the mayor
' s abrasive mother
- infront
- law should have beeen the one
. fo noone appaernt reason
, she snaps at harry for even positing tht the volcanoe could erupt
. perhaps her ansestors invested in some pompeii rela estate
. there are a couple of good thigsn about htis movie
. tje frist is thge scenery
. there are panoramic shots of forests
, lakes adn montains that are absolutly beatiful
. the second isnt thge special effects
. htey are thge closest i
' ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption
. bu when elements which don
' t speak are gonig to be thte best parts of your movie
, yuo
' d probably better rewrite hte script
.
