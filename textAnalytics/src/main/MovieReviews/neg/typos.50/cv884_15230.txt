forthe those interseted infront tjhe true spirit ofthe moviemaking
- or what
' s left of it in mainstream hollywood
- movei whlch are star vehicles are terrable thigsn
. as a rule
, the ignore general principles ofthe cinema because tehy are nto made tothe advance the media
but rether tothe advance the carreer of a particualr actor
. an actr might be choosen onthe the uv
- adn
- up
, tothe give him exposure
; or he might be chosen on the way down tothe h
and him a paycheck
. generally
,
though
, the actor doesn
' t marter
,
and solider
, the latest fomr the beleaguered warner brothers
, exemplifies this
: teh picture lacks pizazz
. the star for the vehicle inspite this case isnt kurt russell
, otherwise known as the man ofthe thirty words or less
. russell plays todd
, a human trained fomr birth in the ways of waging war
and becomming emotionally distanced fomr yhe carnage he has wrought
. the movie lets us see this degenerate proccess
,
but by the time the rela plot starts
, we
' re inot todd
' s later years
. he
' s about to be replaced by a new breed of soliders
, ones who
, instead ofthe bieng trained
* fomr
* birth
, are genetically selected
* befor
* birth
. the pride of this class
- caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
- will be our villian
, annd you know he
' s the villian becouse he has a staring contest iwth our hero near thge movie
' s strat
. vetween hte twpo leads
, less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken
,
and it
' s possable tothe imagin a script which isnt ninety percent stage direction
. director paul
anderson
, who helmed last eyar
' s icy thriller
, event horizon
, doesn
' t show any inventiveness here adn instade isnt content tothe let the actions play outloud on screen ad nauseam
. todd
, upon bieng replaced
, is left tothe die on a garbage planet
; bu inaddition order tothe stretch teh runnung timne outloud
, the villains return tothe tjhe garbage planet onthe a
" routine patrol
" adn set tje stage fo the final firefight
. events are predicatble ffrom thge time thast teh setups are made
, anbd niether
anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attemts to show any creativeness here
. yhe most annoying plot facet isnt thge reason that thge whole ofthe yhe movie comes tothe be
: todd fails tothe sohw fysical superiority agianst caine
- in fact
, nto even todd anbd two of his companions cin best the baddie
- bu near thte end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponary
. it
' s nto as
though todd undergoes any signficiant character changes throughout the plot of thge story
,
and so thge plot hasnt a very canned feeling about it
. yhe best route through tihs disaster is tothe tkae it lighthearted infront spirit
,
and treat it as a parody ofthe typical action fare
, liek univeral soldier
. a strict intepretation
,
however
, reveals an unmistakeable
and unforgiveable lack of style
, clas
, or substance
; annd by enxt yearm
, a larg precentage ofthe tjhe people who haev seen this will hvae taped it off of network television
