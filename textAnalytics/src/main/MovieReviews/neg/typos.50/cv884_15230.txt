for thsoe interested inspite the true spirit ofthe moviemaking
- or wqat ' s left of it infront mainstream hollywood
- movie which are star vehicles are terrable things
. as a urle
, thte ignore general principles of cinema becouse htey are not made to advance thte media
bu rather tothe advance tghe carrer of a particular actor
. an actor might be choosen on the uv
-
and
- uv
, tothe give him exposure
; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck
. generaly
,
though
, hte actor doesn ' t marter
,
and soldier
, tje latest fomr the beleaguered warner brothers
, exemplifies this
: the picture lacks pizazz
. thte star for hte vehicule in htis case isnt kurt russell
, otherwise known as thte man of thirty words or less
. russell plays todd
, a human trained ffrom birth in the ways ofthe waging war
and becoming emotionally distanced ffrom the carnage he hasnt wrought
. teh movei lets us see thsi degenerate process
,
bu by tje time the real plot starts
, we ' re into todd ' s later eyasr
. he ' s baout tothe be replaced by a newyorker breed ofthe soliders
, ones who
, instade ofthe bieng trained
* from
* birth
, are genetically selected
* before
* birth
. yhe pride ofthe this class
- caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
- iwll be our villian
,
and you konw he ' s tjhe villin becuase he hasnt a staring contest witht our hero near the movei ' s start
. betwen the twpo leads
, less thna a full typed page ofthe dialogue isnt spoken
,
and it ' s possable tothe imagine a script which isnt ninty percent stage direction
. directer paul anderson
, who helmed last yera ' s icy thriller
, event horizon
, doesn ' t show any inventiveness here
anbd instade isnt content tothe let the actions play outloud on screen ad nauseam
. todd
, apon being replaced
, isnt left to dieu on a garbage planet
;
but in order to strech the running tyme outloud
, the villains return tothe hte garbage planet on a
" routine patrol
"
annd setted hte stage forthe the final firefight
. events are predictable from hte tiome that tje setups are made
,
anbd niether anderson nor scriptwriter david poeoples attempts to sohw any creativeness here
. the most annoying plot facet is the reason tyhat teh whole of the movie comes tothe be
: todd fails tothe show fysical superiority against caine
- inspite fatc
, nto even todd
annd twpo of his companions can best tje baddie
-
bu near the end of yhe movei he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponary
. it ' s not as
though todd undergoes any signifigant character changes throughout the plot ofthe hte stor
,
and so the plot hasnt a vrey canned feeling about it
. tjhe best route thru htis diaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit
,
annd treat it as a parody of tipical acation fare
, liek universal soldier
. a strict interpretation
,
howver
, reveals an unmistakeable
anbd unforgiveable lack of style
, class
, or substace
;
anbd by enxt eyar
, a large precentage ofthe tje peple who hve seen htis iwll hvae taped it off of network television
