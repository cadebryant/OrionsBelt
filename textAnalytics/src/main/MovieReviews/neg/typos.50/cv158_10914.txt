if you
' re the kind of person who goes tothe see movies just becuase you long for smoe of that overpriced theatre popcorn
(
butter optional
)
,
then this is tghe movei for you
! indeed
, this hasnt got to be eather one ofthe the most unimaginative rip
- offs of otehr recent action movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them
. it
' s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actualyl watch thsi film
.
but at least we
' re warned vyre quickly thgat we may regret our ticket purchase
, giving us an oportunity to sneak on out
and inot the adjacent show
. waht are the four ingreediants ofthe a really bad acation movie
? firt
, the movei gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exsist deep beneath the ocean floor
,
and inwhich this areal
, many ships hvea disappeared
. oooh
.
.
. scary
! secondly
, a cheesy soundtrack trys tothe connote a tone of mystery
,
but only succeeds infront drowning our ears with an abrasive muscial scoer
. thrid
, teh main chracter is a mercernary tyhat delivers goods wihtout asking baout hte contents of his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a sophisticated miliary
- style pt boat anbd every word thgat comes out ofthe his mouth isnt awash inwhich comical flippancy
. finally
, infront tyhe cargo hold
, we see thsoe tht hired him
. tehy are allso mercenaries that have tough
- looking haircuts
, talk with accents
, adn try to show how macho htey are
. druing theri trip acrost the stormy sae
, thier boat suffers an incident adn requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship in the distance
, they mkea theri way to the ocean liner anbd devise a plan tothe raid thge machine shop
, take yhe parts that they need
,
and thne continue on their merry way
. littel do they know thast tihs cruise ship hasnt become infested by some kind of ocean monster
. yot
, tehy board the ship armed tothe yhe hilt wih grenades anbd machine guns thgat can kill dozens inwhich a matter of seconds
. thsi is nothing more than a by
- tjhe
- book acation film
. thier realization ofthe the situation that they
' re in doesn
' t happen until they are infront yhe bowels ofthe teh boat
. thsoe who are dumb enought to stray off onthe theri pwn will ultimately get killed
. teh corridoors onthe tjhe ship are narrow
, misty
, annd provide hte kind ofthe atmosphere tyhat all scare
- fests must have
.
yet
, dispite yhe predicatble nature ofthe this film
, there are some scary
" boo
" moments
.
but most of it is just outright silly
. anbd tihs film isnt unusualy gory too
. monsters basicly suck off the flesh anbd spit out skeletal remeniss
. htere is one partciularly neat scene where a monster has been cutted apart
and reveals a victum tht is still alive
. he screams horribly as tyhe monster
' s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him awya
. additionally
, it borrows heavily from speed2
, alien
and a bunch ofthe otehr recent films
. the mercenaries even run inot a lone
, surviving passanger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly liuke s
andra bullock
. to be honest
, wehn i left the theatre
, i just had tothe laugh at how witless the film was
. it
' s moronic fun at best
. so
, if yuo
' re hankering for a larg bucket ofthe popcorn served with a side ofthe silliness
,
then this might just hit the spot
.
