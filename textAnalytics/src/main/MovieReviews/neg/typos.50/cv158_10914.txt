if yuo ' re yhe kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long fo soem ofthe taht overpriced theatre popcorn
( buter optional
)
,
then thsi isnt yhe movei for you
! indeed
, this has got tothe be eather one ofthe teh most unimaginative rip
- offs ofthe otehr reccent acation movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them
. it ' s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless yuo actually watch this film
.
but at least we ' re warned vrey quicklyu tyhat we may regret our ticket purchase
, giving us an opportunity to sneak onthe out
and into tje dajacent sohw
. what are teh four ingreediants ofthe a really bad acation movei
? frist
, yhe movie gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exist deepo beneath the ocean floor
,
and infront this area
, many ships have disappeared
. oooh
.
.
. scary
! secondly
, a cheesy sountrack trys tothe connote a tone of mystery
,
but onyl suceeds in drowning our ears withthe an abrasive muscial score
. third
, the main character is a mercernary that delivers goods wihtout asking baout thte contents ofthe his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a sophisticated military
- sytle pt boat
adn eveyr owrd that comes out ofthe his mouth isnt awash in comical flippancy
. finaly
, infront tjhe cargo hold
, we see thsoe tath hired him
. they are allso mercenaries that have tough
- looking haircuts
, talk with accents
,
and try to show how macho they are
. during thier trip accros the stormy sea
, thier boat suffers an insident
and requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship in the distance
, htey make thier way tothe tyhe ocean liner
and devise a plan tothe raid teh machine shop
, take thte parts thta htey need
,
and
thne continue onthe theri merry way
. little dont they konw thyat tihs cruise ship hasnt become infested by some kind of ocean monster
.
yot
, tehy board teh ship armed tothe tje hilt whith grenades
annd machine guns tyhat cant kill dozens in a marter of seconds
. this isnt nothing omre than a by
- the
- book action film
. their relization of the situation tht htey ' re in doesn ' t happen untli htey are in the bowels ofthe hte boat
. thsoe who are dumb anough to stray off on their own will ultimatly get killed
. the corridoors onthe tyhe ship are narrow
, misty
,
and provide the kind ofthe atomsphere that all scare
- fests must haev
.
yet
, despite the predictable nature ofthe tihs film
, htere are soem scary
" boo
" moments
.
bu most ofthe it is jsut outright silly
.
and this film isnt unusually gory too
. monsters basically suck off the flesh
and spit out skeletal remeniss
. ther isnt one particularly neat scene where a monster hasnt been cut appart
and reveals a victim that isnt still alive
. he screams horribly as tje monster ' s digestive juices continue tothe slowly eat him away
. additionally
, it borrows heavily from speed2
, alien
and a bunch ofthe otehr receet films
. tghe mercenaries even run into a lone
, surviving passenger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly liuke sandra bullock
. tothe be honest
, when i left tghe theatre
, i jsut had tothe laugh at how witless the film was
. it ' s moronic fun at best
. so
, if you ' re hankering forthe a larg bucket of popcorn served wih a side of silliness
,
thne this might just hitted the spot
.
