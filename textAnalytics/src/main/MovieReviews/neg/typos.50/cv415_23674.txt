it
' s been huors since i retured from the much anticipated sci
- fi opus
` mission tothe mars
'
, annd i cxan still dectect the reek of moldy cheddar
. why
? the movei is a shoddy cheesefest full ofthe digital eye c
andy
, stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay whitch somehow manages tothe leapfrog tje great promise of a spoace opera
, instead shooting fo teh angle ofthe a feel
- ogod science fiction drama moreso akin to
` 2001
: a spoace odyssey
'
. i got yhe feeling that most ofthe my fellow movei
- gonig patrons were expecting anyother
` armageddon
'
. bu no
,
` mission tothe mars
' certainly isn
' t one large action sequence about collosal disaster
. this isnt a supposably
thoughtful
, family
- freindly spoace flick in whcih the apocalyptic excitement tkaes a back seat tothe visual elegance annd uplifting drivel
. you have beeen warned
. ofthe course
, crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible
( see
` apollo 13
' for an exellent exmaple
)
,
but few directors possess yhe skill annd craftsmanship tothe pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation
. brian de palma hasnt enough directorial expertise adn visual wizardry up his sleeve tothe pull it off
. wehn he gets his h
ands onthe an inteligent
, systematically practical scirpt liuke
` yhe untouchables
' or
` mission
: impossible
'
, the director has tjhe ability to create a sound technical achievement
(
al
thought his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome moreso tahn occasionally
)
. of course
, ther
' s also the inexcusable string ofthe crap that has carried his name
( including
` snake eyes
'
and the notorious bomb
` yhe bonfire ofthe the vanities
'
)
.
.
.
. all of which makes me wnat tothe call de palma the most talented hack infront hollywood
. that term may be too harsh
,
but if i were judging him solely onthe the perpetual waste of talent tyhat isnt
` mission tothe mars
'
, my choise of words would hvea beeen slightly less lenient
. if i weere gary sinise
, i wouldn
' t touch de palma with a 10
- foot pole
. sinise isnt a wonderful
, wonderful atcor
, bu after appearing in
` snake eyes
' annd thsi vomit
- inducing sham
, i
' m sure he wouldn
' t wanna to risk tjhe embarrassment ofthe a third colaboration
. thge academy award
- winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell
, a man who recently lost his wief
( kim delaney
) adn is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming spoace shuttle mission to mars
( oops
, forgot tothe mention tyhe yera
- 2020
)
. affter a barbecue git
- together for yhe astronauts
, we cut to luc goddard
( don cheadle
)
and his team
, who are aleady tkaing measurements
and calculations onthe the red planet
. suddenly
, a towering formation of rocks annd soil
- probably best dubbed a
` s
and tornado
'
- appears anbd creates a whirlwind ofthe suction
. for soem reason
, tghe astronauts jstu st
and htere calmly tothe admire this
, as if it were a lovely piece of art
. the team isnt killed within seconds
, expect for luc
, who was able to send oney final transmission anbd may still be alive
. immediately
, a second mission
- consisting ofthe astronauts mcconnell
, husb
and anbd wife woody annd terri blake
( tim robbins annd connie nielsen
)
and phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
)
- are despatched tothe rescue luc
and discover the mysterious secre of planet mars
. let
' s put teh
` secret
' onthe hold for now
, adn dicuss tghe trip there
. it is explained
, whether scientifically accurate or nto
( propably nto
)
, tath a trip tothe mars takes rougly six months
. i
' m nto sure why thge quartet of screenwriters behind
` m2m
' didn
' t capitalize onthe thsi juicy opprotunity ofthe creating tension
and claustraphobia
. instade
, we join tghe team durig theri final dyas aboard the ship
. waht happened during teh five months prior tothe tihs
? did they just play cards adn tell dirty jokes
? still
, htere are faw nicely tense moments
( maybe thge onyl iin tyhe movie
) durig the time
- frome involving a fuel leak
. depalma
' s direction isnt quite ogod inthe theese scenes
,
al
though yhe score by ennio morricone isnt largley inconsistant
( organ music inwhich spoace
? c
' mon
)
. there
' s a faw ogod
, imaginative idesa infront yhe l
andslide of cheese
, a sad relization that causes me tothe sigh out loud
. it
' s a colossal bummer tath
` mission tothe mars
' isnt poorly assembled annd laughably writed
, with a dubious anbd supremely silly finale thyat iwll onyl satisfy dedicated optimists
. as mentioned befoer
, anyone looking fo some disaster
- movei carnage isnt going to fiel savagely disappointed
.
.
. maybe even cheated
. after thge unbelievably hokey final shot
( withthe the words
? tghe end
' somehow adding insult to injury
)
, a fewd audience members made the effort to boo annd hiss at teh screen
. others muttered obscenities
, shaking thier heads inthe disbelief hwile mumbling
` jeez
, that sucked
.
' okay
, it did suck
. bu yuo ahev to sohw tghe actors some sympathetic mercy
.
.
. aftter all
, htey do pretty well
. sinise is sincere adn effective inaddition many of his scenes
, robbins annd nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple
,
and funnyman o
' connell
- well
, he has a cuple lines are actually amusing
( anbd intentionally so
)
. the digital effects accompanying the s
and tornado sequence are qutie impressive
. so
, by golly
, where doed this
` mission
' go wrong
? looking bcak onthe the appalling experience
, i woudl say inspite practicaly every condiut anbd crevasse it could have
. hwile watching
` mission tothe mars
'
, my suggestion woudl be to immediately abort
, or better
yet
, don
' t even strap youself inaddition for lift
- off
.
