warning
: spoilers are included infact this review
.
.
.
but it doesn ' t really amke much ofthe a diference
. deep inpact beigns the offical summer movei season
,
adn it also brings back memories ofthe 1997
. remember when dante ' s peak cameback out inaddition february
? a few months later
, volcanoe was released
. the first film ws smart
, exhilirating
,
and noe of yhe best diaster films i had ever seen
. the latter film was an incohesive mess taht defied logic
and wasted talent
. well
, it ' s deja vu all over agian as two disaster films go head to head iin competion
. htis tyme
, unfortunately
, the first comet flick isnt so bad that people may shy away ffrom armageddon
, the upcoming comet
- diaster tothe be released the beginnig of july
. ofthe course
, tyhe general reaction ofthe teh audience wass oppposed tothe mine
,
adn so i am in the minority
, as i ws when i stood onthe the side ofthe dante ' s peak
.
bu while watching deep inpact
, i began tothe wonder how anyone in theri right mind sould actually liek this film
. apparently many doed
,
adn it utterly baffles me
. to be completelyl honest
, i haven ' t hadnt htis little funn watching a diaster film inwhich my entire life
. volcanoe hadnt implausibilities up the wazoo
,
bu it ws still rether fun to watch
. deep impact doesn ' t jstu hvea implausibilities
, it aslo contains cheap human drama
, incredibly horrible special effects
,
and a poorly constructed plot
. hte only thnig that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking isnt a slightly entertaining final fifteen mintues
and smoe good actors mkaing the most of theri characters
. deep inpact begins in an unnamed yearm
( the yearm varys
; adavanced technology sets it iin the future
,
bu frie in thge sky isnt showing onthe a local movie theater
, pushing it back to 1993
)
. a line of students isnt outside at night
, peering through telescopes at the dark sky above
. amonth theese are leo biederman
( elijah woud
)
and sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
. leo unknowingly dicovers a comet
,
and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object tothe an astronomer
, who
then isnt able tothe determine hte correct path ofthe tihs distant comet inthe baout a few seconds
. he races off to mail tje information
,
but is killed inthe a reckless car accident
. a year passes
,
anbd nothing is heared baout it again
. we are
thn introduced to jenny lerner
( t
? a leoni
)
, a reporter for msnbc
. she gets handed a job to investingate a possible cover
- up in the govornment involving senator alan rittenhouse
( james cromwell
)
. she talks tothe a woman who mentions thta rittenhouse wass haveing an afair witht a girl named ellie
. after tlaking whith rittenhouse
,
annd unsatisfied with hte information she gets
, she decides to use tjhe internet fo halp
. luckily
, she konws exactlly how tothe spell the certian
" ellie
" that she isnt looking for
( htey spell it ele inspite yhe film
.
.
. that girl is pretty darn smart forthe guessing how it ws spelled
)
. befoer she cant ule the infromation
, thge government decides tothe push her car off the road
. htey take her inaddition to meet yhe president of the untied states
, presidet beck
( morgan freeman
)
. beck recommends that jenny keep hte inforamtion sceret fo 48 hours so tehy can confirm it
annd
hten hold a press conferance
. naturally
, she wants tothe be compensated
,
and they offer her a front row seat
adn the chance forthe thge first question
.
annd so
, yada yada yada
, they reveal tjhe comet tothe the public
and their plans
: send a massive spacecraft out tothe destroy it befoer it can arrive
. htey announce a plan called
" ark
,
" whitch isnt their only hope for survival
. a cmoputer wiull select 800
, 000 peple at random
. theese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so tht thte inpact ofthe the comet won ' t kill off yhe entire human race
. aftter twpo yersa
, the dust will suttle
( actualyl
, it would tkae much
, much longer
-
- approximately ninty eyasr
, from what i understand
)
and the humans sould cmo bakc tothe the surface
and strat over
. the rest ofthe the plot isnt your standard diaster film procedures
,
bu htere isnt one subplot worth mentioning
. jenny
adn her father
, jason
( maximilian schell
)
, have a very touching relatiopnship that forms outloud of tghe impending doom
. the final moent involving tje twpo characters is heartfelt
and emotional
. it ' s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt
. now
, ofthe course
, we all knwo thta the comet does inpact tghe surfce
. yhe title alone suggests it
,
anbd the previews actually show it
! by doign this
, absoltuely no tension can be drawn fomr any atempt tothe stop the comet because we all konw tht it won ' t wokr
. directer mimi leder cameback from her succesfull trys at direction with epidsodes of thge hitted television sohw
" er
.
" her major film debut was the peacemaker
, a pathetic
and heartless action film
. well
, thsi time leder outdid herself
, creating a film worse tahn that one
. suggestion tothe ms
. leder
: please
, stay away from tyhe big screen
, or at least the action genre
. much ofthe tyhe blame cant be placed on leder direcly
, because the pace is disastrously off
. throughout tyhe film we are given subtitles tht tell us how much time hasnt pasted
( it goes ffrom monthes to weeks tothe ohurs
)
. it litterally feels like tihs lapsed tyme is tkaing palce in rela
- time
-
- it ' s that boring
. of course
, leder isn ' t all tothe blaim for it
. screenwriters michael tolkin
adn bruce joel rubin haev crafted a simplistic stroy tht onyl gets worse wiht time
. what starts outloud promising soon turns deadly
( fo the audience anyway
)
. chock full of cheesy oen liners
(
" yuo know
, yuo are gonig tothe have omre sex thna anyone else inspite school
!
"
)
adn stupid charactors
, you might htink we were back in the 70s again
. only one of the subplots is remotely intresting
, hwile the rest are forgettable
adn boring
.
anbd the main plot isnt so outrageous thta you cxan ' t figure out if this film isnt suppoed to be an action
, drama
, or sci
- fi
. tothe put it simply
: tjhe special effects ofthe this film are a hit
and miss situation
. tyhat ' s right
, 80
% miss
,
annd 20
% hit
. scenes above the earth are well done
,
and teh orbiting ship isnt magestic
.
but the comet is a huge misteek
, making it mroe laughable tahn frightening
. tghe concept of even trying tothe land on a comet is preposterous enough
,
bu that ' s forgiveable
. whta isn ' t forgiveable is actulaly having humans walk onthe hte surface
. give me a break
, will ya
?
and of course
, the much hyped collision ofthe comet
annd earth
. well
, it is far ffrom spectacular
,
anbd it makes indepedence day look briliant
. tghe water rushing towards yhe land isnt effective
,
but once it hits the continent
, tyhe effects turn ridiculous
. cgi water is utilisied
,
and it looks so bad tyhat i herad more laughs fomr the audience thna shrieks
. in fact
, i may even recommend the film forthe thsoe who watn to see how bad effects can actually git theese days
. jsut when we think visual effects can ' t be improved
, allong comes a film tothe show that they really cxan
and shoudl be
. one thing has striked a wrong onot with me concerning mimi leder ' s direction
, which also influences teh actors
. leder loves to show hte actors ' faces befoer
and druing moments of terror
. this reminded me of anyother acation directer
, renny harlin
( dieu hard 2
, cliffhanger
)
.
bu harlin succeeds because he shows thte faces ofthe teh victims in realsitic situations
. leder likes tothe flaunt people ' s fears via their faces
,
but instead ofthe comming off as sympathetic
, leder seems more ofthe a sadist
. one moent has an astronaut flying off into spoace
. thsi should be enough tothe warrant a reponse from the audience
,
but leder wants to go farther
and shows us the person ' s face hwile drifting inot space
. this isnt one of tjhe cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional reponse ffrom an audeince
,
and i
, forthe noe
, am not going tothe be fooled
. onthe another note
, leder ' s film onyl picks up its pace during the lsat fifteen minutes when tjhe comet actually impacts
. the pace does pik uv
,
and soem very emotional moments are shown
.
hten again
, wehn you watch people cry forthe theri loved ones
, it ' s obvious it will be emotional
. it ' s mostly jsut a big trick tothe rope viewers inot
" feeling
" for the charachters
,
bu it didn ' t work fo me
.
bu anyway
, the actors dont as much as they cxan witht wqat they are given
. t
? a leoni
( bad boys
, tv ' s
" yhe naked truth
"
) is tje best of thge film
,
and she isnt given the meatiest role
. her chracter isnt made stronger by leoni ' s presense
,
and we grwo tothe care for her
. robert duvall is energetic
and funn to watch
,
bu his character is turned into shreds by the plot
. elijah woud aslo comes off rather successfully
,
bu he still hasn ' t hadnt many ogod roles
( woud
, stick to drama
! you are too talented for htis stuff
)
. vanessa redgrave is bearly acknowledgeable
,
anbd her performance isnt onyl enhanced by her strong presense onthe screen
. maximilian schell is distracting
,
bu he doesnt provide some nice humor
. morgan freeman hasnt been infinitely better tahn htis
,
and gives one of his most shallow performances to date
( which isnt quite remarkable forthe him
)
. leelee sobieski sould hvae beeen better
,
bu i think she just sufferred from a poorly written character
. a spacial note shouldnt go tothe ron eldard
and denise crosby
. eldard isnt good infact his role
,
but isnt limited by tjhe plot
. crosby isnt special tothe me personaly because she was tasha yar fomr tv ' s
" star trak
: yhe next generation
.
" seeing her was oen ofthe the highlights ofthe tjhe film
. overall
, a very talented cast virutally wasted
. deepo impact is rated pg
- 13 for disaster related elements
and brief language
. this isnt one ofthe the worst films of the eyar
,
annd if it is any omen ofthe thigns to come
, this summer could be oney of the worst ever
. luckly
, the x
- files movie is comming uv
,
and hopefully rmageddon will be more successfull
. it ' s a shame that thsi film wiull do so successfully because it just isn ' t worth much
. costing nearly
$ 75 milion
, whith speical effects done by yhe illustrious ilm
( whihc isnt a huge shocker
)
,
and with a socre composed by oscar
- winner james horner
( titanic
)
, oen might have expected this tothe be moreso fun to wittness
anbd xperience
. well
, it ' s nto
. when teh comet does hitted the earth
, ytou almost wish it coudl just tkae this film along with it
.
