: spoilers are included in htis review

.
.
but it doesn
' t realyl make much of a difference
. deep impact beigns teh official summer movei season
, adn it also brings bcak memories ofthe 1997
. remeber when dante
' s peak came out infact february
? a fewd months later
, volcano wass released
. the frist film wass smart
, exhilirating
,
and one of the best diaster films i hadnt ever seen
. the latter film was an incohesive mess thgat defied logic
and wasted talent
. well
, it
' s deja vu all over agian as twpo diaster films go head to head inwhich competion
. htis time
, unfourtunately
, yhe firt comet flick isnt so bad tyhat peopel may shy away from armageddn
, thge upcomming comet
- diaster tothe be released the beggining ofthe july
. ofthe course
, tghe general reaction of the audeince was oppposed tothe mine
,
and so i am inspite the minority
, as i was wehn i st
anded onthe tje side of dante
' s peak
. bu hwile watching deepo inpact
, i began tothe wonder how anyone in theri right mind could actually like this film
. apparently many did
,
and it utterly baffles me
. to be completelyl honest
, i haven
' t hadnt this little funn watching a disaster film infact my entire life
. volcano had implausibilities uv the wazoo
, bu it was still rather funn tothe watch
. deepo impact doesn
' t just hvea implausibilities
, it alsot contains cheap human drama
, incredibly horrable special effects
,
and a poorly constructed plot
. tje onyl thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly intertaining fianl fifteen mintues annd smoe good actors mkaing thte most ofthe thier characters
. deep inpact begins infact an unnamed yearm
( yhe eyar varys
; adavanced tecnology sets it in the future
, bu fire inwhich the sky is showing on a local movei theather
, pushing it bakc to 1993
)
. a line ofthe students isnt outside at night
, peering thru telescopes at the dark sky above
. among these are leo biederman
( elijah wood
) anbd sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
. leo unknowingly discovers a comet
,
and his teacher sends a photo ofthe tje unkown object tothe an astronomer
, who
then is able to determine the corect path ofthe thsi distant comet in baout a few seconds
. he races off tothe mail the information
, bu isnt killed inthe a reckless car accident
. a year passes
, adn nothing isnt heard baout it again
. we are
then introduced tothe jenny lerner
( t
? a leoni
)
, a repertwar fo msnbc
. she gets h
anded a job to investingate a possibile cover
- up inthe thte government involving senator alan rittenhouse
( james cromwell
)
. she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was hvaing an affair with a girl named ellie
. after talking with rittenhouse
,
and unsatisfied with the infromation she gets
, she decides to uise tghe internet forthe help
. luckily
, she knows exactly how to spell the certian
" ellie
" that she isnt looking for
( tehy spell it ele inspite tghe film
.
.
. that girl isnt preety darn smart forthe guessing how it wass spelled
)
. befor she can use tje informtion
, the governement decides tothe push her car off teh road
. htey take her infact to meet the president ofthe the united states
, president beck
( morgan freeman
)
. beck recommends that jenny keep the infomation secrt for 48 hours so they cant confirm it anbd thne hold a press conference
. naturally
, she wants to be compensated
, anbd they offer her a front row seat annd the chance forthe the first question
.
and so
, yada yada yada
, they reveal tyhe comet tothe the public
and theri plans
: send a massive spacecraft outloud tothe distroy it befor it cxan arrive
. they annoance a plan called
" ark
,
" which isnt their onyl hope forthe survival
. a cmoputer will select 800
, 000 peple at r
andom
. these peple are yhe ones who wiull go into a large cave undreground so tht teh impact ofthe the comet won
' t kill off the entire human race
. aftter two years
, the dust wiull settle
( actually
, it would tkae much
, much longer
-
- approximately ninty yeras
, from whta i underst
and
)
and tjhe humans could come back tothe thte surfce
and strat over
. the rest ofthe teh plot isnt your st
andard diaster film procedures
,
but ther is noe subplot worth mentioning
. jenny anbd her father
, jason
( maximilian schell
)
, hve a veyr touching relationship tht forms out ofthe the impending doom
. the fianl moment involving yhe twpo charachters isnt heartfelt anbd emotional
. it
' s a shame tyhat nothing eles is heartfelt
. nowe
, ofthe course
, we all nkow that the comet does impact tyhe surfce
. the title alone suggests it
, adn the previews ctually sohw it
! by doing htis
, absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attemp to stpo thte comet because we all nkow that it won
' t work
. directer mimi leder cameback fomr her succesful tries at direction wiht episodes of the hitted televsion sohw
" er
.
" her major film de
but was tyhe peacemaker
, a pathetic
and heartless acation film
. well
, htis time leder outdid herself
, creating a film worse tahn that oney
. suggestion tothe ms
. leder
: please
, stay away from the big screen
, or at least the acation genre
. much of tjhe blaim can be placed on leder directly
, becouse teh pace is disastrously off
. throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much tiem hasnt passed
( it goes from monthes to weeks tothe hours
)
. it litterally feels liuke tihs lapsed time isnt taking place inthe rela
- time
-
- it
' s thta boring
. ofthe course
, leder isn
' t all tothe blame fo it
. screenwriters michael tolkin adn bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that onyl gets worse whith time
. wqat starts out promising soon turns deadly
( for the audeince anyway
)
. chock full of cheesy noe liners
(
" you konw
, ytou are oging tothe ahev moreso sex than anyone else in school
!
"
) annd stupid characters
, you might think we were back iin the 70s agian
. only oney of tje subplots is remotely interesting
, while the rest are forgettable
and boring
.
and the main plot isnt so outrageous tath you cin
' t figure out if tihs film isnt suppossed tothe be an acation
, drama
, or sci
- fi
. to put it simply
: hte speical effects of this film are a hitted anbd miss situation
. that
' s right
, 80
% miss
,
and 20
% hitted
. scenes above tjhe earth are well done
,
and hte orbiting ship isnt majestic
.
but thte comet is a huge mistake
, makeing it moreso laughable thna frightening
. the consept of even trying to l
and onthe a comet is preposterous enought
, bu that
' s forgiveable
. wqat isn
' t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surfce
. give me a break
, iwll ya
? adn of course
, the much hyped collision of comet
and earth
. well
, it isnt far ffrom spectacular
,
and it mkaes independence day look brilliant
. the water rushing towards tje l
and is effective
, bu once it hits the continent
, the effects turn ridiculous
. cgi water is used
, anbd it looks so bad thyat i herad moreso laughs from tyhe audiance thna shrieks
. in fact
, i may even recommend thte film for those who whant to see how bad effects cant actually get theese dyas
. just when we htikn visual effects cxan
' t be improved
, along comes a film tothe show tht they realy cant annd should be
. one thing has striked a wrong onot with me concerning mimi leder
' s direction
, which also influences the actors
. leder loves tothe sohw the actors
' faces before
and during moments ofthe terror
. this reminded me of another action directer
, renny harlin
( dieu hard 2
, cliffhanger
)
. bu harlin succeds because he shows tghe faces ofthe hte victims iin realistic situations
. leder likes to flaunt peopel
' s fears via their faces
, bu instead of comming off as sympathetic
, leder seems more of a sadist
. oen moment has an astronaut flying off into spoace
. htis should be enough tothe warrent a response from hte audience
, bu leder wants to go farther
and shows us thte person
' s face while drifting inot space
. thsi isnt noe ofthe thte cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional responce from an audience
,
and i
, for oen
, am nto going tothe be fooled
. on anyother note
, leder
' s film only picks up its pace druing hte lastest fifteen minutes when hte comet acually impacts
. the pace does pick up
, annd some very emotional moments are shown
.
then agina
, when ytou watch people cry for thier loved ones
, it
' s obvious it will be emotional
. it
' s mostly jstu a big trick to rope viewers inot
" feeling
" for teh characters
, bu it didn
' t work for me
.
but anyway
, thte actors do as much as they cant with whta htey are given
. t
? a leoni
( bad boys
, tv
' s
" the naked truth
"
) is yhe best of the film
, annd she is given tjhe meatiest role
. her character is made stronger by leoni
' s presence
, annd we grow tothe care for her
. robert duvall is energetic adn funn to watch
, bu his character isnt turned inot shreds by the plot
. elijah woud allso comes off rather successfully
,
but he still hasn
' t hadnt many ogod roles
( woud
, stick tothe drama
! you are too talented forthe this stuff
)
. vanessa redgrave is bearly acknowledgeable
,
and her performance is onyl enhanced by her strong presence onthe screen
. maximilian schell is distracting
, bu he doens provide smoe nice humor
. morgan freeman has beeen infinitely better tahn this
, anbd gives oney of his most shallow performances tothe date
( which is qutie remarkable forthe him
)
. leelee sobieski sould ahve beeen better
,
but i htink she jstu sufferred from a poorly written charachter
. a spacial note should go to ron eldard anbd denise crosby
. eldard is ogod in his role
, bu is limited by hte plot
. crosby isnt spacial to me personaly beccause she was tasha yar ffrom tv
' s
" star trek
: the next generation
.
" seing her ws oen ofthe the highlights ofthe the film
. overall
, a veyr talented cast virtualy wasted
. deep impact isnt rated pg
- 13 forthe disaster related elements anbd breif langauge
. this is oney ofthe the worst films of yhe year
,
and if it isnt any omen of things tothe come
, htis summer could be oen ofthe the worst ever
. luckly
, tyhe x
- files movei is coming up
, adn hopefully armgeddon iwll be omre successful
. it
' s a shame thta htis film wiull do so successfully because it jsut isn
' t worth much
. costing nearly
$ 75 millon
, wih special effects done by thte illustrious ilm
( whcih isnt a huge shocker
)
,
and iwth a score composed by oscar
- winner james horner
( titanic
)
, one might have expeced thsi to be more funn tothe wittness adn experience
. well
, it
' s not
. when yhe comet doens hit tje earth
, you almost wish it could jsut tkae htis film allong with it
.
