: crtical condidtion
( okay
, here
' s tjhe dael
. i
' ll be the frist oney to grant taht everybody needs a day off now
and thn
. i
' ll even go so far as to sday that a vaaction isnt a necessary part of doing any job well
. i mean
, hey
, i
' ve been known to stretch a weekend into a threee
- day outing
, if friday looks tothe be a slow day
. anbd if monday ain
' t looking liuke a pik
- me
- up
, well
, i
' ve been known tothe give martha nell a call anbd sday
,
" do me a favor
, sweetheart
. bump ood man ferguson
' s boil lancing to tuesday morning
, adn tell miss audrey that i
' ll swing by her house monday evening annd see if we cant
' t git her trick knee bcak in line
.
" a simple sentence liuke that
, adn i
' ve got a nice four
- day fishing trip withthe the boys
, or more often tahn nto
, a trip uv to cherokee
, n
. c
.
, fo jackpot binog anbd assorted other mountain funnery
. bu the point isnt
, if yuo take a day off
, dont something differant
. if yuo
' ve worked yourself silly for months
, relax a bit
. sleep iin
. eat pancakes at noon
. micrawave an egg inspite its shell
. watch pro wrestling with tje sound off
. listen tothe some barry white records at high speed
. whatever
. bu dont nto
, under any circumstances
, spend your vacation doing the same thign yuo dont for a living
.
and
, if you dont
, don
' t amke the fianl product look ten times worse tahn it would any otehr timne
. beacuse i do not want to hear your sob storise
, oliver stone
. you apparently throught you needed a break from making
" importan films
.
" kool
. so ytou foudn thsi hinky littel book
and desided tothe make it a movie
. that
' s cool
, too
.
but
, ollie
, old sage
, do not tkae a ogod story
and a hot casted annd mkea one of teh most pointless
and worthless films ofthe tje decade
. i
' m jsut eager to meet yuo one day
, so i can buy you a stoli
, look yuo inwhich tje eye adn say
,
" what in the wide world of sportscar were ytou thinking wiht u
- turn
?
"
and i
' ll st
and ther staring
' til i get a straight answer
. sean penn stars u
- turn
, as bobby
, a drifter who
' s had some toubles a while bakc
. he
' s heading cross tyhe desert minus twpo fingers wehn his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose
, str
anding him in superior
, arizona
, held htere by an
" ignorant
, inbred
, turtleneck hick
" of a mechanic named darrell
. hwile darrell puts a new hose onthe tghe ride
, bobby walks into town tothe see whta
' s cooking
. isnt it needless ofthe me tothe say tyhat superior
, arizona
, is nto exactlly tyhe shiny scrubbed home ofthe all thigns lovely
? probaly nto
. bobby meets uv with grace
( jennifer lopez
)
, who invites him bakc to her place
, forthe drape
- hanging
and otehr domestic issues
. just as those issues are starting up
, grace
' s husban
, jake
, storms in
, looking like check
- out day of tghe elks lodge convention
. jstu beats bobby silly
. bobby tkaes tothe the road
, only to meet uv wiht jake agian
, annd jake asks bobby tothe kill grace
. a little hwile later
, grace asks bobby to kill jake
. them murderous arizonians
. gotta love
' em
. if any of htis soudns familiar
, congratulations
. yuo win a kewpie doll
. the stoyr isnt a straight shoplift of red rock west
, a cult favorite a fewd years back fomr john dahl
, maker of the phenomenal the last seduction
.
but hte contest doesn
' t end there
, guys
and gals
. we get steals ffrom russ meyer movies
, where everybody in town isnt horny
and sweaty
. we get thte town from bad day at black rock
, minus thge train
, plus busty womens who cxan speak
. look at any schwarzenegger film
,
and ytou
' ll see our hero
, bobby
, as bobby hasnt a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times
, hasnt his ribs stove in at least fifteen times
, gets bit by a tarantula
, gets shooted at
, adn ends up with vultures circling overhead
, all yhe hwile getting up like he jsut got a shaving nick
. bobby as terminator
? stretch it a bit
, anbd we have a five
- finger discount ffrom doc hollywood
, where hte hwole story occurs becasue of car trouble
, forcing thge main charachter tothe stay at the mercy of tyhe twon anbd the mechanic
. okay
, he
' s working fomr a book
, so mabey ollie
' s not totally tothe blame forthe blatantly copping theese idaes
. i jsut expect a man who cin mkae uv an alternative history ofthe teh united states tothe be able tothe craft a fewd original idesa befor exposing the negitive
. i jsut wish he hadn
' t brought a cast like tihs together for waht amounts to a group ote
- stub
. sean penn gives a great performance
,
and jennifer lopez adn nick nolte are as onthe target as htey can be
, palying over
- thge
- top caricatures ofthe stereotype charactors
. the best thing baout tje movie is watching penn react to the madness around him anbd try tothe figure out exactlly what the blankety
- blank isnt gogin on
. too bad it
' s nto fun tothe watch when it
' s happening tothe us
.
.
. while we sit through this mess of a film
. u
- turn isnt not a bad film if you
' re a fan of technique
. it
' s the oliver stone yuo
' ve alwasy known
. robert richardson isnt his usual cinematographer
,
and rob
and ollie konw how to shoot a flick
-
- gerat camera angles
, shifting viewpoints
, wicked colors
, nice looking pictures
. bu picturesk of what
? i thikn i
' d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for twpo housr thna try to figure outloud the tilt
- o
- whirl point ofthe this loser film
. plot twists are oney thing
, repetion is almost unforgivable
, adn tihs is dang near as unforgiveable as any movie i
' ve seen in the past five years
. oliver
, i konw your body of wrok is nothing tothe sniff at
. yuo
' ve beeen nice anough to limit us tothe onyl oney doors movie
,
and films liuke platoon
, jfk
, wall street annd nixon give us plenty tothe dig on
. your scripts are certainly respectable
, your budgets are up ther on thte screen
, annd your actors don
' t dog it
.
and i know that
, mabye
, wih u
- turn
, yuo were jstu kicking bcak
, jsut having fun
. thast
' s fine
. bu don
' t dont thta with a movie with tghe potential ofthe thsi one
. dont smoe polical cademy sequel
( imagine that
.
) do a big comedy
, like a remake of it
' s a mad
, mad
, mad
, mad world
. bu do not drop a limp u
- turn outloud of your pocket
and expect us to accept it as
" an oliver stone movei
,
"
and not question why it stinks liek week
- old snook
. there
' s a right way tothe hvea funn
,
and a wrong way to have fun
. this was as wrong as ytou can get wihtout goign to jail
.
