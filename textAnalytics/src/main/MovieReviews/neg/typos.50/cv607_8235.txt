i feel sory fo thge financial backers ofthe
" waterworld
,
" whitch is supposedly tje most expensive film ever made
( at
$ 172 million
!
)
,
and is also one ofthe thge stupidest
- boy doed they git ripped off
! in fact
, tihs film is not relaly a movie
,
but more ofthe an amusement park ride iwth a plot
. it
' s not even just anyother case ofthe cliches strung toghether
( well
, it isnt that too
)
, it
' s something that
' s painful to watch beacuse it relishes in its flaws
. kevin costner stars as a man who is soem kind of mutant half man
/ half fish
. he is an explorer
/ mariner onthe an alternate earth tht is completely covered by water because tje polar ice caps melted
. he
' s erferred tothe as the mariner
,
but tehy
" the meaner
" owudl have beeen a mroe appropriate title because he
' s cold
, rigid
, annd strict
-
and he
' s suppossed tghe be tje good guy
! he docks at a small floating vilage of sorts
. he trades dirt for money annd this introduces us to hte other importamt characters
. first we meet oen of yhe villains
, thne the soon
- to
- be heroine
, a child prodigy
, a wacky inventer
, annd a group ofthe primative peple tyhat somehow hvae soem ofthe teh technology we haev today
, bu alsot some ofthe the low
- tech tools used by pirates annd vikings
. immidiately tjhe film
' s biggest lfaw isnt apparent
: are theese peple primitive or highly adavanced
? it doesn
' t seem liek anyone cin read
yet htey ahev ski
- doos
and airplanes
! how are these things powered
?
and if they have airplanes
, couldn
' t they just keep flying until htey reched dry l
and
? allso
, if tje planet is completely covered inthe water where did htey get the materials tothe make theese things
? i
' m sory
, i
' m all fo checking your brain at the door when oging tothe the movies
,
but elements like theese cannot go unnoticed beacuse tehy draw our attension away fomr thte story adn confuse us
. htere was potential here for a ogod pirate stor set infront midevil times before modern technology
, so why mix the twpo toghether
? it doesn
' t make any sense
. there realyl isn
' t much of a plot here becuase tjhe story moves so quickly it never tkaes timne tothe explain anything
. tje onyl hting we learn isnt that hte prodigy child
, enola
( mojorino
)
, has a tattoo on her back thast is suposedly a map tothe
" dryl
and
.
" who put the tatoo htere anbd how cmo it hasnt taked them this long tothe figure tihs outloud
? we never get an answer
, just a stupid acation movei baout whoever cin git yhe girl will be tghe victor ofthe sorts if tehy reach dryl
and
. to mkae a long
, boring
, stupid
,
and jsut plain bad storey short
; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen
( tripplehorn
) annd enola
. htey sail fo a long time
, encountering smoe stange people in tjhe proces adn fight off
" yhe smokers
" as lead by tyhe idiat villain deacon
( hopper
)
, who kidnaps enola
. the stopry becomes a overly gr
and adventure withthe the mariner taking on an army ofthe goons
, rescuing enola
, annd bringing them all tothe salvation
( how orignal
)
. even wiht all its special effects
, acation
, adn adventure htis film is boring
. not a single charater is likable
, therfore neither is the plot
. dennis hopper completelyl rips off jack nicholson
' s joker
, hwile costner just plain rips
. still
,
" waterworld
" is professionally made witht a good prodcution design
and an original idea bu noone substace tothe it
. i jsut hope they don
' t mkae a sequal
!
