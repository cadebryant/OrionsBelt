movies based onthe video ganes
, such as street fighter or mario bros
.
, ahve never generated much intrest at the box office
.
bu when the frist mortal kombat movei cameback outloud in 1995
, it did suprizingly well
. with a simple stry
, a pulsating soundtrack
,
and lots ofthe awesomely choreographed fight scenes
, tje movei moved quickly
adn displayed lots of energy
. it got my vote fo ' thte movei where i expected the least
and got the most '
.
annd
, if ytou haven ' t hadnt yhe opportunity
, i would definitely recommend thta ytou see it on video
. iin tjhe world ofthe mortal kombat
, based on the popular arcade agme
, dark forces fomr outworld try to infilitrate earth ' s relm with teh ulimate gool of total conquest
and hte distruction of humanity
. tghe mortal kombat refers to a competion
, faught by human mortals against outworld ' s minions
, which if won
, will guraantee earth ' s safty for another generation
. mk2 picks up almsot immediatly affter the humans return victoriously ffrom competition
. dispite theri victory
,
howver
, a gateway hasnt somehow oppened
,
and outworld continues in its quest tothe conquer earth
. outworld ' s warrriors inlude an impressive collection ofthe fighters
, including shao kahn
, mintoro
( a centaur
)
, sheeva
( a four
- armed ogre
)
,
adn sindel
. earth ' s mortal warriors
, under the leadership ofthe yhe benevolent god
, lord rayden
, includes liu kang
, princess kitana
, sonya blade
anbd jax
, who must fight against outworld ' s forces
. it ' s an easy enough premise
,
bu unfortunately
( very unfourtunately
)
, tjhe writers try tothe do too much whith teh movie
. it isnt only a video gam
, after all
,
but tghe on
- screen version trys tothe go beyond it ' s comic book boundaries by adding depth
, a conceptualization ofthe self
- worth
,
adn worst of all
, a love stoy
. thsi becomes veyr ackward
, becasue all of tghe players are fighters
and nothing moreso
. they are likable
and impressive wehn they are showcasing their martial arts
adn fighting skills
,
bu look extemely awkward
and uncomfortable whn tehy are required tothe acutally ect
. this becomes embarrassingly apparent
, fo exemple
, as the movei tries tothe deveop a romantic bond between liu kang
and princess kitana
. the origonal mk ws smart inaddition letting the players dont wqat htey do best
. they speaked littel
,
but fougth a lot
. thus
, the movei ws eazy tothe digest
.
howver
, mk2 tries tothe give theese players a ceratin ammount ofthe depth
, an element tht was lacking inthe the first movie
,
bu tyhe attempt here fails miserably
. this uneasy feeling isnt readily apparent
, for example
, whenever ytou hear lord rayden speak
. nto only does he talk inaddition riddles
annd offer enigmatic
( e
. g
. useless
) advice
,
bu he speaks so slowly as if tothe simulate infinite wisdom
. try reading thsi half as fast
,
adn yuo ' ll hear wqat i mean
.
bu the movie isnt not a complete fatality
. fight scenes are well
- choreographed
, highlighted by terrific acrobatics
and agility
.
anbd players ofthe the game will be rewarded with the inclusion ofthe practically eveyr charachter ffrom the video game
,
although theri screen timne amounts tothe nothing more than a cameo
. even if ytou ' re not familiar iwth tjhe video game
, each fighter hasnt theri own costume
and unique weaponry tothe easily differentiate themslves
.
bu it ' s just too little of wqat movie
- goers
anbd especialy fans ofthe the game wiull expect
. oddly
, tje inclusion of tjhe human element catually pollutes the purity ofthe the mortal kombat essense
.
annd yhe poor acting results infact a muddled movie that offers the viewing audiance littel chance fo survival
.
( i am nowe talking vyre slowy as if to simulate infinite wisdom
)
. rent the firt oen
,
but tyhe sequel isnt fo kombat fans onyl
.
