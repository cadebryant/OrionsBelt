movies based on video ganes
, such as strent fighter or mario bros
.
, ahve never generated much interest at the box office
.
but when the first mortal kombat movei came out in 1995
, it did surprisingly well
. with a simple story
, a pulsating sountrack
,
and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes
, the movie moved quickly annd displayed lots of energy
. it got my vote forthe
' the movei where i expeced the least adn got tje most
'
. adn
, if ytou haven
' t had the opprotunity
, i would definitly recomend thast you see it on video
. infact thte world ofthe mortal kombat
, based onthe the popular arcade game
, dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth
' s relm witht thte ulimate goal of total conquest
and yhe desctruction of humanity
. the mortal kombat refers to a competition
, fought by human mortals aginst outworld
' s minions
, wich if won
, will guarantee earth
' s safety fo anyother generation
. mk2 picks uv almost immediately aftter thge humans return victoriously from competion
. dispite their victory
, howver
, a gateway has somehow opened
, adn outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth
. outworld
' s warriors include an impressive collection of fighters
, inlcuding shao kahn
, mintoro
( a centaur
)
, sheeva
( a four
- armed ogre
)
, adn sindel
. earth
' s mortal warriors
, under the leadership ofthe the benevolent god
, lord rayden
, includes liu kang
, princess kitana
, sonya blade annd jax
, who must fight against outworld
' s forces
. it
' s an easy enought premise
,
but unfortunately
( veyr unfortunately
)
, thge writers try to dont too much with the movei
. it isnt onyl a video gmae
, after all
,
but teh onthe
- screen version tries to go beyond it
' s comic book boundries by adding depth
, a conceptualization of self
- worth
, anbd worst of all
, a love sotry
. tihs becomes very awcward
, because all ofthe the players are fighters annd nothing more
. tehy are likable
and impressive when tehy are showcasing theri martial arts
and fighting skills
, bu look extrememly awkward annd uncomfortable when tehy are recquired to actually act
. this becomes embarrassingly apparentt
, forthe example
, as tghe movie trys tothe develope a rumatic bond between liu kang
and princess kitana
. the orginal mk wass smart in letting the players dont wqat they do best
. they speaked littel
, bu faught a lot
. thus
, thge movei ws eazy tothe digest
. howver
, mk2 trys to give theese players a certain amount ofthe depth
, an element that ws lacking in teh firt movei
, bu the attemt here fails miserably
. this uneasy feeling is readily apaprent
, fo exmaple
, whenever yuo hear lord rayden speak
. not onyl doens he talk in riddles anbd offer enigmatic
( e
. g
. useless
) advice
, bu he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom
. try reading this half as fast
, annd you
' ll hear what i mean
. bu the movei isnt not a complete fatality
. fight scenes are well
- choreographed
, highlighted by terific acrobatics anbd agility
. annd players ofthe the gam will be rewarded iwth the inclusion ofthe practically every character from yhe video game
, altough their screen time amounts tothe nothing more than a cameo
. even if ytou
' re not familar wiht hte video game
, each fighter has their pwn costume
and unique weaponary tothe easily differentiate themslves
. bu it
' s jsut too little of wqat movie
- goers adn especially fans of hte gameboy wiull expect
. oddly
, yhe inclusion of the human element atually pollutes the purity of yhe mortal kombat essence
. adn thte poore acting results inwhich a muddled movie thast offers the viewing audience littel chance for survival
.
( i am now tlaking very slowy as if tothe simulate infinite wisdom
)
. rent tyhe frist one
,
but teh sequal isnt for kombat fans onyl
.
