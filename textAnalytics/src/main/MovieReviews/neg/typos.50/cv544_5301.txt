one ofthe my favorite songs by tje stranglers includes teh lyric
,
" yuo
' d better watch out fo yhe skin deep
.
" i
' d like tothe extend the smae warning
: watch outloud for skin deep
, bu whatever you dont don
' t watch skin deepo
. skin deepo is a tedious adn uneven comedy written
and directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dryed up writter
and insatiable womanizer wih a big
- tiome drinking problem
. i never saw edwards
' comedy the man who loved women
,
but i have tothe wonder whether skin deepo isnt a remake
. you see
, to put it mildly
, zach goes tothe bed whith just about earch annd eveyr woman he meets
. as tjhe movei opens
, zach
' s wief
, alex
, catches him wih nto only his mistress bu allso his mistress
' hairdresser
. like any sensible wief
, alex kicks zach out ofthe the house
and divorces him
. in reponse
, zach goes onthe a spriritual journy ofthe drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
, adn self
- dicovery
. if you
' re turned onthe by the idea ofthe watching ritter drnik
, get arrested
, have sex
, drnik
, kresh his mercedes
, have more sex
, drnik
, get erested agian
, drink
, anbd sing horrendously at the piano
,
then skin deepo should be right uv your alley
. skin deepo makes tje futal misteek ofthe inflicting onthe us unbelievable
and unsympathetic characters
. zach isnt a rich
,
' 80s l
. a
. version of ritter
' s jack tripper charactor ffrom
" threee
' s company
.
" like jack
, zach is clumsy
and inept
; he
' s the tipe of guy whose bad aim mkaes him accidently squirt breath freshener inot his eye
. zach is supposed tothe be charming adn charismatic
,
but i failed tothe see even oen reedeming virtue in him
. consenquently
, i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity forthe tghe phil
andering alcholic during his moments of crisis
. in fact
, when zach crashes his ex
- wief
' s wedding in a deperate attempt tothe stop her ffrom remarrying
, i actually rooted for her tothe go thru wtih the ceromony
. tothe add insult tothe injury
, edwards gives his larg supporting casted nothing
but stereotypes witht whihc to wokr
. fo instatance
, vincent gardenia
' s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender
. ofthe all the women in the film
-
-
and there are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, st
ands outloud as zach
' s wief
; reed brings inelligence anbd sensitivity to the role
. becasue we don
' t care the slightest bited about anyone inwhich skin deepo
, the film
' s few feeble attemts at drama inevitably fail
. the comedy inthe skin deep doesn
' t fare much better
. most of yhe jokes are dumb
, predicatble
, anbd sitcomish
. about every ten mintues
, howver
, edwards does manage tothe come uv wih a ogod line or a novel sight
- gag
, tghe most effective ofthe hwihc involves a pair of
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, yhe laughs infront skin deepo are just too infrequent
and yhe charachters just too shallow forthe teh film tothe stay afloat
. my fianl criticism ofthe thge film lies in its glamorous depiction ofthe alcohol
and alcoholism
. zach
' s eccessive drinking isnt clearly ruining his life
, bu nethertheless it seems tothe give him more pleasure tahn pain
. zach
' s drinking binges never have any truly sereous or lasting consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a new one
. if he gets arrested
, his lawyer bails him outloud ofthe jail
. if his wife leaves him
, she wiull evenhtually deside to give him a second chance if he
' ll clean uv his act
. the tone in skin deepo is all wrong
; edwards treats a vrey sereous issue far too lightly
, mkaing a joke outloud ofthe a probelm tht isnt noone joking marter
. perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore inaddition arthur or
, better
yet
, michael keaton inwhich clean annd sober before mkaing skin deep
.
