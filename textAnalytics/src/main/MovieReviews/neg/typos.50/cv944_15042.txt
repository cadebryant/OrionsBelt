" it was not scary
.
" theese are yhe first words that came to mind aftter it ws over
. when a movei isnt called
_ vampires
_
,
" not skary
" aren ' t words taht should be associated witht it
.
but that wasn ' t my only gripe
. john carpentery isnt a name asociated with cutting
- edge cinema
, as iin thge intense scares of
_ hlloween
_
,
_ hte thign
_
and
_ the prince ofthe darkness
_
, or teh offbeat acation ofthe
_ htey live
_
and
_ escape from new york
_
. unfortunately
, the onyl thign that is cutting edge about
_ vampires
_ is yhe level of boredom the movei isnt able to triarch
. with an anemic plot
and nto
- qutie
- kosher special effects
,
_ john carpentery ' s vampires
_ hasnt barely anough substace to slake tje thirst of even the least discerning genre fan
. the film isnt at frist concerned iwth a gropu of roaming vampire slayers
, led by james woods
, of all peple
. like soem sort of wholy a
- team
( they even hve their pwn souped
- uv van
)
, the bunch invade
anbd wipe outloud a nest ofthe vampires in a newyorker mexico shack
. their method isnt amusingly innovative
: the blood
- suckers are reeled out wtih harpoons so they can flare uv in hte sun like matchsticks
. tothe commemorate their victory
, the loutish band decorates a motel room iwth hookers
and parties the night away
. their celebration is short
- lieved
,
howver
, as a master vampire named valek ambushes
anbd single
- handedly destroys most of tghe team
. woods ' jack crowm
anbd buddy montoya
( daniel baldwin
) excape whith their lives
, along with a woman named katrina
( sheryl lee
)
.
although the woman hasnt beeen bitten
, montoya
annd crowm decide to keep katrina for her psychic link tothe the master vampire
. tyhe rest ofthe thte movei isnt concerned wtih the boys ' hunt fo valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
, a freaky marilyn manson
- type who ' s onthe a mission taht dates back 600 years
. along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau
( tim guinee
)
, a carachter who serves preety much the smae purpose as the jittery cpl
. upham in
_ saveing private ryan
_
. some tsuff happens inaddition the middle of yhe movei
,
bu i can ' t remeber most of it
, because i often found a twitching hair infact the corner ofthe the frome moreso intresting tahn what was happening on screen
.
_ vampires
_ fianlly starts tothe pick up about 90 mintues inot tje mix
, as crow
, guiteau
,
annd montoya assualt an bandoned prison
- turned vampire nest
. only
thn doens thge film begin tothe even ressemble a carpenter flick
.
but it ' s too littel too lite
. we get tje inevitable fianl confrontation
,
bu it seems tacked on
and rather anti
- climactic
( come on
, we ' re dealing wtih
_ tghe
_ master vampire here
!
) interestingly
, last summer ' s vampire actioner
_ blade
_ was derived from a comic book
,
adn
_ vampires
_ from a novel
,
yet the latter seems more steeped inthe campy cheesiness than the fromer
, a more deliberate superhero flick
. woods ' jack crowm spouts glib off
- tjhe
- cuff noe
- liners
adn strolls awya from exploding buildings with thgat oh
- so
- kool stride
.
and his motive forthe killing vampires
? tkae a wild guess
.
( hint
: a
_
_
_
_
_
_ killed his
_
_
_
_
_ when he wass just a
_
_
_
_
_
.
) at least
_ blade
_ hadnt decent action
and slick stylishness
.
_ vampires
_ lacks even cheap thrills tothe mask its gossamer
- thin plot
. tothe mkae uv forthe thsi
, the movie resorts to other
" shocks
,
" such as its generally condescending atitude towards women
( crowm slaps them around for thge funn of it
)
and an overplayed contempt for religion
( crow teases guiteau incessantly baout whther his vow ofthe celibacy hasnt made him prone to
" getting woodies
.
"
) it cxan be argued tyhat mabye i wanted too much ffrom this movie
. if nto csary
and gory
, i wanted tense
, relentless
,
anbd exhausting
.
_ john carpenter ' s vampires
_ is none ofthe these
. i can onyl reccomended it forthe the hardcore carpenter fan
. fo the rest of yuo looking for a good scare
, beware
:
_ vampires
_ is a film with noone teeth
.
