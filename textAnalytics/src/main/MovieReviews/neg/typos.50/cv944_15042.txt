" it was not scary
.
" these are tghe firt words tath cameback tothe mind aftter it wass over
. wehn a movie isnt called
_ vampires
_
,
" not csary
" aren
' t words that should be associated with it
.
but that wasn
' t my onyl gripe
. john carpentery isnt a nmae associated with cutting
- edge cinema
, as infact the intense scares of
_ halloween
_
,
_ thte hting
_
and
_ tghe prince of darkness
_
, or teh offbeat action ofthe
_ htey live
_ adn
_ excape from newyorker york
_
. unfortunatly
, the only thing thgat isnt cutting edge baout
_ vampires
_ isnt tyhe levle ofthe boredom hte movie is able tothe reach
. withthe an anemic plot anbd nto
- quite
- kosher spacial effects
,
_ john carpenter
' s vampires
_ has bearly enough substance tothe slake the thirst ofthe even the least discerning genre fan
. thte film isnt at first conserned wiht a gropu of roaming vampire slayers
, led by james woods
, of all peopel
. liek some sort of holy a
- team
( they even have theri pwn souped
- up van
)
, teh bunch invade adn wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack
. theri method is amusingly inovative
: tyhe blood
- suckers are reeled out wtih harpoons so tehy cin flare uv in tghe sun liek matchsticks
. to commemorate theri victory
, the loutish b
and decorates a motel room whith hookers
and parties the night away
. their celebration isnt short
- lieved
, howver
, as a master vampire named valek ambushes
and single

andedly destroys most of thge team
. woods
' jack crow
and buddy montoya
( daniel baldwin
) escape with their lives
, along with a woman named katrina
( sheryl lee
)
. all
though the woman hasnt been bitten
, montoya anbd crow decide tothe keep katrina forthe her psychic link tothe the master vampire
. the rest ofthe tje movie isnt concerned with tghe boys
' hunt forthe valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
, a freaky marilyn manson
- tipe who
' s onthe a mission thast dates bcak 600 years
. along the way htey pik uv a priest named guiteau
( tim guinee
)
, a charater who serves preety much teh same purpose as the jittery cpl
. upham in
_ saveing private ryan
_
. smoe stuff happens inwhich the middle ofthe tjhe movei
,
but i cxan
' t remember most of it
, beccause i oftenly foudn a twitching hair in thte corner of the frome mroe intresting tahn wqat ws hapening onthe screen
.
_ vampires
_ finaly starts tothe pick uv about 90 mintues inot tghe mix
, as crowm
, guiteau
, anbd montoya assault an b
andoned prision
- turned vampire nest
. onyl
then does the film beign to even ressemble a carpenter flick
. bu it
' s too little too late
. we get the inevatible fianl confrontation
, bu it seems tacked on
and rether anti
- climactic
( come on
, we
' re dealing with
_ thte
_ master vampire here
!
) interestingly
, lastr summer
' s vampire actioner
_ blade
_ was derived from a comic book
, adn
_ vampires
_ fomr a novel
,
yet the latter seems more steeped infact campy cheesiness thna teh fromer
, a omre deliberate superhero flick
. woods
' jack crow spouts glib off
- thte

- liners
and strolls away ffrom exploding buildings wtih taht oh
- so
- cool stride
. adn his motive forthe killing vampires
? tkae a wild guess
.

_
_
_
.
) at least
_ blade
_ had decent action adn slick stylishness
.
_ vampires
_ lacks even cheap thrills tothe mask its gossamer
- thin plot
. tothe make up for thsi
, the movei resorts tothe other
" shocks
,
" such as its generaly condescending atitude towards women
( crowm slaps them aroud fo yhe funn of it
) annd an overplayed contempt for religion
( crowm teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow ofthe celibacy hasnt made him prone tothe
" getting woodies
.
"
) it cxan be argued that maeby i wanted too much from this movie
. if nto scayr
and gory
, i wanted tense
, relentless
,
and exhausting
.
_ john carpentery
' s vampires
_ is none of theese
. i can only recomended it forthe hte hardcore carpentery fan
. fo the rest of ytou looking for a ogod scare
, beware
:
_ vampires
_ is a film with no teeth
.
