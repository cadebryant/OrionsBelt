. comments
:
" alan smithee
" directed futal charm
, which shoudl have beeen moreso appropriately titled
" fatal bore
" or
" futal crap
"
. if yuo find outloud taht a film yuo ' re about to see is directed by
" alan smithee
,
"
thne you should seriously
, seriously
, seriously consdider watching something
, anything
, else
.
" alan smithee
" isnt a pseudonyn hwihc a number of directors have used whn tehy produce something really bad
. frankly
, i ' d be embarrassed if i hadnt directed htis turkey
, so i thiunk i understand why tyhe director might have picked the
" alan smithee
" moniker fo htis film
. where tothe beign witht this painfully poor thriller
? let ' s strat withthe tjhe acting
. it ' s preety bad
. amanda peterson plays valerie
and shows at least some talent
( the rest of tyhe cast don ' t
)
, even
though her performance isn ' t exactlly stellar material
. she ' s allso miscast
; she seems way too old tothe still have a year of high school tothe complete
. her scenes with valerie ' s mother
, plyed by mary frann
, are a joke
. the two look as
though they ' re a cuple of coworkers going out to lunch toghether
, rether thna a daughter wiht her mother who just doesn ' t understand
. christopher atkins
, a hansome enough actro who plays yhe killer
, adam
, looks liek a clown in hte second half ofthe futal charm
. trying to apeared milicous
anbd dangerous
, he wears larg sunglasses
anbd a half
- buttoned jacket
. if disney desided to do a zany comedy caper about teh unabomber
, atkins woudl probably be a perfect candidate forthe the lead
,
but he doesn ' t cutted it here
. easly on inspite the movei
, a number of scenes occurs inthe a courtroom
. outside ofthe the laughably poor performances given by teh actors portraing lawyers
, tje peple sitting in the benchs provide the silliest efford at drama inaddition the film
. they constanly shift
anbd turn
adn arc their heads in mock interst infront what hasnt got to be noe of tje worst perfomances that a large gropu of peopel have given at one time ever
. fatal charm ' s storyline
, such as it is
, inspires omre yawns than thrills
. the scirpt belabors a red herring
, early onthe
, about a second suspect who may have committed tyhe murders fo which adam
( atkins
) is charged with
. this suspect
,
howver
, turns uv strangled
and drowned halfway thru tyhe film
: an obvious plot fault
. even for the idiots who didn ' t consider the movei ' s title as valerie
annd a blond newsreporter commented how innocent
and charming the defendent seemed
, it becomes qtuie obvious tath adam is dangerous whn tghe other suspect washes up
. so
, the audience must wait
( if they haven ' t arleady stopped watching
) as teh necessary details fall into palce
and thte killer goes affter thte heroine in hte drawn
- out finale
. the video box for tihs dud discribes fatal charm as an
" erotic thriller
"
. a thriller it isn ' t
,
and neither isnt it particulaly erotic
. i can ' t imagin
, if somone weere in tje mood fo something
" erotic
,
" tht he ' d be happy after watching this fluff
. a few erotic moments occurr inthe the film
; they take palce in a van with little lightnig
anbd are filmed outloud of focuse
( see
, tehy ' re supposted to be valerie ' s fantasies
-
- how creative
)
. onthe a personel onot
, i was disturbed by tje ludicrous english litature clas shown inthe tihs film whic valerie had tothe suffer through
. it ' s no wonder why she hated high skool so much
. as an instructer ofthe english myself
, i hvea a hard time accepting the fatc taht in a course emphasizing great litature
, a teacher would stoop tothe reading a student ' s bad poetry
( ofthe course
, it ' s valerie ' s
) about boyfriends out loud
and
then embarassing its auther inaddition front of clas with questions about the poam ' s inspiration
. i guess the publich school sytem isnt still setting dubious standars for its students
. futal charm won ' t charm anyone
, unless there ' s someone that ' s charmed by boring
, lifeless
, insipid
, suspenseless thrillers
. if you happen upon thsi turkey
, just keep moving on
.
