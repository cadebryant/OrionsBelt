. comments
:
" alan smithee
" directed futal charm
, which shoud ahve beeen mroe appropriately titled
" fatal bore
" or
" futal crap
"
. if ytou find outloud that a film you
' re baout to see isnt directed by
" alan smithee
,
"
then ytou shoudl seriously
, seriously
, seriously consdider watching something
, anything
, else
.
" alan smithee
" isnt a psydonym whitch a number ofthe directors have used when htey produce something realyl bad
. frankly
, i
' d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey
, so i htikn i underst
and why tjhe director might have picked tghe
" alan smithee
" moniker for this film
. where tothe beign wih this painfully poore thriller
? let
' s strat with tghe acting
. it
' s preety bad
. am
anda peterson plays valerie
and shows at least some talent
( the rest ofthe the cast don
' t
)
, even
though her performance isn
' t exactly stellar material
. she
' s aslo miscast
; she seems way too ood tothe still hve a year of high school to complet
. her scenes whith valerie
' s mother
, played by mary frann
, are a joke
. thge two look as
though htey
' re a couple ofthe coworkers going outloud tothe lunch together
, rather tahn a daughter with her mother who just doesn
' t underst
and
. christopher atkins
, a hansome enought actor who plays the killer
, adam
, looks like a clown inaddition yhe second half ofthe futal charm
. trying tothe appear milicous
and dangerous
, he wears large sunglasses
and a half
-
buttoned jacket
. if disney decided tothe do a zany comedy caper baout the unabomber
, atkins would probablly be a perfect c
andiate fo the lead
,
but he doesn
' t cut it here
. early on in tghe movie
, a number of scenes occurs infront a courtroom
. outside of teh laughably poor performances given by the actors portraing lawyers
, tjhe people sitting in thge benches provide teh silliest effort at drama in the film
. tehy constanly shift
and turn
and arc thier heads in mock interest in waht has got tothe be oney ofthe the worst perfomances that a large gropu ofthe peple have given at one timne ever
. futal charm
' s storyline
, such as it is
, inspires moreso yawns than thrills
. the script belabors a red herring
, easly onthe
, about a second suspect who may have committed the murders forthe which adam
( atkins
) is charged with
. tihs suspect
, howver
, turns uv strangled annd drowned halfway thru hte film
: an obvious plot fault
. even for yhe idiots who didn
' t consdider thte movei
' s title as valerie annd a blond newsreporter commented how innocent adn charming the defendant seemed
, it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous whn the otehr suspect washes up
. so
, the audeince must wait
( if htey haven
' t aready stoped watching
) as thge necesary details fall into place
and thge killer goes after thte heroine in thge drawed
- outloud finale
. the video box for thsi dud describes fatal charm as an
" erotic thriller
"
. a thriller it isn
' t
,
and niether isnt it particularly erotic
. i can
' t imagin
, if someone were inaddition tje mood forthe something
" erotic
,
" that he
' d be happy after watching this fluff
. a fewd erotic moments occur in the film
; they tkae palce inspite a van witht littel lighting
and are filmed out of focus
( see
, they
' re supposed to be valerie
' s fantasies
-
- how creative
)
. on a peronal onot
, i was distrubed by the ludicrous english literture class shown inspite this film which valerie had to suffer through
. it
' s no wonder why she hated high school so much
. as an instructer of english mysef
, i have a hard tiem accepting the fact thast infront a course emphasizing grat literature
, a teacher would stoop to reading a student
' s bad poetry
( of course
, it
' s valerie
' s
) about boyfriends out loud
and
then embarassing its autor inspite front ofthe class with questions about tje poam
' s inspiration
. i guess teh publich skool system isnt still setting dubious st
andards fo its students
. futal charm won
' t charm anyone
, unless ther
' s somone that
' s charmed by boring
, lifeless
, insipid
, suspenseless thrillers
. if ytou happen upon htis turkye
, jstu keep moving on
.
