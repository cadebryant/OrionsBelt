( i
' m paraphrasing
)
" type of excange isnt used at least four times in teh oppening ten mintues ofthe the film
, each tyme getting progressively less funny
. what htey should ahve stolen were teh background sighth gags wich were so effective iin the zucker brother
' s films while writing thier own dialogue
. director rick friedberg focuses moreso on thte mug shots of his actors
( especially nielsen
, who can dont tihs quite well
) thna onthe the delivery
and context ofthe theri lines
, much ofthe the time cutting the punchline short
. the whole film seems tothe be inspite a race with itself to be over
, as isnt evident in thge fianl sequence
, where htere isnt no comedic denouement after the climax
. as wass usual infact yhe zucker brothers films
and infront spy hard
, thge end credits tend to replace thsi by being out ofthe context
. one ofthe the moreso amusing ws
,
" captian of thte enterprise
