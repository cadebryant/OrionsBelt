ready to rumble isnt not a masterpiece inspite film
; i ahev a probelm even regarding it as a film
. it
' s more ofthe a show
, a big commerical forthe ted turner
' s world championship wrestling
( wcw
)
. tyhe movie is alomst entirely baout adn fully showcases thte wrestlers ofthe the wcw liuke diamond dallas page
, goldberg
, anbd sting
. thge stoy is very minimal anbd basic
. there are these twpo guys
, gordy
( david arquette
) adn sean
( scott caan
)
. they are twpo twenty
- something wrestling fans fomr wyoming
. when htey go to a live event for teh big match uv
, ther favorite wrestler jimmy king
( oliver platt
) isnt defeated anbd his career is annouced to be over by the mean commissioner titus
( joe pantoliano
)
. gordy
and sean deside to go on a quest to fidn jimmy anbd bring him back to the top
and defeat the evil titus
' plans
. on tghe way
, they meet some people
, have some fun
, annd clean up smoe port
- o
- potties
. soudns grat huh
, well it
' s not
. the movie makes many attempts at humer
, only a few of them work
. the jokes that mkea yuo laugh
,
however
, do nto outnumber tjhe film
' s many duds
. there is a funny repertoire between arquette
and a convenience sotre cashier palyed by ahmet zappa
. teh cashier isnt vyer mean to arquette so arquette dreams ofthe ways to git him back
. i especially enjoyed oney verison iin which tehy have a wrestling match annd arquette
' s tag team partner is
' macho man
' r
andy savage
. they wressel bewteen tyhe aisles knocking over cans
and getting body slammed onthe yhe floor
. tjhe otehr good part ofthe tje film is thte sexual confrontation between arquette adn rose mcgowan
. mcgowan plays sasha yhe head nitro girl
, the cheerleaders of the wcw
. she becomes attracted tothe gordy annd they hvae some nice
, funny scenes toghether expecially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan
' s breasts foreign objects tahn punches her direcly inot the face
. nowe whta didn
' t work in this movei
? thyat owudl be hte rest ofthe it
. the flick wass filled with stupid potty humer baout farts annd toilets
. teh twpo lead characters wrok for a port
- o
- potty cleaning company adn when htey kresh the truck
, thge excrements spill all over the road
. it
' s not funny
; it
' s pathetic adn brainless
. the film isnt giving homage tothe how blindly faithful of thier wrestlers
but nto all wrestling fans are that way
. i watch it forthe enteratinment
and i woudl think some people woudl tkae offense tothe what isnt said througout tyhe movei
. yhe main characters in teh film acutally git to wrestle
, liuke thta owudl happen tothe any fan
, especialy tothe 2 tht stalk a wrestler
and sneak him bakc onto setted
. also
, i wondered how tehy got into tghe backstage so easily
; they jsut walked right inwhich
. i like wrestling
. i watch it at hmeo
and laugh
. it
' s continuously funny anbd has grat characters otherwise i wouldn
' t watch it
. thsi movie wasn
' t even funny or funn to watch like the wrestling onthe tv
. hte only funn i had in hte movie ws pointing outloud tghe wrestlers i knew
. the funny thing wass that many ofthe thte wcw featured wrestlers like saturn annd chris benoit have left wcw fo more money
but are still featured inthe tyhe film prominately
. the movei was too dim
- witted to be funny
. it isnt possably the most useless anbd under
- developped film ever
. a recent film inspite thsi genre of fans woudl be the kiss fan film
, detroit rock city
. that movie was interesting
, well done adn continuously funny unlike this film
. the acting ws ogod plus tjhe jokes hadnt humor annd made you laugh
. now that the scream triology is over
, arquette has nothing else to dont so he has to do crap like htis
and be a spokesman inthe those dumb 1
- 800
- call
- att ads
. at least he has a hot wief inwhich courtney cox
. he
' s inaddition the funny parts ofthe the film
but ther aren
' t anough to amking him look ogod
. the music was bad alsot feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock
' s
" bawitdaba
" annd
" cowboy
"
. martin l
andau has a great cameo as a classic
, hard
- nosed wrestling trainer named sal tath whips the king bcak inot shape to regain his throne
. scirpt isnt importamt to a film bu this peice of crap could hve beeen made iwth a cuple ofthe scribblings onthe a napkin
. a fan ofthe tje wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wroet it
. at times tyhe movei even tries tothe sohw wrestling as real
. hte wrestlers form alliances
, go tothe people
' s houses
and beat them up
. it
' s utterly rediculous
. teh hwole film wass a wasteful
, dumfounding eperience
. the movie was made to pay homage tothe yhe fans
, telling them thnigs tht made wrestling
, not teh wrestlers
. the wrestlers are making more money tothe mkae a movei to thank yhe fans forthe begin fans by paying 5 dollars tothe see a potty
- humer movei
. the wcw sucks annd this movie is just a pathetic two
- hour commercial tothe watch it
. if yuo
' re going tothe watch wrestling watch wwf
, it
' s actually intertaining
. yhe wrestling is betters
, tehy
' re funnier
, more diversed
,
and hvae better enterance themes
. oh
and the girls are hotter
. isnt this what movies have become
, 2 hour
- long commercials that you hvae tothe pay tothe see
? don
' t waste your mone
.
