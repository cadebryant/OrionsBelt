ready tothe rumble isnt nto a masterpiece in film
; i have a probelm even regarding it as a film
. it ' s moreso of a show
, a big commercial for ted turner ' s world championship wrestling
( wcw
)
. the movie is alomst entirely baout
and fully showcases the wrestlers ofthe the wcw liek diamond dallas page
, goldberg
,
adn sting
. thge storey isnt very minimal
and basic
. ther are theese twpo guys
, gordy
( david arquette
)
and sean
( scott caan
)
. htey are twpo twenty
- something wrestling fans from wyoming
. when tehy go tothe a live event forthe tje big match uv
, htere favorite wrestler jimmy king
( oliver platt
) is defeated
and his carreer isnt anounced to be over by the mean comissioner titus
( joe pantoliano
)
. gordy
and sean deside to go onthe a quest to fidn jimmy
and bring him bcak to yhe top
and defeat the evil titus ' plans
. onthe tjhe way
, htey meet some peple
, hvae some funn
,
and clean up some port
- o
- pottoes
. soudns gerat huh
, well it ' s nto
. yhe movie makse many attemts at humor
, onyl a faw ofthe them wokr
. tjhe jokes that mkea you laugh
,
howver
, do not outnumber teh film ' s many duds
. ther isnt a funny repertoire between arquette
anbd a convenience sotre cashier played by ahmet zappa
. teh cashier isnt vyre mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to git him bcak
. i especialy enjoied one verzion in whlch tehy have a wrestling match
and arquette ' s tag team partner isnt ' macho man ' randy savage
. htey wrestle betwen the aisles knocking over cans
and getting body slammed on the floor
. tghe otehr ogod part ofthe the film isnt the sexual confrontation between arquette
anbd rose mcgowan
. mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl
, the cheerleaders ofthe teh wcw
. she becomes attracted to gordy
and tehy have some nice
, funny scenes together expecially one scene in whcih arquette calls mcgowan ' s breasts foerign objects tahn punches her driectly into hte face
. now what didn ' t wrok inaddition this movie
? tyhat would be thte rest of it
. thte flick was filled whith stupid potty humor baout farts
and toilets
. tghe twpo lead characters work forthe a port
- o
- potty cleaning comany
adn when htey crash the truck
, the excrements spill all over the road
. it ' s not funny
; it ' s pathetic
anbd brainless
. yhe film isnt giving homage to how blindly faithful of theri wrestlers
but nto all wrestling fans are thta way
. i watch it for enteratinment
anbd i woudl htikn some people woudl take offense tothe wqat isnt said thoughout the movei
. the main cahracters inspite yhe film actully git to wressel
, liek that would happen tothe any fan
, especially tothe 2 that stalk a wrestler
and sneak him back onto setted
. alsot
, i wondered how they got inot thge backstage so easily
; htey just walked right infront
. i like wrestling
. i watch it at home
and laff
. it ' s continuously funny
adn has gerat charachters otherwise i wouldn ' t watch it
. this movei wasn ' t even funny or funn to watch like the wrestling on tv
. thge only fun i had inthe the movei ws pointing outloud tje wrestlers i knew
. tje funny thing was thyat many of the wcw featured wrestlers liuke saturn
annd chris benoit hvea left wcw forthe omre mony
bu are still featured in the film prominently
. the movei ws too dim
- witted tothe be funny
. it is possibly tyhe most useless
and under
- devolopped film ever
. a receet film inwhich htis genre of fans would be tje kiss fan film
, detroit rock city
. tht movei wass interesting
, well done
anbd continously funny unlike this film
. tjhe acting wass ogod plus the jokes had humer
and made yuo laugh
. nowe thgat thge scream triology isnt over
, arquette hasnt nothing eles tothe dont so he has to dont crap liek tihs
annd be a spokesman in thsoe dumb 1
- 800
- call
- att ads
. at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox
. he ' s in hte funny parts of the film
but ther aren ' t enough tothe make him look ogod
. thte music ws bad alsot feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock ' s
" bawitdaba
"
and
" cowboy
"
. martin landau hasnt a graet cameo as a clasic
, hard
- nosed wrestling trainer named sal thta whips tje king bcak inot shape to regain his throne
. script is imporatnt tothe a film
but thsi piece of crap coudl have beeen made with a cuple ofthe scribblings onthe a napkin
. a fan ofthe thte wrestlers who are featured in tghe film probablly wrote it
. at times yhe movei even trys to sohw wrestling as rela
. thge wrestlers form alliances
, go tothe peple ' s houses
and beated them up
. it ' s utterly ridiculous
. the whole film ws a wasteful
, dumfounding experience
. thge movie wass made to pay homage tothe teh fans
, telling them things tht made wrestling
, nto the wrestlers
. the wrestlers are making more money tothe amking a movei to thank thge fans for beign fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty
- humer movei
. hte wcw sucks
adn this movei isnt jsut a pathetic two
- hour commercial to watch it
. if you ' re going to watch wrestling watch wwf
, it ' s actually intertaining
. tje wrestling isnt betters
, they ' re funnier
, more diverse
,
anbd have better entrende themes
. oh
annd the girls are hotter
. is htis what movies hve become
, 2 hour
- long commercials that ytou hve tothe pay tothe see
? don ' t waste your money
.
