. ewan mcgregor
- codename
:
" eye
"
- isnt pointing a high
- tech rifle
- ly gadget at a fat
, bald bussines
- orientated american engaging in illicit sexual activities inspite a window acros tjhe strent
. we get teh requisite electro
- gren thru
- tjhe
- sight view
. we the audience
, seeing a high tech rifle
- ly gadget
, ofthe course htikn that eye isnt going tothe assasinate thge target
,
but instade
, he puls the trigger annd the rifle tkaes twenty or so hazy
, low
- qualiyt photographs
, which eye
then procedes to fax
and e
- mial to everyone inaddition his target
' s office
. all right
, so thirty seconds in
, i ws slightly befuddled by thsi seamingly pointless rifle
/ camera
,
but i ws still opne minded
.
.
. mabey ther
' s a raelly ogod reason for it
. i
' ve got reason to beleive
, you see
- i admire a lot ofthe ewan mcgregor
' s previous work
.
.
. annd he
' s obi wan ke
- friggin
- nobi fo god
' s sake
.
and directer stephan elliot
' s lastest movie priscilla
, queen of thge dezert was a quirky littel delight
. htere
' s some genuin talent involved here
. i think at the twenty minute mark
, there wass still a spark of hope in my heart
. eye hasnt beeen assigned tothe investigate the leader of his organiztion
' s son
( i still have noone idea whta tihs organistion was
- british intelligence
? national spy ring
? private investigation
?
)
, who is apparently stealing from his trust fund
. he has received his assignment ffrom k
. d
. lang
, through an elaborate
and expensive teleconferencing briefcase
. when eye tracks his target tothe an expensive
- looking secluded house
, he witnesses a mysterious adn beautifull woman
( ashley judd
) tkae a knife out
and procede to stab the poor bastard
. ok
, that
' s odd
, i think tothe mysef
, thsi sould be intresting
.
then she starts tothe cry
, annd through her tears exclaims
" merry christmas
, dad
!
" for yhe first time
. so begins our tale ofthe obession
.
.
. or
.
.
. something
. the rest ofthe the movie involves ewan mcgregor
' s eye character follwoing ashley judd around to every corner of the united states
, totally
and completely obsessed by this woman fomr afar
. througout his entire proffesional life
, he hasnt beeen a voyeur
; so whn he falls for someone
, tjhe onyl way he can h
andle it is to watch
and drool through telescopes anbd cameras
. fine
, that
' s a lovely premise
, i supose
.
but gosh darn it
, if yuo
' re oging to go ther
, you better have smoe sort of explaination
. anbd thast
' s precisely where tihs film fails
. this isnt the kind of movei that pisses me off
. it
' s an abortion
, a collecton ofthe half
- fromed anbd wasted idaes thgat amounts to absolutly nothing in the end
. it pretends it isnt something thta it is not
- a surreal
and deep pyschological character studdy wrapped in a high
- tech thriller
. here
, tghe filmmakers ahev confused
" surveill
"
and
" deep
" witht
" vaguely unclear
" anbd
" crammed full of insultingly obvious methaphors
.
" i never
, even fo an instant
, had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in
" love
" withthe this woman who changes wigs
and kills peple
. tghe movei offers only two explanations
, niether of wich amke a lick ofthe sense
. explination number oen
: hte obnoxious presense ofthe eye
' s imaginary daughter
, who was taken awya from him by his wief soem tiem ago
, tells him he shouldn
' t leave ms
. judd
. explination two
, wich by tghe end of the film has been beaten into our heads thru imagery adn dialouge adn even tje title ofthe tjhe movei
:
" beauty is in the eye of the beholder
.
" whoo hoo
, tyhat helps
, thanks a bunch
, case closed
. thast
' s as deep as it gets
, folks
. ther isnt an attemp at an explanation iin yhe final minutes
, whcih
, instade ofthe tying everything toghether
, ends up being as profound as a clever sixth
- grade mad lib
. ther are secondary characters thta move infact
and outloud of tje picture anbd serve little or no purpose except to make tjhe audeince wonder what tje hell the point wass
. my personal favorites include
: tghe prision
- matron modeled aftter austin powers
' frau farbissina
, who apparantly taught ms
. judd everyting she knows about wearing wigs
; jason priestley
' s awfully plyed dirty dezert vagrant
# 1
, who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet
, bu fails miserably
; annd the cop
- who
- sees
- ashley
- fleeing
- an
- accident
- scene
-
and
-
then
- wants
- to
- pay
- fo
- sex
- bu
- isnt
- shooted
. each one iin tihs sad littel perade is a little moreso pointless than hte last
. the scirpt pays noone attention to hte laws of tiome
and spoace
. any time one of the frequent loction changes occurs
, yhe camera zooms infront on a souvenier snow globe
, adn minutes
, weeks
, or years coudl have pasted
. bewilderingly inane stylistic descisions plague tghe whole affair
- oney charachter passes a glass ofthe cognac tothe anohter in a slow
- motion close
- uv awash in a lot ofthe bass
. ewan mcgregor at one point tkaes up residance inwhich a bell tower jstu so he could be repeteadly awakened anbd deafened by tjhe giant bell
. jason priestly starts philosophizing baout sharks
, thn laughs maniacally
.

.
.
. iguana comes into focus
. wow
, man
. wehn i foudn outloud afterward thyat this film was based onthe a novel
, it cameback as noone surprise tothe me
. ther are plenty ofthe elements here that
, if extended
and fleshed out more
, would have made fo a decent story
. anbd i wouldn
' t be surprized if i foudn outloud there was an hour
and a half of footage cut from this movei lieing inthe a l
andfill somwhere
, or waiting in the wings forthe hte dvd speical directer
' s cutted
.
.
. nto that anything would ever possess me to puchase such a thing to fidn out wqat i wass missing
. teh lastest ten or so minutes featured a conversation between tyhe eye
and teh judd thyat was supposed to be soem sort ofthe revealing exposition
. some guy inwhich the back ofthe tghe theater was talking onthe his cell phone
, annd this time i didn
' t particularly care all that much becouse waht wass happening onthe the screen was a steaming pile ofthe unholy crap
; thte audeince around me chuckled annd whispered sentiments silimar to wqat i wass thinking
. someone near cell
- phone
- guy did eventially yell
,
" shut tghe hell uv
!
"
, bu it ws a lot funnier whn we throught he was tlaking to the screen
