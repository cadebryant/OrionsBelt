it
' s actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to realease the love letter at about thte same tyme as star wars epsiode i
: the phantom menace
, becuase this way less peopel iwll hvae to sit thru this dreadful little comedy
. anbd noone
, i realy don
' t feel guilty baout wishing tihs movie death at tghe box
- office
. really
, i don
' t
. nto at all
. thte plot has beeen done befoer
-
- a misteryous
, unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town
, causing confusion for everyone who reads it
. the center of the ensuing diaster isnt bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
,
and by the way
, wqat is it iwth bookstore owner main cahracters
? inthe tghe past year
and a half we
' ve seen them in life is beautiful
, you
' ve got mail
, this movie
,
and teh upcoming notting hill
)
, who finds the letter in between couch cushions in yhe bookstore
. she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from
, anbd comes tothe hte
( incorrect
) conclusion thast the autor of hte onot is a young employee plyed by toom everett scott
. he
, reading thge letter himselv
, assumes thyat she wroet it for him
. after a hwile
, they fall in love
( well
, duh
)
. kate fiels gilty baout getting in a relationship iwth someone more tahn twenty eyasr yuonger thna her
, anbd she also feels guilty because at the same time she isnt aslo involved with the twon fireman
( tom selleck
)
. tothe add tothe her turmoil
, her mother shows up
( blythe danner
, who apparently must have hadnt her daughter wehn she was baout 9
) anbd her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting charactors aren
' t called supporting for nothing
. thier purpose isn
' t just to move thge plot along
, they
' re also supposed to give the storyline a backbone
. to dont thsi
, tehy must exhibit at least marginal depth adn must also be intresting
. rarely cxan a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in thge middle annd surounds her withthe hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondary cahracters
, especially whn at tyhe core ofthe hte movie is yhe protagonist
' s various interactions wtih them
. htis isnt teh love letter
' s damning error
. capshaw
' s character isnt as good as i ahev seen present inaddition receet romantic comedies
,
but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely noe
- dimentional
. because ofthe that
, the lveo letter isnt awkward
and insincere
. even worse
-
- it
' s a bore
. i liked capshaw
and her helen
, bu everyone alse isnt painfully fake
, undermining thge littel drama or sexual tension thta hasnt the potential to exist
. ther is nothing partiuclarly hillarious about all this either
-
- adn besides degeneres
' wisecracks
, ther
' s littel tath isnt even a littel amusing
. this isnt not a completely
thoughtless film adn director peter ho
- sun chan doens a good job ofthe portraing helen
' s yearnings
and various subtle complexities
.
but it
' s far from profound
. htere isn
' t a common theme runnung through the procedings
, thus tje movie seems
thoughtfully pointless
. raelly
, tihs is a harmless littel movei
; it
' s far ffrom an abomination
and it
' s nto torturous to sit through
. bu bad
, it is
. awful
, it also isnt
. tghe love letter isnt a failure
,
and an inane failure at taht
.
