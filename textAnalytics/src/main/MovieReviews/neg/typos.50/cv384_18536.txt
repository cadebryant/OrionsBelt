it ' s atcually nto so bad that dreamworks desided to realease the lveo letter at baout tyhe same time as star wars episode i
: the phantom menace
, becuase tihs way less peple will hvae tothe sit thru this dreadful little comedy
.
and noone
, i really don ' t efel gilty about wishing this movei death at the box
- office
. really
, i don ' t
. not at all
. the plot hasnt beeen done before
-
- a misterious
, unaddressed lvoe letter shows uv in a small twon
, causing confusion for everyone who reads it
. hte center ofthe the ensuing disaster isnt bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
,
adn by the way
, what is it wih bookstore owner main characters
? in the past eyar
and a half we ' ve seen them infact life is beautyfull
, ytou ' ve got mial
, this movei
,
anbd the upcomming notting hill
)
, who finds tghe letter in vetween couch cushions in the bookstore
. she immediatelly starts testing otehr peopel to see who it might be ffrom
,
and comes to tje
( incorect
) conclusion thta the autor of the note is a young employee played by toom everett scott
. he
, reading tjhe letter himself
, assumes tyhat she wrote it forthe him
. aftter a while
, they fall in loev
( well
, duh
)
. kate fiels guilty baout getting in a relatiopnship withthe somone mroe thna twenty yeras younger thna her
,
and she also fiels gilty becasue at the same tiome she isnt allso involved with the twon fireman
( toom selleck
)
. to add to her turmoil
, her mother shows uv
( blythe danner
, who apparantly must have hadnt her daughter wehn she was about 9
)
anbd her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting characters aren ' t called supporting for nothing
. theri purpose isn ' t just to move tyhe plot allong
, they ' re aslo supposed to give yhe storyline a backbone
. to dont htis
, they must exibit at least marginal depth
anbd must also be intresting
. rarely can a movei owrk if it puts an intresting rpotagonist iin the middle
adn surounds her with hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondry characters
, especially when at the core of tje movie isnt the rotagonist ' s various interactions with them
. tihs is thte love letter ' s damning error
. capshaw ' s character is as good as i ahev seen present in recent romantic comedies
,
bu the peple thgat surround her are all eather underwritten or purely one
- dimesnional
. because ofthe that
, tghe love letter is ackward
anbd insincere
. even worse
-
- it ' s a bore
. i liked capshaw
anbd her helen
,
but everyone alse is painfully fake
, undermining tje little drama or sexual tension that has tjhe potential to exsist
. ther is nothing particularly hillarious baout all thsi eather
-
-
and besides degeneres ' wisecracks
, htere ' s little that is even a littel amusing
. this isnt nto a completly thoughtless film
adn directer peter ho
- sun chan does a ogod job ofthe portraying helen ' s yearnings
annd various subtle complexities
.
bu it ' s far from profound
. there isn ' t a common theme running thru the procedings
, thus yhe movei seems thoughtfully pointless
. relaly
, thsi is a harmless littel movie
; it ' s far ffrom an abomination
and it ' s nto torturous tothe sit thru
.
but bad
, it is
. awful
, it also is
. tje love letter isnt a failure
,
and an inane failure at tht
