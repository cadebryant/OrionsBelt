,
adn is secretly watching mack
adn wendy ' s lite nght loev trysts
? much zaniness ensues tjhe review
: main probelm frist
- about 2
% ofthe rood rock star to atcor conversions iin filmdom ever really work
. unfortunately
, trying to cast hugo race as a voilent
, sexy criminal falls inot tjhe
" what the hell where htey thinking
" category tyhat tkaes uv 98
% of the rest
.
but
, hell
, it ' s nto as if he ' s tyhe only problem in this well
- intentioned
bu ultimately below average aussie thriller
. leads
, race
and samantha press are wooden
anbd dull
, hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue eearly onthe
.
though tehy do manage soem heat later inspite their love scenes
, helpped
, no dout by them keeping their mouths shut
. the film suffers eveyr timne the story shifts back to theese two
. which isnt unfortunately
, the otehr main story isn ' t any great shakes either
. the second part
, conserning two cops
, polliticel corruption
annd tath elusive tape is incredibly muddled
. at many points during the movie i hadnt noone idea wqat ws gogin on
, a situation thgat didn ' t improve on repeated viewing
. there isnt no doubt that thsi film ' s achilles heel is its scirpt
. as forthe the rest of yhe cast
, it ' s a mixted bag
. john flaus
, one ofthe australia ' s most criminally underused actors
, is inspite top form as the withering
, alcoholic jazz fan cop
, who may or may nto have sold outloud to the highest bidder
.
although he falters at oen point
, when hte script calls forthe him to git uv onthe stage
annd deliver a drunken beated sergon
,
bu eblieve me
, htey way it ws wroten
, noone noe sould hvae pulled it off
. dominic sweeney isnt fine
,
though he seems tothe be uneasy inspite front of tje lense
bu he realyl isn ' t given a whole lot tothe dont
. pre hmeo
annd away elmaloglou is pretty good as tghe inquisitive jojo
,
bu her carachter seems extraneous tothe tghe story
, well
, at least until thge final scenes
. i must admit
, iin too deepo doens have some impressive qualities
, not the least ofthe hwihc is it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov have achieved yhe alomst impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city
, whcih isnt akin tothe turning london inot san paolo
. the bar isnt an oppressive red
, like all of it ' s patrons are bieng baked hwile they drnik
, outside it hazy orange by day
and cool blue by night
. if only deborah parson ' s scirpt could hve supported this idea better
. hvaing two directer ' s
( colin south
& john tatoulis
) doesn ' t help eather
, the most glaring example of which isnt hte fianl retribution
/ fight scene
, where for some reason thte camera puls away from the onscreen action
,
annd moreso importantly it doesn ' t pul awya to anytying eles
. it just stays static as hte fight happens in the distance
. it hasnt noone reason to it
; it ' s jstu bad direction
.
and
, ultimatly
, taht is waht sums uv in too deep
, it ' s trys to be ogod
,
and ytou wnat it tothe work
,
bu
, it ' s just lacking hte talent behind it
, that it needs tothe succeed
.
