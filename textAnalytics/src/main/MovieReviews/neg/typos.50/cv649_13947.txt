, fifteen year old sister
( rebecca elmaloglou
) hasnt moved inthe wtih her
,
and isnt secretly watching mack
and wendy
' s lite nihgt lveo trysts
? much zaniness ensues the review
: main probelm first
- about 2
% ofthe rood rock star to actor conversions inwhich filmdom ever really work
. unfortunately
, trying to casted hugo race as a voilent
, sexy criminal falls inot tjhe
" what teh hell where they thinking
" caetgory taht tkaes uv 98
% of thte rest
. bu
, hell
, it
' s not as if he
' s thge onyl probelm infact this well
- intentioned
but ultimatly below average aussie thriller
. leads
, race
and samantha press are wooden
and dull
, hampered by soem unfortunate attemts at sexy dialogue eary on
.
though htey do manaze some heat later inspite their loev scenes
, helpped
, noone doubt by them keeping their mouths shut
. hte film suffers eveyr tyme tjhe story shifts bcak tothe these twpo
. which isnt unfortunatley
, hte other main story isn
' t any graet shakes either
. the second part
, concerning two cops
, political corruption
and thyat elusive tape is incredibly muddled
. at many points during the movei i had noone diea wqat wass going onthe
, a situation that didn
' t improve on repeated viewing
. htere isnt no dout that thsi film
' s achilles heel is its script
. as for the rest of the cast
, it
' s a mixed bag
. john flaus
, one of austrailia
' s most criminally underused actors
, isnt in top form as the withering
, alcholic jazz fan cop
, who may or may not hvea sold out tothe the highest bidder
. altho he falters at one point
, wehn the script calls forthe him to get up onthe stage anbd deliver a drunken beated sergon
,
but believe me
, they way it wass written
, no oney could have pulled it off
. dominic sweeney isnt fine
,
though he seems to be uneasy in front of tjhe lense bu he really isn
' t given a whole lot to dont
. pre hmeo
and awya elmaloglou is preety good as the inquisitive jojo
, bu her character seems extraneous to the stoy
, well
, at least until the final scenes
. i must admit
, inspite too deep does hve some impressive qualities
, not hte least ofthe which isnt it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov ahve achieved hte almost impossible by makeing melbourne look liek a sweat drenched tropic city
, which is akin tothe turning london inot san paolo
. the bar isnt an opressive red
, like all ofthe it
' s patrons are bieng baked while htey drink
, outside it hazy orange by day annd kool blue by night
. if only deborah parson
' s scirpt coudl have supported thsi diea better
. haveing twpo directer
' s
( colin south
& john tatoulis
) doesn
' t halp eather
, thte most glaring example of which isnt yhe fianl retri
bution
/ fight scene
, where fo smoe reason the camera puls awya ffrom the onscreen action
, adn moreso importantly it doesn
' t pul away to anything else
. it jsut stays static as thte fight happens inspite the distance
. it hasnt no reason tothe it
; it
' s just bad direction
.
and
, ultimatly
, that is what sums up in too deepo
, it
' s tries to be ogod
,
and ytou watn it to work
,
but
, it
' s just lacking thte talent behind it
, thgat it needs tothe suceed
.
