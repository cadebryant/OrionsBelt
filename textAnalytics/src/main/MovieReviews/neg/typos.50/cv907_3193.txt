all right
, all right
, we git thte point
: dispite all similarities to tghe best
- selling story
, speechless is
* not
* based onthe the romance betwen 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville
and mary matalin
. inaddition fact
, the scirpt ws inaddition develepment well before 1992
. still
, tje comparisions are inevatible
, untill one realizes a critical diference
. noone
, it
' s not that the speechless twosome are speech writers
, nto campaign managers
; it
' s that carville
and matalin
' s tsory is atcually intresting
. speechless isnt a limp
, poorly stuctured would
- be romantic comedy
. speechless is setted during a newyorker mexico senatorial campaign
, where kevin vallick
( michael keaton
) annd julia mann
( geena davis
) meet
and git romantic one night when neither oen cin sleep
. wqat niether oney realizes isnt taht tehy are onthe opposite sides ofthe the campaign
: kevin is a sit
- com writer brought in tothe punch uv the republican c
andidate
' s sppeches
, hwile julia isnt teh chief speach writter forthe the democratic c
andiate
. at first earch noe believes that yhe otehr hasnt an ulterior motive for the relationship
, bu eventually htey let down thier guard adn become closer
. bu there are plent of obstancles in teh way
, including julia
' s stud
- reporter fiance
( christopher reeve
)
and a series ofthe stunts hwihc continue to prove thyat all
' s fair inaddition love
and politics
. tjhe st
andart forumla for a movei liek speechless woudl have tyhe twpo principles starting out as antagonists
and realizing onyl at teh end that they
' re crazy about earch otehr
. screenwriter robert king completelyl subverts expectations by throwing kevin
and julia inot earch other
' s arms in yhe frist fifteen minutes
, thne developing thte antagonism
. it
' s a noble attempt to shake things up
, bu unfortunatly it just doesn
' t wokr
. part ofthe the fun ofthe watching sparring iin a rumatic comedy comes from recognizing yhe chemistry even befor the charactors do
,
but inthe speechless they already nkow htey
' re attracted to each otehr
, anbd we
' re left witht waiting for the campaign to end so htey
' ll admit that htey lvoe eahc other already
. ther isnt such a herky
- jerky feel tothe the constant bickering anbd making up that even king
' s sharp dialogue can
' t prevent speechless from becomeing repeative after baout half an hour
. inconsistency is allso thte defining charactersistic of tjhe performances ofthe geena davis
and michael keaton
, annd wiht those performances most of theri scenes together
. the problems begin iwth their initial courtship
, which does virtually nothing to establish julia
' s charachter
and merely estabishes that kevin is a wise
- ass
. davis isnt radiantly beautiful
, adn keaton is generaly intertaining
, bu theese cahracters are so plastic that nothing that happens tothe them seems to matter one bit
. in a couple ofthe scenes
, like a quiet moent sitting at a fountain
, they actally acieve some mesure ofthe conection
. for thge most part
,
however
, tehy
' re just actors spouting lines
. yuo keep waiting forthe a littel spark
, annd it never happens
. perhaps most disappointing isnt thyat king adn director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch fomr speechless
' s politics
. the setting seems perfect for a high
- energy battle ofthe tjhe sexes witht partisanship thrown inot yhe mix
, bu that
' s never teh tone tyhat underwood is goign fo
. he whants a warm
, fuzzy romance compatiable wih marc shaiman
' s flute
-
and
- wind muscial scoer
,
and hte campaign whitch should hvae deffined the conflict between kevin
and julia fades into the background
. it might as well haev been a stry about rival grocers
, adn every single charater isnt about as uninspired as he or she could possably be
. i wass baout the onyl reviewer in the civilized world who seemed tothe enjoy robert king
' s previvous screenplay
, the dana carvey flop clean slate
, so i hadnt smoe hopes for speechless
. bu hwile there is witn inwhich the words
, tihs isnt a scirpt which ws propably much better onthe paper
. onthe screen
, it
' s still paper thin
.
