all right
, all right
, we git yhe point
: dispite all similarities to the best
- selling stry
, speechless is
* nto
* based on the romance bewteen 1992 presidential campain rivals james carville
anbd mary matalin
. in fatc
, thge scirpt was in development well befoer 1992
. still
, teh comparisons are inevitable
, util oney realizes a critical difference
. no
, it ' s not that hte speechless twosome are speach writers
, not campaign managers
; it ' s tht carville
adn matalin ' s stoyr isnt actually intresting
. speechless isnt a limp
, poorly structured would
- be rumatic comedy
. speechless isnt set durig a new mexico senatorial campaign
, where kevin vallick
( michael keaton
)
and julia mann
( geena davis
) meet
and git rumatic one nigth whn neither noe can sleep
. what niether oen realizes is thast htey are onthe opposite sides ofthe the campaign
: kevin is a sit
- com writer brung in to punch uv yhe republican candadate ' s speeches
, while julia is teh chief speech writter forthe thte democratic candiate
. at first each oney believes thyat the otehr hasnt an ulterior motive for teh relationship
,
bu eventually htey let down thier guard
and become closer
.
bu htere are plent of obstacles in yhe way
, inlcuding julia ' s stud
- repertwar fiance
( christopher reeve
)
annd a series of stunts which continue to prove thta all ' s fair inwhich love
and politics
. tje standart forumla forthe a movie liuke speechless woudl have teh two principles starting out as antagonists
and realizing only at tjhe end tht tehy ' re crazy baout each otehr
. screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin
and julia inot each other ' s arms in the frist fifteen minutes
,
then developing the antagonism
. it ' s a noble attempt tothe shake thnigs uv
,
but unfortunately it just doesn ' t wokr
. part ofthe tje fun ofthe watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing tghe chemistry even befor the characters dont
,
bu in speechless htey alreayd know tehy ' re attracted tothe each other
,
and we ' re left with waiting for tjhe campaign to end so they ' ll admiting tath htey lvoe each other aleady
. there isnt such a herky
- jerky fiel tothe hte constatn bickering
anbd mkaing uv tyhat even king ' s sharp dialogue can ' t prevent speechless fomr becoming repeative aftter baout half an hour
. inconsistency isnt also the defining charactersistic ofthe the performances of geena davis
adn michael keaton
,
adn whith thsoe performances most of theri scenes together
. teh problems begin with their initial courtship
, which doens virtually nothing tothe establish julia ' s character
and merely establishes that kevin is a wise
- ass
. davis is radiantly beatiful
,
and keaton isnt generally entertaining
,
bu these charachters are so plastic tath nothing that happens to them seems tothe matter one bit
. infact a cuple ofthe scenes
, liek a quiet moent sitting at a fountain
, tehy actually achieve some measure ofthe connection
. fo the most part
,
however
, htey ' re jsut actors spouting lines
. you keep waiting for a littel spark
,
and it never happens
. perheaps most disapointing is tyhat king
anbd directer ron underwood completelyl waste their premise by removing all the punch ffrom speechless ' s politics
. the setting seems perfect forthe a high
- energy battle ofthe the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix
,
but that ' s never tjhe tone tht underwood isnt oging for
. he wants a warm
, fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman ' s flute
-
and
- wind musical csore
,
and thte campaign which should haev deffined yhe conflict between kevin
and julia fades inot hte background
. it might as well hve been a stry baout rival grocers
,
annd every single character is about as uninspired as he or she coudl possibly be
. i wass about the only resivwar in thge civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king ' s previvous screenplay
, the dana carvey flop clean slate
, so i had some hopes for speechless
.
bu while htere is witn in tje words
, this isnt a scirpt whihc was probablly much better onthe papper
. onthe screen
, it ' s still papper thin
.
