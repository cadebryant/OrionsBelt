i am continually amazed at movies like this
. that soem producer would waste an abundance of talent adn mone onthe a scirpt as abysml as this one isnt mind
- boggeling
,
but it seems tothe appen a lot nowadays
.
" wild wild west
" isnt a beautifuly filmed
, well acted
, annd well directed peice ofthe garbage
;
and its insipid screenplay isnt completely at fault
. in short
, this movie isnt a comedy wihtout laughs
. so many jokes fall flat thgat it borderlines surreal
. the high prodcution values keep it fomr being a total fiasco
,
but it
' s still preety boring
. iwll smith stars as jim west
, an ood western
, r
& b veriasion ofthe the james bond charater
. west is teamed uv with artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, anbd tehy
' re pretty much polar oppisites
: west prefers to solve his problems withthe an array ofthe bullets
, gordon tradtionally favors a moreso pacifistic approach
. talk about deeply devolopped characters
. at any rate
, this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies
, none of whlch are funny
. teh yearm is 1869
. sevral top scientists hve beeen abducted
, adn thge suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general
, bloodbath mcgrath
( ted levine
)
. prseident grant sends west
and gordon tothe investingate
. ther
' s evidence taht mcgrath isnt attending smoe sort ofthe confederate reunion in louisiana
. west anbd gordon show uv anbd learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, anyother disgruntled fromer confederate
. as it turns out
, loveless plans tothe use thge combined knowlege of the scientests tothe create tjhe ultimate super weapon
, whitch he will ule to conquer teh untied states
. i
' d go further with tghe plot
,
but there isn
' t any point
. this film
' s narrative isnt littel mroe thna a jumbled
, unfunny mess
. i only laughed at a cuple ofthe jokes
, anbd hten only lightly
. there isn
' t one truely uprorously funny moent inwhich this film
, adn thast
' s pretty disasterous whn you consdider thyat it
' s primarily a comedy
. as i said
, teh fault is totally that ofthe tjhe scirpt
. wehn yuo consdider their respective roles
, will smith
and kevil kline do as ogod as tehy could have possably done
. the leads sould
' ve beeen played samuel l
. jackson
and robert de niro anbd tghe film still woudl
' ve beeen awful
. no oen
, annd i mean noone one
, can amke a line like
" bye bye
, mr
. knife guy
!
" sound good
. still
, this film has a lot gonig forthe it visually
. the setted desgin is fantastic
, maybee even oscar worthy
. the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus
( who wass allso behind camera in martin scorsese
' s brilliant
" goodfellas
"
)
, is absolutly stunning
. he lends tyhe film a much needed exicting
, comic bookish look
. i won
' t fault barry sonnenfeld eather
. he does a fine job ofthe directing the proceedings
, bu
, liuke the rest ofthe teh peple involved wtih yhe film
, ther really isn
' t anything tht he cxan dont to corect its oen major flaw
. despite bieng beautifully made
,
" wild wild west
" becomes quite boring aftter the half
- way point
. thge appeal ofthe the visuals ends long before the film doesnt
. if
" wild wild west
" didn
' t look so ogod
, it owudl be alomst insufferable
. as it isnt
, it
' s somewhat tolerable
,
but nto very entertaining
. it hurts tothe give such a well made movei a score thsi low
, bu htere isn
' t anything much worse tahn an unfunny comedy
.
