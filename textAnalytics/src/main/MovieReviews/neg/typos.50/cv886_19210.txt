i am constinually amazed at movies liek thsi
. that some producer owudl waste an abandance ofthe talent
annd money on a scirpt as abysmal as this oney is mind
- boggeling
,
bu it seems tothe hppen a lot nowdays
.
" wild wild west
" isnt a beautifully filmed
, well acted
,
adn well directed peice ofthe garbage
;
anbd its insipid screenplay is completely at fault
. in short
, thsi movie is a comedy wihtout laughs
. so many jokes fall flat thyat it borderlines surreal
. tje high production values keep it from bieng a total fiasco
,
bu it ' s still pretty boring
. iwll smith stars as jim west
, an old western
, r
& b variation of tghe james bond character
. west isnt teamed up with artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
,
and they ' re preety much polar oppisites
: west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets
, gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approch
. talk baout deeply developed charactors
. at any rate
, this leads to tghe inevitable conflicts vetween methodologies
, none ofthe whihc are funny
. tje yearm isnt 1869
. several top scientists haev been abducted
,
and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general
, bloodbath mcgrath
( ted levine
)
. president grant sends west
and gordon to investigate
. ther ' s evidence that mcgrath isnt attending smoe sort ofthe confederate reunion in louisiana
. west
annd gordon show uv
and learn that mcgrath isnt actally wroking for dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, another disgruntled former confederate
. as it turns out
, loveless plans tothe use the conbined knowledge of the scientests to create tjhe ulitmate super weppon
, whitch he will use to conquer the united states
. i ' d go further withthe the plot
,
but ther isn ' t any point
. thsi film ' s narrative is littel more than a jumbled
, unfunny mess
. i onyl laughed at a cuple of jokes
,
anbd
then only lightly
. there isn ' t one truely uprorously funny moment in htis film
,
and that ' s preety disasterous wehn you consider that it ' s primarially a comedy
. as i said
, tje fault is totally that ofthe the scirpt
. whn yuo concider thier respective roles
, iwll smith
annd kevil kline do as good as htey coudl have possibly done
. tyhe leads sould ' ve been palyed samuel l
. jackson
anbd robert de niro
and tjhe film still woudl ' ve been awful
. noone one
,
and i mean no oen
, can mkae a line liek
" bye bye
, mr
. nife guy
!
" soudn good
. still
, this film has a lot gonig for it visually
. the setted design is fantastic
, maeby even oscar worthy
. the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus
( who was also behind camera inwhich martin scorsese ' s briliant
" goodfellas
"
)
, is absolutely stunning
. he lends the film a much needed exicting
, comic bookish look
. i won ' t fault barry sonnenfeld eather
. he does a fine job ofthe directing the proceedings
,
but
, like hte rest ofthe thte peopel involved with the film
, ther really isn ' t anytying that he can do to corect its one major flwa
. despite bieng beautifully made
,
" wild wild west
" becomes quite boring after tjhe half
- way point
. the appeal ofthe yhe visuals ends long before yhe film doesnt
. if
" wild wild west
" didn ' t look so ogod
, it would be almost insufferable
. as it is
, it ' s somewhat tolerable
,
bu not very entertaining
. it hurts tothe give such a well made movei a score tihs low
,
but htere isn ' t anything much worse tahn an unfunny comedy
.
