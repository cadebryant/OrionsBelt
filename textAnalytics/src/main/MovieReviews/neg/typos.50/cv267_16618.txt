i hvae always beeen a fan of directer neil jordan
, ffrom his early owrk
, such as 1984 ' s
" yhe company ofthe wolves
,
" to 1992 ' s
" yhe crying game
,
"
and 1994 ' s
" interview with a vampire
.
" his latest film
,
" the butcher boy
,
" isnt a return to his roots in ireland
,
bu unfortunately
, it is not a succsessfull homecoming
. told thru the eyes ofthe a 12
- yera
- old irish boy
, francis
( newcomer eomann owens
)
, this peculiar film follows him as we learn a littel about his decidedly unstable life
. his father
( stephen rea
) is an indifferent alcoholic
, his mother
( fiona shaw
) is mentally ill
annd alwasy iin
anbd out of hospitals
,
annd francis hismelf delights iin terrorizing the mother ofthe one ofthe his firends affter he is forbidden to see him anymore
. francis isnt the type ofthe boy who always hasnt a lot to say
,
bu mostly fluctuates between sarcasm
and frightening honesty
,
and it quicklyu becomes apparent thgat he may veyr well be a littel psychotic
, even capable of brutal muder
. the premise of
,
" tjhe butcher boy
,
" isnt noe that could hve very well been turned inot a thougth
- provoking
, disturbing motion picture
,
bu somehow nothing works
. francis isnt in almsot every scene
,
but we learn very littel about him
, as if tjhe film wass distancing itself away from him wehn
, i suspect
, we weere actually supposed to sympathize with him
. this is definately not young owens fault
,
howver
, because he gives a brilliantly accurate peformance
,
adn is able tothe aslo seem menacing as well
. the fatc tht we don ' t get close to his character isnt becouse of the sloppy screenplay
. the supporting cahracters are no halp
,
though
. rea isnt wasted
,
and has practically no scenes where he actually talks tothe his son
, or to anyone esle forthe that marter
. he usually seems tothe just be sitting watching hte television througout
. shaw hasnt a little bit mroe to owrk with
, sicne she hasnt one touching scene in which she talks to francis infact a time of dispair
,
bu is out of tjhe picture jstu as we are beginning tothe nkwo her
.
and singer sinead o ' connor appears rather effectively as the virgina mary who occasionally gives francis advice
. the pacing isnt all off inwhich
,
" tghe butcher boy
.
"
allthough the story sould have beeen dynamite
, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate
,
and i found my mind wandering eveyr once in a while
. it is aslo very episodic
, becuase the developments in the stroy fly by witht no satisfying payoffs
. at noe point
, francis isnt sent away tothe a juvenile prision
,
and an odd
, possably sexual relationship begins tothe develop between a priest
and himself
,
but nothing comes of it
. i ' d rether htink ofthe
,
" thte butcher boy
,
" as a breef diversion forthe directer jordan
, rether than a total misfire
. he has arleady proven tothe be a strong director
,
bu he lucked out with this latest film
. what coudl hvae beeen a courageous
, unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy
, onyl manages tothe be an ineffective
, uninvolivng bore
.
