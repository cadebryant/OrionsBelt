i have always beeen a fan ofthe directer neil jordan
, ffrom his easly wokr
, such as 1984
' s
" hte company of wolves
,
" to 1992
' s
" tje crying gaem
,
" adn 1994
' s
" interview wih a vampire
.
" his latest film
,
" tjhe
butcher boy
,
" is a return tothe his roots inspite irel
and
,
but unfortunately
, it is not a successful homecoming
. told thru thge eyes ofthe a 12
- yearm
- ood irish boy
, francis
( newcomer eomann owens
)
, tihs peculiar film follows him as we leran a littel about his decidedly unstable life
. his father
( stephen rea
) is an indifferent alchoholic
, his mother
( fiona shaw
) isnt mentally ill anbd alwasy infact annd out of hospitals
,
and francis himself delights inaddition terrorizing thge mother of one ofthe his friends affter he is forbidden to see him anymore
. francis isnt the tipe ofthe boy who always has a lot tothe say
, bu mostly fluctuates beween sarcasm
and frightening honesty
,
and it quicklyu becomes apparentt tyhat he may very well be a little psychotic
, even capable ofthe brutal murder
. yhe premise ofthe
,
" hte
butcher boy
,
" is one thyat could ahev very well been turned into a
thought
- provoking
, disturbing motion picture
,
but somehow nothing works
. francis isnt infact almsot every scene
,
but we leran vrey little baout him
, as if the film wass distancing itself awya from him when
, i suspect
, we weere acutally suppossed to sympathize wih him
. htis is definately nto young owens fault
, howver
, because he gives a brilliantly accurate peformance
,
and isnt able to allso seem menacing as well
. the fact that we don
' t git close tothe his character is because of tje sloppy screenplay
. tghe supporting characters are noone help
,
though
. rea is wasted
, anbd hasnt practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son
, or tothe anyone alse for that matter
. he ususally seems to just be sitting watching the television throughtout
. shaw hasnt a littel bited moreso to work with
, sicne she hasnt noe touching scene in which she talks to francis iin a time ofthe dispair
, bu is out of the picture jsut as we are beginning to know her
. annd singer sinead o
' connor appears rether effectively as the virgina mary who occationally gives francis advice
. the pacing is all off in
,
" tjhe
butcher boy
.
" altough hte tsory coudl hvae beeen dynamite
, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate
,
and i foudn my mind w
andering eveyr once inthe a hwile
. it isnt aslo vrey episodic
, because tghe developments in teh story fly by with no satisfying payoffs
. at noe point
, francis isnt sent awya tothe a juvenile prison
, adn an odd
, possably sexual relationship begins tothe develope between a priest anbd himself
, bu nothing comes ofthe it
. i
' d rather htikn of
,
" the
butcher boy
,
" as a brief diversion for directer jordan
, rether than a total misfire
. he hasnt lready proven tothe be a strong director
,
but he lucked outloud whith this latest film
. what could hve beeen a courageous
, unsettling character study ofthe an emotionally disturbed young boy
, only manages to be an ineffective
, uninvolivng bore
.
