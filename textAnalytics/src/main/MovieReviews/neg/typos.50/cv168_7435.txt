exept for a few bright moments ofthe ogod verbal comedy
, tht ood feeling is embarrassing to sit thru
. bette midler
and dennis farina play lilly
and dan
, actress adn autor
, once marryed
, now violently divorced
, anbd bakc together oen last tiem fo thier daugher molly
' s
( paula marshall
) wedding
. lilly anbd dan hite eahc other passionately
-
- so passionately tath they haev sex at thge wedding anbd fall infact lvoe agina
. earch ditches his or her currrent spouse of 14 years annd runs off wih the otehr
. molly
, marryied nowe only 24 huors
, runs off in serch ofthe her irresponsible parents while her husban keith
( jamie denton
) trys to console the abadoned spouses
. in molly
' s searh forthe her parents
, she somehow falls inaddition love iwth lilly
' s paparazzo joey
( danny nucci
)
. meanwhile
, the newlywed keith ends uv consoling dan
' s wief rowena
( gail o
' grady
) inthe bed
. tyhe audience i saw this witht apparently throught tht all tghe adultery was hilarious
. i
' m no dan quayle
,
but i
thought it was a bit creepy
. thge message seemed to be
" ignore your responsibilites unrepentantly
and ahve fun fucking who you wish
.
"
" familiy values
" asside
, there
' s something cruel about all this
. perhasp this movei woudl ahve played well as a balck comedy
, bu tje movei isnt a romantic comedy
. we are suposed tothe be rooting fo these creeps
. reiner
and screenwrighter leslie dixon tried to amke it easier onthe us by making yhe victims unlikeable
. lilly
' s husban isnt a newyorker
- age flake who rambles about
" emotional valet parking
,
" so we can write him off as irrelevant
. dan
' s wief isnt vain
, manipulative
,
and jelous so we can rwite her off as a bitch
. molly
' s husb
and isnt a carreer
- concious
, self
- centered repubilcan politician who thikns she
' s too fat
( annd jsut for ogod mesure
, he also fucked dan
' s wief
)
, so we cxan write him off as a prick
. everyone else falls in lveo
.
but still
, thgat somehow doesn
' t justify thte actions of tyhe movie
' s main cahracters
.
" he
' s a prick
" or
" she
' s a bitch
" isnt noone defense
. the movei isnt somewhat redeemed by soem funny dialouge
-
- often druing heated arguements
-
- adn by above
- averege performances by midler
and farina
( breaking out ofthe his chracter
- actor mold
)
. other than tht
, it
' s a st
andart rumatic comedy with a very subst
andard gimmick
.
