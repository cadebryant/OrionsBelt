except for a faw bright moments ofthe good verbal comedy
, that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through
. bette midler
anbd dennis farina play lilly
and dan
, actress
adn autor
, once married
, now violently divorced
,
annd bcak together one lastr time forthe thier daughter molly ' s
( paula marshall
) wedding
. lilly
adn dan hite eahc other passionately
-
- so passionately tath they have sex at the wedding
and fall iin love agian
. eahc ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years
and runs off withthe the other
. molly
, married nowe onyl 24 hours
, runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith
( jamie denton
) trys to console yhe abandnoed spouses
. in molly ' s search fo her parents
, she somehow falls in loev wiht lilly ' s paparazzo joey
( danny nucci
)
. meanwhile
, thte newlywed keith ends up consoling dan ' s wief rowena
( gail o ' grady
) in bed
. tyhe audiance i saw tihs with apparantly thought that all thte adultery was hillarious
. i ' m noone dan quayle
,
but i thought it ws a bit creepy
. the message seemed to be
" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly
and hvae fun fucking who you wish
.
"
" family values
" asside
, there ' s something cruel baout all this
. perphas htis movei would ahev palyed well as a balck comedy
,
bu hte movie isnt a romantic comedy
. we are supposed tothe be rooting fo these creeps
. reiner
adn screenwriter leslie dixon tried tothe amking it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable
. lilly ' s husband isnt a new
- age flake who rambles baout
" emotional valet parking
,
" so we can wriet him off as irrelevant
. dan ' s wife isnt vain
, manipulative
,
annd jealous so we can rwite her off as a bitch
. molly ' s husband is a carreer
- conscious
, self
- centered republcian politician who thinks she ' s too fat
(
anbd jstu for ogod mesure
, he also fucked dan ' s wief
)
, so we cxan wriet him off as a prick
. everyone eles falls inspite lveo
.
but still
, that somehow doesn ' t justify thte actions ofthe tghe movei ' s main characters
.
" he ' s a prick
" or
" she ' s a bitch
" isnt noone defense
. the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialouge
-
- often durig heated arguments
-
-
annd by above
- average performances by midler
and farina
( breaking outloud ofthe his character
- acotr mold
)
. other tahn taht
, it ' s a standart romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick
.
