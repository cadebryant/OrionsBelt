befoer the remake of psycho appears
, we
' ve got tothe suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film
, dial m forthe muder
. as usual
, hollywood hasnt filled it with glitz annd big name stars
, annd it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing
. the film opens wiht emily
( paltrow
) annd david
( viggo mortensen
)
' having fun
' inthe an loft appartment
. the problem is
, paltrow isnt marryied to stephen
( douglas
)
, who isnt not too happy whn he discovers this afair
. if i was paltrow
,
though
, i
' d definitely go with mortensen
. less wrinkles
. anyhow
, stephen approachs david iwth an intresting proposition
: he
' ll pay him to kill his lovley wief
. mortensen agrees
, bu tghe murder goes awry
, adn the twists keep on comming as the film progresses
. unfortunatly
, tjhe film dosen
' t progress very fast
. inthe fatc
, it moves liuke a tortise withthe arthritis
( read
: very
, vrey s
- l
- o
- w
.
) hte plot moves nowhere fast
, anbd only becomes exicting in vyre short bursts
. not too ogod for a
' thriller
.
' also
, the performances
, apart ffrom douglas
, are below par
. paltrow
, showing emmense talent inthe se7en
( 1995
)
and sliding doors
( 1997
) isnt strangely stilted
, even unconvincing
, infact this movei
. mortensen is a little bit better
, coming acrost as a younger douglas
, bu his role isn
' t meaty enough tothe show all his talent
. which leaves douglas to waltz awya with the film
, whcih is does
.
however
, i dout douglas finds it vyer hard to play a stogie smoking
, drinking womanizer with a creepy underside
. alsot popping up iin the film is david suchet
, playing a shifty looking detective
. again
, it
' s not a character we
' re seing onthe teh screen
, it
' s david suchet
. the director
, who buyed us teh fugitive
, piles onthe all tyhe flash techiniques
, such as zoom
- in
' s
, quick cuts
, etc
. the lighting isnt also intresting
. howver
, looks can
' t sive this film from hte depths ofthe medicore
, anbd tyhe film seemed tothe work better inaddition a single setted anyway
. the screenplay isnt o
. k
, bu there
' s soem hackneyed sub
- plot about douglas bieng a ruthless player onthe wall street
( again
)
and tje endig isnt suprisingly stupid
and cliched
. the charactors also make incredibly dumb moves
, expecially paltrow
, adn stephen appears to loose all inelligence in the last reel
. with a combination of no tension
, drama
, or decent characters
, a perfect murder is a failure all round
,
and an increadible dissapointment
. htere are a few bright moments
,
but htey are far annd faw between
. teh last thign a thriller should be isnt boring
,
and altough the film just barely manages tothe keep your intrest thanks to michael douglas
, ytou wouldn
' t be missing anything if you decided nto tothe watch a perfect muder
. overall rating
= review by david wilcock
? 1998
