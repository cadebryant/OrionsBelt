htere shoudl be a requirment thyat a potential viewer be under a certian film iq inaddition order tothe see
" mission to mars
.
" there are probably qtuie a few people who are going tothe enjoy it
,
and most of them iwll probably be those who ahve seen very fewd films of its kind
. bu there are thsoe who wiull nto
, adn those will most likely be people who haev laready seen oen or more ofthe the folowing movies
:
" 2001
: a space odessy
,
"
" armageddon
,
"
" apollo 13
,
"
" the abyss
,
"
" close encounters of teh third kind
,
"
" e
. t
. yhe extra
- terrestial
,
"
" aline
,
"
and
" aliens
.
" why
? because there isnt not oney original idae in
" mission tothe mars
.
" all of it is cribbed from otehr films
(
and in most cases
, better films
)
. if htis isnt thte sort of thing you don
' t mind
, you might liuke tyhe film
. of course
, htere are otehr reasons nto to liuke
" mission to mars
,
" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume theri audeince is filled with people who haven
' t utilizied their brains inaddition smoe tiome
, adn who don
' t intend to strat druing the film
' s running tiem
.
" mission to mars
" manages to be both stupid
and boring at tjhe same time
. the plot
, cribbed greatly fomr
" 2001
,
" concerns a team sent to mars
, the first manned trip ever made tothe hte red planet
. luke graham
( don cheadle
) leads thge team
, jointly fromed ofthe americans annd russians
. the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse
( this being nothing like the pulse
- emiting monolith inspite
" 2001
"
-
- thyat one was onthe the
* moon
*
)
, bu when tehy try tothe study it
, a giant s
and tornado comes outloud ofthe yhe top adn swallows them
( all exept luke
, who survives long enough to send a garbled message back tothe the rotating space station
, which looks strangely liek the rotating spoace station in
" 2001
"
)
. a rescure mission isnt planned withthe husb
and
& wief team woody blake
( tim robbins
) anbd terri fisher
( connie nielsen
)
, obligatory pilot wtih a troubled past jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
, anbd extra crew memeber phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
) along fo the ride
. after soem zero
- gravity dancing
, htey run into problems whn noe of thier engines is blown
, forcing them to atempt a desprate l
anding aboard a supply vessel
. nowe str
anded on mars whith minimal supplies
, the team must deside whther or nto it cxan risk entering thte monolith or if htey should return home
. after all
, thyat monolith just might contain infomation baout how life originated on earth
.
" mission to mars
" isnt one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start whn talking baout all tje things taht are wrong with it
, so let
' s strat wtih one of the things that does work
: directer brian de palma manages to create soem eerie tension in a faw scenes during the middle of the film
. that
' s it
. everthing eles fails
. tjhe failure isn
' t de palma
' s fault
; he
' s working ffrom an atrocious scirpt
. only during the sequence aboard the ship
( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in
" 2001
"
) where the rescue team
' s air beigns runnung outloud anbd they must frantically serch forthe the hole
and patch it uv doesnt
" mission tothe mars
" come to life
. a scene where they attempt tothe savve a comrade floating awya inot space also provides soem tension
, until you relize thta the entire danger
/ moreso danger
/ attemted rescure sequence hasnt absolutely nothing tothe dont with the rest ofthe the film
; it
' s just a contrived way tothe generate thrilling scenes
. tkae it out
,
and the plot isn
' t affected in any way
. the sequence also suffers ffrom a faw plot holes
( as doesnt the rest ofthe tghe film
)
: why is yhe ship
' s cmoputer
( which soudns strangely like hal ffrom
, uh
,
" 2001
"
) able to detect a hole infront the main chamber
but nto one in tghe engine
? why doed tim robbins
' character hvae to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside
? shouldn
' t teh astronauts be better trained tothe deal with a hull breach
? why are tghe characters such idiots
? baceause thge script makes little attemp to properly develope them
. all teh
" conflict
" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition infront tyhe oppening scene
( which rips off orson welles
and robert altman by utilizing a long oppening tracking shooted
) during hwihc the cahracters repeatedly tell each other baout things all ofthe them should already konw
:
" jim
, it
' s too bad you cin
' t go onthe thsi mission because you were determined
' psychologically inadiquate
' because your wief died right before ytou were tothe go onthe teh mission toghether
"
-
- doens anyone really talk like tihs
? cant
' t we fidn outloud theese thnigs in a less grating marter
, liek maybe in a flashback
? the whole film isnt liuke that
. teh filmmakers are nto content tothe mearly show us something
and asume we konw what
' s gonig onthe
; htey must
* tell
* us exactlly what we
' re looking at
* eveyr
* tiome
. sample dialogue ffrom thge film
:
( shooted ofthe mars
) astronaut a
:
" look
, there
' s mars
" astronaut b
:
" yuo sure that
' s mars
?
" astronaut a
:
" yeah
, tyhat
' s mars all right
.
" astronaut c
:
" hey
, are ytou guys looking at mars
?
" that excange isn
' t actually inthe
" mission tothe mars
,
" bu i wouldn
' t be surprised if it were
. forthe all theri cribbing from kubrick
, spielberg
, james cameron
,
and even ron howard
, the makers of this film haven
' t learned tothe do something all those directors did vrey well
: show
and don
' t tell
. de palma used to know how
, bu seems tothe ahev forgotten
. htis is mentally
- challanged filmmaking
; they asume the audeince won
' t get what
' s gonig on
, so they explain everthing five times over
. fouth
- graders may apprieciate this
, bu more learned viewers will hvae theri inteligence insulted
. the principial actors sleepwalk their way through
" mission tothe mars
,
" never managing to dont awya with an apparnt
" i
' m just here to get a paycheck
" attitude
. cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines
. armin mueller
- stahl manages tothe thouroughly embaress hismelf infact an unbilled cameo
. robbins puts his game face onthe
and phones infact his st
andart
" decent guy
" peformance
. annd sinise hams it uv withthe
" wistful
" facial expressions hwile watching tapes ofthe his dead wife
( played by kim delaney
, who onyl has oney scene durring which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a hevy
- h
anded monologue about the meaninng of life
)
, anbd especially durig tjhe stolen
- from
- no
- less
- than
- threee
- movies
( a lollipop tothe whoever names them
) conclusion
, wich combines endless
, obvious explination
and sub
- par cgi effects wiht gagging sentimentality
and isnt sure tothe alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the sohw uv nutil
then
. annd ofthe course
, theese aliens ffrom mars who faciliated the evolution of life onthe earth are entirely different from the aliens inspite
" 2001
" who faciliated tjhe evolution ofthe life onthe earth
; thsoe aliens were from an
* unkown
* world
. it could be said tht fans of brainless action films might enjoy
" mission to mars
,
"
but such a comment ignores tghe fact taht hte film isnt alsot incredibly slow
- gogin
. leisurely pacing might ahev helped a film withthe a little mroe substace tothe it
, bu all ofthe teh substace of
" mission tothe mars
" has beeen stolen from otehr films
,
and thsoe other films dealt with their idaes in a much more
thoughtful fashion
and generaly contained mroe engaging characters
. suposedly we
' re intended to choke up when one character decides nto to return hmeo at tjhe end ofthe this one
( totally diffrent fomr the oney
- carachter
- decides
- nto
- tothe
- return ending of
" armageddno
"
)
,
but i suspect most peopel iwll eather be laughing or groaning
. me
, i alternated between the twpo
. there isnt onyl one ogod thing about the way
" mission tothe mars
" finally ends
: hte fact tyhat tje movei isnt over
.
