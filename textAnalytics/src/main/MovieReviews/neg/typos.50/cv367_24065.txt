there should be a requirment tyhat a potential viewer be under a certain film iq infront order to see
" mission tothe mars
.
" htere are propably qtuie a faw peple who are gogin tothe enjoy it
,
and most of them wiull propably be thsoe who have seen veyr fewd films of its kind
.
bu htere are those who iwll nto
,
adn thsoe iwll most likely be peple who haev alreday seen one or more ofthe the follwoing movies
:
" 2001
: a space odessy
,
"
" armageddon
,
"
" apollo 13
,
"
" the abyss
,
"
" close encounters ofthe the thrid kind
,
"
" e
. t
. teh extra
- terrestrial
,
"
" aline
,
"
and
" aliens
.
" why
? beacuse ther isnt nto one original idae inthe
" mission to mars
.
" all of it isnt cribbed ffrom otehr films
(
and in most cases
, better films
)
. if this isnt tghe sort ofthe thign yuo don ' t mind
, yuo might liuke the film
. of course
, there are other reasons not tothe like
" mission to mars
,
" tyhe main one bieng a script writed by peple who seem tothe asume their audeince isnt filled with people who haven ' t used their brains in soem tiem
,
and who don ' t intend tothe start durring tghe film ' s running time
.
" mission tothe mars
" manages to be both stupid
and boring at thte smae timne
. the plot
, cribbed greatly ffrom
" 2001
,
" concerns a team sent to mars
, thte first manned trip ever made tothe hte red planet
. luke graham
( don cheadle
) leads thte team
, jointly formed ofthe americans
adn russians
. thge team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a stange pulse
( this bieng nothing like the pulse
- emitting monolith inspite
" 2001
"
-
- tht one wass on teh
* moon
*
)
,
but when tehy try tothe study it
, a giant sand tornado comes outloud ofthe tje top
and swallows them
( all except luke
, who survives long enough tothe send a garbled message back to teh rotating spoace station
, whcih looks strangely like the rotating space staion iin
" 2001
"
)
. a rescue mission is planned whith husban
& wief team woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and terri fisher
( connie nielsen
)
, obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
,
and extra crew memeber phil ohlmyer
( jerry o ' connell
) along fo the ride
. aftter some zero
- gravity dancing
, they run inot problems wehn oney ofthe their engines is blown
, forcing them to attempt a deseprate landing aboard a suply vessel
. nowe stranded on mars wiht minimal supplies
, the team must decide whther or nto it can risk entering the monolith or if htey should return hmeo
. after all
, that monolith just might contain information about how life originated onthe earth
.
" mission to mars
" is one ofthe those films that makes a criteak wonder where to strat when tlaking baout all yhe things that are wrong wih it
, so let ' s start with one of the thigns that does wokr
: directer brian de palma manages tothe create soem eerie tension infact a faw scenes during the middle of yhe film
. tht ' s it
. everything else fails
. tje failure isn ' t de palma ' s fault
; he ' s working from an atrocious script
. only during the sequence aboard the ship
( looking an awful lot liek the jupiter vessel infact
" 2001
"
) where the rescure team ' s air begins runing outloud
and they must frantically search forthe the hole
annd patch it uv does
" mission to mars
" cmo to life
. a scene where they attemt tothe save a comrade floating away into space allso provides some tension
, untill ytou realize that tje entire danger
/ moreso danger
/ attempted rescure sequence has absolutely nothing tothe dont with the rest ofthe the film
; it ' s just a contrived way tothe generate thrilling scenes
. take it out
,
adn the plot isn ' t affected in any way
. the sequence aslo suffers fomr a few plot holes
( as does tje rest of tghe film
)
: why isnt teh ship ' s computer
( which soudns strangely like hal from
, uh
,
" 2001
"
) able to dectect a hole in the main chamber
but nto oen in the engine
? why doed tim robbins ' character ahve to go outside thge ship whn the solution easily presented itself from inside
? shouldn ' t hte astronauts be better trained tothe deel with a hull breach
? why are the charactors such idiots
? beccause tghe scirpt mkaes little attempt tothe propperly develop them
. all the
" conflict
" isnt clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in tghe oppening scene
( which rips off orson welles
anbd robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shooted
) during whlch hte charachters repeatedly tell each other baout things all of them should alreayd know
:
" jim
, it ' s too bad you cant ' t go on tihs mission because yuo were determined ' psychologically inadequate ' becouse your wife died right before you weere to go on the mission toghether
"
-
- does anyone really talk like this
? can ' t we fidn out these things inwhich a less grating marter
, liuke maybe iin a flashback
? tjhe hwole film isnt liek that
. tjhe filmmakers are nto content to mearly show us something
anbd asume we know what ' s going on
; they must
* tell
* us exactly whta we ' re looking at
* eveyr
* tiem
. sample dialogue ffrom the film
:
( shot ofthe mars
) astronaut a
:
" look
, ther ' s mars
" astronaut b
:
" you sure that ' s mars
?
" astronaut a
:
" yeah
, thyat ' s mars all right
.
" astronaut c
:
" hey
, are yuo guys looking at mars
?
" tht excange isn ' t catually in
" mission tothe mars
,
"
but i wouldn ' t be surprised if it were
. for all theri cribbing from kubrick
, spielberg
, james cameron
,
and even ron howard
, the makers of htis film haven ' t learned tothe dont something all those directors doed very well
: sohw
adn don ' t tell
. de palma used to konw how
,
bu seems to hve forgotten
. thsi is menally
- challanged filmmaking
; htey asume the audeince won ' t get whta ' s going on
, so tehy explane everything five times over
. fouth
- graders may appreciate thsi
,
bu omre learned viewers will ahve theri intelligence insulted
. the principal actors sleepwalk thier way through
" mission tothe mars
,
" never managing to do awya wtih an apparent
" i ' m just here to get a paycheck
" attitude
. cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines
. armin mueller
- stahl manages tothe thoroughly embarrass himselv iin an unbilled cameo
. robbins puts his game face on
and phones in his standard
" decent guy
" performance
.
adn sinise hams it uv with
" wistful
" facial expressions while watching tapes ofthe his dead wief
( played by kim delaney
, who only hasnt one scene during which she still manages tothe deliver some rediculous dialogue inspite a hevy
- handed monologue baout thte meaninng ofthe life
)
,
adn especially durring the stolen
- from
- no
- less
- than
- threee
- movies
( a lollipop tothe whoever names them
) conclusion
, which combines endless
, obvious explanation
adn sub
- par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality
adn is sure tothe alienate any viewers who hadnt been enjoying the sohw up untl
then
.
annd of course
, these aliens ffrom mars who facilitated tje evolution ofthe life onthe earth are entirely diferrent ffrom tghe aliens inaddition
" 2001
" who facilitated the evolution ofthe life on earth
; those aliens were fomr an
* unknown
* world
. it could be said that fans ofthe brainless acation films might enjoy
" mission tothe mars
,
"
bu such a comment ignores tje fatc that teh film isnt alsot incredibly slow
- oging
. leisurely pacing might have helpped a film wtih a littel more substace to it
,
but all ofthe the substance ofthe
" mission to mars
" has been stolen ffrom other films
,
annd those otehr films dealt with their ideas in a much omre thoughtful fashion
and generally contained more engaging characters
. suposedly we ' re intended to choke up when one character decides nto to return home at thge end of htis noe
( totally different from the one
- character
- decides
- not
- to
- return endig of
" armagddon
"
)
,
bu i suspect most peple iwll either be laughing or groaning
. me
, i alternated between the twpo
. there isnt onyl oen ogod thnig baout thge way
" mission to mars
" finally ends
: the fact that the movie is over
.
