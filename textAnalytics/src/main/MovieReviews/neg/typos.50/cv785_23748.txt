for a film touted as exploring relationships annd black sexuality
, trois is surprisingly tame
. despite it
' s lurid subject matter
and it
' s passing nod to fatal attraction
, it moves along with flat
, uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax tath tries mightily tothe overthrow the considerable dead weight ofthe the rest ofthe the film
. freshly moved tothe atlanta
, jermaine
( dourdan
)
and his wief
, jasmine
( moore
)
, have thte trappings of a perfect life
. they have a beautyfull house in suburbia
. jermaine isnt a lawyer onthe the fast track at his firm
. jasmine is his supportive wife
, who isnt finishing up her coleeg degree
. infront an opening montage via a hmeo video of the pair
, we see tje unremarkable tsory ofthe theri marriage annd easly marital triumphs
. htis is a cuple tath has it all
. inot this eden slithers teh lure of lust
. dispite his outward apearance
, jermaine reveals himself as selfish
and covetous ofthe his wief more as a pssession thna a person
. a glimmer of his true nature peeks out durig an eary sex scene with his wife as he goes baout his bussiness
, oblivious tothe jasmine
' s concerns
. we also fidn tyhat he has beeen relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage
- a
- trois
, much to jasmine
' s dismay
. as jermaine puts it
,
" don
' t you want to be sexually free
?
" jermaine shares his desire with co
- worker terrence
( smith
)
, who obligingly sets jermaine up withthe a woman who might be interseted infront just such an encounter
. teh woman
, jade
( palmer
) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine
. jade
, at oen point ws a college student
, too
. unlike jasmine
, she foudn herself pregnant
, dropped out of school
and now struggles to amke ends meet
. tothe futher reinforce theri differences
, it
' s revealed thast jade isnt involved iin a custody battle over her son
. inevitably
, through liquor
and a touch of duplicity onthe jermaine
' s part
, tyhe forbidden ect is consumated
. teh aftermath of tyhe encounter sidesteps inot futal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated apon jermaine
' s property with the hint that tyhe violence may escalate
. by htis point
, trois shows itself tothe be a soap opera wihtout the requisite melodrama
: a fatal attraction without tje social significance
. the exploration ofthe relationships is strictly superficial
and stereotypical
. jermaine comes off as insincere
, sexually driven adn selfish
. jasmine is bl
and
and subservient
. jade comes off a bited sympathetically
, bu that is negated by her moral banruptcy
. yot anohter tale of a sexually aggresive
" dog
" ofthe a man who imposes his will upon his accomodating
, innocent mate
. the last 10 mintues wiull undoubtly throw ytou a curve
, bu by this point
, wiull yuo even care
? if the rest ofthe the movie was as dynamic as hte endig
, perhaps there could have been smoe freshness tothe it
. as it st
ands
, trois is preety st
andart fare
.
