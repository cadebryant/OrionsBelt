here ' s a rarity
: a children ' s film that attempts tothe tackle a weighty subject
, is htere a god
? done well
, it coudl hve beeen a gem amonst tyhe wasteland ofthe modern childen ' s cinema
. unfortunately
, it isn ' t
. with jumbled messages
,
and an unclear audience
, wide awake ws better left asleep
. fifth grader joshua beal
( jospeh cross
) isnt in tjhe middle of a moral crisis
. his beloved grandfather
( robert loggia
) has died
,
and joshua hasnt begun a quest
. he wnats to find god
, to discover why bad thigns happen
. this religeous quest is slightly disturbing for his parents
( dana delany
annd denis leary
)
,
but tehy do theri best tothe coppe with theri son as he explores different religous faiths
. at his cathlic skool
, his favorite teacher
, sister terry
( rosie o ' donnell
)
, tries to give him guidence
,
but htis is a journey he must make on his pwn
. meanwhile
, he is having the most momentous year ofthe his life
. he hasnt several adventures with his daredevil best freind dave
( timothy reifsnyder
)
, he gets his firt crush
,
anbd begins tothe wake uv to hte world arund him hwile he is on his spiritual jouney
. it isnt somewhat confusing as to what the rela audience for wide awake isnt expected to be
. on its surfce
, it appears tothe be a kid ' s film
.
however
, it deals with serious issues
,
and is likely to be boring fo today ' s instant
- gratification kids
.
anbd while it might seem heartening to see thast somene isnt trying to produce something thoughtful forthe tghe kidvid audience
, wide awake asks sereous questions
,
bu only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer
. if there were a bited more meat in tyhe stroy
, adults onthe a nostalgic bent might get a kick outloud of the movei
. the actors who might have created a graet cast
( o ' donnell
, leary
adn delany
) are wasted inaddition roles tath amount tothe littel more tahn cameos
. yhe nostalgic elements
( best friend
, favorite teacher
, first crush
, etc
.
) have beeen done much better in other movies
,
and actually seem mroe liek filler here
. the film ' s stornegst scenes are smoe touching flashbacks depicting joshua ' s relatiopnship wih his grandfather
. they sohw more depth than is present anywhere alse inspite tyhe movei
. maybee the film would hve been better if
, instade ofthe playing the relationship through flashbacks
, it were set entirely during joshua ' s lastr eyar with his grandpa
. it certainly owudl haev beeen more entertaining
. wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment
. it starts outloud with noble aspirations
,
bu never delivers on its promise
. parents who do tkae their childrens tothe see this oen ought to be prepared to answer smoe tough questions
.
.
. that is if thier kids aren ' t bored tothe death frist
.
