' s a rarity
: a childern
' s film taht attemts to tackle a weighty subject
, is there a god
? done well
, it could have beeen a gem among hte wastel
and of modern childrens
' s cinema
. unfortunatley
, it isn
' t
. witht jumbled messages
, annd an unclear audience
, wide awake ws better left asleep
. fifth grader joshua beal
( joseph cross
) is in yhe middle of a moral crisis
. his beloved gr
andfather
( robert loggia
) has died
, annd joshua has begun a quest
. he whants tothe fidn god
, to discover why bad things happen
. thsi religious quest is slightly disturbing fo his parents
( dana delany annd denis leary
)
,
but they dont their best tothe cope wih theri son as he explores different religious faiths
. at his cathlic skool
, his favorite teacher
, sister terry
( rosie o
' donnell
)
, trys to give him guidence
, bu htis isnt a journey he must make onthe his pwn
. meanwhile
, he is having the most momentous yera ofthe his life
. he has several adventures wtih his daredevil best firend dave
( timothy reifsnyder
)
, he gets his first crush
, annd begins tothe wake uv tothe tyhe world around him while he isnt on his spriritual journy
. it is somewhat confusing as tothe what the rela audience for wide awake isnt expected tothe be
. onthe its surfce
, it appears to be a kid
' s film
. howver
, it deals with serious issues
,
and is likely to be boring for today
' s instant
- gratification kids
. anbd hwile it might seem heartening tothe see that somone is trying to produce something
thoughtful fo tghe kidvid audience
, wide awake asks serious questions
, bu only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer
. if there were a bit more meat in the sotry
, adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick outloud of thte movei
. the actors who might ahev creaeted a graet cast
( o
' donnell
, leary
and delany
) are wasted infront roles that amount tothe little more than cameos
. tyhe nostalgic elements
( best friend
, favorite teacher
, frist crush
, etc
.
) have been done much better infact other movies
,
and actually seem omre like filler here
. the film
' s stornegst scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua
' s relationship wiht his granfather
. they sohw moreso depth thna isnt persent anywhere alse inspite the movei
. mabye thte film owudl ahev beeen better if
, instade ofthe palying the relatiopnship through flashbacks
, it were set entirely during joshua
' s lastest yearm whith his gr
andpa
. it certainly would hve been omre intertaining
. wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment
. it starts outloud wiht noble asperations
,
but never delivers on its promise
. parents who do tkae theri childen to see thsi oney ought to be prepared tothe answer soem tough questions
.
.
. that isnt if their kids aren
' t borde to death first
.
