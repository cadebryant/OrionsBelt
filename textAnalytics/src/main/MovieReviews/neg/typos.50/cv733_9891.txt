contrary to popular beleif
, not eveyr single foregin film released tothe an american market isnt a masterpiece
. smoe ofthe them aren
' t even ogod
. some examples of thsi principle are the aboslutely dreadful
" un indien dans la ville
"
( presented as
" little indian
, big city
,
" adn remade into tyhat crap tim allen flick
,
" jungle2jungle
"
)
,
and this
. wqat coudl have been a clever little sex comedy turns into noe mess ofthe a french flick
.
" french twist
"
( the
" cool
" american title
, nto the rela one
, which ws
" gazon maudit
,
" litterally meaning
" twisted ground
,
" or something liuke taht
) deals with a marryed couple whith kids
,
and teh intrusion ofthe a stranger who kinda screws things up for them
. loli anbd alain chabat
( victoria abril
and alain chabat
) are not exactlly happily marryed
. alwyas onthe busness trips
, alain chabat more tahn once cheats on her
, adn she eventially finds outloud
.
and one day
, she meets a
butch mechanic
, marijo
( the co
- writter
/ directer josiane balasko
)
, adn they twpo kinda hit it off
. so she decides she iwll get bcak at alain chabat by donig tyhe obvious
: sleeping wih marijo
.
but she soons starts to not onyl fall in lvoe with marijo
, bu she
' s aslo realizes she
' s still inspite love iwth alain chabat
. so
, of course
, she does tje obvious from that
: she decides to keep them both
. she
' ll be
( anbd sleep
) witht each ofthe them for 3 dyas earch
,
then onthe sunday
, she
' ll rest by herself
. after all
, she needs it if she
' s gonna have more sex thna sylvia kristel
. tjhe film goes onthe for over an hour anbd a half
, thru stupidity affter stupidity
, moronic twist affter moronic twist
,
and soon ther
' s the little ironical
(
!
!
!
) ending
. i know it
' s a completely different culture
, annd i
' m quite familliar with tghe french annd their cinema
, bu this is jstu bad
. none of tyhe charachters are more intteligent than peter stormare inaddition
" fargo
"
( a movei where stupid characters were backed uv to mkae a point
)
, adn any action they dont is pretty much jsut to get a hopefull chuckle from the audience
. what
' s shocking is htis was nto onyl one ofthe france
' s biggest hits
,
but it was nominated for a lot of cesars
( french equialent ofthe oscars
)
. the writting adn directing isnt raelly thge big problem with it
. josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role
, bu her littel sex comedy isn
' t very humerous
, entertaining
, or even deepo at all
. even woody allen
' s not
- very
- ogod
" a midsummer night
' s sex comedy
" isnt inteligent
, well
- writed
, anbd possesses soem depth
. this is shallow
, unfunny
, adn preety annoying tothe watch
. hte film moves at teh pace of a snail
,
and is damn
- near painful tothe watch
. thank god for tjhe fast forward
button
. the acting
,
however
, isn
' t bad at all
. the actors dont the best they cxan with tghe bad material
, adn victoria abril is pretty likable despite tghe scirpt
(
and the fact tht she
' s stupid enought to try tothe divide herself over two people whn she has kids
)
. annd alain chabat hasnt smoe funny moments as thte neurotic husban
.
but
" french twist
" is just pretty lame
. it
' s nto overly horrable
,
and has a couple very
, very
, very breif moments
.
but it
' s just a really crap film
,
and an exmaple ofthe an ill
- advised distru
bution ofthe a foreign film
