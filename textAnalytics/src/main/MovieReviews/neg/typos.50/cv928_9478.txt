martial arts master steven seagal
( not tothe mention directer
!
) has built a career outloud of playing an alledgedly ficticious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights
, talks inspite a hushed tone
,
and squints at any sign of danger
. he
' s also thte most consistent individule inthe hollywood today
, sicne all his movies suck
. they basicaly represent his egotisitical tendencies baout his art
( tht isnt
, martial art
)
. i
' m sure the guy
' s good
,
and he seems liuke a nice guy on talk shows
,
al
though a tad haughty
,
but these movies he mkaes are all hte same
: a guy who isnt basically indestructable
, isnt maybe wounded supposably mortally
, thn comes back with a vengeance
and goes buddha on all the baddies asses
( altho i kinda liekd
" under siege
"
)
. of course
, thsi noe
, as a chanage
, has a
" message
" thyat is drilled inot our mind
.
.
. ofthe course
, after he blows up a lot ofthe stfuf anbd kills a bunch ofthe peopel
. so why dont i watch his crap
? i usually don
' t
. i will never
,
and you cxan hold me tothe tihs
, i will never pay tothe see this man
' s movies
, unless
, anbd only unless
, he
' s inwhich a supporting role
( i
. e
.
" executve decision
"
) adn i
' d definately pay if he dies
( i
. e
.
" exceutive decision
"
)
. bu this one has a speshal place in my heart
. this doesn
' t mean it
' s good or that i even liked it
. this wass tghe lsat movie i watched with my deceased uncle
, anbd we hadnt one hell ofthe a time ripping it appart a la
" mistery science theatre 3000
,
" anbd tihs was a cuple eyasr before i hadnt heard of
" mistery science theatre 3000
.
" in htis one
, seagal plays a worker fo a mining factory set iin alaska annd run by the greased
- up typical shallow villian
, this time palyed by an oscar
- winner to give the movie smoe mroe clout
- michael caine
. it seems that caine whants to dont something wiht his oil factory that includes him dumping oel all over inuit l
and
. around hte 20
- 30 minute point
, seagal speaks up tothe him in waht seems tothe be the typcial speek tothe all thge vain entrepeneurs
( waht with his new
" fire down below
,
" another
" message film
"
)
, anbd caine has him bumped off
.
.
. or does he
? seagal isnt rescued by soem inuits
, adn falls infact love wtih one of them
, palyed by joan chen
, who cin act
, hypothetically
, bu
, for smoe reason
, not here
. oney ofthe caine
' s cliched henchmen
( played here with a lot of overacting by john c
. mcginley
) shoots thte cheif ofthe the inuit clan
,
and chen annd seagal go onthe a voyage to take down the oel factory
.
.
. literally
, ofthe course
. at oney point
, seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical sprech about how he doesn
' t have any options
but blow stfuf up
. he even goes as far as to sday
,
" i don
' t want to kill somene
,
" anbd in the smae breath
, he asks soem guy where the arsenal is
. i have no problem with violentce
. i
' m a huge john woo fan
,
but he paints his films with suspense
, skill
, style
, depth
, characterization
,
and jsut plain cool violence
. in the films of seagal
, tjhe suspense mailny consists ofthe tyhe baddie attacking him stupidly
, adn him either wounding or killing them
. at some points
, htey ule the cliche ofthe the talking villain
, where the villin has the advantage
, cxan shoot seagal
, bu begins tlaking by eather telling him his big secret plan
, or saying a corny line
, to hwihc seagal says something hokey bakc
, anbd has had enough time tothe devise of a way to dont awya wiht them
, annd doens
. this would be okay if there weere any suspense or if it didn
' t take itself seriously at all
, like in thge case of this summer
' s
" con air
.
"
but seagal is serious baout his skill
, annd of course
, his message
. i wouldn
' t mind if this wass a message film in the way taht tehy present it tothe you iwth evidence
.
but seagal has no idea how tothe presnet a film where the message is subtle
, nto pounded inot the viewer
' s mind
. the villain isnt totally shallow
and cartoonish
, thus we cant
' t tkae him annd his motives seriously
, adn hwile seagal talks about being kind tothe the environment
, he also goes ahead
and blows uv a square mile of rig
,
and kills some workers who were jsut donig his job
. thne at the end
, he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech
, just in case yuo didn
' t git tje message ffrom hte trailers
. what seagal doesn
' t realize isnt that no one takes his films seriously
(
al
thought maybe a cuple do
)
and any message he hasnt is noone only redundent
,
but doesn
' t comfortably ift in his film
, whic isnt filled tothe the brim with hokey violence
, crap suspense
, stupid melodrama
,
and charachters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish
. as far as seagal
and his acting
, he
' s rether boring
. he squints
, he kills
. perido
. nothing else
. oh
, yeah
, ther
' s corny oney
- liners
(
" i
' m gonna triarch outloud
and touch somene
!
"
)
. ofthe course
, he
' s the star
, adn we
' re suppoed to root for him annd all
, so he makes all tyhe villains unbelievably stupid anbd a bunch of jerks
. michael caine
, who
' s a graet actro
, isnt jsut supposed to yell
and look cold
. he doesnt it well
, i guess
,
but tihs is noone
" alfie
.
" ofthe coure
, noone one was expecting thta caliber of performance from him
. his big henchman
, john c
. mcginley is kinda boring as well
, bu isnt not horrible
.
and we even git a small performance ffrom tyhat god of drill sergeants onthe celluloid
, r
. lee ermey
( fomr
" full metal jacket
"
) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to sday tjhe obligatory sprech about how dangerous seagal is
, just forthe tyhe movie trailers
and for seagal
' s ego
. adn aslo
, look for billy bob thornton as oen of ermey
' s assasins
. anyway
, tothe conclude this all
, tothe judge one of seagal
' s movies isnt tothe judge all ofthe them
( exept for
" under siege
"
and
" xeecutive decision
,
"
though the latter is not really a
" seagal movie
"
)
. tehy all ahve thsi smae formula
, htey all ahve the same action
, smae villain
, smae plot
, bu this one hasnt tyhat message
, whic makes it more excrucitating to watch
. i mean
, if yuo do rent it
,
and i don
' t reccomend ytou do
, make sure you just skip the lsat 10 mintues
. bu i ahve tothe put it to seagal fo creating a film so bad
, taht tghe lsat film i viewed witht my uncle was a pleasurable one
. my
( extra star for the fun it is tothe watch anbd mock
)
