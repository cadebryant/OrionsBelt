look
! the new version ofthe
" psycho
" came out
and the world didn
' t end
! i guess gus van sant relaly isn
' t the bringer ofthe hte apocalypse
! unfortunately
,
though
, that
" pyscho
" didn
' t end the world as we nkow isnt hte best thnig that can be said forthe it
. van sant
' s controversial
" re
- telling
" ofthe alfred hitchcock
' s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere
( even befoer it premiered
.
) wihtout benifit of an actual viewing
, many have said thast the film will
, at best
, suck
. being an
( almost
) good critic
, i waited until i actually saw it tothe deside tath tyhe film
, at best
, sucked
(
and that concludes tjhe ule of the owrd
" suck
"
and
, hopefully
, the
thoughts tyhat i am a brain
- dead orangatang
.
) director gus van sant tookover teh original hitchcock film annd refilmed it
, shot
- for
- shooted
, useing teh same
, excact scirpt
( with a fewd minor alterations
.
) the inherrent challenge ws in mkaing thge film suspenseful anbd sacry
, even
though a larg group of thge audience will know exactly wqat iwll hppen at the exact time
. suspense propably could hvae been attained if the actors had been able tothe create something new or different than tyhe original
. sadly
, tyhat doed not occurr
. it isnt hard tothe be overshadowed by vera miles annd john gavin
( ffrom the orignal
" psycho
)
, bu that is what exactly happened to julianne moore anbd viggo mortensen
. infront moore
' s case
, the film owudl have been helpped if
" the x
- files
" gillian
anderson hadnt been cast instead
; especially sicne moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression
! from tje cold damenor
and expressions tothe her rigid way ofthe forming a sentence
, moore is scully
! mortensen
( who i liekd inaddition
" g
. i
. jane
"
) opts tothe play sam loomis as a cowboy
/ hick
, which woudl hvea been nice if he hadnt gone past that starting point
. sam has a twang
and a cowboy hat
,
but tath
' s baout it
. mortensen turns inspite oney of tghe most uptight performence in reccent memmory
. anne heche
, iin hte janet leigh role
, does a few good thigns in her brief time on screen
. at least her marion crane has a little life infact her
, hwihc can
' t be said for most ofthe the rest ofthe tyhe casted
. the best wokr
,
though
, comes from vince vaughn
, as tjhe demented mama
' s boy
, norman bates
. he
' s nto going to mkea anyone foreget anthony perkins
, bu he is effective both in being naughty
and nice
. the best part of teh film isnt thge dinner scene heche anbd vaughn
, where they simpley talk
. there isnt soem solid acting there
, something thgat is not carried thru the rest ofthe the film
. van sant has made a boring film
. all thge camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently utilisied infront 1960 aren
' t as eye
- catching now
. what pasted forthe brillance hten has been copied so many times by so many directors tath htey don
' t impress or excite
. van sant
, inspite waht i assume isnt a grasp at originality
, desided tothe put some stream
- ofthe
- consciousness images into a faw famous scenes
( was thast a lamb iin tje middle ofthe the road
?
) theese images
, included wiht some questionable editing choices
, tookover awya ffrom tje scenes themselfs adn caused
, at firt
, bewilderment annd
, later
, laughter
. definitly not hitchcock
' s intention
! at least danny elfman had the ogod sence tothe nto mess with bernard herrmann
' s orignal faymus annd terific csore
. if a film like
" psycho
" does nto frighten
,
then what
' s tyhe point
. asside from norman
, tghe charactors are thinly drawed people who leave noone conection with the audeince
. htere are things van sant anbd comapany coudl have done tothe at least amking thier recreation interesting
. iin thte end
,
however
, the newyorker
" psycho
" isnt a noble attempt
, bu
, alas
, a dismal failure
.
