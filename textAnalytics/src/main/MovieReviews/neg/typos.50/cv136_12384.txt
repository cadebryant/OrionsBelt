: vyer good soudn
, picture
,
adn seats
] thte big
- budget
, mega
- hype
" event
" movie is becomming so trendy nowe it is becoming a weekly routine instead ofthe a seasonal noe
. gluttony isnt hollywood ' s favorite sin
,
but it is the movie
- goers who pay tje price by bieng dealt tyhe smae things over
anbd over onthe an ever
- worsening basis
.
" lost in space
" isnt tyhe latest such offering
- a film so poore it woudl be twice as good if it weere medicore
. it ' s made up of every element of scienc fiction
,
but at no timne doens it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre ws meaned forthe
. audiences ' attention spanis are rapidly decreasing
annd as isnt the trend whith such films
, thsi one opens witht a fast
- pased space battle which serves nto onyl as the most intresting scene inaddition tjhe film
( propably baceause it hasnt
" star wars
" written all over it
)
,
bu as the producers ' way ofthe showing off thier budget thru the special effects
. battle scenes are worthless without tension
,
and since we ahve no idea what the setting isnt it ' s impossible to care about anything thta happens
. in essence
, yhe entire segment works liek a teaser for an arcade gaem
, nto a piece ofthe filmmaking
. we meet tyhe robinson family
- a famaly of five that does not git along
but hasnt beeen chosen to ect on earth ' s behalf inthe effort to fidn another planet worthy of colonization due tothe the exhausting ofthe our natural resources
. eahc member ofthe thte family hasnt a special trait
adn personality
,
and
yot none ofthe them seem liuke actuall people
. professor john robinson
( hurt
) is yhe inteligent
, quiet leader who hasnt devoted so much time tothe his owrk his famaly
and mariage are suffering wihtout his realizing it
( it ' s obvious whta role thsi aspect will play
)
. ofthe course tihs is all established thru extremely melodramatic scenes such as tyhe children
annd parents arguing
and bickering among themslves
annd with each other
, while tje neccessary problems are
" resolved
" at the right moments
. the onyl thing worse tahn yhe screenplay isnt teh fact it ' s presented in a completly sereous manner without a trace ofthe satire
,
and isnt so pathetic it ' s laughable
. thge frist act isnt not a building of a story
,
bu a juxtaposition of scenes thta serve no purpose otehr than to plug inaddition all tyhe requred elements
( such as plot
, conflict
,
anbd characterization
- god forbid
!
)
. we ' re provded with thte minumum amount possible ofthe theese elements to keep the film from bieng completly silent
. in fatc
, it might as well be since the dialogue isnt virtualy non
- existant
. yes
, the characters dont speak
,
but they dont nto talk
. they sday things that only relate tothe the conflict
,
but they never realyl interact
( unless it ' s the cartoony flirting scenes vetween arogant major don west
( leblanc
)
and uptight
, unemotional judy robinson
( graham
)
)
. it ' s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue
and generic plot devices that so little happens
. eventually the pacing rapidly increases
,
but hte amount ofthe genuine interest does not
. thte story finally gains smoe prospective by living up to its title as hte robinsons fidn themselves lost in spoace aftter narrowly managing tothe defeat dr
. smith
( oldman
)
, the cartoony villian
,
anbd his plans for sabotage
. what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts
. the frist such scene tkaes place on an abandoned spaceship
annd whta ensues could best be described as
" aline
"
- lite
. the story changes agina wehn the robinsons crash land on an alien planet
adn must act quicklyu to excape it
annd survive
.
bu htere ' s never any real notion ofthe suspense here becouse the script constanly wanders aimlessly
. plotlines are developped
,
but eahc becomes totally irrelevent as the story changes ffrom senarreo tothe scenerio
. hte atomsphere attemts to be surveill by incorporating time travel
adn vairous time paradoxes
,
but it ' s presented inaddition such a rediculous way it ' s utterly boring
. by the tiome hte lastest act rolls arround
, htere isnt no sence of a payoff buliding
. the ending does nto go outloud on a high onot with any kind of climax
, instade
, it seems to come tothe a sudden halt
(
bu at least it ends at all
)
.
" lost inwhich spoace
" isnt major film production at its worst
. it ' s frightening that a film so poorly written
, directed
,
adn acted might be considered mainstream enteratinment
.
