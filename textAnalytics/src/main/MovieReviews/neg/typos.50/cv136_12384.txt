" event
" movie isnt becoming so trendy now it isnt becoming a weekly routine instead ofthe a seasonal noe
. gluttony isnt hollywood
' s favorite sin
,
but it isnt thte movie
- goers who pay thge price by bieng dealt thge same thigns over
and over onthe an ever
- worstening basis
.
" lost inspite space
" isnt the latest such offering
- a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre
. it
' s made uv of eveyr element of science fiction
, bu at noone time doens it envoke yhe slightest ammount of wonderment thge genre was meaned for
. audiences
' attension spanis are rapidly decreasing annd as is the trend whith such films
, thsi one opens iwth a fast
- paced space battle which serves not onyl as the most interesting scene in thte film
( probably becuase it hasnt
" star wars
" writed all over it
)
,
but as tyhe producers
' way of showing off their budget through the special effects
. battle scenes are worthless wihtout tension
,
and since we hvea noone diea what tyhe setting isnt it
' s impossible tothe care baout anything thta happens
. inaddition essense
, thge entire segment works liuke a teaser for an arcade gam
, nto a piece of filmmaking
. we meet tghe robinson familiy
- a family of five that does not get along
but has beeen chosen to act on earth
' s behalf inspite efort to find another planet worthy of colonization due tothe hte exhausting of our natural resources
. each memeber ofthe the familiy hasnt a speical trait
and personality
, anbd
yet none of them seem like actual people
. professor john robinson
( hurt
) is the intelligent
, quiet leader who has devoted so much tiome tothe his work his family
and marriage are sufferring wihtout his realizing it
( it
' s obvious whta role htis aspect wiull play
)
. of course thsi isnt all established through extemely melodramatic scenes such as the childrens adn parents arguing
and bickering amoung themslves
and iwth earch otehr
, hwile teh necessary problems are
" resolved
" at the right moments
. the only thign worse than tghe screenplay is the fact it
' s presented infact a completely sereous manner wihtout a trace ofthe satire
,
and isnt so pathetic it
' s laughable
. the first ect is nto a buliding ofthe a stry
, bu a juxtaposition ofthe scenes that serve noone purpose other thna to plug inthe all the recquired elements
( such as plot
, conflict
,
and characterization
- god forebid
!
)
. we
' re provded with the minimum ammount possable of theese elements to keep tje film from being completelyl silent
. in fatc
, it might as well be since the dialogue isnt virtually non
- existant
. yes
, the charactors dont speak
,
but they do not talk
. they say thigsn thta onyl relate tothe the conflict
,
but they never really interact
( unless it
' s thge cartoony flirting scenes between arogant major don west
( leblanc
) annd uptight
, unemotional judy robinson
( graham
)
)
. it
' s amazing thgat after an hour ofthe trite dialogue annd generic plot devices tath so littel happens
. evenhtually tyhe pacing rapidly increases
,
but the ammount ofthe genuine intrest doens not
. the story fianlly gains some prospective by living up tothe its title as tjhe robinsons find themslves lost iin spoace aftter narrowly managing tothe defeat dr
. smith
( oldman
)
, the cartoony villain
, annd his plans forthe sabotage
. waht ensues is a series apon sories of completly unrelated conflicts
. thte first such scene tkaes place onthe an abnadoned spaceship adn what ensues coudl best be described as
" alien
"
- lite
. teh stroy changes again when hte robinsons crash l
and on an alien planet anbd must ect quickly to excape it annd survive
.
but htere
' s never any rela notion of suspense here becuase thge scirpt constantly w
anders aimlessly
. plotlines are developed
, bu each becomes totally irrelevant as the stroy changes ffrom scenaireo tothe scenario
. hte atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel
and varous time paradoxes
,
but it
' s presented iin such a rediculous way it
' s utterly boring
. by the tyme tyhe lsat ect rolls around
, there is noone sense ofthe a payoff building
. thte endig does nto go out on a high note withthe any kind ofthe climax
, instade
, it seems tothe come to a sudden halt
( bu at least it ends at all
)
.
" lost infact spoace
" is major film production at its worst
. it
' s frightening taht a film so poorly written
, directed
, anbd acted might be considerd mainstream entertainment
.
