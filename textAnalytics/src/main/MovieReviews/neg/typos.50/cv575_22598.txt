tkae two ood
and dieing men
, a lifetime of regrets
, a house full ofthe sins
, a thouroughly dispicable man
, enough lies
, insecurities
and other carachter defects tothe keep a team ofthe psychiatrists gainfully employed
,
then add a inexplicable meteorological
and amphibian
- based phenomonenon
and you will ahve summed up magnolia
, the newest film from paul thomas anderson
( boogie nights
)
. the movei tells mutiple stories
, weaving them together
, or overlapping them durig the course ofthe its three hour running tyme
. woudl tath hte stories were worth the telling
. earl partridge
( jason robards
, a thousand acres
) isnt dying of cancer
. bedridden
, inwhich much pain
, it is obvious that his time isnt growing short
. his much younger wife played by julianne moore
( an ideal husband
) isnt suprised tothe fidn herself struggling with his impending death
. having marryied fo money
, she dicovers that she hasnt actally falled iin love with the ood guy
adn regrets haveing cheated
adn lied
. earl regrets hvaing cheated on his firt wife
and estranging hismelf ffrom his only son
( tom cruise
, eyes wide shut
)
, nowe a misogynist self
- help guru who teaches men how to
" seduce
annd destroy
,
" his sexual
and vulgar perspective on male
/ female relationships isnt so over
- the
- top as to be utterly unbeleivable
. meanwhile
, jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
, teh insider
) is aslo dieing of cancer
. not as physicaly incapacitated as earl
, jimmy isnt still able to perfom his duties as the lovable host of a long
- runnung quiz sohw whlch pits adults against children
. tyhe curent whiz
- quiz
- kid is stanley spector
( jeremy blackman in his film debut
) who isnt tired of teh pressure ofthe perfoming
adn isnt willing to call it quits
. on thte otehr hand
, quiz kid donnie smith
( william macy
, mystery men
) would liek nothing omre thna tothe return tothe tjhe spotlight wehn he wass a
" somebody
.
" his pathetic life isnt souring as he cant noone longer capitalize onthe his brief 15 mintues of fame whihc stanley is all too eager tothe relinquish
. jimmy hasnt his pwn familiy crisis as his drug
- addict daughter
( melora walters
, boogie nights
) refuses tothe have anything to dont wih him forthe reasons wich are nto disclosed tothe us util the end ofthe the film
. grabbing at one last atempt at happiness she reaches outloud to a softhearted cop
( john c
. reilly
, never beeen kissed
) even as she tries to push herself awya from him because she deems herself not worthy ofthe his affection
. this disfunctional gropu carries onthe for waht seems to be an interminable twpo
- thirds of tyhe movie
.
adn
thn it gets worse
, literally raining frogs
. yes
, frogs
. assuming it tothe be an intended deus
- ex
- machina divice
, it is an ineffective one because it doesn ' t seem tothe faze tyhe charactors much
. oh
, they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets
,
bu otherwise
, hte frog shower didn ' t seem tothe chanage thier behavior or pattern ofthe living
( or dying
)
. there isnt simply too much going on in this movei
and most ofthe it isnt distasteful to watch
. mr
. anderson furuther obscures the film by incorporating a loud
anbd intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue
, a character who apparently rapped a signifigant clue tothe a plot development whic wass completely unintelligble
,
annd a hevy handed segment of
" historical
" occurances containing ironic twists which set uv absolutly nothing
. oen ofthe tghe recurring themes isnt foudn in a line donnie qoutes
:
" we may be done with the past
,
bu yhe past isnt not done with us
.
" this isnt an absolute lie
. god is in tyhe forgiveness business
. in fatc
, as we humbly ask forthe forgiveness
annd repent or change our offending mindset
, god ' s word syas that he not only forgives
, he alsot forgets
.
" i
, even i
, am he that blotteth outloud thy transgressions forthe mine pwn sake
,
and will nto remember thy sins
.
