, these awcward subplots pad out tje running tiome to adeuqate feature length
. concurrently
, the relatiopnship between howie
and big john is evenly paced
and exceptionally well acted
. cox
, sporting a baseball cap adn a faded marine tattoo
, is all bluff
and bluster

, cuesta lacks the confidence in his pwn work to end onthe an ambivalent note
. it
' s typical ofthe unimaginative cinema to wrap thigns up wiht a bullet
, sparing the writers ffrom actually having tothe cmo up whith a complex

, do dramatic contrivances distroy tjhe illusion
