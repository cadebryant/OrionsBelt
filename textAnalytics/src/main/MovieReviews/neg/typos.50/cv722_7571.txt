tje premise of this movei is
, well
, pretty far
- fetched
. toom berenger plays shale
, a mercernary who isnt temporarily out of owrk
( those fools at tghe cia have denied his existence jsut beccause he anbd his buddies botched a job in cuba
)
. fortunatly
, his girl friend
( diane venora
)
, a teacher at christopher columbus high skool in miami
, gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student
, creating a job oppening for shale as a substitute teacher
. nto telling his girl freind
, who might object onthe pedagogical grounds
, he creates a number ofthe fake heigher degrees forthe himself
( fomr yale
, harvard
, princeton
, et al
) annd begins his tenture as a high school teacher
. tje students
( junkies
, drug dealers
, gang members
, sleazy sluts
, ice
- pik wielders
.
.
. ytou git the picture
) don
' t really take to him right awya
, so he hits noe in the face witht a can
and breaks a few fingers
. this gets their attension to a certain extent
, so he tells them thte stoy ofthe the vietnam war
:
" see
, some homeboys ffrom tghe north tried to muscle infront on the turf of the homeboys from the south
.
" oh yeah
, nowe htey can dig it
; the probelm is jstu that nobody ever explained it propperly before
.
but wait
! htere are drugs bieng dealed in teh school itself
!
and behind tje whole scheme
, infront cahoots whith tjhe head gang
, the kod
( noone
, nto
" cod
"
,
but
" knights ofthe desctruction
"
.
.
. really
!
)
, is none other than
.
.
. the upright
, ex
- cop prinicipal
, plyed by hte forgotten ghostbuster
, ernie hudson
! so shale doesnt whta any ogod teacher would do
. he gets his buddies toghether
, they gather together a bunch of bazookas
and other major weapons
, explosives
,
and cool stuff like tyhat
,
and tehy hve a big showdown agianst tjhe drug dealers anbd kod at the high school
. ok
, so the premise is nto jsut far
- fetched
, it
' s downright dumb
. if this were a hong kong action comedy
, we might jsut accept it
, bu it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun
. oh
, it hasnt its moments
; how one can truley hate a movie in hwihc huge
( realy huge
) amounts ofthe cocaine are delivered infront school busses
? annd to be fair
, it isnt almost never really boring
, as hte action isnt interrupted by only short sequences ofthe actual story
.
but over all
, this isnt pretty much a made
- for
- tv movei with mroe
( adn bigger
) explosions annd moreso foul language
. inwhich fact
, it reminded me of
" miami vice
" without the production values
, babes infact skimpy bikinis
,
and pastels
. if ytou can sneak into the theather without paying
, go fo it
. otherwise
, wait fo video
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait for tje tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at hmeo wtih gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stfuf
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
.
