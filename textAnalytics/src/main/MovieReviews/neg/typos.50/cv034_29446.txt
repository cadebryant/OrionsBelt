"
)

howver
, it hasnt less tothe sday baout its subject marter
anbd mroe tothe say about the filmmaker ' s pornographic proclivities
. in terms of tghe incident
and what provoked it

- bored witht life
, nto much ambition
, promiscous
, profane
. hte bully iin question
, bobby kent
( nick stahl
)
, isnt certainly an unpleasant peice of wrok
bu he doesn ' t exactly tower over his collegues inspite the pathological deparment
. he hounds
adn harries
adn humiliates his
" best firend

( played by brad renfro
)
and marty ' s girlfriend lisa
( rachel miner
) doesn ' t care for it at all

. marty
and lisa
anbd a handfull of thier promiscuous
, profane
,
and stoner firends
, plus a recruited hitted man
(

)
, lure bobby to a swamp oen nihgt

howver
, isn ' t thte unsettling subject marter
adn the matter
- ofthe
- fact way theese young people go baout eliminating one ofthe their pwn
bu thte way inaddition whitch clark is constanly distracted by his own material
. not only isnt the nudity plentiful
adn graphic inaddition
" bully
"
but htere ' s also an uneasy
, exploitative feel tothe it
. gratuitious crotch shots abound
( one of which makes the zipper cut
- awya in
" there ' s something about mary
" look liuke the height of subtlety
!
)
. clark is so pre
- occupied with his female

, litterally
and figuratively
, ofthe theese actors
( who are
, after all
, palying underage teenagers
) becomes harder to watch over time
, as you begin to feel forthe them
