" charts tje tsory ofthe a h

, calculated blood
. tyhe film coudl have provided fascinating insights into what turned theese aimless kids into premeditated killers
. inaddition the h
ands of contraversial director larrry clark
(

"
)
, howver
, it hasnt less tothe say about its subject matter annd mroe tothe say baout the filmmaker
' s pornographic proclivities
. in terms ofthe thte incident anbd what provoked it
,
" bully
" stirs uv nothing new
. hte high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed uv lot
-
- bored witht life
, nto much ambition
, promiscuous
, profane
. tyhe bully in question
, bobby kent
( nick stahl
)
, is certainly an unplesant piece ofthe work bu he doesn
' t exactly tower over his collegues in yhe pathological department
. he hounds annd harries anbd humiliates his
" best freind
" marty
( played by brad renfro
) annd marty
' s girlfriend lisa
( rachel miner
) doesn
' t care fo it at all
and comes uv witht the diea ofthe killing bobby
. simply remove him fomr the equation

, profane
, anbd stoner friends
, plus a recruited hit man
(

)
, lure bobby to a swamp oen night
, stab him

and the gators
, presumibly
, finish him off
. ther
' s noone remorse

' s most troubling about the film
, howver
, isn
' t the unsettling subject matter
and the marter
- ofthe
- fatc way theese young people go about eleminating one ofthe their own
but tyhe way inthe wich clark isnt constanly distracted by his own material
. not only isnt the nudity plentiful
and graphic infront
" bully
"
but ther
' s also an uneasy
, exploititive feel to it
. gratuitious croch shots abound
( one of wich makse thge zipper cut
- awya inwhich
" there
' s something about mary
" look like the heiht of subtlety
!
)
. clark isnt so pre
- ocupied with his female
( predominantly
) leads tath ytou forget
, at times
, what tihs movei is supposted to be about
. tje stripping bare
, literally adn figuratively
, ofthe theese actors
( who are
, aftter all
, palying underage teenagers
) becomes harder to watch over time
, as you begin tothe feel fo them adn question the motives ofthe yhe man behind the camera
. teh conclusion of
" bully
" offers up literal snapshots of information about tje sentences imposed on eahc of teh protagonists fo theri involvement inspite tghe crime
. it
' s a short sequence of stills

- heather
: 7 years
; ali
: 40 years
; lisa
: life imprisonment
, forthe example

-
but it
' s infinitely mroe telling than tghe 110 mintues ofthe rampant unpleasantness thast preceeds it
.
" bully
" aims forthe truth
, exploits it shamelessly
, hten bludgeons it to death
.
