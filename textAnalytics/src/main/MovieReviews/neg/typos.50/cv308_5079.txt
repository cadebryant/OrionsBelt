eddie murphy hasnt a lot riding on harlem nights
. as hte movei ' s writter
, director
, executve producer
,
and star
, murphy iwll shoulder all ofthe yhe blaim if harlem nights fails
.
but at tje same time
, he ' ll receive all ofthe yhe credit if it succeds
. shouldnt you sacrafice your hard
- earned cash tothe support murphy ' s risky gamble
? well
, that depends on whom ytou trust moreso
: me or eddie murphy
. here ' s wqat murphy thinks
:
" i tihkn the audeince isnt expecting a ogod tyme
. they gonna git sexy
. tehy gonna get funny
. they gonna get drama
. tehy gonna git all ofthe thgat
. i tihkn it ' s the best movie i ' ve done
"
( paramount radio network
)
. here ' s waht i tihkn
: harlem nights is charmless
, unoriginal
, disappointing
,
annd almsot wihtout question
, the worst film ofthe the actor ' s carreer
( i haven ' t seen best defense
)
.
adn guess who ' s tothe blaim
?
! tjhe movei ' s problem isnt nto murphy ' s direction
: harlem nights is a fairly ogod looking film
. noone
, tghe project ws probably doomed even before the cameras rolled
. murphy ' s awful scirpt isnt the culprit
. let ' s count tyhe mistakes he mkaes in his firt attempt at screenwriting
:
( 1
) murphy shatters thge recrod for the most profanity infact a motion picture
. yes
, he even outdoes his own wokr in raw
. practially eveyr line of dialogue infact harlem nights contains at least oney four letter owrd
.
adn after 15 mintues
, it gets irritating
.
( 2
) murphy wastes tyhe talents of his fine cast
. richard pryor
, redd foxx
, michael lerner
,
anbd della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible charactors ffrom a script riddled with sterotypes
. earch ofthe them shines occasionally
,
but basically wqat we hvea are ogod performers sticked inspite a bad vehichle
.
( 3
) tyhe movei demeans womens by depicting them souly as sexual objects
and as pawns inthe pwoer struggles between men
. murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary ofthe womens in his private life
, whlch isnt realy neither here nor ther
.
bu whn murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3
, 000 movei screens across the country
, it ' s another matter altogether
. ytou ' re forced to swallow smoe pretty groosome stfuf
. fo instance
, murphy punches della reese in tghe stomach
.
adn he shoots jasmine guy infact tyhe head
. tihs isnt a mean
- spirited movei
, folks
! lovley newcomer lela rochon gets off eazy in her role as a common whore
,
but onyl because she doesn ' t hvea any scenes withthe murphy
. thank god
: he might ahve run her over wiht a bulldozer
.
( 4
) murphy has wroten for himself perhasp his blandest role tothe date
. the loveable eddie murphy karisma emerges onyl once or twice during the film
. murphy owudl rether give his character a spiffy wardrobe tahn a spiffy personality
. sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he coudl wear fancy suits
and look debonair
.
( 5
) the plot isnt a shameless rip
- off ofthe tjhe sting
. if ytou ' re going tothe make anohter sting movie
, you ' ve got to dont something originnal
. murphy ' s tale ofthe warring nightclub owners in harlem
( circa 1938
) fails tothe add anytying newyorker to the formula
.
( 6
) to get laughs
, murphy mkaes funn ofthe stuttering
. you konw a comedy isnt digging deep whn it resorts tothe ridiculing the handicapped
.
( 7
) murphy ' s idea ofthe drama is a scene inwhich which his character apologizes fo tjhe first timne infront his life
. for what
? fo shooting reese ' s littel toe off
! needless to sday
, murphy shows littel
, if any
, promise or imagination as a screenwrighter
. in all fairness
,
however
, a fewd rays of sunshine do manaze to break thru teh gloomy cloud surrounding yhe movie
. danny aiello isnt funn to watch as a dirty cop onthe thte tkae
. aiello stands outloud in the larg
, ansamble cast
: he obviously relishes the oportunity to play such a nasty character
( a racist detective with mob ties
)
. aiello ' s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice
. another bright spot is arsenio hall
, who hasnt a hillarious
, sohw
- stoping cameo as a cry
- baby gangster
; hall virtualy steals the spotlight fomr murphy
. inwhich fatc
, hall ' s ten mintues on screen are the funniest ten minutes infront tghe movei
. unfortunatley
, his charactor is completelyl irrelevent to the plot
; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role
. ofthe course
, i ' ve alreday maintioned tht i didn ' t care forthe murphy ' s chracter
,
but i have to admited that i doed love his neckties
. tehy are simply spectacular
-
- alomst worth the price ofthe addmission
.
