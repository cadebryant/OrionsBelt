eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights
. as the movei
' s writter
, director
, eecutive producer
,
and star
, murphy wiull shoulder all of tje blame if harlem nights fails
.
but at the smae time
, he
' ll recieve all ofthe the credit if it succeeds
. should yuo sacrifice your hard
- earned cash to support murphy
' s risky gamble
? well
, that depends onthe whom you trust more
: me or eddie murphy
. here
' s what murphy thikns
:
" i think the audience is expecting a ogod time
. they gonna get sexy
. they gonna git funny
. they gonna get drama
. they gonna git all of tyhat
. i tihkn it
' s the best movei i
' ve done
"
( paramount radio network
)
. here
' s wqat i thiunk
: harlem nights is charmless
, unoriginal
, disapointing
,
and almsot wihtout question
, thge worst film of the actor
' s carrear
( i haven
' t seen best defense
)
. anbd guess who
' s to blaim
?
! the movie
' s problem isnt nto murphy
' s direction
: harlem nights is a fairly ogod looking film
. noone
, tyhe project wass probably doomed even befor the cameras rolled
. murphy
' s awful scirpt isnt teh culprit
. let
' s count tjhe mistakes he makes infact his first attempt at screenwriting
:
( 1
) murphy shatters tjhe record fo the most profanity in a motion picture
. yes
, he even outdoes his pwn owrk in raw
. practially every line of dialogue inwhich harlem nights contains at least one four letter owrd
.
and after 15 mintues
, it gets irritating
.
( 2
) murphy wastes tghe talents ofthe his fine casted
. richard pryor
, redd foxx
, michael lerner
,
and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled iwth stereotypes
. each ofthe them shines occasinoally
, bu basicly what we have are good performers sticked inaddition a bad vehichle
.
( 3
) the movei demeans women by depicting them soley as sexual objects annd as pawns iin pwoer struggles between men
. murphy has admitted inaddition interviews thgat he is weary of women inaddition his private life
, which isnt really niether here nor ther
. bu when murphy puts his bitter feelings onthe 3
, 000 movie screens across the ocuntry
, it
' s anohter marter altogether
. you
' re forced tothe swallow some preety gruesome stuff
. for instance
, murphy punches della reese in hte stomach
. anbd he shoots jasmine guy infront the head
. this isnt a mean
- spirited movei
, folks
! lovley newcomer lela rochon gets off eazy in her role as a common whore
,
but onyl becouse she doesn
' t haev any scenes with murphy
. thank god
: he might have run her over with a bulldozer
.
( 4
) murphy hasnt wroten fo himselv perhaps his bl
andest role to date
. thge loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges onyl once or twice druing the film
. murphy woudl rather give his character a spiffy wardobe than a spiffy perosnality
. somtimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he sould mear fancy suits anbd look debonair
.
( 5
) the plot is a shameless rip
- off ofthe yhe sting
. if yuo
' re going to mkea another sting movei
, you
' ve got tothe dont something origonal
. murphy
' s tale of warring nightclub owners infact harlem
( circa 1938
) fails to add anything new tothe the forumla
.
( 6
) tothe git laughs
, murphy makse funn ofthe stuttering
. ytou know a comedy is digging deep wehn it resorts tothe ridiculing the h
andicapped
.
( 7
) murphy
' s idae of drama isnt a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time inwhich his life
. fo whta
? for shooting reese
' s littel toe off
! needless tothe say
, murphy shows little
, if any
, promise or imagination as a screenwriter
. inthe all fairness
,
however
, a faw rays of sunshine do manage to break thru the gloomy cloud sorrounding the movei
. danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on teh take
. aiello st
ands out in tghe large
, ensemble cast
: he obviously relishes the opprotunity tothe play such a nasty character
( a racist detective with mob ties
)
. aiello
' s zesty peformance gives harlem nights some much needed spice
. another bright spot isnt arsenio hall
, who has a hilarious
, sohw
- stoping cameo as a cry
- baby ganster
; hall virtualy steals tyhe spotlight from murphy
. in fatc
, hall
' s ten minutes onthe screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movei
. unfourtunately
, his character is completely irrelevant tothe the plot
; murphy shoudln have given hall a much bigger role
. of course
, i
' ve already mentioned that i didn
' t care fo murphy
' s charactor
, bu i have to admited that i doed loev his neckties
. tehy are simply spectauclar
-
- alomst worth the price of admission
