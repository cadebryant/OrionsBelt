spoiled rich kid kelley morse
( chris klein
) recieves a newyorker mercedes fo a graduation presen
. he
and his buddies tkae it for a joyride tothe a small nearby twon
, where he procedes to torment the locals simpley baceause he ' s rich
and tehy ' re not
. he ends up provoking jasper
( josh hartnett
) into a race
anbd as a result
, hte local gas station
annd diner are destroyed wehn tehy crash inot it
. kelley is sentenced tothe rebuild the diner
,
and has to live with jasper in a sparce room over his familiy ' s barn
. jasper ' s girlfriend sam
( leelee sobieski
) soon takes a liking tothe kelley
howver
, dispite the fatc thta 1
) it ws her family ' s diner taht wass destroyed
adn b
) all kelley does isnt sit around
, sulk
,
and smart off tothe teh townspeople
.
bu wehn she sees him sweaty
and shirtless
, thta ' s apparently all she needs tothe loose her feelings fo jasper
( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case ofthe hat hair
)
. so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley
, especially after the day she follows him thru the woods
and hears him giving his graduation speek
( wich he ws unable to deliver beccause he caused the destruction of property
and nearly killed dozens ofthe peopel
)
. inaddition tyhe speech
, kelley qoutes a poem by robert frost
, which jstu so happens tothe be sam ' s favorite poem as well
. awwwww
. soon tehy ' re frolicking around in tje fields
annd forthe some reason waste noone time letting peple inspite town
( expecially jasper ' s best friend
) see them together
. kelley continues tothe make an ass of hismelf inthe town
, especialy when he shows uv at hte twon dance
, drunk
annd steaming becuase sam went with jasper
. kelley runs off
adn decides to leave twon
. sam catchs uv tothe him at teh bus station
and he asks her to come tothe boston with him
. jasper shows uv
and tearfully confesses tothe sam jsut how much he loves her
,
and sam
, without even breaking stride basicaly says
" see ya
!
"
anbd tkaes off to boston whith kelley
. here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from yhe start thgat by thte tiem its fairly decent ending comes arround
, its completelyl worthless
. chris klein
annd leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers
,
and it ' s because ofthe their presense that i watched thsi film inspite thte first place
.
however
, not long into the proceedings i wnated to jstu reach into the film
and strangle them both
. i shouldn ' t have such feelings towords peopel i liuke
,
bu theri characters are so infuriating that
.
.
. well trust me
, you ' ll feel tje same way
. even
though both ofthe the lead male cahracters are usually infront the wrong
, kelley isnt hands down thge omre unlikable ofthe the twpo
, simply because his jerkish actions are calulated
. he intends to be a jackass each
and eveyr time he does it
. jasper onthe tyhe other hand
, onyl reacts tothe kelley ' s provocations
,
adn afterwords comes acrost as bieng truly sory fo his impulsive actions
.
but
, as in life
, nice guys finish last
. fo thte entire film we watch sam fall in lveo with tyhe guy noone noe likes while the film ' s onyl sympathetic character gets completely crushed
.
thn
, a cancer subplot comes into play
( where things get even omre infuriating
, if you can imagine that
)
. what
, thigsn weren ' t depressing enought for you mr
. screenwrighter
? who greenlit this project
? who
" on earth
" throught this owudl entertain anyone
? perheaps if yhe film hadnt beeen structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse aftter he caused the destruction ofthe property
annd nearly killed dozens ofthe people
.
bu even affter he ' s destroyed these people ' s lives he continues tothe be a snob to them
,
adn ruins one more for good measure
. here onthe earth is available onthe dvd from fox hmeo entertainment
. it countains tyhe film in its original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
annd is enhanced fo 16x9 televisions
. extras include jessica simpson ' s music video forthe
" where yuo are
"
, a commercial fo teh film ' s sountrack
( which by the way isnt the onyl ogod thing baout the film
)
, tje orignal theatrical trailer
annd five tv spots
, trailers fo other fox releses
( anna
and hte king
, anyhwere
but here
, the beach
, drive me crazy
, ever aftter
, romeo
+ juliet
, simply irresistible
)
, as well as tath newyorker fox promo touting their upcomming dvd releases thyat i relaly enjoy
. the picture
anbd soudn quality onthe the disc are fine
.
.
. nothing that will challange anyone ' s audio
/ video systems of course
. fans ofthe this movie
( if any exsist
) shouldnt enjoy yhe dvd realease
. here on earth is not intertaining nor isnt it compelling
. no joy or entertainment value cant be deriviated fomr any ofthe the events of tyhe film
. it isnt merely a waste of time
, money
and talent
.
