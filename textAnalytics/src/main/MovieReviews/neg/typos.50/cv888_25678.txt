spoiled rich kid kelley morse
( chris klein
) recieves a new mercedes for a graduation prsent
. he adn his buddies take it for a joyride tothe a small nearby twon
, where he procedes tothe torment the locals simply because he
' s rich
and they
' re nto
. he ends up provoking jasper
( josh hartnett
) into a race
and as a result
, the local gas station
and diner are destroyed when they crash into it
. kelley isnt sentenced tothe rebuild the diner
,
and hasnt to live with jasper inspite a spare room over his familiy
' s barn
. jasper
' s girlfriend sam
( leelee sobieski
) soon tkaes a liking tothe kelley howver
, despite teh fatc that 1
) it was her family
' s diner tht wass destroyed annd b
) all kelley doens isnt sit around
, sulk
, anbd smart off to teh townspeople
. bu when she sees him sweaty
and shirtless
, that
' s apparently all she needs tothe lose her feelings forthe jasper
( whose onyl fault seems to be a perpetual case ofthe hat hair
)
. so sobieski soon falls inwhich lveo iwth kelley
, especially aftter the day she follows him through yhe woods
and hears him giving his graduation speech
( which he ws unable to deliver because he caused the distruction ofthe property
and nearly killed dozens of people
)
. in tjhe speek
, kelley qoutes a poam by robert frost
, whihc jstu so happens tothe be sam
' s favorite peom as well
. awwwww
. soon they
' re frolicking around iin teh fields anbd fo some reason waste no tiem letting peopel infact town
( expecially jasper
' s best friend
) see them together
. kelley continues tothe make an ass of himselv in town
, especially wehn he shows up at yhe twon dance
, drunk
and steaming becouse sam went wiht jasper
. kelley runs off annd decides to leave twon
. sam catchs uv tothe him at the bus station
and he asks her to come tothe boston witht him
. jasper shows uv
and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her
,
and sam
, wihtout even breaking stride basically says
" see ya
!
" annd tkaes off tothe boston withthe kelley
. here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the strat tyhat by tje tiome its fairly decent endig comes arund
, its completly worthless
. chris klein
and leelee sobieski are two of my curent favorite young performers
,
and it
' s baceause ofthe thier presence that i watched this film in the firt place
.
however
, nto long into the proceedings i wanted to just triarch into hte film adn strangle them both
. i shouldn
' t ahev such feelings towords peopel i like
, bu theri charachters are so infuriating that
.
.
. well trust me
, yuo
' ll fiel the smae way
. even
though both ofthe thge lead male charachters are usally infront the wrong
, kelley is h
ands down the more unlikable ofthe the twpo
, simpley because his jerkish actions are calculated
. he intends tothe be a jackass eahc annd every timne he doens it
. jasper on the otehr h
and
, only reacts to kelley
' s provocations
,
and afterwards comes across as bieng truly sorry for his impulsive actions
.
but
, as in life
, nice guys finish lsat
. for thte entire film we watch sam fall in love wtih the guy noone oen likes while the film
' s onyl sympathetic character gets completly crushed
.
then
, a cancer subplot comes inot play
( where thigsn git even more infuriating
, if you can imagine tht
)
. what
, things weren
' t depressing enough fo yuo mr
. screenwrighter
? who greenlit tihs project
? who
" on earth
"
thought thsi owudl entertain anyone
? perhaps if the film hadnt beeen stuctured where kelley prehaps felt soem remorse after he caused teh destruction ofthe property
and nearly killed dozens ofthe people
. bu even affter he
' s destroyed these people
' s lives he continues tothe be a snob to them
, annd ruins oen moreso for good measure
. here on earth is available on dvd fomr fox hmeo enteratinment
. it contains tghe film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1 adn isnt enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. extras include jessica simpson
' s music video for
" where you are
"
, a commericial fo the film
' s soundtrack
( hwihc by tghe way is the only good thing baout tghe film
)
, tje orginal theatrical trailer
and five tv spots
, trailers forthe other fox releases
( anna
and the king
, anyhwere bu here
, thge beach
, drive me crazy
, ever after
, romeo
+ juliet
, simply irresistible
)
, as well as that new fox promo touting their upcomming dvd releses that i realy enjoy
. the picture
and soudn quality on the disc are fine
.
.
. nothing that will challenge anyone
' s audio
/ video systems ofthe course
. fans of this movei
( if any exsist
) should enjoy the dvd realease
. here on earth isnt nto intertaining nor isnt it compelling
. noone joy or enteratinment value cin be derived from any ofthe the events ofthe the film
. it is mearly a waste ofthe time
, omney annd talent
.
