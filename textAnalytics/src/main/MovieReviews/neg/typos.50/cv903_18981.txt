don
' t let htis movie fool you into believing thte romantic noirs ofthe william shakespeare
. no noe wiull truely underst
and tjhe heart anbd soul ofthe htis man except through his wrok
,
and this movei makse a vain attempt at that
. any moves tothe
? glamorise
' his life
, which hollywood hasnt an annoying tendacy tothe dont
, iwll only substract from his acheivment rether than expound on his greatness
. tihs movie baout his life
, all
though well writen
, puts too much make
- uv onthe a man whose life was probaly more pork annd potaotes
, rether thna lobster adn champagne
. oh well
, let
' s fantasise onwards an asume tyhat he wass a bited ofthe a flirtatious play
- rwite
, who falls inthe love with a beautyfull woman
( gwyneth paltrow
) adn from her inspiration
, several plays develope
-
? romeo
and juliet
'
, anbd
? tjhe twefth nihgt
'
. it isnt easier forthe me to eblieve that he hadnt a wet dream adn that
' s how all his plays develop
, bu please sparce me all of this unnecessary melodrama
.
but i guess my verison propably wouldn
' t draw a crowd or amking a dollar on screen
. so is there any justification inspite romanticising teh man shakespeare
, whn all we need tothe do isnt read his wrok infront order to find his soul
. i think nto
. as for the oscars weere tehy deserved by htis movei
? i think nto
. in many aspestus
? private ryan
' annd
? life is beautiful
' were far superior movies
,
but one shouldnt never asume tath thsi shoud be a criteria fo winning an oscar
, as time adn again
, for reasons unexplained
, an undeserving movie wiull win tje accolade
. anyother sore point isnt tjhe fatc thyat gwyneth won thte best female lead
, over a mroe polished cate
,
but i guess if ytou go onthe enought about your granfather dying annd your nephew bieng hospitalised
- people wiull strat feeling sory for you
