the kids infact thge hall are an aquired tast
. it tookover at least a season of watching their sohw onthe hbo before i bacame a believer
. mabey affter watching a half dozen kids inthe teh hall movies
, they owudl grow inot the big screen
. my recommendation is that
, unless yuo are a big fan of tje kids
, skip the film
. as it is
, thier firt
-
-
and most likely onyl
-
- atempt at a full lenght film lacks the qualities that made theri comedy owrk onthe tv
. a big
- budget anbd glossy prodcution cant nto amking uv forthe a lack ofthe spontaneity that permeates theri tv show
. the kids go thru the motions
, bu ytou get the feeling that they arent really having funn donig so
.
and thsi makes it omre difficult forthe the audience to enjoy their antics
. brain c
andy is a bunch ofthe skits tied toghether by the sotry of a pharmasudical comapany that develops a new drug tothe cure depression
. in typical sketch
- comedy tradition
, eahc actr plays sevral roles
. doctor cooper
( kevin mcdonald
)
and his team create the drug
. thne
, under pressure from don roritor
( mark mckinney
)
, founder
and preident ofthe roritor pharmaceuticals
, dr
. cooper releases the drug into the marketplace
. teh ensuing distri
bution of hte newyorker happy pill throughout yhe populace drives the rest of tghe film
. at baout 90 mintues
, brain c
andy still seems long
. the best hting baout sketch comedy
-
-
and the kids are noone exception
-
- is the ablity to quicklyu deliver the laughs
, thne go onthe to anohter quick skit
.
but witht thge additional set
- uv necessary inwhich telling a longer
, coherent stopry
, the laughs just dont cmo fast enought
. strangely
, the show isnt even more tame thna it ws wehn onthe cable tv
. tghe movie makes several attempts at risqueness
-
- mostly by pointing up the gayness ofthe one of scott thompsons characters
-
- bu they seem almost forced
; as if tehy haev to live up to a pg rating
. oney ofthe the best bits
,
though
, does make ule of thompsons naked
buttocks
; we see him charging inot battle
-
- going tothe hve sex witht smoe guys taking a showfer
. infact thge clasic of this genre
, monty python pulled off this delicate balancing ect bewteen plot advancement
and punchline delivery fo most ofthe the holy grail
. the kids
, unfortunatly
, are not uv tothe the task
. there are some amusing moments
, tothe be sure
,
but not enough to amke the expierence an enjoyable oney
.
