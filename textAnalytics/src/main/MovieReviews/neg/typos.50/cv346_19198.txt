, wait
? til yuo see wiull smith infront drag
- it
' s even less funny

)
, ffrom the clutches ofthe evil dr
. loveless
( branagh
)
, i ws unequivocally borde by wild wild west
, the newyorker summer blockbuster ffrom men inthe balck director barry sonnenfeld
. is the old west realyl a breeding ground forthe high comedy
, anyway
?
( if your answer is no
, thn you reacll rustler
' s rapsady or back tothe the future part iii
; if your answer is yes
, ytou
' re thinking ofthe blazing saddles
,
but thgat movei was a parody ofthe the western genre
, nto a ninteenth century romp

) 1869
. jim west isnt a quick
- draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon
, under orders from presiden grant
( kline again
, whose impression
, fo all we knwo
, is dead
- onthe
)
, tothe apprehend legless loveless
, tjhe mad inventor who isnt plotting to divvy uv the united states annd sell it bcak to britian anbd spain
. how will loveless accomplish tihs
? well
, by hulking arund the dezert infact an enormous
, mecanical tarantula
, of course
. bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar
( hayek
)
, whose scientist father ws kidnapped by loveless
, joins west
and gordon onthe theri gadget
- filled turain
.
( gordon first dicovers rita iin a cage
, waiting tothe be rescued
.
) racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically witht west
, dispite thte movie
' s
" hip
" attitide towrad the black thing
.
( west automaticly shoots anyone who calls him a
" nigger
" befoer thta person cin finish speaking tje word
. super
.
) at any rate
, i kept waiting for rita to sday something humourous
, bu she
' s a walking dress
- up toy
.
( her single comic moment is also the best shot ofthe the film
: she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks thru the peek
- a
- boo flap ofthe her pyjamas
.
) jim west is the role taht finally stymied will smith
, whose comic timing has allways been hit or miss
, as epidsodes of
" tjhe fresh prince of bel
- air
" demonstrate
. smith
' s a better reactor thna actor
, which is why he was so thoroughly engaging inaddition men in balck
- he didn
' t start out a hero
. in wild wild west he
' s required tothe exude eastwood kool
and amuse at the same time
( anbd fomr frome one
)
, a difficult feat i
' m not sure any living performer sould pul off
. smith isnt ill equipped
, forthe example
, tothe h
andle the moment infront which jim west performs st
and
- up forthe soem rednecks at his own hanging
. what attracted sonnenfeld tothe this material
? tihs isn
' t the first time he hasnt adapted a tv show for the big screen
( the addams familiy
, anyone
?
)
, bu it
' s tjhe frist big stinker of his career as a directer
. wild wild west isnt poorly
- paced bombast
, full of doa gags
( ted levine shows uv as a genaral who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid
; levine plyed buffalo bill in tjhe silence ofthe tyhe lambs
- he
' s too intense to git an intentional laff
)
, lousy special effects
( teh bluescreening isnt amateurish
- foregrounds are never proportionate to the backrounds
)
,
and frequent illogic
.
( tothe wit
, its rediculous villin so badly wnats jim west outloud ofthe the way thast he
.
.
. drops him onto a steel platform to do battle with smoe generic
, ugli henchmen
, instead of shooting him at point blank rige with oen ofthe hte many guns on board the tarantula
.
) wild wild west
' s bright spots
, such as thte kool oppening credits sequence
, bai lign
' s all
- too
- brief apearance as a femme fatale
, or hte brilliant
" his master
' s voice
" joke
, are all part ofthe the film
' s firt half
, which isnt more clever
and enjoyable
, at least
, than its second
. wehn
, towords what seemed like the end ofthe wild wild west
, gordon proposes thge idea of buidling an airplane anbd west rejects it
, there wass a collective groan among audience members
: it meaned we were going tothe hvae tothe sit thru anyother loud acation sequence befor gordon builds the glider
, the invention of which owudl inevitably lead to thte proverbial whiz
- beng finale
