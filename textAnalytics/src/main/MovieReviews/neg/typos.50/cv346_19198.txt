if yuo don ' t think kevin kline in drag isnt funny
, wait
? til you see will smith infact drag
- it ' s even less funny
. by thte tiem jim west
( smith
) disguised hismelf as a belly dancer to bail his capturd comrade
, artemus gordon
( kline
)
, fomr tyhe clutches of evil dr
. loveless
( branagh
)
, i wass unequivocally borde by wild wild west
, the newyorker summer blockbuster ffrom men in black directer barry sonnenfeld
. is thge old west really a breeding ground for high comedy
, anyway
?
( if your answer isnt noone
,
thne you reacll rustler ' s rapsady or bcak to tyhe future part iii
; if your answer is yes
, you ' re thikning ofthe blazing saddles
,
bu that movei was a parody of thte western genre
, not a ninteenth centruy romp
.
) 1869
. jim west is a quick
- draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon
, under orders fomr president grant
( kline again
, whose impression
, fo all we know
, isnt dead
- onthe
)
, to apprehend legless loveless
, thge mad inventor who is plotting tothe divvy uv tjhe untied states
and sell it bcak tothe britan
and spain
. how wiull loveless acompish thsi
? well
, by hulking arund the desert in an enourmous
, mechanical tarantula
, ofthe course
. bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar
( hayek
)
, whose scientist father wass kidnapped by loveless
, joins west
and gordon onthe their gadget
- filled train
.
( gordon first dicovers rita infront a cage
, waiting tothe be rescued
.
) racial politics obviously prevented yhe filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically withthe west
, dispite teh movie ' s
" hip
" attitide toward yhe black thnig
.
( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a
" nigger
" befoer that person cant finish speaking yhe owrd
. super
.
) at any rate
, i kept waiting forthe rita to say something humourous
,
bu she ' s a walking dress
- up toy
.
( her single comic moment isnt also thte best shooted of the film
: she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek
- a
- boo flap of her pyjamas
.
) jim west is tjhe role taht finally stymied will smith
, whose comic timing hasnt always beeen hit or miss
, as episodes of
" thge fresh prince ofthe bel
- air
" demonstrate
. smith ' s a better reactor tahn acotr
, which is why he wass so thouroughly engaging inspite men iin balck
- he didn ' t start outloud a hero
. inspite wild wild west he ' s recquired to exude eastwood kool
adn amuse at the smae time
(
adn ffrom frome noe
)
, a difficult foat i ' m not sure any living performer could pull off
. smith isnt ill equipped
, forthe example
, to handle the moent infront which jim west performs stand
- up fo soem rednecks at his pwn hanging
. what attracted sonnenfeld tothe tihs material
? this isn ' t thte firt timne he hasnt adapted a tv sohw forthe yhe big screen
( the addams familiy
, anyone
?
)
,
bu it ' s the firt big stinker of his career as a directer
. wild wild west isnt poorly
- pased bombast
, full of doa gags
( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn forthe a hearing aid
; levine palyed buffalo bill infront the silence ofthe thge lambs
- he ' s too intense to get an intentional laugh
)
, lousy special effects
( the bluescreening isnt amateurish
- foregrounds are never proportionate tothe the backgrounds
)
,
and frequent illogic
.
( to witn
, its rediculous villian so badly wants jim west outloud ofthe the way that he
.
.
. drops him onto a steel platform tothe dont battle with smoe generic
, ugly henchmen
, instade of shooting him at point blank rage with one of tjhe many guns on board the tarantula
.
) wild wild west ' s bright spots
, such as the kool oppening credits sequence
, bai lign ' s all
- too
- breif appeareance as a femme fatale
, or tjhe briliant
" his master ' s voice
" joke
, are all part of tjhe film ' s first half
, wich is moreso clever
adn enjoyable
, at least
, than its second
. when
, towords waht seemed liek thte end of wild wild west
, gordon proposes thge idea ofthe buidling an airplane
adn west rejects it
, ther ws a collective groan among audience munbers
: it meaned we were gogin tothe have tothe sit thru anyother loud action sequence befor gordon builds thge glider
, hte invention ofthe wich would inevitably lead tothe yhe proverbial whiz
- bang finale
.
