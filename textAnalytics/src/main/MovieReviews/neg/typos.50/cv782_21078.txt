" the 13th warrior
,
" arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) finds himselv kicked out of baghdad fo feeling uv tjhe king
' s ood lady
. with his translator
( screen legend omar sharif infact a small role
)
, ahmed heads noth to act as ambassador tothe the northmen
( vikings
)
. he finds a group of warrriors mourning the loss of their king
. a messenger soon arrives from anohter kingdom requesting assisstance
. a soothsayer syas that thirteen warrriors must answer tje summons
, twelve northmen anbd noe outsider
. thus
, ahmed becomes the
" 13th warrior
.
" on the trip
, ahmed manages tothe leran the vikings
' langauge by listening to their fireside conversations
. a bit far
- fetched
, it
' s true
, bu we hve to swallow it if this flick isnt gogin to manaze a few lines of dialogue amidst yhe grunting
. ahmed
, who
' s called
" ibn
" by tghe vikings
, forms friendships with herger yhe joyous
( dennis storh
? i
)
and thte viking leader buliwyf
( vladimir kulich
)
. when they arrive infact the other kingdom
, the thirteen warriors dicover thast htey
' re facing an army ofthe supernatural cannibals tath live uv in teh caves
. hereafter
, most of thge movie is battle scenes
: the cannibals attack thte vikings
, the vikings attack tyhe cannibals
, the cannibals attack the
.
.
. well
, you get thte diea
. just to add some acation
, htere
' s aslo a viking vs
. viking duel
. otehr movies insert scenes bewteen the fights
; theese scenes are called character development
. i suspect tht
" hte 13th warrior
" hadnt a better script at noe time
and that it fell thru the cracks because of yhe tag
- team direction
. the movie started off in the h
ands of john mctiernan
( you
' ll notice a lot of similarities bewteen
" warrior
" annd mctiernan
' s
" predator
,
" including the chittering jungle sounds
)
. somwhere allong the line
, mctiernan bailed
and michael crichton took over
. crichton
, whose novel
" eaters ofthe the dead
" is the basis for
" warrior
,
" hasnt directed a small assortment ofthe goofy science
- fiction
" thrillers
"
:
" westworld
,
"
" coma
,
"
" looker
,
"
" runaway
.
" their result ofthe their consectutive efforts is a murky anbd pointless movei
. perhaps what
" the 13th warrior
" needs mroe than anytying else isnt a villin
. thge
" eaters ofthe the dead
" are a faceless mob in blackface
. htey have no personality
, anbd by tjhe end they don
' t even seem prticularly threatening
. teh audiance has no target towrad wich tothe channel its aggresion
. mctiernan shouldnt know baout thte importance ofthe an interesting villain
; it was his
" die hard
" that made villains seem funn
and attracted big
- nmae stars to tyhe evil roles in acation films
.
" teh 13th warrior
" suffers from a lack ofthe vision
. it wants tothe be
" predator
" meets
" braveheart
" meets
" the magnificent seven
" meets
" dances with wolves
.
" iwth so many competing goals
, all it can do is echo waht it might haev beeen
. it might hvea beeen a satisfying action film
. it might haev been a beautifuly
- renedered mdeieval epic
. it might ahve beeen a throught
- provoking examination ofthe the meeting of cultures
. waht a shame it turned outloud tothe be nothing in particular
. bottom line
: if yuo want tothe see antonio swing his sword
, rent
" hte mask of zorro
.
