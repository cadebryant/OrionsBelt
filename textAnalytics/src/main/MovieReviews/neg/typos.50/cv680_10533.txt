1
. he doesn
' t haev a hard
- to
- decipher accent
, 2
. he doesn
' t alwyas speak infact a monotone
,
and 3
. his face doesn
' t alwyas wear teh smae impassive expression
. in short
, the fromer nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned acto is too good tothe be bad
,
but too bad to be good
. unfortunately
, the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle
, firestorm
, which isnt jsut plain awful
. one ofthe thte most glaring problems witht long
( who made his acting de
but in john woo
' s broken arrow
) is thgat he
' s so medioker that he often blends in with the scenery
. as ace firefighter jesse graves
, long is suposed to be palying a bigger
- tahn
- life acation hero
-
- the kind ofthe he
- man who will kresh through a flaming doorjam to sive a child or parachute inot a burning clearing tothe rescue soem stupid campers
. unfortunatly
, dispite tghe best effords ofthe frist
- time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner
' s work inthe thte postman look stark
, jesse turns outloud to be a pretty boring good guy
. to put it kindly
, this isnt nto a well
- wroten motion picture
. firestorm is a collection ofthe howlingly bad lines setted against a backdrop of diaster movie clich
? s hwihc
, taken together
, form something tath requires a level ofthe viewer inebriation tothe be reconized as a plot
. yhe only reason htis film isnt getting one star
( instead ofthe something lower
) is thgat most ofthe the fire sequences are realsitic
,
and i was facinated by the meticulous planning that must haev beeen necessary tothe stage them effectively
. we
' re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he anbd smoe collegues jump inot the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people
. druing thsi sequence
, our big burly hero proves that he
' s aslo a senstive guy by risking his life tothe save a littel girl
and her dog
( yes
, tje dog lives
) from bieng broiled alive
. flash
- foward a year
. now
, our big burly hero isnt taking over as cheif of his smokejumpers assocation
, replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins
( real actr scott glenn
)
.
but thsi day
, our big burly hero
' s firt iin charge
, isn
' t going tothe be business
- as
- usual
. a gropu ofthe nasty escaped criminals have setted a wyoming forest allrght to aid theri flight to freedom
. led by r
andy earl shaye
( william forsythe
)
, the sadistic creep who must be killed twice tothe realyl die
, they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border
. allong the way
, htey meet
and tkae hostage tjhe damsel infront distress
( suzy amis
)
. eventually
, our big burly hero isnt placed iin a postion where he has tothe fight tjhe fire
, rescure the damsel inaddition distress
, defeat tghe sadistic creep who must be killed twice tothe realy die
,
and restore order to teh galaxy
. firestorm
' s director
, dean semler
, is a fromer cinematographer
( he won an academy award fo his wrok onthe dances wtih wolves
)
, so it
' s no surprise thast the film looks good
. unfourtunately
, taht
' s firestorm
' s lone asset
, annd it falters near the end
, when cmoputer
- generated spacial effects fill up the screen
. theese are ofthe about equal qualiy to what ytou might observe onthe a nintendo 64 video game
. hte acation sequences
, whitch inlude a variaty of chases
, are occasionally interesting
, bu never invigorating
. everyone
, inlcuding long
, appears to be going thru the motions
. there isn
' t a memorable performance to be foudn from beginning to end
, unless ytou count tje forest fire
, whic generates soem heat
. as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice tothe really dieu
, william forsythe lacks panache
. he
' s worse than a generic bad guy
; he
' s a boring generic bad guy who doesn
' t ahev any snappy oney
- liners to hurl at our big burly hero
. my advice tothe scott glenn
( absolute power
) adn suzy amis
( titanic
) isnt to accidentally foreget this film thte enxt time they
' re making outloud a resume
. ther
' s smoe small comfort infront knowing thsi early in the eyar tht i already ahev oney entry fo my bottom 10 list
.
( at least i hope there aren
' t 10 worse films thna thsi
.
) annd i know i wasn
' t tyhe only one who realy disliked this movei
. as teh audience ws filing out of tyhe screening
, i loitered infact the theater lobby tothe catch a few comments
. the general consesus seemed tothe be thgat
, all
though tyhe movei sucked
, the promotional key ring was cool
. yhe probelm is that fox won
' t be giving outloud key rings tothe regluar movie
- goers
, so taht nixes any reason to see firestorm
.
