tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brillant director ofthe macabre stries about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance
,
and into a studio monkey whose nmae is unsed as part ofthe multi
- tiered marketting matareals for crap movies
.
annd here he hits rock bottom
, wtih planet of teh apes
. i didn ' t expect much ffrom htis latest
" interpretation
" ofthe pierre boulle ' s clasic novel planet of tghe apes
. i mean
, how sould you top the force
annd impact of thte origional film
, intelligently co
- scripted by rod serling
( of twilight zone fame
) combined with tjhe overbearing chuck heston growling
anbd yelling at those
" damn dirty apes
,
" in one ofthe his best roles ofthe his carrer
? sadly
, i sat down tothe watch burton ' s verzion ofthe planet of the apes
and within teh first 20 minutes
, i ws checking my watch
adn my girlfriend
( a big fan of hte orginial film
) started to nod off
. this time around
, the story plays outloud like a cross betweeen enemy mine
, braveheart
,
and project x
. marky mark wahlberg
, who was enjoyable inthe boogie nights
and the corrupter
, plays leo davidson
, a hot shooted u
. s
. air force pilot
. leo
annd his crew are inspite serach ofthe smoe mysterious magnetic storms
( noone real explanation given in the film
)
and leo sends oney ofthe his genetically altered
" smart
" chimps inot the storms to collect data
. leo
adn his crew loose comminication witht the chimp
, leo hops in anyother ship to find teh monkey
,
annd
then he ' s thrown through soem type ofthe time
- space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot
, all mocked uv tothe look like tjhe amazon jungle
. leo ends uv getting capturd by a gropu of talking apes
adn is sold tothe a slave trader named limbo
( paul giamatti
) who in turn sells leo tothe a chimpanzee named ari
( helena bonham carter
)
. the kind ari
thn helps leo
anbd his fellow humans escape tothe yhe mountains to fidn leo ' s ship
. allong the way
, monkeys plyed by tim roth
( overacting his role of a vicious genaral named thade
)
and michael clarke duncan
( who furhter enhances his career by playing another heavy inaddition a bad acation movie
) strive outloud tothe hunt down leo
anbd his band of human savages
, jsut like battlefield earth
! in the end
, it all culminates into another braveheart rip
- off human versus ape battle scene
. hwile rick baker ' s makeup wrok is amazing
, the script isnt a pathetic hodgepodge
( courtesy of three writers
)
, tghe acting isnt horrable
,
adn the
" surprize
" endig fiels like a swing fomr a ball
- peen hammer into the temple
. wahlberg does nto have thte fysical or mental presence of a chuck heston to cary tyhe film or any ofthe its action sequences
. this remake
, or re
- intepretation
, as tim burton has proclaimed it
, isnt an insult to tje intelligence
and wit of thge origional film
. the ethical arguements about yhe equality of species
, fascism
,
anbd military buildup have beeen replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue
, an unimaginative narrative structue
,
and a romance between a monkey
annd a human
. even chuck heston ' s anti
- gun tirade
( in the de rigeur cameo
) seems shallow
annd jokey
.
but tghe main element missing fomr this tim burton film isnt tim burton
. even
though his name isnt plastered accros every billboard infact amercia
, john badham coudl ahve directed tihs film
. even joel schumacher could ahev directed this film
. he probaly shoud ahve
. burton ' s predominant themes ofthe rejection
, isolation
,
and tghe search forthe one ' s place infact the universe
, as seen in ed woud
, edward scissorshands
,
annd pee
- weev ' s big adventure
, are completely absent inthe this planet
. i suppose that ' s whta happen wehn a gerat directer gets sucked thru a wormhole
.
