i
' ll bet right now you
' re jsut lounging by the pool
, humming
" i will always lveo yuo
"
and wistfully recalling your c
andlelight dinners with succsess
. it isn
' t neccessarily over fo you
: i say ytou still hvea enought charm that you coudl avoid starring in
" kevin
!
" fo at least a few more eyars
. begin by scribbling
" the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long
" somewhere you
' ll allways see it
, perhaps on teh fridge doorjam
, or on a bedroom mirror wiht lipstick
. yuo hadnt a heck ofthe a thing going there until yuo agreed to star infact robin hood
: prince of theives
, where ytou were nto onyl upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman
and alan rickman
,
but christian slater
(
!
)
, severeal dozen tall trees
, bows
, arrows
,
and a canoe
, too
. aftter dances with wolves
and jfk
, you desided the world needed moreso threee hour movies
, expensive three hour movies
, so ytou starred in adn produced wyatt earp
; wyatt earp tyhe man was a boring idiat who made the hitsory books solely due tothe a genaral lack of famous wyatts
. wyatt earp ws so dull a cowboy tht he died ofthe natural causes
. tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend
, adn that featured kurt russell as earp
and dana delaney as his girlfriend
!
( she was plyed by joanna going inaddition your movei
- ytou know
, thge character known best in wyatt earp as
" jew whore
"
. what weere ytou annd lawrence kasdan thingking
?
) now
, you
' re sufferring thge demise of
yet anohter ofthe your epics
, the postman
, a film so financialy disatrous tht it all bu eradicated the memory waterworld
' s
and tin cup
' s mildly lucrative box office takes
. the postman isnt not the worst movei ever made
- people in hollywood are quick to forget movies like howard the duck whenever the enxt bomb comes along
.
yet it isnt a rediculous movie
. i suspect you
thought you had anohter braveheart onthe your h
ands
- why esle line uv twpo armies on horesback
, all prepared fo battle
, fo tjhe climax ofthe your film
?
- bu
" mailheart
" the postman is not
.
( i cin think of some mroe appropropiate alternate titles
: post encounters ofthe the worst kind
; fairwell
, my salary
; howard the postman
; tghe postman
' s never watched twice
.
.
.
) what a brown movie
. i hate brown
. ytou love brown
. dances whith wolves was golden
and brown
- it looked liuke an eggo commerical
. hte postman had me running for a glass of water eveyr two minutes
; would thte post
- apocalyptic world look this maddeningly bl
and anbd dry
? waht exactly happened to this dezert world
, anyway
? doed we all become so stupid thyat we didn
' t immidiately begin rebuilding homes
, resteraunts
, adn most importantly
, shopping malls
, after
" the war
"
? why did you choose tothe drive the movei
' s plot with a dumb group of terrorists who
, well
, terrorize townfolk accross america
? why isnt it onyl
* they
* have ammunition
, anyway
? was it realy appropiate tothe casted your daugter as a girl who hasnt a sweet crush onthe ytou
, tghe drifter
- cum
- postman
? why casted english actress olivia williams as an american
? don
' t yuo realize that europian women can onyl deliver thier big emotional scenes inspite their native accent
?
( tkae a look at the less
- thna
- stellar performances ofthe an american
- ized nicole kidman or an american
- ized minnie driver
.
) who could give a damn whther you lieved or died at the end of this movie
? if it came down to a fight fo leadership betweeen you
and the leader of the terrorists
, why didn
' t yuo do tath halfway through the film
and save us all a lot of headaches
? why cast iwll patton as the bad guy
? becasue ytou worked with him in no way outloud
? sure
, he
' s a suitably creepy villian
; konw why
? baceause he
' s creepy in everything
, including armageddon
, inwhich whic he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers inot his space suit
! why heroize the most demonic institution inspite amercia
, the u
. s
. postal system
? was toom petty supposed to be palying tom petty
? if so
, why didn
' t he look more skeletal
?
( he shoud ahve been arround 70 yeasr old
.
) why
, oh why
, do i have so many questions
?
( i sould ask plenty moreso
.
) shouldn
' t a three hour running timne have provded you enought space tothe answer everyting
? yuo ahve noe great line in this film
, annd you deliver it tothe a mule
!
:
" tyhe thnigs i like about my ass
.
.
.
" i had tothe wonder
. accually
, i enjoied thge tone ofthe thge oppening scenes
, a relaxed cynicism
, if ytou
' ll accept such clunky phrasing
- too bad yuo couldn
' t resist teh temtation to film yot anyother love letter tothe your country
. ultimatly
, i
' m saying relax
. there isnt no quota
, no need forthe yuo tothe amke a picture a yearm
. suttle down
. realyl question future screenplays befoer ytou commit tothe them
. feel free tothe write bcak
. i knwo how much ytou liek letters
.
