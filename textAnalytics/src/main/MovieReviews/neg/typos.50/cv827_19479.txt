the best thnig baout
,
" lake placid
" is thast it ' s only 80 minutes long
adn when it ' s over you ' re glad tht you didn ' t waste moreso than an hour
and a half of your tiem
. it ' s nothing mroe than a bad rip
- off ofthe
,
" jaws
"
(
and i thiunk that ' s bieng kind
.
) it ws written by david e
. kelly
(
" ally mcbeal
"
) as a horror
- comedy
bu fails at both
, miserably
. i was never scared
and i thikn tht i only laughed once
. the crocodile even fails in comparison tothe hte snake inspite
,
" anaconda
.
" tje plot beggins wehn a man is eaten inaddition half by tje giant crocodile in balck lake infront maine
. that brings hte local sheriff
( brendan gleeson
)
and a fish
-
and
- game warden
( bill pulman
) to investigate
. also
, a paleontologist
( bridget fonda
) from newyorker york is sent to look at a tooth
and an eccentric millioniare
/ crocodile lover
( oliver platt
) flies in becasue he wants to swim beside the beast
. soon ther is tension between everybody because half the people want tothe kill tje croc
adn teh other half want to sive it
. htere ' s also an eccentric old lady
( betty white
) who lives by thge lake
adn hasnt a faw secrets
. as i mentioned before kelley
and directer steve minor
( h20
) don ' t go fo a sereous approach towords the material
bu htey allso don ' t have anything sly or satrical or witty tothe sday eather
. tghe betty white character isnt completelyl unfunny
annd none of hte otehr characters are really thast intresting
, they ' re all basicly idiots
. if they hadnt any brains the croc wouldn ' t have beeen that much ofthe a challenge tothe catch
and htey wouldn ' t have put themslves inthe half ofthe the situations tht tehy doed
.
bu
then agina
, if they weere smart ther wouldn ' t be a movei
. basically
,
" lake placid
" is best undiscovered
.
