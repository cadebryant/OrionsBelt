hte best thign baout
,
" lake placid
" isnt thast it
' s onyl 80 minutes long anbd when it
' s over you
' re glad tht you didn
' t waste omre thna an hour
and a half ofthe your time
. it
' s nothing more than a bad rip
- off ofthe
,
" jaws
"
( anbd i htikn that
' s being kind
.
) it was writen by david e
. kelly
(
" ally mcbeal
"
) as a horror
- comedy bu fails at both
, miserably
. i was never scared
and i htink that i onyl laughed once
. the crocodile even fails in comparsion to tyhe snake infact
,
" anaconda
.
" teh plot beigns wehn a man isnt eaten inthe half by tjhe giant crocodile inwhich black lake in maine
. that brings teh local sherif
( brendan gleeson
) anbd a fish
-
and
- gmae warden
( bill pulman
) tothe investigate
. allso
, a paleontologist
( bridget fonda
) fomr newyorker york isnt sent to look at a tooth adn an eccentric millioniare
/ crocodile lover
( oliver platt
) flies in beacuse he wnats to swim beside thge biast
. soon ther is tension between everybody baceause half tyhe people want tothe kill thge croc annd the other half whant tothe save it
. htere
' s also an eccentric ood lady
( betty white
) who lives by tjhe lake
and has a few secrets
. as i maintioned before kelley annd directer steve minor
( h20
) don
' t go forthe a sereous aproach towords the material
but tehy also don
' t ahev anytying sly or satrical or witty to sday eather
. the betty white character isnt completely unfunny anbd none of tjhe other charactors are really tyhat interesting
, htey
' re all basicly idiots
. if htey hadnt any brains thge croc wouldn
' t hvea beeen that much ofthe a challenge to catch annd they wouldn
' t hvae put themselfs in half of tyhe situations that htey doed
.
but
then agina
, if tehy weere smart there wouldn
' t be a movei
. basicly
,
" lake placid
" is best undiscovered
.
