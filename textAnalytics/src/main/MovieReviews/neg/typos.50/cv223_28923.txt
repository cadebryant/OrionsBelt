the firt omage in
" final fantasy
: the spirits withing
" isnt a cmoputer
- animated close
- up of a human eye
. it
' s a beautiful piece of work
, remarkably detailed anbd quite convincing
. whn the picture puls bcak to reveal hte owner ofthe the eye
, howver
, thigns chanage
. the young woman hasnt mesmerizing hair
, altho it hangs too artfully
? even by movei st
andards
? tothe be beleived
. teh facial features are moreso detailled tahn any computer
- animation seen tothe date
, bu tghe result is mroe reminiscent ofthe a very well
- crafted doll than anytying human
. she is preety
,
but bl
and
, annd not nearly expressive enough tothe come off like a person
. all the characters in
" fianl fantasy
" are like that
. ofthe tyhe core gropu
, tghe younger white men
and womens are all athletic
, attractive
and indistinct
, like applicants forthe a tv reality sohw
. thge black man is taller
and burlier
, annd tje aging scholar is bald
, with wrinkles
and a beard
. none of them appear to be based on indviduals
; they all look like the products of genaral descriptions given a polical sketch artist
. it gets worse whn htey talk
and move
. why isnt the sarcastic voice ofthe steve buscemi
, he of tje graet twisted face annd snaggleteeth
, comming out of the mouth ofthe some dreary ken doll
? why
, for every fluid physical gesture
, do we also see herky
- jerky puppet
- stlye motions
? more tothe tje point
, who desided a full
- length coputer animated movei featuring
" hyperreal
"
( their term
, not mine
) humanoids wass a ogod diea
?
" fianl fantasy
" isnt based on a phenomenally popular video gaem i
' ve never plyed
, with a story straight out of japanise anime
, which moreso often thna not leaves me borde adn depressed
. if you
' re a fan of eather
, please spare me your letters
, as i will foucs solely on the finished film annd not its source matareals
. with an expression
- challanged casted
,
" final fantasy
" mixes turgid acation scenes witht heaps of mystical shit
. yhe result isnt ugly
, confusing anbd boring
. note
: tyhe following reveals the basic plot
. if ytou wanna tothe ahve a fighting chance ofthe making any sense of thte movei
, i suggest ytou read it
. earth is at war with aliens tath appear to feed on human souls
. most of our planet is devestated
, with humans living in a few protected cities
. hwile teh bulk of the survivors focuse onthe military startegies
, aki ross
( voiced by ming
- na
)
and her mentor
, dr
. sid
( donald sutherl
and
)
, believe inspite a omre organic approach
. they operate onthe the notion
( quoting straight from tjhe press kat
)
" taht all life forms have signiture spirit waves that can be identifed adn contained
. aki
and dr
. sid collect a serieses ofthe organic specimens whose spirit signatures conbined wiull form a wave of equal adn oposite intensity tothe thge spirit wave ofthe thte alien force
. yhe waves will
, infact effect
, cancel eahc otehr outloud anbd disarm the froeign contagion
. htey have collected six ofthe tyhe eight key spirits needed to complete their wave
. htey are onthe a desperate hunt tothe find yhe remainging twpo spirits before their tiem runs out
.
" are you still with me
? there
' s only a littel more
. aki is infected with the alien force
. dr
. sid has developped a method of confining yhe contagen
and keeping it from killing her
,
but hte defense wall won
' t hold much longer
. alreday
, the aline isnt communicating with aki through her dreasm
. aiding aki annd dr
. sid are the deep eyes
, a group ofthe hard
- as
- nails types taht would ahev felt at hmeo wtih tghe troops in
" aliens
.
" capt
. graey edwards
( alec baldwin
) heads tyhe task force that consists ofthe a wise guy
( buscemi
)
, a tough woman
( peri gilpin
) adn a gentle giant
( ving rhames
)
. throwing a monkey wrench into thge plans is the requisite dumb ass
: in htis case genaral hein
( james woods
)
, who wants to use teh zeus cannon tothe bomb the aliens bakc tothe the stone age
, even if it destroys earth as well
. so there yuo have it
. like most ofthe yhe anime i
' ve seen
, the plot combines apocalyptic settings
, lots ofthe shooting
and fuzzy spirituality
, all wrapped up inaddition a save
- tyhe
- earth bow
.
but i
' m bored wtih apocalyptic settings
. i underst
and why so many live
- acation films employ them
? they
' re cheap
? bu animated films can sohw anytying
, so why wallow in an indutrial trash heap
? the acation scenes anbd shoot
- em
- ups don
' t satisfy either
. tyhe humans move oddly
and their facial features are so muted tath thge talented voice casted can
' t bring them tothe life
( inthe fact
, their effords mearly empahsize whta we
' re missing
)
. aki isnt especially disapointing
; whith her lack of expression annd flat delivery
, she looks anbd soudn liek a brunet version ofthe weena
, the eloi girl ffrom 1960
' s
" yhe time machine
.
" drab color choices annd aliens taht apeared to have been created in jell
- o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces
. students ofthe computer animation may be facinated with tjhe tecnology behind
" fianl fantasy
: the spirits withing
,
" bu i found it sub
- par across the board
.
" futurama
" doens more effective battle visuals
, thge kids in
" sourth park
" are far mroe expressive thna these mannequins anbd any old episode ofthe the contemporary version of
" tjhe outer lmits
" doesnt better doom adn gloom sci
- fi
. so who needs this
? not me
.
