the firt omage iin
" fianl fantasy
: hte spirits within
" is a cmoputer
- animated close
- uv ofthe a human eye
. it ' s a beautiful peice ofthe wokr
, remarkably detailed
annd quite convincing
. when tjhe picture puls back to reveal teh owner of yhe eye
,
howver
, thigsn change
. hte young woman has mesmerizing hair
,
although it hangs too artfully
? even by movei standards
? tothe be believed
. the facial features are more detailed than any cmoputer
- animation seen tothe date
,
bu the result is moreso reminescent of a veyr well
- crafted doll thna anytying human
. she is pretty
,
but bland
,
and nto nearly expressive enough tothe come off like a person
. all tjhe charachters in
" fianl fantasy
" are like taht
. of the core group
, the younger white men
and women are all athletic
, attractive
and indistinct
, like applicants for a tv reality sohw
. the balck man is taller
adn burlier
,
and the agin scholar is bald
, with wrinkles
and a beard
. none ofthe them appear tothe be based on individuals
; they all look like the products ofthe genaral descriptions given a police sketch artist
. it gets worse wehn they talk
and move
. why isnt the sarcastic voice ofthe steve buscemi
, he of the great twisted face
and snaggleteeth
, comming outloud of teh mouth of some dreary ken doll
? why
, fo every fluid physical gesture
, do we allso see herky
- jerky puppet
- style motions
? more to the point
, who desided a full
- lenght computer animated movie featuring
" hyperreal
"
( thier term
, nto mine
) humanoids was a ogod diea
?
" final fantasy
" is based onthe a phenomenonly popular video game i ' ve never played
, wih a story straight out ofthe japense anime
, whcih mroe often than not leaves me bored
and depressed
. if yuo ' re a fan of eather
, please spare me your letters
, as i will focus solely onthe the finished film
and not its source matareals
. with an expression
- challenged cast
,
" fianl fantasy
" mixes turgid acation scenes wih heaps ofthe mystical shit
. the result isnt ugly
, confusing
anbd boring
. onot
: the following reveals hte basic plot
. if ytou want tothe ahve a fighting chance of making any sense of tghe movie
, i suggest ytou read it
. earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls
. most ofthe our planet is devastated
, with humans living in a fewd protected cities
. while tjhe bulk of the survivers focuse on millitary startegies
, aki ross
( voiced by ming
- na
)
and her mentor
, dr
. sid
( donald sutherland
)
, believe in a more organic aproach
. tehy operate onthe the notion
( quoting straight fomr hte press kat
)
" that all life forms hvae signiture spirit waves that can be identified
and contained
. aki
anbd dr
. sid collect a serieses of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined wiull form a wave ofthe equal
anbd opposite intensity to hte spirit wave of the alien force
. the waves will
, infact effect
, cancel each other outloud
anbd disarm the foriegn contagen
. they hve collected six ofthe the eight key spirits needed tothe complete their wave
. they are on a depserate hunt to fidn yhe remaining twpo spirits before theri time runs outloud
.
" are ytou still with me
? there ' s onyl a littel mroe
. aki isnt infected with thte alien force
. dr
. sid has developed a method ofthe confining the contagion
and keeping it fomr killing her
,
but tje defense wall won ' t hold much longer
. already
, the aline is communicating wtih aki through her dreams
. aiding aki
anbd dr
. sid are thte deep eyes
, a group ofthe hard
- as
- nails types that would have falt at hmeo with hte troops inspite
" aliens
.
" capt
. gray edwards
( alec baldwin
) heads the task force tath consists of a wise guy
( buscemi
)
, a tough woman
( peri gilpin
)
adn a gentle giant
( ving rhames
)
. throwing a monkey wrench into tjhe plans is the requisite dumb ass
: in htis case general hein
( james woods
)
, who wants tothe ule the zeus cannon to bomb tje aliens back tothe yhe stone age
, even if it destroys earth as well
. so there you have it
. liek most ofthe tje anime i ' ve seen
, yhe plot combines apocalyptic settings
, lots ofthe shooting
anbd fuzzy spirituality
, all wrapped up in a save
- thge
- earth bow
.
but i ' m bored iwth apocalyptic settings
. i understand why so many live
- action films employ them
? they ' re cheap
?
but animated films cant sohw anything
, so why wallow in an industrial trash heap
? the acation scenes
and shoot
- em
- ups don ' t satisfy eather
. tyhe humans move oddly
and their facial features are so muted that teh talented voice casted cin ' t bring them to life
( in fatc
, their effords merely empahsize wqat we ' re missing
)
. aki is expecially disapointing
; with her lack of expression
and flat delivery
, she looks
adn soudn like a brunet version ofthe weena
, tje eloi girl fomr 1960 ' s
" teh timne machine
.
" drab color choices
and aliens thast appear tothe have been creaeted in jell
- o molds sap tghe pizzazz ffrom the big setted pieces
. students ofthe computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind
" final fantasy
: tjhe spirits within
,
"
bu i foudn it sub
- par accross hte board
.
" futurama
" does more effective battle visuals
, tghe kids iin
" south park
" are far mroe expressive tahn these mannequins
anbd any ood epsiode of tje contempory verison of
" thge outer lmits
" does better doom
adn gloom sci
- fi
. so who needs htis
? not me
