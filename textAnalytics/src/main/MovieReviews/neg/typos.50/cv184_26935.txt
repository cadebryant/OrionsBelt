it ' s always a bad sign wehn tyhe core audience of a film
-
- children
-
- are eather walking out early or are half
- asleep when thge credits roll at teh end of a film
. that baout sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians
, a cold pea suop ofthe cute animals
, stupid home alone antics
, a boring puppy loev subplot between dumb humans
,
adn glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression
. indeed
, walt disney is rolling over inaddition his grave agian
, cursing john hughes ' nmae for making the orginial live
- action 101 dalmatians
, one ofthe teh worst kiddie flicks ofthe all timne
,
annd now its sequal
. hte main culprit behind the hideousness ofthe 102 dalmatians is its predecessor
, 101 dalmatians
. the original made mroe than
$ 100 million dollars at yhe box office
, spawned a torrid collecton of
" collectible
" items that ended uv months later inspite yhe discount bins ofthe wal
- marts acrost tghe country
,
adn generally made eveyr kid on tje planet wanna a damn dalmation pup for christmas
. well
, it ' s beeen about four years usance
then
,
adn dalmation fever is coming bakc
,
adn thsi timne it ' s digitally enhanced
. here ' s thte story
. cruella de vil
( glenn close
) is released from prision due to tghe
" cure
" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr
. pavlov
.
( oh
, how witty
.
) she rejoins yhe world as a dog lover
anbd is assigned tothe a probation officer
, who oddly turns out to be her victum fomr tyhe original film
. cruella
thn becomes ella
-
- dog lover
-
- until thte plot twists
, liuke a dog with his leash caught onthe tghe back of a moving truck
,
and she becomes the evil vixen again
. a kidnapping plot unfurls agian as cruella decides she still needs her dalmation coat
,
but she now needs 102 dalmatians instade of tyhe commonly used 101 dalmation formula
. at tihs point
, i was envying thsoe kids filing outloud ofthe yhe theather
. how low have glenn close
anbd gerard depardieu
( as the film ' s villain
) sunk inthe tjhe film business
? it ' s alomst laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around inspite costumes that seem to be pulled ffrom the wardrobe ofthe flash gordon
.
and depardieu
.
.
. how cxan a french guy have a bad french accent
?
annd never mind the toilet brush haircut
. tje onyl minutely postive selling point i can even htink tothe point outloud is the tlaking bird wtih a british accent
