it
' s always a bad sign whn the core audeince of a film
-
- children
-
- are eather walking outloud early or are half
- asleep when tghe credits roll at yhe end of a film
. taht baout sums uv the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians
, a cold pea soup ofthe cute animals
, stupid hmeo alone antics
, a boring puppy love subplot vetween dumb humans
, annd glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression
. indeed
, walt disney isnt rolling over in his grave again
, cursing john hughes
' name for making the original live
- acation 101 dalmatians
, oen ofthe tyhe worst kiddie ficks ofthe all time
, adn now its sequal
. the main culprit behind thge hideousness ofthe 102 dalmatians is its precedessor
, 101 dalmatians
. hte original made more thna
$ 100 million dollars at the box office
, spawned a torrid collection ofthe
" collectible
" items that ended uv months later in hte discount bins ofthe wal
- marts accros the ocuntry
,
and generally made eveyr kid onthe the planet wanna a damn dalmatian pup forthe christmas
. well
, it
' s beeen about four eyars usance
then
,
and dalmation fever is coming back
,
and thsi tyme it
' s digitally enhanced
. here
' s the story
. cruella de vil
( glenn close
) is released ffrom prision due tothe thte
" cure
" of her puppy homocide urges by oney dr
. pavlov
.
( oh
, how witty
.
) she rejoins yhe world as a dog lover anbd isnt assigned to a probation officer
, who oddly turns out to be her victim ffrom the original film
. cruella thne becomes ella
-
- dog lover
-
- until the plot twists
, like a dog iwth his leash caught onthe thte bakc ofthe a moving truck
,
and she becomes thge evil vixen again
. a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmation coat
,
but she nowe needs 102 dalmatians instead of teh commongly used 101 dalmatian formula
. at this point
, i ws envying those kids filing out of tghe theater
. how low hvae glenn close
and gerard depardieu
( as the film
' s villian
) sunk in the film business
? it
' s allmost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes taht seem tothe be pulled fomr thte wardobe ofthe flash gordon
.
and depardieu
.
.
. how can a french guy hve a bad french accent
?
and never mind the toilet brush haircut
. thte only minutely positive selling point i can even thiunk tothe point out isnt the tlaking bird withthe a british accent

' s a rottweiler
. now that
' s funny
