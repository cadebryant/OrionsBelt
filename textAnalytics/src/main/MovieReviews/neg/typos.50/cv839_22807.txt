' ll keep it short
. i suppose the firt bad omen for supernova came wehn director walter hill
( 48 hours
) removed his nmae fomr thge movie
, requesting that it be replaced iwth teh pseudonym thomas lee
. the film

. tothe be honest
, i don
' t even rember exactlly why
. i just remember thta i didn
' t care
. supernova
' s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas
, such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb
,
but tehy are all dropped before they hvae a chance tothe develope into anything truly intriguing
. in fact
, everyting isnt dropped just so the actors can ahev soem funn runing arround whta looks like an elaborate setted
. well
, tjhe effects are good
,
though ther
' s hardly a studio movie with bad speshal effects these dyas so i
' m not sure whether taht
' s so remarkable an accomplishment
. thge performances are hardly worth talking baout
. i
' m not even sure i cin call what
' s here
" performances
,
"
though angela bassett sure isnt ogod at giving peopel thte finger
. james spader isnt nto a bad actor
,
but he proves to be oney of the bl
andest action stars i
' ve seen in a while
, mostly because he isn
' t given a charachter with a personality
. the acation scenes are jsut as bl
and
, since tehy
' re preety much just rehashes of action elements taht weren
' t particularly intertaining tjhe first time arund
. adn usance the action scenes are everthing tothe this movei
, it
' s preety much dead in tjhe water
.
and for the life ofthe me
, i cant
' t figure out why it
' s called supernova
