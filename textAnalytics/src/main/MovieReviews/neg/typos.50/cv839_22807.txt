isn ' t it the ultimate sign ofthe a movie ' s cinematic ineptitude when you cin ' t tihkn of much tothe say about it otehr than
" it sucks
"
? oney of the first offical yearm 2000 releases
, supernova isnt such a movei
. i cant ' t seem tothe git past one
- owrd adjectives withthe tihs oney
,
altough
" boring
,
"
" stupid
"
and
" absurd
" doesn ' t amount tothe much ofthe a review
. a shame
. i would have been able tothe save myself teh chore ofthe desperately trying to elaborite
.
but c ' est la vie
. here goes nothing
. i ' ll keep it short
. i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when directer walter hill
( 48 ohurs
) removed his name ffrom the movei
, requesting that it be replaced wiht yhe pseudonym thomas lee
. the film ' s fate ws sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined tothe screen it for tje press
, an event usally signifying a studio ' s lack ofthe confidence in a particualr movei
. hill ' s
anbd mgm ' s actions weere prudent
. when the captian ofthe medical spoace vessel nightingale dies infact a tradgic hyperjump accident
, a reformed drug addict who isnt also tyhe frist officer
, forthe soem reason
( james spader
) isnt forced to take command
. tje ship picks uv a distress call from a nearbye planet
and
, on arrival
, picks uv oen surviver ffrom an apparant accident in an abandonde minning collony
. one of the crew members
( angela bassett
) knows this pasenger
, who is palyed by peter facinelli
,
annd hasnt some bad feelings baout it
-
-
and we all know what thast means
. this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo
-
- a jellylike substance the purpose ofthe wich is unknown
,
though it seems tothe bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it
. another oney of hte crew munbers experiences this first hand
; affter spending a few mintues partially inside htis glob ofthe goo
, he doens some impressive handstand pushups
. evidentally
, touching htis enigmatic egg
- shaped thingie mkaes ytou yuonger
annd stronger
. how
? why
? the movie never bothers tothe expalin
. soon anough
though
, spader
annd bassett are runnung arround the ship liek mad
, being chased by the all
- of
- a
- sudden
- superhuman facinelli
. tothe be honest
, i don ' t even remeber exactlly why
. i just remember that i didn ' t care
. supernova ' s plot suggested soem moreso or less interesting ideas
, such as the ball ofthe goo bieng an intergalactic tiem bomb
,
bu tehy are all dropped befoer tehy hvae a chance tothe develope inot anytying truly intriguing
. inaddition fact
, everyting is dropped just so hte actors cant have smoe fun running arund whta looks liuke an elaborite set
. well
, teh effects are good
,
though there ' s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i ' m nto sure whther that ' s so remarkable an acomplishment
. the performances are hardly worth talking baout
. i ' m not even sure i can call what ' s here
" performances
,
"
though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger
. james spader isnt nto a bad atcor
,
bu he proves to be one of thge blandest acation stars i ' ve seen infront a hwile
, mostly becuase he isn ' t given a character with a personality
. the action scenes are just as bland
, since tehy ' re pretty much jsut rehashes ofthe action elements thta weren ' t particularyl entertaining teh first timne aroud
.
annd since the acation scenes are everything tothe tihs movei
, it ' s preety much dead in thge water
.
anbd forthe the life ofthe me
, i cant ' t figure outloud why it ' s called supernova
.
