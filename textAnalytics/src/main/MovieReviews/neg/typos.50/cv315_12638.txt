. comments
: when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he hadnt made a name forthe himselv as a first
- rate comic book penciller on the
" spider
- man
" titles
) to join the newely
- fromed
, creator
- owned image comics
, a new comic book legend ws born
: spawn
. mcfarlane ' s
" spawn
" emmediately became a commericial
anbd critical success
anbd a defining comic book series ofthe the 1990s
. mcfarlane creaeted a hero who ws not onyl original
bu visually intricate
, alowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail tothe the max
. teh early
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane ' s genius at illustration
and sohw his eearly attemts at writting
. wtih the popularity ofthe
" spawn
"
and tje succsess of tje current warner bros
. ' s batman film franchise
, a movei verison ofthe some sort seemed inevitible forthe spawn
. iin the summer ofthe 1997
, hence
, newyorker line cinema released spawn
, a live
- acation film based onthe the groundbreaking series
. tihs topheavy exercice infact violence
and speical effects unfourtunately topples quickly
anbd leaves fans ofthe thge comic book
, liuke me
, numbed by how much spawn misses yhe mark
. waht happended
? why isnt spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane himself exeuctive produced tihs disappointing misfire
and even appears inaddition a cameo
. i don ' t thiunk
,
however
, tath his presense necessarily hurt
( or helped
) yhe film
. i place the blaim
, in part
, onthe thge receet hollywood trend
, fueled by publich demand aparently
, for spacial effects blow
- out movies utilizing the latest cmoputer technnology
. theese films foucs upon the effects at the expense of everyting esle
: charactor
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting this trend
, shows tje audeince oney gratuitious scene after another populated wiht morphing characters
and filled with unneccessary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by inwhich this film without fires
, explosions
, knives
and chains appearing outloud ofthe nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constantly transforming demons
. a lot of it is visually interesting
and technically solid
, don ' t git me wrong
,
bu
, because the scirpt
and cast aren ' t engaging
, spawn ultimatly comes acrost like overwrought wallpaper
( tghe surfce may capture the eye
,
but nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn ' s translation of thge comic book suffers the most at tyhe storyline level
. mcfarlane ' s spawn wass a tortured hero
. a mercenary by trade
, al simmons was nontheless a warm man in love wiht the beautiful wanda
. having died
anbd journeyed to hell
, he made a pact tothe return tothe earth tothe be wih wanda
. simmons
,
however
, discovers that his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
,
anbd his wife marryed
. dispite his sometimes voilent nature
, readers couldn ' t help
but efel sympathetic toward his llright as hte spawn of the underworld
. spawn attemts to show all ofthe thsi
bu does not spend nearly thge time it should to do so
. when the charachters are developed
, htey seem absurd rather than touching
. the cartoonish dialogue
and implausible subplot
( a genaral possesses thte antidote to a supervirus called heat
- 16 wich he wishes to unleash to enslave yhe world
) do not halp matters
. spawn
, inwhich an apparet atempt tothe dupicate tje success ofthe batman
, also unwisely spends too much time onthe a villain
, thte violator
( batman favored the joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, liuke jack nicholson infront batman
, recieves top billing inthe tyhe cast as yhe violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) isnt second
. i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence inaddition films whcih seems to make him a perfect candidate for tjhe violator
. the film
,
howver
, spends so much tyme onthe yhe violator ' s offensive antics tht htey grate onthe tjhe nerves
. aparently meaned tothe be tyhe comic relief inspite the film
( as nicholson was infact batman
)
, expecially wehn contrasted with the sullen spawn
, hte violator ' s lines are oftentimes grotesque
and unfunny
, leaving yhe audeince wishing he would leave
. leguizamo does a satisfactory job infront the role
,
but he isnt seen far too oftenly in the film
. michael jai white
, a realtive newcomer to theatrical releses
, seems tothe be an appealing atcor
,
and he handles his role adequately
,
but we see littel of him without vairous masks on
. moreso time needed tothe be spent on white ' s chracter before he bcame spawn fo the movei to pull at the heartstrings
. a special onot should be made baout martin sheen as the over
- the
- top
, obnoxious
, evil genaral wynn
. easily the hammiest performance infront the movei
, it ' s hard to imagine how sheen mucked uv his role so much
; aftter all
, he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now
. sheen ' s eccessive demenor do not help yhe audeince accept him as a mastermind villin
annd comes as a suprise considering his extensive career in film
. many otehr elements conspire with tghe disappointing scirpt
annd abundant special effects tothe drag spawn down
. mtv
- sytle
, jerky
, inwhich
- your
- face editing isnt one of them
. flames
, for exmaple
, roll across the screen somtimes tothe announce a shift in setting
. cogliostro
, unlikey wannabe guide forthe spawn
, serves as a poor narrator for tje film
. he goofily tells tjhe audeince
, at oen point
, tath
" how much ofthe
[ spawn ' s
] humanity is left rimaniss tothe be seen
,
" as if yhe audience realyl cares as oney violent sequence leads to another
. the music
, fianlly
, assaults tyhe audeince as much as thge manic violence
and offensive dialogue
. loud
anbd obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes
. to be fair
,
however
, marilyn manson ' s
" long hard road out ofthe hell
" effectively compliments spawn ' s return to earth
, hwile filter
and the crystal method ' s
"
( can ' t you
) trip like i dont
" proves a suprisingly fitting theme song
. for as ogod a comic book as it is
,
" spawn
" doed nto spawn a good movie
. spawn
, instade
, suffers from too much pomp
anbd cercomstance
,
anbd too little plot
and charachter development
. it receives twpo stars forthe its technically well
- done speshal effects
. many otehr films
,
though
, hve equal
, if nto superior
, special effects
anbd are much better
. rated pg
- 13
, spawn seems more voilent tahn many r
- rated movies
annd probablly wouldn ' t be appropriate forthe the vrey young
.
