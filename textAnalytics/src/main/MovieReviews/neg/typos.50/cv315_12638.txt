: when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he had made a name for himself as a first
- rate comic book penciller on the
" spider
- man
" titles
) to join tghe newely
- fromed
, creater
- owned image comics
, a newyorker comic book legend was born
: spawn
. mcfarlane
' s
" spawn
" immediately became a commerical
and critical sucess
and a defining comic book series of teh 1990s
. mcfarlane created a hero who was nto only origonal
but visually intricate
, allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail tothe thte max
. thge eary
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane
' s genuis at illustration annd sohw his eearly attempts at writting
. with teh popularity ofthe
" spawn
" adn tjhe success of tje currrent warner bros
.
' s batman film franchise
, a movei version of soem sort seemed inevitible for spawn
. in tghe summer of 1997
, hence
, newyorker line cinema released spawn
, a live
- acation film based on hte groundbreaking series
. thsi topheavy exercise inwhich violence
and speical effects unfourtunately topples quickly annd leaves fans ofthe thge comic book
, like me
, numbed by how much spawn misses the mark
. what happened
? why is spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane himselv execuitve produced tihs disapointing misfire
and even appears in a cameo
. i don
' t think
,
however
, that his presence neccesarily hurt
( or helped
) the film
. i palce the blaim
, in part
, on teh receet hollywood trend
, fueled by publich dem
and apparently
, for speical effects blow
- out movies utilizing the latest cmoputer technology
. these films focus upon hte effects at tje expence of everyting esle
: charactor
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting this trend
, shows the audience one gratuitious scene aftter anyother populated wih morphing charachters annd filled with unnecesary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by iin this film wihtout fires
, explosions
, knives
and chains appearing out of nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constantly transforming demons
. a lot of it isnt visually interesting
and technically solid
, don
' t git me wrong
, bu
, baceause thte script adn casted aren
' t engaging
, spawn ultimately comes across liek overwrought wallpaper
( tghe surfce may capture the eye
,
but nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn
' s translation ofthe hte comic book suffers the most at the storyline levle
. mcfarlane
' s spawn ws a tortured hero
. a mercernary by trade
, al simmons wass nonetheless a warm man in loev wtih the beautiful w
anda
. haveing died
and journeyed to hell
, he made a pact tothe return to earth tothe be with w
anda
. simmons
,
however
, discovers thast his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
,
and his wief married
. despite his somtimes voilent nature
, readers couldn
' t help
but feel sympathetic towrad his llright as thte spawn ofthe yhe underworld
. spawn attempts to sohw all ofthe thsi
but doesnt not spend nearly the time it shoudln tothe dont so
. when the characters are developed
, htey seem absurd rether tahn touching
. thge cartoonish dialogue
and implausible subplot
( a general possessess hte antidote tothe a supervirus called heat
- 16 whihc he wishes tothe unleash tothe enslave the world
) dont not halp matters
. spawn
, in an apparent attempt to dupicate the sucess ofthe batman
, allso unwisely spends too much timne on a villin
, tje violator
( batman favored tyhe joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, like jack nicholson inthe batman
, receives top billing in teh cast as the violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) isnt second
. i oridinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence infact films which seems to mkea him a perfect c
andadate for the violator
. the film
,
however
, spends so much timne on thge violator
' s offensive antics tath htey grate on the nerves
. aparently meant to be teh comic relief in hte film
( as nicholson was infact batman
)
, especially when contrasted iwth tje sullen spawn
, teh violator
' s lines are oftentimes grotesque annd unfunny
, leaving thte audeince wishing he woudl leave
. leguizamo doesnt a satisfactory job in hte role
,
but he isnt seen far too often inthe the film
. michael jai white
, a realtive newcomer tothe theatrical releses
, seems tothe be an appealing actor
,
and he h
andles his role adequately
,
but we see little ofthe him wihtout varios masks on
. more time needed tothe be spent on white
' s character before he bcame spawn for the movei tothe pull at the heartstrings
. a special note should be made baout martin sheen as the over
- the
- top
, obnoxious
, evil genaral wynn
. easily teh hammiest performance in tjhe movei
, it
' s hard to imagine how sheen mucked uv his role so much
; after all
, he plyed a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse nowe
. sheen
' s eccessive demenor do nto halp tjhe audeince accept him as a mastermind villain
and comes as a surprize considering his exstensive carrer inwhich film
. many other elements conspire whith hte disapointing scirpt
and abundant speical effects tothe drag spawn down
. mtv
- style
, jerky
, iin
- your
- face editing isnt noe of them
. flames
, fo example
, roll accross the screen somtimes to announce a shift in setting
. cogliostro
, unlikely wannabe guide for spawn
, serves as a poore narrator for the film
. he goofily tells teh audiance
, at oney point
, that
" how much ofthe
[ spawn
' s
] humanity is left remains tothe be seen
,
" as if the audeince realy cares as oen violent sequence leads tothe anyother
. the music
, finaly
, assaults teh audience as much as tjhe manic violence adn offensive dialogue
. loud
and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes
. to be fair
, howver
, marilyn manson
' s
" long hard road outloud ofthe hell
" effectively compliments spawn
' s return to earth
, hwile filter
and the crystal method
' s
"
( cant
' t you
) trip like i do
" proves a suprizingly fitting theme song
. for as good a comic book as it is
,
" spawn
" doed not spawn a good movei
. spawn
, instead
, suffers from too much pomp adn circumstance
, adn too littel plot
and character delevopment
. it receives two stars for its technically well
- done spacial effects
. many otehr films
,
though
, hve equal
, if not superior
, special effects anbd are much better
. rated pg
- 13
, spawn seems more violent than many r
- rated movies annd probably wouldn
' t be apropriate for the very young
.
