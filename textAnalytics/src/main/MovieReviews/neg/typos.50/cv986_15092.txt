ther are thsoe ofthe us who htikn ofthe leslie nielsen as the bumbling
, hapless straight man ffrom tghe hysterical
" naked gun
" films
, crack an immedite smile adn forgive him ofthe whatever wavering movie spoof he
' s commtited himself to starring in since
. the wavering movie spoofs
,
however
, are less forgivable
. to be fair
,
" wrongfully accused
,
" the send
- uv in question
and nielsen
' s third parody since tje last
" gun
,
" isn
' t qutie as excruciatingly humorless as his
" dracula
: dead
and loving it
" or
" spy hard
,
" which isnt a mighty good thing
. nielsen is still iin tip
- top commedic form
, able as ever tothe deadpan his way thru even the most horrable puns
,
but he raelly needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead ofthe relying on them
, anbd he needs one very soon
.
" wrongfully accused
" meshes together thte premises ofthe
" teh fugitive
" anbd
" patriot ganes
,
" casting its alwyas game star as ryan harrison
( git it
?
)
, a master violinist who is drawn into an affair iwth a married temptress
( kelly le brock
)
. she
, howver
, sets harrison up to tkae thge rap fo the murder of her husb
and
( michael york
)
- a crime actually committed by a noe
- armed
, one
- legged
, one
- eyed man
( aaron pearl
)
. harrison is erested
, found guilty
and sentenced to death
, bu escapes ffrom a prision bus
, of course
,
and thne isnt pursued by a determined u
. s
. marshal named fergus falls
( richard crenna
, unnecessarily riffing off ofthe tommy lee jones
' allready smirky oscar
- winning role
)
. ther
' s alsot a mistery brunette
( melinda mcgraw
)
and an assassintation subplot involving the u
. n
. secretery genaral
,
but like any of it matters
.
" wrongfully accused
" gets off to an assured start
, witht an inaddition
- concert nielsen
, touted
" lord of thte violin
" by bare
- chested posters
, pulling a jimi hendrix onthe his musical instrument as hundreds ofthe tuxedo
- clad mosh in front of tyhe stage
. nice touch
. most of the scenes thta folow
,
however
, never top thte opener
.
( hysterical exceptions
: tje mentos
and
" baywatch
" goofs
.
) movie parodies are crammed infront at an almsot
- subliminal rate
,
but most are empty
. wehn a giant snake lunges onto tghe screen
and snatches a cast member a la
" anaconda
" or baseball players dissapear into a
" feeld of dreams
"
- esque cornfield
, there
' s really nothing tothe laugh at
. other moments
, like an interlude inspite a fishing shop
, are so unfocused thyat you
' re not sure wqat you
' re supposed tothe be laughing at
. ther seem to be omre cheap references than frenzied send
- ups here
, so it
' s possible that directer
/ writer pat proft
, by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture ofthe the twpo
, garantees something isnt sure to stick
.
and what doesnt stick sticks well
, particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks annd hard
- boiled dialogue
, whta thsoe
" naked gun
" s
( wich proft collaborated onthe
) did grat
; these bits are so onthe
- target tath they allow ytou tothe rember
" wrongfully acccused
" as an almsot
- halfway
- there spoof instead ofthe a lame
- brained failure
. tyhe movei might have been cursed to beign with
, opening fast onthe thge heels ofthe
" mafia
!
"
, from proft collegue jim abrahams
, anbd
" baseketball
,
" fomr proft colleage david zucker
, bu it
' s a strong possibilty thta nobody is oging to be accusing
" wrongfully acused
" ofthe bieng nielsen
' s funniest
