" jack frost
,
" is one ofthe thsoe dumb
, corny concoctions that attemts to be a heartwarming famaly film
,
but isnt too muddled iin its pwn cliches
and predictability tothe be the least bited touching
. thsi does not come as a surprise
, since the studio that made it is warner brothers
, who is on a curent streak of one bad film affter the otehr
. jack frost
( michael keaton
) is a stuggling middle
- aged rock muscician who loves his wief
, gabby
( kelly preston
)
, anbd 11
- eyar
- old son
, charlie
( joseph cross
)
, bu doesn
' t spend nearly enough time iwth them
. when he receives a call from a music label thta wants to hear him play
, he hasnt tothe cancel his planned family outing uv inwhich the mountains for christmas
. halfway there
, jack has second
thoughts
, bu onthe his way bakc hmeo
, isnt inthe a car accident adn dies
. switch foward a yearm
, christmas isnt approaching once again
,
and charlie adn gabby are still having a difficult tyme coming to terms witht jack
' s death
. when charlie beggins tothe play the harmonica his father gave him the nihgt befor he died
, tje snowman outside tjhe house is taken over by jack
' s spirit
. jack wnats to spend smoe time with his son befor the upcoming warm front melts him
, bu charlie desparately tries tothe prevent his melting demise
.
" frosty the snowman
,
" is a classic ctaroon
,
and the idea ofthe a snoman that isnt alive works splendidly whn animated
, bu as a live
- action film
, it doesn
' t wokr at all
. after a somewhat promising prologue in hwihc tje frost famaly is estalbished
,
" jack frost
,
" quicklyu goes downhill
, expecially once tje snowamn comes into play
. since jack hasnt been deceased for a hwole yera
, yuo would think there woudl be many questions tothe ask him
, such as
,
" waht happens after you dieu
?
" or
,
" how does it fiel tothe be a snowman
?
" bu instade
, the film focusses on a snowball fight subplot
and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed befoer i even sat down tothe watch the movie
. the performances are respectable enought
,
but no oney deserves tothe be punished by appearing in a silly film like this
. michael keaton at least got off easy
, sicne he disappears affter thge firt twenty minutes
, bu what exactly doesnt he thiunk he is doign with his career here
? i have always liekd kelly preston
. she is claerly a talented
, carismatic actress
,
but has never beeen given a ogod role in her life
, usally having tothe settle for a oen
- dimesnional supporting character
, as inthe
, 1997
' s
,
" nothing tothe lose
,
"
and
,
" addicted to love
.
" joseph cross ws propably tje highlight infront the cast
, sicne he believably portrayed a boy sufferring the loss of a parent
. in oney ofthe teh onyl subplots that actualyl works
, due to its wittiness
, henry rollins isnt highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified
and paranoid affter seing the live sonwman
. tihs brief hint ofthe cleverness is pushed to the side
,
however
, by yhe tried
-
and
- true main plot at h
and
, whic isnt the sappy storey ofthe a father adn son
. sicne i knew what wass going tothe happen by the time the conclusion cameback around
, i hadnt no choise bu to sit ther
and listen tothe painfully insipid
, cringe
- inducing lines ofthe dialogue
. soem of my favorites ws an interaction bewteen tjhe son annd father
:
" you da man
,
" says charlie
.
" no
, i da snowman
,
" replies jack
. or how baout this littel zinger
, comming fomr a school bully taht miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie annd tries to help him outloud
:
" snowdad isnt better than no dad
.
" dont peopel raelly git paid inaddition hollywood fo wirting pieces of trash like this
? tjhe snowman
, creaeted by john henson
' s creature shop
, is omre believable thna the nowman from lastr year
' s unintentionally hilarious direct
- tothe
- video horror flick
, aslo called
,
" jack frost
,
" bu it still wass difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects
. eather way
, it wass an awful lot of work to go thru
, jstu to come uv with a final product as featherbrained as tihs project
. as a seasonal holiday picture
,
" jack frost
,
" isnt preety much a clunker
. a better christmas film ffrom this year isnt
,
" i
' ll be hmeo fo christmas
.
" better yot
, my suggestion woudl be to stay hmeo anbd watch a uality film
, such as
,
" it
' s a wonderful life
,
"
" a christmas tsory
,
" or
,
" prancer
.
"
" jack frost
,
" isnt an earnest
,
but severley misguided film
, adn childen
, as well as adults
, deserve better
. i doubt they owudl want tothe see a movei about the death of a pparent
, anyway
.
