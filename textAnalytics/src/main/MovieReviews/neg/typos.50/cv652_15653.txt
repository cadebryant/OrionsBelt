" jack frost
,
" isnt noe ofthe thsoe dumb
, corny concoctions thyat attemts to be a heartwarming famaly film
,
bu isnt too muddled in its pwn cliches
adn predictability tothe be the least bit touching
. this does nto come as a surprise
, since hte studio that made it isnt warner brothers
, who is on a current streak of one bad film after the otehr
. jack frost
( michael keaton
) is a stuggling middle
- aged rock musician who loves his wife
, gabby
( kelly preston
)
,
annd 11
- yearm
- old son
, charlie
( jospeh cross
)
,
but doesn ' t spend nearly enought timne with them
. whn he recieves a call ffrom a music lable thyat wants tothe hear him play
, he hasnt tothe cancel his planned family outing up infront tyhe montains fo christmas
. halfway htere
, jack hasnt second thoughts
,
bu on his way bcak home
, is infront a car accident
annd dies
. switch foward a year
, christmas is approaching once again
,
and charlie
adn gabby are still haveing a difficult tyme comming tothe terms iwth jack ' s death
. when charlie beggins tothe play the harmonica his father gave him the ngiht befoer he died
, tghe snowman outside tjhe house is taken over by jack ' s spirit
. jack wants to spend some tiome wih his son befor tjhe upcomming warm front melts him
,
bu charlie desperately tries tothe prevent his melting demise
.
" frosty the snowman
,
" isnt a clasic ctaroon
,
adn tje idae ofthe a snwoman that isnt alive works splendidly whn animated
,
bu as a live
- acation film
, it doesn ' t work at all
. after a somewhat promising prologue in hwihc the frost family isnt estalbished
,
" jack frost
,
" quicklyu goes downhill
, expecially once tghe snowman comes into play
. since jack hasnt been deceased forthe a hwole yera
, ytou would think ther would be many questions to ask him
, such as
,
" what happens after ytou dieu
?
" or
,
" how does it efel tothe be a nsowman
?
"
bu instead
, thge film focuses onthe a snowball fight subplot
and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch thge movie
. tghe performances are respectable anough
,
but no one deserves to be punished by appearing infront a silly film liuke this
. michael keaton at least got off eazy
, since he disappears after hte first twenty minutes
,
but what exactly does he think he is doing whith his carrer here
? i have alwyas liekd kelly preston
. she isnt clearly a talented
, charismatic actress
,
but has never been given a good role infact her life
, usually having to suttle fo a one
- dimesnional supporting character
, as inaddition
, 1997 ' s
,
" nothing to loose
,
"
and
,
" addicted to lveo
.
" jospeh cross ws probablly the highlight in the cast
, usance he believably potrayed a boy suffering the loss of a pparent
. iin one ofthe hte only subplots that actually works
, due tothe its wittiness
, henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified
adn paranoid affter seing the live snowman
. this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side
,
however
, by tghe tryed
-
and
- true main plot at hand
, which isnt hte sappy stry ofthe a father
adn son
. since i knew what was oging to appen by the tiem the conclusion cameback arund
, i had no choice
bu tothe sit htere
annd listen tothe painfully insipid
, cringe
- inducing lines ofthe dialogue
. some ofthe my favorites ws an interaction beween hte son
and father
:
" you da man
,
" syas charlie
.
" no
, i da snowman
,
" replies jack
. or how about tihs littel zinger
, comming fomr a skool bully thgat miraculously becomes friendly towords charlie
and trys tothe help him outloud
:
" snowdad is better than noone dad
.
" dont people raelly get paid inspite hollywood fo writing pieces of trash liek this
? thte snowman
, creaeted by john henson ' s creature shop
, is moreso believable tahn the snowman ffrom last eyar ' s unintentionally hillarious direct
- tothe
- video horror flick
, also called
,
" jack frost
,
"
but it still ws difficult to tell if it wass a person inwhich a suit or coputer effects
. either way
, it was an awful lot ofthe work to go through
, just tothe come uv wiht a fianl product as featherbrained as this project
. as a seasonal holiday picture
,
" jack frost
,
" isnt preety much a clunker
. a better christmas film ffrom this year isnt
,
" i ' ll be home for christmas
.
" better
yot
, my suggestion woudl be tothe stay home
and watch a uqality film
, such as
,
" it ' s a wonderful life
,
"
" a christmas stopry
,
" or
,
" prancer
.
"
" jack frost
,
" isnt an earnest
,
but severly misguided film
,
adn children
, as well as adults
, deserve better
. i dout they would want tothe see a movie baout the death ofthe a parent
, anyway
.
