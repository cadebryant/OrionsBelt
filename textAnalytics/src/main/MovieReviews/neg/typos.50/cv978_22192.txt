anna
and tghe king isnt at least the fouth film adaptions ofthe margaret landon ' s fact based novel the king
annd i
,
adn it ' s big
, expensive
adn soulless
.
though ogod
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes
anbd luscious cinematography can dont little tothe compensate for thge emotional wasteland tath is peter krikes
and steve meerson ' s scirpt
. so much mney ws spent on pretty picturesk that they forgot tothe atually mkea the movie interesting
. tihs isnt jodie foster ' s firt movei sicne thte jaw
- droppingly brilliant contact came out omre than two years ago
and it isn ' t thte best choice to sohw off her acting chops
. she ' s trapped in the stoic role ofthe anna leonowens
, hte uptight
, widowed brittish schoolteacher who comes tothe siam
( nowe thailand
) with her son tothe instruct teh king ' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son in thge ways of thte west
( becasue
" the ways ofthe england are teh ways of the world
)
. the king likes her so much he puts her infront charge of educating tje hwole royal family
( 58 kids withthe 10 more inthe thge way
; impressive
, no
?
)
. tyhe eldest prince is none too happy baout this
(
" father
, have i offended you in smoe way
? why do yuo punish me with imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
,
bu soon gets to know anna
anbd her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- you personality better
and comes to like her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack fomr the neighboring british colony of burma
. yhe king
anbd his close advisors suspect that tihs is britian ' s donig wich arouses suspision inwhich siam
, puting anna infront an uncomfortable position
. she isnt not sure what to amking of htis
and seems to herself suspect brittish involvement in the crisis
bu works to diffuse tyhe king ' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, cant ' t help
but be influenced by the eloquent anna
annd they slowy
, quitely
, develope affections fo eahc otehr
. there isnt a scene in the middle ofthe anna
annd the king where one ofthe the king ' s yuonger daughters dies
. it ' s your classic deathbed scene
, wtih the girl ' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who trys onyl semi
- sucessfuly to manetain his composure
. anna
hten comes in
anbd cries a bit
. the sequence was htere fo a purpose
: to evoke a storng emotional response from tghe viewer
. i ' m usally a sucker for such scenes
and
yot this tyme
, i wass jsut sitting there
, my emotions untouched
. this remains true thru all ofthe thge movie which rimaniss emotionally barren
. we never develope connections tothe yhe characters
; never given a reason tothe care
. htis ludicrously long epic ws directed by andy tennant
, whose lsat film was ever aftter
, one of my favorites of 1998
. i do nto dout tennant ' s ability tothe put together a decent movei
,
but anna
annd the king
, aside ffrom being psychologically inept isnt also technologically deficient
. teh sets
annd scenery are gorgeous
,
but tghe camerawork doens nothing tothe convey its grandeur
. even terrence malick managed to do more with flora
adn fauna iin his otherwise absmal the thin red line thna tennant cin muster ffrom
$ 75 million worth ofthe props
annd a shoot inaddition malaysia
. we feel like hte camera isnt resticted tothe its immediate point of veiw
; there are noone wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us iwth larger
- tahn
- life awe
. i liekd both foster
anbd yun
- fat
, who give intertaining if nto terribly involving performances in the two lead roles
. foster ' s generally stoic persona serves her well here
, as she is playing a reserved
, formall
and rather underdeveloped chracter
. yun
- fat isnt especially effective
, perfectly conveying teh king ofthe siam ' s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts
. waht doesnt anna
and the king in is its inability to involve thge viewer in its characters
anbd situations
. the casted is gerat
, the directer isnt talented
,
adn tjhe budget is lavish
,
but this ill
- advisd remake of yhe clasic rogers
and hammerstein movie isnt unable tothe utilize any of thsoe things to form a compelling whole
. htis isnt an emotionless costume epic
.
