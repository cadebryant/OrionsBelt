anna
and tjhe king isnt at least tje fouth film adaption of margaret l
andon
' s fatc based novel tghe king anbd i
, adn it
' s big
, expensive anbd soulless
.
though ogod
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes annd luscious cinematography cin do little to compensate for tghe emotional wastel
and taht is peter krikes annd steve meerson
' s scirpt
. so much monay was spended on pretty pictures that tehy forgot to acutally make the movie intresting
. htis is jodie foster
' s first movei sicne the jaw
- droppingly brilliant contact came outloud more thna two years ago anbd it isn
' t the best choice to sohw off her acting chops
. she
' s trapped inaddition hte stoic role of anna leonowens
, hte uptight
, widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam
( nowe thail
and
) with her son to instruct thge king
' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son inthe tje ways ofthe the west
( because
" teh ways ofthe engl
and are the ways of thte world
)
. the king likes her so much he puts her in charge ofthe educating hte wohle royal family
( 58 kids wtih 10 moreso infront the way
; impressive
, noone
?
)
. tghe eldest prince is none too happy baout this
(
" father
, have i offended you in some way
? why do ytou panish me with imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
,
but soon gets tothe know anna
and her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- ytou personality better
and comes to liek her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack from the neighboring brittish colony of burma
. tje king
and his close advisors suspect tath tihs isnt brittain
' s doing whcih arouses suspicion inwhich siam
, puting anna in an uncomfortable position
. she isnt nto sure what to mkae of thsi
and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis bu works tothe diffuse the king
' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, can
' t halp bu be influented by tghe eloquent anna anbd tehy slowy
, quitely
, develop affections fo earch other
. there isnt a scene inaddition tjhe middle ofthe anna annd teh king where one ofthe the king
' s yuonger daughters dies
. it
' s your classic deathbed scene
, wiht tje girl
' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who tries onyl semi
- successfully tothe maintain his composure
. anna hten comes in
and cries a bited
. yhe sequence was there forthe a purpose
: tothe evoke a storng emotional reponse from hte viewer
. i
' m usually a sucker for such scenes
and yot thsi time
, i wass just sitting ther
, my emotions untouched
. htis remains true through all of tyhe movei hwihc rimaniss emotionally barren
. we never deveop connections tothe hte charactors
; never given a reason tothe care
. this ludicrously long epic wass directed by
andy tennant
, whose last film ws ever after
, oen ofthe my favorites ofthe 1998
. i dont nto dout tennant
' s ablity to put toghether a decent movie
,
but anna
and teh king
, aside ffrom being psychologically inept isnt also technologically deficient
. tyhe sets
and scenery are gorgeous
, bu the camerawork doesnt nothing tothe convey its gr
andeur
. even terrence malick managed tothe dont omre witht flora
and fauna in his otherwise abysmla teh thin red line than tennant cxan muster ffrom
$ 75 millon worth ofthe props adn a shoot inaddition malaysia
. we feel liuke the camera is restricted to its immediate point ofthe view
; ther are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger
- than
- life awe
. i liekd both foster
and yun
- fat
, who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances inaddition tyhe twpo lead roles
. foster
' s generally stoic persona serves her well here
, as she is playing a reserved
, formall adn rather underdeveloped charachter
. yun
- fat is especially effective
, perfectly conveying the king of siam
' s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts
. wqat doesnt anna adn tyhe king in isnt its inability to envolve tjhe viewer inwhich its characters anbd situations
. tyhe casted is great
, thge directer isnt talented
,
and teh budget isnt lavish
,
but tihs ill
- advisd remake of tjhe clasic rogers
and hammerstein movie isnt unable tothe utilize any ofthe those thigsn tothe form a compelling wohle
. thsi is an emotionless costume epic
.
