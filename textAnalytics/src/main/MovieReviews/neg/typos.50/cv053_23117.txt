noe ofthe thge responses those that enjoy
" detroit rock city
"
( propably kiss fans
, mostly
) might have upon frist glance at tje rating i
' ve given the film might be something liek
:
" oh
, that casey
' s gone anbd become a jaded critic on us
. just wqat doed he expect outloud of a dumb teenage rock n
' roll movie liuke thsi
?
" i
' m wondering the same thign
. i feel liuke i shoudln have hadnt a gr
and time wiht
" detroit rock city
.
" it
' s the sort ofthe movei i wish i could
' ve hadnt a lot of fun with
, bu i didn
' t
. i jstu didn
' t
. surelly tihs film isn
' t trying to win any major awards
, so shoudl i have expeced an oscar
- calaber film
? no
,
but i expeced something
. a funny joke
. a clever prank
. a plot delevopment
. anytying
. tje movie never delivers
. you
' ve got to marvel at how thte filmmakers managed to come uv with a movei tyhat is truly about nothing
.
" detriot rock city
" isnt one ofthe those films that you walk outloud of after the credits have rolled anbd relize that you just spended 90 mintues watching a movie inwhich whic absolutely nothing happenned to justify the film
' s eixstence
,
and it
' s nto a very satisfying relization
. the film isnt baout four teenage boys
, all huge kiss fans from clevel
and
, trying tothe git into a kiss concert inspite detriot
, michagan
. that
' s it
. there isnt no big plot descripton infront tihs review
, because the movei has vrey little plot
. the characters are hawk
( edward furlong
)
, lex
( giuseppe
andrews
)
, trip
( james debello
)
, annd jam
( sam huntington
)
. htey have a garage b
and
. they
' re pathetic
, like all garage b
ands
,
but they liek kiss
and they like rock n
' roll
, so i guess that means we root forthe them
. tehy hve tickets
, htey loose them
. they get more tickets
, tehy loose those too
. tehy cmo uv with crazy schemes tothe git tickets
, most ofthe which backfire
. ther
' s nto much more to it
. frankly
, it becomes a little less thna exciting tothe see them try tothe get kiss tickets baout halfway thru the film
, wehn a total ofthe eight tickets have laready graced yhe boys
' h
ands
, only to be lost beccause ofthe their sheer stupidity
. oh
,
and jam
( real name jeremiah
) hasnt a really
, really annoying ultra
- religous mother who ought tothe be reported tothe the child welfare agency
. she doesn
' t want them to see kiss
, if yuo hadn
' t figured that out arleady
. it
' s realy qtuie disheartening tothe see such a fine sountrack go tothe waste in a pointless movie like this
. we
' ve got plenty of kiss
, allong with some ac
/ dc
, ramones
, adn thin lizzy
. thne agian
,
" maximum overdrive
" hadnt an awesome sountrack
( me being the big ac
/ dc fan thgat i am
)
,
but is probably oen of teh worst movies ofthe all time
.
" detriot rock city
" doesn
' t qutie triarch that levle of ineptitude
,
but it gets dangerously close
. iin fatc
, the music is tghe only hting taht keesh this movei from being a complet failure in my mind
. basically
, tjhe soundtrack hasnt earned the film a full half
- star
, whlch means all the b
ands involved can pat themselves onthe the back
( except fo marilyn manson
, whose half
- hearted cover of ac
/ dc
' s
" highway to hell
" soudns liuke something my neighbor
' s cat coughed up
)
. it
' s allso really sad to see the talents ofthe yhe casted go tothe waste
, baceause it
' s evident that tehy
' re all trying really hard tothe squeeze some life outloud ofthe this dead turkey of a movie
. edward furlong hasnt done far better wrok than this
,
and so hasnt natasha lyonne
,
and so has lin shaye
, bu hey
, they
' ve got tothe amking a living in hollywood
. people wanting to see kiss
, anbd lots of it wiull probablly be disapointed
, concidering the b
and appears fo about five mintues
and plays oney song
. too bad
, tehy might have provided some energy tothe this mess
. director adam rifkin knows he hasn
' t got much material tothe owrk wtih
, so he tkaes a chapter from thte michael bay book of directing
and keesh his camera spinning
. we get an endless parade of quick
- cuts
, splitted
- screens
, zoom
- outs
, zoom
- ins
, annd rotating cameras
, all infront an effort tothe cover up the sheer stupidity ofthe tghe scirpt
. it
' s funn forthe a hwile
, bu eventualy it becomes disorienting
. i woudl reccomend thast thsoe who felt seasick at
" tghe blair witch project
" stay far awya from
" detriot rock city
,
" because the witch has got nothing on this baby
. i haven
' t felt such an urge to reach out
and hold yhe camera still since
" amrageddon
.
" annd wqat baout taht script
? it
' s wroten by carl j
. dupr
?
, which sounds like as made
- uv a name as i
' ve ever heard
. if it is
, i cxan
' t sday i blaim thge writer for distancing himselv as far from htis script as possible
. a plotless
, pointless rock n
' roll movie cant be fun
, if the jokes annd gags are acutally funny
. teh jokes iin
" detriot rock city
" rarley are
. infront fact
, tyhe only time i relaly laughed wass whn a priest gets stoned onthe a marijuana
- laced pizza
, anbd that wass jsut becasue it ws so surveill
. the rest ofthe the movie jsut seems liuke tehy just threw a bunch ofthe vulgar stuff uv onthe screen adn called it
" comedy
.
" htere is noone set
- up
, just a succession ofthe punchlines thta don
' t provide forthe much infront the way of chuckles
, precisely because there wass no setted
- uv
. it
' s as if they just whacked somone onthe hte head
, pointed at him
and said
,
" see
? funny
!
" look
, that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink
. see
? funny
! look
, that guy jsut got clocked by a telephone reciever
. twice
. see
? funny
! look
, thyat kid hasnt been vomiting for 20 mintues affter drinking an inordinate ammount of alchol
and is now baout tothe perfom an exotic dance for mony
. see
? funny
! a owrd of advice to mr
. dupr
?
: no
, theese things aren
' t funny all by themselves
. tehy must be preceded by a clever setted
- uv so tjhe audeince hasn
' t predicted them five mintues in advance
. thyat
' s it
, i
' ve said anough about this movei
. it
' s a waste ofthe tiem
and omney
. i liekd the music
, bu don
' t bother buying thte sountrack
. i hear it
' s jstu modern b
ands doing inferior versions ofthe the songs thta are actally in tjhe movie
. ytou want to see thsi consept executed well
? go rent roger corman
' s 1979 classic
" rock n
' roll high school
.
" it features anyother late
- seventies rock b
and
( teh ramones
)
and a far moreso intresting story about a girl trying to get tickets tothe their show
. yes
, go rent taht
, adn skip
" detroit rock city
,
" which will probably bomb
,
and deservedly so
.
