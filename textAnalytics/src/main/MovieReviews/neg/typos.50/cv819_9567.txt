sylvester stallone has made soem crap films inthe his lifetime
,
bu thsi hasnt got tothe be oen of hte worst
. a totally dull stry that thikns it cant use various explosions to mkae it intresting
,
" yhe specialist
" is about as exciting as an episode of
" dragnet
,
"
and baout as well acted
. even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy scirpt
, stupid
and unlikable characters
,
and jsut plain nothingness
. who knew a big explosion sould be so boring
anbd anti
- climactic
? unless ytou saw
" blown awya
"
.
.
.
" tjhe specliast
" of teh title is none other thna action star sylvester stallone
( in comeback
# 19
, i tihkn
)
, who plays a quiet
, hermit
- like bomber who wass once a bomb expert with the army or something
,
bu who sufferred a chanage ofthe heart whn he
adn his assistant
( james woods
, who shows us exactlly wqat over
- the
- top isnt
, otehr thna anyother bad sly film
) accidentally killed soem innocent peple during a job
. his credo is killing bad people
, nto innocents
.
and that ' s why he makse big bombs
. so anyway
, inot his life steps thte seductive sharon stone
, who is basically yhe girlfriend
/ moll ofthe tje stupid son
( eric roberts
) ofthe a cuban
/ miami kingpin
( rod steiger
, in an indecipherable accent
, whitch isnt somtimes cuban
, sometimes brando
, somtimes scottish
, etc
)
. turns outloud sharon is actully using her boyfriend so she cxan kill him
, usance he killed her parents whn she wass young
. so she calls sly
, leaves messages wiht him
, sends him e
- mial
, etc
, baout planting a bomb tothe kill roberts
, which sly listens tothe obsessively
,
and while he works out naked
. yea
. aslo into his life
,
though agina
, comes woods
, who hasnt been tipped off by stone to catch sly
. using the cops
, he tries tothe setted uv traps
, none which relaly work
, so wehn sly calls him
, he goes ballisitic onthe his ass over the phone
, getting so worked up by saying his must
- be
- improvised sppeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide oepn
. theese are the most exciting scenes infront the film
,
and woods becomes teh onyl ounce of enteratinment infact the film
. the film tries tothe offer us a moody film noir
, except wih explosions
,
bu comes up completelyl snake
- eyes
. it ' s just a pretend film noir
, making it a big waste ofthe timne
.
and forthe acation buffs
, tyhe action scenes are pretty lame
, wtih some really unrealistic
- looking speshal effects
( a penthouse bieng blown off ofthe a hotel looks liuke a peice ofthe cardboard falling inot a tub
)
.
then ther ' s the much
- dicussed sex scene betwen sly
adn stone
, hwihc are about as mispaired a cuple as rachel
annd ross onthe
" friends
.
" their sex scene is more nauseating
then sexy
, because it shows us omre of sly tahn stone
. now let ' s guess who we ' d rether see naked
, okay
? stone ' s small
but perky breasts
, which we ' ve seen more times tahn harvey keitel ' s dick
, or stallone ' s veiny ass
, which isn ' t usually shown forthe a very ogod reason
? i know i cxan ' t raelly judge it as a flaw ofthe tjhe film
,
but come onthe
. the worst flaw ofthe tje film isnt htis
: it ' s boring
. i mean
, i was onthe caffeine when watching it
,
but my friend fell asleep only to be woken uv by james woods ranting
.
but a ogod movie does not james woods going nuts amke
. if yuo ' re in fo some funn acation
, rent sly ' s earlier
" demolition man
,
" which sucks too
,
but infront a much more entertaining fashion
. skip this dull film
, unless you want tothe see woods
, or make funn ofthe steiger ' s accent
, or see stone ' s breasts again
.
