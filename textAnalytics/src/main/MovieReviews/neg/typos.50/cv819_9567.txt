sylvester stallone hasnt made soem crap films in his lifetime
, bu this hasnt got tothe be oen ofthe the worst
. a totally dull stroy thta thikns it cxan uise varios explosions to make it interesting
,
" hte specialist
" isnt about as exciting as an episode of
" dragnet
,
"
and baout as well acted
. even smoe attemts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy scirpt
, stupid adn unlikable charactors
,
and just plain nothingness
. who knew a big explosion coudl be so boring adn anti
- climactic
? unless yuo saw
" blown away
"
.
.
.
" tje specliast
" of thte title isnt none other than action star sylvester stallone
( in comback
# 19
, i thiunk
)
, who plays a quiet
, hermit
- like bomber who was once a bomb expert wtih the army or something
,
but who sufferred a chanage ofthe heart when he
and his assitant
( james woods
, who shows us exactly what over
- tyhe
- top isnt
, other thna another bad sly film
) accidentally killed some innocent peopel during a job
. his credo is killing bad people
, nto innocents
. adn tht
' s why he mkaes big bombs
. so anyway
, into his life steps tjhe seductive sharon stone
, who is basicaly the girlfriend
/ moll of yhe stupid son
( eric roberts
) of a cuban
/ miami kingpin
( rod steiger
, infact an indecipherable accent
, which isnt somtimes cuban
, sometimes br
ando
, somtimes scottish
, etc
)
. turns outloud sharon is actualyl useing her boyfriend so she can kill him
, sicne he killed her parents when she was young
. so she calls sly
, leaves messages with him
, sends him e
- mial
, etc
, about planting a bomb tothe kill roberts
, which sly listens tothe obsessively
,
and while he works out naked
. yea
. also inot his life
,
though agian
, comes woods
, who has beeen tipped off by stone to catch sly
. using the cops
, he tries tothe set up traps
, none whlch really work
, so when sly calls him
, he goes ballisitic onthe his ass over hte phone
, getting so worked uv by saying his must
- be
- improvised speeches tath he seems tothe pop thge veign in his head wide open
. these are hte most exicting scenes in the film
, annd woods becomes teh only ounce ofthe entertainment infront tjhe film
. the film tries to offer us a moody film noir
, except with explosions
, bu comes uv completely snake
- eyes
. it
' s jsut a pretend film noir
, makeing it a big waste ofthe time
. annd for action buffs
, teh action scenes are preety lame
, iwth smoe relaly unrealistic
- looking special effects
( a penthouse bieng blown off of a hotel looks like a peice of cardboard falling into a tub
)
. thne there
' s the much
- dicussed sex scene bewteen sly adn stone
, which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel
and ross on
" friends
.
" their sex scene isnt moreso nauseating
then sexy
, beccause it shows us mroe ofthe sly than stone
. now let
' s guess who we
' d rether see naked
, okay
? stone
' s small
but perky breasts
, whcih we
' ve seen moreso times tahn harvey keitel
' s dick
, or stallone
' s veiny ass
, which isn
' t usually shown for a very ogod reason
? i know i cxan
' t really judge it as a flaw of the film
,
but cmo on
. the worst flwa ofthe the film is tihs
: it
' s boring
. i mean
, i wass on caffeine when watching it
,
but my firend fell asleep onyl tothe be woken up by james woods ranting
.
but a ogod movei doens nto james woods going nuts mkea
. if you
' re inaddition forthe some fun acation
, rent sly
' s ealier
" demolision man
,
" which sucks too
, bu in a much moreso intertaining fashon
. skip this dull film
, unless you want to see woods
, or make fun of steiger
' s accent
, or see stone
' s breasts again
.
