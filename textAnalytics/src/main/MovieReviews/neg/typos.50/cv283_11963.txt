. only the extremely avid blues fans shoudln attempt getting thru these two horus
. forthe those people
, it may be worth it
, fo luckily there isnt much omre music tahn shoddy attemts at acting
,
but when tje stoy doens intrude apon thge festivities
, the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes
, muscicians turned stiff actors

and teh pointless 10

. apperances by musical legends such as aretha franklin
, james brown
, eric clapton
, adn a hwole slew of others are yhe high points ofthe the film
,
but htey also confirm why these peple are musicians annd not actors
. blues brothers 2000 isnt deserving ofthe oen hwole star simply because if you realy
, really love this kind of music
, yuo might kind ofthe

. many

and if you don
' t hve a passion for very deep blues

. much ofthe tihs film seems nothing omre tahn aykroyd

, bu no marter how much funn aykroyd may be hvaing with htis
, none of the excitement isnt pasted onthe tothe thge audience
.
and seing three guys in threee
- piece suits goofily dancing arround with poker faces can onyl be funny for so long
. unfortunately
, those twpo seconds are over about fifteen minutes inot thge film
