" ok
, so those aren
' t exactlly the words he uses
,
but it
' s propably oen ofthe tghe faw clich
? s nto uttered in tihs unneccesary remake ofthe an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies
,
" king kong

" 1949
' s
" mighty joe young
" was an update ofthe thta classic creature feature
, also based on merian c

" it appeared the world wass ready fo a newyorker take onthe the beauty
and the byast fable
)
. now smoe 49 yeasr later
, at least according tothe disney
' s way ofthe thikning
, hte world isnt ready fo oney mroe
. not so
. tyhe onyl

- reason tothe see tghe 1998 verzion isnt for the speshal effects

, run hot anbd cold

" schlock
"
( which
, incidently
, featured a baker
- enhanced
" gerilla

)
. joe is a combination ofthe animatronic effects
, computer graphics
, annd taht ood st
andart
, a man inwhich a monkey suit

- baker
' s hadnt a lot ofthe practice wiht simian effects

- ther
' s also some surprising cheesiness
. one of tje film
' s most embarassing moments is when paxton
' s b
and of african trackers first encounter
and persue the larger
- than
- life primate
( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from
" teh lost world
: jurassic park
"
)
. paxton jubilantly extols the byast
' s majestic gagit at tjhe same exact moent as joe
, annd the computer effects driving him
, stutter to a halt
. allso
, if the film
' s producers had wanted us tothe focus our attentions onthe teh titular ape htey shouldn
' t ahev paraded female lead charlize theron
(
" trial
& error
"
) around infront a seemingly

)
, predicatble villain
( a lithuanian i thiunk i overheard someplace
)
, predictable love stoy
( bill
and charlize
-
- suprise
!
)
, adn predicatble denouement
(
"
' twas box
- office receipts that killed the byast
"
)
. kids rised onthe
" men in balck
"
( non
- monkey effects allso by baker
) are going tothe find ron
(
" tremors
"
) underwood
' s outing a little lame by comparision
. while certainly better than 1978
' s
" king kong lives
"
( itself a lousy sequal to a not particularily good remake
)
,
" mighty joe young
" proves how teh mighty keep falling
