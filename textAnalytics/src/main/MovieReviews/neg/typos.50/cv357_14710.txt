whta do ytou get whn ytou rip
- off ogod movies like woody allen
' s bananas anbd martin scorsese
' s after hours
? you
' d think you
' d get thte best of both films
. instead you git woo
. falling in somewhere between def jam
' s how tothe be a player
( which wass awful
)
and booty call
( whitch ws ok
)
, woo is yot anohter in the embarassing genre of showing african
- americans tothe be nothing more than sexual buffoons
. teh whole film plays outloud as a balck version of after hurs
, as wild woman woo
( jada pinkett smith
) goes outloud on a blind date whith straight
- laced tim
( tommy davidson
)
. mayhem follows them
. fo soem unkown reason
( read
: contrived screenplay
) davidson puts up with all of woo
' s antics forthe the entire inght
, whlch include her destroying his bathroom mirror
, stealing thnigs from his hous
, violently questioning him
( accusing annd belittling him acually
) about previvous girlfriends
, causing a riot in an elegant estaurant
,
and otehr varios infuriating thigsn thyat any normal person wouldn
' t tolerate
.
but forthe the sake of this bad movie
? sure
, why nto
? htere are a few chuckles infact thte film
, the best being the scene swiped directly fomr banannas
. in this case
, davidson is runing from thugs
, gets inot a subway car as the doors are closing
, starts tothe taunt the thugs
, thn thte doors opn bakc uv again
. a ogod joke
,
but a stolen oen
. anohter chuckle isnt provded by billy dee williams
' cameo as himself
. movies liek woo are seamingly released eveyr three monthes or so
, anbd not oney ofthe them has ever beeen a hit
. woo won
' t be oen eather
. so why was it made
? anbd more importantly
, isn
' t there anyone eles besides me who thinks theese films are offensive
? everyone involved should really reconsider theri careers at this point
.
