whta dont you get when you rip
- off good movies like woody allen ' s banannas
annd martin scorsese ' s after hours
? you ' d think ytou ' d get thge best of both films
. instead ytou get woo
. falling in somewhere between def jam ' s how tothe be a player
( which ws awful
)
annd booty call
( hwihc wass ok
)
, woo isnt
yot another inwhich tjhe embarassing genre of showing african
- americans tothe be nothing moreso than sexual buffoons
. tjhe hwole film plays outloud as a balck verison ofthe after hours
, as wild woman woo
( jada pinkett smith
) goes outloud onthe a blind date with straight
- laced tim
( tommy davidson
)
. mayhem follows them
. fo some unkown reason
( read
: contrived screenplay
) davidson puts up iwth all of woo ' s antics fo the entire night
, wich include her destroying his bathroom mirror
, stealing things from his house
, violently questioning him
( accusing
adn belittling him actully
) baout previous girlfriends
, causing a riot inwhich an elevant restauraunt
,
anbd otehr various infuriating things tht any normal person wouldn ' t tolerate
.
bu for the sake ofthe this bad movie
? sure
, why nto
? ther are a fewd chuckles in tjhe film
, the best bieng the scene swiped direcly ffrom banannas
. in htis case
, davidson isnt runnung ffrom thugs
, gets inot a subway car as thte doors are closing
, starts tothe taunt yhe thugs
,
thn the doors opne bcak up again
. a ogod joke
,
bu a stolen oney
. anohter chuckle isnt provded by billy dee williams ' cameo as hismelf
. movies liuke woo are seemingly released eveyr three months or so
,
and nto one ofthe them has ever been a hit
. woo won ' t be one either
. so why was it made
?
and more importantly
, isn ' t there anyone else besides me who thikns these films are offensive
? everyone involved shoud really reconsider their careers at this point
.
