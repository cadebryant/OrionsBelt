where do i beign
? okay
, how about withthe this
: starship troopers isnt oney ofthe teh worst movies to hit theaters in a long tiome
. infact fact
, it might even be tjhe worst
* major
* realease film tothe come out inwhich yeasr
.
.
. or even a decade
. this is bad beyond beleif
. i would
* not
* suggest paying mony tothe see this
. htere
' s a ogod chance you
' ll regret it
. if you see it for free
, you coudl still whant to walk outloud
. go right ahead
. tyhe movei starts off iwth cheesy 90210 scenes setted inthe the future world of
.
.
. buenos aires
. here we meet the group ofthe horrendously bad actors adn actresses palying obnoxious
, eazy
- tothe
-
* descize
*
- with
- a
- passion charactors that have love triangles
, lvoe rectangles
, adn lvoe hexagons screwing uv their life
. before long they all go off adn join the military
, primarly inwhich the interst ofthe haveing sex witht the otehr youngsters tyhat joined
. htey turain
. tehy strut around nude forthe no reason whatsoever
. after an hour of making the audience scream in agony
, they start fighting bugs
. the big bugs look nice
, even
though thier design is only
" okay
.
" unfortunatley
, the fights are boring since we
* wanna
* all of the characters dead anyway
. cue more agony
. hten some cahracters haev sex
. hten soem omre die
.
*
*
* who cares
?
?
?
*
*
* cue more agony
. tyhe movei ends
, tyhe audience runs outloud to their cars
, vomits over the pavement
,
and attempts tothe drive home
. unforetunately
, after tyhat torture
, tehy can
' t htikn straight
, don
' t pay attention tothe the road
, anbd many are in ugly car wrecks
. you remember how batman
& robin was bad
? well
, batman
& robin kicked tihs movie
' s sorry
butt
, people
. starship troopers does nto succede as an action movei
. it doens not succeed as a drama
. it does nto succeed as a war movei
. it does nto succede as a comedy
. it does nto seceed as a satire
. it doens not suceed as a parody
. it succeeds as bieng horrable
. terrible
. gut
- wrenchingly bad
. i wnated tothe run awya fomr thyat movei every minute
. bu i paid my monye
and i owed it tothe others to see if the movei got any better
. so i stayed
. it never got better
. frequentily
, it did thge impossible
, adn got
* worse
*
. tje movie as written
, acted
, directed
, annd basically jstu fiels as a whole liuke it
' s baout onthe thge mental maturity level ofthe a free willy 4
. hte whole thing feels liek a movie that only threee
- yearm
- olds could enjoy
.
.
. exept for tje ridiculously gratuitious blood anbd gore
, adn pointless nudity
. it
' s writen forthe littel childrens
,
but children should definitely
* nto
* go anyhwere near it
. of course
, i recomend the smae for everyone
. don
' t go anyhwere near it
. verhoeven
' s got a streak going nowe
. his lastr movei ws showgirls
. he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get befor peple fianlly stop comming
. showgirls ws a failure
, bu it appears that
,
though it
' ll be lucky to amking near its budget
, this movei iwll still dont okay gross
- wise
. is it realyl
* all
* bad
? well
, noone
. troopers hasnt about four or five lines of dialouge
/ short humoous scenes that are actually funny
, mostly fomr tghe
" do ytou wanna tothe know mroe
?
" commercials that pop up throughtout the story
, promoting thte joys of the joining the troopers
. so that adds up to baout 30 seconds of enteratinment
and still baout noe hour
, 59 mintues
, anbd 30 seconds of miserable torture
. i
' m totally confused as tothe thge way that some peopel are really enjoying tihs movei
.
but i do admitt it
. so
, if you
' re willing tothe possibly put youself thru torture
, go ahead
and see it
, annd deside forthe youself if yuo love it or hite it
. i don
' t knwo how anyone or any
* thing
* could loev this movie
,
but hey
, tothe each his pwn
. efel free tothe give it a shooted
. of course
, iin the interest ofthe saveing your souls
, i don
' t recommend it
. bu guess what
? alien resurrection comes outloud november 26th
,
and
, having already seen smoe ofthe it adn haveing read the script
, i assure you that it iwll blow preety much everyone away
.
though opinyon onthe starship troopers isnt reasonably split
, it
' ll be difficult to find someone tath
* won
' t
* like aline ressurrection wehn htey
' ve seen it
. tihs is possibly the yearm
' s best intense action film
, or at least
* oney
* of thge best
. if ytou raelly wanna tothe see aline warfare that
' s plyed out intelligently
and seriously
, see alien ressurrection
. please
, avoid this
.
