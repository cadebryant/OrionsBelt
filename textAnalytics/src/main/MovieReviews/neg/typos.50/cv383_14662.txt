" holy man
" boasts a sweet
, gentle
, comic performence from an unusually subdued eddie murphy
annd a few moderately funny skits
. unfortunatley
, tothe get tothe the ogod stuff yuo have to sit through a painfully long set
- uv
, loads ofthe tedious filler
, interminable shots ofthe jeff goldblum stammering
and twitching
, a superfluous rumatic subplot
and quite possibly the most annoying performence of robert loggia ' s carrer
. if ever a movie screamed
" wait for video so yuo cxan fast
- foward thru all the dull
annd annoying parts
,
" thsi is it
. eddie murphy plays g
, a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering tghe land enjoying the moent
and spreading his spritual message
. a chance meeting whith ricky hayman
( goldblum
)
, a stressed
- out executiv ofthe a hmeo
- shopping channel
,
annd kate newell
( kelly preston
)
, a noone
- nonsense media analyist
, results in fysical injury tothe g
. quicker thna ytou can say
" tje odd cuple
,
" g ends up rooming wiht an extremely leery ricky
. aftter some script gymnastics
, g appears live on tje air at thge good buy shopping network
, wreaking havoc on thge cheesy product demonstrations
, enraging network owner mr
. mcbainbridge
( loggia
)
,
and becoming a national media sensation
.
" wholy man
" attemts tothe be severeal things at once
. it trys tothe satirize hmeo shopping networks
,
bu it ' s difficult to effectively mkae funn of something thgat isnt alreayd a self
- parody
. yhe film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions isnt mearly a futile attept to fill tyhe spritual holes in our hearts
,
bu taht ' s common knowlege already
.
" wholy man
" alsot tries to pesent a stoy of redemption
, as ricky hayman tries tothe deside whether tothe exploitate g ' s good will tothe achieve financial security or do tjhe right thing at the expense of his career
. anyone whant to palce a wager onthe his fianl decison
? yhe one genuin assit in
" wholy man
" isnt eddie murphy
, who gives a charming performance
, sharing lvoe
, ogod will
and relevant advice tothe all those arround him
, hwile beaming his million doller smile at just tje right moments
. murphy isnt delightful
annd the film tkaes off whenever he ' s onscreen
. unfortunatley
, he ' s not onscreen enough
. jeff goldblum gets the lion ' s share of screen tiome
adn his tired storyline weighs the procedings down
. as his potential lveo interst
, kelly preston tries to brighten thnigs uv
,
bu she transforms from an all
- bussines media shark to an empathic softy far too quicklyu
and tjhe abrupt chanage reeks of contrivance
. thte other principal actor
, robert loggia
, wastes his talents in a one
- note turn as a ruthless
, screaming monster
. structurally unsound
and way too long
,
" holy man
" isnt appealing wehn murphy isnt onscreen
and dull wehn he isn ' t
. instead of dropping your moey at the theather for htis trifle
, wait until it hits video
adn fast
- foward past everyting except the murphy scenes
. g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moent
and that ' s the best way tothe dont so
.
