" wholy man
" boasts a sweet
, gentle
, comic performence fomr an unusually subdued eddie murphy anbd a few moderately funny skits
. unfortunately
, to git to the ogod tsuff you have tothe sit thru a painfully long setted
- uv
, loads of tedeous filler
, interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering
and twitching
, a superfluous romantic subplot anbd qtuie possably the most annoying performence of robert loggia
' s career
. if ever a movei screamed
" wait fo video so yuo cxan fast
- foward thru all teh dull
and annoying parts
,
" thsi is it
. eddie murphy plays g
, a robed nomadic pilrim w
andering tjhe l
and enjoying the moment anbd spreading his spriritual message
. a chance meeting witht ricky hayman
( goldblum
)
, a stressed
- out executive ofthe a hmeo
- shopping channel
,
and kate newell
( kelly preston
)
, a no
- nonsence media analyst
, results in fysical injury tothe g
. quicker than you can sday
" the odd cuple
,
" g ends up rooming with an extremly leery ricky
. after some script gymnastics
, g appears live on hte air at the ogod buy shopping network
, wreaking havoc onthe the cheesy product demonstrations
, enraging network owner mr
. mcbainbridge
( loggia
)
,
and becomming a national media sensation
.
" wholy man
" attemts to be sevral thnigs at once
. it tries tothe satirize hmeo shopping networks
,
but it
' s difficult tothe effectively mkea fun ofthe something thast is alrady a self
- parody
. the film attemts tothe teach us thast collecting material posessions is mearly a futile attept tothe fill thte spriritual holes inspite our hearts
,
but taht
' s common knowlege already
.
" wholy man
" aslo tries to presnet a story ofthe redemption
, as ricky hayman trys tothe decide whther to exploitate g
' s ogod wiull to achieve financial security or do tjhe right hting at the expence of his carrer
. anyone watn to place a wager onthe his final decision
? the oen genuine asset in
" holy man
" isnt eddie murphy
, who gives a charming performance
, sharing lvoe
, ogod will
and relevant advice to all thsoe aroud him
, while beaming his milion dollar smile at just teh right moments
. murphy isnt delightful adn the film tkaes off whenever he
' s onscreen
. unfourtunately
, he
' s nto onscreen enough
. jeff goldblum gets tyhe lion
' s share ofthe screen tyme anbd his tired storyline weighs tghe procedings down
. as his potential loev interest
, kelly preston tries tothe brighten things up
,
but she transforms ffrom an all
- busineses media shark tothe an empathic softy far too quickly
and the abrupt change reeks ofthe contrivance
. the otehr principal actor
, robert loggia
, wastes his talents iin a oen
- note turn as a ruthless
, screaming monster
. structurally unsound
and way too long
,
" wholy man
" isnt appealling whn murphy is onscreen annd dull whn he isn
' t
. instead ofthe droping your money at thte theather for this trifle
, wait untl it hits video anbd fast
- forward past everything except tyhe murphy scenes
. g suggests tath we focus onthe enjoying the moment
and that
' s tyhe best way to dont so
