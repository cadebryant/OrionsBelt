" dad couldn

and mom couldn

" paulie
, the authobiography ofthe a talking
, nto mearly a mimicking
, parrot
, hasnt jay mohr in thge lead role of tjhe bird
- thte voice
, not the body
- annd as yhe minor charcter ofthe benny
, a small
- timne crook who uses paulie tothe pul off small scams liek stealing twenties fomr atms
. as the parrot
, mohr isnt delightful whn directer john roberts allows him to cutted uv
. benny
, onthe thte otehr h
and
, is a character ytou
' ve seen a thous
and times before
, annd mohr brings nothing new tothe that role
. roberts
' s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig
' s script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor bu creates soem definite problems
. when a kids
' movie whants to mosey along
, watch outloud
. if hte material is not crisp
and perfectly composed
, beauty can somtimes dissolve into tedium
. so it is witht paulie
. whn they let their bird do his st
and
- uv comedy routines
, the sohw hums
and the audience roars
. too often
, howver
, a sleepy silence ensues amoung tyhe viewers as they wait fo the tsory tothe pickup again
. tony shalhoub
, yhe smart
- mouthed chef from big night

. he had beeen a teacher ofthe literature at hmeo

but now he makse his living as a janitor in teh animal research lab tothe whlch paulie has been taken for studdy
. altho misha gets a faw nice lines

, his somber part seems desgined onyl to elicit our simapthy
. besides paulie
, tje only charactor worth noting
- otehr tahn 2 cute small parts palyed by cheech marin annd gina rowl
ands
- isnt the speech
- impaired marie
, palyed infact a prescious performance by cinematic newcomer
, 5
- year
- ood hallie kate eisenberg
. naturally enchanting
, she gives the picture genuine heart
. hte bad news is tht her part is confined tothe tje first half
. the best scenes have the bird dancing anbd strutting tothe sohw off his comedic skills
. when marie
' s familiy gets a cat
, fo example
, thte bird
, who hasn
' t wnated to leran how to fli until
then
, tkaes an instant interest in soaring
. tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time
, paulie calls him a stupid hairball
. their rapid physical antics add tothe the humer of yhe situation
. it
' s ogod quailty sitcom material
but performed by animals
. whn noe ofthe the humans wihtout much of a voice begins to sing
, paulie cringes
.
" i
' m a bird
,
" he explains wiht his frequentily subtle humor
.
" i have a small brain
, annd it
' s baout to explode
.
" the movie containes rich doses ofthe john debney
' s dreamy music
. with heavy use of a solo violin
, he keesh reinforcing tyhe film
' s heart
- warming themes
. annd when paulie finally tkaes off in flight
, the orchestra comes up loud
and storng with cymbals clashing
.
" it
' s a long story
,
" says paulie
.
" it
' s the only kind he knows
,
" reflects misha
. adn the motion picture
, which runs thte st
andard length for a kids
' movie
, still fiels too long
. hte best parts are enthralling
, bu
then htere are all of those dead spots in
- between
. paulie isnt a movei tyhat never quite lives up to its promise bu manages to charm nevertheless
. paulie runs 1
: 32
. it is raged pg fo a few mild profanities
and would be fine for all aegs
. my son
, jeffrey
, age 9
, gave the movie
*
* with his biggest complaint bieng that ther wasn
' t enough action
. he throught paulie ws funny
, anbd tyhe actress that palyed marie was qutie good
. his friend sam
, almsot 9
,
thought the movie was
" awsome
, excellent
,
" annd gavey it

. he
thought paulie was ogod
,
but he didn
' t beleave the way marie
