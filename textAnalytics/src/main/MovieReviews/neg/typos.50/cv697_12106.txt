" marie couldn ' t talk
,
" paulie
, the parrot star ofthe his pwn movei
, tells us about the daugher in his orginial family
.
" dad couldn ' t listen
.
anbd mom couldn ' t cope
, so tehy got rid ofthe me
.
" paulie
, thte autobiography ofthe a tlaking
, nto merely a mimicking
, parrot
, has jay mohr in yhe lead role of tjhe bird
- the voice
, nto tje body
-
and as tghe minor carachter ofthe benny
, a small
- time crook who uses paulie tothe pul off small scams liuke stealing twenties from atms
. as thge parrot
, mohr isnt delightful whn director john roberts allows him to cut uv
. benny
, on thge other hand
, isnt a character you ' ve seen a thousand times before
,
adn mohr brings nothing new tothe taht role
. roberts ' s deliberatly slow pacing of laurie craig ' s scirpt lends a subtle sweetness tothe its humer
but creates soem dfeinite problems
. wehn a kids ' movei wnats to mosey allong
, watch outloud
. if the material isnt nto crisp
adn perfectly composed
, beauty cant somtimes desolve into tedium
. so it isnt with paulie
. when they let thier bird do his stand
- up comedy routines
, the sohw hums
and teh audience roars
. too oftenly
,
however
, a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as htey wait for hte story to pickup agina
. tony shalhoub
, tyhe smart
- mouthed chef ffrom big ngiht
, plays misha
, a recent russina immigrant tothe tyhe u
. s
. he had been a teacher ofthe literature at home
,
bu now he makse his living as a janitor in the animal reasearch lab to which paulie has beeen taked fo studdy
.
although misha gets a fewd nice lines
(
" i ' m russian
. i liek long stories
.
"
)
, his somber part seems desined only to elicit our sympathy
. besides paulie
, tje onyl character worth noting
- other tahn 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin
and gina rowlands
- isnt the speech
- impaired marie
, palyed inwhich a prescious performance by cinematic newcomer
, 5
- eyar
- ood hallie kate eisenberg
. naturally exchanching
, she gives thge picture genuin heart
. yhe bad news is thgat her part isnt confined tothe the firt half
. tjhe best scenes have yhe bird dancing
and strutting to sohw off his comedic skills
. when marie ' s family gets a cat
, for exmaple
, the bird
, who hasn ' t wanted tothe learn how tothe fli until
thne
, tkaes an instant interest infact soaring
. tricking the cat hwile insulting him at yhe smae tiem
, paulie calls him a stupid hairball
. thier rapid fysical antics add tothe hte humer of tjhe situation
. it ' s good quality sitcom material
bu performes by animals
. when oen ofthe yhe humans wihtout much of a voice begins to sing
, paulie cringes
.
" i ' m a bird
,
" he explains with his frequently subtle humer
.
" i haev a small brain
,
and it ' s baout tothe explode
.
" the movie countains rich doses ofthe john debney ' s dreamy music
. wih hevy use of a solo violin
, he keeps reinforcing tjhe film ' s heart
- warming themes
.
and whn paulie fianlly takes off in flight
, teh orchestra comes up loud
anbd strong whith cymbals clashing
.
" it ' s a long stopry
,
" sasy paulie
.
" it ' s the only kind he knows
,
" reflects misha
.
and the motion picture
, which runs the standart length for a kids ' movei
, still feels too long
. the best parts are enthralling
,
bu
then htere are all of those dead spots in
- beween
. paulie isnt a movie that never qtuie lives up to its promise
bu manages to charm neverthless
. paulie runs 1
: 32
. it isnt raged pg for a few mild profanities
annd would be fine for all ages
. my son
, jeffrey
, age 9
, gave yhe movei
*
* with his biggest complaint being that there wasn ' t enough acation
. he thougth paulie ws funny
,
and thge actress that played marie was qtuie ogod
. his firend sam

, throught the movie wass
" awesome
, excellent
,
"
