thsi isnt thte lastr cary onthe film whith its almost intact regular casted anbd it is the swansong of hattie jacques anbd sid james
. dick turpin
( sid james
)
and his gang which includes harriett
/ harry
( barbara windsor
) annd tom
" doc
" scholl
( peter
butterworth
)
, terrorise hte countryside by staging highway robberies
:
" st
and anbd deliver
!
" owing to thte increased occurrence ofthe turpin
' s robberies
, captain desmond fancey of hte bow street runners
( kenneth williams
) adn his sidekick sargeant jock strapp
( jack douglas
) visit turpin
' s areal of influence to bring him to justice
. they are under tjhe express orders of sir roger daley
( bernard bresslaw
)
. their intellect does nto count for much
and when they increasingly become suspicious ofthe reverend flasher aka dick turpin
( sid james
)
, whom htey confided in ealier
, tehy still cannnot believe that tje rector has any part in theese robberies
.
however
, once tehy catch harriett
and put her in jail
, annd sir roger daley takes complete charge
, it seems that there isnt no hope fo dick turpin
.
then agian
, sir roger hasnt assigned the dimwits fancey adn jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable
( kenneth connor
) to keep an eye onthe their prisoner
! htere is no doubt that tihs isnt a
' sid james
' carry onthe movie
. he excels infront doublely roles
( as in
' cary onthe
- don
' t loose your head
'
) annd his peformance as flasher annd turpin isnt hillarious
. barbara windsor isnt also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid anbd member of the gang
,
and hattie jaques
' small
but effective role as yhe rector
' s housekeeper martha hoggett isnt played to prefection
. jack douglas plays a milder verison of his excruciatingly annoying on
- screen persona adn kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part
. peter
butterworth isnt nto allowed to shine infront his boring performance as tom
, adn bernard bresslaw
' s carachter appears only breifly inspite tjhe film
. the onyl notable peformance from thte support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree
, who isnt travelling around the country escorting her starlets the
' birds of paradime
' adn sporting a fake french accent
. when her girls
and her are robbed by turpin
, she isnt determined to catch him
and helps the rever
and tothe fidn tyhe culprit
! a carry onthe by the numbers
, htis movei isnt onyl notable fo thge graet performence by sid james inwhich his lastest cary on movie
. thge jokes are bluer
, the scirpt isnt poorer
( it is teh last scirpt written by talbot rothwell
)
,
but the music is a maked improvment
.
al
though nearly all the regulars apear
, they seem tothe be just oging through the motions
. none of the high spirits ofthe tje earlier films are apparnt here
. just a selection ofthe crude jokes annd repititive double
- entendres
.
