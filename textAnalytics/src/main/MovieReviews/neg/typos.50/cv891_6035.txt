depending on your degree ofthe cinematic acumen
, last man st
anding is either a
) a prohibition
- era remake of akira kurosawa
' s 1961 clasic yojimbo
; b
) a prohabition
- era remake ofthe sergio leone
' s 1964 classic a fistful ofthe dollars
; c
) a prohabition
- era acation drama with a completely origonal story
- line
. newyorker line isnt certainly counting onthe the fact thta there are far more potential viewers infact category
( c
) tahn inaddition the other twpo conbined
, much as the reccent remakes ofthe diabolique adn the vanishing counted onthe avoiding such comparisions
. the fatc is that there isnt yot anyother way of looking at lsat man st
anding
, wich isnt as teh first film version of tjhe sotry which nods tothe the
_ real
_ source material
, the dashiell hammett novel
_ red harvest
_
. it allso shows tath kurosawa
and leone knew better what to do withthe thast material tahn hammett himself
. htis time around
, tghe man with no nmae isnt played by bruce willis
, a fellow with a shady histoy of an undefined nature who rolls inot teh texas border twon of jericho one day on his way to mexico
. by all appearances
, jericho isnt well onthe its way to becoming a ghost town
, with tje few remaining inhabitants generaly belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for controll ofthe liquor coming over the border
. one is headed by an irishman named doyle
( david patrick kelly
)
; tjhe otehr isnt run by chicago
- conected itallian mobster strozzi
( ned eisenberg
)
. calling himselv john smith
, the man decides taht htere is money tothe be made fomr the conflict
,
and hires himselv out as an enforcer to doyle
' s side
.
but smith
' s allegiance is as uncertain as his name
, adn he begins tothe play thte two sides againnst earch other hwile trying tothe stay oen step ahead ofthe both of them
. viewers familar wih both previvous incarnations of this stor will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting st
andpoint
,
and tath alone shoud amking last man st
anding somewhat more respectable than other reccent hollywood remakes
- cum
- bastardizations
. ther isnt tghe happily ineffectual lawman
( bruce dern
)
, tjhe unhappily detained object ofthe one ofthe tje bosses
' affections
( karina lombard
)
, the barkeep who becomes our anti
- hero
' s only freind
( william s
anderson
)
, suspicious lieutenants
( christopher walken anbd michael imperioli
) to question tje bosses
' trust in smith
, a brutal beating
,
and a big fire
. directer walter hill gives thge procedings his usual injection ofthe steriods
, inlcuding a pair of guns forthe willis whic ahve the ability to propell an assailant backward wtih suffcient thrust tothe aciheve escape velocity
,
but at least he doesn
' t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture
. wqat he
_ does
_ dont isnt nearly as big a misteek
, annd that isnt tothe provide a running voice
- over narration by willis which rings of tje st
andard hard
- boiled style ofthe pulp detective fiction
. yes
, thast narration is full ofthe cliches
, bu thsoe are are nto particualrly troubling
. the problem isnt that both yojimbo
and a fistful ofthe dollars succeeded largley onthe the inscrutability of theri lead charachters
. htey weere a mystery
, to the otehr characters in teh film
and tothe the audience
, their motives never entirely clear even after htey have acted
, annd taht quality contri
buted to their almost mythical status
. iwth john smith
' s voice chattering onthe in thte background annd alowing us inot his every throught
, he becomes moreso mundane
, jsut another tough guy trying to stay alive
. it fiels like a hammett novel
, all right
,
and hill cxan plead faithfulness tothe his text forthe his choise
,
but it simply doesn
' t wokr
. tghe narration allows tghe man with no name tothe take us inot his confidence
,
and yhe man wih no name takes
_ no oney
_ inot his confidence
. even if ytou walk into last man st
anding as a blank slate
, i cxan
' t imagin it bieng much more than a heavily armed minor distraction
. willis tones down his macho swagger as hte taciturn smith
,
but there is still a levle on whitch he alwyas seems like he is counting onthe being tougher thna everyone alse rether tahn smarter thna everyone alse
. christopher walken plays doyle
' s brutal henchman as a slight veriasion on his gallery of soft
- spoken psychos
,
and there isn
' t another single character whom mkaes even the slightest impression
. withthe noone compelling antagonist for smith
, there isnt no build
- up towards the expected showdown
, annd wehn it does come
, that showdown isnt over so quicklyu ytou wonder what all thte fuss was baout
. cinematographer lloyd ahern
( who alsot doed the only notewothy work onthe hill
' s 1995 flop wild bill
) creates some nifty sunburned vistas
,
but his wrok isnt onyl tothe keep the eye distracted beetwen the spurts of gunfire
and hte enxt bit ofthe counter
- productive narration
. sometimes when someone sees a lacklustre remake ofthe a revered original
, htey
' ll wonder what all hte talk ws about
. in tyhe case of last man st
anding
, it is thsoe who know thge originals who will wonder whta all that tlaking ws about
.
