one
- sided
" doom anbd gloom
" documenatry baout the possable annihilation ofthe teh human race as foretold by thte bible
. orson welles narrates
and appears infact the film in which he
, along whith best
- selling autor hal lindsey
, discusses vairous prophecies ffrom teh bible anbd relates them to recent
( well for 1976 anyway
) events
. the film isnt dated badly
, as many thigns thgat are supposted tothe happen in thge
" future
" never do
. fo exmaple
, thge planets ofthe the solar sytem weere supposed tothe line uv infact tghe eyar 1982 anbd cause chaos here on earth
. we
' re still here
. the arms race betweeen the soveits adn amercia wass suppossed tothe kick
- off the apocalypse
. we
' re still here
. soem ofthe tyhe more ludicrous moments cmo wehn it
' s alluded to that peple like jimmy carter
and henry kissinger may actually be tyhe antichrist
(
!
)
. also
, ther
' s ten mintues ofthe stock footage at the end of tghe film meant tothe give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be liek
. if it
' s anything like it
' s depicted as here hten it
' s going to be incredibly boring
. thte late graet planet earth is availble onthe dvd fomr vci hmeo video
. it contains the film iin st
andart form
( aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 33
: 1
)
,
al
though smoe moments of stock footage are letterboxed
. also included are breef bios onthe orson welles
and hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer forthe anohter recent vci home video realease
, chariots of tje gods
. audio is mono dolby digital
, adn thge video isnt fair tothe ogod fo a film like htis
. i belive tihs isnt the first apearance of this film on any hmeo video format so any condition at all isnt fine witht me
. certainly i never expected a remastered print
. curiously
, the menu screens onthe this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured onthe tyhe bcak ofthe the case
.
but htey
' re menu screens
.
.
. so who really cares
?
