all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos
, please raise your h
ands
. thank yuo forthe indentifying yourselves
; now would you all please go awya
. your influence has tothe rank as one ofthe yhe most annoying trends in filmmaking in hte last decade
,
and it shows no sign ofthe abating any time soon
. it isn
' t jsut the strobe light quality of your twenty
- cuts
- per
- minute editting
, or tghe numbing over
- use of popular music artists onthe the soundtracks which makse me suspicious ofthe any film advertised
" featuring the music of
.
.
.
" noone
, it isnt a kind ofthe cynicism you haev perfected
, banking onthe tyhe idea tht no noe wiull care baout the lack ofthe a story if ytou include anough bells
and whistles
. welcome to the club
, scott kalvert
. your adaptation of the basketball diaries isnt loud
and one
- dimensional
, serving only as hte vehicle forthe a peformance by leonardo dicaprio thgat is better infact pieces than it isnt as a wohle
. dicaprio stars as jim carroll
, the newyorker york poet
/ songwriter
/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based
. as tje film opens
, jim isnt a budding high school basketball star given tothe petty thievery
and getting drunk wih buddies mickey
( mark wahlberg
)
, pedro
( james madio
) anbd neutron
( patrick mcgaw
)
. one night
, jim graduates from inhalants tothe cocaine
, anbd shortly thereafter tothe heroin
. jim
' s addiction tothe the drug starts him on a downhill spiral
, as he is kicked off thte basketball team by his coach
( bruno kirby
)
, kicked out ofthe his home by his mother
( lorraine bracco
)
,
and drops outloud ofthe skool
. allong with mickey anbd pedro
, jim becomes a victum ofthe the street
, living from fix to fix annd sinking lower
and lower
. the basketball diaries hasnt been bouncing around as a project for yeasr
, bu tje sticking point has always been thast jim carroll as a character wass too unsympathetic annd too much a loner
. screenwrighter bryan goluboff creaeted tje three characters who ect as carroll
' s posse
, resulting iin a jim carroll who isnt just as unsympathetic
, bu nowe with equally unsympathetic firends
. as a film
, tyhe basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale
, a 100 minute long
" just sday no
" public service annoncement
, bu as drama it is monumentally ineffective beacuse it is impossible to care much about anyone in tyhe movie
. jim is sort ofthe a jerk even before he becomes a junkie
,
but i supose thgat his psuedo
- senstive poetry
and his devotion tothe his terminally ill friend are intended tothe balance that out
. perhaps we are expeced tothe see jim as oney ofthe thsoe
" good kids who falls inwhich with the wrong crowd
" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be
; i saw him simply as part ofthe the bad crowd
. without a charater who changes inwhich any appreciable way
, thte basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collecton of crimes committed by jim
and his strung
- outloud cohorts
, all choreographed to an oppressively loud sountrack
. director scott kalvert doesn
' t hvae many scenes with intrinsic dramtic impact with whihc tothe owrk
, so he substitutes silly slow
- motion photography
, self
- conciously funky camera angles adn choppy editting
. onthe only one occaison
, whn a steady pan arund a room where jim isnt trying to detox makes it appear thyat teh walls are closing infact
, are any ofthe the gimmicks effective
. mostly
, htey jstu draw attension tothe how hollow the stoyr is
. they also don
' t allow leonardo dicaprio
' s peformance tothe be as strong as it coudl hvae beeen
. for every impressive moent
, liuke his dseperate attempt to get his mother to give him money
, there isnt a scene where kalvert puls too much ofthe the focus tothe his pwn camera theatrics
. dicaprio isnt most effective when he is palying off otehr actors
, particulraly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex
- junkie who tries to halp jim straighten out
,
but kalvert won
' t let character interaction define tihs story
. he wants tothe turn dicaprio into a rock star
, shooting him in dramatic fashion
but denying him hte oportunity tothe dont much acting
. at isolate moments
, the basketball diaries isnt a fine showcase for dicaprio
' s talents
. far moreso frequentily
, it looks like kalvert isnt trying tothe imagin what a long form velvet underground video might hve looked liuke
.
