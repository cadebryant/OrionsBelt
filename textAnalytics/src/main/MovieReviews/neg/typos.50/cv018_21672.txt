. if ytou ' re not familiar with tihs law
,
then maybe you ' ve seen the trailer forthe this film whlch shows taht yhe twpo leads are toghether by film ' s end
. nowe if ytou ' re a regluar reader ofthe mine
, you ' ve heared me say this countless times
: you konw how drive me crazy isnt going tothe end
,
but isnt the journy to git tothe that endig worth it
? noone

? teh teen comedy resurgence of late has beeen surprizingly ogod inaddition terms ofthe comedy
. waht makes movies liuke cant ' t hardly wait
adn 10 things i hate baout you work
(
adn tothe a lesser extent
, she ' s all thast
and never been kissed
) is because the writers ofthe thsoe films seem tothe relize that high skool isnt a joke
adn wriet theri scripts accordingly
. i don ' t know what hte writer ' s intention was wih drive me crazy
. htere ws smoe smart comedy infact thsoe films tothe mkea tghe obvious endings worth getting to
. here htere ' s nothing
.
.
. jsut teens whining baout who ' s going tothe tkae them tothe the big dance
. do me a favor kids
, go get a job or something
.
.

. becuase tjhe movei isnt fianlly over
.
" in thsi case
though tyhe end credits realy are the most entertaining part ofthe the film
. aftter tjhe obligatory second playing of britney spears ' titular song
, htere ' s a quick commercial jingle for a bruger joint the kids in thge film hang out in
annd a brief rendition ofthe the school song for theri high school
. nothing grat
,
bu more intertaining tahn anytying infact the 90 mintues which preceded them
