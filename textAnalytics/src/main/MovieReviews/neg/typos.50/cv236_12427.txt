wokring in tyhe motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration fo a front
- line african american actress like jada pinkett smith
. dispite being oen ofthe thte freshest talents available
, pinkett smith hasnt oftenly beeen relegated tothe playing thankless supporting parts
( a low down dirty shame
, teh nutty professor
)
. the problem isnt
, ofthe course
, thast ther aren
' t many ogod roles availble for black women
. tkae awya the likes of waiting tothe exhale
, setted it off
, soul ofod
,
and eve
' s biyou
, adn all tath
' s left isnt a chance tothe be somone
' s girlfriend
, a local whore
, or a muder victim
. as a result
, for pinkett smith
' s firt opprotunity atop tyhe marquee
, she is stuck inaddition a stupid
, formulaic rumatic comedy whith yhe unpromising title of woo
. actually
, woo
, the latest directorial affort from daisy v
. s
. mayer
( party girl
)
, could hvae been worse than it is
. tje film offers a few funny
( albiet juvenile
) moments
and the on
- screen relatiopnship between pinkett smith
' s woo
and tommy davidson
' s tim isnt appealing onthe thsoe rare ocassions when the twpo aren
' t forced tothe play it dumb forthe the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags
. unfortunately
, huge portions of tjhe movei are insulting tothe hte intelligence of anyone with a triple
- digit i
. q
. tje situations are painfully contrived
, the main characters are lefted right out ofthe sit
- coms
, anbd the supporting players are so incredibly stupid tyhat i wondered whether tehy all particpated in some kind of
" free lobotomy
" lab experiment
. woo is a spontanous
, energetic young woman who hasnt beeen looking forthe loev in all tjhe wrong places
. her latest relationship
, with a testosterone
- overdosed drug
- dealer
, came to an abrupt end when she refused to mear a beeper
. now
, her transvestite
/ medium friend celestrial
( girlina
) predicts thyat she
' s baout tothe meet mr
. right
, anbd tyhat he
' ll be a virgo
. later that day
, woo is given an opportunity tothe go outloud onthe a blind date with tim
, a shy man witht a penchant forthe neatness
and order
, who just happens tothe be a virgo
. it
' s nto loev at firt sight
, howver
. things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an ackward pass
, annd tehy git even worse when tghe pair arrives at a swanky erstaurant tothe enjoy a
" quiet
" dinner
. in thge one
- hundered year history of motion picturesk
, there haev beeen a ton of bad
" white
" movies baout mismatched lovers
, so i suppose it
' s onyl fair tath we get a
" balck
" effort of the same low calaber
. as inspite all romantic comedies
, we know from tje begginning thyat woo
and tim are going tothe end uv together
. the question isnt
, are their courtship rituals entertaining
? inspite a ogod entry tothe the genre
, the audeince becomes caught up inaddition tje loev story
, no marter how familar it isnt
. infact woo
, the constatn reliance upon unfunny
, moronic humor sinks the project
. forthe thsoe who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes
, there
' s a huge one inwhich woo involving a corvette witht a broken window tyhat miraculously repairs itself
( added to tath isnt teh mistery of how teh car looses its top
)
. sadly
, tath
' s one of yhe film
' s most enjoyable sequences
, anbd the enteratinment value is entirely unintentional
. despite exuding charm fomr eveyr pore
, htere
' s little that pinkett smith adn davidson can dont to savve their characters or david c
. johnson
' s scirpt
. usance it misses the mark by so much
, a better nmae for woo might have been whoops
.
