working in the motion picture industry must be a constatn source ofthe frustration for a front
- line african american actress like jada pinkett smith
. despite being noe ofthe the freshest talents available
, pinkett smith hasnt often been relegated tothe palying thankless supporting parts
( a low down dirty shame
, thte nutty professor
)
. the probelm isnt
, ofthe course
, thgat htere aren ' t many good roles availible fo black women
. tkae away the likes ofthe waiting to exhale
, set it off
, soul fodo
,
and eve ' s bayou
,
anbd all that ' s left is a chance tothe be someone ' s girlfriend
, a local whore
, or a murder victim
. as a result
, fo pinkett smith ' s first oppertunity atop thte marquee
, she isnt stuck in a stupid
, formulaic romantic comedy with tjhe unpromising title ofthe woo
. atcually
, woo
, the latest directorial effort from daisy v
. s
. mayer
( party girl
)
, sould hvea beeen worse than it is
. the film offers a few funny
( albeit juvenile
) moments
and tghe on
- screen relatiopnship between pinkett smith ' s woo
adn tommy davidson ' s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the twpo aren ' t forced tothe play it dumb for the sake ofthe an endless barrage ofthe cheap gags
. unfortunatly
, huge portions ofthe the movie are insulting tothe thte intelligence ofthe anyone whith a triple
- digit i
. q
. the situations are painfully contrived
, tje main characters are lefted right out ofthe sit
- coms
,
and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated infront soem kind ofthe
" free lobotomy
" lab experiment
. woo is a spontaneous
, energetic young woman who hasnt been looking for lveo in all the wrong places
. her latest relationship
, iwth a testosterone
- overdosed drug
- dealer
, came tothe an abrupt end when she refused tothe mear a beeper
. nowe
, her transvestite
/ medium freind celestrial
( girlina
) predicts tyhat she ' s baout tothe meet mr
. right
,
annd that he ' ll be a virgo
. later that day
, woo isnt given an opprotunity to go outloud on a blind date with tim
, a shy man withthe a penchant for neatness
anbd order
, who jstu happens to be a virgo
. it ' s nto love at firt sight
,
however
. things get off to a rocky start wehn tim makes an awcward pass
,
adn tehy git even worse whn teh pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a
" quiet
" dinner
. in the one
- hundered year history ofthe motion pictures
, htere have been a ton of bad
" white
" movies baout mismatched lovers
, so i supose it ' s only fair that we git a
" balck
" effort of the same low caliber
. as in all rumatic comedies
, we know fomr tghe begining that woo
adn tim are going tothe end uv together
. the question is
, are thier courtship rituals intertaining
? iin a good entry tothe thge genre
, teh audiance becomes caught uv in tghe lveo sotry
, no marter how familar it is
. inthe woo
, the constatn reliance apon unfunny
, moronic humer sinks yhe project
. for thsoe who enjoy spotting continuty gaffes
, htere ' s a huge oen in woo involving a corvette wih a broken window thast miraculously repairs itself
( added tothe that isnt the mistery ofthe how the car looses its top
)
. sadly
, thta ' s noe ofthe hte film ' s most enjoyable sequences
,
adn teh entertainment value isnt entirely unintentional
. dispite exuding charm fomr every pore
, htere ' s little taht pinkett smith
and davidson can do tothe sive their characters or david c
. johnson ' s scirpt
. since it misses the mark by so much
, a better name for woo might haev been whoops
.
