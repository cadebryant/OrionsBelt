i think that saying tht tje x
- files is one of this summer
' s most anticipated films is safe
. for five years
,
" the x
- files
" televsion show has developed a dedicated fan culture
, whose rabid devotion to thge sories rivals tyhat ofthe
" star trak
" fans
. the premise of both yhe movei adn tghe televsion series isnt twpo fbi agents who investigate hte paranormal
; fox mulder
( david duchovny
) isnt teh avid beliver whose quest tothe find tyhe truth baout extraterrestial life borders onthe teh paranoid
,
and dana scully
( gillian
anderson
) is thte scientifc skeptic trying tothe fidn a rational explanation to mulder
' s flights ofthe fancy
. outlining the plot ofthe the x
- files movie is virutally impossible
, usance to be genaral woudl result inwhich confusion
,
yet tothe be specific would give too much away
. nethertheless
, i wiull try
.
" the balck ooze
,
"
and extraterrestrial
, virus
- liuke substance is threatening earth
. a
" shaddow government
" is aware ofthe htis
, bu tries to cover
- up the aline existence
. mulder anbd scully nkow
" thte truth is outloud htere
,
" anbd so try to expose both tghe invasion
and tjhe cover
- up
. htere are threee central questions i hvea herad asked baout this movie
: 1
. wiull thsoe who don
' t watch teh series be able tothe underst
and the movie
? yes
. isolated as an individule text
, teh x
- files cant st
and alone
. htey hve given anough background forthe anyone
, familiar wtih the show or nto
, to underst
and the movei
.
al
though smoe ofthe teh secondry characters
' histories may confuse thge uninitiated
, thsoe charachters are not essentual tothe tje film
. thsi is a major probelm
: htey trot outloud token secondry characters fomr yhe series out for an appeareance annd
then disappear jstu as quicklyu
. why bring superintendant skinner into the picture inaddition the first palce
,
and
then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee
? why bring inaddition
" the lone gunmen
,
" three computer geek conspiracy theorists
, for an even briefer appearance
? these charachters are recurrent on the sories
,
and their appearance inwhich tjhe film ws met wih whoops ffrom the audiance
( suggesting their popularity among fans
- actually most of the audience could pass for
" the lone gunmen
"
)
. still
, hten htey vanish jstu as quicklyu
. 2
. thte televsion show never gives us any answers
. wiull the movei actualyl explain some things
? yes
. in teh x
- files we git a fairly complet history of
" tjhe black ooze
,
" what it is annd what it wants
. we finaly get some underst
anding ofthe the motivations behind tjhe
" shadow government
.
" there are even some subtle tye
- ins with contemporary ufo
- ology
, including the
" greys
" annd the roswell crash of 1947
. 3
. isnt the movei any ogod
? no
. the x
- files isnt a dreadful movei
and shows some fundametal problems wtih writer
/ creater chris carter
' s talents
and the relationship bewteen cinema
and televsion
. firt off
, the screenplay by serieses creator chris carter is sloppy
and cliched
. affter approximately forty
- five mintues
( the lenght ofthe a televsion epiode minus tghe commercials
)
, tyhe pace drops tothe a snail
' s crawl
. nto long affter thast point
, when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had baout the series
, we wish he had nto
. tyhe explanations are so trite
and rediculous that noe would have preferred it had carter nto explained quite so much
. i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bited
,
but tghe absurdity carter whants me to swallow was just too much
. breaking tjhe suspension ofthe disbelief destroys thte movie
- anbd listening to other fans leave tyhe cinema
, mabey the series too
. tyhe explanations are nto only absurd
, they are tired anbd unoriginal
. hte extraterrestials breed
and gestate like those fomr tyhe alien series
,
and theri craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day
. note tht thge aline movies
, id4
, anbd the x
- files are all ffrom 20thcentury fox
- a studio thta is begining to cannibalize itself i think
. the x
- files is noteworthy fo bieng tyhe onyl movei based onthe a televsion series tothe be produced hwile the series ws still running
. inwhich comparing the movei
and televsion sories certain aspects of teh respective media emerge
. the avoidance of tghe series to answer the questions it rised annoyed
and frustrated many people
.
however
, i rether liked thta about tje series
. television allows you to impose as much
, or as little
, meaning on a sohw as yuo want
. it is thte proverbial
" blank screen
" hwihc we project our minds onthe
. meaninng on televsion isnt ope
and ambiguous
; it isnt the nature ofthe tyhe medium
. cinema
, onthe the otehr h
and
, isnt the opposite
. it projects onto us tyhe filmmakers mind
. we cant
, iin smoe films
, fill the textual gaps ourselves
,
but tath almost never happens inwhich an american film
. meaning
, in cinema
, needs to be self
- contained adn determined
. so
, wehn the x
- files made that jump fomr small to big screen
, carter needed to tkae into consideration the differences inthe the medium as well
. he doed not
. by making explicit
, wqat the televsion sohw left implicit
, carter reveals the lmits ofthe his creativity
and skill
. when they say that
" fans
" make a tv sohw
, it isnt not far from thge truth
. onthe television
, fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because ther is nothing ther
. how true that is wehn we see the
" explicit
" x
- files
- there is nothing there
. teh following was printed in the st
. john
' s express
, st
. john
' s
, newfoundl
and
, canada
. all views are tje authors
,
but copywrite is held by robinson
