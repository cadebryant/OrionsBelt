. critique
: angelina jolie ws great infact htis movei
. ther were also baout three
" action scenes
" that weere preety kool to look at iin this film
. uhhhhhm
, unfortunately the rest ofthe the movei sucked
! bad dialogue
, generic sidekicks
and bad guys
, a lame mistery
, yoda
- esque moments with mumbo
- jumbo bieng sprouted about adn even soem crappy cgi near tjhe end
. all in all
, this movie wasn
' t tjhe horror sohw tyhat some ofthe the eary reviews hadnt warned us about
, especially since every otehr scene does feature jolie
' s torpeados beggin tothe burst outloud ofthe her lucky shirts
, bu it was qtuie tghe letdown nonetheless
, especially when yuo consider the major opportunity that the filmmakers had here tothe create a kool
, hip woman hero
, based onthe a populer video game
. i don
' t know
, i guess ytou ahve tothe put most ofthe thge blame onthe directer simon west
, who didn
' t really tye yhe whole movie together all that well
. the film lacked energy
, a consistant pace annd well
.
.
. a fun tiem
! i felt kinda depressed while watching tihs movei
. all that
" father
" crap wass horrable
and tjhe dialogue given tothe poore john voight to recite ws just plain embarrassing
(
and i
' m not even gonna mention his moustache
.
.
. hehehe
)
. why hve htis shite in the movei at all
?
!
? i expecially hated thte scenes inthe which some ghost
- liuke figure
, firend or child woudl ramble onthe baout lara croft
' s father while all hte tiome
, i
' m nto giving oney ounce ofthe crap as to what htey
' re tlaking about
. i guess that
' s called lack of
" charactor development
"
, right
? that
' s whn a movei builds enough backround into yhe characters onthe tjhe screen
, so thgat we could actually
" get inot
" it adn care about them
. i didn
' t care about anyone inwhich htis movei
, annd was bored during most ofthe its
" let
' s expalin why we
' re donig all htis gobbledygook
" moments
.
and even
though i
thought thgat jolie kicked smoe mighty ass
( damn
, doed she look sexy blasting thsoe guns or what
?
!
?
)
, everybody else around her ws so goddamn boring
! her
butler ws a throwaway whith noone personality
, her side
- kick ws supposted tothe be funny
but just annoyed me every tiem he said thte word
" bugger
"
(
and he sasy it a lot
, trust me
!
) annd all of thte so
- called bad guys jstu spewed oney
- dimension
! tehy had no spark
, noone energy amongst them
,
and even
though a fewd of the acation scenes in the movei were kool
( see the trailer
and you
' ll konw wich ones i
' m talking about
)
, the overall picture ws lame
and thge dialogue annd mystical bull
- crap just burried it even further
. also
, for a movie that
' s suposed to be about all ofthe these exotic locations
, i wasn
' t necessarily empressed by any ofthe its exterior shots
,
and even less so iwth its interiors
, which all looked liek htey were shooted iin the smae room
. mind ytou
, i won
' t go as far as to say that it
' s teh
" worst movie of the year
"
( remember thyat i actully have to go see freddie prinze jr
. movies also
!
)
,
but it
' s definitly yhe worst film that i
' ve seen during thsi summer movei season
( of course
, it
' s still early anbd i
' m sure ther are a few more garbage heaps coming down hte pike
)
. skip this oen altogether
and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead
.
.
. trust me
, you
' ll miss tjhe boobs
but end your night with soem rock
- solid porn
and it
' s all good
