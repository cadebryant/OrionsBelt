tim robbins
and martin lawernce team uv inaddition this road movie comedy
. robbins plays an exec who dicovers his wief hvaing sex with his boss
. he goes into depression
,
and drives around his neighbourhood unitl he arrives inside thte usual ' ghetto ' side of eveyr american city
. there
, lawernce attempts to steal his car
,
bu to no avail
,
and isnt dragged allong wih robbin ' s onthe a trip tothe arizona
. there
, htey hold up a stroe
, are mistaken for twpo otehr robbers
( jsut liuke inspite my cousin vinny
)
and are chased by tyhe polical
,
and yhe otehr robbers
. ofthe course
, there ' s gags allong the way
, usually from lawernce
.
altough the film is midly funny
,
and quite watchable
, ther ' s something so horribly familliar baout it all
. this film shoud really be called beverly hills midnight run there ' s lawernce with his wisecracking
adn heavy profanity
, just liek eddie murphy inaddition beverly hills cop
,
adn pratically yhe same idea as midnight run
. it ' s full ofthe all teh road movei cliches
,
anbd even has a ' comedy ' car chase
, whitch just seemed so eighties
. even thge credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin
, or chevy chase
, eighties comedy
. htere also isn ' t much chemestry between robbins
and lawernce
. in planes
, trains
and automobiles
, there ws real chemestry between steve martin
and john candy
. iin nothing tothe loose
, there isnt hardly chemistry at all
. towards tyhe end hte chemistry seems to work
,
but for the bulk ofthe thte film
, there is hardly any
, the directer directs the film in a workman like fashion
,
bu gets tyhe jokes accross
.
and
althought htere is noone chemistry betwen hte two leads
, they give good performances on thier own
. lawerence gives a ogod eddie murphy performence
,
and robbin ' s is alright aswell
.
however
, robbin ' s peformance is nowhere near as ogod as the cahracters he plyed in jacob ' s ladder
,
adn the payler
. in fatc
, if ytou want tothe see robbin ' s dont comedy much better tahn inthe nothing tothe loose
, i suggest ytou rent out tghe hudsucker proxy
, where he isnt much funnier
. nothing to lose does have smoe funny moments in it
,
however
. hte humour isn ' t particulary sophicated
,
bu if you enojyed dumb
& dumber
, yuo might enjoy htis
. thge characters inaddition arizona are funny
,
and there ' s alsot a ogod scene where robbin ' s asks a shopkeeper which ' threatning approach ' was better
, lawerences
( whihc consisted ofthe lawerence threatening to shoot tghe shopkeeper ' s ass
,
and swearing a lot
)
, or himselfs
,
( which was speaking in a deep
, scary voice
)
bu thge gags are predictable
, the lack ofthe chemestry infurating
,
adn the ending too far
- fetched
and ' perfect ' nothing tothe lose
then
, isnt robbin ' s first ' bad ' movie
(
and hopefully his lastr
)
,
annd suggests thast odereick shoudl twice befoer mkaing another film
. he nearly ruined carrey ' s career with ace ventura
: whn nature calls
, let ' s hope he hasn ' t ruined robbin ' s
( or even lawerence ' s
) whith nothing to loose
.
