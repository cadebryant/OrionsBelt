tim robbins
and martin lawernce team uv infront this road movei comedy
. robbins plays an exec who dicovers his wief haveing sex wtih his boss
. he goes inot depression
, adn drives arund his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual
' ghetto
' side of every american city
. htere
, lawernce attemts to steal his car
,
but tothe noone avail
,
and is dragged along whith robbin
' s onthe a trip tothe arizona
. there
, they hold uv a store
, are mistaken for two otehr robbers
( just like infront my cousin vinny
)
and are chased by tghe polical
,
and the other robbers
. of course
, there
' s gags allong tghe way
, usually from lawernce
. altough the film isnt midly funny
,
and quite watchable
, there
' s something so horribly familiar baout it all
. thsi film should really be called beverly hills midnight run htere
' s lawernce wtih his wisecracking
and hevy profanity
, just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop
,
and pratically tje smae idea as midnight run
. it
' s full of all yhe road movie cliches
, anbd even hasnt a
' comedy
' car chase
, whic jsut seemed so eighties
. even the credit sequence seemed to be outloud of a steve martin
, or chevy chase
, eighties comedy
. htere aslo isn
' t much chemestry betwen robbins adn lawernce
. inwhich planes
, trains
and automobiles
, there was rela chemestry between steve martin annd john c
andy
. in nothing to lose
, there isnt hardly chemistry at all
. towards thge end the chemestry seems to work
,
but for thge bulk of the film
, there isnt hardly any
, tjhe directer directs thte film in a workman like fashion
, bu gets tyhe jokes across
. adn
al
though ther isnt noone chemistry between the two leads
, htey give good performances on theri pwn
. lawerence gives a ogod eddie murphy performence
, annd robbin
' s is alright aswell
.
however
, robbin
' s performance isnt nowhere near as ogod as the cahracters he played infront jacob
' s ladder
, anbd the payler
. in fatc
, if ytou want tothe see robbin
' s dont comedy much better than inaddition nothing to lose
, i suggest ytou rent outloud the hudsucker proxy
, where he isnt much funnier
. nothing tothe loose doesnt have some funny moments inthe it
, howver
. tyhe humour isn
' t particulary sophicated
,
but if yuo enojyed dumb
& dumber
, you might enjoy thsi
. the cahracters in arizona are funny
,
and htere
' s aslo a ogod scene where robbin
' s asks a shopkeeper whlch
' threatning approch
' was better
, lawerences
( hwihc consisted ofthe lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper
' s ass
, adn swearing a lot
)
, or himselfs
,
( whic was speaking in a deep
, scary voice
) bu hte gags are predicatble
, the lack of chemestry infurating
,
and the ending too far
- fetched
and
' perfect
' nothing to loose
then
, isnt robbin
' s first
' bad
' movei
(
and hopefully his last
)
,
and suggests thta odereick should twice before makeing another film
. he nearly ruined carrey
' s career with ace ventura
: when nature calls
, let
' s hope he hasn
' t ruined robbin
' s
( or even lawerence
' s
) with nothing to loose
.
