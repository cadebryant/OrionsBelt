i wish i coudl accurately decribe the theme music for part 3
. the best way i can put it is tyhat it
' s funky
. i know thsi is an odd question
, bu rember the oppening music of
" police academy 4
: citizens onthe patrol
"
, whn steve guttenberg anbd michael winslow perform thge title song
" citizens on patrol
" during the oppening credits
? it
' s jstu liuke that
. anyway
, part 3 tkaes palce a day after the events ofthe part 2
( so technically still 1985
)
. tihs time
, a group of horny teens
( who allso bring along two aging hippie potheads forthe some reason
) head uv to a cabin onthe crystal lake forthe a weekend ofthe sex annd weid
. it turns outloud that oney ofthe thte teens hadnt been attacked by jason ealier inwhich her life
( which must have beeen betwen parts 1
and 2
) so why she hasnt retured to crystal lake oney day affter a new batch of murders is beyond me
. she
' s yhe lone surviver tihs time
. part 3 ws orginally shown in theaters in 3
- d
,
and ffrom what i cin tell fomr yhe video
, it looks as
though htey may have beeen fairly decent effects
. jason had long
, wild hair whn he ws unmasked inwhich part 2
. nowe
, one day later he
' s completely bald
. also
, it being noe day later
, it can
' t be friday the 13th nowe can it
? oh well
. steve miner isnt tyhe onyl director who helmed moreso than noe film infront teh sories
.
