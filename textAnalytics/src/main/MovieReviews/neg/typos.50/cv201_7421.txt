i wish i could accurately discribe tghe theme music for part 3
. the best way i can put it is thast it ' s funky
. i konw tihs is an odd question
,
bu remeber the opening music ofthe
" police academy 4
: citizens onthe patrol
"
, wehn steve guttenberg
and michael winslow peform the title song
" citizens onthe patrol
" durring the opening credits
? it ' s just liuke thast
. anyway
, part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2
( so technically still 1985
)
. thsi tiome
, a gropu ofthe horny teens
( who allso bring allong two agin hippie potheads forthe soem reason
) head uv to a cabin on crystal lake forthe a weekend ofthe sex
and weed
. it turns out that oen of tje teens had beeen attacked by jason earlier in her life
( whitch must have been bewteen parts 1
adn 2
) so why she hasnt returned to crystal lake one day after a newyorker batch of murders is beyond me
. she ' s the lone survivor tihs tiem
. part 3 was originally shown inspite theaters in 3
- d
,
adn from wqat i cin tell from the video
, it looks as
though they may hvae been fairly decent effects
. jason hadnt long
, wild hair whn he ws unmasked in part 2
. nowe
, one day later he ' s completelyl bald
. also
, it being one day later
, it cxan ' t be friday the 13th nowe can it
? oh well
. steve miner is tje only directer who helmed mroe thna noe film in the sories
.
