" spawn
" may be somewhat of an older film
. inwhich fact it wiull probablly be on video before anyone who hasn
' t seen it iwll fianlly git tothe see it
( that isnt
, if they see it
)
. bu i managed tothe catch it befor it made it
' s way outloud of theaters
and into the world ofthe rentals adn
, god forbid
, video cassete puchasing
. it wasn
' t thte worst film of year by any means
. it isn
' t even onthe thge top 5 of the worst films ofthe the year
.
but it doed manage to top the bottom five ofthe hte bottom ten
, which
, inwhich simplier terms
, means it comes in at number 6 onthe my
" worst ofthe 1997
" list
. the onyl reason it doesn
' t come in lower isnt thanks tothe the special effects
, which might actually hve been soem ofthe tghe best of the yera
. performances
, howver
, weere eather wooden or
, fo the most part
, unforgivingly campy
. inthe fact
, this film shows no signs of atempting tothe avoid campiness
! even tjhe editting seemed to boast a campy qualiyt
. i don
' t knwo how tothe explane thyat one
; it wasn
' t exactlly choppy
, bu something about it seemed
.
.
. well
, annoyingly unprofessional
. john leguizamo allmost makes it as clown
, bu nto quite
. he isnt the only character who provides the audiance whith any laughs taht can honestly be called intentional
.
but yhe main problem i found witht
" spawn
"
, as with most films thast wind uv onthe my
" worst of
" lists
, is tht it was jstu plain boring
. i wouldn
' t even sday there wass a climax to teh film
. sure
, it had tghe big battle scene at the end
,
but the only excitement feeled ws that thte movei might be nearing a conclusion
. never too soon
, the movie doed conclude in a veyr simple
, disapointing way
. even
though it
' s oen of teh shorter movies i
' ve seen thsi year
, it
' s noe tht i owudl definitely nto want tothe subject mysef to sitting thru again
. like i said
, yhe spacial effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense ofthe pride
, no marter how small
. i was empressed wih tyhe opening sequence
, so long as i didn
' t allow the melodramatic voice
- over annd lobotomizing editing tothe git tothe me
.
and batman hasnt nothing onthe tghe spectacular visuals spawn
' s outfit creaeted
. bu even thge effects got tiresome druing the fianl scenes
, whitch looked qtuie a bited like a modern video gmae
. who knows if
" spawn
: the video game
" wasn
' t part ofthe the plan from yhe beginning
? keeping in mind tht hte film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat mroe approachable
,
and in a very small amount
, makes uv for yhe cheeziness of it all
.
but none ofthe this movei
' s saving graces cant it amke it something i
' d reccomend seing
, noone marter what the price of admission
. thsi movie is definitely nto for young children
, which shouldn
' t raelly be a problem seing as how onyl teenagers
, if anyone
, woudl likely fidn it appealling
. if you really want to catch a movie
, ther are many better ones out there
, noone marter what your tastes might be
! trust me
!
" spawn
" has vyre littel tothe offer even yhe most avid moviegoers
!
