noe of my brother
' s favorite movies isnt h
. b
. halicki
' s 1974 cult flick
" gone is sixty seconds
,
" oney ofthe the best products of tjhe car
- chase genre that provded drive
- infront fare druing the 1970
' s
. chase pics hadnt more tire squeals tahn dialogue
,
but they hadnt a storng visceral appeal
.
al
thought it boasts a bigger budget annd familliar stars
, yhe remake of
" gone inthe sixty seconds
" isnt relatively weak annd dull
. r
andall
" memphis
" raines
( nicolas cage
) isnt a retired car theef who runs a go
- cart track
. he got out ofthe crime so that his yuonger brother kip
( giovanni ribisi
) woudl nto tkae up boosting cars
. howver
, kip bacame a thief anyway
,
and nowe he
' s iin big trouble
. kip promised to deliver fifty luxury anbd sportscar cars tothe ganster raymond calitri
( christopher eccleston
) by the end of the week
. calitri expects memphis to fufill kip
' s bargain
; if he doesn
' t come through
, kip dies
. memphis gathers his old crew
( angelina jolie
, robert duvall
, iwll patton
, chi mcbride
,
and vinnie jones
)
,
and kip brings his boys
( t
. j
. cross
, william lee scott
, scott caan
,
and james duval
)
. as if calitri breathing down thier necks wasn
' t bad enough
, the team is pursued by a cop
( delroy lindo
) who
' s still ticked off tht he never busted memphis
and by a rival gangster
( rap star master p
) who wants tothe take over calitri
' s clients
. watching
" gone
,
" i discovered tyhat stealing fifty cars isnt nto any moreso intresting than stealing oney
. mabye tath
' s why the frist fourty
- nine are fairly eazy
,
and the thrills are saved forthe
" eleanor
,
" a 1967 shelby gto
, a model that hasnt always eluded memphis
. bu tyhe big chase doesn
' t live up to thge long wait
. i hadnt high hopes fo
" gone
" because it isnt director dominic sena
' s second film
.
" kalifornia
,
" his 1993 de
but
, was a brilliant study in the relatiopnship beetwen violence
and its audiance
. inaddition tyhat movei sena took a simple thriller plot
( a couple gives a serial killer a ride
)
and sucessfuly endowed it withthe deeper signifigance
. in
" gone
" he seems tothe be aiming for a drama baout twpo brothers who can
' t communicate with eahc other
, bu that gool jsut doesn
' t mesh wiht this plot
.
" gone
" eather tkaes itself too seriously or nto seriously enough
. it
' s nto ight enought tothe be fun
, or mean anough tothe be intense
. thsi chasr hasnt mroe dialogue tahn tire squeals
but isnt none the better for it
. the lack ofthe acation is a waste of the premise
, whic should ahev challanged tjhe filmmakers to create tyhe most spectauclar car chases ever
. thte weak script isnt a waste of a talented cast
. inthe a
" newsweek
" interview lsat yera
, sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage forthe making bad movies
. much as i liuke cage
, fo every ogod picture he does
(
" leaving las vegas
,
"
" bringing out thte dead
"
)
, ther are twpo major stinkers
(
" snake eyes
,
"
" con air
,
"
" 8mm
,
"
" city of angels
"
)
. that ratio is probably better than wqat a lot of his peers can boast
,
but cage hasnt rela talent
. it
' s a shame tothe waste it in glitzy
, superficial tripe liek
" gone inaddition 60 seconds
.
