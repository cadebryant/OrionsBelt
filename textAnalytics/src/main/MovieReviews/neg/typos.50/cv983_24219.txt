tommy lee jones chases an innocent victum arround america who isnt trying tothe proove that she did nto kill her spouse
. hte fugitive
? nto quite
? tihs isnt teh plot forthe double jeapardy
, another fugitive copycat without teh acation
, excitment
, anbd ogod acting thta the orginal hadnt
. ther are otehr slight differences besides oney movie being bad
and thge other ogod
; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer nto a us marshall
, clever huh
? oh adn the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her pwn husb
and
( bruce greenwood
) who needed tothe collect twpo million dollars in life insurance mnoey nto a one armed man
. both movies are on video
. amking the wise choise
and pik the fugitive
. htere are so many flaws inthe double jeapardy
, it isnt laughable
. hwile serving time in prision
, libby parsons
( judd
) dicovers thgat she cxan never be charged fo committing yhe smae crime twice
. learning tyhat her husb
and isnt still alive
, she decides tothe serve her time inaddition prision
, fidn him
, retreive her son
, adn kill her husb
and if necessary
. wehn the strict parole officer travis lehman
( jones
) st
ands in her way
, libby decides tothe break the rules
( who konws why
?
) anbd continue her plan
, dispite thte fatc tath if she gets caught
, she
' s going bakc tothe jail
. directer bruce beresford spends way too much tyme trying to convince the audeince tath libby misses her son
. eveyr other scene
, we are given a shot ofthe libby staring annd crying at his picture
. infact an acation movie liek htis
, valueable time wasted on these shots takes away mroe opportunities for libby to git up annd do something
. all that is needed infront thsi tipe of movei is a short scene in whlch libby tells herself or a friend
" i miss my son
.
" nothing moreso
, nothing less
. dr
. kimble of the fugitive didn
' t look at one picture ofthe his dead wife
, his primary consern was to save himself
. libby at times shows thsi smae determination
but not nearly anough
. ashley judd adn bruce greenwood both are excellent actors
but if they continue to dont movies like htis
, tehy will be typecast for tjhe rest ofthe theri careers
, kind ofthe liuke thier doomed co
- star tommy lee jones
. winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones tht audiences iwll never get tired of his i
- dont
- my
- job
- whther
- tehy
- are
- innocent
- or
- gilty roles
. people still pay tothe see his movies
and he makse plenty ofthe money so i guess he was right
.
though i don
' t think he wiull win another oscar agina
. teh ulitmate misteek iin the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons
. even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer
, teh number ofthe otehr crimes she commits hwile onthe the run are too numerous tothe count
. burglary
, assault
, gr
and theft auto are some of libby
' s slipups
. the message of yhe movie is yuo can break all ofthe tje small laws as long as you
' re innocent of yhe major crime
. hopefully criminals won
' t use double jeopardy as a refference in cout forthe why htey are innocent
. that woudl just be plain stupid
.
