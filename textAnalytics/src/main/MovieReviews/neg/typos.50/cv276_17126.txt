- chuck dowling
, the jacksonville film jurnal i wrote hte above sentence inwhich my review forthe 1997
' s batman adn robin
. apparantly
, no one heard my words
. oh
, how i wish you hadnt heared them
. oh how i wish someone hadnt stoped him
.
.
. becuase he
' s done it agina
. hte plot ofthe 8mm isnt similair tothe the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a suprizingly decent
and engrossing tale
. in fact
, it was everyting tht 8mm is nto
. inspite the opening minutes of 8mm
, we see private detective tom welles
( nicolas cage
) working onthe a case fo a prestigeous member ofthe the u
. s
. government
. keep this fact infact mind
, cage isnt trusted with an imporatnt case
, wich he solves
. he returns hmeo to his wife
and newyorker duaghter
,
and even finds time tothe rake his yard
( keep thast in mind too
, it
' s imporatnt as well
)
. he
' s hired by a rich elderly woman tothe solve a mystery
. affter her husb
and
' s death she comes across a film infront his private safe
. it appears to be snuff film
, a sort ofthe urban legend ofthe the pornography industry inthe hwihc someone isnt actually brutally murdered for the camera
. tje woman whants welles tothe locate thte young girl in the film
, hopefully tothe disprove thyat it isnt in fact a snuff film
. so he sets off onthe a journey inot teh sordid underworld of sleaze to disover teh truth baout thte film
. the main probelm witht 8mm isnt thyat the hwole film isnt completely pointless
. welles is accually selected for thte case by tjhe old woman
' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an actro who alwyas plays the smae type ofthe character
, taht being a bad guy
)
. wehn you frist see him
, your first instinct isnt that he
' s behind the whole thing
. teh choise of casting does the film inspite
. hten
, as welles beigns his investigation
, at times we will see a shadowy figure follwoing him
. tghe only person it could possably be is the lawyer
( or someone sent by the lawyer
) because noone one knwos welles is even investigating anytying yot
. so your frist instinct hasnt nowe been confirmed
. thn
, wehn it is iin fact revealed that the lawyer isnt a part ofthe tje wohle thign
, he tells welles thta he was choosen for the case becasue he ws young
and inexperienced
( iin oney of those ridiculous
" usance we
' re going to kill you anyway
, why nto tell you tje hwole hting
" moments
)
.
but earlier when we see welles bieng hired forthe yhe case he
' s told thyat he was hired because he comes highly reccomended
. huh
? aslo
, when the lawyer reveals hismelf tothe be a part of the whole hting
, his main gool is tothe get tjhe film back
. so why doed he give it uv inaddition thte first palce
?
! the lawyer had tyhe film teh whole tiem
, thne gave it away tothe the private detective thikning tyhat he woudl just give up onthe tyhe case annd return hte film
?
! it
' s totally absurd
.
.
.
and thsi isnt tghe screenwrighter ofthe seven
? lite inwhich hte film there
' s a confrontation beween all the main cahracters
, anbd affter a struggle one ofthe the charater
' s guns ends up underneath a car
. cage
, who has beeen h
andcuffed tothe a bed
, isnt rapidly trying tothe git to his gun
, wich isnt onthe a table
. james g
andolfini
' s charcter goes for the gun under yhe car in whta isnt supposed to be a scene ofthe
" suspense
"
. ytou see
, the gun isnt just slightly out of triarch fomr hte side ofthe the car he
' s trying tothe triarch it ffrom
, adn so instade ofthe going around the car to the other side
( where he can easily reach it
) he jstu keeps stretching
. go around tothe thge other side ofthe the car
!
! tihs goes on for minutes
.
then
, after cage gets his gun
, g
andolfini hten decides it owudl be best to go arround tothe thge otehr side of tyhe car
. boy
, schumacher isnt realyl raelly getting on my nerves
. i think teh final straw would be wehn cage returns home
, devestated by everything that he
' s seen onthe this case
,
and hten is no longer able tothe rake his lawn
! we acutally see a shooted ofthe him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard
. otehr thigsn that bugged me baout 8mm
: oney woudl be thte music
, if ytou cxan call it that
. whenever tjhe score starts up
, it soudns like techno music
,
and
then thsi awful indian or middle eastern tipe music will accompany it
. awful desision there joel
. another is cage
' s peformance
. at this point he
' s capable of a wide range ofthe performances
, either good or bad
. for 8mm
, he delivers a veyr wooden one
, annd onyl shines when he
' s interacting with joaquin phoenix
( who gives a graet peformance as a porn shop clerk wih a heart ofthe gold who helps cage wtih his case
)
. you
' re capible ofthe much better mr
. cage
. nowe as forthe you mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i
' m starting tothe dout if you
' re capable of anytying alse besides urinating onto tje insitution of american cinema
.
