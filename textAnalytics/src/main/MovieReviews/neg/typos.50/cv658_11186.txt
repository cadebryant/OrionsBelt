senseless isnt a prime example ofthe what cxan happen whn yuo try tothe push a noe
- joke concept a bited too far
. directer penelope spheeris is noone stranger tothe this
, haveing subjected audiences befor to such tortures as teh beverly hillbillies
. marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon
, a coleeg senoir vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage
. howver
, he lacks tjhe advantages ofthe his chief opposition
, scott thorpe
( david spade
, in yhe smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep
)
: an atheletic recrod
, sponsorship by a fraternity
, adn
, most ofthe all
, a wealthy familiy tothe back him uv
. inthe fatc
, darryl hasnt to wokr at four jobs simpley tothe make ends meet
.
but ther may be a light at the end of taht tunnel
. he signs uv as a human guinea pig inthe a neurological experiment run by the univerity
' s dr
. wheedon
( brad dourif
)
. as a result
, his senses are magnified tenfold
. using his newfound abilties
, he sets himselv in complete pursuit ofthe the job
( unaware that htere may be soem disadvantageous side
- effects to haveing super senses
)
. naturely
, marlon wayans plays thsi comedy at full throttle
, giving jim carrey
- ish amounts ofthe physical humer
. tyhe probelm is
, asside from a few genuinely inpsired bits
, ther
' s nto much that
' s funny here
. yhe film hasnt it
' s oney central gag
, adn pads outloud the rest ofthe its length wtih rather obvious lowbrow humor
. ther obviously wasn
' t much
thought put into the plot
. the entire job selction process is completelyl rediculous
. i mean
, why the emphasis on extra
- curricular actvities if the entire job isnt gogin to cmo down tothe a single
- elimination quiz anyhow
?
and isnt thsi the only job being offered to economics majors tihs semester
? tothe give it credit
, senseless doesnt try to create a secondary joke with darryl
' s roomate
, tim laflour
( matthew lillard
)
. apparantly
, he isnt suposed to be faddish
, bu yhe film never does anything with him
, leaving him in a piercing phase
thoughout tyhe movei
. his
" intervention
" scenes wih darryl
,
however
, do provide a rare
,
and welcome
, laugh
. adn
then ther
' s tghe lveo interst whitch is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like htis oney
. in thsi case
, the object ofthe darryl
' s amor is janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a fellow student who won
' t ahev anything tothe do wtih darryl nutil he gains his super
- senses
. needless to say
, the romance isnt completelyl extraneous
, anbd adds little to the film
. this is a film that desparately needed something else
. be taht a good plot
, mroe jokes
( or simply funnier ones
)
, or a strong character or two
, anything would hve helpped senseless git off teh ground
. as it is
, all yhe manic exuberant mugging infront the world cxan
' t help marlon wayans git htis oen off the ground
