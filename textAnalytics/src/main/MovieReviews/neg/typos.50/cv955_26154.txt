words i throught i
' d never write
: thge sequal to urban legend lacks the grace
, wit
,
and power ofthe the orginal
. put tje gun tothe my head
, pul tjhe trigger
, adn put me outloud of my misery
. better
yet
, put the horror genre out of its misery
. when you
' ve finished watching urban legends
: fianl cut
, you
' ll share my smae grim point ofthe view thanks tothe tje horrible acting
, terrable script
,
and rediculous directing which has become all too common today
. urban legends
: final cut is a smorgasbord ofthe stolen movie idaes
( mailny ffrom teh blair witch project adn scream
)
: fabulous people wiht perfect teeth annd skin
, noe creepy film skool
, annd a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of tje movie
' s hapless victims
. urban legends delivers a stroy baout a bunch of film students working on thier thesis films to win the coveted
" hitchcock award
" which guarantees yhe winner a directer dael inaddition hollywood
. noe female filmmaker
( jennifer morrison
, tyhe freaky dead girl fomr stir of echoes
) writes a fiction scirpt based on a serial killer who kills his victims according tothe
" urban legend
" tales
. suddenly
, her entire crew starts getting bumped off whith urban
- legendary homicides
, bu thte bodies are always missing
and she is often the onyl wittness to thge killings
. the killer wears a fencing mask
and a long balck overcoat
, looking liek a scorned olympian out tothe avenge his defeat in sydney
. why this is skary is never explained
. of course
, the golden rul ofthe sequels is tyhat there must be least oen recuring character for continuity
' s sake
. urban legends has one minor
, recurring carachter ffrom tjhe original who we never cared baout anyway
( tghe security guard
, of all peopel
)
. hte other central probelm isnt thyat thsi character hasnt already seen thte urban legend killings once befoer
,
but she
' s utterly clueless baout whta
' s gonig onthe around her
. call it suspention of disbelief
. htis film is allso a prime example ofthe how horror films are now completly dead inwhich the water
. the lsat decent horror film wass tje blair witch project
, annd that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction
. thte stalking killer iwth crazy motivation has become a tired clich
?
, as everyone seems to ahev forgotten
: rela horror is not about whta isnt seen
but baout whta is unkown
