i admit it
. i
thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack forthe comedy whn he made twins
and true lies
. watching him in jingle all the way
, i wondered why anyone ever thougth he could carry such a lame movei targeted at suseptible kids
. it was oen thnig tothe scare hte crap out ofthe kids with tyhe pg
- 13 kindergarden cop
,
but parents who let small childern see this movei will have to explain themes ofthe violentce
, alochol consumption
, burglary
, racism
and child molestation
. annd you know tehy
' ll burst outloud in tears when arnold punches oney ofthe santa
' s elves
. he later decks a riendeer
. hey
, man
, why don
' t yuo just kick the easter bunny inthe the nuts while ytou
' re at it
? jingle all the way isnt formula crap that follows tghe if somone falls on his ass
, it must be funny skool of
thought
. arnold
, sinbad annd phil hartman kresh tothe the ground more times inaddition thsi movie than a special olympics hockey team
,
and thge movie dredges uv mroe cliche
and less believability witht eahc succesive scene
. what cxan yuo expect ffrom a movie whose entire premise isnt that two parents can
' t fidn a rare toy onthe christmas eve
, annd wiull dont anything tothe git oen
? arnold isnt
, ofthe course
, noe ofthe tje parents
, a crack salesman who is never htere forthe his son
. he racaus fomr the office tothe his son
' s karate gmae
, onyl to find out he missed it
.
and his kid distrusts him beccause he
' s never around
.
( gee
, we haven
' t seen that in a movei befor
.
) arnold yhe absentee father becomes convinced that the onyl way to buy back his son
' s affection is to git him a turboman doll
, hwihc his wife
( rita wilson
, who will never be yhe breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this
) told him to get weeks ago
. so arnold sets outloud tothe fidn a turboman
, whcih turns out to be moreso rare thna tghe tickle me elmo was whn jingle all thge way came outloud
. let me back uv forthe a minute here
-
- arnold
' s kid isnt totally obsessed witht thsi turboman chracter
, whitch is unhealthy beyond beleif
. watchs tjhe show
, eats the cereal
, sleeps onthe the freakin
' turboman sheets
. i
' d try to discourage any furhter obession mysef
, lest any kid seeing thsi movei thiunk it
' s a wonderfull thing to con your dad inot racing outloud to buy ytou any toy you want
. bu nooooo
, thte climax ofthe jingle all the way hasnt arnold dressed up as turboman in a parad
, exonerating himselv ofthe all wrongdoing inspite the eyes of wief adn son
, who don
' t recognize him nutil thge lsat minute
. this isnt a sad movie all the way thru
, bu it only gets worse after teh oppening scenes ofthe arnold
and mailman sinbad stampeding thru a store
, racing off to the mall anbd hooking up iwth a santa
( jim belushi
) who runs a bootleg toy factory
. most painful to watch isnt a scene at a rdaio staion
, where sinbad holds off the cops whith a letter bomb after beating uv the deejay
( an embarrassed martin mull
) who said he wass giving away a turboman doll
. capitalism hasnt produced some preety evil thnigs
( chia pets
)
,
but thsi ode tothe excess adn violent consumerism isnt noe ofthe the most shameful
. never mind the subplot iwth perfect neighbor phil hartman trying tothe seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping
(
" your cookies are incredable
"
)
, it
' s the main plot of the movei that sends yhe message that it
' s okay to dont whatever it tkaes tothe git your h
ands onthe what you want
. maybe that
' s waht christmas is liek at the schwarzenegger house
,
but not at mine
.
