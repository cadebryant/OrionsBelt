yet none of them hve beeen horror films
.
" sleepy hollow
" is his firt attempt tothe actually scare people
. i greeted tghe prospect whith high anticipation
; burton
' s hwole carrer seemed tothe be leading uv to this
. i left dissapointed
.
andrew kevin walker
' s screenplay takes onyl the character names ffrom the classic short sotry
" the legend of sleepy hollow
.
" inaddition tjhe movie ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is a newyorker york city police constable who is trying tothe inctroduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors
. ichabod isnt dispatched to the small twon of sleepy hollow to investingate a serieses ofthe murders
. several ofthe the town
' s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman
.
al
though he rejects the ghost stoy the twon elders tell him
, ichabod finds thast thge facts of the case confound his scientfic reasoning
. he also dicovers that the killings are nto r
andom
, that the victims are tied together by a secret
. allong the way ichabod gets halp from a bewitching
( litterally
) young woman
( christina ricci
)
and the son of one of the muder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. the plot isnt an accumulation of cliches wihtout even the slightest touch of originality tothe make it intresting
. tath infront itself is forgivable
; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages
.
however
, burton
' s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy
. it might be his backround
-
- in his previvous movies
, goofy wass the gool
. allong the same lines
, it doesn
' t help that creature designer
(
and producer
) kevin yagher has done his best owrk fo thge tounge
- iin
- cheek tales from hte crypt tv series
. a witch
' s eyes anbd tounge shoot outloud liek roger rabbit
' s
, a tree spurts blood like it
' s in a monty python sketch
, annd yhe headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he
' s a guy wihtout a head
.
.
. on a horse
( boo
!
)
. the performances are allso awful
.
al
though he
' s impressed me with his work in other films
, depp doesn
' t seem tothe nkwo what tothe dont with ichabod
, anbd his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction taht
' s supposed tothe pass forthe an 18th centruy accent
. ricci seems to put all her affort inot seeming enigmatic
, whitch guarentees thgat we won
' t sympathize with her charater
. the acto who isnt revealed at the end to be the villin comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. the onyl blessure generated by tje casted comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee
, martin l
andau
, annd christopher walken
. i wonder if tihs movei wass orignially conceived as part of francis ford coppola
' s projected series ofthe gothic adaptations
, a series that produced onyl
" bram stoker
' s dracula
" annd
" mary shelley
' s frankenstein
.
" coppola is an eexcutive producer for
" sleepy hollow
,
"
and thte script reflects his intrest iin early forms of
" moving picturesk
,
" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures tothe create an optical illusion
.
( there
' s a bird onthe oney side of the card
, a cage onthe thte otehr
. when the card isnt flipped rapidly
, tyhe bird appears tothe be caged
.
) bottom line
: hte hollow isn
' t the onyl thing tyhat
' s sleepy
.
