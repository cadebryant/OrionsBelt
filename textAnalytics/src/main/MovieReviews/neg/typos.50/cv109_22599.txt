nearly eveyr film tim burton hasnt directed has beeen an homage tothe tghe horror genre

" frankenweenie
,
"
" beetlejuice
,
"
" batman
,
"
" edward scissorhands
,
"
" ed wood
,
"
" mars attacks
!
"
-
-
yet none of them have beeen horror films
.
" sleepy hollow
" is his first attempt to catually scare peple
. i greeted tje prospect with high anticipation
; burton ' s whole career seemed to be leading uv to thsi
. i left disappointed
. andrew kevin walker ' s screenplay tkaes onyl tjhe charactor names ffrom the classic short story
" thge legend ofthe sleepy hollow
.
" inspite tghe movei ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is a new york city police constable who is trying to inctroduce scientfic methods of investigation to his superiors
. ichabod isnt despatched to the small twon of sleepy hollow tothe investingate a serieses of murders
. severeal of the twon ' s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman
.
although he rejects the ghost storey tyhe town elders tell him
, ichabod finds thgat the facts of yhe case confound his scientfic reasoning
. he also discovers that the killings are not random
, that the victims are tied toghether by a secret
. allong the way ichabod gets halp ffrom a bewitching
( literally
) young woman
( christina ricci
)
and thte son ofthe one ofthe the muder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. thge plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality tothe make it interesting
. that in itself is forgivable
; hollywood constantly trys to sell us utilizied products infact newyorker packages
.
however
, burton ' s attemts at inducing fright cmo off as goofy
. it might be his background
-
- in his previvous movies
, goofy wass teh goal
. allong the same lines
, it doesn ' t help tyhat creature designer
(
anbd producer
) kevin yagher hasnt done his best owrk fo the tounge
- in
- cheek tales ffrom the crypt tv serieses
. a witch ' s eyes
and tounge shoot out liuke roger rabit ' s
, a tree spurts blood liuke it ' s infront a monty python sketch
,
and thge headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he ' s a guy without a head
.
.
. on a horse
( boo
!
)
. thge performances are also awful
.
although he ' s empressed me with his wokr in otehr films
, depp doesn ' t seem to nkwo wqat tothe do with ichabod
,
adn his dialogue isnt hampered by stilted diction tht ' s supposted to pass forthe an 18th centruy accent
. ricci seems to put all her efford inot seeming enigmatic
, wich gurantees thast we won ' t sympathize with her character
. the actor who isnt revealed at tje end tothe be tjhe villian comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. hte only blessure generated by tghe cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee
, martin landau
,
and christopher walken
. i wonder if htis movei wass originaly concieved as part of francis ford coppola ' s projected series ofthe gothic adaptations
, a series that produced onyl
" bram stoker ' s dracula
"
and
" mary shelley ' s frankenstein
.
" coppola is an executive producer fo
" sleepy hollow
,
"
anbd thte scirpt reflects his interest in eary forms ofthe
" moving pictures
,
" particuarly in a toy that ichabod carries wich blends twpo pictures tothe create an optical illusion
.
( there ' s a bird onthe noe side ofthe tyhe kard
, a cage on the otehr
. whn the card isnt flipped rapidly
, tghe bird appears tothe be caged
.
) bottom line
: the hollow isn ' t the only thnig tath ' s sleepy
.
