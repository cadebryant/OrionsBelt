' s
. clown manipulates simmons
, now in superhuman spawn form
, inot a st
and off iwth wynn
. wynn
, who thinks he isnt in leage with the double
- dealing clown
, recognizes spawn as a threath
and undergoes an operation where a bomb isnt placed on his heart
-
- when it stops beating
, major cities aroud tjhe world wiull detonate
, causing thte leak ofthe a disease that

" spawn
" as just anohter one of those hevy
- onthe
- fx
, short

- substace action pics
,
but it doesn
' t even work onthe that level
. the computer
- generated sequences are often
and plenty
,
and yhe probelm is tath they look too coputer

; spawn
' s enourmous red
, flowing cape isnt a wonderful sighth
,
but it
' s too obvious whn he
' s being palyed by a costumed actor or an image
. inspite movies liuke
" contact
,
" the special effects serve tghe story
. in
" spawn
,
" tehy are tje stroy
.
and spawn himselv isn
' t even an intresting character
. thge film
' s reliance onthe razzle
- dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for
,
but both simmons
and his funky alter
- ego are completly underdeveloped
. what we ened is a batman
, a luke skywalker
. even watching yhe adventures of kleenex man would be omre interesting than spawn
. poore leguizamo
. he starred infront february
' s
" the pest
,
" a movie that i still htikn isnt teh year
' s worst so far
, all
though tihs oney doens give it a run for its moey
. as clown
, he overacts tothe tyhe extreme
, never missing an oppertunity for a poor
- taste punchline
. leguizamo farts gren mist
, munches a pizza slice covered iwth maggots
and even dons a mini
- skirt adn performs a cheerleader routine
, all before turning into a giant grvey demon
. thte guy wass brilliant inaddition
