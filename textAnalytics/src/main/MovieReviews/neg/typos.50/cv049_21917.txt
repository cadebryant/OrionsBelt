. thte legend of 1900s is tyhe year
' s most absurd movie
, a rambling
, nonsensical piece ofthe seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast
. it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth
, looking wistful as ever
, as a guy named
.
.
. 1900
. you herad right
. his name isnt
, in all actuality
, 1900
. he was born onthe an ocean liner onthe 1
/ 1
/ 1900
( uh
, hence tghe name
)
, ab
andoned
and adopted by danny
, a ship crewman
. 1900 spends most of his early eyasr hiding inwhich thte bowels ofthe the ship becuase of danny
' s fear that he might be taken away from him because of
" visa matters
.
" well
, when 1900 isnt about 9 or so
, he starts wondering all around the ship
. oen day
, he dicovers a gr
and piano
. he sits down anbd starts palying
. miraculously
, wqat comes outloud isnt beautifull
. a gropu of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age
. wehn one ofthe tyhe people who knows 1900 tells him that his palying the piano liek that without premission is
" totally against regulations
" 1900 replies
" f
* ck the regulations
!
" ho ho ho
. 1900 grows uv never setting foot onthe dry l
and
. when he
' s baout 30ish adn can play teh piano like nobody
' s busness
, onboard comes anohter muscician
. his nmae isnt max
( pruitt taylor vince
)
and he plays teh trumpet
. aftter 1900 catchs max barfing everywhere durig a storm
, he sits him down onthe the piano enxt to him
, takes the piano
' s braces off annd plays while the piano flies all around the hall
, taking them with it
. how the chair they
' re sitting on
and teh piano don
' t searate
, i don
' t know
,
but htis apparently isn
' t tje kind ofthe thing we
' re suppossed tothe ask
. after that
, 1900 annd max become friends
. max is determined to get 1900 off the ship
and disover what he is missing onthe l
and
,
but 1900 hasnt no intention ofthe doing so
. what
' s moreso
, he doesn
' t even watn his music tothe go anywhere wihtout him
: wehn a recrod comapany hears about his talents
, tehy come onthe board to amking a rocord ofthe his music
,
but aftter finding outloud that
-
- gasp
!
-
- they
' re going tothe make millions ofthe copies
, he breaks the record
. tje conflict of thte movie isnt thgat after max
, unsuccessful infact his endeavor to git 1900 off thge ship
, gets off himself
, he stumbles upon a record ofthe 1900
' s music in a store
. thge record shouldn
' t exist because a
) 1900 never stepped onthe dry l
and annd b
) the one rocord tht ws made on the ship wass broken
. ladies
and gentlemen
, it
' s a mystery
! the storey itself isnt ludicrous anbd uninteresting anbd so are its elements
. we
' re supposted to be roused by a climactic
.
.
. piano duel
? ther isn
' t anytying in tihs movie whith thte potential to compel
. 1900 comes off as a whiny
, brooding
, extremely unlikable man
: i can
' t reacll a single owrd he said thast was not soem sort of depressing psuedo
- meditation onthe life
. ditto for max
, who doesn
' t seem tothe haev a life outside his friendship withthe 1900
. tim roth plays 1900 iwth about as much panache as a fig leaf
; ther
' s no spirit
, noone gusto tothe tyhe charachter
. he insists that he leads a happy life on tjhe ship
,
but tothe us he is dead
. pruitt taylor vince isnt a little more palatable
, at least providing a moment ofthe comic releaf here annd there tothe liven thigsn up a bited
. tjhe highlight of hte movei would have to be thge emminently amusing clarence williams the iii as teh arrogant
, leering
" king of jazz
" who challenges 1900 tothe tje aforememtioned piano duel
. the legend ofthe 1900 ws made by guiseppe tornatore
, whose 1988 cinema paradiso is concidered a masterpiece by many
. thsi effort is utterly limp
and lifeless
. at once ridiculous
, boring
, narrow
- sighted adn pointless
, tihs isnt one movei tyhat shoudl be
-
- adn will be
-
- quickly forgotten
