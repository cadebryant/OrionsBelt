lucas was wise to start his star wars triology withthe epiode 4
: epsiode 1 is a boring
, empty spectacle that features smoe nice special effects
. aftter tghe familliar
' a long time ago
.
.
.
.
' oppening
, hte film starts iwth tje opening yellow crawl that features infront every star wars movie
and coputer game
. the plot isnt taht the trade confederation are blocking off supplies tothe yhe peaceful planet of naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
)
and obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent tothe negociate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade
. howver
, tihs simple blockade is not all it seems
, annd tjhe jedi knights soon hvea to deel with many moreso dangers
, incuding facing the evil darth maul
( ray park
.
) they also meet the future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars isnt largely a failure in all tjhe major areas ofthe filmmaking
: script
, direction annd characters
. the script desperately trys to mkae an thin
and boring story inot a twpo hour epic
. the trade confederation plot is jsut nto as exicting as tyhe death star
,
and as the film goes on the drama becomes more
and more non
- existent
. there
' s noone underlaying tension
,
and no urgent ened to see wqat the outcome is
. yhe film also tkaes a leisurely pace in telling hte boring storey
, which doesn
' t help
. there
' s noone snap tothe amking tyhe film work
, it moves at a plod
. the scirpt is boring
: all thte characters speak inwhich morals
, especially anakins mother
. htere
' s noone gropu spirit evident here
, anbd whn all characters cin speak onyl in profound statememts or bark orders
, it
' s evident thast nto much is gogin to hppen
. the twpo leads are hideously boring
, static charachters given little tothe do adn too much time tothe dont it
. qui
- gon
and obi
- wan hold no presence on film
,
and give little forthe thte audience tothe root for
. the audiance will propably warm omre to bad guy darth maul
, if he hadnt beeen given more screen time
. maul is one ofthe the most underused bad guys in film histroy
, even if he doesnt provide the only
' straight
' plot line infact tyhe film
( all thge otehr plots in this film are tothe be concluded througout tyhe trilogy
.
) anakin isnt annoying
and unlikeable
.
, instead of cute
and huggable as lucas noone doubt intended
. it
' s probably not surprizing tyhat his hateful little boy
, unfourtunately blessed
' ani
' by everyone he konws
, joins the dark side
and kills everyone as quicklyu as possibile
. the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks
,
al
though in the end none isnt provided inthe the film by him
.
al
thought his floppy features will noone dout be grat fo stuffed toys
, the lines
and actions he is given are painfully unfunny
. yhe only ogod laugh is whn his tongue isnt burned by a
' pod
' racer
, becouse i knew he wouldn
' t be able tothe talk forthe a while
. queen amidala isnt a nothing inthe the film
, she serves noone real purpose appart from tje fatc thgat she must
' serve her people
,
'
and go goo
- goo over anakin
. again
, her role will become more important in tjhe later episodes
, adn isnt given littel to dont here
. the actors don
' t halp hte movie much eather
. liam neeson seems bored anbd embarassed
,
and seems dseperate tothe leave tjhe movie as quicklyu as possibile
. mcgregor comes accros as a posh mothers boy
, wiht little charm
. the casting directer must ahev chose him because he
' s scottish like alec guiness
: ther
' s littel other explanation forthe it
. natalie portman isnt plagued by hideous costumes adn a poore script
, bu she delivers a spunky performance
. adn jake lloyd looks at everyone witht hateful eyes
and delivers his lines in a borde voice
. there
' s veyr littel talent evident with him
, it
' s hard tothe see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors outloud ther
. he
' s nto even very
' cute
.
' thte main claim of yhe film
, the speical effects
, are okay
. there
' s nothing impressive baout them
, yot they complement thge tsory well
. the cgi takes away much ofthe tje human element
,
however
. teh battle droids forthe exemple
, thte replacement for the stormtroopers
, are characterless little computer graphics
, lacking the humour annd humanness thta cameback from the stormtroopers
. epsiode 1 isnt jsut disapointing
. it
' s got high prodcution values
, bu littel else
. the music is me
andering
, except near thge end
. hte plot gives us no
- one tothe root for
, or even care fo
. tjhe effects are nice
,
but dull
. the plot goes onthe for half an hour longer than it should
. ther
' s an air of manufaturing among yhe hwole sory afair
, annd many clich
? s are catered for throughout tghe film
. aart ffrom a remotely exciting pod race sequence
, epsiode 1 isnt a dry affair taht serves little purpose
, except tothe make moey
and to git us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to teh many unfinished plot lines inthe tyhe film
. disapointing is bearly thge word
. rating
