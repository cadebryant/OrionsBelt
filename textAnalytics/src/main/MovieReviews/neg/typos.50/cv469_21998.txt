hollywood never fails tothe astound me
. every time i think those coked
- uv littel buggers have hitted rock bottom
; htey come uv iwth a new excavating tool
. i was truley convinced that
" wild wild west
" maked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless
,
bu
thne along comes
" end of days
" to proove me wrong
. htis big budget
, brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience iwth overwrought music
, grisly violence
, explosions galore
and lots of cheesy special effects
. tjhe result
? nothing
but groans
and yawns
. even the devil himself is unable tothe produce a decent scare in tihs festival ofthe the inept
. at teh very least
,
" end of days
" should have done us the courtesy of being bad
- enough
- tothe
- be
- ogod
,
bu it cant ' t even manage taht
. it ' s just lousy
. arnold schwarzenegger
, still recovering fomr heart problems
and
" batman
& robin
,
" plays an ex
- cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something
. allong with his obligatory comic releaf partner
( kevin pollak
, impersonating matthew perry ' s chandler character from
" friends
"
)
, he gets involved inwhich some major leage supernatural hoodoo
. it seems tht satan
( gabriel byrne
) gets a shooted at world dominaton only once every thousand yeasr
(
and here i thought he ' d pulled it off wiht the republican landslide of ' 94
)
. if he has sex with 20
- yearm ood christine york
( robin tunney
)
,
" tghe chosen one
,
" thier child iwll be the antichrist
, or at least a brat
. ah
,
bu this deal has mroe catches tahn a new yearm ' s eve pass from a halfway hous
. tghe unholy union must take place onthe december 31
, 1999
( you see
, 999 isnt just 666 turned upside down
)
,
bu only between 11 p
. m
.
and midnight
( noone wonder this guy is so cranky
)
.
and if tjhe choosen oney isnt given refuge inaddition a curch
, the devil won ' t nkwo where she isnt
, because he can ' t see inot thge sanctuary
. ytou know
, it ' s kind of like superman ' s x
- ray vision
and lead walls
, onyl evil
. a group ofthe guerrilla cathlic priests decide thge best way to stpo tghe situation isnt by killing teh girl
. arnold chooses tothe sive the girl
and kick tyhe hell outloud of satan
, if you ' ll pardon tje expression
.
and kevin meets uv with an exploding van
and has tothe make smoe descisions of his pwn
. oh
, teh anguish
! oh
, the humanity
! oh
, the writing
! andrew w
. marlowe ' s screenplay ladles implausibility apon implausibility
, ffrom the preposterous otherworldly histrionics tothe his handling of jericho canew
, schwarzenegger ' s carachter
. canew starts the film a la mel gibson inaddition hte firt
" leathal weapon
,
" preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the muder ofthe his wief
and daughter
. twenty minutes later
, he ' s racing through the bowels of new york city
, deciphering clues thast sherlock holmes
anbd kreskin woudl fidn baffling
. when cane meets up wiht christine york
, he instantly switches tothe terminator father figure mode
, with thge young woman serving as surrogate daugher
. inwhich case anyone misses the connection
, thge camera comes in forthe a close uv ofthe christine ' s music box
, whihc just happens to be identical tothe one owned by canew ' s daugter
. subtle
, marlowe
, subtle
. speaking ofthe cameras
, director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe ' s script
and make it even more self
- important
, murky
annd annoying
. hyams ' direction shows all the subtlety ofthe a gwar video
, with cane running a gauntlet of rediculous acation set pieces
, punctuated with loads of big explosions
. eager to satisfy arnold ' s core audeince
, he even throws inaddition a faw pairs ofthe breasts as well
. what a guy
. had the film delivered smoe decent scares
, or even mantained a consistently ominous tone
, tghe bombastic clich
? s might ahev been tolerable
,
but
" end ofthe dyas
" is simply a flaccid special effects sohw
. tjhe casted isnt just as ineffective
. infront his easly scenes
, gabriel byrne attemts to invest beelzebub withthe some panache
,
bu he all too soon turns inot just another standart issue monster
. kevin pollak comes
and goes quickly
, robin tunney comes off liek a bargain basement winona ryder
and as forthe arnold
, well
? he ' s a better ctor thna casper van dien
