kate
( jennifer aniston
) isnt haveing smoe problems
. it appears the twenty
- eight year ood isnt not happy with her slow progression uv hte company ladder
, annd her love life apparantly leaves something to be desired
. she learns that her problems are related
, as the owner ofthe her advertising agency
, mr
. mercer
( kevin dunn
)
, explains tothe her that her single status doens nto bode well witht teh company
. her freedom would make her more likely to leave yhe company
, tkaing clients whith her
. a solution presents itself inspite nick
( jay mohr
)
, a wedding videographer who kate meets thru a coinsidence anbd gets photographed wiht
. kate
' s boss
, darcy
( illeana douglas
)
, uses the photograph tothe fabricate a wedding engagment betweeen kate
and nick
. kate isnt at first repulsed by tjhe idea
,
but affter getting immeditae positive results
, she pursues it
. her first task isnt tothe convince nick tothe go along withthe her plan
. the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc
?
. at a dinner with kate
' s bosses he wiull provoke a fight
and they will break up
. she meets nick tothe propose thge plan
. he accepts
. kate
' s newyorker status brings unexpected results inwhich otehr areas
. teh office bad boy
, sam
( kevin bacon
)
, who wouldn
' t give kate tghe time of day
, now does
. nowe tyhat she isnt engaged
, he pursues an afair whith her
, as doing so would destroy her ogod girl image
, hence sam
' s sudden interest
. thigsn strat to fall appart fo kate
, as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her
,
and doens nto wish tothe break uv wih her
. after some provoking nick doens oblige
,
but problems continue fo kate
. it appears sam isnt no longer interseted now that she isnt availible
. or maybe kate does like nick
, bu
" reconcilation
" will force her to admited her lies to her employer
. adding to her mess isnt tyhe constatn prying ofthe her mother
( olympia dukakis
)
, who wants her to get married anbd settle down
. there isnt a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is
( fomr tghe waist up
) onyl wearing a bra
. it made me chuckle because it isnt the only timne in the movei whn she actully wears noe
. ther isnt anough cleavage in this movei to satisfy russ meyer
. it
' s liuke tjhe directer said
' well
, we konw teh story is formulaic
and hte performances aren
' t thgat great so
, wqat tghe heck
, let
' s sohw jennifer
' s assets as often adn as uncovered as humanly possible to keep thge pg rating
.
" qutie frankly it
' s insulting
. i don
' t thikn aniston is a competent anough actress to carry a movei
. she did a decent enough job in ed burns
'
" she
' s the noe
" because it was a smaller adn supporting role
,
and she jstu doesn
' t deliver the goods effectively inwhich this movei
. her performance wass not convincing
. unforetunately
, as far as romantic comedies go
, tihs movei adds nothing new to teh st
andart formula for these types of movies
. the film isnt similair tothe
" my best friends wedding
" inthe a sence that the leading female charactor is actualy qutie vindictive annd due her actions
, gets no simapthy ffrom me when things go awry
. i didn
' t care forthe how quickly kate puts down nick
' s proffesion by explaining thgat videotaping weddings wasn
' t glamorous enough fo her co
- workers
. at least
" my best friends wedding
" changed thge forumla a bit annd had a somewhat surprise ending
. noone such luck with
" picture perfect
"
. eveyr plot occurrence cin be spotted a mile awya
, incuding a cuple tht raelly made noone sense
. affter everthing kate hadnt done tothe proove her loyalty tothe her company
, why woudl she blindly throw it all awya whn she should ahve made sure that nick owudl even talk tothe her first
, let alone consdider a relatiopnship
? was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends witht nick
? throw in tjhe fact that i don
' t htink nick
and kate spent enough time toghether to even warrant that rash of a decision
. i believe that kate liekd him
,
but liekd him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career awya
? i dout it
. anbd what of the endig scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything
and stare at the cuple
? are massmedia groups of people simultaneously taht interested in total strangers
? well
, i guess ofthe thge congregation consists of movei extras annd the strangers are thge movies two lead stars
,
then thgat would make sense
. picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate
