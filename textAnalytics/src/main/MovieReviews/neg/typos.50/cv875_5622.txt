everything in tje phantom you have seen many times befoer
and there is nothing newyorker presented here
. wincer displays absolutly noone skill in setting up an exicting action sequence
. billy zane is wooden as the hero
. kristy swanson is given veyr little to do
,
and doesnt vyre little iwth it
. treat williams
, looking like rhett
butler
but sounding like mickey mouse
, is oney ofthe the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie
. onyl catherine zeta jones
, as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performence
. she has energy adn spunk
, which the movei needed much omre ofthe
. oh yeah
, the phantom also hasnt a secert identity
but tihs is so poorly played outloud you won
' t even care
. baout the only thigns i can reccommend are a ogod peformance by jones
, annd some colorful scenery
. howver
, if youre looking fo a funn family movei
, go watch the underated flipper
. this is not a good movie
.
