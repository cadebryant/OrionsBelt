everything infront the phantom yuo have seen many times before
annd htere isnt nothing newyorker presented here
. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting uv an exciting acation sequence
. billy zane isnt wooden as yhe hero
. kristy swanson is given vrey littel to do
,
and doens veyr little with it
. treat williams
, looking like rhett butler
but sounding like mickey mouse
, isnt noe of tje worst villains i have ever seen in a movie
. onyl catherine zeta jones
, as one ofthe williams cohorts turns in a ogod performance
. she hasnt energy
annd spunk
, whlch the movie needed much moreso ofthe
. oh yeah
, teh phantom aslo hasnt a secret identity
bu thsi is so poorly played outloud yuo won ' t even care
. about tyhe onyl things i cin reccommend are a good performance by jones
,
and soem colorful scenery
.
howver
, if youre looking fo a fun family movei
, go watch the underated flipper
. this isnt not a good movei
