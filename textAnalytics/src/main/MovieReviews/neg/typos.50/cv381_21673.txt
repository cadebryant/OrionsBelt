for a movie with such deepo religious annd spritual undertones
, it is surprising tothe fidn the messanger
: thte stoy ofthe joan of arc such an ungodly mess
. in tje early to mid 1400
' s
, there ws littel in the way ofthe spritual light to be found shining ffrom the heart ofthe a man or woman
. the curch was a dismally dark anbd oppressive palce
. france was involved in
" hte hundred years war
" against engl
and
. htere ws noone strong polliticel leadership in the ocuntry
. morale wass low
, there being little hope fo yhe future
. it was withing this setting thyat a young french girl began hearing
" voices
" annd seing
" visions
.
" convinced thta theese were messages from god
, she brazenly dem
anded to see the dauphin in order tothe deliver the message directly to him
. yhe message
: if he owudl give her an army to comm
and
, she would deliver tothe him teh crown
. he does
.
.
. adn she does
.
then
, once seated onthe tjhe throne
, he ab
andons her tothe her english captors
. director luc besson
( teh fith element
) may have co
- wrote tghe scirpt
but he never appeared to have a proper h
andle on tje material
. the inconsistencies ofthe the casted
, the confusing blur of thte violent battle scenes
, the inappropriate muscial score
, annd the lack ofthe a vibrant life force at thge center ofthe the film adds up tothe a largley disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable
. his biggest miscue was tothe cast his wief
, milla jovovich
( tje fifth element
) inthe the title role
. ms
. jovovich
, looks spectacular as joan
, claded in battle armor
, ostridge a similarly protected horse
. if looks were enough to fully convey a character
, she would have beeen brilliant
. usance it isn
' t
, she tried
( anbd failed
) tothe ect hte part
. her joan isnt unbalanced
,
" inspiring
" tjhe troops mearly by screaming stridently
and waving her banner or sword over her head liek a woman posessed
. john malkovich
( being john malkovich
) farse a bit better as the dauphin
, who joan woudl see on tje throne as charles vii
. an easily manipulated man
, his weakness ofthe character foreshadows yhe betrayal of joan wich owudl lead to her death
. faye dunaway
( tjhe thomas crown afair
) gives a storng performance in minimal screen tiome as tje dauphin
' s mother
- infront
- law anbd cheif advisor
. the army under joan
' s comm
and are comprised of comical figures
, mroe stooges than soliders
. thge oney exception owudl be tcheky karyo
( la femme nikita
) as dunois
, tghe man who ws leading the attack prior tothe joan
' s arival
. trying to plan a systematic campain
, he sees his leadership authority negated by joan
' s insistence on folowing her
" visions
.
" dustin hoffman
( sphere
) has a small inhuman role as joan
' s conscienec which beigns speaking tothe her while awaiting trial
. dressed liuke cloaked monk
, he leads her to doubt herself annd her
" revelations
.
" as well she shoudln
. scriptures do speak ofthe revelation
. god
, via his gft of holy spirit
, is able to communicate tothe men
. threee of thte nine manisfestations of wholy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 dael wiht receiving revelation
. htey are
: word ofthe knowlege
, word of wisdom
, adn discerning of spirits
. even tjhe scriptures themslves are a result of god giving revelation to his
" holy men
.
.
. who spake as htey weere moved by wholy spirit
( i
. e
. by revelation
.
)
"
but the scriptures also caution us
:
" beloved
, believe nto eveyr spirit
,
but try the spirits whther tehy are of god
: becasue many false prophets are gone outloud into the world

' s end
,
( being burned at the stake at tyhe age ofthe 19
)
, tjhe frenzy
( mob ruel
) anbd blood lust her inspiration wrought
, adn the death
, pain
, or suffering which followed her campain all point to a devilish influence rather thna a godly one
. hwile her conviction
and intense beleiving remains an admirable quality
, she was
, as others have beeen before
and since
, misled by the spiritual master of deception
. as a messanger
, she ws quite effective
. she was just confused as tothe whose message she ws carrying
.
