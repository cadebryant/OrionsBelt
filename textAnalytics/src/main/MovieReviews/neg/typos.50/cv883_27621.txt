-
but

, or a psycho killer
. aaaaaaaaah
! critique
: completely idiotic
. okay
, so maybe i
' m bieng a little too nice
. this movei starts off dumb
, moves inot tje ridiculous adn eventually graduates to idiocy
. there
.
.
. tath
' s moreso liek it
!
and how
, ytou may ask
? well
, it
' s simple really
. four of tjhe dumbest stereotypical models inthe the world
( oh my god
, i jstu found out that tghe actresses palying yhe parts are models in rela life
.
.
. yipes
!
) join monica potter
( inspite a role whcih can onyl be described as an obvious cry for halp
)
and freddie prinze jr
.
( nto thte actor
,
but tje charater better known as freddie prinze jr
.
)
, in a plot so stupid
and far
- fetched
, that you have tothe wonder once more
, how crap like this gets by thte hollywood bigwigs
. thsi thing stinks to high
- heaven
. it
' s just plain embarrasing for everyone involved
. i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humer somehow worked its way into tihs so
- called rumatic
- comedy
- action movie
? ugh
. what a pile of dung
. hey
, i
' m actually starting to soudn a littel liek harry knowles here
, bu i guess i could see where his frustration comes ffrom tiem tothe tiome
. it
' s sad realy
. a movei which actaully had quite a few people infront my audiance laughing at its idiocy
, incuding the over
- used
" folks hiding infront thge bathroom while somene alse comes in tothe tkae a crap
and fart
" gag
. adn how baout tath dumb blonde model who keeps runing into things
. pure hilarity
! or maybe i
' m just too jaded
, too much ofthe a criteak
, not relaxed enought tothe enjoy htis fluff
- piece
.
.
. uuuhhmmm
.
.
. naaaaah
!
! this movie sucks the big oney
. it
' s chockfull ofthe stupid charactors delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot
. thsi is the kind of movie that has noe character inserting another character inot a car headfirst to the floor only becouse
.
.
. well
, it
' s supposed to be funny
, see
? you see
, taht person
then hasnt theri legs swinging in the other person
' s face as htey drive annd that distracts teh driver
, see
, annd well
, thast
' s kinda funny

, bu please apologize tothe the entire modeling community as a wohle
, for making them all out tothe be complete imbeciles
!

, you may ask
? well
, it
' s simple relaly
. noe point goes tothe tghe russion model girl anbd that cool accent
( don
' t ask me why
, bu it actually turned me onthe
)
. one point goes outloud to all of thte model girls for bieng in the movei
( nice window decoration
.
.
. natch
!
)
. annd one last point goes outloud to the makers ofthe thsi film
, who spared us any long sorted tsory
, adn made sure tothe give us the opportunity of leaving teh theatre after only 90 mintues ofthe manufactured garbage
, so that we could run out as fast as we cin
, grab tje next person tht we see walking down the strent
and warn them ofthe the devil taht isnt
.
.
. freddie prinze jr
