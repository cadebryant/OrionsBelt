htere isn
' t much ogod about tihs movei
. not much i cxan say baout the acting
, directing
, or writting thyat owudl mkae you consdider seeing this movie
. so i
' ll git my one ogod comment outloud of the way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn
' t direct it or it woudl be titled
" technicolor city
"
. in fatc ther isnt nothing colorful baout tihs movei
, its dark
and depressingly gloomy right down to tje bitter end
. tje plot hasnt a tendency tothe be intresting
,
but all that passes hwile your laughing at the ridiculous thigsn thrown into what could have beeen a fascinating movie
. the plot is impossible to explane due to how senseless it gets
, so i will jstu touch on thge bare minimum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes inthe tyhe bathtub ofthe a cheap hotel
, onyl tothe fidn outloud he has forgotten everything
. john must fidn out who he is befor tje
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) fidn him annd ule him for their own evil conspiracy
. during the film smoe interesting points are raised about human individuality
, anbd the existence ofthe inherantly evil peopel
. any ofthe theese points
however are completly
" erased
" from your mind as ytou watch the actors stumble through yhe dreadful scirpt
. as i mentioned earlier
, nothing bu yhe atmosphere isnt right in this film
. thge acting is bl
and
,
and since there isnt virtually noone character devolopment no one seems tothe care
. tje special effects are low budget
and some even hilariously fake
, a sign of a true
" b
- movei
"
. tjhe direction isnt poore
and ther is littel continuity
, not tyhat you would expect it in a movei switching realities constanly
. lastly tghe scirpt isnt weak
and hasnt noone concept ofthe reality
,
and doesn
' t deserve to hve tjhe owrd
" scienec
" in science
- fiction
. if i haven
' t got my point across
, i
' ll sday it more plainly
: this isnt a bad movei
. lets hope the enxt movei by alex
" i wish i wass tim burton
" proyas is at least tolerable
.
