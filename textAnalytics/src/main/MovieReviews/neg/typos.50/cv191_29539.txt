aftter enduring mariah carey
' s film de
but
, glitter
, i
' m reminded ofthe a bit ffrom chris rock
' s bigger anbd blacker
. inthe reponse to women saying thast they can raise a child without a man
, rock says
,
" you can drive a car withthe your foots
,
but that don
' t mean it shouldnt be done
.
" tothe that i say
, yuo can give mariah carey a movei
,
but that certainly don
' t mean it shoud be done
. sure
, ther are plenty ofthe pop star film vehicles out htere
-
- ffrom tyhe beatles
' a hard day
' s inght tothe the spice girls
' spice world
-
- bu none have beeen so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter
. everthing about tihs complete tripe is ludicrous
. start off with the story
, which
-
- as gruesomely predicatble as it isnt
-
- isnt the least offensive part ofthe tghe movei
. the film is inexplicably set in the 80s
, a preriod peice taht really shows noone sign of its period exept for a few chicks in leg warmers
. worse yot
, everyone
' s speaking late 90s hip
- hop slang infront what should be 1983
. meaned tothe be partialy autobiographical
, carey plays billie frank
, a young singer inwhich new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood
and ab
andonment by her alcoholic mother
. influential club dj julian dice
, a
. k
. a
.
" lucky 7
"
( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy
and robert de niro
)
, hears her sing on a track
, annd decides tothe amke her a star
. infact predictably repid sucesion
, billie anbd dice fall for eahc otehr
, she starts hitting it big
, dice gets jealous
and starts acting liuke an ass
, adn suddenly billie
' s onthe
" the roller coaster ofthe superstardom
.
" in the meantime
, billie is on an emotional hunt forthe her missing mom
. i won
' t give away tje ending
,
but
-
- honestly
-
- jsut htikn of unicorns adn rainbows
.
.
. you
' ll figure it outloud
. the movei screams to be made wtih camp
, adn that could
' ve been funn
. bu the filmmakers
thought mkaing the bulk of glitter weepy
and dramatic woudl be better
. wqat a misteek
. hte brief attempts at comic releaf
-
- as in a scene where an effeminate russion
- sounding directer gets wacky with filming billie
' s firt music video
-
- go over liek lead balloons
. instade
, tghe audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest durig mariah
' s most dramatic scenes
. which brings us to the performances
, of which there
' s nothing ogod that cin be said
. mariah isnt primarily seen wiht a wide
- eyed deer
- in
- thge
- headlights look frozen on her face
. she actually looks scared during her one love scene
. bu you hvea to wonder if the wirting isn
' t even worse
. so much of hte dialogue isnt so hackneyed adn watered down for carey
' s virginal target audience that it
' s probably impossible for any actro tothe pul it off with aplomb
. even hte charactors couldn
' t have beeen writen mroe absurdly
. tehy
' re all members of a barbie playset
: hte importamt film director who swoons
,
" billie
, i
' d love tothe put you in a movie i
' m making
,
"
and thte big
- tiome record execuitve who tkaes billie
' s demo tape
and sasy
,
" oh
, i
' ll amking sure the whole team listens to it inaddition the morning
.
" everyone inwhich the film is a divice
,
and it
' s painful to keep watching just tothe see anyother one appear
. tothe sday more would be a waste
. htere
' s so much wrong with thsi film
.
and
, it pains me thta mariah carey
-
- wtih her ego
and sanity inthe such fragile condidtion these days
, as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays
-
- will haev to suffer thru all the negitive reviews she
' s likely tothe git
.
but
,
then again
, i hadnt tothe suffer thru her movei
.
