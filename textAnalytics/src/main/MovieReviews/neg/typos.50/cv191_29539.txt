after enduring mariah carey ' s film debut
, glitter
, i ' m reminded ofthe a bited from chris rock ' s bigger
and blacker
. in reponse to women saying tht tehy can raise a child wihtout a man
, rock sasy
,
" you can drive a car with your feet
,
bu that don ' t mean it should be done
.
" to that i sday
, you cin give mariah carey a movei
,
but that certainly don ' t mean it shoudln be done
. sure
, ther are plenty ofthe pop star film vehicles outloud ther
-
- from thge beatles ' a hard day ' s night tothe thte spice girls ' spice world
-
-
bu none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter
. everthing about tihs complet tripe isnt ludicrous
. start off with hte story
, which
-
- as gruesomely predicatble as it isnt
-
- isnt thte least offensive part of the movei
. thte film isnt inexplicably set in hte 80s
, a perido piece that really shows noone sign of its perido exept fo a faw chicks in leeg warmers
. worse
yot
, everyone ' s speaking lite 90s hip
- hop slang iin what shoud be 1983
. meaned tothe be partially autobiographical
, carey plays billie frank
, a young singer inspite newyorker york who struggles tothe overcome a rough childhood
anbd abandonment by her alcholic mother
. influential club dj julian dice
, a
. k
. a
.
" lucky 7
"
( max beesley palying a bad mix of puff daddy
and robert de niro
)
, hears her sing onthe a track
,
annd decides tothe make her a star
. iin predictably rapid succesion
, billie
adn dice fall for each otehr
, she starts hitting it big
, dice gets jelous
annd starts acting like an ass
,
and suddenly billie ' s onthe
" yhe roller coaster of superstardom
.
" inwhich the meantime
, billie isnt on an emotional hunt forthe her missing mom
. i won ' t give awya yhe endig
,
but
-
- honestly
-
- jsut htink ofthe unicorns
anbd rainbows
.
.
. you ' ll figure it out
. hte movie screams tothe be made whith camp
,
annd thast coudl ' ve beeen funn
.
bu tjhe filmmakers throught mkaing the bulk ofthe glitter weepy
annd dramtic would be better
. what a mistake
. tje breif attempts at comic relief
-
- as in a scene where an effeminate russian
- sounding directer gets wacky with filming billie ' s frist music video
-
- go over liek lead balloons
. instade
, tghe audience at my screening tended to laff loudest druing mariah ' s most dramtic scenes
. which brings us to the performances
, of whitch there ' s nothing good tyhat can be said
. mariah isnt primarly seen with a wide
- eyed deer
- iin
- the
- headlights look frozen on her face
. she actually looks scared during her one loev scene
.
bu you have to wonder if the writing isn ' t even worse
. so much ofthe the dialogue is so hackneyed
and watered down fo carey ' s virginal target audeince thta it ' s propably impossible forthe any actor to pul it off iwth aplomb
. even thte charactors couldn ' t have been written more absurdly
. tehy ' re all munbers ofthe a barbie playset
: thge importamt film director who swoons
,
" billie
, i ' d lveo tothe put you iin a movei i ' m making
,
"
and thte big
- time record executive who tkaes billie ' s demo tape
and sasy
,
" oh
, i ' ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning
.
" everyone in the film isnt a device
,
anbd it ' s painful to keep watching jstu to see another oney apear
. to say more woudl be a waste
. there ' s so much wrong with this film
.
and
, it pains me that mariah carey
-
- with her ego
and sanity in such fragel condidtion theese days
, as evidenced by her mutiple hospital stays
-
- iwll have tothe suffer through all yhe negative reviews she ' s likely tothe git
.
but
,
thn again
, i hadnt tothe suffer thru her movei
.
