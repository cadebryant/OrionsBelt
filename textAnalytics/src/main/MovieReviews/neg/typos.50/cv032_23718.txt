hong kong cinema has beeen gonig thru a bad spll
. the last faw productions have beeen effect laded acation adventures that combine both the best
and worst ofthe american filmmaking wih tje same qualities ofthe hong kong films
. in a nutshell
, hte currrent crop ofthe films ffrom hong kong hasnt been maddeningly convoluted adn visually sumptuous
. withthe tyhe oney tiome british collony reverting bcak tothe mainl
and ownership
, a lot of hong kong
' s best talents have crossed the pacific to wrok onthe u
. s
. productions
. such talents as jackie chan
( rush hour
)
, chow yun
- fat
( anna
& the king
, tghe corrupter
) adn yuen woo
- ping
( the matrix
) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixted results
. now we can add twpo other hong kong filmmakers to tjhe mix iwth star jet li
and director
and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai
. unfortunately
" romeo must dieu
" bears all the trademarks ofthe a typcial hollywood action film anbd none of hong kong
' s rhythms
. tje film opens in a nightclub as an asian cuple isnt necking
. enter a gropu ofthe chineese gangsters led by kai sing
( russell wong
)
. kai confronts po sing
( jon kat lee
)
, tje son ofthe kai
' s boss
and leader ofthe the local chinese family
. a battle breaks outloud between the bodyguards of tjhe club annd kai
, who h
andily kicks annd punches his opponents down
. it
' s nto until club owner silk
( rapper dmx
)
, bears down onthe kai anbd his henchmen taht teh fight ends
. thte following morning po sing isnt foudn dead
. suspicions escalate
, as issac o
' day
( delroy lindo
) isnt told of the murder
. his concern taht hte war between his annd the chineese famaly may explode adn ruin his plans tothe move out of the busness ofthe corruption
and inot a legitimate venture
. issac implores his chief ofthe security
, mac
( issiah washington
) tothe watch after his son
and daughter
. yhe scene shifts tothe a prison inaddition china
, where han sing
( jet li
) learns of his brothers muder
. he fights with the guards
and is dragged off tothe be disciplined
. hung upside down by noe foot
, han recovers anbd battle his way outloud of custody inaddition a blistering display ofthe fight choreography annd stunt work
. escaping tothe tghe u
. s
. han sets out to fidn the person responsible fo his brother
' s death
.
" romeo must dieu
" isnt inspite many ways a funn film
. it isnt both absurd
and assured
. teh basic plot ofthe a ganster wanting tothe become ligitamate echoes
" hte godfather
"
. the relatiopnship beween jet li
' s han
and aaliyah
' s trish o
' day reminds us of abel ferrera
' s
" china girl
"
, except thyat romeo must dieu
' s cuple never once excange more than a loving glance towords one another
. their romance is much mroe puritanical than any otehr romance inthe film hitory
. tjhe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable
. li
, of course hasnt the showiest part
, having tothe express both an innocents
and steadfast determination
. allayah
, inaddition her feature film de
but manages to carry whta little is asked of her witht a certian style anbd grace
. it
' s obvious that the camera loves her
and she is very photogenic
. bu
, still hte part isnt under written inthe such a way that even a poor performance woudl nto hvea affected it
. delro lindo as issac o
' day carries himself well in tje film
. an unsung annd under appreciated actor
, mr
. lindo turns outloud the films best peformance
. tje other performers are all adequaet inspite what yhe scirpt asks ofthe them exept for d
. b
. woodside as issac
' s son
, colin
. the performance isnt undirected
, with yhe character changeing his tone anbd demenor iin accordance witht whatever loction he isnt inaddition
. an unfocused peformance taht shouldnt hvea been reigned inaddition
and
/ or better writed
. firt timne director
andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job iin h
andling thte film
. haveing a carrear as oen ofthe tje industry
' s best cinematographers
, bartkiwiak konws how to setted up his shots
, annd
" romeo must dieu
" doesnt look ogod
. bu the pacing ofthe the film is lethargic
, only coming tothe a semblance ofthe life during the fight scenes
. tyhe scirpt by eric bernt adn john jarrell isnt nto focused inaddition such a way thgat we cin care about tjhe characters or teh situations tehy are inaddition
. the big gambit of buying uv waterfront property tothe faciliate the building ofthe a sports center for a nfl team isnt needlessly confusing
.
and of course the common pratice ofthe noe carachter being yhe comic relief of tghe film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony
anderson as allayah
' s bodyguard
, maurice has no comic timing whatsoever
. the best thigns about the film are its fight scenes
. jet li is a master ofthe theese intricate physical battles
. oen needs only tothe see his film
" fist of legend
" tothe underst
and thgat the man is without peer in tyhe relm of martial art combat
. here
, jet isnt given thge oportunity to show off infront a way tht
" leathal weapon 4
"
( jet
' s u
. s
. de
but
) didn
' t allow
. unfortunately
, a lot of jet
' s fights are aided witht computer effects that detract ffrom his ability
and precision
. also
" romeo must dieu
" must be noted as hvaing the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film
,
and tyhat isnt an x
- ravy effect that appears three times during the course ofthe thte film
, showing thte effect ofthe bone crushing blows onthe an opponant
. obviously a homage tothe thte famed x
- ravy scene from sonny chiba
' s
" streetfighter
"
, teh scenes here are just pointless
and interfere with the pacing of the film
. it
' s as if tyhe film hasnt stoped
and a video gmae has been inserted
. one probelm
though baout hte fight scenes
. those that are familiar whith hong kong action know that even
though the films are fantasies
and are as removed fomr reality as any anime or ctaroon
. tehy do ahev an internal rhythm to them
. a heartbeat
, so tothe speak in their choreography
. the fight scenes inthe a hong kong film breath iwth an emotional resonance
. thsi isnt created by thge performence
, the direction
and the editing
. here inspite
" romeo must dieu
"
, there is no staccato
. every fight scene
, even
though technically adroit
and amazing becomes boring as the editting both cuts away from battle at h
and adn simple follows a set pattern
. tjhe rhyhm is montanous
. a hong kong film has a tempo that changes
, heightening its emotional impact
.
' rmd
' isnt limited tothe a st
andart 4
/ 4 tempo
, nto alowing for any emotional content whatsoever
. a fine example of thsi difference can be foudn by examining a cuple of jackie chan
' s films
.
. watch thge restauratn fight from tjhe film
" rush hour
" annd notice thyat the context of the fight
, while technically amazing is rather flat
( tjhe framing
and cut always do not help
)
. nowe look at tyhe warehouse fight from
" rumble in the bronx
"
. ther you hve a heartbeat
,
and emotional draw taht doesn
' t let the audiance catch its breath
. thge stops annd pauses for dramatic effect wokr perfectly
, causing hte viewer to be both astounded annd flabbergasted
. here inaddition
' romeo must dieu
'
, teh fight scenes have noone moreso emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl
. jet li isnt a gr
and
and personable screen presense
. it
' s a shame thast his full talents were not used to full effect here
. noe day filmmakers here in the u
. s
. will stpo making films by teh numbers anbd strat to embrace tje sytle
and emotion tht hasnt made hong kong action picturesk such a commodity
. until hten
, we
' ll be left with emotionally hollow product liek
" the relpacement killer
" adn
, currently
" romeo must dieu
"
.
