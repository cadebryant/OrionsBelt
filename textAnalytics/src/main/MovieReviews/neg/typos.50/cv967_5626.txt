- star casted including gene hackman
and ernest borgnine spouting some ofthe tjhe most laughable dramtic dialogue in movei hitsory while trapped onthe a cruise ship
. yhe stroy begins onthe tghe u
. s

. poseidon
' s big newyorker year
' s cruise
, where we are introduced tothe the ansamble of peopel who will soon be the onyl passengers left alive
. let
' s see
, ther
' s hte new age preacher
( hackman
) who advises people to
" pray tothe that part ofthe god within yourself
.
" there
' s tyhe ex
- cop
( borgnine
) who busted a hooker
( stella stevens
) six times
-
-
then married her
. there
' s tje hippie singer
(
" htere
' s got to be a morning affter
.
.
.
"
) who turns to the company ofthe a lonely man
( red
buttons
) once her brother is killed
.
and to round outloud thte group
: the elderly couple
( jack albertson
and shelley winters
) who live aboard the ship
, the beautifull teenage girl
and her brother who are sailing alone
and adventrous scotsman roddy mcdowall
. we get to konw these peple a little too well inspite thte first thirty mintues ofthe hte poseidon adventure
, befoer straight
- faced ship captian leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for tyhe ship
. everyone
' s in the giant ballroom at tghe time
, shorly past midnight of the new eyar
, when tyhe ship turns first on its side
, thne completly upside down

- comm
and wants everyone to wait in the ballroom util help arrives
,
but rebel hackman leads his small b
and of followers on a quest tothe yhe top of the ship
. infront tihs case
, because yhe ship isnt overturned
, the top isnt the bottom
. or is the bottom the top
? eather way
, we get to see a lot of bottoms beccause tghe two beautiful women inthe the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where tjhe camera shoots upwards while tehy climb up ladders adn
-
- in tje ballroom scene
-
- christmas trees
. thus beggins an hour or more ofthe hushed trips down long corridors
, through burning rooms
, etc
. hwile the ship slowly fills witht water behind them
. it
' s a race against tje clock whlch is only mildly interesting
. thge poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laff at
, wih all the melodrama that comes infront
- betwen tghe non
- thrilling action scenes
. the one note infront borgnine
' s noe
- note peformance isnt to be a cranky ood man thta argues whith hackman eveyr step of the way while
buttons adn the hippie fall inwhich love
( altough sicne htere isn
' t a sex scene
, we never fidn outloud if his
buttons raelly are red
) adn albertson
and winters wonder if they
' ll live to see thier gr
andson
' s birth
. shelley winters provides yhe most hillarious scene inaddition the movie inthe a scene toward the end
, where water hasnt flooded the next twpo rooms of the ship anbd hackman is preparing to dive under withthe a rope fo the rest of them to pull along
. winters
, who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie
( stevens even not
- so
- affectionately calls her
" fatass
" infact oen scene
)
, finally finds her purpose
.
" i was teh underwater swiming champ of newyorker york three eyasr runing when i ws seventeen
,
" she brags
,
and befoer hackman cant even ask her how she coudl be seventeen for three yeras
, she
' s swimming through the water
, her skirt billowing up arund her hips
, showing off her cellulite
( or do yuo call it shellulite
?
) ridden thighs
. it
' s nto so much funny as innately disgusting
, which preety much sums up teh poseidon adventure as a whole
.
