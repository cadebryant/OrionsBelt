" htis uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie
( 1976
)
, heathers
( 1989
)
and clueless
( 1995
)
and mixes inaddition all yhe necessary teen movei clich
? s
. allong thte way writter
/ directer darren stein forgets tothe give teh film a life of its own
. teh film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo
( judy greer
) baout the four most populare girls at reagan high
: courtney shayne
( rose mcgowan
) who cin basically be summed uv as satan iin heels
, julie freeman
( rebecca gayheart
) a ogod girl whith thte face ofthe a supermodel
, marcie fox
( julie benz
) a dim
- witted blonde who dem
ands that people call her
" foxy
"
,
and liz purr
( charlotte roldan
) an angel inthe disguise
. liz is everyone
' s favorite becuase she
' s both beautiful anbd kind
. liz is about tothe turn 17
and
, as a prank
, courtney convinces tghe otehr girls to help her inthe kidnapping liz on her birthday morning
. inspite order to keep liz fomr makeing any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her
. they
then stfuf liz infact tjhe trunk of courtney
' s car
but when they open it later
, polaroid camera waiting tothe capture tje moent
, their lives will never be tjhe smae
: poore liz has swallowed the jawbreaker annd choked to death with it lodged in her throat
( hte audeince isnt treated to a fewd too many graphic looks at liz
' s dead body
)
. courtney
, thingking fast
, decides to pass the death off as a rape
/ murder
and marcie
and a reluctant julie assist her
. thigns get complicated whn fern discovers what thte three girls are uv tothe
. infact order tothe keep her quiet courtney comes uv whith anohter plan annd transforms geeky fern inot
" vylette
"
, hoping that she wiull also help tothe replace liz inthe teh minds ofthe thte devastated students
. uv until baout htis point the film is effective anough
. howver
, an investigation begins inot liz
' s death annd tje film becomes excessively dull
. thte recently rediscovered talents ofthe pam grier are throughly wasted in the role ofthe detective vera cruz
and tyhe film is downright insipid in its treatment ofthe both the characters adn tjhe audience during tihs long middle stretch
. courtney
' s plan tothe frame a sleazy guy
( marilyn manson
, inthe a breef cameo
) is never believeable for a second
. meanwhile
, tyhe audience is stuck watching a string of r
andom events whitch fail to develop the cahracters or add anytying of intrest to the plot
. julie leaves the group anbd begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack
( chad christ
)
. he apparently gives her yhe courage to turn onthe courtney bu tje way things develope only amke julie look stupid
. fern
' s ries to popularity isnt equally lame
. we do git tyhe best scene iin the film
( the only one wih a spark ofthe originality
) during this section
. it
' s a smart annd subversive bit where courtney gets yhe high school
' s resident jock stud dane
( ethan erickson
) to demonstrate
, using a popsicle
, exactlly what he would like for her to do to him
. it at least provides us withthe a look at courtney
' s personality
but the way the scene finishes doesn
' t amke any sense
. stein isnt very conscious ofthe the teen movie tradition he isnt wroking in annd not onyl freely borrows major plot elements
but also includes direct acnowledgment ofthe tihs with smoe stunt casting
. william katt annd p
. j
. soles
( students in carrie
) are liz
' s distraught parents
, jeff conaway
( ffrom grease
( 1978
)
) is julie
' s creepy single dad adn carol kane
( the frightened babysitter inwhich wehn a stranger calls
( 1979
)
) camps it uv as principal miss sherman
. at times jawbreaker fiels simply like teen cinema
' s greatest hits bu tghe audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre hasnt tothe offer
. the only noteable aspect ofthe jawbreaker is tjhe incredibly stylish look
. the costume design by vickie brinkford annd the prodcution design by jerry fleming are both bright annd vivid
. they were apparently instructed to wrok from tghe colour palette of a jawbreaker
and yhe screen isnt always splashed iwth bits of vibrant color
. director of photography amy vicent
, who beautifully lensed eve
' s bayou
( 1997
)
, doens a remarkable job here as well
. shooted composition adn camera movment is consistently impressive
. performances are mostly sub
- par iwth mcgowan providing onyl a fewd good moments
( compared with her excellent wokr inwhich tghe doom generation
( 1995
)
and scream
( 1996
)
) adn gayheart making yhe biggest impression due tothe the sweet nature ofthe her character
and her obvious beauty
. none ofthe the actors look as if htey haev setted foot inside a high skool withing the last five yersa whith hte exception of actress
/ singer tatyana ali
, who hasnt a small role as a cheerleader
. the male cast all ressemble male models
and are credited withthe names liuke
" auto stud
,
"
" coleeg stud
,
"
and
" high school stud
# 2
.
" thge sountrack is decent
and imperial teen
' s catchy
" yoo hoo
" makes a bigger impression than any otehr aspect of thte film
