it was with gerat anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premeired onthe american cable
. the acadmey award winning film had been highly acclaimed
. it allso featured the music of one of my favorite film composers
, james horner
. wqat i was inthe fo ws a disapointing annd overlong film which was anything
but hte best picture ofthe 1995
. whta drags braveheart down is its screenplay
. it abounds wiht high production values
: john toll
' s award
- winning cinematography
( wich alsot graced edward zwick
' s 1994 legends of the fall
)
, a gorgeous score by horner
,
and the sort of logistics thyat amking ytou wish assitant directors weere household names
. bu htis doens not savve a misguided script
. the film wishes to paint its central chracter as a hero
, bu teh viewer
' s onyl responce tothe his
" heroism
" isnt intellectual
: william wallace
( producer
- directer mel gibson
) is fighting forthe freedom adn againnst tyarnny
, so we hvae tothe root fo him
. bu wallace
' s actions paint a different story
. he speaks ofthe freedom adn acts ofthe vengeance
.
though one intellectually realizes wallace isnt onthe yhe right side
, tje film paints an unconvincing emotional portait
, in which wallace is jsut not as bad as the english king
. wallace speaks of freedom
, bu his acts point towrad vengence
. after kicking tjhe english out ofthe scotl
and
, he decides to invade engl
and
. htis isnt evident of a
" spartacus complex
"
,
and this exemple applies both historically
and cinematically
. thte historical spartacus at noe point moved from liberating slaves tothe sacking roman cities
; tghe film spartacus
, liek braveheart
, hasnt high prodcution values
and competent performaces
and is dragged down by an awful screenplay
. it isnt a shame thgat such an exellent score is part of such a terrible film
. horner
' s score tries tothe amking emotional conection
,
but the performances
and tjhe script do not halp
. gibson portrays wallace inthe such a way that hte audiance cannot relate to him or idenify with him
. htis drags down any emotional connection tothe the film
' s plot
,
and turns threee huors into a total waste of tyme
.
