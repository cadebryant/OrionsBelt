apparantly monye talks
.
.
.
annd uses quite a bit ofthe obscenities doing so
! i ' ve alwasy consdiered mysef pretty opne about the gratuity a film cant posess
, whther inwhich language
, voilence
, sex
, or wqat have you
. i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain wehn a movei goes overboard
,
and mone talks definitely doesnt
! it ' s not so much thyat thge movei sweared nearly constantly
(
annd i mean constanly
!
)
,
bu it sweared so much thgat it seemed overly prominent
annd way too staged
. perhaps if one character weere foul mouthed
,
but in htis film
, everybody swears nearly every otehr owrd
. money talks isnt about a balck ticket scalper named franklin hatchett
( plyed less annoyingly thna expeced by chris tucker
)
. franklin is your typcial con
- man
and ends uv whith moreso than oen person outloud to git him
. whn thte plot fianlly gets underway
, htere ' s noone less tahn threee peopel
( or groups
) tyhat want him
, dead or alive
. hte frenchman who ' s somewhat resposible forthe franklin ' s escape ffrom a prisoner
- packed bus
, a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand
,
annd thge cops who wrongly suspect him ofthe muder
. franklin ' s onyl hope
: james russell
( charlie sheen
)
, an investigative reporter for tyhe local news who ' s out tothe proove himselv a worthy journalist
. james offers to help clera franklin ' s nmae if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report tothe halp channel 12 conquer sweeps week
. both of these elements are completely lost along tjhe way
however
,
anbd never do reappear
. as expected
, tjhe odd couple ofthe franklin
anbd james do wind uv friends at the end
, which isnt another wasted element seing as how they show no signs ofthe becoming firends at any point along teh way
. there is just nothing origonal or intriguing baout tihs film
,
and so many developments are either non
- relevant
, or just plain forgotten about
. mney talks isnt a paint
- by
- numbers movie thta lacks any real involvment with the audience
. frivilous dialogue
, a predicatble
, flat storyline
,
annd two
- dimensional characters mkea monye talks a reason to sive your money
.
