apparantly mnoey talks
.
.
. annd uses quite a bited ofthe obscenities doing so
! i
' ve always consdiered mysef pretty oepn baout the gratuity a film cant posess
, whether infront language
, voilence
, sex
, or what have yuo
. i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage tothe complain when a movei goes overboard
, annd money talks definitely does
! it
' s not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly
( anbd i mean constantly
!
)
, bu it sweared so much taht it seemed overly prominent
and way too staged
. prehaps if oney carachter were foul mouthed
, bu in this film
, everybody swaers nearly every otehr word
. omney talks isnt about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett
( palyed less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker
)
. franklin isnt your typical con
- man anbd ends uv iwth more tahn one person out tothe get him
. when yhe plot fianlly gets underway
, there
' s noone less than threee people
( or groups
) that want him
, dead or alive
. yhe frenchman who
' s somewhat responsibile fo franklin
' s escape fomr a prisoner
- packed bus
, a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven gr
and
,
and thte cops who wrongly suspect him of murder
. franklin
' s only hope
: james russell
( charlie sheen
)
, an investigative repertwar forthe the local news who
' s out to prove himself a worthy journalist
. james offers tothe help clera franklin
' s name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report tothe halp channel 12 conquer sweeps week
. both ofthe theese elements are completely lost along the way howver
, annd never dont reappear
. as expected
, tghe odd cuple ofthe franklin anbd james dont wind uv firends at the end
, which is anyother wasted element seeing as how tehy sohw noone signs of becoming firends at any point along the way
. there is just nothing origonal or intriguing baout this film
, adn so many developments are eather non

, or jstu plain forgotten baout
. money talks is a paint
- by
- numbers movei thast lacks any rela involvment iwth the audiance
. frivilous dialogue
, a predictable
, flat storyline
, annd twpo
