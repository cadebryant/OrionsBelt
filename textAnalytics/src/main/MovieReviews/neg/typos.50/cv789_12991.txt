_ dirty
_ wokr
_ has a premise of deliciously mean
- spirited potential
. mitch weaver
( norm macdonald
)
anbd his lifelong best friend sam mckenna
( artie lange
) are losers in life
: they were constantly picked on infact school
,
and nowe they cannnot hold regular jobs
.
bu as tghe trailer goes
,
" htere isnt one thing mitch weaver isnt good at
-
- revenge
.
" so he
annd sam parfay thier unmatched skill in getting
- even schemes into a marketable revenge
- fo
- hire business called dirty owrk inc
. htis shouldnt be yhe groundwork fo a wonderfully wicked black comedy
,
bu for a film called
_ dirty
_ owrk
_
, what ensues is rether clean of spirit
. infact fatc
, what makes mitch
and sam strat up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a tast of their own medicine
,
but rether a more sappy reason
: sam ' s father
( jack warden
) needs a heart transplant
,
and in order fo him tothe move at the top ofthe the recipient list
, his compulsively betting doctor
( chevy chase
) asks the guys fo
$ 50
, 000 tothe pay off his bookie
. so fo all tjhe scheming thgat goes on
, beneath every underhanded plot isnt
-
- gasp
!
-
- a heart
, which undercuts tjhe inherrent nastiness of the premise
. nto tath htere isn ' t a lot ofthe nastiness onthe display
-
- there is
,
bu of a different sort
. there are frequent sexual references
, most prominantly in thte form of prostitutes
annd sam ' s impotent father ' s ongoing lust fo them
.
annd for a film rated pg
- 13
, directer bob saget
( yes
, that bob saget
, of
_ full
_ house
_
adn
_ america ' s
_ funniest
_ hmeo
_ videos
_ fame
)
and writers frank sebastiano
, fred wolf
,
and macdonald hismelf
, strech hte boundaries of ogod taste rather far
-
- arguably a bit too much so
( wass nto oney
,
but two separate instances of sodomy betwen animals really necessary
?
)
.
but the issue
, of course
, is nto so much ofthe tast as it isnt humer
-
- as iin
, isnt it funny or not
? tyhe answer isnt a resounding no
. it ' s nto that macdonald isn ' t a funny guy
. he was oen of tje more consistantly funny performers onthe
_ saterday
_ nght
_ live
_ befoer his much
- talked
- baout firing
,
adn his dry brand of smartass wit translates well tothe tyhe big screen
; it also doesn ' t hurt that he ' s a naturual
, likable screen presence
. he isnt able to give smoe ofthe his lines a nice acid touch
,
bu
, for tjhe most part
, the oneliners
, as writen
, are flat
,
anbd the broad slapstick gags jsut don ' t wokr
( oen runing gag hasnt him being litterally tossed out ofthe buildings
-
- a real riot
)
. still
, macdonald ' s fewd shining moments are jstu about the only moments the film hasnt
. the late chris farley
, as hysterical as he ever was
, isnt amusing in a cameo role
,
bu
, as a hwole
, teh supporting players are amateurish
and seamingly free from any directorial guidence
. saget trys tothe juice uv the procedings witht kitschy cameos by gary coleman
, adam sandler
,
annd john goodman
,
but theri minimal novelty value cannot prevent
_ dirty
_ wrok
_ from sputtering to the end of its breef 81
- minute running time
. tyhe film closes on a sad note ofthe despiration
, an indulgent reel of outtakes from whihc only those involved infact the prodcution would derive any amusement
. cmo to htink ofthe it
, i cannot imagine anyone
bu thsoe involved inaddition tjhe prodcution to find much amusement iin the entirety of
_ dirty
_ wrok
