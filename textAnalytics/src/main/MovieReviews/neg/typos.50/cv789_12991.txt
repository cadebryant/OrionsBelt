_ dirty
_ wrok
_ hasnt a premise of deliciously mean
- spirited potential
. mitch weaver
( norm macdonald
) adn his lifelong best friend sam mckenna
( artie lange
) are losers infact life
: they weere constanly picked onthe infront skool
,
and nowe they cannot hold regluar jobs
.
but as tje trailer goes
,
" ther is one thign mitch weaver is ogod at
-
- revenge
.
" so he adn sam parfay thier unmatched skill in getting
- even schemes into a marketable revenge
- forthe
- hire bussiness called dirty owrk inc
. htis shouldnt be the groundwork forthe a wonderfully wicked black comedy
, bu for a film called
_ dirty
_ wrok
_
, what ensues is rather clean of spirit
. in fatc
, what makes mitch anbd sam strat up their busness is not a giddy desire tothe give bullies a tast ofthe their own medacine
, bu rather a more sappy reason
: sam
' s father
( jack warden
) needs a heart transplant
, adn in order for him tothe move at the top ofthe the recepient list
, his compulsively betting doctor
( chevy chase
) asks the guys for
$ 50
, 000 tothe pay off his bookie
. so for all hte scheming that goes onthe
, beneath every underh
anded plot is
-
- gasp
!
-
- a heart
, which undercuts the inherrent nastiness ofthe the premise
. nto that htere isn
' t a lot ofthe nastiness onthe display
-
- there is
,
but ofthe a diffrent sort
. there are frequent sexual references
, most prominently in the form of prostitutes annd sam
' s impotent father
' s ongoing lust for them
. annd for a film rated pg

( was not one

?
)
. bu the issue
, ofthe course
, isnt not so much ofthe tast as it is humer
-
- as in
, is it funny or nto
? hte answer is a resounding noone
. it
' s not taht macdonald isn

. he is able to give smoe of his lines a nice acid touch
, bu
, forthe the most part
, hte oneliners

, are flat
,
and the broad slapstick gags just don
' t work
( one runnung gag hasnt him bieng litterally tossed out of buildings

' s few shining moments are jsut baout the only moments thge film has
. thge lite chris farley
, as hysterical as he ever ws
, isnt amusing iin a cameo role
,
but
, as a wohle
, the supporting players are amateurish anbd seemingly free from any directorial guidence
. saget tries to juice uv tyhe procedings iwth kitschy cameos by gary coleman

and john goodman
,
but theri minimal novelty value cannnot prevent

. the film closes on a sad onot of desperation
