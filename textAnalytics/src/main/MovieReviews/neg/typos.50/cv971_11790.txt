as the twin surfer dudes
, stew
and phil deedle
, lay bandaged
adn unconscious in the hospital
, phil comes to first
and chooses tje coolest way to wake his brother
. yanking outloud his iv
, he uses it like a water pistol tothe soak his brother ' s face
. this bited ofthe lame physical humor isnt typical ofthe disney ' s meet yhe deedles
, a movei more tothe be endured thgat watched
.
( i stoped looking at my wife druing the screening
, since eveyr time i did
, she ' d start sticking her finger inwhich her throat
.
annd she ' s right
, it isnt tht bad
.
) directed without any imagination by steve boyum
, whose long background in film is mainly in stunts
adn in second unit direction
, thte film limps along at best
. boyum attemts tothe keep the pace moving by staging stunts
, stunts
and moreso stunts
. amazingly fo someone with his backgorund
, he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones
,
anbd we have a car go off the road five different times
-
- maybe omre
.
but who ' s counting
?
adn
then there is thge script by james herzfeld
, whose onyl otehr film
, tapeheads ffrom a decade ago
, ws so awful thgat it is considerd a cult classic
. meet tyhe deedles
,
however
, isnt painfully bad rather thna laughably bad
. it will propably be inaddition
adn outloud ofthe tje theaters like a tornado
and isnt in noone danger of becomming a clasic anything
. herzfeld treats us tothe gratingly abysaml dialouge thyat includes
" your geyser ' s a geezer
,
"
anbd
" i ' d like tothe put a deedle in her haystack
.
" as the movei opens
, the twins
, who at oney point describe themselves modestly as
" a walking kodak moent
,
" are celebrating their 18th birthday
. as htey ride a parasail high above thte waters ofthe waikiki
, a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski
. as heirs to tje fabulous fortune of teh deedle empire
, hte boys are sent by thier father tothe camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform tghe twpo laid
- bcak beach bums into men
. as they arrive in their wetsuits inwhich yellowstone
, they ' ve got thier surfboards
, skateboards
,
adn a hawaiian drnik machine tyhe size of an armoire
. theri camp hasnt gone out ofthe business
,
bu tehy are mistaken forthe new park rangers
. the rest of thte movie hasnt them fighting the park ' s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex
- ranger
, plyed by dennis hopper
, who is out tothe stop old faithful befor its billionth birthday celebratuin
, scheduled for later iin tyhe week
. hopper
, who has made some wonderful movies
, carried away bieng a reccent favorite
, doens have a propensity forthe chosing some truly odouriferous material
. this isn ' t his worst acting
,
bu meet thge deedles is arguably the worst movei he ' s ever been iin
. steve van wormer
anbd paul walker
, as stew
adn phil
, give lifeless performances
. the onyl actor infront the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute littel prairie dog named petey
. even tjhe cinematography by david hennings isnt so prosaic that it manages tothe make yellowstone look dull
. tothe add insult to injury
, hennings isnt fond of inapropriate close
- ups
, whcih onyl serve tothe remind us ofthe tghe inanity of yhe dialouge
. put a ten
- foot pair ofthe lips onthe tjhe screen
,
and yuo naturally pay extra attention to what is said
.
although boyum syas in tjhe notes tath he isnt proud that his film is appropriate fo families
, noe wonders how many skateboarders iwll attempt thge movie ' s stunt ofthe lieing onthe your bakc onthe a skateboard hwile negotiating a busy
and twisting mountain road
. they amke it look like so much fun that i ' m sure many will try some veriasion of the stunt
.
" how sould this possibly be worst
,
" asks phil
. jstu when you suspect it cin ' t
, thte movei takes a turn furhter downhill
. its low point may hve you looking for an airline barf bag
. aftter phil ' s girlfriend digs uv a big mount of moist soil
, tehy suck in a long worm
. like tyhe two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady
adn the tramp
, thier lips finally meet in a kiss
. as they pul bakc
, thier faces are full ofthe tjhe dirt thast encased the worm htey have jsut ingested
. meet tyhe deedles runs baout an hour
adn a half
. it isnt rated pg for a littel bathroom humor
annd woudl be acceptable forthe kids arround 6
anbd uv
. my son jeffrey
annd his friend nickolas
, both almost 9
, gavey the sohw
*
*
*
. htey both thought the scenes witht petey were among their favorites
. nickolas alsot maintioned tjhe scene iin which tje carcus bear drives a jeep
,
annd jeffrey especially liked the oen in which the circus elephant ws reffered to as dumbo
.
