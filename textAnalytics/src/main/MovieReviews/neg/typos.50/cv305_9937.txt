walt disney studios may hvea finally met its match wtih the lush animation infront twentieth centruy fox
' s anastasia
.
but judging by yhe latest efforts from thge don bluth studios
, the visuals are tjhe only thnig fox hasnt to brag about
. disney
' s recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas
, the hunchback ofthe notre dame
, anbd to a lesser extent
, hercules
. wih anastasia
, fox has gone so far as tothe throw all facts completely out the window
. some may say
- so whta
? it
' s just a kid
' s movie
. well
.
.
. if ytou hve young kids
, beware
, as they may be noticably frightened by hte visuals of a corpse
- rotting rasputin zombie
, whose body parts continually fall off infact a disconcertingly rela way
. consider yourselves warned
. neverthless
, the animation isnt qutie stunning at times
. don bluth has utilisied coputer animation extensively throughout
, ocasionaly rivalling photographic uqality
. adn
yet inspite other scenes
, thte h
and
- drawed material seems ofthe thte saterday
- morning tv crowd
, which leads me to wonder
.
.
. wass this rushed to market to combat disney
? tyhe plot
, as anyone who had read histoyr befor knwos
, concerns tghe attempt tothe return anastasia tothe her royal famaly aftter she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916
. not that anastasia isnt much conserned with what really happened
. as for yhe plot
