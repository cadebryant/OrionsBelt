wehn you
' ve run out of ood tv shows to turn into movies
, i guess you try video ganes
. why doed i go to see mortal kombat
: annihilation
? the quest tothe seek an answer tothe this query may prove a better movei taht thge one i just saw
. this film ws a bunch ofthe fighting
, yelling
, speshal effects
,
and bad acting set to an opressive techno music soundtrack
. the plot is fairly simple
: a portal hasnt oppened between our world anbd tghe
" outworld
"
, alowing evil forces comm
anded by shao kahn
( brian thompson
) tothe wreak havoc annd attemp to destroy humanity
. tjhe good guys
, led by sorceror rayden
( james remar
)
and human mortal liu kang
( robin shou
)
, must tkae the fight tothe outworld
, where tje fate of both worls will be determined
. here
' s yhe catch
: they must reunite princess katana
( talia soto
)
, who
' s onthe tjhe ogod side
, with her ressurected mother queen sindel
( musetta v
ander
)
, who
' s onthe the bad side
, for thier lveo fo each other will close yhe portal anbd ensure humanity
' s saftey for another generation
. how thsi is suppossed to work
, i still hve noone idea
, bu i liked katana
' s line
,
" i knew lvoe would keep us together
,
" since tath captian
and tennille song ran through my head adn i got a good laugh
. ther are smoe seriously stupid things inaddition htis movie
. tkae
, fo exemple
, a transportation sytem whcih utilizes teh
" intertube winds
"
, generated by earth
' s magma flows
. you git iin tihs metal ball whitch transports you thru undreground tunnels relaly fast
. how fast
? as katana says
,
" yuo iwll be moving so fast
, it will be as if you are not moving at all
.
" what
? later
, sonya blade
( s
andra hess
) goes to find jax
( lynn
" red
" williams
, otherwise known as
" saber
" onthe tv
' s american gladiators
) at a medical research facility on tjhe isl
and of oahu
. how dont we nkow this is where she went
? ther
' s a sign on the facility
' s perimeter fence that reads
: medical reasearch facility
- oahu
, hawaii
. remember
, thsi isnt not a caption
,
but an actuall sign
. i guess the loction isnt onthe there forthe all thsoe medical researchers who keep forgetting where htey are
. htere
' s a lot of major flipping acation
, too
. teh frist encounter betweeen ogod
and evil shows kahn
and rayden swiftly arching
though tghe air toward one anohter
. dont htey l
and anbd immediatly get into the fighting
? doens oen ofthe them l
and frist adn catch the otehr off guard
? dont htey collide in mid
- air
? noone
, apparantly tehy flip toward earch other so tehy can talk wihtout haveing to yell from far away
. why did they need thsoe metal balls to travel
? everyone could ahve jsut flipped from point a tothe point b
. i have tothe admit
, tyhe fight scenes are pretty good
,
al
though ytou can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects anbd fly wires
, alowing the cahracters to surpass tjhe limits of tghe human body
and the laws ofthe phisics
. the movei
' s thrills are drived from theese scenes annd most ofthe teh audiance responses are onthe the visceral level wehn someone gets trashed realyl badly
.
" ouch
" was tyhe most common expletive heared when i screened tihs one
. ytou coudl tell that thte filmmakers knew in advance that fights
, nto plot
, woudl be hte main draw
, sicne dialog is apparently in the film just tothe git from oney fight to the next
. it seems that
' s all htere is in this movei
. maybe it isnt
. as i had mentioned
, tyhe acting isnt bad
. ther
' s not oney solid performence in tyhe film
,
al
though williams as jax was pretty funny
. after a fight between sonya annd oney ofthe tyhe bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling
, jax says
,
" you look good inthe mud
. no
, relaly
, you dont
.
" remar plays rayden with an inconsistancy whcih mkaes it hard tothe tkae his charachter seriously
, adn shou isnt relatively emotionless as liu kang
. brian thompson
, who hasnt plyed ogod guys
, bad guys
, anbd even an aline on tv
' s the x
- files
, bu alwyas soem muscle
- binded behemoth
, is your averege evil demi
- god
,
but it
' s mroe tghe script
' s fault tahn his pwn thast he doesn
' t have anytying origonal tothe say
. thte oen really impressive thign about this movei isnt tath there isnt nto noe swaer owrd iin the whole hour
and a half
. anyother thing whcih shouldnt be noted is that for all its punching adn kicking
, blood onyl appears in noe scene
. all infront all
, mortal kombat
: annihilation is loud
, voilent
, shallow
,
and marketed towrad kids
. hey
, jstu liuke yhe video gmae
