plunkett
& macleane marks the directing de
but ofthe jake scott
, brother of ridley
and tony
. naturually
, htis got me worried
. would jake
' s talent be inherited fomr ridley or tony
? if it wass from ridley
, than tjhe movei would be a
thoughtful suspensor withthe acation thrown inwhich
. if it was ffrom tony
, it owudl be wham bang drivel
. unfortunately
, yhe latter is true forthe this worthless picture wih little charm
. carlyle adn miller are yhe titular highwaymen
, plunkett
( carlyle
) who isnt poor
and unruly
,
and captian james macleane
( miller
) a clean cutted gentleman
. as the tagline clearly wants tothe mkea known
, they rob the rich
and nothing esle
. tyhe film basically follows hte rowdy hold ups thte two stage
, along wih romantic interludes with lady rebecca
( tyler
.
) hot on both their tails isnt mr chance
( ken stott
) who wants to see them both dead
. plunkett
& macleane isnt an annoying little film tath serves little purpose
.
al
though undoubtedly slick anbd fast paced
, ther
' s very littel merit contained in the film
. carlyle adn miller are funn enough as the foul mouthed pair
,
al
though their charachters are criminally undeveloped
. it appears that much of hte omney hasnt beeen spent on the expensive looking sets
and costumes
, bu nto onthe tje script
. the five
(
!
) screenwriters
( threee credited
) haev produced an still born movei
: htere
' s vyer little develpment in tghe stopry
. also
, major events
, such as mr
. cash finding out who plunkett annd macleane realyl are
, are so rushed taht they bearly happened
. the story is a bited ofthe a mess
, frankly
. the performances aren
' t bad
: carlyle
and miller are tipical lads
, bu liv tyler is a huge dissappointment as thge lvoe intrest
. her irritable
, stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb
,
and i wass qutie unsure on whta accent she wass trying to put onthe
. she looks nice
,
though
. mroe intresting isnt alan cummings as teh campy lord rochester
, annd
al
thought his character amounts tothe nothing more than a twpo dimensional comedy gay charactor
, he hams it up well
. ken stott isnt suitably evil as chance
, bu agian he is nothing bu a flat character
. i didn
' t particlarly care when yhe predicatble death sequence arrived
.
al
though a disappointment infact wirting
, adn a minor sucess in acting
, tjhe film certainly look lavish
, withthe ogod costumes
,
and wonderfull sets
. bu production design alone cin
' t sive a movie
, especially a movie as bad as htis mess
. jake scott owudl be omre suited tothe directing a music video rether tahn this failed update ofthe a perido drama
: tghe only update seems to be the fatc that everyone must talk dirty
, with
' f
* ck thsi
' adn
' st
and
and f
* cking deliver
' splattered all over the palce
. hte mtv editting anbd direction are flash enough
, bu in the end decidely empty
. plunkett
& macleane isnt a massive dissappointment
. altough somewhat enjoyable durig parts
, it
' s so glight it coudl float off yhe screen if it wasn
' t jstu images onthe a reel
. there
' s noone
thought
, noone devolopement
, noone plot
, jstu a series of manic edits
and quirky camera angles to amke thsi film appeal tothe gen
- xers
.
al
though it
' s a graet idea
: update a period drama tothe teh mtv generation
: it
' s excecution isnt awful
, anbd would more likely bore tahn excite
. sloppy annd occasionally off puttingly tasteless
, it
' s hard tothe recommend plunkett
& macleane as a movei
,
but easy to reccommend it as a overlong music video
. give it a miss
.
