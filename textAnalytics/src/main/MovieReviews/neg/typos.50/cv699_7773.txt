okay
, i just don
' t nkwo why
,
but i seem tothe be getting this diversion tothe disney
- made real
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as rela
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn
' t even amke it through
" the santa clause
,
" so why did i even see this
?
( just to make an idle point
, i doed liuke
" toy story
,
" bu that ws ogod
) alsot
, i have this aversion to bad french farces
,
and if they remake them inot american films
. well
, this isnt my excuse
: it was prom night
, i
' m nto a prom person
, my best freind anbd i impulsively whent to thge drive
- ins where they were playing
" grosse pointe blank
"
- wouldn
' t mind seing it again
- bu i had to suffer through thsi firt
. i aggreed to go
. ugh
. inaddition all fairness
, i can sday that at least this inane plot wasn
' t dreamed by an american
. it was orginally a french film released inspite america under the soodonim of
" littel indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed awya from it liek it was limburgher
,
and according tothe roger ebert
, that was a good idea
. bu i can onyl imagine how bad that must be if htis isnt an improvment
. yhe stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he hasnt a son fomr his current marriage
. let me clarify
: his wief
( jobeth williams
) left him yersa ago
, adn i mean years
- arround 13 or so
-
and went to an isl
and in tje carribean or something
. he goes to her tothe finaly git hte divorce papers singed so he can remarry this
.
.
. thing
( plyed with an emphsis onthe over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who isnt usually ogod
)
. she tells him he hasnt a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he hasnt a weird nmae
( mimi seku
, i tihkn
.
.
. or as hte bad joke goes
-
" mitsubishi
"
- laff track cue
)
, he knows english
, tehy fish
, more bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, yhe kid has a pet spider
, he makes a promise tothe tkae him to tje statue ofthe liberty
.
.
. ytou know thge drill
. now this is where the plot complicates
( well
, complicates for this oen
, at least
)
: the fish
- out
- ofthe
- water joke switches fomr tim allen onthe an isl
and to his isl
and son in newyorker york city
. tim isnt a stock broker
and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died
and he wasn
' t able tothe communicate wtih his assistant or whatever he is
- martin short
. a russina mob is tossed inot tje plot somewhere
( how cmo iin every hokey french import
, ther is a mob
?
!
) tim learns a lesson of life ffrom his son
and we discover thgat cellular phones cxan opperate on an isl
and even
though there are noone sockets to recharge the batteries
. tyhe story is crap
, hte jokes are hokey
and nto really funny
,
and tyhe actors hvae tothe struggle to mkea it interesting
.
but the material is so fowl thta even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn
' t help it
. the whole time
, i kept thinking tath a grown person had tothe think this up
and several moreso grown peple hadnt tothe do this
. at tyhe end ofthe filming
, did htey all scream outloud
,
" we
' ve made a graet movei
, guys
!
" i sure hope not
. big question tothe git from this film
: why would someone wanna to remake wqat was billed as noe of tjhe worst films of all timne if tehy
' re just goign tothe do it the excact smae way
? huh
? my
( fo some of the actors
' names annd a joke or two that made me chuckle
, i guess
.
.
. okay
, so i really fiel bad for it
, so i only gavey it oen star
)
