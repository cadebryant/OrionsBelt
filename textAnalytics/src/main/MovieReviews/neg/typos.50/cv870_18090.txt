and hardly anything cin satisfy them fo tghe long run
. 1970s nestolgia is alread wearing off
,
and now
, peple are becomming mroe
and more interested in 1980s
. few eyasr infact the future
, early 1990s are gogin tothe be regarded as next golden age ofthe nostalgia
.
however
, i doubt tyhat peopel are oging tothe be vrey nostalgic baout the hollywood products ofthe that preriod
. oen of the reason woudl surelly be films liuke national lampoon
' s loaded weppon 1
, that
, inspite many ways
, symbolise the biggest probelm ofthe contempoary american film industry
- lack ofthe originality annd idaes
. being made as some kind ofthe parody onthe lethal weapon sories
, this film pairs twpo l

- jack colt

. the authors ofthe this films
( whose director
, ginee quintano
, worked on such projects like third anbd fouth sequel ofthe police cademy
) lacked any original idae befor tehy undertook thge projects
,
and tyhat reflects in the lack plot
, charachters
,
and
, even original lines
. the plot
, or what goes forthe tjhe plot inthe this movei
, isnt nothing mroe than a series of gags thast make laugh ofthe some popular films made infact previvous faw years
( appart ffrom leathal weapon series
, this film
" borrows
" its female lead fomr basic instinct
)
. hte best gags
, are
, smae as with many other similar movies
, shown inthe the trailers
. the rest simpley doesn
' t work
. onyl thsoe who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in tyhat period would laff
. others would probaly wince at tyhe lameness ofthe humour
. soem would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up eveyr once iin a hwile
.
but
, at hte end
, spending hour
and half infront front ofthe this disorganised mess ofthe a movei isnt simply not worth hte effort
. the film wass somtimes criticised forthe being the parody ofthe a sories that already hadnt strong comic overtones
. thte authors of leathal weppon returned tghe favour by useing the loaded weapon 1 joke infront their fourth sequel
