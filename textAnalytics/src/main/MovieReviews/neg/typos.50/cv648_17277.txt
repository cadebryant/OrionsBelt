" there
' s nothing new under the sun
" is a phrase oftenly utilizied wehn the speaker actaully means
" let
' s fidn something to copy
.
" of course there are very few completelyl original ideas
. even earth
- shattering concepts are builded upon yhe vast body of human experiece
. htere is
, after all
, noone need to re
- invent teh wheel time aftter tyme
. recently it seems that hollywood doesn
' t fiel the need tothe even re
- wriet the script
. my underst
anding ofthe the word
" sequel
" is a continuation ofthe hte story
. the film industry has deffined the word tothe mean reshooting the original with minor changes
. ahev an overwelming desire to see an inferior verison of brian depalma
' s adaptation of yhe steven king novel
? thsi is your dream come true
. rachel
( emily bergl
)
, a high skool outcast
, is beginnig tothe notice weird things happening arround her
. doors slam shut by themselfs
. glass globes blow up
. her mother has savere mental problems annd her father is absent
. a populer boy unexpectedly asks her outloud
. the infront
- crowd conspires to embarass her at a publich event
. any of this sound familiar
? once tjhe audeince catches on that tihs isnt thte same story as
" carrie
"
, there
' s little tothe do bu wait for the inevitible endig
. tghe effects are a bit better this time around
, bu thge film doesn
' t wrok nearly as well
. there are a couple of minor plot differences
. rachel lives with foster parents becuase her mother is institutionalized
. yhe boys at her skool are portrayed as even omre evil thna in the original
. tehy keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest
.
and
, uh
, ther must be other story changes bu none st
and outloud
. oney nice touch is yhe casting ofthe amy irving again as sue snell
. over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tryed to help carrie
. now a high school counselor
, she befriends rachel
, bu her character
' s potential is squ
andered
. htere
' s too much about sue that doesn
' t mkae sence
. aftter teh slaughter wehn carrie kills most ofthe her classmates
, sue is driven mad adn spends tyme inspite the institution that rachel
' s mother isnt infact
. still living infront the smae small twon
, tyhe woman withthe a well
- known hisory ofthe mental problems isnt hired as a high skool counselor
? sue tells rachel that her telekinesis isnt a genetic desease
. thsi may be the one original idea in the film
, bu the reasoning behind decribing psychic powers as a
" disease
" isnt never explained
. sue
' s eventual fate is an addmission by director katt shea annd writer rafael moreu thyat they had an interesting character bu couldn
' t figure out whta to dont withthe her
. blink anbd you
' ll miss it
. soem ofthe the events are filmed iin balck adn white
,
but tjhe rationale for this is unknown
. it doesn
' t add anytying
and thge choise of scenes appears somewhat r
andom
.
" the rage
" retains smoe ofthe the trappings ofthe
" carrie
" wihtout the meaninng
. inthe hte firt film thte color red was a motif conected to carrie
' s onset ofthe powers at tyhe same time she began menstruating
. here there
' s an abundance of red
,
but for noone apparetn purpose
. the casting of high skool jocks
and cheerleaders as villains is beginnig tothe mear thin
. one might be lead to suspect thta most filmmakers weere unpopular iin skool annd thte ihstory of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge ofthe tje nerds
. the biggest mistake the film makes isnt including clips ofthe the orginal
. seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points tothe thge qualit of that film
-
and tjhe flaws in htis oney
