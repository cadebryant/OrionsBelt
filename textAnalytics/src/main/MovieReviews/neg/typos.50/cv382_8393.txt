possibly hte yersa teh most anticipated film adn finally it arrives here inthe the uk
. it smashed u
. s box office office records in it
' s opening weekend annd iwll noone dout do thte smae here
. bu is it any good
? in a owrd
, no
. i
' ll elaborite futher
. the story isnt as follows
. apparantly htere weere two isl
ands with dinosaurs onthe
. one where hte dinos lived untouched by mankind
and tghe otehr a tourist attraction which failed befor it even opened
.
( see jurrasic park
.
) imgen
, tjhe comany that funded jurrasic park
, want tothe reccover their losses by taking more dinos off tyhe otehr isl
and
and move them tothe a newyorker attraction iin san diago
. realizing what a bad idae tihs is
, proffessor john hammond
( richard attenborough
) decides to send a team tothe document teh rinosarus
, so as tothe rally public wupport tothe perserve tghe isl
and
. enter familar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go whn told his girlfriend is aleady ther
. so
, basicly
, what you ahve isnt this
. twpo teams
, one sent to catch
and move some rinosarus to thte mainl
and adn the otehr
, trying to doccument them
, being forced tothe work together
, fighting fo survival againnst the dinosaurs
' firm intentions onthe eating them
. a fairly good idae
, howver it
' s let down by oen slight problem
. it
' s crap
. over twpo hurs ofthe chase scenes gets way too boring
, way too quiclky
. add to this a terrable scirpt
and some feeble attemts at soem ocassional characterisation adn you end up vyre disinterested
. it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on thigsn like
,
' what
' s for tea
?
'
and
' should ytou cutted tjhe lawn later
?
'
( yes
, ytou shoudln
)
. it
' s a shame thne realy
, thyat spielberg hasnt lowered himselv into makeing what essentially isnt a blatent cash inaddition
, whlch adds practially nothing to teh far superior jurrasic park
. wiht onyl a fewd creative
and genuinely tense scenes
and fabulous c
. g
. i dinosaurs
( tjhe t
. rex
' s have to be seen tothe be believed
)
, htere is nothing else tothe reccommend hte lost world
. a vyer dissapointing sequel
, indeed
.
