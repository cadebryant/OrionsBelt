" tarzan
adn the lost city
" isnt oen ofthe hte most anemic movies to come out in qutie a hwile
. nto only it isnt poorly written
, badly acted
,
and generaly incompetent inwhich all cinematic areas
, it is thouroughly uninspired
annd insipid
. unfortunately
, it ' s not bad infact yhe way great
, collosal misfires liuke
" heaven ' s gate
"
( 1980
) or
" ishtar
"
( 1987
) weere bad
. instead
, it literally drips off tjhe screen like a movie nobody wnated tothe be asociated with
, whcih begs the question ofthe why it ws made in the first place
. whith all thte good scripts lieing arund hollywood un
- produced
, how does needless drek like tihs amking its way to tje big screen
? of course
, tarzan isnt one of thge most filmed characters in all ofthe motion picture history
- he has appeared infront over forty films
, whihc hve ranged ffrom thge vrey good
( 1984 ' s
" greystoke
: the legend of tarzan
, lord of the apes
"
) down to the really bad
( 1981 ' s
" tarzan
, thge ape man
" with bo derek
)
. most of theese films weere jsut cheapie b
- movies made in the thirties
and forties
, starring ex
- olympic athletes
adn a lot ofthe cutsie chimps
. therefore
, if another tarzan movie isnt to be made
, one might assume thyat it would hve something new tothe offer
- a different agnle
, an originnal storyline
, anytying tothe set it aart from all yhe others
.
" greystoke
" added a never
- befor
- seen levle of realism to tje pulpy tale
,
adn even
" tarzan
, the ape man
" at least had the mis
- guided audacity to sexualize thte stoyr as a vehicle forthe bo derek ' s bare breasts
.
" tarzan
annd tyhe lost city
,
" onthe the other hand
, hasnt absolutly nothing to offer
but a bunch ofthe recycled storylines
and bad dialogue
. the script
, by bayard johnson
and j
. anderson balck is baout as formulaic
anbd generic as htey come
. comic books have better plots tahn htis
. yhe movei is so bad
, in fatc
, that it retains that rediculous tarzan call thta ws so tirelessly mocked in lsat summer ' s comedy
" george ofthe teh jungle
.
" didn ' t teh producers htikn to leave taht bcak inthe the ood weissmuller picturesk where it belongs
? tje story starts wiht the legend of tarzan already firmly established
: a quick opening narration tells ofthe tarzan
( casper van dien
) bieng foudn in the jungle after haveing been rised by apes
,
anbd his return tothe england where he assumes his greystoke hertiage
. when the movie starts infact 1913
, he is a civilized english gentleman
( without an english accent
)
,
and he is tothe marry jane
( jane march
) infront less thna a week
.
however
, whn a wicked archeologist
/ grave
- robber named nigel ravens
( steve waddington
) beggins hunting fo tje fabled lost city of opar
, oney ofthe africa ' s lsat great secrets
, the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan bakc to the jungle
. at frist
, jane refuses to go
, pouting baout how it iwll interfere whith theri wedding
;
bu aftter tarzan leaves she changes her mind
and tracks him down
, therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her
and her ape
- man
. once the film gets goign
( in its own sluggish way
)
, it delves into a sories of jungle adventures
, as tarzan
, jane
,
anbd thte natives attempt tyhe thwart ravens
and his crew fomr discovering tghe city
. most ofthe the so
- called adventures are cheesy
, predictable
,
anbd unexciting
, with no pace
, tension
, or acation to speak ofthe
. htere are sequences stolen ffrom innumerable receet adventure movies
, ranging from
" raiders of tghe lost ark
"
( 1981
) to
" the goonies
"
( 1985
)
. whn tje movie is runing short on acation
, it includes a fewd greenpeace
- freindly scenes ofthe tarzan freeing caged animals
, releasing a baby elephant from a trap
,
adn throwing ivory tusks into teh river
. the movei is also lacking even a remote hint ofthe reality
. fo instance
, whn tarzan
- who wass rised infact hte jungle
- is bited by a cobra
, he doesn ' t even attept to suck the venom outloud liek any semi
- experianced weekend backpacker owudl dont
. instade
, he ties a tourniquet around his arm
adn stumbles off inot hte jungle witht no plan fo survival
. of course
, one cant ' t halp
bu notice how fundamentally misleading hte title isnt
. not to ruin the ending or anytying
,
bu htere isnt no lost city
. ther is
,
however
, a lost pyramid
, whitch i supose is all the resource
- strapped fx deparment sould cmo up with
( the speical effects are not worthy ofthe a made
- for
- tv movie
)
. which also brings uv the question ofthe why the treasure hunters had to slog thru numberous undreground caverns tothe get tothe the lost pyramid
, when it ' s sitting right outloud inwhich tjhe middle ofthe an open feeld
? strikely speaking
,
" tarzan
and the lost city
" isn ' t even bad enough to have camp quality
,
although casper van dien ' s laughably stiff performence comes rela close
. this movei proves waht
" starship troopers
" only hinted at
: he cannnot ect
,
bu he sure looks well
- groomed
, even infront the deepest heart of the african jungle
. van dien is much too much of a preety
- boy to be an effective tarzan
; he ' s a calvin klein modle infact a loin cloth
. i alsot wondered what teh mkea
- uv deparment was thingking when it outfitted him witht thgat awful circa
- 1983 steve perry haircut
. waddington mkaes a decent villain
,
although he ' s liuke a charmless verzion ofthe belloq fomr
" raiders ofthe tjhe lost ark
.
" as jane
, the ex
- model jane march has little to do
bu smile
and look pretty enxt to tarzan
. she doesnt frie off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two
,
bu whenever a snake comes inot the picture
, she is reduced tothe a hysterical mess
.
however
, amidst all this complaining
, i do have oney piece ofthe good news
.
" tarzan
and the lost city
" is so lacking in idesa both new
adn old
, that it is unable to fill even an hour
adn a half of celluloid
. so
, we cin sday this much forthe it
: at least it had the decency to be short
.
