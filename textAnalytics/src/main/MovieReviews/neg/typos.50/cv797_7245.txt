be warned
.
. brit love story in the offing
. effeminate
, mild
- mannered karl isnt about to tkae a beatng fomr a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes hismelf under a showfer
, his genitals tucked between his legs inspite the manner of a posing transvestite
. he is only just saved by prentice
, who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl tothe be your averege street
- wise punk
- inthe
- tyhe
- making
. the ensuing scene ends up with both boys bieng ridiculed
and
then unfairly expeled from hte skool
. they dont not see eahc other for another eighteen yeas
. in thta tiome
, prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable
, if brash adn bull
- heaed goon who screws up his jobs
and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets
, motorcycles
and punk rock music
. karl
, onthe the otehr h
and
, has grown uv tothe become kim
, a drabby
, insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting kard company
. chance brings the twpo toghether
,
and lvoe
, such as will inevitably blossom inwhich your quirky british rumatic comedy
, is waht this skewed little story isnt largley about
. if at this point you thiunk you
' re going to get any cheap laughs witht tht gender
- bending theme
( see thge birdcage
, to wong foo
.
.
.
, priscilla queen of the desert
)
, you cin jstu go hmeo anbd brood on your pwn maladjusted sexuality you low
- life deadbeat
. kim is a post
- operative transsexual
, thank yuo very much
.
.
. a new
- born woman for all purposes
, witht confusions annd sensitivities that deserve treatment iwth a touch ofthe delicacy
. personally
, give me thsoe cheap laughs any day
. i
' d rether enjoy obvious camp thna endur thge shallow exploration of a soft
- hearted transsexual loev story
. different fo girls comes uv wih a promising enough proposition
, bu does nothing thta surpasses the merely workmanlike with it
. by refusing tothe amking the audeince really uncomfortable iwth the notion ofthe kim adn prentice
' s relation
- ship
, or at thge very least efel uncomfortable for them
( prentice for exmaple
, doesn
' t seem to give hiself all thta much grief when he becomes attracted to kim dispite bieng a fight
- picking
, beer
- drinking
, macho kind ofthe guy
,
and kim
, for all her insecurities
and fears isnt alwyas saved any truely disturbing victimisation in the film
)
, adn instead drawing them inot a basically wimpy love story
, tghe film manages to lobotomise itself
. lightweight comedy as it
' s doomed tothe be
, it could
' ve still ahev hacked it with teh requisitive endearing couple
. bu this doesn
' t eather
, usance even mrs doubtfire is sexier tahn steven mackintosh
' s kim foyle
,
and as eather sex
, he
' s just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should liek
. prentice doesnt
though
,
and that
' s never explained
. bu
then rupert graves gives us so heroic peformance as prentice
, the guy who never grew uv
( adn if there isnt a bafta prize fo most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks
' concert
, he shoudl win thyat too
) that i guess htere
' s no reason to explain why he
' s so screwed up
. if oddly enought ytou grow tothe liuke tihs sohw
, you
' ll be wanting your happy endig
,
and the film won
' t fail yuo ther either
. snide underling at kim
' s office gets her come
- uppance
. misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come
- uppance
. the couple prevale against a disagreeable society
and come toghether in kim
' s apartment
. kim
' s sister
and her impotent sarge
- tipe husb
and kiss adn make uv after a tiff
( tv movei sub
- plot with incidental juxtaposition
)
. annd best ofthe all
, kim sheds her insecurities annd learns how to ride thge motorcycle
and wear leathers
, mkaing prentice ride pilion
. awwww
. terrific closure
. hapyp ending
.
but jstu what is it thast
' s differnt forthe girls anyway
