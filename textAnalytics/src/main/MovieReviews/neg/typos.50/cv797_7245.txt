be warned
.
. brit love tsory inthe tje offing
. effeminate
, mild
- mannered karl isnt baout tothe tkae a beatng fomr a bunch of ruffians at skool as he bathes himself under a shower
, his genitals tucked betwen his legs infact the manner ofthe a posing transvestite
. he is onyl just saved by prentice
, who appears in all respects barring his protective attitide towards karl tothe be your averege street
- wise punk
- inwhich
- the
- making
. thge ensuing scene ends up with both boys bieng ridiculed
adn
then unfairly expeled fomr the skool
. they do not see eahc otehr for anohter eighteen yeas
. in thta time
, prentice hasnt matured into a somewhat loveable
, if brash
anbd bull
- heaed goon who screws up his jobs
anbd relationships hwile gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets
, motorcycles
and punk rock music
. karl
, on tyhe other hand
, has grown uv to become kim
, a drabby
, insecure woman who works as a verse writer fo a greeting kard company
. chance brings the two toghether
,
adn love
, such as will inevitably blossom inthe your quirky brittish romantic comedy
, is waht this skewed little stry isnt largely about
. if at this point ytou htink ytou ' re going tothe get any cheap laughs wih tyhat gender
- bending theme
( see tje birdcage
, tothe wong foo
.
.
.
, priscilla queen ofthe tjhe dezert
)
, you cin just go hmeo
and brood onthe your pwn maladjusted sexuality ytou low
- life deadbeat
. kim is a post
- operative transsexual
, thank you very much
.
.
. a newyorker
- born woman for all purposes
, with confusions
annd sensitivities tyhat deserve treatment wtih a touch ofthe delicacy
. personaly
, give me thsoe cheap laughs any day
. i ' d rether enjoy obvious camp than endur the shallow exploration of a soft
- hearted transsexual lveo story
. differnt forthe girls comes up whith a promising enough propostion
,
bu doens nothing that surpasses teh mearly workmanlike wih it
. by refusing to amking hte audience really uncomfortable wih the notion of kim
anbd prentice ' s relation
- ship
, or at tghe vyre least feel uncomfortable fo them
( prentice forthe exemple
, doesn ' t seem tothe give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted tothe kim dispite bieng a fight
- picking
, beer
- drinking
, macho kind ofthe guy
,
and kim
, forthe all her insecurities
annd fears isnt alwyas saved any truley disturbing victimisation infact yhe film
)
,
and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy lveo sotry
, the film manages tothe lobotomise itself
. lightweight comedy as it ' s doomed to be
, it coudl ' ve still have hacked it whith the requisitive endearing cuple
.
but htis doesn ' t either
, sicne even mrs doubtfire is sexier tahn steven mackintosh ' s kim foyle
,
anbd as eather sex
, he ' s jsut plainly a simpering wanker nobody shoudln like
. prentice doens
though
,
and thyat ' s never explained
.
but
hten rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice
, the guy who never growed uv
(
and if ther is a bafta prize for most convincing protrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks ' concert
, he should win that too
) taht i guess ther ' s no reason to expalin why he ' s so screwed uv
. if oddly enought you grwo tothe liuke this show
, you ' ll be wanting your hapyp ending
,
and thte film won ' t fail ytou ther either
. snide underling at kim ' s office gets her come
- uppance
. misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come
- uppance
. the couple prevail agianst a disagreeable society
and come together in kim ' s apartment
. kim ' s sister
adn her impotent sarge
- tipe husband kiss
annd amking uv after a tiff
( tv movei sub
- plot wtih incidental juxtaposition
)
.
and best ofthe all
, kim sheds her insecurities
and lerans how to ride thge motorcycle
adn mear leathers
, making prentice ride pilion
. awwww
. terrific closure
. hapyp ending
.
bu jsut whta isnt it tht ' s differnt for girls anyway
? if yuo figure that oen out
, let me know
. thte flying inkpot rating sytem
