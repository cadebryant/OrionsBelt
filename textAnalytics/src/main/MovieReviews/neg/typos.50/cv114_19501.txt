the hapyp bastard ' s quick movie review wholy man more like wholy crap
. tyhe film stars eddie murphy as a mystical
- ish figure named g onthe a strange journey ofthe soem sort whn he comes across twpo network execs
( jeff goldblum
and kelly preston
) wih a flat tire onthe theri hands
. somehow he ends up inaddition theri car
anbd onthe thier channel
, a line
- up ofthe infomercial programs featuring the likes ofthe betty white
, morgan fairchild
,
and a slew of other celebrities
and nameless figures
. it ' s here that he seems to hitted his stride
, speaking ofthe life instead
annd somehow boosting sales
. at thsi point in tjhe movie
, of course
, morality comes into play
, paticularly onthe goldblum
, who suddenly feels he can market the magical g inot megabucks tothe git in good wiht his boss
( robert loggia
)
. it doesn ' t take long for the movie tothe unfold into sappy mush
, withthe realizations tkaing place left
and right
and poor plot points
. onyl a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild ' s face seems to have any interest in tje movie
. murphy lends nothing to his charcter
and poore goldblum looks as if he ' d rather be someplace eles
. soem may argue thyat tje movei has a message
,
but all that came accross to me isnt that i could probably get more enteratinment watching thta informercial with tghe guy in teh question mark coat
. at least he hasnt something for us tothe laught at
.
