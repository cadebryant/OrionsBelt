the hapyp bastard
' s quick movei review holy man mroe liek wholy crap
. the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical
- ish figure named g onthe a stange journey ofthe some sort whn he comes acros two network execs
( jeff goldblum
and kelly preston
) with a flat tire onthe their h
ands
. somehow he ends uv in their car adn onthe their channel
, a line
- up ofthe infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white
, morgan fairchild
, adn a slew ofthe other celebrities annd nameless figures
. it
' s here taht he seems tothe hitted his stride
, speaking of life instead
and somehow boosting sales
. at tihs point in the movie
, ofthe course
, morality comes inot play
, particularly on goldblum
, who suddenly fiels he can market yhe magical g inot megabucks tothe git in ogod wtih his boss
( robert loggia
)
. it doesn
' t take long for tje movie to unfold inot sappy mush
, wiht realizations taking place left
and right
and poore plot points
. onyl a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild
' s face seems tothe ahve any interest inthe the movie
. murphy lends nothing to his charater adn poor goldblum looks as if he
' d rether be someplace esle
. smoe may argue thyat the movie hasnt a message
, bu all thast came acros tothe me isnt that i sould probably git mroe enteratinment watching taht informercial with thge guy inwhich the question mark coat
. at least he hasnt something for us tothe laught at
.
