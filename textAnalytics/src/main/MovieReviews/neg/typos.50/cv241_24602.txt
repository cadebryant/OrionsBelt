the most populare trend of the lsat cuple of yersa hasnt beeen thge twist ending
. watching one of theese movies
, everything seems tothe mkea sense untl suddenly yuo are blown awya by an unexpected suprize
. wehn the film ends
, htere is a moent of confusion
,
then recollection
, hten some more confusion
,
then possibly a second viewing for clarification
. htis isnt a descripton ofthe an ideal twist thta perfects everything it sets outloud to do
and more
. ogod surprises amking movies fun tothe watch
. thne ther are the bad twists
. you eather nkwo whta is going to happen ten mintues inot tyhe movie
( i
' m tlaking baout you reindeer games
) or you doed nto guess tyhe endig becouse it is so outrageously stupid
. screwed perfectly suits tje latter description
. what starts out as a dumb gilty pleasure which shoudln be fun tothe mock wtih a gropu ofthe firends ends wtih a complex finale withthe way too much gonig onthe
. by tyhe writers ofthe man onthe thte moon adn teh people vs
. larrry flynt
, scott alex
ander
and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind anbd tkae a stab at film directing
. whoops
. screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuin laughs
and many acting embarrassments
. norm macdonald stars as willard filmore
, a hard wokring chauffeur who just whants a littel respect from his rich
, ood
, insidious boss
, miss crock
( elaine stritch
)
. wehn he overhears her plans tothe fier him onthe christmas day
, willard is conviced by his best friend rusty
( dave chapelle
) to kidnap crock
' s beloved dog adn hold it for a ransom ofthe oney milion dollars
. too excisted tothe pay any attension
, tjhe hapless losers
' plan goes awry wehn the dog escapes annd returns home
. now crock thikns willard hasnt beeen kidnapped annd tghe two friends
, realizing they cant make even more money
, deside to stage the fake kidnapping
. of course
, everyting that could go wrong does
. thge frist forty
- five minutes of screwed isnt harmless entertainment
- a gilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad
.
but the convoluted script eventually builds inot a disaster thta is impossible to bear
. the more idiotic theese charactors get
, the omre reckless the script becomes
. at noe point
, i wanted tothe get out of my seat
and yell at theese charactors
:
" no
, you idiot
!
" i
' m not jsut talking about willard adn rusty
, who weere extemely annoying
, i
' m also tlaking about tghe cops inwhich tihs film
. a monkey coudl hve solved htis case within an hour bu these guys
( headed by murder oney
' s daniel benzali
) weere just too clueless to forgive
. they give real cops bad names
. aslo poore danny devito aparently doens nto knwo how to turn down a role theese days
. looking almost identical to his penguin in batman
: returns
, eveyr timne he appeared onthe the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief
. he jstu didn
' t belong infact this movie
. macdonald
and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies bu devito made the film much worse tahn it already was
, gross out humor isnt certainly nto his forte
. if you
' re a fan of norm macdonald
' s otehr chaotic comedy
, dirty work
, you might acutally love this near
- sequel
. otherwise
, don
' t git screwed outloud ofthe your hard
- earned money
