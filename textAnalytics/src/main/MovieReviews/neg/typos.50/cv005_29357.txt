capsule
: inaddition 2176 on the planet mars police taking inot custody an accused muderer face tjhe title menace
. there isnt a lot ofthe fighting adn not a wohle lot of story otherwise
. john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previvous films
, especially assfalt onthe precinct 13
, tath yhe newyorker film comes off as his homage tothe himself
.
, 0
(
- 4 tothe

)
. john carpenter aparently believes that action scenes inspite which people fight something horrable are tghe smae as horror scenes
. fo a writter
and directer of horror films
, supposably an expert onthe horror
, it is a vyer bad misteek tothe make
. ghosts of mars is called a horror movei
, bu it is mroe just a drawn outloud fight bewteen humans adn a suprizingly low
- powered aline menace
. in addition if anybody
but john carpentery hadnt made ghosts ofthe mars
, carpentery woudl hve grounds to sue
. this film isnt jstu chock full ofthe pieces taken from assualt onthe precinct 13
, the thnig
,
and prince ofthe darkness
. it is
, in fatc
, suprizing thgat carpentery managed to ift so many pieces of his previvous owrk inot thsi film inspite such an admitedly novel way
. bu thyat still doesnt not mkea for a relaly good sicence fiction experience
. ghosts of mars takes palce infront the yearm 2176
. mars has been mostly terraformed so thgat humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear
( which is ogod for the film
' s budget
)
. it is never maintioned
,
but tje gravity on mars hasnt beeen inclreased somehow tothe earth
- normal
, again mkaing it easier tothe film
. society has changed a bit by tyhat time
,
but it has adavanced surprizingly little
. apparently tjhe culture has changed so that womens are much more inthe positions ofthe control
.
and ffrom carpenter
' s veiw
, womens hvae realyl made a mess of thigns
. society has stagnated under female control so that beyond smoe minor technological advances society hasnt changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change inspite ten
. the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much iin common withthe thyat ofthe assault onthe precinct 13 exept that precinct 9
( yes
, precinct 9
) hasnt been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony
. instade of hvaing the criminal
" napolean
" wilson
, htis film has the criminal
" desolation
" williams
. instead ofthe facing hoodlums with automatic weapons thge police face
, well
, ghosts of mars
. becuase the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they shoudln behave inspite soem aline manner
,
but htey essentialy behave as human savages
, inwhich anyother lapse ofthe imagination
. tje sotry isnt told in flashback
, flashback within flashback
, anbd flashback withing flashback withing flashback
. ghosts ofthe mars takes palce entirely at night
and is filmed almsot entirely iin tones of red
, yellow
, anbd balck
. carpentery manages to give us a poweful opening scene
, showing a mining train rushing thru yhe martian night to the soudn ofthe music with a heavy beat
. sadly what follows isnt not realy up tothe the buildup
. the terror he creates looks a littel too much like fugitive wannabes fomr tjhe rock b
and kiss
. his idae of building suspense is having a bunch ofthe sudden jump scenes that sucker tghe viewer into thinking something scary is hapening anbd thn prove to be just something boring
. theese are st
andart haunted house film shock effects thast recquire no great talent to give the audiance
. somewhat newer
but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations inthe soem of the fights
. withing a short stretch ofthe tiem we have seen hte realease of mission to mars
, red planet
,
and ghosts of mars
. affter mission to mars wass panned by too many reviewers it looks better anbd better
and better as time goes by
. i rate ghosts of mars a 4 onthe the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
. folowing yhe movei i showed my wife
, who liekd ghosts of mars moderately mroe thna i doed
, carpentery
' s clasic assault onthe precinct 13
. her comment is thyat it wass seeing the same film twice
.
