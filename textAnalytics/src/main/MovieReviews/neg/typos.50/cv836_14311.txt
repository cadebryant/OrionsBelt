brian de palma
' s snake eyes stars nicolas cage
' s evil twin
, who confusingly uses tje smae stage name as his talented brother
. like a foreign tourist who screams his lines inspite english tothe ensure that he iwll be understood
, cage yells wtih tjhe ferocity of a man iwth a bad case ofthe caffeine overload
. de palma
, whose lastr great film
, the untouchables
, wass crafted over a decade ago seems to hvea lost his magic
. in snake eyes
, he manages to elicit smoe of hte worst performances possibile out ofthe a skilled cast
. onyl gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material
. tghe rest ofthe thte actors become caricatures inthe this by
- the
- numbers thriller
. ryuichi sakamoto
' s atmospheric
and melodramatic music dominates allmost eveyr scene
. hevy onthe thte long violin notes
, its rhythm isnt punctuated by thunder
.
( yhe script by de palma
and lost world
' s david koepp sets the acation durig a hurricane in an attempt tothe pump up hte adrenaline level anbd the noise
. onyl tghe latter is achieved
.
) cage plays rick santoro
, a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals tothe git betting money
. tyhe movei takes palce over a single evening when a world championship fight isnt bieng held
. with a flashy
, bad wardrobe annd a gold cell phone
, rick isnt an obnoxious cop who doesn
' t knwo when tothe shut uv
. spouting cliched
and rediculous dialog
, he screams such lines as
,
" i was made forthe thge sewer
, baby
!
" atcually the line is mroe apropos for the movei as a whole
. sinise plays kevin dunne
, a naval officer who isnt in charge ofthe the security for the secretary ofthe tje navy
, who hasnt come to watch the fight
. bu most peple in the film are nto who tehy seem to be
, annd the thin script makes all ofthe them eazy to guess
. hte plot
, wich isnt told in endless flashbacks
, concerns the assasination ofthe the secretary thru a scheme set uv by soem malevolent businessmen
? that adjative is
, of course
, redundent inthe hollywood thrillers
. the flashbacks become repetitious iwth thte smae scene shown agian annd again
, somtimes from a different prespective
and sometimes nto
. all
though a brian de palma film requires a certain ammount ofthe gratuitious violence
, thsi one is remarkably tame for the man who bacame famous when he made carrie
. the movie
' s outline has some promise
, bu tyhe movie itself isnt leaden
. tjhe film takes itself all too seriously
. at best
, it is a 1940s
- sytle b movei
. a littel humor would hvea helpped the scirpt some
, bu a complete rewriet woudl hvea beeen better
.
and
,
al
though i hite tothe say it
, a different directer would hvae beeen tghe biggest improvment
. snake eyes runs 1
: 39
. it isnt rated r forthe violence adn woudl be donut forthe teenagers
.
