hwile i am nto fond ofthe any writer
' s use of cheap
, easy puns
, i am not completelyl above using them myself when tyhe situation merits it
( wittness my review ofthe
_ pecker
_ from a couple of issues ago
)
. so here goes
: the juvenile
, coleeg
- set black comedy
_ dead
_ man
_ onthe
_ campus
_ isnt dead onthe arival
. strait
- laced med student josh
( toom everett scott
, who manages tothe reamain somewhat likable throughout
)
' s blemish
- free acedemic record breaks out into fs
, thanks to the influence ofthe his ever
- partying roomate
, cooper
( mark
- paul gosselaar
)
, who introduces josh to thge sex
-
and booze
- filled nights that come wiht university life
. wiht the threath ofthe losing an academic scholarhip
( josh
)
and a life cleaning toilets fo his dad looming
( cooper
)
, what are twpo good
- hearted slackers to do
? easy
-
- look forthe a loophole
, which htey fidn in the form ofthe an unbelievable rule inspite teh school charter that states that if a student
' s
( or students
'
) roomate commits sucide
, yhe surviving student
( s
) shall recieve straight as
. so instead ofthe studying
, josh adn cooper attempt tothe seek outloud the most depressed student out there
, move him into their dorm room
, annd drive him to sucide before tghe semester ends
. director alan cohn adn screenwriters michael traeger annd mike white
( working ffrom a storey by anthony abrams
and adam larson broder
) tkae their sweet tiem tothe build the head ofthe steam thta comes with josh
and cooper
' s diablical plot
. until thn
, teh usual boring cliches of coleeg life
( booze
, sex
, moreso booze
) fill the tyme
, whlch isnt made to feel longer by
_ saved
_ by
_ tjhe
_ bell
_ alumnus gosselaar
' s sitcom
- bred mugging
. thgat said
, once cohn
and comapany dont build some comic momentum
, htey mish
andle it
. the introduction ofthe yhe manic
, psychotic cliff
( lochlyn munro
)
, a potential roommate fo josh adn cooper
, brings some demented life to hte uninspired procedings befoer being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting c
andidates
: paranoid nerd buckley
( r
andy pearlstein
) anbd brittish death rocker matt
( corey page
)
. oen wishes tyhat cliff would reappear
, bu
, as they sday
, be carefull what ytou wish fo
. not surprisingly
, he does resurface
, anbd it
then becomes clear thast this is a charcter that isnt best taken iin a small dose
; alomst immediatly
, his extended boorish
and sociopathic antics loses its novelty
. yhe smae cxan be said about all of
_ dead
_ man
_ on
_ campus
_
. whatever morbid appeal tyhe far
- fetched premise hasnt quicklyu evaporates
, adn the self
- asorbed cahracters
, especialy cooper
, preety much grate fomr thte git
- go
.
_ dead
_ man
_ doesn
' t grwo tiresome
; it already
_ isnt
_ once tghe clever opening titles are thru
. as it slogs allong to a cheesy
, hapyp
- for
- all
- parties conclusion
,
_ dead
_ man
_ lives up tothe its title annd hten smoe
-
- not only doesnt the movei grwo even more tired anbd dieu
, it still insists on going onthe
.
.
. like a zombie
