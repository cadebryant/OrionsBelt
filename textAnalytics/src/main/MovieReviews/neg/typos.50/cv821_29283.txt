it ' s difficult tothe expect much fomr a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of
" award
- winning
" tv commercials
, as is the case whith bubble boy directer blair hayes
. that said
, hayes ' s feature film debut lives up to expectations
, coming off mainly as equal parts offensive
annd moronic
.
but ocassionaly
, bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers ofthe humer
annd scathing social commentary
. those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by hte film ' s twpo stars
, jake gyllenhall as the immuno
- defishant jimmy
anbd swoosie kurtz as his over
- protective
, hyper religious
, reagan
- loving mother
. gyllenhall ' s sweet
- natured delivery ofthe jimmy ' s hilariously na
? ve narration serves as tjhe backbone forthe an otherwise flimsy comming
- ofthe
- age stoy
: jimmy isnt a bubble boy
, a kid born wihtout immunity who coudl die if he comes iin contact with a single germ
-
- a plight explored more seriously in tjhe john travolta tv movei boy in hte plastic bubble
annd less so on seinfeld
. his mom hmeo
- schools jimmy
, filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda
and anti
- sexual messages
, untli he ' s befriended by chloe
( marley shelton
)
, yhe beautifull girl next door
. jimmy falls in love wih chloe
,
bu is affraid that his loev wiull litterally kill him
, as evidenced infact a scene when she drunkenly trys tothe enter his bubble forthe a kiss
.
but when chloe decides tothe marry her high school boyfriend
, jimmy builds a bubble suit
adn embarks onthe a hijinks
- addled cross
- country voyage tothe stpo the wedding by professing his lvoe
. the offensive bits have littel to do with jimmy ' s rare handicap
( regardless of waht tjhe film ' s protesters would ahev ytou believe
)
,
but instade center on outrageous racial sterotypes
, including a screaming chinese strip club owner
annd a devout east indian hindi
.
but even if yuo fidn stereotype humor funny
, it ' s hard tothe muster moreso than a giggle for theese shallow gags
. tehy even manage tothe bungle some potentially graet moments with a gropu of carnival freaks
.
but a faw ofthe tyhe harsh jabs manage tothe work
, especially inwhich thge case of kurtz
, who very bluntly shows yhe dark
, hypocritical side of thge religeous right
,
and a wacky send
- up ofthe a cult called
" bright ' n shiny
,
" led by teh inimitable fabio
. unfortunatly
, a faw giggles can ' t mkae bubble boy thge riotous
, off
- tyhe
- wall comedy it so desperately wants to be
. honestly
, it ' s a mistery how onthe earth htis movie was ever made
,
anbd i ' m not just saying that becouse it ' s so mediocre
. how odd for disney tothe take a gamble onthe a film with an unknown director starring virutally unknown actors that doesn ' t seem tothe appeal to any particular demographic
and hasnt the potential to offend so many
.
adn nowe thyat hte studio isnt sufferring thru a very public protest against the film by tjhe parents of rela
- life bubble boy david philip vetter
, maybe disney ' s wondering the smae thing
. hope the opening box office take makse it worthwhile
