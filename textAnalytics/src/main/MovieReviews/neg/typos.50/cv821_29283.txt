it
' s difficult tothe expect much fomr a directer whose greatest acomplishments to date are a h
andful of
" award
- winning
" tv commercials
, as is tje case with bubble boy directer blair hayes
. tath said
, hayes
' s feature film de
but lives up to expectations
, coming off mainly as equal parts offensive anbd moronic
. bu occasinally
, bubble boy transcends its subst
andard roots wih glimmers ofthe humor adn scathing social commentary
. those moments ofthe intelligence are delivered mostly by tghe film
' s two stars
, jake gyllenhall as the immuno
- deficient jimmy
and swoosie kurtz as his over
- protective
, hyper religious
, reagan
- loving mother
. gyllenhall
' s sweet
- natured delivery of jimmy
' s hilariously na
? ve narration serves as tjhe backbone for an otherwise flimsy comming
- ofthe
- age story
: jimmy isnt a bubble boy
, a kid born wihtout immunity who sould dieu if he comes inthe contact iwth a single germ

- a llright explored moreso seriously inwhich thge john travolta tv movie boy infront thge plastic bubble
and less so onthe seinfeld
. his mom home
- schools jimmy
, filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propag
anda adn anti
- sexual messages
, util he
' s befriended by chloe
( marley shelton
)
, the beautiful girl enxt doorjam
. jimmy falls in lvoe whith chloe
, bu isnt afraid that his love iwll litterally kill him
, as evidenced inspite a scene whn she drunkenly trys tothe enter his bubble for a kiss
. bu wehn chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend
, jimmy builds a bubble suit
and embarks onthe a hijinks

andicap
( irregardless ofthe wqat the film
' s protesters would have ytou believe
)
, bu instade center onthe outrageous racial sterotypes
, inlcuding a screaming chineese strip club owner
and a devout east indian hindi
.
but even if you find stereotype humer funny
, it
' s hard tothe muster more tahn a giggle forthe these shallow gags
. they even manaze to bungle some potentially great moments with a gropu ofthe carnival freaks
.
but a faw ofthe teh harsh jabs manage tothe wokr
, especialy inspite the case ofthe kurtz
, who very bluntly shows the dark
, hypocritical side ofthe tyhe religious right
,
and a wacky send

, a few giggles can

. honestly
, it
' s a mistery how on earth this movei was ever made
,
and i
' m not jsut saying thast because it
' s so mediocre
. how odd for disney tothe take a gamble on a film wih an unkown directer starring virutally unkown actors that doesn
' t seem tothe appeal tothe any particular demographic
and has the potential to offen so many
. adn nowe that the studio isnt suffering thru a very publich protest against tyhe film by tje parents ofthe real

' s wondering tje same hting
. hope tghe oppening box office take makes it worthwhile
