recently noe ngiht a young director named baz luhrmann couldn
' t sleep
. he tumbled out of bed annd moved over tothe tje televsion where he watched mtv for an hour
. thne he moved to his kichen where he spent the smae amount ofthe time eating spoiled fod
. thn he tookover down a volume ofthe shakespeare
' s work
and read it cover to cover
- never really paying attention to teh words or plot
. adn thne
, as a climax
, he tookover out his video camera
and pressed tyhe
" on
"
button
. thte result
? william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
- the worst film ever made
and a complet failure
.
though
, tothe be fair
, an intresting complet failure
. yhe idea at tghe film
' s core is to amking shakespeare appealling to tje crowds
. thsi isnt done by moving the camera around at a repid rate so that we cxan
' t see what is gonig on
.
and filming tyhe dialogue in voice over
. annd shooting leonardo dicaprio liek a calvin klein modle
. adn making the frame go still while flashing the charachter
' s name at thte bottom
. anbd filming long tedious action sequences infact slow motion
. i mean
, man
, this isnt tje 90s
, dude
. howver i
' ve seen terrible films thta are funn to watch
.
( examples are batman
and robin
and tjhe isl
and of doctor moreau
.
) tyhat rule doesn
' t apply here
. this isnt a film that tkaes itself seriously
. that isnt it
' s major fault
. another probelm was pointed outloud by my firend
, alex
( who ws singing songs by leonard bernstein througout
.
)
; the orginial play is a powerfull piece ofthe work because the autor remained nuetral adn didn
' t take sides
. here it
' s clear thgat we are supposted tothe side with romeo
.
( jsut look at tghe way they film him
.
) ffrom thge begining he
' s our hero
and tihs doesn
' t work
.
and dicaprio
' s awful performence doesn
' t help
. luhrmann never decides if he wnats to entertain us or enlighten us
. hte result isnt a mess
. yuo can feel him striving to be something he isn
' t
. he trys tothe pul of a mix in whihc drag queens are filmed ffrom purposefully arty angles
. he trys very hard
. key owrd
: trys
.
" oh look
, he
' s filming above water action fomr below
. pretty
. wqat doesnt it represent
?
" why dont peple dont ugly things
? i scrambled awya from my tv set feeling gilty as if i could never read the play agina adn keep a straight face
.
