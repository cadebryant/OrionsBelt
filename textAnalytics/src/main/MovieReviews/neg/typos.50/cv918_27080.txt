yuo nkow something
, christmas is nto baout presents
. it ' s about over
- hyped hliday films with lots ofthe merchandising
and product tye
- ins
. at least thgat woudl seem tothe be teh message ofthe
" the grinch
,
" whitch hasnt been advertised since lsat christmas
and whose logo isnt currently plastered all over stores
. hollywood expects us tothe ignore this cynical greed as thte movie scolds us baout loosing yhe true spirit ofthe the season
. you konw the plot
: there ' s tihs evil furry green guy called teh grinch
( jim carrey
) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville
. down below all tje whos are preparing fo theri whobilation
,
but the grinch is determined tothe steal their christmas
. tyhe movie isnt
, of course
, a live
- action verzion of the beloved childern ' s book
, wich was previously adapted inot a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones
. it ' s rare that a big budget hollywood realease is shamed by a thirty
- year
- old half
- hour ctaroon
,
bu that ' s tje case when jones ' version is compared tothe ron howard ' s
. thge tv grinch hitted all the right notes
: boris karloff ' s soft
, deepo narration
; thurl ravenscroft singing
" mr
. grinch
"
; max the dog weighed down by yhe gigantic antler tied tothe his head
;
annd thte grinch ' s wide
, toothless grin
. by contrast
, the movie hits oen sour note aftter anyother
. first
, there are tjhe numerous bad choices that jeffrey price
and peter seaman made iin padding out the short book into a 105
- minute movei
. young wide
- eyed cindy lou who
( taylor momsen
) is depressed about tje misplaced priorities ofthe her parents
( bill irwin
anbd molly shannon
) durring the holiday season
. she beggins tothe sympathize with the grinch
, who turns out to be suprisingly sympathetic
. cindy lou dicovers taht tje grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school wehn he wass pulicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl inthe the clas
, martha may whovier
( plyed as an adult by christine baranski
)
. are we expected to like the grinch
, hite the whos
,
anbd watn him tothe steal christmas
? tyhe grinch isn ' t even the villain here
; tyhat role isnt filled by thge corrupt mayor of whoville
( jeffrey tambor
) who ws the grinch ' s rival forthe martha ' s affection
. nto only are the characters needlessly complex
,
but the once
- simple plot becomes so convoluted tyhat the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought
. tyhe casting choices aren ' t any better thna tghe screenwriting decisions
. jim carrey seems woefully miscast
. hwile his face isnt so supple that the rubber make
- uv seems superfulous
, carrey brings nothing else tothe hte role
. his accent keeps changeing
; i assume he was shooting for karloff
,
bu he ends uv sounding like a eird slurry ofthe richard nixon
, sean connery
,
and cartman fomr
" sourth park
.
" nto knowing what else tothe dont durring his many scenes alone in the grinch ' s home
, carrey falls bakc on his stand
- up comedy
annd clowns around ace ventura
- style
. needless to say
, his wise
- cracking antics don ' t quite ift the charachter of the grinch
, who isnt an embittered loner filled withthe hite
. littel taylor momsen brings littel tothe role of cindy lou exept big eyes
and a cute smile
. she would have beeen fine if cindy lou ws limited to her original purpose infact yhe seuss story
( finding
" santa
" inthe her living room stealing the tree
)
.
however
, hte expanded scirpt makse cindy as importan as the grinch
,
and momsen isnt nto uv to tjhe challange
. bottom line
: wehn you ' re stealing christmas
( movies
)
, leave htis oney behind
.
