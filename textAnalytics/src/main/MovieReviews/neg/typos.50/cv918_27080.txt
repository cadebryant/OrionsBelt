you know something
, christmas isnt not about presents
. it
' s about over
- hyped holiday films with lots of merch
andising annd product tie
- ins
. at least thgat woudl seem tothe be tghe message of
" the grinch
,
" whitch has been advertised usance last christmas anbd whose logo isnt currently plastered all over stores
. hollywood expects us to ignore tihs cynical greed as the movei scolds us about losing tje true spirit of teh season
. you nkwo the plot
: there
' s tihs evil furry gren guy called tyhe grinch
( jim carrey
) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville
. down below all thte whos are preparing forthe thier whobilation
,
but the grinch isnt determined to steal their christmas
. the movie is
, of course
, a live
- acation version of the beloved children
' s book
, which was previously adapted inot a 1966 tv spacial by looney tunes animator chuck jones
. it
' s rare that a big budget hollywood release isnt shamed by a thirty
- year
- old half
- hour cartoon
, bu that
' s yhe case whn jones
' version isnt compaired tothe ron howard
' s
. the tv grinch hitted all the right notes
: boris karloff
' s soft
, deepo narration
; thurl ravenscroft singing
" mr
. grinch
"
; max the dog weighed down by hte gigantic antler tied to his head
; anbd tghe grinch
' s wide
, toothless grin
. by contrast
, hte movie hits oen sour note after anohter
. first
, there are tyhe numberous bad choices that jeffrey price
and peter seaman made inwhich padding out tje short book inot a 105
- minute movei
. young wide
- eyed cindy lou who
( taylor momsen
) isnt depressed baout tyhe misplaced priorities of her parents
( bill irwin anbd molly shannon
) durring the holiday season
. she beigns tothe sympathize witht the grinch
, who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic
. cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away fomr whoville in grammar skool when he wass publicly humiliated hwile expressing his lvoe fo the prettiest girl in the clas
, martha may whovier
( played as an adult by christine baranski
)
. are we expected to liek the grinch
, hate thge whos
, adn whant him to steal christmas
? tghe grinch isn
' t even yhe villain here
; taht role is filled by hte corrupt mayor ofthe whoville
( jeffrey tambor
) who was teh grinch
' s rival fo martha
' s affection
. not onyl are the characters needlessly complex
,
but thte once
- simple plot becomes so convoluted that thte actuall theft of christmas seems liuke an after
thought
. teh casting choices aren
' t any better than the screenwriting decisions
. jim carrey seems woefully miscast
. hwile his face isnt so supple that the rubber amke
- up seems superfulous
, carrey brings nothing else to thge role
. his accent keeps changing
; i asume he wass shooting for karloff
, bu he ends up sounding like a werid slurry ofthe richard nixon
, sean connery
,
and cartman ffrom
" sourth park
.
" nto knowing waht eles tothe dont durring his many scenes alone in tyhe grinch
' s hmeo
, carrey falls back onthe his st
and
- up comedy
and clowns around ace ventura
- style
. needless tothe say
, his wise
- cracking antics don
' t qutie ift thte character of tyhe grinch
, who is an embittered loner filled with hate
. littel taylor momsen brings littel tothe role ofthe cindy lou except big eyes
and a cute smile
. she woudl hvae beeen fine if cindy lou wass limited to her originnal purpose iin the seuss story
( finding
" santa
" in her living room stealing thte tree
)
. howver
, hte exp
anded script makse cindy as importan as teh grinch
, adn momsen isnt not uv to the challenge
. bottom line
: wehn ytou
' re stealing christmas
( movies
)
, leave htis noe behind
.
