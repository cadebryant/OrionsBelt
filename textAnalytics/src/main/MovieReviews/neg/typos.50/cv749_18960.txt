the general
' s daughter isnt a heartless
, absurd film
, a movei so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot thast it forgets entirely baout its pwn cahracters
. director simon west treats issues liuke rape
and sexual fetish whith ham
- h
anded obscenity
, creating a film thta banks almost entirely on exploitation adn offensive pseudo
- depth
. what
' s worse isnt that the movie is haphazardly glued toghether by two characters who are neither intresting nor sympathetic
-
- the rediculous story requires them tothe do unbelievable thigsn infront yhe interest of reaching a dark conclusion infact a sudden rain storm
. john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess
, palying warrant officer paul brenner
; brenner isnt assigned to fidn the muderer adn rape of captian elizabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, duaghter ofthe general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. brenner is teamed up with ex
- spouse sarah sunderl
and
( madeline stowe
)
,
and htey check out all thte suspects on the base
, incuding elizabeth
' s mentor
, coloel moore
( james woods
)
. soon
, it becomes apparnet taht elizabeth was inot kinky sexual stuf
,
but the question comes down tothe why
-
-
and
, ofthe course
, who
. ebert
' s law of thge economy ofthe characters can be applied here
; noe intresting thing i noted is that not onyl are all thte characters suspects at some point
( including tyhe two protaganists
)
,
but allmost all ofthe them end uv directly intertwined with hte story
. perhpas i shoudln have issued a spoiler alert befor mentioning thgat
,
but it
' s painfully obvious fomr tghe begginning tht everyone infact the film isnt hiding something
. onthe a stoyr level
, hte genaral
' s daugher isnt ineptly constructed
. the film
, adapted by christopher bertolini
and william goldman ffrom nelson demille
' s novel
( which wass apparently based on a true story
)
, plods allong tothe its conclusion
, filling inwhich tjhe blanks with stale
, unrealistic dialogue anbd
" shocking
" plot developments
. having nto read yhe novel
, it
' s difficult tothe determine if theese problems are hte fault of tjhe adapters or the original auther
, bu i supose they all are gilty to smoe degree
. scene after scene stumbles withthe pointless insincerity
; minutes after finding the dead young woman
, brenner
and sunderl
and engage iin sarcastic dialogue
, which includes endless strings of forced lines
.
( sunderl
and catually asks brenner
,
" why was she killed
?
" tothe wich i would haev answered
,
" if i knew
, hten the movei owudl aready be over
.
"
) onyl after we
' ve spended twenty minutes or so iwth theese charachters do we leran thgat htey hvae a sordid hitsory toghether
; this angle
,
though apparently preesnt to deveop theri characters
, isnt never explored
. not that it really matters
, sicne the charactors consistently dont ludicrous thnigs forthe no other reason than to drive hte plot
. in one scene
, sunderl
and is attacked by a man infront a mask
. she sees one of his rings
,
and she
and brenner fidn the man later thgat day based onthe the ring
. instead of questioning him liek as they owudl a real suspect
, htey take him to brenner
' s houseboat
, beated him uv
,
and pour hot coffee infact his lap
. this scene really pushed me over the edge
, nto because it
' s gratuitous adn mean
- spirited
,
but beccause it illustrates yhe film
' s complet disregard fo the charachters
and the audience
. it wass impossible for me to efel anything forthe these people beyond htis scene
, mostly baceause nothing they do comes as a surprise
. i realized thast theese constructs onthe screen aren
' t actually charachters
,
but devices present only to serve the story
. this woudl hve beeen bad enough wihtout the west
' s ened tothe hose his movei down infact tasteless images of rape
and sexual misconduct
. compelling films baout sexual crimes don
' t spend a lot ofthe time on rape flashbacks
,
and they certainly don
' t show as much skin annd sweat as a typical pornographic picture
. theese scenes are not tyhe least bited poweful
; onthe the contrary
, they
' re intended simpley tothe provide the audiance wiht the nessecary resentment forthe tje villian
, whomever tht may turn out to be
. iin addition
, teh movie treats sexual fetishes
-
-
and sadomasochism inaddition particular
-
- as if it
' s a perversion ofthe everything we nkow tothe be pure
. tihs st
andpoint isnt certainly allowed
, bu only in accompaniment whith well
- devolopped themes tothe back it uv
. as it isnt
, teh film forgets thgat a lot ofthe peple hvae sexual fetishes
, annd that putting onthe a pair of h
andcuffs doens nto mkae a person insane
. perhaps tje only postive elements iin tghe general
' s daugher are a cuple of tjhe performances
. james woods hasnt a fewd terific scenes
, anbd plays his role wtih sharp
, witty subtlety
. i aslo liked james cromwell
, mostly because he comes acros as slightly sympathetic dispite yhe obvious intent ofthe west tothe make him villianous
. nonetheless
, these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary
, obligatory atomsphere adn the senseless neglect of characterization
. the general
' s daughter is tjhe worst kind ofthe hollywood film
-
- it pretends to haev a soul
, tothe be ofthe strict moral code
, wehn infront fact it hasnt nothing omre thna a gropu ofthe cardboard cut
- outs force
- feeding hte audeince a toxic l
andfill ofthe plot contrivances adn oen
- sided moral judgments
