michael crichton hasnt had a long career of writing novels
, many ofthe which are science fiction
. the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton sciece fiction novel
. so in tyhe logic ofthe the film inudstry a good way to amking a profitable film woudl be tothe amke a big
- budget adaptions ofthe anohter crichton sicence fiction novel
. congo failed
, annd i am affraid that sphere is probaly nto gogin to fare a whole lot better
. it a littel better than just okay novel annd it makes a film that isnt not even tht ogod
. tghe film is expensive
, over oney hundered million dollars
; isnt long
, 133 minutes
; hasnt a terrific cast
, including dustin hoffman
, samuel l
. jackson
,
and sharon stone
; bu has little that isnt really original
and less that is exicting
. several years ago dr
. norman goodman
( palyed by dustin hoffman
) was asked to write up a set of procedures for tjhe govenment to follow if an aline entity was actually encountered
. tghe plan he wrote was onyl semi
- serious
,
but did explictly edfine a team of experts who should investingate tyhe aline
. nowe thast team has beeen assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes
( peter coyote
) to studdy a spacecraft almsot a half mile in lenght tht aparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s
. suddenly norman
' s less than serious proceedure has become an action plan fo dealing iwth a real alien spacecraft
. included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
,
and astrophysicist ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
. together they travel tothe thge deepo pacific spaceship tothe underst
and its secrets
. oen major secret isnt hte meaning of the huge sphere of gold
- toned liquid metal at the heart ofthe htis spaceship
. whta is disappointing baout this film isnt that it does nto have realy effective performances
. directer barry levinson isnt at his best with good actors rether thna ogod special effects
. teh probelm here is he isnt making a big
- budget science fiction film
. it hasnt smoe effects
, bu tghe most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a raadr screen
. the technique is tothe suggest rather than tothe show adn let teh actors anbd the viewer
' s imagination cary the film as robert wise did with the haunting
. that could be a reasonable approach in a low
- budget film
. bu that requires creating much moreso atmosphere thna levinson cant manaze to muster
. it requires the actors to give really compelling performances adn simply put
, they don
' t
. hoffman
' s acting seems muted
. jackson seems to layed back
. we do nto feel for theese cahracters annd do nto get inside their heads
. levinson paide big bucks fo his actors
and does not realy get price performance
. adn why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary onthe yhe expedition is anybody
' s guess
. a casted ofthe unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction ofthe tjhe price
. look how much mroe powerfull a film liuke aline ws wih only moderate actors
. most scinece fiction spectaculars theese dyas have second
- tier actors
and firt
- tier special effects
. levinson tries second
- tier effects
,
and first
- tier actors
,
but never makes that exchange pay off for yhe viewer
. perheaps sci
- fi spectaulars are jsut nto an actro
' s medium
. the result gets a 4 on the 0 tothe 10 scale
and 0 on tyhe
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
