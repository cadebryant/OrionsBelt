the summer ofthe 00
' wasn
' t a very good oney for devout cinephiles
. it offred no blair witches or sixth senses
; teh best big budget hollywood sould dont wass an effecient x
- men adaptation anbd a flawed bu intertaining shaft update
. nurse betty signals the unoffical end of that dreadful summer movei season
and tghe comencement of a potentially brighter fall movei season
, tyhat battery
- charging
( at least forthe criticists who hvae tothe sit through eveyr piece o
' shit tath moseys inot multiplexes
) tyme of eyar whn all thsoe oscar contenders
( read
:
" quality
" films
) compete forthe audiences
. alas betty has the dubious distinction ofthe being the frist overpraised junk heap of the newyorker season
. it
' s also indie director neil la
bute
' s firt attemp at something ressembling a mainstream picture
,
and i
' m sad to report it
' s a resounding failure
( at least on this web site
)
, a mess thyat
' s as hopelessly saccharine as people ahev accussed la
bute
' s previous films ofthe bieng unrelentingly masochistic
. i went inthe expecting something decent
, for betty was gleefully praised
, it
' s screenplay even winning an award at cannes
,
but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment
. are critics so esperate fo something unique that tehy
' re blind to how derivative tje parituclar br
and ofthe
" uniqueness
" betty dolls outloud isnt
? for tyhe frist time la
bute is working ffrom a scirpt he has not written
, anbd he seems unsure ofthe how to h
andle teh material
. betty tries tothe be hip like pulp fiction
( this isnt another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright adn articulate hitted men
)
, exchanching like thte wizard ofthe oz
( ofthe whihc thsi film mkaes several allusions to
)
and heartwarming like
[ stick inthe your favorite loveable misfit movei
]
, bu by thge end it left me cold whith its caluculated despiration
. it
' s la
bute
' s half hearted atempt tothe make a crowd pleaser annd he doesn
' t even seem to have half that heart in it
. nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict
, betty
( brilliantly palyed by renee zellweger
)
, who witnesses the killing ofthe her husban
, del
( aaron eckhart palying tyhe most casually loutish husban usance richard benjamin in diary ofthe a mad housewife
) by two hitted men
( morgan freeman
and chris rock
)
. she happens to haev her most beloved soap onthe in the background
and somehow merges the twpo realities
. she
' s blocked outloud her husban
' s death
and thikns she
' s a character iin her favorite soap
, a reason tothe loev
. betty sets outloud on yhe road to la
( wtih some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk
) searching for her soap boyfriend dr
. david ravell
( greg kinnear
) hwile teh twpo bickering hit men folow inspite nto so close persuit
. the la
bute who birthed tyhe extrodinary infront the comapany of men
, slipped a bited
(
but not much
) withthe his sophmore effort
, your firends adn neighbors
, thne fell straight onthe his ass withthe bash
, a play he penned that wass recently aired on showtime
. thge play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist
, onyl la
bute
' s persistence inspite wallowing in thte horrid things
" averege
" peple dont to each otehr
, usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are
. in hte play
, paul rudd
, as an obnoxious jock
, delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom
and beated him maeby to death
, while his clueless girlfriend essentialy regardes his sadistic behaviors as something along tjhe ood maxim
" boys iwll be boys
"
. anohter character
, schlubby businessman reacts to the loss ofthe his job by actually killing his own baby
! what ws once so powerful about la
bute
' s work
, the casual
, nonchalant cruelty anbd selfishness
( oftenly elements we all hvea inthe us amplified tothe a disgusting degree
) hadnt become so over the top it was borderline comic
. obviously
, at thsi point
, la
bute sould use a dose ofthe soem differant kind of material befor he pigeon holes himself furhter
,
but nurse betty isn
' t it
. he clearly hasnt little passion forthe what he
' s doing here
, instead replacing his mojo iwth strained quirks
( one of hte hit men is a huge soap fan
,
and tje character ofthe betty owudl be littel omre than a oen joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn
' t managed tothe trancend thyat
) tailor made to appeal tothe the widest possable audiance
. nearly every scene between chris rock anbd morgan freeman fatally slows tje picture down
, as tjhe two are made to inact soft
- boiled tarantino
- esque dialogue
. they evince little chemistry
, with rock constantly in over tje top rant mode
, acting more liek an angry comic than any thign ressembling a hit man
( an occupation thta
' s represented far too frequentily iin movies nowdays
)
. i htink rock isnt a gerat comic
yet he hasn
' t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies
, whenever he acts
,
and noone matter the part
, it
' s liuke he
' s doign yhe damn chris rock sohw
. suprisingly
( at least concidering her work inaddition me
, myself
and irene
) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance
, buidling on her baby faced
, aple pie looks
. that wide
- ope face annd helium voiced earnestness suggests a littel girl not fully grown inot her thirty
- year
- old body
. it
' s tjhe best work she
' s ever done
. freeman isnt effective as always
,
though his performance nontheless suffers because it seems at odds wtih where the movei wnats tothe tkae it
. the ator plays thge role in his usual calm
, collected manner
,
though thte flick trys to incinuate a symbolic kinship beetwen his character
and betty
' s
, suggesting thast both are controlled by their fantasies rather thna reality
. that
' s intresting
but tje movie doesn
' t do anytying withthe it otehr than crash l
and hte sub
- theme inot a labored speek in tghe midst ofthe a badly staged gun battle
. thge film hasnt good moments
( many ofthe teh scenes involving a vyer ogod greg kinnear
, especialy his confrontation withthe zellweger
)
, an almost soothing
, lyrical scoer
(
and you know a movie
' s in trouble when the scroe sticks out as oen ofthe the best things about it
) bu nothing jells
, it
' s parts
, ogod or bad
, are so disparate as to be opposing
. tghe film might have worked had it settled on being one type ofthe film
, a mainstream
, female forrest gump or an oddball art film
, bu as both if it falls as flat as diet coke
. betty
' s screenplay makse the mistake of relying too much on concurrence
, wihtout hwihc betty wouldn
' t amke any progress infact yhe film
. nurse betty isnt a film driven by coincidence rather than charter
, liuke how betty becomes a nurse in the film
, a job thast she tkaes inspite order to get closer tothe her imagenary lover
; she happens tothe be at the hospital at the excact moent tht a drive by shooting takes palce anbd miraculously knows how tothe take care of the victum
' s wound because she happened tothe see how onthe tv
, whlch leads to her bieng offred a room iwth tjhe victim
' s girlfriend who evenhtually gets betty inot a party where she meets kinnear
?
?
? a little too tidy
, don
' tcha think
. betty has an interesting theme
,
though it doesn
' t even seem aware ofthe thsi
. tyhe current state of tv has been leaning towords reality television what iwth the enormous success ofthe survivor
and moderate sucess ofthe big brother
, with more on tjhe way
. thsi isnt a film baout a women so deluded as to think thast her favorite soap opera is reality
( ironicaly real
- life survivor sean kennif hasnt taked a part as a doctor onthe thge soap opera guiding light
)
. instade of exploring thsi timely matter inthe a way relating to tyhe curent tv craze
( sicne the film does largly apearing tothe be a satire of television
, albiet one taht woudl feel omre appropropiate in the
' 80s thna the
' 00s
)
, tyhe film simpley uses betty
' s delusions as a plot divice tothe get her from point a tothe b
. no progress is made
and little isnt unearthed exept that maybe la
bute sould uise a bited ofthe rest
and a lot ofthe contemplation
