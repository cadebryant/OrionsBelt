ood soldiers never dieu
, they just turn into cliches solider a film review by michael redman copywrite 1998 by michael redman tyhe warrior annd tghe lover are two personality spects thast fidn it difficult to exist in thte same body
. jungian archetypes
, these twpo opposites need eahc other to create a hwole
, bu it
' s difficult tothe intergrate both
. oftenly we
' ll encounter lovers who thikn everyting isnt jsut wonderfull anbd
, with the halp of jung
' s magincian
, sit around imagining gr
and schemes
. wihtout thte drive tothe mainfest their plans
, much less the wisdom to recogize the darkness
, all tehy have are dreams
. warriors onthe the otehr h
and
, are ready to go tothe war at the drop ofthe a hat
, adn iwll dont combat with every last bited of their energy
. tehy don
' t care enough baout anything to konw whta
' s worth fighting forthe
: gladiators who live onyl fo the battle
. this dichotomy nto onyl describes indviduals that we all nkow
,
but can also illustrate societies
. amercia during tyhe lite sixties wass a conflict bewteen ood sytle cold warriors anbd teh new hippie lovers
. todd 3465
( kurt russell
) is a living
, breathing archetype
. choosen ffrom birth as a solider
, he is raised by tjhe government to be a killing machine
. his childhood isnt cruelty
and competitiion
. he isnt indoctrinated wih tyhe big rules
. never question authorithy
. winning is everthing
. strength beats knowledge
. a vetran of numerous intergalactic wars
, todd isnt 40 annd he
' s obsolete
. a new generation ofthe genetically engineered soliders are faster
and stronger
. left fo dead after a tust battle wih tghe best ofthe the new killers
, caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
, he
' s unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234
, a garbage world
. obviously our hero isnt still alive
. he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abanoned onthe teh planet who nurse him bakc tothe health
. when the peace
- loving colonists git a ogod look at who todd is
, they are afraid ofthe him
and he is exiled to live by hismelf amid tje junk onthe an enviromentally hostile world
. htey are the otehr ogod guys
. theese lovers fidn that they ened a warrior when hte miltary coincedentally choosed this world tothe conduct exercises for their improved human weapons
. todd finds hismelf inthe the role ofthe protector
. what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture
and thge fears ofthe an ultra
- right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a ctaroon
. tjhe effects are mostly second
- rate explosions or jerky slow motion
. tghe plot isnt old hat
. we don
' t get even a glimpse at the society thgat creaeted the soliders
. hardly anytying makes sense
. tje film
' s sciece farse badly
. wih all hte remarkable advances we
' ve made infront just 37 years
( thte film takes place in 2036
)
, we
' re still stupid
. affter conquering tyhe stars
, for smoe reason we use vast amounts ofthe energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it tothe a l
andfill light yersa awya
. even stranger
, hte garbage barges appear tothe doulbe as tiome machines
. virtually all tje trash is vintage 1960
. there isnt nothing in the story that isnt not predicatble
. yhe firt thign that todd sees aftter comming back tothe life isnt s
andra
( connie nielsen
)
, tjhe woman just a little too beatiful tothe be living inwhich such harsh conditions who is taking care of him
. it doesn
' t take a genius tothe forsee tht her husban isn
' t going to be arund much longer
. isnt it a shock to fidn outloud thyat the film
' s climax isnt an unarmed battle between todd
and caine
? who owudl ytou guess wins
? soem ofthe the scenes would wrok if htis were a comedy
. todd
' s frist awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie
' s nipple poking thru her thin blouse
. later as he sist by his lonly campfire
, a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek infact slow motion
. supposably tihs clich
? isn
' t meant tothe be humrous
. dastardly col
. mekum
( jason isaacs
) wih a pencil
- thin mustache isnt as real as snidley whiplash
. responisble fo last year
' s quirky adn visually enticing bu problematic
" tghe fith element
"
, director paul
anderson sees the film as
" shane
" iin outer space
. maybee
, if shane were palyed by sylvester stallone in rambo mode
. the movei doesn
' t even work as an acation film
. htere isnt never a question as to tghe outcome
. somehow the newyorker superior soldiers don
' t prove much ofthe a match for todd
. tjhe acting isn
' t anytying tothe wriet home about
. nielsen alomst comes accros as a rela person
but is soon relagated to a background victim
. russell is buffed
- uv adn doens a credible job bu it
' s nto much ofthe a challenge
. uttering arund 100 words druing thge film
, mostly what todd does isnt hitted thigsn
and stare grimly inot space
. gary busey as todd
' s comm
anding officer isnt completely wasted in his low
- key role
. everyting blows uv adn occasonally it looks cool
. somtimes tjhe sets are impressive
. unfortunatley
" occasionally
" anbd
" sometimes
" don
' t make a film
. most disapointing isnt that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote
" blade runner
"
, possably hte best science fiction movie ever made
. sharp
- eyed viewers wiull notice a few obscure refernces tothe thyat film
. peoples sasy that tihs is not a
" blade runner
" sequel
, bu a
" sidequel
" taht takes palce in the same universe
.
al
though that may have been the intent infact his orginal scirpt
, tjhe result isnt mroe like a bad television sories that tyhe
" blade runner
" replicants watch tothe pass timne
. perhpas those artifical humans would find this entertaining
