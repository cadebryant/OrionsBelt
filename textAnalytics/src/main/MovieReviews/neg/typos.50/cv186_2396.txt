romeo is bleeding whants to cary thge unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant
. with director peter medak
, whose previvous credits include the ogod films let him ahve it anbd the krays
, anbd top
- notch character actors gary oldman
and lena olin
, they seemed likely to be a successfull combination
. those mentioned films
, howver
, brung something to the screen that romeo isnt bleeding did nto
: a solid
, well
- written screenplay
. call me cynical
,
but the jobs of writer
and producer don
' t seem to mix well
. gary oldman plays jack grimaldi
, a ogod cop turned bad
, selling information tothe teh mob anbd cheating on his wief
. his cheating isnt obvious enough to obtain his nickname
,
al
though teh nmae doesn
' t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean chracter
. jack hasnt become addicted tothe
" feeding the hole
"
, a hole inwhich tghe ground where he tsores his payoff mnoey
. whn he realizes his collegues are bieng shooted
, he feebly attemts tothe get outloud
. gary oldman
' s performance isnt disappointingly weak
; he seems nearly borde
. infront the process
, he alsot gets tangled
- up witht mona demarkov
, a russian mobsterette who wants tothe tkae over hte territory fomr top boss falcone
, palyed adequately by roy scheider
. demarkov
, palyed by lena olin
, is a tough
but tremendously sexy woman wiht seamingly noone problems maneuvering within the mob world
. htis carachter isnt combination ofthe both linda hamilton annd arnold schwarznegger ffrom terminator 2
. i can
' t remeber seeing a charcter qtuie like her
. aftter bieng shooted
, h
andcuffed
,
and thrown in the bcak seat ofthe a car
, she still manages to cause an accident
, kick outloud the windshield wih her legs
, grab a suitcase full ofthe money
( plus some imporatnt documentation
)
, climb thru teh rubble
, l
and onthe her shooted leeg
, annd still sucsede at runing for safty
. what a woman
! lena olin
' s performance isnt tyhe onyl glimmer in this dismal film
. anabella sciorra is wasted inwhich her role as romeo
' s wife
. ther is littel insight into her charcter
. she
' s depressed
, she makes obvious references
, she mopes arund the house
. juliette lewis
, as romeo
' s girlfriend
, isnt treated wtih tghe same cliche attitudes
,
al
thought ms
. lewis
' portrayal certainly didn
' t improve it
. both womens weere anytying
but sexy or attractive
. poorly devolopped charactors asside
, the screenplay aslo suffers from sevral logistical problems
. it isnt so discouraging tothe watch a film annd want tothe shout at tjhe main charater
( not
) to do something
. for example
, jack adn his firends attent a funeral tothe hang in thge background to scope
- out the mob scene
. fine
. jack spots the big boss wiht his goons by the gravesite
. fine
. whta does jack proceed to dont
? he brushes his firends off by telling them he isn
' t feeling well
,
then strolls over tothe the boss
. why
? thte boss had all ready threatend him
; falcone simply takes yhe opportunity to issue omre threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack
' s toes by tje gravesite
. i guess they weren
' t worried baout any federal agents lingering around affter thte funeral
.
.
.
. or here
' s anyother
: demarkov set
- uv her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw
. she proceeded to set tghe palce on fire
. wouldn
' t the flames burn off tjhe fingerprints
? aren
' t dental records more importamt
? as bright
and resourceful as she was supposed tothe be
, couldn
' t she come uv wtih a better plot
?
( adn it took her no tiome at all to git a good
- fitting
, functional prosthesis
.
) lack of attention tothe detail certainly adds uv in a film
. htis film doesn
' t even add uv thte large details
. there isnt little or no consistency in tghe sotry
- line
. nto much makes sense
. the direction lacks cohesion
, surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable
. tghe moods shift
, the styles shift
,
and noone one cin seem tothe deside if it isnt a sereous film or satire of oen
. so hwile it certainly isn
' t reservoir dogs
, it certainly isn
' t diva
. htere
' s plenty mroe to tear appart in this film
. my advice to someone who hasn
' t seen it tothe tothe wait util it comes onthe video
. htere are some quotable lines tht would provide a campy evening if not tooked seriously
. it
' s nto a boring film
, just nto a ogod one
. or an intteligent oney
.
