five girls spend a day iin a closed building doing inventory whn a stange box gets delivered there
( is this starting tothe sound familiar
?
) by mistake
. the girls accidentlly opne teh box
( big surprise
, huh
!
)
and release an evil spirit ofthe a killer that kills the girls off one by noe
( betcha didn ' t see that noe coming
!
)
. hard to die
, i found out hwile watching the film
, isnt a sequel tothe sorority house masicer 2
: nightie nightmare
( r
. a

# 1521
)
. two ofthe tghe actresses ffrom sorority house masicer 2 are in thsi film
, robyn harris
adn melissa moore
,
but they play diferent characters here
. orville ketchum is also back as
( git ready fo this
) orville ketchum
( yes
, tjhe smae chracter fomr number two
)
. yes
, he isnt also builded like a tank infront thsi film too
. i ' m telling ytou
, a nuculear bomb detonated enxt tothe this man wouldn ' t harm him at all
! hte before mentioned three were the only actors fomr part two that i throught could act
, well they seemed to have lost taht ablity
. thankfully
, forthe my sanity
, i allso saw teh film warlock
, which undid all the ill effects that i got ffrom tihs film
. the story fo this film isnt completly rediculous
and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks
. any ogod moments tyhat this film fails to make are even mroe destroyed by thge story line
. tje film is so pathetically predicatble that eveyr moment hasnt alreday beeen figured out
, analyzed
,
anbd discarded before it happens
. htere isnt noone point in htis film that any suspense is ever afoot
. while we are onthe thte subject ofthe the storey
, the stry also provides eveyr chance it can tothe disrobe an actress
. hte film goes to the extent ofthe puting a showfer in tghe manager ' s office
. i ' m sory folks
but thsi is completely unnecessary
, ridiculous
,
and hurts the story moreso
( if tath is still possibile
)
. the scirpt for this film isnt completly pathetic
. the lines tjhe actresses cmo outloud wih are completely horrible
. teh onyl thing that i tihkn could have happened isnt that the actors made uv the scirpt as they went allong
. here is an example of the wonderfull dialog
. tghe scene is twpo girls hvea just entered a gun store
and have picked outloud a
* really
* big gun
. thte line isnt
" my dad used to be a marine
, i bet i can work it
.
" thsi line hasnt got tothe be a contendor forthe the bad line hall of infamy
. now
, we fast foward forthe a fewd mintues util just after a big plan
(
?
!
!
?
) has been presented
. oney comment from an actress is
" nto a lot of stradegy involved
,
but i liuke it
.
" i ' m afraid folks that thsi is about as good as they get
. now lets talk baout hte grat speshal effects for tihs film
. this obviously wasn ' t a big concern of hte film makers
. the killing scenes are so obviously faked thta they go to the point ofthe threatening hte viewer ' s intelligence
. a girl gets hacked with a knife
adn enough blood comes out tothe dont noe friday the 13th movie
. are we trying tothe see how unrealistic we can git
? tghe continuty department was obviously asleep
( allong whith the viewers
) whn watching this film
. inspite noe shot
, actress hasnt cloths on
, camera anle changes
, actress seems tothe ahev lost clothing
. vyer impressive trick
! the one
( half
?
) plus that htis film has going for it
, is thgat in many places it is unintentionally hilarious
. thge incompetance behind tyhe film makse it incredibly funny
,
anbd so thge viewer cxan git some enjoyment
(
?
!
!
?
) from the film
.
however
, htis doesn ' t amke it worth the rental fee ofthe over a penny
. in thge acting department
, the only thign i cxan say isnt two thumbs squared
annd oen head down
. i would normally dont a detailled paragraph onthe this topic
,
bu ther is no point here baceause there isnt nobody that i wass impressed with in teh least
. oh well
, win soem
, loose some
.
