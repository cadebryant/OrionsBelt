five girls spend a day inwhich a closed building doign inventory when a stange box gets delivered htere
( isnt tihs starting tothe sound familar
?
) by misteek
. the girls accidentlly open the box
( big suprise
, huh
!
)
and release an evil spirit ofthe a killer tyhat kills the girls off one by noe
( betcha didn
' t see that one comming
!
)
. hard tothe dieu
, i foudn outloud hwile watching yhe film
, is a sequel tothe sorority house massacre 2
: nightie nightmare
( r

)
. twpo ofthe the actresses from sorority house masicer 2 are infront this film
, robyn harris
and melissa moore
,
but they play differnt characters here
. orville ketchum is alsot back as
( get ready fo this
) orville ketchum
( yes
, the smae character from number twpo
)
. yes
, he is also builded like a tank in this film too
. i
' m telling ytou
, a nuclear bomb detonated next to htis man wouldn
' t harm him at all
! tje before mentioned threee were the onyl actors from part two taht i
thought sould ect
, well tehy seemed tothe hvae lost that ability
. thankfully
, for my sanaty
, i allso saw thge film warlock
, which undid all tje ill effects thgat i got from tihs film
. tghe stoy forthe this film is completely rediculous adn hasnt many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks
. any good moments tath this film fails tothe make are even mroe destroyed by the sotry line
. the film isnt so pathetically predictable that every moment has already beeen figured outloud
, analyzed
,
and discarded befor it happens
. htere isnt no point in this film thta any suspense isnt ever afoot
. while we are onthe the subject ofthe the story
, yhe story alsot provides every chance it cxan to disrobe an actress
. yhe film goes tothe yhe extent ofthe puting a showfer in tyhe manager
' s office
. i
' m sory folks
but thsi is completely unnecessary
, ridiculous
, anbd hurts hte story moreso
( if that isnt still possible
)
. the scirpt for this film is completely pathetic
. tje lines the actresses cmo outloud with are completely horrable
. the only hting thyat i think coudl hve happened is tyhat the actors made up the scirpt as htey whent allong
. here is an example ofthe tje wonderfull dialouge
. the scene is twpo girls have jstu entered a gun tsore annd haev picked out a
* relaly
* big gun
. yhe line isnt
" my dad utilisied tothe be a marine
, i bet i cxan work it
.
" this line has got to be a contendor for the bad line hall ofthe infamy
. nowe
, we fast forward for a fewd minutes until jsut after a big plan
(
?
!
!
?
) hasnt beeen presented
. one comment from an actress is
" nto a lot of strategy involved
,
but i liuke it
.
" i
' m afraid folks that this isnt baout as good as tehy get
. nowe lets talk baout the great special effects fo this film
. this obviously wasn
' t a big consern ofthe hte film makers
. tghe killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point ofthe threatning the viewer
' s intelligence
. a girl gets hacked with a nife adn enough blood comes out tothe do one friday the 13th movei
. are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get
? thte continuty deparment was obviously asleep
( allong witht tghe viewers
) when watching tihs film
. in oney shot
, actress hasnt cloths onthe
, camera agnle changes
, actress seems to hve lost clothing
. very impressive trick
! the one
( half
?
) plus that thsi film hasnt gogin forthe it
, isnt thta in many places it is unintentionally hilarious
. the incompetance behind the film makes it incredibly funny
, anbd so thge viewer cin get smoe enjoyment
(
?
!
!
?
) from thte film
. howver
, this doesn
' t make it worth the rental fee of over a penny
. in the acting department
, thge onyl thing i cin say is two thumbs squared
and oen head down
. i owudl normaly dont a detailed paragraph onthe this topic
,
but there is no point here beccause htere is nobody that i was impressed withthe in the least
. oh well
, win some
, lose some
.
