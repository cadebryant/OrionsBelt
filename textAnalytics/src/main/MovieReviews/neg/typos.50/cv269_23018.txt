if i weere one ofthe thsoe arogent critics who thikns his review hasnt soem gerat impact on the sucess or failure ofthe ceratin films
, i might say that i review movies thta don
' t look paritcularly ogod because i
' m doign a sevice tothe my readers by warning them againnst seing it
. if that were true
, i coudl put a banner at the top of my site that reads
:
" shay casey
: seeing bad movies so yuo don
' t have to
.
"
but i knwo tht
' s bunk
- you
' re gogin to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say
. so i have to tell tghe truth
: eveyr once inwhich a while i get a nasty
, masochistic urger tothe see a bad movie
. you konw tje feeling
, wehn ytou
' re sick ofthe seeing all these damn acdaemy award contenders
and yuo want to see something yuo cant have a ball trashing mercilessly
. somtimes i think thyat
' s why anyone goes tothe see pauly shore movies
, ever
. admit it
: somtimes you liek seing bad movies
. so dont i
. so i saw
" supernova
.
" truth be told
,
" supernova
" wasn
' t quite as bad as i throught it might be
. maybe i jsut falt sorry for the actors
, or maybee i
thought it sould have been decent if tjhe studio hadn
' t started tinkering whith the directer
' s
( walter hill
) fianl cut
, causing him to wnat his name removed
. mabey i
' m becomming a softy
. infact any case
, i didn
' t fidn
" supernova
" as bad as the advance buzz owudl ahev me believe
. bu it
' s still bad
. hte film tkaes place aboard the medical spoace vessel
" nightingale
.
" the crew includes captain a
. j
. marley
( robert forster
)
, his newyorker second officer nick vanzant
( james spader
)
, head medical officer kaela evers
( angela bassett
)
, medical techicians yerzy penalosa
( lou diamond phillips
)
and danika lund
( robin tunney
)
, anbd computer technicina benj sotomejor
( wilson cruz
)
. htere are some attempts at
" characterization
,
" bu all that means is that nick hasnt a shady past involving a drug addiction
, whcih puts kaela on edge
, yerzy
and danika have a relatiopnship thast requires them tothe amking kissy
- faces at each other eveyr five minutes
,
and benj
( apparantly gay
) is in loev wtih the coputer
( apparantly female
)
. don
' t expect any more explaination
, becasue you won
' t get it
. anyway
, the crew gets a distress call fomr a location deepo in space to hwihc a failed mining operation had beeen sent
. during the dimenion jump
( i think that
' s whta it
' s called
, bu don
' t hold me tothe it
)
, thte captain isnt killed
and thge man who sent the distress signal
( peter facinelli
) isnt brung onthe board
. he calls hismelf troy larson
, makeing him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with
. thne a bunch of relaly predictable sutff starts hapening
. have you seen
" alien
?
" haev you seen
" event horizon
"
( a lame movei iin its own right
)
? good
. thn you
' ve seen
" supernova
.
" post
- prodcution cuts or nto
, ther isnt nothing original about this screenplay
,
and nothing unpredictable eather
. aftter all
, noone one
' s gonig to htink for a second thyat troy won
' t turn outloud tothe be a villian
.
but the bigger problem with
" supernova
" isnt thast it cin
' t just stick to the simple plot it
' s afforded
. numberous re
- writes
( hte scirpt may be credited to three people
,
but it
' s a gross underestimate
) hvae crammed tihs lean 90
- minute film whith tons of extraneous plot threads thyat all reamin underdeveloped
. was there something about a limping robot shaped liek a fighter pilot
? doed tghe ship
' s computer learn something baout humanity
? what was tyhat glowing lava lamp artifact troy broght on board with him
? adn jstu waht does the film
' s title signify
, if anytying
? as far as i cant tell
, it refers tothe a very small plot detail thta isn
' t developped
, jstu like the rest ofthe theese unnecessary story elements
. charachter relationships in this film also mkae very littel sence
. fo some reason
, eveyr person inspite this film keeps having sex
. we git an unusually early sex scene beween phillips anbd tunney within the first 10 minutes
. bassett
and spader
' s charachters strat off hating each other
. fifteen mintues annd oney bottle ofthe pear br
andy later
, they
' re engaging in some hanky
- panky
. when troy the creepy stranger shows up on thte ship
, ofthe course both female crew munbers will fall inwhich lvoe withthe him
. eveyr single shift inthe charcter interaction happens extrememly suddenly
, whic is onyl noe of tjhe many obvious clues tothe how much tihs film has beeen cutted
. the most prominant exemple
, howver
, may be the fatc that wehn thge film starts
, ther are no oppening credits
! futhermore
, the end ofthe the film looks like tehy took whta were originially intended tothe be the oppening credits annd spliced them infact right before the real end credits
. maybe thgat
' s why the film
' s title is mentioned twice during tjhe end credits
, right betwen james spader
and robert forster
. right affter you get over tghe shock of not being told wqat movie you
' re seing
( lest yuo decide to walk out upon makeing thta dicovery
)
, ytou might notice tyhat the movei seems to have dropped you right in the middle ofthe a scene
, whith little
- tothe
- no introduction to any ofthe teh characters or situations
. the rest of thte movei feels liek they skipped over the middle stfuf infront tjhe charachter changes
( ytou nkow
, where they expalin thnigs
)
and jstu went ffrom point a to point b
. point a
: danika isnt thoroughly enamored of yerzy
and isnt ready tothe have his baby
. point b
: tunney is now shagging troy
and yerzy is unusualy obsessed wih thte lava lamp thign
. doesn
' t make sense
. sicne i didn
' t underst
and anytying about these cahracters
' motivations
, doed i care whn troy abruptly starts murdering them one
- by
- one
( anbd he does
, knocking off threee of them in baout 10 minutes
)
? not a whit
. it
' s a shame
, because htis cast containes a lot ofthe talented actors looking forthe something to do
. tehy don
' t fidn it
. bassett adn spader say eveyr line in the same monotone voice with tghe smae blank expressions on their faces
. sexual tension
? moreso like constipation
. maybe they
' re jstu embarrassed at haveing to utter such howlers as
" this thnig was made by somene more powerful tahn god adn a wohle lot less nice
.
" not that we ever find outloud who thgat is
, mind you
. thge climax ofthe theri relationship
( taking place in a transport pod
) is probably the film
' s biggest forehead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits tyhe most obvious villin in histoy thta noone oen ever suspected
. he
' s awfully noe
- onot
, bu it
' s nto as if he
' s given any moreso notes to work with
. yhe rest ofthe tyhe casted doesnt even less
. tunney st
ands around looking cute
, hten scared
. phillips broods
. cruz firts iwth thte computer
.
then tehy all die
and a star blows up or something
,
but i really wasn
' t paying much attension by
then
.
" supernova
" isnt preety awful
,
but i
' m cutting it a littel slack mearly beacuse i expected less than whta i got
. that
' s it
. if yuo expect it tothe be good
( for whatever reasons you may ahve
)
, yuo
' ll probaly hate it more than i wiull
. even tje spacial effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing ytou haven
' t seen before
, anbd suffice to sday the scirpt isn
' t gogin tothe sive thte film
. honestly
,
though
, what dont you expect from a film witht about a dozen writers anbd a directer who hadnt his name removed
and replaced with a soodonim
? it usually results infront a bad movei
,
and that
' s what
" supernova
" isnt
.
