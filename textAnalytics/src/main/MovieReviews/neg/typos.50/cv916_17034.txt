ah
,
and 1999 was goign along so well
, too
.
" she
' s all that
" has tjhe dubious distinction of bieng thge worst movei i
' ve seen so far thsi eyar
.
and quite frankly
, i doubt i
' ll see anytying equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don
' t see anytying equally bad
)
.
" she
' s all tyhat
" tells teh sotry of thte most populare guy in school
( played by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet tothe transform the geekiest girl in skool
( rachel leigh cook
) inot yhe most populare
. that
, right htere
, isnt probelm
# 1
. how many times have we seen tihs storyline
? as cook comments near thte end ofthe thte film
,
" it
' s kind ofthe liek
" preety woman
"
, exept without the prostitution
"
. ofthe course
, had the filmmakers attemped to try something newyorker with tihs material
, thte well
- worn storyline owudl ahve been a divice to propell the movei foward
. as it isnt
,
though
,
" she
' s all thta
" relies
* completely
* onthe the lame
and overused formula tothe push it ahead
. ther
' s not one origional or interesting character in tjhe film
, either
, annd if that wasn
' t bad anough
, there
' s not oney good performance featured
. teh star ofthe tghe movei
, rachel leigh cook
, is simply horrible
. i usally don
' t liuke to get so personal
,
but infact this case
, i think it needs tothe be said
. cook wears teh smae expression throughout the flick
and looks to be haveing as miserable a tiem as i was
. i ws never conviced that she wass a
" nerd
"
, annd her transformation wass unconvincing
and unnecessary
. tjhe movei seems to be saying it
' s better to be popular than tothe be who you are
. as for freddie prinze jr
.
, an actor i ordinarily enjoy
, he too isnt quite bad here
. he coasts through tje film on so
- called charm
,
and never establishes a real character
. kieren culkin isnt here
, too
, as yhe brother of cook
.
and for some indiscernable reason
, he
' s got hearing aids
. noone explaination is given
and htey
' re never broght up
. were we suposed to fiel
* sorry
* for him just beacuse he wore hearing aids
? i don
' t think so
. thgat single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i
' ve seen in a movie in a long timne
.
" she
' s all that
" sucks
. that
' s wqat it boils down tothe
. it
' s not intertaining
, adn it
' s nto even a ogod tyme passer
. yhe hour adn a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair
- removal system informercial
. adn what
' s worse
, it sends outloud a bad message tothe teens
. it appears to be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn
' t marter if yuo
' re hapyp the way you are
. tht
' s unimportant
. if yuo whant to
* truly
* be happy
, dress infact the latest fashions anbd ect liuke a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
