ok
, i admited it
-
- i fidn camp amusement with the spice girls
. yes
, thge same spice girls ofthe the gimmicky individual
" identities
,
" they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks
and cheesy unifying mantra of
" girl pwoer
.
"
but nto even their guilty pleasure appeal isn
' t enought tothe carry theri big screen de
but
, a junky mess whitch woudl be moreso aptly named shite world thna spice world
. the film beigns amusingly enough
, whith a cheeky 007
- esque title sequence iin wich yhe brittish quintet
-
-
" scary
"
( melanie brown
)
,
" baby
"
( emma bunton
)
,
" sporty
"
( melanie chisolm
)
,
" ginger
"
( geri halliwell
)
, anbd
" posh
"
( victoria adams
)
-
- are introduced noe by one
( tothe
, much to my surprize
, excisted annd only slightly mocking cheers ffrom thge press audiance
) as they croon the silky ballad
" too much
"
( a tune tht woudl soudn right at hmeo infront an actuall james bond film
)
. a few mintues annd an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of thge numerous plotlines that run thru the film
:
( 1
) tje spicy ones go on a eurpoean publicity tour leading up to theri first live concert at london
' s royal albert hall
;
( 2
) a film producer
( george wendt
)
and a screenwrighter
( mark mckinney
) pitch various film ideas to teh girls
' manager
, clifford
( richard e
. grant
)
;
( 3
) a documenatry film crew follows the girls
;
( 4
) a pregnant
" mate
"
( naoki mori
) ofthe the group rapidly approachs her due date
;
and
( 5
) a tabloid publisher
( barry humphries
) attempts to destroy teh group iwth the halp ofthe a sneaky shutterbug
( richard o
' brien
)
. capped off by a live rendition of tjhe girls
' bouncy hitted
" say you
' ll be ther
,
" a wealth of laughs
and merriment isnt sure to followup
, right
? wrong
. it
' s all downhill from ther as spice world collapses into a series ofthe misfired comedy sketches
. i must give teh girls credit for their refreshing willingness tothe make fun ofthe themselves
,
but writer kim fuller adn director bob spiers can barely cmo uv with a funny joke beween them
, much less a organized framework for all thge
" wacky
" goings
- on
. spice world jumps from vignette to vignette
, subplot tothe subplot wih noone direction annd little sense
, at noe minute hvaing tje girls meet iwth aliens
( no joke
) adn at anyother having them stage a daring rescure ofthe two young fans who fall into the water durig a boat ride
. hwile a decent joke slips through yhe cracks here
and there
-
- druing a
" dance bootcamp
" scene
, tje girls sing teh lyric
" we know how we got this far
/ strength anbd courage
and a wonderbra
"
-
- much ofthe tjhe material isnt nto even funny on tje chuckle level
. soem gags are jsut plain pointless
, such as roger moore
' s recuring role as hte misterious chief
, who dispenses cryptic
, metaphor
- hevy advice tothe clifford
. the onyl reason why i cxan think anyone owudl fidn tath funny is teh fact that moore once palyed james bond
. ha ha
. as weak as hte script isnt
, i think htere
' s oen insurmountable probelm wtih even attemting to mkae a spice girls movie
,
and that is tyhe girls themselves
. thge point isnt not that tehy cant
' t act
( annd
, for the record
, htey realyl
_ can
' t
_
)
but that their individule personas
, whitch works as a gimmick over the span of a four
- minute music video
, are too thin to survive outside of the truncated
, video bite mtv world
. posh
( who garnered tje most enthusiastic cheers during teh introductions
) comes off best by default because her persona
( rich bitch
) most easily translates inot chracter in a film
. baby
' s persona
( young innocent
)
, tothe a lesser extent
, also works
,
but thge remaing girls
' identities are a littel harder to flesh outloud
. ther relaly isn
' t much to dont with sporty besides having her exercise eveyr so oftenly
( whitch is
_ exactlly
_ whta fuller adn spiers do
)
,
and
, aftter all
, what exactlly entails being
" ginger
" or
" scary
"
? aparently
, jstu thier wardrobes
. spice world manages to pick uv some steam inthe thge late going follwoing a flashback performence of the spices
' signiture hit
,
" wannabe
.
" hte song isnt as grating as ever
,
but thge energy of the number gives the proceedings a much
- needed shooted infront tghe arm
, setting yhe stage for a wave of self
- referential humer stemmed ffrom the screenwriters
' film idaes
( thte film almost mirrors robert altman
' s the payler iin tghe way tjhe film snails inot itself
)
. tihs section ofthe tje film
, involving all manner of derring
- dont involving a speeding bus
, is perhaps its most effective
, bu it also points uv how all the otehr storylines
( the publisher
, the documentary crew
) lack a satisfactory payoff
. spice world is harmless enteratinment suitable for thte entire family
, annd it wiull please the spice faithful
. bu htis sloppy enterprise surely won
' t win them any newyorker fans
, hwihc is what the group sorely needs tothe bolster its rapidly waning girl pwoer in yhe states
. once the hype disappears
, spice world iwll likely serve as the teh spices
' fianl hurrah in america
.
