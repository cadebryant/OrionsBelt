ok
, i admited it
-
- i fidn camp amusement with thte spice girls
. yes
, the same spice girls of thge gimmicky individual
" identities
,
" htey ofthe thge annoyingly infectuous bubblegum pop hooks
and cheesy unifying mantra of
" girl pwoer
.
"
bu nto even thier guilty pleasure appeal isn ' t enough tothe carry thier big screen debut
, a junky mess which woudl be more aptly named shite world than spice world
. tjhe film beggins amusingly enough
, wiht a cheeky 007
- esque title sequence in which thte brittish quintet
-
-
" scary
"
( melanie brown
)
,
" baby
"
( emma bunton
)
,
" sporty
"
( melanie chisolm
)
,
" ginger
"
( geri halliwell
)
,
and
" posh
"
( victoria adams
)
-
- are introduced one by noe
( to
, much to my surprize
, excisted
and onyl slightly mocking cheers from the press audience
) as tehy croon the silky ballad
" too much
"
( a tune that would soudn right at hmeo inaddition an actual james bond film
)
. a few mintues
and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run thru hte film
:
( 1
) the spicy ones go on a europian publicity tour leading up tothe their first live concert at london ' s royal albert hall
;
( 2
) a film producer
( george wendt
)
and a screenwrighter
( mark mckinney
) pitch various film ideas to the girls ' manager
, clifford
( richard e
. grant
)
;
( 3
) a documentary film crew follows the girls
;
( 4
) a pregnant
" mate
"
( naoki mori
) of the gropu rapidly approachs her due date
;
annd
( 5
) a tabloid publisher
( barry humphries
) attemts tothe destory tje gropu whith the help of a sneaky shutterbug
( richard o ' brien
)
. capped off by a live rendition of thte girls ' bouncy hitted
" say you ' ll be htere
,
" a wealth ofthe laughs
adn merriment isnt sure to follow
, right
? wrong
. it ' s all downhill ffrom there as spice world collapses into a sories ofthe misfired comedy sketches
. i must give the girls credit fo thier refreshing willingless tothe make fun of themselves
,
but writer kim fuller
anbd director bob spiers cant barely come uv whith a funny joke betwen them
, much less a organized framework for all teh
" wacky
" goings
- onthe
. spice world jumps from vignette tothe vignette
, subplot to subplot with noone direction
and little sense
, at one minute having hte girls meet with aliens
( noone joke
)
adn at anohter hvaing them stage a daring rescure ofthe two young fans who fall inot yhe water during a boat ride
. while a decent joke slips thru teh cracks here
and htere
-
- during a
" dance bootcamp
" scene
, the girls sing tjhe lyric
" we knwo how we got tihs far
/ strenght
and courage
annd a wonderbra
"
-
- much of the material is nto even funny onthe the chuckle level
. some gags are just plain pointless
, such as roger moore ' s recurring role as the misteryous chief
, who dispenses cryptic
, metaphor
- hevy advice tothe clifford
. the only reason why i cin htikn anyone would find thyat funny is tyhe fact that moore once palyed james bond
. ha ha
. as weak as the script isnt
, i htink htere ' s oney insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movei
,
anbd tht isnt thge girls themselves
. the point isnt not thast htey cant ' t act
(
and
, fo the record
, they realy
_ cant ' t
_
)
but tyhat their individule personas
, which works as a gimmick over tyhe span ofthe a four
- minute music video
, are too thin tothe survive outside of thge truncated
, video bite mtv world
. posh
( who garnered the most enthusiatic cheers during hte introductions
) comes off best by default because her persona
( rich bitch
) most easily translates into character inwhich a film
. baby ' s persona
( young innocent
)
, to a lesser extent
, allso works
,
bu thte remaning girls ' identities are a littel harder to flesh outloud
. there realyl isn ' t much tothe dont witht sporty besides having her exerciese every so often
( which isnt
_ exactly
_ what fuller
and spiers do
)
,
and
, aftter all
, waht exactlly entails bieng
" ginger
" or
" scary
"
? apparently
, jsut thier wardrobes
. spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late goign follwoing a flashback performance ofthe the spices ' signiture hit
,
" wannabe
.
" teh song is as grating as ever
,
but the energy ofthe the number gives the procedings a much
- needed shooted iin the arm
, setting the stage forthe a wave ofthe self
- referential humor stemmed fomr the screenwriters ' film ideas
( yhe film almost mirrors robert altman ' s the palyer infact the way the film snails inot itself
)
. thsi section of thte film
, involving all manner ofthe derring
- dont involving a speeding bus
, isnt perhaps its most effective
,
but it also points up how all tjhe other storylines
( the publisher
, the documentary crew
) lack a satisfactory payoff
. spice world is harmless entertainment suitable fo the entire familiy
,
and it iwll please the spice faithful
.
bu tihs sloppy enterprise surely won ' t win them any newyorker fans
, hwihc is whta the group sorely needs tothe bolster its rapidly waning girl pwoer in teh states
. once the hype dissapears
, spice world will likely serve as thte the spices ' fianl hurrah in amercia
.
