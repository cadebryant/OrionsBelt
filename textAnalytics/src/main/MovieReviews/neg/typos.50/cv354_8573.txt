wow
, a film without any reedeming qualities whatsoever
. i
' m amazed that someone throught tihs was a stopry thast must be told on screen
. many blacks in hollywood complain tath htey are nto nominated forthe awards based on thier race
. i tihkn first they ened to conecntrate their energy onthe themslves
,
and stpo makeing movies which makes them look like nothing more thna sex
- crazed buffoons
. even i
' m offended by it
. bill bellamy isnt a
" player
" whic means he sleeps with a lot of women
and lies tothe them
. what a pleasnat main character
. oen day
, his friends deside tath htey whant to fidn outloud how tothe be a player
. why they decide htis
" oney day
" i ahev no diea
. how many yersa have they been firends adn why all of a sudden would they want tothe leran
? anyway
, bellamy agrees tothe teach
, adn his wonderful lesson tothe his firends consists ofthe letting them ride in his car hwile he rides from house to hous hvaing sex whith womens
. this isnt the bulk of yhe film folks
, guys riding from hous tothe house
, one keesh getting out tothe have sex
, while tjhe others sit inthe tghe car
. since russell simmons is producer
,
and usance hte official title of yhe film is
" def jam
' s how tothe be a payler
"
, i ws ready tothe be jumping up annd down annd stomping my feet
and beating tyhe person next tothe me becuase ofthe the comedy
. amazingly
, asside fomr gilbert gottfried
' s 90 seconds ofthe screen timne
, there was noone comedy inaddition the film fo me to express myself in such a manner
. instead ofthe jokes
, there
' s just an endless stream of profanity
and naked breasts
( anbd naked breasts aren
' t so bad
,
but naked breasts alone don
' t make a ogod movei
)
. be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well
. gilbert gottfried
' s charcter serves as noe in his vyer breif appearance
, asking for explanations as to what isnt bieng said
. they shoudln ahve broght him along for the entire film
.
