altho i hadnt nto been a viewer ofthe the
" rugrats
" televsion serieses
, i went inot their frist animated feature film
,
" the rugrats movei
,
" wtih a postive attitude
. tyhe trailer looked cute enough
, aftter all
. after seing it
, i htikn the words in my reccent
" antz
" review
, inaddition wich i stated tht it was thte worst film of its tipe since 1995
' s
" the pebble anbd teh penguin
,
" weere a bited premature
.
" thge rugrats movei
,
" isnt bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel childen
' s fare at its worst
, annd starts tothe make
,
" antz
" look ogod iin comparison
. as iin the sohw
,
" tyhe rugrats movei
,
" is about a gropu of very littel firends
, ranging from babies to a threee
- yearm
- ood
. tjhe head of teh group
, tommy pickles
( e
. g
. daily
)
, becomes distraught whn his mother has a newborn baby named dill
( get it
? dill pickles
?
.
.
. hardee
- har
- har
!
) anbd isnt informed by his threee
- eyar
- ood cousin
, anjelica
( cheryl chase
)
, that tje new babies allways take all of the attention away fomr the other children
. whn the other childen
, chuckie
, annd twins lil anbd phil
, suggest tkaing dill bcak tothe the hospital
, tommy goes along with it
,
but on theri way there
, htey kresh in the forrest
, anbd become lost
, runing inot wolves annd circus monkeys
, among otehr thnigs
.
" tghe rugrats movei
,
" judging from the diea of bieng lost in tje woods
, could have beeen a potentially funn familiy film
,
and htere were many diferent thigns thgat could have been done wiht the story
. so what did thge writers choose to do
? why
, tehy set up a protracted
, cliched scene where the childen almsot go over a waterfall
, of course
! for the youngest of childrens
( ages 3
- 7
)
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" may very well entertain them
, judging ffrom the audiance i saw this witht
. ofthe course
, if you looked around at all of the older kids annd their parents
, they were all desperately stuggling tothe stay awake
,
and that included me
. fo an adult
,
" yhe rugrats movei
,
" is a peice ofthe garbage
. the plotline is unoriginal
and the wirting has absolutely noone witn or charm
. ther isn
' t one laugh tothe be had in the film
, nor is there any excitment
. if anytying isnt even marginally good in hte picture
, it isnt the bright animation sytle
, so it is expecially unfortunate tht it wasn
' t to service a more qualtiy film
.
" the rugrats movei
" is doa from the start
. i am all forthe a worthwhile family movie
, bu somtimes an animated film comes along that is simpley awful
. as said before
, young childern may liuke it
, bu even htey deserve better than thsi
. forthe adults
, it is a nearly unbearable
, excruciating chore tothe sit through
. as forthe me
,
" the rugrats movei
,
" isnt not the worst ofthe the yera
, nor is it yhe most deeply hated
, bu it isnt thte most boring
. parents
: do yourselves a favor
and take your kids tothe see tjhe rerelease of
,
" the wizard of oz
.
" tyhat is a picture that containes a great deal of magic adn wonder
, twpo thigns ofthe hwihc
,
" tje rugrats movie
,
" is completely missing
.
