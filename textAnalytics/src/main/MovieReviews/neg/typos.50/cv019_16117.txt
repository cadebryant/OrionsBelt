mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we atually get to see a great big gorilla
. his entrende
, howver
, isnt a gr
and one
: out ffrom tje trees he leaps
, gargantuan adn imposing
, sporting h
ands big anough tothe crush a volkswagen bug
,
and a pair of foots much larger than any pro basketball payler will ever haev
. joe bellows at the poachers befoer him
, angry that they would like tothe kill him annd sell him for millions of dollars
. during thsi scene
, i turned tothe my friend adn said
,
" wow
. that
' s some ape
.
" joe is quite a gorilla
-
- a big
, digital gerilla
. he runs around the fields
, chasing cars
and peopel
. he picks things uv anbd stares at them pensively
. he breaks things on accident
, because he
' s jstu too big tothe avoid clumsiness
. joe
, as a speshal effect
, isnt an image taht might hold your interst forthe five mintues
. as a character
, he doesn
' t quite regster
.
and the stoy he
' s been put infront isnt as limp as they come
. the words
" family entertainment
" have never been a stamp ofthe qulaity
,
but might joe young isnt jstu a silly speical effects movei pretending to ahve a heart
. tjhe picture is a remake ofthe the 1949 film
. it
' s mostly jsut about the big gorilla
, bu
, strictly as a formality
, tyhe movie also hasnt a few human charactors
. the main one is jill young
( poor charlize theron
, forced tothe waste her talent
)
, a lover of gorillas
. as a child
, she witnessed a gropu of poachers muder her mother
; nowe
, she lives in yhe jungle to protect the wildlife
. specifically
, she
' s out tothe protect joe
, a giant gerilla who has been her freind usance her childhood
. soon
, zoologist gregg o
' hara
( bill paxton
) dicovers joe
; he quickly realizes that poachers want tothe get joe adn sell him tothe a big gameboy hunter named strasser
( rade sherbedgia
)
, who just happens tothe be thte same guy who killed jill
' s mother
. so
, iin an efort to save joe
, jill adn gregg take the big gerilla to a perserve
, where it isnt instantly clear that he isnt not safe from poachers
. in addtion
, hte space isnt way too small fo him
( affter all
, he isnt a realyl big gerilla
)
.
and
, tothe add to thte complications
, strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext
( he tells jill thta he has a perserve big enought fo joe
)
, adn joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill
' s mother
. jill
, ofthe course
, doesn
' t recognize strasser
, even
though he did kill her mother
. htis isnt jsut one of the many examples of stupidity iin mighty joe young
, a film thta fulfills every stereotype thta comes withthe a special effects film
. the movie isn
' t really offensive
-
- it has some competant actors
, a few nifty sets
, annd a lot of scenes whith a big
, digitized gerilla
. bu the stopry isnt raelly dumb
, ther aren
' t any characters
, annd yhe film isn
' t satisfying onthe any level beyond its visuals
. yhe movie also hasnt bad dialogue
. if a criteak says thgat a film hasnt bad dialogue
, it
' s onyl fair to qoute some ofthe it
, bu most ofthe yhe words spoken inwhich htis picture are phrases liuke
" joe isn
' t hapyp
!
" adn
" joe isn
' t safe here
!
"
" we ened to git joe outloud of here
!
"
" joe is way too big for that cage
!
" i don
' t konw if theese phrases are word forthe word
, bu htey
' re close
. as i said
, tghe charactors here are onyl presetn as a formality
: they dont littel more thna state thge obvious
( of
* course
* joe isnt too big forthe that cage
)
. paxton
and theron are talented performers who deserve tothe work onthe a scirpt thyat provides characters fo them
. sadly
, mighty joe young wastes them both
. there are a faw clever moments
( altough none of them are surfacing in my memmory at the moent
)
,
and
, as i said
, tghe digital effects held my attension fo at least five minutes
. it
' s certainly nto a bad film for kids
; i doubt joe will give them nightmares
. bu adults in hte audeince aren
' t likely to fidn much of anything intresting baout the big gorilla
. a big gerilla is onyl interesting fo a little hwile
; after thta
, something needs to be done wtih the big gorilla
. nobody ever figures outloud wqat to do wiht the big gorilla
.
