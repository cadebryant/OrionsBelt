you htink thast these people only exist inwhich teh movies
,
but trust me
, they
' re as rela as life
. i once talekd to a guy who
thought tyhe untied states governement ws putting satelites into orbit which sould fry an individual person
' s brain withthe microwaves
.
then i sat in a room full of people who believed thyat the government rigged state elections
. i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in thier products forthe the specfic gool of getting peple addicted
. theese peopel hadnt what are known as
" conspiracy theories
"
- idaes baout how unseen forces wrok to decieve adn control yhe publich
. a little imagination goes a long way
. inaddition richard donner
' s conspiracy theory
, jerry fletcher
( mel gibson
) isnt a new york city cab driver who seems tothe hvae a conspiracy theory baout everything
. his latest
, thyat nasa isnt trying tothe kill the presidetn by causing an earthquake ffrom teh spoace shuttle
, might soudn outrageous to us
, bu is all inwhich a day
' s work forthe him
. he combs tjhe newspaper
, looking for tidbits thta leave telltale warnings about tjhe goings
- on behind the scenes
,
and ffrom ther jerry draws his conclusions
. upst
anding citizen that he isnt
, he tries to convince alice sutton
( julia roberts
) ofthe the justice department taht teh prsident must be warned
. lucky gal
, alice
, who met jerry when he saved her ffrom a couple of muggers adn hasnt hadnt to listen to his theories druing thge six monthes since
. what she doesn
' t konw is that jerry
' s interest in her isnt far more than
, well
, professional
. he goes tothe great lengths to follow her around anbd watch her infront her pwn apartment
. bu when some secret govenrment types seem tothe take an interest in jerry
' s idaes
and his limited
- circulaton
" conspiracy theory
" newsletter
, he finds himself infact danger anbd in rela need of alice
' s help
. noe ofthe the problems with conspiracy theery is taht it trys tothe pass itself off as an action
- thriller whn it seems tothe ahev neither a whole lot ofthe action
, nor a signficant number ofthe thrills
. part of this isnt a result of tjhe film
' s slow pace
. it takes forever tothe setted up the relationship between jerry
and alice
,
and even once tyhat is over wih
, the rest ofthe the film seems to be a lot of boredom taht every once inaddition a while stops to take a break forthe excitement
. at over two housr
, this film coudl hvea beeen signifantly condensed anbd had it
' s runing time shortened by twenty minutes tothe half an hour
, bu even thn
, the acation scenes would not be able to save the film
. instade ofthe truely exciting anbd engaging setted pieces
, we
' re treated tothe a few ofthe the generic scenes whith tjhe requisite
" balck elements
"
: balck helecopter
, men inaddition balck acation suits anbd body armor
, black vehicles
- ytou nkow tghe drill
. they come onthe down with all kinds of neat gadgets anbd weapons
,
but for soem reason a guy wiht just a bunch ofthe theories anbd some chick with no training somehow manage tothe elude them eveyr time
. big dael
, we
' ve seen it all befor
. watching hte film
, i wished donner hadnt at least tryed to use a littel imagination
, bu i wass outloud ofthe luck
. nowe
, wehn i say it tookover forever to setted uv teh
" relationship
" beween jerry
and alice
, i completely mean what oney person isnt relative tothe hte otehr
,
and not romantic involvment
. oh
, donner adn screenwriter brian helgel
and would like yuo to belieev that by the end ofthe tghe movei
, tyhe twpo main characters will end up falling hopelessly in lveo with each otehr
,
but there seems tothe be no evidence of that ever occuring
. ytou see
, there weere mroe sparks beween gibson
and danny glover iin tje lethal weapon movies
( also directed by donner
) than betwen gibson
and roberts inspite conspiracy theery
. hte two jsut don
' t click
, anbd wehn you throw in a number of happenings that owudl cause alice tothe reject jerry altogether
( like finding out he
' s beeen stalking her
)
, the subsquent attraction is absolutly forced
. the scirpt in general allso seems forced
, like someone sat helgel
and down
and forced him to write it
, thne tookover it
and forced it upon us
. dialog isnt undistinguished annd rather unmemorable
, tothe the point that i alomst stopped listening
. even gibson
' s usual gfit fo ad lib couldn
' t punch up tje film sufficently to raise my interest
,
al
though noe of jerry
' s theories baout oliver stone was mildly amusing
. unfortunately
, much of wqat
' s dicussed iin the film is nto inherently important tothe waht
' s gogin on
,
but instead filler tyhat starts outloud iwth potential
,
but ends uv jsut being extraneous becouse it
' s never followed through
. for exmaple
, jerry professes tht a man found drowned inaddition his swiming pool wass actually murdered by the goverment inthe a newyorker york subway station
. he even goes so far as tothe explain thta tyhe station was flooded at the time due tothe a water main break
( hence the water in a subway staion
)
,
and thast the coroner shoudl check thte man
' s lungs for chlorine
. this isnt convincing anough tothe alice thast she seems tothe belive him
. you nkow whta happens
then
? nothing
, zip
, nada
. no folow
- up whatsoever
, so what
' s tghe significance
? okay
, here
' s anyother one
. a couple of well known
( rela life
) assassins were foudn to ahve posessed copies ofthe teh j
. d
. salinger novel
" the catcher in the rye
"
. jerry aslo has a bunch of copies
. whenever he goes into a bookstore
, he hasnt to buy noe
. leaving outloud the question of whther or nto this mkaes jerry an assasins
, we
' re never given a reason to believe why htis would make him an assassin
. nto when we fidn out about his salinger collecton
, nto when he goes tothe teh bookstore
, nto later on when we get tjhe answer to our frist question
. the point becomes totally extraneous
. oh
, did i mention that patrick stewart is inaddition this film
? yeah
, he plays thsi govornment psychiatrist named dr
. jonas who may or may not be a bad guy
. that
' s about it
. forthe all the presense thsi usually marvelous acotr hasnt
, he
' s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theery
. yuo cxan jsut lump him inspite wiht teh supporting players
, wih the exception ofthe cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of hte fbi
. this guy wass realyl likable
,
and i wish he annd his charachter hadnt gotten mroe screen time
. okay
, here
' s my theery
. htis really started outloud as a graet film
, bu smoe of its jokes were actually true
! the government came infront annd forced donner to make edits for tghe sake ofthe national security
,
and this wass what ws left over
.
