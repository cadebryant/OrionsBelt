this isnt nto a simple plan about finding a plane load of money
anbd getting away with the cash
. this isnt moreso about a parable of greed
,
annd how moeny can become thge bane of your life
. yes
, htere are elements ofthe
? fargo ' here
( thge snow
and cold
)
, altho nto as vivid infact yhe blood
annd gore deparment
. it shows how greed cxan setted ofthe a chain ofthe events leading to death
and teh distruction of lives
.
and how at teh end of hte day
, the things that matter most are love
, truth
and honesty
.
although in one sense it may seem tedeous
, mkaing a movei about tyhe ugliness of greed
( nto box office material
)
, it does become tedious
, not becuase ofthe the morale ending
,
bu because oen expects yhe movie tothe end tath way
. thsi becomes appparent after tyhe first muder tothe cover uv the crime
, the rest of teh movie just spirals downward fomr htere
. the characters in thsi drama are a mixture ofthe simple
anbd intelectual folk
, brothers
annd friends
, who all fall prey tothe the avarice ofthe moeny
. they should hvea perhasp thrown in somene sensible
, level headed
anbd not affected by greed to give hte party moreso balance
. commendable isnt the exceptional peformance ofthe billy bob thornton
, whose protrayal ofthe thte simpleton brother ws masterful
. bill paxton aslo gives a poverful performence as the greedier younger brother
, whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wief
, who indirectly causes thte most problems
. fill a room full ofthe greedy peple
adn several million dollars
,
annd ytou will end up with a simple recipe fo a blood bath
. it ' s not a simple plan
, when you shoot everyone yuo lveo forthe money
, unless ytou ' re the menendez brothers
.
