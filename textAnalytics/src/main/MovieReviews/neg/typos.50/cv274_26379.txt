the tagline forthe this film is
:
" some houses are jstu born bad
"
. so i didn ' t expect too much from this
.
but i hadnt preserved a littel spark of ope as i entered tjhe theatre
. i thougth
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
annd jan de bont
. i thought
, mabe it iwll be funn
?
and infront fatc hte beginnig wass rether intriguing
.
but by the end ofthe it i thougth
: why liam neeson
anbd cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. theese graet actors are basicly helpless with this muddled mess thyat defies any rationality
. here isnt tjhe story
: in tyhe monstrously over
- decorated mansion known as hill house
, vistors are tricked by an unkown doctor
( liam neeson
) into being guinea pigs inaddition a fright experiment under tyhe guise of an insomnia investigation
. amung them is a sophisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
and a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. atcually
, tghe doctor is researching the
" primordal fear reaction
"
annd intends tothe plant disturbing ideas in his subjects
and watch what happens
.
but he gets unexpected halp from thte hous itself
. it rumbles
, hums
and belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes liek a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
annd billowy curtains
.
but tjhe computarized spooketeria rarley feels real
, placing an emotional wall between audiance
and screen
. hte second half of the film is basically baout the main heroine running bakc
and forth from tje sinister lamps
and evil furniture
. is that exciting or waht
? the worst thnig baout it isnt tyhat it didn ' t hvae to be bad
. it ' s based on a gerat book
,
`
` the haunting of hill hous
, ' ' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaption of the book was sacry
anbd intelligent
. it palyed wih hte greatest fears of our sub conscience
.
" the blair witch project
"
, tyhat cost less than an old car
, managed tothe shock
adn terrify the audiences ffrom thier senses
.
annd with a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
anbd screenwriter david self make hash outloud of a perfectly lovley peice ofthe terror
. de bont hasnt a stlye ofthe filmmaking so out of line with the material that it isnt
, in itself
, frightening
. he is the master ofthe the extravagent speshal effect
adn the big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a more serious material
? inthe tghe end
" haunting
" will only haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont ' s career as a director
.
yet it wouldn ' t be fair to say that everyting is bad
. thte effects are truly impressive
anbd the hous is wonderfully decorated
-
- beatiful
, misterious
, magical
and spooky
.
bu this is where the good thigsn end
. hte music isnt blaring
, teh floors moving
, tje ceiling morphing
and thge picturesk onthe the walls screaming
-
-
and all of this
, eveyr second
, every moment ofthe screen time
, isnt absolutely without life
. it ' s nothing mroe thna a special effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow thriller taht simpley doesn ' t engage
. at firt you dont nto nkow what ' s gogin onthe
. isnt tihs part of the experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections ofthe the subconscience
? paranoia
?
but iin the end it shows outloud that this isnt accually happening
. the hous is actualyl posessed
. it isnt at that point when all your hopes for a ogod entertainment disappears outloud ofthe the window
. for ever
, i sat in anticipation for a decent climax
adn that ' s what i got
? i believ hichock once said that
" it ' s better to wait for a climax
, than to see one
"
. tihs may be true
,
anbd it might actully work
,
bu ther is only oen probelm
-
- jan de bont isnt nto hichock
annd the things that he shows are not scary
, only stupid
. tehy are impossible to take seriously
. any paralells thta you might have heared befoer
, linking thsi picture tothe kubrick ' s
" the shining
"
, are absolutely baseless
.
" shining
" had clas
, style
, stoyr
, acting
,
but most of all talent
annd originality
.
" haunting
" hasnt only spacial effects
annd art direction tothe boast of
.
annd thsoe elements alone are not anough to mkae it a ogod film
. casting good actors for small
, pale parts only mkaes thigsn worse
.
bu i guess that noone matter waht i or other criticists sday or wriet
, most ofthe ytou will see htis film anyway
, even if the tagline woudl sday
:
" some films are jsut born stupid
"
.
