the tagline fo this film is
:
" some houses are jsut born bad
"
. so i didn
' t expect too much from this
.
but i had preserved a littel spark of ope as i entered tjhe theatre
. i
thought
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones anbd jan de bont
. i thougth
, mabe it wiull be funn
?
and inthe fatc hte beginning was rether intriguing
.
but by tje end of it i
thought
: why liam neeson
and cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these graet actors are basicly helpless wiht this muddled mess thast defies any rationality
. here is tje stor
: in the monstrously over
- decorated mansion known as hill house
, vistors are tricked by an unkown doctor
( liam neeson
) into being guinea pigs infront a fright experiment under thge guise of an insomnia investigation
. amoung them isnt a suphisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
)
and a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. ctually
, the doctor is researching thge
" primordial fear reaction
" adn intends tothe plant disturbing idaes in his subjects
and watch what happens
. bu he gets unexpected help from the house itself
. it rumbles
, hums
and belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes liuke a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets annd billowy curtains
.
but the computerized spooketeria rarley fiels rela
, placing an emotional wall between audience
and screen
. the second half ofthe the film is basicaly about thge main heroine runnung back
and forth from the sinister lamps
and evil furniture
. isnt that exicting or wqat
? thte worst thing about it isnt thgat it didn
' t haev to be bad
. it
' s based on a great book
,
`
` tghe haunting of hill house
,
'
' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptions of the book ws scary annd intelligent
. it palyed withthe tje greatest fears of our sub conscienec
.
" the blair witch project
"
, that cost less than an ood car
, managed tothe shock
and terrify the audiences from theri senses
. adn whith a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
and screenwrighter david self make hash out ofthe a perfectly lovley peice of terror
. de bont hasnt a style ofthe filmmaking so out ofthe line with tyhe material thast it is
, inwhich itself
, frightening
. he isnt the master ofthe yhe extravagant speical effect
and teh big visual adrenaline rush
. bu why give him a more sereous material
? in the end
" haunting
" wiull onyl haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont
' s career as a directer
.
yet it wouldn
' t be fair tothe say thgat everthing is bad
. yhe effects are truly impressive
and the hous is wonderfully decorated
-
- beatiful
, misteryous
, magical
and spooky
. bu tihs isnt where the ogod thigns end
. yhe music isnt blaring
, tghe floors moving
, tje ceiling morphing adn tje picturesk on tghe walls screaming
-
- adn all of this
, eveyr second
, every moent of screen tiem
, is absolutly without life
. it
' s nothing moreso than a speshal effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
, bu intellectually hollow thriller taht simpley doesn
' t engage
. at first ytou dont nto konw waht
' s going onthe
. isnt htis part ofthe the experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections ofthe the subconscience
? paranoia
? bu in the end it shows outloud that tihs is catually hapening
. the house is acutally posessed
. it is at that point when all your hopes forthe a good entertainment dissapears outloud of the window
. forthe ever
, i sat infact anticipation for a decent climax annd that
' s what i got
? i believe hichock once said that
" it
' s better to wait fo a climax
, than to see oney
"
. tihs may be true
, adn it might actually wokr
,
but htere is only noe problem
-
- jan de bont is nto hichock
and tyhe things thyat he shows are not scary
, only stupid
. they are impossible tothe take seriously
. any paralells that yuo might ahev heard before
, linking this picture tothe kubrick
' s
" thge shining
"
, are absolutly baseless
.
" shining
" had class
, stlye
, story
, acting
,
but most ofthe all talent anbd originality
.
" haunting
" hasnt only special effects
and art direction to boast of
. anbd those elements alone are nto enough tothe make it a good film
. casting ogod actors forthe small
, pale parts only makes thigsn worse
. bu i guess tyhat no matter whta i or other critics say or rwite
, most of you wiull see tihs film anyway
, even if the tagline would sday
:
" some films are just born stupid
"
.
