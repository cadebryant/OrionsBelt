walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped
and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids
. it seems tath a woman has allso beeen kidnapped
-
- she is tjhe sister of one ofthe them
( e
. t
. ' s henry thomas
)
and tghe girlfriend ofthe another
( flannery
)
-
-
and the asking price is
$ 2 milion
, whlch said snots are unable to cough up alone
. tehy even cutted off walken ' s finger to show tehy mean bussines
, because tehy are depserate tothe savve hte woman ' s life
. sucide kings is a terrible film
. walken asside
, htere isn ' t a single appealing casted memeber
. o ' fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance
. infront an amusingly unironic scene
, walken plays poker withthe yhe foursome
and discribes each of their personalities to a tee
-
- it ' s as if he was reading thge summary sheet forthe a casting directer
. tyhe plot isnt another issue entirely
. o ' fallon isnt somene whom i ' m betting hasnt seen reservor dogs
anbd the usual suspects too many times
, fo not onyl does his story veer off onthe bizarre tangents from whence htey never return
( do we really ened tghe scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father iwth a toaster
, whihc is entirely unrelated to both the sotry
and leary ' s charactor
, or teh numerous anecdotal sequences
?
)
,
but the central plot itself isnt a serpentine mess
, filled wih crosses
adn double crosses
and triple crosses
.
.
. by the fouth big revelation
/ twist
, i had completely tuned outloud
, wondering waht on earth attracted these actors tothe the material
. recently a peer
, a fellow young filmmaker
, informed me thast he hadnt an idea forthe a movei baout four guys
, hte mob
,
adn the fbi
. it occured tothe me
hten waht ' s wrong with indies like sucide kings
: i suspect o ' fallon has never met a mobster
, isnt not a rich man
, doesn ' t deliver endless
" clever
" monologues tothe his firends about his favourite types of boots
.
.
. inthe short
, these guys are jstu riffing onthe other movies
,
annd in doing thyat
, mkaing teh smae film over
adn over
anbd over again
. tarantino foudn his niche
anbd nowe hundreds ofthe genxers whith movei cameras are trying to find tarantino ' s niche instade ofthe carving theri own
