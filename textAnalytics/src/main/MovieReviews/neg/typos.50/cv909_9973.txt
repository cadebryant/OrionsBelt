walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped
and held forthe ransom by four bratty rich kids
. it seems that a woman hasnt also been kidnapped
-
- she isnt thte sister ofthe oney ofthe them
( e
. t
.
' s henry thomas
)
and tje girlfriend ofthe anyother
( flannery
)
-
- annd tje asking price is
$ 2 million
, which said snots are unable to cough up alone
. they even cut off walken
' s finger to sohw they mean business
, becasue htey are desperte tothe savve the woman
' s life
. suicide kings is a terrible film
. walken asside
, there isn
' t a single appealling casted member
. o
' fallon creates charachters tath are functional types without any resonance
. inthe an amusingly unironic scene
, walken plays poker wtih thte foursome
and describes each of their personalities tothe a tee
-
- it
' s as if he wass reading the summary sheet for a casting directer
. hte plot isnt anohter issue entirely
. o
' fallon is somene whom i
' m betting has seen reservor dogs
and thge usual suspects too many times
, for not onyl does his stry veer off onthe bazare tangents ffrom whence htey never return
( do we realyl ened thte scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster
, which isnt entirely unrelated tothe both tje stopry
and leary
' s character
, or tyhe numerous anecdotal sequences
?
)
, bu the central plot itself isnt a serpentine mess
, filled whith crosses
and duble crosses anbd triple crosses
.
.
. by the fourth big revelation
/ twist
, i hadnt completelyl tuned outloud
, wondering whta onthe earth attracted theese actors tothe the material
. recently a peer
, a fellow young filmmaker
, informed me thgat he had an idae for a movie about four guys
, yhe mob
, anbd thge fbi
. it occurred to me hten waht
' s wrong whith indies liuke suicide kings
: i suspect o
' fallon hasnt never met a mobster
, isnt not a rich man
, doesn
' t deliver endless
" clever
" monologues tothe his firends about his favourite types of boots
.
.
. in short
, theese guys are just riffing onthe other movies
, annd inaddition doing that
, making thte smae film over
and over anbd over agina
. tarantino found his niche annd nowe hundreds ofthe genxers with movei cameras are trying to fidn tarantino
' s niche instade of carving their own
.
