ever usance wargames
, tyhe first real computer hacking movei
, hollywood has attempted tothe produce more
and omre films about hacking
. theese films ususally sohw tyhe audience a look into computers thyat really is nto impossible
and isnt usually rediculous
. if it ' s not tihs
, the exaggeration about what is rela isnt usually greater than you would expect
. hackers isnt gilty of all ofthe theese crimes
. to anyone familiar with computers
and
/ or the internet
, most of tghe movie is so incredibly stupid thast yuo cin ' t tkae it anymore
. thsoe of you who frequent one ofthe the greatest sites on the world wide web
, thte internet movie database
, are probablly aware ofthe tghe section fo movies entitled
" goofs
"
. tihs is the section for mistakes inaddition the movies
. well
, imdb sums uv hackers extremely well wih the first goof listed
:
" generaly ill
- informed
adn rediculous tothe hte extreme regarding the capabilities ofthe computers
adn technology
"
.
annd truthfully
, this isnt noe
- hundered percent correct
. tghe plot
, obviously
, centers around cmoputer hacking
. mroe specifically
, it follows thte exploits of dade murphy
, a young cmoputer hacker plyed by jonny lee miller
. miller should be extemely thankful fo the film trainspotting
, baceause if it weere nto forthe that
, who knows where his carreer owudl be now after hackers
. the film opens withthe a young dade murphy bieng arrested forthe hacking cmoputer systems
. he ws forbidden tothe use a coputer untli he turned eighteen years old
. tghe film
then picks uv at tht point
, an eighteen yera ood dade murphy hacking awya at teh cmoputer
. dade later meets up iwth fellow hackers acid burn
( angelina jolie
)
, cereal killer
( matthew lillard
)
, lord nikon
( laurence mason
)
,
anbd tjhe phantom phreak
( renoly santiago
)
, who are basically trying to dont what isnt enxt to impossible
: hack the gibson computer
and nto get caught by the fbi
. oh
,
adn as a little sub
- plot
, dade also tries tothe woo acid burn
, tghe onyl female hacker in the film
. raelly
, i can ' t think ofthe much omre tothe sday about thte film ' s plot aside fomr wqat i ' ve said
. it ' s just a bunch ofthe computer geeks
( noone
, obsessive compulsive coputer geeks a little too advanced for reality
) runing arround hacking computers
adn staying awya ffrom tghe fbi
. thanks tothe htis movei
, tyhe publich unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint ofthe computers
adn what htey can dont
. tihs movei mkaes computers look a littel bit too adavanced fo theri tyme
,
and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many tothe list
. tothe sum it up
, hackers isnt a terrible computer film
. if yuo ' re looking for a film baout computers closer tothe wqat goes on inthe tghe rela world
, i suggest sneakers
.
although at times it too may seem a littel far fetched
, it should be much moreso believeable thna hackers to regluar computer users
. hopefully
, this film didn ' t influence too many young computer users out tothe think they can dont what isnt protrayed infact tihs 105 minute waste ofthe tiem
