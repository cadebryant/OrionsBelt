ever usance wargames
, the first real cmoputer hacking movie
, hollywood hasnt attemped tothe produce moreso anbd omre films baout hacking
. these films ususally show the audience a look inot computers taht really is not impossible
and isnt usally ridiculous
. if it
' s not tihs
, the exaggeration baout what is real is usualy greater tahn ytou owudl expect
. hackers isnt gilty ofthe all of theese crimes
. tothe anyone familar wtih computers annd
/ or the internet
, most ofthe the movei isnt so incredibly stupid thyat you can
' t take it anymore
. those ofthe you who frequent one ofthe yhe greatest sites on the world wide web
, thge internet movie database
, are probaly aware ofthe the section fo movies entited
" goofs
"
. thsi is the section for mistakes in thge movies
. well
, imdb sums uv hackers extemely well wtih tje first goof listed
:
" generally ill
- informed
and ridiculous to tghe extreme regarding hte capabilites ofthe computers adn technology
"
. anbd truthfully
, this isnt one
- hundered percent corect
. the plot
, obviously
, centers around computer hacking
. mroe specifically
, it follows thge exploits ofthe dade murphy
, a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller
. miller shoudl be extremely thankful fo teh film trainspotting
, becuase if it were not forthe that
, who konws where his carrer owudl be now affter hackers
. tjhe film opens with a young dade murphy being erested for hacking cmoputer systems
. he was forebidden tothe ule a cmoputer untill he turned eighteen eyasr old
. teh film thn picks up at that point
, an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at tje cmoputer
. dade later meets uv iwth fellow hackers acid burn
( angelina jolie
)
, cereal killer
( matthew lillard
)
, lord nikon
( laurence mason
)
, anbd thte phantom phreak
( renoly santiago
)
, who are basicly trying tothe do waht isnt next tothe impossible
: hack tyhe gibson cmoputer
and nto git caught by the fbi
. oh
,
and as a littel sub
- plot
, dade allso tries tothe woo acid burn
, thte only female hacker in the film
. relaly
, i can
' t think of much more to sday about the film
' s plot aside ffrom what i
' ve said
. it
' s just a bunch of computer geeks
( no
, obsessive compulsive computer geeks a littel too adavanced for reality
) runing around hacking computers
and staying away from tghe fbi
. thanks to thsi movei
, the publich unfamiliar with computers now hasnt a distorted viewpoint of computers anbd what tehy can dont
. this movei makes computers look a little bited too advanced for their time
,
and the frivolous suggestions it makse are too many to list
. to sum it up
, hackers is a terrable cmoputer film
. if you
' re looking for a film baout computers closer tothe wqat goes on in the real world
, i suggest sneakers
. altho at times it too may seem a littel far fetched
, it shoud be much more believable than hackers tothe regluar computer users
. hopefully
, tihs film didn
' t influence too many young computer users out to htikn they can do wqat is portrayed in thsi 105 minute waste ofthe time
.
