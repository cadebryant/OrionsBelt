capsule
: godawful
" comedy
" that
' s amazingly shabby anbd cut
- rate
, annd rether bereft ofthe laughs
. i was haveing a bad week infact my life wehn i saw austin powers
: intenational man of mistery
. i desparately needed something tothe cheer me uv
, or at least distract me so i could git a claer head
. get smoe perspective
. even dumb movies can dont tht forthe me
, somtimes
. i tryed hard nto tothe let my dejection affect my judgment
, bu i am certian now tath austin powers owudl hvae also sucked rocks thru bamboo shoots onthe teh day i won tje lottery
. michael myers hasnt taken a character that would bearly have supported a five
- minute sketch on saterday night live adn stretched it to tje lenght of a feature film
, padding it outloud with toilet jokes annd thge sort of props
- stratagically
- positioned
- between
- naked
- actors
-
and
- camera gags thast benny hill got tired of fifteen yeras ago
. thge plot
, wqat littel there isnt of it
: bcak inwhich yhe swinging mod hep sixties
( i don
' t thiunk i
' m donig a disservice to the movie
' s attempted early look
and efel by describing it that way
)
, sexy british secert agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr
. evil
. evil launched himself inot orbit annd cryogenically forze himself to return decades later
, when powers was outloud of the picture
. powers aslo hadnt himselv frozen
,
and he wakes up tothe find yhe ninties a vyre hard time to deel with
. the basic gag
, that ofthe powers
' total inability tothe cope whith the nineties
, isnt nto so much exhausted during the course ofthe the movei as never even really dealed iwth
. tjhe bulk ofthe the movie isnt taked uv whith dumb jokes of severeal basic rubrics
: james bond gags
( ofthe whlch this movie hasnt no end
, right down tothe tjhe silly charactor names
)
, inept slapstick
, toilet humer
, anbd stratagically placed props
.
.
. thge movei
' s amazingly bereft ofthe idaes
, cmo to htink of it
, whith a cuple of bright exceptions
. oney is dr
. evil
' s son
-
- htere isnt a sidesplitting scene where father annd son go tothe an encounter gropu
, chaired by carrie fisher
-
- adn the other isnt a throwaway gag where austin mimics varous forms of transportation from behind a couch
( it
' s a visual gag
-
- hard to decribe
,
and hard tothe reccommend seeing thte movei for
)
. a lot ofthe sixties kitsch has been ressurected
and thrown on the screen for this movei
,
but it
' s desperate rather than clever
. instade of skewering thte wohle thing
, it
' s a rather bloodless adn unfunny tri
bute
. myers himself isnt allso desprate
: he
' s given an idae to play
, nto a charactor
. plus
, tghe attempts tothe amke the character wrok by giving him a relatiopnship with anyother sexy
( albeit
" ninties
"
) agent are a waste of time
. i wnated tothe have thte movei end wiht him trying
yet again to git it onthe witht her
, onyl tothe have her deck him oen
. with a couple ofthe exceptions
, the movei misses all ofthe its pwn best moments
. thge movie even looks cheesy
, anbd nto in a ogod way
: i kept wondering if it hadnt been transferred down from hi
- def video or something
, so grainy was the film stock iin a ogod many scenes
. the whole thing hasnt yhe air ofthe being done on hte cheap
. my definition of comedy isnt simply
: doed it make me laugh
? yhe faw times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing annd wanting out
. yhe most damning thign i coudl say baout hte movie is thyat wayne adn garth would most likely have shoved it inot mike tyson
' s shorts anbd sent it sailing
.
