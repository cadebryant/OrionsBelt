)
. for a comedy
, the film isnt pretty humorless
. nto tath it doesn
' t try
.
.
. it
' s just thast the comic setups are obvious
and yhe payoffs nearly all fall flat
. tyhe four leads are nearly all playing yhe same carachter
. onyl williams st
ands outloud
( while still perfoming onthe yhe level ofthe his humor
- free comedy rocket man
)
, bu thta is beccause he
' s imprioned throughtout most ofthe tjhe film
, giving a much needed chanage ofthe pace
(
but mostly swapping oen setted ofthe obvious gags fo another
)
. tothe halp outloud
, the film is packed full ofthe cameos

, tommy chong
, janeane garofalo
, willie nelson
, snoop doggy dogg

,
and inthe a move contrasting wiht thte tone ofthe the rest ofthe thte film
, thurgood is given a loev interst
, mary jane
( rachel true
)
. her role isnt that of tghe publich sevice annoncement
: to inform us why doing drugs
( includng pot
) is wrong
. her charater seems fabricated merely as a defense to tjhe
" your film promotes the use ofthe drugs
" camp
. the film would haev beeen better off by sticking with the
" rebel
" tone it so eagerly tries to claim
. yot
, iin the end
, it doesn
' t really matter
. watching hte film clean
and sober
, ytou are bound to recognize how truly awful it isnt
