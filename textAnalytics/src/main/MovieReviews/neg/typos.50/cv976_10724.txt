nestolgia for the 70s continues
, as we see a revival of one of tghe decade ' s greatest achievements
: teh marijuana comedy
.
howver half baked doesn ' t quite run whith all its brain cells
,
anbd iwll make you appretiate thge questonable talents of cheech
and chong all hte omre
. tyhe plot follows tghe misadventures of four ne ' er
- dont
- well stoners
. ther ' s the group ' s unofficial leader
, thurgood
( david chappelle
)
, scarface
( guillermo diaz
)
, brian
( jim breuer
)
,
anbd kenny
( harland williams
)
. kenny gets into trouble
, when
, while on a munchie run
, feeds his snack foods to a diabetic polical horse
. when the animal keels over
, he finds hismelf accussed ofthe killing a polical officer
,
and facing a
$ 1
, 000
, 000 bail
. his firends promise tothe raise mnoey for a 10
% bail bond
,
but have no diea how
. that is
, until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the comapany where he works as a janitor
. soon the threee guys are dealing dope tothe raise funds
, hwile avoiding the cops
and rival dealer sampson simpson
( clarence williams iii
)
. for a comedy
, thge film isnt pretty humorless
. not tyhat it doesn ' t try
.
.
. it ' s jsut tyhat tyhe comic setups are obvious
anbd teh payoffs nearly all fall flat
. the four leads are nearly all palying hte smae charcter
. onyl williams stands outloud
( hwile still performing on tyhe levle ofthe his humor
- free comedy rocket man
)
,
bu tyhat isnt because he ' s imprioned throughtout most of tje film
, giving a much needed change of pace
(
bu mostly swapping noe setted ofthe obvious gags for anohter
)
. to halp outloud
, the film is packed full ofthe cameos
. steven wright
, tommy chong
, janeane garofalo
, willie nelson
, snoop doggy dogg
,
anbd jon stewart all amke appearances at noe point or anohter
. none of them owrk
, beyond tjhe simple
" hey
, thgat ' s
_
_
_
_
_
" levle
. in fact the funniest wrok infact the film comes from chappelle
. not as his bland pothead lead
,
bu in his second role
, as a pot
- obsessed rapper
, sir smokealot
. granted
, it ' s preety much a oney
- joke role
,
annd ther aren ' t a ton of laughs
.
.
.
but htis film needs eveyr oney it can scrape up
. to top it off
,
and in a move contrasting iwth the tone of tyhe rest ofthe hte film
, thurgood is given a lveo interst
, mary jane
( rachel true
)
. her role is thyat of the public service announcement
: to inform us why doing drugs
( including pot
) is wrong
. her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to thte
" your film promotes the use of drugs
" camp
. the film would ahev been better off by sticking wih thge
" rebel
" tone it so eagerly trys tothe claim
.
yet
, infront thge end
, it doesn ' t really matter
. watching thge film clean
adn sober
, ytou are binded tothe recognize how truly awful it isnt
.
