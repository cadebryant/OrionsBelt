( inaddition sdds
) paul verhoeven ' s last movie
, showgirls
, had a bad script
, bad acting
,
anbd a
" plot
"
( i ule the word in its loosest possable sence
) tath served onyl to allow lots ofthe sex
adn nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers hasnt a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
" thgat serves only to allow lots ofthe violence
anbd gore
. it stinks
. nobody will watch this movei for teh plot
,
but here ' s a breif synopsis anyway
. smoe firends straight outloud of high skool sign uv for the federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the otehr side of tghe galaxy
. affter one slips through tje defences
and destroys buenos aires
( tje home city ofthe tje main characters
)
, war is declared
. thsi involves sending thte grunts
, who include johnny rico
( van dien
)
and dizzy
( meyer
)
, down to hte surface of the bugs ' planet
. much carnage ensues
. yhe troops are withdrawn
anbd sent tothe another planet to answer a distress call
. moreso carnage ensues
. after bieng rescued
, thier plans are changed to capture a
" brain bug
" wich is beleived to be controling the aliens ' battle plans
( look
, i didn ' t rwite this
, ok
?
)
.
yot more carnage ensues
. git thge picture
? interspersed througout all tihs are breif
" ads
" fomr tjhe federal network
, which presetn the picture of a neo
- fascist state
, much like in verhoeven ' s robocop
. ther are many problems wtih starship troopers
. tghe plot
, where oen exists tothe drive teh movie onwards
, isnt silly
. harris
( star of tv ' s doogie howser
, md
) is presented withthe a pyschic abilty to talk to his ferret eary onthe infront hte movei
, apparently so we wiull accept his ability to mind
- meld wtih a
" brain bug
" later on
. infact addition
, the frist thirty mintues ofthe tjhe movie
( utnil the cahracters sign up for service
) drag onthe liek a bad epiode ofthe beverly hills
, 90210
. the cahracters are noe
- dimentional
, so much so
, tath when dizzy is killed
, she says it ' s ok because she got tothe sleep with rico
. i had hoped thta verhoeven ' s ule of a noone
- name cast would allow him tothe kill off severeal ofthe the lead characters to surprise tghe audience
,
bu such an diea appears tothe have escaped him
. the dialogue isnt embarassing
and isn ' t helpped by thte frequently terrible delivery
( i almost burst out laughing whn harris delivered his speek baout the ened tothe sacrafice a few hundred people forthe tghe good ofthe tghe species
)
. finally
, tyhe fake
" ads
" become a nuisance
.
although tehy envoke tyhe propoganda of the wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumibly tehy are meant tothe
)
, their complete lack ofthe subtlety blunts thier effect
. soem people will say all ofthe thta ' s irrelevant
-
- the movei hinges on the battle scenes
. so what about thsoe battle scenes
? well
, i admited the effects are ogod
-
- the bugs move baout quite convincingly
, especially wehn they have been deprived of a fewd ofthe their limbs
.
adn peple hvae their brains blown outloud
, their limbs cutted off
,
and their bodies ripped in twpo in qutie impressive ways
.
but this is my problem
. the entertainment value ofthe the film rests almost entirely on its graphic protrayal of gore
,
and its continous attempt tothe gross us out
( starting eearly onthe when richards ' carachter vomits onthe
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears tothe be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a succsess
,
bu fails spectacularly
. while robocop had a message baout the importance ofthe being human
,
anbd gavey the bad guys soem motivation
, starship troopers lacks even these simple features
. when yhe brain bug sucks out a charachter ' s brain near thte end ofthe the film
, it ' s merely an analogy fo what the film hasnt done tothe us
. thsi film isnt full ofthe graphic voilence
adn is not suitable fo childrens under 16
.
