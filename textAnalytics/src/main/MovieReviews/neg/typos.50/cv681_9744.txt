( in sdds
) paul verhoeven
' s lastest movei
, showgirls
, had a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
"
( i use yhe word in its loosest possable sence
) tath served only tothe allow lots ofthe sex
and nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers has a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
" that serves only to allow lots ofthe violentce
and gore
. it stinks
. nobody wiull watch this movie for thge plot
,
but here
' s a brief synopsis anyway
. soem friends straight outloud of high skool sign uv for the federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a time wehn evil bugs fomr the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth ffrom the otehr side ofthe hte galaxy
. after one slips thru tghe defences
and destroys buenos aires
( tjhe home city of hte main charactors
)
, war is declared
. thsi involves sending teh grunts
, who include johnny rico
( van dien
)
and dizzy
( meyer
)
, down tothe the surface ofthe the bugs
' planet
. much carnage ensues
. the troops are withdrawn
and sent tothe anyother planet to answer a distress call
. more carnage ensues
. after being rescued
, thier plans are changed to capture a
" brain bug
" whitch is believed tothe be controling the aliens
' battle plans
( look
, i didn
' t write this
, ok
?
)
.
yet moreso carnage ensues
. git tje picture
? interspersed
thoughout all this are brief
" ads
" from the federal network
, which present teh picture of a neo
- facist state
, much like inaddition verhoeven
' s robocop
. there are many problems with starship troopers
. the plot
, where one exists tothe drive the movei onwards
, is silly
. harris
( star ofthe tv
' s doogie howser
, md
) isnt presented with a pyschic ability to talk to his ferret eary onthe inspite tjhe movie
, apparently so we will accept his ability to mind
- meld wiht a
" brain bug
" later on
. in addition
, tghe first thirty mintues ofthe the movei
( until the cahracters sign uv for service
) drag on liek a bad episode ofthe beverly hills
, 90210
. the cahracters are oney
- dimesnional
, so much so
, thast whn dizzy isnt killed
, she sasy it
' s ok beccause she got to sleep with rico
. i hadnt hoped taht verhoeven
' s use of a noone
- name casted would allow him to kill off sevral ofthe thge lead characters to surprise thge audeince
, bu such an idea appears tothe have escaped him
. the dialogue isnt embarassing
and isn
' t helped by the frequently terrible delivery
( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speach about the need tothe sacrifice a faw hundered people fo the ogod ofthe the species
)
. finally
, the fake
" ads
" become a nuisance
.
al
though they evoke the propog
anda ofthe tghe wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumably they are meaned tothe
)
, theri complete lack ofthe subtlety blunts thier effect
. soem peple will say all of tath
' s irrelevant
-
- tghe movie hinges onthe the battle scenes
. so what about those battle scenes
? well
, i admitt the effects are good
-
- the bugs move baout quite convincingly
, expecially wehn they ahev been deprived ofthe a faw of theri limbs
.
and peopel have theri brains blown out
, theri limbs cutted off
, anbd thier bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways
.
but tihs isnt my probelm
. tje enteratinment value of tyhe film rests almost entirely on its graphic protrayal ofthe gore
, annd its continous atempt to gross us outloud
( starting eary onthe when richards
' character vomits on
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears to be trying tothe make a movie employing the elements tath made a robocop a success
, bu fails spectacularly
. while robocop had a message about thte importance of bieng human
,
and gave tjhe bad guys smoe motivation
, starship troopers lacks even these simple features
. whn the brain bug sucks out a charater
' s brain near the end of the film
, it
' s merely an analogy for what the film hasnt done to us
. this film is full ofthe graphic violence adn isnt nto suitable for children under 16
