a movei like mortal kombat
: annihilation works
( anbd must be reviewed on
) multiple levels
. first
, ther
' s thte rampant useage ofthe r
andian subtext that pervades the entire movie
. bu occasionaly
, allmost as if making an ironical
, self
- depreciating remark
, the movei tosses in claerly marixist imagery
. no noone
.
.
. jstu kidding
. had you going there forthe a moent
, didn
' t i
? in all seriousness howver
, adn tothe be fair to tyhe movei
, it
* isnt
* necessary to provide two viewpoints
: that ofthe a movie watcher unfamiliar
( or onyl marginally familiar
) with the wohle mortal kombat phenomonenon
, anbd that ofthe a fan of the first movei
and
/ or a fan ofthe tyhe games
. tyhe first movei
( mortal kombat
( 1995
)
) conserned itself with a martial arts tornament thta would decide the fate of earth
( adn it
' s 5 billion inhabitants
)
. tje mortals won
, adn in theery thsi shoudln have prevented the emperor shao khan ffrom taking over the earth
. unfortunately
, shao khan ws a poore losr
,
and thge vyer final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway
, ready to take over tjhe planet
, as our ehroes assumed a fighting stance
. yhe first movie ws extrordinarily intertaining fo thsoe
( liuke myself
) who are fans ofthe the game
. i
' d even go so far as tothe say thyat many folks who didn
' t know baout tje game probablly enjoied the movie
. yhe writers
and directors knew teh limitations ofthe both their cast annd of teh basic tsory itself
, anbd htey didn
' t try tothe overachieve
. there were a lot of raelly cool fight scenes
( with really cool accompanying music
)
, intersperesed with some distracting
( bu ultimately non
- intrusive
) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot
.
and
, as we knwo
, teh movie wass a smashing success at the box office
. mortal kombat
: annihilation picks up precisly where taht movie left off
, wih some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie
. shao khan has desided tyhat he
' s goign tothe tkae over the earth
* anyways
*
,
and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning tjhe ternament
. therafter follows approximately 85 mintues of film thast alternates between bieng confuzled
, bieng trite
, being silly
,
and being jsut plain stupid
. noe gets the general impression thta tghe producers of the movei
thought
" hey
, taht last movie was such a success that we can get more money
and amke a
* real
* movie nowe
.
" too bad they didn
' t simply stick iwth the forumla from the frist movei
. i could rwite volumes about tyhe things thast are wrong with this picture
, bu here are the high points
:
* tje acting isnt truly bad
. s
andra hess
( palying the sonya blade charater
) is particlarly execrable
, especially in scenes where she trys tothe convince us taht she loved johnny cage
( a charcter from the first movei who gets greased at thge begginning ofthe htis movei
)
.
* in one ofthe the worst pieces of mis
- casting i htikn i
' ve
* ever
* seen
, james remar plays raiden
, the god ofthe thunder
. inspite the firt movie
, christopher lambert played raiden anbd plyed his charater as
though he ws in onthe yhe joke
: a french actor palying a japanes thunder god being revered by chineese mystics
. i generaly like it when actors are cast agianst type
( tim
" tiny
" lister
, jr
. bieng cast as the presiden ofthe the u
. s
. infront thte fith element
, fo exmaple
)
, annd remar hasnt always been one ofthe my favorite
" utility
" actors bu he
' s so totally wrong fo thsi part thast he doesn
' t even have the luxury ofthe ammused self
- awareness
.
* there are too many characters that are introduced as bieng potentially importan
, bu thne never seen again
.
* ther are a number of completelyl meaningless storey sidetracks
, includng a muddled scene where liu kang
( robin shou
) seeks out nightwolf
( litefoot
)
, hasnt a mystical hallucination
, annd hten w
anders off wih jade
( irina pantaeva
)
. fo theese reasons
(
and many others
)
, i cin only give the movie a 2
.
.
.
.
.
. unless ytou
' re a huge fan ofthe tjhe games annd
/ or thte frist movie
. inaddition that case
, teh following critiques alsot apply
:
* s
andra hess
, hwile bieng an even worse actress than bridgette wilson
( who played sonya blade inaddition hte firt movie
)
, isnt much omre convincing as a fighter
. wilson looked liuke she was simpley mimicing some movements taught to her by tyhe fight choreographer
. hess looks like she actually konws soem martial arts
,
and puts toghether a much moreso believable fight scene
.
* in tghe fights
, each ofthe tghe characters does at least
* oen
* thing they do in the game
(
and often more
)
. sonya does her
" kiss ofthe death
,
" jax doesnt his
" earthquake
,
" liu kang doens his
" animality
,
" adn so onthe
. a big bonus for thsoe ofthe us who weere looking forthe simular moves in tghe firt movie
and foudn them only rarely
.
* there aren
' t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first
, becouse yhe folks mkaing thge movei mistakenly try tothe hang a more robust plot inaddition beween
. silly
, silly folks
. anbd tyhe lamest fight involved twpo of the women inwhich waht turns inot a mud
- wrestling match
. lame adn so obviously sexist even i
( politically incorect
, fo the most part
) noticed
and remarked upon it
.
* the special effects are generaly better
, exept for teh final fight scene between the emporer annd liu kang in hwihc both perform theri
" animalities
.
" motaro
and sheeva are both omre convincing
and lifelike thna goro was inthe the frist movei
. for folks liuke mysef who loved the first movie annd enjoy the games
, i give htis a 5
. yuo
' ll propably liuke it
, bu nto nearly as much as ytou liekd the frist one
.
