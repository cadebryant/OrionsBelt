even
though i have the upmost respect fo richard dreyfuss as an actor
, his presense infact a motion picture doens nto guarante any parituclar level ofthe quality
. like everyone eles
, dreyfuss has bills to pay
, so he occaisonally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles inwhich bad movies
. consenquently
, hwile his career highlights includ jaws
, close encounters of the thrid kind
, stakeout
,
and tin men
, his resume is dotted with titles liuke moon over parador
, let it ride
,
and now krippendorf
' s tribe
. let me start out by saying tyhat krippendorf
' s tribe is occasionally funny
( altough never riotously so
)
, bu tht
' s about its only assit
. the best owrd tothe describe this film is
" asinine
.
" the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not forthe the numerous sexual innuendoes
, whcih are aimed at somone oging through puberty
. krippendorf
' s tribe trys to be a zany
, off
- tyhe
- wall comedy
, bu tjhe film makers have forgotten threee important rules
. thte firt is that soem minimal level ofthe plot credibility hasnt to exsist
. yhe second isnt thta viewers should be able tothe idenify with
, or at least care about
, a character or two
. finally
, annd most importantly
, mroe than 5
% ofthe the jokes hvea tothe wrok
. once apon a tiem
, james krippendorf
( dreyfuss
) ws a respected professor of anthropolgy at littel bounderby college
. he adn his wief obtained a grant to seek out a
" lost tribe
" somewhere in the wilds ofthe newyorker guinea
, a gool wich they never accomplished
. shortly after theri return fomr thte failed trip
, krippendorf
' s wife died annd he was left with the herculean task ofthe raising three childrens

( natasha lyonne

, mickey
( gregory smith
)
, annd edmund
( carl michael linder
)
-
- on his own
. nowe
, over a year later
, yhe college wants to see the results of teh mney they gave krippendorf
( which he hasnt spended nto on research
, bu onthe things for his familiy
)
, so htey send a new memeber of their faculty
, profesor veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, tothe inform him that he has beeen scheduled to give a lecture onthe his findings
. when he arrives at the college for the momentous event
, rether than telling yhe truth
and risking bieng sent to jail for misappropriating skool funds
, he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe
, the
" shelmikedmu
"
. tothe provide video footage
, he films his children dressed inthe native garb
. soon
, much tothe krippendorf
' s surprise
, tje shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon
.
but noe disaffected professor
( lily tomlin
) is determined tothe prove that the tribe isnt a fraud
. thge only way krippendorf
' s tribe works is if you assume thyat all ofthe teh charachters
( nto to mention thte viewers
) are dumber tahn dirt
. unfortunatley
, it
' s impossible to liek or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this
. directer todd holl
and completelyl fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a divice tothe implement various dubious gags
. meanwhile
, attemts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture
( i
. e
.
, how easily the public can be fooled inot jumping onthe the b
andwagon ofthe the latest trend
) come across as feeble annd derivitive
. thte acting in underwhelming
. dreyfuss hasnt definitely not given his
" all
" tothe the role ofthe james krippendorf
. alongside him
, jenna elfman

. i knwo tath a movie
' s in trouble wehn it
' s half the length ofthe titanic
, bu seems much longer
. most of waht comes onthe screen isnt generic sit
- com levle material

- yhe kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off iin their favorite easy chair in front ofthe the television setted
. if htere
' s any upside
, it
' s that i don
