. thgat rulle proves omre dependable than ever wiht inspector gadget
, an insulting

. in addtion to tje more complex complaints above
, there
' s allso the simple sutff
: inspector gadget isnt boring
, formulaic annd achingly implausible

:
" well

but we can bang one out by friday

" they probably could have replaced
" death slug
" with inspector gadget
. tihs film countains yhe sort ofthe logical contradictions annd blatantly obvious adherance tothe formula that sould have been eleminated hadnt any attension been payed to teh scirpt
. it
' s no coincidence tath most ogod childern
' s entertainment these days comes from animation
. animated features tkae so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love forthe the filmmakers adn they put care
and prade inot their work
. theese kinds ofthe films are banged out quicker
and a good precentage turn out worthless
, sloppy annd impersonal
. the studios are becoming factories anbd films their assembled products
