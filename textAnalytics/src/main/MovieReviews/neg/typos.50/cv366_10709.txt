- appointed sucessor
, who
' s psychotic
,
and thinks it
' s a gerat idea tothe spend a week witht him annd their wives inwhich an isolated cabin a hundered miles from civilization wiht noone dependable transportation or means ofthe communication aftter a heavy snowfall
. comments
: tracks ofthe a killer hadnt a cuple of strikes against it before i even began watching it
. strike oen was the fact that somone had scrawled yhe owrd garbage onthe teh videotape
' s sticker in black marker
( nto typicaly a good sign whn yuo rent a film
)
. strike twpo came hwile hte previews palyed
. did yuo ever git a sinking premonition about a movei
' s quality
( or lack thereof
) while watching thte trailers tath come befor it
? well
, tje cheesy films being advertised befoer tracks ofthe a killer weere films tath no one hasnt ever heard of starring people noone one konws
, annd they all looked bad
( definately nto a good sign
)
. tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout
. about the only positive thign this film hadnt going forthe it was yhe fact that it sportscar some nice scenery
. to be fair
, hte frist half
- hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller
. wolf larson
, who bears omre tahn a passing ressemblance tothe hugh grant
, adequately plays the underling obviously setted uv as tje killer of the film
' s title
. james brolin
and kelly lebrock seem equally adeuate as thte loving cuple larson iwll later threaten
. brolin
' s charcter
, fo soem inexplicable reason
, thinks its a grat diea tothe spend some timne in a cabin
, practically isolated
, whith lebrock
and larson
, whom he
' s desided tothe tust for tjhe week before giving him full control of his comany
. by tje timne the characters arrive at hte cabin
, this film begins tothe become tedeous
. apparently
, brolin
' s sucessor
' s test involves chopping wood fo the fireplace anbd skiing
, which don
' t seem like attri
butes necessary to run a buisness inthe the city
.
but
,
then again
, wqat dont i knwo about bussiness
? i dont think
,
though
, tyhat tehy shoud have invested iin some better furniture for the cabin
; its beds adn closets have a habbit of just breaking at the slightest touch
. larson
' s charactor accidently kills his pwn wife rether than the cuple he whants tothe kill
. htis leaves tghe movie wtih an hour to go anbd onyl threee characters
, which realyl isn
' t enought to sustain it
. thge film
' s writer must have tooked a cue fomr stephen king
, as scenes fomr tracks ofthe a killer seem lifted out ofthe misery annd gerald
' s game
. larson
and lebrock fight adn torture each other
( the tables git turned a cuple of times
) hwile brolin tramps arround in the snow looking for help
. soem old guy
' s arround too
, jstu so teh killer can add tothe his body count wihtout killing yhe couple
, who everyone konws iwll be alive at the end ofthe thte film
. thte old guy
,
however
, miraculously survives his frist death
and appears later tothe be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it
' s worthy of a chuckle or two
. outside ofthe that chuckle
, unfortunatly
, tracks ofthe a killer wiull jstu bore ytou as the obvious plot isnt drawn outloud ad infinitum annd the actors
, for some reason
, become increasing obnoxious
. if yuo
' re iin a video store
and thinking baout renting this turkey
, don
' t
. make tracks to a far superior suspense film
, like misery
.
