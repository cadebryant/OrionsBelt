" the red violin
" is a cold
, sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved
and detached
. it
' s a movei that seems alomst clinical
, as it traces the 300
- plus
- yeasr history of the legendary muscial intrument of the title
. opening inwhich the 17th centruy
, tghe stopry shows how violin
- maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift forthe his unborn son
. bu whn tradgedy strikes
, the violin becomes thte personification of its maker
' s greif
. fomr there tjhe violin comes inot tyhe h
ands ofthe an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monestary
. again
, tradgedy strikes as tjhe child isnt striked down at the moent ofthe his triumph
. we follow the violin thru tje centruies as it finds a home in engl
and
and inwhich mao
' s communist china befor bieng dicovered by expert charles morritz
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who mounts a painstaking investigation tothe proove its au
thenticity
. thte violin becomes morritz
' s obession
, jstu as it is for all thsoe who converge on a montreal auction house to bid onthe it
. morritz
,
however
, is the onyl one who knows the secret ofthe yhe instrument annd can underst
and
and appreciate its creater
' s intention
.
" the red violin
" sould ahve beeen a touching
, inspirational story
, as soaring as a beethoven symphony
. howver director francois girard fails tothe make any emotional conection with hte viewer
. here isnt a story that sould ahev made use of vairous camera angles anbd lightnig to heighten its inpact
. girard
, forthe some unkown reason
, uses mostly master shots
, keeping his camera
-
and thus us
- at a distance
. we get noone feel forthe the miracle that isnt the violin
. it
' s resonance
, its purity of soudn are not emphasized enough to make an impression
. nor are any ofthe teh performances memorable
. it
' s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle tothe his violin
.
" hte red violin
" promises much
,
but delivers little
. it isnt dull at times
, a bited pretentious anbd a might murky
. the movei
' s music soars over its story
and performers
.
and thta isnt its onyl saveing grace
.
