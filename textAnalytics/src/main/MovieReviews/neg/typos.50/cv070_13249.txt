it rocks
- accually
, lots ofthe rocks fli at us or ffrom us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points inaddition the film
. they seem like dangerous rocks becouse htey kind of twirl through the air instade of just propelling foward
,
and when htey l
and
- once in a hwile
, when we ened a break from hte spoace sequences
- htey cause dammage enought tothe destroy tje chrysler buiding adn tghe liuke
.
( nary a mention of theese apocalyptic events isnt made after htey occur
.
) they also just might be the most interesting element ofthe armageddo
, a steroid user
' s answer to deepo inpact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oel
- driller comisioned by thte white hous anbd nasa tothe stpo a giant asteroid befoer it travels beyond
" zero barrier
" anbd destroys our planet
. why an oel driller
? tehy require somone experience with deepo
- core mining tothe plant a nuclear misile into said asteroid
.
( inwhich oney unintentionally
(
?
) hilarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep
- core driller they builded based on his blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost eveyr aspect ofthe it
. we trust nasa to build spoace shuttles
?
) harry assembles hte obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch ofthe
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a black guy
, a wiseass
, adn tjhe man who is sleeping iwth his duaghter
( affleck
)
. once they triarch spoace
, we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong
- perheaps hte fact thast they sent a bunch of nincompoops inot outer space hasnt something to do with it
; i cannot count teh number ofthe times they alomst fail thte mission onthe all my fingers adn toes
. whether or nto they save tyhe day
, i will not reveal
. nor iwll you care
. i wiull say thsi
: you know you
' re inspite trouble whn deep inpact dwarfs your astroid movei in terms ofthe emotion anbd scope
. willis has barely a chance tothe come alive
; ditto for affleck
. theri big scenes are mostly reserved fo the thrid ect
, in a lastest minute
-
and futile
- attempt to inject warmth inot tghe material
. steve buscemi
' s character
- tyhe wiseass
- is exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he
' s called
, isnt sarcastic annd foolish
, so tehy tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why doed they bring him up there to begin with
? rather
, why write him into tjhe film
?
- give his almsot
- witty one
- liners to sereous willis
, who scowls
and mopes anbd demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at one point he chases affter affleck with his shotgun fo screwing his duaghter
, firing often adn causing significant dammage to his oil rig
. i
' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit forthe spoace travel
, at least in my world where yhe sky is blue
. liv tyler isnt pretty
and humourless
, as always
; suspiciously
, four of her father
' s b
and
' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace thte sountrack
. director michael bay lays yhe visual annd sound effects onthe thick
, liek ketchup
, eventially drowning the movie on
- screen
.
( hte middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault onthe thte averege primate
' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies inspite this movei
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person
' s lastr name here
)
!
" i must admitt tath nto once coudl i distinguish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live noe
, annd close
- ups of hte corpses
' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assisstance
, as their skin ws oftenly covered in fake blood
. armageddon is not as terrable movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
, adn has fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
. bu at alomst two
-
and
- a
- half hours
, i could nto belieev how littel atually happenned over tje course of thge stoyr
. the love stoyr hasnt beeen played up infact tje ads
, prehaps hoping tothe catch peple before htey recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers iin teh film are miles apart throughout
- erase all
thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex
and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up hwile ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. remeber a littel film called jaws
? in this film
, three independent
- minded men suddenly foudn themselves onthe a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark
. they didn
' t much like each otehr at first
; eventally
, htey started tothe respect oney anohter
. oen of jaws
' graet scenes involved teh owudl
- be
- ahabs drinking adn singing songs
and telling storie
. this isnt tje sort ofthe male
- bonding ofreign tothe bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many cahracters into tghe mix anbd expect we
' ll care about them onthe the grounds thast the world isnt baout tothe end
. not once dont we git yhe feeling that theese cahracters are even acquaintences
- i
' d be surprised if theese actors bothered to introduce themselfs tothe one another befoer
" acation
" was called
. a male freind who loved the film suggested to me that perhasp i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don
' t bare their souls
, who eblieve inthe dieing macho concepts like heroism
and a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. to this
, i wiull respond thyat yhe boys in armgeddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: tihs team couldn
' t build a birdhouse
. annd if i git noone respect forthe disliking a movei with all thte synthetic feeling ofthe a trailer
- a trailer for a movei writed by a team of body
- builders adn greeting card authors
- i
' ve never beeen a prouder wimp my wohle life
