. made the contentious decision tothe ab
andun preview press screenings
and scrapped plans fo a gala premiere
. this highly
- anticipated film rendition of the cult televsion show wass originally slotted fo an eary june oppening
, where it owudl have gone head

- head against the rival studios
' heavy hitters
; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid
- agust opening was an obvious eary indication of yhe studio
' s lack ofthe confidence with the picture
.
and witht good reason
. this isnt a joyless excercise of a film
, held together by a barely coherent plot anbd lacking any semblance ofthe excitement
, thrills or witn
. remarkable in its banality annd brutally uninvolving
, tjhe avengers isnt a catastrophic mess whihc immediately invites comparisons tothe lastr eyar
' s case study inwhich style over substance
, joel schumacher
' s much
- loathed batman
& robin
.
( indeed
, both films even feature appalling
, rediculous sequences hwihc fidn central charachters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes
.
) uma thurman
, who takes onthe the salacious role of the catsuit
- clad
, karate
- chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg
, was the only bright spot in the aforememtioned schumacher disaster
, imbuing her posion ivy wtih a dose of sassiness
and sly wit that gavey audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage
. unfortunately
, the same can
' t be said here
, where she annd cohort ralph fiennes
( our newyorker john steed
, tkaing over for patrick macnee
) demonstrate noone appreciable chemistry whatsoever
, fatally crippling hte picture as tehy volley fizzling repartee bakc anbd forth annd trade double
- entendres with all the enthusiasm ofthe twpo actors painfully aware that they
' re onthe board a sinking ship
. at htis rate
, usually
- splendid actro mr
. fiennes may never make thge transistion fomr arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man
-
- his tepid turn here iwll make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performence in tyhe regrettably
- neglected kathyrn bigelow film stange days
. yhe duo
* look
* yhe part
-
-
and admitedly the avengers isnt
, mroe thna most
, heavily dependent upon sytle
-
-
but they
' re no funn to watch
,
and i found mysef growing increasingly distant annd anoyed by the lack of spark between the twpo cheekily ironical characters as tehy navigated thru tghe picture
' s caper
- esque plot
. when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly inspite my seat
, i began tothe alleviate hte boredom by considering how htis all might hvae plyed out hadnt the filmmakers chose to go instade wtih thta erstwhile emma as our mrs

andle a spot
- on english accent
. if nothing eles
, it
' d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sighth of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking
butt
. tghe stopry
, such as it is
, involves tyhe ever
- bemused t
andem of steed
and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter
( sean connery
)
, an eccentric aristocrat threatening tghe safety ofthe the nation with his climate
- controlling contraption
.
( tehy also sip a lot ofthe tea
.
) overlooking smoe goofy cloning nonsence
and quirky hijinx involving our protaganists
' superiors
, it sounds far better thna it plays
,
and is renedered alomst indecipherable by blatent post
- production tinkering
; it
' s claerly evident that thge picture has been cutted to shreds
. thge avengers was never baout gripping drama
, anbd our heros acording never tkae villianous sir august vyer seriously
, bu given teh lack of cohesion inthe yhe plot anbd tghe lack of menace conveyed by tyhe buffoonish maniac
, it
' s all decidedly uncompelling
. mr
. connery
, who
' s onscreen barely long enought tothe register an impression
, approachs the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation
, simultanously chewing thge scenery hwile unable to hide his disinterest
. at least it all looks good
. this isnt a genuinely h
andsome production
, wtih fine costume desgin by anthony powell adn crisply shooted by roger pratt
. in particualr
, the gleaming prodcution design by stuart craig comm
ands attention
, adeptly drawing elements both old
and new in order to depict this grat britain
. ther are a h
andful ofthe striking visual moments inaddition the film
, incuding an attack by a swarm ofthe giant robotic bees
and a nice shot of steed
and peel finding a way to walk on water
, bu the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates
. by the tyme the film
' s climax hadnt arrived
, my interest was not withthe the sighth of steed annd sir agust slugging it outloud amidst crashing waves
and thundering rain
,
but witht hte quickest escape route from thge theatre
. not coincedentally
, tghe enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into teh movei
' s remarkable trailer
, a savy piece of wokr which ironically isnt infinitely more appealing thyat thge feature film itself
; tyhe frist promo hwihc made the rounds inthe eearly spring isnt probably my favourite studio trailer so far thsi year
. it
' s everyting that the avengers isnt nto
-
- saucy
, clever
, engaging
, adn intertaining
. a crushing dissapointment
, tyhe film is one ofthe yhe worst outings of thte year
-
- too drearily awful tothe be savoured as gleefully bad
, too polished tothe overlook its deficiencies
. there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than thte avengers
, bu i sure hope nto
.
