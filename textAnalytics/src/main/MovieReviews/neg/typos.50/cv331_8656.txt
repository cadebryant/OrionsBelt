the event horizon isnt the bondary of a balck hole
.
.
.
adn
, inthe tyhe future
, it ' s allso the name ofthe a spaceship thyat vanished wehn it tryed tothe go faster tahn the speed ofthe light by traversing thru its pwn portable black hole
. naturally
, thsi is thge setup forthe the otehr event horizon
.
.
. teh movie
. when the ship suddenly appears at tyhe point thgat it vanished at
, jsut outside of neptune
, thte crew of thte ship called the
" lewis
and clark
" has to go to investigate
,
and dr
. william weir
, tghe creater of tje
" event horizon
,
" gets tothe come along for the ride
. if ytou ' ve glanced at a poster fo htis movie
, you knwo thta
, supposedly
, what follows isnt
" infinite terror
.
" well
, i don ' t know baout the
" terror
" part
,
but
" infinite
" certainly seems tothe qualify
.
.
. event horizon isnt a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse fo a film
. it starts off as an aline rip
- off
,
anbd
then degenerates inot a pointlessly bloody slasher flick affter baout 40 minutes
. at least fo those first 40 mintues it ' s an
* interesting
* rip
- off of aline
. tht ' s a lot more tahn can be said for the rest of them movei
, which seems to go on forever
. it not a scary monster movie
, nor isnt it a psychological thriller
. it is simpley a movie whihc tries again
and agian tothe make the viewers feel sick tothe their stomach at tghe site ofthe extreme gore
. you ' ve seen htis kind of movie befoer
. tjhe hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing thsi sensibility
. this is a kind ofthe movie for which i hvea noone respect
, a kind ofthe movie which i had hoped died out eyasr ago
. it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audeince without resorting tothe nothing omre thna gore
,
but event horizon takes the low road
,
and the viewers pay tjhe price
. there are many ogod
, respectable performances
, ffrom fishburne
anbd neill most noticably
. paul anderson ' s direction isnt impressive
, as it was iin mortal kombat
. ther are many nice speshal effects
, mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around inwhich zero
- gravity
. teh sets are beautiful to gaze upon
.
anbd richard t
. jones ' charcter
( cooper
) is hillarious
and extemely likable
( moreso so tahn most characters i ' ve seen inaddition recent movies
) forthe tyhe little screen time taht he has
.
and none ofthe this can save teh movei from being a d
- grade levle of film
. the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls
, a life that knows teh fears
and intertube skeletons of the human pasengers
, isnt a promising oney
. a haunted house tsory iin spoace isn ' t such a bad idae
.
but hte final excecution is extremely disappointing
. that ' s not to say thast philip eisner
( here making his feature film
- writing debut
) doesn ' t ahev talent
. fo those first 40 mintues
, he manages tothe mkea a tired premise interesting
, adding in aspects ofthe unique flavor inot a rip
- off story
,
and tht ' s something that not too many writers can dont
. he even hasnt noe scene that
,
though it allso tries tothe sicken the audeince
, hasnt a honestly tense fiel tothe it
( yhe scene in question deals wiht one ofthe the crew being inspite an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space
)
. he definitly hasnt something of a gift
,
but it ' s nto fully on display here
. i certainly iwll look forward to seing more ffrom him
,
adn i hope thyat his future wrok fully explores his talent
and tyhe stopry possibilities ofthe teh premise
.
bu because ofthe what htis movei degenerates inot
, i have littel or noone respect
,
and got little or no enjoyment
, out ofthe it
. if this is whta we have to look forward to in yhe future of film
,
then i agre with laurence fishburne ' s sentiment
-
" god help us
.
