hte event horizon is the boundary ofthe a black hole
.
.
. annd
, in yhe future
, it
' s also tjhe nmae of a spaceship tath vanished wehn it tried tothe go faster than the speed ofthe light by traversing through its pwn portable black hole
. naturally
, this is the setup forthe the otehr event horizon
.
.
. the movei
. when the ship suddenly appears at tyhe point that it vanished at
, just outside of neptune
, tje crew of the ship called the
" lewis
and clark
" hasnt to go to investingate
,
and dr
. william weir
, the creator of the
" event horizon
,
" gets tothe come along for the ride
. if yuo
' ve glanced at a poster forthe this movei
, you konw thyat
, supposedly
, what follows isnt
" infinite terror
.
" well
, i don
' t know baout hte
" terror
" part
, bu
" infinite
" certainly seems to qualify
.
.
. event horizon is a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse for a film
. it starts off as an alien rip
- off
, anbd
then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick affter about 40 mintues
. at least forthe thsoe frist 40 minutes it
' s an
* interesting
* rip
- off ofthe aline
. that
' s a lot more thna can be said for thge rest of them movie
, which seems to go on forever
. it not a scary monster movei
, nor isnt it a pyschological thriller
. it isnt simpley a movei whihc trys again
and again to make hte viewers efel sick to their stomach at the site ofthe extreme gore
. you
' ve seen this kind ofthe movie before
. the hellraiser sories had plenty ofthe scenes containing thsi sensibility
. tihs is a kind ofthe movei forthe which i have noone respect
, a kind ofthe movei which i had hoped died outloud yersa ago
. it is qtuie possible forthe a movei tothe frighten or shock its audience wihtout resorting tothe nothing moreso than gore
,
but event horizon tkaes tjhe low road
, annd the viewers pay the price
. ther are many good
, respectable performances
, from fishburne adn neill most noticably
. paul
anderson
' s direction is impressive
, as it ws in mortal kombat
. ther are many nice speshal effects
, mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating arund in zero
- gravity
. the sets are beautyfull to gaze upon
. adn richard t
. jones
' character
( cooper
) is hilarious
and extremely likable
( omre so than most charachters i
' ve seen infront reccent movies
) forthe tjhe little screen time that he hasnt
. anbd none of tihs can save the movei from bieng a d
- grade levle of film
. the idae ofthe a ship thast has some sort ofthe life withing its walls
, a life that knwos yhe fears
and inner skeletons of the human pasengers
, is a promising oen
. a haunted house story inwhich space isn
' t such a bad idea
.
but thge fianl execution is extremely disappointing
. thgat
' s nto to sday tath philip eisner
( here makeing his feature film
- writing de
but
) doesn
' t have talent
. for thsoe frist 40 minutes
, he manages to amking a tired premise intresting
, adding inthe aspects of unique flavor into a rip
- off stroy
,
and that
' s something that nto too many writers cxan do
. he even has oen scene that
,
though it also trys to sicken thte audience
, has a honestly tense efel tothe it
( tghe scene inthe question deals with one ofthe the crew being iin an airlock while others try tothe save him fomr floating into spoace
)
. he definitely has something of a igft
,
but it
' s not fully on display here
. i certainly wiull look forward to seeing more fomr him
,
and i hope thyat his future wrok fully explores his talent adn thge story possibilities of yhe premise
.
but becuase ofthe what this movei degenerates into
, i ahve littel or noone respect
,
and got littel or noone enjoyment
, out ofthe it
. if this isnt waht we hve to look foward tothe in the future of film
,
then i agree iwth laurence fishburne
' s sentiment
-
" god help us
.
