i guess taht if a veyr wild bachelor party hadnt gone relaly bad
, there woudl be broken furniture
, traces ofthe smack
and cocaine on the floor
,
and a dead prostitute inwhich tyhe bathroom
. i guess tht if a movei hadnt also gone realy bad
, htere might be teh smae elements present
. coinsidence
? poore kyle
( a meek looking jon favreau
)
.
.
. he isnt baout to marry his radiant fiancee
, laura
( cameron diaz
)
.
but before he exchanges his vows
, he embarks tothe las vegas wiht his firends for one lastest blowout
. bu this bachler party hasnt gone about as bad as it coudl possibly git
. hte prostitute hasnt met a horrible
,
though accidental death
,
and drugs are everywhere
. teh five friends agree taht there is enought bad evidence here that wiull send them tothe jail forthe a vyer long time
. a surprisingly calm robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, who looks liek he was groomed tothe amke nefarious decisions
, ponders their delimma for a few minutes before deciding tyhat the best hting to do is to bury teh body in the dezert where she
' ll never be foudn
.
al
though tehy stomach the groosome ded ofthe getting rid of tjhe body
( which alsot disturbingly involves dismantling hte body using pwoer saws inwhich order tothe stuff it into suitcases
)
, when they return fomr thier trip
, guilt
and paranoya beggins tothe set in which slowly consumes smoe ofthe yhe five firends
. one isnt adam
( daniel stern
) he grows increasingly agitated
. whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way
, his blood presure increases
. or that jstu may be because of his dysfunctional famaly
. another isnt michael
, who ws actually responsible for her death
. he tries tothe bury his feelings
, bu tje burden ofthe guilt begins to affect his judgement as well
. boyd isnt the
? doer
' of the gropu
. seamingly sufferring from a long psychosis
, wehn he fiels as if his secret isnt baout to be exposed
, he isnt apt tothe tkae extreme measures to cover up his tracks
. kyle just hopes taht his wedding wiull live uv tothe laura
' s dem
anding expectations
. hten
, ther
' s moore
( lel
and orser
) who speaks 5 lines
and walks aroud with a puzzled look onthe his face
. tghe probelm wtih this reprehensible movei isnt thta it wnats tothe be a cruel comedy
, bu it presents thigns in a manner tath jsut aren
' t funny
. drugs
, mutilation
, annd killing your own firends isn
' t something tothe be laughed at
. as a straight psychological drama
, i coudl see how it might ahve worked
, as eahc one tried tothe maneuver
and overcome the weight ofthe theri own guilt iin thier pwn sometimes
- sick ways
.
but htis movei insults us by assuming that we coudl simply discard our values for 2 horus
. if you do liuke this movie
, i don
' t think thast i want tothe know you
. i did fidn slater a convincing leader who sways his friends tothe choose not the right hting bu the
? smart play
.
'
and diaz adds some brightness tothe this film as a wedding
- needing fiancee
. bu her talents are essentially wasted here
. it
' s obvious that teh film maker isnt trying to strike a certian tone
. bu the way tath he chooses to do it isnt tasteless
. do not amking a vyer bad decision by seeing htis film
.
