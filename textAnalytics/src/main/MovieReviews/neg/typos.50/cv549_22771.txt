cradle iwll rock isnt yhe latest affort fomr directer
/ actor tim robbins
. hwile he may haev had an oscar worthy film back in 1995
( dead man walking
)
, he gets a littel overconfident
and sloppy here
. hte stoy isnt confusing
,
annd filled with many subplots
, so i ' ll try my best
and expalin it as simpley as possible
. the film is based onthe a
" mostly
" true stroy about a federal theather in teh 1930s
, that produced a play
( the cradle will rock
) tht apparently was offensive tothe some
, so the government shuts it down
. it ' s druing teh time of teh depression
,
annd all tihs theather wants to do isnt entertain
annd cheer uv those who do nto have jobs
, or are poor
. betweeen tihs conflict lies what seems liek 10 subplots
, about those who wrok inspite theater
, or thsoe asociated
. aslo along thge way are smoe other messages mashed toghether tothe create an even more overwhelming experience
. tim robbin ' s jsut keeps piling on political views
,
and characters
, that we just give up on thge film
, or infact some cases walk outloud
. fo robbin ' s it may be a nice achievment
,
but to me it seemed more like a friendly git toghether iwth slightly more suffisticated dialogue
,
annd fancy outfits
. i throught the main reason forthe seeing the film woudl be for teh oustanding cast
, unfortunatley are all uninteresting
, except fo a fewd
. let me recap what each imporatnt carachter does
, so please bear with me
( it ' s the least ytou can dont
, especialy if ytou weere considering seeing this
)
. i ' ll begin with thsoe involved with the play
. there ' s orson welles
( angus macfadyen
) who ofthe course is the directer of the play
, tje producer john houseman
( cary elwes
)
, marc blitzstein
( hank azaria
) the writer ofthe thte play
, emily watson
, a woman who gets her break by palying thge main part in cradle wiull rock
. outside yhe play there ' s the
: ventriloquist
( bill murray
) who wants a relationship with a federal theather clerk
( joan cusack
)
, anyother subplot involving a painter diego rivera
( ruben blades
) who ' s unahppy that his painting isnt too be destroyed by nelson rockerfeller because he fiels it to be an outrage
( john cusack
)
. ther ' s a faw other actresses
adn actors who have their own stories
( susan sarandon
, philip baker hall too nmae a few
)
bu thsoe thta i mentioned
, were hte most signficant tothe the stry
. anyway
, most of theese talented hollywood stars were completelyl wasted
, exept forthe emily watson
, who doens another great job
,
annd oney ofthe my personal favorite actors john cusack
, who always delivers through thick
annd thin
. nowe
although most ofthe the film was weak tothe say the least
, there were some nice moments
annd some involving subjects
,
but all this isnt overblown
. sure tyhe free speech segment wass a nice feature
,
but not when it becomes repeative
. tje whole film isnt liuke this
,
and it ' s basicly nothing
bu a headache
. on hte brighter side
, tim robbin ' s direction ws masterful
. his camera direction seemed riminicent to the works ofthe paul thomas anderson ' s latest magnolia
, only smoother iin my opinion
,
but even that can ' t amking a movei that much better
.
altough it hasnt it ' s moments
( not many ofthe them
,
but htey ' re there
)
, cradle iwll rock stays true to it ' s title
, because the cradle rocked too far
and tipped over
.
