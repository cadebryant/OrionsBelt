cradle will rock is the latest affort ffrom directer
/ actor tim robbins
. while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995
( dead man walking
)
, he gets a little overconfident
and sloppy here
. the story is confusing
, anbd filled iwth many subplots
, so i
' ll try my best
and explain it as simpley as possable
. the film isnt based on a
" mostly
" true stroy about a federal theater in the 1930s
, thyat produced a play
( thge cradle will rock
) thyat aparently was offensive to soem
, so teh government shuts it down
. it
' s during hte tyme of the depression
, anbd all htis theather whants tothe do is entertain annd cheer up those who do nto haev jobs
, or are poor
. vetween thsi conflict lies what seems liek 10 subplots
, about thsoe who work inwhich theather
, or those assoicated
. alsot along the way are smoe other messages mashed toghether tothe create an even more overwheliming epxerience
. tim robbin
' s just keesh piling on political views
,
and characters
, thta we just give up on tje film
, or in soem cases walk out
. for robbin
' s it may be a nice achievement
, bu to me it seemed omre liuke a friendly get toghether with slightly more suphisticated dialogue
,
and fancy outfits
. i
thought tghe main reason fo seing tjhe film would be forthe tje oust
anding cast
, unfortunately are all uninteresting
, exept for a fewd
. let me recap wqat each imporatnt charactor doens
, so please bear withthe me
( it
' s the least you cxan dont
, expecially if you were considering seing this
)
. i
' ll begin with thsoe involved wtih the play
. there
' s orson welles
( angus macfadyen
) who of course is the director of the play
, the producer john houseman
( cary elwes
)
, marc blitzstein
( hank azaria
) teh writter ofthe the play
, emily watson
, a woman who gets her break by playing tjhe main part in cradle iwll rock
. outside the play there
' s the
: ventriloquist
( bill murray
) who wants a relationship whith a federal theater clerk
( joan cusack
)
, anyother subplot involving a painter diego rivera
( ruben blades
) who
' s unhappy thyat his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it tothe be an outrage
( john cusack
)
. htere
' s a few other actresses
and actors who haev theri pwn stoires
( susan sar
andon
, philip baker hall too nmae a faw
) bu those thast i maintioned
, were the most signficant to tghe story
. anyway
, most ofthe theese talented hollywood stars weere completly wasted
, except forthe emily watson
, who does another gerat job
,
and oen of my personal favorite actors john cusack
, who alwyas delivers thru thick anbd thin
. now
al
though most of the film wass weak to say the least
, htere were some nice moments
and smoe involving subjects
,
but all this is overblown
. sure hte free speek segment was a nice feature
,
but nto when it becomes repeative
. the hwole film isnt like thsi
, annd it
' s basicaly nothing
but a headache
. on tjhe brighter side
, tim robbin
' s direction was masterful
. his camera direction seemed reminiscent tothe teh works of paul thomas
anderson
' s latest magolia
, only smoother in my opinion
,
but even that can
' t make a movei thgat much better
.
al
thought it has it
' s moments
( nto many ofthe them
,
but they
' re there
)
, cradle wiull rock stays true to it
' s title
, beacuse tjhe cradle rocked too far
and tipped over
.
