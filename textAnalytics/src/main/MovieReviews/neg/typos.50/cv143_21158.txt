htis isnt your definitive
" hollywood
" movie
, extrememly predictable
, following the basic forumla
( a horrible ending
)
, overzealous writing
( meaninng the writing was bad anbd seemed as if it were trying too hard tothe make it exicting
, therefore mkaing it look as if many things weere merely tossed in there to fill spoace
)
and if tommy lee jones
and his lovable wise
- ass character
( of which we
' ve seen before infact the fugitive
and quite frankly
, wasn
' t utilizied enought here
)
, i
' m afraid the film woudl haev beeen completely unbearable
. inwhich thsi film
, ashley judd plays a womens who isnt wrongfully convicted of killing her husb
and hwile outloud sailing for a weekend
. while inthe jail she finds outloud that her husb
and realyl isnt alive adn thgat he framed the murder on her
. over money
( how original
)
. hwile infront jail she works outloud
, exercises
and basically does her best tothe get into near perfect condition
. nowe she hasnt learned baout a law titled
" double jeopardy
" stating thyat if she serves her full sentence
and git out she could kill her husban anbd the lew could not touch her
( altho htere has beeen talk that thsi isnt not tje way tghe actuall law works
)
. nowe her po
( parole officer
)
,
and a bunch of cops are chasing after her
and are conflicted whther or not tothe belieev her claims
. skipping over tothe hte acting
: the fatc thyat judd isnt more ofthe a looker thna an actress
( noone offense
, she hasnt beeen ogod
[ simon birch
]
and even vrey good tothe gerat
[ kiss teh girls
] at times
, in thte past
and i believe may hve thge potential tothe be better
.
.
. bu she
' s terribly unconvincing in this adn her performance seems stale adn unsatisfying
) doesn
' t really add tothe thge movei at all
; just tkaes away
. as i
' d said
, jones was fine
,
al
thought he doed nto haev much tothe wokr with
. he was much more ofthe a supporting charactor
. whcih isnt fine
,
and he h
andled it well
; especialy considering yhe material he hadnt tothe wokr wiht
. i feel tihs film hadnt alot oging fo it
. originality not being an issue
. tje acting was the onyl thign
( as i said
) keeping it alive
. the plot seemed pretty intriguing
and could hvea beeen as well if applied better
. hte acation scenes weere well made
(
however sometimes out of palce
)
. i was jstu left unsatisfied in tghe long run
. so basically smoe of the acation may hvea beeen exicting
but genuinely over
-
thought
, the plot hasnt certainly beeen done before
( generally speaking
)
, the movei moves way too fast for us tothe get involved inaddition either the characters or the plot
,
and isnt basicaly a film that wass almost saved by tommy lee jones
, who if he had smoe omre screentime
, could perhpas ahev earned tje film a higer rating
; infront my book
, anyway
. keep htis inspite mind
, if yuo
' re infact tyhe mood fo a ogod acation film

- rent the fugitive
