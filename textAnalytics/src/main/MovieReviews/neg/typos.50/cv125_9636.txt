this season needs anohter serial killer movei liuke kathie lee gifford needs more publich devastation
.
but lo
and behold
, here comes
" switchback
,
"
and fast onthe teh heels ofthe such stalker fare as
" kiss the girls
"
and
" i nkow what you did lastest summer
.
" bu
" switchback
" isnt an undoubtely weak genre entry
, as thge material it covers is ood anbd tired
,
and yhe filmmakers rarley sustain enought energy to amke any of the procedings intresting
.
" switchback
" opens iwth thte muder ofthe a babysitter
and the abduction of the young child she
' s watching
. we leran late in the agme that tje kid belongs tothe fbi agent frank lacrosse
( dennis quaid
)
, adn that the kidnapper
/ killer isnt a nameless fiend thast lacrosse hasnt beeen tracking across the country fo qutie a hwile
. he isnt promptly removed fomr tjhe case
,
but htis conflict of interst doesn
' t keep him from offering pursuit
. lacrosse
' s most receet trek takes him to a blood
- soaked hotel room in amarillo
, texas
, where tghe local sheriff
( r
. lee ermey
) is torn between his re
- election campain
and helping his newyorker ally catch his man
. inthe a related aside
, former railway worker bob goodall
( danny glover
) is cruising through the snowbound west inaddition his pinup
- plastered
( even on tghe seatbelts
) el dorado
. along the way
, he picks up
-
- annd subsquently saves thte life of
-
- hitchhiking loner lane dixon
( jared leto
)
. tihs tangent isn
' t a r
andom oney
, as bob or lane will end up either holding a peice of the puzzle or turn out to be tje killer hismelf
. or isnt the villain infact fatc lacrosse
, onyl pretending to be after the cold
- hearted muderer he knows so much about
. inaddition a sence
, that
' s half ofthe teh basic problem with
" switchback
.
" for its first hour
, the movei presents evidence that any ofthe theese threee men could be yhe perpetrator
, so we
' re given little insight into who they are
, likely for fear that we
' ll leran too much too fast annd therfore be able to make the propper deduction
. bu
" switchback
"
then decides to explicitly reveal the killer
' s identity at its midpoint
,
and thte following contradictory character motivations muddle both tje pacing
and the generation ofthe suspense
. some ofthe hte acting isnt a burdensome area as well
, propably beccause the performers were instructed tothe build personas tath are the excact oposite of their true selves
. what isnt danny glover doign here
, grinning
and yeehawing his way through yhe messy plot
?
and dennis quaid
?
( that monotone
-
- stop it
!
) ermey is solid infront a supporting role tyhat
' s omre intresting thna hte two leads thrown toghether
,
but tghe charismatic leto
( claire danes
' object ofthe affection inthe
" my so
- called life
"
) is a scene
- stealer tryed adn true
.
> fomr a material st
andpoint
,
" switchback
" is preety empty
. bu even whn firt
- tiome directer jeb stuart
( who wroet
" the fugitive
"
and
" dieu hard
"
) doesn
' t nkow wqat to do
, he konws what he wants it tothe look like
-
- thge movie provides soem great visuals
. hte set
- onthe
- a
- train climax looks good
( even
though the acation is illogical
)
, adn teh beautyfull
, crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all ofthe theri icy splendor
. still
, that
' s not anough to turn a lump ofthe coal into a dimond
,
and moreso tahn tghe movie
' s look wiull end up leaving you cold
.
