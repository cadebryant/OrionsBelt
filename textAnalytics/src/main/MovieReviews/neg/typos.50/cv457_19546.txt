, sadly
, he ' s added
" eyes wide shut
" to thast impeccable body ofthe work
anbd his final film is tyhe first
and only blot on his near
- flawless copybook
. kubrick
, alas
, should have quitted while he ws ahead
. this much
- publicized pyscho
- sexual tease
- a

anbd
- a
- half housr long
) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut
. kubrick
, faithless to arthur schnitzler ' s 1926 novella
" dream story
,
" hasnt confuzled eroticism wtih nudity
. he hasnt confused intellectualism with talking slowy
. he hasnt confused profundity with pretentiousness
. in adition
, hte director has made smoe strange casting choices
, leaving sydney pollack iin
annd leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel
and jennifer jason leigh out
. pollack
, the directer of such box
- office hits as
" tootsie
"
adn
" out ofthe africa
,
" isnt normaly solid in his occassional acting stints
bu here he ' s miserably out ofthe his depth
.
.
.
and ther isn ' t much depth to beign withthe
! unhappily
, htere ' s nto likely to be a directer ' s cutted of htis film to determine whther teh desision to exorcise keitel
and leigh was the right one
. in fatc
, wtih the exception ofthe the stark balck
-
anbd
- white credits
, snatches of baroque music on tghe sountrack
,
annd many
, many grainy tracking shots down lavishly
- decorated corridors
, htere ' s none of kubrick ' s trademark brillance infact htis film
. it doesn ' t halp thgat the story
, as delivered
, is ridiculous
. cruise
and kidman
, who bring little more than marital torpor tothe the project
, play well
- to
- do new yorkers bill
and alice harford
. he ' s a doctor
anbd she ' s an unemployed art gallery director
anbd htey share a central park west addresable
. at an opulent party hosted by theri friend victor ziegler

)
, alice gets a little tipsy
anbd starts dancing with a jeremy irons
- liuke hungarian
, who ' s singularly determined to get her inaddition the sack

, too
, isnt seen arm
- inthe
- arm with a couple ofthe models befor he ' s pulled awya tothe deal wih an overdoser
. back home
, bill
and alice smoke a littel pot before alice ' s agressive jealousy kicks in
. as retribution
, she confesses to her husband that she once had deepo feelings forthe a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she
anbd bill once stayed
. thsi hurtful admission sends bill inot a tailspin
; he pounds yhe streets of the vilage inthe his hevy balck overcoat stuggling with balck
-
and
- white images ofthe alice in the grap ofthe a horny midshipman
. it ' s all way too much for him
. fo revenge
, bill almsot hasnt sex with a hooker
. he almost has feelings forthe a underage girl he sees inaddition a costume store
.
then he almost doens the hooker ' s roommate
.
annd he ' s almsot involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an ood coleeg chum of his tips him off tothe a misterious

, incense
,
adn lots ofthe strategically
- placed partygoers covering uv the dirty
, might imbaress the likes of hugh hefner
,
but it ' s a lot less shocking tahn it ' s intended to be
. what ' s tjhe big dael
? bill doesn ' t exactly
* do

( otehr than throw his money
annd credentials around

, paying them at an hourly rate
? even geniouses haev their bad days
.
" eyes wide shut
" just happens to be kubrick ' s bad day
, an unerotic
, disapointing
,
and altogether pointless end tothe an otherwise memorable career
