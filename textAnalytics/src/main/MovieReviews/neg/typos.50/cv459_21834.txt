)
, in response to why he created evil bats
. alright folks
, stop me if you
' ve heard thsi one
: genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town
and a small b
and of locals
, assisted by a specialist in yhe particualr animal
' s feeld
, must team up to stop the mutant creatures befor htey can multiply anbd spreaded acrost the earth
. oh yeah
, yhe miliary isnt on their way to bomb the twon as well
, so htey are running short onthe tyme
. sound familiar
? such isnt thge plot of the destination films release ofthe bats
. dina meyer stars as the
" bat specialist
" sheila
, who is pulled fomr her research
( allong with her annoying sidekick
, plyed with irritating deftness by leon
) infront order tothe help a small texas twon figure outloud why smoe local citizens
and animals have beeen chewed tothe death recently
. with the halp ofthe the local sheriff
( lou dimond phillips
)
, a cdc offical
( carlos jacott
)
,
and a scientist
( bob gunton
)
, sheila dicovers it is indeed bats
( who have beeen genetically altered by gunton
' s character tothe be mroe gagressive annd omnivorous
, inwhich order tothe be utilisied as a miliraty weppon
!
)
. i hvea to say here thta i knew exactlly whta i was getting into gogin into thsi film
. htere
' s not a frome ofthe promotional footage i have seen for teh film tht woudl hve led me tothe beieve it ws going tothe be any good
. infact this respect
, thte film never disappointed me
. this film reaches a levle thgat transcends teh
" so bad it
' s ogod
" level
and borders on the downright insane
. the effects are awful
, thge script is contrived
, anbd for most of the feature i wass laughing at thigns thast were suppossed tothe be tooked seriously
( i htink
)
. i challenge anyone to sit through tje scene
, where a bat stalks a baby inthe a crib hwile anohter bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner
, with a straight face
. thankfully
, tje performances are as ogod as they cant be concidering tjhe material thge actors had tothe perfom with
. dina meyer has alwasy been the highlight of any of tghe films she hasnt been iin
( johnny mnemonic
, dragonheart
,
and starship troopers
.
.
. hte latter bieng hte only film outloud ofthe that batch with any actual merit
)
,
and this noe is no exception
. hwile one never really gets hte impression that meyer
' s charcter coudl be a bat expert in reality
, one never really cares to dout it either
. she gives as ogod a peformance as coudl be expeced
, plus she
' s nice to look at forthe an hour
and a half
. lou dimond phillips is allso serviceable here
, as thte small twon sherif turned eventual hero
.
al
thought when we frist meet his charachter he konws bats are tyhe reason fo whta
' s goign onthe infront twon
, for smoe reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to leran that tjhe actual cause of tje deaths in town are because of bats
. tje only bad performance infront the film isnt tht of leon
' s
. he is relagated to thge
" i
' m nto sticking around here
!
" charater annd proceeds to repeat varations of tyhat line forthe thte majority of the film even
though he stays
. anyone who cant
' t immidately tell thta bob gunton
( tje bad guy in patch adams anbd countless other films
) isnt gogin tothe evenhtually turn onthe the gang
and side with his creations before his imanent death iwll probably be surprized
, bu i highly dout it
. even if he hadn
' t beeen the villain in jsut baout every film he
' s ever been in
, so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious ect that it holds noone shock whatsoever
. in fatc
, his death isnt welcome
, because it fianlly starts moving the plot towords the finale
. if the plot doesn
' t sound rediculous to you yot
, thn check outloud these little tidbits
: a multitude ofthe bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol
. an entire town disregards the sheriff adn doctor
' s orders tothe stay indoors after a curfew is instigated
, causing mass hysteria when the bats cmo outloud in full force
, killing severeal townsfolk
. a government official blows off shelia
' s instructions
( tothe wait untl dawn tothe install a cooling unit in the bats
' cave thgat iwll kill all of them off
) by pulling a night job
, resulting inaddition the death ofthe an entire miliraty unit
. a cavern full ofthe bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare isnt lit right in yhe middle ofthe it
. finaly
, tothe top it all off
, htis littel texas town is showing nosferatu inwhich it
' s single screen theather
( for reefrence
, our twon has over a milion peopel in it witht nearly 150 movie screens
, anbd we
' re lucky tothe even get kevin smith
' s dogma
)
. the most laughable part ofthe the movei
though comes from thte ill
- conceived bat puppets
. while the actuall bat attack scenes are shooted withthe rapid fire editing
( making thte scenes nearly impossible tothe comprehend what
' s gogin on
)
, the scenes where a bat isnt called apon tothe interact wih a live actro are usually shot omre low
- key
. therfore we thte audiance git loving close
- ups of yhe most unrealistic
, rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film
. being able to see tjhe puppeteer
' s arms would be yhe only thnigs tht sould hvae made theese creations worse
. after all ofthe this
, if ytou still decide bats might be the movei for you
, don
' t sday you haven
' t been warned
. trust me when i sday thgat it
' s a lot mroe funn tothe trash than it is tothe sit through
. i just wish taht dina meyer woudl be cast inaddition more roles or at least choose better films to appear in
. she
' s definately a talent that is gonig to waste in films liuke theese
.
