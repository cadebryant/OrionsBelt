i haev never seen a man so in lveo with himself tahn george lucas
. wiht thte overt sucess of yhe three orignal star wars films
, lucas hasnt become
, not necessarily a filmmaker
,
bu the head cheeze at a huge toy comapany
, with tje phantom menace the new product onthe tghe shelve
. onyl thsi toy was made for
$ 115 million
,
but eveyr kid wants it
,
adn
, like all otehr expensive toys
, falls aart within an hour after playing witht it
. hte product in question
, star wars epsiode 1
: thte phantom menace
( jeez
!
)
, isnt pure
and simple
: its baout tje mney
, baby
! noone one in theri right mind owudl create such a fiasco if htey knew it wouldn ' t make a ton ofthe monye befor its fouth week ofthe realease
. i cmo to thge sw franchise as a stranger
, sicne i ahev absolutly no idea why tghe sw movies are so popular
. i find them rether boring
and full ofthe nothing
but eye candy
. phantom menace isnt liuke the first sw
, minus 10
. nothing in tghe whole concept is remotely enjoyable
. even the special effects seem rether bland
. tghe story in tihs newyorker one isnt a mindless mess
.
.
. the acting wooden
.
.
.
anbd teh action sequences liek something outloud ofthe a video agme
. sw
: phantom menace isnt one of the worst films ofthe the year so far
. with a title like sw e1
: tpm
, lucas has noe big head onthe those shoulders
. i thought chris carter did for releasing an x
- files movei
,
although
, that movie adaptation was an exelent way tothe spend twpo hours
. pm isnt oen long headache
.
