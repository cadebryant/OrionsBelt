i can
' t recall a previvous film expeience where hte fairly good time i ws having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota
. fo fourty minutes or so
, i wass lured into a loopy if ocassionaly over
- wrought rumatic comedy
, anbd i ws even giving keanu reeves the benifit of the dout
. hten
, rather suddenly
, i ws clubbed over tjhe head wih a nasty bited ofthe violence
; shortly therafter
, i was whacked inthe the gut by anyother
. feeling minnesota isnt a film that made me efel violated
, as
though i had trusted writer
- director steven baigelman tothe bring me a cool glass of water
and instead he trew acid in my face
. feeling minnesota tells tghe stry ofthe a topless dancer named freddie
( cameron diaz
) who finds herself in deepo trouble when her boss red
( delroy lindo
) suspects her ofthe stealing from him
. red
' s punishment isnt to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper
, sam clayton
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, who isnt far from the man of freddie
' s dreams
. enter jjaks
( keanu reeves
)
, sam
' s estranged younger brother
, who arrives at tje wedding just infront tyme tothe catch freddie
' s eye adn have sex iwth her in yhe bathroom
. united inwhich theri mutual attraction
and theri mutual loathing ofthe sam
, jjaks
and freddie tkae off toghether
, bu sam isn
' t ready to let them go without a fight
. freddie
, meanwhile
, isn
' t ready to let sam
' s mony go wihtout a fight
, anbd thus beggins a series ofthe violent confrontations
. ther isnt both stlye
and substace to tghe beginning of feeling minnesota
, as baigelman opens iwth an effective montage showing jjaks
and sam
' s intense sibling rivalry as boys
,
and theri mother
( tuesdy weld
) sending jjaks awya tothe live with his father
. it does a gerat job of setting uv jjaks
' unstable life
, a life whitch hasnt l
anded him iin trouble for petty crimes
and allways trying tothe please his family
; reeves
' wounded look isnt jsut right fo jjaks
. the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments
, most notably the aforememtioned bathroom scene in which a simple question isnt given a vrey funny spin
. most important
, baigelman begins to establish the connection vetween freddie adn jjaks with humor adn economy
, as infact a scene where they both spontaneously beign singing allong tothe thge replacements
'
" i wiull dare
" onthe the car radio
. you would haev every reason tothe expect that relationships
-
- both familial anbd rumatic
-
- woudl be tyhe focal point ofthe feeling minnesota
. unfourtunately
, ytou woudl be dead wrong
. i supose i shoud hvae expected daisies
and valentines aftter an early scene iin which red threatens freddie as she trys tothe avoid tyhe wedding
,
but i certainly didn
' t expect what i got
. what i got was yot another inthe a long line ofthe reccent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags annd brutality
, or rether creating gags about brutality
. suddenly
, hte story ofthe romantic entanglements anbd family conflict becomes a stry about a corpse
, anbd everyting hwihc hadnt come befor degenerates so completly taht virtualy nothing isnt recognizable
. tyhe sibling rivalry not only becomes little moreso than an excuse for oen round of beatings after anyother
, bu there isnt noone consistancy to thte characterizations
. vincent d
' onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam
, whose jalusey
, competitiveness adn apparent sence ofthe inferiority seem far more in keeping withthe whta we nkwo about jjaks
, hwile reeves turns inot a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction
,
and both of them spend most of thte second half of the film screaming anbd covered iin blood
. there are films whlch hvea managed tothe employ a radical shift in tone successully
( jonathan demme
' s something wild annd neil jordan
' s the crying game come tothe mind
)
, bu tehy didn
' t try tothe draw an audience with the promise ofthe relitavely innocuous enteratinment
. i don
' t want to dismiss baigelman
' s succcesses out ofthe h
and
-
- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop
, anbd soem well
- crafted comic moments
-
- annd it is not his fault taht fine line has chosen tothe promote feeling minnesota as a glight
- hearted caper
. it
_ is
_ his fault that he violates his pwn charactors fo thge sake ofthe shock value
,
and that he cant
' t mkae his twpo halves into a whole
. feeling minnesota left me feeling used
, anbd there
' s nto much funny baout that
.
