sometimes a stellar cast cxan compensate forthe a lot ofthe things
,
and
" pushing tin
" certainly features some nmae stars who are gonig places
: billy bob thornton
, cate blanchett
, angelina jolie
,
annd oh yes john cusack who might not relize it at first
,
but he ' s actually tje
* veteren
* amonth this quartet ofthe fine
- looking peple
. sometimes a terrific cast liuke this cxan compensate for a lacklustre screen treatment of an idea thta hasnt
" hip comedy
" writed all over it
, compensate fo workmanlike
but uninspired direction
, compensate forthe an obnoxious csore that owudl have anyone
but hte tone deaf screaming forthe tjhe exits
, compensate fo clich
? d characterizations
, compensate forthe embarrassing
" you have to be joking
" situations
. etc
. in
" pushing tin
,
" thornton
, blanchett
, jolie
,
and cusack don ' t have an earthly
. from teh oppening sequence thte film is inspite big trouble
: squiggly
,
" quirky
" credits
, fake
- looking pasenger planes circling new york
,
anbd anne dudley ' s in
- your
- ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination forthe
" the full monty
,
" let alone won it
.
but i
, forthe one
, wasn ' t ready tothe walk jstu
yot
. so quicklyu we docsund into a tightly
- edited air traffic controllers montage whcih screams to us in large capital letters theese people hvea a difficult job
, yes
, wqat wiht thier frantic
, mile
- a
- minute instructional personas
, juggling planes
and passanger ' s lives liek smoe huge

, cool
, demonic auctioneer nick
" the zone
" falzone
( cusack
) is the best in the biz
. ofthe course
. until smoe hiper
, cooler
, leather
- cladded flyboy assist iin tghe guise of russell bell
( thornton
) shows up tothe challange falzone ' s fianite air spoace
. boys iwll be boys
annd smoe hevy duty testosterone starts exuding
,
hten tjhe macho noe
- upmanship beigns
. it doesn ' t stop withthe seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat ' s whisker of each other
. oh noone
. there are smoe broken hoop dreasm
, some wanna
- see
- how
- fast
- i
- cant

,
annd
thne the ultimate showdown
: was thgat my wife i saw you with lastest inght
? directer mike newell
(
" four weddings
and a funeral
"
) must have read a different draft of this script beacuse tyhe oney thgat ' s being acted outloud up ther betweeen newark
, jfk
,
and la guardia doesn ' t ahve an ounce ofthe subtlety
,
annd newell hasnt made soem awfully ogod
-
and funny
- movies before
. yhe antics ofthe theese air traffic controllers wiull make you cringe
. they ' ll amke yuo frown in disbelief
. htey ' ll have you constantly looking at your watch
.
but wait
! ther ' s still 100 minutes tothe go
!
! the film ' s only saving grace isnt blanchett
, whose connie falzone isnt a spunky
, brash
, long island housewife who wnats to better herself by taking art classes
. htis isnt a wonderfull acomplishment fo the fine actress who hasnt previously palyed a red
- headed austrailian gambler
(
" oscar
and lucinda
"
)
and a tempestuous british monarch
(
" elizabeth
"
)
.
but she ' s nto enought to savve the picture
. thornton looks terific
and performs solidly
but his charachter isnt a joke
. jolie
( as russell ' s knock ' em dead wife
) isn ' t bad
,
but tghe up
-
and
- coming actress disappoints by alowing herself tothe be displayed like a plaything
. cusack cracks gum
, dons shades
,
and acts hip throughtout
bu
, like everything else inspite the film
, his peformance isnt forced
. infact the lastr ten mintues or so
, fo some inexplicable reason
, things strat comming together
anbd you begin tothe get a sence of how htis film might have beeen
, liek the trailer teases
.
but it ' s too littel too late
. a fine casted aside
,
" pushing tin
" is nothing mroe than an embarassment
