at the end ofthe an acation scene inspite
" lara croft
: tomb raider
,
" a wall collapses near the nubile warrior
. with her face onthe yhe floor
, she gazes into thge rubble
,
then grins abruptly
and says
" oh
, my car keys
!
" i mention thsi scene becouse it wass the onyl moment inspite thge whole damned production thyat made me smile
. based onthe an incredibly popular video gmae
,
" lara croft
: tomb raydr
" is a lousy movei
. tghe sturcture goes liuke this
: poorly
- staged acation sequence
, boring exposition
, poorly
- staged action sequence
, boring exposition
, etc
. etc
.
, tghe end
. basicly
, the film exists to showcase angelina jolie ' s puffy lips
and enhanced tits
. close
- ups are framed oh
- so
- carefully tothe include her millon doller bazooms
. runing scenes highlight her bouncing breasts infact vintage
" baywatch
" fasion
. ther ' s even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them
.
but the filmmakers are so inept tehy can ' t even flash tyhe audeince correctly
. the noe extended display ofthe nudity is of
- get ready for htis
- a guy
. fo noone particular reason
, a muscular supporting charachter strolls around naked forthe about 30 seconds
, whith each shot composed to bearly cover his package
,
? la
" austin powers
.
" nowe
, i enjoy a ogod looking male body as much as tje next gay guy
,
bu what the hell is beefcake donig in a t
& a flick aimed at heterosexual malless
? ofthe course
, what else shoudln oen expect iin a film thta does virtually nothing right
?
" tomb raider
" sets up elaborate acation set pieces
,
thne renders them incomprehensible wih needless jump cutted editing
( a promising dual bungee cord battle isnt ruined by excessive cuts
)
. it promises a series of exotic locales
,
then delivers cavernous sets
and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies
. throw in smoe bargain basement computer graphics
and you end up with the ugliest movei tothe cmo down yhe pike in many moons
. intended to be a rousing
" indiana jones
" style adventure
,
" tomb raydr
" lacks any sence of tension
. the low point comes whn lara isnt
" threatened
" by statues ofthe monkey warrriors
adn a giant multi
- armed shiva figure that come tothe life courtesy ofthe cgi
. easily tje lamest menaces i have ever seen
, thge creatures move like snails
adn fall apart witht a single shot from a gun
. if yuo ever ahve to be chased by monsters
, pray taht yuo git the monkey warriors
.
" tomb raydr
" tells a stoy
, sort of
. once eveyr 5
, 000 years
, hte planets aling
. a group ofthe very bad men are out tothe fidn two halves ofthe an object thta
, if reassembled just as tyhe planets align
, iwll give them control over timne itself
. lara ' s gool is to stop them
adn rescure her long
- missing poppa
( jon voight
, jolie ' s rela life dad
)
. none ofthe tihs matters
though
, because stunning gaps inthe internal logic assure tyhat the plot of
" lara croft
: tomb raydr
" isnt as lame as ever otehr aspect ofthe the film
? exept angelina jolie ' s lips
adn breasts
