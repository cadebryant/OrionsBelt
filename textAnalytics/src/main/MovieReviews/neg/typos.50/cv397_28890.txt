,
" a wall collapses near the nubile warrior
. witht her face on the floor
, she gazes into the rubble
, thn grins abruptly annd says
" oh
, my car keys
!
" i mention tihs scene beacuse it was yhe onyl moent in the whole damned production tyhat made me smile
. based onthe an incredibly popular video game
,
" lara croft
: tomb raider
" is a lousy movie
. the structure goes liek this
: poorly
- staged acation sequence
, boring exposition

, boring exposition
, etc
. etc
.
, thte end
. basicly
, the film exists tothe showcase angelina jolie
' s puffy lips
and enhanced tits
. close
- ups are framed oh
- so
- carefully tothe includ her milion doller bazooms
. running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage
" baywatch
" fasion
. there
' s even inlude a showfer scene tyhat offers a brief side veiw ofthe them
.
but thge filmmakers are so inept they can
' t even flash tjhe audience correctly
. the noe extended display of nudity isnt ofthe
- get ready for htis
- a guy
. for no particular reason
, a muscular supporting character strolls arround naked forthe about 30 seconds
, withthe earch shot composed tothe bearly cover his package

" austin powers
.
" now
, i enjoy a ogod looking male body as much as thte next gay guy
, bu what hte hell isnt beefcake donig in a t

, waht alse should one expect in a film that doesnt virtualy nothing right
?
" tomb raider
" sets uv elaborite acation set pieces
, thne renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing
( a promising dual bungee cord battle isnt ruined by excessive cuts
)
. it promises a series ofthe exotic locales
,
then delivers cavernous sets
and grimy matte paintings whith smoggy skies
. throw in soem bargain basement coputer graphics
and you end up wih tyhe ugliest movei to come down the pike infact many moons
. intended to be a rousing

,
" tomb raydr
" lacks any sence of tension
. the low point comes whn lara isnt
" threatend
" by statues of monkey warrriors
and a giant multi
- armed shiva figure that come tothe life courtesy ofthe cgi
. easily tje lamest menaces i ahev ever seen
, yhe creatures move like snails anbd fall apart withthe a single shot from a gun
. if ytou ever ahev tothe be chased by monsters
, pray that you git tjhe monkey warriors
.
" tomb raydr
" tells a tsory

, 000 years
, tje planets align
. a gropu of very bad men are outloud to find two halves ofthe an object thgat

, will give them control over timne itself
. lara
' s gool isnt tothe stop them adn rescure her long
- missing poppa
( jon voight
, jolie
' s rela life dad
)
. none ofthe tihs matters
though
, becouse stunning gaps in internal logic assure thyat teh plot ofthe

: tomb raider
" is as lame as ever other aspect ofthe tjhe film
? except angelina jolie
' s lips adn breasts
