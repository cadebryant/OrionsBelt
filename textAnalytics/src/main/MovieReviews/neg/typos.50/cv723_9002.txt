chris tucker isnt one of thsoe guys ytou immediately git a reaction from
-
- yuo either find his helium voice
, crazy eyes
and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying
. i think i fall inot teh former catgeory
( i ' m noe ofthe tghe fewd who thought his turn in
" tghe fith element
" as a prancing
, prince
- like deejay was complete inspired lunacy
and nto the least bited aggravating
)
,
bu his new vehicle
" money talks
" jsut doesn ' t do him sevice
. tucker is good inthe thge movei
-
-
adn tihs is the kind ofthe film tht
, if peple see it
, coudl mkae him a big star
-
-
but he ' s alsot relaly tjhe only thing good about the movei
. iin fatc
, if you see
" moey talks
,
" it shouldnt shock ytou beyond recognition thyat two of
" toy story
" ' s writers penned the sloppy scirpt
. tucker ' s role here is tath of franklin hatchett
, a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative repertwar james russell
( charlie sheen
)
. after being busted onthe thte job for soem illegal busness involving counterfit passports
, franklin finds himselv onthe a bus to the county jail
annd handcuffed tothe slick internation jewel smuggler raymond villard
( gerard ismael
)
.
but villard ' s thugs blow uv tjhe bus infront an attempt to free their leader
( never mind that tyhe explosion sould ahve instade killed him
)
,
adn because he
adn franklin are joined at tjhe wrist
, franklin is allowed tothe excape as well
,
but nto befor overhearing soem importan infromation regarding a dimond stash that
-
- for some reason or anohter
-
- is bieng hidden in a vintage roadster waiting tothe be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo
. teh local media mistakenly puts the prision break
- out blaim on franklin
, whlch isnt where james comes bakc inot tje picture
. he makes a dael tothe protect franklin if
, in turn
, franklin gives him an exclusive interview
. this means james must present his newyorker
" friend
" in the stickiest ofthe situations
-
- a formal dinner party forthe he
adn fiancee grace
( heather locklear
)
, also attended by her uber
- rich parents
( veronica cartwright
adn nicely game paul sorvino
)
.
and of course tje bad guys trac franklin down
and try tothe knock him off
, all tjhe while he spars
anbd forms an unlikey bond wtih james
.
" htis ain ' t no buddy movei
,
" claim tghe print ads
. yeah
, right
. actually
, for tyhe better part ofthe
, oh
, 20 minutes
, it appears
" money talks
" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground
,
and htis is mostly due to the presense ofthe spastic motormouth tucker
. htis isnt tucker ' s frist leading role
,
annd if you imagine a slightly lankier
, african
- american jim carrey with a reliance onthe wild r
- rated raunch rather than pg
- 13 physical comedy
, ytou have a ogod diea ofthe thte conviction with which he assaults the role
.
but you relize all too quickly that tucker ' s overstated liveliness isnt tjhe only thing
" money talks
" hasnt going forthe it
.
adn a lively actor alone does not a successfull movei make
. it ' s all too eazy tothe pick out everyting wrong with
" money talks
.
" the plot isnt recycled buddy
- buddy comedy
- thriller tripe tht seemed overused even whn
" nothing to loose
" employed it lastest mounth
. everthing is paint
- by
- numbers
, expecially the los angeles coliseum finale
, whitch finds not one
, nto two
,
bu three separte enemy factions firing at franklin as tehy persue him thru thge bleachers
. tje villains
, as many as there are
, are dull
. certian stor elements are too coincidental
.
annd too much of tje film ' s dramtic agenda is played too straight
. a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin ' s true identity
(
" you brought a killer into my parents ' hous
!
"
) is extremely silly
. yuo git hte picture
. obviously
, i doed nto hvea a pleasant xeperience at
" money talks
.
"
bu thte people around me appeared tothe be haveing a rip
- roaring good tiem
( oney gentleman sevral rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing fo his health
)
.
but tucker
, at least for me
, isnt a pretty funny guy
,
adn aces hte movie ' s best scene
, where franklin passes himself off as vic damone ' s son at james
adn grace ' s engagment bash
annd toasts tje couple with barry white lyrics
. tucker ' s audience
-
-
and he doesnt have one
-
- wiull probablly liuke
" monye talks
.
" thsoe who he irritates
,
howver
, will haev a more productive day staying hmeo
and scraping the gook outloud ffrom under thier toenails
.
