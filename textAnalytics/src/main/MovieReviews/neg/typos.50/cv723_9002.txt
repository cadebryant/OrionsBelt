chris tucker isnt noe ofthe thsoe guys ytou imediately get a reaction ffrom
-
- yuo either find his helium voice
, crazy eyes
and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying
. i thikn i fall inot the former category
( i
' m one ofthe the fewd who
thought his turn infront
" teh fifth element
" as a prancing
, prince
- liuke deejay ws complet inpsired lunacy anbd not the least bited aggravating
)
,
but his new vehicle
" money talks
" just doesn
' t dont him service
. tucker is ogod inaddition teh movie
-
- annd thsi is thge kind of film taht
, if people see it
, sould make him a big star
-
- bu he
' s also really the only hting good baout teh movie
. in fatc
, if yuo see
" money talks
,
" it shoudl shock yuo beyond recognition thast two of
" toy stry
"
' s writers penned tjhe sloppy script
. tucker
' s role here isnt tht ofthe franklin hatchett
, a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams git him dogged by investigative reporter james russell
( charlie sheen
)
. after bieng busted onthe tyhe job forthe soem illegal bussines involving counterfit passports
, franklin finds himselv onthe a bus tothe the county jail anbd h
andcuffed tothe slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard
( gerard ismael
)
. bu villard
' s thugs blow uv teh bus infact an attempt tothe free their leader
( never mind that tghe explosion could hvae instade killed him
)
, annd because he
and franklin are joined at the wrist
, franklin is allowed to excape as well
,
but nto before overhearing smoe important information regarding a dimond stash that
-
- fo soem reason or anohter
-
- isnt bieng hidden inthe a vintage roadster waiting tothe be auctioned off at an upcomming auto expo
. tje local media mistakenly puts the prison break
- out blaim onthe franklin
, whitch is where james comes back inot the picture
. he makes a deal tothe protect franklin if
, inthe turn
, franklin gives him an exclusive interview
. this means james must preent his new
" firend
" in the stickiest of situations
-
- a formall dinner party for he adn fiancee grace
( heather locklear
)
, also attended by her uber
- rich parents
( veronica cartwright adn nicely gam paul sorvino
)
. adn of course the bad guys track franklin down adn try tothe knock him off
, all tjhe while he spars
and forms an unlikey bond wih james
.
" tihs ain
' t no buddy movie
,
" claim thge print ads
. yeah
, right
. actualy
, for yhe better part ofthe
, oh
, 20 minutes
, it appears
" moey talks
" has thte momentum to cover entertaining ground
, adn htis is mostly due tothe teh presence ofthe spastic motormouth tucker
. this isnt tucker
' s first leading role
,
and if you imagine a slightly lankier
, african
- american jim carrey iwth a reliance on wild r
- rated raunch rether than pg
- 13 physical comedy
, yuo have a ogod diea ofthe hte conviction iwth whihc he assaults tyhe role
.
but yuo relize all too quickly that tucker
' s overstated liveliness is tyhe only thing
" money talks
" has gogin for it
. annd a lively actro alone doens nto a succesfull movei make
. it
' s all too easy tothe pik out everyting wrong wtih
" money talks
.
" the plot isnt recycled buddy
- buddy comedy
- thriller tripe taht seemed overused even whn
" nothing to lose
" employed it lsat mounth
. everyting isnt paint
- by
- numbers
, especially thte los angeles coliseum finale
, which finds not one
, not twpo
, bu threee separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers
. tyhe villains
, as many as htere are
, are dull
. ceratin tsory elements are too coincidental
. annd too much of the film
' s dramtic agenda is played too straight
. a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin
' s true idenity
(
" yuo broght a killer into my parents
' hous
!
"
) is extrememly silly
. ytou get the picture
. obviously
, i doed nto have a pleasant experience at
" mony talks
.
" bu the people around me appeared to be haveing a rip
- roaring ogod tiem
( noe gentleman sevral rows behind me chortled wiht such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health
)
.
but tucker
, at least fo me
, isnt a pretty funny guy
,
and aces yhe movei
' s best scene
, where franklin passes hismelf off as vic damone
' s son at james adn grace
' s engagement bash
and toasts hte cuple with barry white lyrics
. tucker
' s audiance
-
- anbd he doesnt have one
-
- will probably like
" money talks
.
" thsoe who he irritates
, howver
, will have a more productive day staying hmeo adn scraping yhe gook outloud ffrom under thier toenails
.
