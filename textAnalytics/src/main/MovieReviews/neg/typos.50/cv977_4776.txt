" suposed
.
" four ofthe tje biggest directors inwhich hollywood
: quentin tarantino
, robert rodriguez
, alex
ander rockwell
,
and alison
anders weere all directing one big film with a big
and popular casted
. i guess it ws all jstu too much beacuse this turned outloud to be thte biggest flop ofthe the yera anbd it coudl of beeen graet
. the plot
: it
' s new yeras eve
and it
' s a bellboy
' s frist day on thte job
. he encounters many mysterous
and kinky hotel guests as he trys tothe h
andle all his own problems
. tarantino told his directors htis plot
,
and each ofthe them wrote a script
. it turned out eahc of them had writen a dark comedy
.
anders wrote anbd directed tghe tale about a coven ofthe witchs
( madonna
, valeria golino
, alicia witt
, annd ione skye
)
, whcih was the worst one out ofthe all ofthe them
. the second room
( jennifer beals
) was better
,
but lacking inaddition plot
. htis room was about a man who accuses every man ofthe sleeping wih his wief
. the third room
( antonio b
anderas
) wass the best roomm
, baout twpo rambunctous kids thta trash a hotel suite
. tjhe fianl oen
( tarantino
, willis
) was about a movei star wanting the bellboy tothe chop off someone
' s finger
. the movie ws just plain trash
. there ws nothing here thgat even makes uv a quality film
. it wass not funny
, adn i didn
' t hear one laff in tghe theather
thoughout hte hwole film
. tim roth isnt horrable as the bumbling
and mumbling bellboy
, anbd he ruins eveyr joke inaddition thte film
. tyhe supporting casted loses meaninng to the word suppost annd the only mentionable actors
/ actresses are antonio b
anderas
and jennifer beals
. marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role
. this movie isnt the worst film ofthe the yera
and tjhe film sould have been grat
, perhaps liek a more upbeat
" plaza suie
