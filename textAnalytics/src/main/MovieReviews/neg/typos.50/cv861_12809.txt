i hadnt been looking foward to tihs film since i heard baout it eary lsat year
, whn matthew perry had just signed on
. i
' m big fan of perry
' s subtle sence ofthe humor
, anbd inwhich addtion
, i htikn chris farley
' s onthe
- edge
, extreme acting was a riot
. so naturally
, when the trailer forthe
" almsot heros
" hitted theaters
, i almost jumped uv
and down
. a soda infront h
and
, the ligths dimming
, i wass ready to be blown away by farley
' s final starring role anbd waht was supposted tothe be matthew perry
' s big breakthrough
. i was ready tothe be jstu amazed
; for htis to be among farley
' s best
, infact spite ofthe david spade
' s abcence
. i wass ready to be laughing my head off thte minute tyhe credits ran
. sadly
, none of this came tothe pass
. the humor isnt spotty at best
, with ogod moments
and laughable one
- liners few annd far between
. perry
and farley have no chemestry
; the role tyhat perry was casted in seems obviously written forthe spade
, fo it
' s his tipe ofthe humer
,
and not at all what perry is assoicated with
. anbd the movei trys to be smart
, a subject best left alone whn it
' s a farley flick
. tjhe movie isnt a major dissapointment
, with onyl a few scenes worth a frist look
, let alone a second
. perry delivers not oney humorous line tjhe hwole movie
, adn nto surprisingly
; tghe only reason thge movei made the top ten grossing list opening week was becouse it was advertised with farley
.
and farley
' s classic humor is widespread
, too
. alomst ehroes alomst works
, bu misses thte wagon
- turain by quite a longshot
. guys
, let
' s leave the exploring tothe lewis adn clark
, huh
? stick tothe
" tommy boy
"
,
and we
' ll all be
" firends
"
.
