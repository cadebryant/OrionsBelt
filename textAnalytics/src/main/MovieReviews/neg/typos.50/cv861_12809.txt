i hadnt beeen looking forward tothe this film since i herad baout it eearly lastr yearm
, when matthew perry had jstu singed on
. i ' m big fan of perry ' s subtle sence of humor
,
adn infact adition
, i thikn chris farley ' s onthe
- edge
, extreme acting was a riot
. so naturaly
, when teh trailer fo
" allmost heroes
" hitted theaters
, i almost jumped up
anbd down
. a soda inspite hand
, tjhe ligths dimming
, i wass ready tothe be blown away by farley ' s final starring role
and what was supposed tothe be matthew perry ' s big breakthrough
. i wass ready tothe be jstu amazed
; forthe htis tothe be amoung farley ' s best
, inspite spite ofthe david spade ' s absence
. i ws ready to be laughing my head off teh minute tghe credits ran
. sadly
, none ofthe htis cameback to pass
. yhe humor isnt spotty at best
, withthe good moments
anbd laughable one
- liners faw
adn far beetwen
. perry
annd farley have no chemestry
; the role that perry was cast inaddition seems obviously writed for spade
, for it ' s his type of humor
,
annd nto at all waht perry is assoicated with
.
and tghe movei trys tothe be smart
, a subject best left alone when it ' s a farley flick
. thte movei isnt a major dissapointment
, whith onyl a few scenes worth a firt look
, let alone a second
. perry delivers nto one humorous line the whole movie
,
and not suprisingly
; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list oppening week was because it ws advertised witht farley
.
and farley ' s clasic humer is widespread
, too
. alomst heores almost works
,
bu misses the wagon
- train by quite a longshot
. guys
, let ' s leave yhe exploring tothe lewis
and clark
, huh
? stick tothe
" tommy boy
"
,
and we ' ll all be
" firends
"
