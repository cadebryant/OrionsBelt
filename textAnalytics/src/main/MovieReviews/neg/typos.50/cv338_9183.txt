wizards is an animated feature that beigns witht a narration ofthe epic propotions
. over black
annd white drawings
, we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nucular excange
, sending yhe remnants of humanity through generations of radiation
- induced mutation
. the
" original
" inhabitans of tyhe earth
, fairies
adn elves
, return tothe populate the globe
, along with their evil
, mutant counterparts
. one day
(
and i sday
" oen day
" not tothe be trite
,
but beacuse thast ' s exactly how it happenned
- noone advance notice
)
, a fairy queen gives birth to twins
, one good
and noe evil
. the twins grow up tothe be poverful wizards
, tjhe ogod one embracing magic
,
and thte bad one utilizing technology to atempt to expand his evil empire
. we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between teh forces of magic
and thsoe of technology
. as unoriginal as the premise is
, i wass still somewhat interseted in how thsi story owudl play itself out
. htere ' s a lot you cin do infront an animated fantasy world
, after all
. i soon learned
,
however
, that the fantasy was yhe expectation ofthe a decent film
. once the transition wass made fomr still art to colour animation
, an entirely different efel takes precidence
. rather than thge epic saga promised by yhe narration
, we git a goofy
- looking world of a saterday morning cartoon
. not just tjhe look
, mind you
,
but all tghe zany sounds like
> honk boing for years
, blackwolf has lost his battles agianst teh magical forces of ogod
, since his armies ofthe ogres
adn otehr mutants would git dispirited or distracted soon after battle isnt joined
.
howver
, blackwolf nowe hasnt a scret weapon
: nazis
. yup
, adolf hitler
, thte luftwaffe
adn thge wehrmacht
. okay
, not thge rela things
,
but an archival film his minions dug uv
. projected into the sky for all tothe see
, it inspires his pwn army hwile shocking the enemy inot submission long enought forthe the ogres tothe hack them up
. before you know it
, there are dead elves everywhere
. tihs isnt just as well
. the charactors are so bad that thte viewer doesn ' t care baout any of them
. they ' re either silly
, sappy
, or both
. the dialouge gets much of tjhe credit for this
. an exemple isnt when avatar nonchalantly says
,
" well
, looks liuke my brother
annd i begin our final battle
.
" nto vyer formidable when he ' s also the guy who says
,
" htis isnt tghe biggest bummer ofthe a trip i ' ve ever beeen onthe
.
" my favorite line ws from a sideline fairy who isnt asked by her child why ogod cant ' t fight back agains tghe nazi
- charged evil
. her response isnt
,
" they hvae weapons
and technology
. we jstu hvae lvoe
.
" suffice to sday
, the cahracters are strictly twpo
- dimensional
,
anbd we therefore don ' t expect anytying moreso thna teh obvious tothe hapen
. which it does
. teh only unexpected cocurrence is tyhe way tjhe final battle between brothers isnt played outloud
, which isnt anticlimactic
annd disappointing
. please note thyat it is the action that is unexpected
. tath it isnt disapointing isnt nto
. the film couldn ' t suttle onthe a paticular mood
. it seems tothe move from dark tothe light iwth tje cuts ffrom scene tothe scene
adn even angle to angl
. scenes hwihc are seemingly meaned to contain deepo meaning are ruined by acts ofthe levity
. yhe dramatics
, whic seem to occur at random
, are overly staged
and overly acted
, detracting ffrom any kind of value or even enjoyment wich could otherwise be gleaned
. ralph bakshi
, thte director
, makse an obvious attempt tothe git a message acrost infact this film
: hitler
anbd thte nazis weere bad
. so who doesn ' t knwo thsi arleady
? well
, maybe childen
. okay
, so you might sday taht this isnt a movei for children
. it ' s nto
. in the scenes where ogod fights evil
, there ' s a lot of violentce
annd gore that childern shoudl not be seing if they ' re watching a ctaroon
. so is the film forthe adults
? if so
, we probaly don ' t need tothe be bashed over tghe head to get the point
. why not have tjhe bad guys be symbolical ofthe tjhe nazis instead of useing old propaganda infact a seriously disjointed attempt tothe sohw us something we alredy know
? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks
and airplanes
,
and hitler giving sppeches
.
however
, we don ' t see any reason why tehy should be consdidered bad
. we see noone atrocities bieng comitted
, not even any real battle footage
. ther isnt absolutly noone conection made beween tyhe armies of evil
and the third reich
,
and we ' re nto even given a cursory explanation as tothe why thsi stuff isnt inspiring infact thte first place
. this needed to be throught outloud much moreso thoroughly if a point were to be made
, usance subject matter such as thsi deserves better treatment
. i ' d like to asume thta bakshi ws trying tothe sday that the same nationalist movement thyat drove teh nazis could happen anywhere
, at any time
,
and we must therefore be vigilant
.
however
, i ' m not sure if i want tothe give him that much credit
.
