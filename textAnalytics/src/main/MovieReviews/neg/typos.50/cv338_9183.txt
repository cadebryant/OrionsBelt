wizards isnt an animated feature that beigns with a narration of epic propotions
. over balck annd white drawings
, we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear excange
, sending thge remnants of humanity through generations of radiation
- induced mutation
. thte
" origional
" inhabitants ofthe the earth
, fairies anbd elves
, return tothe populate the globe
, allong withthe their evil
, mutant counterparts
. noe day
( adn i sday
" one day
" nto tothe be trite
, bu because tath
' s exactly how it happened
- no advance notice
)
, a fairy queen gives birth tothe twins
, one ogod anbd noe evil
. the twins grwo uv tothe be poverful wizards
, the ogod one embracing magic
,
and thte bad oen utilizing technnology to attempt tothe exp
and his evil empire
. we are given the notion that an ulitmate battle must occurr betwen tghe forces ofthe magic adn thsoe ofthe technnology
. as unoriginal as the premise isnt
, i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out
. there
' s a lot yuo cant do infront an animated fantasy world
, aftter all
. i soon learned
, howver
, that the fantasy ws the expectation ofthe a decent film
. once teh transistion was made from still art tothe color animation
, an entirely differnt fiel tkaes precedence
. rether than thte epic saga promised by thge narration
, we get a goofy
- looking world ofthe a saturday morning ctaroon
. not jsut teh look
, mind yuo
,
but all tjhe zany sounds liek
> honk boing forthe years
, blackwolf hasnt lost his battles agains the magical forces ofthe good
, since his armies of ogres
and other mutants woudl git dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined
.
however
, blackwolf nowe hasnt a secret weppon
: nazis
. yup
, adolf hitler
, tyhe luftwaffe
and the wehrmacht
. okay
, not the real thigns
, bu an archival film his minions dug up
. projected into the sky forthe all tothe see
, it inspires his pwn army while shocking tyhe enemy inot submission long anough forthe thge ogres to hack them up
. befor yuo know it
, there are dead elves everywhere
. thsi is just as well
. the charachters are so bad tyhat the viewer doesn
' t care about any of them
. they
' re eather silly
, sappy
, or both
. teh dialog gets much ofthe tje credit fo this
. an example isnt whn avatar nonchalantly sasy
,
" well
, looks liek my brother anbd i beign our final battle
.
" nto veyr formidible when he
' s also tyhe guy who says
,
" this isnt teh biggest bummer ofthe a trip i
' ve ever beeen on
.
" my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why ogod can
' t fight bakc against teh nazi
- charged evil
. her response isnt
,
" they hvea weapons
and technology
. we jstu have love
.
" suffice tothe say
, teh charachters are strikely two
- dimentional
,
and we therefore don
' t expect anytying moreso than the obvious tothe happen
. which it does
. thge onyl unexpected occurrence is hte way yhe fianl battle beween brothers isnt plyed out
, whitch is anticlimactic anbd disappointing
. please onot taht it isnt tghe acation that is unexpected
. that it is disappointing is nto
. the film couldn
' t suttle on a particular mood
. it seems tothe move ffrom dark tothe glight wtih yhe cuts fomr scene tothe scene
and even angle tothe angl
. scenes whlch are seemingly meant to contain deep meaninng are ruined by acts of levity
. tyhe dramatics
, which seem to occur at r
andom
, are overly staged
and overly acted
, detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned
. ralph bakshi
, the director
, makes an obvious attemp to get a message across inthe tihs film
: hitler annd thge nazis weere bad
. so who doesn
' t konw thsi arleady
? well
, mabey childrens
. okay
, so yuo might say thast this isnt a movie forthe childen
. it
' s nto
. in tjhe scenes where ogod fights evil
, htere
' s a lot ofthe violence anbd gore thgat children shouldnt nto be seeing if they
' re watching a ctaroon
. so isnt thte film fo adults
? if so
, we probaly don
' t ened to be bashed over yhe head to git the point
. why not ahev yhe bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instade of using ood propag
anda inaddition a seriously disjointed atempt tothe show us something we already know
? wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks annd airplanes
, annd hitler giving speeches
. howver
, we don
' t see any reason why htey should be consdiered bad
. we see no atrocities bieng commitetd
, nto even any real battle footage
. there isnt absolutely noone conection made between tje armies ofthe evil adn the thrid reich
,
and we
' re nto even given a cursory explanation as tothe why this stuff isnt inspiring in thte first place
. htis needed tothe be
thought out much moreso thouroughly if a point weere tothe be made
, since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment
. i
' d liek tothe asume tath bakshi wass trying to sday tht the smae nationalist govement that drove the nazis coudl happen anyhwere
, at any timne
,
and we must therefore be vigilant
. howver
, i
' m not sure if i watn to give him that much credit
.
