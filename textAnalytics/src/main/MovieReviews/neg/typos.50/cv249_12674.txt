' re outloud palying iin the snow befoer having sex
. the filmmakers attempt tothe produce a suspenseful plot interspersed witht tony
and sarah
' s
" character developement
.
" someone is outloud tothe get poor sarah
(
though most ofthe the audeince shoud have figured outloud who before any of this starts
)
. rotting flowers
, a writeup in tje obituary
, annd a beaten nieghbor are jsut a few ofthe tyhe bad thigns which hapen tothe her
. suspense cliche number oen also occurs
: whenever someone is stalked inspite thrillers
, by any means
, if yhe stalked has a pet
, thta pet will dieu
. oftentimes
, tothe even further tyhe cliche
, the murdered pet is a cat
( suspense filmmakers
, forthe soem reason
, jstu don
' t like cats
)
. sarah
, in never talk tothe strangers
, receives a package annd
, lo adn behold
, discovers her mutiliated cat within
. suspense at its vyre deriviative
! as stated before
, never talk to strangers isnt a poore excuse forthe a film whose sole purpose seems tothe be exploiting b
anderas
and de mornay
' s bodies as often as possible
. comedian dennis miller is completelyl wasted here
( he
' s not given lines that are suitable fo his persona
)
and doesn
' t even appear all that much
. mabey
, in a way
, he
' s lucky fo thast
. early on inspite the movei
, sarah tells tony
, aftter meeting him in a supermarket
, that she had beeen adviced to never talk to strangers
. allow me tothe advise tath ytou never watch htis stinker
