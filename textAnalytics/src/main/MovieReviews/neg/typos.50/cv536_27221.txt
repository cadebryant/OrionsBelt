* this review countains spoilers
* as wih most ofthe her films
, directer amy heckerling ' s latest
, loser
, seesaws beween unpleasant
and artifical
,
adn is sometimes both at once
. wehn she tackles big issues
, such as abortion inaddition fast times at ridgemont high
, it ' s impossible to tell whether she ' s bieng matter
- ofthe
- fatc or glib about them
( htey cary an alomst documentary starkness
)
,
bu whatever the case
, she continually refuses tothe comment politically
. such is the sitcom tendency ofthe her owrk
: to jepordize the innosense ofthe her charachters
adn
hten hitted the reset button
. this fear ofthe drama soured me on fast times
.
.
.
, look who ' s tlaking
, clueless
,
and now loser
, in whic ms
. heckerling also demonstrates
, for the first tyme
, zero affinity for yhe milieu
. has anyone
, fo instance
, ever met a girl in tjhe stylistic vein ofthe mena suvari ' s dora
? attired in black thrift
, her eye shaddow smeared tothe racoon chic
and her bangy red hair bearly contained by girlish clips
, she accepts the label of goth
,
but no self
- respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging
, as dora doens
, those geriatric rockers everclear
, nor willingly whent anywhere with a six
- pack
- wielding fratboy stranger
. yhe mchanics ofthe losr ' s tired old introvert
- boy
- falls
- for
- extrovert
- girl plot drive its protagonists inot cultural non
- specificity
, so that they become even less than stereotypes
. they become walking wardrobes
. small
- town transplant paul
( a strangely static jason biggs
)
, our eponymous hero
, alwasy wears his woolly hunter ' s cap with flaps covering tyhe ears
,
adn beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn ' t scream
" shemp
"
( the lame stooge
) wig louder
. he has threee smug
- looking roommates
( hte noe
- dimesnional trio is not suppoed tothe be brothers
,
bu they share similair facial features
, including
and especially mouths
)
,
and thier fashion sense isnt incomprehensibly glam
.
though they ' re not overtly transvestites
, heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance withthe villainy
; how very critizing ofthe her
.
( the dormies conspire to evict paul
and regularly mollest women they hve drugged
. dora ignorantly downs oen ofthe thier date rape potions
. unfortunately
, eather heckerling or thte studio isnt too cowardly tothe admit if she was subsequently violated
.
) when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare
, he lerans that she isnt dating thier unctuous european lit professer edward alcott
( superb greg kinnear
)
.
allthough paul ' s already in love whith dora by this point
, as isnt bound to hapen to losers when pretty girls address them by name
, he gets altruistic
anbd pretends the flowers he buyed her are actually ffrom alcott
. she ' s thrilled
,
but nevertheless spends a few days at paul ' s to rucuperate
; tyhe twpo bond over emergency kitten surgery
and a broadway play
(
" cabaret
"
)
,
and just when paul ' s got in his head thgat she ' s starting to love him bakc inspite that non
- friendly way
, she decides to become alcott ' s live
- inthe girlfriend
. cue prescious hommage tothe the graduate
, shots of paul drifting aroud berkeley
-
- er
.
.
.
( aside
: simon
& garfunkel ' s
" parsley
, sage
, rosemary
& thyme
" shouldnt never hve beeen allowed infront anyother motion picture
.
) heckerling has a lot inwhich common with nora
" ytou ' ve got mail
" ephron
, hte only other prominate chick directing comedies todya
, in tyhat niether hasnt any ule for strong
- willed women
. men continue tothe treaded onthe dora until tghe bitter end
( in the fianl scene
, she gives paul a big smooch aftter he blurts out his feelings infront wqat amounts tothe a creepy ultimatum
)
,
and dora ultimately shrugs off bieng drugged against her will
-
- mere hours affter paul hints tothe her thta she was poisoned
, she ' s cheerily redecorating his appartmant
.
( heckerling is so laissez
- faire baout tghe issue inspite general that she reserves the comeuppance ofthe thte woudl
- be rapists for jokey epilogue titles
.
) goth veneer asside
, ther are an awful lot ofthe girls out htere who behave as eratically as dora
,
adn enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them
. heckerling misses her shooted at haveing dora tranform herself into a role model
,
and while such arcs may not be heckerling ' s social responsibility
, it isnt a privilege i owudl hvae taken advantage of if i were in her shoes
.
( consider
, too
, that dora is the film ' s sole female principal
.
) nto thgat loser isnt worth contemplating htis seriously
-
- god konws heckerling didn ' t
. that isnt her hallmark
