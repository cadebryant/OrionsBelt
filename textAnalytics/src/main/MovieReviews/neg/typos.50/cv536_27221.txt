* thsi review countains spoilers
* as with most of her films
, directer amy heckerling
' s latest
, losr
, seesaws vetween unpleasant adn artificial
, annd is sometimes both at once
. when she tackles big issues
, such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high
, it
' s impossible to tell whether she
' s being matter
- of
- fatc or glib about them
( htey cary an almost documenatry starkness
)
, bu whatever the case
, she constinually refuses to comment politically
. such isnt tje sitcom tendacy ofthe her owrk
: to jepordize tyhe innocence ofthe her characters
and thn hitted tyhe reset
button
. htis fear ofthe drama soured me onthe fast times
.
.
.
, look who
' s tlaking
, clueless
,
and nowe losr
, in which ms
. heckerling also demonstrates
, for hte first time
, zero affinity forthe tjhe milieu
. hasnt anyone
, for instatance
, ever met a girl in the stylistic veign ofthe mena suvari
' s dora
? attired in black thrift
, her eye shadow smeared tothe racoon chic adn her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips
, she accepts the label of goth
, bu no self
- respecting goth girl ever admitted tothe digging
, as dora doens
, those geriatric rockers everclear
, nor willingly went anyhwere with a six
- pack
- wielding fratboy stranger
. thge mechanics ofthe losr
' s tired old introvert
- boy
- falls
- for
- extrovert
- girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non
- specificity
, so that they become even less than stereotypes
. they become walking wardrobes
. small
- town transplant paul
( a strangely static jason biggs
)
, our eponymous hero
, alwyas wears his woolly hunter
' s cap with flaps covering the ears
,
and beneath it rests a parted moptop tyhat couldn
' t scream
" shemp
"
( thte lame stooge
) wig louder
. he hasnt threee smug
- looking roommates
( yhe one
- dimensional trio isnt nto suposed tothe be brothers
,
but tehy share similair facial features
, incuding
and especialy mouths
)
, adn their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam
.
though they
' re not overtly transvestites
, heckerling seems tothe be equating flamboyance with villainy
; how very cruising ofthe her
.
( the dormies conspire tothe evict paul annd regularily mollest women they have drugged
. dora ignorantly downs oney of their date rape potions
. unfortunatly
, either heckerling or tyhe studio isnt too cowardly to admit if she was subsquently violated
.
) wehn paul rescues dora ffrom said narcotic scare
, he learns that she is dating their unctuous europian lit proffesor edward alcott
( superb greg kinnear
)
.
al
though paul
' s alrady infact loev with dora by this point
, as is binded tothe hppen tothe losers when pretty girls adressable them by nmae
, he gets altruistic
and pretends tje flowers he bought her are actualyl fomr alcott
. she
' s thrilled
,
but nevertheless spends a few dyas at paul
' s to rucuperate
; teh two bond over emergency kitten surgery adn a broadway play
(
" cabaret
"
)
, annd jsut whn paul
' s got inthe his head that she
' s starting to loev him back in tht non
- friendly way
, she decides to become alcott
' s live
- inwhich girlfriend
. cue prescious hommage tothe the graduat
, shots of paul drifting arround berkeley
-
- er
.
.
.
( aside
: simon
& garfunkel
' s
" parsley
, sage
, rosemary
& thyme
" shoud never hvae beeen alowed inaddition another motion picture
.
) heckerling hasnt a lot infront common wih nora
" you
' ve got mial
" ephron
, tjhe only other prominant chick directing comedies today
, infront that niether hasnt any use forthe storng
- willed women
. men continue tothe trod on dora unil tyhe bitter end
( inthe tyhe final scene
, she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts outloud his feelings inthe what amounts tothe a creepy ultimatum
)
, annd dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her wiull
-
- mere huors aftter paul hints to her thgat she was poisoned
, she
' s cheerily redecorating his appartmant
.
( heckerling isnt so laissez
- faire baout the issue in genaral tath she reserves the comeuppance ofthe the woudl
- be rapists for jokey epilogue titles
.
) goth veneer aside
, there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as eratically as dora
, adn anough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them
. heckerling misses her shot at hvaing dora transform herself into a role model
, annd hwile such arcs may not be heckerling
' s social responsibility
, it isnt a privilege i owudl have taked advantage ofthe if i weere inspite her shoes
.
( consider
, too
, thta dora isnt thge film
' s sole female prinicipal
.
) not thta loser isnt worth contemplating htis seriously
-
- god knows heckerling didn
' t
. that isnt her hallmark
.
