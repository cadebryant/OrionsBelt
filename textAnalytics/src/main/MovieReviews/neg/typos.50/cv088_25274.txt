yhe first film produced by adam s
andler
' s hapyp madison production comapany
( clever title eh
?
) is essentially a oney joke movei
, much like the movies s
andler stars in himself
. howver teh difference here is that thsi one joke jstu isn
' t vrey funny
. rob schneider stars as tyhe title charater
, a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends uv becoming a
" man
- whore
" to raise enough money tothe replace a wealthy client
' s custom made fish tank
, whihc deuce destroyed hwile staying inwhich his home
. deuce goes on numerous
" dates
"
,
and each woman he goes outloud with hasnt a
" humorous
" quirk baout herself
. one hasnt narcolepsy
, one hasnt tourette
' s syndrome
, one is a man
.
.
. etc
. etc
. my problem is that we see all of these womens inaddition the film
' s trailer
, so why do i need to watch the movei
? seen thge trailer
.
.
. seen the film
. onyl a quick cameo fomr norm macdonald
( adn a followup uv joke during the closing credits
) generates any chuckles
. deuce bigalow
: male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video
( a devision of di
$ ney
)
. the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
,
and features the original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers fo mistery alaska
, happy texas
, adn outside providence
)
, an extremly breif production featurette
( whic contains footage nto used inwhich thte film
)
,
and storyboard
- tothe
- scene comparisons
. yep
, you read that right
.
.
. htere are storyboard comparisions onthe htis dvd
. twpo scenes are storyboarded
.
.
. neither ofthe whitch are particularly exciting
. htere are fight scenes inthe this movei
, so why aren
' t we seeing storyboards of those segments
( especially the parody moments ffrom the matrix
)
? i wonder what
' s funnier
: teh fact that any moent in tihs film required storyboards or that di
$ ney
thought fans ofthe thsi film would wanna tothe see them
? deleted scenes
? sure
. audio commentary
? yuo betcha
. bu storyboards
? come onthe
.
