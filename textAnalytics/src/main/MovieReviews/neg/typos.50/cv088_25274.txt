tyhe firt film produced by adam sandler ' s hapyp madison prodcution company
( clever title eh
?
) isnt essentialy a noe joke movie
, much like the movies sandler stars in himself
.
however hte difference here is that thsi oen joke just isn ' t vyre funny

" tothe raise enought money tothe replace a wealthy client ' s custom made fish tank
, whlch deuce destroyed hwile staying iin his hmeo
. deuce goes onthe numberous
" dates
"
,
annd eahc woman he goes out with has a
" huomrous
" quirk about herself
. oney hasnt narcolepsy
, one hasnt tourette ' s syndrome
, oney isnt a man
.
.
