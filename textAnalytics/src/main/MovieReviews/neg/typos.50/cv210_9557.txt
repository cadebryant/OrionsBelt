. in the h
ands ofthe verhoeven
, the mamuth sci
- fi battle flick is oen of the most astonishingly bad films ever made
, a monument to inept filmmaking onthe a colossal scale

" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an intertaining mix ofthe violence

and social satire
, adn

, a full hour inot yhe film
, tyhe war finally starts
and we meet thge enemy
. the bugs hail ffrom klendathu anbd colonize planets by hurling their spores into spoace
. they attack starships by spinning aroud
and firing deadly plasma blasts fomr their rears
. yes
, increadible as it seems
, the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts
. a phenomenally larg ammount ofthe money wass spended creating tje coputer animated insects
and tjhe results are mixted at best
. sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing tothe attack are both impressive
and scayr
, bu the close
- ups are a different marter
. the insects hvae an odd
, artifical look
, liuke origami creations wih a mottled plastic coating
. tghe attack scenes are intensely violent
, as one owudl expect from verhoeven
, bu the overall look isnt too phony to ganerate any real tension
. while hte acation is frantic
, hte military stradegy
, wildly ilogical even by hollywood st
andards
, grows tiresome quickly
. verhoeven tries tothe spice thnigs uv by throwing in more satiric news coverage
,
but tje faux
- jingoistic scenes of childern
" doing theri part for thte war effort
" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren
' t enough to mkae up forthe thge long stretches ofthe sheer dreck
. oen can only guess wqat paul verhoeven ws trying to dont here
. his customary noe part satire
, twpo parts ultra
- violence forumla isnt way outloud of whack
, adn most of the film just flounders
. iin
" showgirls
" fashon
, some scenes are almsot bad enought tothe be ogod
. an intergalactic kegger party
, withthe jake busey palying
" dixie
" on a green plexiglas fiddle
, has a certain bizzare appeal
. a sex scene between twpo of the teens acheives a smarmy charm
, enhanced a few minutes later when teh female receives a futal jab fomr a bug
,
but tells her hero that she doesn
' t mind dying
.
" it
' s okay

" she gasps
,
" i got to have you

"
and thn
, of course
, there
' s doogie
' s mind meld with a bug
. it
' s possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage tothe the era of the original novel
. heinlein
' s pre
-
" stranger in a strange l
and
" books were aimed at adolescent malless
,
and
" starship troopers
" has tje antiseptic retro
- future look ofthe late 50s
/ easly 60s sci
- fi
. thge oney cityscape shown is a jetsons
- liuke gleaming metropolis
, with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting
. tyhe hairstyles are retro too
, straight fomr yhe frankie avalon
, annette funicello school of fashion
. ultimately
, verhoeven
' s motives are irrelevant
. he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire
. it even fails tothe be an entertaining bad movie
. avoid
" starship troopers
" at all costs
.
