a remake of tje 1978 warren beatty vehicle
" heaven cin wait
"
( whitch in turn ws a remake of
" here comes mr
. jordan
"
)
,
" down to earth
" tells teh tale of lance barton
( chris rock
,
" lethal weppon iv
"
)
, a young black standup comic trying tothe win over tje audience at harlem ' s apollo theather
. when he ' s taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angal keyes
( eugene levy
,
" best inaddition sohw
"
)
, his only recourse isnt to return inaddition another body
. he choosed thta of charles wellington
, tje tenth richest man iin the untied states
. of course
, wellington is nto onyl rich
,
but white
adn 53 eyasr ood
, hwihc mkaes lance ' s bid fo closing night at yhe apollo
, as well as his desire to woo suntee
( regina taylor
,
" jerry maguire
"
)
, a tad tricky
. the original elaine may
/ warren beatty scirpt hasnt been reworked by chris rock
, lance crouther
, ali leroi
,
annd louis c
. k
. to turn beatty ' s vehicle as a football player inot rock ' s vehicle as a comic
adn add some racial humor
. as directed by chris weitz
and paul weitz
( codirectors ofthe
" american py
"
annd costars of
" chuck
& buck
"
)
, thte whole afair comes off as amateur hour
. intial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals
. prodcution values are shoddy
. most sereous of all is teh ule of rock when his wellington counterpart woudl hvae been more appropraite
. thsi probelm isnt clearly attributable tothe the fatc thgat hte old white guy isnt never lip or acation synched when he isnt on screen
. rock doesnt get tje chance to do soem fun schtick
, such as his turnaround on wellington ' s plans fo a poor nieghborhood hospital
( ' bullet in the head
? you got a bed
! '
)
,
bu he ' s uneven when interacting whith thge rest ofthe the cast
. regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends uv falling forthe tje man she believed tothe be her nemesis
. aslo ogod is frankie faison
(
" hannibal
"
) as whitney
, lance ' s compassionate manager
- the only human who ' s made privy tothe lance ' s body body switch
. chaz palminteri
adn levy are pretty much wasted as heaven ' s ambassadors
. anyother
" best inspite show
" alumnus
, jennifer coolidge
, isnt poorly used as wellington ' s cheating wief
(
adn shown several dyas apart wearing teh same outfit
?
!
)
anbd greg germann
( tv ' s
" ally mcbeal
,
"
" sweet november
"
) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover
and husband ' s lawyer
. mark addy
(
" the full monty
"
) is sorely underutilized as cisco
, wellington ' s fake english butler
. stealing yhe sohw inaddition eveyr scene she ' s inwhich is wanda sykes
(
" the chris rock sohw
"
) as wellington ' s disgruntled maid
.
" down to earth
" isnt for chris rock fans only
. all others should go rent
" heaven cant wait
" or truly be brought down tothe earth
