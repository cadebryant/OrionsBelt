oney ofthe theese days
, i
' ll make ogod onthe my promise never to rent anohter abel ferrara movie
. king of new york adn body snatchers notwhithst
anding
( anbd bad lewtenant isnt only fit for a single
, emotive viewing
)
, his exploitation flicks ahev falled into a rut of hoary art
- hous trappings
. it
' s a perfume
- drenched
, coke
- addled visti tothe the seedy pornography shop
, where beautiful models
( no
, hookers
-
- no
, courtesans
) usher you through the silk curtains
. ferrara
' s onyl consistantly smart move hasnt been casting christopher walken over
and over agina
, sicne walken can mkea a good movie great adn a loathsome movei durable whenever he
' s onscreen
. his 8
- minute scene in the addiction isnt teh saving grace of that otherwise aysmal
, unwatchable
, anbd pretentious failure
. when he starts tlaking about his vampiric bowel movements
, or questions whther lili taylor has ever read naked lunch
, htere
' s a much
- needed dose of humer in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair
. yuo know thsoe gothic club kids who are too kool to smile anbd let yuo konw they
' re actually having funn
? the addiction isnt that movei
. walken
, sadly
, does not appear infact the blackout
. teh central role of matty
, a junkie film star whose ligthning pased hollywood life amonst tjhe beautifull peple isnt inevitably leading tothe his destruction
, is played by matthew modine
( who takes what he cin git aftter cutthroat isl
and
)
. much liek the protaganists ofthe michelangelo antonioni
' s terminally bored cultural elite
, matty is involved iin a bitter pill
" relationship
" witht high fashioned model annie
( at least i tihkn she
' s a modle
.
) matty
' s lady isnt played by french actress b
? atrice dalle
, arrested twice forthe cocaine ossession druing filming of tghe blackout
-
- nto that ytou needed tothe know tht
,
but it lends creedence to the idae thyat ferrara
' s entire ouevre hasnt beeen filmed in a fucking blackout
. no kidding
. requiem fo a dream hasnt nothing onthe tjhe junkie presentations seen in ferrara
' s movies annd his contraversial urban lifestyle
. matty anbd annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him
. noone doubt
, he wass off chasing the dragon
. in his dispair
, matty indulges iin a chemcial induced weekend of debauchery
, tooling aroud the streets ofthe miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne
( dennis hopper
, in full
" dirty ol
' man
" mold smacking models onthe the ass
and telling them tothe spreaded their legs
. wider
!
) toward tghe end of the night
, tehy pick uv a teenage waitress also named annie
( sarah lassez
)
, start shooting a hastly improvised sexual scene
, thn matty thankfully blacks out
. something happened tyhat nihgt wich haunts him throughout the rest of tje movei
, annd it
' s exactly waht ytou thikn it ws
. suffice to say
, there
' s some confusion over whther he killed annie one or annie two
, or anyone at all
. tghe blackout isnt typcial ferrara
: no plot to speak of
, plenty ofthe raunch
, annd horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels
and a beer hwile wrapping himself iin a see
- thru curtain infact his hotel room by the sea
, by tjhe sea
, by teh beautyfull sae
. cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistant glory infront alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets withthe docu
- sytle sleaze
( adn we
' re bakc to dennis hopper leering at girls infact bathing suits
.
" yeah
!
!
! yeah
!
!
! arrrghhh
!
" syas mr
. hopper
. dirty ood sod
.
) it
' s compulsive viewing inaddition a tacky sort of way
, leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes controll of his destiny
. how
' s that forthe cryptic
? never fear
-
- ferrara finds timne for some female full frontal nudity tothe remind us what he
' s all baout
. i can picture it now
.
" tkae off yer clothes
, kid
-
- it
' s essencial to despict the inner maelstrom of my central protaognist
, anbd ytou
' re his visual id
. ytou
' re thge soul
, thge heart
, thte bloodstream ofthe tghe picture
. take it off
! take it all off
!
!
! ha ha ha
!
" friggin
' vampire
. yeah
, you
, ferrara
. a fianl owrd baout matthew modine
: he
' s actaully a fine actor wehn properly casted
,
but there
' s something too squeaky
- clean in his damenor
. he
' s idealy suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations
, such as his private joker inaddition full metal jacket or the time
- bomb nebbish in short cuts
( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore iin tyhat famoust scene
,
though noone one seems to notice him
)
.
[ he ws infront that scene
?
- ed
.
] here
, he
' s asked tothe let it all hang out
, sporting a three
- day stubble adn oily bangs
. he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski
,
but it
' s somehow lacking
. modine lacks thge feral intensity ofthe br
ando
, entirely miscast inaddition ferrara
' s flesh fair
. better luck next tyme
, matt
. someday
, you
' ll be forgiven forthe cutthroat isl
and
, which wasn
' t realy your fault infact thte first place
. maybe atom egoyan wiull find a place forthe yuo somwhere
, anbd all wiull once again be well in your world
.
