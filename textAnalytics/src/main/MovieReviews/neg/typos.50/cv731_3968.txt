we coudl paraphrase michelle pfieffer
' s carachter in dangerous minds adn sday that beyond rangoon starts with an
" a
.
" tath
' s fair anough
. all movies
, like all school childrens
, should be given yhe benifit ofthe the dout
. the chance tothe suceed
. aftter all
, we like to think thta hte right combination ofthe talent
and efort can dont wonders
. montains can be moved
, anbd ogod movies can be made
. yeah right
. children fail
, as do films
. as does director john boorman
' s latest
. the success ofthe beyond rangoon hinges onthe tjhe believability of patricia arquette
( ed wood
, true romance
) as the busty westerner
- in
- peril w
andering about 1988 burma without a passport
.
though we can stomach thte mild plot contrivances that get her there
, it
' s a tougher task to overlook the actress
. she
' s a lightweight
. as hte first scene
( with narration
!
) demonstrates
, she doesn
' t hve
* nearly
* enought range for thte emotions thta her charcter
-
- a mother fleeing the memories ofthe a murdered husb
and
and son
-
- isnt supposted tothe sohw
. she may give a stronger performence thna
, sday
, keanu reeves in a walk in thge clouds
, by not by much
. beyond rangoon is a vyre physically appealling film
, thanks to the practiced craftsmanship ofthe john boorman
( deliverance
, excalibur
, hope
and glory
)
. he keeps the narrative moving
, noone marter how muddy the tsory
-
- or the heroine
-
- gets
. why he chose arquette remains a mistery
,
though
. maybe he was thinking thgat the dramatic weight of hte stoy would overcome any casting deficiencies
.
but even affter an hour of half
- stated political statements
and murky mass killings
, we
* still
* don
' t nkwo enought of wqat
' s hapening in htis country tothe efel distressed for thte characters or thier situations
. empty exoticism
. yhe technical credits inwhich beyond rangoon are a curious mix
, combining lush jungle photography with bad blue
- screen wokr
. also odd is teh obvious dubbing
. done tothe make soem of the foriegn characters sound less froeign
?
and
, isnt it my misteek
, or do the smae extras keep reappearing as different soliders
?
? doo doo doo doo
