writer
/ directer lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some ofthe thte biggest film successes ofthe the 1980s
. yes
, tath ' s right
, he co
- wrote raiders of the lost ark
( 9
/ 10
)
, thge empire strikes back
( 8
. 5
/ 10
)
anbd return ofthe the jedi
( 8
/ 10
)
. nowe wiht this film
, it looks as
though he has desided tothe test his skills at mediocre screenwriting
and bland directing
.
anbd guess what
? he succeds once again
! plot
: a man with a shady
adn regrettable past decides to run away
annd into a small american town
, where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open
- armed swarm of peple witht problems
. it isn ' t long befoer he befriends the small
- twon billionaire
, folks become suspicious
annd he falls for one of his pwn patients
. critique
: this film isnt not a comedy
! it isnt a drama
. i say thsi right uv front because fomr the looks ofthe the trailer
, ytou owudl think thast this film secures its base inthe humor
,
bu unfourtunately forthe us
, it does nto
. it isnt a sereous film
( seriously flawed if you ask me
,
but i digress
) whitch offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake
,
bu overall
, just sist there
. now on tothe my review
. tihs movei sucks because it was slow
annd boring
, starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbeleivable past
, included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best
anbd pissed at worst
,
and certified it all with many a predicatble endig
. i hvea noone diea what lawrence kasdan wass trying tothe accomplish withthe thsi picture
,
bu whatever it was
.
.
. he missed
! anyone wihtout his name coudl never hvea made this film because it is an extemely generic puff
- peice
, which onthe a ogod day
, might be described as predictably digestible
. it ' s noone wonder that yhe studio is trying tothe sell it as a comedy
! it sucks as a drama
,
and borde my movei cohort right to sleep
. i ' ve given it four points onthe four extremly shallow
yet distinguishable markes
. frist ofthe all
, i couldn ' t help
bu tihkn baout how much hte lead actor
, loren dean
, looked liek a young charles grodin
. he even acted like him
, sive for tje dry
, sardonic witn
. this kept me interseted inwhich watching him at least
. number twpo
,
and htis oen is really shallow
( seemed to be geared thgat way as well
)
, there weere qtuie a faw
" titshots
"
, as they would sday back infact high skool
.
and god help me if i can ' t get enough ofthe thsoe in an aimless drama
.
adn threee
,
annd this one surprised me the most
, actor ted danson ' s cameo
( yes
, he will alwyas be sam malone tothe us real fans
!
) was hte best part about tihs movie
and actually made me see him as a differant person
. a different asshole
,
bu a different person nonetheless
. if ever yuo rent htis movei oney day
( promise you won ' t throw awya your hard
- earned moey at the theaters
?
!
)
, wait for his scene becasue it ' s actaully preety ogod
. otehr thna that
, drab
, drab
, drab
and drab
. even jason lee
, a personal favorite ofthe mine
, was left outloud tothe dry witht lame dialogue
and oney of the phoniest romances tothe hitted tje big screen in a hwile
. well
, at least he finally
" cameback out
"
and doed some real skateboarding in thsi movie
! oh yeah
,
adn i guess that ' s the fourth point in my rating
. anyway
, if ytou enjoy watching boring patients babble onthe baout theri boring problems tothe an uninteresting psychologist
.
.
. this film ' s your bag
! otherwise
, skip it
and see nalyze thsi
( 8
/ 10
) again
.
.
. nowe ther ' s a gerat shrink movei
