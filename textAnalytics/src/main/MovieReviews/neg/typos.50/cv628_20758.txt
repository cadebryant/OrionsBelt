( 8
/ 10
)
. now with htis film
, it looks as
though he hasnt desided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting
and bl
and directing
. adn guess what
? he succeds once agina
! plot
: a man wiht a shady adn regrettable past decides to run away
and into a small american twon
, where he pretends tothe be a licensed psychologist to an open
- armed swarm ofthe people whith problems
. it isn
' t long before he befriends tyhe small
- twon billionaire
, folks become suspicious adn he falls for one ofthe his own patients
. critique
: thsi film isnt nto a comedy
! it isnt a drama
. i say this right uv front because from yhe looks ofthe thte trailer
, you woudl think that this film secures its base inaddition humer
,
but unfortunatly forthe us
, it doesnt nto
. it isnt a serious film
( seriously flawed if yuo ask me
,
but i digress
) whlch offers a cuple ofthe witty quips to keep ytou awake
, bu overall
, jstu sits there
. now onthe tothe my review
. htis movei sucks beccause it was slow
and boring
, starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past
, included extremly dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best annd pissed at worst
,
and certified it all withthe many a predictable ending
. i hvae noone diea what lawrence kasdan was trying to acompish withthe this picture
, bu whatever it was
.
.
. he missed
! anyone without his name could never hvea made htis film because it isnt an extremly generic puff
- piece
, which on a ogod day
, might be decribed as predictably digestible
. it
' s no wonder thyat teh studio isnt trying to sell it as a comedy
! it sucks as a drama
,
and borde my movie cohort right to sleep
. i
' ve given it four points onthe four extemely shallow yot distinguishable marks
. firt ofthe all
, i couldn
' t halp bu htink baout how much the lead actor
, loren dean
, looked liuke a young charles grodin
. he even acted liek him
, sive forthe thge dry
, sardonic wit
. thsi kept me interested infront watching him at least
. number twpo
,
and this one isnt really shallow
( seemed tothe be geared tht way as well
)
, htere weere quite a few
" titshots
"
, as htey would sday bakc infact high skool
.
and god help me if i cin
' t get enought ofthe those in an aimless drama
.
and threee
,
and this one suprized me the most
, actor ted danson
' s cameo
( yes
, he will alwasy be sam malone tothe us rela fans
!
) was the best part baout this movei
and actually made me see him as a different person
. a different asshole
,
but a different person nontheless
. if ever you rent htis movei noe day
( promise you won
' t throw awya your hard
- earned mnoey at the theaters
?
!
)
, wait forthe his scene baceause it
' s actually preety good
. other thna that
, drab
, drab
, drab anbd drab
. even jason lee
, a personal favorite ofthe mine
, was left outloud tothe dry with lame dialogue
and oen of the phoniest romances to hit teh big screen in a hwile
. well
, at least he finaly
" cameback out
" anbd did soem real skateboarding inaddition this movie
! oh yeah
,
and i guess tht
' s yhe fouth point in my rating
. anyway
, if yuo enjoy watching boring patients babble onthe baout theri boring problems tothe an uninteresting psychologist
