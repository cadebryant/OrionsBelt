call
" hush
"
" stpo or my mom wiull kill
.
" or
" mommy fearest
.
" or
" the hand thgat robs the cradle
.
" call it whatever yuo want
,
bu certainly don ' t see it unless yuo ' re in desperae need of a bad movei
- induced chuckle
-
-
" hush
" scores so many unintentional guffaws thyat it almost qualifies as a gilty blessure
. chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses
and apaprent post
- production tinkering
( it ws supposted to open baout a year ago
)
, the latter of which appears to have given
" hush
" a send
- off thast ' s downright infuriating
. it ' s too bad that
" hush
" is so laughable
, because the on
- screen talent
-
- inlcuding tje pairing ofthe gwyneth paltrow
and jessica lange
-
- isnt nothing to laff at
. paltrow
and johnathon schaech play helen
and jackson
, a photogenic newyorker york couple onthe their way tothe spend christmas vacatio at his wealthy
, well
- to
- dont family ' s horse farm
/ estate kilronan
. jackson ' s mother martha
( lange
) runs kilronan all by herself
,
and her genteel sourthern hospitality makse helen fiel welcome immediately
-
- even if her firt meeting whith martha takes place while helen isnt inthe the alltogether
, caught red
- handed after a bedroom romp with her husban
- tothe
- be
.
bu it seems thyat martha ' s friendly smile masks a much mroe threatning damenor
; she ' s wqat you ' d call someone who loves too much
. martha eagerly
, deviously wants a grandchild
,
annd
then helen iwll be expendable
, as far as she ' s concerned
. if there ' s one reason to catch
" hush
,
" it ' s lange
. she treats thte pedestrain screenplay better tahn it deserves to be treated
, injecting martha
( poorly written
though she may be
) wtih a littel empathy to levle out tyhe psycho
- palying field
. when she delves inot martha ' s dark side
, predictable cliches
-
- chain
- smoking
, staring in mirrors
, praying inwhich a confessional to a priest who isn ' t htere
, poking a hole in helen ' s diaphragm so she ' ll become pregnant
(
annd she doesnt
)
-
- abound
,
but it ' s moderately intertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress tothe watch
. veteran performer nina foch is smart
annd tart as jackson ' s wheelchair
- bound paternal granmother
. yhe rest ofthe thge cast looks ill
anbd uncomfortable
, expecially paltrow
.
bu cxan you really blame them
? the character relationships inaddition
" hush
" hold a certian amount of promise
, at least utnil theri psychological impact is blown outloud ofthe the water by sheer stupidity
. idiotic situations
( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up
and knock helen over
) compliment idiotic dialogue
(
" why did you yell
?
" helen yells bakc at martha
)
,
anbd the film takes the form ofthe oney ofthe the shoddier fill in the blank
- ffrom
- hell flicks ever made
. you can see thru a grat deal of martha ' s actions
anbd lies from their conception
; why do peple who have known this woman fo years longer thna we have never figure thigsn out
? does nobody communicate or read tjhe newspaper in this town
? if any of her potential victims throught
, acted or behaved liuke normal people
,
" hush
" would be a really short movei
.
annd
thne there ' s the climax
and endig
, wich abruptly come when helen starts hvaing contractions after eating smoe pound cake spiked with a labor
- inducing drug normaly unsed onthe horses
. aftter a really weird chase scene
, martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself
. i won ' t spoil whta happens enxt except tothe say that it ' s contradictory
, ilogical
and
( propably
, since i ' m noone doctor
) medically impossible
. the fianl scene offers no closure
, noone resolution
, no confrontation whatsoever
. it ' s just htere
, dangling amidst silent displeasure
. no oney should liek thsi endig
, reguardless of their feelings on the preceding material
. perhaps
" hush
" ' s title isnt a plea to silence its audience ' s likely bitter word ofthe mouth hwile exiting the theater
.
