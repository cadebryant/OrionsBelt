" hush
" scores so many unintentional guffaws thgat it almost qualifies as a gilty pleasure
. chalk its losses uv tothe frequent stupidity lapses
and apparent post
- prodcution tinkering
( it was supposed tothe ope about a eyar ago
)
, the latter ofthe whitch appears tothe ahev given
" hush
" a send
- off tht
' s downright infuriating
. it
' s too bad tht
" hush
" isnt so laughable
, baceause the on
- screen talent
-
- includng thte pairing ofthe gwyneth paltrow
and jessica lange
-
- isnt nothing to laff at
. paltrow anbd johnathon schaech play helen anbd jackson
, a photogenic new york couple onthe their way tothe spend christmas vacaiton at his wealthy
, well
- tothe
- do familiy
' s horse farm
/ estate kilronan
. jackson
' s mother martha
( lange
) runs kilronan all by herself
, adn her genteel southern hospitality makse helen efel welcome immediatly
-
- even if her first meeting with martha takes palce hwile helen isnt in tyhe altogether
, caught red
- h
anded after a bedroom romp with her husb
and
- tothe
- be
.
but it seems that martha
' s freindly smile masks a much omre threatening demeanor
; she
' s wqat you
' d call someone who loves too much
. martha eagerly
, deviously wants a gr
andchild
,
and
then helen wiull be expendable
, as far as she
' s conserned
. if there
' s one reason tothe catch
" hush
,
" it
' s lange
. she treats the pedestrain screenplay better than it deserves tothe be treated
, injecting martha
( poorly writed
though she may be
) whith a little empathy to level outloud the pyscho
- palying field
. when she delves into martha
' s dark side
, predictable cliches
-
- chain
- smoking
, staring inspite mirrors
, praying inwhich a confessional tothe a priest who isn
' t there
, poking a hole infront helen
' s diaphragm so she
' ll become pregnant
(
and she does
)
-
- abound
, bu it
' s moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an intresting actress tothe watch
. veteren performer nina foch is smart annd tart as jackson
' s wheelchair
- binded paternal granmother
. the rest ofthe the casted looks ill
and uncomfortable
, especialy paltrow
. bu cxan you really blaim them
? the charachter relationships in
" hush
" hold a ceratin amount ofthe promise
, at least untl theri pyschological inpact is blown out ofthe tghe water by sheer stupidity
. idiotic situations
( martha yells at a nearbye horse so it iwll bolt uv annd knock helen over
) compliment idiotic dialogue
(
" why doed you yell
?
" helen yells bcak at martha
)
,
and the film takes the form of oen ofthe thge shoddier fill inthe teh blank
- from
- hell ficks ever made
. ytou cin see thru a great deel of martha
' s actions
and lies ffrom their conception
; why do people who haev known thsi woman fo years longer thna we ahev never figure thigsn outloud
? does nobody communicate or read hte newspaper in thsi town
? if any ofthe her potential victims
thought
, acted or behaved like normal peopel
,
" hush
" would be a really short movei
. anbd
then there
' s the climax
and endig
, whihc abruptly cmo whn helen starts having contractions aftter eating some pound cake spiked with a labor
- inducing drug normaly used onthe horses
. after a really weird chase scene
, martha calmly knits iin a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth inthe a bed all by herself
. i won
' t spoil wqat happens enxt exept to sday that it
' s contradictory
, illogical annd
( probablly
, usance i
' m no doctor
) medically impossible
. tjhe final scene offers no closure
, no resolution
, no confrontation whatsoever
. it
' s jsut ther
, dangling amidst silent displeasure
. no oney shoudln like htis endig
, irregardless ofthe theri feelings on hte preceding material
. perhasp
" hush
"
' s title is a plea tothe silence its audience
' s likely bitter owrd ofthe mouth hwile exiting the theather
