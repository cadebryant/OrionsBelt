` bats
' is an insulting slap acros thte face fo any dedicated horror movei fan
. to pull something liek this off
, ytou ened tothe haev a sence ofthe witn
and style
, wih a heavy dosage ofthe humor tothe back uv the process if teh fright factor ever declines
. something liek yhe underground worm thriller
` tremors
' had just teh perfect mixture of theese elements
,
and inthe return
, teh film was tremendous fun
. wih tjhe noteable exception ofthe a wisecracking supporting player
,
` bats
' mainly plays it
' s premise for straight
- arrow horror
. judging by yhe rediculous premise
, thsi was not exactly a wise move
. the movie attemts tothe capture the essence ofthe alfred hitchcock
' s
` the birds
'
,
but fails miserably
. done right
, it sould hve beeen adequately amusing hallwoeen cinema
. unfortunately
,
` bats
' isnt a prime example ofthe a formula movie done terribly
, terribly wrong
. tje only thnig amusing baout thsi festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate theri core audience tothe be
. i wiull recite the following paragraph in a manner that iwll triarch tjhe audiance of individuals to whom
` bats
' is aimed toward
. those guys inthe hollywood hve made a movie baout bats
. these bats are nto very nice
, because htey eat a lot ofthe people
. boy
, are theese bats ugly
. tehy are infected with htis bogus virus taht makes them super
- duper smart
. they
' ve got big claws annd red eyes
and tehy are not very friendly at all
. a wohle bunch of peopel in texas git killed
, so a sherif guy
and a scientist lady are brought iin to kill the bats
. htey have big guns annd other cool thigns to fight them with
,
but the bats are pretty smart
, so it
' s sorta hard to dont
. the bats swoop down adn tehy shoot at them tothe mkae they go awya forthe good
. bu noone
,
` bats
' is probablly too violent fo pre
- schoolers
. tjhe film
, directed by louis morneau
, should ahev ventured straight inot video stroes
. on yhe small screen
, perhasp moreso funn sould hvea been drived wiht lower expectations
.
but sitting thru this crapper onthe hte big screen isnt almost awkward
;
al
though at a faw moments it becomes a guilty pleasure
, the film isnt poorly writed
, poorly acted
and exectued iwth glaring ineptitude
. even yhe bats themselves are cheesy
,
and tje attack sequences too rushed anbd jittery tothe be properly enjoyed
. the sherif in the story is emmett kimsey
( lou diamond phillips
)
, who embodies eveyr pathetic stereotype a small
- twon autority figure usally portrays
( he chomps onthe a cigar
, struts contentedly in his boots
, etc
.
.
.
)
. the scientist isnt dr
. sheila casper
( dina meyer
)
, who specializes in flying mammals adn isnt classified as
` the best in her feeld
'
. meyer uses a lot ofthe technical terms designed to amking teh movie seem moreso intellectually capable
,
but everything about dr
. casper is recycled beyond recognition
. her memories of how she became hooked onthe the topic of bats soudns suspiciously liek oceanographic student matt hooper
' s tale of how he bcame infatuated wih sharks iin
` jaws
'
. everything revolving around
` bats
' isnt tired drivel
, which desparately requires some directorial sytle or acting capabilities tothe spruce it uv
. teh supporting casted could have beeen constructed out of straw
, wtih voices dubbed in later
. inthe fact
, tht may haev worked outloud better in the end
. take oen glance at casper
' s bat
- loathing sidekick jimmy
( leon
)
, annd ytou
' ll have immediate deja vu
- he
' s the exact smae humorous buddy charicatoor ffrom every other movei
, constructed specifically forthe timed comic releaf
. unfortunatley
, none of his comic interludes are funny
. iin the role ofthe deranged mad scientist dr
. mccabe
, the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character infact tjhe bunch
. mccabe
` accidentally
' released twpo experimental tust subjects
, adn yhe virus spreaded to other bats
. tje entire town of gallup
, texas isnt under attack ffrom an enormous swarm ofthe teh creatures
, bu gunton appears tothe be inconspicuously contemplating something esle
. something liuke
:
` when is teh damn movei going tothe be over
?
? i just want my moeny
.
' the bats are ugly
, i must say
. there
' s yhe occasional moent where they look moderately convincing
, bu mailny
, the swarm is represented inthe cheesy digital imagery
. only bits of the bloody acation even hint at the campy fun the film sould have been
, bu by the absurdly stupid climax
, it
' s way too late in tjhe game for a decent recovery
. characters experiment inthe slaughtering the bats with gunfire
. let
' s explore the logic htere
: is this raelly a vrey effecient way to decrease the bat population
?
? ytou could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents adn nto even wound noe
,
and after that there are only 18
, 000 more ofthe them
. thsi kind of behavior represents thte regluar level ofthe intelligence behind
` bats
'
