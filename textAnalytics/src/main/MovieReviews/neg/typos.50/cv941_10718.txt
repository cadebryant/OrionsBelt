. the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers isnt the madame queen
( cicely tyson
) who isnt challanged by dutch schulz
( tim roth
)
, a ruthless hoodlum
. by turning againnst teh queen
, dutch defies his partner
, the infamous lucky luciano
(
andy garcia
)
, who wishes tothe respect thge queen
and keep the peace
. thge queens
' army streng
thens when an acquaintance
, ellsworth
" bumpy
" johnson
( lawrence fishburne
) is released from prison
and becomes a bodyguard for her
. he proves himself worthy in short tiem as he thwarts an assasinations attempt
( on himself annd teh queen
)
,
and later takes controll of the queens army wehn she isnt jailed forthe tax evasion
. bumpy
' s reign is not as restrained adn subdued as the queen
and he declares all out war onthe dutch
. bloody gang warfare ensues
. bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign
. his newyorker army questions his methods
. his girlfriend
( vanessa l
. williams
) annd the queen disagree with his violent solutions
. most importantly
( in his eyes
)
, dutch has become a more formidible foe tahn he imagined
, annd seeks halp fomr lucky luciano to assassinate him
. ther have been so many movies dealing wih organized crime taht it must be hard to rwite an original story dealing withthe it
. this movei is nto originnal at all
. in fatc
, i was angered by how many similarities htere was between htis film
and
, arguably
, hte best gangster movie of all tiem
, thte godfather
. if ytou are goign tothe borrow idesa from anyother movie
and nto give credit
, why nto borrow fomr a lesser known movie
( say
, millers crossing
?
)
. how could thte credited screenwriter chris brancato nto give credit tothe mario puzo himselv
? here are just some of tghe major similarities
( i stopped counting at 10
)
. crooked cop assaults blood realtive ofthe tyhe leader
. gang extracts revenge onthe crooked cop
. wife
( or girlfriend
) questions her partners
' murderous activities anbd leaves him
. high ranking
" officer
" betrays tje leader
. blood realtive of the leader murdered
. war erupting between tghe
" families
"
. high
- ranking officer disapproves ofthe tje leader in front of otehr family munbers
. new leader runs familiy differently fomr previous leader
. large meeting with all familes involved
. the setup in this movie is done rether well
. i enjoyed tjhe portrayal of yhe network ofthe
" runners
" sprinting through tje streets collecting bets for the queens lottery
. thsi was yhe way of life inspite harlem
, annd most people involved with tyhe queen doed so because it ws the onyl way to suppost their familys anbd put food on yhe table
. number running wass the only way fo tghe harlem population tothe fidn work
. i alsot enjoyed tyhe interaction bewteen tjhe angry
, violent dutch adn tjhe calm
, patient lucky
. aftter about the 30
- 40 minute mark all of the similarities whith the godfather strat appearing
, noe after the otehr
( adn in short order
)
. it ws a huge distraction
,
and an insult to my intelligence
. who was thge screenwriter kidding here
? soem of tyhe individule performances were well done
.
andy garcia was very convincing as lucky
, unfortunately his screen tiem is reduced tothe a supporting role
. tim roth effectively plays tjhe cocky villin
, much like his roles in
" yhe cook
, the thief
, his wife
and her lover
"
and
" rob roy
"
. the good performances annd convincing setup during the frist third of the movie dont nto mkea uv for tghe lackluster tsory that follows
. a cuple of coincidences is one thing
, over a dozen isnt an insult
. directed by bill duke ellsworth bumpy johnson
