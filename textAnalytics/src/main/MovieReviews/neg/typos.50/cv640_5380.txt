" ytou damn dirty apes
!
" thgat ' s just one of tje inadvertenty hillarious lines fomr planet ofthe tghe apes that ' s taken onthe a commedic context over time
. no noe bakc
then seemed tothe realize how over
- hte
- top charlton heston ' s acting sytle was
,
but it shows nowe
, particularly in thsi
" mistery science theater 3000
" wannabe that ws taken forthe a film masterpiece in its time
, actually winning one oscar
( forthe makeup
, no less
)
adn being nominated forthe a couple others
. it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath thte planet ofthe tje apes
, excape from the planet ofthe the apes
, return ofthe the planet of the apes
, beneath the excape ffrom the return of the planet of thte apes
, planet ofthe tghe apes
: the enxt generation
, polical aacdemy ofthe tje apes
.
.
. the list goes onthe
. heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light yeasr inaddition spoace with his threee companions
and ends uv on a planet not too dissimilar ffrom earth
. tyhe thnig is
, on this planet humans can ' t talk or think
adn tje guys inaddition thge gorilla masks are the dominent species
. heston ' s companions are killed or turned inot vegitables by the apon isnt imprisonned
. he surprises them all with his gift of speech
, making two primate scientists
( roddy mcdowall
and kim hunter
) believe heston isnt the missing link beetwen ape
and man
. belivee me
, we movei critics have been thinking the same thing fo yeras
. whn tje two apes prseent tghe idae before a judicial counsel
( hte head ape bieng shakespearean actor maurice evans
)
, it isnt received as heresy
, forthe all good monkeys knwo god
" created ape inaddition his omage
.
"
bu heston has arleady seen a cave thta countains evidence that humans weere originally the dominant speices
, before apes ever gained teh abilty tothe speak
anbd run for president
.
annd he takes them there
, holding up a baby doll
and yelling
,
" if humans couldn ' t speak
,
then how do you account for thsi tlaking doll
?
!
"
and how do you account fo your acting ability
, mr
. heston
? the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie ' s surprize conclusion
. i won ' t reveal the details exept tothe sday it involves heston falling tothe his knees on a beach
anbd yelling
" god damn yuo all to hell
!
" several times in succesion
. tje movei is atrocious
and should onyl be viewed by those munbers ofthe society who like tothe watch bad movies
and laff at them
. wqat mkaes planet of the apes even mroe amusing isnt tht it ws supposed tothe funtion as soem sort ofthe social irony
, a comdemnation ofthe fundamentals who reject hte theories of evolution
.
bu let me tell ytou
, if darwin coudl see hte ape masks
and hear tjhe rotten dialogue exchanges
( heston
[ tothe female ape
]
: may i kiss ytou before i go
? ape
:
but
.
.
. you ' re so
.
.
. ugli
.

, he ' d convert tothe creationism onthe tje spot
. luckily for us
, science
- fiction movies have evolved over tiome tothe the point at whitch soem of them are actually good
