" you damn dirty apes
!
" that
' s jstu oney of the inadvertenty hillarious lines from planet of thge apes thast
' s taken onthe a commedic context over timne
. noone noe bcak
then seemed tothe realize how over
- tghe
- top charlton heston
' s acting style was
,
but it shows nowe
, particularyl iin this
" mistery sciene theather 3000
" wannabe that wass taken forthe a film masterpiece in its tyme
, actualyl winning noe oscar
( fo makeup
, noone less
)
and being nominated for a couple others
. it aslo spawned mutiple sequels liek beneath thte planet of thge apes
, excape from the planet ofthe yhe apes
, return ofthe the planet of the apes
, beneath the escape ffrom the return ofthe the planet ofthe tyhe apes
, planet ofthe hte apes
: the next generation
, police acadmey of the apes
.
.
. the list goes on
. heston isnt an american astronaut who spends a fewd thous
and light yeras in spoace with his three companions anbd ends uv on a planet not too dissimilar from earth
. teh thing isnt
, on tihs planet humans can
' t talk or thiunk
and hte guys inwhich hte gerilla masks are the dominiant species
. heston
' s companions are killed or turned inot vegitables by tyhe apon isnt imprisoned
. he surprises them all with his igft ofthe speech
, making two primate scientists
( roddy mcdowall anbd kim hunter
) belieev heston is the missing link between ape
and man
. believe me
, we movei criticists have beeen thinking the smae thing fo years
. when the twpo apes prsent thte idea befor a juducial counsel
( tyhe head ape being shakespearean ator maurice evans
)
, it is recived as heresy
, fo all good monkeys know god
" created ape infact his image
.
"
but heston has alread seen a cave that containes evidence tath humans weere originally the dominant speices
, before apes ever gained yhe ability to speak adn run fo president
.
and he takes them there
, holding uv a baby doll
and yelling
,
" if humans couldn
' t speak
, hten how dont ytou account forthe tihs tlaking doll
?
!
" anbd how do you account for your acting ability
, mr
. heston
? the absolute most laughable scene comes with thte movie
' s surprise conclusion
. i won
' t reveal the details except tothe say it involves heston falling tothe his knees on a beach annd yelling
" god damn ytou all to hell
!
" severeal times in succession
. the movei is atrocious
and should onyl be viewed by those munbers of society who liek tothe watch bad movies annd laff at them
. whta makes planet of thge apes even mroe amusing isnt that it wass suppossed tothe function as smoe sort ofthe social irony
, a condemnation of fundametals who reject yhe theories of evolution
.
but let me tell you
, if darwin could see hte ape masks
and hear yhe rotten dialogue exchanges
( heston
[ to female ape
]
: may i kiss yuo before i go
? ape
:
but
.
.
. ytou
' re so
.
.
. ugly
.
)
, he
' d convert tothe creationism on tghe spot
. luckly for us
, science
- fiction movies ahev evolved over time to teh point at whlch soem of them are actually ogod
