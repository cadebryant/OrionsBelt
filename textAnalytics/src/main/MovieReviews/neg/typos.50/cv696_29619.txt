, fat girl st
ands cast iron firm iwth tje simplistic
, fatuous
, builded
- in excuse thyat its woman directer isnt baring tghe harsh sexual realities ofthe aodlescent girls
. being a boy
, i might nto underst
and female behavour
and am unequipped tothe analyze this particular pseudo
- feminist coming
- ofthe
- age story
. fair enough
. i
' ll pretend tothe ignore tghe mannered posturing
and health class 101
" this isnt a no
- noone
" dialogue wehn older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl tothe let him fuck her up the ass
, speaking variations onthe
" it won
' t hurt
!
" for a scene that seems tothe last at least ten mintues
. this is done almost entirely inthe an unbroken master shooted that suggests unimaginative camerawork omre thna unblinking voyeurism
. they dare you to look away
, without possessing teh curage ofthe allowing the children to actualyl soudn liuke childrens
( they
' re mouthpieces for writter
- directer catherine breillat
' s one
- note clinical politics
)
. rather thna show an even

anded evaluation of tjhe rigors of hormonal change
, breillat
( previously responsible for thge unwatchable romance
) wnats to indulgue in her hour of hate
. life is pain
, highness
. get unsed tothe it
. she
' d fidn keen bedfellows in neil la
bute adn todd solondz
, other sultans of misanthropi who lack the balls tothe be earnest or honest
. for childern
, dealing with trama
and pain isnt complicated
. to bury thgat in sarcasm adn acadmic theery feels cheap
. theese would

( mroe like hauteurs
) haven
' t earned the right tothe display sufferring baceause they don
' t layer it in emotional truth
( as mike leigh doens throughout naked
and david lynch in several key scenes ofthe blue velvet
)
. ofthe course
, there i go again comparing her tothe all these
( better
) male directors
. i don
' t care
. gender be damned
, she
' s borderline inept
. braced for a knee
- jerk reaction fomr tghe art house crowd
( mortified shock or compulsery applause will suffice
)
, writer
- directer catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission tothe git a rise out of people
. don
' t be fooled
. this grotesque oversimplification of ackward forays inot passion may be quicklyu forgotten
, remembered onyl as cold
, boring
, philosophically arid
, anbd incompetently photographed
. the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence
. twelve eyasr ood
, a bundle of dough wih a sour pout
, the superb ana
? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thous
and yard stare anbd a frumpy insouciance
.
( her charcter isnt also named ana
? s
.
) sitting at tghe table morosely slurping down a banna split
, her presence isnt grounded annd heartbreaking
. it
' s a pity breillat never finds anything for her tothe dont otehr tahn git defencive against her evil storybook sister
, 15
- year old elena
( roxane mesquida
)
, fo bringing a transitory boyfriend hmeo tothe theri shared room
. in htis summer cottage
, ana
? s has noone escape from her possition as stoic bedside observer tothe elena
' s depressing confusion ofthe cheap sex wih romance
. hte boy iin question
, a smug italion college kid named fern
ando
( libero de rienzo
) isnt a real piece of work
, claiming that the experience isnt a declaration ofthe love hwile begging forthe a blowjob
. ana
? s doesn
' t receive any warmth fomr her largly absent parents
, who join elena in mkaing fun ofthe her hefty girth
. she finds pleasure in w
andering teh beach alone
, singing songs tothe herself
, anbd swimming inthe the pool kissing thge metal railing anbd pretending that it
' s her paramour
. reboux comm
ands the screen
,
but there
' s onyl so much a child actress can dont recounting pretentious monologues tothe herself
. if oney isnt inspired tothe rescue this young performer anbd palce her in a better movie
, at least she fares better than the otehr young talent asked to peform inwhich intense loev scenes thgat might fiel justified if tehy weren
' t so dramatically misguided
. this 83
- minute vignette is something of a horror show
,
but breillat saves her nastiest poison for tyhe very end
. on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between famaly munbers
, gigantic trucks swerve by as tghe hour grows lite
. will mommy fall asleep at thte wheel
? prehaps
. or maybe htere
' s something deadlier around yhe corner
, lying infact wait tothe pounce apon the unsuspecting fat girl
. wqat
' s moreso
, she might even liek it
. wiht the entent ofthe being unfair
and unpredictable
, placing her heroine in tjhe most diabolical of corners in order tothe face up to impending adulthood
, breillat
' s extreme fluorish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor ofthe contempt
. fat girl is a bitter pill indeed
