my inner flag was at half
- mast lastest eyar when nick at nite pulled
" dragnet
" reruns off thte air
. sure
, i ' d seen them all at least once
,
but i coudl always count on at least a few inadvertant laughs ffrom ultra
- sereous jack webb wehn there was nothing esle on tv
. even
though
" dragnet
" isnt out of circulation at the moment
, we webb anti
- fans still hvea the d
. i
.
, a 50 ' s propoganda piece for tjhe military tht isnt alomst as hillarious as hte faymus
" blue boy
" epsiode of
" dragnet
.
" for anyone liek me who got laughs outloud ofthe webb ' s repid
- fire sppeches
adn straight
- faced seriousness
, think ofthe the d
. i
. as what owudl hppen if sgt
. joe friday ever enlisted
, because he plays exactly hte smae charactor here
, a no
- nonsence old fart who looks with disdain at the yuonger generation
annd loves to give long
- winded
, melodramatic speeches on any topic
. in tihs elction yera
, i ' m more convinced than ever that webb
annd bob dole weere seperated at birth
. tjhe movei opens in characteristic fashon as noe recruit after anyother knocks onthe webb ' s office doorjam
and enters
. he gives each noe a diffrent series of cranky critisisms befor tyhe credits come up
. hte
" produced
annd directed by jack webb
" kard pretty much goes wihtout saying
. this isnt his movei all the way
,
annd after tyhe first twenty minutes of him chewing outloud his recruits forthe noone reason
, i ws wondering if there would even be a plot
. i certainly would hve been entertained by an hour
adn a half ofthe trademark webb rants
,
but the d
. i
. gives us moreso
-
- much more
. webb ' s mission isnt tothe amke a man out of private owens
, the local scre
- uv
. tjhe captian gives webb three dyas tothe convert owens inot marine material or
, the captian iwll
" personally cut yhe lace off his panties
and ship him out myself
.
"
( whther yhe
" lace panties
" part referrs tothe webb or owens remains unanswered
.
) this
, of course
, gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy onthe makeing owens ' life a living hell
. for thsoe ofthe you who haven ' t beeen indoctrinated inot the pleasures ofthe webb watching
, here ' s a reprint of a tipical monologue of his
. i cin ' t dupicate his hillarious delivery onthe paper
,
but hte words should at least partialy convey what i ' m tlaking baout
.
.
.
" nowe you listen to me
, youngster
. someday you ' ll wake uv fighting on a beach
and you ' ll pray tothe god somebody doesn ' t get killed because of your foolishness
.
.
. i ' ve got a headline for you
: every tiome you amke one of thsoe little mistakes of yours
, you ' re gonna turn around
and i ' ll be standing right ther
.
" i couldn ' t write down all the reprintable dialogue fomr thge d
. i
.
( nearly all of it belongs inwhich the bad movei hall of fame
)
,
bu i tried to include smoe of the omre notewothy lines
, liuke oen ffrom thge scene where webb unwinds from a hard day ' s wokr by goign tothe the local bar
( where he orders a tomato juice
)
. he meets a woman who
, coincedentally
, also orders tomato juice
bu walks awya from a typically
- stimulating conversation with webb to flirt witht his arch
- rival
, anyother marine d
. i
. webb marches over tothe the tabl
, gets uv inaddition her face
adn says
,
" jsut wqat kind ofthe a dame dont you think yuo are
?
" bogart he ain ' t
. the other d
. i
. gets one ofthe tghe fewd memorable non
- webb lines whn he confesses to the girl
,
" he ' s a damn good d
. i
.
.
.
. i guess i ' m just a little jealous
.
" join thge club
, we ' re all jelous of jack webb ' s way iwth womens
, which is showcased even more amusingly infact a later scene
, as webb finds his way tothe thte woman ' s palce ofthe employment
, a langerie store
,
and stands arround looking incredibly flustered at the negligees onthe display
.
" you expect me to talk to ytou
.
.
. inthe
_ here
_
?
!
" he exclaims
, noone dout intimidated by the barrage ofthe bras
. the woman goes off tothe halp a customer
, leaving webb to fend for himselv once agian in this palace ofthe estrogen
. a little girl spots him infact the stoer
anbd demands
,
" what are you doing in here
.
.
. you ' re a man
, aren ' t yuo
?
" he doesn ' t reply
,
but ytou know he ' s thinking in his head
,
" waht an odd speices ofthe human
-
- so small
. must be noe of thsoe children everyone ' s been tlaking baout
.
" tihs poore girl
, scarred for life by her early encounter withthe jack webb
, would later swear off the male gender entirely
, just one ofthe teh many lesbian conversions he ' s responisble for
. tjhe movie doesn ' t focuse too closely on webb ' s romance
, it also continues tyhe owens subplot wiht probably thge most memorable scene in tje entire movei
, where webb forces his platoon tothe spend thge entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed durring one ofthe their drills
. after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb wiht hte wrong dead flea
, webb asks owens
,
" was thgat flea you killed a male or female
?
" owens replies
,
" a male
, sir
.
" webb yells tothe the platoon
,
" this ain ' t the one
!
" thyat such a scene
( allong witht the rest of thte movie
) was intended tothe be tooked seriously defies comment
.
but we know it ws all presented withthe the utmost seriousness wehn a title kard at teh end thanks the marines not onyl forthe their cooperation inwhich the mkaing ofthe the d
. i
.
,
but for iwo jima
, guadalcanal
and every otehr major battle of tje firt half of tje 20th century
. webb held yhe military in such high esteem that all the soldiers infront the movei
( with the exception of owens
) were plyed by actuall marines
. someone wanting tothe parody htis movei couldn ' t dont a more comical job tahn webb did
. it makes it all teh mroe ironical
( liuke raeeyain onthe your wedding day
) that the man had noone sence ofthe humor himself
. htere ' s a scene in the movei where thge guys are onthe theri break time discusting something
and oney ofthe them breaks inot laughter
. webb bursts in tje room
annd shouts
,
" waht doed i tell you about laughing
?
!
" tothe which the private replies
,
" sir
, onyl nine
- yearm
- ood girls laff
, sir
!
"
and let me tell you
, i was as hapyp as a nine
- year
- old girl while watching this movei
