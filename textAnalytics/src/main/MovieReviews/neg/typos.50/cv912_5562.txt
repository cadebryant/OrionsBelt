my inner flag ws at half
- mast lastest year wehn nick at nite pulled
" dragnet
" reruns off the air
. sure
, i
' d seen them all at least once
, bu i sould always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs ffrom ultra
- sereous jack webb when there was nothing else onthe tv
. even
though
" dragnet
" is outloud of circulation at teh moent
, we webb anti
- fans still haev thge d
. i
.
, a 50
' s propog
anda piece fo tyhe military thgat isnt alomst as hilarious as the famous
" blue boy
" episode ofthe
" dragnet
.
" fo anyone liek me who got laughs outloud of webb
' s repid
- fier speeches anbd straight
- faced seriousness
, tihkn ofthe hte d
. i
. as what would ahppen if sgt
. joe friday ever enlisted
, beacuse he plays exactly yhe smae charactor here
, a no
- nonsence old fart who looks with disdain at tje younger generation anbd loves tothe give long
- winded
, melodramatic speeches onthe any topic
. inwhich this election yearm
, i
' m more conviced tahn ever taht webb anbd bob dole were separated at birth
. the movie opens inaddition characteristic fashon as oney recruit after anyother knocks onthe webb
' s office doorjam annd enters
. he gives each one a differant series of cranky critisisms before the credits come uv
. tje
" produced annd directed by jack webb
" card preety much goes wihtout saying
. this is his movei all hte way
, adn aftter the first twenty minutes of him chewing outloud his recruits forthe noone reason
, i was wondering if there woudl even be a plot
. i certainly would hvae been entertained by an hour
and a half ofthe trademark webb rants
,
but teh d
. i
. gives us more
-
- much more
. webb
' s mission is to make a man outloud ofthe private owens
, tyhe local scre
- uv
. thge captain gives webb threee days tothe convert owens into marine material or
, the captian wiull
" personaly cut tje lace off his panties
and ship him outloud myself
.
"
( whether tjhe
" lace panties
" part refrers to webb or owens remeniss unanswered
.
) thsi
, of course
, gives webb an excuse to focuse all his crotchety energy on making owens
' life a living hell
. for those of ytou who haven
' t beeen indoctrinated into teh pleasures of webb watching
, here
' s a reprint of a typcial monologue of his
. i cxan
' t dupicate his hillarious delivery onthe pappr
, bu hte words should at least partialy convey what i
' m tlaking about
.
.
.
" nowe you listen tothe me
, youngster
. someday yuo
' ll wake uv fighting on a beach anbd yuo
' ll pray to god somebody doesn
' t get killed because ofthe your foolishness
.
.
. i
' ve got a headline for you
: eveyr tiem ytou make oney of thsoe littel mistakes ofthe yours
, you
' re gonna turn around
and i
' ll be st
anding right there
.
" i couldn
' t wriet down all the reprintable dialogue from the d
. i
.
( nearly all ofthe it belongs in the bad movei hall of fame
)
,
but i tryed tothe include smoe ofthe thge moreso noteworthy lines
, liek one fomr the scene where webb unwinds fomr a hard day
' s wokr by going to yhe local bar
( where he orders a tomato juice
)
. he meets a woman who
, coincidentally
, also orders tomato juice bu walks awya fomr a typically
- stimulating conversation with webb tothe flirt with his arch
- rival
, another marine d
. i
. webb marchs over to tje table
, gets uv inwhich her face anbd syas
,
" just what kind of a dame dont you think you are
?
" bogart he ain
' t
. the other d
. i
. gets one of the few memorable non
- webb lines wehn he confesses tothe teh girl
,
" he
' s a damn good d
. i
.
.
.
. i guess i
' m jstu a littel jelous
.
" join the club
, we
' re all jealous of jack webb
' s way iwth women
, which is showcased even moreso amusingly in a later scene
, as webb finds his way to thge woman
' s palce of employment
, a langerie stroe
,
and st
ands arround looking incredibly flustered at tyhe negligees on display
.
" ytou expect me to talk to ytou
.
.
. in
_ here
_
?
!
" he exclaims
, no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras
. teh woman goes off tothe halp a customer
, leaving webb to fend fo himself once again iin this palace of estrogen
. a littel girl spots him infront thge store
and dem
ands
,
" what are ytou doign inwhich here
.
.
. yuo
' re a man
, aren
' t ytou
?
" he doesn
' t reply
, bu yuo know he
' s thingking iin his head
,
" wqat an odd speices of human
-
- so small
. must be noe of those children everyone
' s been tlaking baout
.
" tihs poor girl
, scarred for life by her easly encounter whith jack webb
, woudl later swear off the male gender entirely
, just one of thge many lesbian conversions he
' s responsible for
. tghe movei doesn
' t focuse too closley on webb
' s romance
, it aslo continues tjhe owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene inthe the entire movie
, where webb forces his platoon tothe spend tyhe entire night searching tghe ground fo a flea owens killed during one ofthe their drills
. after two privates hatch a scheme tothe preesnt webb with hte wrong dead flea
, webb asks owens
,
" ws that flea ytou killed a male or female
?
" owens replies
,
" a male
, sir
.
" webb yells tothe the platoon
,
" this ain
' t tjhe one
!
" thta such a scene
( allong iwth thge rest of thge movei
) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment
.
but we knwo it wass all presented with the upmost seriousness wehn a title kard at the end thanks hte marines nto onyl forthe thier coorperation inaddition tyhe making ofthe thte d
. i
.
, bu forthe iwo jima
, guadalcanal annd every otehr major battle ofthe the first half ofthe the 20th centruy
. webb held teh military inspite such high esteem taht all the soldiers in hte movei
( wtih hte exception of owens
) were played by actuall marines
. somone wanting to parody this movei couldn
' t dont a omre comical job thna webb doed
. it makes it all the mroe ironical
( liuke raeeyain onthe your wedding day
) thyat teh man had noone sence ofthe humer himselv
. there
' s a scene in thge movei where the guys are onthe thier break time discussing something
and one ofthe them breaks into laughter
. webb bursts inspite the room
and shouts
,
" what did i tell you about laughing
?
!
" tothe which the private replies
,
" sir
, only nine
- yearm
- old girls laugh
, sir
!
"
and let me tell ytou
, i was as happy as a nine
- year
- ood girl while watching tihs movei
