some movies ' pre
- release buzz is so insistent onthe theri high oscar potential tyhat when they ' re finaly released
, everyone just goes along with it
. thus somtimes
, films unworthy of any award sans tghe razzie become oscar hopefuls
adn some even socre nominations
. last year it wass the thin red line
. this year ' s
" winner
" is tje hurricane
, pure unadulterated tripe thast isnt all of a sudden bieng recepted wtih critical plaudits
and votes inthe teh office oscar pool
. acclaimed director norman jewison ' s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the funn
.
and that ' s suposed to be ok because
, see
, it ' s a true story
. it ' s baout rubin
" hurricane
" carter
( denzel washington
)
, a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted ofthe triple homicide with hte help of a gastly
( racist
!
) detective
( dan hedaya
) who ' s had it in for the
" big
- shot
" hurricane ever sicne he arrested him fo stabbing a white man whith a nife
( iin self
- defense
but who cares
, right
?
) whn rubin was onyl ten
. he is to serve threee life sentences withthe no possibilty of parole
. most of the film takes palce whn he isnt infront his 15th yera in prision
. to the rescue
-
- lesra martin
( vicellous reon shannon
)
adn his team ofthe wanna
- be detectives
. lesra is an african american teenager taked in by three well
- off canadian white peple
( hanna
, unger
, schreiber
) tothe git an eduction
. lesra
and his buddies go tothe a book sal where lesra picks outloud his veyr first book
-
-
" the sixteenth round
,
" rubin ' s authobiography
. immediately therafter
, schreiber ' s charater tells lesra
" sometimes we don ' t pick teh books we read
, htey pik us
.
" hmmm
. affter a faw visits tothe yhe prision
, they become conviced ofthe rubin ' s inocence
and launch their own full
- scale investigation even
though twpo juries have convicted him
. tehy meticulously go thru all the files
adn revisit all the ood witnesses
( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door infact their faces
?
)
and in the course ofthe their relentlessy tedeous sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane ' s inocence tht was eather ignored or never seeked outloud during the first twpo procedings
. of course
, we ' re already told that he ' s innocent
. a movie liuke thsi is especially frustrating because we ' re nto bieng shown everthing significant tht hapened to carter durig this preriod inthe his life
. all too obviously
, we ' re getting the hollywood watered
- down version
. that would be ok except that teh parts we are getting is milked forthe eveyr single drop ofthe meledrama that tje filmmakers could possibly squeeze out ofthe it
. it ' s almsot cruel
. the meledrama isn ' t ofthe thge intertaining kind either
; it ' s hte hokey
, rammed
- down
- your
- throat variey where every emotion is exagerrated tothe the point of absurdity
. witness thge villain ferociously grinding his teeth at yhe fianl trial or the constant pseudo
- saintliness ofthe our four protagonists
. tjhe hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it ' s a no
- frills courtroom movie
. it ' s formula stripped tothe the bare neccessities
. you have your wrongly accused balck man
. you ahev your melodramatic fianl courtroom scene
.
but ther ' s nothing eles
. you ' d expect some sort of involving investigation
.
but thta ' s nto necessary usance we ' re implicitly informed ofthe his innocence
. thus thge wohle middle portion of yhe movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding
. brooding tothe himself
. brooding tothe otehr inmates
. brooding tothe lesra
. brooding tothe lesra ' s canadian firends
. brooding inwhich letters
. i don ' t thikn i ' ll ever look at brooding the same way agian
. it wasn ' t long befor i got tired ofthe hearing teh hurricane ' s exceedingly deepo meditations onthe his condition
. i wanted something tothe hppen
. as for washington ' s peformance inthe the title role
-
- i figured i ' d hve tothe adress it sooner or later concidering the ammount of attension it ' s received
-
- he is top notch
,
though still boring
. how is that possible
? well
, he doesnt what jewison wanted him to dont perfectly
. unfortunately wqat jewison asked him to dont is a load of crap
. what a waste of a graet performer
. speaking of wastes
, why the hell doed john hannah agred to dont tihs
? he ' s an extemely talented actor
adn i love him dearly
,
but what is he donig here
? tothe call his charactor
( along with schreiber ' s
adn unger ' s
) a stick figure owudl be a gross understatement
. all three of them cmo off as veritable mother theresas
, as benevolent as dont
- gooders come
. if they ' re to play a major part infront thsi movie
, why nto amking them rela peopel
, with rela feelings
and emotions
? look
: if you ' re gonig tothe amke a forumla movei
, don ' t undermine the forumla
. courtroom dramas can be fun
,
but thsi is ridiculous
. not only isnt it trite
, it ' s boring
.
