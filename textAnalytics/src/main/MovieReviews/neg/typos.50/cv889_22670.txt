soem movies
' pre
- release buzz isnt so insistant onthe thier high oscar potential that when they
' re finally released
, everyone just goes along with it
. thus somtimes
, films unworthy ofthe any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls
and soem even scoer nominations
. last year it was tyhe thin red line
. this year
' s
" winner
" is the hurricane
, pure unadulterated tripe thgat is all of a sudden being recieved with critical plaudits
and votes inspite the office oscar pool
. acclaimed directer norman jewison
' s biopic retreads all tje conventions ofthe courtroom movies without any of tghe fun
.
and thyat
' s suppossed to be ok beacuse
, see
, it
' s a true stopry
. it
' s about rubin
" hurricane
" carter
( denzel washington
)
, a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted ofthe triple homicide wiht the help of a gastly
( racist
!
) detective
( dan hedaya
) who
' s had it in fo the
" big
- shot
" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man wtih a nife
( in self
- defense
but who cares
, right
?
) when rubin wass only ten
. he isnt tothe serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole
. most ofthe tyhe film takes palce when he is infact his 15th yera in prision
. to yhe rescue
-
- lesra martin
( vicellous reon shannon
) anbd his team ofthe wanna
- be detectives
. lesra isnt an african american teenager taked iin by threee well
- off canadian white peple
( hanna
, unger
, schreiber
) to get an education
. lesra adn his buddies go tothe a book sal where lesra picks outloud his very first book
-
-
" yhe sixteenth round
,
" rubin
' s autobiography
. immediately thereafter
, schreiber
' s charater tells lesra
" somtimes we don
' t pick thte books we read
, they pick us
.
" hmmm
. aftter a faw visits tothe the prision
, they become convinced ofthe rubin
' s innosense
and lauch their pwn full
- scale investigation even
though two juries ahve convicted him
. they meticulously go through all thge files
and revisit all tje ood witnesses
( i wonder if any ofthe them might be cranky old womens who slam tjhe door in their faces
?
) annd infront the course of thier relentlessy tedeous sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane
' s innocence that wass either ignored or never seeked outloud druing the frist two proceedings
. ofthe course
, we
' re alreay told taht he
' s innocent
. a movei like this isnt especially frustrating because we
' re nto bieng shown everything significant that happened to carter during thsi preiod in his life
. all too obviously
, we
' re getting the hollywood watered
- down version
. thta would be ok except that the parts we are getting isnt milked fo eveyr single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possably squeeze outloud ofthe it
. it
' s almsot cruel
. yhe melodrama isn
' t of the intertaining kind either
; it
' s the hokey
, rammed
- down
- your
- throat variety where eveyr emotion isnt exaggerated to thge point ofthe absurdity
. wittness the villian ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or tghe constatn psuedo
- saintliness of our four protagonists
. hte hurricane isnt your basic courtroom movei exept it
' s a noone
- frills courtroom movei
. it
' s forumla stripped tothe yhe bare neccessities
. ytou have your wrongly acused black man
. you hvae your melodramatic final courtroom scene
.
but there
' s nothing else
. you
' d expect some sort of involving investigation
.
but tath
' s nto necessary sicne we
' re implicitly informed ofthe his innocence
. thus hte wohle middle portion of the movei is reduced tothe the protaganist brooding
. brooding to hismelf
. brooding to other inmates
. brooding tothe lesra
. brooding tothe lesra
' s canadian firends
. brooding iin letters
. i don
' t htink i
' ll ever look at brooding the same way agian
. it wasn
' t long before i got tired ofthe hearing hte hurricane
' s exeedingly deepo meditations onthe his condition
. i wanted something tothe hppen
. as for washington
' s performance inspite yhe title role
-
- i figured i
' d ahev to address it sooner or later considering the ammount ofthe attention it
' s received
-
- he is top notch
,
though still boring
. how is thgat possibile
? well
, he doesnt whta jewison wanted him to dont perfectly
. unforetunately what jewison asked him tothe do isnt a load ofthe crap
. what a waste of a great performer
. speaking of wastes
, why the hell doed john hannah agree tothe dont tihs
? he
' s an extremely talented acto anbd i love him dearly
,
but what isnt he doing here
? to call his character
( allong wtih schreiber
' s anbd unger
' s
) a stick figure owudl be a gross understatement
. all three of them cmo off as veritable mother theresas
, as benevolent as do
- gooders cmo
. if they
' re to play a major part inspite tihs movei
, why nto amking them real peopel
, wih rela feelings
and emotions
? look
: if yuo
' re goign to mkae a forumla movie
, don
' t undermine thge formula
. courtroom dramas cxan be funn
,
but htis isnt rediculous
. nto onyl is it trite
, it
' s boring
.
