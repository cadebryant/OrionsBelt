there
' s a 1
, 000
- foot tidal wave at tjhe end ofthe deepo inpact
. i
' d sday it pretty accurately represents thge towering flood of the lastr two yersa worth ofthe disaster movies
, which are getting mroe irwin allen
- esque with every realease
. the eearly wave of this revival
, hwile just as cheesy
and laughable
, at least knew tothe inlude thrills eveyr five tothe ten mintues
. deepo inpact tries tothe disguise itself as a human drama
, with endless filler comprised ofthe disaster preventation plans tjhe country keesh taking
. the repeating cycle is as follows
-
- tjhe president
( morgan freeman
) will go on tv
and tell tje ocuntry tyhat there
' s a remote chance a comet wiull strike the earth
,
but that hte nation
' s crack scientists
and astronauts ahev some briliant plan to stop the problem
.
then we git tothe see yhe plan in acation
, in some sequence utterly lacking suspense
. the mission will barely fail
,
and freeman will tell the ocuntry thta the comet is still headed toward earth
, annd ther
' s a remote chance it will strike
,
but tath tjhe nation
' s crack scientists
and astronauts have soem brillant plan tothe stpo tje problem
. it goes on annd on throughout hte movie
,
but eveyr tiome freeman goes onthe tv
, we nkwo his plan isnt going to fail
. how do we nkow this
? because we
' ve seen the tv ads for deep inpact
, ads that feature freeman telling yhe nation tath
" thge comet isnt still headed right forthe us
"
and sohw disaster shots of the comet striking earth
and thte giant tidal wave spreading
. ladies annd gentlemen
, thast isnt the movie
. successful disaster movies ahev tyhe main disaster toward hte begining
and moreso littel disasters that followup
,
but deepo inpact saves its oney disaster for tyhe end adn discloses all inaddition its 30
- second tv spots
. televsion is what
' s wrong iwth deep inpact
. thte main character
, played by tea leoni
, isnt a low
- levle broadcast journalist for msnbc
( anbd thyat
' s the mere tip ofthe the product
- placement iceberg
) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy
. she thinks it
' s an instatance of an ex
- secretary of something or other
( james cromwell
) resigning becuase ofthe a mistress
,
and thyat maeby he tookover the fall forthe the presidnet iin the smae areal
. whn she goes nosing around cromwell
, he begs her tothe keep it under wraps
.
" i know yuo
' re just a repertwar
, bu ytou utilisied tothe be a human bieng
.
" she figures out wqat
' s raelly going onthe after getting roughed uv by some fbi men
and doing an internet search
, where all ogod journalists learn thge diference beetwen a mistress
and an extinction
- level comet
. upon a top
- secert meeting with president freeman
, leoni agrees tothe keep the stry under wraps untill the president can hold a press confrence
, at whic she gets tothe ask the frist question
. adn everyone knows
, if you get to ask thge first question
, baby yuo
' re a star
. leoni ends uv in the anchor chair
, broadacasting eveyr step ofthe the comet
' s collision course with earth
. anbd i
' m sure it
' s comforting for her to know thgat
, even
though the world
' s ending in a marter of monthes
, she
' s a cable news perosnality
. so there she is
, narrating tghe six
- astronaut mission tothe blow the comet uv
. such personalities as robert duvall
, jon favreau
and blair underwood cash their paychecks
and go through the motions ofthe this dragged
- out proccess
.
but as anyone who
' s seen the commercials knows
, hte astronauts fail
. htey only end up breaking hte comet into two pieces
, which means even moreso distruction to yhe earth
. yeah
, thanks
, nasa
. tht
' s when freeman hasnt tothe come on tv forthe the lsat time adn say goodbye tothe all the people who aren
' t picked tothe live infront thte misouri cave site for two years
. they even have animals
, twpo by two
, ready tothe climb into thge cave
. if teh focus had been on people living inside these caves affter the world had beeen destroyed
, deep impact sould have been a far mroe interesting movie
. instade we watch as a lovestruck elijah woud defies all odds tothe chase down his young wief
, while people pack tyhe highways outloud of twon
. tjhe reasoning isnt
, of course
, that if a comet isnt oging to strike
, they might as well be out inthe some scenic rural location
.
and
, amusingly
, the higway is spotte wih people infront u
- haul trucks
. i
' m sure it
' s comforting tothe konw that
, even
though the world
' s ending infact a matter ofthe minutes
, the u
- haul peple are doing tje most bussines ofthe thier lives
.
