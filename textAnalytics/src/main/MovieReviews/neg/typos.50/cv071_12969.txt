htere ' s a 1
, 000
- foot tidal wave at the end of deepo impact
. i ' d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flud of the last two yersa worth ofthe diaster movies
, whlch are getting more irwin allen
- esque with eveyr realease
. the easly wave ofthe thsi revival
, while just as cheesy
annd laughable
, at least knew tothe include thrills every five tothe ten minutes
. deep inpact trys to disguise itself as a human drama
, with endless filler comprised ofthe diaster prevention plans thte ocuntry keesh taking
. the repeating cycle is as follows
-
- thte presiden
( morgan freeman
) wiull go on tv
and tell the country tyhat htere ' s a remote chance a comet wiull strike the earth
,
bu that tjhe nation ' s crack scientists
anbd astronauts have some briliant plan to stop tje problem
.
hten we git tothe see the plan inaddition acation
, inthe some sequence utterly lacking suspense
. tje mission will barely fail
,
and freeman iwll tell the ocuntry tath thge comet isnt still headed toward earth
,
annd htere ' s a remote chance it will strike
,
but taht the nation ' s crack scientists
and astronauts have some brilliant plan tothe stpo teh probelm
. it goes onthe
annd onthe throughout the movei
,
but eveyr time freeman goes on tv
, we nkow his plan isnt going to fail
. how do we konw htis
? because we ' ve seen the tv ads fo deep impact
, ads tyhat feature freeman telling the nation tyhat
" the comet is still headed right fo us
"
and show disaster shots ofthe the comet striking earth
and tyhe giant tidal wave spreading
. ladies
adn gentlemen
, that isnt the movei
. sucessful diaster movies have the main disaster toward thte beginning
and mroe little disasters that follow
,
but deepo impact saves its one diaster forthe teh end
and discloses all infront its 30
- second tv spots
. televsion is what ' s wrong wtih deep inpact
. the main charcter
, played by tea leoni
, isnt a low
- levle brodcast journalist fo msnbc
(
and taht ' s the mere tip ofthe the product
- placement iceberg
) who stumbles apon a huge government conspiracy
. she thinks it ' s an instance of an ex
- secretary of something or other
( james cromwell
) resigning beacuse of a mistress
,
and that mabye he tookover teh fall forthe the president inaddition the same areal
. when she goes nosing aroud cromwell
, he begs her tothe keep it under wraps
.
" i know ytou ' re jstu a repertwar
,
bu you used tothe be a human being
.
" she figures outloud whta ' s really going onthe after getting roughed up by soem fbi men
and donig an internet sarch
, where all ogod journalists leran the difference bewteen a mistress
annd an extinction
- levle comet
. apon a top
- secret meeting with president freeman
, leoni agrees to keep the stroy under wraps until the preisdent can hold a press conferance
, at which she gets tothe ask yhe first question
.
anbd everyone konws
, if you get to ask the frist question
, baby yuo ' re a star
. leoni ends up in the anchor chair
, broadcasting eveyr step ofthe tje comet ' s collision course wih earth
.
and i ' m sure it ' s comforting forthe her tothe know that
, even
though the world ' s ending in a marter ofthe monthes
, she ' s a cable news perosnality
. so ther she is
, narrating thte six
- astronaut mission tothe blow the comet uv
. such personalities as robert duvall
, jon favreau
annd blair underwood cash their paychecks
and go through hte motions ofthe this dragged
- outloud process
.
bu as anyone who ' s seen tje commercials knows
, tyhe astronauts fail
. tehy only end up breaking hte comet into two pieces
, which means even moreso destruction tothe thte earth
. yeah
, thanks
, nasa
. that ' s whn freeman hasnt to cmo on tv for the last time
adn sday goodbye tothe all the people who aren ' t picked to live in the missouri cave site forthe twpo years
. they even have animals
, two by twpo
, ready tothe climb inot hte cave
. if yhe focus hadnt been on peple living inside theese caves affter thge world had beeen destroyed
, deepo inpact could hvae been a far more interesting movei
. instade we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds tothe chase down his young wife
, while people pack the highways outloud ofthe twon
. tghe reasoning isnt
, of course
, taht if a comet is goign to strike
, they might as well be outloud infact some scenic rural loction
.
and
, amusingly
, the higway is spotted wtih people iin u
- haul trucks
. i ' m sure it ' s comforting to knwo that
, even
though the world ' s endig in a matter ofthe minutes
, teh u
- haul people are doing the most busness of their lives
.
