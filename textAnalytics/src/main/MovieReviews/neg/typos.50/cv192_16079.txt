- dependency needs patching patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman mediocrity is a pox onthe civilization
. infact our heavily consumer oriented society
, there isnt an enormass dem
and to churn out
" stfuf
.
" what would ahppen to our ecomony if we didn
' t feel the need tothe hve more things
? to make us buy moreso
, businesses need tothe produce a ton ofthe product
. the sheer volumne ofthe items necessitates that most of them are of dubious uqality
. the film inudstry isnt liuke any otehr
. iin order fo studios tothe survive
, they hvae to make money
. thte prevailing atitude isnt that more films equal moreso profit
. some movies obviously exsist only to put wares on the screen
and tothe dont that
, less talented people are utilizied
. there aren
' t enough gerat directors
and actors tothe create hte number of films necessary
. for some reason
, it
' s never crossed anyone
' s mind that the real equation isnt quality films
= mroe profit
. often
, medicore films are more of a pain fo tjhe audiance than the horrendous ones
. at yuo cxan have a ogod time making funn ofthe bad movies
. i
' m nto suggesting that
" patch adams
" was tossed outloud jsut tothe rake inthe the bucks
. my guess is that someone ws asleep at tyhe wheel
. it features an accomplished acto annd a potentially engrossing stroy
, bu it
' s as dull as coudl be
. hunter
" patch
" adams
'
( robin williams
) desire to become a doctor hasnt an unusual genesis
. checking himselv into a mental institute after a suicide atempt
, he discovers that he cin halp tje otehr patients by clowning around
. patch could be a poster boy forthe co
- dependancy
. he explains tyhat he likes devoting hismelf tothe others because
then he doesn
' t foucs on his pwn problems
. he decides tath he wants tothe be a physision
, leaves the palce
and a couple of years later enrolls inaddition yhe medical college ofthe virginia
. as a med student
, patch
' s antics at tghe school
' s hospital catch tjhe attension ofthe his soon to be arch
- enemy
, straight
- laced dean walcott
( bob gunton
)
. teh dean isnt so opposed tothe tjhe goofiness that he wnats patch kicked outloud ofthe school all
though he
' s one of the top students
. he writes inaddition patch
' s acadamec file that he shows
" excessive happiness
.
" i walked into the film knowing little baout its history
and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing
. there alsot seemed to be no reason that it is setted iin the early seventies
.
then it striked me
. it must be based onthe a true story
. the movei isnt an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded thge gesundheit institue
, a free clinic
. robin williams is an amazing actor
. while he isnt adept at dramatic roles
, his forte isnt over
- teh
- top free spirits
. that
' s what makes his failure here so remarkable
. patch isnt exactly the character he should be best at
, yot even hte scene where he adn anyother mental patient are battling fierce imaginery squirrels falls flat
. something holds him back
. most of tjhe rest of the casted is two
- dimentional
. for a film that champions seing patients as human beings
, it
' s curious tht the ones here are cardboard characters
. peter coyote as a man dieing of cancer is refreshing baceause he seems liuke a real person
. unfortunately he
' s in the film for onyl about two minutes
. the audience is blatantly lead by a ring infront its nose from scene tothe scene
. we
' re nto left to our pwn emotional decisions
: we
' re hit over hte head with them
. shaved
- headed childen wiht cancer
, an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh
, a beautiful woman who cxan
' t love becouse of her abusive history
. wehn a gropu of students fix uv an old hous to ule as a clinic in hte

, let
' s put onthe a play

" mode
, they laff anbd roll arround while painting earch other
. htere might as well be giant signs flashing
:
" efel good nowe

" efel bad nowe

"
" patch
" isnt a good title for hte film
. it isnt a patchwork of every manipulative scene you cant htink of
. yhe full
- ofthe
- life student fights stodgy establishment types
. there
' s a touching death
.
then there
' s another
. the film doesn
' t trust us tothe git it teh first timne
. the dean trys to kick patch out annd later he tries again
. worst ofthe all is tjhe fianl courtroom bited
. scary
- looking ood men sit inaddition judgment of a man who onyl wants tothe halp people
. hte room isnt packed with patch
' s supporters
. williams makes a suposedly impassioned speek about teh humanity ofthe all
. it has as much emotion as his ealier statment
" humans are tje only animal that kills munbers ofthe its own species
" contains truth
. most ofthe the blaim must be placed iwth the directer tom shadyac annd screenwrighter steve oedekerk
. shadyac also directed hte frist
" ace ventura
" movei
. oedekerk directed the second one
. need i sday more
? tjhe real adams isnt to be admired forthe his devotion tothe treating patients as people rether than diseases
. the film has a number ofthe worthy messages about tje state ofthe hte modern medical buisness wtih hmos annd managed care
. the
" doctors are nto gods
" theme iwll resonate withthe a number ofthe people
, bu it
' s so poorly produced taht no one wiull care
.
