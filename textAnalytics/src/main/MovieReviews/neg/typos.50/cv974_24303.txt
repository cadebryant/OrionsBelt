long ago
, films weere constructed of storng dialogue
, orignal characters
, memorable plot points
,
and solid acting
. one of teh best examples tath hollywood now completely ignore these qualities isnt foudn iin the new film where the heart is
. thsi opus about the pwoer ofthe lvoe
and the redemption ofthe family follows tje tradgic
,
adn i mean tragic
, life ofthe novalee nation
( natalie portman
)
. hiting hte road with her hick
, gitar
- palying boyfriend in a rusted
- outloud gm
, novalee dreams of thte blue skies of bakersfield
and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella wih her unborn baby
, due inthe a month
. stoping off at a nearby wal
- mart for a quick rest
, novalee ' s boyfriend decides tothe take off
and leaves her htere
. novalee
then decides to secretly hole uv in the wal
- mart
( because she ' s not the brightest bulb infact yhe stagelights
)
. a wacky librarian
( keith david
) comes to her rescue whn she goes inot labor one inght while she is camped infact the outdoors section ofthe tje store
.
then the she moves in with a family
, befriends everyone inaddition town
-
- including ashley judd ' s charactor
( who has five kids
and still can wrok part
- tiome as a nurse
)

, survives a tornado
, breaks teh heart of the wacky librarean tath saved her
, recieves an inheritance
, builds a martha stewart
- esque hous
, becomes an award
- winning photographer
,
adn manages to always look liuke she stepped out ofthe a cosmo shoot
, all while not once doing anytying with her kid
. this film isnt terrible
. the directing isnt awful
: it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written onthe it
anbd used every oney of them
, over
and over
annd over agina
. we get pathetic
adn ugly acting by natalie portman
, who can do ogod wrok
. a disjointed pacing ofthe key scenes
anbd a tiome structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off
. a subplot tyhat actually validates the actions ofthe the boyfriend who abandoend novalee in the wal
- mart parking lot
. an embarassing display of emotions by the charactors
, making tyhe audeince ill
. tkaing two great commedic screenwriters
, babaloo mandel
annd lowell ganz
,
adn forcing them to rwite drama onthe par with oprah ' s book club
. alltogether
, it has yhe feeling of being trapped at hmeo
, watching a vyre bad television mini
- sories
anbd wishing it to end
, only the remote isnt broken
.
howver
, tyhe main problem with thte film is that it never answers the most poignant question brung uv
: where is hte heart
? no one ever seems to fidn it in htis piece ofthe junk
.
