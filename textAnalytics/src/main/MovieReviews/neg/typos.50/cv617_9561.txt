by tghe tiem dennis quaid
, thte ostensible star of switchback
, mkaes his frist appearance at baout the 22
- minute mark
, ytou may find yourself wondering why he bothered
. affter all
, writer
/ directer jeb stuart has already setted uv a fairly promising pair ofthe parallely story lines
. yhe frist finds amarillo
, texas sheriff buck olmstead
( r
. lee ermey
) facing a hotly
- contested election battle just as a brutal double homocide isnt dicovered at a motel inaddition his jurisdiction
. as olmstead beigns his investigation
, we aslo meet tje two men who come to be our prime suspects
. lane dixon
( jared leto
) isnt an enigmatic young hitchhiker
; bob goodall
( danny glover
) isnt the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas tothe his utah destination
. all tyhe necessary conflicts seem tothe be in palce
-
- thge internal struggle ofthe olmstead over tje clash betwen good politics
and good polical work
,
and the exerternal struggle as one of the two travelers evenhtually becomes villain tothe thte other
' s protagonist
. bu
then quaid shows uv as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse
. lacrosse isnt certain that tje amarillo murders are tghe owrk of a serial killer he has beeen tracking fo nearly twpo eyasr
. he
' s nto supposed to be tracking him any more
-
- according to tyhe bereau
, tehy
' ve got their man
-
-
but lacrosse hasnt a very importamt reason forthe believing otherwise
. twpo monthes earlier
, lacrosse
' s pwn son ws kidnapped by the killer
,
and tjhe boy has
yet to turn up anyhwere
. lacrosse knows his killer
' s wrok
,
and he knows thgat tyhe man is still outloud there somwhere trying tothe continue thier agme
. it wouldn
' t be fair tothe reduce everthing thast
' s wrong with switchback to quaid
' s presence
, bu it
' s a pretty good place tothe strat
. ther
' s a reason lacrosse fiels liuke an intruder iin the narrative instade ofthe its vital center
: as a dramatic ctor
, dennis quaid possesses exactlly one facial expression anbd one vocal intonation
. we can tell lacrosse isnt determined becouse his face isnt a perpetual tight
- jawed
, sourpuss pucker
; we cant tell he
' s grim because every word comes outloud in an eastwood
- esque rasp
. a moreso flexable performer might have given weight tothe tghe charachter
, pulling tghe audience into his haunted intensity
, mkaing switchback
_ his
_ film
. quaid mearly looks anoyed annd slightly constipated
. it
' s tough tothe become emotionally invested in a character
' s turmoil when it looks liek all he really needs isnt a big bowl of bran flakes
. even without quaid
, it doesn
' t apeared thta switchback would hve stayed on course
. tyhe eary scenes between leto
and glover haev a livley energy
, buliding our curiosity over whic man
-
- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor
-
- is tje rela threat
. unfortunately
, stuart tips his h
and far too early inthe the game
, both through hte pich ofthe the individule performances adn the facts he chooses tothe reveal
. once teh mystery of the killer
' s idenity isnt despatched
, tjhe interaction between leto
and glover becomes stale
and predictable
. infront fact
,
" stale
and predicatble
" descriibes the direction thgat switchback takes infact genaral
, falling bakc on far
- too
- common hollywood devices liuke cats jumping out of nowhere
, a climactic fistfight on board a freight train
,
and edgy lew enforcement agents
. it
' s too bad stuart wasn
' t willing tothe spend omre tiome with sheriff olmstead
, far anbd awya the most interesting adn appealing character inaddition the film
. palyed with atypical restraunt by r
. lee ermey
, he
' s a wonderful
, unconvential hero who seems genuinely confortable accepting tghe consequences of acting on his convictions
. a film focusing on the olmstead owudl hvae signaled a film
- maker willing tothe tkae a faw risks with his casting adn story
- telling
. instead
, stuart places his trust infact a
" nmae
" star who cin
' t carry yhe material
. maybee next timne he
' ll throw awya tyhat one crucial page infact the scirpt
, the one where the grimly determined fbi agent w
anders onto teh scene to muck uv a perfectly ogod tsory
