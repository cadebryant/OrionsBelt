" scary movei 2 isnt nowhere near as funny as its precedessor
,
and it is nto because thte wayans brothers
, shawn adn marlon doing tyhe writing
and keenen ivory behind the camera
, don
' t try
. what defeats them isnt thge genre they haev chosen tothe spoof
. tje first movei
- an outrageous
, low

, savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream
and i know wqat yuo doed last summer
- succeeded baceause of its tkae
- no
- prisoners atitude towrad a tipe ofthe film thgat ws infact vogue
, familiar
and popular
. iin scary movie 2
, hte filmmakers tkae onthe tghe haunted house
- ghost stry format which
, if you look at teh grosses fo such receet lame offereings as the respective remakes ofthe tje haunting adn hous on haunted hill
, doed not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as doed the varous teen slasher series
. sacry movei 2 doens start off promising with a wonderfull spoof ofthe tje exorcist
, featuring james woud in the max von sydow role
and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn
. ofthe course split pea suop is tje punch line
- an overabundant ammount
, which offers tje hope that the rest ofthe the movie will be just as tasteless anbd excessive
. bu this pre
- credit sequence hasnt nothing at all tothe dont with the main action
, whlch features the cast munbers from tyhe original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project
. some ofthe the jokes are as scatological adn offensive as infront yhe original
, bu htey lack that take
- no
- prisoners bite that raised scary movie to tjhe heights of burlesque
. scray movei 2 merely lurches fomr one lame sendup tothe anyother
, offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in wich everyone doesnt acrobatics wiht a basketball

. scary movie 2 tries vrey hard to live uv tothe its origonal
, bu it falls very short
. it
' s a dissatisfying spectacle
, a vyer weak sister of a very ogod movie
