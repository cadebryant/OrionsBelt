' frist feature
- length
, fully
- animated attempt tothe steal clout ffrom disney
' s ctaroon empire
,
but teh mouse has noone reason to be worried
. the only other recent challanger to theri throne was lastest fall
' s promising
, if flawed
, 20th century fox production
" anastasia
,
" bu disney
' s
" hercules
,
" with its livley casted
and colorful palate
, hadnt her beated h
ands
- down when it cameback tiem tothe crown 1997
' s best piece of animation
. this year
, it
' s no contest
, as
" quest fo camelot
" is preety much dead on arival
. even tjhe magic kingdom at its most mediocre
-
- taht
' d be
" pocahontas
" forthe those ofthe yuo keeping socre
-
- isn
' t nearly as dull as this
. tyhe stor revolves around the adventures of free
- spirited kayley
( voiced by jessalyn gilsig
)
, thge easly
- teen daugher of a belated knight ffrom king arthur
' s round tabel
. kayley
' s only dream isnt tothe followup in her father
' s footsteps
, adn she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber

- trapped forest
. with the help of hunky
, blind timberl
and
- dweller garrett
( carey elwes
)
and a twpo
- headed dragon
( eric idle
and don rickles
) that
' s allways arguing with itself
, kayley jsut might be able tothe break the medievla sexist mold anbd prove her worth as a fighter on arthur
' s side
.
" quest forthe camelot
" is missing pure showmanship
, an essential element if it
' s ever expected to climb to tje high ranks ofthe disney
. there
' s nothing here thast differentiates
" quest
" ffrom something yuo
' d see on any given saterday morning ctaroon
-
- subpar animation
, instantly forgettable songs
, poorly
- integrated computerized footage
.
( compare kayley adn garrett
' s run
- in with tjhe angry ogre to herc
' s battle withthe the hydra
. i rest my case
.
) even tghe charachters stink
-
- none ofthe them are remotely intresting
, so much thast the film becomes a race tothe see whitch one can out
- bl
and tghe others
. in the end
, it
' s a tie
-
- they all win
. thta dragon
' s comedy shtick isnt awfully cloying
,
but at least it shows signs of a pulse
. at least fans of hte eary
-
' 90s tgif televsion line
- uv iwll be thrilled tothe fidn jaleel
" urkel
" white
and bronson
" balki
" pinchot sharing tje smae footage
. a faw scenes are nicely realized
(
though i
' m at a loss tothe reacll enought to be spicific
)
,
and thte actors providing hte voice talent are enthuseastic
(
though most are paired uv with singers who don
' t soudn a thing like them for their big musical moments

. bu one must strain through too much of thsi mess tothe fidn yhe good
. aside ffrom tyhe fact thyat childen will probably be as borde watching tihs as adults
,
" quest fo camelot
"
' s most grievous error isnt its complet lack of perosnality
. annd personality
, we learn from this mess
, goes a vrey long way
