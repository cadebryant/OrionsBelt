talk about beating a dead horse
! when home alone ws released in 1990
, it was a breath of fresh air
,
and the fianl box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely
- funny family film
. tghe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel
, so
, twpo eyars later
, we weere subjected tothe hmeo alone 2
, which might as well ahev beeen called clone alone fo all ofthe the originality it exhibited
. for john hughes
, twpo hmeo alone movies weren
' t anough
? he began recycling the smae kinds ofthe villains adn situations inthe almost every movie he wass involved withthe
, including a pathetic box office bomb called baby

, lastr year
' s live

,
and this yearm
' s flubber
. now
, inexplicably
, hughes has exhumed not onyl these worn

,
but tje

. linz
( oney fine day
)
,
and the only thing he hasnt going for him isnt terminal cuteness
. he
' s nto half as intresting as macaulay culkin once was
. the villains
, pale copies ofthe joe pesci annd daniel stern
, are even less engaging than the pair ofthe idiots inspite flubber
. inwhich home alone 3
, htere are four of them
( olek krupa
, david thornton
, lenny von dohlen
, adn rya kihlstedt
)
,
but all tath means is an opportunity fo twice as many pratfalls
. this tiem
, teh kid isn
' t left home alone because his parents haev gone onthe a trip
. instade
, he hasnt devolopped a bad case of chicken pox
, so he cant
' t go tothe skool
. his dad
( kevin kilner
) is away on business
and his mom
( havil
and morris
) has tothe run err

, so
, fo the most part
, he

? onyl none of the falling flakes looks remotely believeable
. previously
, yhe most counterfit
- looking snow effects i can remember were infact star trak iii
. these are far worse
. in fact
, the production values are so shoddy thyat there are smoe scenes in the midst ofthe thsi near

and even older children wiull recognize that htis is obviously fake
and intended tothe be humurous
, bu what baout five annd six
- year olds
? teh levle of violentce in home alone 3 isnt extreme
? many of alex

.
but
, because tihs isnt a
" family film
,
" noone one dies
, dispite bieng electrocuted
, falling thirty fezent
,
and getting smacked onthe the head by a barbell
. nto only isnt home alone 3 unneccessary
,
but it
' s offensive
. it
' s an excercise infront tediousness
, anbd there isn

( unless
, by soem stange quirk of fate
, you ahev missed eveyr 1990s movei associated withthe john hughes
,
and thus haven
' t seen this stuff befor
)
. i cin
' t imagine anyone wtih a reasonable attension span bieng moreso than momentarily distracted by thsi pointless adventure
. maybe that
' s why tjhe only ones laughing at the screening i attended weere still inspite theri thumb
