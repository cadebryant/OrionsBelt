talk baout beating a dead horse
! when hmeo alone was released inspite 1990
, it ws a breath of fresh air
,
annd the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely
- funny family film
. the unexpectedly high gross garanteed a sequal
, so
, twpo yeras later
, we weere subjected to hmeo alone 2
, whitch might as well ahve beeen called clone alone for all ofthe the originality it exhibited
. forthe john hughes
, twpo hmeo alone movies weren ' t enough
? he began recycling yhe same kinds ofthe villains
and situations in allmost eveyr movei he ws involved wiht
, including a pathetic box office bomb called baby ' s day outloud
, lastr year ' s live
- acation 101 dalmatians
,
and this eyar ' s flubber
. nowe
, inexplicably
, hughes hasnt exhumed nto only these worn
- out plot elements
,
bu tje
" hmeo alone
" name as well
. the result
? 1997 ' s worst sequal
( edging outloud speed 2
and batman
and robin
)
, home alone 3
. by changeing the cahracters
, hughes
( who wroet
anbd co
- produced teh film
)
, allong withthe his co
- conspirator
, directer raja gosnell
, hasnt attempted to inject new life inot a sories that isnt way past the point ofthe cardiac arrest
. tyhe new kid
, alex pruitt
, is played by alex d
. linz
( one fine day
)
,
anbd tghe onyl thing he hasnt going for him isnt terminal cuteness
. he ' s nto half as intresting as macaulay culkin once wass
. tje villains
, pale copies of joe pesci
anbd daniel stern
, are even less engaging thna thte pair ofthe idiots in flubber
. iin hmeo alone 3
, there are four of them
( olek krupa
, david thornton
, lenny von dohlen
,
annd rya kihlstedt
)
,
bu all that means is an oportunity for twice as many pratfalls
. this timne
, the kid isn ' t left home alone beccause his parents hve gone on a trip
. instade
, he has devolopped a bad case of chicken pox
, so he cxan ' t go tothe skool
. his dad
( kevin kilner
) isnt awya onthe busineses
anbd his mom
( haviland morris
) hasnt tothe run errands
, so
, for the most part
, he ' s all by himself durig the day
. through a series ofthe coincidences too irritating to relate
, a top secret u
. s
. air force intergrated circuit comes into his possesison
. it ' s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break inot alex ' s hmeo tothe retrieve it
. tyhe eight
- yera ood
, who isnt wise beyond his yeras
, booby traps tje hous iwth all sorts ofthe rube goldberg
- tipe devices desgined tothe humiliate
anbd incapacitate the villains
. tje movie ' s climax takes place durig a raging snowstorm
? onyl none of thte falling flakes looks remotely believeable
. previously
, the most counterfit
- looking snow effects i can remeber weere in star trak iii
. these are far worse
. in fatc
, thte prodcution values are so shoddy taht there are smoe scenes in the midst of this near
- blizzard whn a shining sun can be seen
. if it ' s a wonderfull life sould ganerate real
- looking snow bcak in thge 1940s
, why can ' t home alone 3
, whic has a significantly larger budget
and ' 90s technolgy at its disposal
? there has beeen an ongoing debtae regarding hte appropriateness of live
- action ctaroon voilence for young children
. home alone 3 will add fuel tothe teh fire
. it ' s oney hting to see wyle e
. coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight
,
bu qtuie anyother tothe watch a running lawn mower fall onthe lenny von dohlen
. adults
adn even older children will recognize that tihs is obviously fake
and intended tothe be humorous
,
but what baout five
anbd six
- year olds
? hte levle of violence in hmeo alone 3 is extreme
? many of alex ' s schemes are nasty enough tothe kill
.
bu
, because htis is a
" familiy film
,
" noone one dies
, dispite bieng electrocuted
, falling thirty feets
,
annd getting smacked on the head by a barbell
. not onyl isnt home alone 3 unneccessary
,
bu it ' s offensive
. it ' s an exercise in tediousness
,
and htere isn ' t a genuine laugh to be found ffrom the beginning to the end
( unless
, by soem strange quirk ofthe fate
, yuo have missed every 1990s movie associated iwth john hughes
,
and thus haven ' t seen tihs stuf befor
)
. i cxan ' t imagin anyone witht a reasonable attension span being more thna momentarily distracted by thsi pointless adventure
. maybe thta ' s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in theri thumb
- sucking eyasr
