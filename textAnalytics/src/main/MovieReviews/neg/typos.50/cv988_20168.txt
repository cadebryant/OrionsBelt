this movie is written by yhe man who is deemed to be
" noe of the hottest writers in hollywood
"
. he wroet the groundbreaking screenplay forthe scream
( 8
/ 10
)
,
then added the successful i know what you doed lsat summer
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) script to his mix
,
and alsot created the popular tv serieses
" dawson
' s creek
"
. so when he asked tothe direct his frist movie
, based onthe his frist ever script writed
, everyone
and their gr
andma said
" sure
, go for it
!
"
. uhhm
, my question is
.
.
. doed anyone bother reading tihs stupid scirpt
?
?
? plot
: ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught whith some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher infact tjhe west
, mrs
. tingle
, anbd setted tothe lose her scholarship tothe college
. when she anbd her firends vsit the teacher at hmeo in order tothe explane theri side of hte story
, htey end uv tying her up
, adn slowy trying tothe talk soem sense inot thge hardheaded woman
. critique
: it
' s not so much that htis is a bad movie
, thna the fatc that it sucks
. this movie is chock
- full of one
- dimesnional charactors
, contains noone actuall humor that i was able to zone inspite on
, zero tension or thrills
, plot holes the size of my big ass
, lame pop tunes palyed tothe mask nothing going on in tjhe movie
, anbd molly ringwald
, vivica a
. fox
and lesley anne warren tossed awya inspite throwaway roles
. i was primed for this film as its intresting premise had me thinking misery
( 8
/ 10
) annd 9 to 5
, bu unfortunately forthe williamson
, he went nowhere iwth the bright foundation
, mkaing references tothe tghe exorcist
and dr
. zhivago
, which i doubt many inaddition his target market will appretiate
. he also forgot about suspense
, with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions
, unbeleivable motivations
and simpley boring us with all of theri trite dialogue
. sure
, katie holmes isnt cute
, annd her co
- star
, marisa coughlan
, did a reasonably amusing impression ofthe teh exorcist
( worth twpo points outloud of my three on ten
)
, bu how can we forgive the biggest oen
- dimensional charactor infact any film
, holmes
' rival inspite thte film
, mrs
. tingle
' s complet unprofessionalism bieng let go by all others arund her
( are teachers allowed tothe behave tht way nowdays
?
) adn a transparent romance between holmes annd some long
- haired dude
, hired to be the poore man
' s verzion ofthe skeet ulrich
( who hismelf isnt a poor man
' s verison ofthe johnny depp
!
)
. all inaddition all
, thsi movei ws laughable for me
, provided me with no insight inot anytying
, demonstrated williamson
' s genuin lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile scirpt
, annd provded helen mirren with a gerat role to chew into
, unfortunately forgetting to give her charcter any believability
, humanity or capacity tothe comprehend
. noone hip lines
, no cheap thrills
, jstu a dull tyme at the movie theather
. if yuo want tothe see a funny teenage movei
, go see detriot rock city
