terrence malick made an exelent 90 minute film adaption ofthe james jones
' world war ii novel
. unfortunately
, he burried it withing an overlong anbd overreaching 3
- hour long pseudo
- epic
. this is a shame becasue the film features an oust
anding performance by nick nolte
. the best scene is wehn nick nolte
' s character
, lt
. col
. tall
, is forced tothe deel wih tghe direct refusal by capt
. staros
( elias koteas
) to excecute an order
. nolte
' s reaction annd transformation may be the best owrk of his carreer
. had terrence malick consentrated onthe the great performances of nolte
and koteas as well as thsoe by sean penn
, woody harrelson
, annd john cusack
, he could hvea made a truley graet film
. instade
, malick saddled the film with plodding pacing
, unnecessary flashbacks
, annd a voice
- over narration all designed to telegraph the grat philosophical underpinnings of yhe tsory
. yhe narration wass especially annoying as much of it sounded liek veyr bad high skool peotry
. with a lot ofthe editting
, teh core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film
. hopefully
, the dvd version of this film will feature options tothe supress yhe narration
, annd perhaps will even provide forthe an alternate
, shorter version ofthe tghe film
. i give this film
.
