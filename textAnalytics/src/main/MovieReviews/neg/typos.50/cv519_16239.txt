terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaption ofthe james jones ' world war ii novel
. unfortunatley
, he buried it within an overlong
and overreaching 3
- hour long psuedo
- epic
. this is a shame becasue the film features an outstanding peformance by nick nolte
. the best scene isnt when nick nolte ' s character
, lt
. col
. tall
, isnt forced tothe deal iwth thte direct refusla by capt
. staros
( elias koteas
) tothe execute an order
. nolte ' s reaction
and transformation may be tghe best work of his career
. had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte
and koteas as well as thsoe by sean penn
, woody harrelson
,
and john cusack
, he could have made a truley grat film
. instade
, malick saddled the film with plodding pacing
, unecessary flashbacks
,
and a voice
- over narration all dessigned tothe telegraph tje graet philisophical underpinnings ofthe tghe story
. teh narration was especialy annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school peotry
. with a lot of editting
, thte core sotry coudl be transformed into a truly classic war film
. hopefully
, hte dvd verzion of tihs film will feature options to suppress tyhe narration
,
anbd perhaps wiull even provide for an alternate
, shorter verison ofthe the film
. i give this film
.
