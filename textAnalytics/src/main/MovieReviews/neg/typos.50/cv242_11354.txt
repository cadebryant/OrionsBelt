" spice world
" is jstu noe long promotional film for the brittish girl b
and tjhe spice girls
. sure there
' s a hint of humor in there every once inwhich a hwile
. accually
, htere
' s a cuple ofthe pretty ogod jabs at the spice girls
. bu overall
, who cares
? nto me
. if you don
' t knwo by nowe
, the spice girls sing songs of lveo annd friendship annd responsiblity annd girl pwoer
,
yet dress liek streetwalkers ffrom a lower middle class neighborhood
. in
" spice world
" they ride around inthe theri big tour bus
, whinning baout having tothe do photo shoots
and give interviews
. amazingly
, all tghe talk tehy dont about keeping committments adn upholding responsibilities onyl really applies tothe funn things
, things htey wanna tothe do
, not things they are required tothe do tothe keep earning mney
. anbd htey keep babbling about
" girl pwoer
" when tehy should relaly be tlaking baout
" cleavage power
"
. i mean
, if all it tkaes isnt girl power
,
then why are they only oen thread away from bursting outloud of their skimpy outfits
? teh film isnt pg
,
but really witht only soem vyre minor dialogue changes annd scene extentions
, you
' d haev youself one raunchy adult film
. by the way
, there
' s something in tghe opening credits whitch says
" based onthe an idea by tyhe spice girls
"
. wow
, htey got idae credit
! i certainly wish tyhat was a new trend in hollywood
.
.
. giving credit for simply hvaing the thougth
" say girls
, let
' s make a movei
!
" thge supporting cast fares well
. roger moore
( the rela james bond
) mockingly plays yhe cliche
- spewing
" chief
" ofthe yhe spice girls
, adn darn it all
, he
' s funn tothe watch
. mark mckenney also isnt ogod as a screenwrighter trying tothe pich film ideas tothe thte b
and
' s manager
( richard e
. grant
)
. oen question
though
: george wendt
? you
' d think that
" spice world
" owudl envoke one ofthe twpo reactions in people
. if ytou like teh spice girls
, you
' ll like them even more afterwards
.
and if you cin
' t st
and them
( liuke me
)
,
then
" spice world
" will realyl make yuo sick
. oddly
, the audience i saw the film witht
, roughly 50 twelve year
- old girls
, sat in silence for the entire film
. well
, not thte two who sat directly behind me
. htey kept muttering
" htis is stupid
" over adn over again
. maybe htere is hope fo humanity after all
.
