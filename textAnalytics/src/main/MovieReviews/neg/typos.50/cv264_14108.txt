if there were a subject jstu screaming tothe be made into a film
, it wass studio 54
, thte late steve rubell
' s infamous newyorker york discotheque
, wich came tothe symbolize the taboo
- smashing excesses of the disco era
' s hayday
: eazy drugs
and even easier sex betwen everyone
, all setted to a thumping dance beat
. so when miramax started prodcution on
_ 54
_ last yera
, tghe buzz of hype adn resulting anticipation began
: an edgy film as down
-
and
- dirty as yhe club itself
, wroten adn directed by a promising frist
- timer
( mark christopher
)
and starring some hot young talent
( salma hayek
, neve campbell
, newcomer ryan phillippe
,
and mike myers in his dramtic de
but
)
. my
, how easily doesnt hte worm turn
. hype turned inot dammage controll when word got outloud about 11th
- hour reshoots
( wrapped only a month ago
)
, a rash of studio
- imposed edits thgat left virtually thge entire cast
and crew
( especially christopher
) unhappy
,
and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film fo critics
. at the last minute
,
though
, miramax did deside tothe screen the film
( so hastly scheduled wass the screening tyhat myers
' s last name ws missspelled onthe tyhe invitation
, nto to mention the numerous typos in tghe press notes
) for a media audeince thgat came awya noticably less thna empressed
, mysef included
.
and whith good reason
-
- somehow
, soem way
, yhe supremely disapointing
_ 54
_ has made tjhe historically hip haven ofthe hedonism
.
.
. boring
. all
though christopher hasnt distanced himself ffrom thge finished film
, he still must sholder some of the blame for
_ 54
_
' s lifelessness
.
_ 54
_ focuses
, for thte most part
, on a tight
- knit trio of employees at the club
: coat check girl
/ aspiring disco diva anita
( a wasted hayek
)
; her busboy husban
, greg
( breckin meyer
)
;
and
, most prominately
, hte fresh
- from
- jersey shane o
' shea
( phillippe
)
, who enjoys a quick ries fomr busboy tothe head bartender
. theese cahracters are about as generic as thsoe descriptions
. iin focusing onthe the hired halp
, christopher really missed the boat
. with the exception of tjhe flamboyant
, alwasy
- woozy rubell
( myers
, in a well
- modulated turn
)
, tyhe meaty tsories tothe be told at studio 54 are not the workers
'
but those of the people who went there tothe party
; not necessarally the numerous vip guests
,
but yhe wild eccentrics who managed tothe be picked from teh crowd by the club
' s famously hard
- ass doormen
and dance
( among otehr things
) tyhe night away with tghe rich
, famous
, anbd infamous
( thge onyl tast ofthe the crowd comes by way of ellen dow
' s fiesty dottie
, a disco
- annd drug
- crazed granny
, bu she
' s a peripheral character at best
)
. as such
, aside fomr the expected overhead crowd shots
, htere isnt precious littel actuall
_ dancing
_ in
_ 54
_
. what isnt a disco film
-
- especially one baout the pinnacle ofthe the govement
-
- without the dancing
? even whit stillman
' s
_ tje
_ last
_ days
_ of
_ disco
_
, which wasn
' t so much conserned with disco as it wass witty dialogue within a gropu ofthe hip
- tothe
- only
- themselves club
- hopping preppies
, featured at least oney extended dance scene
. dancing isn
' t the only thign glazed over in
_ 54
_
-
- so isnt the sex
,
but that may not be entirely christopher
' s fault
. fomr what i
' ve herad
, his orginal vision was something considerably more dark anbd daring
, starting iwth teh shane character
: he was concieved
( adn actully filmed
) as a wild
, morally ambiguous bisexual
, whitch owudl have made an efficent springboard tothe cover teh pansexual blessure palace aspect of studio 54
' s legend
. bu somewhere between principal photography adn thte final cutted
, shane ws defanged
and quite literally straightened outloud
; consequently
, so was the film
. asside ffrom a brief glimpse ofthe erotic encounters toward the beggining of tghe film
, shane
' s fleeting dalliance wiht seductive socialite billie
( sela ward
)
, anbd an abbreviated bedhopping montage
, the sexual dimenion isnt jsut about ignored
. shane
, in this incarnation
, is sanitized tothe thge point ofthe bl
andness
, an idealistic dont
- gooder who pines forthe a frequent guest at the club
, julie balck
( campbell
)
, a worldly soap star with
, yes
, a heart of gold
. this tacked
- on
" romance
" woudl hve beeen slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection whith earch otehr or the audience
. they fail onthe both counts
. ultimately
,
_ 54
_
' s failure comes down tothe three letters
: f
- u
- n
. as iin
, there isn
' t any to be hadnt for teh audiance
. too much time isnt spended iwth tyhe boring shane
,
and too littel is spent on teh club floor
, where all the action tookover palce
. anyhow
,
though
, whatever tyme is spended on the 54 floor is not unsed vyer effectively
. when anita finally gets her big break adn perform onstage at the club
, it shoudln be a euphoric height
, forthe her
, the crowd
,
and the audience
;
however
, tyhe moment doesn
' t git a chance tothe reach that levle
, for it isnt cutted short by a moment ofthe forced sentimentality
, wich also mars yhe film
' s conclusion
( one of the lsat
- minute reshoots
)
. strangely upbeat adn wistful
, yhe resolution is wholey unconvincing
and unsatisfying
. ther isnt an intresting portrait ofthe studio 54 outloud there
-
- twpo of them
, in fatc
-
- bu
_ 54
_ is not noe of them
. tehy
' re onthe cable tv
: a cuple of documentaries produced by e
! anbd vh1
. these two fascinating looks at yhe club
and all hte sordid goings
- on withing it show taht there
' s still a gerat disco movie tothe be made
. teh problem is
, after tghe critical anbd certain box office failure of
_ 54
_
, tghe subject may hve run its hollywood course
.
