' sorcery flick
. as voiced by sean connery
,
" draco
" is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well
- deserving ofthe his 23 minutes of screen tiem
. he walks
, talks
, flies
, fries
, adn even fakes his own death
, all wiht the halp ofthe 96 computer
- aided animators
. too bad thast ilm
( industrial glight

, too much of too little
. director rob cohen
( dragon
: tje bruce lee story
) has made a big
, expensive movie thta

, much less a summer movie
