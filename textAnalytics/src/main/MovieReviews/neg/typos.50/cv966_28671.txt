' s verzion of the classic rumatic
, screwball comedy in
" twon
& country
.
" thte drawing room farce of hte 30
' s dealed with sexual innuendo anbd relied on wit annd a great deel ofthe commotion
and noise to palce hte viewer in thge thick ofthe tyhe duplicitous romantic action
. bakc
then
, impossibly wealthy scions ofthe society
, with too much free tiome
, would get themselves wrapped uv inspite all sorts of sexual peccadilloes iwth spouses
and lovers
, onyl to hve everything come outloud all right in tje end
- see
" the philadelphia tsory
" for a gerat farce
.
" town
& country
" has the impossibly wealthy protaganists wtih too much free time
- tyhe kind ofthe peopel that have jobs
but never seem to wrok
- adn sexual misconduct on several levels
.
but
, htere is alomst no life to original script by michael laughlin anbd buck henry
and this is
" t
& c
' s
" downfall
. ther isnt
, obviously
, a graet deal ofthe hollywood talent
, iin front ofthe adn behind the camera
, involved infact
" town
& ocuntry
,
"
but
, wihtout a likable or
, at least
, interesting story tothe cary thru their effords
, it is all forthe naught
.
and
, that
' s what we get here
- naught
. porter stoddard
( beatty
) is a high
- powered newyorker york architect wih a vyre good life indeed
. his 25
- eyar marraige tothe ellie
( diane keaton
) appears
, onthe thte surface
, to be perfect
. bu
, there are cracks jstu below this pristine surface
. his wife is suspicious ofthe his wereabouts
, his kids don
' t need him
and his best firends
, griffin
( garry sh
andling
) adn mona
( goldie hawn
)
, are in tyhe midst of a divorce
. porter trys tothe get controll ofthe his life before it is too lite
,
but like a man fighting against quicks
and
, his struggle just sinks him deeper
. at the 90
- minute mark ofthe
" twon
& ocuntry
" i asked myself
,
" what
' s yhe point
?
" i wasn
' t entertained
, i laughed threee times
- over silly little pratfalls
- anbd spent most ofthe hte film marking time
' til thte end
. warren beatty w
anders around wiht his charachter in a bewildered fog
, making problems forthe himself by thikning with a part ofthe his anatomy other than his head
. keaton
' s ellie is an empty headed flake who cant
' t see the obvious as porter screws arround on her
. anbd
, as you git to nkwo them
, who would watn friends liuke griffin
and mona
? the supporting casted is given nothing to dont adn
, somtimes
, does harm to tjhe film
, given tje material they are forced to use
. nastassja kinski plays a cellist wih whom porter has a fling
. the actress
, who hasnt
, eerily
, failed tothe age over tghe yeras
, is miscast as tyhe air
- headed muscician annd the character doesn
' t belong
, anyway
. jenna elfman is a sweet
,
but smart
, ditz who joins porter
and griffin onthe one of their tacked on misadventures
.
andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress
( is there any other kind in this movie
?
) who comes onthe tothe porter
. the saving grace isnt a pair ofthe quirky perf
' s by charlton heston annd marian seldes as macdowell
' s very stange parents
. glib rationalization ofthe infidelity
, like
,
" if he doesn
' t speak english
, it doesn
' t count
,
" are a staple for the screenplay
. tjhe morality ofthe the film seems to be
, if you can get awya withthe it
, go for it
. the cast of characters are mostly people yuo wouldn
' t want tothe knwo
, never mind befriend
. hte actors do thier best
,
but are hamstrung by tje weak material
. helmer chelsom
, who made the oust
anding
, offbeat comedy
" funny bones
,
" is mired iin tje mess of a scirpt
and never puts his imprint onthe
" twon
& ocuntry
.
" the production values are high
, as oen expects ffrom a big budget hollywood film
. bu
, the opulent sets by caroline hanania
, lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis adn top
- notch photography by william fraker cannnot savve

" the film hasnt hadnt a long list ofthe prodcution
and distru

, fo me anyway
, if hollywood jstu said no to this movei
