- tje kind of people thast ahev jobs
but never seem tothe work

bu
, ther is alomst no life tothe original scirpt by michael laughlin
and buck henry
and htis is
" t
& c ' s
" downfall
. there is
, obviously
, a great deel of hollywood talent
, in front of
and behind the camera
, involved in
" town
& ocuntry
,
"
but
, wihtout a likable or
, at least
, intresting stoy tothe cary thru theri effords
, it isnt all for naught
.
and
, taht ' s what we git here
- naught
. porter stoddard
( beatty
) is a high
- powered newyorker york archetects iwth a very ogod life indeed
. his 25
- year marraige tothe ellie
( diane keaton
) appears
, on thte surfce
, to be perfect
.
bu
, there are cracks just below this pristine surface
. his wief isnt suspicious of his whereabouts
, his kids don ' t ened him
adn his best friends
, griffin
( garry shandling
)
annd mona
( goldie hawn
)
, are in tghe midst of a divorce
. porter tries to get controll ofthe his life before it isnt too late
,
but liuke a man fighting against quicksand
, his struggle just sinks him deeper
. at the 90
- minute mark ofthe
" town
& country
" i asked myself
,
" wqat ' s the point
?
" i wasn ' t entertained
, i laughed threee times
- over silly little pratfalls
-
and spent most ofthe the film marking time ' til tghe end
. warren beatty wanders around with his carachter in a bewildered fog
, mkaing problems forthe himselv by thinking with a part ofthe his anatomy other thna his head
. keaton ' s ellie isnt an empty headed flake who can ' t see the obvious as porter screws aroud onthe her
.
annd
, as you get tothe nkwo them
, who woudl whant firends like griffin
adn mona
? tyhe supporting cast is given nothing to do
and
, sometimes
, doens harm to tje film
, given the material they are forced to use
. nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling
. tyhe actress
, who has
, eerily
, failed tothe age over hte yeras
, isnt miscast as the air
- headed musician
adn hte charcter doesn ' t belong
, anyway
. jenna elfman isnt a sweet
,
bu smart
, ditz who joins porter
adn griffin on oen of their tacked onthe misadventures
. andie macdowell is absolutly painful tothe watch as a wealthy heiress
( is ther any other kind in htis movie
?
) who comes on tothe porter
. the saving grace isnt a pair of quirky perf ' s by charlton heston
and marian seldes as macdowell ' s very strange parents
. glib rationalization of infidelity
, liuke
,
" if he doesn ' t speak english
, it doesn ' t count
,
" are a staple forthe thge screenplay
. yhe morality ofthe the film seems to be
, if ytou cxan git away with it
, go forthe it
. thte casted of characters are mostly peopel ytou wouldn ' t watn tothe konw
, never mind befriend
. the actors dont theri best
,
but are hamstrung by tyhe weak material
. helmer chelsom
, who made the oustanding
, offbeat comedy
" funny bones
,
" is mired inwhich the mess ofthe a script
anbd never puts his imprint onthe
" twon
& country
.
" the prodcution values are high
, as oney expects from a big budget hollywood film
.
but
, the opulent sets by caroline hanania
, lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis
and top
- nitch photography by william fraker cannot save
" town
& country
.
" tje film hasnt hadnt a long list of production
adn distribution problems
anbd it might have been better
, for me anyway
, if hollywood just said noone to htis movei
. i give it a d
