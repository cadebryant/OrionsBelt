wolfgang petersen ' s latest
, yhe perfect storm
, isnt like a pinapple
. it only tastes ogod affter arduous peeling
and digging
- if you try tothe eat thge fruit
, spikes
annd all
, it ' s oging to hurt
? quite a bit
. ok
, maybe tyhat ws a confusing analogy
, so here ' s my main complaint baout the latest man battles nature flick
: there isn ' t really much ofthe a stry tothe tell
. basically
, a massachusetts fishing crew goes outloud tothe sea on a small boat
, called yhe andrea gail
,
adn gets stuck in the middle of
" the storm ofthe thte century
.
" how much timne doesnt it take for petersen to tell thsi story
? not nearly anough
. so he spends tyhe majoroty ofthe tje film developing pointless side stories which all eventially become superfulous
. audiences want to see the storm
, they whant to see a fight fo survival
but what tehy get is a lot of cliched
, maudlin drivel
. the last quarter of tyhe perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect
,
but just try lating thte first threee
- quarters
. i hve
yet to read sebastian junger ' s the perfect storm
,
but ffrom whta i ahve heard it isnt an unforgettable tale
. based onthe a true story
, the book must haev foudn smoe other way to introduce the cahracters because in the movie version
, the approch isnt weak
. useing a wonderfully patriotic csore by james horner
, petersen almsot hides thte inspite
- your
- face banality
. right away tyhe central characters are introduced
: tjhe gritty
, determined captain
( george clooney
)
, yhe ingenue
( mark wahlberg
) torn betwen his job
and his girlfriend
( diane lane
)
, teh loving father
( john c
. reilly
)
, the comic relief who ' s allways trying tothe get layed
( john hawkes
)
, tyhe new guy
( william fichtner
) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate
annd the quiet
, french guy
( allen payne
)
. so many problems strike yhe opening segment ofthe the film that the remaining portions driectly suffer
. it isnt nto teh all
- star cast ' s fault
, just the characters desined for their protrayal
. allen payne ' s charcter never speaks iin the entire movie
, nto because he is mute
,
bu because he ' s never given any lines
! are we suppoed to root forthe a guy whose face
and voice we are never given a chance tothe interact wiht
? fichtner ' s charater is terribly underdeveloped
- we don ' t know wqat he ' s doing there
, where he ' s from
, or who he ' s supposed to be
. the remaing four fishermen are all cardboard sterotypes
( hawkes sasy to a female stranger in noe scene
" ytou nkwo what would look good on you
? me
!
" ooooh rela creative
)
. as yhe script advances
and tjhe andrea gail floats farther out inot the waters
, teh crew continues tothe nto feel human
. only wehn hte storm tkaes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk
. the computer
- generated images of gigantic waves crashing aginst a helpless boat are thunderously rela
. i cin only imagin if this wass an imax film
, this city kid owudl surely never go inspite tghe water agian
. this is loud
, jolting entertainment
- adjectives that completly negate teh rest ofthe the film
. tjhe perfect storm was unfortunately a dissapointment
. the maelstrom lived uv tothe its potential
bu everyting esle failed to dont so
. i guess i ' ll stick to thta otehr survival spectacle
? yuo knwo the one on cbs
?
