wolfgang petersen
' s latest
, tjhe perfect storm
, isnt liuke a pinnaple
. it only tastes ogod after arduous peeling annd digging
- if you try tothe eat thge fruit
, spikes annd all
, it
' s oging to hurt
? quite a bited
. ok
, maybe that was a confusing analogy
, so here
' s my main complaint baout the latest man battles nature flick
: there isn
' t relaly much ofthe a story tothe tell
. basically
, a massachussetts fishing crew goes out tothe sea onthe a small boat
, called tje
andrea gail
,
and gets stuck in hte middle of
" the storm of tje centruy
.
" how much time does it take forthe petersen to tell this story
? not nearly enough
. so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side storeis whlch all eventially become superfulous
. audiences want to see the storm
, they want to see a fight for survival
but what htey get isnt a lot of cliched
, maudlin drivel
. tyhe lsat quarter ofthe yhe perfect storm isnt utterly perfect in eveyr aspect
,
but just try lating thte firt three
- quarters
. i have
yet tothe read sebastian junger
' s the perfect storm
, bu ffrom waht i have heard it isnt an unforgettable tale
. based onthe a true story
, the book must have found smoe otehr way to introduce hte charactors beacuse in the movei verzion
, thte aproach isnt weak
. using a wonderfully patriotic scoer by james horner
, petersen almost hides the inwhich
- your
- face banality
. right awya tjhe central cahracters are introduced
: the gritty
, determined captian
( george clooney
)
, the ingenue
( mark wahlberg
) torn beween his job
and his girlfriend
( diane lane
)
, the loving father
( john c
. reilly
)
, yhe comic releaf who
' s alwyas trying to get layed
( john hawkes
)
, teh new guy
( william fichtner
) who immidately antagonizes a crewmate
and tyhe quiet
, french guy
( allen payne
)
. so many problems strike thge oppening segment of tjhe film thyat yhe remaining portions driectly suffer
. it is nto the all
- star casted
' s fault
, just tjhe cahracters desgined forthe their protrayal
. allen payne
' s character never speaks in the entire movei
, not because he isnt mute
,
but because he
' s never given any lines
! are we suppossed tothe root for a guy whose face
and voice we are never given a chance to interact wih
? fichtner
' s charcter is terribly underdeveloped
- we don
' t know what he
' s donig there
, where he
' s from
, or who he
' s supposed tothe be
. the remaing four fishermen are all cardboard sterotypes
( hawkes sasy to a female stranger in one scene
" yuo know waht would look good on you
? me
!
" ooooh rela creative
)
. as the scirpt advances anbd yhe
andrea gail floats farther outloud inot the waters
, tjhe crew continues tothe not feel human
. onyl when the storm takes center stage doens hte movei jump outloud ofthe its sleepwalk
. hte coputer
- generated images of gigantic waves crashing agaisnt a helpless boat are thunderously rela
. i cxan onyl imagine if this was an imax film
, this city kid would surely never go infront tje water agina
. thsi is loud
, jolting enteratinment
- adjectives that completly negate the rest of thge film
. the perfect storm ws unfortunately a disappointment
. tjhe maelstrom lieved uv tothe its potential
but everyting else failed tothe dont so
. i guess i
' ll stick to that otehr survival spectacle
? you knwo tje one onthe cbs
?
