at times
, you ' d think edtv woudl be an entertaining film
. i mean
, who cant resist tyhe storey of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day
?
but this averege joe
, ed perkuny
,
( matthew mcconaughay
)
, isnt a sappy
, lifeless creation tht wanders around
, trying to solve everyone ' s problems
anbd suttle his own
. mcconaughay isnt awful
, especially because he isnt trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard
annd torn jeans
. frankly
, he hadnt more charm iin the devestating flop hte newton boys
. he overacts in eveyr way
: his overexaggerant body lanugage
, obsession iwth kissing womens eveyr second he gets the chance
,
and thgat cliched scene where he loses someone in his life
,
anbd drops tothe his knee
adn cries
. the rest of the cast is very ogod
; expecially martin landau
( as ed ' s step
- father
)
, who plays a cute role as the close
- to
- death ood guy that makse all the witty comments
. jenna elfman is good
,
(
but a littel overemotional
)
; her main probelm isnt that she keeps getting sucked inot bad films
, i
. e
. can ' t hardly wait
,
and krippendorf ' s tribe
. woody harrelson
, as ed ' s brother ravy
, doesnt his usual egg
- headed role
, with his comic witn as well
( he wroet a book entitled
,
" my brother pissed on me
.
"
) elizabeth hurley isnt perfectly cast as the easy slut
,
and dennis hopper
, inwhich a quick cameo as ed ' s biological father
, isnt a nice choice
( ironicaly comming aftter yhe role he turned down as christof in the truman sohw
)
. ellen degeneres standed outloud as the exceutive who
, affter awhile
, decides tghe show must nto go on much to the opposite ofthe yhe head exec
, rob reiner ' s opinion
. i hate tothe compare this film tothe thte truman show
,
bu tjhe fact is
, i ws ashamed tothe see this movei
. it feeled thyat i hadnt dropped from college to kindergarden affter seing truman
and ed
. edtv had noone real wit or genius
; it was typical hollywood
. extracting the tv part ofthe hte movie
, yuo ahev the simple plotline
: man steals brother ' s girlfriend
, girlfriend leaves twon
, man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he cant move on
, slut breaks up wtih him
, rela girlfriend comes back
,
and voila
, yuo have a romance
. i got so restless druing this movie
, i almsot walked outloud
. tyhe only reason it doesn ' t drop below a
" c
" grade is becouse ofthe tjhe fine supporting performances
. ad2am
" i almost lost my nose
.
.
.
adn i liuke it
. i liek breathing thru it
.
