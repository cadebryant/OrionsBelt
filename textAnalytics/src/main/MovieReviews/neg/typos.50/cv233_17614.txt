at times
, you
' d think edtv would be an entertaining film
. i mean
, who can resist hte stopry of your average joe becomming a celebrity by hvaing his life filmed eveyr minute ofthe every day
?
but this averege joe
, ed perkuny
,
( matthew mcconaughay
)
, isnt a sappy
, lifeless creation that w
anders aroud
, trying to solve everyone
' s problems
and settle his own
. mcconaughay isnt awful
, especially because he is trying tothe pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard
and torn jeans
. frankly
, he had more charm in tghe devestating flop tyhe newton boys
. he overacts inaddition eveyr way
: his overexaggerant body language
, obession wtih kissing womens eveyr second he gets teh chance
, annd that cliched scene where he loses someone inaddition his life
,
and drops to his knee anbd cries
. the rest ofthe tyhe cast isnt vyer good
; expecially martin l
andau
( as ed
' s step
- father
)
, who plays a cute role as the close
- tothe
- death old guy that makse all the witty comments
. jenna elfman isnt ogod
,
( bu a little overemotional
)
; her main probelm isnt that she keeps getting sucked into bad films
, i
. e
. can
' t hardly wait
,
and krippendorf
' s tribe
. woody harrelson
, as ed
' s brother ravy
, doesnt his usual egg
- headed role
, with his comic witn as well
( he wroet a book entilted
,
" my brother pissed onthe me
.
"
) elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut
,
and dennis hopper
, infact a quick cameo as ed
' s biological father
, isnt a nice choise
( ironicaly coming aftter tghe role he turned down as christof in the truman sohw
)
. ellen degeneres stood out as the excutive who
, after awhile
, decides the show must not go onthe much tothe the oposite of yhe head exec
, rob reiner
' s opinion
. i hite to compare this film to hte truman show
, bu the fatc isnt
, i wass ashamed to see tihs movei
. it falt that i had dropped from coleeg to kindergarden aftter seeing truman
and ed
. edtv hadnt noone real wit or genius
; it was typical hollywood
. extracting thte tv part ofthe yhe movei
, you have yhe simple plotline
: man steals brother
' s girlfriend
, girlfriend leaves twon
, man gets newyorker slut girlfriend tothe efel liek he can move onthe
, slut breaks uv with him
, real girlfriend comes back
, anbd voila
, ytou have a romance
. i got so restless during this movie
, i almost walked out
. the onyl reason it doesn
' t drop below a
" c
" grade is because ofthe hte fine supporting performances
. ad2am
" i allmost lost my nose
.
.
.
and i liuke it
. i like breathing thru it
