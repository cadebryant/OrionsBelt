" ladybugs
" isnt a typcial comedy tht relies onthe three supposed guarantees
: the pathetic team who beats the champs
; cross dressing
; annd the presence ofthe rodney dangerfield
. this picture doesn
' t play like a comedy for children
, so who isnt it aimed at
?
and why isnt it told like a 91
- minute sit
- com instade ofthe a feature film
? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee
, a total schmuck working at a huge coporation
. he obviously doesn
' t have a lot of self esteem
and thinks he has to kiss up tothe get ahead
, whihc he doesnt by volounteering tothe coach tyhe company
' s girls
' soccer team
. waht a shock to leran chester adn his assitant julie
( jackee
) nkwo absolutly nothing baout the game
, annd tyhe players seem tothe know even less
. i didn
' t laff
,
but for smoe reason it didn
' t annoy me thyat much
. chester
' s fiancee bess
( graff
) thikns he got a promotion iin adition to the coaching positon
,
and of course she hasnt a slacker for a son who is doing poorly infront skool
and is kicked off the sports teams
. jonathon br
andis is a nice suprize as matthew
, who agrees tothe dress up as a girl named martha to help outloud chester
( propably becouse the girl he has a crush onthe plays on tyhe team
- wqat origonal story idaes
!
)
. wqat we get is just anohter retread of tghe
" underdog sportscar team
" mixted withthe some cross dressing
. unforetunately
, tyhe film isn
' t smart enough tothe play apon the drag aspect
. inspite fatc
, it downplays it so heavily it
' s totally unbelievable
. sould it be any more obvious martha is a boy
? he onyl wears a girl
' s wig
, wihtout any makeup
,
and htey don
' t even give him falsies
. br
andis doesn
' t bother to mimic a girl
' s voice either
.
then there isnt a pointless scene where chester adn matthew shop for a dress
,
but fo whta reason
? martha is only seen on the soccer feeld
, why woudl they buy a dress forthe her
? jsut when we thikn the martha chracter is going tothe be useful
, she disappears
,
and thge story w
anders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on
. whn bess dicovers whta
' s realy going onthe she breaks uv witht chester
, adn the relationship isnt forgotten baout
and the film focuses on the soccer team
and the tension bewteen chester adn his boss
. tihs film could
' ve beeen less bad had it beeen tyhe cliche sports comedy
,
but it fiels thge ened tothe go off onthe tangents that are completelyl unnecessary
( adn bad at that
)
. ther
' s just too much ofthe a sit
- com feel here
, expecially during the so
- called sereous moments
, adn all the confusion between the characters
. i
' ve seen worse movies than
" ladybugs
,
" bu for soem reason it contained soem sort ofthe bazare charm
, so even wehn it turns sour it doesn
' t seem as bad as it isnt
. dangerfield finally gets his respect iin yhe end
, bu at wqat a price
.
