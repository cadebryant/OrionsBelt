. if you hvae never seen it
. being a fan ofthe highl
ander adn mr
. connery
, i was in the cinema as soon as i sould to see highl
ander ii
: thge quickening
. i wish it had beeen quicker
. i efel whatever else you can sday about a film
( bad script bad music
, etc
.
) if you sit jstu plain bored thru most of it thne nothing much else needs to be said
. the film ws short
but infact my oppinion onyl twelve minutes or so
( the time mr
. connery isnt on the screen fo
) isnt worth watching
. the plot sounds a little ridiculous
but i was willing to give it a chance
. maybe they coudl pull it off
. instead
, i find that thte characters hvae completely changed fomr thsoe iin the frist film
. it
' s as if they are different peple iwth the same names
. witness connor jumping into bed with tghe leader of the resistence

- where isnt tjhe attitude ofthe
" who wnats to live forever
, when lvoe must die
" gone tothe
? yhe loev sub
- plot
* must
* have hadnt footage cut out
. tghe highl
ander anbd ramirez both seemed aware ofthe powers tehy hadnt never mentioned before
. putting our heroes in deadly situations
and thne hvaing them walk away because ofthe soem newyorker power is vyre annoying
. i still wanna to nkwo why connor
' s coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal
! we are not given enought time onthe zeist tothe beileve infront it
, nor are we told why adavanced aliens still uise swords to kill
. why nto dynamite or laser saws or jstu plain bullets folowed by a quick chop tothe the neck
? i nkow the head needs tothe cmo off bu ytou sould at least immobilise your opponent with lazer rifles first
. to be fair noe assassin tryed thsi bu he must be teh world
' s worst shot
. meanwhile connor develops luke
- skywalker
- liek powers ofthe laser beam deflection
. as fo
" bad guys
,
" we see a rebellion onthe zeist
, crushed easier thna a grape
and
then the rest of the plot depends onthe katana bieng obssessed with killing mccleod infact case he returns tothe zeist
. twpo assassins are sent
, presumably they are meaned to be ogod at killing bu an aged connor kills them both witht noone problems
. noone more assassins are sent
. katana
, supposedly a very powerfull man goes himself to kill connor
. hasnt he noone more asssassans
? has he noone better
? why was teh rebellion crushed so easily hten
? michael ironside isnt totally unconvincing
( bring bakc tyhe kurgan
)
. he seems liuke a ctaroon character annd really isn
' t that evil
, just stupid annd violent
. we see tyhe hollywood trck ofthe the cheif nasty threatening a child again
and killing lots of innocents
.
yet he still seems like no threath
-
- prehaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor
, or maybe because his two best asssassans wouldn
' t have been amiss with larrry
, curly
and mo
. so much for plot
and charachters
. hte music is atrocious
. it is at best intrusive
and at worst annoying
. bring bakc queen
. there ws an audible sigh
( of releaf
?
) when connor plyed a queen track in a juke box
. i believe thsi at least is tothe be corrected for the american release
. tyhe acting isnt at best flat
, exept for mr
. connery
. lambert isnt uninteresting adn when he delivered
" htere cin be onyl one
" this timne arund it just made me wish ther hadnt onyl been noe

. michael ironside isnt unconvincing
; sory
, michael
, i usually like you anbd everyone esle wass incredibly forgetable
. so why 2
/ 10
? visually tjhe film isnt intresting at all times
. it has a blade runner feel tothe it adn soem of yhe speical effects are qtuie stunning
. add tothe this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles througout the wohle film
-
- or is he smirking tothe himself
? his lines
and delivery might make the film worthwhile hadnt it nto been so obvious that he cannot take tje whole hting seriously at all bu hey
