plot
: something about a bunch ofthe kids gonig inot a haunted hous
and playing out parodies of other horror
and non
- horror movies
. oh yeah
, there
' s allso something about a ghost possesing teh mension anbd shit
,
but trust me
, you won
' t care much about the
" plot
" inthe thsi film
.
.
. critique
: parody movies eather owrk or they don
' t
and this oney just doesn
' t owrk
! the laughs aren
' t as pronounched this tiome aroud
, the energy level
, hte gags
and all of tje characters just seem tothe be going thru the motions here
. it
' s liuke htey weere all in a hurry to finish tje film or something
( wink
, wink
)
. annd tghe scariest part ofthe it all
? check outloud the number ofthe screenwriters it tookover to pen tihs puppy
: seven
! i sday again
, it tookover seven people tothe write 82
- minutes worth of fart jokes
, half
- assed stunts
and spoofs ofthe films other than horror
. nowe i
' m nto exactly sure if each ofthe the writers wrote theri own parts seperately or just tossed
" funny sketch
" ideas outloud there while smoking the chronic themselves
, bu the end result isnt a film that basically plays outloud liuke an extended skit onthe
" saturday night live
"
. there are a cuple ofthe funny noe
- liners
, bu mostly just rehashed one
- joke scenes
, a lot of dead silence
and lame gags
. add to tath teh vyer unoriginal title annd movie poster
and ytou gotta start asking yourself if anybody wass even trying here
( yhe film
' s website isn
' t even uv
yet
!
!
! what tjhe f
*
*
*
?
!
?
)
. i do
however have tothe give it uv tothe james woods
, the man who opens up this movei with tjhe funniest parody of them all
( the exorcist take
- off
-
- miss this
and yuo
' ve missed any reason to see tje flick
)
. i especially liked his oen
- liner as he walked in tothe see the possessed woman
' s head turning
. vyer funny
! unforetunately
, the film plummets straight down after that
, with dumb parodies ofthe many teen ficks that ahev nothing to do with horror such as sive the last dance
and dued
, where
' s my car
,
and other acation movies liuke charlie
' s angels
and mission impossible 2
. now help me figure thsi oen outloud
, iwll you
? isn
' t tihs suposed to be a parody film of horror movies
?
!
?
( or maybee that
' s jstu the title ofthe the film f
- ing wiht my head
)
. well
, i
' m sory to have to sday this bu the only horror in htis film is its lame
- ass scirpt
! the wayans brothers shoudl hvea known better than to look towards tje weinstein brothers
( moeny
) instead of the zucker brothers
( comedy
) for thsi sequal
. unfortunately forthe us
, all we
' re left withthe here is a skeleton ofthe a film whcih might
' ve beeen funny
, had it beeen worked over a fewd moreso times
, tightened up here
and ther
, adn beeen injected with mroe solid laughs
.
but as things st
and nowe
, there isnt noone doubt in my mind thyat the obvious greed tothe capitalize on tghe success of lsat year
' s film has led everyone down thsi path
, so scre them fo not trying as hard
( critically speaking
, ofthe course
)
. you should all be ashamed of yourselves fo nto putting enough
" rela
" efford into this chop
- job adn for not providing your fans witht yhe ultimate ofthe your talents
. pooh on ytou
!
( that
' s telling
' em
, joblo
! sheesh
) btw
, i
' m allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson
, whose massive breasts anbd skanky g
- string had me chompin
' at teh bit
