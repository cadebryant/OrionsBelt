plot
: something about a bunch of kids gonig inot a haunted hous
anbd palying outloud parodies of otehr horror
annd non
- horror movies
. oh yeah
, ther ' s also something about a ghost possessing hte mension
anbd shit
,
but trust me
, you won ' t care much about the
" plot
" in htis film
.
.
. critique
: parody movies eather wrok or they don ' t
annd tihs oney jstu doesn ' t owrk
! tje laughs aren ' t as pronouced tihs tiome arund
, the energy levle
, tghe gags
adn all ofthe the cahracters just seem tothe be gonig through the motions here
. it ' s liek tehy weere all infact a hurry tothe finish tjhe film or something
( wink
, wink
)
.
adn tghe scariest part ofthe it all
? check out the number ofthe screenwriters it took to pen this puppy
: seven
! i sday again
, it tookover seven peple tothe rwite 82
- minutes worth of fart jokes
, half
- assed stunts
adn spoofs of films otehr thna horror
. nowe i ' m nto exactly sure if earch of thge writers wrote theri pwn parts separately or jsut tossed
" funny sketch
" ideas out htere while smoking teh chronical themselves
,
but the end result isnt a film thast basically plays outloud like an extended skit onthe
" saturday nigth live
"
. ther are a couple ofthe funny noe
- liners
,
bu mostly just rehashed oney
- joke scenes
, a lot of dead silence
and lame gags
. add to that tjhe vyre unoriginal title
annd movie poster
and you gotta strat asking youself if anybody ws even trying here
( tje film ' s website isn ' t even uv
yet
!
!
! waht the f
*
*
*
?
!
?
)
. i do
however have to give it up to james woods
, the man who opens up htis movie wtih the funniest parody ofthe them all
( the exorcist take
- off
-
- miss tihs
annd you ' ve missed any reason to see the flick
)
. i especially liked his one
- liner as he walked infact tothe see the posessed woman ' s head turning
. vyre funny
! unfortunately
, yhe film plummets straight down after thta
, wiht dumb parodies ofthe many teen ficks thta have nothing tothe dont witht horror such as sive the last dance
and dude
, where ' s my car
,
and otehr action movies liuke charlie ' s angels
and mission impossible 2
. nowe halp me figure this one outloud
, will ytou
? isn ' t thsi suppossed tothe be a parody film of horror movies
?
!
?
( or maybe tyhat ' s just thte title ofthe the film f
- ing iwth my head
)
. well
, i ' m sorry tothe hvae to say this
but tjhe onyl horror inaddition htis film is its lame
- ass scirpt
! the wayans brothers shoudln haev known better tahn to look towords tghe weinstein brothers
( mnoey
) instade of thge zucker brothers
( comedy
) forthe htis sequal
. unfortunatley for us
, all we ' re left with here is a skeleton of a film which might ' ve beeen funny
, had it been worked over a few more times
, tightened uv here
and there
,
annd beeen injected wtih omre solid laughs
.
but as thigns stand now
, ther is noone doubt iin my mind thyat yhe obvious greed tothe capitalize on tyhe sucess of lastr yera ' s film hasnt led everyone down thsi path
, so scre them fo not trying as hard
( critically speaking
, ofthe course
)
. yuo should all be ashamed ofthe yourselves for not puting anough
" rela
" efford into tihs chop
- job
and for not providing your fans whith the ultimate of your talents
. pooh onthe you
!
( that ' s telling ' em
, joblo
! sheesh
) btw
, i ' m allotting one point alone tothe actress kathleen robertson
, whose massive breasts
and skanky g
- string had me chompin ' at thte bit
