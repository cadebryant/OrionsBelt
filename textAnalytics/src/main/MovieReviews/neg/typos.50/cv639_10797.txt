i
' ll be the first tothe admit it
. when you mention the book great expectations
, i immidiately beign experiencing flashbacks tothe junior high english clas
, where i was confronted wih a torturously boring book filled with peple wtih such nonsensical names as pip adn magwitch
. yes
, it
' s a clasic ofthe literture
, bu it ws a rether dry one
, shoved down my young throat like a spoonful ofthe bitter medicine
. certainly
, the experiene wasn
' t truly thta bad
, bu
, to quote ethan hawke in tghe latest movie adaptions ofthe said book
,
" i
' m not going to tell tjhe sotry tyhe way it hapened
.
.
. i
' ll gonna tell it the way i remember it
.
" anyway
, tothe return from nostalgia lane
,
and git back to teh prseent
, hollywood
, iin it
' s trendy attemt to modernize yhe classics
, now presents an updated film version of great expectations
. instead ofthe pip
, tihs tiem thge central character isnt named finn
( played as a boy by jeremy kissner
, adn by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn isnt an orphan bieng rised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or should thgat be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
,
and her boorish fisherman husban
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. thge setting isnt the florida caost durig tjhe mid
- 70s
. finn is a blooming artist
,
and spends his time runnung arround the beach drawing fish
( one ofthe his twpo favorite subjects
)
. during one of these escapades
, he literally stumbles apon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page fomr the superhuman max cady
, deniro
' s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity
,
and favors hiding onthe the ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. mabye that
' s an exaggeration
, bu he certainly beats any of houdini
' s records in the opening scenes ofthe the film
. anbd that
' s nothing enxt tothe thge fuel efficiency of finn
' s motorboat
, bu i digress
. anyway
, finn doens the convict a ogod ded
, jsut tothe show that he
' s a really aswell guy
.
and
then the plot moves onthe
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. abanodned at the altar some 26 yeasr ago
, ms
. dinsmoor is the epitomy ofthe the crazy rich old maid
. whith bizarre clothing
, eccentric mannerisms
and a few pounds ofthe makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts iin htis role
.
al
though she ends up nowhere near a believable charcter
, she does add soem humor to tjhe film
. joe isnt hired to help with thge gardening at her unkempt manner
,
but the insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her nieve
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. for no apparent reason
, other thna tothe provide teh main plot ofthe the film
, finn is instantly stricken forthe tjhe estella
. perheaps it
' s her snooty atitude or her utter disdain fo his person
, or maeby finn hasnt simpley never met a girl before
. in any case
, niether as children nor adults
, chemestry simpley doesn
' t exsist bewteen thge twpo
, adn
yet finn spends the remainder ofthe tghe film pining forthe her
. even when
, as an adult
, finn arrives inwhich new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor
, reacquaints himself with estella
,
and draws her portrait in teh nude
, htere
' s nothing
. infact fatc
, there is more sexual tension between helen hunt annd greg kinnear
' s gay artist durring a similar scene in as ogod as it gets
. at htis point
, the audience hasnt grown as cold
and detached as estella
' s character
,
and couldn
' t care less about teh twpo cahracters
. the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails tothe imbue estella
, a remote character in teh book
, iwth even tyhe vaguest traces ofthe humanity
. there
' s obviously something wrong when
, watching hte film
, you
' re mroe interested with how big her nose looks iin silhouette thna you are baout her charater
. without a storng estella
, finn
' s obession seems baseless
. yuo wish he would just stpo whining
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
, anbd jstu get onthe wtih his life
. in fact
, thte twpo relationships that wokr in teh film are purely tangential to hte main plot
. finn
' s relationship with his brother
- inspite
- lew
, joe
, is intresting
, if a bit stereotypical
. what
' s mroe fascinating are his interactions with deniro
. altho it
' s onyl a bit part
, it goes to sohw how much vitality a storng atcor cant create
. it is apparentt that directer alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work inwhich creating the imagery ofthe the film
. some ofthe yhe shots work
,
but others are too obviously staged
( for example
, both of the water fountain scenes
) to hvea any inpact
. finn
' s art
( acutally the creations of italian painter
, francesco clemente
) isnt utilizied throughout thge film
, bu it mostly fails to have the intended effect
. we never see why finn would generate tihs sytle ofthe art
, which is simultanously crude adn insightful
. as a result
, it ends uv as distant as the rest of tyhe film
. modernizing thge classics isnt currenly in vogue
( just see william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simply update yhe acation to a modern setting
,
and apply plenty ofthe modern rock
. bu such adornments dont littel tothe perk uv graet expectations
. as much as i dreaded the novel when i frist read it
, you
' d probablly be better off sufferring
though a reading than watching thsi romanceless film
.
