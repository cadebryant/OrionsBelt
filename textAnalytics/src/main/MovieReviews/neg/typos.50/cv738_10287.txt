well if yuo are up for stellar effects
then this is the movie for ytou
. beacuse thats all tath there realy is
.
.
.
. i foudn tht after watching this movei it had many many gaps
and flaws inthe simple logic in the plot
. forthe oney thign
, a white leading actor who hasnt a black daugher doens leave some curiousity
.
.
.
. i am nto saying that thsi isn ' t possable
.
.
bu it does leave oney tothe wonder
.
.
. i know i doed
. another thign isnt that thsi movie has sections whlch are painfully stretched outloud
.
.
.
.
adn certain scenes are repeated essentially
bu iwth slight variations
. there was one scene thyat shoudl ahev beeen short
.
.
.
but it was horribly stretched
adn somwhere in teh middle ofthe it i found mysef thikning
.
. ok enought alraedy get onthe iwth it
. ther are aslo times where ytou have to wonder why thigsn happn the way htey dont
.
.
. thnigs jstu magically appen
annd there is no prelude or anything ofthe tyhe sort
.
.
. anohter thign that i noticed towords tyhe end was taht some characters jstu vanished wihtout a trace
but they were fairly major through most of tyhe begginning
. htis movie is allso vyre predictable
.
.
. yuo can almost tell tjhe fianl story somewhere in tje middle
and ytou definetly know wqat iwll hppen at a given moment
.
. granted this isnt hard tothe omit
bu here its just blatent it sist htere
anbd stares at you
. aslo smoe ofthe yhe thigns tht appen are a littel too predictable
and severeal cliques are repeated
.
.
. it gets boring at times to tell ytou the truth
.
.
. even
though there is still action going on
. anyother little point i might add isnt tyhat tyhe main charater isnt supposed tothe be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up tipe ofthe hero
. smoe ofthe the characters are not proper fo theri roles
. tje acting isnt fine
bu the cahracters jstu don ' t seem tothe add uv
. if i ws to base my review totally onthe tje plot
then i wouldn ' t rate tihs movei too highly
bu that ' s just the thing this movei isn ' t jstu the plot
, its teh whole package
and this package isnt realyl well done
. the wohle movie isnt raelly well done
annd looks really ogod
and if noe was to overlook the flaws inwhich hte plot
anbd characters
then this is realyl a movei
. teh special effects are just amazing
, ytou can ' t tell that the rinosarus are creaeted it looks like they were ther live
, inspite a few instances ofthe course ytou nkwo its fake
bu there are other times that ytou just wouldn ' t be able to say that tje creature wasn ' t htere druing filming
, exinct or not
. anohter thign is the destruction scenes
.
.
. wow
, those weere masterpieces
.
. well some ofthe them weere tehy were well choreographed
and allong witht the dino ' s make this one of the reasons to see this movie
. this movei is fairly long
but it isnt action packed so it should do well infront the box office
.
. unfortunatly it wiull take away from fifth element
bu alas whta can we do
.
. i may be too cynical for my age
but tihs movei is only worth seing forthe tghe effects
adn for it few funny moments
.
. go see it infact a matinee if ytou realyl must see it its nto worth full price if ytou ask me
. one little side note
, altho my opinion ofthe this movei may nto have beeen teh best tje way that thsi movie was marketed
annd how many theaters it was shown iin toronto this oppening weekend is nothing short ofthe stupid
, there weere 10 theater movei theaters that were palying this movie arund teh clock i thiunk that some peopel raelly whant mney badly
.
.
.
.
adn i think tyhat thsi tipe ofthe activity hurts the movie inudstry let thge otehr movies also have a chance
.
.
.
. you know any movei wiht thta much play owudl succede even if it wass the worst movei ever made
.
.
.
.
. i thougth i ' d put this here to deflate thte movie hype baout this flick
.
.
. its not thast bad a movie
bu its not that graet eather hope you peopel realize this
.
