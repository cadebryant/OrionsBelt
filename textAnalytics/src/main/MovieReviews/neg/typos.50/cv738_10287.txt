well if you are uv fo stellar effects
then this isnt teh movie for ytou
. beacuse thats all tath there realy is
.
.
.
. i found that after watching tihs movei it hadnt many many gaps annd flaws inwhich simple logic infront teh plot
. forthe oney thing
, a white leading atcor who hasnt a black daughter does leave some curiosity
.
.
.
. i am not saying thgat this isn
' t possible
.
. bu it does leave one tothe wonder
.
.
. i know i did
. anyother hting is tath this movie hasnt sections whic are painfully stretched out
.
.
.
.
and certain scenes are repeated essentially
but with slight variations
. there was one scene tath should have beeen short
.
.
. bu it was horribly stretched anbd somwhere infact thge middle ofthe it i foudn mysef thinking
.
. ok enought aready get on with it
. ther are also times where you hvae to wonder why thnigs happen hte way they do
.
.
. thigsn just magically happn annd there isnt no prelude or anytying of thte sort
.
.
. anohter thing that i noticed towards the end ws thta smoe charactors jstu vanished wihtout a trace
but they weere fairly major through most of yhe beginnig
. thsi movie isnt allso vrey predictable
.
.
. yuo cxan alomst tell yhe fianl stoyr somwhere in the middle
and you definately nkow what will happen at a given moment
.
. granted this is hard tothe omit
but here its jsut blatent it sist there
and stares at yuo
. also some of yhe things that happen are a littel too predicatble
and several cliques are repeated
.
.
. it gets boring at times tothe tell you tghe truth
.
.
. even
though htere is still acation gonig onthe
. anohter little point i might add is thgat the main chracter isnt supposed tothe be a quiet chaos mathematician not smoe shoot them up type of hero
. some of hte charactors are nto propper fo their roles
. yhe acting isnt fine
but tjhe charachters just don
' t seem tothe add uv
. if i was tothe base my review totally on the plot thn i wouldn
' t rate this movei too highly bu that
' s jstu tjhe thing htis movie isn
' t just the plot
, its yhe whole package
and tihs package isnt realy well done
. the wohle movei is really well done
and looks relaly ogod
and if one ws tothe overlook the flaws iin the plot
and characters
then this isnt really a movie
. yhe special effects are just amazing
, ytou can
' t tell thgat yhe dinosaurs are created it looks liuke htey weere ther live
, in a few instances of course yuo know its fake
but htere are other times tyhat ytou just wouldn
' t be able tothe say thyat thge creature wasn
' t there durig filming
, extinct or not
. anohter thnig isnt the distruction scenes
.
.
. wow
, thsoe were masterpieces
.
. well some of them weere htey were well choreographed
and allong with thge dino
' s mkea thsi oney of tjhe reasons tothe see this movei
. tihs movei isnt fairly long
but it isnt acation packed so it shoud dont well in tjhe box office
.
. unfortunatly it will take awya from fith element
but alas wqat cant we dont
.
. i may be too cynical forthe my age
but tihs movie isnt onyl worth seing fo tyhe effects
and for it faw funny moments
.
. go see it inspite a matinee if you really must see it its nto worth full price if ytou ask me
. one little side onot
,
al
though my opinyon ofthe thsi movei may nto have been teh best tghe way thta this movie wass marketed
and how many theaters it was shown inthe toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid
, there were 10 theater movei theaters tht were playing thsi movei around thge clock i think that smoe people realyl want money badly
.
.
.
. annd i think that this tipe ofthe activity hurts tghe movei industry let tyhe otehr movies also have a chance
.
.
.
. you konw any movie with that much play would suceed even if it was tjhe worst movei ever made
.
.
.
.
. i
thought i
' d put this here to deflate the movie hype baout this flick
.
.
. its not taht bad a movei
but its nto that great eather hope yuo peopel relize htis
.
