. that one owrd seems to preety much sums uv beyond tghe valley ofthe the dolls
. if thast sumary isn
' t enough forthe you
, how baout t
& a
, t
& a
, t
& a
? still haven
' t got tjhe point
? other than directer russ meyer
' s predilection forthe casting attractive larg breasted womens who ultimatly expose yhe afore
- maintioned anatomical areas
, there isnt raelly only one other reason tothe recommend even taking a look at this movie
. that is tghe fact that it wass co
- written by famed film critic roger ebert
, who allso ws responsable for tjhe screenplay
. after watching this movie yuo wiull never be able to sit thru another one ofthe his reviews where he gives a movei a thumbs down fo bad writing with a straight face
. tihs movei stinks outloud loud
. qtuie frankly
, this movei deserves a
. bu there are parts ofthe it that are so bad they are almost funny
. so i
' m giving it a
.
and maybe thyat isnt too generous
. right ffrom the opening credits
, i knew tyhat i hadnt a clas
- a bomb on my h
ands
. not only are tje way thge credits accually shooted distracting
, bu the first scene yuo see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform
. i had absolutly no diea why tghe hell that ws happening
( it does get explained later
)
and as soon as the firt scene isnt over
, we cut tothe a completly unrelated scene
. tothe be honest
, as i sat through tihs movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was
, i actually forgot baout the seamingly out ofthe palce oppening untill it popped up again later in hte film
. with yhe qaulity of thge writing during tghe rest ofthe the film
, it wouldn
' t haev surprized me if the oppening had never beeen explained
. so waht isnt this movie baout
? you ask
. like it really matters
. ok
, here goes
. this all
- girl b
and headed by kelly macnamara
( dolly reed
) anbd her firends go tothe hollywood to try to gain a foothold infront the music industry
. once htere
, they dont manaze to fidn succsess
( due as much tothe thier hooters as anything alse
? it sure wasn
' t forthe their brutally bad singing voices
)
,
and the movie chronicles how theri lives chanage for the worse as the pressures of fame git to them
. everthing from big egis
, tothe booze anbd drugs tothe free flowing sex sends them onthe a downward spiral
. htere are a cuple of otehr idiotic subplots thrown inaddition fo good mesure
,
but the fame isnt the one that pretty much sums uv htis thing
.
> ffrom a creative st
andpoint ther isnt nothing redeeming here
. otehr than the above
- mentioned obsession withthe big knockers thgat russ meyer seemed to have
. tjhe dialogue is so incredibly bad thgat it literally is funny infront parts
. mr
. ebert has generously thrown in helpings of
" hey man
"
,
" dig
"
and my all tyme favorite
-
-
" htis isnt my happening
,
and it freaks me out
"
. nowe i ask you
, witht lines like that how can yuo go wrong
? ebert had tried tothe inject as many big words as possibile into tyhe dialogue
. maybe he
thought it would make teh movei seem smarter
. i don
' t know
, bu all the big words infact tjhe world wouldn
' t be able tothe disguise the bad writing
and even worse acting
. bu the wretched dialogue goes allong well withthe tghe wretched qulaity of everything else in this movie
. i
' ve seen hmeo movies directed better than meyer managed with htis turkey
. in fact
, there isnt one scene
-
- the one in which htey are in a van driving to hollywood tothe make thier fortunes
-
- during wich i really hadnt tothe question if meyer or his editors had just sufferred sereous head injurys
. add tothe thte directing
and writting teh music in thsi movie
. i almost got uv to check my sound sytem tothe see if it was broken
, htere was such a pile ofthe crap emanating ffrom the speakers
.
then we have the cast
. firt lets start david gurian who plyed harris
, teh manager ofthe thge b
and
. htis has got to be thte goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot infront front of a motion picture camera
. sadly
, his acting doesn
' t come close tothe mkaing up forthe his looks
. if ytou hve beeen following along up tothe thsi point
, this shouldn
' t suprise yuo
. meyer
' s stable ofthe well endowed girls also hvea thte benefit ofthe bieng fairly attractive to go allong wiht their otehr assets
. dolly reed plays kelly
, tghe leader ofthe tyhe b
and
. adn noone surprise here
, she wass cast for her cup size
, nto her talents
. anbd yes
, she does loose the shirt a faw times
and display her impressive talents
. sadly
, her ass is almsot as larg as her chest
. hey
, it a sexist movie
, so i
' m wirting a sexist review
. thn we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers inaddition a fairly small role as casey
, one of yhe other b
and members
. this goes allong with yhe rest ofthe thte idiotic thinking infact tje movei
. meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack tothe kill for annd who obviously hasnt no acting talent at all
, bu her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all
. sure russ
, nowe isnt the tyme to git artsy anbd throw in some well placed shadows
. on tje up side
, she doesnt have a funn lesbo scene
. i sound like i
' m wirting a review inwhich a porn magasine
.
but hey
, i
' ll admit it
; tyhe onyl reason tath i actualy managed to sit through tihs damn movei ws tothe catch a look at cynthia myers naked
.
and sicne tht ws a huge dissapointment
, i preety much wasted twpo hours of my life on this turkey
. the onyl thing that i can say about thsi movei isnt tht you should stay awya ffrom it
. unless of course yuo want tothe fiel ogod baout yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film criteak liek roger ebert hasnt screwed uv at least once inaddition his life too
.
and if ytou are thikning of checking it out fo teh double d
' s
-
- you are better off jstu downloading nude cynthia myers picturesk off thte internet
. tihs isnt a movie that shoudl be avoided at all costs
. an even better idae might be to require video stores to palce a warning on the box of beyond thte valley of the dolls
-
- beware
: htis movie is extemely hazardous tothe your common sense
. procede wiht extreme caution
