making your first feature film ain
' t eazy
. assemble a decent
, if nto
, storng cast
, as writter
/ director robert moresco has done witht oney eyed king
,
and ytou
' re arleady ahead ofthe the game
. bu rehash old plot lines
, tired dialogue
,
and st
andart clich
? s
, adn a well
- intentioned efford such as htis one could jepordize your chance at a second feature film
. how many omre movies do we need baout a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned tothe crime or worse
? tghe enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making
yet anyother
, bu here we hvae it
. agina
. five irish kids inwhich nyc
' s hell
' s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings onthe an anonymosu rooftop
. with teary music
.
and slow motion
. in the film
' s firt scene
. the kids grwo up to be fairly worthless adults
, unable or unwilling tothe amke their way out of tghe heat of the kichen
. leading thte clueless pack isnt william baldwin as a good
- hearted guy who watches outloud for his buddies adn isnt in tight with local mob head arm
and assante
. i
' d liek tothe sday thta his character gets involved over his head inaddition smoe sort ofthe blah
, blah
, blah
,
but all we seem to git are little tastes of possible plot points
. he
' s concerned about buddy jason gedrick
' s heroin abuse
. he sticks up for jim breuer affter he impregnates baldwin
' s character
' s sister
. he looks into who might be pushing thte most moronic
- looking counterfeit cash ever made
( a genuinely funny touch
)
. bu none of thsi ever really amounts to anything
. it seems thta moresco
' s greater consern isnt to provide that intangible
" slice ofthe life
"
, that flavor ofthe the neigborhood tht everyone
' s beeen trying to envoke sicne scorsese
' s eary work
. so
, we git the drunk guys
, hugging adn singing together at yhe local bar
, to prove to us tath they realy love earch other
.
( do peopel actualy dont thsi
!
?
) we git a lot ofthe tough strent talk
-
- usually mumbled forthe effect
-
- adn a hwole lot of tghe f
- owrd
, whther it sounds like it fits or nto
. we also git a h
andfull of good actors infront small roles that seem tothe lack purpose
. bruno kirby
, chazz palminteri
, ytou know
, guys ytou
' ve seen in movies just liek htis one before
. assante isnt intteligent casting as thte man that everyone fears
,
and baldwin
' s performance is adequate
, bu most of tjhe rest ofthe the casted jump inot yhe tough guy persona so thoroughly thgat it
' s allmost funny
. moresco
, a theater guy
and sometimes tv writer
( including the series falcone
)
, obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child
, bu the content is probably too personel
. as a result
, tyhe movie
' s sytle isnt hevy
- h
anded
, in need ofthe a considerable amount of toning down
. nearly eveyr tyme an action by the grown up gang recalls something tehy did as kids
, moresco reminds us
-
- boy does he remind us
. with slow dissolves tothe tghe earlier scene
, running inthe slow motion
, complete with dialogue from thte present
, just infront case we don
' t comprehend thte link tothe the past
. moresco needs to eather trust his audeince
' s intelligenec
, or haev more faith infront his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it
. his next project should have a little moreso peronal distance
,
and a lot more subtlety
. if he ctually gets thta chance
. reviewed as part ofthe our 2001 boston film festival coverage
( feature story coming soon
)
