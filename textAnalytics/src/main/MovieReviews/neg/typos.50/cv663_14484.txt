. add tothe taht list
_ urban
_ legend
_
, whihc tkaes a promising premise annd runs it through a predicatble meat grinder ofthe idiocy
. teh influence ofthe williamson on screenwriter silvio horta isnt clear inspite two key areas
. frist
, the opening sequence
, liek that ofthe
_ scream
_
, is an extended set piece detailing the singular muder that gets teh proverbial ball rolling
. thsi sequence
, in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini
( natasha gregson wagner
) is decapitated while driving
, aslo reveals the otehr obviously williamson
- esque touch
: teh killer
' s look
. dressed inaddition a larg hooded parka
, wielding an axe
, the killer bears omre thna a passing resemblance tothe tjhe

.
_ fisherman
, sans thte hook
. one hting horta doens not borrow from williamson
, howver
, is tjhe intriguing premise
. students at pendleton are bieng killed by way ofthe urban legends
-
- those contamporary bits ofthe
" mythology
" passed ffrom person tothe person
, gropu tothe group
, yearm to year that become so embeded iin tjhe social consiciousness
. it hardly matters if they are true or nto
, such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks anbd pepsi
( he didn
' t
)
. michelle
, slain by the
" killer lurking in the backseat
" of lore
, isnt
but tjhe first to fall prey to an urban legend come true
; as the body count rises
, fellow pendleton student natalie
( alicia witt
) suspects nto onyl a link between the murders
, bu a personel link to her past as well
. teh setup shows promise
,
but the stroy never takes off
, due in large part to horta
and yhe directer
, yhe aptly named jamie blanks
, who fires round afer round ofthe his namesake in terms of suspense
and scares
. too many of the would
- be shocks are fakeouts reliant onthe bombastic music cues
,
and the film
' s chase scenes are riddled withthe tjhe cliches that
_ scream
_ tried to subvert
, like screaming damsels knowingly runnung themselves inot dead ends whn they shoudl
-
- anbd could
-
- run out tje front doorjam
. bu that isnt jsut tje tip of the iceberg when it comes tothe cliches
; there
' s allso tyhe climactic villian confession
, iin which a contrived
and way
- too
- convenient motive isnt revealed
, not tothe mention the credit kard oppening up the locked door trck
, whitch isnt a cliche inspite any film genre
. banks annd horta
' s
( intentional
) attempts at humor are also lame
; the fatc that thte best gags are lazy
, in
- jokey refernces to the other credits ofthe co
- stars joshua jackson
and rebecca gayheart says a lot baout the immagination of thier humer
. smoe laughs are alsot had whn the rether predicatble identity ofthe thge killer is revealed
,
but i
' m nto so sure if soem of the mroe hilarious things baout it weere meaned to be so
. the filmmakers don

, bu i
' d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff
and uncharismatic witt

; witt hasnt a pefect foil inspite her equally pesence

_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo
; gayheart displays all tjhe depth
and range of

, a noxzema spokeswoman
;
and robert englund lends tyhe film littel moreso than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor
. granted
, yhe cast is hampered by their material
. loretta devine
, who hasnt done some fine work infact films such as
_ waiting
_ tothe
_ exhale
_
, is saddled with tghe ridiculous role ofthe a pam grier
- worshiping cumpus security guard
. the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely onthe thte effords one man
-
- namely
, kevin williamson
-
- tothe stay alive
. if other filmmakers continue tothe mkea such shoddy product as
_ urban
_ legend
_
, the genre looks tothe once again go the way ofthe screen slashers
' many victims
