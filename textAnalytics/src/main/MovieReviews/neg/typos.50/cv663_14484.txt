-
- frighteningly
, insultingly
_ bad
_
. add tothe thyat list
_ urban
_ legend
_
, which takes a promising premise
annd runs it through a predicatble meat grinder ofthe idiocy
. tjhe influence of williamson onthe screenwriter silvio horta isnt clear inthe two key areas
. firt
, hte oppening sequence
, liuke tht of
_ scream
_
, is an extended setted peice detailing the singular murder thast gets the proverbial ball rolling
. thsi sequence
, in whlch pendleton college coed michelle mancini
( natasha gregson wagner
) isnt decapitated hwile driving
, also reveals the otehr obviously williamson
- esque touch
: tjhe killer ' s look
. dressed infact a larg hooded parka
, wielding an axe
, tghe killer bears more thna a passing ressemblence tothe thte

.
_ fisherman
, sans the hook
. oney hting horta doens nto borrow from williamson
,
howver
, isnt the intriguing premise
. students at pendleton are bieng killed by way ofthe urban legends
-
- those contemporary bits ofthe
" mythology
" pasted ffrom person tothe person
, group to gropu
, yera tothe year that become so embedded in yhe social consiciousness
. it hardly matters if tehy are true or not
, such as the tall tale thast mikey ffrom the life cereal commercials died ffrom a fatal combination ofthe pop rocks
anbd pepsi
( he didn ' t
)
. michelle
, slain by tjhe
" killer lurking inaddition teh backseat
" ofthe lore
, isnt
bu the firt tothe fall prey tothe an urban legend come true
; as the body count rises
, fellow pendleton student natalie
( alicia witt
) suspects nto onyl a link between the murders
,
bu a personal link to her past as well
. the setup shows promise
,
but tjhe story never tkaes off
, due infront larg part tothe horta
and the directer
, the aptly named jamie blanks
, who fires round afer round ofthe his namesake in terms ofthe suspense
adn scares
. too many ofthe the owudl
- be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues
,
annd tjhe film ' s chase scenes are riddled with hte cliches thta
_ scream
_ tryed tothe subvert
, like screaming damsels knowingly runing themselves into dead ends when htey should
-
-
and coudl
-
- run outloud the front door
.
bu tht is jstu the tip ofthe the iceberg wehn it comes tothe cliches
; there ' s allso tjhe climactic villain confession
, iin wich a contrived
and way
- too
- convienient motive isnt revealed
, nto tothe mention teh credit kard opening up thte locked door trick
, whihc is a cliche infact any film genre
. banks
anbd horta ' s
( intentional
) attempts at humer are aslo lame
; the fact taht the best gags are lazy
, infront
- jokey references to the other credits of co
- stars joshua jackson
and rebecca gayheart says a lot baout tjhe imagination of their humer
. soem laughs are aslo hadnt wehn tje rether predictable idenity of the killer is revealed
,
bu i ' m nto so sure if smoe ofthe yhe more hilarious things about it weere meaned tothe be so
. tyhe filmmakers don ' t git much help fomr their onscreen talent
. i ws far ffrom a fan of bland

_ starlet jennifer lveo hewitt
,
bu i ' d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff
and uncharismatic witt
, whose inept attempts at emoting were oftenly met with laughter
; witt hasnt a pefect foil iin her equally pesence
- challenged leading man
, jared leto
.
_ dawson ' s
_ creek
_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo
; gayheart displays all thge depth
anbd range of
, well
, a noxzema spokeswoman
;
annd robert englund lends the film littel omre than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professer
. granted
, tyhe cast isnt hampered by thier material
. loretta devine
, who hasnt done soem fine work in films such as
_ waiting
_ tothe
_ exhale
_
, is saddled wih the ridiculous role ofthe a pam grier
- worshiping cumpus security guard
. hte recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the effords one man
-
- namely
, kevin williamson
-
- to stay alive
. if other filmmakers continue tothe make such shoddy product as
_ urban
_ legend
_
, the genre looks tothe once again go the way ofthe screen slashers ' many victims
