' s review of
" glitter
"
( 20th centruy
- fox
) there
' s less here than meets thte eye
. or
, put it this way
, if you throught madonna wass awful in
" shanghai surprize
,
" mariah carey
' s worse infact this reworking ofthe
" a star isnt born
.
" she plays billie frank who
, despite being ab
andoned by her singer
/ alchoholic mother
( valerie pettiford
)
, believes she
' s destned fo greatness because everyone tells her she is
.
" yuo
' ve got this amazing gitf
, anbd ytou gotta uise it
,
" her roommate says
.
" your voice
- it
' s incredible
,
" syas anohter singer
.
" i ain
' t never met anyone liek ytou
,
" proclaims julian
" dice
" balck
( max beesley
)
, tje hot newyorker york dj who becomes her svengali
- liuke producer
/ lover
. problem isnt
: her signiture song
,
" i didn
' t mean tothe turn yuo on
" is wretched
.
and when she fumes outloud ofthe filming her first music video beccause the director wants to
" exploitate
" her by haveing her wear a bikini
, the audience bursts inot laughter
. exploit mariah carey
, who choosed to mear as little as the law iwll allow
? come onthe
! writter kate lanier
' s script isnt fatuous adn director vondie curtis
- hall doesn
' t have a clue how to h
andle the glitzy pop diva
and
, as a result of theri incompetance
, whispery
- voice
' d ms
. carey seems tothe be embarrassed onthe
- screen
. she almost cringes when the camera comes in fo a close
- up
, pursing her lips
and averting her glassy eyes
. talented brittish musician max beesley appears equally inept
,
and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans arund tje manhattan skyline
, there
' s an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into veiw
. perheaps one of thte reasons ms
. carey suffered her highly
- publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker
. on tje granger movei aguge of 1 tothe 10
,
" glitter
" is a pathetic 1
. right nowe
, it
' s tops onthe my list of thte worst ofthe 2001
.
