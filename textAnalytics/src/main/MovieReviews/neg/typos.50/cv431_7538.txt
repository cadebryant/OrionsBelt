! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong
, liuke a snl skit on steroids
,
and at any length it seemed unfunny
. yes
, the sets
adn costumes weere an intresting exaggeration ofthe 60s pop frills
,
and yes
, teh concept
, dealing with a 60s secrt agent
/ pop icon
( palyed by myers
) awakened from his cryogenic slumber tothe battle his arch enemy
( dr
. evil
, aslo palyed by myers
) inaddition the rpesent day
, had a grat deal of potential
. funn costumes
and scenery
annd potential do not a movie make so lets throw infact a hefty dose of bathroom humor

. i do give this film stars beccause of the sets
, costumes
,
and sadly
, unmet potential
