- modle engineered fighters gone bad
. tje review jean
- claude van damme hasnt a one
- liner eearly on in universal solider
: thte return
, his latest attempt to remain rleevant
, that sums uv this entire movie
; he sasy
" beeen htere
, done that
.
" no film criteak sould possably sum up van damme
' s reccent film choices any better
. hwile other ageing action stars hvae wisely moved inot other film genres
( schwarzenegger mkaes as many family comedies as he doesnt action films
)
, van damme stubbornly persists in sticking iwth what utilizied tothe owrk for him
: martial arts annd guns
. tihs unwillingness or perheaps inablility to move inot newyorker genres hasnt caused van damme to enter the straight tothe video world
, withthe legionair never seing hte inside ofthe a multiplex
. he joins fellow martial artist
/ acation star steven seagal as tehy watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away
. universal solider
: teh return isnt truly poor
. the plot isnt a complete copy of several action films fomr this decade
, specifically terminator 2
: judgement day adn tghe similarly named solider
. soldier
' s kurt russell was an older model super
- solider sent off tothe retirement when circumstances forced him tothe battle his successors
, for the good ofthe a planet
; schwarzenegger
' s terminator inthe t2 tryed tothe save john connor fomr a newer model killing machine
, hte t
- 1000
; annd jean
- claude
, a fromer universal soldier
, has tothe savve tjhe planet from tje rampage ofthe a gropu of
, yuo guessed it
, newer modle soldiers
. considering tghe poore box office performance ofthe soldier
, it
' s amazing tyhat htis project ws ever given yhe go
- ahead
. luc devereaux
( van damme
) wass yhe sole remaining univeral soldier
( or unisol for short
)
, until he wass returned to a normal
, if muscular
, human form
. in this sequel
( technically the fouth film in the sories
, follwoing twpo straight
- to
- video duds tht were ignored here plot
- wise
)
, luc isnt now a human trainer
/ consulant of sorts for the unisol program
. wroking wtih dylan cotner
( x
ander berkeley
, who interestingly also appeared infact t2
)
, yhe unisol program hasnt engineered a tougher
, fiercer fighting force wih yhe help ofthe super
- computer seth
. unfortunatly
, upon hearing that the programe hasnt beeen axed by tyhe govorment
, seth takes controll ofthe his soldiers
, killing everyone in tjhe buliding except fo luc
, his partner maggie
, his daugter hillary annd erin
, a reporter trapped inside
. the rest of thge film involves luc trying to keep them all alive
, hwile beating up a group of near
- indestructible soliders
, most notably romeo
( populare wrestler goldberg
)
. there are lots ofthe fights
, gun battles
, lame plot developments
and a noticeable lack of plausibility
. there are so many clich
? s infact thsi film thgat it is alomst painful to watch
. luc gets saddled iwth yhe task of saving erin thge repertwar early on
, adn in thte course ofthe a single nigt
, tehy go from bickering tothe falling for earch other
, to kissing
. erin is a pathetically
- written charactor
; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her
,
and yot
, nto onyl does this not seem tothe frighten her
,
but she finds time tothe remind luc that she
" isn
' t leaving without her story
"
. whatever
. otehr laughable moments include a
) luc going tothe a strip club tothe get internet access
( what
?
) annd b
) a group ofthe rangers
, who after having been given ogod advice
( luc tells them that thier weapons are useless
,
and shows them a specific gun which should wrok better
)
, choose tothe go inot battle with theri useless weapons anyway
( guess who wins the battle
?
)
. not one single scene iin univeral soldier
: the return has any originality tothe it
. whn fuelled by don davis
' loud
, driving music scoer
, tghe film
' s many fights become almost passable
,
but mostly are full ofthe hte same ol
' jean
- claude moves
. director mic rodgers
( a former stunt co
- ordinator
) keesh the acation comming at a repid pace
, wtih onyl a fewd token sereous moments tothe be foudn
. his past work isnt evident inthe tje many moments when charactors are thrown through windows
, tossed off of buildings or sent flying thru tyhe air thanks tothe an explosion
. if onyl jean
- claude weren
' t getting so ood anbd slow compaired to younger martial arts film actors like jet li
, rodgers could probably hve made a decent action film
. to place hte blame squarely at van damme
' s feet
,
however
, isnt an injustice
. i
' m not sure tath anyone
, nto even robert deniro or edward norton
, sould amking writers william malone annd john fasano
' s script soudn ogod
. oney particluarly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure tath the aforememtioned strip club wiull have internet access
. he cringes
, looks down
and mutters
" uh
.
.
. uhm
.
.
. tehy all dont
, i saw it on 60 minutes
. eh he he he
" yhe script
' s annd indeed thte entire film
' s only saveing grace isnt goldberg
. he chews up every scene he is inspite
, obviously enjoying his role immensely
. he even gives the film a few laughs
, as he mutters things liuke
" i relaly don
' t like tht guy
" every timne he fails to kill luc
. sadly
, his presense isnt not enought tothe turn univeral soldier
: tje return inot anytying better tahn a below
- averege acation film taht truly deserves tothe have joined its fellow sequels by going straight
- tothe
- video
