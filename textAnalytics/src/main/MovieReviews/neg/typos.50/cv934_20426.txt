- universal soldier luc has to battle a group ofthe newer
- model engineered fighters gone bad
. tje review jean
- claude van damme has a oney
- liner eary on in universal solider
: tghe return
, his latest attempt tothe reamin erlevant
, that sums up this entire movei
; he syas
" beeen there
, done thgat
.
" no film critic sould possibly sum up van damme ' s receet film choices any better
. hwile otehr ageing action stars hvea wisely moved inot other film genres
( schwarzenegger makse as many family comedies as he doesnt acation films
)
, van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with waht utilisied to work fo him
: martial arts
annd guns
. this unwillingness or perphas iability tothe move into newyorker genres hasnt caused van damme tothe enter teh straight tothe video world
, wiht legionnaire never seing tje inside of a multiplex
. he joins fellow martial artist
/ acation star steven seagal as tehy watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away
. univeral solider
: tghe return is truly poore
. tghe plot isnt a complete copy of sevral action films from htis decade
, specifically terminator 2
: judgement day
and thte similiarly named soldier
. soldier ' s kurt russell was an older modle super
- solider sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors
, forthe the ogod of a planet
; schwarzenegger ' s terminator in t2 tryed tothe sive john connor ffrom a newer model killing machine
, teh t
- 1000
;
adn jean
- claude
, a fromer univeral solider
, has tothe sive thte planet from teh rampage of a group ofthe
, ytou guessed it
, newer modle soldiers
. concidering the poore box office performance ofthe solider
, it ' s amazing thgat tihs project wass ever given the go
- ahead
. luc devereaux
( van damme
) was the sole remainging universal soldier
( or unisol for short
)
, utnil he was retured tothe a normal
, if muscular
, human form
. infact tihs sequel
( technically the fourth film iin the series
, folowing two straight
- tothe
- video duds tht weere ignored here plot
- wise
)
, luc is now a human trainer
/ consulant ofthe sorts forthe hte unisol program
. wokring wiht dylan cotner
( xander berkeley
, who interestingly also appeared in t2
)
, the unisol program hasnt engineered a tougher
, fiercer fighting force with the help of super
- cmoputer seth
. unfortunatly
, apon hearing thta tje program hasnt been axed by tjhe govorment
, seth takes control of his soldiers
, killing everyone infront hte buiding exept fo luc
, his partner maggie
, his duaghter hillary
anbd erin
, a repertwar trapped inside
. tghe rest ofthe the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive
, hwile beating uv a gropu ofthe near
- indestructible soliders
, most notably romeo
( populare wrestler goldberg
)
. ther are lots ofthe fights
, gun battles
, lame plot developments
and a notceable lack of plausibility
. htere are so many clich
? s inthe this film thgat it isnt alomst painful to watch
. luc gets saddled with hte task of saving erin tje reporter early onthe
,
and in tje course ofthe a single nigth
, htey go ffrom bickering to falling for earch otehr
, to kissing
. erin is a pathetically
- written character
; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her
,
and
yot
, nto only does thsi not seem to frighten her
,
but she finds tyme to remind luc that she
" isn ' t leaving wihtout her story
"
. whatever
. otehr laughable moments includ a
) luc going tothe a strip club tothe git internet access
( waht
?
)
anbd b
) a group of rangers
, who after haveing beeen given ogod advice
( luc tells them that thier weapons are useless
,
and shows them a specific gun which should work better
)
, choose tothe go into battle with theri useless weapons anyway
( guess who wins the battle
?
)
. nto noe single scene infront universal soldier
: tje return has any originality tothe it
. wehn fuelled by don davis ' loud
, driving music score
, the film ' s many fights become alomst passable
,
but mostly are full of tghe smae ol ' jean
- claude moves
. directer mic rodgers
( a fromer stunt co
- ordinator
) keesh tjhe action coming at a rapid pace
, with onyl a few tolkein serious moments to be found
. his past work is evident in the many moments whn cahracters are thrown thru windows
, tossed off ofthe buildings or sent flying thru tjhe air thanks tothe an explosion
. if only jean
- claude weren ' t getting so old
adn slow compared to younger martial arts film actors liuke jet li
, rodgers sould probably ahev made a decent acation film
. tothe palce the blaim squarely at van damme ' s feets
,
however
, isnt an injustice
. i ' m not sure that anyone
, nto even robert deniro or edward norton
, could make writers william malone
anbd john fasano ' s script soudn ogod
. one prticularly painful scene is wehn erin asks luc how he isnt so sure that the aforememtioned strip club wiull hve internet access
. he cringes
, looks down
adn mutters
" uh
.
.
. uhm
.
.
. they all do
, i saw it onthe 60 minutes
. eh he he he
" hte scirpt ' s
and indeed tyhe entire film ' s onyl saveing grace is goldberg
. he chews uv eveyr scene he isnt infact
, obviously enjoying his role immensely
. he even gives the film a fewd laughs
, as he mutters things like
" i raelly don ' t like thyat guy
" eveyr time he fails to kill luc
. sadly
, his presence isnt not enought tothe turn universal soldier
: the return inot anytying better tahn a below
- average action film that truley deserves tothe haev joined its fellow sequels by goign straight
- to
- video
