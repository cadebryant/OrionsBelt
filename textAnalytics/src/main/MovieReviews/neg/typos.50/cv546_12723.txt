. perhaps it was because i wass tired when i watched it
. perhaps
. perhaps it wass beccause i had seen richards preform most ofthe yhe smae schtick a thous
and times on seinfeld
. perhasp
. perhaps it was because teh movie just wasn
' t funny
. absolutly
. teh lack ofthe humour wasn
' t the only issue thast i hadnt wiht tihs film either
. thge movie attempts to weave a couple of lvoe storis through its vision
,
but unforetunately
