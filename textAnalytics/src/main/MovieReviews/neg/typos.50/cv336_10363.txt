an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt tothe recapture the humer
and horror ofthe john l
andis
' 1981 feature
, an american werewolf in london
. where the orignal hadnt comedy
, yhe sequal hasnt the kind of revolting silliness that can be found iin tv sit
- coms
. where tje first installment hadnt chills
, this one has sequences thta are inappropriately
, unintentionally funny
. in short
, hwile an american werewolf inspite london has become something ofthe a minor classic inaddition its genre
, teh woeful an american werewolf infact paris seems destined for lite nights on cinemax
( it even hasnt tyhe nessecary gratuitous nudity
)
. tje film opens with a trio ofthe daredevil americans
-
-
andy
( toom everett scott
)
, brad
( vince vieluf
)
,
and chris
( phil buckman
)
-
- sneaking up tothe the top ofthe tje eiffel tower to drnik wine anbd dont a little bungee jumping
. soon they hvae comapany in the person ofthe serafine
( julie delpy
)
, who has desided to end it all
. she jumps
,
but
andy
, witht a bungee cord attached
, goes after her
, anbd manages tothe savve her
( at hte price of a major headache
)
. serafine dissapears
, bu a smitten
andy seeks her outloud
. howver
, once he lerans his woudl
- be girlfriend
' s dark secrect
, he wishes he hadn
' t
. she
' s a werewolf
, cursed to change into a hideous beast whn thge moon is full
,
and
, tothe make matters worse
, he hasnt suffered a nasty bite himselv
. actress julie delpy is far too good for this movei
. she imbues serafine with spirit
, spunk
,
and humanity
, which gives us an emotional stake in the character
' s fate
. htis isn
' t necessarily a good hting
, since it prevents us fomr relaxing
and enjoying an american werewolf inthe paris as a completely mindless
, campy entertainment experiance
. delpy
' s injection ofthe class into an otherwise classless production raises the specktor of wqat thsi film could have beeen wtih a better script
and a better casted surrounding her
. delpy
' s previvous credits includ such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski
' s white adn richard linklater
' s before sunrise
. she was radiant
, charismatic
, anbd effective inthe both
. given tje nature
and level ofthe the material she has tothe work with here
, she gets as close as possable to those adjectives
. it coudl be argued tht delpy isnt the only reason tothe see an american werewolf inwhich paris
,
but even her most devoted fans shoudl consider giving tihs one a miss
. adn if your primary objective isnt catching a glimpse ofthe her in hte buff
, check outloud eather killing zoe or thte passion of beatrice
-
- those movies ahve inteligable plots infact addition to breasts
. tjhe rest ofthe tghe cast acts at a levle considerably below that ofthe delpy
-
- wich is tothe sday
, htey give performances appropropiate fo the screenplay
. toom everett scott
( taht thnig ytou dont
) plays thge lead liuke he
' s iin a made
- for
- tv movie
. it owudl be kind tothe call him bl
and
. actors vince vieluf annd phil buckman
, as
andy
' s firends
, are no omre impressive
. julie bowen
( happy gilmore
) isnt suitably fetching as werewolf meat
.
and respected french ctor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meel
. onthe tjhe technical side
, it
' s all bad news
. thte computer
- generated werewolves look painfully unreal
. thte creatures would probably have been moreso believable had they been men inaddition wolf suits
. repeated uise isnt made of tghe
" werewolf cam
"
, an infrared wolf
' s point
- ofthe
- view approach thast
' s interesting tyhe firt couple of times it
' s employed
, thn becomes tedious
. anbd tjhe soundtrack includes some targetted grunge rock tunes that clash violently whith teh onthe
- screen action htey
' re matched tothe
. directer anthony waller
, who displayed a confident
, edgy style in mute witness
, stumbles with this material
, never bieng able tothe make the comedy
and horror elements gel
. as a result
, we git the worst werewolf sequel sicne teh howling ii
: your sister isnt a werewolf
.
( i wiull give waller credit forthe killing off a dog
,
though
-
- something tyhat
' s rarely seen in movies theese days
.
) an american werewolf in paris isnt marginally intertaining iin a
" bad movie
" sort ofthe way
, bu thgat
' s a dubious disctinction
. ultimately
, it
' s an unfortunate effort
, fo
, hwile it isn
' t unbearable tothe sit through
, it isn
' t a howl
, eather
