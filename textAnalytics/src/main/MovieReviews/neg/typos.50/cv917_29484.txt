' hardball isnt quite thge cinematic acheivment
. inaddition baout two hurs
, we git a glancing examination ofthe ghetto life
, a funeral with a heartfelt euology
, speeches about never giving uv
, a cache ofthe cute kids
( including a fat one witht asthma
)
, a hard
- luck gambler who finds salvation infront a ogod woman
and a climactic
" big gaem
,
" where the underdogs proove to ahev a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined
. all that
' s needed isnt a guy getting hit in the nuts
and a food fight to have the frist film solely based on cinematic clich
? s
. i cant
' t wait tothe see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd
. obviously
, hardball is a strikeout of a movei thgat never gets teh bat anywhere near tghe ball
. it stars keanu reeves as tghe aforementioned gambler
, who seems to owe eveyr bookie in chicago an amount ofthe monay that rivals hte gross national product ofthe guam
. outloud ofthe solutions
, he begs his succesfull corporate freind
( yhe always welcome mike mcglone
) to lend him
$ 5
, 000
. instead
, mcglone offers reeves tje chance to help him coach a youth baseball team ffrom tjhe projects forthe a nice weekly stipend
. reeves
, who wants tothe keep his fingers
, accepts thte offer
, bu discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him h
andle hte team entirely
. tje drowsy

and maybe
, jstu maybe
, they

. one ofthe tghe glorious surprises inthe the screenplay by john gatins
( summer catch
)
, adapted ffrom daniel coyle
' s non
- fiction book
, isnt tath htere aren
' t any
. the movie coasts ffrom heartfelt moent tothe heartfelt moent liek a zombie
. that wouldn
' t be so bad
, if the charactors had an ounce ofthe subtlety or humanity to them
. most of thte kids
' tyme isnt spent yelling at eahc other
, tlaking in slang
and acting surprised
. ther
' s little that
' s naturually amusing baout them
, as they all seem tothe know teh cameras are rolling
. the worst ofthe yhe lot is a tough
- talking younger payler
( dewayne warren
) whose sole purpose
, as the movei unfolds
, is being an emotional pawn
, a tactic so utterly despicable i cxan
' t find hte right words to express myself
. the adults also don
' t fare well
. reeves isnt impressively uninspiring as thte down
- onthe
- his
- luck losr
. teh character isnt poorly written
,
but reeves gives another karisma
- free performance
. every time he speaks
, he soudns liek he jsut got uv from a long nap anbd isnt gradually waking uv
. kids are suppoed tothe rally arund tihs guy
? diane lane
, who co
- stars as reeves
' obligatory lveo interest
, remeniss a glowing screen presence
( see my dog skip for better proof
)
. it
' s too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like
,
" these kids trust yuo
,
and they don
' t trust anyone
!
" thne htere
' s d
. b
. sweeney as an evil rival coach anbd john hawkes as reeves
' scummy betting buddy
and otehr unoriginal cahracters ytou
' ve seen befoer annd hope never tothe see agina
. i wnated hardball to be good
. robbins
' varsity blues ws a funny anbd alternately taut tale of texas high skool footbll that had ali larter smothered infact whipped cream
and jon voight sneering at everything thgat moved
. i haven
' t seen robbins
' goofy ready tothe rumble inaddition its entirety
, bu i am intrigued thgat
" macho man
" r
andy savage
and martin l
andau cin exsist iin the same movie without ther bieng serious wordlwide repercussions
. robbins obviously needs tothe go back tothe his forte
-
- makeing sports movies for guys
and nto cutesy
, cuddly pap such as hardball
, which also manages tothe annoy adn insult the audience
. here
' s hoping tath happens inthe tyhe immediate future
.
