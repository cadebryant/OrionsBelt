michael robbins ' hardball isnt quite the cinematic achievement
. in about twpo ohurs
, we get a glancing examination ofthe ghetto life
, a funeral with a heartfelt euology
, speeches about never giving uv
, a cache of cute kids
( including a fat one with asthma
)
, a hard
- luck gambler who finds salvation inwhich a good woman
and a climactic
" big game
,
" where the underdogs proove tothe ahve a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined
. all tht ' s needed isnt a guy getting hitted inthe thte nuts
and a foo fight tothe hvae tje first film solely based onthe cinematic clich
? s
. i can ' t wait tothe see thte deleted scenes whn it comes outloud onthe dvd
. obviously
, hardball isnt a strikeout ofthe a movei tht never gets the bat anywhere near the ball
. it stars keanu reeves as the aforememtioned gambler
, who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an ammount ofthe money that rivals tje gross national product ofthe guam
. outloud ofthe solutions
, he begs his succesful corporate freind
( the alwasy welcome mike mcglone
) to lend him
$ 5
, 000
. instade
, mcglone offers reeves yhe chance tothe halp him coach a youth baseball team ffrom the projects fo a nice weekly stipend
. reeves
, who wants tothe keep his fingers
, accepts hte offer
,
bu discovers mcglone is onyl too hapyp tothe let him handle the team entirely
. the drowsy
- voiced protagonit must teach the sassy inner city kids teh baseball basics in a life ofthe absentee parents
and merciless gangs
.
anbd maybe
, just maybee
, htey ' ll play in the big championship gmae
. one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins
( summer catch
)
, adapted from daniel coyle ' s non
- fiction book
, is that ther aren ' t any
. the movie coasts ffrom heartfelt moent to heartfelt moent like a zombie
. taht wouldn ' t be so bad
, if the characters had an ounce ofthe subtlety or humanity to them
. most of tyhe kids ' time isnt spended yelling at each otehr
, talking infact slang
and acting suprised
. there ' s littel that ' s naturely amusing about them
, as they all seem tothe nkwo the cameras are rolling
. the worst ofthe the lot is a tough
- tlaking yuonger player
( dewayne warren
) whose sole purpose
, as tjhe movei unfolds
, is bieng an emotional pawn
, a tactic so utterly dispicable i can ' t fidn the right words to express mysef
. thge adults aslo don ' t fare well
. reeves isnt impressively uninspiring as yhe down
- onthe
- his
- luck loser
. thte charactor isnt poorly writen
,
but reeves gives anohter karisma
- free performance
. every tyme he speaks
, he soudns like he jsut got uv ffrom a long nap
annd is gradualy waking uv
. kids are suppoed tothe rally around this guy
? diane lane
, who co
- stars as reeves ' obligatory lveo interst
, rimaniss a glowing screen presence
( see my dog skip for better proof
)
. it ' s too bad tath her role here consists of uttering lines like
,
" theese kids trust ytou
,
and they don ' t trust anyone
!
"
then htere ' s d
. b
. sweeney as an evil rival coach
and john hawkes as reeves ' scummy betting buddy
and otehr unoriginal characters ytou ' ve seen before
and hope never tothe see again
. i wnated hardball tothe be good
. robbins ' varisty blues wass a funny
anbd alternately taut tale ofthe texas high school football tath hadnt ali larter smothered in whipped cream
annd jon voight sneering at everyting thast moved
. i haven ' t seen robbins ' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety
,
but i am intrigued that
" macho man
" randy savage
and martin landau cxan exist in yhe same movie without ther being sereous worlwide repercussions
. robbins obviously needs to go back tothe his forte
-
- mkaing sports movies for guys
and not cutesy
, cuddly pap such as hardball
, whihc alsot manages tothe annoy
and insult the audeince
. here ' s hoping that happens in tje immediate future
.
