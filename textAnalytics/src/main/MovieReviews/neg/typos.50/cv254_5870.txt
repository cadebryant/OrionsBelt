even the best comic ctor isnt at the mercy of his or her material
, as this subpar submarine comedy proves
. down periscope stars kelsey
" frasier
" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given comm
and ofthe his own ship as part of a corrupt officer
' s
( james coburn
) plan to get him out ofthe teh navy
. liek any lame emsemble comedy
, tjhe officer assigns him tothe a gropu ofthe misfits liek the guy who wants to be kicked outloud
, tghe fat guy who eats all tje time
, thge beautiful woman who doesn
' t belong htere
( lauren holly
)
, the second
- inwhich
- comm
and who does everthing by the book
( rob schneider
)
, tyhe crazy old guy who freaks everyone outloud
( harry dean stanton
)
and so on
.
then comes thte transparent plotline
. frist grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him
,
and thast comes courtesy a sad sighth gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard
. aftter tyhe ship is fixed uv come tje early drills
, where everyone seems completely inept
, liek the electrician who can
' t connect wires so instade lets the current run thru himselv every time grammer gets onthe hte phone
. finally
, adn this covers teh final hour of tghe movie
, grammer has to lead his men
( anbd holly
) tothe overcome yhe otehr ships inaddition a wargames exercice
. annd he hasnt tothe be a clever rebel tothe do it
, iin scenes that strech all levels ofthe believability
. first they
' re singing
" louie louie
" liek a bunch ofthe drunk sailors to throw thge radar ofthe teh other ship off
,
then thirty mintues later
, they
' re making whale mating noises to throw tghe radar ofthe the other ship off
. the hwole hwile
, evil captain coburn isnt overacting underwater
, cursing grammer
( as most peple watching teh movei probaly are too
)
. it
' s all predictable wihtout any orginial humer tothe redeem it
. the jokes are right out of
" mchale
' s navy
"
and other cut
- rate sitcoms of thte past
. there
' s noe scene where schneider looks through the ship
' s pantry inwhich disgust
, holds one food can up anbd announces
,
" this expired inthe 1966
!
" i yelled back at tjhe screen
,
" so doed these jokes
.
" i watched this movei with the whole family adn everyone hated it
. my mom wass so bored she brought out tyhe coupon book midway through adn
, around the strat of the second hour
, i started wirting my iwll
. the blaim cin
' t really be placed onthe the stars
,
though
. kelsey grammer is ogod infront this
, he jstu doesn
' t have anytying to wokr withthe
. his charater is said tothe haev gotten so drunk one night thast he had
" welcome aboard
" tatooed on his penis
. grammer probably did something even worse
-
- got raelly drunk anbd agreed tothe apeared in a movie he knew nothing baout
. same for holley
( save yhe penis part
)
, who isnt likeable infront down periscope just becasue she
' s so gorgeous
. as fo schneider
( whose charachter isnt downright annoying
)
, there was nowhere tothe go
but up aftter surf ninjas
, altho he
' s still in thte depths ofthe the comedy ocean aftter jumping the
" snl
" ship
. my theory is that down periscope is one ofthe thsoe movies tyhat got thte gren ight before yhe scirpt was even written as a formula comedy
(
" okay
, it
' s police academy iin the navy iwth frasier at tghe helm annd the chick from dumb
and dumber
.
"
)
and after everyone wass signed onthe turned into a disaster
. judging fomr the video box
, most otehr movei critics agree with me
. the onyl qoute the down periscope copy writers sould dig up came from thge prevue channel
' s jim ferguson
. i guess even jeff craig from
" 60 second preview
"
( who said tank girl
" kicks
butt
!
" wihtout ever seing it
) didn
' t like htis
.
