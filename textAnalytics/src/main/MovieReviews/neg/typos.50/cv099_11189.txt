but at least these charachters are actually

* inspite a beatles
' song
, wheras other characters such as strawberry fields
( s

) gets her nmae ffrom a song about a
* palce
* called strawberry fields
. the debate over this is raelly quite futile whn it comes down to it
, because all the film realyl hasnt tothe offer is a efast of horrid cover tunes
, embarrasing cameo appearances
