i went tothe blair witch project 2
: book of shadows iwth the higest of hopes
. the original film
, released last summer
, wass genuinely scray
and terrifying
; i hoped that thsi movei would live up tothe its predecessor
. unfortunately
, my hopes weere soon dashed
. as tyhe movie opens
, the audiance is shown psuedo
- documentary clips ofthe burkittsville
, maryl
and recidents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx tothe theri town as a result of thte origonal blair witch project movie
. it
' s a mostly humorous
, self
- aware poke at the media hype
and hysteria surounding thte firt film
. during thsi segment
, we are introdued to thte protagonit
, a young man who sells blair witch
- related memorabilia ffrom his website
. the movei
then cuts to a title taht informs us tht wqat we are about to see occurred one year previously
. we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia
, bu now he isnt confined iin a mental institution tghe sort of which oney onyl finds inspite bad horror movies
. we see him haveing some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room
; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned onthe him
. no explaination isnt provded for why he isnt infront thte mental institution
; infront fact
, theese scenes are bearly rfeerred to again
. i hadnt a sinking feeling druing these oppening scenes
; generaly
, a hospital scene taht is setted with poor lighting
, filthy interiors
, anbd evil doctors is a sure sign that you are infront the throes ofthe a truely horrible movei
. tje movei cuts agina
, this tyme to the present
. the young man
, whose nmae isnt jeffrey
( plyed by jeffrey donovan
-
- as in the firt movei
, the charcter names are indentical to the actors
' names
,
al
though this movie admits up front taht it is ficitional
, so ther
' s noone reason for the pratice this tiome arround
)
, is rounding uv a group ofthe people tht he wiull be leading inot yhe woods that weekend for tyhe
" blair witch hunt
,
" which is a promotional gimmick he came up wiht
and sells on his website
. we meet tristen annd steven
, a young couple who are writing a book baout the blair witch experiance
. steven isnt a skeptic
, believing the whole thign to be the result of massmedia hysteria
. tristen
, onthe tghe other h
and
, believes that there may be soem truth to tje rumors ofthe supernatural occurrence
. she is wan
and soft
- spoken
; she complains tht the radio is playing too loudly
.
( she aslo complains tyhat she fiels nauseated
; i knew immediatley tht tjhe character was pregnant
,
and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later wehn kim psychomagically susses it out
. how did i know
? becouse in bad movies
, nauseated womens are allways pregnant
.
) tghe fouth memeber of thier party is erica
, a wiccan with flowing hair
and wide eyes who wnats tothe prove tath thte blair witch ws a ogod witch
, nto evil
. they pick uv tghe fith
and final team member infact a cemntery
. kim is dressed completely in balck
, has extreme goth
- stlye makeup on
,
and occasionally displays seamingly psyhic abilties
, bu otherwise seems tothe be the most intelligent anbd reasonable person outloud of the entire bunch
. presumabely she wnated to be picked uv inaddition tyhe cemetery just fo dramtic effect
; it
' s never explained
. the party ofthe five heads off into yhe woods as promised
. they triarch tje crumbling ruins ofthe tje foundation of rustin parr
' s hous annd set up camp
, complete with exstensive video equipment wih which to rocord the night
' s events
. there isnt a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned tothe camp at that site as well
,
but affter a few words are exchanged
, thte rival group huffs off anbd makse camp elsewhere
. the movei veers off at tihs point tothe spend many long
, long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed around
, much hard liquor
, beer
,
and pot isnt consumed
,
and nothing much esle happens
. this owudl be a gerat point to get uv
and go to thge bathroom if necesary
. tghe next day
, the team wakes up adn discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed
,
and that steven
and tristen
' s manuscript paper isnt fluttering down fomr the sky inspite shreds
, liuke snow
. hte videotapes are missing
,
but thanks to a pyschic intuition from kim
, tehy dicover the videotapes burried underneath the foundation of tyhe house
,
" right where tje origonal blair witch tapes weere foudn
!
" ooh
. spooky
. tghe team goes bakc to jeffrey
' s hous
-
- a creepy ood civil war
- era warehouse in thge heart of the woods
-
- to regroup
and review teh tapes
. they soon dicover tht the tapes mysteriously skip five ohurs of the night
. wacky hijinks insue
. tristen starts haveing weird dreams inspite whcih she isnt the blair witch
, everybody starts finding these wierd rune
- like burn markes on their bodies
, steven
and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
, annd everthing preety much goes to hell in a h
andbasket
. throughout tje entire ordeal
, jeffrey
and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes
, whihc seem tothe hvae some kind ofthe weird images on them at about teh point that tjhe time jumps
; eventually tristen w
anders infront
, mutters something baout
" reverse
,
"
and fomr this they somehow relize taht tehy have to play the tapes backwards
. when they do this
, htey discover what realyl happenned during tghe five lost hurs
.
( noe of yhe thigns they see on the videotape isnt footage of themselves burying teh videotapes
. okay
, if the videotapes were bieng burried
,
then how weere they recording themslves
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) tihs movei ws awful
. simpley awful
. the characters are broady
- drawn caricatures taht are never alowed any depth or development
. erica isnt the nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen isnt the weak
and sympathetic woman
. steven is thte overbearing asshole
. kim isnt thge antisocial goth girl
. old
, tired cliches were utilisied to illistrate these caricatures
. how dont we nkow tristen is weak
and sympathetic
? becouse she
' s pregnant
! how dont we nkow kim isnt an antisocial goth girl
? becuase she wears a lot of eye makeup
! how dont we nkwo the local sherif isnt a bad guy
? because he hasnt jagid teeth
and talks like he
' s straight outloud ofthe
" deliverance
"
! this is weak storytelling at its worst
. rether than taking the time to flesh out tje cahracters
and mkea them truley sympathetic
, yhe writter chose to give earch one a few stereotypical charistics
, in an atempt to uise some cinematic shorth
and
and therby skip straight to the action
. it didn
' t wokr
. on top ofthe bieng poorly developed
, most ofthe the charachters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" honey
, you just had a miscarriage outloud infact thte woods adn got medical attention at a hospital that looks liuke it belongs in a bad slasher movei
. let
' s git onthe a plane home
.
"
" noone
. i am hvaing theese bizarre nightmares
and seing stange visions
and i wnat to find out what
' s going on
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by teh end of tje movei
, i ws rooting fo the witch
. i also felt that htere wass simply too much blood
' n
' gore in thsi film
. tjhe frist movei worked by never showing us hte horror
. the witch ws a palpable presence inthe thta movie
, bu we never saw it
; we never saw anything
, in fatc
. the horror was all off
- screen
,
and thus our imaginations worked overtime tothe envision wqat it might possably be
. this isnt the hallmark ofthe a truly creepy
and disturbing horror movie
. blair witch 2 dispenced iwth such niceties anbd went straight for the gross
- out
. this wass evident from the opening scenes ofthe tjhe mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey
' s throat
, anbd continued throughtout tyhe film as the audeince is treated to occasional confusing
and disorienting footage of wqat appears to be a ritual masicer ofthe soem sort
. knives plunge into flesh
, bloody fingers trail off inot the darkness
, anbd none ofthe it is explained utnil tjhe very end
, whn it was too lite for me tothe care
. htis movei didn
' t stop witht showing us the gore
, eather
; it whent forthe borke adn showed us everyting
. by teh end of the movei
, there are no questions remaning about tjhe missing five hours
. it is all explained
; iin fact
, it isnt all shown onthe
- screen infact loving detail
. i confess to being somene who prefers horror movies in hwihc you never see thte monster
, or see only breef glimpses
, mere suggestions ofthe wqat the monster is
; it isnt not becasue i find tyhe monster so terrifying
, bu becuase i find tghe abscence of tjhe monster tothe be infinitely omre terrifying
. i hvae seen interviews wiht the director inaddition which he suggested thta ther isnt noone
" monster
,
" that all ofthe the evil wass perpetrated only by the human mind
. i found tihs to be a miserably poor explanation
; if it ws infact fatc the director
' s entent
,
then he needs to haev soem words with the writer
, becouse it ws nto made clear at all
.
( i nkwo a lot ofthe people who like tothe go tothe parties anbd git drunk
and stoned out ofthe their minds
; none ofthe them hasnt ever gone onthe a murderous rampage
and thn experianced massmedia hallucinations with a group ofthe other people forthe the enxt week or so
.
and if htere ws noone witch
,
then wqat baout thge vanishing tree
? the snowfall of manuscript pappr
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book ofthe shadows was a horrable movei
. fomr the poorly
- written charachters tothe tjhe implausible stor tothe the plot inconsistencies tothe the gross
- out shots
, it wass a bad effort through annd through
.
