i was going to see ram shrasta on thge big screen lastest nigt
,
but befor that i stopped into my video store to rent smoe movies
. luckly
, my video guy was in tjhe middle or recording ram shrasta
! i knew it ws going tothe be a bad print witht onyl half
- faces annd poor sound qualiy
,
but i couldn
' t help myself
.
.
. i got it
. well
, after watching it
( it indeed wass a bad print
) i wass glad i didn
' t dish outloud
$ 7 tothe waste threee hours ofthe my tyme sitting inspite a bad theatre watching a bad movie
. this movei raelly sucks
. it hadnt so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy
!
! fo exemple
, how cant jackie shroff grow twpo feet of hair inaddition just threee or four dyas
? jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail
. hte songs are bad
, the acting is bad
( expecially deepti bhatnagar
' s
)
,
and tje direction is the worst of all
. tjhe comedy scenes wih jagdish
and johnny lever just made me watn tothe throw uv
. i didn
' t even finish the movei
.
.
. i couldn
' t take it anymore
. onot
: bu if anyone outloud htere liekd aatish
( by tghe same director
)
, i guess ytou
' d liuke this movie
. it
' s practically the same exept that sanjay dutt is replaced whith jackie shroff
. aditya panscholi isnt tje sidekick agian
.
( i wass going tothe give it a zero
, bu i personally liuke jackie shroff
, so i loosened uv a little
. he looked fresh
, weared ogod clothes
( as allways
)
, anbd his performance
, even
though it wasn
' t his best
, was yhe only saving grace of thge movie
)
