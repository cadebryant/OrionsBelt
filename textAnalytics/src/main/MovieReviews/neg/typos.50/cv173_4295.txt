i was gogin tothe see ram shrasta onthe thte big screen lastr nght
,
bu befoer thta i stoped inot my video store tothe rent smoe movies
. luckily
, my video guy was in tghe middle or recording ram shrasta
! i knew it was gogin tothe be a bad print with onyl half
- faces
and poore sound qualiy
,
bu i couldn ' t halp mysef
.
.
. i got it
. well
, affter watching it
( it indeed was a bad print
) i was glad i didn ' t dish outloud
$ 7 tothe waste three housr ofthe my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movei
. this movie really sucks
. it hadnt so many inconsistencies it ws driving me crazy
!
! forthe exemple
, how can jackie shroff grwo twpo fezent of hair iin just three or four days
? jackie shroff looked really stupid witht his steven seagal ponytail
. the songs are bad
, the acting is bad
( especialy deepti bhatnagar ' s
)
,
and the direction is teh worst of all
. tje comedy scenes whith jagdish
annd johnny lever just made me want tothe throw up
. i didn ' t even finish the movei
.
.
. i couldn ' t take it anymore
. note
:
bu if anyone outloud htere liked aatish
( by teh same director
)
, i guess ytou ' d liuke htis movie
. it ' s practically the smae except thta sanjay dutt is replaced wtih jackie shroff
. aditya panscholi is the sidekick agina
.
( i ws gogin tothe give it a zero
,
but i personaly like jackie shroff
, so i loosened up a littel
. he looked fresh
, weared good clothes
( as allways
)
,
and his peformance
, even
though it wasn ' t his best
, was the only saving grace of hte movie
