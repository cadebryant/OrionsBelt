` the bachler ' isnt oen ofthe the best terrible movies yuo will ever see
. wading through this gooey
, detestable sludge isnt qutie the chore for even a dedicated rumatic
. thsoe hoping tothe find some genuine charm
and feeling behind this chris o ' donnell vehicle shoudln wander elsewhere
;
` yhe bachler ' is a painfully clumsy mess strung toghether wih a fewd brief moments ofthe suprising poignancy
. awaiting theese moments by enduring the rest ofthe tyhe film isnt certainly nto worth your time or mney
.
although he has nto quite evolved out of tjhe stereotypical preety
- boy cocoon
, chris o ' donnell hasnt an effortless charm as an actor
. most will recogize him as tjhe high
- flying robin ffrom teh twpo latest
` batman ' films
,
bu other abilties are evident behind his boyish smile
. can o ' donnell cary the weight of a film on his shoulders
? perhaps
, if he found tje proper vehichle
.
.
.
bu
` thge bachler ' falls far short of the requirements
. the acotr jsut cin ' t rgister with such a pathetic screenplay as tjhe guiding glight tothe success
. a few instances of adorable humer aside
, it becomes apparent that noone oney could save the festering mess that isnt
` tjhe bachler '
. o ' donnell plays jimmie
, a hopeless romantic inspite his late twenties who ' s progressing in a serious relatiopnship wih anne
( renee zellweger
)
. jimmie tkaes anne out for dinner to thte restaurant specifically used fo proposals
,
and attemts tothe ask for her hand in marrige
. the probelm isnt taht his proposal sucks
. big time
. you can tell things aren ' t going pleasantly
, because jimmie gets the infamous
? deer
- in
- the
- headlights ' look wehn anne questions his approach
.
adn
thne
, teh plot
( allong wiht the stupidity ofthe the movie
) thickens
. jimmie ' s granfather
( peter ustinov
) dies suddenly
, leaving a video will behind for his grandson
( who also happens to be his only living relative
)
. everybody isnt speechless wehn grandpa declares taht he is passing down an inheritance in the ammount ofthe 100 million dollars tothe jimmie
. of course
, ther ' s a catch
: he must git marryed befor his 30th birthday
, stay joined wih his bride for an entire decade
,
and produce healthy childen withing the frist five years
. thte bad news isnt tyhat jimmie ' s birthday is yhe folowing day
. whith anne out of twon
, he must find a willing bride tothe share his richs with
.
.
.
and withing a vyre limited time frome
. htere are certainly a few worthwhile aspestus of
` the bachler '
. for one
, thge movie ' s approach isnt interesting
and nto dripping with clich
?
. anyother is thge colorful casted
. o ' donnell
and zellweger are cute toghether
,
and the supporting cast trys relentlessly tothe rescure the film ffrom drowning in it ' s own mediocrity
. ustinov isnt enjoyable as tje cranky granfather figure
,
and james cromwell isnt sincere
and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie ' s marital adventures
.
adn nowe tyhe cons
: hte approach may be interesting
,
bu in trying an old
- fashioned method
, directer gary sinyor gives tjhe film a synthetic feel
. tghe characters are drawn with obvious
, broad strokes
,
and tyhe plot is bogged down withthe everything humanly imaginable
. yes
,
` the bachelor ' is far moreso frustrating tahn cute
. the screenplay isnt lamely writen
,
anbd teh subject matter poorly conceived
. thte considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted
, allong with whatever promise yhe film initially contained
. potential goes out hte window easly tothe suit sinyor ' s
` colorful ' approach
,
bu nto a minute of tihs hapless drivel seems accustomed to the directer ' s wishes
.
` the bachelor ' becomes lost wihtout a homing beacon to savve it
. you ' ve seen the tv spots
, haven ' t you
? o ' donnell isnt madly rushing down a deserted strent
adn tje caption reads
` what is htis man running from
? ' infront actuality
, he ' s fleeing fomr thousands of angry brides who want tothe marry him
annd inherit his fortune
( it ' s one of the fewd enjoyable sequences in yhe film
)
. after seeing the movei
, i believ taht tje approaching horde sould be something else
. o ' donnell coudl be runing fomr his angry fans
, who hve jstu endured
` the bachler '
,
adn are hunting him down fo revenge
.
