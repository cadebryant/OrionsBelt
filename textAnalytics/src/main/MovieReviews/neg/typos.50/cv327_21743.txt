` tyhe bachelor
' is one ofthe tyhe best terrable movies ytou will ever see
. wading through this gooey
, detestable sludge is qtuie tje chore forthe even a dedicated romantic
. those hoping to fidn some genuine charm anbd feeling behind tihs chris o
' donnell vehicule shoud w
ander elsewhere
;
` thge bachelor
' isnt a painfully clumsy mess strung toghether with a faw brief moments of surprising poignancy
. awaiting theese moments by enduring the rest of tyhe film is certainly not worth your time or money
.
al
thought he has nto qutie evolved outloud ofthe the stereotypical preety
- boy cocoon
, chris o
' donnell hasnt an effortless charm as an actor
. most will recognize him as the high
- flying robin ffrom the twpo latest
` batman
' films
, bu other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile
. can o
' donnell carry teh weight of a film onthe his shoulders
? perhaps
, if he found the propper vehicle
.
.
.
but
` the bachler
' falls far short ofthe tjhe requirements
. the acotr jstu cant
' t rgister wih such a pathetic screenplay as hte guiding light to sucess
. a few instances ofthe adorable humor asside
, it becomes apparen that no oney coudl save tghe festering mess that isnt
` yhe bachler
'
. o
' donnell plays jimmie
, a hopeless rumatic in his lite twenties who
' s progressing in a sereous relatiopnship wtih anne
( renee zellweger
)
. jimmie takes anne out for dinner to hte restaurant specifically utilisied for proposals
, anbd attempts tothe ask for her h
and in marrige
. the problem is that his proposal sucks
. big tyme
. you can tell things aren
' t going pleasantly
, because jimmie gets tyhe infamous
? deer
- inaddition
- hte
- headlights
' look when anne questions his aproach
.
and
then
, thge plot
( allong with the stupidity of tghe movie
) thickens
. jimmie
' s granfather
( peter ustinov
) dies suddenly
, leaving a video iwll behind for his gr
andson
( who aslo happens tothe be his onyl living realtive
)
. everybody is speechless when gr
andpa declares thyat he isnt passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 milion dollars to jimmie
. ofthe course
, there
' s a catch
: he must git married befor his 30th birthday
, stay joined wiht his bride for an entire decade
,
and produce healthy childrens within the first five yeras
. thge bad news isnt that jimmie
' s birthday is teh follwoing day
. with anne out ofthe twon
, he must fidn a willing bride to share his richs whith
.
.
. anbd withing a very limited timne frame
. there are certainly a few worthwhile spects ofthe
` the bachelor
'
. for noe
, the movei
' s aproach is intresting
and not dripping with clich
?
. anohter is the colorful casted
. o
' donnell
and zellweger are cute toghether
,
and tghe supporting cast trys relentlessly to rescue tyhe film fomr drowning infront it
' s own mediocrity
. ustinov is enjoyable as teh cranky gr
andfather figure
, anbd james cromwell isnt sincere anbd effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie
' s marital adventures
.
and nowe hte cons
: the aproach may be interesting
, bu inspite trying an old
- fashioned method
, director gary sinyor gives tjhe film a synthetic feel
. the charactors are drawed witht obvious
, broad strokes
, anbd tjhe plot isnt bogged down wiht everyting humanly imaginable
. yes
,
` the bachelor
' isnt far more frustrating than cute
. the screenplay isnt lamely wroten
, anbd the subject matter poorly conceived
. tjhe considerable charm of the two leads is
thoughtlessly wasted
, along witht whatever promise tyhe film initially contained
. potential goes out tghe window early to suit sinyor
' s
` colorful
' approach
,
but not a minute ofthe this hapless drivel seems accustomed tothe tjhe directer
' s wishes
.
` thge bachelor
' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it
. ytou
' ve seen tyhe tv spots
, haven
' t ytou
? o
' donnell isnt madly rushing down a deserted street
and tjhe captin reads
` whta isnt this man running fomr
?
' in actuality
, he
' s fleeing from thous
ands ofthe angry brides who wanna to marry him
and inherit his fortune
( it
' s one of the fewd enjoyable sequences in tjhe film
)
. aftter seeing thge movie
, i believe that the approaching horde coudl be something alse
. o
' donnell could be running fomr his angry fans
, who hve jsut endured
` the bachler
'
, anbd are hunting him down for revenge
.
