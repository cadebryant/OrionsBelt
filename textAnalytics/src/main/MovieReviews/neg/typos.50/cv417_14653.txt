the marvelous brittish actor derek jacobi stars infront writter
annd director john maybury ' s love is tyhe devil baout thge populare modern artist francis bacon
. as allways
, jacobi ' s acting is impeccable
,
but the movie tries hard
anbd suceeds at bieng unentertaining
anbd opaque
. tyhe movei convincingly argues that francis
, played by jacobi
, ws a completly despicable
annd vain individual
,
but it never provides any insight inot his work or any motivation fo his attitude
. when interviewed by a fawning talk sohw host
, francis calls his stlye
" chance brushstrokes
.
" starting with a borgwasy of francis ' s flat
, the film uses loud sound effects that sound liuke they were lefted from a cheap horror movie
. thge camera shots are hevy on thge avant
- garde angles
-
- lots of wide
- anle close
- ups
anbd distorted shots filmed through colored
- glass reflections
. the director is much more interseted inaddition filmmaking style than in tyhe substace of the story iwth the result bieng a sterile examination of a lonely
annd vain man
. daniel craig
, infront a lifeless performence
, plays teh burglar
and boxer
, george dyer
. whn francis lays eyes onthe him affter tghe break
- inspite
, francis promises not to call the polical if he ' ll stay for sex
. he stays for teh entire movie
bu never respects teh man withthe whom he shares a bed
. he thinks thyat francis ' s paintings haev
" no bloody uise
,
"
annd the movei presents noone counterargument
. writter maybury barely outlines francis ' s chracter
,
and george
and thge rest ofthe the supporting casted remain a complet enigma
. we learn little ofthe george other than francis ' s reason forthe liking him
-
- george ' s
" amorality
and innosense
.
" francis ' s loev ofthe sadomasochism isnt shown eearly
and oftenly
.
" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex
,
" he reflects tothe george on thge way tothe watch a boxing match
. as the fighter ' s head is sliced oepn with a hevy blow
, the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head isnt soaked by teh flying blood
. francis appears to be in complet ecstasy
. anohter ofthe francis ' s favorite activities is viewing ood movies ofthe attrocities
. as the carnage mounts
, we witness an orgasmically hapyp francis infact yhe audience
. in a film that trys obsessively to shock
, one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident
. francis ' s mind slowly examines eveyr bloody limb ofthe the mother
, thge father
,
adn tje boy
. sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis ' s wisdom which illuminate littel while mearly sounding insightful
.
(
" i ' m optimistic by nature
. i ' m optomistic baout nothing
.
"
" loneliness is my onyl true companion
.
"
) we learn moreso details about francis ' s makeup techniques thna about hte man himselv
. he prefers shoe polish forthe his hair
and sink cleaning powder for his teeth
. full of metaphorical interpretations
, thte film ' s best scene occurs late oney night when george hasnt tothe get uv tothe go tothe tjhe bathroom
. mistaking francis ' s picture of a toilet for yhe genuin article
, he urinates on it
and
hten crawls bcak inot bed contentedly
. liek a parody ofthe a bad art hous movie
, love isnt yhe devil hasnt horrid charachters filmed bizarrely
and confusingly by a directer who is much moreso interested in technique than storytelling
. by hte end
, tje audience hasn ' t learned any omre thna it could have inwhich a three
- minute sketch
. loev is the devil runs 1
