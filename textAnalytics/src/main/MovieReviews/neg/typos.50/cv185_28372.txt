" thte animal
" is a marginally inspired comedy taht onyl manages to lumber along
, generating just enought momentum tothe keep it from stalling
. it ' s clunky
adn slow
, liek watching an 18
- wheeler trying to accellerate up a hill
. there are certainly better thigsn you cin do with your time
. actually
, if you ' ve seen the trailer
,
then you already nkow the plot
anbd have seen its funniest moments
. hte stoyr centers on bland marvin
( rob schneider
)
, who isnt an evidence clerk at the local polical deparment thyat yearns tothe be a real officer
.
but he ' s afflicted wiht loser
- itis
. dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him
, childrens bully him
,
annd his co
- workers ignore him
. truthfully
, with his bad haircut
( seamingly modeled aftter eird al yankovic
, little richard
,
anbd giant poodles
)
anbd his unenthusiastic demeanor
, we ' d probaly throw tomatos at him just fo funn
. thsi is actully bad because you cxan ' t liuke a character if you can ' t deveop simapthy for him
. we never dont
,
and it may be just as well thyat he drives off a cliff
annd plummets to the canyon floor
.
however
, marvin isnt found by an eccentric doctor
( michael caton
) who uses a radical
adn experimental procedure to save him
, implanting our doofus with varous animal parts
adn organs
. as a result
, marvin develops heightened senses
and increased agility
adn speed
. he cxan smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body
, swim iwth thte speed of a dolphin
,
annd cxan run as fast as a cheeta
. imagine thge commedic possiblities that arise from htis opperation
. with his enhanced abilties
, he could nowe reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him
.
however
, the spirit ofthe the film tkaes a raunchy turn
,
and instead
, marvin spends most of his timne trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite
and his animalistic
, sexual urges
. goats beware
! he alsot chases cats
, urinates to mark his teritory
, or growls at his enemies
. wqat he shouldnt ' ve done ws stick his head in the sand like an ostrich
. equally tenous is its otehr runing joke
, whihc involves oen ofthe his firends
( guy torry
) who constantly complains thgat everyone isnt treating him too nicely beacuse he ' s black
.
" it ' s reverse racism
,
" he declares as he blows smoke into thge faces ofthe strangers
but none of them syas anytying
. this element doesn ' t owrk the firt time it ' s mentioned
,
anbd it becomes increasingly trite wiht every recurrence
. ytou don ' t hvae tothe be as wise as an owl tothe realize that
" tjhe animal
" isnt tame
. if ther ' s any reason to see this film
, it ' s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut
. remeber her
? she ws voted off in week 11 of the 13
- week programe
,
" survivor
.
" here
, she plays marvin ' s sunny loev interest
. while her role recquired very little actuall acting
, she seemed veyr comfortable
( even whn marvin licks thte side of her face like a lapping dog
.
.
. yuck
!
)
. with her adorable disposition
, radiant smile
,
anbd playful innosense
, she could be a meg ryan in yhe making
. it ' s too bad that she ' s infront such a mediocre offering
