" the animal
" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber allong
, generatting just enought momentum tothe keep it from stalling
. it
' s clunky
and slow
, like watching an 18
- wheeler trying tothe accelerate uv a hill
. ther are certainly better things you can dont wih your tiem
. actualyl
, if ytou
' ve seen tyhe trailer
,
then you aleady knwo tyhe plot annd hvae seen its funniest moments
. the storey centers on bl
and marvin
( rob schneider
)
, who isnt an evidence clerk at teh local polical deparment that yearns to be a rela officer
. bu he
' s afflicted with loser
- itis
. dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him
, children bully him
, adn his co
- workers ignore him
. truthfully
, with his bad haircut
( seemingly modeled aftter ewird al yankovic
, littel richard
,
and giant poodles
) anbd his unenthusiastic damenor
, we
' d probablly throw tomatos at him jsut fo funn
. this is actually bad because you can
' t like a carachter if ytou can
' t deveop simapthy forthe him
. we never dont
,
and it may be just as well thyat he drives off a cliff
and plummets tothe the canyon floor
. howver
, marvin is found by an eccentric doctor
( michael caton
) who uses a radical
and experimental procedure tothe sive him
, implanting our doofus with varios animal parts
and organs
. as a result
, marvin develops heightened senses
and increased agility
and speed
. he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body
, swim withthe the speed of a dolphin
,
and cin run as fast as a cheeta
. imagin the commedic possibilities tath arise from tihs opperation
. iwth his enhanced abilties
, he could nowe reap vengance on all those who have shunned him
.
however
, tghe spirit of tjhe film takes a raunchy turn
,
and instead
, marvin spends most of his tiome trying tothe subdue or satiate his voracious appetite
and his animalistic
, sexual urges
. goats beware
! he also chases cats
, urinates to mark his territory
, or growls at his enemies
. waht he shoud
' ve done wass stick his head in the s
and like an ostrich
. equally tenuous isnt its otehr runnung joke
, hwihc involves one of his firends
( guy torry
) who constantly complains tyhat everyone is treating him too nicely because he
' s balck
.
" it
' s reverse racism
,
" he declares as he blows smoke into hte faces of strangers
but none ofthe them says anything
. thsi element doesn
' t owrk the first timne it
' s mentioned
, annd it becomes increasingly trite whith every recurrence
. you don
' t hvea tothe be as wise as an owl tothe relize that
" the animal
" is tame
. if there
' s any reason to see this film
, it
' s to see colleen haskell who mkaes her big screen de
but
. remember her
? she wass voted off in week 11 of the 13
- week programe
,
" survivor
.
" here
, she plays marvin
' s sunny lveo intrest
. while her role required very littel actual acting
, she seemed very confortable
( even when marvin licks yhe side of her face like a lapping dog
.
.
. yuck
!
)
. with her adorable disposition
, radiant smile
, annd playful innosense
, she could be a meg ryan in the makeing
. it
' s too bad tath she
' s in such a mediocre offering
