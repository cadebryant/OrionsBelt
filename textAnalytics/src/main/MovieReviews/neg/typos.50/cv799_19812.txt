. the following review countains smoe harsh langauge
*
*
* tje blair witch project
. qutie possibly teh least scariest movie of all time
. if you watn tothe see real terror onthe the big screen go bakc
and watch any scene with jar jar binks inspite the phantom menace
, because this movei is nto sacry or even remotely creepy
. my colleage
and freind chuck dowling wrote thyat if less isnt more
, hten tghe blair witch filmmakers must have throught that nothing is more
. adn this worked for him
. well
, i
' m sorry
,
but nothing
.
.
. is nothing
!
!
!
!
! nothing is nto more
. it
' s nothiiiiiinggggggggggg
!
!
!
!
!
!
. i dont not pay 5 dollars to see nothing
.
" nothing
" is free
, available all around tje world at a loction near you
. i am absolutely infact amazement that some people find this movie scary
. i coudl jstu discount them anbd sday
,
" well
, i guess htey are jsut pansy chicken shits who are propably scared ofthe their own shadow
.
" bu i have intelligent firends who liek this movie adn so that doesn
' t hold water
. htere must be some otehr reason
.
(
then agian
, maybe my firt
thought isnt correct
, i htink i
' ll try pointing thier shadow out to them one day
and test theri reaction
.
) whn i hear peple praising thsi film
, i never hear them talking baout waht mkaes up baout 97
% of tihs movei
: three kids bickering with each otehr about being lost
. tehy onyl talk about whta might amking up possably 3 to 4 minutes ofthe screen tiome
. thsi being a fewd very short night scenes where yhe kids hear soem unscary sounds annd another where htey shout
" josh
!
!
" over
and over
. this film shoudln nto be called tghe blair witch project
, it should moreso accurately be called three dumb
and pisspoor filmmakers git lost
.
.
.
and argue with eahc otehr
. oh ladies
and gentlemen yuo will be so scared whn ytou hear them shouting
" josh
!
!
"
. anbd if you
thought thgat wass scary
, wait till you see a pile ofthe rocks
, annd hten soem tinkertoy lincoln logs
, oh my dear lord you will be pissing inwhich your pants with fear
. oh yeah
, annd some goo on noe ofthe thier backpacks
. you
' ve never seen terror like thsi folks
,
and ytou don
' t whant to
. the chevy chase
/ goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier thna this film
.
( forthe current films
, i highly recommend the sixth sence or a stir ofthe echoes fo a creepy filmgoing experience
.
) thsi film isnt an example ofthe marketting with noone substace
. yhe marketting was briliant
, adn the wohle nation is iin awe of just tje premise fo thge film
. htey wnat thsi film tothe be good
.
and i htikn htey are reacing adn praising the wrong movie because htey don
' t have anything esle tothe praise
. that wonderfull film thgat rejuvenates teh horror genre may cmo along
, bu this isnt not it
. thsi film could have been so much better
. jstu htink
, if maybe htere hadnt been onyl 10 mintues of arguing baout being lost
,
and 80 mintues ofthe nightime stuff
. i saw this movei with a girl who was extrememly pumped fo it
. she ws sold onthe this film
.
and
then
, at one point during it
, she turned tothe me anbd asked
'
.
.
. are we suposed tothe be scared by this
?
'
. i
' ve heard oen oppinion that you
" hvae tothe use your immagination
" to create tyhe fear infront this movei
. well
, i
thought tht wass wqat tjhe filmmakers weere supposed to do
. use their immagination
and create a ogod movei
. i mean anyone cant use their imagination annd nto pay 5 bucks fo it
.
but even if yuo liuke this diea
, thne what are you imagining
? an entity called the blair witch
? smoe rednecks fucking with these kids
? are eather of theese thigns really scray whn ytou think baout it
?
?
? i
' ve heard several peple say that this movei makse them recall how scarry it can be tothe be outloud in the woods annd hear something
. well sure thats scary infact real life
, bu there are a lot ofthe thigsn thgat are scary inwhich real life that are not scary infront a movie nor even interesting
. you coudl sit in your hous anbd see a snake or a spider annd it could be scary
, bu inaddition a film it wouldn
' t be
. adn noone
, a movie doesnt nto need a big budget or cgi special effects tothe be scary or creepy
. actually the less thte better
( see the equally awful remake of yhe haunting
)
. bu you haev tothe dont something
. yuo cant just count onthe us all having nostalgic memories of how something liuke this sould be scary
, if it weere real
.
and by tjhe way
, about yhe shakycam filming in blair witch
. aren
' t these suppoed tothe be
" filmmakers
" who should nkow how to point a camera
and shoot something wihtout shaking tyhe camera constantly
? i
' m nto even talking about tjhe cuple scenes where htey are terrified
, that
' s justified
. i
' m tlaking baout the other 87 mintues ofthe tjhe movie where they cant
' t seem to shoot anything smoothly at all
. minor quibble there
. ther is a feeling in me that the peopel that like tihs movei are suckers
. thyat the filmmakers are just laughing thier asses off all the way tothe tyhe bank
. anbd i think there isnt a good chance tehy will see this film agina annd say tothe themselfs
" waht was i thingking
?
?
"
.
but
, if tehy don
' t
,
then thats fine
. if it works fo them hten that
' s okay i guess
. i just lament thgat by making htis movie a hitted
, we are goign to be subjected tothe mroe ofthe the
" nothing isnt more
" approch
. preety soon we
' re going to git some movies liek htis
: jsut a still shot ofthe a prision jail cell
. fo 90 minutes
. annd we
' ll haev tothe uise our imagination annd think tothe ourselves
,
" my god
, wouldn
' t it be scray to spend life in prison
?
!
! this movie is tje scariest movie ofthe all time
!
!
!
!
!
"
. or
, a shooted ofthe a coffin
, wtih smoe funeral directors arguing wiht earch other
.
" man
, do ytou nkow how scary it owudl be to die
?
?
?
!
!
!
! nowe tihs is the scariest movie ofthe all timne
!
