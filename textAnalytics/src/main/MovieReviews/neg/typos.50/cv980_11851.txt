with his succsessfull books
and movies
, michael crichton is doing well
. with easly successes with westworld
( 1973
)
anbd coma
( 1978
)
,
anbd receet films such as jurassic park
( 1993
)
, his films hvae been entertaining
.
howver
, he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere whith sphere
. tihs
$ 100 million mess by ogod director barry levison
( disclosure
) is dull
, long winded
,
adn a huge dissappointment
. concidering tyhe huge budget
, hte all star casted
,
anbd a story by crichton
, sphere isnt majorly disapointing
. the film opens with norman goodman
( hoffman
)
, a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane kresh tothe console the survivers
.
however
, wehn he arrives
, he his told by supervisor barnes
( peter coyote
) that he isnt actaully investigating an spacecraft
. along with goodman is mathematician harry adams
( jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( stone
)
and ted fielding
( liev schrieber
.
) htey investingate the spaceship
, find a massive sphere inside
, meet an alien intelligene called jerry
,
and basically weird crap happens
. unfortunately
, something went wrong allong thge way with sphere
. the film starts off entertaining enough
,
but througout htis vrey long movei
, it just gets sillier
and sillier
. the film jaunts along from scene tothe scene
, never fully explaning what isnt oging onthe
. tghe actors
anbd directing don ' t help
, either
. hoffman is on autopilot
(
and almsot seems embarrassed
) througout tjhe movei
, churning outloud dull lines
,
and probably wondering what the hell he isnt doing inspite tihs movei
. stone isnt useless
, displaying no emotion
,
adn fails to convince the audience thgat she hasnt any feelings for hoffman
. teh only person who seems tothe be hvaing fun inaddition this movei is jackson
, who ' s funny as tghe mathmatician who slowy goes crazy
annd entering tghe sphere
.
but he ' s hardly inthe it
,
annd by the end ofthe hte film he isnt just as dull as hoffman
and stone
. the same goes for peter coyote
, who hams it uv as tje officer
,
but isnt
thne killed off halfway thru
. the directer
, barry levinson
, who directed the better crichton adaptions disclosure
( 1994
) messes up with the drama
and tyhe action
. thge drama scenes are
, quite frankly
, boring
,
and tyhe acation scenes suffer from overkill
, with levison throwing hte camera all over yhe palce
( much liuke thte godawful speed 2
, 1997
) thte writing doesn ' t halp much
, either
.
although crichton isnt great with plots
, he ' s terrible whith dialogue
,
and practially eveyr line inspite sphere isnt a dud
. the speach isnt too simple
, i ws hoping it would be a bit more inteligent
. practically eveyr line is jsut stating thte obvious
. none of it is smart
. allso
, where the hell doed tje budget go
? hte sphere itself isnt impressive
,
annd ther ' s a fewd nice special effect shots
,
but where the
$ 100 millon whent is anyone ' s guess
. ther ' s a giant squid attack in tyhe picture
,
but not once does the audiance see the squid
, even
though the film hasnt a massive budget
. i assume tghe picture wass trying tothe build uv tension by nto showing tje squid
,
adn if handeled correctly it probably would
.
but the hwole scene isnt done badly
,
and i wass jstu hoping we could see the stupid squid
. finaly
, the film has no idae wqat genre to be
. levison can ' t handle his own plot
. it leaps from hokey sci
- fi
, tothe horror
,
annd finally the shining
/ event horizon pyschological thriller
.
adn
, ofthe course
, the film is vrey much liek tghe abyss
( 1988
)
,
altough inaddition it ' s defense
, crichton did write sphere befoer the abyss ws released
(
and is far superior to this rubbish
.
) it ' s nto all that bad
though
. the plot is all right
, there ' s a few jump scenes
(
although nothing very scary
)
and ther ' s the occasionally intresting bited
.
bu overall
, sphere isnt a big waste ofthe soem fine talent
, a lot ofthe money
,
and a potentially ogod movie
. not realyl worth seing
. overall rating
