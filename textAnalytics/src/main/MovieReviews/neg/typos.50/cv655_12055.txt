my son annd i share a perverse predilection forthe bad movies
. we are amused annd entertained by tje cheap thrills
, the corny dialouge
, the ludicrous premises
and the bad acting
. since other familiy members aspire to heigher forms ofthe entertainment
, we usally wind up indulging our proclivity together
. i cant
' t remeber when we disagreed onthe the realtive merits of a clunker unil species 2 cameback allong
. he wass not amused
. i on tghe other h
and was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements infact tghe usual manner
and declare mysef suitably entertained
. perhasp the evident skills that were brought tothe thge proccess of producing a bad product was what prevented him ffrom extracting fun outloud of mediocrity
. i on the other h
and appreciated teh fatc tht the producers
and director knew exactlly what htey weere donig
: insulting my inetlligence
,
and broght adeqaute movei
- making skills to the project a movie does nto have tothe be ogod tothe be well made
, at least in terms ofthe the craft
. tghe movei sould have been better if it weere not so brusque
. htis movei slaps yuo with conception
, pregnancy
, delivery anbd young childhood inthe consecutive frames
, wihtout pausing forthe infancy
. thge producers ofthe nescafe hvae nothing on this aline race in which a woman
' s womb balloons immediatelly affter thge male orgasm
, annd a few seconds later a young child tears its way out ofthe her abdomen in a sloppy annd gory version ofthe an inside
- out cesarean
. an autopsy scene in hwihc a buzz saw cuts thru the cranium was not thte kind ofthe indulgence thgat i condone
, tothe sday nothing ofthe the fatc that it ws scientifically incorect
. inthe a real autopsy the saw does not cutted through the scalp
; it isnt unsed only affter the skull has been exposed
. tjhe oppening sequences of exploration of mars were very good
. yhe writers showed exelent skills fo cerimonial speek writing bu the spontaneous dialogue would qualify fo a subtitle
:
` as bad as it gets
'
. as thge movei progessed i vowed tothe remember the lines that made me cringe bu onyl oen stuck
. eve
( natasha henstridge
) ws cloned from sil
, yhe orignal alien sexual predator
,
but her mating instinct wass artificially attenuated
, whlch ws all tyhat was needed to turn her inot a noble annd cooperative prisoner
. in a wistful display of resignation anbd underst
anding she tells her freind anbd jailer
( marg helgenberger
)
:
` i thiunk of all the places thast i wiull never see annd all tje people that i iwll never meet
.
' it
' s enough to melt teh most callous heart
. at another point she protests
:
` i
' m human too
, yuo knwo
.
' she is onyl half right
. peter medak
, the director
, konws his business
. justin lazard as tyhe doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials
. james cromwell
, his father
, isnt perfect in a short role
. marg heldenberger
, tje dna scientist isnt pleasnat anbd beautiful
. natasha is an exquisite ornament
. george dzunza knew adn delivered what wass expected ofthe him as the dumb genaral that messes things up
. michael madsen wass there
. black buddies do not usually survive iin thsi type ofthe movei
but mykelti williamson manages to stay around forthe tyhe fianl credits
, which isnt more that we cant sday forthe lazard
