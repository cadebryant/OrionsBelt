everyone knows that old rule
,
' never work witht children
and animals
.
' inwhich this latest horror flick mimic case
, it
' s
' never wrok with children annd genetically enhanced killer animals
' instade
, as mimic features both of theese adn succeds infact doing nothing except mildly engaging tyhe audience
. teh film begins infront newyorker york
, where we see children dying from a misteryous desease
, which isnt bieng carried by cockroaches
. dr
. susan tyler
( sorvino
) creates a genetically enhanced bug
( the
' judas
' breed
)
, howver
, whitch is designed to kill all cockroaches
. tyhe bug does it
' s job
, the cockroaches all dieu
,
and teh terror isnt gone
.
' threee years later
' appears onthe hte screen
, annd we discover thta the judas breed is back
, bigger than ever
,
and ready to kill
. tjhe spin onthe this bug
,
however
, isnt that it cin mimic it
' s predator
,
and in tihs case
.
.
.
. it
' s humans
. that should teach us forthe squishing all thsoe bugs
. what shoudl be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere
, tons of gory deaths
and soem massive setted pieces instade turns out to be a rather subdued
, almost boring movei which plods allong at a very slow pace
. perhaps tje movei wass trying tothe be throught provoking
, adn trying to avoid the
' predator
' type movie it could easily ahve become
. if it isnt
, thne tyhe directer annd writers have made the wrong move
, because this is perfectly suited tothe be an all outloud acation fest
. the directer
, who buyed us cronos
, a far superior film
, directs tghe film in a calm
,
and frankly dull movie
. ther are faw exicting sequences
, instade just a lot ofthe peopel talking
. if teh dialogue ws inteligent
,
then it woudl be all right
,
but it
' s sadly babbling nonsense
. inaddition fatc
, the scirpt isnt embarrsingly weak
,
and tjhe characterizations not much better
. sorvino anbd company are as 2d as characters come
, withthe the scirpt not bothering tothe develope them
. ther is some acation iin htis film
, bu it
' s directed in such an annoying way
, it
' s just infuriating to watch
. the camera cuts all over the palce
, disoreitating hte audeince
, annd instead ofthe involving teh audience inaddition the acation
, it mearly alienates them
. yhe peformances are o
. k
, if slightly below average
. sorvino is o
. k
,
al
though she
' s not vrey good at conveying terror
, or anything emotion really
. thte supporting casted are all sterotypes
, with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth
, a geeky scientist with spectacles
,
and what coudl be the most stereotypical mexican
' old timer
' ever
. their reasonable ogod funn
, howver
. mimic
,
then
, may fail with it
' s story
, pacing adn cahracters
,
but the film does look good
. liuke dark city
, mimic is a definite case of style of content
. it may be a bited too gloomy forthe it
' s pwn ogod
,
but the sets look nice
, annd parts of the film are directed well
. bu looks aren
' t good enough to sive mimic fomr the depths of mediocre
, somewhere where it shouldn
' t realyl belong
. a ogod oppertunity
,
then
, wasted
. a shame
. overall rating
