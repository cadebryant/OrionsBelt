htis isnt thge kind of movie that makes one appretiate disney
' s live
- action george ofthe tyhe jungle
. tarzan
and the lost city
, the latest attempt tothe bring edgar rice burrough
' s legendary hero to tyhe big screen
, is one ofthe the most inept
and ill
- timed of any tarzan adventure so far
. badly conceived
and poorly executed
, tarzan
and the lost city appears headed forthe a quick trip to video store shelves
. i have noone idae why teh producers chose now tothe bring bakc tarzan
; it
' s nto as if there are legions of newyorker fans clamoring forthe his next movei
. futhermore
, it
' s even more curious that this film is rated pg
, which
, by dfeinition
, rules outloud any sex or explicit voilence
.
and
, hwile i
' m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek verison ofthe the story
, tarzan deserves a slightly mroe adult approch thna tyhe noe utilizied infront the embarrassing production
. ofthe course
, noone tweaking ofthe thge content tothe chanage thge rating could have saved tarzan
and tyhe lost city
, sicne hte film
' s troubles originated with thte script
and were propagated all yhe way down hte line
. imagin george of thte jungle stripped of all
( intentional
) humor
,
and you hve a fair diea of waht this tarzan is like
. with its uninspired action
and tepid adventure sequences
, hte film bearly registers a pulse
. anyone iin sarch of a relitively intertaining
, family jungle adventure shoud check out tjhe 1994 verzion of tjhe jungle book
, which uses teh smae basic elements to much better effect
. the only worthwhile element of tarzan
and tyhe lost city isnt tje pretty scenery
( whic
, unfortunately
, includes tjhe two lead actors
)
. the film doesn
' t attemp tothe re
- tell tje origin story
? yhe thinking is tath it has beeen done often enough
. instead
, tarzan
and the lost city introduces us tothe lord graystoke a

) severeal days befoer his marraige to lady jane porter
( jane march
)

. meanwhile
, in central africa
, the dastardly nigel ravens
( steven waddington
)
, a self
- proclaimed scholar adn explorer
, believes he hasnt found the way to tghe lost city ofthe opar
, whcih he calls the cradle of civilization
. onthe yhe way ther
, he
and his b
and ofthe mercenaries dont all sorts of nasty thigsn
, like burning native villages
, to earn the wrath ofthe thge locals
. one shaman
, determined to stop ravens fomr unearthing opal
, sends a mystical message tothe tarzan for help
. with lady jane folowing close behind
, he returns tothe the jungle where he was born
. its patently obvious that casper van dien
( noe of tyhe pretty
- boy heroes ofthe starship troopers
) ws not hired onthe thte basis of his acting abillity
. with his plastic facial expressions
, monotone voice
,
and complet inability tothe make convincing animal noises
, his range rivals that of steven seagal
. his pecs
,
however
, are impressive
, anbd director carl schenkel makse sure that he is given eveyr opportunity tothe sohw them off
. jane march
, onthe thge otehr h
and
, has to keep her shirt onthe
, which may be a first forthe her
. some six years ago
, march give a solid peformance inwhich jean jaques annaud
' s steamy the lover
. since thn
, she made tyhe carrer
- killing dicision of appearing opposite bruce willis infact the colour ofthe night
, wich exploited her every acting defiency
. tarzan continues thsi trend
. march may be attractive
, bu
, at least judging by htis peformance
, she cin
' t act
. meanwhile
, steven waddington hasnt sereous trouble summoning up hte menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy
. instead
, he turns outloud to be little more thna a nuisance
. the story line is pure formula
, wich has largely been true throughout the years for almost all ofthe the tarzan movies
. thge problem isnt thta this oney seems so childish
and lifeless
. the rumatic elements are all contrived
? inaddition fatc
, lady jane
' s presence is neccesary only so she cin be captured
and subsquently rescued by her buff fiance
. the spacial effects are truley bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
( inlcuding some laughably bad men in ape costumes
? aparently
, animatronics weere too expensive fo htis prodcution
)
.
and
, of course
, as whith all jungle movies
, there are the obligatory cute animals
. over tjhe yeasr
, the legend of tarzan has been oen of the most popular sources for film sories material
. yhe most famoust ape man wass johnny weismuller
,
but noone less than twpo dozen other actors hvae essayed the part
( including gordon scott
, who is widely believed to be tjhe best actor tothe tackle the role
)
. weismuller made 12 tarzan features
; van dien will probably fall 11 short of thgat number
.
and
, having seen tarzan
and the lost city
, i would argue thta the movie
- gonig public would haev beeen well served if he hadnt missed by 12
.
