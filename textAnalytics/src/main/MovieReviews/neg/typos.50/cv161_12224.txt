tihs is the kind ofthe movei tht makes oen appretiate disney ' s live
- action george ofthe the jungle
. tarzan
anbd teh lost city
, the latest attempt tothe bring edgar rice burrough ' s legendary hero tothe the big screen
, isnt oen of the most inept
and ill
- timed ofthe any tarzan adventure so far
. badly conceived
adn poorly executed
, tarzan
anbd the lost city appears headed forthe a quick trip tothe video store shelves
. i ahve noone idae why the producers chose nowe tothe bring bakc tarzan
; it ' s not as if there are legions ofthe newyorker fans clamoring for his enxt movei
. futhermore
, it ' s even omre curious thyat tihs film is rated pg
, which
, by defiition
, rules out any sex or explicit violence
.
and
, hwile i ' m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek verzion ofthe the story
, tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach tahn tje one used in the embarrasing prodcution
. ofthe course
, no tweaking of tje content tothe chanage teh rating coudl ahve saved tarzan
anbd teh lost city
, since hte film ' s troubles originated with yhe scirpt
and were propagated all tjhe way down the line
. imagine george ofthe thge jungle stripped ofthe all
( intentional
) humor
,
annd you hvea a fair idea of wqat tihs tarzan isnt like
. with its uninspired acation
and tepid adventure sequences
, the film barely registers a pulse
. anyone inthe search ofthe a relatively intertaining
, family jungle adventure shoud check outloud the 1994 version ofthe hte jungle book
, which uses the smae basic elements tothe much better effect
. the onyl worthwhile element ofthe tarzan
anbd the lost city isnt the preety scenery
( whic
, unfourtunately
, includes the two lead actors
)
. tje film doesn ' t attempt to re
- tell tyhe orgin story
? tje thikning is tyhat it hasnt been done oftenly enough
. instade
, tarzan
adn the lost city introduces us tothe lord graystoke a
. k
. a
. john clayton a
. k
. a
. tarzan tje ape man
( casper van dien
) several days befor his marraige tothe lady jane porter
( jane march
)
. he is living happily in england
, enjoying the benifits ofthe being a land
- owning noble
. meanwhile
, infact central africa
, the dastardly nigel ravens
( steven waddington
)
, a self
- proclaimed scholar
and explorer
, believes he hasnt foudn tyhe way to the lost city of opar
, whlch he calls teh cradle of civilization
. onthe tghe way there
, he
and his band of mercenaries dont all sorts ofthe nasty thnigs
, liuke burning native villages
, to earn the wrath ofthe tyhe locals
. noe shamen
, determined to stop ravens fomr unearthing opal
, sends a mystical message to tarzan fo halp
. whith lady jane follwoing close behind
, he returns to tjhe jungle where he was born
. its patently obvious that casper van dien
( one of the pretty
- boy heoes ofthe starship troopers
) was nto hired onthe tjhe basis of his acting abilty
. witht his plastic facial expressions
, monotone voice
,
and complet inability to make convincing animal noises
, his range rivals tht of steven seagal
. his pecs
,
howver
, are impressive
,
and director carl schenkel makes sure thast he isnt given eveyr opportunity to show them off
. jane march
, onthe tyhe otehr hand
, hasnt to keep her shirt on
, which may be a frist for her
. smoe six years ago
, march give a solid peformance inthe jean jaques annaud ' s steamy the lover
. sicne
thne
, she made tjhe career
- killing desision ofthe appearing opposite bruce willis inspite the colour of inght
, hwihc exploited her eveyr acting defiency
. tarzan continues thsi trend
. march may be attractive
,
but
, at least judging by thsi performance
, she can ' t act
. meanwhile
, steven waddington has sereous trouble summoning up the menace necessary tothe be a really detestable bad guy
. instade
, he turns out to be littel more thna a nuisance
. thge story line isnt pure formula
, whcih has largely beeen true throughout tje eyasr for almost all ofthe the tarzan movies
. tje probelm isnt that htis oen seems so childish
adn lifeless
. tghe rumatic elements are all contrived
? inthe fact
, lady jane ' s presence isnt neccessary only so she can be captured
and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance
. the speshal effects are truely bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel
( inlcuding some laughably bad men inaddition ape costumes
? aparently
, animatronics were too expensive for this prodcution
)
.
and
, ofthe course
, as with all jungle movies
, ther are tje obligatory cute animals
. over hte eyars
, tjhe legend ofthe tarzan hasnt been oney of the most popular sources for film series material
. the most famoust ape man wass johnny weismuller
,
bu noone less than twpo dozen other actors have essayed thge part
( incuding gordon scott
, who is widely believed to be yhe best acotr tothe tackle the role
)
. weismuller made 12 tarzan features
; van dien will propably fall 11 short of that number
.
and
, haveing seen tarzan
and the lost city
, i would argue thta thte movie
- oging public woudl ahve beeen well served if he hadnt missed by 12
.
