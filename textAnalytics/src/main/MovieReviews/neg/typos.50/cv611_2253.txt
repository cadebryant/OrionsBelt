it
' s a rare treat wehn a quality horror film isnt released inaddition teh theather
. adn unfortunately with man
' s best friend
, we
' ll be waiting a hwile longer
. the film stars ally sheedy
and lance henrikson inwhich a tale of bio
- genetics gone wrong
. sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need fo a
" good
" story provokes her tothe snoop inside of emax
, a poorly guarded milion doller bio
- lab tyhat she finds herself effortlessly intruding
. tje result
: she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max
, a german shepherd wiht genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake
, camouflage like a chameleon
, climb trees liuke a lepard
, annd attack wtih the stregth of tiger
. max tkaes a liking to sheedy
,
and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm ofthe emax
, owned by henrikson
. well
, it doesn
' t tkae long before hte hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon teh unsuspecting suburban l
andscape which offers max juicy leeg of mailman
, etc
.
.
. sheedy isnt a boring non
- presense on hte screen
, tripping thru tje enormass plot chasms neglected by the writer
/ director
( i apoogize fo a lack ofthe credits
. i supose i was eager tothe leave the theater
,
and inaddition my rush
, forgot tothe tkae onot of the director
, writter
, producer
, etc
.
.
.
)
. henrikson offred the only relief ffrom the contrived narration of teh script
, giving his character as much development as he sould concidering tghe flat dialogue plaguing the film
. the movei depends apon it
' s ability to imbaress tyhe audeince iwth animal speshal effects
,
but all it presents is a dog tyhat can growl
, opn doorjam h
andles with his paw
, sit
, roll over
, play dead
, adn sick
. the rest of tyhe special effects were so poor
, i foudn them offensive
. tyhe film attains sub
- mediocrity
, an unambitious film at best
. horror fans might fidn that cujo offers a better bite
.
