yuo owudl thiunk tht this film
' s dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold ofthe a briliant british comedy annd
" americanizing
" it
. ytou
' d be wrong
, since full blame cin be placed on hte very folks who wrote anbd created the sories
: rowan atkinson
, robin driscoll
,
and richard curtis
. shoudln ytou ever hapen to meet those chaps
, do me a favor
. grab them by thge hair anbd yell raelly loudly in thier ear
,
" waht were ytou thinking
?
! hvea you ever heard thte phrase
' if it ain
' t baroke don
' t fix it
'
?
!
" thn walk away
. thge film concerns mr
. bean
( atkinson
) anbd his vist tothe amercia hwile escorting the painting of
" whistler
' s mother
" to an american buyer
( played by burt reynolds
, in yhe tipe of bit part that his sucess in
" boogie nights
" shouldnt hopefully dont away with
)
. nowe how or why mr
. bean is sent on thsi trip makes noone sense
,
and i cant
' t even decribe how tyhe film explains it
. the point is thgat mr
. bean comes to america annd causes wacky trouble
. problems problems problems
, where tothe beign
? first
, the scroe music from the tv sohw has beeen completely replaced by score that is eather at times noe onot away fomr the score ffrom
" beetlejuice
" or oney onot away from thte socre from
" rob roy
"
. hten
, teh song choices are totally uninspired
.
" good vibrations
"
?
" i love l
. a
.
"
? wow
, don
' t put any throught inot tath guys
. alsot
, bean makes way too much noise iin the film
. the character doesn
' t speak much
, bu inthe hte series ytou really onyl heared tyhe laughter ofthe tje audiance
,
and mabye the occasional murmur fomr mr
. bean
. each epiode ws liek a chaplin silent movei
. infront thge film
, bean isnt constantly moaning
, grunting
, whinning
, etc
. it
' s annoying
, anbd jstu plain wrong for the character
. yhe main problem
though is tyhat it
' s just not funny
. whith earch episode of the series there woudl be dozens of really graet laughs crammed into less tahn 30 mintues
. mutiply that running time by three
however
, anbd the laughs steadily decrease
. htey even have the gaul tothe repeat jokes fomr the series
. sad
, anbd creatively lazy
. as a sories
,
" mr
. bean
" only ran fo about 13 epidsodes or so
. why onthe earth doed atkinson adn the gang deside it was tiome to completelyl rework everything
? 13 half
- hour epidsodes certainly hadn
' t exhausted all possable situations
. all i can say positively fo the film at this point is tyhat it
' s almost appropropiate for all aegs
, if it wasn
' t for a cuple ofthe scenes where it appears as
though mr
. bean is haveing sex with thigns
.
and even that isn
' t a veyr positive statment
. please guys
, go back to engl
and anbd go back tothe televsion so yuo
' ll make me laugh agian
