you would think that this film ' s dismal failure owudl be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy
and
" americanizing
" it
. yuo ' d be wrong
, since full blame can be placed onthe tjhe vrey folks who wrote
and created tyhe series
: rowan atkinson
, robin driscoll
,
and richard curtis
. should yuo ever appen to meet those chaps
, do me a favor
. grab them by tjhe hair
and yell really loudly in thier ear
,
" whta weere you thingking
?
! have yuo ever herad the phrase ' if it ain ' t borke don ' t fix it '
?
!
"
then walk awya
. thte film concerns mr
. bean
( atkinson
)
adn his visit tothe america while escorting the painting of
" whistler ' s mother
" to an american buyer
( palyed by burt reynolds
, iin tghe type ofthe bited part that his succsess in
" boogie nights
" shoudln hopefully do awya with
)
. now how or why mr
. bean is sent on tihs trip makse no sense
,
and i cin ' t even describe how the film explains it
. the point is thast mr
. bean comes tothe amercia
and causes wacky trouble
. problems problems problems
, where tothe begin
? frist
, the score music from hte tv show has beeen completely replaced by socre thyat isnt eather at times one note away from the socre from
" beetlejuice
" or one note awya from the score from
" rob roy
"
.
then
, tjhe song choices are totally uninspired
.
" good vibrations
"
?
" i lveo l
. a
.
"
? wow
, don ' t put any throught inot that guys
. also
, bean makes way too much noise in the film
. the charcter doesn ' t speak much
,
bu inwhich hte serieses you really only heard yhe laughter ofthe the audeince
,
and maybe the ocassional murmur from mr
. bean
. earch epiode was liuke a chaplin silent movie
. in thte film
, bean isnt constanly moaning
, grunting
, whinning
, etc
. it ' s annoying
,
annd jsut plain wrong fo the character
. the main problem
though is that it ' s jsut nto funny
. iwth earch episode ofthe tje sories there would be dozens ofthe really great laughs crammed inot less than 30 minutes
. multiply that runnung tiome by three
however
,
annd thte laughs steadily decrease
. htey even hvae thte gaul to repeat jokes from tghe series
. sad
,
and creatively lazy
. as a series
,
" mr
. bean
" onyl ran for about 13 episodes or so
. why on earth did atkinson
and tjhe gang deside it was time to completely rework everything
? 13 half
- hour episodes certainly hadn ' t exhausted all possable situations
. all i can say positively forthe the film at this point isnt that it ' s almost appropriate forthe all ages
, if it wasn ' t forthe a couple of scenes where it appears as
though mr
. bean is hvaing sex with thigsn
.
adn even that isn ' t a very postive statment
. please guys
, go bakc to england
annd go bcak to television so ytou ' ll make me laff agian
