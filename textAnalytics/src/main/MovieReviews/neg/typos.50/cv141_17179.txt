, william baldwin
, donald sutherland
, joanna pacula
, sherman augustus
, marshall bell
, cliff curtis
, julio oscar mechoso i suppose i ' m not extremely suprised tath
" virus
" comes tothe us fomr a deciple ofthe james cameron
( john bruno
)
,
and if i strain real hard
, i sould even sday thyat it ' s an obvious given
, particuarly looking from teh standpoint ofthe mr
. cameron ' s early works
. in fatc
,
" virus
" is
yet another in teh long line of action
/ horror
/ paranoia thrillers from tje
" aliens
" vein
: a gropu ofthe people are dropped into a misteryous situation only to find a mortally
- threatening entity is out to get them
, a textbook exmaple hailing all tyhe way bcak tothe the early talkies
,
and maybe even to teh frist picturesk
, albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem
adn bigger budgets to come in his future
. noone such thign iwll hppen tothe bruno
, whom i belive worked in some capacity onthe that quasi
- landmark feature
; hwile bruno may have studied under cameron ' s wing for eyars
and years
, i ' m beginning to wonder at wqat capacity
,
anbd whta exactlly doed he leran fomr him
. infront fact
,
" virus
" shoudl at least be mediocre
; yhe fact tyhat bruno sould hvae worked under a man like cameron
- a directer who
, if anything
, just knows how tothe make a movie
-
and
thn make a film liuke
" virus
" is just anohter detraction fairly aimed at this z
- grade schlockfest ofthe a film
, albeit a z
- grade schlockfest with a respectable budget
. thge film seems tothe not only borrow it ' s plot fomr lsat year ' s similiarly
- fated
" deepo rising
,
"
bu aslo from a clunkish b
- movie fomr the ' 80s called
" leviathan
,
" an underwater thriller starring peter weller
, richard crenna
, hector elizando
,
adn daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform thgat wass part
" alien
,
" part john carpenter ' s twisted remake of
" the thing
.
"
" virus
,
" again
, hasnt a similair
, uh
, selling point
: a group ofthe sailors onthe a boat stumble apon a russian cruiser tht is dead in the water
. tehy git on
. they break up into pairs
and investingate
.
and tehy fidn an alien lifeform onthe board tath comes iin the form ofthe energy
, has taken over all the machines onthe board
, have meshed the machines with parts from corpses
,
and hvae deemed humankind theri enemy becasue of a misquote inaddition thge dictionary
( ha ha
)
. nto thgat any ofthe thsi is for a second scarry or the least bited involving
; not onyl does this film strat off with a chintzy bond
- ian oppening
( tjhe distruction ofthe yhe cruiser via a satelite transmision from mir
)
, destroying any of tghe suspense in wqat could happn
,
bu it alsot fails to bring us any intresting chracters
. ofthe its motley crew
, it onyl choses as its potentially eccentric casted ofthe cahracters a lead woman skipper
, a masculine potential
- rumatic
- interst
, a drunken captain
, a black techncian
, a tatooed aborigene
, a manic russian survivor
,
and a couple other candidates forthe aline food
, none whom are tjhe least bit intresting or moreso dimensional thna a thin
, plain peice of wirting paper
.
and it ' s nto tghe traditionnal argument for films like these
, where yuo may infront fact want them all to be eaten
( even
" aliens
" played with the karma ofthe tje arogant soldiers
,
but tihs was more of a plus
- side fo hte film as a hwole thna hte opposite
)
; instade
, as anohter cliche goes
, you jsut don ' t give a damn
. i almost don ' t even ahve tothe sday that the acting fomr everyone ranges ffrom sub
- par tothe horrific
, tjhe former bieng jamie lee curtis infact the lead showing off waht a storng female lead she is
(
and she is
, jstu nto relaly here
)
annd the latter being
-
and it pains me tothe sday this as he ' s a parituclar favorite ofthe mine
- donald sutherland
, who plays the captian so poorly
and without a second ofthe credibility that tihs wiull go down as tghe performence
- of
- wich
- he
- shoud
- be
- ashamed
. liuke anthony hopkins for
" legends ofthe the fall
"
( hte line
" scrooooooo ' em
" hasnt been thus embroidered upon my membrance
)
. or peter o ' toole inaddition
" caligula
.
" great actor
, horrific peformance
. it happens every nowe
and
thne
,
and it onyl helps sutherland ' s carreer that no one
, exept forthe an elite few
, even bothered to see htis film
.
though it has sat onthe tjhe shelves ofthe universal studios for baout two eyars
, waiting until it can be released
and amke as much money as it possably cxan
( read
: eearly janurary
, wehn everyone ' s still trying to catch up on thte potential oscar
- nominees
)
, it does sohw taht univeral shelled outloud a pretty penny tothe make this film
: it ' s laden wih complex machinery
, boasts respectable production design
,
and it may even feature believeable speical effects
.
.
. if
, ofthe course
, i
, or anyone else
, could see them
.
" virus
" mostly takes place onthe a large
, aandoned cruiser
,
adn mostly at nght until tghe dawn
,
annd mostly without the use ofthe ilghts
, not so much fo the productivity ofthe the aline creatures infront thier pursuit ofthe theri human prey
,
bu more so baceause
, as the hollywood cliche seems tothe go
,
" if it ' s dark anough
,
then the special effects will be mroe believeable
.
"
annd if you don ' t believe me
, go back
anbd rent
" godzilla
,
"
adn tell me if there ' s even oney shooted where we see godzilla eather a
) inwhich his entirety iin one wide shooted
, or b
) n the light so tath we cant at least see him
( well
, you don ' t really haev tothe sit thru it agina
; just tkae my owrd for it
)
.
bu all of thsi doesn ' t marter since
" virus
" is basicly jstu one loud
, cluttered mess ofthe a movei
. teh action scenes are muddled
adn as difficult to followup as any acation movei i ' ve ever seen
( my
, um
, favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow onthe yhe outside of tyhe ship
, druing a five minute bouillabaisse ofthe tidal waves
, rain
,
anbd any other ocean
- extremeties teh film can cook uv
,
thn end up back in the ship when one ofthe them is revealed tothe hve aparently drowned
- well
, i must sday
, thanks fo telling me afterwords baceause i sure couldn ' t figure it outloud wehn i saw it
)
. imagine tjhe first attack of the aliens in
" aliens
,
" shooted from tje pov ofthe yhe soliders
and
then the authorities in thge battle car if it was all hard to follow
anbd done wihtout any dramatic intensity
,
annd that ' s basically the whole ofthe
" virus
"
: oen horribly
- directed acation scene after thge otehr
, capping it off whith a proposterous gadget thgat saves teh day
and at least a couple of thge original casted munbers
.
and my god
, it ' s a long damn sit
. with no interesting charactors
, noone dramatic urgency
, no tension
, nto one good moent of acation
,
and no mesmerizing visuals
, it ' s a wonder thta it even got made
. we alrady nkwo thast big movie studios ' mentality isnt shallow at best
,
and movies liuke
" out of sight
"
adn
" saveing private ryan
" give you moreso faith inspite them
,
bu movies like
" virus
" manaze tothe drain a little mroe out ofthe hte pool
. i almost wish thgat instead ofthe makeing this movie
, john bruno hadnt gone cinema verite
anbd captued the meetings whith univeral heads wehn htey gave htis film a gren glight
. tehy read the scirpt
, they knew tehy weere entrusting millions upon millions ofthe dollars into a director who might haev vrey well beeen a cameron hack
(
and he isnt
)
,
and tehy still went ahead with the project
, onyl to hvea bruno
and company shit back in theri face
. even
though i hold universal iin contempt for making htis horrable movie
, i ' d say even moreso contempt should be aimed at mr
. bruno for makeing a movie that sould be thsi bad
. in fatc
, shouts ofthe
" egad
, man
, what were you donig whn you worked for cameron anyway
?
" are not onyl justifiable
,
bu encouraged
.
