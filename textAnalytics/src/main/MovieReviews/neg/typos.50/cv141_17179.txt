) starring
: jamie lee curtis
, william baldwin
, donald sutherl
and
, joanna pacula
, sherman augustus
, marshall bell
, cliff curtis
, julio oscar mechoso i supose i
' m nto extremly surprised that
" virus
" comes tothe us fomr a deciple of james cameron
( john bruno
)
,
and if i strain real hard
, i sould even sday tht it
' s an obvious given
, particuarly looking from the st
andpoint ofthe mr
. cameron
' s early works
. in fatc
,
" virus
" isnt
yet anohter iin tyhe long line of action
/ horror
/ paranoya thrillers from thge
" aliens
" vein
: a group of peopel are dropped into a mysterious situation onyl to find a mortally
- threatning entity is out tothe get them
, a textbook exmaple hailing all the way bcak tothe tyhe eary talkies
,
and mabey even to hte first pictures
, albiet redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem
and bigger budgets tothe cmo infact his future
. noone such thing wiull happen tothe bruno
, whom i believe worked infact some capacity onthe thast quasi
- l
andmark feature
; while bruno may hvea studied under cameron
' s wing for eyars
and years
, i
' m beggining tothe wonder at what capacity
, anbd whta exactly did he leran fomr him
. in fatc
,
" virus
" shoudl at least be medicore
; the fact that bruno coudl have worked under a man liek cameron
- a director who
, if anytying
, just konws how tothe make a movie
- adn
then mkea a film liek
" virus
" isnt just another detraction fairly aimed at tihs z
- grade schlockfest ofthe a film
, albiet a z
- grade schlockfest with a respectable budget
. the film seems to not only borrow it
' s plot from lastest year
' s similarly
- fated
" deepo rising
,
"
but also fomr a clunkish b
- movei ffrom tyhe
' 80s called
" leviathan
,
" an underwater thriller starring peter weller
, richard crenna
, hector eliz
ando
,
and daniel stern baout a gropu of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part
" aline
,
" part john carpentery
' s twisted remake ofthe
" thte thing
.
"
" virus
,
" again
, has a simmilar
, uh
, selling point
: a gropu of sailors onthe a boat stumble apon a russian cruiser tath isnt dead inwhich thte water
. they git on
. tehy break uv into pairs adn investigate
.
and tehy find an alien lifeform on board taht comes infact the form ofthe energy
, has tooked over all the machines on board
, haev meshed thge machines witht parts from corpses
, anbd have deemed humankind their enemy becasue of a misquote in the dictionary
( ha ha
)
. nto tath any ofthe tihs is for a second scary or the least bit involving
; not only doens this film strat off with a chintzy bond
- ian opening
( tjhe desctruction of hte cruiser via a satellite transmision ffrom mir
)
, destroying any of thge suspense inaddition wqat could hapen
,
but it aslo fails tothe bring us any interesting chracters
. ofthe its motley crew
, it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper
, a masculine potential
- rumatic
- interst
, a drunken captian
, a balck technician
, a tatooed aborigene
, a manic russian surviver
, annd a cuple other c
andidates for alien food
, none whom are the least bited intresting or more dimentional than a thin
, plain peice ofthe writing paper
. annd it
' s nto the traditionnal argumnt forthe films like theese
, where you may in fact wnat them all tothe be eaten
( even
" aliens
" plyed withthe yhe karma ofthe thge arrogant soliders
, bu this wass more of a plus
- side for the film as a hwole thna the opposite
)
; instead
, as anyother cliche goes
, yuo jsut don
' t give a damn
. i almsot don
' t even ahve to say that tyhe acting from everyone ranges from sub
- par to horrific
, the former bieng jamie lee curtis inwhich the lead showing off whta a storng female lead she isnt
(
and she isnt
, jstu nto really here
)
and the latter bieng
- anbd it pains me to say htis as he
' s a particular favorite ofthe mine
- donald sutherl
and
, who plays thte captian so poorly adn wihtout a second of credibility that htis wiull go down as the performance
- ofthe
- which
- he
- shouldnt
- be
- ashamed
. liuke anthony hopkins fo
" legends ofthe the fall
"
( the line
" scrooooooo
' em
" has beeen thus embroidered apon my membrance
)
. or peter o
' toole inwhich
" caligula
.
" great acotr
, horrific performence
. it happens eveyr now annd
then
, annd it only helps sutherl
and
' s career tht no one
, exept for an elite faw
, even bothered tothe see thsi film
.
though it has sat on tghe shelves ofthe univeral studios forthe baout twpo years
, waiting until it cant be released anbd mkae as much mney as it possably can
( read
: early januray
, when everyone
' s still trying to catch up onthe the potential oscar
- nominees
)
, it does sohw that universal shelled outloud a preety penny to mkae htis film
: it
' s laden with complex machinery
, boasts respectable production design
,
and it may even feature believeable speshal effects
.
.
. if
, ofthe course
, i
, or anyone else
, sould see them
.
" virus
" mostly takes palce on a larg
, aabndoned cruiser
,
and mostly at nigth until teh dawn
, anbd mostly wihtout the use of lighst
, not so much fo the productivity ofthe the alien creatures in their persuit of their human prey
,
but mroe so because
, as the hollywood cliche seems to go
,
" if it
' s dark enough
,
then tyhe spacial effects wiull be omre believable
.
" annd if you don
' t belieev me
, go bakc
and rent
" godzilla
,
" anbd tell me if htere
' s even one shooted where we see godzilla eather a
) inwhich his entirety inwhich one wide shooted
, or b
) n the light so that we cin at least see him
( well
, you don
' t realyl have to sit through it again
; just take my owrd forthe it
)
.
but all ofthe tihs doesn
' t marter sicne
" virus
" isnt basicaly jsut oney loud
, cluttered mess of a movei
. the action scenes are muddled
and as difficult to followup as any acation movei i
' ve ever seen
( my
, um
, favorite part wass the scene where a trio ofthe them end uv somehow onthe the outside ofthe the ship
, durring a five minute bouillabaisse ofthe tidal waves
, rain
, adn any other ocean
- extremeties the film cxan cook uv
, hten end up back infact teh ship when one of them isnt revealed to ahve apparently drowned
- well
, i must say
, thanks fo telling me afterwards because i sure couldn
' t figure it out when i saw it
)
. imagine the firt attack ofthe the aliens in
" aliens
,
" shooted from tje pov ofthe thte soldiers
and hten the authorities in the battle car if it wass all hard to followup annd done wihtout any dramtic intensity
,
and that
' s basically the wohle of
" virus
"
: one horribly
- directed action scene aftter tje otehr
, capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves tjhe day
and at least a couple of the origional cast munbers
. annd my god
, it
' s a long damn sit
. with noone interesting charachters
, noone dramatic urgency
, noone tension
, nto one good moment of action
,
and noone mesmerizing visuals
, it
' s a wonder that it even got made
. we already know that big movei studios
' mentality is shallow at best
, anbd movies liuke
" out of sighth
" anbd
" saveing private ryan
" give you more faith in them
, bu movies like
" virus
" manage to drain a little more outloud ofthe the pool
. i almost wish tyhat instead of mkaing thsi movei
, john bruno hadnt gone cinema verite adn capturd tje meetings with univeral heads when htey gavey this film a gren light
. htey read the script
, they knew htey weere entrusting millions upon millions ofthe dollars into a directer who might ahve very well beeen a cameron hack
( annd he isnt
)
, adn they still went ahead iwth thte project
, onyl to haev bruno
and company shit bakc infact theri face
. even
though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movei
, i
' d sday even moreso contempt shouldnt be aimed at mr
. bruno fo making a movei taht coudl be this bad
. in fact
, shouts ofthe
" egad
, man
, what weere you doign when ytou worked forthe cameron anyway
?
" are nto onyl justifiable
,
but encouraged
.
