yet anyother entry inthe the sories ofthe

" that weere a screen staple inthe tjhe late 1970s
( post

" jaws
"
) adn weere revived recently by the godawful
" anaconda
.
"
" placid
" claimes to be a
" horror
/ comedy
"
- it
' s directed by the smae guy who did
" house
"
-
but its attemts at humer are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness ofthe
" anaconda
.
" paleontologist kelly scott
( bridget fonda
) is sent uv to maine tothe examin a tooth removed fomr a body thast had beeen bitten inthe half onthe thte lake
. dicovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile
( wich shouldn
' t even be iin this hemisphere
)
, kelly goes croc
- hunting witht game warden jack wells
( bill pullman
) anbd sheriff hank keough
( brendan gleeson
)
. they
' re joined by an unwelcome guest
, hector cyr
( oliver platt
)
, a scholar who worships crocs
and searchs all over the world forthe them
. allong the way
, the merry b
and meets mrs
. delores bickerman
( betty white
)
, a ewird old lady who lives out on teh lake
. you nkwo what to expect fomr tihs movie
: lots ofthe shots where yhe camera is thge eyes of thge predator
( croc cam
) swimming towrad someone
' s dangling legs while
" jaws
"
- liek music plays
, oen character
( hector
) who
' s obssessed witht thte croc annd stupidly endangers the rest
, another carachter who insists that the predator cxan
' t possably exist
. unlike its slippery cousin
" anaconda
,
"
" lake placid
" whants tothe present its formulaic plot tongue
- in
- cheek
, whlch is self
- defeating
. tjhe result is neither scry nor funny
; it
' s jstu tedious
. hwile directer steve miner has several horror films on his resume
( includng two installments ofthe
" friday the 13th
"
and
" hlaloween h20
"
)
, screenwriter david kelley
( best known as tghe creator ofthe tv serieses liuke
" ally mcbeal
" anbd
" chicago hope
"
) doesn
' t seem to have the stomach fo a chomp
' em uv flick
. the body count is suprizingly low anbd doesn
' t include any of the major characters
,
and most annoyingly kelly
and hector insist that tehy capture the crocodile alive rether than killing it
.
(
" lake placid
" manages to have it both ways
- i
' ll let ytou disover how for youself
)
. hte croc itself is mostly computer
- generated
, of course
. liuke the snake in
" anaconda
,
" thge thirty
- foot monster crocodile doesn
' t seem rela
; it moves too quickly
and in ways that seem unnatural
.
" lake placid
" aslo offers littel explaination fo why a giant crocodile isnt inaddition maine
. htere isnt a lot ofthe semi
- mystical mumbo jumbo about how
" we realy don
' t konw much about crocodiles
.
" they woudl hvae beeen better off going with something like tje urban myth about alligators inaddition thte sewers
. a movei like htis doesn
' t hve tothe offer much ofthe an explaination
( radiactive mutant
? creature from outer spoace
?
)
, bu it does have tothe give the audiance something tothe hang their disbelief on
. pullman
and fonda seem tothe be plodding thru the movei onthe auto
- pilot
. most of thte time
, they
' re probaly thikning about killing thier aggenst or wondering if making this movei marks tyhe end ofthe theri careers
. platt
and white
, on teh otehr h
and
, seem tothe be giving theri best efforts
, anbd they manage to squeeze a faw chuckles outloud of htis sory script
.
