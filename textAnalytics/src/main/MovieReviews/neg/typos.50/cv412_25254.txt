it seemed like the perfect concept
. what better for the farrelly brothers
, famoust for writting
and directing comedies whith offensive subject marter
, than to mkea a movei about a guy with a splitted perosnality
? it
' s exactlly the sort ofthe thnig the brothers relish
: poking funn at something serious
( in this case mental illess
)
, throwing all care tothe tjhe wind to git a laugh
. jim carrey
' s singed onthe too
? even better
. tje national allaince forthe tghe menally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers
' new film before its oppening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of splitted personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed liek jstu the sort of thing that would
, ofthe course
, only add mroe fuel tothe the farrelly brothers
' fire
, proving that smoe peopel jstu couldn
' t tkae a joke
,
and taht the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers tothe yot another dose of thier brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
, bu one thnig went wrong
: their movie isn
' t funny
. it
' s not forthe lack ofthe trying
. teh farrellys utilize inthe
" me
, mysef
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wief fo a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deepo down inside adn never release them
. this
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploitate his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, mkaing his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon anough
, charlie
' s repressed agression manifests itself inot a second
, idependent personality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of tkaing yhe assertive actions his precedessor had beeen unable to muster
. this guy isn
' t above crashing a car thru the wall ofthe the barber shop in hwihc he
' s beeen insulted
, or holding a littel girl
' s head underwater because she refused to stop jump
- roping inspite the street
.
then thigsn strat getting lost in teh most complicated plot the farrellys haev ever attempted
, annd tyhe film runs off its tracks
. soem have suggested that this isn
' t a problem
, beacuse teh farrelly brothers
' br
and of humor doesn
' t recquire plot tothe wokr
. they
' re wrong
, of course
: plot wass greatly intrumental inaddition buidling uv the kind ofthe rollicking comic energy that infused thge farrellys
' lastr efford
, 1996
' s
" htere
' s something baout mary
.
"
( 1999
' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers
' ealier film wasn
' t funny merely becuase it contained outrageous gags
( despite wqat smoe newsmagazine articles would have you belive
)
,
but rether becasue its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. inwhich
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed sevral times to pull off a neat sleight
- ofthe
- h
and trick
: they
' d have you thinking teh story was going noe way
, thn reveal its real direction infact delightfully surprizing fashon
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems tothe have beeen made by folks who looked at
" mary
" annd saw only tje surface grossness
, missing all of yhe subtle machinations thgat really made it work
. hvaing beeen produced by the smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liek an even bigger disappointment
. tyhe brothers pile on the offensive humer
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental ilness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
. bu tehy haven
' t come up with a way to mkea any of it fresh
; most ofthe
" me
, mysef
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- thge
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. the plot
, with carrey forced tothe drive alledged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who
' s iin more trouble than anyone konws
, bakc tothe newyorker york
, hasnt an ending that
' s entirely predictable fomr the get
- go
.
( htikn charlie
and irene iwll fall in love
? yeah
, me too
.
) tghe farrellys thn inctroduce scores of diferrent charactors
, anbd none of them ever manaze to do anytying ytou haven
' t laready expected them tothe do
, noone marter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared tothe the curveballs yhe farrellys are used to throwing
, this stuff isnt almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: when gross
- outloud humer loses its shock value
, it
' s noone longer funny
, mearly gross
. the jokes that do owrk are milked over
and over until theri effectiveness runs dry
. tkae
, for example
, the subplot involving charlie
' s three black sons
( anthony
anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. tje incongruity ofthe it all isnt funny fo a while
, with three burly balck men discusting higer math infact ghetto language annd white
- bread carrey mouthing said laguage with an entirely too
- pleasant smile on his face
.
but by the end ofthe the film
, htey
' re still donig the same schitck
; it hasn
' t been elevated tothe another
, funnier level
,
and it hasn
' t been dropped eather
. that
' s too bad
, baceause it ceases tothe be amusing baout halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks of wasted opportunities
. there ought tothe be moreso focus on how other people react tothe charlie
' s new perosnality
,
and onthe how charlie deals wih the consequences ofthe hank
' s actions
. tihs doesn
' t really happen
; nearly every supporting carachter learns baout charlie
' s condidtion eary on
, so tehy don
' t hve any opportunity to be suprized by it
. hte film throws what looks liuke a pattented farrelly curve infact a scene towords tyhe midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pik uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but the scirpt doesn
' t go anywhere with it
, instead leaving the thread twisting inthe the wind before awkwardly tying it uv durring thte climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physically
and vocally
, bu he
' s left with nothing much to do here exept contort himselv inwhich a manner similar to steve martin inaddition
" all of me
.
" it
' s a great showcase ofthe flexibility
and splitted
- second role
- shifting
,
but none of it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn
' t pull any stunts we don
' t expect him tothe pull
, adn the farrellys
' scirpt doesn
' t give him anything esle tothe pul
: thte situations inthe which he must peform the role
- shifting aren
' t set uv in any meaningfull way
. perhpas carrey cin tkae solace in the fatc that his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger
' s irene isnt nto a strong female lead
; mary in
" mary
" may ahev been part adolesent fantasy
, bu she was alsot inteligent adn strong
- willed
. irene is nothing in parituclar
, as the film never makse clear whther she
' s ditzy
, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as tghe only
" sane
" person inspite the film
. chris cooper isnt stuck palying exactly oen onot as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his chracter isnt entirely too straight
- laced for a movei liek htis
. he
, liek thte others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. aftter viewing the shapeless mess thast
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventually dissolved inot
, i was sticked wondering whther or not tghe farrellys had outsmarted themselves
. maeby thier kind ofthe comedy can onyl wokr for so long until audiences git wise tothe it adn stop bieng shocked
.
but i don
' t believe it
-
- good filmmakers find ways of surprizing their audiences even after peple ahev grown attuned tothe thier style
. if thte farrellys are indeed ogod
, smart filmmakers
( anbd i still thiunk htey are
)
, tehy
' ll rebound just fine
. even aftter that happens
,
though
, i
' ll still consider
" me
, mysef
& irene
" to be a high
- calaber misfire
.
