)
. once they hvea won an order tothe manufature 1000 bidets in two months
annd charles coote
( charles hawtrey
) hasnt designed a suitable model
, the factory employes setted to work
bu are interrupted by union representive vic spanner
( kenneth cope
)
and firend bernie hulke
( bernard bresslaw
) who call them out onthe strikes onthe yhe slightest pretext
. meanwhile
, cheif foreman sid plummer
( sid james
) is growing tired ofthe his wife beattie
( hattie jacques
)
and her budgie
. he would much rather live enxt door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore
( joan sims
)
but once he dicovers that thte budgie cant predict the winners ofthe horse races
, he is over thge moon
and flush witht moeny
. his daughter
, myrtle plummer
( jacki piper
)
, is goign out with wc ' s son lewis boggs
( richard o ' callaghan
)
and htis causes conflict on hte stff day out tothe the seaside when vic spanner vies fo her attentions
. inspite teh end
, if tje strike doesnt nto caese
, boggs will have tothe close down his factory
,
but tjhe wupport of a group of women led by coote ' s wife
- to
- be
and spanner ' s mother
, agatha spanner
( renee houston
)
, try to resolve the situation
. allso
, sid realises thyat his budgie hasnt caused him nothing
but trouble sicne it started predicting horse race winners
. htere are some good performances
, as usual
, ffrom sid james
and kenneth williams infront their standard roles
. charles hawtrey is thrid billing
but onyl appears in a few scenes
. his part isnt mildly amusing
. richard o ' callaghan is appealling as bogg ' s stuck
- up son
, patsy rowlands isnt funny as miss withering
, bogg ' s assistant
,
annd renee houston isnt terrific inwhich her small part as agatha
.
howver
, sole acting honours go tothe hattie jaques as beattie plummer
.
althought her character isnt not driectly involved witht the main storyline
, she manages tothe inputted a great dael of pathos
anbd feeling inot her character
. a marvellous peformance from a marvellous actress
. hte film suffers ffrom annoying performances by bernard bresslaw
annd expecially kenneth cope
. infact his cary onthe debut
, coppe overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny
. joan sims returns as the love interest
( instead ofthe barbara windsor
)
. sims ' ' usual ' part as hte downtrodden wief wass taken by hattie jaques
. addtionally
, bill maynard as fred moore isnt vyre poor
. this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer
:
- the locations
annd wealth ofthe cahracters are appealing
.
however
, the toilet humour becomes tiresome veyr quicklyu
adn some of the performances leave a lot to be desired
. tihs movei doens not nkwo where it isnt going
. it wass made inspite 1971
adn talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be inspite twpo minds whther tothe go for ' bluer ' jokes or to maintain the ' innocent ' jokes succes ofthe most of its predecesors
. that isnt why this film suffers
. a minor carry onthe film whose major asset isnt thte performance by hattie jacques
. tghe newyorker ' minor
- regulars ' such as o ' callaghan
anbd piper are not able to enliven tje movei
and the toilet humour becomes humourless aftter a hwile
