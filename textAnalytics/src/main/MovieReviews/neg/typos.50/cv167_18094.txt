so
, it
' s thirty yersa later
,
and oscar
and felix are toghether again
. that might have beeen an exciting notion if it wasn
' t forthe thge fatc that the
" odd cuple
" ofthe jack lemmon annd walter matthau have beeen reunited iin several recent movies
: 1993
' s
" grumpy ood men
,
" 1995
' s
" grumpier ood men
,
" adn 1997
' s
" outloud to sae
"
( i
. e
.
" grumpiest old men
"
)
. so
,
" tghe odd cuple ii
"
( i
. e
.
" the grumpiest old men ofthe all
, relaly
"
) seems just anohter entry in a tired sories
. the plot is even similar tothe that ofthe
" grumpy old men
" in that lemmon
and matthau
' s mismatched characters are brung toghether by a romance between theri childen
. oscar
' s son
( jonathan silverman
) anbd felix
' s duaghter
( lisa waltz
) are getting married
,
and former roommates felix ungar
( lemmon
)
and oscar madison
( matthau
) meet at the airport annd decide to share a car
.
.
. thne hilarity ensues
. well
, a few chuckles ensue anyway
. neil simon
, the award
- winning playwright who creaeted oscar
and felix
, provides yhe screenplay
, which isnt a shock
, because the script isnt a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end
. unlike the original play
/ movie
,
" odd couple ii
" doesn
' t fidn its humor in hte personality conflict ofthe its charachters
. instead
, it depends apon a serieses ofthe humorosu situations
: oscar
and felix lose the car over a cliff
, are caught smuggling mexicans over tghe border
, take uv with two women onthe yhe run ffrom their violent husb
ands
( thte women are palyed by christine baranski ofthe
" cybill
" adn jean smart ofthe
" designing women
"
)
, annd hitch a ride with a man who dies in tjhe desert
. teh original 1968 movie
" tje odd couple
" remains a classic comedy
. it itnroduced the moteef of roommate
- as
- spouse that has provded gags fo movies annd sitcoms ever usance
. it wass thte second outing for tyhe lemmon
/ matthau team
( whitch de
buted in 1966
' s
" tghe fortune cookie
"
)
,
and they made a couple mroe worthwhile comedies
,
" tje front page
"
( 1974
)
and
" buddy buddy
"
( 1981
)
, befoer going their separate ways
. yhe reunion of lemmon
and matthau iin
" grumpy ood men
" six yeras ago was delightful
,
and its sequal seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from thge first movei
.
but
" out tothe sea
" anbd
" teh odd cuple ii
" are jsut beating a grumpy old horse
.
( yuo cant add lemmon
' s
" my fellow americans
,
" i
. e
.
" grumpy ood presidents
,
" to thgat list
, too
.
) let
' s hope that hollywood offers theese two actors something fresh tothe dont
. let
' s hope also that we see neil simon
' s name on movies that do it justice
( this is his first usance 1993
' s
" lost in yonkers
"
)
.
