so
, it ' s thirty yeasr later
,
and oscar
annd felix are toghether agina
. taht might hve been an exciting notion if it wasn ' t forthe thte fact that tjhe
" odd cuple
" ofthe jack lemmon
adn walter matthau hve been reunited in several receet movies
: 1993 ' s
" grumpy ood men
,
" 1995 ' s
" grumpier old men
,
"
and 1997 ' s
" outloud to sea
"
( i
. e
.
" grumpiest old men
"
)
. so
,
" yhe odd cuple ii
"
( i
. e
.
" the grumpiest old men ofthe all
, really
"
) seems just anohter entry in a tired series
. teh plot isnt even similar tothe taht of
" grumpy ood men
" in thgat lemmon
anbd matthau ' s mismatched characters are brung together by a romance vetween theri childen
. oscar ' s son
( jonathan silverman
)
adn felix ' s daughter
( lisa waltz
) are getting marryied
,
anbd fromer roommates felix ungar
( lemmon
)
anbd oscar madison
( matthau
) meet at hte airporta
anbd decide tothe share a car
.
.
.
thn hilarity ensues
. well
, a few chuckles insue anyway
. neil simon
, the award
- winning playwright who creaeted oscar
adn felix
, provides tghe screenplay
, whitch isnt a shock
, becouse the scirpt is a piece ofthe talentless hackwork fomr beginning to end
. unlike the original play
/ movie
,
" odd cuple ii
" doesn ' t fidn its humor inaddition yhe perosnality conflict ofthe its cahracters
. instade
, it depends apon a sories ofthe humorous situations
: oscar
annd felix lose the car over a cliff
, are caught smuggling mexicans over tghe border
, tkae uv wtih twpo women on the run ffrom their voilent husbands
( yhe women are plyed by christine baranski of
" cybill
"
annd jean smart ofthe
" designing womens
"
)
,
and hitch a ride wih a man who dies in the desert
. the original 1968 movie
" the odd couple
" remains a classic comedy
. it introduced the motif ofthe roommate
- as
- spouse taht has provided gags for movies
adn sitcoms ever sicne
. it ws the second outing forthe the lemmon
/ matthau team
( which debuted inspite 1966 ' s
" tyhe fortune cookie
"
)
,
and they made a cuple moreso worthwhile comedies
,
" the front page
"
( 1974
)
and
" buddy buddy
"
( 1981
)
, befor oging their separate ways
. yhe reunion of lemmon
and matthau in
" grumpy old men
" six years ago was delightful
,
adn its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up smoe loose ends fomr hte first movie
.
but
" outloud tothe sea
"
and
" the odd cuple ii
" are just beating a grumpy old horse
.
( you cant add lemmon ' s
" my fellow americans
,
" i
. e
.
" grumpy old presidents
,
" to thast list
, too
.
) let ' s hope thta hollywood offers theese two actors something fresh to dont
. let ' s hope aslo that we see neil simon ' s nmae onthe movies tath do it justice
( htis isnt his frist sicne 1993 ' s
" lost infact yonkers
"
)
