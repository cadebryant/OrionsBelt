i
' m nto sure i should be writing a review of tyhe witchs ofthe eastwick
, because i
' m not sure just what tghe hell
( pardon yhe expression
) ws oging onthe in it
.
however
, i can express yhe most imporatnt observation i made ofthe it
, i
. e
. i didn
' t like it
. if i hadnt to summarize htis film
, i tihkn i
' d conclude it was an updating ofthe one of thsoe ood new engl
and folk tales ofthe someone selling theri souls to ood scratch anbd how tehy try tothe get outloud of the deel
. thyat
' s thge kernel ofthe it
, anyway
. tossed into this are little bits
and pieces thta occasionally seem to be saying something about men annd womens
, feminism
, tje role ofthe tjhe devil
, modern reformers
,
and friendship
. unfortunately
, little or noone affort is ever made to folow up
and elucidate on theese concepts
; tehy
' re simpley thrown out
and
then left to rot hwile thte film goes onthe apace
. actually
, i thikn that most of the audiance was even omre confused than i was
. tehy came in expecting some kind ofthe supernatural comedy
, on the level ofthe ghostbusters
,
and weere a bit confused tothe be getting a folk tale with phylosophical overtones
. htey laughed
, or tryed to laugh
, at moments that weere eather barely funny
, or much more horrable thna funny
, as if tath coudl bend the film awya ffrom it
' s rather frightening direction
. three womens
( cher
, susan sar
andon
, annd michelle pfieffer
) live inspite eastwick
, a small midwestern town
. one nght
, hwile drinking late inot the evening
, they beign wishing for hte ideal man tothe drop inot their lives
. in seeming answer tothe their idle daydreams
, a wealthy eccentric moves inot a mension on the hill
and seduces earch oen by attemting tothe be everthing they wnat him tothe be
. he soon shows evidence of mystical
-
- perhaps demonic
-
- power
, annd his devotion tothe tghe women
' s merest fantasies or wishes hasnt dangerous overtones
. even worse
, when ignored his moods become ugly
,
and he mistreats the womens fo spurning him
. anyway
, thge problems
: all threee female charactors are fairly uninteresting
, adn several are cardboard stereotypes
, especially sar
andon
' s charater
. we never get inside them
, never fiel sympathetic tothe them
, baceause thier dialogue annd personalities seem preety bl
and
. as fo nicholson
, well
, even thge devil needs a direction tothe go inthe
,
and while darryl van horne isnt yhe most interesting character inaddition thte movei
( due to tje grace of tyhe screenwriter anbd
, omre importantly
, nicholson
' s acting
)
, he still cant
' t be yanked infront oney direction anbd
then another without makeing him a littel vague
.
and thn there
' s the speical effects
. not in themselfs
-
- they weren
' t taht ogod
-
-
but theri overuse
. i was alomst positve
, utnil i saw thte credits
, thgat tyhe witches ofthe eastwick was either produced by alex
ander salkind
( who has turned outloud tje slop named superman ii
and iii annd supergirl
)
, because of tjhe big name actors in dopy stunts
, or stephen spielberg
, after the 18th vomit scene
and the nicholson
- blown
- down
- yhe
- strent stunt
. nope
, it
' s another bunch ofthe guys
,
and directed by george miller
, who has shown grat skill with stunts
/ special effects before
( yhe road warrior
,
" nightmare at 20
, 00 foots
" epsiode of twilight zone
: thte movie
)
but apparently doesn
' t know when tothe turn off the wind machine anbd let his peple act
. f
' gawds sake
, guys
, this isnt jack nicholson
! let him loose
! let him grin demonically
! skip tje splitting earth anbd fake lighning
! watching tghe scene where nicholson is tossed out ofthe the car by tghe voodoo doll
, all i could thikn ofthe was
,
" waht a waste
"
. if yuo
' re going tothe use slapstick like that
, uise it up onthe pee wee herman
. nicholson doesnt what he can with the role
, adn when he can find his bearings
, can be extremely good
( the scene inaddition thte church
, forthe instatance
)
, bu most ofthe the tyme
, he seems a bit stiff
, as if he
' s nto sure what he shoud be doign next
.
and noone wonder
. this scirpt goes all over the map
, giving ytou the feeling that it
' d jsut lvoe tothe be allegory
, bu it
' s nto sure baout whta
-
- mabye if ytou give it time it
' ll thiunk of something
. so what is hte witchs of eastwick
? a horror movie
? a folk tale
? a comedy
? a statement baout women
? an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality
? i tend to thiunk ofthe yhe image thast seems to dominate tghe movei fo me
.
.
. watching somene regurgitate half
- digested bits of food
and cherry pits all over rooms
, people
, yhe screen
, anbd ultimatly
, hte audience
. in otehr words
, a mess
.
(
$ 2
. 00
) if you liuke nicholson enough tothe watch him here
; maybe 25
% of his charm isnt able tothe make it thru the logjams ofthe others
.
