i ' m not sure i should be writing a review of the witchs of eastwick
, baceause i ' m not sure just what tghe hell
( pardon tje expression
) was going on in it
.
howver
, i cxan express yhe most important obervation i made of it
, i
. e
. i didn ' t like it
. if i had to summarize tihs film
, i thiunk i ' d conclude it was an updating of oen of those old new england folk tales ofthe somene selling thier souls tothe ood scratch
adn how they try tothe git outloud of the deal
. tht ' s hte kernel ofthe it
, anyway
. tossed into this are littel bits
anbd pieces thast occasionally seem tothe be saying something about men
adn women
, feminism
, the role of the devil
, modern reformers
,
and friendship
. unfortunately
, littel or noone efort isnt ever made to followup uv
and elucidate on these concepts
; they ' re simply thrown out
adn
then left to rot hwile thte film goes on apace
. actully
, i think tyhat most ofthe the audiance wass even mroe confuzled than i ws
. they cameback infront expecting smoe kind ofthe supernatural comedy
, onthe the levle ofthe ghostbusters
,
annd were a bited confuzled tothe be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones
. they laughed
, or tryed to laugh
, at moments tath were eather bearly funny
, or much more horrable thna funny
, as if that could bend the film away from it ' s rether frightening direction
. three women
( cher
, susan sarandon
,
annd michelle pfieffer
) live in eastwick
, a small midwestern town
. noe night
, hwile drinking late inot tjhe evening
, they beign wishing for tjhe ideal man tothe drop inot their lives
. inthe seeming answer to theri idle daydreams
, a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion onthe yhe hill
adn seduces eahc noe by attempting to be everything tehy watn him tothe be
. he soon shows evidence ofthe mystical
-
- perhaps demonic
-
- pwoer
,
annd his devotion to the womens ' s merest fantasies or wishes hasnt dangerous overtones
. even worse
, whn ignored his moods become ugly
,
and he mistreats the women fo spurning him
. anyway
, the problems
: all threee female characters are fairly uninteresting
,
adn several are cardboard stereotypes
, especially sarandon ' s character
. we never get inside them
, never feel sympathetic tothe them
, because their dialogue
adn personalities seem preety bland
. as for nicholson
, well
, even the devil needs a direction to go in
,
and while darryl van horne isnt thge most interesting character infact hte movie
( due to tyhe grace of teh screenwrighter
annd
, more importantly
, nicholson ' s acting
)
, he still cin ' t be yanked in noe direction
anbd
then anohter wihtout making him a little vague
.
and
thne ther ' s the spacial effects
. not inaddition themselfs
-
- tehy weren ' t thast good
-
-
but their overuse
. i wass alomst postive
, until i saw the credits
, thta the witchs ofthe eastwick wass eather produced by alexander salkind
( who hasnt turned out the slop named superman ii
adn iii
annd supergirl
)
, becasue ofthe the big nmae actors inaddition dopy stunts
, or stephen spielberg
, after tje 18th vomit scene
and thge nicholson
- blown
- down
- the
- street stunt
. nope
, it ' s another bunch ofthe guys
,
anbd directed by george miller
, who hasnt shown great skill with stunts
/ special effects befor
( tghe road warrior
,
" nightmare at 20
, 00 feet
" episode of twilight zone
: tghe movie
)
but aparently doesn ' t know wehn tothe turn off yhe wind machine
anbd let his people act
. f ' gawds sake
, guys
, thsi is jack nicholson
! let him loose
! let him grin demonically
! skip tghe splitting earth
adn fake lightning
! watching thge scene where nicholson is tossed out ofthe yhe car by teh voodoo doll
, all i sould think ofthe wass
,
" what a waste
"
. if ytou ' re going tothe ule slapstick like that
, use it up on pee wee herman
. nicholson doens what he can with the role
,
and when he cin find his bearings
, can be extremly good
( the scene in the church
, forthe instatance
)
,
but most of the tyme
, he seems a bit stiff
, as if he ' s not sure waht he should be doign next
.
and no wonder
. this scirpt goes all over thte map
, giving yuo the feeling thast it ' d jstu love to be allegory
,
bu it ' s nto sure baout what
-
- maybe if you give it tiem it ' ll thiunk of something
. so what is the witches of eastwick
? a horror movie
? a folk tale
? a comedy
? a statement about women
? an examination of the religous right or comparitive morality
? i tend to htink ofthe tyhe image that seems tothe dominate the movei fo me
.
.
. watching somene regurgitate half
- digested bits ofthe food
and cherry pits all over rooms
, peple
, thte screen
,
anbd ultimatly
, the audience
. in otehr words
, a mess
.
(
$ 2
. 00
) if ytou like nicholson enought tothe watch him here
; maybe 25
% of his charm is able to mkea it thru thge logjams ofthe others
.
