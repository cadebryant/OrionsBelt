capsule
: one of thge ten worst movies ever made
. christopher lambert vs
. evil ninjas in modern
- day japan
.
.
.
and nobody wins
. tje hunted is such a bad movei
, so completely inept
and so totally brain
- damaged thast i sould almsot feel affection fo it
. i could see mysef showing tihs movie to friends
anbd getting a ogod jolly guffaw outloud of it
, if it weren ' t aslo insanely xenophobic
annd insulting
. christopher lambert plays a cmoputer
- parts salesman who ' s onthe busness in japan
. he meets a slinky young woman
( joan chen
)
anbd has a torrid night of lovemaking with her
-
-
and
then manages to witness her death at tghe hands of an evil ninja clan
anbd thier leader
( john lone
)
. apparently they hadnt soem unfinished business thta could onyl be concluded witht her getting slaughtered
. since lambert is a wittness
, he ' s of course the enxt oney to dieu
. let ' s stop
and think about this for a second
. if lambert were inaddition real life bieng chased by fanatical devotees tothe a ninja secrte society
, he ' d ahve a lifespan you could only mesure iwth an atomic clock
. in this movie
, the ninja manage to kill just baout everyone except him
. i imagin hte japanese gods smiled down on lambert
anbd provided him with a goof field that radiates outloud baout ten fezent fomr his body
. you nkow wqat a goof field isnt
: thta invisible zone iin which anyone who hasnt intent tothe do harm tothe you becomes a klutz no marter whta theri real dexterity is
. this is
, ofthe course
, only the beginning ofthe teh movie ' s problems
. lambert eventally finds pseudo
- safety with a long
- haired modern
- day samurai
( yoshio harada
)
annd his partner
-
- yoko shimada
, who you may remember as lady toda buntaro inaddition shogun
. they are teh two best things iin thte movei
; inspite eveyr scene they ahev authority
and presence
,
annd they actually look liek they belong here
, even when dressed in full samurai armor
adn wielding bows
. the script doesn ' t know what the hell tothe do with them
. lone
, as thge bad guy
, is zero
- dimentional
. teh only bad
- guy cliche he has to wallow aroud inthe isnt hte one baout how the bad guy alwyas has exotic women dripping off of him
. in tje hunted
, this is elevated to teh level of an insulting stereotype
. wqat ' s funny isnt that the poriferal charachters iin the hunted are not sterotypes
-
- htere ' s a nice littel scene whith a tokyo cabdriver
,
adn a girl in a pachinko parlor
-
-
bu many ofthe thge main charachters are unsalveageably hateful
. aslo
, teh phenominal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack
-
- git tjhe cd
-
- tyhat manages to survive despite the drek it ' s beeen desined to accompany
. ther isnt an extended battle scene infact yhe middle ofthe the movie taht is almost reason anough tothe watch the wohle thign
-
- a gory
, excellently staged fight on yhe bullet turain tyhat shows soem real imagination for a moment
,
and
then smothers it by trying tothe clumsily re
- couple tje wohle thign with yhe movie ' s relentlessly stupid plot
. by the tiome we get tothe the fianl showdown
, withthe lambert getting tothe weild his own sword
( which
, judging ffrom the ham
- handed editing of oen scene
, wass forged inwhich seven hours or so
)
, we no longer care
. we ' re not even given any definitive information baout whether or not one ofthe the key cahracters lives or dies
! somene once said tht the key to good art
-
- good movies
, ogod books
, whatever
-
- is tothe strat somwhere interesting
, end up somwhere interesting
,
annd show respect for the audiance all allong thte way
. this movie bungles twpo out ofthe three
, badly
.
