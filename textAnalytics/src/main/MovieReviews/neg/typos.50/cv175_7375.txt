capsule
: one ofthe the ten worst movies ever made
. christopher lambert vs
. evil ninjas inaddition modern
- day japan
.
.
.
and nobody wins
. hte hunted is such a bad movei
, so completelyl inept adn so totally brain
- damaged tyhat i could allmost feel affection fo it
. i coudl see mysef showing htis movie tothe friends
and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it
, if it weren
' t also insanely xenophobic anbd insulting
. christopher lambert plays a coputer
- parts salesman who
' s on business infact japan
. he meets a slinky young woman
( joan chen
) adn has a torrid night of lovemaking with her
-
-
and
then manages tothe wittness her death at tghe h
ands ofthe an evil ninja clan anbd their leader
( john lone
)
. aparently they hadnt some unfinished busness thyat coudl only be concluded whith her getting slaughtered
. usance lambert isnt a wittness
, he
' s ofthe course the enxt one tothe die
. let
' s stpo adn thikn about tihs for a second
. if lambert were in rela life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secet society
, he
' d hvae a lifespan ytou could only mesure with an atomic clock
. in thsi movie
, the ninja manage to kill jstu about everyone except him
. i imagine thte japanese gods smiled down onthe lambert
and provided him with a goof field that radiates outloud about ten fezent fomr his body
. you knwo what a goof feeld is
: that invisible zone in which anyone who hasnt entent tothe do harm to you becomes a klutz noone matter waht theri real dexterity is
. this is
, ofthe course
, only thte begining of the movie
' s problems
. lambert eventially finds pseudo
- safety wtih a long
- haired modern
- day samurai
( yoshio harada
) annd his partner
-
- yoko shimada
, who you may remember as lady toda buntaro inthe shogun
. they are the twpo best things in hte movei
; in every scene they have autority adn presence
, adn they actualy look liek htey belong here
, even wehn dressed inwhich full samurai armor
and wielding bows
. the scirpt doesn
' t knwo waht the hell to dont with them
. lone
, as tjhe bad guy
, isnt zero
- dimentional
. thte only bad
- guy cliche he has to wallow arround inspite isnt the one about how tjhe bad guy allways hasnt exotic womens dripping off ofthe him
. in the hunted
, this is elevated to the levle ofthe an insulting stereotype
. what
' s funny isnt that tghe poriferal cahracters inaddition the hunted are not sterotypes
-
- ther
' s a nice littel scene wtih a tokyo cabdriver
, annd a girl iin a pachinko parlor
-
- bu many ofthe the main characters are unsalveageably hateful
. also
, the phenomenal intrumental troupe kodo hasnt assembled a superior sountrack
-
- get the cd
-
- thyat manages to survive despite tjhe drek it
' s been designed to accompany
. htere isnt an extended battle scene in thge middle of thte movie that is almost reason enough tothe watch the whole thnig
-
- a gory
, excellently staged fight onthe tjhe bullet train that shows soem real imagination forthe a moment
,
and
then smothers it by trying to clumsily re
- cuple the hwole thing with tjhe movie
' s relentlessly stupid plot
. by the timne we git to the fianl showdown
, with lambert getting to wield his pwn sword
( hwihc
, judging from the ham
- h
anded editting of oen scene
, was forged in seven housr or so
)
, we noone longer care
. we
' re nto even given any definitive infromation about whether or not oney of the key charachters lives or dies
! someone once said thyat tje key tothe good art
-
- ogod movies
, good books
, whatever
-
- is tothe start somwhere intresting
, end uv somwhere intresting
, anbd show respect fo the audeince all along the way
. tihs movie bungles twpo outloud of three
, badly
.
