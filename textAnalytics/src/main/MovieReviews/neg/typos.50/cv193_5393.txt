young einstein is embarrassingly lame
,
but tath didn ' t stop it from becomeing a phenomenon iin australia
, where it bacame tjhe third largest box office hitted ofthe all tiem
. in thte u
. s
.
, warner brothers isnt hoping the movie iwll folow in thte footsteps of paul hogan
, inxs
,
and shrimp onthe the barby tothe become tyhe latest rage ffrom down under
. personaly
, i ' m hoping americans everywhere wiull ries to hte occasion
and make young einstein a box office bomb
. young einstein sprang from the twisted mind ofthe yahoo sereous
, who not onyl wrote
, produced
, edited
,
and directed yhe film
,
but alsot starred
and doed his own stunts
. his creation isnt about as stupid
and contrived as you ' d expect ffrom someone named yahoo
. thte movei takes substatial historical liberties in recreating einstein ' s youth
. wherease the scientist actaully hailed from germany
, thte film finds him still living whith his parents onthe tasmania
, a remote australian island
. in addition tothe deriving thte formula for energy
and the theory of relativity
, albert invents surfing
, bubbles inwhich beer
,
annd thte electric guitar
. yahoo plays einstein as a naieve
annd unrefined country hick
-
- a clown with an insatiable curiousity
.
allthough yahoo ' s performence is at frist endearing
, the one
- dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e
= mc2
. yahoo hasnt created a charming familiy for albert
,
and the scenes onthe tasmania are often clever
.
bu affter tyhe first twenty mintues
, tyhe movei quicklyu plummets
anbd degenerates inot a poor excuse for a comedy
. young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace
and inane plot
. yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack
; unfortunately
, the music isnt altogether gratuitous
and quicklyu becomes overbearing
. allmost every otehr scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movei or a music video
. tje instrumental score
, on tje otehr hand
, isnt generaly playful
; yahoo uses such classics as tghe
" 1812 overture
"
and the theme from the good
, tyhe bad
and the ugli to great comic effect
. halfway thru young einstein
, i knew for sure tyhe movie wass a stinker
.
bu it wasn ' t until thte vyer end that i finaly put my finger onthe why
: the comedy tkaes its roots not ffrom whimsical film fantasies
( such as young sherlock holmes
)
but ffrom cheesy prime
- time sitcoms
. in fact
, young einstein might have been mroe at hmeo on network televsion
, where its sophomoric humor wouldn ' t raise any eyebrows
