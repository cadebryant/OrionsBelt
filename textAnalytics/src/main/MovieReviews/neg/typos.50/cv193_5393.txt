young einstein is embarrassingly lame
,
but tht didn
' t stop it ffrom becomming a phenomenon inthe austrailia
, where it bcame hte thrid largst box office hit ofthe all tiome
. in tjhe u
. s
.
, warner brothers isnt hoping hte movei wiull followup in the footsteps ofthe paul hogan
, inxs
, anbd shrimp on the barby to become the latest rige from down under
. personally
, i
' m hoping americans everywhere wiull ries to tghe occasion annd make young einstein a box office bomb
. young einstein sprang fomr tje twisted mind ofthe yahoo sereous
, who nto only wrote
, produced
, edited
, annd directed thte film
,
but allso starred
and doed his own stunts
. his creation is baout as stupid adn contrived as you
' d expect fomr someone named yahoo
. the movei takes substancial historical liberties inthe recreating einstein
' s youth
. whereas tyhe scientist actually hailed ffrom germany
, the film finds him still living with his parents onthe tasmania
, a remote austrailian isl
and
. in addtion tothe deriving the forumla fo energy adn thge theory ofthe relativity
, albert invents surfing
, bubbles inwhich beer
, anbd the electric gitar
. yahoo plays einstein as a naive annd unrefined ocuntry hick
-
- a clown with an insatiable curiosity
.
al
thought yahoo
' s performence is at first endearing
, teh one
- dimentional characterization loses its novelty faster tahn ytou can say e
= mc2
. yahoo has creaeted a charming famaly fo albert
, annd tghe scenes onthe tasmania are oftenly clever
.
but after the frist twenty minutes
, teh movie quicklyu plummets anbd degenerates into a poore excuse forthe a comedy
. young einstein isnt hampered by its lethargic pace
and inane plot
. yahoo must be an mtv addict baceause his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack
; unfortunately
, yhe music is altogether gratuitous adn quicklyu becomes overbearing
. almost every otehr scene includes a blaring rock song thta leaves you wondering whether yuo are watching a movie or a music video
. thge intrumental csore
, on the other h
and
, isnt generaly playful
; yahoo uses such classics as the
" 1812 overture
" anbd hte theme from yhe ogod
, the bad adn the ugly tothe great comic effect
. halfway through young einstein
, i knew for sure hte movei was a stinker
. bu it wasn
' t until tghe very end taht i finaly put my finger on why
: hte comedy tkaes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies
( such as young sherlock holmes
) bu fomr cheesy prime
- tiem sitcoms
. in fatc
, young einstein might have been more at home onthe network televsion
, where its sophomoric humer wouldn
' t raise any eyebrows
