- chasing amy
, a slew ofthe love
- trinagle movies
: tihs month we have kissing a fool
, co
- starring amy
' s pwn lee
,
and april brings us thte object ofthe my affection
, whlch may as well be titled chasing allan
, forthe it is thte stroy ofthe a woman who falls in love with her gay roomate
.
( to be absolutely six degrees ofthe kevin bacon baout it
, that film stars schwimmer
' s freind jennifer aniston
.
) if only kevin smith could wriet them all
.
.
. schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max
, who falls inaddition lveo witht his best firend jay
( lee
)
' s book editor samantha
( avital
) a mere twenty
- four housr aftter meeting her
. they are soon engaged
, anbd max
, beacuse of his pwn raging libido
, grows suspicious ofthe samantha
' s fidelity
. he convinces jay tothe flirt with samantha durring the development ofthe his book
, to
" test her
"
. the trouble is
, jay might be secretly in love whith her
. to stretch htis flat
, sitcom premise tothe feature lenght
, the plot isnt framed by a climactic wedding
, at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale
-
- the events leading uv tothe the nuptials
-
- tothe an annoying fat man
and his silly girlfriend
. hunt has the best comic timing of anyone iin the film
; schwimmer cant spin bad dialogue inot mildly humorus dialogue
; anbd lee
, poor lee
, is miscast
. so hysterically funny inthe chasing amy
, here he is forced to repress his comic instincts
: tothe swear
, tothe yell
, tothe talk baout oral sex
.
.
. thge scirpt
' s diea ofthe a chracter trait is to stress that jay is a
" senstive man
"
,
and thn show him drinking pepto bismol wehn he
' s stewing over his girl trouble
. as fo avital
, an israeli actress
, she isnt warm
and sweet
, bu we don
' t nkwo anytying baout her character otehr than thast it takes her an incredibly long time to relize the most obvious things
. she also too closley resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer
, who plays schwimmer
' s assistant anbd peronal temptress
, turning taht particular subplot inot an unintentional riff onthe vertigo
. there are a h
andful
, a smattering
, of ogod scenes inaddition kissing a fool
. i enjoied a moent in a comedy club
, during which jay gets uv
and asks
" hasnt anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much ytou wanted tothe kill her
?
" over
and over util he
' s booted off stage
. there are allso a few obviously improvised lines tyhat are fresher tahn anything that
' s onthe the page
. kissing a fool isnt never as clever as the thursday night joke
- machine friends that spawned schwimmer
' s movei carrear
, so savve youself eight dollars anbd watch three episodes of that serieses back to bcak
.
