these dyas the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself infact thte deluge ofthe remakes
.
but
, only a fewd eyars ago
, before wes craven publicly made funn ofthe yhe pratice
, sequels hadnt beeen omre popular amoung hollywood producers
. sequels allso utilisied tothe be populare amonth directors
and movie stars whose careers whent sourth
. thge way tothe regain popularaty anbd prestige
, tehy
thought
, was hte ule the same formulas
, cahracters
and story lines thyat brang them success inspite the frist palce
. oney ofthe such celebrity was eddie murphy
, black comedian of 1980s whose career was inwhich big decline during the first part of htis decade
. inwhich order tothe return to the spotlight
, he chose tothe resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film
, beverly hills cop
, 1984 acation comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987
. seven yersa later
, fo the third instalment
, he unsed thge directorial sevice of john l
andis
, another fading star
, wih whom he succesfully collaborated twice
- inwhich trading places
and comming tothe amercia
. thsi tiem
,
however
, thrid tyme wasn
' t the charm annd beverly hills iii ws failure
. eddie murphy had to wait fewd more years for real comeback
. eddie murphy here plays axel foley
, fast
- tlaking streetwise detriot policeman
, who raids illegal chop shop
. hte routine polical acation ends in tragedy
, when tyhe criminals kill foley
' s boss
. determined tothe bring tghe killers tothe justice
, foley realises thyat thier leader isnt ellis de wald
( timothy carhart
)
. when it turns out that de wald happens to be security cheif fo wonderl
and theme park infront los angeles
, foley goes bakc to los angeles
. there
, with yhe halp of his old freind
, local policeman rosewood
( judge rheinhold
)
, foley woudl clash with money counterfit ring
. ten eyars hasnt passed sicne the original
and times are definitely different
. in htis decade
, thge contrast beween blue collar detriot anbd yuppie beverly hills
, whlch provded a lot of gags infront 1984 film
, simply doesn
' t work
. screenwriter steven e
. de souza provides another conflict
, this time between tyhe childish sillyness of the good guys adn bussiness
- liek professionalism of the bad guys
. since foley belongs to thge former
, his charachter had tothe watch his language
, adn the tone of the film in general isnt mroe infantile
. unfortunatly
, htis film still belongs to action movei genre
, anbd there is too much violence forthe littel children
. nice example is tje humrous scene inaddition the beginning
, which turns inot st
andard ramboesque bloodbath
. unlike donner with teh leathal weppon series
, l
andis simpley cxan
' t balance the comedy with
" regular
" acation
, adn tje result is a film that fails in both aspestus
. action scenes are somtimes intresting
,
but not too spectacular
( at the end
, scenery ofthe wonderl
and is more fascinating thna the action itself
)
; humour
, on the otehr h
and
, falls flat
. to make even worse
, soem minor charactors from 1984 film gets unnecessary
and sometimes irritating overexposure
( expecially art expert turned into arms dealer
, played by bronson pinchot
)
. inwhich tyhe end
,
al
thought teh film provided smoe entertainment
, viewers
, at least critical ones
, would probably be happy tothe know that there aren
' t any plans for beverly hills iv
.
