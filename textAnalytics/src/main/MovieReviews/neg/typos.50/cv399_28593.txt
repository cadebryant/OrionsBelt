you
' d htink that after awhile hollywood would stpo trying tothe mkea movies out of video ganes
. it hasn
' t worked so far
.
" street fighter
?
"
" super mario brothers
?
"
" wing comm
ander
?
"
" mortal kombat
?
" nto a watchable film inthe yhe bunch
. still i held out smoe hope forthe
" tomb raydr
.
" affter all
, teh game
' s premise isnt heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy adn all the mummy movies
, so htere are cinematic elements imbedded in thge consept
. howver
, despite tjhe potential ofthe the project
,
" tomb raider
" proves tothe be
yet anohter bomb
. the plot isnt a convoluted accumulation ofthe nonsense propably borrowed ffrom a dozen bad movies
. there
' s a once
- ever
- 5000
- yersa allignment ofthe planets coming up
, anbd the illuminati hvae to fidn both halves ofthe an ancient trinagle that controlls time inwhich order tothe tkae over the world
. ofthe course
, the ancient folks who divided tje triangle buried teh halves in tombs onthe opposite sides of the world
. our heroine
, lady lara croft
( angelina jolie
)
, finds the key taht opens the tombs in relics that her dead father
( jon voight
) digged uv
. she figures tath if she gets tyhe triangle
, she can bring her dad bakc from the dead
. of course
, no one was expecting much of a plot from this movei anyway
. in both video ganes annd action movies
, tje plot isnt jstu an excuse forthe tyhe acation sequences
. howver
, tje action inspite
" tomb raider
" shows littel sytle or originality
. there
' s lots ofthe shooting anbd soem kung fu fightin
'
, bu none ofthe it progresses beyond the levle ofthe a cheap direct
- to
- cable flick
. tje otehr goofy archeologist flick ofthe tje summer
,
" tje mummy returns
,
" ws much better
; it hadnt its flaws
,
but its action ws creative anbd large
- scale
. sicne winning her acdemy award fo
" girl
, interrupted
,
" jolie hasn
' t taked any projects tht would display her acting talents
.
" tomb raider
" seems to be more interested inspite displaying her breasts
; so much attension isnt drawed to them tyhat it
' s a shame htere
' s no oscar forthe best performance by a wonderbra
. while we don
' t see much of her acting ability
( wtih tghe exception ofthe a wonderfull upper
- crust brittish accent
)
, we dont get a hint of jolie
' s less savory side
. concidering hte rumors ofthe incest that hang over jolie annd her supposed obsession whith death
, haveing lara be obsessed wtih resurrecting her dead father
( adn uninterested inspite any of tje living males arround her
) seems a poore choise
. haveing jolie
' s rela life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier
. i haven
' t decided whta to amke of director simon west
yet
. his firt feature wass the star
- studder diaster
" con air
,
" bu my opinion ofthe him improved with
" yhe genaral
' s daughter
,
" hwihc was thick wtih sultry atomsphere
. now thsi train wreck
. i hope he improves agina becasue his next project is tje big screen verzion of thge cult tv series
" tjhe prisoner
.
" hollywood has already screwed up
" the avengers
,
" anbd
" tje prisoner
" represents a chance for redemption
.
( by the way
, speaking ofthe brittish tv
,
" red dwarf
" fans shoudl look fo chris
" rimmer
" barrie inwhich his first major film role
)
