i think we should
, as reponsible citizens
, all get together
and stop jim carrey fomr making another movie
. he
' s changing hte cinema as we nkwo it
-
-
and forthe hte worst
. i woudl willingly rewatch batman annd robin rather
then again sit through thsi miserable collection ofthe filmic moments
-
- prologues
, epilogues
, etc
. tghe premise
: a lawyer cant
' t lie for a day
. ho
, ho
. normally a movie made from thsi premise owudl be terrible
-
- mr
. carrey suceeds infront making it unwatchable
. i laughed once
-
- annd i ws laughing at the sight ofthe everyone alse laughing
. grinding doesn
' t begin tothe describe
. it pounds onthe your head so forcefully
and so unstoppably that
, if you are a normal person
, ytou leave feeling sick
. wehn it
' s nto trying tothe be funny
, it
' s trying tothe be melodramatic
-
- bu it
' s just annoying
, stupid
and sappy
. at best
. this movie is intended to make people laff
, yes
, nto to be voted best picture of all tiem by sighth adn soudn
.
but
, it fails onthe eveyr possable level
. it fails tothe be funny
. it fails to be insightful
. it fails to be suspensful
. it fails tothe be funn
. they shouldnt pay people to see it
. it suceeds on one levle
-
- it makes me want tothe git down onthe tjhe ground
and start thanking orson welles
, forthe having lieved
. if ytou go in whith the intention ofthe coming outloud alive
, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob
, fart
, pimple
and fat jokes
-
- otherwise you will go insane
. yes
, literally insane
. stark
, raving mad
. it is boring
, stupid
, melodramatic anbd in the end ugly
