-
- prologues
, epilogues
, etc

. it pounds onthe your head so forcefully
and so unstoppably that

. it fails to be funny
. it fails tothe be insightful
. it fails to be suspensful
. it fails to be fun
. tehy shouldnt pay people to see it
. it suceeds on one level
-
- it makse me want to get down on tghe ground
and strat thanking orson welles
, forthe haveing lieved
. if ytou go in whith teh intention ofthe coming outloud alive
