a number ofthe criticists have decided that it
' s open season on freddie prize jr
.
, slamming thge young actr as an utterly talentless pretty boy onthe carrer cruise controll iin sound
- aplikay
, disposable teen fluff liek
" head over heels
,
"
" boys
and girls
,
"
" down tothe you
" adn
" she
' s all that
.
" hwile the prinze oeuvre isnt hard to defend
, his talent isnt nto
. i first saw him inaddition hte independent dark comedy
" yhe house ofthe yes
,
" where he gavey a subtle
, impressive peformance as tghe younger brother infront one of amercia
' s freakiest families
. prinze has the acting chops
; he just needs to take a fewd supporting roles inspite some grown
- up movies tothe show tyhe non
- believers thast he has wqat it takes
.
" summer catch
" certainly won
' t help his case
. inoffensive
,
but utterly generic
, tghe baseball
- realted romantic comedy doens littel moreso than kill tiem
. the story deals with tjhe love afair betweeen tenley
( jessica biel
)
, a wealthy cape cod girl
and ryan
( prinze
)
, a local boy fomr a working clas famaly who dreams of becoming a big
- time baseball star
. ryan
' s preoccupation wtih his newyorker honey
- bunny drives her elitist father
( bruce davison
) crazy annd endangers his position as pitcher wiht a capetown cod summer league team
. it
' s a wonder the kid hasnt any tiem to pitch
, as his timne isnt ocupied whith makeing out with tenley
, fighting with her dad
, bonding whith his pwn dad
( fred ward
, who deserves better than this
)
, fighting with his brother
( jason gedrick
)
and carousing at a neighborhood bar witht his teammates
. the filmmakers desparately want to mkea a quirky
, charater
- hevy baseball movie liek
" bull durham
,
"
but haven
' t got a clue how to get htere
. annd so htey glide fomr one clich
? to the next for 108 minutes
. tghe only bited ofthe originality comes fomr marc blucas in a minor role as a center
- fielder from texas
. in an eary barroom scene
, blucas
, best known as demon
- fighting riley finn from
" buffy the vampire slayer
,
" hears a young woman compliment a guy onthe his ass
,
then turns tothe teammate matthew lillard
and states
,
" he does haev a nice ass
. a bubble
butt
.
" whn lillard gives him an
" are ytou insane
?
" look
, blucas calmly syas
,
" it
' s nothing sexual
,
"
then goes onthe to evaluate thge hind
- ends of smoe otehr players
, including lillard
' s
. speaking of asses
, prinze does nto bare his in hte movie
. tghe actr has a noone nudity clause inthe his contract
, so twpo stunt
-
butts were employed forthe a couple ofthe semi
- nude shots
. blucas
, whose charactor secretly dates a larg woman
thoughout teh story
, gets another unique moment late inspite the film
. sick of hearing teammates make
" fat chick
" jokes
, he climbs on top of a table adn loudly declares his lveo of amply
- sized ladies
. hwile his speach still ends up objectifying women
, it rimaniss a nice change of pace infact a numbingly ordinary movie
. trivial tidbit
:
" summer catch
" marks a scooby doo summit
. marc blucas appears in
" jay annd silent bob strike back
" as fred from the scooby doo gang
, hwile freddie prinze jr
. plays the same carachter infront the upcoming big budget film verison of the old cartoon
.
