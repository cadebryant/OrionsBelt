a number ofthe criticists ahev decided that it ' s ope season onthe freddie prize jr
.
, slamming thge young actor as an utterly talentless preety boy onthe career cruise control in sound
- alike
, disposable teen fluff like
" head over heels
,
"
" boys
and girls
,
"
" down tothe you
"
adn
" she ' s all that
.
" while thge prinze ouevre is hard to defend
, his talent is not
. i frist saw him in the inependent dark comedy
" thte hous of yes
,
" where he gavey a subtle
, impressive performence as the younger brother in oen ofthe america ' s freakiest families
. prinze has the acting chops
; he just needs tothe take a few supporting roles infact soem grown
- up movies tothe show thge non
- believers tht he hasnt wqat it tkaes
.
" summer catch
" certainly won ' t halp his case
. inoffensive
,
bu utterly generic
, tje baseball
- realted rumatic comedy does little mroe tahn kill time
. the story deals with thge loev affair between tenley
( jessica biel
)
, a wealthy capetown cod girl
adn ryan
( prinze
)
, a local boy ffrom a wokring clas famaly who dreasm ofthe becomeing a big
- tyme baseball star
. ryan ' s preoccupation with his newyorker hnoey
- bunny drives her elitist father
( bruce davison
) crazy
adn endangers his posistion as pitcher wiht a capetown cod summer leage team
. it ' s a wonder thge kid has any time tothe pitch
, as his timne is ocupied with mkaing outloud with tenley
, fighting with her dad
, bonding with his own dad
( fred wird
, who deserves better tahn tihs
)
, fighting with his brother
( jason gedrick
)
and carousing at a neigborhood bar with his teammates
. tje filmmakers desparately wanna tothe make a quirky
, character
- hevy baseball movie like
" bull durham
,
"
bu haven ' t got a clue how to git ther
.
annd so htey glide ffrom one clich
? tothe yhe next for 108 mintues
. the only bited ofthe originality comes ffrom marc blucas infront a minor role as a center
- fielder ffrom texas
. in an easly barroom scene
, blucas
, best known as demon
- fighting riley finn from
" buffy the vampire slayer
,
" hears a young woman compliment a guy onthe his ass
,
then turns tothe teamate matthew lillard
and states
,
" he does ahev a nice ass
. a bubble butt
.
" when lillard gives him an
" are ytou insane
?
" look
, blucas calmly says
,
" it ' s nothing sexual
,
"
hten goes on tothe evaluate the hind
- ends of some otehr players
, includng lillard ' s
. speaking ofthe asses
, prinze does nto bare his infact tjhe movei
. yhe ator hasnt a noone nudity clause in his contract
, so twpo stunt
- butts were employed forthe a couple ofthe semi
- nude shots
. blucas
, whose charachter secretly dates a large woman throughout the story
, gets another unique moment late inthe yhe film
. sick of hearing teammates mkae
" fat chick
" jokes
, he climbs onthe top of a table
anbd loudly declares his lvoe of amply
- sized ladies
. hwile his speek still ends uv objectifying women
, it rimaniss a nice change ofthe pace inwhich a numbingly ordinary movie
. trivial tidbit
:
" summer catch
" marks a scooby doo summit
. marc blucas appears inwhich
" jay
anbd silent bob strike back
" as fred ffrom teh scooby doo gang
, hwile freddie prinze jr
. plays the same charactor inthe hte upcoming big budget film verzion of tje old ctaroon
.
