yhe art of woo attempts to be one ofthe those films liuke breakfast at tiffany
' s in wich the audience isnt rooting forthe some sweet
, vulnerable
, irresistable woman to owrk out her problems
and tothe fidn happiness
. tyhe probelm is tath helen lee who writes anbd directs seems tothe have written alessa woo
( palyed by sook
- yin lee
) as niether sweet nor vulnerable
and she isnt quite resistable
. alessa is a young woman who happens tothe be a brillant art dealer in tyhe toronto art scene
. tihs is some sort ofthe alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thous
ands of dollars for paintings by talented begginers annd dealers inspite these paintings fly bcak anbd forth to places like switzerl
and
. one of the most knowlegeable of the art dealers is alessa
. she allso happens to be the center of adulation ofthe her firends
and every party has suitors camped outside her window
. next doorjam to alessa moves stuggling genuis artist
and native american ben crowchild
( adam beach
)
. he sees tyhat behind tghe facade thgat htere is really a sad little girl withing alessa who relaly iwll not be hapyp with tyhe rich art collector she isnt dating
. ben gets emotionally involved with alessa
.
( as alessa so delicately puts it
,
" we weere bosom buddies
, nowe we
' re fuck buddies
.
"
)
but alessa will have tothe deside whether she wants lveo wiht ben or wealth wih her rich suitor
. the rela problem with the film seems to be helen lee
' s inablility tothe decide waht she wants to be saying
. she undercuts nearly everyting she wants us to beleave about alessa
. alessa is looking forthe finacial security
but she makse descisions baout large sums of mone for her clients
. tihs appears tothe be a high profile
and well
- paid job
. we are suppossed to care about alessa
' s feelings
, bu she coldly refuses tothe visit her pwn ailing father
. alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet
and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint
. this isnt a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main charater
and comes uv double
- zero
. i rate it a 3 on tjhe 0 tothe 10 scale
and a
- 1 on tyhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
