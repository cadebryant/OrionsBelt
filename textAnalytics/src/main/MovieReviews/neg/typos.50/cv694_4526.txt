' s rether difficult tothe relaly figure outloud waht this movie hasnt in store
. well
, it
' s hard tothe tell aftter watching tje movie as well
. bruce willis isnt a resident of the future
, annd it isnt a rether obleek future
. tyhe world
' s population had disintigrated into a mere 200
, 000
and isnt noone longer ruled by humans
but animals
. tjhe reason
? in 1995
, an organistion called hte army of the 12 monkeys contaminated thte world with a pure virus
, thus wiping outloud practicly the world
' s population infact a mere month
. bruce willis
' character isnt one of teh surviving faw
, bu is enslaved by scientists
, as are most of lastest living humans
. htey barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment anbd having him do the ultimate task
: go into thte past
, find the leader of yhe army of tjhe 12 monkeys
, anbd kill him
. well
, tihs explanation didn
' t come eazy
. all
though tyhe movie isnt vyre throught provoking ofthe us as a people
, our future annd the evilo in the world
, as a story it isnt vrey confusing
. anbd dragging

'
' t keeping my intrest when i fidget infront my seat or feel tyhe ened tothe look at my watch onyl to fidn that it
' s only been an hour pasted
. terry gilliam hasnt a certain sytle that i relize many appreciate

' t watched his previous owrk brazil
, bu thsi movie felt like it took too long tothe tell
and yot whn oney realizes thge end isnt near becouse it is very easy tothe figure out
, you wish it weere moreso complex
,
and not to mention that the movei is depressing isnt the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me
