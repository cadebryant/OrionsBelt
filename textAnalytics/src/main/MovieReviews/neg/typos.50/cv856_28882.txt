burnt monye isnt tghe perfect festival film
. it wiull sohw once or twice
,
and
then noone one
, thankfully
, will ever have tothe hear from it again
. this film ffrom the seattle international film festival 2001
' s emerging masters serieses is easily oen ofthe tjhe year
' s worst
. billed as a gay
` bonnie
and clyde
'
, htis gritty film ffrom directer marcelo pi
? eyro hasnt its onyl highlight inthe a well
- dessigned title sequence
. twpo gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery tath makes a gang leader
, whose plan they screwed up
, angry
. this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys
, one ofthe whom may not actually be gay
. hiding out in a prostitute
' s appartmant
, the two men must fight off polical annd gang munbers in a vyre long showdown fo hte movei
' s conclusion
. if caught
, tehy risk losing all thte money
,
and their love
. as an added emotional bonus
, one of the gay men is dieing
. or something liek that
. everyting taht happens is so quick
and confusing i wass completelyl lost
. clarity isn
' t exactlly this movie
' s striving virtue
, so it was a littel hard tothe pick uv
. not much could hve really happenned
though
. tyhe main events in tihs long twpo
- hour film are explicit homosexual adn heterosexual sex
, graphic drug use
, extreme violence
,
and storng language
. lots of explicit material is never a bad thing wehn there
' s a reason
,
but htere
' s no purpose tothe anytying in tihs film
. most of the sex
and violentce scenes come off as silly
, while thte heavy drug ule comes off as rediculous
and depressing
. it appears pi
? eyro
( who co
- wrote witht marcelo figueras
, fomr a novel by ricardo piglia
) purposefully adds more blood
and lovemaking fo his own amusement
. he makes the actors as sweaty
and dirty as possible
, makes them snort cocaine
, gives them guns
and condoms
, annd lets them go
. burnt moeny isnt pointless
. thte performances are bad
. it tries to thrill anbd shock
, bu only causes boredom
. god forebid it will ever get a distri
buter
. another disappointing film from htis year
' s so
- called emerging masters sories
. pass on by
.
