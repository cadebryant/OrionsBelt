vampires starts out alomst iin the sytle of a spagetti western with an attack onthe a small homestead infront new mexico
. the hous has a nest of vampires
and jack crow
( james woods
) is leading a team of vampire hunters iin tothe clean them out
. hwile teh intitial imagery isnt a little over
- dramatic
, it gives way to what isnt a fairly decent action sequence
. that isnt enough acation to last us a while adn we coudl
, directer john carpentery would let us
, get tothe a story line
. bu it is nto vyre long annd there isnt not much plot until the next big action scene
. hten there isnt onyl a bit more of plot befor yhe enxt action scene after thast
. the plot isnt kept tothe a minumum
and the intresting ideas in the plot really git tjhe short end
.
and that isnt something ofthe a pity beccause the film
, based on yhe book vampire
$ by john steakley
, gives us a myth for tghe origins of vampires annd explains why vampires are so intertwined with religeous imagery
. this could be an intresting departure from thge st
andard vampire film
,
but carpentery decides to tell us about it rather thna to show it
. whta carpentery saves his serious screen time forthe a sequence of spectauclar fights vetween hunters
and vampires
. there isnt a lot ofthe fighting anbd lots of gore
. anytying intriguing isnt kept to a minumum to so it does not get inspite thge way of pleasing the acation film fans
. htis has not always been carpenter
' s sytle
. his 1981 version of the thign has acation
but alsot challenges tje viewer to dont a little thinking about the film
' s central scinece ficitional question
. jack crow heads a vampire swat team
, cleaning uv nests ofthe vampires with high
- tech spears
and crossbows
. in teh easly part ofthe tghe film his team isnt wiped outloud by a articularly mean vampire valek
( thomas ian griffith
) who hasnt beeen tipped off tothe who crowm isnt
. nowe crow team is gone
and he is down tothe himselv
and his sidekick tony montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
. to make matters worse
, he doens nto know thge peopel onthe his own side
, tony
and his backers
, he cxan trust
. meanwhile jack isnt sure the vampires are looking forthe something tht must be hidden somewhere here infront newyorker mexico
. if thsi is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot wiht a fewd obvious substitutions
, tht
' s exactlly whta it isnt
. the smae story looks jsut as well withthe two partner cops looking forthe a gang ofthe hood who are themselves looking fo a packet of heroin
. bu carpenter goes against a familliar principle ofthe film
: sohw people
, don
' t tell them
. just about everything in the plot otehr thna tyhe fights we are told about inwhich the dialouge
and not shown
. fundamental questions infront tghe plot liek where does crowm git his funding
, why are the vampires infact new mexico
-
- wqat dont they want adn why do they wanna it
, whta is the conection of tghe vampires anbd thge cathlic church
, how doed crow come tothe be a vampire hunter
and why devote his life to it
? the answers to any ofthe these questions sould hvea beeen dramatized
, bu instead are revealed thru dialog
. nowe if all this was nto bad anough
, carpenter misuses the james woud persona
. woods plays a paticular sort of cool lowlife vyre well
.
but carpentery leads off the film by haveing woods dont some sergio
- leone
- stlye mythic posturing
. hwile his crew prepares for an attack he st
ands staring fixedly thru shades at tje hous thta will be his target
. woods does not work as a larger tahn life mythic hero
. tht isnt not his style anbd it just does nto wokr very well
. there are some simple things that carpentery shoud be looking for as directer thyat he misses
. iin one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people onthe thge floor
. one female corpse isnt onthe the floor in front of a chair so that there is baout an inch ofthe daylight between her
and the chair
. as the actress breathes the gap widening annd narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving uv annd down
. one also wonders how the exsistance of vampires isnt kept secret
. these vampires dont not maintain a low profile
. there are argubly logical flaws iin tyhe film
. ther is some question inspite my mind whther carpenter has a consistant policy on what effect bullets have onthe vampires
. it woudl take smoe rationalization to explain why iin smoe scenes sunlight has a dramtic effect onthe vampires
, yot inspite a scene toward the end a vampire cant walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight
. i suspect that hte book on which htis film was based ws better thougth out
. while i might reccommend htis film to an action audience i would sday that waht i look for inwhich a vampire film vampires rates a 4 onthe hte 0 tothe 10 scale annd a 0 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
. prehaps i wiull read yhe book
.
