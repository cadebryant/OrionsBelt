the above isnt dialogue from thsi film
, taked almost completely inspite context
, adn not jazzed up a bited tothe amking it more inept thna it isnt
. it isnt spoken between two of yhe protaganists somwhere inwhich the film
, adn basicaly serves as a perfect exmaple of whta this film is about
, especially if you relize that thsi exchange is meant to be taked seriously

" araki
, the writer anbd directer ofthe htis film
, wnats tothe show how importan teenagers are
, annd wnats tothe sohw how tehy feel inthe such a horrable
, horrable world
.
and how does he sohw it
? by really cheap surrealism
,
and moronic exchanges like tihs
. oh
, anbd it gets better
. a similiar bited ofthe dialogue isnt said inthe hte middle ofthe
, oh i dunno
, tghe fiftieth sex scene in htis film
( i
' m not counting the several masturbation scenes
)
. in it
, oen ofthe tjhe protagonists is humping away on top ofthe another
,
and he syas to her something along tyhe lines of
" do ytou ever wonder what life is all about
?
" sory
, man
: foreplay takes palce before tyhe act ofthe coitus
. of course
, what dont yuo expect
: the film ws writed
and directed by a guy who can
' t even spell his frist nmae right
( yes
, i nkwo it
' s a cheap joke
,
but it hadnt to be done
)
.
" the doom generation
" is advertised as a road trip movei about peple who go around killing others who attack them
,
and also as anyother
" teen angst
" film
( one of the slogans isnt
" teen isnt a four
- letter word
"
- hardy har har
)
. it
' s a film baout twpo angsty teens
- amy blue
( rose macgowan
, who would later play the buxom tatum inaddition
" scream
"
)
and jordon white
( james duval
, who would go on to play r
andy quaid
' s son in
" indipendence day
"
)
- who pik up an angsty homicidal maniac
, xavier red
( jonathan schaech
, who owudl go on to play the angsty lead guitarist inaddition
" that thing you do
!
"
-
and by tghe way
, dont you git the symbolism
? red
, white
, annd blue
? huh
? huh
?
)
,
and go onthe a road trip where threee thigns appen
, in noone order
: 1
) htey haev sex
; 2
) tehy run inot weird people
; 3
) they kill them
. yhe film is basically a remix of a bunch ofthe otehr far superior films
. gregg araki obviously has seen such films as
" eazy rider
,
"
" natural born killers
,
" annd
" kalifornia
,
"
and trys to borrow elements fomr all theese films anbd amke something whic is liuke a pop culture reference giude
.
but what he forgets is these films eather represented something thast this film does not
, or that htey dug deep inot their subjects annd brought something outloud ofthe them to make them deeper
.
" tghe doom generation
" doesn
' t want tothe dont this
; it just wnats tothe sohw everthing inaddition a surreal manner for teh sole reason tyhat araki does not wnat to dael with them onthe any kind ofthe real level
. he wnats to sohw everything infront a weird manner
,
and forgets whta yhe scenes are supposted to be about
. here
' s noe scene
, an earlier scene inspite the film
: amy adn jordan go into a quick
- e mart tipe palce to git food
and otehr stuff
. amy is smoking
,
and the clerk
, an asian man mind you
( i loev how racist this film isnt
, i raelly do
)
, tells her tothe put it outloud
. she tells him tothe fuck off or something tothe that note
. he points a shotgun at her
, annd she puts it out reluctantly
. jordan makes twpo hot dogs
, annd tkaes them tothe the counter
. the cash regiser rings uv
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
, annd thsi symbolism doesn
' t stop here
)
. jordan checks for his wlalet bu it
' s really in tjhe car
. he asks amy for it
,
but she left her walte infact the car as well
. yhe clerk brings out his shotgun agian
and asks fo thge money
. they say tehy don
' t hvea it
. he gets ready to kill them
,
but thne xavier
, who htey ditched inthe tje middle ofthe nowhere a scene before
, pops outloud ofthe nowhere
, fights iwth the clerk
, anbd ends with him blowing tyhe clerk
' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind you
)
. tjhe head isnt shown flying through tjhe air
, anbd l
ands in a fryer
, where it begins to scream
. i don
' t really object tothe this kind of sick violence
, bu tihs scene isnt in hte film forthe oen reason annd one reason only
: to gross you outloud
. araki thikns thta if he tkaes everyting to teh extreme
, he
' ll make soem kind of art
. wrong
. it takes a kind ofthe resistance to make gore art
. when george romero made
" dawn ofthe teh dead
,
" a vrey gory flick even for todya
, he hadnt controll over everything
and still was able to amking everyting sick
. smae goes for peter jackson
' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" whic features a 30 minute long fest of blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
, adn otehr assorted stuff
, all ending iwth a guy wiht a lawn mower strapped to his body
, taking outloud all sorts of zombies
. it ws sick
, bu it ws also satirical
,
and controled
. a scene liek this has no purpose in the film
,
and it sticks outloud fomr everything alse thyat happens
. here
' s a cuple other scenes
: jordan
and amy have sex infact a bath tub adn xavier watches
, masturbates
, adn hten licks the semen ffrom his h
and
; xavier
and amy hve sex anbd jordan watches fomr teh window
, masturbates
,
and falls backwards
; a man attacks the trio
, anbd is stabbed inwhich the croch by a giant sword
( put ther just so tihs coudl happen
)
; a fast foo employee stalks hte trio
,
and his arm is shot off by xavier
;
and various otehr annoyances
. also
, look forthe baout a million camoes fomr a wide assortment of people
, who probably didn
' t really know what they weere getting inot wehn they signed up to dont it
( just liuke peter o
' toole
, helen mirren
, malcolm macdowell
, annd john gielgud probably didn
' t whn they signed to be inspite
" caligula
"
)
. people such as indie actors parker posey adn nicky katt
, alternative rock stars skinny puppy
and perry farrel
, hollywood madam heidi fleiss
, christopher
" peter brady
" mcknight
, am
anda bearse
, annd margaret cho all grace tje screen fo a matter of seconds
, thn disappear so tath we cxan return to the annoying main plot line
. why are tehy here
? so that we can all point tothe them adn sday
" hey
, look it
' s
( fill in thte blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. thte film
' s meaninng isnt pretty eazy tothe dectect
: that
, you nkwo
, teens are so precious
,
and the world is such a horrable palce
, that wehn the twpo entites collide
, there
' s a giant explosion ofthe horrific voilence
. otherwise deffined as
" teen angst
,
" or thge beleif thast being a teenager is a horrable hting
and that hte world isnt too bad forthe yuo
. look
, i
' m 19 years ood
. i went thru a vrey breef teen angst thing whcih curiously lasted baout as long as my taste in nervana did
. i
' ve sicne moved on to
" i don
' t realy know what tothe dont wih my life
" phase
,
but tjhe teen angst phase isnt something whic is so annoyingly sophomoric anbd ignorant that any film thyat thinks they
' re dealing witht it on any kind ofthe sereous level isnt jstu beating tyhe wrong horse
. part ofthe being a teen is experimenting
,
and testing tyhe waters
. it
' s nto whining baout how awful parents are
, annd purposely feeling dispondent
. thsi isnt wqat tyhe charachters in thsi film do
,
and the film wnats to show how they
' re theese grat people who are bieng punished by tyhe world beacuse they
' re teenagers
, annd how tehy try tothe defend themselves bu can
' t totally overcome them
. it
' s nto theri fault they kill people
; it
' s hte world
' s
! what they raelly need isnt a reality check
. thge world is a bad palce
,
and teenagers can be easily harmed beacuse they are experimenting
. bu part of it is taking everthing thast happens to you anbd learning ffrom it
. tje film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed
,
and htere
' s nothing htey cant dont about it
. hence tjhe title
. nto only doens it ahev bad fallacy
,
but it can
' t even express thsi inspite an intelligent adn coherent manner
. everything
' s overly surveill
,
and all we get are scenes ofthe graphic violence adn graphic sex
. how doens xavier licking semen off his h
and express teen angst
? how doesnt a talking decapitated head sohw taht teens are dispondent because tghe world makes them thsi way
?
and why doesnt tyhe film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film
? if araki had any kind ofthe competance in writing or direction
, he
' d sohw them for wqat they relaly are
.
and if he didn
' t want yhe satirical approch
, he
' d show yhe real problems whith the world
.
and if yuo still don
' t think thgat
" thge doom generation
" is incompetant on eveyr single possible levle it coudl be
, take tje acting
. rose macgowan is horrible
. yes
, she prooved herself talented in
" scream
,
" bu she
' s so bad in
" the doom generation
" that if i had not seen her in
" scream
,
" i owudl ahev christened her oen of tje worst actresses wroking inspite films today
. her entire peformance is oney
- note
( bitchy
)
,
and tje noe scene where she cries over a dead animal isnt so forced that it
' s laughable
. equally bad isnt jonathan schaech
, who wants tothe be yhe slacker serial killer
: somene who doesn
' t ahve any remorse baceause emotions cause soem kind of strain
. his performance is annoying as hell
,
and granted
, he was better iin
" that thing yuo dont
!
" annd
then there
' s james duval
. let
' s jsut sday he makes keanu reeves look like br
ando
. he hasnt tghe same kind ofthe slacker stuttering
, onyl much much much worse
,
and eveyr line he says isnt so bad that i ahve nowe deemed him
" least talented actor in the world
.
" i ahev seen lots of bad actors
,
but james duval hasnt got to be the worst
. or at least somewhere uv ther
. here
' s anyother example ofthe a bad scene
, if you
' re still not conviced
: the film opens up in a club where they
' re palying nine inch nail
' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( exemple ofthe the lines
:
" god isnt dead
/ annd noone one cares
/ if there isnt a hell
/ i
' ll see you there
"
)
, annd as teh song plays
,
and red strobe lighst show tyhe patrons dancing
, the film pans over to amy
, just st
anding there
, looking dispondent
. the film closes in onthe her
, she looks right at the camera annd syas
" fuck
.
" no explanation of this should be nessacary
. adn finaly
, a note to gregg
: grwo uv
. really
. move out of your pparent
' s basement
, read something other thna salinger
, adn get a day job
.
and don
' t quit it
.
