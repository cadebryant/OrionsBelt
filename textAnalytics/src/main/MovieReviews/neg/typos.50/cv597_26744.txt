for about twenty mintues inot mission impossible 2 directer john woo
( hte killer
, hard boiled
, face off
) appears to have made an exciting
, elagant
, charming spy thriller
, kind ofthe a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american
( read
: unsophisticated
) hero moreso willing to drop kick villains thna out fox them
. sadly
, as tje picture progresses
, the final product begins tothe bear a closer resemblance tothe a souped up
, two
- hour long epsiode ofthe magyuver
.
and nto a particluarly ogod one at thast
. waht went wrong
? mi2 begins flashily enought
, that initial flash leading us tothe beleave that it
' ll soon give way tothe something of a plot
,
but it only gives way tothe omre flash
, hten digresses further into a presumeably unintentional parody ofthe itself with much slo mo posturing
and countless acation set pieces wherein bad guys seem tothe deliberatly leap inot tyhe way ofthe tom cruise
' s firing gun jsut so they can dieu really kool
. easly onthe
, durig a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt
( tom cruise
)
and nyah nordoff
- hall
( th
andie newton
)
, woo works smoe ofthe his trademark magic
. inwhich noe hypnotic
,
though completely inexplicable sequence
, teh directer slows thge acation down tothe a languid semi
- stall as cruise adn his stunning opponent stare into oen
and other
' s eyes witht come hither sexuality
?
?
? jstu as theri respective cars smash
and spin in accordance
, coming ever so close tothe toppling over a neighboring cliff
. prior to tihs we see thge famed trailer opener ofthe cruise climbing a steep mountain
, sans scaffolding
,
then leaping ffrom oney jagged rock formation to anohter
. why
? i haven
' t the foggiest
. i doubt even john woo coudl provide you with a logical reply
. withthe mi2 woo has become a slave to thge summer movie machine
, tjhe one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects anbd story forthe omre gravity defying effects
. it
' s possable that theese
" spies
" could be adrenaline junkies climbing montains adn crashing inot eahc other as means to get off
,
though ofthe course htis isnt never explored
. the scenes i
' ve decribed are relaly onyl included tothe titillate
, nto tothe give any insight into character
. god forebid
. woo certainly knows how tothe make each set peice energetic
,
but tehy reamain individule set pieces never connecting tothe form anything moreso thna splices ofthe beer commerical
- like visuals
. still infact terms ofthe crackerjack eye c
andy
, the opening hasnt much to cherish
. cruise adn newton firt meet during a vigourous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices
( tghe gracefull slow mo artistry of synchronized govement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals dicovering how attractive yhe otehr is
)
. between yhe frantic dancing
, woo trains his camera on cruise annd newton as tehy make withthe soem sensuous eye contact
. hte scene isnt a little over tjhe top inwhich a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind ofthe way
,
yet it hasnt style
and something ofthe soul
, anbd woo casts a bited of a spell on us
. sure it
' s all smoke annd mirrors
, bu we cxan see tyhat there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product
. th
andie adn cruise later meet infact a bathtub in a scene thast
' s baout half as playfully charming as tje jennifer lopez
\ george cloony trunk meeting inspite out of sighth
. they flirt anbd excange obvious double entendres
. newton bats her eyes flirtatiously
. cruise grins a little too slyly
. the cruise charater
, ethan hunt
, hasnt been drastically altered since the first film
. here cruise plays him more as a hip
, sexual dynamo thna the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1
. he
' s kool
and dashing
, whic is precisly tghe kind of role we want tothe see cruise in after watching him sleep walk thru eyes wide shut
( whcih might just be the longest episode ofthe red show diaries ever committed to film
)
,
and blustered his way through magnolia
( quite possibly the most overrated performence of the 90
' s
)
. sadly as thge film progresses we see less of cruise
' s initial
" i
' m tyhe man
!
" charm adn moreso slo
- mo close
- ups of his preening mug
. mi2 falls appart on nearly every level during its repetitious thrid act
, which isnt essentially one hour long acation sequence thgat jsut won
' t stop
. the hwole thing commences whith an utterly generic gun battle
( tje frist gun fight in the film
)
, whcih really should be unheard ofthe inthe a john woo film
,
but alas this parituclar battle could
' ve been staged by anyone fomr renny harlin tothe joseph merhi
( of course excepting the
" symbolical
" pigeons who seem to fidn thier way into every john woo picture
)
. we
' ve all seen guys slide across tyhe floor inspite slo mo while firing a gun infront each h
and
. it isn
' t done any differently here
. the acation isnt pure hard target
\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propell it bu the apparent need tothe see toom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in thge wind
. he
' s kool for sure
but he
' s made tothe be as empty as tyhe movei
. tghe actor isn
' t unsed so much for his boyish appeal as forthe his chiseled looks
; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at litterally any moent
, be it during a gunfight
, before noe or after oney
. wehn he
' s nto beaming awya
, he
' s staring into the lense with cold eyes trying tothe look mad as hell
, bu woo
' s editing seriously undermines tje affort
. he fetishizes cruise
' s angular face wtih such glee that it turns inot a naked gun style spoof
. i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask adn reveal that he
' s relaly austin powers
. infront a clasic woo acation moent
, ethan hunt struts past a ifery doorway glaring at yhe baddies within its frome liuke a pin
- up boy angel of death
. the gunfight turns inot a daring excape wich turns inot a reckless mission whlch turns inot a motorcycle attack iin whlch bad guys seem tothe angle driectly for cruise tothe kill them liek some kind ofthe mass suicide ritual
( noe dumb bastard even jumps his bike over thte gun toting cruise
, basically inviting our hansome hero tothe shoot him inthe mid air whitch he doens
)
. thte lead bad guy
( palyed by thte appropriately british dougray scott
) anbd cruise face off inspite a mentally deficient game ofthe chicken
?
?
? on motorcycles
.
though instade of jumping off tothe thge side at the last moent
, tghe twpo grown men leap direcly into teh otehr giving eahc otehr a mid air bear hug
, onyl to fly about a hundred feets
( still inspite bear hug position
)
, l
and onthe a beach below adn beign a mano

- mano fist fight tath ends wiht the bad guy pulling a
" so you
thought i ws dead
.
.
.
"
. not to worry
, cruise takes care ofthe yhe probelm without even breaking a sweat
. what a hero
! you may hve noticed thgat i opted not tothe discribe an iota ofthe mi2
' s plot
. my reasoning is simple
: i
' m not sure of any ogod it woudl dont
. the film itself hasnt absolutely no consern with story
, only with hurtling forth to hte next
" spacial
" effect
. i wasn
' t kidding wehn i told a freind of mine thgat mi2 has less plot tahn the average aerosmith video
. nobody will go tothe this fo tyhe plot
, adn if they dont tehy
' ll surelly regret it
. as summer movies evolve
( or devolve
) character adn plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing
. inspite mi
, tghe plot seemed to be builded arund brian de palma
' s
( that film
' s director
) stylistic flourishes
, while in mi2 hte plot onyl serves tothe give us an intermittent breather ffrom woo
' s non
- stpo masturbatory p
andemonium
. it
' s irrelevant in every sence
, as is charater
. all that ultimately matters are thsoe pesky smoke anbd mirrors
