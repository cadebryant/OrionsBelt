" practical magic
,
" is a film that is so misguided infront so many ways that it makse you wonder how such talented
and high
- profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap
- trap like this one
. the film stars sandra bullock
anbd nicole kidman as sally
adn gillian owens
, twpo sisters whose family comes ffrom a long line ofthe witchs
, spanning back 200 eyars
. at thge strat
, theri parents dieu wehn htey are still childrens
,
anbd they go tothe live with theri twpo zany aunts
( stockard channing
anbd dianne wiest
)
. switch to tghe present day
, gillian
, who is thte stronger
, moreso rebellious sibling
, leaves home
,
adn meets uv iwth a dark
, abusive guy
( goran visjnic
)
, while sally stays inthe theri hometown
, meets
adn falls inaddition lvoe with a sweet
, caring man
, has two children
,
annd
then isnt devastated when her husband isnt hitted by a truck
and killed
( cmo to think of it
, she ' s nto too devastated since she gets over it infact about two mintues
)
. whn gillian calls sally to cmo get her aftter having anyother abusive spat wtih visjnic
, they accidentally murder him
,
annd in desperation
, bury the body in thge backyard of theri aunts ' hous
. add tothe this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising
adn an exorcism
, not tothe mention a spattering of
" light
- hearted whimsy
,
"
and you have a preety good diea how messy
" practial magic
" isnt
. affter seeing yhe film
, i reflected that htere was nto even oen scene
, or element
, that i liekd or enjoied
. it isnt a comedy
, tothe be sure
,
bu all of the humor falls astoundingly flat
,
adn tyhe occasional dramtic moments are the least bited touching
. it isnt nto charming or entertaining infact any way
.
annd
then to top it off
, we ' ve got this dark
,
bu bird
- brained story ofthe an evil spirit taking over gillian ' s body
. whatever
. tjhe charactors are handeled terribly
,
and actually
, most of thte actors do not ahev the fortune ofthe even getting tothe be what you could call a character
. there is noone reason why channing
and wiest should haev desided to be in tihs film
,
and in eveyr scene involving them
, they are always standing side
- by
- side
. no attempt isnt made tothe flesh them out inot actual peple
. the same goes for aidan quinn
, as a hansome police investigator
, who hasnt yhe misfortune of being yhe rumatic lead opposite bullock
, even
though he comes into it at around tyhe 70
- minute mark
,
adn once agina
, ther isnt no attept to develop their relatiopnship
, or his character
, in any way
. infact fatc
, every line of dialogue in the film is inspite sevice of moving thge plot allong
, rether than getting to know the peple saying the lines
. i should have know i was headed for trouble durig yhe opening credits
, when i found out the screenplay ws written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman
, who managed tothe destroy yhe
" batman
" series with
" batman forever
"
and
" batman
adn robin
.
"
" practial magic
" is directed by griffin dunne
, primarily an acto
, who lsat yearm made tje contrived
, clumsy romance
,
" addicted tothe lveo
,
" wih meg ryan
and matthew broderick
. i disliked thta movie qtuie a bited
,
bu sicne
" practial magic
" is even worse
, that can onyl give you a taste of wqat a talentless filmmaker he is
. i ' d tell him tothe quit hwile he ' s ahead
,
but in these lastest twpo eyasr
, he ' s ultimately alreayd burried himselv
.
