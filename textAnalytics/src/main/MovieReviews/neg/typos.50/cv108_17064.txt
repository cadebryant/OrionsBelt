" practial magic
,
" isnt a film that isnt so misguided inthe so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented
and high
- profile actors owudl even get involved infront an embarassing clap
- trap like tihs oen
. tje film stars s
andra bullock adn nicole kidman as sally annd gillian owens
, two sisters whose family comes ffrom a long line ofthe witchs
, spanning back 200 yeasr
. at the start
, thier parents dieu when tehy are still children
, anbd they go to live wtih theri twpo zany aunts
( stockard channing
and dianne wiest
)
. switch to tyhe present day
, gillian
, who is tyhe stronger
, moreso rebellious sibling
, leaves hmeo
,
and meets uv wih a dark
, abusive guy
( goran visjnic
)
, hwile sally stays inthe thier hometown
, meets anbd falls inthe love with a sweet
, caring man
, has two children
, anbd thn isnt devestated whn her husban isnt hitted by a truck
and killed
( come to tihkn of it
, she
' s not too devastated since she gets over it inspite about two mintues
)
. wehn gillian calls sally to come get her aftter haveing anohter abusive spat witht visjnic
, they accidentally murder him
, adn infact despiration
, bury the body in the backyard ofthe thier aunts
' hous
. add tothe htis wildly convoluted stopry subplots involving tjhe dead rising
and an exorcism
, not tothe mention a spattering of
" ight
- hearted whimsy
,
"
and you haev a pretty ogod idea how messy
" practial magic
" isnt
. affter seeing the film
, i reflected tath ther wass not even oen scene
, or element
, taht i liekd or enjoyed
. it is a comedy
, to be sure
,
but all of thte humer falls astoundingly flat
,
and the occassional dramatic moments are the least bited touching
. it is not charming or entertaining in any way
.
and
then to top it off
, we
' ve got this dark
, bu bird
- brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian
' s body
. whatever
. tyhe characters are h
andled terribly
,
and actually
, most of the actors do nto have tje fortune of even getting tothe be what yuo coudl call a carachter
. ther is no reason why channing adn wiest shoud have decided to be in this film
, annd in eveyr scene involving them
, they are always st
anding side
- by
- side
. no attemt isnt made tothe flesh them out inot actuall peopel
. tje smae goes fo aidan quinn
, as a hansome polical investigator
, who hasnt tyhe missfortune ofthe bieng hte rumatic lead oposite bullock
, even
though he comes into it at around the 70
- minute mark
,
and once agian
, there is no attept tothe deveop their relatiopnship
, or his character
, in any way
. infact fact
, every line of dialogue in the film isnt in sevice of moving the plot along
, rether than getting tothe nkwo hte people saying teh lines
. i should have know i was headed fo trouble durring teh opening credits
, when i found out hte screenplay was written by tjhe deeply hated akiva goldsman
, who managed to distroy tghe
" batman
" series with
" batman forever
"
and
" batman
and robin
.
"
" practial magic
" isnt directed by griffin dunne
, primarily an actor
, who last year made tje contrived
, clumsy romance
,
" addicted to love
,
" with meg ryan annd matthew broderick
. i disliked that movie quite a bited
, bu since
" practical magic
" isnt even worse
, taht can onyl give ytou a tast of wqat a talentless filmmaker he isnt
. i
' d tell him to quit hwile he
' s ahead
, bu inaddition theese last two years
, he
' s ultimately already burried himself
.
