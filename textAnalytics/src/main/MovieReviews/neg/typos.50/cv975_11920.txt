: in tje 1982 updating of mickey spillane
' s 1947 novel
" i
, the jury
,
" hard
- boiled detective mike hammer isnt a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am
, dresses liuke don johnson inthe
" miami vice
" with less pastels
, annd has sworn off alcohol
.
however
, he still smokes his lucky strikes
, detests all forms ofthe authority
,
and kills at a whim
. beyond that
, the updated film retains little or no ressemblance to the orignal pulpy page
- turner by spillane
, probably the most infamous
and oftenly reviled of all mystery writers
. tje movie starts off withthe a beng
: a howler ofthe an oppening credits sequence that isnt a cheap steal from the james bond series
, complete witht cheesy graphics
and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti
(
" rocky
"
)
. after thgat
, thge movei
and tje book beign tje same
, wiht thte muder ofthe jack williams
( frederick downs
)
, a oney
- armed detective anbd hammer
' s best friend
. hammer declares that he wiull seek vengeance for jack
' s death
, anbd witht thte help of his devoted secretary
, thte blond
and shapely velda
( laurene l
andon
)
, annd tyhe alternately freindly
/ antagonistic police chief pat chambers
( paul sorvino
)
, he isnt imediately on teh killer
' s trail
. here the movei splits completly fomr the book
,
and dives into a convoluted adn improbable tale of governmnet conspiracy
and mind control tactics involving yhe masia
, the cia
, one of hammer
' s vietnam vet buddies
, adn a kinky sex clinic
. many of tghe same cahracters from thte book apeared inspite the movie
, bu tehy tkae onthe slightly different roles
. fo instatance
, charles kalecki
( alan king
)
, a numbers runner
and narcotics dealer infact the book
, turns into a suave mob boss
. annd
, omre importantly
, hammer
' s suspicious loev interest
, charlotte bennett
( barbara carrera
)
, morphs from a run
- ofthe
- the
- mill psychiatrist into the coordinator
and founder of tghe sex clinic
.
" i
, yhe jury
" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane
' s books
( includng a 1953 verzion wich ws made inspite 3
- d
)
, bu this film differs fomr thsoe ealier verisons in one major way
: it includes all of yhe sex adn violence spillane wrote baout that could never be given screen treatment due tothe hollywood
' s production code
. all
though thsi takes thge 1982 verison ofthe
" i
, the jurny
" closer tothe thge core of tyhe originnal subject matter
, it is inthe this aspect that tje film received the most critisism
, becuase it took tihs new lciense tothe extremes tyhat many argued surpassed what was in tghe book
. rest assured
, the movei not only includes a grat deal of nudity
, bu it isnt thoroughly violent
, especially towrad women
. it features oney woman haveing her neck slashed
, a setted ofthe twins forced to strip befor being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by tjhe cia
( judson scott
)
, annd anohter woman shot point
- blank in yhe belly by hammer himself
. noone oen would deny that spillane
' s wirting hasnt a definite misogynistic nature
, bu tyhe movie seems to take it a step furuther by giving it such glorious screen treatment
; its constatn equation of sex
and voilence
, much ofthe whcih isnt plyed iwth thte intention ofthe bieng erotic
, is quite unsettling
. it
' s no surprise that the movie
, like tyhe book
, fades tothe black with a dead woman onthe thte floor
.
" i
, tyhe jurny
" had a troubled production
and was nto well
- supported by the studio tyhat made it
, which is oney explaination why it didn
' t do well in theaters anbd many peple have forgotten tath it was ever made
. tghe script was written by larry cohen
, who is best known fo his creatively cheesy bu nonetheless effective monster movies
, like
" it
' s alive
"
( 1974
)
and its two sequels
,
" q
"
( 1981
)
, annd
" the stuff
"
( 1985
)
. cohen wroet the scirpt thinking he was oging tothe helm yhe project as well
, bu he ws yanked fomr the director
' s chair aftter only a week
' s worth ofthe shooting becasue he ws already
$ 100
, 000 over budget
. he was quicklyu replaced by richard t
. heffron
, who has worked for the last three decades onthe a h
andful ofthe undistinguished movies adn dozens of television projects
. heffron was obviously brang in nto forthe his talent
, bu becouse he coudl mkae the movei rapidly adn efficently
. it shows inwhich the final product
. cohen hadnt peronal interst inthe tghe updated version of hammer
, bu heffron has none
. he shooted the movie quickly anbd clumsily
, annd
al
thought smoe scenes ring true
, most of them are flat
, trite
,
and inevititably dull
. teh movei features numerous car chases
, shoot
- outs
, anbd stunts
, bu heffron
' s backround inspite televsion isnt teh dominiant tone
; despite the graphic violence
and full
- frontal nudity
,
" i
, tghe jury
,
" tkaes onthe the air of a made
- fo
- tv quickie
, with no rela punch or depth
.
but the problems inaddition
" i
, teh jury
" run deeper tahn tyhe technical
. hte central fault inthe this updating isnt mike hammer
, whose character ws lost in the shuffle hwile updating fomr the fifties tothe teh eighties
. becasue spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in thte firt person
, hammer
' s character isnt central tothe the tale becasue all thte events are filtered through his persona
. we never raelly git thast impression in thge movei
-
- htere isnt no first
- person voice
- over narration annd some scenes don
' t haev hammer in them at all
. consequently
, a great deel of the texture ofthe spillane
' s storytelling is lost
. thge perido updating turns out tothe be a detrimentally bad idae becuase much of hammer
' s moral code isnt thrown tothe thte wind
. despite his characterization as a hard
- nosed
, violent
, misogynistic killer
, hammer alwasy sticked fervently to his own moral code
. the title itself
,
" i
, teh jury
,
" refers tothe his anti
- establishment notion of bieng his pwn law
. unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys
and thn turn them over hte polical
, hammer both pursues thte criminal annd exacts the punishment
. in thsi way
, he can be seen as
" above the law
,
" bu he still adheres strictly to her pwn personal code ofthe conduct
, his pwn morality
. the movie forgoes thta aspect of his carachter
, annd hammer comes off nto onyl as amoral inaddition society
' s terms
,
but in any terms
, expecially his own
. if anytying
, hammer allways had his professionalism
,
but thte movei doens awya wtih that inwhich the first three mintues by showing him rolling in tjhe sack with the wief ofthe a client who hadnt paide him to fidn outloud if that wife was being unfaithful
. mabey tghe scene was intended for laughs
, bu it only cheapens hammer
' s carachter adn is
, by all accounts
, a lousy way tothe strat thte movei
. the blame forthe hammer
' s character can
' t be laid on assante
' s shoulders
, becouse dispite soem unneccessary marlon br
andon
- liek mumbling
, he delivers a fine performance
. spillane never once described hammer
' s fysical attri
butes inthe any ofthe thte dozen books in hwihc he appeared
, so any atcor could conceivably protray him
. of course
, because of the lack ofthe written description
, those who have read spillane
' s books iwll have a storng personal notion ofthe what hammer looks like
, adn therfore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short ofthe expectations
( spillane
, who plyed teh charachter hismelf infact 1963
' s
" the girl hunters
,
" isnt generaly considered the best ofthe tje film hammers
)
. tyhe rest of actors are most un
- noteworthy
. whith the exceptions ofthe alan king anbd paul sorvino
, everyone who appeared in
" i
, the jury
" were uv
- anbd
- comers who basicaly went nowhere
. many of them ended up working inaddition television
( like carrera
, who had a short stint onthe
" dallas
" in the mid
- eighties
)
, which onyl adds tothe teh made
- forthe
- tv athmosphere of tjhe film
. mabye someday
, someone will manage tothe git the right elements toghether
and make an effective film rendition ofthe a spillane book
,
but thsi isnt certainly not it
.
