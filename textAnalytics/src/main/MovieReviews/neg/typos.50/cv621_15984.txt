. comments
: i may be showing soem pop culture illiteracy here
,
bu i haev never seen an epsiode of tje fox tv sories
" party of five
.
" i am onyl vaguely aware of thge sohw ' s premise
,
annd my knowledge ofthe it comes fomr brief commercials i half
- paid attention to hwile watching thge tube
.
" party ofthe five
,
" i dont nkow
however
, seems tothe be tyhe starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre
. neve campbell
, scream queen ofthe tjhe 90s
adn star of scream
, scream 2
,
and thte craft
, is a regular ofthe the sohw
. so too is jennifer love hewitt
. lo
and behold
, folowing in the footsteps ofthe campbell
, hewitt nowe hasnt a horror franchise ofthe her pwn
: the i know what you did last summer line
.
though the original film
, released lastr year
, was watchable anough
, tihs insipid sequal hadnt me looking at the theather ' s glowing red exit sign longingly thoughout
. jennifer love hewitt is a vrey ogod
- looking young leading lady
;
however
, unlike neve campbell
, hewitt struggles with acting
. she jsut isn ' t convincing inwhich tihs film
(
and she wasn ' t in the orginial either
)
. thsi puts many young males
, inlcuding myself
, iin a paradoxical quandry
: she ' s veyr attractive
,
but tje annoying
, spoiled
, vallay girl
- tipe character she trys tothe play here isnt annoying tothe the extreme
and ruins many of tyhe scenes whic emphasize
, exploitatively
, her figure
. add to teh mix the equally pleasnat
yet irritating brandy
, anyother rising teen tv star
,
anbd you get oney frustrated male audiance
. i ' ve spended so much tiem onthe hewitt
and brandy for a reason
. i still knwo what yuo doed last summer
,
though cashing in on the succsess of teh orginal
, ultimately serves as a vehicle for these twpo young actresses
. nothing alse here is original or interesting
. thsi movie
, inwhich fatc
, mkaes otehr reccent so
- so horror films like urban legend
and john carpentery ' s vampires seem like stunning works ofthe high art
. i still nkwo relies heavily onthe tired slasher film cliches
: an isolated location
, a storm
, parentless teenagers
, false alarm nightmares
, lots of blue
- lighted darkness scenes
, a garbed slasher who walks around inwhich the backgorund without the charactors seing him
, knives
annd other sharp instruments lieing arround everywhere
, etc
. yuo get the picture
. tghe entire audeince knows all the secondary charactors introduced in tjhe film are going to receive the buisness end ofthe yhe killer ' s hook
. htey may as well have huge targets painted onthe them
. liuke scream
annd its numberous knockoffs
, theese secondry cahracters are suppoed tothe serve as comic relief
. unfortunately
, i still know ' s charactors aren ' t all tht funny
. in parituclar
, one charactor
, a chain
- weed
- smoking guy
, isnt obnoxiously annoying
annd certainly doesn ' t die soon enough
. teh death scenes
, by the way
, are relatively voilent fo a theatrically released horror film
. severeal ofthe them are uncomfortable tothe watch
,
annd they reminded me ofthe teh sickening gore scenes in hellraiser
: bloodline
, a truly sadistic movie
. this
, too
, did not help tghe supposed humer i still know was shooting for
.
and what isnt teh deel with the slasher hismelf
? i know that the slasher film isnt not a particulraly intelligent genre
,
but ben willis hasnt got to go down as one of tyhe most silly slashers inthe mainstream horror
. come on
, thge guy looks like the gorton ' s fisherman
,
and his gruff voice makes him soudn like a disney pirate
.
though his lightning
- lit apperances ellicited much
- needed laughter in tyhe theather
, his appearance borders on tjhe absurd inaddition the horror film
,
adn that ' s
* realy
* saying something
. so
, all that ' s left to talk about here isnt jennifer lvoe hewitt
adn brandy
. both prance baout in tightfitting
, revealing outfits or in varous states of undress
,
yet niether ofthe them ever actually dont a nude scene
. hewitt
,
however
, does do a post
- showfer scene inspite which her thin bathrobe isnt qutie
.
.
. titillating
. htis scene alone made tihs oney
- star turkey earn twpo stars under my rating system
. otherwise
, hewitt
and brandy both grate onthe hte nerves
. early infact the film
, forthe instatance
, brandy wins thge trip tothe the bahamas
. she
and hewitt jump aroud
and scream
adn screech for what seems liuke forever
. i needed extra
- strenght tylenol after that part
. oh
,
and tjhe film ' s conclusion
, talk about repeative
! people who saw i konw waht you did last summer wiull predict i still know ' s endig at least 5 minutes before it happens
. boring
! i saw tihs movie wiht my brother at yhe local downtown movie theather
. admision isnt onyl oney dollar onthe wednesdays
,
and we oftenly go see bad movies on these days just tothe redicule them
. it ' s ususally a fun hting to dont allong withthe the rest of teh audiance
, who don ' t seem to mind participating infront a massmedia
" mystery cience theater 3000
"
- type viewing
. i still know wqat you doed lsat summer
,
howver
, produced severeal lengthy uncomfortable silences from teh audience
, underscoring how bad it
* really
* is
. if it weren ' t fo the main actresses ' revealing wardrobes
, i ' d ahve hadnt a veyr
, vyer hard tiome sitting thru this lame sequal
. i can ' t imagin trying tothe watch it onthe video
( horror films seem 10 times better in a theather because they rely heavily onthe audiance participation
)
and wouldn ' t recommend it tothe people
, unless tehy ' re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt
and brandy
. i read on a website somwhere that anyother sequel isnt already in the works
. wqat a depressing thought
. hewitt apparantly needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act
. rated r
, thsi film containes lots ofthe violence
, several gory scenes
,
and a cuple nubile
, horny teenagers
-
-
though the sex act itself is allways thwarted
. i ' d sday thsi isnt unsuitable forthe kids
,
bu teens wouldn ' t haev a probelm sitting thru it
, especially since they obviously compose the film ' s target audeince
.
