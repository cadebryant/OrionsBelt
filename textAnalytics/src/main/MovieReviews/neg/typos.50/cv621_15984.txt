' ve walked into a trap set by teh rainslickered slasher whith a huge hook forthe a h
and
. comments
: i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here
,
but i ahve never seen an episode of thge fox tv series
" party of five
.
" i am onyl vaguely aware of teh show
' s premise
,
and my noledge ofthe it comes ffrom brief commercials i half
- payed attension to hwile watching the tube
.
" party of five
,
" i do know
however
, seems to be the starting ground for actresses inwhich tje teen horror genre
. neve campbell
, scream queen of hte 90s
and star ofthe scream
, scream 2
,
and yhe craft
, isnt a regluar of the show
. so too is jennifer love hewitt
. lo
and behold
, follwoing inspite the footsteps ofthe campbell
, hewitt nowe has a horror franchise of her own
: the i know wqat you did last summer line
.
though hte original film
, released lastr year
, was watchable enought
, this insipid sequel hadnt me looking at tje theater
' s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout
. jennifer loev hewitt isnt a very good
- looking young leading lady
; howver
, unlike neve campbell
, hewitt struggles with acting
. she jsut isn
' t convincing inwhich thsi film
( annd she wasn
' t in the original either
)
. this puts many young malless
, including myself
, in a paradoxical qu
andary
: she
' s veyr attractive
, bu tyhe annoying
, spoiled
, valley girl
- tipe character she trys to play here isnt annoying tothe the extreme
and ruins many ofthe yhe scenes which empahsize
, exploitatively
, her figure
. add to the mix hte equally pleasant yot irritating br
andy
, another rising teen tv star
, annd yuo get noe frustrated male audeince
. i
' ve spended so much tiome on hewitt
and br
andy forthe a reason
. i still konw wqat yuo did lastr summer
,
though cashing infront on the sucess ofthe the original
, ultimately serves as a vehicle fo theese twpo young actresses
. nothing alse here is origonal or intresting
. tihs movei
, infront fatc
, makes other receet so
- so horror films like urban legend
and john carpentery
' s vampires seem like stunning works ofthe high art
. i still konw relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches
: an isolated location
, a storm
, parentless teenagers
, false alarm nightmares
, lots of blue
- lighted darkness scenes
, a garbed slasher who walks around in the background wihtout yhe charachters seing him
, knives
and otehr sharp instruments lieing arround everywhere
, etc
. ytou git the picture
. thte entire audience konws all the secondry characters introduced in the film are oging tothe recieve tjhe busness end of the killer
' s hook
. htey may as well have huge targets painted on them
. liuke scream adn its numberous knockoffs
, theese secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief
. unfortunatly
, i still knwo
' s characters aren
' t all tyhat funny
. inthe particular
, noe charcter
, a chain
- weed
- smoking guy
, isnt obnoxiously annoying adn certainly doesn
' t dieu soon enough
. the death scenes
, by the way
, are relatively voilent for a theatrically released horror film
. sevral of them are uncomfortable to watch
, adn they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser
: bloodline
, a truely sadistic movie
. htis
, too
, did not halp the supposed humer i still know was shooting for
.
and whta isnt the dael wih the slasher hismelf
? i know that the slasher film is not a particularly inteligent genre
,
but ben willis hasnt got tothe go down as one ofthe the most silly slashers in mainstream horror
. cmo on
, hte guy looks like thte gorton
' s fisherman
, annd his gruff voice mkaes him soudn liuke a disney pirate
.
though his lightnign
- lit apperances ellicited much
- needed laughter in the theather
, his appearance borders onthe the absurd inwhich tghe horror film
,
and that
' s
* realy
* saying something
. so
, all that
' s left to talk baout here is jennifer love hewitt adn br
andy
. both prance about in tightfitting
, revealing outfits or inwhich varios states ofthe undress
, yot neither of them ever actually do a nude scene
. hewitt
,
however
, does do a post
- showfer scene in whlch her thin bathrobe is quite
.
.
. titillating
. tihs scene alone made this oney
- star turkey earn twpo stars under my rating system
. otherwise
, hewitt anbd br
andy both grate on thge nerves
. easly in the film
, for instance
, br
andy wins thte trip to the bahamas
. she anbd hewitt jump around anbd scream
and screech fo waht seems liuke forever
. i needed extra
- strength tylenol affter that part
. oh
, anbd yhe film
' s conclusion
, talk baout repetitive
! peple who saw i know waht yuo did lastr summer will predict i still nkow
' s ending at least 5 minutes befoer it happens
. boring
! i saw tihs movie with my brother at hte local downtown movei theather
. admision isnt onyl noe dollar onthe wednesdays
, adn we oftenly go see bad movies onthe theese dyas jsut to redicule them
. it
' s usually a fun hting tothe dont along witht the rest of teh audience
, who don
' t seem to mind participating inthe a massmedia
" mistery sciene theather 3000
"
- type viewing
. i still know what ytou doed last summer
, howver
, produced sevral lenghty uncomfortable silences from yhe audience
, underscoring how bad it
* really
* is
. if it weren
' t for the main actresses
' revealing wardrobes
, i
' d have had a very
, vyre hard time sitting through htis lame sequal
. i cxan
' t imagine trying to watch it on video
( horror films seem 10 times better in a theather because they rely heavily on audiance participation
)
and wouldn
' t reccomend it to peopel
, unless they
' re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt
and br
andy
. i read on a website somwhere thgat anyother sequal isnt already iin the works
. whta a depressing
thought
. hewitt apparantly needs tothe spend moreso time on tv figuring outloud how tothe ect
. rated r
, thsi film countains lots of voilence
, several gory scenes
,
and a couple nubile
, horny teenagers
-
-
though tje sex act itself isnt always thwarted
. i
' d sday tihs is unsuitable forthe kids
,
but teens wouldn
' t have a problem sitting thru it
, expecially sicne tehy obviously compose teh film
' s target audience
.
