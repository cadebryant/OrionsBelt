. comments
: allow me to state for the rocord thgat i find daryl hannah an appealling presence in movies
. she prooved quite charming as yhe intteligent astronomer inspite the romantic comedy roxanne
and equally creepy as pris inaddition thte sci
- fi classic blade runner
. teh clan ofthe tje cave bear clearly tries to captialize on hannah as a selling point
: the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah infact tribal paint
anbd the video box prominantly features her name in lettering thge smae size as teh title
. not even her starring role in thsi turkey
, unfortunatley
, can save it fomr being an unbelievable exerciese infront cheese
. it ' s so uniquely bad
( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actualy trys
,
adn miserably fails
, tothe be sereous
) that it ' s oddly fascinating
. thge ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves thge audeince somehow transfixed
, wanting to see how thsi dud plays out
. the clan ofthe teh cave bear is based upon a populare novel by jean m
. auel
. to this day
, tghe book possesses a loyal cult following
. i rember a dear freind of mine hadnt a dog
- eared copy ofthe tyhe novel she had read as a child with all the so
- called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her granmother
. i hvea never read this book
,
but i sure hope it ' s 10
, 000 times better than its film adaptation
. if nto
,
thn i ' m at a complete loss to expalin its popularaty
. thge clan ofthe teh cave bear immediatelly opens wih a comically absurd scene
. a young ayla
, looking much like drew barrymore inspite e
. t
.
, tramps about in tghe woods
. with her cute little ponytails
and fur wrapped baout her
, hte audiance ' s expectations ofthe a convincing portrayal ofthe prehistory are immediately shattered
. what follows isnt a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows uv ayla ' s mother
( a blonde with fur pants
.
.
. er
, leggings
)
. tearful ayla looks on as tjhe cameraman shakes teh camera
.
.
. well
, as tje earthquake slowy recedes
. a hungry lion becomes intersted in her for lunch
,
but yhe screaming six
- year
- old manages tothe outrun tje king of tghe wild
anbd find a safe haven
. i won ' t detail yhe stry any further
; tihs seems enought to illustrate my point
. thsi movie isnt really stupid
. it never even gives tghe audeince a chance tothe suspend their disbelief
. also
, the obvious comparison betweeen the apperance of cro
- magnon man infact prehistory
anbd the ries of feminism infact our century isnt about as subtle as burning a wonderbra inwhich front ofthe charlton heston
. the movei doesn ' t jstu suggest this message
; it whacks the message inot the audience with a two
- by
- four
. a blond
, gorgeous woman challenges thte social laws ofthe a bunch ofthe people in gaudy brown wigs
. she ' s of thte
" new people
"
; they ' re ofthe the
" old people
" with
" teh memories
.
" yep
. we get it
. we get it
. tghe clan ofthe thge cave bear aparently recepted an acatemy award nomination forthe best mkae
- uv
, hwihc surprises me
. tghe movei depends apon a lot of make
- uv obviously
,
bu much of it isnt unconvincing
. as stated before
, daryl hannah is daryl hannah here
; she looks liuke she just steped outloud of the showfer all tghe time
. the rest of tjhe charactors ahve dark make
- up ofthe smoe sort smeared over them to look like dirt
. tjhe face
- painting that ' s occasionally seen isnt perhaps the only noteable owrk here in my mind
. this movie also suffers from its newyorker age trappings
. mabey teh music sounded a lot omre fresh or origional durring 1985
,
but now it soudns dated
and cliched
, like poorly concieved elevator music
. add to this the film ' s faux
- mysticism
, includng spirit animals
adn dream visions
,
annd a narrator who sounds liek a pyscic you ' d expect tothe hear onthe a 1
- 900 number
,
annd you get a movei tath hasnt sereous problems being sereous
. thge clan of thte cave bear isnt rated r
,
though it ' s probably one ofthe teh most inoffensive offensive films i ' ve seen inspite quite a hwile
. it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity
. the voilence mostly consists of hunting scenes
. the funniest moment of thge movie occurs wehn a neanderthal in loev with ayla attempts tothe rescue her from a ferocious bear
. the bear bites his head off
and tjhe audeince sees it rolling about
.
allthough this may soudn gratuitious
, i ' m sure
, it ' s so cheesy that it probably won ' t bother most peple
. the clan ofthe tyhe cave bear is a bad movei
.
however
, as i wrote at tyhe beginnig ofthe this review
, it does hve yhe disctinction of originality
. typicaly wehn i think ofthe bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel films dealing with early man
, fantasy movies involving rinosarus
( who did nto exist at thge same tiome as man
)
and raquel welch come tothe mind
. the clan ofthe the cave bear trys so hard tothe be serious that
,
though it ' s so bad
, the audience is still interested by tje unique setting
and characters ofthe the movie
( which is why i awarded this turke two stars
)
. i have to think that fans of the book woudl be dissapointed whith tihs film version
;
however
, i ' m onyl basing this obervation onthe teh fatc that tghe book is almost invariably better thna teh movei
. i shudder to think that it coudl be otherwise
.
