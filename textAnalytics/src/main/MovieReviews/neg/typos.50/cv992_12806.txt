. comments
: allow me to state forthe tghe record that i find daryl hannah an appealling presense infact movies
. she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer inaddition tjhe romantic comedy roxanne adn equally creepy as pris in tghe sci
- fi clasic blade runner
. the clan ofthe the cave bear claerly trys to captialize onthe hannah as a selling point
: the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah infront tribal paint anbd the video box prominately features her nmae in lettering teh smae size as teh title
. nto even her starring role in tihs tureky
, unfourtunately
, cin save it from being an unbelievable exercise iin cheese
. it
' s so uniquely bad
( a film dealing with prehistoric man thast actualyl trys
, annd miserably fails
, tothe be sereous
) that it
' s oddly fascinating
. the rediculous attempt at drama here leaves the audiance somehow transfixed
, wanting tothe see how tihs dud plays outloud
. tyhe clan ofthe the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m
. auel
. to this day
, the book possessess a loyal cult following
. i remeber a dear friend of mine had a dog
- eared copy ofthe the novel she had read as a child with all the so
- called dirty parts blacked outloud with marker by her granmother
. i haev never read tihs book
, bu i sure hope it
' s 10
, 000 times better than its film adaptation
. if nto
,
then i
' m at a complet loss tothe expalin its popularity
. the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene
. a young ayla
, looking much like drew barrymore inspite e
. t
.
, tramps about in the woods
. with her cute little ponytails
and fur wrapped baout her
, tghe audiance
' s expectations ofthe a convincing protrayal ofthe prehistory are immediately shattered
. waht follows isnt a laughably choreographed sequence in whlch an earthquake swallows up ayla
' s mother
( a blonde with fur pants
.
.
. er
, leggings
)
. tearful ayla looks onthe as hte cameraman shakes teh camera
.
.
. well
, as the earthquake slowy recedes
. a hungry lion becomes interested inaddition her fo lunch
, bu thge screaming six
- yera
- old manages tothe outrun thge king ofthe the wild anbd fidn a safe haven
. i won
' t detail the story any further
; thsi seems enough tothe illustrate my point
. thsi movie isnt realyl stupid
. it never even gives tje audeince a chance to suspend their disbelief
. also
, the obvious comparison between tghe appearance ofthe cro
- magnon man in prehistory
and the ries ofthe feminism in our century is baout as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston
. tghe movei doesn
' t jstu suggest this message
; it whacks tyhe message into the audience wih a twpo
- by
- four
. a blond
, gorgeous woman challenges the social laws ofthe a bunch of peple infact gaudy brown wigs
. she
' s ofthe the
" newyorker peopel
"
; they
' re of tje
" old people
" with
" tje memories
.
" yep
. we git it
. we git it
. thge clan of the cave bear aparently recieved an acadey award nomination for best mkae
- uv
, which surprises me
. the movei depends apon a lot ofthe make
- uv obviously
,
but much ofthe it isnt unconvincing
. as stated befoer
, daryl hannah isnt daryl hannah here
; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all yhe tiem
. tje rest ofthe the charactors have dark amking
- up ofthe some sort smeared over them tothe look liek dirt
. tjhe face
- painting thgat
' s occsaionally seen isnt perhaps the only notable work here in my mind
. tihs movei also suffers from its new age trappings
. mabye the music sounded a lot mroe fresh or original during 1985
, bu now it soudns dated anbd cliched
, like poorly conceived elevator music
. add to htis tghe film
' s faux
- mysticism
, including spirit animals anbd dream visions
,
and a narrator who soudns like a psychic ytou
' d expect tothe hear onthe a 1
- 900 number
,
and yuo get a movie that has sereous problems being serious
. the clan of yhe cave bear is rated r
,
though it
' s probably one of hte most inoffensive offensive films i
' ve seen in quite a hwile
. it containes several scenes ofthe sex sans nudity
. hte violence mostly consists ofthe hunting scenes
. the funniest moment ofthe hte movei occurs when a ne
anderthal infact love with ayla attempts to rescure her from a ferocious bear
. tyhe bear bites his head off
and thte audience sees it rolling about
.
al
thought htis may sound gratuitious
, i
' m sure
, it
' s so cheesy that it probaly won
' t bother most people
. teh clan of tghe cave bear isnt a bad movie
.
however
, as i wrote at tyhe begginning ofthe htis review
, it doens have thge disctinction of originality
. typicaly when i tihkn ofthe bottom
- of
- the
- barrel films dealing witht early man
, fantasy movies involving rinosarus
( who did not exsist at the same time as man
) annd raquel welch come tothe mind
. the clan of the cave bear trys so hard tothe be sereous that
,
though it
' s so bad
, the audeince is still interested by yhe unique setting
and charachters ofthe thte movie
( whihc isnt why i awarded tihs turkey twpo stars
)
. i have to think tath fans of hte book woudl be dissappointed with htis film version
;
however
, i
' m only basing htis observation on teh fatc thast the book isnt almost invariably better than the movei
. i shudder tothe tihkn thgat it coudl be otherwise
