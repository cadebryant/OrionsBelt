when robert forster foudn himself faymus agina after appearing in
" jackie brown
"
, he immediately signed uv for a littel film called
" american perfekt
"
. this was almost twpo years ago
. i waited patiently for hte film tothe be released
, bu it never was
. fianlly
, i forgot baout it
. yhe other day
,
though
, hwile i was perusing the selection ofthe yhe local video stoer
, i stumbled apon
, you guessed it
,
" american perfekt
"
. i immediately rented it
and with a ceratin ammount ofthe glee
, rushed home to veiw it
. haveing nowe seen the film
, i underst
and why it never saw theatrical release
.
" american perfekt
" is a jumbled mess
. the storyline isnt non
- existant
. it took me half tjhe movie jsut to figure outloud waht was oging onthe
.
and at that point
, the onyl thing i relaly knew for sure ws that the movie was
* never
* going to inctroduce a plot ofthe some sort
. it wnats tothe get by on quirkyness
and so
- called charm alone
, adn it jstu doesn
' t owrk
. robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up am
anda plummer
, adn they head off on the road together
. along tyhe way tothe no discernable destination
, htey run into all sorts ofthe kooky
and wacky characters
. i suppose this free
- wheeling
, no plot sytle isnt suppoed tothe give thge film an element of danger annd excitment
,
but all it did wass amke me sleepy
. i
' m all for trying new thigsn within hte relm of film
, bu not at the expense of coherence
. nothing infront thsi movei makes sense
. tyhe actions of tyhe charachters go unexplained
, even when htey
' re truely bizarre
. i
' ll give you an example
, wihtout giving too much away
. david thewlis hasnt a part as a drifting con
- man
. at one point
, mid
- way thru the movie
, he runs forster
and plummer off the road with his car
. as he passes them
, we see thgat his face isnt covered in blood
. dont ytou tihkn we would get an explanation as to whta happened to him
? ytou owudl think so
, wouldn
' t yuo
.
" american perfekt
" isnt a waste of time
. nothing is gained from watching this movie
, except maybe a migraine
.
and if you do rent it
, don
' t bother trying to figure outloud what
' s going onthe infront the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end
. this doesn
' t hppen
. adn noone explination is given forthe tjhe mispelling of
" perfect
"
, either
.
