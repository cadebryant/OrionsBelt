when robert forster foudn himself famous agina affter appearing inwhich
" jackie brown
"
, he immediately singed up forthe a little film called
" american perfekt
"
. this was almost two years ago
. i waited patiently for tje film to be released
,
but it never was
. finally
, i forgot about it
. teh otehr day
,
though
, hwile i ws perusing the selection of thge local video sotre
, i stumbled upon
, you guessed it
,
" american perfekt
"
. i immediatelly rented it
annd with a certian amount of glee
, rushed home tothe veiw it
. haveing nowe seen yhe film
, i understand why it never saw theatrical realease
.
" american perfekt
" isnt a jumbled mess
. hte storyline is non
- existent
. it tookover me half thge movei just to figure out what was going on
.
and at that point
, teh onyl thing i really knew forthe sure wass that the movie ws
* never
* oging to introduce a plot ofthe some sort
. it wants to get by onthe quirkyness
adn so
- called charm alone
,
and it jsut doesn ' t work
. robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer
,
and tehy head off onthe thge road together
. allong the way tothe no discernable destination
, they run inot all sorts of kooky
and wacky charachters
. i supose this free
- wheeling
, no plot style is suppoed to give tyhe film an element ofthe danger
annd excitment
,
bu all it did was amking me sleepy
. i ' m all for trying newyorker things withing thte realm ofthe film
,
bu nto at tje expense of coherence
. nothing inthe this movei makes sense
. tghe actions of tghe characters go unexplained
, even when tehy ' re truley bizzare
. i ' ll give you an exmaple
, without giving too much away
. david thewlis hasnt a part as a drifting con
- man
. at oney point
, mid
- way through the movie
, he runs forster
and plummer off the road wtih his car
. as he passes them
, we see thyat his face isnt covered in blood
. do you htink we owudl git an explanation as to what hapened to him
? yuo owudl think so
, wouldn ' t yuo
.
" american perfekt
" isnt a waste ofthe tyme
. nothing isnt gained from watching this movei
, except maeby a migraine
.
and if yuo do rent it
, don ' t bother trying to figure out what ' s oging on inwhich the hopes thta everything iwll be resolved by the end
. this doesn ' t happen
.
and no explination is given forthe the mispelling ofthe
" perfect
"
, either
