thyat isnt
, unless ytou
' re one of thsoe people who hve seen the preview a thous
and times on tv or inwhich the theaters
. i cxan tell ytou one thing now
: htey gave yhe entire movei away
. why someone would want tothe base an entire movie on oney premise annd thn give tyhat crucial detail away inthe the trailers isnt beyond me
. howver
, if tehy
* hadn
' t
* given it awya
, the film owudl
' ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject marter
. obviously
, teh producers thougth they sould remake
" teh deepo end of the ocean
,
" throw in tommy lee jones
and a cuple of cliches anbd call it an action drama
.
" doulbe jeopardy
" offers solid acting from ashley judd
and tommy lee jones
, who got firt billing even
though he didn
' t see tothe be onthe screen half as much as judd did
. it also offers some genuinely funny
, clever
, or full
- of
- tension moments
( my favorite
: judd waking uv in thte coffin
)
,
but none ofthe that cin salvage the film from its insanely predicatble plot
. half hte tyme i
' m wondering whther i
' m watching noe ofthe those overhyped tv miniseries
, which always turn outloud to be less exicting than advertised
. judging by thge beggining
, end
,
and a huge chunk ofthe yhe middle
, i might hvea beeen watching a spacial hallmark presentation too
. the movie
' s stretching for an almost twpo hour long film with only 30 minutes worth ofthe material
. implausible material
, no less
. loose interpretation ofthe noe of the amendments aside
, too many times iin teh movei i thougth
,
" that isnt
* not
* possibile
*
.
" that kind ofthe stuff is excusable inthe popcorn movies
,
but nto one liek
" double jeapardy
" thast tries tothe pass itself off as serious drama
. everything seems dragged outloud
, overplayed
. when tehy shoudl
' ve kept us inwhich teh dark
, they let tjhe cat out ofthe teh bag too early
.
