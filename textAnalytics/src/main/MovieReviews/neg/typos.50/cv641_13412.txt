' t forget to reccomend a film

, or send me some ofthe taht nasty hate mail
.
) starring bruce willis
, billy bob thornton
, liv tyler
, ben affleck writen by jonathan hensleigh adn j
. j
. abrams directed by michael bay it rocks
- actaully
, lots ofthe rocks fli at us or ffrom us
, in slow or fast motion
, at several points inwhich hte film
. tehy seem liek dangerous rocks beacuse they kind of twirl through the air instade of jstu propeling foward
, anbd wehn they l
and
- once in a hwile
, wehn we need a break fomr teh spoace sequences
- they cause dammage enough to destory tjhe chrysler building
and tyhe like
.
( nary a mention of theese apocalyptic events is made aftter tehy occur
.
) they alsot jstu might be teh most intresting element of aramgeddon
, a steroid user
' s answer to deep inpact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oel
- driller comisioned by the white hous
and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oel driller
? tehy recquire somene experianced with deep
- core mining tothe plant a nuclear missile inot said asteroid
.
( in oen unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry tothe inspect a deepo
- core driller they built based on his own blueprints
; it isnt poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almsot every aspect of it
. we trust nasa tothe build spoace shuttles that can l
and onthe twirling asteroids
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch ofthe
" cowboys
"
, inlcuding a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a balck guy
, a wiseass
, adn the man who isnt sleeping with his daughter
( affleck
)
. once they triarch space
, we experience sequence affter sequence ofthe something goign wrong
- perhaps the fatc tyhat they sent a bunch of nincompoops inot outer spoace hasnt something to do with it
; i cannnot count the number ofthe times tehy almost fail the mission onthe all my fingers adn toes
. whther or not tehy save tyhe day
, i will nto reveal
. nor will ytou care
. i iwll sday this
: yuo know yuo
' re inwhich trouble when deepo impact dwarfs your asteroid movei in terms of emotion adn scope
. willis hasnt bearly a chance tothe come alive
; ditto for affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third ect
, infact a last minute
- annd futile
- attemt to inject warmth into thte material
. steve buscemi
' s charcter
- tyhe wiseass
- is exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he
' s called
, isnt sarcastic adn foolish
, so they tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most ofthe thge film
. so why did tehy bring him up there tothe begin wtih
? rather
, why wriet him into the film
?
- give his allmost
- witty one
- liners to sereous willis
, who scowls anbd mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendancies
: at oney point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daugter
, firing oftenly
and causing significant damage to his oil rig
. i
' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel
, at least in my world where tghe sky is blue
. liv tyler is preety
and humourless
, as allways
; suspiciously
, four ofthe her father
' s b
and
' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace thge sountrack
. director michael bay lays yhe visual annd soudn effects onthe thick
, liuke ketchup
, eventually drowning the movie onthe
- screen
.
( tyhe middle hour isnt a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault on the averege primate
' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in this movei
, a crew memeber inevitably yells outloud
" we lost
( insert dead person
' s last name here
)
!
" i must admit that not once sould i distinguish a dead oel
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live one
,
and close
- ups of the corpses
' faces beneath cracked helmets provided littel assisstance
, as their skin ws often covered inwhich fake blood
. armageddon is nto as terrable movei as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it hasnt a vivid soundmix
. bu at allmost twpo
-
and
- a
- half ohurs
, i could not believe how littel acually happend over tje course ofthe thge story
. tyhe love stoy has beeen played up in the ads
, perhaps hoping to catch peple before htey recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers in tghe film are miles apart througout
- erase all
thoughts ofthe nude sketching or car
- sex annd replace them with obligatory shots ofthe liv tyler tearing up hwile ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. remember a littel film called jaws
? inaddition tihs film
, threee independent
- minded men suddenly found themselves onthe a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark
. tehy didn
' t much liuke each otehr at firt
; eventually
, tehy started tothe respect oen anyother
. one of jaws
' graet scenes involved tje owudl
- be
- ahabs drinking anbd singing songs annd telling stoires
. this is the sort ofthe male
- bonding foreign tothe bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters inot thge mix annd expect we
' ll care baout them onthe yhe grounds that hte world isnt baout tothe end
. not once dont we get hte feeling that theese characters are even acquiantences
- i
' d be surprised if these actors bothered tothe introduce themselves tothe one another befor
" acation
" ws called
. a male friend who loved the film suggested tothe me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch ofthe men who don
' t bare thier souls
, who belivee inspite dieing macho concepts liuke heroism annd a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. tothe this
, i will respond that hte boys inwhich armageddon are niether heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn
' t build a birdhouse
.
and if i git noone respect for disliking a movie withthe all the synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movei written by a team ofthe body
- builders
and greeting kard authors
- i
' ve never beeen a prouder wimp my whole life
