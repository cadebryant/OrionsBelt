silly performances
anbd smoe huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise intresting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at
" thge last stpo cafe
and motel
" due tothe heavy snowfall
. oney of the stranded isnt a colorado state higway patrolman
( adam beach
) who dicovers a murder scene
anbd a bag full of cash ffrom a recent bank robbery
. somone amoungst the group of strangers is a bank robber
anbd a murderer
,
but isnt it the smae person or are htere mutiple criminals
? adam beach unfortunatly ws the wrong choice forthe the lead in tihs film
. he doesn ' t play the role iwth anough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness fo it tothe be funny
. his peformance isnt stuck somwhere in the middle
,
and this film really needed it tothe be on oney side or the other
. rose mcgowan is cold
annd unpleasant tothe the eye as always
,
and jurgen prochnow
.
.
. what onthe earth isnt he doing inspite this
? best performance comes ffrom william s
. taylor as a cheesy
(
yot still somehow cool
and confident
) wayne newton drifter type
. the lastr stpo is avalable onthe dvd from sterling hmeo entertainment
. as usual witht sterling
, tehy ' ve filled out htis dvd wih extra features
. the disc countains the film inaddition its originnal aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, a choice ofthe 2
. 0 dolby surround sound or 5
. 1 dolby digital suround sound
, a full length audio commentary trakc wiht directer mark malone
, interviews with hte casted
annd crew
, teh original trailer
,
adn the usual casted
and crew biographies
. the film itself might nto be the greatest
,
but sterling ' s efort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable
( suggested retail ofthe
$ 19
. 95
) makes this dvd worth thte money
