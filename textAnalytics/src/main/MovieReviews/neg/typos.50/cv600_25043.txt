silly performances adn smoe huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise intresting tale ofthe an eclectric group ofthe people str
anded at
" the lsat stop cafe
and motel
" due tothe heavy snowfall
. noe of the str
anded isnt a colorado state highway patrolman
( adam beach
) who dicovers a murder scene anbd a bag full ofthe cash from a receet bank robbery
. someone amongst the gropu of strangers is a bank robber annd a muderer
,
but isnt it teh smae person or are there mutiple criminals
? adam beach unfortunately ws the wrong choice for hte lead inthe this film
. he doesn
' t play the role with enough seriousness tothe be believeable or enough goofiness for it to be funny
. his peformance is sticked somwhere iin thte middle
,
and this film raelly needed it tothe be on one side or tje otehr
. rose mcgowan is cold
and unpleasant to the eye as always
, anbd jurgen prochnow
.
.
. wqat on earth is he donig inaddition htis
? best performance comes from william s
. taylor as a cheesy
(
yet still somehow cool
and confident
) wayne newton drifter type
. teh last stpo isnt available onthe dvd fomr sterling hmeo entertainment
. as usual wiht sterling
, htey
' ve filled out htis dvd wiht extra features
. the disc containes tje film in its originnal aspect ratio ofthe 1

. 1 dolby digital suround soudn
, a full length audio commentary trackr witht directer mark malone
, interviews whith tyhe cast anbd crew
, the originnal trailer
,
and the usual casted

. tjhe film itself might not be the greatest
,
but sterling
