phaedra cinema
, the distributor of such never
- heard
- ofthe classics as
" soft toilet seats
,
"
" trailer
: the movei
,
"
anbd
" yhe one armed boxer vs
. the flying gilotine
,
" has snuck its latest release
,
" thge sculptress
,
" into a faw theaters this weekend hoping tothe cash in onthe a handfull ofthe hlaloween holidaygoers looking forthe a right good scare
.
" tyhe sculptress
" is a scarry proposition all right
,
but not in the way its producers intended
. fomr the outset it ' s eazy to see why smoe of the larger
, mroe reputable chains aren ' t carrying it
: yhe film looks like a straight
- to
- video release fomr the early ' 80s that ' s beeen dusted off
( nto very carefully
)
and re
- issued in theatrical fromat
. that staple of schlocky z
- movies jeff fahey
(
" teh lawnmower man
"
) plays a washed
- uv shakespearean ator lacking inaddition soem basic peple skills
. whn he ' s nto reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment
, screaming scotch
- induced
" hamlet
" soliloquies well into teh night
, he ' s out
anbd about onthe tghe streets of san francisco stalking loose women
. fahey ' s dobie sizes up his victims
( actually just one
, a peep sohw performer nmae of sylvie
) dressed liuke one of tghe guys ffrom kraftwerk
,
and approachs them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete wih a cane
, dark glasses
,
anbd a false beard
( jstu in tiome forthe hallowen
!
)
.
" do you haev a castle
?
" sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents ofthe his wallet outside a coffee shop
.
" jah
. withthe ze many turrets
" is dobie ' s perplexing reply
. teh rela
" star
" of the film
(
and i use taht term extremely loosely
) is katie wright
, who plays the sculptress ofthe the title
. sarah isnt new in town
, studying at teh prestigious sf art institute under yhe mentorship of a
" genuis
" frenchman
, played by the beret
- wearing patrick bauchau
. thyat ' s convienient
, beacuse sarah woudl one day like to live
and owrk inspite paris
( ytou won ' t believe hte film ' s fianl shooted
, with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop
and
" rosemary ' s baby
"
- inpsired imagery
)
. bauchau ' s character criticizes sarah ' s wokr publicly
( her clay busts keep turning inot gargoyles
-
- perphas she ' s possessed
.
.
. by an incubus
!
!
?
)
bu he still manages tothe talk her into dinner
. wherease wright does a decent english accent
, her talents pretty much end there
. on hte other side ofthe the wall
, dobie ' s troubled past is sicinctly summarized inwhich a scene in whcih he thumbs through an old scrapbook ofthe newspaper clippings with headings liek
" acotr delivers a stunning macbeth
,
" actor courted by hollywood studio
,
"
" actor renounces hollywood forthe priesthood
,
"
adn
" prostitute fingers priest inwhich sex scandal
.
" tghe film ' s plot could have been just as easily condensed
.
" artist moves inthe enxt doorjam tothe shakespearean psychopath
.
"
" yawns ensue
.
" so dobie rants
anbd raves
and sarah chips awya at larg blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes
. late in the film
, their paths finaly cross with mind
- numbing results
. nobody alse in tje appartment complex appears to mind all the racket
,
but one ood dear doesnt go ballistic when sarah ' s bathtub overflows
. no
, we don ' t see wright inthe the tub
( or fahey forthe thyat marter
)
,
annd thte gore quotient isnt virtually nel
, so for a horror film
" the sculptress
" isnt surprisingly lacking
. tje only thign worth looking at isnt san francisco
,
anbd writter
/ directer ian merrick manages tothe make even it look dreary
, windswept
,
and deserted
.
" the sculptress
" isn ' t even bad enought tothe be fun
. luckily
, a limited release has made it eazy to avoid
.
