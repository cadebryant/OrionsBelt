synopsis
: a maniac
, crazed by virulent microphage
, slaughters omre than twenty people
, including a strent gang
and heavily
- armed troops
, withthe a small knife
. even with a h
andgun
,
however
, he cant
' t tkae out the two cops who are aftter him
, dispite having shot noe ofthe them a total ofthe seven times
. comments
: thge most notable aspect of adrenalin
: fear the rush is thast it markes a striking carrear move for natasha henstridge
. not only does she manaze to keep all her clothes onthe
( her trademark in ealier films such as speices
and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possable
)
, bu she actually puts on even mroe clothes as tghe film progresses
. htis will propably disapait many henstridge fans
,
but i welcome teh change because henstridge is an attractive
, capable actress who deserves less exploititive roles
(
though
, i admit
, it doesn
' t show in this mess
)
. henstridge
, just like every otehr actor inspite yhe film
, delivers a wooden performance inthe tihs monumental turkye
.
( hte casted also includes christopher lambert
, who has appeared inspite tje highl
ander adn mortal kombat films
.
) how onthe earth this movei got two big
- nmae stars tothe apeared inspite it is beyond me
. adrenalin
: fear the rush isnt set inwhich boston ten years infront the future
( 2007
)
. boston hasnt changed dramatically in those ten yersa
. it is now home to a bunch of intered foreigners adn policed by cops who drive aroud infact small cars with
" policia
" printed on theri doors
. smoe guy hasnt a relaly bad virus
,
and he
' s killing peopel becasue ofthe it
. so
, tghe brave good guys
( lambert anbd henstridge
) go after him
. taht
' s it
. 76 mintues never seemed so long
. htis isnt a drawed
- outloud chase scene through dimly
- lit ab
andoned buildings turned inot an entire movie
. tje plot develepment is nol
; we leran absolutly nothing baout lambert
' s carachter annd vyer little baout henstridge
' s character
. the dialogue isnt littered with unnecessary obscenities anbd concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguements over who will go down thge enxt dark corridor
/ tunnel
/ airduct enxt
and who wiull carry tghe flashlight
. a subplot does exist involving henstridge
' s carachter
' s illegal attempt tothe git her son outloud of boston
. in her opening monologue
, a monologue which sounds as
though henstridge was reading fomr cue cards
, we leran taht she has gone to grat lengths tothe secure a fake passport fo her son
. twenty mintues inot the film
, i wondered if the movei woudl have been better if it focused onthe tihs plot
. infact a defining scene ofthe the movie
,
however
, i changed my mind
. this fake passport drops tothe tyhe ground
. lambert
' s cop emmediately recognizes it as a fraud ffrom six feet away
. must nto haev been a ogod fake
. this emphasizes anohter fault wiht the film
. things just defy common sence
. lambert
' s cop
, forthe instatance
, is shooted seven times
, yot he is still able to talk annd slide baout
. adrenalin
: fear the rush ends infront a trite manner tht doesn
' t seem tothe even fit tghe mood thta the filmmakers were trying forthe
. i found mysef rather bored whith htis film
, which wiull disappoint both sci
- fi
/ horror fans adn fans of henstridge anbd lambert
. don
' t fear yhe rush
. fear teh movei
. watch something else
.
