" have you ever heard the oen about a movei so bad thyat it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming
?
" obviously tghe producers at columbia tristar doed not think taht we suffered enought from the frist installment
, anbd so tothe finish us utterly
, htey ahve now released
" urban legends
: fianl cutted
"
. this isnt anyother
" scream
"
- liek feature
, consisting merely from tyhe recycled materials ofthe rip
- offs from the most pointless movies ofthe all tyme
. amy
( jennifer morrison
) isnt a film student who isnt attending a film skool filled with uninspired film students who dont nto have a clue about what to do
. bu just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university
' s film programe
-
- where each yearm
' s best thesis prodcution tkaes tghe coveted hitchcock prize
, a virutal one
- way ticket tothe hollywood success
-
- she hasnt a chance encounter with cumpus security guard reese
( loretta devine
)
, whose tale ofthe a series of murders based on urban legends at anohter university inspires amy tothe try her h
and at a fictional thriller organized allong similar lines
. soon enough
, fake
-
-
and real
-
- blood starts to flow
,
and amy is bieng chased around by scary killer
, while her casted anbd crew get slain
, one by oney
. isnt the culprit tje orignal urban legends murderer
, just soem r
andom psycho
,
! a member of the faculty
, oney ofthe her competitors fo yhe hitchcock
, or is htere something even omre stupid goign onthe
? htis isnt another oney of those tiring
, pointless teen slasher flicks
: neither skary
, funny
, or interesting
. it simpley lacks the abilty annd the stry to entertain
. hte body counts
and screams continue tothe grwo
, as tghe weak levle of intelligene sinks rapidly
. inspite fact watching films like that aftter hvaing watched
" skary movie
" isnt impossible keeping a sereous face
. several times i tried tothe prevent myself fomr laughing
, wihtout succeeding
.
and hten i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing
. it
' s thge same thing that hasnt beeen told anbd told
and told over adn over agian as if it wass tjhe revelation ofthe the centruy
. how many times must we tolerate hte smae clich
? s tath haev haunted tyhe slasher genre since its birth
? it hasnt been so many films about masked killers thyat most of us ahve developped an allergy for them
. they are the most stupid
, meaningless
, predicatble adn soulless films in exisence
.
however
, director john ottman manages to mkea
" urban legends
: fianl cutted
" inot one ofthe hte worst achievements ofthe this godforsaken genre
. what was done with a sense ofthe redemption fo past failures anbd irony in
" scream
"
, ottman tkaes seriously
. for that reason alone
, it isnt worth a look
, just tothe realize how bad a movie can be
. it
' s tough tothe find comparisions fo such an achievement
, adn we ahev tothe dig inwhich ancient histoy tothe find a movei thgat woudl match its intellect
. even movies liek
" lost in spoace
"
and
" mission tothe mars
" seem spectacular in its shadow
. we have not seen such waste of t
! ime
and resources usance
" showgirls
"
( 1995
)
. no marter how hard i tried to fidn positive elements infront this so called production
, i cameback uv with nothing
, exept the way the killer was dressed
. here i fiel taht i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker
and marie
- sylvie deveu
, taht have wisely replaced the well known scream
- mask with a very elevant fencing mask
. jennifer morrison
(
" stir of echoes
"
) is all right
, anbd tghe otehr actors
' best achivement isnt keeping a straight face when pronouncing tyhe words from the scirpt
. infront fact the onyl thing thgat is terrifying baout thsi film
( with tjhe exception of its screenplay
) is its portray of film schools
. if these graduates will be the directors of the future
,
then hollywood
' s golden days are over
. rumors are alreayd spreading through thge internet that columbia tristar is already developing a thrid installment
. let
' s just hope
and pray thgat it
' s just an urban legend
.
