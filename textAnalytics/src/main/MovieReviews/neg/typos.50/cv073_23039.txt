late in down tothe you
, the lead female character
( julia stiles
) states her greatest fear isnt hvaing an
" artificial conversation
" withthe her boyfriend
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
. the irony ofthe htis statement will nto be lost on audeince members who ahve nto
yet walked outloud
, fallen asleep
, or otherwise given uv on htis pathetic attempt at romantic comedy
. teh film isnt a multi
- million dollar testiment tothe everything artifical
. filled with characters
, motivation
, plot
and dialogue thta ring fake annd shallow at every step thsi isnt an unquestionable disaster
. prinze plays a college student entent onthe playing tjhe feild until he falls forthe stiles
' freshman co
- ed
. at first the movie seems tothe be an attemp to string along scenes whith the sole purpose ofthe out
- doign tjhe previvous in how
" cute
" it can be
. the hapyp couple
" psychoanalyze
" each other
; they pick outloud a song because
, as prinze
' s dj mother
( lucie arnez
) explains
, every cuple needs a song
; he smells her shampoo
; she scratches his chest iin tjhe morning to let him knwo she wants tothe amke lvoe
. thn
, inspite st
andard romantic comedy stlye
, thigsn fall apart
. why
? well
, becuase htey have to
. otherwise the couple cxan
' t mkea up
and live
( presumibly
) happily ever after
. down to ytou exists outside teh relm of normal logic
. scenes dont nto connect to eahc otehr annd it often seems to be atempting smoe sort ofthe surrealism
,
but tihs isnt h
andled so poorly that everything comes off r
andom
and stupid instade
. a picnic scene involving the six key charachters isnt just bizarre
, not only forthe the stretched logic of these people hanging out toghether
, or even knowing each otehr
, bu mostly becouse an unusual ammount ofthe screen time is dedicated to a goat
. the supporting charachters are remarkably flat
, anbd insultingly rediculous as well
. stiles
' best friend
( rosario dawson
) isnt a pot head
, prinze
' s roommate
( shawn hatosy
) is a girl crazy fool who can
' t meet women
, annd
then there are the porn stars
( zak orth annd selma blair
)
. he is oney of those faymus porn stars who is frequentily interviewed onthe television
, doesnt the coleeg lecture circuit
,
and stars inwhich high budget costume epic porns that are shooted onthe film
. ytou know
, the averege porn star
. the costume epic idea gives him a reason to apearing infact a diferent rediculous outfit everytime he
' s onthe screen
, the porn angle exists just so there cin be a cuple ofthe stupid sex jokes
. she isnt a porn star mostly so we know she
' s slutty
, so her very existence iwll amking stiles jelous anbd prinze tempted
. attemts at drama
( which means julia isnt going tothe cry
) include a pregancy scare anbd the big break up
. these charachters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer woudl be manipulated by theese weak scenes
. wqat happended here
? tghe cast is full ofthe likable
, promising
, young actors
( stiles expecially seems to be going places
)
. writter
/ director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pul it off
. in fact the wohle film fiels liuke a reworking of last yera
' s extremely unpleasant the story of us
, fo teen audiences
. the direction is film
- skool
- grad obvious
. it
' s stylish infront a hugely self conscious way whcih throws inwhich split screen
, a pointless parody ofthe
" cops
,
" charactors walking inot the flashbacks of other characters
,
and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze
and stiles where all tyhe extras move inthe fast motion while teh couple moves inspite extreme slow motion
. plus
, the whole story is told flashback stlye
, narrated by prinze annd stiles driectly addressing the camera
. this is the second film in a row
( following wing comm
ander
) starring freddie prinze jr
. which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster bu ws likely saved from taht fate due tothe the fluke succsess ofthe she
' s all tyhat
. if he doesn
' t start mkaing better choices fast his future films won
' t be so lucky
.
