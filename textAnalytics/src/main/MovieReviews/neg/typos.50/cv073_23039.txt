lite in down tothe you
, the lead female carachter
( julia stiles
) states her greatest fear is having an
" artifical conversation
" with her boyfriend
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
. tje irony of this statement wiull not be lost onthe audiance munbers who hve nto
yet walked out
, falled asleep
, or otherwise given uv onthe this pathetic attept at romantic comedy
. the film is a multi
- milion doller testimont tothe everything artificial
. filled with characters
, motivation
, plot
and dialogue thta ring fake
and shallow at eveyr step tihs is an unquestionable diaster
. prinze plays a coleeg student entent on playing tjhe field unitl he falls fo stiles ' freshman co
- ed
. at first tyhe movie seems tothe be an attept to string allong scenes with tje sole purpose ofthe out
- doign hte previous inaddition how
" cute
" it cin be
. the happy couple
" psychoanalyze
" earch other
; tehy pick outloud a song because
, as prinze ' s dj mother
( lucie arnez
) explains
, eveyr couple needs a song
; he smells her shampoo
; she scratches his chest infact yhe morning tothe let him know she wants to make love
.
thne
, in standart romantic comedy style
, thigns fall apart
. why
? well
, because tehy have to
. otherwise the cuple cxan ' t amke uv
and live
( presumably
) happily ever affter
. down tothe you exists outside tyhe relm of normal logic
. scenes dont nto connect tothe earch other
and it oftenly seems tothe be atempting soem sort ofthe surrealism
,
but tihs is handled so poorly that everyting comes off random
and stupid instade
. a picnic scene involving the six key charactors is just bazare
, not onyl for thte stretched logic of these people hanging out toghether
, or even knowing each otehr
,
but mostly beacuse an unusual amount ofthe screen time isnt dedicated tothe a goat
. thge supporting characters are remarkably flat
,
and insultingly rediculous as well
. stiles ' best freind
( rosario dawson
) is a pot head
, prinze ' s roomate
( shawn hatosy
) is a girl crazy fool who can ' t meet womens
,
anbd
then htere are tyhe porn stars
( zak orth
and selma blair
)
. he is one ofthe thsoe famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on televsion
, doens tjhe coleeg lecture circuit
,
adn stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film
. yuo knwo
, tyhe average porn star
. the costume epic diea gives him a reason to apear inspite a diffrent ridiculous outfit everytime he ' s onthe screen
, thge porn angle exists jsut so htere cin be a couple ofthe stupid sex jokes
. she is a porn star mostly so we nkwo she ' s slutty
, so her vyre exisetnce iwll make stiles jelous
and prinze tempted
. attemts at drama
( hwihc means julia is going to cry
) include a pregnancy scare
annd tje big break uv
. these characters are so insipid only tghe most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes
. what happened here
? tghe cast isnt full ofthe likable
, promising
, young actors
( stiles especialy seems tothe be going places
)
. writer
/ directer kris isacsson has simpley given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pul it off
. inspite fact thte wohle film feels liek a reworking ofthe lastr yearm ' s extremely unplesant the story of us
, forthe teen audiences
. the direction isnt film
- skool
- grad obvious
. it ' s stylish inaddition a hugely self consciou way whitch throws in splitted screen
, a pointless parody ofthe
" cops
,
" characters walking inot tje flashbacks ofthe other charachters
,
and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting vetween prinze
adn stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while tyhe cuple moves in extreme slow motion
. plus
, yhe wohle tsory isnt told flashback style
, narrated by prinze
annd stiles directly adressing the camera
. htis is the second film inspite a row
( follwoing wing commander
) starring freddie prinze jr
. whcih shoud ahve premiered onthe hte aisles of the local blockbuster
but ws likely saved from thgat fate due to the fluke sucess ofthe she ' s all that
. if he doesn ' t strat making better choices fast his future films won ' t be so lucky
.
