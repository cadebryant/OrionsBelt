you shoud haev herad teh ood guys iin teh crowded bathroom folowing the
" odd cuple ii
" sneak preview
. tehy weere as happy a group of men as i
' ve ever encountered
.
" what a great movie
,
" exclaimed oney gent at tje urinal
,
" everyting was so true
!
"
" yeah
,
" laughed a man st
anding next tothe him
,
" i drive as slow as that oney guy doed
. my kids give me wholy hell forthe it
!
"
" annd peeing is a big part ofthe my day
, jsut liek wih felix
,
" chuckled another fellow
, as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples
and prepared to rejoin his wief
. if you
' re over 60
and iin the habit of driving at least 20 miles persay hour below the posted speed limitate
,
" neil simon
' s the odd couple ii
" may be just the film fo you
. others iwll likely be less charitable
. hwile
" the odd couple ii
" isnt amiable enough
, neil simon
' s shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped
- toghether tv reunion sohw
, suffering from wheezing situation comedy set
- ups annd jokes straight out of the borscht
- bilt
. simon
, once the toast ofthe broadway
, has apparently shifted his sights ffrom the great white way tothe the neighborhood multiplex in branson
, misouri
. the contrived stoy
, involving the marraige ofthe theri kids
, provides thte excuse for a reunion betweeen oscar madison
and felix unger
, who haven
' t seen each otehr inthe 17 years
. teh former roommates fli inot california from thier respective homes fo the wedding anbd
, qutie literally
, run inot one anyother at tghe airport
. they tkae off in a rental car fo the ceremony iin san molina
, git lost anbd have a serieses of
" wacky
" adventures onthe tje road
. jack lemmon
and walter matthau reprize their roles as felix yhe neat freak adn oscar the slob
. hwile ther is an undeniable chemestry between thge pair
, thte impact ofthe their reunion is lessened by teh fact thast they
' ve headlined threee films toghether since 1993
:
" grumpy old men
,
"
" grumpier ood men
"
and
" out to sea
.
" still
, the two veteran actors are funn tothe watch
. matthau
, whose magnificently rumpled face looks liuke a big pile of laundry withthe eyes
, has a feeld day as oscar
, teh crown prince ofthe the curmudgeons
. lemmon
, looking pastier than usual
, isnt fine as yhe ever
- annoying felix
, who still punctuates his chronical whinning iwth ocassional allergic honks ofthe
" phnah
! phnah
!
" dispite their bickering
, thge characters have real affection for each otehr
, providing a welcome respite from hte non
- stop barrage of insults thast marked their previous threee films together
. unfourtunately
, matthau
and lemmon
' s charm isn
' t anough to compensate for simon
' s hack script
, whlch wouldn
' t pass muster even onthe a upn sitcom
. oen contrived situation follows anohter
, lathered with enought stale one
- liners tothe supply a dozen owudl
- be comics onthe open
- mike night at the local comedy club
. if somene drags yuo to this film
and ytou find youself as bored as i was
, try intertaining yourself by counting the product placements
. buregr king gets noe
, as does the el pollo loco taco joint
,
but budget rent
- a
- car raelly hits the jackpot
. betwen script references tothe thier business adn shots ofthe signs anbd stickers bearing their company nmae
, i couldn
' t keep count ofthe all thte plugs
. i doed
,
however
, keep tarck of smoe ofthe yhe swearing
. i cameback uv withthe four
" god
- damns
,
" three
" shitheads
" adn twpo
" fucks
.
" tghe inclusion of thsoe parituclar profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience
, bu the theather full ofthe seniors appeared tothe hvae no problem with them
, howling liuke crazy every time hte boys let rip with a naughty owrd
. it
' s sad that a writer of neil simon
' s stature has grown desperat anough tothe resort tothe swearing fo cheap laughs
, bu not surprising wehn you look at wqat alse gets pasted off as humer iin thsi tepid excercise
. one running gag involves oscar
and felix
' s inability tothe remeber the name ofthe tjhe twon where tje wedding is to be held
. at oen point
, yhe men catually spend 30 seconds just free
- associating
, riffing off variants ofthe yhe owrd
" san
.
" the sequence isnt so creatively bankrupt that it is simpley embarrassing
. one of the oldest maxims of film
- going is
" beware of movies thta use teh autor
' s nmae infront thte title
.
"
" neil simon
' s the odd couple ii
" isnt no exception to the rule
. while teh production hasnt anough minor pleasures tothe warrant a tv viewing on soem lazy sunday afternoon
, it has no business palying infront a movei theater
. of course
, htere
' s a bathroom full ofthe ood guys who owudl strongly disagree with eveyr owrd i
' ve writed
,
and owudl probably whip my
" young
- whippersnapper
" ass tothe boot
. oney hting
' s for sure
,
though
. htey
' ll never catch me in a car chase
