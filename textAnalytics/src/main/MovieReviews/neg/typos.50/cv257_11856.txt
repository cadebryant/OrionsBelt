yuo shoudln have heared the old guys inspite tje crowded bathroom follwoing tghe
" odd cuple ii
" sneak preview
. they weere as hapyp a gropu of men as i ' ve ever encountered
.
" whta a great movei
,
" exclaimed noe gent at the urinal
,
" everything was so true
!
"
" yeah
,
" laughed a man standing next to him
,
" i drive as slow as that one guy doed
. my kids give me holy hell fo it
!
"
"
and peeing isnt a big part of my day
, jsut liuke with felix
,
" chuckled anyother fellow
, as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples
anbd prepared tothe rejoin his wife
. if yuo ' re over 60
annd inaddition the habit ofthe driving at least 20 miles persay hour below the posted speed limitate
,
" neil simon ' s tghe odd cuple ii
" may be jsut the film for you
. others will likely be less charitable
. while
" the odd couple ii
" isnt amiable enought
, neil simon ' s shockingly lazy screenplay fiels like a slapped
- together tv reunion sohw
, suffering fomr wheezing situation comedy setted
- ups
and jokes straight outloud ofthe yhe borscht
- bilt
. simon
, once thge toast of broadway
, hasnt aparently shifted his sights ffrom yhe gerat white way tothe thte neighborhood multiplex infact branson
, misouri
. tjhe contrived stopry
, involving the marrage of their kids
, provides hte excuse fo a reunion between oscar madison
and felix unger
, who haven ' t seen each other in 17 years
. the former roommates fli into california ffrom thier respective homes for the wedding
and
, qtuie literally
, run into noe anohter at the airport
. tehy tkae off in a rental car for hte cerimony in san molina
, git lost
and ahev a series ofthe
" wacky
" adventures onthe tyhe road
. jack lemmon
annd walter matthau reprise theri roles as felix the neat freak
adn oscar yhe slob
. hwile ther isnt an undeniable chemestry betweeen tyhe pair
, tjhe inpact of thier reunion isnt lessened by the fact that htey ' ve headlined threee films together since 1993
:
" grumpy ood men
,
"
" grumpier ood men
"
anbd
" outloud to sea
.
" still
, tjhe twpo veteren actors are fun tothe watch
. matthau
, whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile ofthe laundry with eyes
, has a field day as oscar
, the crown prince ofthe the curmudgeons
. lemmon
, looking pastier tahn usual
, is fine as tjhe ever
- annoying felix
, who still punctuates his chronic whining withthe ocassional allergic honks ofthe
" phnah
! phnah
!
" despite theri bickering
, the charachters haev rela affection forthe eahc otehr
, providing a welcome respite from the non
- stop barrage ofthe insults thast maked their previous three films toghether
. unfortunately
, matthau
and lemmon ' s charm isn ' t enough to compensate fo simon ' s hack scirpt
, which wouldn ' t pass muster even onthe a upn sitcom
. noe contrived situation follows another
, lathered withthe enought stale oney
- liners tothe suply a dozen woudl
- be comics on opne
- mike night at the local comedy club
. if somene drags you to this film
anbd you fidn yourself as bored as i was
, try intertaining yourself by counting tjhe product placements
. burger king gets oen
, as doens the el pollo loco taco joint
,
but budget rent
- a
- car really hits the jackpot
. beetwen scirpt references tothe their business
and shots of signs
anbd stickers bearing thier comany name
, i couldn ' t keep count ofthe all the plugs
. i did
,
however
, keep trac ofthe smoe ofthe hte swearing
. i came up iwth four
" god
- damns
,
" threee
" shitheads
"
and twpo
" fucks
.
" the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience
,
but the theather full ofthe seniors appeared to have noone problem iwth them
, howling liuke crazy every tiem the boys let rip wiht a naughty owrd
. it ' s sad thta a writer ofthe neil simon ' s stature has grown desperate enough tothe resort to swearing fo cheap laughs
,
bu nto surprizing wehn ytou look at whta else gets passed off as humer inthe this tepid excercise
. oney running gag involves oscar
anbd felix ' s inablility tothe rember thge name ofthe the twon where yhe wedding isnt tothe be held
. at noe point
, the men actually spend 30 seconds jstu free
- associating
, riffing off variants ofthe the owrd
" san
.
" tjhe sequence isnt so creatively bankrupt that it isnt simply embarrasing
. oney of the oldest maxims of film
- gonig is
" beware of movies that use yhe author ' s name in the title
.
"
" neil simon ' s the odd cuple ii
" isnt noone exception tothe tjhe ruel
. hwile tje production has anough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing onthe smoe lazy sunday afternoon
, it has no buisness playing in a movei theater
. ofthe course
, there ' s a bathroom full ofthe ood guys who would strongly disagree witht eveyr word i ' ve written
,
and woudl probablly whip my
" young
- whippersnapper
" ass to boot
. one thing ' s forthe sure
,
though
. htey ' ll never catch me infront a car chase
.
