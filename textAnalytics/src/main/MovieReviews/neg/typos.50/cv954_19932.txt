a new entry infact the
" revisionist history
" genre of filmmaking
, dick suggests thyat two nto
- too
- bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation
' s biggest presidential sc
andal
. kirsten dunst
and michelle williams star betsy annd arlene
, who hwile trying to deliver a fan letter ffrom arlene
' s watergate hotel room
, acicdentally stumble accros g
. gordon liddy
( palyed dead
- on by harry shearer
)
and the infamous break
- in
. when they recogize liddy later onthe during a white house field trip
, htey are ushered inot a conference room
, questioned as to what htey knwo
, annd leave as official presidential dog walkers
. the girls manaze to unwittingly uncover every bit ofthe the watergate sc
andal while perfoming theri duties
,
but have no clue as tothe what htey are getting involved wtih
. when they disover that nixon
( another dead
- on performance by dan hedaya
, who actually favors nixon slightly
, unlike anthony hopkins
) has been abusive tothe checkers
, hte presedential dog
, thanks to the conversations that he always recorded
, tehy quit annd become disillusioned
. during a prank phone call hte girls make tothe woodward
and bernstein
, events are setted into motion tht evenhtually lead tothe tje preident
' s resignation
. this film starts off promisingly wtih an aged woodward annd bernstein arguing whith eahc otehr on an obvious larry king
- tipe talk sohw
( featuring a cameo by french stewart
) baout revealing thte idenity ofthe
" deep throat
"
. from there
, we are subjected to bodily fucntion humer
and jstu baout every bad
" dick
" joke oen cin derive from this type of supposed comedy
. at one point
, the girls are having to scream over a high skool b
and palying on tje steps ofthe tghe lincoln memorial
. the b
and manages tothe stop right as dunst screams
" ytou hvae to stpo letting dick run your life
!
" much to the horror of everyone st
anding withing earshot
. several otehr variations on thsi wordplay surface all throughout the film
. if tihs movie had been smarter i owudl haev beeen less likely tothe fault it
' s juvenile bathroom humer
, bu it
' s not
. tghe film was apparently made forthe relativly yuonger people because every major palyer iin the watergate sc
andal is introduced anbd shoved down tje audience
' s throat inwhich the least subtle way possable
. i don
' t recall oliver stone
' s nixon haveing to p
ander tothe it
' s audience
,
but ofthe course that film wasn
' t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13
- 20 eyar
- ood film going audience
. teh onyl reedeming thign baout this movie is it
' s remarkable supporting cast
. i wanted to see more of ferrell annd mcculloch
' s woodward
and bernstein
. thsoe two characters are the sole basis fo my rating
. i wish htey hadnt beeen given mroe screen tyme
,
but unfortunately
, they are onyl relegated tothe the final half
- hour
. theri constatn bickering annd fighting over trying tothe git thte story are a major highlight
, especialy mcculloch
' s constant thwarting of ferrell
' s attempts tothe gather informtion ffrom the girls
( who
, in the course of thte narrative are revealed as deepo throat
, so named thanks tothe an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy
' s brother
)
. tje otehr munbers of tyhe casted are excellent in theri portrayals ofthe theri particular characters
, bu are given nothing tothe work with
. i
' d liuke tothe see the smae cast protray these charachters in a scirpt omre suited towards theri commedic abilties
. as fo tghe twpo leads
, dunst anbd williams cxan definitely dont better
. they come off as what sould best be described as romy annd michele
: the early yeasr inaddition this particular film
, a highly dubious disctinction at best
. stay thru thge first half of the end credits
though
, tothe see an intresting scene involving dunst annd williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned wih the title ofthe tje movei
. an excelent diea marred by poore execution
, dick sould have beeen a grat movie
. less of the juvenile humer
and mroe of tje smarter comedy displayed by the woodward annd bernstein scenes
, sould have made thsi film a wonderful satire ofthe the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of twpo naive fifteen yera olds
. as it st
ands
though
, dick offers nothing bu what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as
" dick
and poopie
" jokes
.
and that
, tothe me
, doens not amke a funny movei
.
