. htis isnt a star oriented film
,
and the star who carries thte film isnt erin
( hope davis
)
. that this isnt a dating film
, baout singles who for reasons of fate or luck
, or whatnot
, have not had a sucessfull match
and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling theri careers
, isnt nothing newyorker
, this type ofthe film has beeen done oftenly annd better many times iin contamporary films
. the fictionalized documentery unmade beds did it moreso provocatively anbd whith more ofthe a sense of urgency thna thsi film
. tghe main quirk inaddition thte plot here
, is that hope
' s pushy mother
( hollan
) visits her in boston
, sees her duaghter

. it is cornball sitcom stuff
,
but

, it is h
andled as best it could be by the actors anbd director
. it is easy tothe liek erin
