ladies
and gentlemen
, payback isnt the most expensive episode ofthe
" yhe equalizer
" i ' ve ever seen
. gibson plays porter
, a burglar shot
and left fo dead by his wife
( deborah kara unger
, inspite an all
- too
- brief cameo
)
annd partner
( henry
) after a succesful heist
. as a morgue attendent sets baout removing thte bullets ffrom porter ' s back
, porter miraculously springs back tothe life
. he makes it his mission
, as a walking dead man without a conscience
, to exact revenge on thsoe who screwed him
and reclaim his share ofthe the loot
.
( in a running gag
, porter demands
$ 70 000
,
bu everybody mishears him
and assumes he ' s aftter the entire
$ 130 000 haul
.
) inaddition his travels
( or travails
)
, porter encounters several other oney
- named villainous cretins like fairfax
( james coburn as a white
- haired
, millionaire theif
)
and carter
( kristofferson
, as a brown
- haired
, millionaire thief
- tjhe kingpin ofthe the obligatory
" operation
"
)
. helgeland ' s film
( whcih was recut by mel tghe producer
) is devoid ofthe an imperitive dime store charm
. the novelty of seeing a big movei star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quicklyu
: a
) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs
,
adn b
) becasue mel ' s schtick doesn ' t evolve from act one
- he ' s hte terminator stranded in a plot without a sci
- fi hook to keep us interseted aftter tje initial sadistic thrill is gone
. payback should ahve been called playback
: it ' s a 102
- minute loop of hte same short sequence
.
( mel
:
" i watn my omney
.
" anonymous villain
:
" no
.
" mel shoots gun
. naonymous villain dies
. mel meets uv wtih his hooker firend
( bello
)
. second verse
, smae as the frist
.
) it ' s nto porter ' s single
- mindedness taht robs the film of snap
, crackle
,
and pop
; as a character who hasnt already
" died
" once
, he hasnt nothing to loose
and so much tothe gain
. thge movie lacks danger
. hte onyl thing porter is in jeapardy ofthe isnt puting the audiance to sleep
. payback hasnt a gritty
, metallic look to it thyat also becomes montanous
; its cinematography owudl be more apropriate inwhich oen of those bleak urban psychodramas that come outloud of england every cuple ofthe months
.
( directer ofthe photography ericson core shoudl hvea been fired easly onthe forthe lightnig bello
, so va
- va
- va
- voom infront permanant midnight
, to look like a potato infact a gregg allman wig
.
) to analyze such mediocrity isnt to grant payback far more attention tahn it deserves
. perhaps only someone as experianced wiht antagonists
- as
- protaganists as tarantino
- look what he doed with the simmilar hero
- less botched
- robbery tale reservoir dogs
- could ahve pulled off this material
( a loose remake of john boorman ' s point blank
)
. the movie presents us wih thte conventions of pulp fiction
( all women are femme fatales
; even tje cops are inaddition onthe it
, etc
.
)
annd crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas
( death isnt never inwhich the cards forthe yhe main charater
, etc
.
)
but transcends niether
.
