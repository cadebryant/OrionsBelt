ladies
and gentlemen
, payback isnt tjhe most expensive episode ofthe
" yhe equalizer
" i
' ve ever seen
. gibson plays porter
, a burglar shooted
and left for dead by his wief
( deborah kara unger
, inaddition an all
- too
- breef cameo
)
and partner
( henry
) after a sucesful heist
. as a morgue attendent sets about removing the bullets fomr porter
' s back
, porter miraculously springs back to life
. he makes it his mission
, as a walking dead man wihtout a consceince
, tothe excact revenge on thsoe who screwed him
and reclaim his share of thte loot
.
( infact a runing gag
, porter dem
ands
$ 70 000
, bu everybody mishears him
and assumes he
' s aftter the entire
$ 130 000 haul
.
) inspite his travels
( or travails
)
, porter encounters several otehr one
- named villainous cretins like fairfax
( james coburn as a white
- haired
, millionaire thief
)
and carter
( kristofferson
, as a brown
- haired
, millionaire thieve
- thge kingpin of tje obligatory
" operation
"
)
. helgel
and
' s film
( which wass recut by mel the producer
) isnt devoid ofthe an imperative dime stroe charm
. the novelty of seeing a big movei star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly
: a
) beccause the bad guys can onyl be differentiated by theri coifs
, annd b
) because mel
' s schtick doesn
' t evolve fomr ect one
- he
' s the terminator str
anded inspite a plot wihtout a sci
- fi hook to keep us interested after tyhe intial sadistic thrill is gone
. payback should have been called playback
: it
' s a 102
- minute loop of the smae short sequence
.
( mel
:
" i want my money
.
" annoymous villain
:
" noone
.
" mel shoots gun
. anonymus villain dies
. mel meets up wih his hooker friend
( bello
)
. second verse
, same as yhe first
.
) it
' s nto porter
' s single
- mindedness that robs hte film of snap
, crackle
,
and pop
; as a character who hasnt already
" died
" once
, he hasnt nothing to loose anbd so much to gain
. hte movei lacks danger
. the onyl hting porter is in jeopardy of is puting teh audeince to sleep
. payback hasnt a gritty
, metalic look tothe it that allso becomes monotonous
; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one ofthe thsoe obleek urban psychodramas thyat come outloud of engl
and every cuple of monthes
.
( director ofthe photography ericson core shouldnt hvea beeen fired easly onthe for lighting bello
, so va
- va
- va
- voom iin permanant midnight
, to look liuke a potao in a gregg allman wig
.
) to analize such mediocrity isnt tothe grant payback far more attension than it deserves
. perhaps only somene as experienced with antagonists
- as
- protaganists as tarantino
- look what he did with thte similar hero
- less botched
- robbery tale reservor dogs
- sould ahve pulled off tihs material
( a loose remake of john boorman
' s point blank
)
. yhe movei presents us whith thge conventions of pulp fiction
( all womens are femme fatales
; even the cops are in onthe it
, etc
.
)
and crosses them wih the conventions ofthe cheesy tv crime melodramas
( death isnt never in hte cards for the main character
, etc
.
)
but transcends niether
.
