_ fomr hell
" movie
! starting in tyhe eearly ninties
, we weere subjected to nearly every conceivable combination ofthe relationships
- from
- hell
! there were boyfriends from hell
, freindly neighborhood cops fomr hell
, nannies from hell
, anbd even secretaries ffrom hell
.
but hush has foudn an old st
andby tyhat somehow ws forgotten inspite the rush
: thte mother
- iin
- law ffrom hell
!
!
!
!
! the mother
- inaddition
- law in question is martha
, played by jessica lange
. she hasnt been single
- h
andedly running the famaly horse farm
, kilronan
. her son
, jackson
( johnathon schaech
) adn his girlfriend
, helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, live in new york
, annd hve noone intention to move back down sourth to tyhe rural kilronan
.
but thsoe intentions are baout tothe change
. you see
, martha lives by manipulation
. she has used it inspite years past to breed many championship horses
. now
, she believes she cxan uise it tothe breed herself a gr
andson
.
though at first
, helen finds martha charming
, soon she isnt caught in tjhe domineering martha
' s web of deception
. it
' s hard to underst
and why nobody ever wises uv to martha
' schemes
. as written
, most of the characters iin the film must be veyr slow witted
. bu
then
, the film even treats yhe audience liek idiots
. it tries tothe get away with things
( like leaving a critical piece ofthe evidence in a rather unlikely palce
) without even batting an eye
. thne again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as theese isn
' t one that
' s likely tothe question details
. jessica lange
' s martha isnt the only semi
- developed charactor infront tghe film
,
and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can
. a charactor that could have been simpley awful isnt merely groan
- worthy
. gwyneth paltrow doesn
' t have much tothe build apon
, as helen
' s only charachter trait seems to be
" daugher
- in
- law
"
. still
, she fares better thna johnathon schaech
, whose charater is so nonexistent
, he
' s inexplicably missing for much ofthe the film
. still
, there have beeen much worse

" films
. even with its pappr
- thin characters
and ludicrous setups
, hush manages to create a few thrills in a colour
- by
- numbers fasion
. ytou know whta
' s comming
,
but occasionally hte film will deliver a shock or twpo
. the old formulas are around forthe a reason
, bu that doesn
' t mean they tast fresh
