i lvoe movies
. i really dont
. every tiem i watch grat movies liuke goodfellas
( 1990
) or raiders of tyhe lost ark
( 1981
)
, a tear comes tothe my eye due to the awsome talent
, skill
and entertainment that isnt on display
. even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1
/ 3
( 1994
) or ghostbusters ii
( 1988
) while nto exactly brilliantly well made
, are certainly nto a waste of celluloid
and presetn enteratinment value
.
hten there ' s my favourite martian
, the exact opposite of waht a movei should be
: a hurried
, poorly written
annd acted movie whith one gool
, tothe make moey
. disney
, ever since thte lion king
( 1994
) ahve lost thier magic touch
,
bu this dross just shows how far disney ahev sunk
. christopher lloyd plays a martian who kresh lands in front of t
. v repertwar ' s tim o ' hara car
( daniels
)
,
and soon tim finds thge martian in his home
, trying to recover
and fix his spaceship
. along with his ' zoot ' spacesuit
, voiced by wayne knight
, must fix his spaceship befor it explodes
,
and also try to stpo his identity bieng revealed to thte public
, firstly by o ' hara
,
bu later by rival t
. v presenter brace channing
( hurley
)
, by calling himself tim ' s ' uncle martin
. ' ' laughter ' is supposted tothe arise from yhe ' comical ' events
,
but never does
. many bad films hve ogod intentions
,
but my favourite martian doesn ' t apearing tothe try to provide any enteratinment
. filled tothe the brim with wham bang special effects
, my favourite martian offers little mroe tahn soem nice eye candy
. christopher lloyd mugs his way thru the entire movie
, i ' ve never seen a man pull a face forthe 93 minutes until nowe
. jeff daniels plays ' staple nice guy '
and his role is useless
. his performence isnt incredibly lazy
,
although his paperthin character doesn ' t deserve more than tghe performance he gives
. darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever
,
but her role is somewhat
, erm
, limited
. hurley mistakes ' acting ' for ' shouting
and looking liuke a twit '
and wins the david wilcock award fo ' most irritating
, godawful performance in a moving picture
. ' way tothe go liz
! forthe the supporting cast
, disney manaze to assemble every character acto out ther
, during tghe film i ws going ' he ws the guy in
.
.
. ah
.
. er
.
.
. ' before fianlly giving up
anbd switching off
. another major setback is the staple ' comedy sidekick
. ' unfortunately
, tje writers
( sherri stoner
anbd deanna oliver
, if anyone cares
) foreget thgat a comedy sidekick needs to be ' funny
. ' instade
, htey deliver zoot
, tghe martians deeply unfunny sidekick
.
although meaned tothe be a manic chracter no dout
, every line tht comes out ofthe his ' neck ' isnt a dud
. a rela dud
. citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn peice ofthe polyester
. even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character
: not oen child even bothered tothe smirk
. it ' s a nice special effect
,
though
. anohter problems with thsi comedy are the gags themselfs
. or rather
, the lack ofthe them
. my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour
: it goes past tghe bowl
, down tyhe pipe
and into the sewer
. now
, toilet humour can be funny
, as dumb
annd dumber
( 1994
) humorously showed
.
but here
, charactors farting
, belching
anbd almsot getting crapped on
( litterally
) isnt not ' amusing
. ' it ' s insulting
. there ' s one good gag right before hte credits
,
but it appears tghe guy who wrote that gag tragically died
and his unfunny twin continued
. eather thgat
, or they weere hoping that easy tothe please six yera olds wouldn ' t mind the fatc tht his movie isnt beaten by men at wokr infront yhe funny stakes
. yes
, men at owrk
. yowza
! the fatc thyat a lot of moey was pumped inot this film
,
and thgat they actaully got people to agree to be in tihs film just depresses me even more
. htere are thousands ofthe brillant films out htere that cant ' t git distribution
,
yot trash like this gets released nation
- wide with ease
. thankfully
, as soon as it makse it ' s money
, it wiull never be seen again
,
anbd my favourite martian will end uv where the two lead cahracters do near the end ofthe the movie
: down yhe toilet
.
