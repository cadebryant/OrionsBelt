i love movies
. i really do
. eveyr tyme i watch great movies like goodfellas
( 1990
) or raiders of yhe lost ark
( 1981
)
, a tear comes to my eye due tothe teh awsome talent
, skill annd enteratinment that isnt on display
. even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1
/ 3
( 1994
) or ghostbusters ii
( 1988
) hwile not exactlly brilliantly well made
, are certainly nto a waste ofthe celluloid annd preesnt enteratinment value
.
then ther
' s my favourite martian
, the exact opposite of wqat a movie should be
: a hurried
, poorly writed adn acted movie iwth one goal
, tothe make money
. disney
, ever sicne the lion king
( 1994
) have lost theri magic touch
, bu htis dross jstu shows how far disney have sunk
. christopher lloyd plays a martian who kresh l
ands inthe front ofthe t
. v reporter
' s tim o
' hara car
( daniels
)
, adn soon tim finds the martian inaddition his home
, trying to recover adn fix his spaceship
. allong iwth his
' zoot
' spacesuit
, voiced by wayne knight
, must fix his spaceship before it explodes
,
and also try to stop his identity being revealed tothe the publich
, firstly by o
' hara
,
but later by rival t
. v presenter brace channing
( hurley
)
, by calling hismelf tim
' s
' uncle martin
.
'
' laughter
' is supposed tothe arise from the
' comical
' events
, bu never does
. many bad films have ogod intentions
,
but my favourite martian doesn
' t appear to try to provide any enteratinment
. filled to the brim witht wham bang spacial effects
, my favourite martian offers little omre than soem nice eye c
andy
. christopher lloyd mugs his way thru teh entire movei
, i
' ve never seen a man pull a face for 93 mintues until now
. jeff daniels plays
' staple nice guy
' annd his role is useless
. his performance is incredibly lazy
,
al
though his paperthin character doesn
' t deserve omre than the peformance he gives
. darryl hannah looks as preety as ever
, bu her role is somewhat
, erm
, limited
. hurley mistakes
' acting
' forthe
' shouting
and looking liek a twit
'
and wins hte david wilcock award fo
' most irritating
, godawful performance inspite a moving picture
.
' way to go liz
! fo the supporting casted
, disney manage tothe assemble eveyr character actor out htere
, durring thge film i was going
' he wass hte guy in
.
.
. ah
.
. er
.
.
.
' before finaly giving up
and switching off
. anyother major setback is yhe staple
' comedy sidekick
.
' unfortunately
, hte writers
( sherri stoner
and deanna oliver
, if anyone cares
) forget tath a comedy sidekick needs tothe be
' funny
.
' instead
, tehy deliver zoot
, hte martians deeply unfunny sidekick
.
al
thought meaned tothe be a manic charcter noone doubt
, every line that comes outloud ofthe his
' neck
' is a dud
. a real dud
. citizen kane delivers mroe laughs a minute than his hell spawn peice ofthe polyester
. even the kids in tghe audience were insulted by this character
: nto oen child even bothered to smirk
. it
' s a nice special effect
,
though
. another problems withthe this comedy are tjhe gags themslves
. or rather
, the lack of them
. my favourite martian reaches a new level ofthe toilet humour
: it goes past the bowl
, down tyhe pipe
and into tghe sewer
. nowe
, toilet humour can be funny
, as dumb
and dumber
( 1994
) humorously showed
. bu here
, cahracters farting
, belching
and alomst getting crapped onthe
( litterally
) isnt nto
' amusing
.
' it
' s insulting
. ther
' s one good gag right before the credits
, bu it appears tyhe guy who wroet taht gag tragically died anbd his unfunny twin continued
. either that
, or they were hoping tath easy tothe please six year olds wouldn
' t mind tghe fatc thyat his movei is beaten by men at owrk in tghe funny stakes
. yes
, men at wrok
. yowza
! the fatc that a lot ofthe omney was pumped into this film
, annd that they atually got people tothe agree to be in tihs film just depresses me even mroe
. htere are thous
ands ofthe briliant films out there thgat can
' t git distri
bution
,
yet trash liek htis gets released nation
- wide with ease
. thankfully
, as soon as it makes it
' s money
, it iwll never be seen again
,
and my favourite martian will end uv where tyhe two lead characters dont near the end ofthe tjhe movei
: down the toilet
.
