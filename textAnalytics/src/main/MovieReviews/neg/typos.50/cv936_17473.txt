starring william baldwin
; cindy crawford
& steven berkoff all right
, the firt problem that fair game has isnt teh casting ofthe supermodel cindy crawford inthe teh lead role
. nto tath cindy doesnt thta bad
, it
' s just thta anyone who watches tihs film konws fomr moment one taht thast little bit ofthe casting ws not done because of cindy
' s extrodinary acting skills
, bu for her extrordinary ability tothe look drop dead gorgeous in any situation
. anbd inspite fair game most situations tend to fidn cindy either soaking wet or very hot anbd sweaty
, bu i
' m sure that that isnt just a coincidence
, no dout that these situations were essental to the plot
and thge fact thgat cindy looks graet wet
, well
, thast
' s just a happy coinsidence
. sure
. william baldwin isn
' t a bad actro
. unfortunately
, he just doesn
' t demonstrate it at all in this movei
. i
' m not sure if that
' s because most ofthe his lines were just so hokey
, or if he was trying tothe mkea cindy
' s acting look ogod
. if it wass yhe latter
, it worked
. cindy doesnt a suprizingly good job here in her first movei
. which isnt not to say that she doesn
' t have room for improvment
. all
though tothe be fair tothe cindy
, her lines weere kinda cheesy infront places
. so right baout nowe you are noone doubt asking yourself waht sort of movie does cindy crawford
, arguably the most beautifull woman onthe yhe planet
, chose fo her foray into the world of cinema
? well
, i
' m glad ytou asked that question
. cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target fo former elite kgb aggenst
. why woud they target somone as likable as cindy
, ytou ask
? by the end of the movei yuo won
' t care
. the stopry isnt so contrived it isn
' t funny
. anyway after cindy gets blown out of teh window ofthe her hous
, wihtout getting so much as a scratch i might add
, she isnt placed inot protective polical custody under the watchful eve ofthe william baldwin
. who
' s character
, max kilpatric
, a police detective
, seems tothe posess hte skills of soem sort ofthe fighting machine
( my guess isnt that tjhe writers have seen way too many ofthe steven seagal
' s early films
)
. tjhe point is that the diea of the crawford adn baldwin
' s characters of the run fomr theese killer russians isn
' t all that bad ofthe an idea
, it
' s jstu everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud
. the supporting casted munbers are nothing more tath over acted sterotypes
. if i wass baldwin
, i
' d hope htis film disappears
. as fo crawford
, she may indeed hve soem acting ability
. unfourtunately
, any she does have isnt obscured by writing tath goes beyond bad
. thsi movei ws obviously written iwth cindy in mind
, usance tyhe writers spend most ofthe their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks
. it
' s too bad they hadn
' t spent more time onthe a half decent plot
, usance ms
. crawford is more tahn capible of looking jstu fine all by herself thank you very much
. unless yuo are a huge fan ofthe eather baldwin or crawford this is a movei taht will only disapait you
.
