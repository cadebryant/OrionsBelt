saleries ofthe hollywood top actors are getting obscenely larg theese dyas annd many fidn htis to be teh main reason for skyrocketing movei budgets
. actors who dim
and such salaries might be greedy
, bu in some instances they are qutie justified
, because many films would never be watched or even made wihtout theri participation
. proof for tath cant be foudn even inthe the relm of low
- budget movies
,
and noe fine example is breakaway
, 1995 thriller directed by sean dash
and starring
( iin
) famous figure skater tonya harding
. face ofthe tonya harding isnt most prominently featured on movei
' s poster
, bu the main star ofthe teh film isnt terri thompson who plays myra
, attractive woman who works as a courier fo gangster
. noe day she decides to retire
, bu her employers are anything bu enthuseastic about that
. realising thta her life suddenly bcame worthless
, myra starts runing for her life
, folowed by professional assassins
. terri thompson being the actuall star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes qtuie underst
andable after tghe scenes that feature former figure skater
.
al
thought tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities
, her acting leaves much to be desired
. onthe teh otehr h
and
, her disappointing efforts are hardly out ofthe palce in the film that lacks originality
, believeable characters
and situations
and actaully represents anything thyat gave b
- films a bad nmae
. martin sheen
' s brother joe estevez
, whose character looks liuke he had entered from another movies
' set
, is teh only bright spot of breakaway
. unfortunately
, he appears infront this film too littel too late to prevent viewers ffrom realising why tonya harding
' s silver screen de
but prooved to be her last film
