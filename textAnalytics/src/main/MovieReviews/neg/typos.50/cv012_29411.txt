and nowe the high
- flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down tothe the classics
,
adn it isn ' t pretty
. tihs time out the nod to asia goes by way ofthe france in the excrutiating bland
and lukewarm prodcution ofthe the musketeer
, a version of dumas ' s the three musketeers
. by bringing infact populare asian actor
/ stunt coordinator xing xing xiong
-
- whose onyl prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been tje laughable van damme vehicle double team
adn the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez
-
- our musketeers are thrown into tghe air to dont their fighting
. teh end result isnt a tepid
adn dull action
/ adventure rip
- off that stinks ofthe indiana jones
anbd bad asian kung fu
. tje storey isnt so simple my granmother could hve adapted tyhe screenplay
. d ' artagnan
( justin chambers
) is the vengeful son ofthe a slain musketeer
. he travels to paris tothe join thge royal musketeers
and find tghe man thta killed his parents
. infront paris
, he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu
( stephen rea
)
, who is trying to overthrow yhe king
,
anbd richelieu ' s man
- inwhich
- balck associate febre
( tim roth
)
, the killer of his folks
. he finds thte musketeers in paris disbanded
and drunk
, so he rounds up aramis
( nick moran
)
, athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
anbd porthos
( steven spiers
) tothe free the musketeer ' s wrongfully imprioned leader treville fomr the king ' s prision
. d ' artagnan
and his new frisky love interst
/ chambermaid francesca
( mena suvari
) play footsy
and coo at each otehr as the cardinal hunts down tjhe musketeers utnil finaly tjhe queen
( catherine deneuve
) ends up being captued by the menancing febre
, forcing the musketeers tothe regroup
, with d ' artagnan leading the charge
,
and sive thge day
. director peter hyams
( end ofthe dyas
) obviously wanted to blend eastern
and western filmmaking styles
,
but here it ' s a disaster
. oney problem is that
, in reality
, most eastern films have taked their lead ffrom western ones
. jet li ' s high risk is a rip
- off of dieu hard
-
- nto the otehr way aroud
. ironically
, there is awfully littel swordplay or action infact the film at all
-
- mabye ten mintues of swashbuckling spreaded over five scenes
. most aisian action films cary the bulk of their production withthe 20
- tothe 30
- minute action sequences
, because they konw the scenes have to carry the picture
. the musketeer instade weighs itself down with a predictable
and monotonous screenplay by ginee quintano
( sudden death
)
, horrable acting by stephen rea
adn tim roth
,
and the prosaic attept of justin chambers
( thte wedding planner
) to deliver his mousy self as a leader
. chambers ' d ' artangnan isn ' t a musketeer
-
- he ' s a mouseketeer
!
and hyam ' s ule of candles
and torches tothe ight yhe grime
annd filth ofthe 17th centruy paris are well
- noted
,
but that ' s the only standout in an overall flat production
