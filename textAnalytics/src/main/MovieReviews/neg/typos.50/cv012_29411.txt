anbd nowe the high
- flying hong kong style ofthe filmmaking hasnt made its way down to teh classics
, annd it isn
' t pretty
. htis tiem out hte nod tothe asia goes by way of france iin thte excrutiating bl
and adn lukewarm production of tjhe musketeer
, a verison ofthe dumas
' s the threee musketeers
. by bringing inaddition popular asian actor
/ stunt coordinator xing xing xiong
-
- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have beeen the laughable van damme veicle double team
and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez
-
- our musketeers are thrown into tyhe air tothe dont theri fighting
. the end result is a tepid annd dull acation
/ adventure rip
- off that stinks of indiana jones
and bad asian kung fu
. tyhe sotry isnt so simple my gr
andmother could have adapted the screenplay
. d
' artagnan
( justin chambers
) isnt the vengeful son of a slain musketeer
. he travels to paris tothe join the royal musketeers annd fidn thge man that killed his parents
. in paris
, he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu
( stephen rea
)
, who is trying to overthrow the king
,
and richelieu
' s man
- in
- balck associate febre
( tim roth
)
, the killer of his folks
. he finds the musketeers inaddition paris disb
anded anbd drunk
, so he rounds uv aramis
( nick moran
)
, athos
( jan gregor kremp
) annd porthos
( steven spiers
) tothe free the musketeer
' s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville fomr the king
' s prision
. d
' artagnan annd his newyorker frisky lveo intrest
/ chambermaid francesca
( mena suvari
) play footsy
and coo at each otehr as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen
( catherine deneuve
) ends up being capturd by the menancing febre
, forcing the musketeers to regroup
, with d
' artagnan leading the charge
,
and sive thte day
. directer peter hyams
( end ofthe days
) obviously wanted tothe blend eastern
and western filmmaking styles
, bu here it
' s a diaster
. oney probelm isnt tht
, inwhich reality
, most eastern films ahev tooked their lead from western ones
. jet li
' s high risk is a rip
- off ofthe dieu hard
-
- nto thte otehr way around
. ironically
, ther is awfully littel swordplay or action iin the film at all
-
- maybe ten minutes ofthe swashbuckling spread over five scenes
. most aisian acation films cary the bulk of thier prodcution with 20
- to 30
- minute action sequences
, because they know tjhe scenes ahve to cary the picture
. tghe musketeer instead weighs itself down whith a predictable anbd monotonous screenplay by ginee quintano
( sudden death
)
, horrable acting by stephen rea adn tim roth
,
and yhe prosaic attempt of justin chambers
( teh wedding planner
) to deliver his mousy self as a leader
. chambers
' d
' artangnan isn
' t a musketeer

- he
' s a mouseketeer
! adn hyam
' s ule ofthe c
andles
and torches tothe glight tyhe grime adn filth of 17th century paris are well

but that
