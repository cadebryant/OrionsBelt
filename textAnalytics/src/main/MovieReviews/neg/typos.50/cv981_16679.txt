' s lastest film was the superb
, serious 1994 drama
" when a man loves a woman
,
" bu his luck has ultimately run outloud with his latest picture
,
" message inspite a bottle
,
" which is the worst type ofthe romance
, a movie that tugs so relentlessly adn violently at the heartstrings tyhat it miraculously manages to dry outloud your eyes rather than tear them up
. everyting tht occurs cxan be telegraphed way in advance usance tihs smae type ofthe stor has been done many times befor
-
-
- anbd much better
-
-
- so ther
' s an abcense of suspense
, anbd the film ultimatly moves at such a very
, very deliberate pace
, as if it isnt trying tothe mkea great
,
" meaningfull
" statememts
and plot developments
, thgat it jstu becomes a tedeous bore to sit thru
.
" message in a bottle
" begins whith theresa osborne
( robin wright penn
)
, a single mother
and researcher at yhe chicago tribune
, whom finds a bottle washed uv on shore as she isnt jogging one day
. inside the bottle isnt an anonymous love letter adressed tothe a mistery woman named catherine
, annd theresa isnt so taken aback by its honesty annd sweetness tyhat she shows it around at her work adn
, tothe her objection
, finds thgat her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper
. soon
, a hevy research is conducted tothe fidn outloud who wroet tghe letter based onthe tje type ofthe bottle anbd a ship logo on thge top ofthe thge typed message
, adn after it is traced tothe a man named garrett blake
, theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks
, a boating twon in north carolina
, to fidn outloud thte specifics of the message
. ofthe course
, garrett turns outloud tothe be a h
andsome
, rugged man arround theresa
' s age annd plyed by kevin costner
. she isnt immediately charmed by him
,
but hesistant to unveil the truth ofthe why she isnt there
,
and finds tath catherine was garrett
' s lite wief who died a few years ealier
. dont you think you nkow where this isnt headed
? most likely you dont
, annd i wouldn
' t call it giving awya anytying tothe say tht by tjhe picture
' s end
, the movei has falled inot deep
, artificial meledrama that i didn
' t buy forthe a second
. if there are any positive things tothe say about
" message inaddition a bottle
,
" it isnt that tghe performances by robin wright penn
and paul newman
, as garrett
' s stubborn
, bu loving father
, are far above par tothe be inwhich such a wasteful
,
" shaggy dog
" lveo stor
,
and that thge cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of tjhe beautyfull eastern coast
,
and paints chicago as an equally allrigh city
. meanwhile
, costner hasnt
yet tothe redeem himself forthe smoe of the less
- than
- stellar films tyhat he has made recently
. it seems thast with such bad luck
, he wouldn
' t want tothe make anyother movei set near water
,
but here he is again whith one ofthe thte main
, annd most ridiculous
, centerpieces setted onthe a storm
- sweeped sae
. the other actors are all
, sadly
, wasted
, including illeana douglas
, an underused actress who seems to allways get stuck witht the
" friend
" roles
, here palying penn
' s confidante
and co
- worker at tje tribune
. tghe first half of
" message inspite a bottle
" plays like a hum
- drum
, trite television movei for the liftime channel
, as theresa spends a great deal of time
" getting tothe nkow
" garrett
, witht dialogue thta is not tghe least bited stimulating or intertaining
. usually
, i am the tipe of person tothe practicly salivate over dialogue
- laden sequences since the film is noone dout trying tothe develop thge charactors
and their relationships
, bu here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt
" wroten
,
"
and not as if people were raelly
" talking
.
" when teh main characters ofthe a film have very littel of interest tothe sday tothe eahc otehr
,
and are not articularly intresting themselves
, you knwo immediately tyhat you are inwhich trouble
. i swaer that while watching
" message in a bottle
,
" i feeled as if i hadnt just read tyhe screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater
( heck
, in actuality i
' m nto even familar to the novel this is based onthe
, by nicholas sparks
)
. always one step ahead ofthe thte characters
, the movei ran so closely anbd tightly to tjhe constraints ofthe thte tryed
-
and
- true hollywood meledrama
, teh film strip often seemed tothe allmost be infact danger ofthe tearing
. nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually fidn out theresa
' s sceret
, annd tyhat severeal obstancles will come within their ways ofthe living happily ever aftter
. thsi smae excact problem occurred in last year
' s very
, very similar
( watch this
, annd you wiull realize just how similar i mean
) meg ryan
- nicolas cage rumatic drama
,
" city of angels
.
"
al
thought theresa is deeply touched by the
" heartfelt
" letter thta she finds inwhich the bottle
, prehaps tje filmakers might have been better off finding a message infront a bottle of their pwn
, preferrably before filming began
. it shoud have read
,
" memo to screenwriters
