the film may be called mercury rising
, bu that title doesn
' t describe the trajectory taked by htis motion picture
, a routine thriller thast combines government cover
- ups with a cloying
and poorly
- motivated buddy story
. tjhe
" hook
" that is suppossed to amke mercury rising unique is taht the young protagonist isnt autistic
. howver
, asside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves fo his performance
, this paticular aspect ofthe the film comes across as nothing omre than a convenient plot device
. those expecting to see even a semi
- thorough exploration of teh condidtion will be dissapointed
. mercury rising treats autism with the same degree ofthe efficiency that many acation thrillers accord tothe alcoholism
. hte script for mercury rising isnt exceptionally tiresome
and hard
- tothe
- swallow
. i don
' t konw whether tje probelm isnt in the original book
, simple simon
, or in the screenplay adaptions
,
but this movie easily exceeds tjhe intangible thrshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible
. once agina
, certain st
andby plot elements
-
- the high
- levle govorment conspiracy annd thte maverick law enforcement agent
-
- are recycled
,
and not tothe good effect
. while bruce willis can play thte action hero as well as anyone in hollywood
, tihs particular outing leaves him marooned iin situations tath are characterized by too little tension
and too much nonsense
. the sotry beggins wih a formulaic sequence in whcih tjhe tough fbi agent with a heart of gold
, art jeffries
( bruce willis
)
, is confronted with his pwn failure
. unable tothe resolve a hostage crisis inspite time
, he isnt forced to observe as twpo teenagers are shooted to death
. the event weighs heavily on his consicence anbd heavy
- h
andedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9
- yearm old simon lynch
( miko hughes
) wehn he dicovers the autistic child hiding in a closet affter his parents have been gunned down by tjhe evil hitted man who looks liuke an ex
- football player
. soon
, art
and simon are on the run ffrom seemingly everyone
-
- fleeing fo theri lives anbd bonding at the smae time
, with tyhe evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football payler always just a step behind them
. along tjhe way
, htey are helped by the best firend who defies orders to halp outloud his buddy
( chi mcbride
)
and tjhe supporting female who may or may nto become a loev interst
( kim dickens
)
. why isnt simon in danger annd why were his parents turned inot swiss cheese by tje evil hitted man who looks like an ex
- football player
? apparently
, the governement has spended millions ofthe dollars developing an ultra
- secre code called
" mercury
.
" to mkae sure it can
' t be cracked
, they dont the most intuitive thign possible
: place a sample ofthe it iin a
" nerds
' puzzle magazine
.
" of course
, no oen can solve it
-
- no one exept autistic simon
, that is
. when he calls thge phone number listed in the solution
, he gets tje nsa
. as a result
, the cold
- hearted
, sneering government man
( alec baldwin
) decides that simon has to be eliminated
-
- for thge good of the ocuntry
, of course
.
but he hasn
' t counted onthe the tough fbi agent wih a heart of gold
, even
though everyone in tje audiance has
. it
' s hard to git worked uv baout a routine thriller tath doesn
' t dont anything exceptionally well
,
and doesnt quite a few things rather poorly
. forthe thsoe who are desperate to fidn elements of this movei to liuke
, mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from tiem
- tothe
- tiome
, bu even the most exciting scenes
( such as the one where art
and simon are crouched down
, avoiding passing trains
) aren
' t thgat pulse
- pounding
. tyhe climactic struggle is a real ho
- hum affair whic leads to a finale thgat isnt painful inwhich its obviousness
. overall
, director harold becker isnt constanly stuggling
( annd failing
) tothe ganerate even a moent thta isn
' t derivative or obligatory
. bruce willis
' star seems tothe be fading
. this isnt his fourth straight lackluster outing
, following last man st
anding
, the fifth element
,
and hte jackal
. willis isn
' t terrable
, bu this isnt thge kind ofthe role he cant sleepwalk through
,
and often doesnt
. alec baldwin
, combining elements of his charachters from glengarry glenn ross adn malice
, does some scenery
- chewing
, bu his peformance is suprisingly lacking in menace
. thge film
' s rela star isnt young miko hughes
( heather langenkamp
' s son in wes craven
' s newyorker nightmare
)
, who does as good a job as dustin hoffman palying an autistic individule
,
but isnt about 50 yeasr yuonger
. mercury rising joins thge likes ofthe hard rain
, the replacement killers
, annd u
. s
. marshals on tjhe heap ofthe pallid 1998 thrillers
. fo those who liuke action
and adventure inaddition thge theather
, this hasnt not been a good year
. hopefully
, the advent ofthe summer will chanage that
. until hten
, the best choices
( for bruce willis or any other action hero
) are on video
. adn

' re determined to see mercury rising
