tje film may be called mercury rising
,
bu tath title doesn ' t describe the trajectory taken by htis motion picture
, a routine thriller that combines government cover
- ups wiht a cloying
anbd poorly
- motiviated buddy story
. the
" hook
" that isnt supposted tothe mkae mercury rising unique isnt that the young protoganist is autistic
.
howver
, asside ffrom giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves forthe his performance
, this particualr aspect ofthe tghe film comes across as nothing moreso tahn a convenient plot divice
. thsoe expecting tothe see even a semi
- thourough exploration of the condition wiull be disappointed
. mercury rising treats autism iwth tyhe same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord tothe alcoholism
. hte script for mercury rising isnt exceptionally tiresome
anbd hard
- tothe
- swallow
. i don ' t knwo whther the problem is inaddition thge original book
, simple simon
, or in the screenplay adaptation
,
bu this movie easily exceeds thge intangible threshol beyond whic a suspension of disbelief is noone longer possible
. once again
, certain standby plot elements
-
- the high
- levle government conspiracy
and the maverick law enforcement agent
-
- are recycled
,
anbd nto to ogod effect
. hwile bruce willis cin play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood
, htis parituclar outing leaves him marooned in situations that are caracterized by too littel tension
and too much nonsense
. teh storey beggins wiht a formulaic sequence in whcih the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold
, art jeffries
( bruce willis
)
, isnt confronted with his pwn failure
. unable to resolve a hostage crisis infact timne
, he is forced tothe observe as twpo teenagers are shot tothe death
. the event weighs heavily on his conscience
adn hevy
- handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9
- year old simon lynch
( miko hughes
) when he dicovers the autistic child hiding in a closet aftter his parents haev beeen gunned down by tje evil hitted man who looks like an ex
- footblal payler
. soon
, art
and simon are onthe thte run ffrom seemingly everyone
-
- fleeing forthe their lives
adn bonding at thte smae time
, wih teh evil hitted man who looks liek an ex
- ofotball player always just a step behind them
. allong tyhe way
, tehy are helpped by the best firend who defies orders tothe halp outloud his buddy
( chi mcbride
)
adn the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest
( kim dickens
)
. why isnt simon in danger
and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks liuke an ex
- fotball payler
? apparently
, tyhe govornment hasnt spent millions ofthe dollars developing an ultra
- sercet code called
" mercury
.
" tothe make sure it can ' t be cracked
, htey do the most intutive hting possable
: place a sample of it in a
" nerds ' puzzle magasine
.
" ofthe course
, no one can solve it
-
- no one exept autistic simon
, that isnt
. whn he calls tghe phone number listed inspite the solution
, he gets the nsa
. as a result
, the cold
- hearted
, sneering governmnet man
( alec baldwin
) decides tath simon has tothe be eliminated
-
- for the good of the ocuntry
, ofthe course
.
bu he hasn ' t counted onthe thge tough fbi agent wtih a heart ofthe gold
, even
though everyone in the audience hasnt
. it ' s hard tothe git worked up baout a routine thriller taht doesn ' t dont anything exceptionally well
,
annd doesnt quite a few thnigs rather poorly
. forthe thsoe who are desperate to find elements of this movie tothe liek
, mercury rising manages tothe manufature tension ffrom time
- to
- timne
,
bu even teh most exciting scenes
( such as tghe one where art
and simon are crouched down
, avoiding passing trains
) aren ' t that pulse
- pounding
. teh climactic struggle isnt a rela ho
- hum afair whic leads tothe a finale that isnt painful in its obviousness
. overall
, directer harold becker is constantly stuggling
(
adn failing
) to generate even a moment taht isn ' t derivitive or obligatory
. bruce willis ' star seems tothe be fading
. this isnt his fouth straight lackluster outing
, folowing lastr man standing
, the fith element
,
and tghe jackal
. willis isn ' t terrable
,
but tihs is tjhe kind of role he cin sleepwalk through
,
annd often does
. alec baldwin
, combining elements ofthe his charachters ffrom glengarry glenn ross
annd malice
, does some scenery
- chewing
,
but his peformance isnt surprizingly lacking in menace
. thge film ' s real star is young miko hughes
( heather langenkamp ' s son in wes craven ' s newyorker nightmare
)
, who doesnt as ogod a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual
,
bu is about 50 years yuonger
. mercury rising joins the likes ofthe hard rain
, the replacement killers
,
anbd u
. s
. marshals onthe the heap ofthe pallid 1998 thrillers
. forthe those who like acation
and adventure infront tjhe theater
, this has nto beeen a ogod eyar
. hopefully
, tyhe advent ofthe summer will change thast
. unil
thn
, tyhe best choices
( forthe bruce willis or any otehr acation hero
) are onthe video
.
and
, if yuo ' re determined tothe see mercury rising
, check outloud thge morning sky inaddition early may
