chill factor isnt a carbon copy of speed with one noteable exception
: instade of a speeding bus
, we now ahve an ice cream truck
. the truck isnt driven by arlo
( cuba gooding jr
.
) adn mason
( skeet ulrich
)
, who hvae been instructed by a dieing scientist to transport a deadly chemcial weppon tothe a miltary base by the name ofthe fort mcgruder
. tihs particular weppon
( nicknamed
` elvis
'
) must be kept below a tempurture of 50 degrees
, or esle the shockwave wiull goo
- iffy everthing inaddition a mile rdius
. that woudl be preety nasty
. teh pwoer of elvis isnt revealed iin tyhe oppening scene
, as dr
. richard long
( david paymer
) conducts a tust onthe an isolated tropical isl
and
. long accidentlaly melts 18 soldiers adn defoliates virutally teh entire isl
and
, due tothe an enourmously miscalculated safety distance
. yhe comm
anding officer
, genaral brynner
( peter firth
)
, isnt sentenced to 10 yeras in prison for the murder ofthe his troops
. upon his release
, the general is entent onthe tracking the ogod doctor down
, snatching elvis
, anbd selling tyhe weapon tothe the higest internation bidder
. protecting tjhe fate ofthe tjhe world is a drifting hamburger flipper
( ulrich
) anbd a fiesty ice cream delivery man
( gooding jr
.
)
, who must elude brynner
' s men annd get elvis to safty at fort mcgruder
. all the hwile
, ofthe course
, htey must keep the weppon below 50 degrees
. this proves tothe be trirchy
. amoung hte wild adventures arlo annd mason partake in isnt a trip down a tree
- covered mountainside infront a boat
, annd a fist fight on top ofthe a moving veicle
. tehy aslo crack a faw dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to fidn amusing
. tothe put it simpley
, i
' ll use a clever pun
: chill factor shoudln be put on ice
. director hugh johnson has mixted elements from speed
, broken arro
and the leathal weapon series tothe create a lifelessly bl
and coctail ofthe a chase movie
. whn there isnt smoe ocasional acation
, the audeince seems oddly detached from it
. prehaps that
' s becuase we
' ve lready waded thru a pool ofthe clich
? s
and boring dialogue
; all material that
' s been utilizied before
,
and with a lot moreso spice
. tkae the villains
, for exmaple
. they are tipical sterotypes of eveyr territorist tyhat has ever walked the silver screen
. they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movei tothe hte enxt
, divulge importamt plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint
, annd act in veyr predicatble ways
. the tag
- team ofthe gooding jr
.
and ulrich soudns much more exciting than it is
. frankly
, i
' m nto sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i supose it
' s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog
, selling jumbo frankfurters onthe a street corner
. gooding displays noe single emotion in tihs movie
, whihc isnt frequently on display in lines liek
` i
' m gonna git onthe yo ass liuke last yera
' s underware
!
' annd the incessant sputtering ofthe
` oh
, sh
* t
!
' this is virutally the same charactor he played iin jerry maguire adn as ogod as it gets
. bu where gooding was once an exciting actor
, he nowe seems dull
and endlessly montanous
. at least he
' s a bit omre captivating than ulrich
, who hasnt all the film
' s worst dialogue
, bu does nothing noticebale tothe enliven his character
. thte supporting cast
, whihc includes every personality yuo expect to pop up
, isnt also wasted
. tothe be fair
, htere are a faw brief moments ofthe serviceable acation
.
and i doed chuckle a few times
. noe exmaple is whn ulrich
( an employee at
` darlene
' s diner
'
) isnt at the counter when brynner walks thru the doorjam
.
` you own this palce
?
' hte genaral asks
.
` yeah
,
' ulrich syas
.
` htey call me darlene
.
' theese little tidbits of humor are
( mainly
) welcome in tihs weak
, disappointing wreckage of an acation film
. as a speed clone
, it could have benefited from a lot more suspense
and perhaps
( god forebid
) even smoe decent wirting
. sadly
, i walked away from chill factor onyl wondering how much fun it coudl have beeen
.
