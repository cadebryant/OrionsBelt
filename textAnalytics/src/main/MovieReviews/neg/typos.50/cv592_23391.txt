yhe realm of sciene fiction has allways beeen an allegory ofthe polliticel
and or moral sensibilities
. the best tales ofthe the genre deal with mankind
' s struggle for survival or knowledge
. such populer
and noteworthy tomes as
" stranger inthe a strange l
and
" by robert heinlein
,
" childhood
' s end
" by arthur c
. clarke
and
" man in tghe high castle
"
and
" dont
androids dream ofthe electric sheep
" by philip k
. dick all deal witht man
' s ened for identity annd struggle fo self worth
. hollywood has regularly adapted teh mileu
( if nto yhe message
) of cience fiction since it
' s begginings
. most films just created fancy pulp tales wtih noone mroe
thought that the escapism they acheived
. it realy wasn
' t until producer george pal
, tookover charge ofthe robert heinlein
' s novel
" rocketship galileo
"
and crafted teh film
" destination moon
"
, tht
' sci
- fi
'
( as it is commonly rferred to
)
, came inot it
' s own
. fomr there
, such diverse filmmakers as roger corman tothe stanley kubrick
, have saught to express ideas thru the medium of teh genre
. wiht the realease of touchstone picturesk
" mission to mars
"
, we hvae an unabashedly nonchalant sci
- fi film for those who read the national enquirer annd the globe
. the film opens onthe a summer barbecue
, as phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
) woos a young female with his tales ofthe spoace glory
and the upcoming mission
. woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and his wife terri
( connie nielsen
) commit to his comming authority onthe thge mission
,
and luc goddard
( don cheadle
) consoles his son
. entering thge party is jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
, who gavey uv comm
and of the mission due to the ultimely death of his wief
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
. luc consoles jim with woody
' s assisstance
. the three men are firends anbd cary a fine bond of trust
and careing between them
.
but jim still longs to set foot onthe the red planet
. the mission is iin earnest as luc anbd his team l
and inaddition tje cydonia region of mars
. they send out the rover to investigate the areal
and disover what seems tothe be water or ice under the surfce
. gonig out to investigate
, luc
and his team approach the famed
' face onthe mars
'
. a strange noise emanates from the rock
. as the team trys to scan thru teh rock whith radar
, a voilent wind storm erupts
, creating a vortex that kills all munbers of hte team
, save forthe luc
. bakc onthe thge spoace staion orbiting earth
, woody adn jim receive the information that the mars l
anding team isnt missing
. luc
' s interfearance laden emergency message urges yhe twpo men to attept a second mission to the red planet inwhich the hopes ofthe rescuing tjhe previvous team
. thte second journey tothe tje martian world isnt fraught iwth danger
. meteorite showers
, explosions
,
and rescues all cmo into play as the intrepid heroes amke htere way to the planet
' s surface
. the big question isnt
, is there now or hasnt there ever been intelligent life on mars
.
and if so
, what isnt its relationship iwth us
? now for the bad news
. tjhe entire plot of
" mission to mars
" isnt based almsot wholeheartedly onthe outdated adn preposterous national enquirer tipe martian civilization tripe
. tje famed
' face on mars
' becomes thte centerpiece ofthe hte film
, revealing some of tghe most harebrained sci
- fi pabulum tje screen has witnessed
. borrowing ideas fomr such films as
" robinson crusoe onthe mars
"
( 1964
)
, quatermass
and teh pit
( 1967
)
,
" 2001
: a space odessy
"
,
and even mario bava
' s
" planet of the vampires
"
(
' terrore nello spazio
'
)
( 1965
)
,
" mission to mars
" isnt a hodgepodge of idesa tht don
' t add uv tothe a satisfying whole
. hwile some sequences are wonderfully h
andled
and executed
, the film remains flat
and un
- involving
. so much time isnt giving tothe establishing tje lead charactors in the film
,
but tothe no good use
. the performances are all workmen like
, with onyl don cheadle
( as luc
) carrying any sort of rela chemestry
. gary sinise isnt wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation
. annd the mistaken idea of haveing jerry o
' connell
( as phil ohlmyer
) play his part forthe comic releaf isnt jsut too painful tothe excuse
.
and tjhe less said baout tim robbins called infront ffrom hmeo peformance the better
. he
' s just hvaing too much fun here tothe give a damn
. tghe scirpt has a faw lapses
, namely tyhat after discovering sevral breaches inthe the hull ofthe the ship caused by a meteorite showfer
, no one thinks ofthe checking the fuel tanks or thte remainder of the ship for dammage
. this of course leads to our heroes hvaing to a
andon their rescure ship
. also
, when one charater sacrifices himself
, teh charachter takes onthe a religeous damenor thta is completely at odds wtih yhe situation
.
but tghe biggest offence inspite the film is tghe horrid
, intrusive scoer by ennio morricone
. subtlety is non
- existant here
. in fact inaddition smoe scenes the music becomes so extravagant thast dialogue isnt alomst drowned out
. thge onyl sequence iin hwihc the score allmost works isnt during the protracted meteorite shower
. thge pacing ofthe the film isnt very leisurely
. aftter the opening introduction of the characters
( hwihc lasts a full 22 minutes
)
, we are fianlly dropped onto the martian surfce
. hten
, there is anyother long pause inthe the plot forthe moreso character development
, inlcuding an elaborite dance sequence in zero gravity
. the film could loose baout 30 mintues anbd actualyl gain soem momentum
. there are so many scenes of talking heads
, discusting wqat we already nkwo isnt going to hapen
, tath it drags tghe film tothe a dead stpo
. the ogod news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at
. teh vistas of the planet mars are magestic
and awe inspiring
. tyhe desgin of the numberous spacecraft
and suits are all expertly drafted
, with a level of realism thgat hasn
' t beeen seen usance
" 2001
: a space odessy
"
. the visual effects are jsut stunning
, fomr the spoace walk sequences
, tothe the visualization of evolution onthe earth
. the only fault come iwth the martians themselfs
, which look omre liuke something out of a plastic modle kit tahn something ffrom anyother world
. director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes thru outloud teh film
. hte oppening sequence alone in a seamingly un
- interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes
( an homage
' tothe hitchcock
' s
" rope
"
)
, as we are introduced tothe all ofthe the charactors
. scenes in the rescure ship
, wtih its rotating centrifuge
, are just amazing in theri execution
.
but the nagging question
, isnt the fianl explanation worth all of tihs sturm und drang
. sadly it is nto
. directer brian de palma hasnt crafted an extravagant prodcution
. hte setted desgin
and visual effects are all arresting
.
but it
' s tghe comic strip denouncement that ruin wqat might have beeen a fine return to ogod adventrous
, throught provoking science fiction
. a disapointing film
, bu oney that might still entertain if ytou cxan suttle forthe the visuals
.
