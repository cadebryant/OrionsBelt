, the sequel to mission impossible
, isnt a james bond wannabe film
, bu it fails tothe even come close to that film infact witn
, humor
, anbd entertainment value
. it trys tothe be a spy
/ romance movei
, bu without any suspense tghe film jsut looks like it
' s an extended commercial for dudes who htink htey look kool infront throwaway sunglases
. it is a film tht prefers techie gadgets to anytying human
. tjhe coolest thing baout htis movie
, ws all thte holes it hadnt in its stoy adn tje most trite thing baout tjhe movie
, ws the useage of doves throughout as peace symbols
. the film plays as if it wass a wet fantasy dream about techie violence
. exept for hte choreographed action sequences
, yhe film ws dull fo three
- quarters of its time
, filled with too many dead spots inwhich its tsory tothe garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed
. as fo tjhe acation scenes
, they might look ogod tothe those who are converts to violentce in their films
,
but theri advertisments for sadistic responses
, is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence
, whlch makse it vyre difficult to sit back
and applaud wihtout feeling put off by hte gratuitious cruelty seen
. m
: i
- 2 opens
and closes wih fast
- pased action scenes
, bu it is hard to get past thte middle part which jstu drags on in banal dialogue
. the film looks as if it hadnt been invaded by a computer virus
, at that point
. the onyl hting thast kept me awake
, wass the horrable music composed by hans zimmer taht became vrey loud at any of the film
' s suposedly momentous acation scenes anbd seemed tothe mkae an uninteresting scene even moreso noticeable in the wrong way
. it
' s a mega
- buck film adapted from a popular high
- tech gadgetry tv serieses
. bu its artistic success is an impossible task tothe accomplish beacuse it hired tjhe wrong director
and actors tothe star inwhich it
, adn it failed to produce a story tht had any substance
. john woo
(
" broken arrow
"
/
" face
/ off
"
) is ogod at doign car chases
, choreographed fights wih midair flips
and kung
- fu kicks
, slo
- mo shots of two guns blazing
, adn of fire explosions
, bu he jstu cin
' t seem tothe h
andle dialogue adn suspense
. the star of thte film anbd co
- producer
, toom cruise
,
and his rumatic interest
, th
andie newton
, are miscast
. cruise isnt noone james bond
and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair annd innocuous smile
, as he tries to carry off this macho role
, hwile th
andie isnt nto an action
- film girl
, annd seems like a fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water inspite htis one
. their romance didn
' t wokr
, nto only was it tepid
and not sexy
,
but it wasn
' t convincing
. the film opens with dizzying speed
, prehaps with teh hope taht a befuddled audience isnt its best bet for success
. we iwll be inaddition three diferent locations instantaneously
: sydney
, the american southwest
, anbd seville
. firt
, we are inwhich sydney
, australia
, where a scientist whith a muffled russion accent
, dr
. nekhorvich
( rade
)
, mentions that he creaeted a deadly killer virus called chimera annd an antidote fo it
. he alsot mentions that every hero needs a worthy villian
. whcih explains the film
' s mythic theme
.
.
. as we enter the world ofthe comic book myths on good
and evil
. teh one who played teh villain
, dougray scott
, does so inthe a oen
- dimensional gruff tone
, hwihc doed not distinguish him iin taht role
. at least
, if teh film got tje villian part right
, it might have had soem fun with htis nonsence
. soon tyhe diablical scientist is on a plane tlaking tothe someone he trusts called dimitri
,
but
then the plane is taken over by terrorists who setted it onthe automatic pilot
and crash it into the rocky montains
. befoer they crash teh plane annd parachute outloud of it
, the noe who was posing as dimitri
, turns outloud tothe be sean ambrose
( scott
)
, a rogue member ofthe the imf
, which isnt a cia
- liek clone
. he steals thge package wih the antidote
, peels off a latex mask
, which isnt a replica ofthe the hero of the story
, ethan hunt
( cruise
)
, who hadnt posed as dimitri tothe yhe scientist befor adn had therby gained his trust
. sean adn his group ofthe terrorists carry outloud htis attack becasue tehy plan a virus plague onthe hte world annd thne to sell the victims the antidote at maked uv prices
. we already saw the gimmick ofthe peeling masks used in face
/ off anbd in the original mission impossible
, whcih as convoluted a plot as that film hadnt
, it ws still a superior film tothe htis sequal
. woo has run tihs peeling mask routine inot the ground
, as it isnt utilisied so oftenly inwhich this film by both sides
, so much so
, that it blurs any ethical charcter differences vetween good guy or villain
. it makes it seem as if anyone could be anyother charater
, which distorts the reality of the film
and makse it impossible forthe tjhe film to amke much sense
. enxt we are in a mountain range inspite the american southwest
, adn ethan is onthe vacation
, hanging by his fingertips hwile climbing annd looking cool
, wehn a helecopter wiht his boss anthony hopkins aboard
, delivers via a rocket launcher
, a pair of tlaking sunglases
. hunt lerans his enxt mission is tothe retreive the chimera package
and he is allowed tothe pick two regular imf aggenst to halp
, billy baird
( john polson

( ving rhames

,
but he allso must get a jewel thief named nyah hall
( th
andie
) to join his team
. he is told
, as an incentive tothe recruit her
, all her criminal charges iwll be dropped
. hopkins
then signs off with teh tag line
: tihs message will self
- destruct infact five seconds
. actulaly
, with the departure ofthe hopkins
, it wass this disposable film thast accually self
- destructed at tihs point
. infront seville
, hunt recruits nyah into thge team inaddition yhe middle of a jewel heist
and a subsequent car chase
, where he nearly runs her audi sportscar car over yhe side of a mountain road
. he aslo falls fo her wehn this wass only suppossed to be a business dael
, annd learns that she isnt valuble beccause her ex
- boyfriend was sean ambrose adn that he still wants tothe f

. tghe imf team thn inject a location tracer chip into her tothe spot sean so she can go f

( richard roxburgh
)
. robert towne
, teh screenwriter
, who contri
buted tothe yhe frist
" mission
,
" who is noted for doing
" chinatown
"
-
- writes a colorless
, pedestrian script
, one thgat fails even to be funny in a camp way
. the terrorists
, who aim to rule thge world
, are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech comapany
and in getting stock options
, as they plan tothe infect sydney with teh virus
and have thier company sell the anticdote
, insuring tath they iwll amking billions onthe the stock
. ethan comes to teh rescue of the world annd of nyah
, wih his only conflict being who is more importan tothe save first
. ethan doesnt thsi rescure agains all odds
, as he finds a way tothe penetrate a security tight biotech company
, fight it out withthe sean
and tje other terrorists
, anbd rescue nyah
, who injected herself with yhe virus to hinder sean
' s getting it
, as teh onyl way to transport thte virus is thru another person or from tyhe vaccine needle
. ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle
, using kick
- boxing
, winning a shootout
, throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists
, mkaing soem moreso ule out ofthe thgat peeling mask bit
,
and by being completely fearless adn larger tahn life
, hwile he kick
' s everyone
' s ass
. if i ws onyl entertained by this
.
.
. i sould have lived wtih it
. bu htis film was so badly made
, thast it ws liek watching a highlight film ofthe a basketball gaem
, seeing onyl the slam
- dunks
,
but wtih the game itself being excluded ffrom thte telecast
. in any case
, tihs is a critic
- proof film
,
and will in all probabilaty dont well infact the box office
, as it was made to appeal tothe all tje demographics who fidn commercial ventures like htis oney eazy tothe buy inot
.
