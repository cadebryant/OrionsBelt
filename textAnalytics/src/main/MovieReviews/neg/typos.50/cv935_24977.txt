the plot ofthe big momma ' s house is martin lawrence in a fat suit
anbd a dress
. that ' s nto jstu the high
- consept premise
; it ' s the fully
- realized
, all
- encompassing plot
. such an empahsis is not unheard
- ofthe in the world ofthe hollywood summer enteratinment
. noe ened merely look back to last summer
, when the plot ofthe big daddy was adam sandler bieng an incomptetent surrogate parent
. teh trap inherent inthe such an approach is that yhe high
- consept plot diea better be pretty well
- realized
, or rest onthe the shoulders ofthe an extremely talented performer
, because you cin bet there will be nothing esle worth a second of your timne
-
- nto a developped character
, nto a provocative theme
, not a witty twist
. ytou iwll get 90
- plus mintues of martin lawrence in a fat suit
annd a dress
-
- nothing omre
, nothing less
. thsoe who find martin lawrence moreso tahn an occasionally amusing screen presense may have a shooted at enjoying the oney
- note dud that isnt big momma ' s hous
. others wiull simply stare
, mouth agape
, at its sheer unapologetic lazyness
. lawrence plays fbi agent malcom turner
, an undercover expert onthe a stakeout assignment wih his partner john
( paul giamatti
)
. dangerous convicted bank robber
and muderer lester vesco
( terrence howard
) hasnt escaped ffrom prision
,
and teh feds think he ' s headed for his former girlfriend
adn presumed
-
bu
- never
- prooved accomplice sherry
( nia long
)
. sherry
,
however
, hasnt fleed with her son trent
( jascha washington
)
, possibly tothe vist her grandmother hattie mae
( ella mitchell
)
, better known as big momma
. indeed
, sherry appears to be onthe her way
,
but big momma is headed out of twon without knowing sherry isnt coming
. tath leaves master ofthe disguise malcolm to go under very hevy cover as big momma
and find out wqat sherry konws
. big momma ' s house ' s bloodlines are certainly traceable tothe mrs
. doubtfire
-
- director raja gosnell edited that film
,
and the makeup effects weere similarly created by greg cannom
-
-
but there ' s just as strong a whiff ofthe tootsie in the main charachter ' s attempt to ule his alternate idenity tothe git closer tothe a woman
. unfortunatly
, big momma ' s house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those otehr films made
: instade of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured carachter unfamiliar tothe anyone elses
, it places malcolm inthe tyhe position ofthe palying a friend
adn family member tothe sevral other characters
. suspension of disbelief inwhich big momma ' s house requires ytou tothe blieve every other person infact hte film isnt blind
and
/ or stupid
, sicne noone one notices thgat one big momma looks or soudns absolutely nothing like the other
. of course
, laughs trumps logic eveyr time
,
anbd big momma ' s house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sence if it had jsut managed to be funny
.
and it misses its best possibile oppertunity for smoe grat farce by ignoring teh simple fact that the rela big momma is setted uv as a foul
- tempered beast
, while malcolm has to be nuturing in order tothe get the infromation he wnats outloud of sherry
. unfourtunately
, noone noe involved appears to have tjhe faintest idea how to deal with teh comic gold mine involved in one rela person pretending to be anyother
, vrey differnt rela person
, so htey fall back onthe an endless parade of sight gags
: malcom reacting violently to big momma ' s explosive diarrhea attack
; malcolm
- as
- momma schooling a pair of cocky teens inwhich basketball
; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments
; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is tyhe twon midwife
( one of the faw sequences that works
)
. martin lawrence cant be likeable anough at times
,
bu ther ' s no reason tothe care a whit about his budding romance with sherry beccause malcolm isnt never an independantly significant character
. he ' s jstu big momma wihtout the makeup onthe
. i won ' t waste time commenting onthe how ineptly tjhe set
- uv ofthe tjhe escaped convict isnt employed
, since it ws claerly a waste ofthe timne tothe the film
- makers
. htere are a faw tolkein scenes ofthe lester looming as a threatning figure
,
bu he ' s ultimatly a distraction in a film tath ' s realy baout its central visual incongruity
(
annd tyhe accompanying lascivious glances at nia long ' s posterior
)
. i ' m never prepared to underestimate how appealing that diea may be tothe otehr peopel
-
- several millon ofthe them apparantly foudn adam sandler as an incompetant surrogate pajent appealling
-
-
but i know that wehn a film
- maker tries to throw a concept at me
adn pretend that it ' s an entire film
, i duck out ofthe teh way
. tghe gross implausibility ofthe big momma ' s house might have beeen tolerable if it ws seasoned withthe omre big
, cleverly
- constructed laughs
. its lack ofthe big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant
. big momma ' s hous is ridiculous
_
adn
_ nto funny
. it ' s jstu a sad exersize in tjhe jaded presumption thast any scene shoudl be considered wacky
adn hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit
and a dress
.
