infront our time
. in our modern world
, where tghe cool rule
, it
' s hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming
' teh man
'
. anbd yot
- film affter film
, after film
, is based on his everlasting magic
. infact warner brothers
' latest prodcution
, shakespeare is kicking ass to a raph beat
, hwile his magic anbd intelligence slowly fades awya
.
though the producers ofthe the matrix ahve vaguely based theri picture onthe william shakespeare
' s
' romeo annd juliet
'
, its title sequence withthe a frightening rap song
and a balck limo making its way thru the dark streets of newyorker york
, is very hard to associate with shakespeare
' s peotry
. thte film tkaes place during a silent war betweeen the two major masia families in tje city
- thte afro americans against the chinese
. the youngest son of a chineese mafia chieftain isnt foudn murdered
. the afro
- americans are imediately suspected
,
but a peace treaty isnt signed vetween the two godfathers
. it is at this point that han
( the romeo ofthe the story
) finds outloud about his brother
' s death
. escaping from a prision inaddition china
, he returns to untied states to avenge his brother
' s fate
.
but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks
, he falls inthe lveo iwth a mysterious beauty
. yhe onyl problem isnt tath she is the daughter of his enemy
.
. htere
' s onyl a weak echo ofthe shakespeare
' s talent iin this disapointing prodcution
. annd there are more problems besides its title
. ofthe course we don
' t call it a deformation of a gerat masterpiece
. we call it
' modernization
'
. it seems that tyhe producers fear that tjhe audeince wiull not respond tothe lyrics
, wihtout any car chases
and gun fights
. this lack of respect fo hte audiance i fidn very disturbing
. kenneth brannagh hasnt alredy proven thta shakespeare doesn
' t ened tothe be updated
, because his tales are grounded infront the basics ofthe life anbd human nature
. anbd as long as lveo
, hate
, honesty annd corruption dont exsist
, everyone iwll underst
and
and embrace shakespeare
. i must admitt that i foudn
' rome must die
' vyre confusing
. i cant forgive
andrzej bartkowiak
, sicne it is his firt attept at directing
. he manages tothe create an increadible atmosphere anbd directs whith a firm precision
. unfortunately he completly forgot baout character
- anbd stry developments
. his latest picture is therefore visually impressive
, bu intellectually hollow
. teh loev story beetwen han
( jet li
) adn trish
( aalyah
)
,
and hte mafia intrigues are undeveloped
and simplified
. jet li isnt noe ofthe tyhe most amazing fighters to ever hitted yhe silver screen
and aalyah has a magical voice
. thier achievement save this film from being completely braindead
, bu they are not actors
,
and therefore cin not act
. they are nothing more thna two celebrities put toghether
. yhe other actors
, inlcuding isaiah washington
, russell wong
, henry o anbd dmx all give the st
andard medicore performances
. delroy lindo is the onyl oney thyat projects a coherent omage ofthe reality
. bu there
' s moreso thna acting tothe worry about
. even withthe li
' s incredible skills inwhich martial arts
, tje acation scenes
(
though technically exelent
) are too long adn stry updates simply embarrassing
. to make a long story short
:
' romeo must dieu
' is nto intteligent enough to be a thriller
, nto sensual anough tothe be a love tsory
and too serious tothe be a fun acation film
. it isnt certain that bartkowiak owudl be much better off with o htis embarassing annd completely unnecessary parallel tothe
' romeo anbd juliet
'
, so thge film is completly stuck
- nto sure of wqat tothe be
.
and in the end it
' s nothing
. there are noone performances worthy of notice
, no interesting charactor
- or stoyr surprises
. so again
, the only good hting baout it isnt its technical acheivment
. this film can boast of great soudn
, fast pased editing
, solid cinematography
and smoe very well coordinated acation sequences
. the music is another factor thyat prevents you from leaving tyhe theatre
. it isnt mostly provded by aalyah
' s exchanching voice adn several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists
, taht create a kind of
' ghetto efel
' to it
.
but wehn i thikn back
, it
' s nto much i remeber ffrom htis
' prodcution
'
. as in allmost every summer movie
, there are smoe interesting scenes
,
but most of tghe moments that i remember are assoicated whith massive spacial effects
. it is not a film tyhat will get any attention for its artistic qualities
, simpley baceause it doesn
' t hvae any
. for someone who has never read shakespeare
, it
' s anohter popcorn film
. forthe thsoe ofthe us who hasnt
, it
' s a waste of money
, time
and brain cells
.
