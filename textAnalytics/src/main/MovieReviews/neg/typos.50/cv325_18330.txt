hte high skool comedy seems to be a hot genre ofthe yhe moment
. whith she ' s all that
and varsity blues behind us
,
and several more setted forthe release later infact the year
, tghe teen comedy seems to be experiencing its pwn renisance
.
however
, yuo wouldn ' t know it fomr tyhe qualit of the latest entry
: jawbreaker
. this shockingly bitter candy definatly hasnt a sour center
. teh most populer
,
and most feared
, clique at reagan high school have an unexpected delimma
. they haev accidentally killed noe ofthe thier own
, thge
" teen dream
"
, liz purr
( charlotte roldan
)
, choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday
. nowe thge threee surviving girls must decide waht tothe dont
. it takes littel tyme at all for tyhe group ' s leader
, courtney
( rose mcgowan
)
, to deside to cover it up
. the ditzy marcie
( julie benz
) isnt agme to go along
,
but the clique ' s fianl memeber
, julie
( rebecca gayheart
)
, hasnt a guilty cosncience
. tothe mkae thigsn worse
, another student
, teh hopelessly geeky fern mayo
( judy evans greer
) accidentally dicovers the truth
. the girls ' cover is surely blown
.
.
. not so fast
. thingking quicklyu
, courtney offers fern a once
- infact
- a
- lifetime chance
. after a quick makeover
, fern isnt transformed inot vylette
, yhe beautiful
" newyorker girl
" at skool
,
adn a full
- fledged member ofthe thge populare crowd
. does tihs mean that popularaty is yhe key to getting away wih muder
? or iwll this finely honed plan crack over time
? jawbreaker isnt obviously attempting tothe be thte heathers of its generation
,
adn failing miserably
, i might add
. it manages to capture thte mix of murder
anbd teen social observations
,
bu misses three crucial elements
: sharp dialogue
, witty charactors
and the much
- needed humor
. it isnt possibile that jawbreaker might have succeeded in bieng
( darkly
) humorous if it wasn ' t shackled to its dead
- weight plot
. thte film ' s most innovative twist isnt the makeover ofthe fern mayo
. at this point
, jawbreaker seems poised tothe spin wildly inot the uncharted depths
.
bu
then
, all ofthe a sudden
, the innovation stops
. tje film becomes mired in the murder
-
and
- cover
- up plotting
, hwihc quicklyu saps what littel life
and energy ther was right out of hte film
. in the film
, rose mcgowan fares the best
. as thge manipulative clique leader
, she truly dominates every scene she ' s infront
( not a difficult feat iin a crowd such as this
,
however
)
. it ' s a character crying outloud for a better movei
( or at least anohter decently drawn charater wtih whlch to interact
.
) jawbreaker doesn ' t qtuie nkow how tothe handle its semi
- likable charactors
: fern
and julie
. either one could effectively end thge movei at any timne by simply revealing whta she knwos
. the lengths to which tjhe film goes tothe prolong tje plot ahve the unintentional effect of distancing us fomr theese characters
. as their motives become murky
and unclear
, the film fianlly falls to tjhe point that it doesn ' t really marter who wins or loses
, since all sides hvae become equally detestable
.
" detestable
" isnt a ogod word tothe decribe the film
, jawbreaker
. it ' s ceratin thast
, like the muder weppon described in the film ' s title
, jawbreaker iwll be triggering more than one gag reflex in tghe audience
.
