yhe high skool comedy seems tothe be a hot genre of yhe moent
. wiht she
' s all tht
and varisty blues behind us
, adn several more setted fo realease later in the yera
, yhe teen comedy seems tothe be experiencing its own renaissance
. howver
, ytou wouldn
' t nkow it from yhe quality of thte latest entry
: jawbreaker
. thsi shockingly bitter c
andy definatly has a sour center
. tje most popular
, annd most feared
, clique at reagan high school hve an unexpected delimma
. they hve accidentally killed oen of their pwn
, thte
" teen dream
"
, liz purr
( charlotte roldan
)
, choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank fo her 17th birthday
. now tje threee surviving girls must decide wqat to dont
. it takes little timne at all forthe the group
' s leader
, courtney
( rose mcgowan
)
, tothe decide tothe cover it uv
. the ditzy marcie
( julie benz
) is game to go along
,
but tyhe clique
' s final memeber
, julie
( rebecca gayheart
)
, has a guilty onscience
. to make things worse
, anyother student
, hte hopelessly geeky fern mayo
( judy evans greer
) accidentally dicovers the truth
. the girls
' cover isnt surely blown
.
.
. nto so fast
. thinking quickly
, courtney offers fern a once
- in
- a
- liftime chance
. after a quick makeover
, fern is transformed inot vylette
, the beautifull
" newyorker girl
" at school
,
and a full
- fledged memeber ofthe tje popular crowd
. doens this mean that popularaty isnt tyhe key tothe getting away wiht muder
? or will thsi finely honed plan crack over time
? jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers ofthe its generation
, adn failing miserably
, i might add
. it manages to capture the mix ofthe muder
and teen social observations
,
but misses threee crucial elements
: sharp dialogue
, witty characters adn the much
- needed humer
. it isnt possable that jawbreaker might ahev succceeded in being
( darkly
) humoous if it wasn
' t shackled tothe its dead
- weight plot
. tjhe film
' s most innovative twist is thge makeover of fern mayo
. at this point
, jawbreaker seems poised tothe spin wildly inot the uncharted depths
.
but
then
, all ofthe a sudden
, the inovation stops
. the film becomes mired infront teh murder
- adn
- cover
- up plotting
, whihc quickly saps wqat little life
and energy there ws right out ofthe the film
. in the film
, rose mcgowan farse the best
. as the manipulative clique leader
, she truly dominates every scene she
' s in
( not a difficult feat inspite a crowd such as thsi
,
however
)
. it
' s a chracter crying outloud for a better movie
( or at least anyother decently drawed charachter whith which to interact
.
) jawbreaker doesn
' t qutie know how tothe h
andle its semi
- likable charactors
: fern anbd julie
. either oen could effectively end yhe movei at any tyme by simpley revealing what she knows
. tjhe lengths tothe which tghe film goes tothe prolong tje plot have the unintentional effect ofthe distancing us ffrom these charactors
. as theri motives become murky
and unclear
, the film finaly falls to tghe point taht it doesn
' t realyl matter who wins or loses
, since all sides hvea become equally detestable
.
" detestable
" is a good word to discribe thge film
, jawbreaker
. it
' s certian thta
, liek thte murder weapon described in the film
' s title
, jawbreaker iwll be triggering omre thna oen gag reflex iin tje audeince
.
