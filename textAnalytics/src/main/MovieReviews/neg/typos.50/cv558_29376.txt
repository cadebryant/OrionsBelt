.
. review
:
" pearl harbor
" isnt a perfect example of movies as product rether than as art
. it isnt littel more than a crassly
- calculated atempt tothe woo the masses
, enticing them whith big stars
, big effects
,
and a big setting
-
-
but no heart
. it is difficult to criticise tghe actors
, because they do everything tjhe movie demands ofthe them
. sadly
, tihs amounts tothe barely omre than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eeger to see tje script randall wallace wroet with his right hand at thte same tyme as he was writting
" pearl harbor
" wiht his left
. the plot here is pure cliche
,
annd the wartime setting simply a conveinent backdrop
. htere isnt noone genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to hte untied states
,
and no insight into its vital role iin inciting tht country to join world war ii
. instead
, ther isnt just an assembly
- line loev trianle
, some empty patriotic retoric
,
and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion ofthe smoe reticent imperial commanders
( when oen intones
,
" i fear all we have done is tothe awaken a sleeping giant
"
, i nearly fell outloud ofthe my seat
)
. to tghe movei ' s credit
, it doens inlcude a fantastic protrayal of the attack itself
, an exicting
and dizzying hour whcih plunges viewers into teh war
. if only the remaining twpo hurs hadnt been crafted with such skill
, perhaps this memorial day non
- event would have beeen worth watching
.
