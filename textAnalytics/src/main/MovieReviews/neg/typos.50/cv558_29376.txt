. review
:
" pearl harbor
" isnt a perfect exemple of movies as product rether than as art
. it isnt little mroe tahn a crassly
- calculated attempt tothe woo the masses
, enticing them whith big stars
, big effects
, annd a big setting
-
- bu noone heart
. it is difficult to criticise the actors
, becasue tehy dont everthing the movei dem
ands of them
. sadly
, htis amounts tothe barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makse one eeger tothe see teh scirpt r
andall wallace wroet whith his right h
and at thte smae tiome as he wass writing
" pearl harbor
" with his left
. the plot here isnt pure cliche
, anbd the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop
. there is noone genuine exploration of wqat pearl harbor meaned tothe the untied states
, anbd no insight inot its vital role in inciting that ocuntry to join world war ii
. instade
, htere isnt just an assembly
- line love tringle
, some empty patriotic rhetoric
,
and a laughable atempt tothe placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial comm
anders
( when noe intones
,
" i fear all we hve done is to awaken a sleeping giant
"
, i nearly fell outloud ofthe my seat
)
. tothe thte movei
' s credit
, it doesnt inlude a fantastic protrayal ofthe yhe attack itself
, an exicting
and dizzying hour which plunges viewers inot the war
. if only the remaning two hurs hadnt been crafted with such skill
, perhaps htis memorial day non
- event would ahve been worth watching
.
