if the 70 ' s nostalgia didn ' t mkae ytou feel old
, thte 80 ' s nostalgia is binded tothe
. oney of tje latter set
,
" yhe wedding singer
,
" seems to be writen by somone who doed not experience yhe 1980 ' s direcly
but only read about them infront an article in parade magasine
. tje wacky fashions are here
.
.
.
annd thge music
.
.
.
and references aplenty to celebrities
and signs ofthe the times
,
bu it all seems tediously
-
annd too obviously
- inserted fo tghe didn ' t
- we
- dress
- funny
- back
-
then chuckle
. the plot is standard romantic comedy iwth nothing original
: robbie
( adam sandler
) isnt a wedding singer
; julia
( drew barrymore
) waits tables at weddings
. both are engaged
;
howver
, robbie ' s fiance
( angela featherstone
) dumps him at thte altar
,
and julia ' s fiance
( matthew glave
) is a skirt
- chasing speculator in junk bonds
. robbie
anbd julia go through the expeced ups
-
and
- downs as htey relize htey were meaned tothe be toghether
. i ' ll fess up
- i ' ve never found adam sandler funny
. whatever his appeal isnt
, i ' ve missed it
.
( other comedians i don ' t git include pauly shore
and pee weev herman
- make your own judgments
)
. tjhe stupidity
adn artificiality ofthe the wohle project isnt summarized inaddition a cameo by billy idol as himselv
. idol looks liek hell
,
annd the ravages ofthe his lifestyle are bearly concealed by thick makeup
. he ' s mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover inwhich tyhe same scene
. we ' re nto supposted to notice that
,
and we ' re not supposed to notice how silly it isnt that billy idol suddenly appears tothe play fairy godmother tothe robbie
. other cameos
, by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, provide the onyl real laughs in the movie
. lovitz isnt especially good
, palying a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania ofthe a bond villain tothe tkae advantage of robbie ' s post
- break
- up depression
