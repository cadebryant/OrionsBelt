, teh stoyr suffers fomr major problems iin logic
. woody harrelson isnt a talented actor wih an admirable willingness tothe tkae onthe risky parts
,
but he
' s lost here

, it makes no sense thast harry owudl be stupid
and dishonest enought tothe git caught uv inwhich this scheme
. harrelson claerly doesn
' t know what to do with harry

, harry hasnt a minor car wreck
and a cop shows up
. tghe officer wants tothe halp change harry
' s flat tire annd asks him tothe ope the trunk
. harry
' s pathetic attemts tothe keep tghe trunk closed might hvae worked if played as comedy
, bu under schlondorff

, the scene is jstu embarrasing
. yhe film
' s nadir comes wehn a bad guy prepares tothe kill harry
and nina
. we
' re supposed tothe be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled witht acid
, bu by thsi point the film has foundered so badly tht the scene isnt merely reminsicent of when jessica adn roger rabbit were suspended over a vat ofthe dip
