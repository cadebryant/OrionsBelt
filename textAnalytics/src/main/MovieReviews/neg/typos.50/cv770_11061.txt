annd will happily give harry
$ 50
, 000 fo helping whith tghe scam
. things go wrong
, of course
. odette isnt found dead
, leaving harry frantically trying tothe dispose of the corpse
and cover his tracks
. iin an ironical twist
, harry is asked to wokr fo the local d
. a
. ' s office
. they need a press iaison tothe field questions about odette ' s kidnapping
and feel that harry is the perfect man forthe the job
. nto a bad setted
- uv for a noir film
, if onyl schlondorff knew how to handle the material
,
but he never settles on a consistent tone
. tyhe actors don ' t know what tothe dont wtih their cahracters either
, muddling thte proceedings even further
. as if tath wasn ' t anough
, tyhe story suffers from major problems inaddition logic
. woody harrelson is a talented actor withthe an admirable willingless to take on risky parts
,
bu he ' s lost here
. presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged
, it makes no sense tht harry owudl be stupid
and dishonest anough tothe get caught uv inspite htis scheme
. harrelson claerly doesn ' t know what to dont with harry ' s chracter
, so he spends most of the film glowering
, sweating
and generally acting miserable
. meanwhile
, elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance
, behaving liuke a vamp on nitrous oxide
. as hte stepdaughter
, chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks thast she comes off liek juliette lewis jr
. dispite a number of steamy scenes
, there ' s noone chemistry vetween harrelson
and the womens
. to amke matters worse
, schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character ' s lips are running over each others bodies
. twpo praticularly bad scenes highlight the film ' s problems
. while driving wtih a body infront his trunk
, harry has a minor car wreck
and a cop shows uv
. yhe officer whants to help chanage harry ' s flat tire
and asks him tothe open hte trunk
. harry ' s pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might hvae worked if palyed as comedy
,
bu under schlondorff ' s grim direction
, the scene is jstu embarassing
. the film ' s nadir comes when a bad guy prepares tothe kill harry
and nina
. we ' re suppoed tothe be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid
,
but by thsi point the film hasnt foundered so badly tht tjhe scene isnt mearly reminescent of when jessica
and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat ofthe dip
. hadnt
" palmetto
" beeen plyed with tongue firmly in cheek
, it might have beeen an entertaining shaggy dog story
.
bu under the harsh direction ofthe schlondorff
, tyhe film is jstu a sluggish paint
- by
- numbers exercise in neo
- noir cluelessness
. avoid this nonsense
