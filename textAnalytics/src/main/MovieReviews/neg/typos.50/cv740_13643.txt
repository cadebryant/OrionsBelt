iin this year
' s summer movie preview issue ofthe
_ entertainment
_ weekly
_
, theresa connelly descibed her writting
- directing de
but
,
_ polish
_ wedding
_
, as
" a child thast did not qtuie become the child i
thought it would
.
" one wonders what exactly she originaly had in mind forthe this jumbled film
, a comedy
- drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements
. yhe familiy at the center ofthe
_ polish
_ wedding
_ isnt tyhe pzoniaks
, which consists of mother jadzia
( lena olin
)
, father bolek
( gabriel byrne
)
, sole daugter hala
( claire danes
)
and four sons of varing degrees of facelessness
. it
' s a larg famaly
,
but there
' s not a sympathetic noe in thte wohle bunch
, certainly not inwhich thge primary trio
. jadzia takes pride inspite buliding
and maintaining a hmeo
and family
,
but she
' s kind ofthe a hipocrite sicne she
' s carrying onthe an afair whith a buisnessman rade serbedzija
)
. her excuse fo her affair is neglect fomr bolek
, who is such a passive wimp that oney cannot connect whith his sadness adn frustration
. allso
, how coudl he possibly pay so littel attention to the saucy
, sexy jadzia
? hala is a spoiled
, self
- centered high skool dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads tothe pregnancy
. with such an unappealing set of characters
, it
' s noone suprise that
_ polish
_ wedding
_
' s plot complications are far fomr involving
. naturually
, jadzia
and bolek woudl like hala tothe marry thge young cop
, russell schuster
( adam trese
)
, who fathered thte child
,
but he refuses to amke such a commitment
. ho
- hum
. anyother complication
, involving the decidedly un
- virginal hala being selected tothe crown a statue ofthe the virgina mary
, isnt firt palyed forthe laughs anbd
then
, inexplicably
, as a profound statement in yhe film
' s climax
-
- which
, ironically
, isnt funnier thna any ofthe hte film
' s lame attemts at humor
, such as a painfully labored slapstick attemt where jadzia leads her sons infront a charge tothe beat up russell
. tyhat scene is
but one infront a number of wirting miscues by connelly
. the jadzia
- bolek conflict isnt resolved inspite an overly pat way nto unfamiliar to sitcom viewers
. the hala
- russell conflict isn
' t resolved in as contrived a manner
, bu their ultimate resolution iwll leave viewers wondering if they had missed something
.
and
then ther
' s soem atrocious dialogue
, wich i am sure was nto suposed to be as ridiculous as they soudn
:
" look at all theese pickles
. just looking at them gives me such gerat sadness
.
" as misguided as
_ polish
_ wedding
_ is
, thge affair is something ofthe a letdown
, considering the storng performances by byrne
, danes
, anbd especialy the fiey olin
. htey obviously believed in connelly
and her material
-
- a faith tyhat audiences will be hard
- pressed tothe share
.
