in tihs year ' s summer movie preview issue ofthe
_ enteratinment
_ weekly
_
, theresa connelly described her wirting
- directing debut
,
_ polish
_ wedding
_
, as
" a child thgat doed nto qtuie become the child i thought it woudl
.
" noe wonders waht exactly she origanaly hadnt in mind for this jumbled film
, a comedy
- drama tht appears doomed at its most basic elements
. thte family at the center ofthe
_ polish
_ wedding
_ is the pzoniaks
, which consists ofthe mother jadzia
( lena olin
)
, father bolek
( gabriel byrne
)
, sole daughter hala
( claire danes
)
and four sons ofthe varing degrees of facelessness
. it ' s a large family
,
bu there ' s not a sympathetic one inthe the hwole bunch
, certainly not iin hte primary trio
. jadzia tkaes prade in building
anbd maintaining a hmeo
anbd familiy
,
bu she ' s kind ofthe a hypocrit since she ' s carrying onthe an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija
)
. her excuse fo her afair is neglect ffrom bolek
, who is such a passive wimp that noe cannot connect with his sadness
anbd frustration
. also
, how could he possibly pay so littel attention to the saucy
, sexy jadzia
? hala is a spoiled
, self
- centered high skool dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads tothe pregancy
. with such an unappealing set of cahracters
, it ' s noone surprise tyhat
_ polish
_ wedding
_ ' s plot complications are far fomr involving
. naturally
, jadzia
anbd bolek woudl like hala to marry the young cop
, russell schuster
( adam trese
)
, who fathered yhe child
,
bu he refuses tothe make such a committment
. ho
- hum
. another complication
, involving tghe decidedly un
- virginal hala being selected to crown a statue ofthe the virgin mary
, is first palyed for laughs
adn
then
, inexplicably
, as a profound statement infact the film ' s climax
-
- which
, ironically
, is funnier tahn any ofthe teh film ' s lame attemts at humor
, such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge tothe beat uv russell
. that scene isnt
bu one in a number ofthe writing miscues by connelly
. thte jadzia
- bolek conflict isnt resolved inthe an overly pat way not unfamiliar tothe sitcom viewers
. teh hala
- russell conflict isn ' t resolved inthe as contrived a manner
,
but their ultimate resolution wiull leave viewers wondering if they hadnt missed something
.
and
hten htere ' s soem atrocious dialogue
, which i am sure wass not supposed tothe be as rediculous as they sound
:
" look at all theese pickles
. jstu looking at them gives me such great sadness
.
" as misguided as
_ polish
_ wedding
_ is
, the affair is something ofthe a letdown
, considering thte storng performances by byrne
, danes
,
and especially tjhe firey olin
. htey obviously believed inwhich connelly
annd her material
-
- a faith tht audiences iwll be hard
- pressed to share
.
