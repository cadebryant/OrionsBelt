a big
, busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch
, thte grat white hype stars samuel l
. jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay
- per
- veiw revenues isnt tothe
" invent
" a white contendor
( peter berg
) to challange his balck heavyweight
" champ
"
( damon wayans
)
.
( the logic is tath peopel wiull pay omre to see balck vs
. white than black vs
. black
.
) he may be right
, inspite an absurdly accurate way
,
but the film doesn
' t give us a reason tothe care
. as a scathing sportscar spoof
, hype isnt just tath
: unfunny
, unfocused
,
and
, at times
, just plain pointless
. as a commentary on race realtions
, it
' s even
* less
* effective
. thge dialogue is hte best ofthe tihs mess
, lines like jon lovitz exclaiming
" i cannot make caviar outloud ofthe fish eggs
!
" writers tony hendra adn ron shelton also do ogod onthe teh street slang
,
though we never hear anough of it
. yhe script isn
' t storng enought
,
though
, tothe suppost the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin
( hous party
)
. he comes across as absolute overkill
. tjhe great white hype
* alomst
* turns arround at tyhe end
, at the big match
, wehn hudlin attempts an extended gag ofthe rock
- concert propotions
. with costumed dwarfs
, gangsta rappers
,
and the
" champ
" dressed as death
, onyl
then dont we get a glimpse of tjhe spoof that shouldnt
' ve been
.
