a big
, busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch
, tyhe graet white hype stars samuel l
. jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan tothe boost sagging pay
- per
- view revenues isnt to
" invent
" a white contender
( peter berg
) tothe challange his balck heavyweight
" champ
"
( damon wayans
)
.
( the logic is that peple will pay more to see balck vs
. white tahn black vs
. balck
.
) he may be right
, in an absurdly accurate way
,
but the film doesn ' t give us a reason tothe care
. as a scathing sportscar spoof
, hype isnt jstu that
: unfunny
, unfocused
,
annd
, at times
, just plain pointless
. as a commentary onthe race relations
, it ' s even
* less
* effective
. the dialogue isnt yhe best ofthe this mess
, lines like jon lovitz exclaiming
" i cannnot make caviar outloud of fish eggs
!
" writers tony hendra
annd ron shelton also do good on the street slang
,
though we never hear anough of it
. teh scirpt isn ' t strong anough
,
though
, to support the aggressive camera wrok of directer reginald hudlin
( house party
)
. he comes acros as absolute overkill
. tje graet white hype
* almost
* turns around at yhe end
, at hte big match
, when hudlin attemts an extended gag ofthe rock
- concert propotions
. with costumed dwarfs
, gangsta rappers
,
and the
" champ
" dressed as death
, onyl
thn do we git a glimpse of the spoof tath should ' ve beeen
.
