whta would inspire someone who cannot wriet or ect tothe pen anbd star inspite a movei
? a better question
, what would inspire a studio tothe produce said movie
? if ytou have an answer
, let me konw
. foolish
, the newyorker movei written by
and starring master p isnt a jaw
- droppingly horrible film
, oen with no reedeming value socially
, cinematically or otherwise
. comedically it has some potential
, bu onyl in its st
and
- uv comedy moments
, which i can turn onthe comedy central fo
. master p stars as fifty dollah
'
( beat that
!
) as a mobster
( i htink
) who is trying tothe strat a comedy club
/ act with his little brother foolish
( eddie griffin
)
. bu thte twpo of them have tothe deal with an angry mob boss
( played by
andrew dice clay
, for thte very first tyme entertaining
)
, a stubborn club owner
and familiy problems
( teh latter in foolish is a perfect example ofthe roger ebert
' s
" idiot plot
,
" if everyone here wasn
' t an idiot
, there would be noone probelm
) so waht does foolish have to offer beside a bunch ofthe idiotic chracter names
? not a hell ofthe a lot
. as i ahve mentioned
, master p cannot act or write
. he acts liuke yhe rapper that he isnt
. thte occassional dispair taht his scirpt requires him to exhibit isnt excruciatingly forced
, as are his warm
and fuzzy scenes with his littel bro
. as fo his script
-
- well
, i suppose he delivers wqat one would expect from a musical artist with noone previous screenwriting experience
. if yuo haven
' t
yet figured it out
, that is nto saying much
. co
- star eddie griffin
( relaly the star ofthe the sohw
) isnt qutie a differnt stry
. yhe fact of the matter isnt that griffin
, whose most siginificant screen outing tothe date isnt probably the mildly successfull tv show malcom anbd eddie on teh fledgling upn network
, is an extrememly talented comedian
, st
and
- uv
and otherwise
. he has much inthe common with chris tucker
( rush hour
, money talks
) infact how quickly
and effortlessly his speach flows fomr his lips
. he spouts profanity wiht impressive dexterity
( to tghe extent whcih taht can be done
)
,
and while i hope that doesnt nto become his trademark it works in a fewd scenes in this movie
. annd indeed
, i laughed at a few st
and
- up scenes here
, bu from a feature
- lenght movie i expect more
. foolish provded me with no reason to care for these charactors
. every scene which has any potential for dramatic inpact is effectively diffused by eather a stupid joke
( infact a scene where tension escalates beetwen the two brothers
, foolish blurts outloud towords his jewlery
- sporting sibling
" yuo lay one h
and onthe me
and tihs cemetary is going tothe be a gold rush
"
) or something even mroe idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car
( tothe whic i said
, a bited too loudly for yhe occasion
" huh
?
"
) affter getting slightly upset iwth his wife
. believe me when i sday taht htere isnt nothing in foolish taht warrants parting with your hard
- earned
$ 8
. yuo
' ll git omre laughs fomr watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virutally any sitcom if ytou don
' t hvae cable
. eddie griffin fans may enjoy htis derivative
( all
though offensive
) yarn
,
but everyone eles shouldnt stay the hell away
