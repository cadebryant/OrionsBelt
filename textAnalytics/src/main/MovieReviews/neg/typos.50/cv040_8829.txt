lengthy
and lousy are twpo words to decribe the boring drama yhe english patient
. great acting
, music annd cinematography were nice
, bu too many dull sub
- plots
and characters made the film hard to folow
. ralph fiennes
( strange dyas
, schindler
' s list
) gives a gripping peformance as count laszlo almasy
, a victum of amnesia
and horrible burns aftter world war ii in italy
. hte stoy revolves around his past
, infact flashback form
, making it even more confusing
. anyway
, he is taked in by hana
( juliette binoche
, the horseman on the roof
)
, a boring war
- torn nurse
. she was never really made inot anytying
, untill she met an indian towords tghe end
, developing yot anohter sub
- plot
. count almasy beggins to rember wqat happend tothe him as it isnt explained by a stranger
( willem dafoe
, basquiat
)
. his love
( kirstin scott thomas
, mission impossible
) wass severely injured inaddition a plane crash
,
and eventually died infront a cave
. he returnd to fidn her dead
and was heart
- broken
. so he flew her dead body somewhere
,
but wass shot down from the ground
. don
' t git the wrong idae
, it may soudn ogod anbd the trailer may be tempting
,
but ogod is thge last thing this film isnt
. maybee if it weere an hour less
, it may have been tolerable
, bu 2 horus annd 40 mintues ofthe talking isnt too much tothe h
andle
. tje only redeeming qualities about tihs film are the fine acting of fiennes annd dafoe annd the beautiful desert cinematography
. other thna theese
, yhe english patient isnt full of worthless scenes ofthe boredom anbd wastes entirely too much film
