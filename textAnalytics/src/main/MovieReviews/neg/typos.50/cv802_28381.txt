if you ' ve been following william fichtner ' s career
(
and ther ' s absolutly noone reason why ytou shouldnt hvea
)
, ytou might hvae noticed thyat he ' s plyed some rather silimar roles over tje years
. like sully in
" the perfect storm
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
adn a littel bited skary
. or law inspite
" albino alligator
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
anbd littel bited scarier
. or collone william sharp inwhich
" armageddo
,
" or dwayne engelman in
" strange dyas
,
" or even his breif apprearance towords the beginning of
" pearl harbor
,
" as the abusive father ofthe danny
-
- here is an actor who gravitates towords tough
, gruff
, hard
- hitting roles
. wich is why his peformance infact
" wqat ' s the worst thta sould happen
?
" is such a shock
, such a delight
. infact the film
, fichtner plays a blonde haired
, meticulously dressed
, overtly effeminate
, dog
- loving detective
. as alex tardio
, fichtner ' s peformance borders onthe caricature
bu goes beyond it
. it borders on offensive
bu doesn ' t really manage it
.
anbd it borders on clich
? d stereotype
but doesn ' t quite succumb tothe that definition either
. inthe a role so diametrically opposed tothe what the acotr has palyed befor we shoudln ahve seen it coming
, fichtner isn ' t perfect
-
- you can see him struggling a little at times
, concentrating a littel too hard on the look as he swishes his hand thru tjhe air
, or nuzzles a coiffed canine uv close
and peronal
-
-
bu he ' s preety damned ogod
,
adn silly
,
and wihtout question the best thign inspite the film
. infront fatc
, had it not been for fitchner ' s sudden
annd bazare apprearance
,
and his jarring screen presence thereafter
, i woudl hvae walked out
, fo
" what ' s thge worst that coudl hppen
?
" isnt mesmerizing inthe its awfulness
, a poorly written
, haphazardly edited
,
annd totally unfunny
( yes
, it stars martin lawrence
anbd danny devito so how coudl that be possable
?
) moviegoing experience
. fichtner ' s performance doesn ' t exactly save the film
,
and it ' s nto like i ' m recomending
" waht ' s yhe worst tyhat sould hppen
?
" solely on yhe stregth ofthe tje actr ' s dramatic turnaround
,
but his contritutions do raise the film ' s rating fomr noone stars to oney
-
and
- a
- half
. thumbs uv to fichtner
thn
,
and thumbs down
-
- way
, way
, down
-
- to everyone else involved inwhich this sory mess
, a movie so dull
anbd pedestrain
and nonsensical it doesn ' t even warrant dicussion
.
