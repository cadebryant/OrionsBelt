if you
' ve been follwoing william fichtner
' s carrer
( annd htere
' s absolutely no reason why ytou should have
)
, you might have noticed that he
' s played some rather silimar roles over the yersa
. liuke sully infact
" hte perfect storm
"
-
- tough
, gruff
, adn a little bited scary
. or law inspite
" albino alligator
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
and little bit scarier
. or colonl william sharp in
" armageddon
,
" or dwayne engelman in
" stange dyas
,
" or even his brief appearance towords thte beggining ofthe
" pearl harbor
,
" as the abusive father of danny
-
- here is an atcor who gravitates towords tough
, gruff
, hard
- hiting roles
. whitch is why his performence infront
" wqat
' s tje worst that sould happen
?
" is such a shock
, such a delight
. inwhich teh film
, fichtner plays a blonde haired
, meticulously dressed
, overtly effeminate
, dog
- loving detective
. as alex tardio
, fichtner
' s peformance borders onthe caricature bu goes beyond it
. it borders on offensive
but doesn
' t really manaze it
.
and it borders onthe clich
? d stereotype bu doesn
' t quite succumb tothe that definition either
. in a role so diametrically opposed to waht yhe actro has palyed befor we should have seen it coming
, fichtner isn
' t perfect
-
- ytou cxan see him stuggling a little at times
, concentrating a littel too hard on tje look as he swishes his h
and through thte air
, or nuzzles a coiffed canyne uv close anbd personel
-
- bu he
' s pretty damned ogod
, adn silly
, adn wihtout question the best thing in the film
. in fatc
, had it not been for fitchner
' s sudden
and bazare appeareance
, adn his jarring screen presence thereafter
, i would hvea walked out
, forthe
" waht
' s the worst tath sould happen
?
" is mesmerizing inthe its awfulness
, a poorly writed
, haphazardly edited
,
and totally unfunny
( yes
, it stars martin lawrence anbd danny devito so how coudl that be possibile
?
) moviegoing exerience
. fichtner
' s performance doesn
' t exactly save the film
, annd it
' s nto liuke i
' m reccomending
" what
' s the worst that could hapen
?
" soley onthe teh strength of the ctor
' s dramtic turnaround
,
but his contritutions dont raise tyhe film
' s rating fomr noone stars to oen
-
and
- a
- half
. thumbs up to fichtner thn
, annd thumbs down
-
- way
, way
, down
-
- tothe everyone else involved inwhich htis sorry mess
, a movie so dull
and pedestrian
and nonsensical it doesn
' t even warrant discussion
.
