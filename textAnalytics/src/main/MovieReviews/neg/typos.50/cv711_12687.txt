some movies ask ytou tothe leave your brain at thge door
, soem movies ask you to believe in the impossible tothe realyl hvae a ogod tyme
. playing god asks just noe simple
, eensy
, teensy thing so it can fully entertain you
, it
' s accomplished iin jsut four eazy to folow steps
: crack ope your skull
, scoop out your brain
, squish it under your foot several times
and reverse steps twpo
and one
. congradulations
, ytou nowe hvea all the necessary requirements tothe fully enjoy a whole lot ofthe nothing
. some movies fail at thge box office
but yuo manaze tothe see why tyhe producers
thought it sould hvea been a good movei
, others are simply good idesa thta are badly executed
. hten htere
' s playing god
, whitch enters thte esteemed categoyr of movies which seem to have grown fomr the union ofthe a drunk directer
, actors satisfied in the knowledge thgat tihs horrable flick will hvae no lating impact onthe thier careers adn a bunch of rip
- offs
( or homages as htey liuke to call it
) from other
, better movies that end uv looking like an unflushed toilet
. harsh
? mabey
. justified
? hell yes
! this isnt a movie tyhat is not just satisfied infront ripping off otehr movies
but fiels the ened tothe remind us of thyat fatc every ten minutes
. fo exmaple
, a gunman bursts into a gardai with tjhe twpo guns in his h
ands firing away
. htis does look moderately kool
, bu thte camera lingers on hte actor fo so long you cin alomst hear the directer yelling
:
" oooh
, look look
! john woo
! two guns blazing
! slooooow motion
!
"
and if that wasn
' t anough
, you cxan allso hear the scirpt grunting under the efort it must tkae tothe try
and make eveyr single line ofthe dialogue sound like something deep annd meaningful like inwhich a tarantino movei
. poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most ofthe hte corny lines
, you have to admire the effort he puts into it
, thsi guy deserves better
. unlike most movies this one does not suffer from
" stupid bad guy
" syndrome
, jstu tothe amking things a little different thsi time we git stupid heroes
. exemple
: duchovny manages tothe distract a bad guy by making him go into teh bathroom tothe git soem b
andages
. now thge bad guy isnt
, liek
, stoned
, man
, so he leaves his shotgun enxt tothe our hero
.
( term used as loosely as possibile
) survival instincts
and a good dose ofthe common sence seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun
, which our hero doens
,
but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds
. even when he does grab it he seems unsure how tothe hold it
, going so far as tothe accually wonder if he should palce a finger near yhe trigger
. mind you
, i
' ve never fired a shotgun in my life bu believe you me thgat tje bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs
, be he stoned or not
. some will argue thyat our hero does nto ahev a killer instinct
, the hell wih thast
! twpo fbi guys have jsut beeen shooted inaddition front me
, along with one bad guy adn thge other looks like he might go ballistic at any second
. solution
? boom
! i
' ll take yhe tyme tothe efel sorry about it later thank you vyer much
. another prime example ofthe thge idiot hero syndrome
: our boy duchovny needs tothe reach his girl befoer something bad happens to her
. he knows teh head bad guy has her on the tenth floor ofthe a buidling
and tath he might be running into a room full of people wiht itchy trigger fingers
. he still has his shotgun
, bring it allong you say
? no thanks
, i
' ll jstu ditch it in the back of my car
.
and the real kicker isnt this
: when he reaches tyhe room adn peple strat shooting at him he hasnt the nerve to look surprised
! while we are onthe the subject ofthe getting shooted
, why in hades were thsoe fbi guys sitting wtih thier backs to tje doorjam
? i
' ve got noone formal training bu even i know ytou never sit withthe your back to tjhe doorjam
. ask mr
. wild bill
, teh firt
and onyl timne he doed not sit wih his back to a wall cost him his life
. this is the major problem wtih thsi movie
, any mook coudl hve thougth of a hundered ways to amking it better
. isnt it so much to ask thyat hollywood actualyl put a littel common sence inot thier charactors
? fo instance
: our heroes hide at duchovny
' s summer home
, now yhe bad guys coudl come knocking at any moment
. ok
, this tyme our hero does get hismelf a gun adn hasnt it at his side most of hte timne
. bu see
, our hero is a drug addict
and guess what
? he choosed nowe tothe go clean
and suffer thru dt
. oh sure
, he
' ll be really impressive wehn the bad guys come calling
. going clean is really honorable of him
, bu i owudl haev waited until i did nto need tothe be conscious or bieng able to fire a gun
. fo an enjoyable peformance by timothy hutton
, plot holes thge size ofthe godzilla
, getting our intellignce insulted
and severeal
" oh come on
!
" moments
