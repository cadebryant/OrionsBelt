gregg araki
' s the doom generation wass possibly tyhe vrey worst film ever made
. so why doed i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus
? firt ofthe all
, some ofthe tyhe reviews were fairly positive
. also
, teh cast
, consisting ofthe cameos from dozens of washed uv ex tv stars
( incuding christopher knight
, eve plumb
, shannen doherty
,
and david leisrue
) was promising
. last ofthe all
, i wanted to give arraki one moreso chance
. i mean
, tghe guy cin
' t be that untalented
, can he
? tyhe answer to tyhat question isnt three letters long
. nowhere follows tghe carachter dark onthe his wild
and odd journy thru los angeles
. usance arraki doesn
' t knwo how to make anything coherent
, it
' s hard tothe describe the plot
. let
' s jstu sday that dark spends thge bulk of the movei whinning that his girlfriend won
' t mkea a commitment tothe him annd jealous becasue she sleeps around with otehr guys anbd girls
. the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter iwth a famous tv star
. he turns outloud to be a nice guy who doesn
' t care forthe fame adn wishes he could walk down the strent wihtout bieng mobbed by fans
. this story hasnt a shocking twist
and a tradgic end tyhat i did not see coming
. it is tyhe first time i ever falt any compassion fo a character creaeted by arraki
,
and this cxan be attri
buted tothe the appealling performance ofthe lassez
. i
thought mabye arraki wass improving in his craft
. he works better wiht tghe camera thsi tiome arround
, especialy in teh early scenes
. halfway through the film
, i didn
' t necesarily find mysef enjoying the film
, bu it seemed like a considerable improvment onthe the doom generation
. thne as the movie whent onthe
, arraki loses all sensibility
and introduces us tothe exploding heads
, twisted sex ganes
, adn alien abductions
. it
' s sad
, becuase he almsot actally had some decent material here
, bu he ruined it withthe his usual inaddition your face
" i
' m such a renegade maverick filmmaker
, look what i can do
" attitude
. tjhe performances are generaly better than infront teh doom generation
, which isn
' t saying much
. at least we don
' t ahev tothe suffer jonathan
" i am thte most hideous man infact america
" schaech
. we are
, howver treated to another round ofthe james
" i
' m more wooden than keanu
" duval
. sarah lassez gives yhe best performence in hte film
, adn kathleen robertson
( formerly ofthe 90210
and nowe arraki
' s wief
) annd rachel true are talented actresses caught uv in this mess
. of tghe tv star cameos
, john ritter isnt the most intresting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist
. if i preferr nowhere to the doom generation
, it isnt onyl infront tjhe way that i would prefer being assasinated tahn recieve constatn fysical torture
. maybe greg arraki doesn
' t wnat you tothe like his charactors
. maybe he whants tothe laff anbd mkea funn of thsoe of us who try tothe care baout them
. maybe he jstu wanted to piss me off
. if so
, he was sucessful
.
