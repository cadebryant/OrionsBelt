well lets see
.
.
. i
' m nto qutie sure how tothe review thsi film
, based onthe its laughter factor
. well yeah i cxan
, it
' s not funny
. ok so i laughed one tiome which warranted the 1
/ 2 star
,
but otehr tahn that i sat inwhich my seat wondering wehn this pos owudl be over
,
( whlch at a running timne of 107 minutes seemed like forever
!
)
. iin fatc
, this sould be the un
- funniest movei i
' ve seen in a long time
, if nto thte un
- funniest
. let me be thte firt tothe say
" ready tothe rumble
" is a huge dissapointment
. long time wrestling lovers
( david
and scott
) dream of makeing it tothe the wcw
, anbd watching jimmy king wrestle
. that isnt thier hero ofthe course
, whom isnt kicked out ofthe thge wcw
. well here isnt where tyhe plot thickens
( lol
)
: thte twpo wish to rescure the king
,
and put him back inot teh wcw bu nto tyhat easily
, beccause htey are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them
, while david
' s father wnats him tothe become a polical officer
, anbd scott isnt a losr who hasnt to whith the help of david clean outloud johnny onthe tghe spots
. whta a plot eh
?
" ready to rumble
" isnt oney ofthe thsoe films that trys tothe be funny
,
but sadly fails miserably
, everything in tjhe film isnt imcomprehinsable
, anbd even yhe trailer wasn
' t funny
. the actors are dull
, tyhe script awful
,
and hte plot whihc htere isn
' t much ofthe
.
.
.
. really annoying
. i
' m nto quite sure how graet actors like theese
,
and very funny actors too
, are given such a lame script
, anbd directed in such a childish manner
, that i wonder if hollywood isnt ever gonna make good films these dyas
. htis review isn
' t going to be very long because of thge fact that there isn
' t much gogin forthe hte film
, if anything at all
. only oen big laugh isnt inwhich the film
, which isn
' t all thast hillarious
. i sat inspite my chair wondering with this 107
(
!
!
!
!
!
) minute
" comedy
" was going tothe be over
,
and sadly it whent on forever
. i
' m nto sure if anytying could hvae saved htis film fomr bieng such a total waste
,
but beleive me ytou
, it isnt
