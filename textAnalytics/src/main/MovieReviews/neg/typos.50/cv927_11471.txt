the lives ofthe older peopel in tghe twilight of their eyars attempting to come tothe grips with their shared histories
and possible futures is a fascinating topic
. finding an all
- star cast for such a film isnt a stroke ofthe genius
. combining all thgat withthe a threee
- time oscar
- winning directer
( robert benton of
" kramer vs
. kramer
"
)
and creating a decidedly medicore movei is the stuff ofthe disappointment
. in
yet another noir mystery setted in hollywood
-
- how many of these ahve we seen during tje past few years
?
-
- the atmosphere is moody
, tyhe actors enjoyable tothe watch
and the tsory goes nowhere
. over
- 70 harry ross
( paul newman
) is a washed uv cop
- turned
- private eye
- turned man friday trying to figure out how tothe live what rimaniss ofthe his life
. he
' s screwed uv thigns pretty well
(
" i hadnt a wife
and daugter
. now
, i
' m a drunk
)
and isnt at a crossroads
. a couple of eyasr ago
, he traveled tothe mexico tothe bring bakc mel
( reese witherspoon
)
, the under
- age daughter ofthe jack
( gene hackman
)
and catherine
( susan sar
andon
) ames adn now lives with them
. yhe ames are fromer movei stars
, past their prime
and tghe threee haev become fast firends
. one gets the impression thta ross isnt just hanging outloud waiting fo something to wake him up
. to fill his time
, he does odd jobs for jack adn falls inspite love with catherine
. jack isnt in even worse shape tahn harry
. he
' s dying ofthe cancer with only a year to live
. thnigs dont turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him
. instade of tghe routine err
and thta ross expects
, he walks inot a barrage of bullets from the gun of anohter ex
- cop who is
, himself
, full of bloody holes
. htis unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself inot adn launchs an investigation that revolves around thge mysterious dissapearance ofthe catherine
' s firt husban 20 yersa before
. thru a series of very complex adn convoluted plot devices that involve muder
; blackmail
; guns
; mel
' s mexico traveling partner
and his parole officer
; ross
' s fromer cop buddies
, ex
- lover
and owudl
- be sidekick
, teh tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it tothe
. it
' s a film noir tradition that tghe story twists
and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale
, bu here thte jouney me
anders towards an ending taht noone one cares baout
. teh onyl surprises are exactly whose face fits whlch role inspite hte scenario
. by hte tiome htey show you
, it doesn
' t marter
. tjhe storyline gets goofier
and goofier exemplified in ross
' s relationship with rubin
( giancarlo esposito
)
, a partner wannabe
. theese scenes are obviously designed to be comic releaf
, howver tehy are neither
. rubin
and ross haev soem past relatiopnship
but either it
' s nto explained or i didn
' t care enought at that point tothe remember
. a runing joke about where harry was suposedly shot hwile in mexico isnt probablly meant tothe mirror his questions about whther he isnt still able to perfurd
. it
' s alsot nto funny
, doesn
' t connect adn keeps onthe showing up long aftter it hasnt run its course
. onthe the positive side
, it
' s oftenly enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors onthe tyhe screen
. tje threee leads all have well
- deserved academy awards
and turn in acomplished
, if not extraordinary jobs
. newman isnt a gr
and actro
, bu doesn
' t seem qutie suited to the dark film style
. he is a bited too clean
and understated tothe come accross as desperate annd down annd out
. hackman
, also low
- key
, isnt believable bu lacks sparkle
. sar
andon comes acros well as an sultry older babe
al
though she isnt noe
- dimesnional
. the actors dont waht they can with lame dialouge
,
but they can
' t pull tje film outloud ofthe teh hole it
' s dug for itself
. james garner who plays ross
' s old buddy ex
- cop raymond hope is always a treat
, bu even he half
- heartedly struggles thru lines liuke
" i
' m glad htey didn
' t shoot your pecker off
.
" the best part ofthe the film isnt teh look at ood friends
, how thier relationships chanage over the years
and the difficult choices tehy must make
. the genuinely easy adn casual interactions amonst the actors hint that bieng onthe teh setted ws much mroe intresting thna waht ended uv on the screen the film doesn
' t run very long before the audeince realizes tht it
' s hopeless
. the onyl reason fo watching isnt tghe actors
. it reminds me ofthe diaster movies such as
" towering inferno
" where the star power is supposed tothe make everyone ignore tyhe film
' s problems
. infront a better world
, ther woudl have beeen second
- rate actors in htis second
- rate movei annd the ones here owudl have beeen saved for something better
. of course
, we don
' t live in that better world
, bu you coudl amke yours a littel nicer by chosing a different movie
