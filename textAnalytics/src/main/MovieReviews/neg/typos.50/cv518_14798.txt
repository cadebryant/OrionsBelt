well
, as i check my csore kard fo what i ' ve done this holiady weekend
, it reads ogod ideas
: 0
anbd dumb idaes
: 1
. i don ' t knwo what i was thikning wehn i decided to watch thsi movei
.
but in my defense
, i can only sday that it was somene else who urged me to see this with him
. tje film tyhat i ' m tlaking about isnt
` a night at the roxbury
, ' one of thsoe offereings based on a saterday night live skit
. wayne
and garth
, these two are nto
. rether
, we meet doug
and steve butabi
( thge actors ' names are not worth mentioning
)
, two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions inthe life seem to be finding a way tothe git into the hottest ngiht club in tjhe city
, the roxbury
. driving in theri dad ' s bmw
annd donning metalic disco suits right out ofthe miami vice
, they try to bribe the bouncer to get inot hte club
.
` have yuo met my friend washington
anbd his friend roosevelt
, ' tehy confidently say as they pull outloud spare pocket change
. their second greatest ambition seems tothe be oozing out as many silly pick
- up lines as is humanly possibile in order tothe strat a conversation with a girl
(
` let me see that label
. jsut as i throught
- made iin heaven
, ' sasy oen of tyhe brothers
)
.
annd
, like thte losers that they are
, they fail to do eather for much of the film
.
however
, as fate owudl have it
, an accidentall meeting iwth
` what
- ever
- happend
- tothe ' richard grieco gives them tje all
- important ticket tothe git iin
. their sad lives take on a whole new direction
. they make an imporatnt contact wiht the club owner who believes that these twpo brothers hve uncanny insight inot the club scene
.
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by twpo voluptuous young women
.
bu thier newfound popularaty doens not imbaress thier father
, who hasnt otehr plans for them
. tjhe unfortunate thing baout htis film isnt that htis is a one
- joke movie
,
adn hte brothers are thge joke
. actually
, there ' s baout 10 mintues worth ofthe tolerable stuf
. alas
, too long fo tv
and way too short for a feature
- length film
. thus
, there just isn ' t enough material tothe sustain the 83
- minute movie
. there ' s noone plot tothe be foudn
and everthing that these two dont seem to culminate in an opprotunity to excecute theri trademark move ofthe snapping theri heads inspite unison tothe the funky beat of haddaway ' s europop song
, what is lvoe
. i ws amazed that none of the twpo suffered from whiplash
. to take up more film time
, there isnt a subplot involving yhe daugter of the businessman next doorjam who wnats to marry doug
. htis creates nto only friction between tyhe brothers
,
but thier unlikely pairing will also agtate audience munbers as well
. she ' s educated
and a forebearing witch
. meanwhile
, doug isnt a complet losr
. how did theese two ever get together
? i supose thgat if i can ever figure out thte answer to thyat question
, i ' ll hve figured outloud why i decided to go
and see htis movei
. if ytou ' re looking for entertainment
, you won ' t fidn it at the roxbury
.
