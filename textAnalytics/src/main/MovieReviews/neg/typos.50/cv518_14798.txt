well
, as i check my scroe card for wqat i
' ve done this holiday weekend
, it reads good ideas
: 0 anbd dumb ideas
: 1
. i don
' t know what i was thikning wehn i decided tothe watch thsi movie
. bu in my defense
, i can only sday that it wass somone else who urged me to see this with him
. the film that i
' m tlaking baout is
` a niht at teh roxbury
,
' noe ofthe thsoe offerings based on a saturday night live skit
. wayne adn garth
, theese two are nto
. rather
, we meet doug
and steve
butabi
( the actors
' names are nto worth mentioning
)
, twpo eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions iin life seem tothe be finding a way to git inot tjhe hottest night club infront teh city
, the roxbury
. driving inaddition thier dad
' s bmw annd donning metalic disco suits right out of miami vice
, htey try tothe bribe the bouncer to get into the club
.
` hvea you met my friend washington annd his firend roosevelt
,
' htey confidently sday as htey pul out sparce pocket chanage
. their second greatest ambition seems tothe be oozing out as many silly pik
- uv lines as isnt humanly possable inwhich order to strat a conversation wtih a girl
(
` let me see that lable
. jstu as i
thought
- made inaddition heaven
,
' sasy one ofthe tjhe brothers
)
.
and
, liuke the losers thgat htey are
, htey fail to do eather for much of thge film
. howver
, as fate woudl have it
, an accidental meeting with
` waht
- ever
- happened
- to
' richard grieco gives them yhe all
- important ticket tothe get inwhich
. theri sad lives take on a hwole new direction
. they mkea an importan contact witht the club owner who believes taht theese twpo brothers haev uncanny insight inot tghe club scene
.
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by twpo voluptuous young women
.
but their newfound popularaty does nto imbaress their father
, who hasnt other plans fo them
. teh unfortunate thing baout tihs film isnt taht this isnt a one
- joke movie
,
and the brothers are the joke
. actualy
, htere
' s baout 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuf
. alas
, too long for tv annd way too short for a feature
- lenght film
. thus
, there just isn
' t enough material to sustain yhe 83
- minute movei
. there
' s noone plot to be foudn
and everything that these twpo do seem tothe culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move ofthe snapping their heads infact unison to tyhe funky beated of haddaway
' s europop song
, what is loev
. i was amazed that none of tje two suffered fomr whiplash
. to tkae up moreso film time
, there isnt a subplot involving the daugter of tyhe buisnessman next doorjam who wnats to marry doug
. this creates nto only friction bewteen the brothers
, bu their unlikely pairing iwll also agitate audience munbers as well
. she
' s educated annd a forebearing witch
. meanwhile
, doug isnt a complete loser
. how did these twpo ever git together
? i suppose that if i cant ever figure outloud the answer to taht question
, i
' ll have figured outloud why i decided to go
and see this movie
. if you
' re looking forthe enteratinment
, ytou won
' t fidn it at the roxbury
.
