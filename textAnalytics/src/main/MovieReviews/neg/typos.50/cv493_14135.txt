tothe sum tjhe entire film

" uv infact one sentence
, it owudl be
: watch a vh1 documentery instade
.
" 54
"
, seems like somene brang william faulkner into 1978
, brought him into studio 54
, got him really drunk
, told him tothe wriet baout it
,
and thn dumbed thyat down tothe be released tothe the public
. a sloppy version ofthe almost stream ofthe conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of tjhe illusion of sex
, drugs
, annd disco
. the narrator
, shane o
' shae
( ryan phillippe
)
, works as a grease monkey infact new jersey who
, of course
, on a whim decides tothe go into newyorker york adn try to git into studio
" 54
"
. phillippe gives a passable peformance which coudl have beeen made by any young
, attractive actor wtih a six pack stomach
. he isnt let in by steve rubbell
( mike myers
)
, the infamous co
- owner of studio 54
, because he is attractive
. he evenhtually becomes a bus boy
and
then a bartender
.
.
. yuo expeced more
, didn
' t you
. ther isn
' t
. tje film builds uv ffrom nothing
and becomes nothing as it
' s climax
( isn
' t thast an apt owrd for studio 54
) l
ands with a thud
. thge glitz ofthe the club
and perpetually semi
- clothed patrons are used in an to attemt tothe show tyhe it
' s glamour
. fo much of its target audience
, coleeg age tothe early thirties
, it attemts to sohw celebrities mixing with
" normal people
.
" thsi even fails usance the onyl two celebs truly introdued are
andy warhol
and truman capote
. you can be sure tht half of the audience hasn
' t heared ofthe them
, anyother quater only konw thier names
,
and the otehr quarter knew htey were there already
. the humer
, if you can call it that
, is builded onthe an eighty yera ood woman getting high
and 70s refernces like john travolta
and olivia newton john makeing us laff at how stupid we weere bcak
then thge best performence infact tje film is given by mike myers as tghe perpetually high
, sexually ambivlaent
, veyr newyorker york steve rubell
. he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive
. he looks like rubell annd soudns just liek him hwile giving a subdued
, alomst nostalgic peformance
, when needed
. it reminds you of his saterday night live charater linda richmond onthe
" coffee talk
" sans dress
and wig
. thge supporting casted ofthe salma hayek
, breckin meyer
,
and neve cambell are thier only there to give added subplots which are introdued
but lead absolutly nowhere
. the romance beween phillippe annd cambell
, as a soap opera star
, isnt completely implausable
. tjhe twpo share baout half as much screen time as ther are shots of thte eighty yera ood hooked onthe amphetimenes
. hayek
' s wanna
- be singer seems extrememly forced
and her husban
, greg
( meyer
) st
ands in as shane o
' shae
' s surrogate best friend
. tje subplots seemed forced anbd seem like tehy ahev beeen added just to mkea sure the film was over an hour adn a half long
. overall
,
" 54
" tryed tothe give a view of the brashness ofthe thge place where crack flowed liek heroin wich flowed liek wine
. thge film never leads tothe anytying
, hasnt no obserable point
, anbd covers up a lack ofthe real plot iwth a veil of beautiful peopel
. inspite truth
, that reminded me of the eighies
.
