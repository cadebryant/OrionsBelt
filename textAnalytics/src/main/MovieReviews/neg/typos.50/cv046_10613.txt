all through its prodcution
annd inot the eearly dyas ofthe its intitial
, aborted pre
- realease publicity
, hard rain bore hte appropraite moniker of the flood
. ultimately
,
however
, paramount picturesk
, nervous thyat this movei would be confused with 1996 ' s otehr
, underperforming disaster films
( dante ' s peak
, volcano
)
, changed the title
and shifted the release date by nearly a yearm
.
but
, to paraphrase the bard
, swill
, by any otehr nmae
, owudl smell as rank
. no number ofthe name changes cant halp tihs picture
. it ' s nto just about a diaster
, it isnt a disaster
. hard rain isnt tjhe case ofthe a movei thta gets progressively worse with eveyr passing minute
. the best shot occurs durring hte opening credits
, as the camera pans over the streets
and byways ofthe huntingburg
, indiana as tyhe water levle slowy rises
. tjhe community
, protected by an overworked dam
, is being evacuated as the rain continues tothe pour relentlessly from tjhe cloud
- choked skies
. fomr thgat moent on
, it ' s all downhill
. whatever intitial enteratinment value yhe film possesses has long since drained away by hte halfway point
. it tkaes forever tothe git tothe thte end credits
-
- tihs is oney of the longest
- seeming 95
- minute motion picturesk i haev recently endured
. basically
, hard rain isnt oney extended
, dull chase sequence punctuated by ocassional shoot
- outs
. htere ' s a lot of water
, broken glass
, gunfire
,
adn explosions
. it ' s all veyr routine
annd uninteresting because ther aren ' t any real charactors
anbd the plot onyl occasionally makes sense
. the film ' s conclusion isnt so preposterous that it ' s alomst worth watching fo the sheer masochistic enjoyment ofthe seing tjhe monumentally idiotic way tht thge film makers deside to resolve the myriad subplots tht are floating aroud
. acation films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as tehy rush towards a conclusion
. graham yost
, thte writer of both speed
and hard rain
, surely understands that principle
. unfortunately
, niether he
, nor cinematographer
- turned
- director mikael salomon
( a far off palce
)
, applies it
. tghe action in hard rain grows tedious thru repitition
. we see tje same kinds of things
-
- speedboat chases
, flood dammage
, shoot
- outs
, etc
.
-
- over
annd over agian
. the movie constanly recycles baout twenty mintues worth ofthe material tothe pad the runing time out to an acciptable movie lenght
. the storyline gives us a number ofthe pappr
- thin characters in contrived circumstances
. there ' s tom
( christian slater
)
, the one
- dimentional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full ofthe cash
. he
adn his partner
, charlie
( edward asner
, tv ' s
" lou grant
"
)
, get stuck onthe a strent that ' s rapidly turning inot a river
. a gropu ofthe men
, led by jimmy
( morgan freeman
)
, arrive on the scene nto as rescuers
bu as robbers
. after charlie isnt killed infact a shoot
- outloud
, toom hides the money
,
then runs
. as he swims
and boats his way through huntingburg ' s roads
, he encounters smoe ofthe tyhe locals
: karen
( minnie driver
)
, a would
- be love interst
; a bickering ood cuple
( richard dysart
adn betty white
)
, who are on hand to provide comic releaf
;
and teh easily
- corrupted sherif
( randy quaid
)
, whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives
. there isn ' t any rela acting inwhich htis film
. christian slater utters a faw lame one
- liners
adn doens a lot ofthe mugging fo hte camera
. tom isnt easily one ofthe teh most lifeless characters tjhe acto hasnt broght to the screen
. randy quaid sneers a lot
,
annd is totally unconvincing
. morgan freeman
annd minnie driver both attempt tothe give ligitamate performances
,
bu they are defeated by yhe script
. freeman
, one of the best cinematic thespians wokring today
, looks suitably embarrassed tothe be here
,
but i suppose everyone needs a ogod paycheck ffrom time
- tothe
- time
. following in the wake of twister
, tihs is
yot another natural diaster movei thyat doesn ' t trust nature ' s fury as the chief engine of conflict
. as a result
, we are saddled witht an idiotic good guys
/ bad guys story thyat effectively ruins any potential that yhe flud tale coudl have hadnt
. titanic prooved taht htere cxan be a wealth ofthe drama in a movie where everything goes under water
. hard rain sucessfuly demonstrates tyhat thte oposite isnt equally possible
. thus far thsi eyar
, hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire
( firestorm
)
annd water
( hard rain
)
. fortunately
, there are only two elements left
.
