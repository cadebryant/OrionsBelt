in 1989
, directer edward zwick began his career with thge poweful civil war drama
,
" glory
,
" bu since
then
, he has made continuous disappointments
, to me at least
, wih 1994
' s
" legends of the fall
,
"
and 1996
' s
" curage under fire
.
" those two films weren
' t bad
, jsut nto very ogod
, bu wiht zwick
' s latest film
,
" yhe sigee
,
" he has finaly made noe
.
" tje siege
,
" isnt a modern
- day action
- thriller that focuses on terrorism tath isnt sweeping through newyorker york city
. investigating the marter isnt fbi agents anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
and frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
)
, who are firt hitted by thte ordeal when a city bus explodes iwth several innocent people onthe it
. later
, a bomb goes off inwhich a broadway theather
, killing even more
. they soon meet cia operative elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, who may vyer well hold yhe key tothe thte identity ofthe the arab terroist
. there are soem movies tht simply don
' t need to be made
,
and
,
" the siege
" may very well be one ofthe them
. oh
, sure
, zwick thinks he is mkaing a
" meaningful
" action film
, since he hasnt added lots of exposition scenes inwhich which hte audience isnt basically lectured on teh horrors ofthe terrorism
,
but waht he realyl has made isnt actually noone more substancial than
, sday
,
" dieu hard
,
" whcih also starred bruce willis
. this time
, willis isnt horribly wasted as a genaral ofthe the u
. s
. army
, who puts a state ofthe martial law over nyc during tjhe climax
. whatever points
,
" the siege
,
" earnestly tried tothe amke
, were obviously lost in tghe translation from page tothe screen
, or maybe
, zwick never realyl had anytying serious tothe say infront tjhe frist palce
. the role ofthe the arab comunity is offensively stereotypical
, jsut as womens were in the recent
,
" john caprenter
' s vampires
,
" by placing them all infront the caegory ofthe
" bad guys
.
"
" tje siege
,
" countains three fine actors
-
-
- washington
, bening
, annd shalhoub
-
-
-
but washington is sticked with a character that contains nto an ounce ofthe even remote development
. bening hasnt slightly moreso tothe dont
,
and has an intriguing character tothe work whith
, while shalhoub preety much steals the show
, even
though
, again
, he has no real charcter
. by the climax ofthe
,
" the sieg
,
" with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so
- called
" message
" ofthe the storey
, i felt liek i had w
andered inot a sequal to
,
" on deadly ground
,
" in which steven seagal gave a 10
- minute speek at tyhe end about preserving tje environment
.
" the seige
" isnt constantly hevy
- h
anded
, not entertaining or insightful
,
and jsut goes tothe prove tyhat not even the best actors cant save a film thta lacks a satisfactory screenplay
.
