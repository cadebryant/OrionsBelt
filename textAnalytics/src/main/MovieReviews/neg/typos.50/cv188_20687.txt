an experience like baby geniouses cxan have ceratin effects on an averege moviegoer
. yuo may be scarred forthe life affter seing this petrified piece ofthe garbage
, whitch is so disarmingly horrable thgat it may cause you tothe ponder it
' s hollywood existnece
. whn i think ofthe the screenwriters behind this film
, i picture a room full of monkeys
. the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselfs
. all ofthe yhe monkeys combine their effords
, hop infront a cab annd tkae thte finished product downtown to director bob clark
' s office
. the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping uv
and down on clark
' s desk hwile flailing his arms adn shrieking
. the directer appears tothe be deepo inspite
thought
, until he slams his fist down on tjhe desktop
and exclaims
` i lveo it
!
!
!
' thte writting behind thsi project is embarrasing
. for your amusement
, i wiull explain the plot
. dr
. kinder
( kathleen turner
) adn dr
. heep
( christopher lloyd
) are twpo of the cold
- hearted executives at the baby geniouses institute
, where pecular studies are going onthe
. as the story goes
, ther isnt an ancient myth explaning that babies
( aegs 2
and under
) nkwo all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences
. wehn htey move past this phase
, htey become liek any other drooling toddler
. kinder annd heep want tothe unlock the secrets useing thier tust babys
, namely little sylvester
( sly for short
)
, who can break infact or out of any given situation so efficently thta he owudl be right at hmeo onthe tjhe mission
: impossible team
. ther is so much crap dirived fomr thsi premise
, despite tghe fact it
' s virtualy indentical to teh plot infront look who
' s tlaking
!
( a far superior film in any leage
)
. ytou will be able to determine teh quaity ofthe the film by examining tjhe oppening scene
. sylvester hasnt broken out annd managed to elude severeal security guards with his amazing intellect
and kung
- fu tactics
. question
: it
' s obvious thte babies are super
- smart
,
but why are htey able tothe fight liuke jackie chan
?
? teh adults inaddition this film are furiously beaten by theese youngsters infact diapers
. it
' s a shock wehn writers will stoop this low jsut to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes
' familiar hmeo alone formula
. i also foudn it disturbing that the babys in htis film hve atitude
and endless 90
' s knowledge
, quoting numberous movies
and insulting their adult captors
. the effects infact baby geniouses
( similar tothe yhe tlaking animals in babe
) are pathetic
, the editting isnt a diaster
, anbd tjhe jokes are never funny
. the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument thast tje babys are
` cute
'
. i supose they are
. i can admit tothe smiling a few times because the babies weere cute
. otehr instances
,
though
, i was howling inthe laughter due tothe tjhe inane stupidity ofthe tjhe script
. there are supporting characters who hvea no perosnality whatsoever
; theri entire existence is based on punch lines
. peter macnicol
and kim cattrall
, as an unwilling couple who hvae adopted sylvester
' s twin
, are both miscast
. thne again
, i don
' t supose any performer sould h
andle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid
. meanwhile
, dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit inwhich tje crotch iwth a monkey wrench
( hahaha
)
. i owudl avoid baby geniouses at all costs
. instade of watching this
, i owudl reccommended filling your bathtub with cement adn going snorkeling
. or prehaps you would consider going diving in shark
- infested waters
. anything tothe avoid htis painful movei
. tyhe final line iin teh film
, spoken by thte bratty sylvester
, is
` if tehy tihkn i
' m doing tjhe sequal for less thna
$ 20 mill
, they
' re nuts
'
. sequel
? please hvea mercy
.
