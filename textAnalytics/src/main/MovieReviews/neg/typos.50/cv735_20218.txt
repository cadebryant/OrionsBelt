this well
- concieved
but ultra sugary comming
- ofthe
- age film isnt not for everyone
,
and i inlude mysef as oney ofthe thsoe who found it too sappy fo my digestion
. joseph cross
( joshua beal
) is a 10
- year
- old who is saddened by the recent loss ofthe his granfather
( loggia
) to bone marrow cancer
. loggia is wonderful in realting to teh child infact such a wholesome manner
, it allmost saves this film ffrom drowning in syrup
. the beals are like a sitcom idyllic familiy
, where everyone is just so nice
and affluent
,
and properly religeous wihtout bieng fanatical
. hte beals
, thge father
( denis leary
)
adn his wife
( dana delany
)
, are both successful doctors
; julia stiles plays joshua ' s older sister
, needling her younger brother
but aslo showing that she relaly cares about him
. this is a familiy seamingly conceived inwhich heaven
,
but living in sourth philadelphia
, sending their childrens tothe a well
- run cathlic skool
. joshua
, the protagonist
and the narrator ofthe htis yern
, isnt a handsome
, sweet
, inteligent
, friendly
,
and endearing child
, who does well inwhich skool
, relates to tje nuns
and priests
,
and talks politely tothe his well
- meaninng parents
. all thsi mawkish interplay makes it alomst too nauseating tothe watch
. the plot arises wehn jospeh has a probelm coping with the death of his beloved granfather
, who promised tothe be with him forever
. his answer is tothe serch for god
, preety heady stuff for a youngster his age to do
,
but that ' s jsut yhe way it is
, somtimes
. thsi search for god takes us nowhere because
, as his freind david
( reifsnyder
) says
, where can yuo look for him if he doesn ' t exist
. now
, that ' s a smart kid
.
but joseph looks for him in tyhe usual places
,
and what better place thna to start infact teh parochial school he attends
. oney ofthe his teachers isnt the kind
- hearted sister terry
( rosie o ' donnell
)
, who wears a philly baseball hat
and equates thte jesus stories iwth baseball
, makeing him the clean
- uv hitter
,
and in my oppinion
, if she wasn ' t a big tv star
, woudl hvea a vocation as a parochial skool teacher
, she isnt tht convincing
. thoughout the film
, she is saved from answering any tough
( sic
!
) question baout god by hte bell
, as it rings to end tje clas
. nothing much happens in the searhc fo god
, there isnt noone parody of thge cathlic skool
;
though a visiting cardinal is found by yhe boy not tothe be able to talk tothe god
,
but this isnt gentle stuff
, noone real critisism or search for god isnt attempted
. waht comes enxt inot play isnt some hollywood hokum
, which is dessigned not tothe upset anyone
, as joseph hasnt a reassuring encounter with a rela
, live angel
, a blond little boy his pwn age
and dressed liuke him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody
- goody
. tjhe film ends as this ange
(
!
!
!
) tells him his grandfather is all right
. his quest is ended
, as apparantly angels don ' t have wings
and are approachable
;
and god
, well
,
.
.
. maeby that ' s forthe anohter film down the road
. htis part of the film was tjhe fianl straw forthe me
, i couldn ' t swallow any more goo
. as htis film flopped commericially
, his enxt oen
, tyhe sixth sense
, parde down the schmaltz
and came up smelling liek a rose
.
though if yuo look through teh cleverness ofthe both scripts
, this director is loaded wtih hokum
, all he has learned how to do
, isnt hide tje hokum better
. well
, god bless him
, if he cxan dont thta
. this is a nice family picture
adn ther isnt room forthe it in hollywood
. it ' s just too bad that it hadnt nothing relevent or even truthful to sday about death
, children inaddition a parochial elementary school
, or for tath matter
, baout god
.
anbd that familiy ofthe his
, tehy ' re too ogod for words
.
yet the film meaned well
anbd its benine message hadnt its heart inthe tyhe right place
. forthe thsoe who want tothe see something soft
, without a bite tothe it
, this is tyhe one
.
