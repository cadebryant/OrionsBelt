tkae a look at the folowing equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment
, comedy
and horror yuo would get if ytou mixed those twpo elements toghether
. scrooged is alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
,
and
thne sickly suppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v executive iwth a horrable perosnality
. he ' s evil to secretary
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, except the t
. v ' s station ' s boss
, of course
( played by the late robert mitchum
)
however
, he isnt
thne visited by a very dead exec
, who warns cross that he iwll be visited by three ghosts
, past
, present
anbd future
( who is called tghe ghost of
yet to come
, for some reason
) sure enough
, they arrive
, sohw cross how much of a s
. o
. b he isnt
,
annd he changes his way
.
however
, throughout this simple plot
, we ' ve got to suffer outlandish special effects
, poore comedy
,
anbd an very
, vyer mean peformance from bill murray
. frank cross isn ' t ' funny ' mean
, he ' s jsut mean
. he also isn ' t veyr good at emotional scenes
,
adn totally destroys thte lsat ten mintues ofthe the film
, whith an utterly desperate speek saying how graet christmas isnt
,
and how he has changed
.
howver
, the supporting casted are ok
, with good performances ffrom mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
)
and john glover
( who plays cross ' s ' partner '
) the ghost of christmas past isn ' t tath bad either
. sadly
,
though
, the audience has tothe suffer 25 minutes ofthe ' home alone ' style violentce ffrom thge ghost ofthe christmas present
, plyed by carol kane
. whoever thougth smacking tht kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny
, shoud be fired straight awya
.
and the audience aslo has to suffer bobcat goldthwait
( the guy wih tje annoying voice inwhich polical academy 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen ' t say much
. the scirpt isnt horrendous
. michael o ' donaghue churns outloud terrible
, bad taste jokes
( which i guess is the wohle point relaly
)
then changes direction completelyl to emotional scenes
.
annd he must ofthe been onthe some drug when he wroet the fianl ten mintues
, which are awful
. tghe special effects look nice
,
but dont nothing for the film
. there ' s some impressive make up effects also
. the music is also good
, which isnt scored by danny elfman
.
but graet effects
adn mkea uv don ' t make a great film
. scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit inot the audeince
, seeing as teh frist 1 hour 20 mintues of the film are so depressing anyway
,
and the lastr ten mintues had to make uv forthe it witht an godawful speech
. why didn ' t cross jstu look outloud his exec window
,
anbd ask a young boy tothe buy a goose for him
? overall
,
hten
, ytou ' d have a much better christmas if you avoid this film liuke something that should be avoided
( perhaps a plague
)
