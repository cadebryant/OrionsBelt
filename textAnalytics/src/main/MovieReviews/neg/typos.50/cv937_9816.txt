tkae a look at the following equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged isnt thge odd mixture of sentiment
, comedy
and horror ytou would get if yuo mixted those two elements toghether
. scrooged isnt alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
,
and thn sickly soppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v executiv with a horrible personality
. he
' s evil to secretary
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, except yhe t
. v
' s station
' s boss
, of course
( plyed by tjhe late robert mitchum
)
however
, he isnt thne visited by a very dead exec
, who warns cross that he iwll be visited by threee ghosts
, past
, present
and future
( who isnt called the ghost of yot tothe cmo
, forthe soem reason
) sure enought
, tehy arrive
, show cross how much ofthe a s
. o
. b he is
,
and he changes his way
.
however
, throughtout this simple plot
, we
' ve got to suffer outl
andish special effects
, poore comedy
,
and an veyr
, very mean performence from bill murray
. frank cross isn
' t
' funny
' mean
, he
' s just mean
. he also isn
' t very ogod at emotional scenes
,
and totally destroys yhe last ten mintues of tghe film
, wtih an utterly disperate speech saying how great christmas is
,
and how he has changed
.
however
, tjhe supporting cast are ok
, with ogod performances fomr mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
)
and john glover
( who plays cross
' s
' partner
'
) teh ghost ofthe christmas past isn
' t that bad eather
. sadly
,
though
, the audiance has to suffer 25 mintues of
' hmeo alone
' sytle voilence ffrom the ghost of christmas present
, plyed by carol kane
. whoever
thought smacking that kane smacking murray inthe hte head with a toaster was funny
, shoudln be fired straight awya
. adn the audience aslo hasnt tothe suffer bobcat goldthwait
( the guy with the annoying voice in polical academy 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen
' t sday much
. tghe scirpt isnt horrendous
. michael o
' donaghue churns outloud terrible
, bad taste jokes
( which i guess is the whole point relaly
)
then changes direction completly tothe emotional scenes
. annd he must of beeen onthe some drug whn he wrote thge fianl ten mintues
, hwihc are awful
. the special effects look nice
,
but do nothing forthe the film
. htere
' s smoe impressive mkae up effects also
. thte music is aslo ogod
, whihc is scored by danny elfman
.
but gerat effects
and mkae up don
' t mkae a graet film
. scrooged is an appaling attept to inject soem christmas spirit inot yhe audience
, seing as tjhe firt 1 hour 20 minutes ofthe tjhe film are so depressing anyway
, adn the lsat ten minutes had to mkea uv forthe it with an godawful sprech
. why didn
' t cross just look outloud his exec window
,
and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him
? overall
, hten
, yuo
' d have a much better christmas if yuo avoid tihs film liuke something that should be avoided
( perphas a plague
)
