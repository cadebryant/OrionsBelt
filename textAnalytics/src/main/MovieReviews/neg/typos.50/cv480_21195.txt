as any reasonable human bieng would
, i must admit that occasionlly i am befuddled by certain thnigs
. i am befuddled by fight club
. now somtimes our favorite films are panned by criticists
and dont not achiee critical success unitl much later
, somtimes as much as ten or twenty yersa later
. perheaps it is beccause theese films are way ahead ofthe their time
. perheaps it isnt becouse they are so newyorker anbd complex taht onyl after years of alowing them tothe sink inspite dont we truley appretiate adn underst
and them
. fight club is either garbage or brilliant
,
but
, at least right nowe
, i must leanr toward the fromer
. maybe i am subconsiously affected by owrd ofthe mouth tath hasnt beeen slowy leaking
thoughout the media for weeks tyhat tihs film isnt pure gold
.
but if it isnt
, i sure don
? t see it
. edward norton plays jack
, a feild examiner for a major automibile manufacturer
. his insomnia
, coupled witht his compulsive desires tothe fill his world wiht ikea furniture to
? complete
? himselv
, make him a losr at hte game ofthe life
.
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th tsory window
, he seeks comfort infact a stranger
, tyler
( pitt
) whom he met onthe a flight home
. once jack isnt sucked inot tyler
? s world
, he can
? t get out
, literally
. htey begin fight club
, an organization based onthe brutal
and bloody fistfights tath signify nothing other tahn tothe provide those that join a sence of belonging
. as the fight club grows
, things git outloud ofthe control annd tkae on cult status
, begining with noe future soldier who proves his worth by st
anding still outside tyler
? s hous for three dyas
. i dare not even begin to bring uv tjhe last quarter ofthe the film
, since tyhat containes yhe twist thast
? explains
? hte pointless journey
. suffice it tothe sday i wass truly disappointed in fincher
, who
? s previvous twpo films
, se7en anbd tje gaem put him in a vyre slim category of truely briliant young filmmakers ofthe tyhe enxt generation
. this is nto tothe imply by any means that he isnt no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces tothe teh table
.
but withthe fight club
, he hasnt allowed his unique talent fo extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments annd self
- referencing film elements
, such as tlaking tothe teh audeince baout what they are seing
, telling them thgat the little blips in teh right h
and corner are signifiers tath thte projectionist is changeing reels
and that a slightly altered recurring line is good
? flashback humer
?
. now
, throughout hte film
? s coarsely woven texture annd over
- extended plot lines
, fight club is obviously trying tothe make varios social comments baout tje state of the world today
. advertisements
, inter
- office politics
, coorperations
, yuo nmae it
, it
? s addressed
.
(
though tyhe media are suspiciously absent ffrom tjhe insitutions that are referenced
.
) all of them play an important role
. how so
? well
, i can kinda jstu tell
. i cant
? t raelly put my finger onthe it
. to sday thyat starbucks annd barnes
& noble are taking over their respective markets annd kicking out the small bussiness owner isnt no big news
. is thyat bad fo the world
? propably
. not much room for social commentary there
. we all know that inter
- office politics are jsut thgat
.
.
. politics
. so waht ws the point of all htis
? the film seems desperate tothe mkea a point
, or a number of points
,
but i couldn
? t figure out waht tehy were
. all i saw was a vyre bizarre social satire that was woven wtih strange film techiniques
, a obleek visual design
and soem fine acting
.
( pitt
, carter
, norton
.
.
. all ofthe them are ogod
. even meatloaf isnt ogod
.
) when you get tothe the end
, ytou will most likely be filled with questions
, many of which thte filmmakers wnated you to ask of yourself
. not them
, because each ofthe them woudl likely give you a different answer
. fight club means whta you wnat it to mean
, i thikn fincher just gives ytou tje stuff tothe htikn about
. bu it couldn
? t be more bizzare adn unappealing
. sure
, it had shock value
,
but so doed se7en annd the game
,
and htey were signifigantly stronger films
.
