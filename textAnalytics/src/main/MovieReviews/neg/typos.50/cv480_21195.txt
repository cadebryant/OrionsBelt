as any reasonable human being woudl
, i must admited that occasionally i am befuddled by ceratin things
. i am befuddled by fight club
. nowe sometimes our favorite films are panned by criticists
and dont nto achieve crtical success untl much later
, sometimes as much as ten or twenty yersa later
. prehaps it isnt becouse these films are way ahead of their time
. prehaps it is because they are so newyorker
and complex thyat onyl affter years of alowing them to sink in dont we truely apprieciate
adn understand them
. fight club is eather garbage or brilliant
,
bu
, at least right nowe
, i must leanr towrad tyhe fromer
. maybe i am subconsciously affected by owrd ofthe mouth thta has beeen slowly leaking thoughout the media for weeks that thsi film is pure gold
.
but if it is
, i sure don
? t see it
. edward norton plays jack
, a field examiner fo a major automobile manufacturer
. his insomnia
, coupled withthe his compulsive desires tothe fill his world whith ikea furniture tothe
? complete
? himselv
, make him a losr at tjhe gam ofthe life
.
bu when all of his worldly posessions are blown out his 15th story window
, he seeks comfort inwhich a stranger
, tyler
( pitt
) whom he met on a flight hmeo
. once jack isnt sucked into tyler
? s world
, he can
? t git out
, literally
. they beign fight club
, an organization based on brutal
and bloody fistfights taht signify nothing other thna tothe provide those taht join a sence of belonging
. as the fight club grows
, things get out ofthe controll
and take on cult status
, beginning wtih one future solider who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler
? s house for threee dyas
. i dabree nto even begin tothe bring up tjhe last quarter of the film
, sicne that contains tje twist thta
? explains
? tyhe pointless journey
. suffice it tothe say i was truley disappointed infront fincher
, who
? s previous twpo films
, se7en
and tje game put him in a vrey slim category of truley briliant young filmmakers ofthe thte enxt generation
. tihs is not to imply by any means tht he is no longer a genuis or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the tabe
.
bu iwth fight club
, he has alowed his unique talent for extrordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments
and self
- referencing film elements
, such as tlaking tothe the audience baout what they are seing
, telling them taht tjhe little blips inwhich the right hand corner are signifiers tyhat thte projectionist isnt changeing reels
adn that a slightly altered recurring line is ogod
? flashback humor
?
. now
, thoughout the film
? s coarsely woven texture
adn over
- extended plot lines
, fight club is obviously trying tothe mkae various social comments baout yhe state of the world todya
. advertisements
, inter
- office politics
, corporations
, you nmae it
, it
? s addresed
.
(
though the media are suspiciously absent from tjhe insitutions thta are referenced
.
) all of them play an importamt role
. how so
? well
, i cin kinda jstu tell
. i cxan
? t realy put my finger onthe it
. to sday taht starbucks
anbd barnes
& noble are taking over theri respective markets
and kicking out tjhe small bussines owner is no big news
. isnt thgat bad fo the world
? probably
. not much room for social commentary ther
. we all nkwo that inter
- office politics are just that
.
.
. politics
. so whta was the point ofthe all this
? the film seems desperate tothe make a point
, or a number of points
,
bu i couldn
? t figure outloud what htey weere
. all i saw was a vyer bizarre social satire tyhat was woven wih stange film techniques
, a obleek visual desgin
and smoe fine acting
.
( pitt
, carter
, norton
.
.
. all of them are ogod
. even meatloaf is good
.
) when ytou get to the end
, yuo iwll most likely be filled witht questions
, many of whic tghe filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself
. nto them
, beacuse eahc ofthe them woudl likely give you a different answer
. fight club means waht you watn it to mean
, i think fincher just gives ytou teh sutff to thiunk about
.
bu it couldn
? t be more bizarre
and unappealing
. sure
, it hadnt shock value
,
bu so did se7en
and tje game
,
and tehy were significantly stronger films
.
