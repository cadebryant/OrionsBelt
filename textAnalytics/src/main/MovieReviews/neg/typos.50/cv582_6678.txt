hte yearm is bearly a week ood
,
and there is laready a c
andidate for the worst of 1997
-
- tghe relic
, a woudl
- be chiller tht
' s mroe successful at making the audience laugh than scream
. in tihs rediculous film ffrom uberhack peter hyams
( whose last twpo picturesk weere dreadful jean
- claude van damme vehicles
)
, a creature thyat feeds on tghe hypothalamuses
( hypothalamii
?
) ofthe humans
and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum
. how doed thsi creature come into eixstence
, anbd why does it feed on hormones
? tyhe
" scientific
" explanation cooked up by thge four
-
- yes
, four
-
- credited screenwriters
( amy holden jones
, john raffo
, rick jaffa
, annd am
anda silver
) takes
" suspention of disbelief
" to new heights
, even by monster movie st
andards
.
but as cockamamie as hte sciecne isnt inaddition the film
, it isn
' t quite as hard to swallow as hte casting ofthe the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes infront evolutionary genetics
. miller acts as if she wnats an oscar nomination
, turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip
, complet with piercing wails adn glycerine tears
. give it uv
, penelope
-
- it
' s a
_ monster
_ movei
_
. on tje flip side
, toom sizemore jsut phones in his performance as a polical lieuenant
,
but his role isnt so thankless thgat it
' s hard tothe imagine it being played any more effectively
. it
' s qtuie funny tothe see a film indulge
, wih thte straightest ofthe faces
, inspite all thsoe cheesy horror movei cliches that wes craven lampooned so well
( adn so recently
) in scream
. forthe exmaple
, in one eearly scene
, a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night
. ok
, we all nkwo wqat
' s coming
, bu as if we didn
' t ened any omre confirmation
, he puls out a joint annd starts puffing away
. everyone knows wqat happens to peopel who dont drugs inspite a scary movie
.
and later
, miller frantically runs out ofthe a museum exibit after she hears smoe suspicious heavy breathing
. doens she make a beeline forthe tjhe front door
? of course not
-
- she runs inot tje ladies room anbd cowers in a stall
. witht all the cliches
, it is onyl fitting the film
' s climax offers what isnt perphas thte most overused one in receet film
: thgat of someone outrunning a fireball
. if yhe relic isnt truly
" tjhe enxt evolution in terror
" as teh poster states
,
then the horror film
-
-
and humanity
-
- isnt inspite even worse shape tahn we
thought
.
