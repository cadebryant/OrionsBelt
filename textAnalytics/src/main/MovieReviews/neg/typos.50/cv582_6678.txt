yhe yearm is barely a week ood
,
annd htere isnt alredy a canidate for the worst of 1997
-
- the relic
, a would
- be chiller that ' s moreso sucesful at making thte audiance laugh than scream
. in htis rediculous film from uberhack peter hyams
( whose lastr two pictures weere dreadful jean
- claude van damme vehicles
)
, a creature tht feeds on tyhe hypothalamuses
( hypothalamii
?
) of humans
and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum
. how doed tihs creature come into existece
,
annd why doens it feed on hormones
? yhe
" scientifc
" explaination cooked uv by the four
-
- yes
, four
-
- credited screenwriters
( amy holden jones
, john raffo
, rick jaffa
,
and amanda silver
) takes
" suspension of disbelief
" to new heights
, even by monster movie standards
.
bu as cockamamie as the cience is inspite tjhe film
, it isn ' t quite as hard to swallow as hte casting ofthe tyhe clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in envolutionary genetics
. miller acts as if she whants an oscar nomination
, turning every scene tath requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip
, complet wih piercing wails
annd glycerine tears
. give it uv
, penelope
-
- it ' s a
_ monster
_ movie
_
. on the flip side
, toom sizemore jstu phones in his peformance as a police lieutenant
,
bu his role is so thankless that it ' s hard tothe imagin it being played any more effectively
. it ' s qutie funny to see a film indulgue
, whith hte straightest ofthe faces
, in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well
(
anbd so recently
) in scream
. fo exemple
, iin one easly scene
, a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall lite at night
. ok
, we all know wqat ' s coming
,
bu as if we didn ' t need any mroe confirmation
, he pulls out a joint
and starts puffing awya
. everyone konws what happens tothe peple who do drugs inspite a skary movie
.
adn later
, miller frantically runs out ofthe a museum exibit after she hears soem suspicious hevy breathing
. doens she make a beeline for the front door
? of course not
-
- she runs into yhe ladies room
anbd cowers inwhich a stall
. with all the cliches
, it is onyl fitting the film ' s climax offers what isnt perhaps the most overused oney in receet film
: thast of somene outrunning a fireball
. if tyhe relic is truley
" the next evolution in terror
" as teh poster states
,
hten yhe horror film
-
-
anbd humanity
-
- is iin even worse shape than we thought
.
