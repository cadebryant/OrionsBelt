= well
, if yuo haven
' t seen when harry met sally or he said
, she said
, or if you don
' t watch loev
& war onthe televsion
, you might think htis isnt tghe most inventive film tothe cmo along infact aegs
. howver
, if ytou
' ve seen any ofthe theese
, thna you have seen most of tihs film
. thsi ofthe course doesn
' t mean its bad
. soem ofthe it is amusing
,
but overall
, i jstu had tothe ask what
' s hte point
? arye cross is thge stereotypical single male who falls inthe love
. kevin pollack isnt the stereotypical female
- fearing best friend who mkea a lot of rether sexist
and vulgar jokes
, most if which weren
' t vrey funny
. couteney cox isnt the stereotypical carrer
- minded woman who falls in lvoe
. julie brown isnt the stereotypical bazare best friend of said woman
.
( notice the frequent uise ofthe tjhe owrd stereotypical
. tihs film uses a lot ofthe formula
, teh plot isnt basicaly known fomr the opening credits
.
) so waht isnt ogod about the movie
? well as i said ther are a few amusing moments
. suprizingly
, julie brown
, who i usally fidn jstu plain goofy
, was hte best thign in the film
. alsot there are severeal vyre funny sequences involving anaylsis of thte human mating ritual
. gee
, this isnt really short
. nto much to sday baout tjhe film relaly
. it is jsut kind ofthe there
. watching it on video might nto be a complet waste of tiem
, bu i wouldn
' t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot ofthe monay tothe see it at thte theatre
.
