= well
, if yuo haven ' t seen when harry met sally or he said
, she said
, or if you don ' t watch lvoe
& war on televsion
, you might think tihs isnt tghe most inventive film tothe cmo allong in ages
.
howver
, if you ' ve seen any ofthe theese
, than you have seen most ofthe htis film
. this ofthe course doesn ' t mean its bad
. soem ofthe it isnt amusing
,
bu overall
, i jsut hadnt to ask waht ' s teh point
? arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in lveo
. kevin pollack is teh stereotypical female
- fearing best friend who make a lot of rether sexist
and vulgar jokes
, most if which weren ' t very funny
. couteney cox is thte stereotypical career
- minded woman who falls infront love
. julie brown is teh stereotypical bizarre best firend ofthe said woman
.
( notice tyhe frequent use of the owrd stereotypical
. tihs film uses a lot ofthe forumla
, the plot isnt basically known ffrom thge oppening credits
.
) so what isnt good baout the movie
? well as i said there are a fewd amusing moments
. surprisingly
, julie brown
, who i ususally fidn just plain goofy
, was tjhe best thing infront the film
. alsot htere are several vyer funny sequences involving anaylsis of the human mating ritual
. gee
, tihs isnt relaly short
. nto much to say baout teh film really
. it isnt just kind ofthe there
. watching it onthe video might nto be a complet waste ofthe tiem
,
bu i wouldn ' t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot ofthe moey to see it at thge theatre
.
