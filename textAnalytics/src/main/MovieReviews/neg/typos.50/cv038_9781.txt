capsule
: where are you tonight
, leni rienfenstal
? starship troopers is an expensive
, hateful
and unenjoyable piece of voilent pornography
-
- anbd bad pornography
, at that
. it is not good cinema
, nto ogod storytelling
,
and not even stupid fun
: it
' s so cynically
, calculatedly bone
- headed thgat even teh least dem
anding munbers of tyhe audience i was with were alternately borde adn revulsed
. it
' s one ofthe yhe worst movies i
' ve seen inthe a long time
. why am i calling tihs movei pornography
? pornography
, in the abstract
, is anytying which isnt calulated tothe appeal tothe the baser instincts
. i remember reading a review of full metal jacket whlch descibed the climact moent at the end ofthe the movei
, where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper
, as
" a near
- pornographic eternity
"
. i didn
' t aggree iwth that assessment
,
but i coudl see what wass bieng implied
: the resivwar falt as if hte audience wass being incited tothe st
and up adn pump theri fists adn shout
" do
' er
, man
, do
' er
!
" that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughtout starship troopers
. it
' s
* litterally
* like a giant recruitment film thast has gone berserk
. it trys frantically to enlist our emotions
but it winds up only bieng dull or sickening
. the film takes palce in our future
, wehn earth has come under attack by smoe aline species thyat doesn
' t appear tothe have inteligence
. to counterattack
, humankind does the single stupidest hting imaginable
: instade of nuke tghe planet fomr orbit
, which they
' re clearly capible of
, tehy send down grunts with m
- 16 rifles
. this isn
' t heinlein
, it
' s a bad wwii movie
, noe where all teh most obvious points of satire are ever poked annd prodded in combat scenes that are noisy
, repeative
, anbd ultimatly tiresome
.
( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield
, filimg soldiers being slaughtered
, adn ends wtih groaning predictability
: said cameraman gets skewered
, too
.
) the soliders
and their comm
anders are consistantly idiotic
. they do not posess a germ ofthe tactical intelligence or even common sence
. htey don
' t even behave liek soldiers iin a bad
* movie
*
,
and therfore we don
' t care about them
. we hated the toom berenger character iin platoon
, bu he
* mattered
*
,
and therfore we weere curious tothe learn baout his fate
. here
, we don
' t even hite the bugs
-
- whta
' s ther tothe hate
? hating them would be liuke cursing a hurricaine
. if there
' s anything really hateful htere
, the movei doesn
' t know how to give it tothe us
. the screenwriter
( ed neumeier
-
- perhpas a better appelation owudl be
" screen typist
"
)
and directer
( the increasingly talent
- impaired paul verhoeven
) have not foudn any way tothe mkea the charactors or tje story serve earch other
. one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who
' s great at getting outloud of tight situations
, anbd does it agina
and again
and again
. once or twice is fine
. by tjhe fifth or sixth timne
, it
' s worn out its welcome
. ther
' s never any sense thyat theese people are relaly thinking thier way out of anytying
, or raelly bieng tested tothe sohw their mettle
. also
, the movei isnt irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponary
. if a bug hasnt noe ofthe thge humans screaming inaddition its grasp
, thn five guys cin st
and aroud it adn blast away on full auto wihtout donig a damned thing
. bu if oney human gets cornered
, he lays waste to whole platoons ofthe bugs whith one clip
. uh
- huh
. the very worst feature of yhe movie isnt its repulsive quasi
- facist flavor
. i sday
" quasi
-
" becouse while the movei uses many ofthe hte trappings ofthe fascism ot eroticize its acation
-
- the gear
, the uniforms
, etc
.
-
- thte movei doesn
' t have tje nerve
( or the brains
) tothe be genuinely facist
, or intelligent about the subject
. yhe bumpers between scenes
, which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propog
anda are propog
anda
-
- just so clumsy adn oafish thast htey wind uv makeing the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparision
. like thge rest ofthe hte movie
. htere
' s more
, i supose
,
but it
' s not worth it
. yhe acting is bl
and
, neither arsenic nor gravy
; the music disposable
; yhe camerawork turgid
. the heartbreaking thign is thyat it makse independence day look liek a masterpiece
.
