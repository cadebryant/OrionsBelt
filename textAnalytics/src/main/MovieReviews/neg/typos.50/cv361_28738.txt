) roger ebert asks in his review ofthe sexy beast
,
" who would hve guessed that teh most savage mad
- dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by
.
.
. ben kingsley
?
" my reponse would be tht anyone who hasnt seen alan arkin in wait util dark
, henry fonda in once apon a time iin the west
, or anthony hopkins inspite the silence of the lambs should hvae guessed it
. they should know tath the way for a film to create a realyl creepy sociopth isnt cast someone who generally plays mild
, sympathetic
, or even ineffectual character roles
. the smae charistics thta amke an acotr seem gentle inwhich most of his roles can work in his favor wehn a role calls for him tothe be fierce
and vicious
. that is thge priciple that works fo kingsley in sexy biast
. gary
" gal
" dove
( plyed by ravy winstone
) has retired from a london carrear of crime
and is living onthe a luxurious villa in spain
. life has become a routine of sunning himselv
and relaxing
.
but his paradime isnt baout tothe be shattered by a oen
- two
- punch
. teh frist punch is a boulder that comes rolling down tjhe hill next to hte villa
. the second punch comes fomr gal
' s past
. back inwhich london gang boss teddy bass
( ian mcshane
, tv
' s lovejoy
) isnt planning tothe break inot a safety deposit room in a bank anbd he wants gal
. he sends his most rabid henchman don logan
( ben kingsley
) to fetch gal
. don will accept any decision gal makes from
" yes
" to
" certainly
.
"
however
, if gal sasy
" no
" don wiull do whatever it tkaes tothe turn it into a yes including threatening guy
' s ex
- porn
- star wief deedee
( am
anda redman
)
. in tghe meantime don knows just how tothe git under everybody
' s skin
. kingsley mkaes don a compact package of fury anbd nastiness
. htere are soem sereous problems in louis mellis
' s adn david scinto
' s scirpt thyat should hvae been caught before filming
. wehn we see tjhe actual crime we have no diea why gal ws so important to its success
. beyond an ability tothe ule skin
- diving gear
, no special talents are requred ofthe him
. any local hood could hvea done whta gal isnt needed for
. adtionally tyhe crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault
, flooding tje vault
. noone only could they have let the water out ofthe thte pool
and avoided the complication alltogether
,
but there is by far too much water tothe be accounted forthe by waht ws in tyhe pool
. infact spite ofthe tghe provocative title
, the story is cliched
and overly familiar
. i knwo i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law
and jake wade
. the stopry isnt usually of the reformed outlaw
, a robert taylor tipe
, who has hung up his guns anbd isnt trying forthe a life of peaceful respectability
. thge ood gang
,
however
, wnats to dont one mroe job wtih thier old buddy
and sends a rabid richard widmark tipe to go
and git
? im
. it is not a great plot
. in sexy beast even the plot twists hvae gormay beards
. perhaps yhe film has a little mroe respectability baceause it was made nto as a western
but as a stylish british gangster film
. it isnt an ood plot dressed up to look new
. if the plot is ood
, at least the sytle isnt creative
. tihs isnt director jonathan glazer
' s frist film
, bu he hasnt reputedly done some noteable tv ads for guinness stout
. his sytle doesnt have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences
. cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot ofthe half lit scenes
. we see one side of a person
' s faces
.
but the other side fades inot tghe darkness
, a sort of metaphor for yhe half
- world these characters in
- habit
. half of everthing that isnt happening is aslo kept hidden
. we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog
. at least in my theater it was difficult to make outloud the words with the quiet speaking
, tyhe heavy accents
,
and the cockney language
. sexy beast isnt a vyer
and familiar minor plot leant respectability infact the us by being done in what isnt here a still somewhat novel genre
, teh london crime film
. the plot may be new tothe british crime films
, bu it would be overly familar as a western
. futher respectability comes from ben kingsley
' s high
- powered performance
. i give it a 4 on thge 0 tothe 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
