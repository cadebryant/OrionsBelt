based onthe the 1960s tv series that i hadnt never seen or heard ofthe before htis movie
( be hapyp
, i won ' t bore you with any lame
adn unnecessary comparisions
)
, tihs film allows iwll smith to tkae a third stab at teh independendet day weekend box
- office
, affter scoring huge successes with men in black
( 7
/ 10
)
, directed by the same man who contolled htis oney
,
and independance day
( 6

)
. can you sday
.
.
. yhe thrid times not a charm
? plot
: james west
annd artemus gordon are chosen by the pesident tothe fidn teh man reponsible for the kidnapping of tjhe nation ' s top scientists
,
anbd threatening to tkae over the united states withing a week
. critique
: i doed not laugh once druing thsi entire picture
. whn yuo consider that this film is a part
- comedy
, tht ' s not a very ogod sign
. i also doed not tense up or prticularly enjoy any of its unenergetic acation sequences which provded me with little more thna a fewd mintues time to htink back to the lovley salma hayek scenes
. whn ytou concider tyhat thte otehr
" part
" ofthe thsi film is geared as an acation
/ adventure
, i owudl sday tyhat this anohter negitive sign
.
and when you consider thgat yhe first hour of the film was boring
anbd a littel slow
, tghe story
- line tired
, reminiscent ofthe swiss cheese
and uninvolving
,
anbd teh speical effects interesting
but worth very littel inside a plot filled with lame one
- liners
, weak characterizations
and an anti
- climactic end
, ytou pretty much ahev yhe gist ofthe my impression ofthe this
" big
" summer blockbuster
. it blows
. or as htey say in french
,
" eet blows
"
. coudl it be thyat tjhe scirpt was crappy because it tookover four peple to wriet it
? maybee
. could it be that most ofthe the spacial effects don ' t show up until the lastr half hour
,
and even
then
, we don ' t see anytying tyhat its trailers hadn ' t already given awya
? perhaps
. or could it be that we have cmo tothe expect so much more ffrom iwll smith
adn hollywood big
- budget movies
, tyhat we cannot help
bu evaluate them onthe a scale onto their own
? naaaaaaah
! a bad movei isnt a bad movei
. on a postive note
, i coudl honestly sday thgat i doed veyr much enjoy thge lovley performence by the adorable salma hayek
, who seemed underused
( in my humble oppinion
)
,
and lit up eveyr bubbly scene that she wass hardly in
. branagh was also funn as tyhe scenery
- munching
, over
- tghe
- top bad guy
,
but that ' s pretty much where the enteratinment
- buck stopped
. smith
adn kline were static at best
, thge plot full of holes
,
adn tghe socre insignificant
adn deriviative of a dozen others
. i owudl strongly advise anyone not tothe see this movei
.
thn agina
, htere isnt thyat oen scene with tjhe lovley salma hayek tied up inaddition a cage
.
.
. huh
.
