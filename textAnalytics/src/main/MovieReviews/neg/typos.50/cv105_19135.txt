based on the 1960s tv sories thyat i hadnt never seen or herad ofthe before this movei
( be hapyp
, i won
' t bore ytou withthe any lame
and unnecessary comparisons
)
, this film allows will smith tothe take a thrid stab at the independance day weekend box
- office
, affter scoring huge successes with men inaddition balck
( 7
/ 10
)
, directed by tje smae man who contolled thsi one
,
and independence day

. cant you say
.
.
. thte third times not a charm
? plot
: james west
and artemus gordon are choosen by the president to fidn tjhe man responsible fo the kidnapping ofthe thge nation
' s top scientists
, annd threatning tothe tkae over tjhe untied states withing a week
. critique
: i did nto laff once durig tihs entire picture
. whn ytou consider taht thsi film is a part
- comedy
, that
' s nto a very ogod sign
. i also did nto tense uv or paricularly enjoy any ofthe its unenergetic action sequences which provded me with littel moreso tahn a faw mintues time tothe htikn back to the lovely salma hayek scenes
. when yuo concider that thte otehr
" part
" ofthe tihs film is geared as an acation
/ adventure
, i would say tyhat this anohter negative sign
. adn wehn yuo concider tath the first hour ofthe thge film was boring anbd a little slow
, teh story
- line tired
, reminisent ofthe swiss cheese
and uninvolving
,
and the speshal effects intresting bu worth very littel inside a plot filled with lame oen
- liners
, weak characterizations annd an anti
- climactic end
, yuo preety much have the gist of my impression of this
" big
" summer blockbuster
. it blows
. or as tehy say in french
,
" eet blows
"
. could it be that the scirpt was crappy becouse it tookover four people to rwite it
? maybe
. could it be that most of the special effects don
' t sohw up until the lastest half hour
,
and even hten
, we don
' t see anytying taht its trailers hadn
' t already given awya
? perhasp
. or coudl it be thast we haev come to expect so much mroe from will smith anbd hollywood big
- budget movies
, that we cannot halp bu evaluate them on a scale onto their own
? naaaaaaah
! a bad movei is a bad movei
. onthe a positive onot
, i coudl honestly sday that i did very much enjoy tyhe lovley performance by hte adorable salma hayek
, who seemed underused
( in my humble opinion
)
, anbd lit uv every bubbly scene that she wass hardly iin
. branagh wass also funn as thge scenery
- munching
, over
- the
- top bad guy
,
but that
' s pretty much where tjhe entertainment
- buck stopped
. smith annd kline were static at best
, tjhe plot full of holes
, adn tje scoer insignificant
and derivitive ofthe a dozen others
. i would strongly advise anyone nto tothe see tihs movie
. hten agina
, ther is thyat oney scene wiht teh lovely salma hayek tied uv infact a cage
.
.
. huh
.
.
. oh yeah
, bu thge rest ofthe thge movie sucked
