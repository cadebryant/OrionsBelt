starship troopers isnt a bad movie
. i mean
, a really
, relaly
, bad movei
. nto only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood
, gore adn body parts shown onthe the screen
, it blissfully jumps over that line
, apparantly unaware that yhe movie trailers appeal to an audeince ofthe five to fifteen year olds
( ofthe which i saw many inaddition tghe theatre
)
. looking past the appalling sight ofthe overdone violence
, we are left with a movie wiht a thin plot at best
, no storng lead characters
, a blatant disregard for physics
,
and a vrey obvious naziesque theme
. that being said
, onto hte review
: the movei starts with a propog
anda message fomr tyhe federation
( who
' s logo bears a
* storng
* ressemblence to a nazi german eagle
)
, urging tje populace tothe go off annd fight the bugs
, who are attemting tothe destory earth
. the film shows larg rallies with young children in attendence
, pledging allegiace tothe tghe federation
( agian
, sound familiar
?
)
. as yhe movie progresses
, we are shown terror tactict training
, as a drill sargeant veyr graphically compound fractures one recruits arm
, anbd throws a nife through anyother
' s h
and
. eventually
, tje recruits embark onthe a journy tothe a location two thirds of thte way acrost tghe milky way galaxy
, to fight the bugs on theri hmeo planet
. as our faster thna light travelling
" heroes
" arrive on planet
, tehy drop onto the planet
, annd burst our ofthe their craft br
andishing
.
.
.
" what
?
" yuo sday
,
" lazer beam weapons
? sonic weapons
? phasers
? photon cannons
?
"
. nope
, htey hop out br
andishing good ood 1997 machine guns
, pump action rifles
, adn tactical nuculear weapons
! i guess a lot of physis money r
& d whent into travel adn nto weaponary
. as the assault beggins
, our group ofthe troopers are seen walking in a straight line thru a box canyon
. twpo members of tghe gropu notice rocks slipping
and falling above them
, anbd one even sees a streak fly by
, bu disregards it as nothing
. tihs of course
, leads to mroe massive carnage
, blood shed
, anbd graphic depictions ofthe limbs anbd heads bieng ripped
and severed from thier bodies
. again
, i see thgat miltary tactics inthe thge future must hvae evolved at baout the same pace as thier weapons
! iin the end
, we see neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris burst onto teh scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat
, hat
, anbd gloves
. he does a vulcan mind meld onthe tghe giant slug
, annd
then proclaims taht the bugs are scared
! thsi sets tghe troopers inot a frenzy
, as they are nowe one step closer tothe completing their goal
, total genocide of a speices
( again
, soudn familiar
?
?
)
. i have tried veyr hard not tothe step on annd spoil the plot wiht thsi review
,
but given it
' s non
- exisence
, i may have anyway
. i could go onthe fo pages ripping tihs movie appart
, bu don
' t want tothe bore ytou too badly
. in short
, i falt as if i were subjected tothe a mix vetween a pro
- nazi war film with bugs substituded forthe allies
, a drivers eduction accident scene film
,
and a complet blank screen
( the plot
, of course
)
. i wouldn
' t recomend thsi movie tothe anyone
, anyhwere
, under any circumstance
