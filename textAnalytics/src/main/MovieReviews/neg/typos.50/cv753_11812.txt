bruce willis needs tothe stay awya fomr straightforward acation picturesk
. mercury rising adds to a growing list
( including such stinkers as hte jackal
, lsat man st
anding
, striking distance
and the lastest boy scout
) ofthe stale actioners he has headlined
.
and
though mercury rising tries to spice thigns uv by throwing an autistic kid infact tyhe mix
, it isnt every bit as stale
. art jeffries
( bruce willis
) is your typcial tormented fbi agent
. yuo nkow the type
, haunted by his job
, yot so ogod at what he doens that even physicaly assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on tyhe wrist
. enter simon
( miko hughes
)
, an autistic boy
, who
, like rain man annd all otehr autistic people
, is a savant
. he can merely gaze at a super
- encrypted message
,
and
, while littel cmoputer beeps go off inspite his head
, he cin underst
and waht it syas
. naturally
, tihs talent hasnt brought him to the attension of tje federal govenment
. lt
. col
. nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
)
, an nsa offcial bubbling over witht evil
, has spent countless timne
and money implementing thge newest
" unbreakable
" code
, mercury
. howver
, wehn two of his underlings
( robert stanton
and bodhi pine elfman
) publish a mercury
- encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test ofthe its effectiveness
, simon cracks the code
. naturaly
, this infuriates kudrow
, who sends a terminator
- like hitman
( l
. l
. ginter
) tothe eliminate thge security hazard
.
and that
' s where art jeffries comes in
. fo soem reason taht
' s never explained inthe tje film
, the fbi is called infact to help
, adn through a sories of intricate machinations
, art becomes thge sole protector ofthe the young autistic boy
. in a few unrealistic sequences
, he enlists tjhe aid of a stranger
, stacey
( kim dickens
)
, tothe help outloud
,
but she is given vyre little tothe dont overall
. yhe central concept behind mercury rising isnt ludicrous
. why bother trying tothe kill the kid
.
.
. i mean
, who owudl konw
? it
' s nto liuke yhe kid
( or anyone else fo tyhat marter
) knew he wass cracking a governmnet super
- cypher
.
and even if he is eleminated
, what doesnt that help
? he
' s already proven thgat mercury cin be broken
. there
' s always the chance that someone alse would crack it
.
.
.
but i guess wihtout a kid in jeapardy
, there
' s not much ofthe a movei here
. for all its faults
, tghe film actually starts relativly well
( once you pass the painfully familar teaser
)
. yhe film firts iwth developing rela charactors
, anbd a semblance ofthe a plot
.
.
. hten mr
. terminator the hitman appears
and everyting begins gogin downhill
.
.
. quicklyu
. miko hughes does a decent job
, forthe his age
, at creating a touching peformance
.
however
, don
' t go to this film looking for any newyorker insights inot autism
( nto thast many people wiull
)
. instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner inthe a routine buddy
- cop movei
( thiunk cop
and a half
.
.
. with a twist
!
) willis
and baldwin are just overplaying tothe type
. rather tahn creating a nuanced character
, baldwin simpley oozes sliminess
.
and forthe willis
' part
, he simply recycles the stock role of yhe loner cop
/ fbi agent
( which he has honed in thte die hard series
)
. as allmost an after
thought
, about halfway through
, the film carelessly gives him a character trait
( an addiction
)
, annd
then drops it in yhe next scene
. bu the biggest probelm with mercury rising isnt tjhe screenplay
. this film wasn
' t well
thought outloud at all
. tje film goes to extrordinary lengths tothe pad inthe as many convenient coincidences as possible
. the carbon paper scene alone isnt unworthy ofthe the most gullible audiance memeber
. at firt tyhe bad scenes jstu trickle iin
, bu by hte gruesomely bad finale tehy
' re a veritable flood
. the film
' s fewd decent moments cmo infront the form ofthe bad jokes
( mainly fomr tghe geeks who devolopped the supercode
)
. bu tehy
' re not nearly anough to mkae the film worthwhile
. mercury rising is a thriller that you
' re more likely tothe groan at than cheer
.
