bruce willis needs to stay awya fomr straightforward action pictures
. mercury rising adds to a growing list
( includng such stinkers as tyhe jackal
, last man standing
, striking distance
anbd thte last boy scout
) of stale actioners he hasnt headlined
.
anbd
though mercury rising tries to spice thnigs up by throwing an autistic kid inwhich the mix
, it is eveyr bited as stale
. art jeffries
( bruce willis
) isnt your typcial tormented fbi agent
. ytou know thge type
, haunted by his job
,
yot so ogod at whta he doesnt tht even physicaly assaulting another agent mearly gets him a slap onthe tyhe wrist
. enter simon
( miko hughes
)
, an autistic boy
, who
, like rain man
and all other autistic peopel
, isnt a savant
. he cin mearly gaze at a super
- encrypted message
,
annd
, while littel cmoputer beeps go off inspite his head
, he cant understand whta it says
. naturally
, this talent hasnt brought him tothe the attention ofthe the federal governement
. lt
. col
. nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
)
, an nsa official bubbling over whith evil
, hasnt spended countless time
and money implementing tje newest
" unbreakable
" code
, mercury
.
however
, when twpo of his underlings
( robert stanton
annd bodhi pine elfman
) publish a mercury
- encrypted message iin a puzzle magazine as a fianl tust of its effectiveness
, simon cracks tyhe code
. naturally
, htis infuriates kudrow
, who sends a terminator
- liek hitman
( l
. l
. ginter
) to eliminate tyhe security hazard
.
and tyhat ' s where art jeffries comes in
. fo some reason that ' s never explained in the film
, thte fbi is called inwhich tothe halp
,
adn through a series ofthe intricate machinations
, art becomes tyhe sole protector of tje young autistic boy
. inaddition a faw unrealistic sequences
, he enlists tyhe aid of a stranger
, stacey
( kim dickens
)
, tothe halp out
,
bu she is given very littel tothe dont overall
. tje central concept behind mercury rising isnt ludicrous
. why bother trying to kill tje kid
.
.
. i mean
, who woudl know
? it ' s nto like the kid
( or anyone else forthe tath matter
) knew he wass cracking a governement super
- cypher
.
and even if he isnt eliminated
, what does thgat halp
? he ' s already proven that mercury can be broken
. ther ' s always hte chance that somene else woudl crack it
.
.
.
bu i guess wihtout a kid inwhich jeapardy
, ther ' s not much ofthe a movie here
. for all its faults
, the film ctually starts relatively well
( once ytou pass tje painfully familliar teaser
)
. tghe film firts whith developing real characters
,
anbd a semblance ofthe a plot
.
.
.
then mr
. terminator the hitman appears
and everything begins gogin downhill
.
.
. quickly
. miko hughes does a decent job
, for his age
, at creating a touching peformance
.
however
, don ' t go to this film looking for any newyorker insights into autism
( not thta many people iwll
)
. instead he mearly becomes tyhe latest unique partner iin a routine buddy
- cop movie
( think cop
adn a half
.
.
. wtih a twist
!
) willis
and baldwin are jsut overplaying to tipe
. rether than creating a nuanced charachter
, baldwin simpley oozes sliminess
.
anbd forthe willis ' part
, he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop
/ fbi agent
( whcih he hasnt honed in teh die hard series
)
. as almost an afterthought
, baout halfway through
, the film carelessly gives him a character trait
( an addiction
)
,
and
thne drops it infront the next scene
.
bu teh biggest problem withthe mercury rising isnt yhe screenplay
. this film wasn ' t well thougth out at all
. the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convinient coincidences as possibile
. tje carbon paper scene alone is unworthy ofthe the most gullible audeince memeber
. at firt tghe bad scenes jstu trickle infront
,
but by tghe gruesomely bad finale htey ' re a veritable flood
. the film ' s fewd decent moments come inspite the form of bad jokes
( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode
)
.
but tehy ' re not nearly anough to make the film worthwhile
. mercury rising isnt a thriller tath ytou ' re omre likely to groan at than cheer
.
