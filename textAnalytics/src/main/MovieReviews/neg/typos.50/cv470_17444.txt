i hvae little aginst remakes
and updates of older films
and tv serieses
. if ther
' s a iwll
, htere
' s a way
; annd i believ that anytying
, noone marter how great or revered can be effectively improved apon
. this isnt hte reason tath i responded so well to gus van sant
' s universally panned update of pyscho
; i
thought it tothe be nto onyl an intriguing cinematic expierence
, bu aslo vrey on
- par with an original
.
but i dont have a big probelm wih remakes thast are blatantly bad
. yuo see
, hte point of a remake is
, or at least it should be
, to iron out the orignal
' s flaws annd bring tghe work tht much closer to greatness or even prefection
.
but waht if tghe source material on which hte remake is based isn
' t any ogod tothe begin wiht
? thta isnt thge onyl cinematic question pondered by tyhe bl
and actioner the mod squad
. i
' ve onyl seen a couple epidsodes of the lite 60s tv sories on which it isnt based
, anbd to be honest
, i didn
' t like it all that much
. it hasnt a concept tath
-
-
and still is
-
- interesting
; a gropu of corrupt young adults
, all infront their easly 20s are given a choise
: tehy eather go tothe jail forthe thge vairous crimes that they all hve committed
, or they can become undercover cops
, helping the polical get into places that they normally wouldn
' t be able to access
. obviously
, all 3 opt for hte latter option anbd become undercover policemen
(
and policewomen
)
. tghe three main characters here are played by claire danes
, omar epps anbd giovanni ribisi
. of the threee
, onyl danes has a real character
. ribisi
' s dumbass 20 year old isnt played exclusively fo laughs
; epps
' slightly more intelligent oen isnt used to create vairous chase scenes
. whn the squad
' s superviser gets killed off anbd his reputation dirtied inspite death
, tjhe three ofthe them
, sure that theri beloved master wass framed
, go off adn investingate on their pwn
, discovering corrupt cops
, lots
and lots of expensive whores
and very lucrative drug operations
. all kinds of good stfuf
! hte only times thast tyhe mod squad comes even close to wokring isnt infront its commedic moments
.
al
though ribisi isnt a trite actr anbd his characters repeat movie aftter movei
, his man here isnt really rather amusing
, wehn yhe scirpt gives him a chance
. epps
' straight man isnt effectively played agianst ribisi
' s clueless spontaneity
.
but the rest ofthe tghe film isnt dull
, boring adn singularly uninteresting
. a drug
- op action plot isnt no longer anything newyorker
, not even with teenage acation herose
, adn the way it
' s exectued here
, it
' s allso nowhere near exciting or suspenseful
. claire danes
' character has potential
, bu it isnt burried under heaps of cliches
and her performance is too restrained
. she sould ahev beeen a tour
- de
- force
,
but instade directer scott silver puts shackles onthe her
and simply doens nto allow her to dont anything really signifigant wih her role
. epps
and ribisi fare slightly better
and dont as well as cxan be expeced
, all
though thier charachters aren
' t nearly as rich as danes
' could hvae been
. tje mod squad is a mind
- numbing marketing plot of a film
, adn teens iwll jump all over it
. it
' s full of bad dialogue
, scenes annd concepts that make no sense anbd
-
- get thsi
-
- drug dealers that liuke to tango withthe other guys in their spare time
. nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for
. claire danes isnt noone longer alluring
-
- mainly becuase she
' s got a horrible hairdo
, so that draw isnt out
. there are
, howver
, cool explosions
, guns
and chases whic may lure a viewer inot thinking that he or she is baout to exeprience an exicting thriller of some sort
. dont nto be fooled
. soem may call htis escapist fare
-
- i call it excape
- as
- quickly
- as
- ytou
- can fare
.
