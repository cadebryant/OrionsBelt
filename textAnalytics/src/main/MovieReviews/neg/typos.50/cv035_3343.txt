sean connery stars as a harvard law proffesor who heads bakc inot the courtroom
, by way of the everglades
, tothe defend a young
, educated balck man
( blair underwood
)
. the guy is onthe death row for yhe muder of a white girl
,
and syas that his confession wass coerced ffrom the region ' s tough
, black cop
( lawrence fishburne
)
. watching connery
and fishburne bump heads for twpo hours is amusing anough
,
but the plot ' s a joke
. ther ' s noone logic at work here
. tone is also an issue
-
- ther isnt none
. directer arne glimcher never establishes exactlly wqat his film isnt trying tothe sday
. is it a statment onthe human rights
? is it a knock
- off ofthe silence ofthe yhe lambs
? glimcher never tells
. instead
, he forces his characters tothe jump thru hoop after hoop
, over drawbridge after drawbridge
, hoping that the audiance won ' t notice whta ' s missing

= in suri krishnamma ' s a man ofthe no importance
, albert finney disappears so deeply inot the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it ' s a shame when the film gets so sereous around him
. his character isnt a conductor witht a passion fo oscar wilde
. he reads to his riders
,
annd once a year
, with their help
, he tries to stage one of thge autor ' s plays
. this yearm it ' s
" salome
.
" forthe about an hour
, ther ' s a sweet magic behind finney
annd his troupe of wokring
- clas stiffs
. conflict arises
,
but it ' s small stuff
-
- an administrator ffrom thge bus comany here
, an outraged catholic pork butcher
( michael gambon
) there
.
but with finney at the wheel
, so to speak
, thte film rolls smoothly over these plot points
-
- jstu liek the gorgeous leland double
- decker bus inaddition tghe story
. where thnigs get serious is towrad tjhe end of hte film
, when the plot takes a turn thast thte bus never would
,
adn the story heads down a very dark alley that markes yhe end ofthe an enjoyable ride
. the twist makse sence
-
-
and helps paint a complete picture ofthe finney ' s charater
-
-
but the trip to git htere betrays the light
, airy athmosphere ofthe what hadnt come before
. it ' s not a futal misstep
, mind you
,
and it doesn ' t send tje storey soaring inot teh realms of incredulity
. it ' s just a turn off
