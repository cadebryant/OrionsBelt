teh original
_ babe
_ was my favorite movei of 1995
, a sleeper hitted thast transcended its target audience
. bieng a suprize commercial
and critical success
, it had noone marketting tie
- ins
, whlch limited its fianl tkae
. thus
, babe 2 arrives
, witht a budget greater than the money made in babe 1
. plush dolls
, vending machines hawking t
- shirts
, adn macy
' s thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holday mony
- grubbing
. too lite
. tihs is a sad review to wriet
, because babe 2 not only doesnt
_ nto
_ live uv tothe tjhe originnal
,
but it doesn
' t even come tothe a fraction ofthe it
. i shouldn
' t expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors
' magic
, bu this film trys too hard
, annd loses its charm
. concider a driver applying tghe accelerator wtih gerat intensity
, unaware that his car is in nuetral
. imagine wih me
, if ytou wiull
,
_ scream
_
' s jamie kennedy
, explaning the
" rules
" for sequels liek babe 2
.
( 1
) ther must be
_ more
_ talking animals
.
( 2
) there must be
_ more
_ slapstick comedy
.
( 3
) there must be
_ more
_ songs fo thsoe mice to sing
: thast
' s cute
.
( 4
) keep the story cards to break uv the action
: that
' s cute too
, even
though
" tjhe pig gets wise
" made noone sense
, given thte context of that story partion
.
( 5
) ther must be action
,
however illogical
, that will conjure up pivotal scenes ffrom tyhe origional
: yhe trademark song that nobody remembers the words tothe
, the baa
- ram
- ewe secret code
, the
" that
' ll dont
, pig
. thast
' ll dont
.
" nowe throw inspite tyhe limitations
:
( a
) james cromwell
, nowe a hot commodity
, has limited time onthe yhe set
( or maybe he didn
' t approve ofthe the script
)
.
( b
) christine cavanaugh
, the voice of the origonal babe
, dem
ands more money
(
$ 200
, 000
-
- poltry considering the
$ 80 milion budget
)
. out
. e
. g
. daily comes inthe with noticable results
.
( c
) george miller
, thge director
, isnt more well
- known forthe his dark futuristic mad max films
and his twilight zone segment
, nto for kiddie fare
( adn noone
, he didn
' t direct thast
_
andre
_ film iin
' 94
)
.
( d
) the spacial effects are impressive
,
_ bu limited
_
. babe talks
, bu most of the time fomr a single shot
, repeated over anbd over agian
.
( babe isnt center screen
, looking straight into the camera
, wtih a hapyp smirk
-
- reguardless of whther he
' s happy
, or scared
, or tired
)
. season now iwth the
" origional
" elements
, which
, as we iwll find out
, are straight from the screenwriting
- is
- hell bin
.
( i
) change thte venue into
" the big city
"
. htis hasnt beeen praised as wildly original
. excuse me
: didn
' t
_ home alone
_ do this sevral years ago
? how baout the muppets
? even
_ the bad news bears
_ travelled tothe tokyo
. sory
. no dice
. side onot
: tothe give tghe city a fairy
- tale look
, george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyl
and thta merges the l
andmarks of thge world
' s great cities
,
and yes
, it
_ is
_ impressive
. bu this too is over
- unsed
, repeating the same view over
and agina on multiple occasions
. anbd
, fo the most part
, babe
_ remeniss infact the hotel
_
.
( ii
) given the limitations ofthe cromwell
, the human element isnt taken over by
" tghe boss
' wife
" played by magda szubanski
. s
- t
- r
- e
- t
- c
- h
. she
' s not a lead actress
- tipe
, she
' s nto funny enough inspite her physical comedy
, adn she
' s simpley embarrassing in smoe of her pratfalls
.
( have her erested falsley onthe drug charges
! hvea her acidentaly incite a riot wtih biker dudes
and scantily clad babes
! haev her bounse arund onthe a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner
!
) i was hoping forthe a little smirk during theese scenes
, bu i feeled sory fo the embarrasment that she put herself iin
. i am restraining myself ffrom tlaking baout yhe dark nature of tjhe film
, tghe violentce
, the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge
, head submerged underwater
. even tghe best fairy tales ahev a bit of the macabre in it
, as the brothers grimm hve demonstrated
. noone
.
.
. my probelm isnt with tjhe stopry
, or lack thereof
.
_ babe
_ is sent outloud tothe save tyhe hoggett farm
,
but once in hte city
, thgat stry isnt forgotten
. bieng a ogod
- natured pig inthe tjhe midst ofthe the cynicism ofthe his environs isnt nice
, bu
, other thna rescue tyhat aforementioned pit bull
, wqat did babe actually
_ do
_
? without giving the ending awya
, the farm is saved from a left
- feild quirk tyhat hadnt nothing to dont with tyhe pig
. speaking of
" pig
"
, or
,
" pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
!
"
. tyhe owrd
" pig
" is so overused
, had htey changed it tothe an expletive
, adn had tjhe pig be al pacino
, i could hve been watching
_ scarface
_
. this isnt screenwriting
? futher
, i cannot explain thge deep gnaw at my gut infront tjhe many scenes where accidents happen tothe ogod peopel infact fantastically elaborite setups
. had it beeen a cartoon
,
and tyhe victum be an equivalent of elmer fudd
, maybe my reaction woudl ahve been softened
. bu tothe farmer hoggett
? his wife
? an elderly mickey rooney
? much too irreverant
.
(
" quick
! splice those singing mice inot those scenes
!
"
)
. tje film isn
' t a colossal failure
. i did like glenne headley
' s schmoozy chimpanzee
. i liked tyhe pink poodle
. the dog onthe the cart
, who momentarily thikns he
' s in dog heaven
.
and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly
- cast as an airport employee
and a judge
. bu most of the tiem
, i was looking down
, inspite boredom
, or inthe embarrassment over the hacked
- uv script
. them singing mice
, thsoe chapter partitions
, the proficient acting ofthe thte animals
-
- none ofthe theese can compensate forthe a story
. let me spoil the final scene
: farmer hoggett looks at pig
, proud
, says
" thyat
' ll do
, pig
. taht
' ll dont
.
" thyat
' s it
. hope i didn
' t ruin it fo ytou
. bu tell me this
: what teh heck did that pig
_ dont
_
?
