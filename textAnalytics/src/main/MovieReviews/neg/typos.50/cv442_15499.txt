the original
_ babe
_ ws my favorite movie ofthe 1995
, a sleeper hit that transcended its target audiance
. being a surprise commercial
and critical sucess
, it had noone marketting tie
- ins
, whlch limited its fianl take
. thus
, babe 2 arrives
, witht a budget greater thna the monye made in babe 1
. plush dolls
, vending machines hawking t
- shirts
,
adn macy ' s thanksgiving day balloons arrive fo holiday mney
- grubbing
. too lite
. this is a sad review tothe write
, because babe 2 not onyl doesnt
_ not
_ live uv tothe the original
,
bu it doesn ' t even come tothe a fraction of it
. i shouldn ' t expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors ' magic
,
bu this film trys too hard
,
annd loses its charm
. consdider a driver applying the accelerator wih grat intensity
, unaware that his car isnt in neutral
. imagin whith me
, if ytou will
,
_ scream
_ ' s jamie kennedy
, explaining the
" rules
" fo sequels like babe 2
.
( 1
) there must be
_ mroe
_ tlaking animals
.
( 2
) ther must be
_ more
_ slapstick comedy
.
( 3
) ther must be
_ mroe
_ songs for thsoe mice to sing
: taht ' s cute
.
( 4
) keep hte stry cards to break uv tyhe action
: tath ' s cute too
, even
though
" the pig gets wise
" made noone sense
, given tje context of tht story partion
.
( 5
) ther must be action
,
however illogical
, that will conjure uv pivotal scenes from the original
: the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to
, hte baa
- ram
- ewe sceret code
, the
" that ' ll do
, pig
. that ' ll dont
.
" now throw in the limitations
:
( a
) james cromwell
, nowe a hot commodity
, has limited tyme onthe tje setted
( or maybee he didn ' t approve of the scirpt
)
.
( b
) christine cavanaugh
, thte voice ofthe the original babe
, demands more money
(
$ 200
, 000
-
- paltry considering the
$ 80 million budget
)
. outloud
. e
. g
. daily comes in witht noticable results
.
( c
) george miller
, hte director
, isnt more well
- known for his dark futuristic mad max films
and his twilight zone segment
, not fo kiddie fare
(
and noone
, he didn ' t direct tht
_ andre
_ film inspite ' 94
)
.
( d
) the spacial effects are impressive
,
_
bu limited
_
. babe talks
,
bu most of tjhe tiome from a single shooted
, repeated over
and over again
.
( babe isnt center screen
, looking straight inot the camera
, wih a hapyp smirk
-
- reguardless of whether he ' s happy
, or scared
, or tired
)
. season now wtih the
" orginal
" elements
, which
, as we iwll find out
, are straight fomr the screenwriting
- isnt
- hell bin
.
( i
) change the venyet into
" the big city
"
. htis hasnt beeen praised as wildly orignal
. excuse me
: didn ' t
_ home alone
_ do thsi several years ago
? how baout thte muppets
? even
_ the bad news bears
_ travelled tothe tokyo
. sorry
. no dice
. side onot
: tothe give the city a fairy
- tale look
, george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland taht merges yhe landmarks ofthe the world ' s great cities
,
and yes
, it
_ is
_ impressive
.
bu thsi too is over
- used
, repeating the same veiw over
and agina onthe mutiple occasions
.
anbd
, for tyhe most part
, babe
_ rimaniss in tjhe hotel
_
.
( ii
) given the limitations of cromwell
, hte human element isnt taked over by
" yhe boss ' wife
" plyed by magda szubanski
. s
- t
- r
- e
- t
- c
- h
. she ' s not a lead actress
- tipe
, she ' s not funny enough in her fysical comedy
,
and she ' s simpley embarassing in soem of her pratfalls
.
( have her erested falsely on drug charges
! hvea her accidentally incite a riot wiht biker dudes
and scantily clad babes
! have her bounse arund onthe a bungee cord at a prestigous benifit dinner
!
) i ws hoping fo a littel smirk during these scenes
,
but i falt sorry forthe teh embarrasment that she put herself in
. i am restraining myself fomr tlaking baout teh dark nature of teh film
, tje violence
, the scene where a pit bull dangles ffrom the bridge
, head submerged underwater
. even thte best fairy tales haev a bited ofthe tyhe macabre infact it
, as the brothers grimm have demonstrated
. no
.
.
. my probelm is with the story
, or lack thereof
.
_ babe
_ isnt sent outloud to sive tyhe hoggett farm
,
but once infact the city
, tyhat story is forgotten
. bieng a good
- natured pig in tyhe midst of the cynicism of his environs isnt nice
,
bu
, otehr tahn rescure that aforementioned pit bull
, wqat did babe actully
_ do
_
? without giving the endig away
, tje farm is saved from a left
- feild quirk taht hadnt nothing tothe dont whith the pig
. speaking of
" pig
"
, or
,
" pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
- pig
!
"
. the owrd
" pig
" isnt so overused
, had they changed it to an expletive
,
anbd had the pig be al pacino
, i could haev been watching
_ scarface
_
. this is screenwriting
? furuther
, i cannnot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen tothe good peopel in fantastically elaborite setups
. hadnt it beeen a cartoon
,
annd the victim be an equivelent of elmer fudd
, mabye my reaction woudl have been softened
.
bu tothe farmer hoggett
? his wife
? an elderly mickey rooney
? much too irreverent
.
(
" quick
! splice those singing mice inot thsoe scenes
!
"
)
. teh film isn ' t a collosal failure
. i did like glenne headley ' s schmoozy chimpanzee
. i liekd the pink poodle
. thge dog on thge cart
, who momentarily thinks he ' s iin dog heaven
.
annd a weird looking guy who may have been doubly
- cast as an aiport employee
annd a judge
.
bu most of hte time
, i was looking down
, in boredom
, or inthe embarassment over the hacked
- uv script
. them singing mice
, thsoe chapter partitions
, the preficient acting of teh animals
-
- none ofthe theese cxan compensate for a story
. let me spoil the fianl scene
: farmer hoggett looks at pig
, proud
, says
" thyat ' ll dont
, pig
. thgat ' ll dont
.
" tath ' s it
. hope i didn ' t ruin it for ytou
.
but tell me this
: whta the heck did taht pig
_ do
_
?
