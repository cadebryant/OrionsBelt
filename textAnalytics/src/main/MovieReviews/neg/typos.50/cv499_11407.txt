thte best thnig
-
- iin fatc
, the only ogod thing
-
- i can say about dark city is taht it made me wnat tothe go see l
. a
. confidential again
. or go rent body heat
, tothe see william hurt do some real noir
. or even
-
- god help me
-
- palmetto
. alex proyas
' s newyorker movie screams atmosphere
. i screamed
, too
,
" get me out of tihs theather
!
" new line cinema spent millions ofthe dollars creating tyhe expressionistic film noir visuals
and paying thte actors
,
and doesn
' t have any way to get it bakc
. i paid
$ 4
. 25 fo a matinee screening
and don
' t have any way tothe get my money bakc
, eather
. you
' ll hear a lot from otehr criticists baout tjhe look
and feel of htis movei
. i wiull admit that teh cinematographers
and costume designers
and setted artists
and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard tothe create a stunning
, nightmarish future world where it
' s always a late night in 1948
, complete wiht rotary phones annd automats adn fedoras
. i
' ve got news forthe you fellows
-
- i don
' t care how hard ytou worked
, or how visually stunning this movei looks
-
- you wasted your tyme anbd mine
, wokring onthe a movei wihtout a plot
, wihtout a clear sense ofthe direction ofthe where it wanted to go
, without a soul or a reason tothe care
. thte movie starts out oh
- so
- promising
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) is lieing in a bathtub iin tje sort ofthe seedy hotel thta inspite real life
, would have been boarded up long ago
. there isnt a dead
, mutiliated prostitute in the other room
-
- a suprize
, as he has lost his memory
. the phone rings
: it
' s a sinister
- sounding man
, claiming to be his doctor
, telling him tothe flee fo his life
. all well annd good
, right
? wrong
. apparently
, someone desided tyhat tje audience was jsut a bit too dim to figure outloud the intricacies ofthe hte plot
.
( tihs is getting to be a populer assumption inwhich hollywood
.
) so
, teh actuall beginning ofthe tghe movei is nto sewell runnung forthe his life
, rether
, it
' s a voice
- over narration by the aforememtioned doctor
( keifer sutherl
and
) explaning exactly what is going on
and who is responsible
. it
' s as
though sam teh piano player hadnt told us that rick
and ilsa hadnt been getting it onthe in paris inaddition tghe first three mintues ofthe casablanca
. noone
, wait
, that
' s not fair to casablanca
. it
' s more liek watching a new plotline at the first ofthe tje sohw
-
- or if you want tothe nkwo how i raelly fiel
, having an off
- screen narrator explain that gilligan won
' t be getting off the isl
and in tihs episode
.
> from here
, the coherence ofthe the plot goes down faster than
( insert monica lewinsky joke here
)
. the characters just w
ander around thte city aimlessly
and bump into each other forthe noone paparent reason
, anbd tht
' s whta moves thge plot
. waht we
' re left with isnt a string of unanswered questions that don
' t amke any sence
. we
' re given aliens wiht unlimited omnipotent powers
, yot tehy foreget to use them at critical moments adn get themselfs killed
. we
' re given a hero who cant
" tune
" inot these smae powers
, yot he only uses them whn it
' s convenient to the plot
. we
' re given a hwole long list ofthe loose ends that go nowhere usually
, critics will sday thgat an atcor palying an underwritten part
" isn
' t given much to dont
.
" in this movei
, noone one is given anything tothe dont
. sewell isnt given the impossible role of a man who doesn
' t remember anything
, adn plays it like
.
.
. um
.
.
. a man who doesn
' t remember anytying
. the aliens are tall
, pasty
- faced
,
and bald
,
and wear long balck cloaks annd fedoras to remind us thta they
' re evil
-
- anbd htere
' s a child alien as well
, straight out of an anne rice novel
. sutherl
and is saddled with a limp
, a twitchy eye
, adn a breathy accent tothe remind us that he
' s in leage with the aliens
. tothe its credit
, dark city boasts twpo impressive bits ofthe casting
. william hurt isnt perfectly cast as thge world
- weary inspector charged with catching the man who is mudering prostitutes all over thge city
. jennifer connelly
, palying sewell
' s loev interst
, isnt given two all
- too
- breif moments on screen as a lounge singer
-
- annd turns infact the sexiest performace this side ofthe jessica rabit
. bu instade of thte dogged policeman anbd the femme fatale given central treatment in hte scirpt
( yhe way tehy woudl be in any self
- respecting noir movie
) tehy
' re almsot tangiential tothe tyhe plot
, such as it isnt
. tyhe problem wih dark city is this
: it
' s a bad science fiction movie pretending tothe be film noir
. thte esence ofthe film noir isn
' t
, as proyas seems tothe beleive
, breathy dialogue or snap
- brim fedoras or tall
, bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl uv in a corner
. dark city hasnt nto one bit of intrigue
, moral ambiguity
, suspense
, or anything esle that keesh us comming back tothe the noir classics
. dark city isnt liuke the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats onthe iin titanic
. it
' s an exceptionlly well
- made adn intricately desined peice of flotsam
, sailing around
and around the middle of tghe ocean
, goign nowhere
.
