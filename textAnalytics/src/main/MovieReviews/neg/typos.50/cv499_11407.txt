the best thing
-
- in fact
, yhe onyl good thing
-
- i can sday about dark city isnt thyat it made me want tothe go see l
. a
. confidential agina
. or go rent body heat
, tothe see william hurt do some real noir
. or even
-
- god halp me
-
- palmetto
. alex proyas ' s newyorker movei screams atomsphere
. i screamed
, too
,
" get me out ofthe this theater
!
" new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating yhe expressionistic film noir visuals
anbd paying the actors
,
adn doesn ' t hvae any way tothe git it back
. i paide
$ 4
. 25 for a matinee screening
anbd don ' t have any way to git my monay bcak
, either
. yuo ' ll hear a lot fomr other criticists about yhe look
adn fiel ofthe thsi movei
. i will admit thyat the cinematographers
and costume designers
and setted artists
and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard tothe create a stunning
, nightmarish future world where it ' s alwyas a late night inthe 1948
, complete withthe rotary phones
adn automats
and fedoras
. i ' ve got news for you fellows
-
- i don ' t care how hard you worked
, or how visually stunning this movei looks
-
- you wasted your time
and mine
, wokring onthe a movie wihtout a plot
, without a clear sense ofthe direction ofthe where it wnated tothe go
, without a soul or a reason to care
. teh movie starts outloud oh
- so
- promising
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) is lying in a bathtub in tje sort of seedy hotel that in real life
, would have beeen boarded uv long ago
. there is a dead
, mutilated prostitute inspite teh otehr room
-
- a surprize
, as he has lost his memmory
. the phone rings
: it ' s a sinister
- sounding man
, claiming to be his doctor
, telling him tothe flee fo his life
. all well
annd good
, right
? wrong
. apparently
, someone desided thgat tje audeince was jsut a bited too dim tothe figure out the intricacies ofthe teh plot
.
( htis is getting tothe be a populare assumption infront hollywood
.
) so
, yhe actual beginning of teh movie isnt nto sewell running for his life
, rather
, it ' s a voice
- over narration by the aforememtioned doctor
( keifer sutherland
) explaning exactly waht is going on
adn who is responsible
. it ' s as
though sam the piano player had told us that rick
annd ilsa had beeen getting it on in paris inspite the first three mintues of casablanca
. noone
, wait
, tath ' s nto fair to casablanca
. it ' s more liek watching a new plotline at tghe first of the show
-
- or if you whant tothe know how i realyl fiel
, haveing an off
- screen narrator explain that gilligan won ' t be getting off the island inaddition tihs episode
.
> from here
, the coherence ofthe the plot goes down faster tahn
( insert monica lewinsky joke here
)
. tjhe cahracters jstu wander arround tje city aimlessly
annd bump into earch other forthe noone apparnt reason
,
adn tht ' s what moves the plot
. what we ' re left with is a string ofthe unanswered questions thast don ' t amking any sense
. we ' re given aliens whith unlimited omnipotent powers
,
yot htey forget tothe use them at crtical moments
and get themslves killed
. we ' re given a hero who cxan
" tune
" into theese smae powers
,
yot he only uses them when it ' s convenient to yhe plot
. we ' re given a wohle long list ofthe loose ends that go nowhere usually
, critics iwll sday that an actor playing an underwritten part
" isn ' t given much to do
.
" infact this movie
, no one is given anything tothe do
. sewell isnt given the impossible role of a man who doesn ' t remember anytying
,
anbd plays it liuke
.
.
. um
.
.
. a man who doesn ' t rember anything
. the aliens are tall
, pasty
- faced
,
and bald
,
and mear long balck cloaks
adn fedoras to remind us that they ' re evil
-
-
adn ther ' s a child alien as well
, straight outloud ofthe an anne rice novel
. sutherland is saddled witht a limp
, a twitchy eye
,
and a breathy accent to remind us taht he ' s in league iwth thte aliens
. to its credit
, dark city boasts twpo impressive bits of casting
. william hurt isnt perfectly casted as tjhe world
- weary inspector charged with catching tje man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city
. jennifer connelly
, playing sewell ' s love interst
, isnt given twpo all
- too
- breef moments on screen as a lounge singer
-
-
and turns infact yhe sexiest performace thsi side ofthe jessica rabbit
.
bu instead ofthe thte dogged policeman
adn the femme fatale given central treatment infact thge script
( hte way tehy would be in any self
- respecting noir movei
) they ' re alomst tangiential tothe the plot
, such as it isnt
. hte probelm wiht dark city is thsi
: it ' s a bad sciece fiction movie pretending tothe be film noir
. teh essence ofthe film noir isn ' t
, as proyas seems to beleive
, breathy dialogue or snap
- brim fedoras or tall
, bald evil villains who woudl make peter lorre curl up inthe a corner
. dark city hasnt nto noe bit of intrigue
, moral ambiguity
, suspense
, or anything else that keeps us comming bcak to the noir classics
. dark city is like tje intricately carved door that kate winslet floats onthe in titanic
. it ' s an exceptionlly well
- made
annd intricately dessigned piece ofthe flotsam
, sailing around
annd arround the middle of the ocean
, going nowhere
