several days after having seen this movie
, i
' m still trying to determine whta directer christopher guest
, a man whose sence of humor i usually apprieciate
, foudn funny infact either thge consept or the excecution of allmost heoes
. this isnt a dreadful motion picture
? a lowbrow example ofthe period peice comedy with terrable production values
and an exceptionally poore laughs
- to
- jokes ratio
. there
' s a kind of desperation in tyhe movei
' s approch to humer that reveals teh film makers
' uncertainity baout how entertaining the material isnt
; hte manic sytle betrays itself as a lastr
- ditch attept tothe hide the flaws of a failed script
. the premise doesn
' t soudn especialy amusing to beign wiht
? alomst heroes tells tjhe tale ofthe twpo explorers
, tghe effeminate leslie edwards
( matthew perry
) annd the uncouth bartholomew hunt
( chris farley
)
, who are racing lewis
and clark on teh trip to the american northwest
. edwards adn hunt are accompanied by tghe kinds ofthe weirdoes we fidn in road movies
( albeit ofthe the early
- 19th centruy variety
)
, including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claimes tothe speak hundreds of laguages
( none ofthe whihc prove to be usefull
)
, a pretty indian maiden who turns inot thge obligatory lveo interst
,
and a bizarre man who suffers a sories ofthe debilitating injuries
. allong the way
, the intrepid explorers encounter bears
, bald eagles
, aging native american warrriors
,
and a conquistador named hildago
( kevin dunn
) who raves about his beautiful hair
. teh explorers
' trak takes them through forests
, accross hte snow
- capped rocky montains
,
and over a waterfall
. thsi setup leads to a lot ofthe shouting
, a great deel ofthe lunacy
,
and vrey faw laughs
. farley engages in his usual shtick ofthe falling down anbd bellowing
,
but
, aside fomr an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle
, his heart doesn
' t seem to be in it
. matthew perry
, oen ofthe tjhe stars ofthe tv
' s friends
( who had soem modest succes infront teh rumatic comedy
, fools rush infact
) is badly miscast
. as a foil for farley
and an antidote to his runaway energy
, perry lacks tghe nessacary edge ofthe tjhe proverbial straight man
. i
' m nto a big fan ofthe david spade
, anbd i didn
' t like tommy boy
, bu at least he
and farley worked well together
. as far as teh supporting players go
, none ofthe them makse omre than a fleeting impression
. eugene levy is wasted
,
and kevin dunn is baout as intresting here as he is inaddition godzilla
. frankly
, it
' s a disappointment to see something this dumb adn ugli come from christopher guest
, thge brillant comic force behind such films as this isnt spinal tap
, tyhe big picture
,
and waiting for guffman
.
al
though guest gets the costumes right
, thsi nearly
- inconsequential succes isnt noone substitute forthe the weak script anbd unfunny execution
. the special effects
, such as they are
, are execrable
. forthe an exemple ofthe some really poore blue screen owrk
, look at the scenes where the charachters are shooting the rapids
( they
' re obviously getting buckets ofthe water thrown onthe them
) adn where farley isnt being carried off by an eagle
. even
though farley didn
' t ahev tghe most stellar of acting careers
, he doesn
' t deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes
. hwile some ofthe the more outrageous attempts at humer may coax a fewd guffaws from 12
- yera old boys
, hte level ofthe comedy infront alomst heroes falls far below tje levle ofthe sophomoric
. farley fans who see htis film as a way to say goodbye shoud be commended for their loyalty
, usance it takes rela stamina to stay seated fo tghe full runing lenght of htis cinematic torture session
.
