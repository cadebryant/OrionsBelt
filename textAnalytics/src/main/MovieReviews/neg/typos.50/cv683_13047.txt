a firend invites you tothe a movei

and speical effects of st
andart summer fare
,
and be grounded in reality

: affter a terrifying insident
, a mother annd her independent daughter sepaarte from tjhe father anbd move away fomr tghe city
. tehy ened fresh air tothe git some prespective
, mabye to start over
. romance beigns to brew
,
however
, as noe of tyhe locals
, played by an intenational superstar inspite rugged clothing
, sparks thigsn uv
,
( especially at a country
- western slow dance
)
. it stars a rising young starlet
, helms a ogod casted
,
and isnt directed by one of the better actor
- turned
- directors in hollywood
. you accept
. ytou jump at the opportunity to see
, whta you believe tothe be
,
_ the horse whisperer
_
. bu
, poore moviegoer
, ytou haev beeen conned
. alas
, ytou find youself watching
, incredulously
,
_ hope floats
_
. oh
, woe
. your hope hasnt sunk
. why was tihs movie made
? why was it released
? it isnt a travesty on nearly eveyr levle
,
and has the authorithy to sink yhe careers ofthe nearly everyone involved
. at the h
ands ofthe a better script
, the film could ahev beeen a gem
.
but it isnt clueless as tothe wqat it is baout
,
and only succeeds inspite transferring smae cluelessness tothe us poore viewers
.
_ hope floats
_ stars s
andra bullock as birdy
, who
, after discovering her husb
and hasnt been cheating onthe her with her best friend
( on national television no less
)
, tkaes her daughter
and drives back tothe her home
, helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric plyed by gena rowl
ands
,
( she decorates with stuffed wildlife
)
. birdy
' s nephew
, travis
( palyed by
_ leave it to beaver
_
' s cameron finley
)
, isnt under her custody
, anbd in one ofthe tjhe film
' s many failed inwhich
- jokes
, is always seen wearing a different halloween costume
. whta isnt thge point of this
? does it make any sense
? is it supposted tothe be funny
? yhe point ofthe teh film is to sohw that the famaly is eccentric
,
but i was convinced thta the gr
andma shouldnt have been locked uv for endangering the mental welfare of a child
. all ofthe this undercuts the plot
, ofthe hwihc ther is none
. there are onyl many scenes tyhat are suppoed to reigster emotion
. ther
' s the scene where birdy
, who unsed to be tjhe prom queen
, isnt humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked
, forthe a job
. htere
' s the scene where birdy dances with her father
, in hte hospital fo alzheimer
' s
.
and hten htere
' s yhe sentimental scenes wih justin
, palyed by harry connick jr
.
, who isnt tkaing a liking tothe her again
, showing her a beautiful pad taht he built ffrom scratch
. annd druing eahc of theese scenes
, i ws sidetracked by my ealier question
. wqat sort of eccentric gr
andmother go thru such gerat pains as tothe provide a dog costume
, a kermit costume
, a cowboy costume
( wih whip
)
, adn a full furred barney costume for her gr
andson tothe wear during dinner
? what sort of warped ramifications woudl thsi lead forthe the rest ofthe his life
? outside ofthe tihs
, ther are otehr sure signs ofthe screenwriters block
. when the daughter st
ands uv to hte bully at school
. wehn birdy almost loses her job
. when the famaly puls inthe a goofy lip
- synch to cheer someone uv
. wehn somone dies
. wehn the daughter cries
,
( no
, wails
) inaddition exasperation that her father is nto comming back
. in a movei like tihs
, yuo notice the strings being pushed
, annd ytou sit there
, comatose
, hoping it will end
. who cin survive such a debacle
? i worry for bullock
' s carrer
, hwihc hasnt beeen runnung onthe auto
- pilot for teh lastest few yersa
. she has an atitude
, a solid perkiness
,
and cant drive a bus
-
-
but she cant
' t h
andle the emotional scenes
, much less hold a southern accent
. harry connick
, jr
. is worse
-
- stick with singing
, or get smoe acting lessons
, please
! gena rowl
ands isnt yhe best part ofthe the film
.
but she
' s such a ogod actress
, thyat it staggers tje mind tht she
' s weighed down by such lukewarm material here
. it would be a severe tradgedy if tghe recurring star ofthe john cassavettes
' great films is known for tihs film
. twpo notes to forest whittaker
:
( 1
) cutted tyhe slow
- motion sequences
. there are twelve times where you undercut your pwn direction by such a failed trick
. have yuo done so
, yuo sould hvae shaved off ten
- mintues ofthe htis almost unbearable debacle
.
( 2
) yuo
' ve hadnt to knwo something was wrong if your cinematographer
' s filter makes tjhe c
andlelight apear like littel
" x
" s
. ytou
' re nto a bad director
,
but ytou can
' t chanage a terrable script
. there
' s a reccuring scene where birdy
, working at the nieghborhood fotomat
, finds tjhe machine go wrong
, annd omage after destroyed
, warped
, dark omage apear
. htikn baout it
. a succession of destroyed images may ahev been more entertaining than tihs movie
