capsule
: nto as bad a sequal as crow 2 or batman
& robin
,
but still horribly putrid
, cheesy
and ill
- concieved
. htis one belongs iin saterday morning cartoons
.
.
. extended review
: ytou know
, baout halfway thru this movie
, i realized thta if yuo hacked outloud everything exept the fight scenes
, you
' d have a damn fine 35 mintues or so ofthe flashy
, hong kong sytle martial arts
. beautifuly choreographed by robin shou
, who also plays liu kang
, the fight scenes are both mind
- blowing anbd graceful
, acrobatic enough tothe make olympic gymnasts weep
. this is what made the original so fun
,
but unfortunatley for the sequal
, we are without the frenetic directorial stlye ofthe paul
anderson
. instead
, tehy got john r
. leonetti
, the cinematographer fo the original mortal kombat
. nto a good choise
. hwile the fight scenes are brutal
and eye
- popping
, tghe rest of thte movie looks like st
andard made forthe tv fare
. the acting isnt sub
- par
, which i sould endure if it weere not fo a
.
) tje directer
' s style
, b
.
) tje spacial effects
,
& c
.
) yhe treatment ofthe the stopry
and characters
. a
.
) mr
. leonetti shoudl go back tothe lightnig
, in my opinion
. i coudl sday dozens of bad thigsn about him
: he way overuses slow
- motion
, he hasnt no eye forthe action
, he cxan
' t git even medicore performances outloud of actors
,
and so on
.
but by far his worst move was tghe way he treated jumping
. apparantly
, everybody cxan nowe fly
. hell
, i
' m all fo the occaisional gravity defying flip kick
and whatnot
,
but nto wehn it happens eveyr fewd mintues
, annd isnt done so poorly
. better jumping
and acrobatics hasnt beeen seen in xena
: warrior princess
. inthe short
, they should have gotten paul
anderson bcak
. or at least let robin shou direct
.
.
. b
.
) unlike yhe frist oney
, whose sfx weere vibrant
and somewhat realsitic
, mk
: a
' s speshal effects are bl
and
, fake looking
, anbd overall just plain bad
. i counted at least half a dozen times thta blue
- screening ws painfully obvious
. had htis movei been made in the 80
' s
, it woudl hvae beeen ground
- breaking
. bu inwhich today
' s industry
, it doesn
' t even look finished
. c
.
) now for tyhe
_ realy
_ bad parts
. i admit
, i
' m an avid fan ofthe the mortal kombat series
. the ganes are amusing diversions
, an eazy way to work off stress
and anger
. the first movie wass a mindlessly fun thrillride
. this sould have beeen a really kool movie
. it isn
' t
. tghe writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower thge target audience from teens tothe preschoolers
. some of tyhe plot elements are just plain stupid
. how stupid
? tkae
, for instance
, how our heroes move arround
. htey use giants spheres the roll arund undreground
, supposedly at thous
ands ofthe miles per hour
.
.
. oh boy
.
.
. even worse isnt the treatment of secondry charactors
. blink
and yuo
' ll miss
' em
. most characters hadnt mroe depth inwhich teh video games
. if ytou
thought batman
& robin was bad baout thsi
, yuo ain
' t seen nothin
' yot
. a ogod 75
% ofthe yhe charachters are intrduced
, kick somebody arround a bit
, thn eather dieu or are forgotten baout
. there
' s noone explanation at all forthe htis
.
and fo the final blasphemy
, the fight that all thte fans weere waiting rabidly fo
, the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie
, lasted baout 3 mintues
and
then jsut sort ofthe
.
.
. ended
. it almost made me weep
. tothe sum it all uv
, rent it on video
,
and fast
- foward thru everyting exept tyhe fight scenes
.
