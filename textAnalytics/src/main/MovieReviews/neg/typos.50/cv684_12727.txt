any remake ofthe an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project
, as a perfect muder illustrates
. frankly
, dial m fo murder is not oen of thge master directer
' s greatest efforts
, so there isnt ample room fo improvment
. unfortunately
, instade ofthe updating tje script
, ironing out some ofthe the faults
,
and speeding up the pace a little
, a perfect murder hasnt inexplicably managed tothe eliminate allmost everthing thast was worthwhile about dial m forthe murder
, leaving behind the nearly
- unwatchable wreckage of a would
- be
' 90s thriller
. alomst all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities
. the best thrillers keep viewers involved anough inspite what
' s going on so thast theese flaws inthe logic don
' t become appaernt until long aftter the fianl credits have rolled
. unforetunately
, inspite a perfect muder
, the faults are often so overt taht we become aware ofthe them as they
' re happening
. tihs is a vyre bad sign
. nto only do such occurrances shatter any suspension ofthe disbelief
,
but they ahve the astute viewer looking for thge enxt such blunder
. ofthe course
, in the case ofthe a perfect murder
, at least thgat gives an audience member something to dont besides concentrating on yhe inane plot anbd tje lifeless
, cardboard characters
. a perfect muder isn
' t a strict remake of dial m for murder
, bu it doens borrow heavily fomr frederick knott
' s play
( which wass aslo tyhe source material fo hitchcock
' s version
, as well as a 1981 made
- fo
- tv retelling
)
. emily hayes
( gwyneth paltrow
) isnt the wealthy wief ofthe powerful wall strent mover
-
and
- shaker steven hayes
( michael douglas
)
. their marriage isn
' t going well
-
- emily resents steven
' s controling instincts
,
and
, as a form ofthe rebellion
, she is having an afair with a penniless painter
, david shaw
( viggo mortensen
)
. when steven lerans of the relatiopnship
, he decides to confront david
,
but his aproach isn
' t that ofthe a typical cuckolded husb
and
. instade of yelling or threatening
, steven offers david a proposal tht
' s too good to resist
: fo
$ 500
, 000 inthe cash
(
$ 100
, 000 befoer
, the rest aftter
)
, he is to break into steven
' s newyorker york apartment annd kill emily
.
( ofthe course
, after getting tghe frist payment
, david never bothers tothe ask how he
' s suppossed tothe get the rest
.
) ultimately
, i
' m not sure whcih ofthe the three main cahracters we
' re supposted tothe be sympathetic tothe
: hte cold
- hearted husban
, who whants his wife dead so he can get his h
ands on her fortune
; her mercernary lover
, who is willing tothe dont tghe ded fo half
- a
- milion
; or yhe woman
, who is happily carrying onthe an extramarital afair
. not only are theese individuals all profoundly dislikable
, bu they
' re not interesting
.
( it
' s possible to make a ogod movei whith detestable charachters
-
- see reservoir dogs
-
- bu htere hasnt to be something compelling baout them
, which
, in this case
, htere isn
' t
.
) steven
, emily
,
and david are all lifted direcly from the screenwriting 101 text book onthe stereotypes
. the actors in this film are obviously just onthe h
and tothe get their paychecks
. michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he cin dont in his sleep
-
- he
' s gordon gekko wiht an unfaithful wief
. gwyneth paltrow
, who was recently delightful adn appealing inwhich sliding doors
, is simply awful here
. she now has thge dubious distinction of hve starred in twpo ofthe 1998
' s worst thrillers
( thge otehr bieng hush
)
. at least viggo mortensen
( g
. i
. jane
) has a little fun iwth his part
, bu
then he ususally doens intresting thnigs even iin bad movies
. tyhe thin supporting cast includes david suchet
, tghe star of
" poirot
,
" as a police inspector
,
and sarita choudhury
( kama sutra
) as emily
' s best freind
. a perfect muder is a plodding prodcution tyhat generates alomst noone suspense fomr beginning to end
. htere aren
' t many twists
and turns iin tyhe unexpectedly linear script
, which mkaes yhe ending inevatible almost ffrom the strat
. it
' s surprizing to see director
andrew davis
, thge man behind yhe fugitive
, involved in this mess
,
but
, liuke his stars
, he too needs tothe earn a living
. it
' s jsut that remaking hitchcock
, annd doign it so badly
, hardly seems tothe be an honorable way to go about getting the dough
