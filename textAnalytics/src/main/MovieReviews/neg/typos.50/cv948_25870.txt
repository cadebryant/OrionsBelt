anbd just when you
thought joblo ws getting a little soft aroud tjhe corners
, not rating anything lower than your st
andard
" thsi movei sucks
"
, along comes this cinematic atrocity
and he
' s forced to take outloud his secet weapon adn spray it withthe a stench so thick
, even the bravest movei
- goer would think twice about seing this waste of time
. yes
, despite bieng a thrid sequel tothe a successful original movei
, the latest highl
ander doesn
' t seem tothe haev anything goign for it
. oh stinky movei
, let me count thee ways
.
.
. plot
:
( fomr wqat i understood
) a really bad highl
ander dued comes to thte present looking to whack out thte nice highl
ander dudes infact order tothe gain theri power
and become yhe mightiest immortal
.
.
. or something allong those lines
. critique
: a complete
and utter mess
. disjointed
, incoherent
, boring
, corny
, filled witht bad dialogue
.
.
. anbd thyat
' s jsut tje frist thirty minutes
! tihs film doesn
' t seem to konw whta to do with itself
. it
' s confusing to anyone who doesn
' t nkow the sories
( i inlcude myself in that group
) adn apparently idiotic to thsoe who dont know the series
( i include die
- hard highl
ander fan the arro in thyat gropu
)
. the film doesn
' t explain anytying about itself
.
.
. it jstu goes from one inexplicable situation to anohter
. oney moent they
' re in the present tyme
, yhe next moment
, tehy
' re inwhich italy inthe teh 1600s
. why
? who knows
. what are they talking about
? noone idae
. flashbacks mixted in iwth the present
, mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences eveyr nowe adn again
, adn i even remember seing noe flashback scene whihc went even furuther inot its pwn flashback scene
!
! hullo
.
.
.
?
!
? confused
yet
? i ws
and i basicly stoped giving a crap baout anyone in thte film when i realized that neither yhe writter or director was interseted iin presenting me with any kind of semblance ofthe a stoyr
. r
andom swordplay
, mad max
- like dudes showing up in motorcycles in teh 1800s
? or weere they in the present at thyat tiem
? who knows
.
.
. anbd tothe be honest
.
.
. who seriously cares
! htis serieses should have been shot in the head anbd put out ofthe its own misery a long time ago
, bu sadly
, somone at tyhe studio desided that it still had a littel life left infact it
. please
, please
.
.
. fo the loev of god anbd all that is wholy in teh world ofthe movie
- makeing
, annd mostly out ofthe respect for those who loved yhe originnal film
, put thsi sories to bed adn end it
! even christopher lambert knew anough tothe play second fiddle tothe adrian paul iin thsi oen
. the director also trys to dont tyhe best he cant with the muddled material
, bu all he could come up with is plenty of slo
- mo action
, smoe fast
- motion fight scenes
and lots of smoke everywhere
.
and isnt there anything spectauclar baout hte sword
- play or fight scenes
? nope
.
and i think we all coudl have done wihtout all thsoe zooming lambert face close
- ups
.
.
. yipes
, the man is nto aging gracefully
, is he
? oh boy
, anbd i haven
' t even gotten around to tjhe greatest piece of over
- acting that i
' ve seen inthe years
. the man who plays kell in thsi movie
, bruce payne
, shouldnt git a ham trophy fo litterally chewing uv eveyr peice ofthe scenery taht he gets near
. overacting is nto a hobby fo htis guy
.
.
. it
' s a living
! he
' s aslo veyr funny
, not purposely
though
. all inwhich all
, the movie stinks
. nuff said
.
