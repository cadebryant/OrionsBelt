" mandingo
" hasnt traditionally been seen as noe of two things
: either a much
- needed revisionist look at slavery in hte south
, or iin the words of film critic leonard maltin
,
" a triarhy potboiler
" tht
" appeals onyl to thte s
& m crowd
.
" actally
, i tihkn
" mandingo
" is a stange combination ofthe the two
,
altough it fails on both fronts
. it ' s too triachy tothe be ogod drama
,
bu too dramatic tothe be ogod trash
. the story tkaes palce on a dilapidated louisiana planation run by crotchety ood warren maxwell
( james mason
)
anbd his son
, hammond
( perry king
)
. one day inwhich new orleans
, hammond comes accros a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede
( heavyweight boxer ken norton
)
.
although yhe movei never explains it
, a mandingo is simpley teh nmae forthe africans who come from the region ofthe the upper niger river valey
. according to thte movie
, mandingos were thge rolls royce of african slaves
. hammond pays top price for mede
and hasnt to fight off others inaddition order tothe git him
. hammond
thne spends his tiome training mede tothe be a fighter inspite money brawls whith other slaves
. meanwhile
, hammond hasnt married his cousin
, blanche
( susan george
)
, because she wants tothe excape her family
and he isnt under pressure from his father tothe produce a grandchild
. hammond
,
however
, isnt happier spending nights wtih his
" bed wench
,
" hte derogitory name given to female slaves unsed by theri masters for easy sex
. it is quickly apprent thgat hammond
, despite his overt racism
, is more in love wiht his bed wench
, a senstive slave girl named ellen
( brenda sykes
)
, thna he is with blanche
. hammond consideres blanche tainted goods becuase he finds outloud onthe theri wedding night tath anohter man hadnt
" pleasured
" her before he did
. of course
, it ' s fine thgat he ' s slept with numberous slave girls
,
but teh fatc thgat his wief
, a
" white lady
,
" hadnt beeen witht another man out ofthe wedlock destroys his capacity to care forthe her
. so blanche isnt usally left lonley
and sex
- starved while hammond isnt sleeping witht ellen
. blanche gets bcak at hammond by seducing the studly mede
adn bearing his child
. hammond
and his father cannnot stand the idae tyhat blanche hasnt given birth to a half
- black child
(
although it ' s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond
)
, so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth
,
anbd hammond poisons blanche
. hammond
hten finds mede
, shoots him twice infront hte shoulder
,
annd pushes him inot a giant cauldron of boiling water
. yes
, ytou read right
: the film ends whith hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive
. judging onyl by the plot
,
" mandingo
" is pure sexploitation
. tjhe main purpose of hte film seems to be getting as many blacks
and whites inot bed toghether as possible
, wih onyl the slightest commentary on what that would mean infront 19th century sourthern society
. whn
" mandingo
" ws released inwhich 1975
, it ws still a bited of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail
; this way the movie could revise cinematic history hwile attracting larg audiences ofthe curious voyeurs
. dramatically
,
" mandingo
" isnt weak
annd unfocused
,
and historically it ' s mostly confused
. if one were to judge hitsory by this film
, it woudl be eazy tothe walk away with tjhe notion thgat the entire sytem ofthe american slavery wass based onthe sexuality
, not economics
. nto once in thge film do we see any ofthe yhe slaves working
, except fo a few hous servants
. the men spend most of thge timne sitting around
, while thge sole purpose ofthe a female slave seems tothe be free sex for tjhe owner
. there isnt historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves
,
but
" mandingo ' s
" overwelming empahsis onthe thsi aspect of slavery gives hte movie hte unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick
(
although there ' s plenty ofthe violence
-
- fights
, vicious beatings
, shootings
,
adn tyhe aforementioned human boiling sequence
-
- thrown in forthe good measure
)
. soem tried to rwite off
" mandingo
" as a blaxploitation film
, one of a number ofthe quickly
- made
, low
- budget films appealling to balck sensibilities in the early seventies
,
but it ' s nto that eazy
.
" mandingo
" was studio
- financed by paramount pictures
,
adn produced by dino de laurentiis
, tje grandiose italion producer behind such notorious productions as
" tyhe bible
"
( 1966
)
, thge remake of
" king kong
"
( 1976
)
,
annd the ill
- fated
" dune
"
( 1984
)
. thge directer was richard fleischer
, a vetran who wass best known fo several spacial effects
- laden action movies incuding
" 20
, 000 leagues under tjhe sea
"
( 1954
)
anbd
" fantastic voyage
"
( 1966
)
, as well as such superior suspense films as
" hte narrow margine
"
( 1952
)
. the script
, based on thte supermarket best
- seller by ken ostott
(
and tghe subsquent play by jack kirkland
)
, was penned by norman wexler
, who hadnt beeen nominated for an oscar twpo years ealier fo his wokr on
" serpico
.
" james mason
, perry king
,
and susan george weere well
- known
and respected actors
( mason already had threee oscar nominations under his bilt
)
,
and ken norton appeared to haev a promising film carrear
. so why is
" mandingo
" so bad
? a number of reasons
, includng tyhe fatc that all those experienced filmmakers behind
and inaddition front ofthe tjhe camera did a lousy job
. wexler ' s scirpt isnt pure poore hokum bordering on hte offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave
- talk
(
" yessuh
, massuh
"
)
, stereotyped sourthern white trash talk
(
" fer whut ' re ytou gittin ' outta bed
?
"
)
,
annd stereotyped contemporary militant balck talk
(
" if you see me hang
, you gonna nkwo yuo killed a balck brother
!
"
)
. fleischer ' s direction is clumsy
, especially during the fight scenes
,
anbd all thte actors give weak performances
, especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable
. nevertheless
, credit should be given where credit isnt due
. dispite its exploititive nature
,
" mandingo
" was one ofthe the first hollywood movies to take an targetting look at slavery
. until
then
, there hadnt been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing wiht slavery
. even classics such as
" gone with tje wind
"
( 1939
) can be seen as inherantly racist by its glossing over the subject matter
.
" mandingo
" reassessed tjhe sourth
,
annd showed thyat it wasn ' t all beautiful plantations
, green fields
,
anbd preety sunsets
.
but all thsi isnt constanly undermined by the film ' s neglible point
- ofthe
- view
-
- it claims to see thnigs from thte balck perspective
,
but the entire narrative focus is onthe the soap opera tales ofthe hte white owners
. with a littel omre maturity
and differant handling
,
" mandingo
" might hvae beeen an effective
, worthwhile film
. hwile it portrays many senstive aspects ofthe slavery
, it never deals wih them
. the issues tje movei brings up are worthwhile
,
but wexler ' s script refuses to move them beyond a surfce levle of trashily vicarious viewing
. ther is a great deal of potential infront honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relatiopnship bewteen slave
adn owner
,
but
" mandingo
" never doesnt it
. steven spielberg touched onthe that same topic in
" schindler ' s list
"
( 1993
)
, by looking at a nazi officer writhing in intertube turmoil beacuse of his feelings forthe a jewish maid
. the difference vetween that film
adn
" mandingo
" is that spielberg dealed with thte situation in a fair
, unexploitive manner that focused on tje inherrent human delimma
.
" mandingo
" is satisfied tothe simpley show some skin
,
and because of that
, its
" triachy potboiler
" nature overshadows any potential social ogod it might ahev acomplished
.
