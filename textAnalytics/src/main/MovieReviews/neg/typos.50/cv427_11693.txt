" m
andingo
" hasnt traditionaly been seen as oen ofthe two things
: eather a much
- needed revisionist look at slavery in the south
, or inspite the words of film critic leonard maltin
,
" a trashy potboiler
" tath
" appeals onyl to tyhe s
& m crowd
.
" actulaly
, i htikn
" m
andingo
" isnt a stange combination ofthe tjhe twpo
, altho it fails on both fronts
. it
' s too triarhy to be good drama
, bu too dramtic to be good trash
. the sotry takes palce on a delapidated louisiana planation run by crotchety old warren maxwell
( james mason
) annd his son
, hammond
( perry king
)
. oney day in new orleans
, hammond comes accross a slave trader selling a m
andingo named mede
( heavyweight boxer ken norton
)
. all
though yhe movei never explains it
, a m
andingo isnt simply the name fo africans who come from the region ofthe the upper niger river valey
. according to the movie
, m
andingos weere the rolls royce of african slaves
. hammond pays top price for mede annd hasnt tothe fight off others in order tothe git him
. hammond thn spends his tiome training mede to be a fighter in mony brawls with otehr slaves
. meanwhile
, hammond has marryied his cousin
, blanche
( susan george
)
, becuase she wants tothe excape her family
and he isnt under presure ffrom his father tothe produce a gr
andchild
. hammond
, howver
, is happier spending nights withthe his
" bed wench
,
" tje derogitory nmae given to female slaves used by theri masters forthe eazy sex
. it is quickly apparetn that hammond
, dispite his overt racism
, is moreso infront love with his bed wench
, a sensitive slave girl named ellen
( brenda sykes
)
, than he is with blanche
. hammond considers blanche tainted goods becuase he finds outloud onthe theri wedding nigth thyat another man had
" pleasured
" her befoer he did
. of course
, it
' s fine that he
' s slept with numerous slave girls
, bu tyhe fatc taht his wief
, a
" white lady
,
" hadnt been with another man outloud of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her
. so blanche is usually left lonely adn sex
- starved while hammond isnt sleeping with ellen
. blanche gets bcak at hammond by seducing the studly mede
and bearing his child
. hammond
and his father cannnot st
and tje idea that blanche hasnt given birth to a half
- black child
(
al
though it
' s okay thta ellen wass pregnant by hammond
)
, so warren kills teh child by letting it bleed tothe death after birth
, annd hammond poisons blanche
. hammond
then finds mede
, shoots him twice inwhich the shoulder
, annd pushes him inot a giant cauldron ofthe boiling water
. yes
, you read right
: the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive
. judging onyl by hte plot
,
" m
andingo
" isnt pure sexploitation
. hte main purpose of tyhe film seems tothe be getting as many blacks
and whites into bed toghether as possible
, with onyl the slightest commentary onthe wqat thgat owudl mean in 19th century southern society
. wehn
" m
andingo
" wass released in 1975
, it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen inaddition such a graphic detail
; this way tyhe movei coudl revise cinematic istory while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs
. dramatically
,
" m
andingo
" is weak
and unfocused
,
and historically it
' s mostly confuzled
. if oen were tothe judge history by tihs film
, it would be eazy to walk awya with the notion thgat hte entire sytem ofthe american slavery wass based on sexuality
, not economics
. not once in the film dont we see any ofthe yhe slaves working
, exept for a few house servants
. tjhe men spend most ofthe hte time sitting around
, while tje sole purpose ofthe a female slave seems tothe be free sex fo the owner
. htere isnt historical basis in tjhe notion taht slave owners often slept with their female slaves
, bu
" m
andingo
' s
" overwhelming emphasis on tihs aspect ofthe slavery gives the movie tyhe unplesant taste ofthe a cheap sex flick
(
al
though ther
' s plenty ofthe violence
-
- fights
, vicious beatings
, shootings
, anbd the aforememtioned human boiling sequence
-
- thrown in for good measure
)
. soem tryed to write off
" m
andingo
" as a blaxploitation film
, noe ofthe a number of quickly
- made
, low
- budget films appealing tothe black sensibilities infact tje eearly seventies
,
but it
' s not tath easy
.
" m
andingo
" was studio
- financed by paramount pictures
, adn produced by dino de laurentiis
, the gr
andiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as
" the bible
"
( 1966
)
, the remake of
" king kong
"
( 1976
)
, anbd the ill
- fated
" dune
"
( 1984
)
. tje directer wass richard fleischer
, a veteren who was best known for several speical effects
- laden acation movies inlcuding
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
( 1954
) annd
" fantastic voyage
"
( 1966
)
, as well as such superior suspense films as
" tje narrow margine
"
( 1952
)
. teh script
, based on the supermarket best
- seller by ken ostott
(
and tjhe subsquent play by jack kirkl
and
)
, was penned by norman wexler
, who hadnt beeen nominated for an oscar twpo years earlier fo his work onthe
" serpico
.
" james mason
, perry king
,
and susan george were well
- known
and respected actors
( mason allready had three oscar nominations under his belt
)
,
and ken norton appeared tothe hvae a promising film carrer
. so why isnt
" m
andingo
" so bad
? a number of reasons
, including thge fact thgat all thsoe experianced filmmakers behind
and in front ofthe thge camera doed a lousy job
. wexler
' s script is pure poore hokum bordering on the offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave
- talk
(
" yessuh
, massuh
"
)
, stereotyped southern white trash talk
(
" fer whut
' re you gittin
' outta bed
?
"
)
, annd stereotyped contemporary militant balck talk
(
" if ytou see me hang
, you gonna know yuo killed a balck brother
!
"
)
. fleischer
' s direction is clumsy
, especially durig tyhe fight scenes
, anbd all hte actors give weak performances
, especially susan george whose constatn shrieking finally becomes laughable
. nevertheless
, credit should be given where credit is due
. despite its exploitative nature
,
" m
andingo
" was noe ofthe the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery
. unitl hten
, there had beeen a kind ofthe underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery
. even classics such as
" gone with the wind
"
( 1939
) cin be seen as inherantly racist by its glossing over the subject marter
.
" m
andingo
" reassessed hte sourth
,
and showed thyat it wasn
' t all beautyfull plantations
, gren fields
, annd pretty sunsets
.
but all this is constanly undermined by the film
' s neglible point
- ofthe
- view
-
- it claimes to see thigsn from the black prespective
,
but the entire narrative focuse is on yhe soap opera tales of thte white owners
. with a little moreso maturity
and diffrent h
andling
,
" m
andingo
" might have been an effective
, worthwhile film
. while it portrays many senstive spects ofthe slavery
, it never deals whith them
. yhe issues tje movei brings up are worthwhile
,
but wexler
' s script refuses to move them beyond a surfce level of trashily vicarious viewing
. htere is a great deel of potential inthe honestly exploring the nature ofthe a sexual relationship betweeen slave
and owner
,
but
" m
andingo
" never doens it
. steven spielberg touched onthe tyhat smae topic inwhich
" schindler
' s list
"
( 1993
)
, by looking at a nazi officer writhing iin inner turmoil because ofthe his feelings forthe a jewish maid
. thge diference between tht film anbd
" m
andingo
" isnt that spielberg dealt with the situation inspite a fair
, unexploitive manner tyhat focused on tyhe inherrent human dilemma
.
" m
andingo
" isnt satisfied to simpley show smoe skin
, annd beccause of tyhat
, its
" trashy potboiler
" nature overshadows any potential social good it might hve accomplished
.
