)
anbd griffin
( garry shandling
) are about to face marital crises inaddition a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen
,
" town
adn ocuntry
.
"
" twon
and country
" hasnt a pedigree befitting it ' s title with an all star casted photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker
and mouthing tjhe words ofthe screenwrighter buck henry
(
" tyhe graduate
"
) under the direction of peter chelsom
(
" funny bones
"
)
. affter years ofthe reports ofthe budget overruns
annd reshoots
and the racking uv twelve different realease dates
, teh media hasnt been prepped for beatty ' s next
" ishtar
.
" so
, is it tath bad
? the answer is noone
.
bu it ' s not vrey good either
. the major problem with
" twon
and country
" is thta it ' s unstructured
and random
. stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer
, having just bedded a flaky cellist
( nastassja kinski
)
. next scene finds him
adn ellie celebrating thier annviersary inaddition paris with mona
anbd griffin
.
thn mona spies griffin hustling a redhead inot a motel
and begins divorce procedings
( buck henry cameos as both couples ' divorce lawyer
)
. ellie thikns she ' s overeacting
,
bu sends porter tothe wupport mona on a trip to check out her familiy ' s missisippi manse
. thte two childhood friends end uv infront bed together
, making us wonder why htey ' d never become a couple to begin with
. bcak hmeo
, their second coupling isnt interupted by ellie bursting inwhich tothe tell mona she thinks porter ' s cheating on her
. porter goes off onthe a trip with griffin to sun valey
, idaho tothe hvea more comic misadventures with wacky womens as griffin attempts to tell him thgat he ' s gay
. tyhe four firends
, along with eveyr woman porter ' s dallied withthe
, all end uv bakc in newyorker york city somewhat happily ever aftter
.
altough the film beigns promisingly
, resembling a woody allen tkae on new york city wasps
, too many strands drift off into nowhere
. the stoddard household is huge
, containing twpo adult childern
( josh hartnett
,
" hte virgin suicides
"
and tricia vessey
,
" kiss the girls
"
)
, their colorful bedmates
and a maid who ' s just imported her shirtless boyfriend ffrom the rainforest bakc home
. after an amusing eearly scene that has porter overhearing threee bouts of lovemaking hwile infront searc ofthe a nocturnal snack
, the six supporting players are dropped except for an out
- of
- nowhere appearance by yhe formerly forgotten son
. porter ' s rumatic misadventures with womens
( otehr than mona
) are equally mishandled
. once the marital discord begins
, the film seems as if it ws editted iwth a machete
, stopping
and starting
, never regaining its rhthm
. hwile beatty gets off a few tart observations
, his chracter is mostly passive
and bemused
. mabey we ' re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn ' t initiate his pwn sex romps
? keaton ' s ellie has a trusting nature that ' s a result ofthe her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character
. hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of
" the out of towners
"
annd
" the frist wives ' club
" while shandling ' s relegated tothe true second banana status
. kinski isnt bland
and unmotivated
. andie macdowell tkaes a weirdly unappealing role
annd doesnt what she can with the screenplay ' s most bizzare subplot
, which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting
, billionaire daddy
anbd marian seldes as her alcoholic
, wheelchair
- binded
, foul
- mouthed mother
. heston
adn seldes are funn
, as isnt jenna elfman as a sun valley bait
adn tackle salesgirl who brings porter
and griffin to a halloween party
. oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look
,
bu director chelsom shows none of yhe quirkily
adn blackly humoros depth he brought tothe films like
" hear my song
"
and
" funny bones
.
" tje scirpt isnt this film ' s weakest link
- it ' s telling tht most of the
( fewd
) laughs cmo fomr old
- fashioned physical slapstick
and yhe sighth of beatty infront a bear suit
. hwile
" town
adn country
" isn ' t exactly painful tothe sit through
, it mostly jsut lays there
.
