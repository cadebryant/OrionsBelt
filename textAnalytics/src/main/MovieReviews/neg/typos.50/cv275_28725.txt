,
" town
and ocuntry
.
"
" town
and ocuntry
" has a pedigree befitting it
' s title wiht an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker
and mouthing the words ofthe screenwriter buck henry
(
" thte graduate
"
) under the direction ofthe peter chelsom
(
" funny bones
"
)
. aftter years of reports ofthe budget overruns adn reshoots adn yhe racking up twelve differant realease dates
, the media hasnt beeen prepped for beatty
' s next
" ishtar
.
" so
, isnt it tath bad
? tjhe answer is noone
. bu it
' s nto very good either
. tjhe major probelm with
" twon
and ocuntry
" is that it
' s unstructured
and r
andom
. stoddard isnt immediately estalbished as a phil
anderer
, having just bedded a flaky cellist
( nastassja kinski
)
. next scene finds him annd ellie celebrating thier anniversary in paris witht mona anbd griffin
. thn mona spies griffin hustling a redhead inot a motel
and begins divorce procedings
( buck henry cameos as both couples
' divorce lawyer
)
. ellie thinks she
' s overeacting
,
but sends porter tothe support mona onthe a trip to check out her family
' s missisipi manse
. the two childhood firends end uv iin bed toghether
, makeing us wonder why htey
' d never become a couple tothe begin whith
. back hmeo
, theri second coupling isnt interupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thikns porter
' s cheating onthe her
. porter goes off onthe a trip whith griffin tothe sun vallay
, idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky womens as griffin attemts tothe tell him that he
' s gay
. tjhe four friends
, along iwth every woman porter
' s dallied whith
, all end up bcak in new york city somewhat happily ever affter
.
al
though the film beigns promisingly
, ressembling a woody allen take onthe new york city wasps
, too many str
ands drift off inot nowhere
. thte stoddard household is huge
, containing two adult children
( josh hartnett
,
" tyhe virgin suicides
" anbd tricia vessey
,
" kiss the girls
"
)
, their colorful bedmates adn a maid who
' s just imported her shirtless boyfriend fomr hte rainforest bakc home
. after an amusing early scene taht has porter overhearing threee bouts ofthe lovemaking hwile infact search ofthe a nocturnal snack
, the six supporting players are dropped except for an out
- of
- nowhere appearance by teh formerly forgotten son
. porter
' s romantic misadventures with womens
( other thna mona
) are equally mish
andled
. once tyhe marital discord beggins
, the film seems as if it was editted with a machete
, stoping
and starting
, never regaining its rhythim
. hwile beatty gets off a few tart observations
, his character isnt mostly passive annd bemused
. mabey we
' re suposed to feel simapthy for an adulterer who doesn
' t iniciate his own sex romps
? keaton
' s ellie has a trusting nature that
' s a result ofthe her pwn self involvement resulting in an unlikeable charachter
. hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of
" tje outloud of towners
"
and
" the first wives
' club
" hwile sh
andling
' s relegated tothe true second banana status
. kinski isnt bl
and
and unmotivated
.
andie macdowell tkaes a weirdly unappealing role
and doesnt what she can wih the screenplay
' s most bizarre subplot
, whitch finds charlton heston as her rifle toting
, billionaire daddy
and marian seldes as her alcoholic
, wheelchair
- bound
, foul
- mouthed mother
. heston
and seldes are fun
, as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait
and tackle salesgirl who brings porter annd griffin tothe a halloween party
. oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives yhe film a nice look
, bu director chelsom shows none ofthe yhe quirkily annd blackly humoruos depth he broght to films liuke
" hear my song
"
and
" funny bones
.
" hte script isnt tihs film
' s weakest link
- it
' s telling that most of tjhe
( fewd
) laughs come fomr ood
- fashioned fysical slapstick
and the sighth of beatty in a bear suit
. hwile
" town
and country
" isn
' t exactlly painful tothe sit through
, it mostly just lays ther
.
