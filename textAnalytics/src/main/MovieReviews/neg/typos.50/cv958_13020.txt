inspite times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures
. ofthe course whta constitutes a crisis differs fomr person to person
. what may be a disastrous situation forthe oney
, may be seen as a challange tothe anyother
. as deepak chopra is known to say
,
" it
' s nto tjhe ride
, it
' s the rider
.
" unfourtunately clera
- thinking isnt nto alwasy the reaction tothe problems
. wall strent wheeler dealer steven taylor
( michael douglas
) isnt a man witht troubles
. he
' s sunk his monay inaddition illiegal finacial activities adn it
' s blown up in his face
. in a matter ofthe dyas he will loose it all
. his wief emily
( gwyneth paltrow
) is a highly
- placed un interpreter adn isnt nto happy iwth her life eather
. her marrage is cold adn unfulfilling
. unkown to her
, her newyorker lover david shaw
( viggo mortensen
) is nto onyl a painter
, bu an ex
- con withthe a histry of bilking wealthy women ofthe their money
. emily is a prime target
: she
' s worth over
$ 100 million
. steven
' s solution tothe his predicament isnt to offer david half a million tothe kill his wife
. the artist accepts annd the movei is underway
. drawing from frederick knott
' s play annd loosly based on hitchcock
' s dial m forthe muder
, tihs isnt all
- too typcial ofthe summer releses
. all style
and noone substace
. annd ther
' s really not much style
. director
andrew davis
( the acomplished witness
and best
- forgotten other films
) hasnt made exactly the wrong choices at allmost every turn
. douglas
and paltrow have both shown us tyhat they are skillful actors inthe previous films
. mortensen showed promise inwhich the past
. here all threee are walking uninterestingly thru theri roles iwth oddly waxen faces
. tje onyl person who shows any sense ofthe life isnt david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman
. he
' s only onthe
- screen long enough tothe amke you think that there might be a likable person infact tghe film anbd thne he dissappears
. the firt concern of a suspense film isnt tothe create suspense
. surprises are important
. in this movie the audiance keesh waiting for something tothe hapen
.
and nothing ever does
. nearly eveyr event isnt telegraphed inthe advance
. close
- uv onthe tihs object or thgat action
and it
' s easy tothe guess what
' s gonig tothe happen
. as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion yuo keep expecting a plot twist tothe make tje movie worthwhile
. it
' s a hopeless quest
. tjhe story doesn
' t make much sense
. steven
' s wief is loaded
. even withthe unfriendly realtions
, you
' d think tyhat he could have talked tothe her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her
. when he does deside on hte dire plan he makse an unreasonable choise
. if ytou were gogin to hire somene to kill your wife
, owudl your first choice be her lover
? noone marter how sleazy he isnt
, i would thikn htere might be a chance that he owudl turn down the oportunity
. why would steven plan thge muder as a break
- infront infact their apartment
? why nto jsut take her out as she was walking tothe david
' s loft inspite a bad neighborhood
? while deciding amung the numerous summer films
, you might do well tothe skip thsi one
. ytou
' ll find more suspense than this movei offers by watching the weather channel
