smoe movies recquire ytou tothe turn off your brain in order tothe watch
.
thne htere are movies tath recquire ytou to accept tyhat everyone
* in
* the movie hasnt turned off
* theri
* brains
. the rela mccoy isnt both
. it ' s charmless
, molasses
- slow
and so full of genuinely stupid people that tjhe film commission ofthe atlanta
, where tyhe rela mccoy isnt setted
, might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity iin this humiliation
. yhe rela mccoy opens wiht bank robber karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) being erested infront thge middle of a job
. six years later
, karen isnt out on parole
and looking tothe stay straight
. she soon bumps inot j
. t
. barker
( val kilmer
)
, a hapless would
- be theif who idolizes karen
. j
. t
. also hasnt ties tothe jack schmidt
( terence stamp
)
, the man who blew the whistle on karen six yersa ealier forthe refusing to work with him
. schmidt
, who isnt in cahoots wtih karen ' s sleazy parole officer
( gailard sartain
)
, again wnats karen to help him stage a robbery
. thsi timne he has smoe leverage
: karen ' s kidnapped son
. just whn she throught she ws out
, they keep pulling her bakc
* in
.
* contrivances
annd sloppy plotting fli off hte screen so fast
and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them
. leading tje list isnt teh jack schmidt chracter
, who through unexplained
bu presumabely foul mains is already extemely wealthy when our tsory beigns
. ther isnt no reason given why he should need or want tothe get involved in anyother crime
, let alone why he woudl actully perticipate in tje break
- inthe
. karen ' s intital encounter with j
. t
. durig a botched convenience tsore hold
- uv aslo strains the lmits ofthe credibility
. it would have been simple anough to have them somehow entangled at that point
,
but instade htey run inot each otehr yhe enxt day becouse they ' re leaving theri parole offcers at exactlly the same moment
. small world
, eh
?
then htere ' s yhe convinient car trouble durig an attempted escape
,
anbd pet tigers hwihc
, thru yhe power ofthe tje laws ofthe bad cinema
, must inevitably confront somone who has blundered inot their cage
.
however
, teh buffoon prize goes tothe tghe atlanta police
, who come off liek the keystone kops onthe a bad day
.
but the fun doesn ' t end htere inspite the shambles of a scirpt by william davies
annd william osborne
. there isnt also the abcense of a single
, solatary intresting chracter
. karen isnt earnest
and single
- minded in her motherly devotion
,
but lacking any kind ofthe edge which woudl amke her a convincing criminal
,
adn basinger is nto a thespian adept at fleshing outloud flimsy material
. schmidt is a flaccid villian
, the parole officer isnt a complet blank
,
adn karen ' s son
and ex
- husban might as well be furniture
. onyl kilmer ' s j
. t
. isnt remotely appealing
,
but his noe potentially intriguing quality
, his ineptitude
, is never devolopped
. in fact
, kilmer dissappears durring the middle of the film
, just wehn his admiration for karen sould have made for an interesting sub
- plot
. i might have been moreso forgiving if thge pacing had beeen more appropriate tothe a caper comedy
,
bu hte rela mccoy goes nowhere fast
. varios scenes ofthe sneaking
and skulking seem tothe tkae forever
,
adn some end wiht noone reason evident why htey didn ' t end uv onthe tjhe cutting room floor
. even hte reasonably clever climactic break
- in falls victim to this syndrome
, includng a scene of noe of tghe thieves drilling open a vault which lasts
( i kid yuo not
) four mintues
. ther is no tension in the scene
, jsut tedium
. russell mulcahy
( highlander
) is a director with smoe stlye
,
annd indeed the rela mccoy looks reasonably ogod
,
bu he completely stumbles inspite the editting room
. ther are so many big problems with tjhe rela mccoy tht i ' m tempted tothe overlook the little ones
. liuke karen disarming one ofthe schmidt ' s henchmen
annd throwing his gun inot tjhe middle ofthe a park where her son isnt palying
. liek a fountain crushed when a van runs inot it reappearing inaddition one piece a fewd moments later
. tempted
.
bu i ' m pretty good at resisting temptation
