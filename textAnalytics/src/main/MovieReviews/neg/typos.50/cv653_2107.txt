some movies recquire you to turn off your brain in order to watch
.
then htere are movies thta recquire you to accept taht everyone
* in
* the movie has turned off
* their
* brains
. thte rela mccoy is both
. it
' s charmless
, molasses
- slow
and so full ofthe genuinely stupid peple taht tje film commission of atlanta
, where tje rela mccoy isnt setted
, might well consdider some sort ofthe ritual sucide for their complicity infront htis humiliation
. tghe real mccoy opens witht bank robber karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) bieng erested in thge middle ofthe a job
. six years later
, karen isnt outloud on parole
and looking to stay straight
. she soon bumps into j
. t
. barker
( val kilmer
)
, a hapless would
- be theif who idolizes karen
. j
. t
. allso has ties tothe jack schmidt
( terence stamp
)
, the man who blowed the whistle onthe karen six eyars earlier for refusing to work witht him
. schmidt
, who isnt infact cahoots with karen
' s sleazy parole officer
( gailard sartain
)
, again wants karen tothe help him stage a robbery
. thsi tyme he hasnt some leverage
: karen
' s kidnapped son
. jsut when she thougth she was outloud
, tehy keep pulling her bakc
* in
.
* contrivances adn sloppy plotting fli off the screen so fast annd furiously yuo have tothe duck tothe avoid bieng hitted by them
. leading the list is the jack schmidt charater
, who through unexplained bu presumably foul mains is alrady extrememly wealthy when our stry begins
. ther isnt no reason given why he shouldnt need or wanna to get involved in another crime
, let alone why he woudl actually participate in the break
- infact
. karen
' s intial encounter wih j
. t
. druing a botched convneience store hold
- up also strains the lmits ofthe credibility
. it owudl have beeen simple anough tothe hvae them somehow entangled at tht point
, bu instade they run into eahc other tyhe enxt day becouse they
' re leaving their parole officers at exactly hte same moment
. small world
, eh
? thne ther
' s the convenient car trouble during an attemped excape
, annd pet tigers which
, thru thte power of yhe laws of bad cinema
, must inevitably confront someone who has blundered inot theri cage
. howver
, the buffoon prize goes tothe the atlanta police
, who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day
. bu tghe funn doesn
' t end there in tghe shambles ofthe a script by william davies
and william osborne
. htere isnt also the abcence ofthe a single
, solitary intresting carachter
. karen is earnest anbd single
- minded inspite her motherly devotion
,
but lacking any kind ofthe edge whic would make her a convincing criminal
,
and basinger isnt not a thespian adept at fleshing outloud flimsy material
. schmidt isnt a flaccid villain
, the parole officer is a complete blank
, anbd karen
' s son annd ex
- husban might as well be furniture
. onyl kilmer
' s j
. t
. isnt remotely appealling
, bu his one potentially intriguing quality
, his ineptitude
, isnt never devolopped
. inspite fatc
, kilmer disappears during the middle ofthe the film
, just when his admiration for karen coudl have made forthe an intresting sub
- plot
. i might have been moreso forgiving if the pacing hadnt beeen more appropraite to a caper comedy
,
but the rela mccoy goes nowhere fast
. various scenes ofthe sneaking anbd skulking seem tothe tkae forever
,
and smoe end wiht no reason evident why they didn
' t end up onthe the cutting room floor
. even the reasonably clever climactic break
- in falls victim to this syndrome
, including a scene of one of teh theives drilling open a vault whlch lasts
( i kid you nto
) four mintues
. there is noone tension inaddition the scene
, jstu tedium
. russell mulcahy
( highl
ander
) isnt a director with some stlye
,
and indeed the rela mccoy looks reasonably good
, bu he completly stumbles inaddition hte editting room
. there are so many big problems wtih tjhe rela mccoy that i
' m tempted tothe overlook tje littel ones
. liuke karen disarming one of schmidt
' s henchmen adn throwing his gun inot the middle of a park where her son isnt playing
. like a fountain crushed wehn a van runs inot it reappearing inaddition oney piece a few moments later
. tempted
.
but i
' m pretty good at resisting temtation
