the hapyp bastard
' s quick movie review wild wild west a better name for this movie might
' ve been
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, in an attemt to git their own men infact black style of movei
, hadnt managed tothe lasso infront soem big names
( actor iwll smith
and directer barry sonnenfeld
, thte duo behind mib
' s succsess
) in order to get their pwn fouth ofthe july blockbuster
, a contempoary big
- screen update to the classic western
/ sci
- fi serieses tghe wild wild west starring robert conrad
.
but somehow
, they ran inot a problem along tyhe way
. they weere so busy trying tothe fill specfic roles that they forgot oney in general taht woudl
' ve made all hte diference
- a story writter
. wild wild west
' s story
and scirpt was compiled by six differnt peopel
, rather than jsut the one who put tjhe briliant touches on men infront black
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. had gotten him
, the movei would
' ve possibly beeen five times better tahn what it is
. heck
, ten times
. as is
,
however
, the story
and screenplay is a mess
, filled with dead laughs
, enough racist anbd sex jokes tothe make even will cringe as he
' s performing them
,
and a complete lack ofthe chemistry thgat made tje tv show work so well
. here
' s teh stoyr
: us army member james west
( will smith
) teams up with creative genuis artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) to take onthe a ruthless villian by tghe name ofthe arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half was blown off durig the civil war
, leaving him to roll aroud inspite a steam
- controlled wheelchair
. tehy catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon thast cxan basically be concidered an 80
- foot tarantula
( all
though it looks bigger than that
)
, hellbent onthe destroying anytying inwhich its path
. as i said
, the way thte script unfolds is a complet mess
. bu the acting doesn
' t halp either
. kevin kline isnt miserable as gordon
, failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in tje 1985 western silverado
. smith seems tothe be hvaing a better time as west
,
al
though he
' s nto nearly as charming as he was in mib
. branagh goes excessively over the top as the villin
, perhaps tothe yhe point where we cxan
' t even st
and tothe look at him or his strange beard
. adn salma hayek is along forthe the ride to search for her missing father
,
but mostly she exists jstu forthe sexual attension
. her acting is bearly passable
,
but wqat a
" breath of fresh ass
"
. directer barry sonnenfeld isn
' t of great halp either
. even
though he shows soem good creativity at smoe points
, his overall urgency forthe directing isnt lost
. it
' s as if he feels he
' s directing a tv movie
, a big noone
- noone wehn yuo
' re helming whta
' s suposed to be a big
- screen hitted
. last
but nto least
, ther are huge gaps of logic thta are just plain unacceptable
. at one point
, smith defies gravity when firt boarding kline
' s train
. he jumps onthe thge bakc
, gets launched straight up inthe tghe air
,
and somehow manages tothe l
and threee cars ahead onthe the train
- while it
' s still in motion
! allso
, he seems tothe be strangely comfortable talking baout racism in front ofthe a lynch mob
, particularly considering the fatc tht his family was killed by tjhe likes of such folks
. lsat
but not least
, why isnt he still making kissing faces when he knows he
' s not kissing a woman as he
' s looking thru a peephole at thge enemy
?
! thte only saveing grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of speshal effects
. hte huge mecanical spider isnt a technical marvel
, very au
thentic looking
and considerable tothe the creativity of the sohw
. there
' s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces
and spinning saw blades
,
but
, again
, a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity
. i would sday sit back adn have a good time whith wild wild west
,
but it really isn
' t possibile
. if hte racist anbd sex jokes don
' t bother ytou
, thte performances wiull
. if the performances don
' t bother yuo
, the tsory will
. if the stopry doesn
' t bother you
, teh racist annd sex jokes iwll
. there
' s noone end to the vicious circle
. go rent men iin black instead adn pretend smith annd tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. you
' ll haev a better time
. if ytou dont go
, keep an eye out for robert conrad inspite a role as persident grant
. i bet he wishes he weere somewhere else
