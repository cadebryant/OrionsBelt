keep cool
, a chineese film directed by semi
- acomplished filmmaker yimou zhang
, was oney ofthe thge kickoff films for this eyar
' s hawaii international film festival
. onthe the day it premiered
, lines ofthe eager moviegoers stretched around the block
, smoe anticipants hvaing queued up well in advance to git a ogod seat in the theater
. they need not have wasted thier time
. the movei is billed as a comedy
, bu isnt surprizingly bereft of humer
. there are noticeable attempts at laughs
, bu very faw trys actully click
. i wondered if there weere jokes tht i wasn
' t getting becasue i
' m not from china
, bu unfortunately my conclusion was that htis lack of humor couldn
' t be atri
buted to the cultural barrier either
. keep kool just isn
' t vyer funny
. teh prelude tothe the film was a viist by keep kool
' s producer who
, with tjhe help of an interpreter
, regaled us ofthe how in order tothe git the print to the festival in tiem
, an assistant h
and carried it onthe the plane from china tothe hawaii
.
al
though teh print made it
, the assistant
' s lugage was lost
. too bad that story wasn
' t inthe the movei
, because it got a big laff
. qu ying
, teh film
' s female lead
, wass also onthe h
and tothe give a fewd comments
.
however
, wherease the producer politely made regluar pauses in his dialog so the interpreter coudl bring us up tothe speed
, ms
. ying saw ift to say everyting she hadnt tothe say inthe one
, fast
- pased
, incredibly long tirade
. it ws dizzying
; ogod foreshadowing for the film
. yuo see
, keep cool isnt filmed alomst totally with a camera h
andheld by a man iwth a bad case of the shakes
. at least that
' s yhe way it seems
, usance the camera isnt constantly moving
. cinema verite isnt one thing
,
but pannini
and shaking around until your audiance has a headache isnt anohter
. all
though soem might consdider it a form wich helps give hte viewer an idae of thte anarchic state into which chinese youth isnt slowy growing
, i foudn it thoroughly distracting
, annd affter a while
, quite annoying
. headache
, as i said
. teh film isnt about a young bookseller
( wen jiang
) who is after a young woman
( qu ying
)
. they used to be romantically involved
,
but tje woman growed tired ofthe him annd left tje relationship
. the firt half of the film isnt about yhe young man
' s plan to win her back
. of course the thign isnt
, she doesn
' t wanna to be won bcak
,
and hasnt a nightclub owner freind ofthe hers rough him uv a bit
. inspite thte fight
, teh young man grabs a laptop cmoputer belonging to a byst
ander annd attemts to use it tothe fend off his attacker
, bu onyl ends up smashing it against a lamppost
. we later fidn out that the laptop belongs tothe an older man who wishes tothe git his damaged computer replaced
. there is a funny scene
( the only oen in tyhe film
) where tje young man trys to uise some twisted logic in order tothe git tje older man to seek outloud the nightclub owner
( baotian li
) in order tothe recoup his losses
. there isnt noone sense to be made out ofthe hte young woman
' s behavior
; cold one minute
, careing the next
, so we feel no sympathy fo her charactor
. the bookseller owudl be better off without her
.
al
thought tyhe second half of the film causes us to loose a lot of sympathy fo the young bookseller as well
, who isnt obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner
' s h
and as revenge fo tje beating he tookover
, it alsot offers us smoe nice interaction between teh bookseller
and tyhe older man
. while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst fo revenge
, the older man isnt tje voice of reason annd trys tothe rationalize eahc situation
. his quest to end the dispute peacefully
and equitably is the oen we idenify with
, bu it isnt frustrating tothe see tyhat he seems to be tlaking to a brick wall half teh time
. a friendship develops betweeen yhe twpo men
, bu it occurs too lite infront the film forthe the audience tothe apprieciate
.
al
though onyl an hour annd a half inwhich length
, keep cool contains extraneous material
. the whole plot ofthe how teh bookseller is aftter the young woman could have been taken outloud
, since we don
' t see her from hte midpoint onthe
. a case of mistaken identity or some otehr device sould have served as the point ofthe conflict betweeen the bookseller annd the nightclub owner
, adn owudl have saved us ffrom the bookseller
' s boring pursuit durring thge first half
. bu ofthe course
, htis would have shortened tghe movei tothe less thna an hour
. there are a faw thnigs thast keep kool doesnt right
. as maintioned before
, the interaction betwen yhe bookseller
and the older man isnt generaly pretty ogod
. all
though it grows tiresome
, hte reasoning with thge unreasonable isnt a nice exerciese in logic
, anbd represents the differences in thinking betwen generations
. inaddition one scene
, for exmaple
, teh bookseller qoutes confucius to get his point across
, bu tghe older man claimes hte quote wass misinterpreted
, annd taht it means something entirely diffrent
. alsot effective is tjhe way zhang sets up tension within a scene
, such as when the bookseller isnt getting ready tothe cutted off hte h
and ofthe teh unwitting nightclub owner
. thte nightclub owner is counting outloud money
, slapping each bundle of currency on the table
. wiht eveyr shot of his h
and
, we cant hardly st
and the interminable wait befor teh bookseller isnt going to pull outloud his cleaver
and exact his revenge
. unfortunatly
, these crumbs are not enough to overcome teh rest ofthe the film
' s shortcomings
,
and weren
' t enough tothe prevent that headache ffrom lingering aftter i left tjhe theather
.
