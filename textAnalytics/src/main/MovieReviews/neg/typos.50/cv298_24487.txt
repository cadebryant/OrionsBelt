' t
- miss comedy
.
yet
, i must report disappointment
. tghe script is probably thte worst of 1999
. nearly every joke misfires
. the stabs at comic books are too obvious tothe be funny
.
( forthe example
, noone one can recogize capt
. amazing inthe his escret identity because he
' s wearing glasses
.
) teh fart jokes surrounding the spleen are suprisingly the only gags that wokr
. teh casted trys hard
, especialy hank azaria
, whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume
,
but hte script is just too lame to run
.
