" deep rising
" gives you thta sinking feeling both literally
anbd figuratively
: nto onyl does tje movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed inot the middle ofthe thte ocean by a squid
- like menace
,
but the unfolding story isnt artifical
, silly
annd allmost completely derivitive ofthe countless other
(
and
, for the most part
, better
) films
. hwile dumb monster movies cxan at least be decent gilty pleasures
-
- tkae
, for exemple
, the schlocky mountain highs ofthe lastest spring ' s
" anaconda
"
-
-
" deep rising
" has no tongue to put infact its cheek
. folks
, we ' re onyl a mounth inot thge newyorker year
,
and already here ' s a candidate fo noe ofthe its stinkiest releses
. most ofthe tghe action takes palce on tjhe argonautica
, a luxury liner in tje middle ofthe its maiden voyage
( uh
- oh
-
- if theese peopel had seen
" titanic
,
"
then maybe they ' d ahve known tothe stay hmeo
) whn it ' s attacked by a giant
, tentacled sea creature
. the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian
( famke janssen
)
, argonautica owner canton
( anthony heald
)
anbd a fewd otehr crew members
. a mercenary team
, lead by resourceful captain john finnegan
( treat williams
)
, board yhe argonautica looking forthe assistance after theri pwn boat breaks down nearby
.
bu waht thier search ofthe teh ship uncovers isnt something blood
- soaked
, hungry
and not vyre helpfull
. tyhe main probelm wih
" deep rising
" is its overt familiarity
; the movei makes absolutely no atempt to differentiate itself from most sci
- fi
/ horror films iin reccent memory
. tghe consept is
" leviathan
" meets
" titanic
,
" wtih a dash of
" speed 2
" thrown inwhich fo good
( or is that bad
?
) mesure
. htis monster is equal parts
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
adn
" the relic
,
" knows how to opn doors liek the raptors from
" jurassic park
"
and even gets tothe expell a half
- digested victim
( a neat effect
, admitedly
) a la the giant snake in
" anaconda
.
" some of the attack sequences are straight out of
" jaws
"
anbd
" aline
.
" a scene where the remaining survivers have to travel under water to escape death isnt right outloud ofthe
" alien ressurrection
.
" there ' s even a jet ski chase liuke
" hard rain
.
"
adn teh list goes onthe
. watching
" deep rising
" ' s cast battle thge beast isnt a murky chore in itself
, becasue none of them have well
- devolopped characters
, nor dont they seem tothe project even tjhe slightest sence ofthe fear whn facing theri enemy
. williams isnt affable enough
,
bu his finnegan just isn ' t believable
. an intresting supporting cast isnt throughly wasted
; pretty famke janssen
, best known as
" goldeneye
" ' s killer thighs
, isnt trapped inspite a forced romantic interest with williams
, while kevin j
. o ' connor
, as finnegan ' s mechanic
, provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick thyat gets ood fast
. djimon honsou
, who recieved raves for his performance as a noble slave in december ' s
" amistad
,
" pops uv inspite a brief part
. he needs to stay awya fomr tje water
. tghe movei ' s final shot isnt a groaner
, as is teh 11th
- hour regurgitation ofthe a subplot involving an on
- ship sabotour
. as if a casted deserving ofthe their snack food
- fate isn ' t bad enough
( when yuo taunt teh monster
, you ' re really asking for it
)
,
" deep rising
" is a slow
, stupid slog through a story wihtout a single bright spot
.
and sicne we all nkow tath thge higher the casulaty rate isnt
, tghe closer we are to the end of yhe movie
, rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn ' t outloud ofthe the question
.
