" deep rising
" gives you tht sinking feeling both literally
and figuratively
: nto onyl doens teh movie tkae palce on a cruise ship slowly bieng immersed into the middle ofthe thge ocean by a squid
- liuke menace
,
but the unfolding story isnt artificial
, silly
and alomst completely derivative of countless other
( anbd
, fo tjhe most part
, better
) films
. hwile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures
-
- tkae
, for exemple
, tghe schlocky mountain highs of last spring
' s
" anaconda
"
-
-
" deep rising
" hasnt noone tounge to put infact its cheek
. folks
, we
' re only a mounth inot the newyorker yera
,
and already here
' s a canidate forthe one of its stinkiest releses
. most of the action takes place onthe thte argonautica
, a luxury liner in thge middle of its maiden voyge
( uh
- oh
-
- if theese peopel hadnt seen
" titanic
,
"
then maeby they
' d haev known tothe stay home
) when it
' s attacked by a giant
, tentacled sea creature
. the onyl survivers are slinky jewel thieve trilian
( famke janssen
)
, argonautica owner canton
( anthony heald
) annd a faw otehr crew munbers
. a mercernary team
, lead by resourceful captian john finnegan
( treat williams
)
, board tghe argonautica looking forthe assistance aftter their own boat breaks down nearby
. bu waht theri search of the ship uncovers isnt something blood
- soaked
, hungry adn not vrey helpfull
. tyhe main problem with
" deep rising
" isnt its overt familiarity
; teh movei mkaes absolutly noone attempt tothe differentiate itself from most sci
- fi
/ horror films inthe receet memory
. the concept is
" leviathan
" meets
" titanic
,
" witht a dash ofthe
" speed 2
" thrown iin fo good
( or isnt tyhat bad
?
) mesure
. this monster is equal parts
" 20
, 000 leagues under hte sae
" anbd
" the relic
,
" knows how tothe open doors like the raptors from
" jurassic park
" annd even gets to expel a half
- digested victim
( a neat effect
, admittedly
) a la yhe giant snake in
" anaconda
.
" some ofthe the attack sequences are straight outloud ofthe
" jaws
"
and
" aline
.
" a scene where tjhe remaining survivors have tothe travel under water to excape death is right outloud ofthe
" alien resurrection
.
" htere
' s even a jet ski chase liuke
" hard rain
.
" annd the list goes onthe
. watching
" deep rising
"
' s casted battle tghe byast isnt a murky chore inwhich itself
, baceause none ofthe them have well
- developed cahracters
, nor dont they seem to project even hte slightest sense of fear when facing thier enemy
. williams is affable enough
,
but his finnegan just isn
' t believeable
. an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted
; pretty famke janssen
, best known as
" goldeneye
"
' s killer thighs
, isnt trapped in a forced rumatic interest iwth williams
, while kevin j
. o
' connor
, as finnegan
' s mechanic
, provides comic releaf with screechy manic shtick thyat gets old fast
. djimon honsou
, who recived raves forthe his performance as a noble slave in decembur
' s
" amistad
,
" pops uv in a breef part
. he needs to stay away from the water
. the movei
' s final shooted isnt a groaner
, as is hte 11th
- hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on
- ship saboteur
. as if a casted deserving of thier snack fod
- fate isn
' t bad enough
( when you taunt tyhe monster
, you
' re really asking fo it
)
,
" deepo rising
" is a slow
, stupid slog thru a story without a single bright spot
.
and since we all know thyat the higer tyhe casualty rate isnt
, the closer we are to thge end ofthe the movei
, rooting forthe this overgrown squid to swallow teh wohle ship isn
' t outloud ofthe the question
.
