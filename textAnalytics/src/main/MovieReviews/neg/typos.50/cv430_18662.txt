the happy bastard
' s quick movie review thte consept ofthe enjoying a stupid comedy isnt best realized as keeping it stupid
, realy
. shift gears even once annd tghe audiance cxan be thrown miserably outloud of control
. sadly
, taht is tghe case with kingpin
, a film directed by yhe farrelly brothers
, yhe duo that brung us ther
' s something about mary anbd dumb annd dumber
. sicne hte duo directed
and didn
' t rwite thge scirpt
, i can assume tht
' s part ofthe the probelm
. the stopry seems ogod enough
: a protem bowler infront thte 1970
' s by the name ofthe roy munson
( woody harrelson
) isnt sitting onthe top ofthe the world
. his popularity hasnt gone thru the roof
and he
' s getting his carreer off the ground
. thn
, howver
, he runs into ed mccracken
( bill murray
)
, a rival bowler with hardly any rela consideration for
, well
, anytying
. these twpo form an ill
- timed relatiopnship thgat involves risky betting
,
and
, before roy sees it coming
, ed
' s abanodned him anbd he
' s baout to loose his h
and iin a bowling ball machine
. forward seventeen yeasr later
, where roy hasnt become qtuie the losr
, complet with mechanical h
and
, torn
- up car
,
and
, ofthe course
, tyhe occasional knocking up of the ugly
- ass l
andlord tothe avoid paying rent forthe a while
.
however
, he finds a glimmer ofthe a hope upon a visit tothe a local bowling alley
, where he runs inot an amish kid named ishmael
( r
andy quaid
)
, who has quite the bowling arm
. wiht the kid
' s halp
, he figures he cxan be known agian
, particularly at yhe biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching infront reno
, nevada
. ofthe course
, the amish kid needs soem coaxing
, patricularly when yuo concider
, well
, he
' s amish
. tihs leads tothe soem ofthe the best comic scenes in thge film
, such as roy
' s process ofthe removing horseshoes or milking teh cow
. finally
, tghe duo get on teh road
and
, along hte way
, pik uv an additional helper
- a beautifull hustler
( palyed by tghe gorgeous vanessa angel
)
. teh main probelm i hadnt with kingpin wasn
' t teh fatc it wasn
' t funny
. iin fact
, it doens have some rether hilarious scenes infact it
, such as the aformentioned above
and roy
' s explanation ofthe not having childrens
( something involving a cheese grater
?
)
. bu that
' s jstu it
- scenes
. there
' s a cuple ofthe really sereous scenes taht throw off yhe entire momentum of yhe movei
, liek thge abuse angel tkaes fomr her hustler ex
- boyfriend
. i mean
, wass this really necesary
? couldn
' t have this beeen h
andled jstu a bit wackier
? i mean
, tihs isnt a comedy
, why throw ethics in
? particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle
, where hair gel cxan be easily mistaken
? that really ruined it
,
however
,
and taht
' s too bad
. the acting isnt top nitch
, especially from angel annd murray
, adn the realy funny scenes are worth noting
. still
, if you
' re going tothe htikn dumb
, htikn dumb all tyhe way thru
, ok
? at least the farrelly brothers got back on track wih mary or i
' d still be a little bit irked
.
