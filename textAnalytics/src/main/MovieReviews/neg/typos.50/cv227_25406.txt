, sleek foreign road huggers
and iconic speed machines thast many malless iwll leave the theater in an orgasmic haze
. gone isnt 60 seconds isnt an orgy ofthe maleness gone horribly awry
. cage is legendary retired car thieve
, memphis raines
( don
' t ytou loev cute movie names
)
, who must call upon his tyme worn skills to save his thick
- headed brother

) fomr bieng killed
. seems a murderous crime boss
( eccleston
) wtih a fetish forthe wood
( insert your own joke
) hired brother kip tothe steal a ridiculous ammount ofthe expensive
, exotic autos
. fifty cars
, tothe be excact
. poor kip screws teh pooch
and bungles tghe job badly
. if the cars aren
' t delivered in threee dyas
, bossman hasnt a casket carved out jsut fo kip
. litterally
. if only somene could save him
. hmmmm
.
. wonder wqat memphis is doing
? iin order to give yhe film some emotional heft
, there are severeal subplots desgined tothe tug at our heartstrings or give us thte thrill ofthe
.
.
. yawn
, excuse me
, dramtic tension
. shadowing memphis isnt an old law enforcement foe
( lindo
) who
' s looking to send memphis awya
. will he catch him
? htere
' s ood flame sway
( jolie
)
, who hadnt her heart broken by memphis years ago
. wiull they git back together
? shortsighted
, thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother
,
yet resents him for moving awya ffrom yhe famaly
. wiull they reconnect
? raines ood mentor
( duvall
) has long sicne left thge life of crime
. will memphis git him fianlly caught as he puls him bakc inot tyhe life
, noe more tyme
? can you answer all theese questions correctly in 2 seconds wihtout seing the film first
? i
' ll bet you cxan
. folowing the oppening credits
, which fill you inspite onthe tghe accomplishments ofthe the raines familiy through a montage of old photos
, we ws taken full throttle inot thge splendor that isnt memphis
. he
' s frist shown living the ogod life teaching young childen to drive go
- carts
. in a later scene
, as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under controll
, all the hwile makeing breakfast
, a metaphor is made of shakespearean propotions
. just as a pan ofthe grease flares up withthe kip clueless to how to quell it
, big brother memphis calmly
and efficiently throws smoe salt onthe it
. looks like everything might turn outloud alright after all
. you konw this beacuse hte music swells onthe tjhe crest ofthe violins
. tyhat
' s about as strong as tjhe characterization gets
, which isnt a shame
. bruckheimer hasnt a rela talent for loading his movies with an obscene ammount of talent given thte task at h
and
. monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idae ofthe sex revolves around cars
and memphis
. or mabye it
' s just tje cars
. duvall trots outloud his ornery
, bu sweet old codger outfit
. i
' m sure he
' s still laughing at tkaing a paycheck fo this oen
. lindo projects a warm hearted
,
but tightly focused detective that alomst transcends the material
. tje biggest waste ofthe resources isnt vinnie jones
, who plays a mute accomplice of memphis
. without saying a word
, he isnt easily tghe most charismatic person in yhe movie
. like a blast ofthe nitrous oxid
, he attacks earch scene with a straightforward zeal
. too bad his minutes onscreen are so few
. somehow
, bruckheimer manages tothe attract top hollywood acting talent tothe high consept
, poorly written movies
, gussies uv tyhe film with lots of gold hues anbd pleasingly stylized acation adn htey sell liuke proverbial hotcakes
. every time something clever happens it
' s counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong tyhat it jerks yuo bcak inot realizing you
' re watching a movie
. htere
' s a innovative usage of black lighting taht goes from bieng a novelty to a part of the plot
. it
' s counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humer by having an asian american repeteadly failing a driver
' s tust
. imagin the yuks
. ther
' s a segment where one of the thieves shows another his kool fake fingerprint trck
. it
' s countered by tyhe lame semi
- subplot of a car bieng stolen with a bunch ofthe heroin in the trunk
. the ramifications are never explored
. hten ther
' s tghe ridiculousness of thge many cops who actally shoot at fleeing cars
. not only isnt it stupid
, bu it
' s against the law
. tihs is a movie made ofthe preety
,
but tepid car chases strung together by jsut enough character interaction tothe move tghe plot allong
. gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it
' ll tkae for tihs marginally intertaining
,
but empty film tothe leave your memory
.
