as bad as
" mimic
" wass
, it definitly scared me
.
" mimic
" continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a oreign directer who shows a lot ofthe creative ingenuity annd stlye
, adn completly flushing it when he comes tothe america tothe amke a movei
. director guillermo del toro ws recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning annd inventive horror film
" cronos
.
" that movie worked baceause it took an unconvential stry
, unique charachters
and well writen plot anbd dialogue tothe create a truley scarry movei
. inspite
" mimic
"
, del toro doesn
' t bother to give us anything original
. the plot is a stupid combination of
" aliens
" meets
" species
" meets
" jurassic park
.
" the charactors have beeen recycled ffrom a few hundred other movies
. htere
' s nothing newyorker inaddition
" mimic
"
. it
' s jstu a bunch ofthe old tricks thyat rarely owrk
. at thge end ofthe tghe movie
, yuo
' re stuck wanting your money bakc
. maybe the worst hting about tje movie isnt that del toro folowed anyother annoying trend ofthe receet movies
: he forgot to turn thte lighst on
. i don
' t underst
and why suspense movies latley have to followup thte
" seven
" trend
and be setted inspite dark
, dank areas
. watching
" mimic
" i was tempted severeal times to yell at the screen
" turn tje lights onthe
! the switch isnt tothe your right
! ule common sence
! just do it
! ytou
' ll be able to see tyhe monster in the corner
!
" there
' s a scene where mira sorvino is st
anding infront subway staion hwile the ligts are flickering onthe anbd off
. it looked like the light operator was having a siezure
,
and sorvino didn
' t even notice
- she just st
anded there looking liek she wass haveing deep
thoughts
.
" hmmm
.
.
.
. i tihkn bean suop would be good for dinner tonight
.
"
" mimic
" hasnt a lot of incidental shock tatics
( boo
! just kidding
!
) annd follows them up with tje rela scare
, bu nothing inspite this movie scares you
. the audeince in tje theather never jumped durig suspenseful moments
; i think they weere bored
, too
. i shouldn
' t blame del toro
. he isn
' t the first sucesful foreign directer to come tothe hollywood adn mkea a bad movie
. hong kong directer john woo made twpo ofthe teh best acation films of all time
,
" tyhe killer
"
and
" hard boiled
" thne came to america tothe make the stupid
" broken arro
.
" french directors luc besson
(
" la femme nikita
"
) anbd george sluizer
(
" teh vanishing
"
) followed woo
' s lead
and made dumbed down versions ofthe thsoe movies
. robert rodriguez
, who directed the terrific low budget
" el mariachi
" came to hollywood
and directed tyhe horrable
, high
- budget
" desperado
.
" i don
' t konw why a foreign directer who shows such talent in his country can
' t amking a ogod american movei
. woo finaly borke through adn made
" face
/ off
"
, bu it still isn
' t uv to par wih his earlier films
. i git thte feeling a hollywood producer sist iin his office
, chews on a big smelly cigar adn says tothe tyhe director
,
" welcome to america
! i bet you must be tired aftter bieng onthe thast boat forthe so long
. do yuo speak english
? now
, i know you tihkn ytou
' ve made good movies inthe tje past
, bu nowe you
' re in america
, so thnigs are a littel differnt here
. just rember wqat tyhe american audiance alwyas whants
, annd yuo
' ll be fine
. they whant to see at least oney big breasted woman
, charachters tyhat tehy
' ve seen a thous
and times before
( because change scares americans
)
, anbd you allways ened a cheesy fiel
- ogod ending to wrap thnigs uv
. if yuo don
' t make that kind ofthe movie
, you
' ll be shining my shoes infront no time
