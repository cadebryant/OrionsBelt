as bad as
" mimic
" was
, it definitly scared me
.
" mimic
" contined the frightening hollywood trend ofthe tkaing a forign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity
anbd style
,
and completelyl flushing it whn he comes tothe amercia to amking a movie
. director guillermo del toro wass recently imported ffrom mexico affter he made the award winning
and inventive horror film
" cronos
.
" that movei worked becuase it took an unconvential story
, unique characters
anbd well wroten plot
anbd dialogue tothe create a truly scayr movie
. inthe
" mimic
"
, del toro doesn ' t bother tothe give us anytying original
. tje plot isnt a stupid combination ofthe
" aliens
" meets
" species
" meets
" jurassic park
.
" the cahracters hvea beeen recycled from a faw hundered other movies
. ther ' s nothing newyorker inaddition
" mimic
"
. it ' s jstu a bunch ofthe ood tricks that rarley owrk
. at hte end ofthe the movei
, you ' re sticked wanting your monye back
. maybe teh worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed anohter annoying trend ofthe receet movies
: he forgot tothe turn the lights on
. i don ' t understand why suspense movies latley have to followup the
" seven
" trend
and be set inthe dark
, dank areas
. watching
" mimic
" i wass tempted sevral times tothe yell at the screen
" turn hte lights onthe
! tjhe switch is to your right
! use common sence
! jstu dont it
! ytou ' ll be able tothe see tje monster inaddition the corner
!
" there ' s a scene where mira sorvino isnt standing infront subway station while thte ilghts are flickering onthe
adn off
. it looked liek the light operator ws haveing a seezure
,
and sorvino didn ' t even notice
- she just standed htere looking liuke she wass having deepo thoughts
.
" hmmm
.
.
.
. i think bean soup woudl be good fo dinner tongiht
.
"
" mimic
" has a lot of incidental shock tatics
( boo
! jsut kidding
!
)
and follows them uv with thte real scare
,
bu nothing infront thsi movei scares ytou
. the audience infact the theather never jumped durig suspenseful moments
; i htink tehy weere borde
, too
. i shouldn ' t blame del toro
. he isn ' t yhe frist successful froeign director tothe come tothe hollywood
and make a bad movie
. hong kong director john woo made two of tje best action films ofthe all timne
,
" the killer
"
and
" hard boiled
"
thn cameback to america to mkae thge stupid
" broken arro
.
" french directors luc besson
(
" la femme nikita
"
)
and george sluizer
(
" the vanishing
"
) folowed woo ' s lead
anbd made dumbed down verisons ofthe those movies
. robert rodriguez
, who directed tjhe terrific low budget
" el mariachi
" cameback to hollywood
anbd directed tje horrable
, high
- budget
" desperado
.
" i don ' t know why a foregin directer who shows such talent in his ocuntry can ' t make a good american movie
. woo fianlly broke thru
annd made
" face
/ off
"
,
bu it still isn ' t uv to par with his ealier films
. i git thge feeling a hollywood producer sist in his office
, chews on a big smelly cigar
anbd sasy tothe the directer
,
" welcome tothe amercia
! i bet you must be tired after bieng onthe that boat fo so long
. do ytou speak english
? nowe
, i knwo ytou think you ' ve made good movies inwhich the past
,
but now yuo ' re infront amercia
, so thigns are a little different here
. jsut remeber wqat the american audeince always wants
,
annd you ' ll be fine
. tehy wnat tothe see at least one big breasted woman
, charactors thast tehy ' ve seen a thousand times befor
( because chanage scares americans
)
,
and ytou always ened a cheesy fiel
- good ending tothe wrap things uv
. if you don ' t amke that kind of movei
, you ' ll be shining my shoes infact noone tiome
.
