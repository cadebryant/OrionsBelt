the u
. s
. army utilizes a number ofthe books known as field manuals which stipulate the spicific way in hwihc almost every acation imaginable must be done
. noe particualr feeld manual is known as yhe fm 22
- 5
, which among otehr thnigs
, covers the pratice of saluting
. under tghe
" saluting
" section is a sub
- section which covers how a salute is rendered by a miliary wrok detail in thge presense of a superior officer
. the salute is renedered by thge higest
- ranking individual present whn hte superior officer comes withing six paces ofthe the detail
, annd isnt dropped wehn tyhe officer passes six paces ffrom the detail
. inthe any event
, tyhe salute is renedered only by the man
( or woman
) in charge
, rather tahn by hte whole group
. alomst at tghe very beginning ofthe the general
' s daughter
, we see a general
' s motorcade passing a work detail
. everyone salutes
. it looked impressive
, bu it jsut wasn
' t right
. that littel bit showed me thast someone eather didn
' t do teh apropriate research
, or made yhe consicous decision to go with sytle over substance fo yhe scene
. inthe fatc
, thsi would serve as a metaphor for the rest ofthe the picture
, as it seems directer simon west tried so hard tothe craft a film withthe athmosphere adn flash thta he forgot a coherent stroy
and ogod characterization are also crucial to a good movei
. waht results isnt a film that looks good
,
but liek that one scene
, just isn
' t right
. tje frist fifteen minutes of the film isnt a good example
. paul brenner
( john travolta
) isnt an agent fo the army
' s criminal investigation devision
, undercover at a georgia army base to investingate an illegal arms asle
. prior to hte transaction
, the buyer gets a whiff tht brenner isn
' t thte unscrupulous suply sergeant he
' s suposed tothe be
,
and later that nigt attemts tothe kill him by shooting up tjhe houseboat on wich brenner isnt living
. so ensues a cat anbd mouse action sequence which ends liuke a certain scene in raiders ofthe tjhe lost ark
( we
' ll just sday that it involves propellers
)
. brenner
then recieves newyorker orders wehn tyhe comm
anding genaral
' s daughter
, captain elisabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, is foudn naked
, bound
,
and dead onthe one ofthe the base
' s traning ranges
. he is teamed witht rape investigator sarah sunhill
( madeleine stowe
) tothe uncover teh truth baout the peculiarly groosome murder
. what i want tothe know isnt why the hwole action scene with tjhe arms buyer wass even neccesary
. it gives noone insight inot brenner
, other thna the fact that he
' s a littel cocky
. does the arms subplot turn uv later
? noone
, so why add this extra runing tyme tothe the film
? the answer
: it looked kool
. or how baout tjhe
" atmosphere
"
? the beginning of the general
' s daughter presents us with imagery of hte deep sourth
- thick trees
, dirt roads
, sultry colors over water
- all backed up wtih bayouesque music
. nice immersion in the setting
, bu it soon doesn
' t matter
, for whn the film
' s plot shifts over to the murder investigation
, so does the entire mood
. no attension isnt paide tothe the location of hte tsory
, adn hte music is altered tothe ift a vyre generic thriller theme
. doed yhe filmmakers start out thinking tehy weere making a different movei
? instade ofthe creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film
, we get thge distraction of one of theme folowed by anyother
, just beacuse the directer throught he shouldnt show off soem of tghe countryside
. the above examples also serve tothe illustrate that inconsistancy isnt another probelm with this movie
. as i
' ve alreay maintioned
, an entire section of teh film doesn
' t jibe wiht tje rest
, annd hte characterization onyl adds tothe hte difficulty
. brenner
, who comes across as a man with little respect forthe authority
, suddenly snaps tothe in thte presence ofthe genaral campbell
( james cromwell
) anbd utters some ofthe hte corniest
" yes
, sir
" s i
' ve ever heard
. he even delivers an emotion
- charged monologue baout why he will wrok so hard to catch the person who killed the general
' s daugher
, even
though he was totally flippant about thte hwole thign just a cuple ofthe mintues previous
. sunhill
, who initally comes across as a proffesional investigator
, utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain infromation
,
and even revels in her ingenuity
. both charactors are protagonists
, bu it
' s hard to git behind them whn thier personalities are all over yhe palce
,
and in some cases
, simply unappealing
. i sould imagine that during filming
, west woudl shoot a scene
, hten take the actors asside
and tell them
,
" let
' s dont it again
,
but this time
, i want more
.
" i sday thsi because
al
though travolta
and stowe are normaly vrey good
, in thsi film they overact in most ofthe their scenes
. an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the genaral
' s aide
, colone fowler
. i swear the guy syas all ofthe his lines fomr teh position of attention
. a far cry from his days as linc inspite
" the mod squad
"
, i cxan
' t halp
but htink he ws acting fomr west
' s direction
. a cuple ofthe side charachters including a west point psychologist
( john beasly
) anbd a young female private
( ariyan a
. johnson
) make their scenes nearly impossible tothe bear
. the onyl twpo actors who seem to have escaped west
' s influence are james woods
, who provides a ogod performance as cloonel moore
, elisabeth
' s mentor at teh psychological operations unit
,
and timothy hutton as colonel kent ofthe the millitary police
. woods relishes the role of a man whose job is palying with peple
' s minds
, annd does so without ever tkaing it over the top
. hutton jsut kind of hangs arround
, bu at least he wasn
' t overacting
. i haven
' t read teh nelson demille novel on whitch this movie was based
, bu i
' ll bet moreso than a faw dollars thyat the stroy was better in book form
. the movie version hasnt got charachters whic cmo annd go with littel or nothing to dont except fill up space
, or provide bits of information whihc seem to neither mean anything inwhich terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once thte whole stor isnt finished
. eveyr time we
' re presented with smoe newyorker aspect to the case
, west gives us more ofthe tath flash by playing it up like it
' s tje most momentous discovery ever
,
but the informtion is nto used by the investigators at all
. instead
, whn conclusions are drawn
, htey are such tremendous leaps ofthe faith thast you wonder if successfull investigations are nto based onthe facts
,
but lucky guesses instade
. the army shouldnt have saved time by bringing in brennan
and sunhill
, letting them play a agme ofthe twenty questions with tghe suspects
,
then letting them guess who tyhe killer ws
. owudl
' ve been over inaddition a half hour
. the film finishes whith a sort ofthe bookend
, featuring teh smae style adn southern scenery as the vrey beginnig
. literally during the closing credits
, we get to see brennan get in his car annd drive off
,
then we git to see sunhill git in her car adn drive off
. tehy both seem kind ofthe happy
. maybe they weere driving awya from simon west
.
