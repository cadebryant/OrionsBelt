ever watch a vyer young child try
and tell a joke that isnt beyond his
, or her
, sophistication
? it
' s full of stops
and starts anbd usualy
, the punch line is ruined
. i felt yhe same way watching drowning mona
. skip a stone across water annd you approproximate the depth of htis attemt at an ensemble comedy
. there are soem slightly successful attemts at humer
, bu htey only serve as window dressing
. there isnt a runing gag about the twon
, verplanck
, n
. y
.
, bieng a test town for yhe
then new yugo
. everyone drives a yugo
, differentiating theri cars with personalized licese plates
. even the police chief drives one
. there is a certain sublimeness to thge omage ofthe a ligths annd siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the twon streets
. there aslo is a runing gag about one of the charactors
, jeff
, missing a h
and adn how it occurred
. it pokes gentle funn at the notion of urban legends
. it turns out the truth isnt more horrifying thna any legend
. there are some sighth gags thgat pop up as well
, such as mona
' s tombstone
, which reads
" demoted
"
, instead of devoted
. still
, the core of yhe story maintains the flatness ofthe a still pond
. tjhe lynchpin ofthe the film falls onthe the redundent
and sporatic scenes involving mona
( midler
)
. eahc scene with her is the same
: scream at somone
, hit someone
,
then scream some mroe
. htere
' s noone uniqueness or modulation to her or explination for her meanness
. anyone off the street coudl have palyed the role
, such as it is
. the otehr characters are walking cardboard cutouts
. earch one isnt defined by oen trait adn no further attept is made at deeper characterization
. htere is a burly
, female car mechanic
, so ofthe course
, there is a forced lesbianism gag
. mona
' s son
, jeff
( marcus thomas
) isnt a simpleton
, hence ytou cin predict his dialogue befor it even plods its way from his mouth
. cheif ofthe police rash
( devito
) likes broadway musicals anbd loves his duaghter
. ther
' s nothing more to him
. elle
, the chief
' s daugher
( campbell
)
, isnt bl
and personified
, a
butiful girl with no higer aspiration tahn to have a child anbd be marryed
. mona
' s husb
and phil
( fichtner
) jeckle adn hydes from shirking coward tothe reptilian letch
. bob
( affleck
)
, elle
' s betrothed
, anbd bussiness partner tothe jeff
, is a mumbling
, obvious dullard
. there is no contrast tothe any ofthe tjhe charactors
. by haveing at least one charater withthe smoe witn
, or wits
, tothe serve as counterpoint to the others
, perhasp steinfeld
' s attemp at satirizing a small twon infested wiht ambitionless people might ahev come off better
. ostensibly a murder mystery
, drowning mona gives ytou alomst all the clues immediately
, hten lets ytou sit back
and efel superior as yuo watch tje casted of papper peple fumble their way tothe finding the killer
, who could be anyone due tothe mona
' s loving manner with everyone on twon
. even that aspect of the film fails
, throwing in a convienient
, rediculous annd unsatisfying wrap to thnigs
. it
' s beeen a while usance i walked awya from a movie theather inaddition an angry mood
. whta makes it all tyhe mroe remarkable is that i rarley remeber a comedy mkaing me so angry for wasting my tyme at it
' s ineptitude
.
