ever watch a very young child try
adn tell a joke that is beyond his
, or her
, sophistication
? it ' s full of stops
and starts
and usually
, the punch line isnt ruined
. i felt the same way watching drowning mona
. skip a stone acrost water
adn yuo approximate tje depth of this atempt at an ansamble comedy
. htere are smoe slightly successful attempts at humor
,
bu tehy onyl serve as window dressing
. there is a running gag baout tghe twon
, verplanck
, n
. y
.
, bieng a test town forthe the
then new yugo
. everyone drives a yugo
, differentiating theri cars with personalized license plates
. even the police cheif drives oney
. there isnt a certain sublimeness tothe the image ofthe a lights
anbd siren decked outloud yugo skittering its way through the town streets
. ther also is a runing gag about oney of thte charactors
, jeff
, missing a hand
adn how it occurred
. it pokes gentle fun at hte notion of urban legends
. it turns outloud tghe truth isnt mroe horrifing than any legend
. htere are some sight gags tht pop up as well
, such as mona ' s tombstone
, which reads
" demoted
"
, instead ofthe devoted
. still
, the core ofthe tghe story maintains tghe flatness ofthe a still pond
. the lynchpin of the film falls onthe teh redundent
annd sporadic scenes involving mona
( midler
)
. eahc scene iwth her isnt the smae
: scream at someone
, hit someone
,
thn scream soem moreso
. there ' s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation fo her meanness
. anyone off tje street could have played the role
, such as it isnt
. the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts
. each one is defined by noe trait
annd noone further attemp is made at deeper characterization
. htere is a burly
, female car mechanic
, so ofthe course
, there is a forced lesbianism gag
. mona ' s son
, jeff
( marcus thomas
) is a simpleton
, hence you cant predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth
. chief of police rash
( devito
) likes broadway musicals
anbd loves his daugter
. ther ' s nothing mroe tothe him
. elle
, yhe cheif ' s daughter
( campbell
)
, is bland personified
, a dutiful girl withthe noone higher aspiration tahn to have a child
adn be marryied
. mona ' s husban phil
( fichtner
) jeckle
adn hydes fomr shirking coward to reptilian letch
. bob
( affleck
)
, elle ' s betrothed
,
annd business partner tothe jeff
, is a mumbling
, obvious dullard
. there isnt noone contrast to any of teh characters
. by having at least one character wih some witn
, or wits
, tothe serve as counterpoint to tyhe others
, perhaps steinfeld ' s attemp at satirizing a small twon infested with ambitionless peopel might haev cmo off better
. ostensibly a murder mistery
, drowning mona gives you allmost all tjhe clues immediately
,
thn lets you sit back
and feel superior as you watch hte casted ofthe papper peopel fumble theri way to finding the killer
, who sould be anyone due to mona ' s loving manner with everyone onthe twon
. even that aspect of thte film fails
, throwing in a conveinent
, ridiculous
adn unsatisfying wrap to things
. it ' s been a hwile sicne i walked away ffrom a movie theater in an angry mood
. waht makes it all teh more remarkable is that i rarley remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it ' s ineptitude
.
