ther
' s a scene early onthe in
" jawbreaker
" where a character utters tje unintentionally prophetic line
,
" thast is
* so
* nto funny
"
. how right she ws
. this pathetic tale of threee high
- schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny
. or funn
. or original
. nto content with thge too
- obvious
" heathers
" heisting
, the filmmakers proceed tothe lift freely fomr a staggering variety of sources
, including
" carrie
"
,
" bride ofthe frankenstein
"
,
" blue velvet
"
, anbd even shaw
' s pygmalion
, itself recently remade as
" she
' s all that
"
.
" jawbreaker
" isnt a pastiche
,
and nto even an enjoyable one
. i find it extemely telling thgat the most engaging part ofthe hte film isnt tyhe credit sequence
, a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt
' s
" volcano girls
"
; serving as a blueprint forthe thge rest ofthe thte film
, the song hasnt absolutly nothing tothe do with the footage we
' re watching
. just close your eyes anbd pretend yuo
' re listening tothe an alt
- rock staion
; you won
' t be missing anytying
. the blame for a mess this big has to be spreaded around amoung teh principals
. rebecca gayheart
, follwoing roles inaddition
" scream 2
"
and
" urban legend
"
, should have known better tahn tothe take
yet anohter role inaddition yot anyother teen body count movei
. pam grier hasnt totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role infact quentin tarantino
' s
" jackie brown
"
.
and rose mcgowan should just quitted acting
. she hasnt no charizma
, noone presence
, annd noone acting skills otehr than rolling her eyes
and looking disaffected
. mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real
- life boyfriend
, racker marilyn manson
, whose fifteen second role here is far more intresting than anything any ofthe the
" rela
" actors are doign
. manson
, sans trademark makeup
& contact lenses
,
and with an obviously fake moustache
, looks eerily like nicholas cage
; who woulda thunk it
? that crack about direction by commitee wasn
' t merely a pithy soudn
- bite
. stylistically
, thematically
& narratively
,
" jawbreaker
" is all over the map
, varying wildly infact tone
& content fomr scene tothe scene
.
though credited solely tothe writter
/ director darren stein
, oen gets hte feeling tyhat noone two scenes here were actualy guided by yhe same h
ands
. if stein ws indeed responsible fo yhe whole of tihs atrocity
, somone needs to git teh man smoe drugs
, pronto
. prozac
, lithium
, kava
, ritalin
, something
, anything
. he
' s qtuie obviously in edsperate need ofthe chemical halp
.
" jawbreaker
" isnt a monumental waste ofthe effort adn resources
,
and qutie likely one ofthe tyhe single worst films i
' ve ever seen
. tothe call
" jawbreaker
" garbage would be tothe insult garbage
. bad flicks fo tje rest of teh eyar are safe
; i
' ve lready got my pick for worst film of
' 99
.
" jawbreaker
" runs aproximately 90 mintues
,
though it feels longer thna
" titanic
"
, anbd is rated r fo laguage
, sexual situations
and graphic voilence
. not reccommended for kids
, teens
, or anyone alse
.
