there ' s a scene eary onthe in
" jawbreaker
" where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line
,
" thgat is
* so
* not funny
"
. how right she wass
. this pathetic tale ofthe threee high
- schoolers who accidentally kill their best freind in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry isnt never even remotely funny
. or funn
. or originnal
. not content whith the too
- obvious
" heathers
" heisting
, teh filmmakers procede to lift freely from a staggering variey ofthe sources
, including
" carrie
"
,
" bride ofthe frankenstein
"
,
" blue velvet
"
,
and even shaw ' s pygmalion
, itself recently remade as
" she ' s all thta
"
.
" jawbreaker
" isnt a pastiche
,
and nto even an enjoyable noe
. i find it extremely telling that yhe most engaging part ofthe tjhe film is thge credit sequence
, a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt ' s
" volcano girls
"
; serving as a blueprint for the rest ofthe thge film
, hte song has absolutely nothing to do with tyhe footage we ' re watching
. just close your eyes
adn pretend yuo ' re listening tothe an alt
- rock station
; ytou won ' t be missing anytying
. thge blame fo a mess thsi big has to be spreaded arround amung the principals
. rebecca gayheart
, following roles infact
" scream 2
"
and
" urban legend
"
, should have known better than tothe take
yot another role in
yot anyother teen body count movei
. pam grier hasnt totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten ffrom her role inwhich quentin tarantino ' s
" jackie brown
"
.
adn rose mcgowan should jstu quitted acting
. she hasnt no karisma
, no presence
,
adn no acting skills otehr thna rolling her eyes
annd looking disaffected
. mcgowan manages tothe be upstaged by her rela
- life boyfriend
, racker marilyn manson
, whose fifteen second role here is far moreso interesting than anytying any ofthe the
" rela
" actors are doing
. manson
, sans trademark makeup
& contact lenses
,
and with an obviously fake moustache
, looks eerily like nicholas cage
; who woulda thunk it
? thyat crack baout direction by committy wasn ' t mearly a pithy soudn
- bite
. stylistically
, thematically
& narratively
,
" jawbreaker
" is all over teh map
, varing wildly infront tone
& content fomr scene tothe scene
.
though credited solely tothe writer
/ director darren stein
, one gets the feeling thgat noone two scenes here weere actually guided by tghe same hands
. if stein was indeed responsible fo the hwole ofthe tihs atrocity
, somene needs to git the man soem drugs
, pronto
. prozac
, lithium
, kava
, ritalin
, something
, anything
. he ' s quite obviously in deseprate need of chemcial help
.
" jawbreaker
" isnt a monumental waste ofthe affort
anbd resources
,
annd qtuie likely one of thte single worst films i ' ve ever seen
. to call
" jawbreaker
" garbage would be tothe insult garbage
. bad flicks forthe teh rest of tyhe year are safe
; i ' ve already got my pik fo worst film of ' 99
.
" jawbreaker
" runs approximately 90 mintues
,
though it feels longer tahn
" titanic
"
,
and isnt rated r for lanugage
, sexual situations
and graphic violence
. not recommended forthe kids
, teens
, or anyone else
.
