one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often
- acclaimed directer sidney lumet
' s
" gloria
,
" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film
, hadnt absolutly no effect onthe me occurred wehn i was driving hmeo from teh theatre
. suddenly
, i realized that sicne i had st
anded up from my theatre seat five minutes befor
, i had nto throught once about the film i hadnt just invested nearly two hours ofthe my life in
. whn a movei is over
, aren
' t we supposted to htikn baout it forthe a while
, annd ahve a conversation baout it with teh acquaintances we have jsut watched it wih
? i thougth so
, bu
, forthe one
, i saw thsi particular picture by mysef
,
and
# 2
, even if i had been wtih somone htere wouldn
' t hvae beeen anything tothe talk about in yhe first place
. to be sure
,
" gloria
" begins with a stirring
, rather poignant prologue infront whlch a seven
- year
- ood boy
' s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters
, infront search ofthe a disc his father had wih incriminating evidence on it
. right befor thge men broke in
, ofthe course
, his father gavey him the disc tothe escape witht
. eventualy
, the boy
, named nicky nunez
( jean
- luke figueroa
)
, isnt caught by the mobsters
, adn taked bcak to theri apartment
. meanwhile
, gloria
( sharon stone
) hasnt just gotten out of prision for a crime she didn
' t commit
and returns tothe her ex
- boyfriend
( jeremy northam
) to recieve hte monay he promised her fo covering up his crime
. when he refuses to give it tothe her
, anbd thn hears thte group ofthe men tlaking about killing nicky
, she leaves iwth him in order tothe save his life
, bu not before holding hte men at gunpoint
, stealing all ofthe thier money
, adn forcing them tothe strip nude
. gloria isnt thte tipe ofthe fast
- talking
, smart
- mouthed new yorker who allways seems tothe git involved withthe the wrong peple
,
and she never expected tothe be stuck with a kid
,
but she has a heart of gold
( don
' t tehy always inspite this type of movei
)
and isnt only trying to protect tyhe boy
, whom she quicklyu beigns to form a close bond witht
. tghe previous incarnation ofthe
" gloria
" by cassavetes
and starring the luminous gena rowl
ands
, remains unseen by me
, bu wass no doubt superior
, even
though i cant
' t raelly imagin how this considerably dull story coudl be transformed inot an entertaining one
, reguardless of the directer or stars
. there isnt noone dout in my mind tath director lumet hasnt stuck closley to thte original
,
but hte film itself isnt simpley lifeless
, wtih only an occasional laff popping uv here
and there so taht it isn
' t completelyl unbearable to watch
. i liked
, forthe exmaple
, a vyre funny climactic sequence where gloria isnt deciding whther tothe leave thge school she has left the boy at
,
and keesh turning the car around
,
then driving a littel ways
,
then slamming onthe the brakes annd turning aroud again
. these bright moments
, howver
, appear long
and far vetween
, anbd the majoroty ofthe thge film deals wtih thge budding relationship between nicky anbd gloria
, whlch isnt both painfully predictable
and by
- hte
- numbers
. throughtout
, my mind was repeatedly asking teh question
,
" who really cares
?
" as gloria
, sharon stone hasnt adopted an over
- the
- top brooklyn accent thta honestly doesn
' t sound realistic at all
. in tje beginning
, in fact
, i wass amazed at how amateurish stone
' s performance wass
,
but as teh film progessed she got better
.
al
thought not one of her better turns
, stone doens ahev a comic flare that refuses tothe be ignored
. jean
- luke figeroa was fine as nicky
and a littel omre natrual thna yhe usual child actors who are so precocious tehy make ytou want tothe gag
. all otehr actors who appeared weere considerably wasted
, none more thna cathy moriarty
, an entertaining actress in her own right
, who is billed fourth adn hasnt all of one scene
, as gloria
' s freind whom she turns to for help
. sony
, the studio that released
" gloria
,
" obviously does nto have any faith in the film
,
and i don
' t blaim them
. htey declined tothe screen tjhe picture for criticists
, which is never a ogod sign
, partcularly with hte high
- profile people involved
.
al
though how much money a movei makes does nto determine how good it is
( just look at the spectacular
" inaddition dreasm
,
" whitch failed tothe even mkae hte top 10 last week
)
, i have a suspision
" gloria
" is goign to vanish from theaters faster than
" ishtar
,
" judging ffrom teh opening night 7
: 00 p
. m
. showing i saw it at
, where there were baout ten to fifteen peple present
, counting myself
. all
though stone can be an impressive actress
( just watch her iin 1995
' s
" casino
" or 1996
' s
" last dance
" if yuo don
' t believe me
)
and sidney lumet can be a respectable director
, there isnt no reasoning fo why htey
thought the cliched story of
" gloria
" was worth remaking or
, fo thta matter
, why columbia picturesk agreed to finance it when htey sould have been mkaing a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling ofthe a chance tothe be succesfull
