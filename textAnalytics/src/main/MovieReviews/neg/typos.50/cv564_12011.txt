my giant begins with a monologue that
' s mroe funny than not
and a disctinctive

? 90s efel
. i was pleasantly suprised how sharp the comedy was
, witht very funny scenes occurring on a movei set infact romania where talent agent sammy
( billy crystal
) is visiting a client anbd inwhich yhe monestary where sammy ends uv aftter bieng mysteriously saved wehn he acidently plunges his car inot a stream
. annd when sammy meets max
, his giant
, mysterious savior palyed by gheorghe muresan
, there is magic in thge air
; albiet it a bit goofy
, i loved every minute ofthe it
. thte film
, ofthe course
, plays onthe thte size diference between the twpo
,
and at times yuo owudl almost swear it must be special effects
. i particularly enjoyed a shot ofthe sammy dangling his legs from a max
- sized chair as thge twpo face each over an enourmous tabel
and eat fomr oversized bowls
and spoons
. i allso liekd jere burns
'
( from tv
' s
` something so right
'
) performance as yhe directer of tje film in romania
. at this point
, tje primary flwa infact tghe film is that gheorghe muresan isnt incredibly hard to underst
and
, particularly during his fast
- pased first scene
. it is unfortunate that tjhe script recquired him to speak quicklyu right out of tyhe gate
, as i did underst
and him omre as hte film contined
and i bacame accustomed tothe his speech
. howver
, about the time muresan becomes coherent
, hte charactors head tothe newyorker york annd tjhe film takes a dive
. off the high board
. suddenly
, we are expected to believe sammy is a do
- whatever
- it
- takes slime ball
. up until this point he ws pursuing his pwn interests to be sure
, bu he didn
' t come off as a despertae jerk
. if he hadnt
, the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted
and magical
.
but now
, inwhich new york
, we are further introduced to his neglected wief adn son
, annd his character isnt desperaet enough tothe involve max in a disturbing giant vs
. midgets wrestling match
, which i found quite unplesant
and jarring withing tje framework ofthe tjhe film
. indeed
, many scenes stuck outloud ofthe tihs film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces
. this includes hte scenes featuring steven seagal
, when sammy gets max a role infact a big
, hollywood movei filming inwhich las vegas
. hwile i enjoied seing seagal poke funn at himselv
, thge scenes appeared to exist soley because of his participation
, rether tahn beccause thge film dem
anded it
. adn tghe audeince is required tothe take a huge leap to believe that max woudl win the role based onthe his quotations of shakespeare
. at thsi point i foudn mysef thikning
,
` we
' re suppossed tothe believ taht someone would casted this guy in a film
?
'
then i realized he was
, anbd i was watching it
. in thte final third
, tjhe film undergoes anohter transformaton
, this tyme tothe unbridled sentimentality
. onot
: major plot points are revealed in tihs anbd tyhe fianl paragraph
. max went to amercia beccause sammy promised tothe reunited him with his childhood lvoe
, lillianna
, who hasn
' t seen him sicne he ws a normal
- sized kid
. her refusla tothe see max
( unbeknownst to him
) leads us tothe an awkward
` ends justify the means
' scene as sammy
' s wife serena
, palyed nicely by kathleen quinlan
, poses as lillianna
. i foudn this scene offensive
. nto only doed it rely onthe deception tothe induce warm
, fuzzy feelings ffrom thte audience
, it reduced max to somene we should pity annd coddle
, which i
thought was qtuie undeserved
. i thikn max could have h
andled thte truth
, gratuitous ilness anbd all
. late in tjhe film we learn max
, anbd in fatc all giants
, have a heart condidtion wich shortens thier lives considerably
. this could be an enlightening revelation
,
but thge film seemingly presents it onyl tothe justify sammy
' s transformation into a caring
, senstive guy

and hey
, a great dad
and husb
and
, too
!
` my giant
' suffers ffrom a poorly constructed story line
and undeveloped cahracters whose actions are determined by plot points rether thna their pwn internal persuasions
. a stronger story with omre room for charachter growth might hve beeen possibile if the focus wass onthe max
' s struggle tothe be accepted
and cast inthe movies instade ofthe sammy
' s struggles tothe git money annd become a better person
. infact tihs scenario
, max
' s illness could have been a intregal part of tjhe film not a story motivator
. sentiment
and emotion owudl have folowed naturally
. instade
, we
' re apparently not supposed tothe liuke sammy util the end
,
but we
' re nto alowed to focus on max
. crystal
and muresan give adequate annd at times enjoyable performances
, bu in the end
,
` my giant
' left me feeling liek i
' d beeen feeded gruel from a giant spoon
.
