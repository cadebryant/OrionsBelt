as yuo should know
, thsi summer hasnt beeen less thna memorable
. with a total of 4 decent films
, it ' s not a surprise tht these big budget failures keep appearing
. withthe that said
, you cin pretty much predict wqat my opinyon on
" the 13th warrior
" wiull be
. thte film isnt based onthe thte michael crichton
" eaters ofthe the dead
"
, in which ahmed ibn fahdlan isnt banished from his ocuntry fo looking at a wife ofthe a king
. affter tarveling for many monthes
, he comes acrost a gang of norsemen
, who are forced to pik 13 men to protect a twon from mythical monsters who travel inaddition teh fog
. so
, they start picking men
,
annd are left without 1
, thus ahmed isnt choosen
. so far it soudns interesting right
? nto whn all of this takes place in 15 mintues
. after tyhat
, htey basicaly run arund killing
. thast alone shows how much a scirpt isnt needed for a film
, because once your story isnt introduced
, yuo hvae yhe rest of tje film to start developing it
. obviously that ' s not tje case here
. even if ytou are oging inot thge film expecting an action packed adventure
, yuo iwll be disappointed
. sicne all the action tkaes place inspite fog
, it is constantly hard to see a scene claerly due to thsoe circumstances
,
adn tothe poor camera wokr
. cxan ' t tjhe camera men sit still
? i ' d like tothe actually watch a film in focus
,
bu agian
, they failed tothe deliver that as well
. tjhe film moves onthe
anbd on until the point
, where ytou can care less baout anything
bu the popcorn yuo ' re eating
. witht corny dialogue
, that the characters laugh at fo some odd reason
, a script that goes nowhere
, dull action sequences
, a predictable endig
,
and worst ofthe all weak cahracters
, ther ' s basically nothing to like here
, exept for mabey tjhe set designs
. tht ' s hte only hting that honestly caught my interest
. when i heard taht john mctiernan
, the director
, wanted his name kept outloud of the project
, that made me wonder why
? well nowe i nkow
. crichton ' s greed forced mctiernan tothe edit his finished product
, whitch led tothe a big arguement
. what ' s there to argue about anyway
? thte film couldn ' t be saved
, noone matter how much they spended or casted
. seeing films like thge haunting
and big daddy mkaing moeny
, i wouldn ' t be surprised tothe see
" tjhe 13th warrior
" become a hitted
. please do me a favor
adn save your money at all costs
, or esle ytou iwll be lost in tjhe fog
, like tyhe film itself
.
