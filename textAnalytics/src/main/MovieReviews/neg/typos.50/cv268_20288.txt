as you should knwo
, this summer hasnt beeen less than memorable
. witht a total of 4 decent films
, it
' s nto a surprise that theese big budget failures keep appearing
. withthe tath said
, yuo can pretty much predict what my oppinion onthe
" tghe 13th warrior
" iwll be
. the film isnt based on the michael crichton
" eaters ofthe the dead
"
, in whcih ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his ocuntry forthe looking at a wief ofthe a king
. aftter tarveling forthe many months
, he comes across a gang of norsemen
, who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a twon fomr mythical monsters who travel inthe tje fog
. so
, htey strat picking men
, annd are left wihtout 1
, thus ahmed isnt choosen
. so far it soudns intresting right
? not whn all ofthe this tkaes place in 15 minutes
. after tyhat
, htey basically run aroud killing
. thast alone shows how much a scirpt is needed for a film
, becasue once your stoyr isnt introduced
, yuo have tje rest ofthe the film tothe strat developing it
. obviously thta
' s nto tyhe case here
. even if yuo are gogin into tghe film expecting an acation packed adventure
, you will be disapointed
. since all the acation tkaes palce inaddition fog
, it isnt constanly hard to see a scene claerly due tothe thsoe circumstances
,
and tothe poore camera owrk
. can
' t yhe camera men sit still
? i
' d liuke to actully watch a film inthe focuse
, bu again
, they failed to deliver tyhat as well
. tghe film moves onthe adn on util the point
, where you cant care less baout anytying bu the popcorn ytou
' re eating
. with corny dialogue
, that thte cahracters laugh at for some odd reason
, a scirpt that goes nowhere
, dull action sequences
, a predicatble ending
,
and worst ofthe all weak cahracters
, ther
' s basically nothing tothe liek here
, except forthe maybe tyhe set designs
. thyat
' s thte only hting that honestly caught my interst
. wehn i herad that john mctiernan
, tyhe director
, wanted his nmae kept out ofthe tje project
, that made me wonder why
? well nowe i nkow
. crichton
' s greed forced mctiernan tothe edit his finished product
, which led tothe a big arguement
. what
' s ther to argue baout anyway
? tyhe film couldn
' t be saved
, no matter how much they spended or casted
. seing films like the haunting
and big daddy making money
, i wouldn
' t be surprised to see
" the 13th warrior
" become a hit
. please do me a favor
and save your money at all costs
, or alse ytou will be lost inspite teh fog
, liek the film itself
.
