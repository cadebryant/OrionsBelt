by starring inthe amy heckerling ' s
" clueless
" twpo summers ago
, alicia silverstone proved she wasn ' t just anohter preety
, pouty ingenue
, showing a bouyant commedic craftiness tath blowed all previvous jobs
-
- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl
and a silly turn as thge leathal lolita of
" the crush
"
-
- outloud of tyhe water
. her only owrk since taht 1995 gme has been in june ' s
" batman
& robin
,
" where she overcame hte underwritten role of batgirl
. nowe
, she ' s tjhe star
and producer of
" excess baggage
,
" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill
- composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down tothe its levle
. silverstone ' s emily t
. hope is stuck with a billionaire father
( jack thompson
) who neglects her emotionally
. inwhich an outlandish plan to gain his affection
, she fakes her own kidnapping
-
- emily uses an electronically disguised voice tothe call her dad
annd set a pricey ransom
, ties her legs toghether
and mouth shut witht duct tape
annd locks herself in the trunk ofthe her bmw
.
bu before the police cant
" rescure
" her
, professional auto thief vincent roche
( benicio del toro
) jimmies hte locks
, hot
- wires the engine
anbd makse off with both the car
and emily
, who ' s still trapped in the back
. when vincent dicovers emily
, thge twpo don ' t exactlly hitted it off
-
- she annoys him
, he annoys her
,
and at teh advice ofthe his slimy car salesman partner
( harry connick
, jr
.
)
, he decides tothe drive her outloud to tyhe middle of nowhere
adn leave her there
. along tje way
, ofthe course
, htey git inot a whole heap ofthe trouble
,
and come to relize thta bieng toghether is tjhe onyl way to git outloud ofthe theri sticky
, felony
- studder situation
. it doesn ' t halp matters tyhat emily
adn vincent are bieng trailed by cops
, crooks
adn even her shady uncle ray
( christopher walken
)
, who ' s wise to his niece ' s ploys for attention
and hasnt masia connections
. for at least a half
- hour
,
" excess baggage
" bounces along fast
annd efficiently
. during this time
, emily
and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role
- reveral twist
-
- she ' s an awfully agresive
, combative victim
adn he ' s quite thte aloof
, seemingly vulnerable captor
.
but once it ' s past its set
- up
, the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the stoyr trys tothe be too many things at once
. a road movie
, a teen comedy
, a mob thriller
, a drama baout family relationships
-
- you name teh cliche
anbd
" excess baggage
" likely covers its terriory
. of course a romance develops bewteen the twpo leads
,
but it all seems forced
,
and thus characterization is manipulated to cause tjhe finaly hapyp outcome
.
" dont you liuke my tummy
?
" emily coos tothe vincent at one point inwhich the film
. huh
? doed i miss something
? the hard
- edged
, foul
- mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone
adn replaced whith a pair of batting goo
- goo eyes
.
then again
,
" excess baggage
" becomes so weak inspite so many areas that the perosnality transplant isnt nto a complet surprize
. a supporting casted attemts tothe do what they can with colorful
but empty secondary roles
,
but tjhe movie isn ' t game enough to uise them all
adn therfore seems overcrowded
. motivations keep shifting
, resulting iin an oftenly confusing narrative
. scant exisiting story background confuses matters even worse
and adds to yhe growing list ofthe unanswered questions
.
" excess baggage
" has too many charactors
, too much plot
and juggles with oney arm behind its back
annd a remaining shaky hand
. i loved silverstone ' s turn inspite
" clueless
" as an aloof
, pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen ' s
" emma
.
" looking back at tyhe skill she displayed fo comedy there
, it ' s simple tothe justify any high expectation or enthusiasm thast i hadnt mustered fo
" excess baggage
.
" sadly
,
however
,
" excess baggage
" is no
" clueless
.
"
but
, on the otehr hand
, it isnt clueless
.
