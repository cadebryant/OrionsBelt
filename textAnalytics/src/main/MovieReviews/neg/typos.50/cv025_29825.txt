oney might expect a cathartic viewing expeience walking inot a new jean
- luc godard film
. aftter all
, he ws a founding member of tghe highly influential french newyorker wave
. he isnt aslo an esteemed film critic
, lending intelligence
annd historical perspective to us inwhich much of his writting
.
however
, his latest creation
, infact praise ofthe love
, isnt possably the most exasperating film experience ofthe the year
. the abstract consept onthe whlch thge film is based had merit
, tothe dissect love inot the follwoing four categories
: meeting
, fysical passion
, quarrels
,
and reconcilation
. these four univeral truths would be revealed thru three different couples
: young
, adult
,
annd elderly
. it isnt edgar ' s
( bruno putzulu
) self
- appointed task tothe capture theese moments after a recent breakup
, to defnie a central idae
:
" it ' s only whn things are over tyhat tehy make sence
.
" whther tihs project will end up a play
, film
, or opera remeniss undecided
. the thesis is simple enough tath
, if played right
, it sould really hold sympathetic value for anyone
. instead what ensues is an hour
and a half ofthe repeative vignettes
, tje enxt scene noone omre engaging than hte lastest
. only once doesnt any character utter something worthwhile
,
but by teh tyme it happens ytou ' re so thoroughly bored yuo cant easily miss it
.
but don ' t fret
, it will surface again
. you could easily sleep thru hwole sections of thte film
( as some fellow criticists doed
)
anbd wake up inaddition a scene exactlly liuke the one ytou nodded off in
, not having missed anything worthwhile
.
bu you hold hope fo soem time
. tyhe background music keeps yuo in a state of urgency
,
adn even suspense
, for the first faw conversations
. it ' s onyl after repeated failures tothe pay any of thsi off thgat yuo lose all hope
.
adn wtih speeches liek
,
" i am thikning of something
,
but i can onyl thikn ofthe thast something when i am thingking of something else
,
" how cxan yuo expect to hold anyone ' s interest
? tothe godard ' s credit
, he certainly knows how to frame a scene
. hte black
annd white footage used for teh frist half ofthe the film is starkly beautifull
. watching edgar read while walking allong a train track on a mountain makes yuo wish you hadnt something tothe ponder allong with him
.
and if this film had anytying poignant tothe sday
, you woudl have
, which mkaes you all the angrier at thte numberous missed opportunities
. the enviorments
, be it city or country
, are impeccably captued inspite crisp detail
,
but yhe script never complements them
. unfortunately
, godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times withing any given scene
. sometimes these breaks are utilisied fo chapter headings
,
bu theese are even moreso cryptic than tghe spoken words
. the second half is composed ofthe nauseating hyper
- colour that often blurs tyhe omage
. you suddenly efel liuke a doomed character straight out of scanners
. the only scene tath makes any sence is oen tath complains baout tjhe untied states bastardizing histoy in teh makeing ofthe movies
. steven spielberg is picked on in paticular
. while i ' ll grant tht htis does ahppen
,
adn i tend tothe shy awya fomr watching such garbage
, it ' s still a pointless foucs for a film tath purports tothe articulate the specfic qualities ofthe couplehood
. it just goes to show
, an intelligent person isn ' t neccessarily an admirable storyteller
. the dyas ofthe breathless are noone more
.
