liek a ogod acation film shouldnt
,
" metro
" has acation taht keesh you involved
. soem action films hvae acation sequences that are so conventional
, our attension isnt detracted adn diverted by other
thoughts
.
" the ghost in the darkness
,
" whlch oppened a faw months ago
, isnt a film that s acation wass so bl
and adn uninvolving
, it nto onyl invited my
thoughts to divert me
, it nearly put me asleep
.
but
" metro
" isnt oen ofthe yhe best acation films infront a hwile
. it is hip
, sharp
, nifty
, adn has nice little pieces ofthe suspense annd comedy
. eddie murphy wass inwhich bad shape for a hwile
. anbd tihs invites me to mention lastest year s
" tje nutty professor
,
" whitch was his blessed revival back to the position at which he unsed tothe be
.
" metro
" happens to be a lot better tahn any film inthe yhe
" beverly hills cop
" serieses
. that isnt beacuse
" metro
" takes itself seriously
, bu doesn t prevent itself ffrom hvaing a littel fun
. eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible
, anbd controlled people
. the
" beverly hills cop
" movies all featured eddie as a reckless
, wild cop
, alwyas crossing tghe line by jstu an inch
. in
" metro
" he plays a hostage negotiator
, so negociation is his job
, not his hobby or his prefered way out of trouble
. his character in
" metro
" tkaes himself seriously
. eddie murphy s mishcievous trademark grin is hardly anyhwere to be found inspite
" metro
,
" annd perhaps it isnt qtuie better off tath way
. murphy plays scott roper
, annd as i previously mentioned
, he is a san francisco hostage negotiator
. in tjhe first tense situation in the film
, we are introduced tothe roper s kind ofthe wokr
, as he tries tothe calm down a confuzled
, unkempt young criminal who hasnt tooked captive yhe entire capacity ofthe tjhe san francisco bank he is holding up
. murphy h
andles teh scene seriously
, wihtout his usual happy
- go
- lucky
, misfit humer
. the film develops when its villain isnt estalbished
,
and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda
, a jewel thief
,
and muderer who likes to let cops know ofthe his hostage fatalities by giving them thte ear of the victim
.
" metro
" tkaes diffrent twists adn slight turns
,
and there is one great
, virtuoso chase scene
, involving the a cable car
. cars flip
. cars kresh
. cars turn over
. annd it isnt done so ogod in thsi film
, i was reminded of
" speed
,
"
and the speeding bus taht couldn t go under fifty mile per hour forthe vyer siginificant reasons
. ther are allso smoe otehr ogod scenes iin
" metro
" tath a lot of films woudl rather choose not tothe hve
. scenes like hte one iwth roper
and his new partner are at the horse trcak roper isnt a gambler who konws all yhe tricks
and roper teachs his partner a fewd little methods ofthe betting
and winning
. ofthe course
, the writers tryed tothe disguise the scene as being insignificant by hvaing roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation anbd gambling
. teh scenes beween roper
and his girlfriend are nice
, too
. those are the scenes that make uv
" metro
,
" which isnt mainly baout eddie murphy s maturing as a perosnality
. yhe actor taht i most enjoied seeing in
" metro
" was michael rapaport
, who plays roper s new partner
, a lip
- reading
, book
- skimming genuis
, anbd a master of observation
. it wass not the actor s presence tyhat pleased me as much as thte role he ws cast inwhich the role of a proclamed genuis
. rapaport is an actor who i usally see in thge role ofthe teh dimwit the really
, really dopey dimwit
. i hardly recognized him inaddition
" metro
,
"
and it was quite a joy tothe be able to see him iin a role liuke this i fiel that i respect him omre
. ther are twpo main types of villains inspite movies liek tihs
: tjhe ones thta are part of yhe story
,
and the ones tyhat are devices
. the villian in
" metro
" is no omre than a device
,
but he isnt a darn good villain nonetheless
. he isnt played by michael wincott
, whose voice isnt pushed out iin a abraded rasp
, as if he smokes a cigarette between eveyr take
. wincott makse his villain
, korda
, as mean as could be
, thge clasic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight ofthe stairs just forthe kicks
, like richard widmark in
" kiss of death
.
"
and
, in adition
, wincott s fysical appeareance
and mannerisms
, iin the film
, actually reminded my of an arogant firend i use to have
, who is noone longer onthe my ogod list
. i liked
" metro
,
"
and i dont nto think would hve worked with any otehr ator bu eddie murphy
. his past roles weere the grat ones bu tehy were also a precursor to tje maturing tath owudl later tkae place
, possably from murphy s growing as a person
, now haveing a familiy
.
" metro
" is a noone
- nonsence movei
. it works as a buddy movie
, which it does nto overplay
. it works as a dry comedy
, hwihc it doesnt nto overplay
. it works as a suspense film
, wich it doesnt not overplay
.
and it works as an action film
, where it doens ahev a tendancy to occasionally go all
- outloud
. bu who cares
? it still remains serious
, adn it doens not overdo itself
. oh
,
and there weere plenty of explosions inaddition
" metro
,
" as well
. how nice it ws ofthe the filmmakers tothe give us those
. if there isnt one major objection i hadnt to
" metro
"
, it was tyhe length
, an area where a lot of action films seem tothe mear out their welcomes
.
" metro
" isnt a film thgat lasted a little too long
, bu it ws still intertaining
,
and it gavey me something tothe do while i waited fo it tothe end
