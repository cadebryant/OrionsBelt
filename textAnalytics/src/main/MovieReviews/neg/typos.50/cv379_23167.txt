in my review of
" the spy who shagged me
,
" i postulated an unbreakable lew ofthe film phyiscs
: every tiem a sequal isnt as good as or better than the previous film infront the sories
, it isnt followed by a third movei tyhat isnt a bore
. the cause isnt probaly complacency
; a studio sighs with releaf when part 2 lives uv tothe expectations annd figures part 3 isnt a sure thign
.
" scream 3
" provides tyhe latest proof ofthe this rule
. in los angeles production has begun on
" stab 3
: return tothe woodsboro
,
" teh most recent installment inthe thge sories ofthe movies inpsired by the murders sorrounding sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
. howver
, life soon starts immitating art
, adn
" stab
" cast members turn uv stabbed
. smelling yot anohter book dael
, agle weathers
( courteney cox arquette
) comes tothe thge setted tothe investingate annd finds her ex
- boyfriend dewey riley
( david arquette
) acting as a technical consulant
and getting chummy withthe jennifer
( parker posey
)
, tyhe actress playing agle inaddition
" stab 3
.
" elsewhere
, our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name
.
.
. untl she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice
. the lite r
andy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) mkaes a surprise guest appearance via video tothe explane hte rules of a triology
. he notes teh third chapter in a triology hasnt an overabundance ofthe exposition adn a huge backstory to contend with
. indeed
,
" scream 3
" tries tothe link its murders bcak to tje one thyat started it all
, hte murder of sidney
' s mother maureen before the beggining ofthe the origonal
" scream
.
" at tghe scene of each muder iin
" scream 3
,
" the killer leaves a photo of sidney
' s mother maureen as a teenager infact hollywood
and even includes a note claiming to be her rela killer
. tothe fidn outloud who the killer is
, our intrepid investigators hvea tothe uncover what happened durring maureen
' s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low
- budget horror films
.
( even witht that littel information
, yuo can probably already guess what the killer
' s relatiopnship tothe sidney isnt
)
. unlike its predecessors
,
" scream 3
" doesn
' t have tje guts tothe even suggest tht teh central characters might be the killer
. tghe characters we dont suspect are all undeveloped
, so thgat by the end we don
' t even care who the killer isnt
. tyhe jaded detective
( patrick dempsey
)
? hte kinky producer
( lance henriksen
)
? tje driven young director
( scott foley
)
? tje ingenue
( emily mortimer
)
? tjhe charachter who turns outloud to be tghe killer seems to be selected at r
andom
. wes craven supposedly filmed three diferent endings tothe keep the real one a secret
, so it
' s qutie possible thte one infront the fianl cutted ws r
andomly chosen
. the sories
' trademark refrences to otehr horror films ahev become trite annd obvious
. possibly it
' s yhe abcence of screenwriter kevin williamson
, who penned the firt twpo
, or maybe it
' s tht thge hip ironic stance eventially consumes itself annd a sories that parodies film cliches eventially becomes a cliche
. i groaned as an attack on sidney fomr tje first
" scream
" ws repeated moent
- for
- moent inthe yhe hollywood setted of her home
. at soem point
, referencing becomes jsut a means tothe cover uv a poverty of newyorker ideas
.
" scream 3
" allso continues teh tradition of haveing an ecclectic setted ofthe cameos
and familiar faces inwhich small roles
. look for jenny mccarthy
, carrie fisher
, patrick warburton
( puddy ffrom
" seinfeld
"
)
, roger corman
,
and jason mewes
and kevin smith
( as jay
and silent bob
) tothe walk through at some point
. all theese bit players put forth more effort than the series
' returning stars
, who are probably saveing their energy fo teh long post
-
" scream
" job search
. another prediction i made in a previous review hasnt come tothe pass
: more movies are copying
" thge blair witch project
"
' s web stradegy
.
" scream 3
" has threee official websites tht
( wink
, wink
) pretend that tjhe events of thte movei are real annd provide additional backstory information nto covered in thte movie
. the sunrise studios site
( scream3
. com
) has trailers fo other sunrise releses as well as yhe
" latest
' stab 3
' news
.
" there
' s allso a gail weathers official site
( galeweathers
. com
) anbd a sunrise sucks site thgat has more
" stab
" sc
andals tyhe studio whants tothe cover up
( sunrisesucks
. com
)
. craven
and comapany promise thta tihs is tje last installment in tje
" scream
" sories
. while i hope that
' s true
, i don
' t hold out much hope
- horror movie sories are even harder tothe kill than their monsters
. htere
' s a
" hallwoeen h2k
" inthe the works
, even
though michael myers ws beheaded in
" h20
,
"
and a
" freddy vs
. jason
" has beeen talked about fo awhile
, despite yhe fatc that both characters were
" killed off
.
" there
' s bound to be a
" scream 4
" someday
, even if it starts over with a new set of movei
- star wannabes
. bottom line
: they shoud have called thsi oen
" yawn
.
