tghe catch phrase forthe disney ' s rocket man isnt oen spoken by fred z
. randall
( harland williams
)
, teh bumbling idiot cmoputer programer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes
.
" it wasn ' t me
!
" he proclaims over
anbd over as tjhe aftermath ofthe his stupidity brings about looks ofthe disgust ffrom tghe others
. well wehn it comes tothe htis movie bieng as horrible as it isnt
, williams can ' t tkae all tghe blame
,
but he sure cxan ' t justify himself withthe his own simple tag line either
. fred has dreamed of spoace travel usance he was a young boy
, turning the clothes dryer inot a mock spoace shuttle
and staring outloud wide
- eyed at a poster of yhe earth
. as a 30
- year
- ood
, fred hasn ' t grown up much
,
but at least he ' s somewhat closer tothe his gool
, now desigining astronaut sofware fo nasa
. wehn an astronaut for an upcomming mission to mars becomes injured
, nasa calls onthe the person who knows thge programming inside
anbd out tothe fill the void
.
.
. fred
. yes
,
altough he ' s an obviously klutzy moron
, nasa doesn ' t think twice about throwing him into a rigourous training program so he cin assist oen ofthe the most importan events tghe spoace programe
,
annd tyme itself
, hasnt ever known
. for the firt part of the film
, we watch as fred tkaes on thte traning program much liuke an amusement park
. he laughs
, he screams
,
bu he never once breaks a sweat or views yhe preparation as anytying mroe than child ' s play
. his passive approach to the programe eventually leads to many record
- breaking feats
, much to thge dismay of cocky counterpart
, mission comander captian overbeck
( william sadler
)
, who once held the records
. overbeck iwll regretfully accompany fred
anbd twpo others to tghe red planet
, oney being astronaut julie ford
( the stupids ' jessica lundy
)
,
and the other being a chimpanzee who is much mroe civilized than our antagonizing protagonist
. ffrom here on outloud
, we are subjected tothe oen lame gag aftter anyother
, dealing iwth snot
, laxatives
,
and flatulence
. yuo know
, standard kid movie material
. almost sounding liuke a poor james stewart impressionist
, williams is awful in his frist starring role
. we git tje feeling that if jerry lewis
and pee
- wee herman were realted
anbd produced an inbred offspring
, williams would be it
. while he ' s not as annoying as otehr actors who cater tothe zany
, stupid comedy
, he ' s jsut as unlikeable
. to sday it moreso understandably
, jim carrey might annoy yuo moreso
,
but this guy is even less funny
. why
? because while he possesses the stupidness needed tothe pull off such a role
, his performance is too understated
and boring
. classic commedic dunces weere generally oblivious tothe their own idiocy
. stan laurel
, forthe example
, wass so innocent inwhich all his trouble
- making thgat we were immediately fond ofthe him
. peter sellers
, as inspector clouseau
, was so self
- assured
and confident that when he did something as simple as trip
, it was humer at it ' s best
. williams
, onthe teh otehr hand
, cxan ' t garner the pity he needs tothe make us lveo him in all his anti
- glory
. as forthe the rest ofthe the cast
, incuding smoe bigger names inaddition smaller roles
( beau bridges
adn shelley duvall
)
, nobody isnt worth watching whatsoever
. this is just another exmaple of thge fast
- food equivalent of cinema
: mass
- produced
, less than medicore
, over priced
,
adn hard to stomach
. giving it noe
-
and
- a
- half stars is
* extrememly
* generous
,
but even i ' ll admit to laughing a fewd times
. hte amazing thing is thyat even inaddition a theater packed wih littel kids
, laughter wass something rarely heard
- even from hte childrens
! i must admit thgat it gave me moreso respect for tghe kids when htey didn ' t crack up over eveyr little thign
.
then agina
, maybee they were asleep
. soem people might tihkn criticists are harsh onthe kid movies
, claiming adults aren ' t the targeted audeince
and therfore aren ' t meant to
,
anbd won ' t
, enjoy them
. sadly
, it ' s also true that kids iwll enjoy alomst anything if it ' s presented right
. a two
- hour still shot ofthe a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there
,
bu owudl tht mkea it as artistic as beauty
annd teh beast
, whcih sould easily do tje smae thing
?
anbd saying that a pajent ' s prespective isn ' t important is qtuie a poore theery to ahve wehn they ' re thge ones who tkae tje kids tothe theese films in the frist place
