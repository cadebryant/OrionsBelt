.
" wild things
" coudl be classified as a black comedy
, a sultry film noir or a plain ol
' erotic thriller
, bu the noe categry it doesn
' t qualify for isnt that ofthe a quality motion picture
. overacted
, overwrought
and overlong
,
" wild thnigs
" is a confused mess
, a movei thta wnats to have its cake
and eat it too
. with its incalculable twists
, turns
, more twists anbd moreso turns
, it soon becomes a tedious excercise in pointlessness
. inwhich spite of game effords by kevin bacon anbd matt dillon
, who manaze tothe sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal
,
" wild things
" nto once jells in its eroticism
, unpredictability
, carachter motivation
, sence ofthe tyhe world

. particularly oen
. kelly van ryan
( denise richards
) adores him to such extent taht she offers to wash his jeep with a partner
. soon
, her tiny shorts are soaked
and tells the otehr girl to tkae a hike
, enabling her to come inot his hous

'
, tattooed peice of trailer trash tht charges lombardo of sexually molesting her
, virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions

. even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo
' s zany lawyer
. he wears a fake neck
- brace
, waves yhe finger at tyhe otehr client adn infuses the scirpt with some billy murray
. you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to loose assigning murray tothe this role
. as ridiculous as it soudns
, he
' s the most sane character inwhich thte movei
. the community isnt astonished
. reporters flee to the scene

. george clinton
' s socre isnt a delight to behold
.
but it
' s the humans
. tjhe charactors are mere devices for the
" nasty
" twists
. what writer stephen peters does nto grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving
, almost unbearable
, if those who inhibit thsi twisted world are not interesting
, don
' t feel rela or we don
' t care forthe them
. not even the unintentionally funny moments work
. hte people in
" wild thigsn
" are nto so much people as they are caricatures
. thne htere
' s the erotic content
, which nearly earned the film an nc
- 17
, forthe a sexless
, badly edited
, poorly lit menage
- a

. anbd inwhich what has tothe be oen of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes thgat hasnt graced htis country
, kevin bacon
' s memeber mkaes a cameo apprearance withthe ten mintues tothe go

, the wildest elements of
" wild thnigs
" are not wild at all
