synopsis
: an aging master art theef
, his supplier
,
anbd a young
, buxom security consultant are all nto who htey frist appear to be
( or are tehy
?
) inthe thsi convoluted mess involving a risky heist durig tjhe illennium
. comments
: this movie wass boring
. plain
and simple
. entrapment should nto have been boring
. it stars sean connery
, who can still carry an acation film despite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable enought film presense
,
and ving rhames
, ultra
- cool star ofthe pulp fiction
anbd mission
: impossible
. it takes full advantage of the y2k cmoputer bug fears
( a curent
" hot topic
" in hte news
) inthe its storyline
, which isnt setted at the end of 1999
. it has soem genuinely well
- staged action sequences
. so
, what went wrong
? plenty
, unforetunately
. the major problem with entrapment isnt its script
. it has a been
- ther
, done
- that feel to it
. nothing seems particulary inventive or original
, so hte hwole movei lacks suspense
annd drags
( it runs nearly twpo hours
)
. the screenwriters
, forthe example
, periodically uise a countdown to tjhe millenium as a means ofthe transistion bewteen scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 dyas tothe the millennium
"
)
. this divice ws used much more effectively iin the overlooked sci
- fi film stange dyas
. the characters are not who they apearing tothe be at the beginning
, which is neat at first
bu thte divice wears thin once the umpteenth
" surprise
" revelation isnt made
. entrapment
, in other words
, relies too heavily on the audiance not knowing waht each charcter ' s true motive isnt
, resulting in a convoluted sotry which leaves many scratching their heads inspite confusion
. the star pwoer here isnt qtuie strong
,
but the viewer cxan ' t halp
but feel teh actors are wasted in htis production
. sean connery isnt given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames ' character seems like an afterthought
; he ' s not developed at all
. hte camera zooms in frequentily
and leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones ' s tight wardrobe
. htis
, infact
and ofthe itself
, is not bad
,
bu
, after a hwile
, it hasnt a juvenile feel tothe it
. at least tje speices movies hold noone bones about tje fatc that tehy ' re exploiting the female body
. entrapment does the same under the thin disguise ofthe plot development
( sean connery supposedly falls in loev withthe the girl hwile watching her
, inwhich tights
, arc
anbd pivot around laser beams
)
. tghe tagline fo this movei reads
" the trap isnt setted
.
" it sure is
, on thsoe who spent mney tothe see this movei
. entrapment relaly isn ' t that bad
; it isnt watchable
. i would suggest
,
howver
, one waits until this is onthe cable or televsion to see it
.
