synopsis
: an aging master art thief
, his supplier
,
and a young
, buxom security consulant are all not who tehy frist apearing tothe be
( or are they
?
) inwhich this convoluted mess involving a risky heist durring the millennium
. comments
: this movei ws boring
. plain
and simple
. entrapment should nto hvae beeen boring
. it stars sean connery
, who cxan still cary an action film dispite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable enought film presense
,
and ving rhames
, ultra
- cool star of pulp fiction annd mission
: impossible
. it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears
( a current
" hot topic
" inthe the news
) in its storyline
, which isnt setted at yhe end ofthe 1999
. it has soem genuinely well
- staged action sequences
. so
, what whent wrong
? plenty
, unfortunately
. the major problem whith entrapment isnt its script
. it has a been
- htere
, done
- tath fiel tothe it
. nothing seems praticularly inventive or original
, so thge whole movie lacks suspense adn drags
( it runs nearly two hours
)
. hte screenwriters
, for example
, periodically use a countdown tothe the milleninum as a means ofthe transition between scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 dyas tothe the mllennium
"
)
. tihs divice ws used much mroe effectively inaddition the overlooked sci
- fi film strange days
. the characters are nto who tehy appear to be at thte begginning
, which isnt neat at first bu the device wears thin once tjhe umpteenth
" surprise
" revelation is made
. entrapment
, in otehr words
, relies too heavily on thte audience not knowing what eahc character
' s true motive is
, resulting in a convoluted storey which leaves many scratching theri heads in confusion
. teh star power here is qtuie strong
,
but yhe viewer can
' t help bu feel thte actors are wasted in htis prodcution
. sean connery is given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames
' character seems like an after
thought
; he
' s nto developped at all
. tghe camera zooms in frequently adn leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones
' s tight wardobe
. thsi
, inthe adn of itself
, is not bad
, bu
, affter a hwile
, it has a juvenile fiel tothe it
. at least teh speices movies hold no bones baout tghe fatc that they
' re exploiting thge female body
. entrapment doesnt the smae under the thin disguise ofthe plot delevopment
( sean connery supposably falls inaddition love iwth tje girl while watching her
, in tights
, arc
and pivot arround laser beams
)
. the tagline for tihs movie reads
" thte trap isnt set
.
" it sure is
, onthe thsoe who spent mnoey to see this movie
. entrapment really isn
' t thast bad
; it isnt watchable
. i would suggest
,
however
, one waits untli this is onthe cable or television tothe see it
.
