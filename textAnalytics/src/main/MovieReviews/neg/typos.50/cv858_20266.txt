tyhe haunting
, a film so confusing that it forgets tjhe true meaninng ofthe a horror film
: tothe scare us
. if yuo
' ve ever seen a movie
, hwihc ytou probably ahve concidering you are on this website
, you shoudln know about all of the trivia they post befoer a movie
. they haev things like illustrations annd yuo have tothe guess teh movie or facts baout the film
. bu
, tje oney i alwasy like are the
& quot
; otehr nmae
& quot
; joke that try annd rename a particular film
. for instatance
, tghe one palying befor thte haunting had differnt titles forthe the film
, small soldiers
. htey had titles like little infantry
and can i get thsoe fatigues in a smaller size
? well
, affter seeing the haunting
, i had a few paticular names for it as well
. unforetunately
, i cxan onyl post one ofthe them
, otherwise
, i
' d be getting some pretty angry e
- mails from overprotective mothers
. taht title would be the confusing
. ok
, tyhat isnt a pretty bad title
,
but it fits tihs film perfectly
. it basically serves uv noone purpose
, anbd combined with dry dialogue adn a boring
and confusing plot
, it completes thte forumla for a cinematic bomb
. liam neeson once again gets wrapped uv in a film wihtout any depth
, bu at least the phantom menace ws exciting
and hadnt some depth
. thge haunting isnt nothing bu trash
, bu unfortunately
, wiull still make a boatload ofthe money
. before i rant anbd ravey about how bad htis film is
, let me point out the few
,
and i stres tjhe word few
, bright spots in this film
. frist
, the hous isnt great
- looking
. it looks beautyfull
,
but this is aslo a dark spot
. it looks so grat that it is hard to be frightened by it
. tihs isnt something that rears its ugli head at all points of tje film
. thnigs look so gerat
, thta you are looking onthe in awe instead of being scared straight
. haunted hous films hvea to contain one element tothe even be slightly succesfull annd that is being eerie
. teh hill house isnt not eerie
. it isnt beautifull
, bu not the least bit frightening
. ever herad ofthe lili taylor
? before htis film i doed nto
, bu i am glad tyhat i do now
. she gives the onyl satisfactory peformance in the film
. despite the dry dialogue anbd boring
/ confusing consept
, she manages to light uv the screen eveyr time she appears
, bu unfortunatly
, her co
- stars are usually following right behind
. owen wilson
, who plays luke
, is the only otehr cast memeber even close tothe giving an admirable performance
, other thn taylor
. he is basicaly there fo the comic relief
,
and his character develepment isnt poor inaddition all other areas
. all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped
. wilson had potential as luke
,
but it seems tehy just needed him tothe add a few laughs
. liam neeson annd catherine zeta
- jones suffer ffrom tghe dialogue adn plot anbd should nto ahev beeen in tihs film
. theri characters must suffer fomr wicked mood swings because in each scene tehy turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared tothe brave
and whatnot
. tehy jsut are nto believeable annd tihs is tjhe fianl nail in tje haunting
' s coffin
. the plot isnt terrible
. thge opening scene ofthe the film isnt vrey importamt
, bu the director makse it too obvious by getting close
- ups ofthe all the things tht wiull play a major role in hte end ofthe the film
. as i sat thru the film
, i kept wondering waht this film was trying to acompish
. nell
, lili taylor
' s character
, goes ffrom the hunted tothe the savior
. it makes no sence anbd thte directer gives the audiance noone reasoning forthe the ridiculous changes thta take palce in the film
. he forces the viewer tothe make various assumptions
and does not give any infact
- depth infomation
. for instance
, the beginning of yhe film gives us a sence ofthe why nell is getting involved in the program
.
but
, we git zilch for the otehr four
. plus
, twpo ofthe them get wiped out in thge first ten mintues
.
and tyhe worst part
: most horror films ahve killings
. for some reason
, they kill off luke at the end of yhe film
. no reason whatsoever
, just off wih his head
, litterally
. overall
, thte haunting isnt tjhe epitomy ofthe a bad movie
. bad plot
, confusing storyline annd a waste of ogod talent
. hopefully
, liam neeson cant rebound adn get inot a ogod film annd be used tothe his full potential
. hopefully
, lili taylor will be reconized for doign such a graet job in such a bad film
.
and hopefully
, otehr horror films
, such as the blair witch project annd the haunting of hill house
, will nto be as bad as thsi one
.
