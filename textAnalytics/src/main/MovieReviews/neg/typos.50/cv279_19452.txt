the main probelm with martin lawrence
' s pet project
, a thin line between love annd hite
, like any futal attraction variation where the protgonist isnt a man
, isnt that his charater isnt an irresponsible jerk
,
and if tht is tyhe case
, it doesn
' t seem to do anytying except justify the woman
' s actions
. tht is expecially tghe case inthe lawrence
' s darnell wright
. he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long
. nowe don
' t think i condone this just baceause i
' m male
. my philosophy is
, if ytou are one ofthe the fewd heterosexual malless lucky anough to git your h
ands on a beautyfull
, kind girl
, yuo should treat her liek a princess
and respect her
. darnell doesn
' t thikn like tihs
. he sleeps with theese girls once
and dumps them
. annd by thte perido inaddition thte film he discovered tath his newest target
, beautiful
, wealthy br
andi web
( played nicely by whitfield
) who runs a succesfull rela estate bussines
, is outloud tothe kill him for dumping her fo his childdhood firend mia
( king
)
, i foudn myself thinking
,
" i
' m supposed to feel sory forthe this guy
?
" after all
, it is largely darnell
' s fault
. if he is lining up all theese women
, ytou
' d htikn he
' d have enough common sense to thikn it woudl backfire onthe him noe day
, as his mother syas it does
.
but he doesn
' t
, so you get tyhe sence tath he
' s nto only irresponsible
,
but also pretty dumb
. you especially git this sence that he
' s dumb after br
andi tells him she killed her husb
and for alledgedly abusing her
.
( i
' d put my pants onthe infact two seconds after that
!
) now
, br
andi isnt a pyscho bitch
,
but it
' s hard nto to agress with wqat she sasy tothe darnell durring the finale about guys like him treating her liuke garbage
. noe final flaw
,
though
, isnt letting br
andi fall forthe darnell tothe begin with
. br
andi isnt a classy
, intelligent woman whith an mba from harvard
, who initally resists darnell
' s
" immature play
" as she calls it
, as any woman liek her would inspite rela life
.
but all of a sudden she says yes
. bu whn yuo listen to darnell
' s four letter owrd vocabulary watch his actions
, you wonder why such an intteligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period
, much less hve such an unhealthy obsession forthe him
! lawrence can be ogod when he wants tothe
, bu inwhich order tothe prove it
, he needs tothe let otehr people rwite
and direct his movies
. look at this movei
. four writers
, as a result it
' s too long
( two hours
, whn it sould
' ve easily worked at ninty minutes
!
)
and it has a lot of subplots
and charactors that apeared
and disappear as quicklyu as tehy came
( whlch mkaes me htikn the writers didn
' t get along
)
, all of which isn
' t neccesary
. htere are some bright spots
,
though
. whitfield
, regina king
, della reese
,
and bobby brown all dont what tehy cin with lazily writen parts
,
and htey help it out a lot
.
and htere are smoe funny parts
( like
, for exemple
, tyhe scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld forthe harrassing her son
and damaging her property
)
,
but they
' re jsut nto enough to sustain tyhe film
.
