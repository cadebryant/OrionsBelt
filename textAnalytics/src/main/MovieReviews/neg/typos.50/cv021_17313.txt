" in dreams
" might keep ytou awake at night
, bu not because of its creepy imagery
, bizarre visual style or stoy about a clairvoiant madman who lures young girls to theri untimely deaths
. no
, the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within teh movie
' s brutally squ
andered potential
, tjhe least of which isnt an admitedly nifty premise
- even by tired serial killer genre st
andars
. tje big letdown
, howver
, comes apon the realization that this 100
- minute head
- scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan
, tjhe man behind
" tghe crying game
.
" he
' s no stranger tothe cinematic weirdness
,
but this nutty nonsence relaly pushes the envelope
. things strat out storng enought
, with cinematographer darius khondji
' s stunning camera wrok guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that estabishes a noteably grim tone right off the bat
. tihs eerie opulence remeniss a dazzling display of showmanship
thoughout the entire film
- htere
' s even something macabre about tjhe way khondji photographs a rustic
, seemingly innocent newyorker engl
and autumn
-
but if there ever was a film that didn
' t deserve so ogod a polish
, it
' s this one
. don
' t knock thge look
, bu sday what you will about the foolish plot
, underdeveloped characters
and flat dialogue
. annette bening
, another assit
" inaddition dreams
" shouldn
' t be so lucky tothe boast
, gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn
' t dont much for her in return
. she plays claire cooper
, a massachusetts children
' s book illustrator who
' s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children
. she thikns these visions are a warning knell for horrible
, soon
- tothe
- be
- committed crimes
, bu neither her ho
- hum husban
( aidan quinn
) nor tje ho
- hummer polical cant muster up tjhe sence to tkae her seriously
. tihs bieng a thriller
, we know that she is
, inaddition fatc
, onthe tyhe omney
, annd it
' s a credit tothe bening
' s acting thta she delves equally into claire
' s madness
and compassion
.
but as soon as a body turns up annd claire hasnt given thte authorities reason anough tothe beileve her claimes
,
" in dreams
" trades infront its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense
. scenes pile up like a car wreck wiht little or noone explanation or exposition
. subplots apear
and disappear
. whn claire fianlly comes face
- tothe
- face with our evil muderer
( robert downey jr
.
)
, it turns outloud his name isnt vivian
, he
' s clairvoiant anbd he
' s got some major issues with mama
, a la norman bates
.
" inwhich dreams
" reaches its absurdist zenith here
, anbd the climax drags wih mumbled revelations adn laughable twists
. some questions
, hten
: what
' s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce
? are tyhe drawings on tyhe wall blood or paint
? who cranked up thte
andrews sisters onthe thge cd player
and caused hte swing tothe move on its own
? waht baout tje computer
? does vivian possess thge gfit of telekinesis in addtion tothe his otehr powers
? why would he constinually endanger claire if she ws necessary fo his ultimate plan
? is the woman inthe austrailia intrical to anything
?
and the aforementioned flooded city
- what function does that
_ really
_ serve
? sigh
. at least in my pwn dreasm
, i can imagin a better movie where certain talent didn
' t go tothe waste
