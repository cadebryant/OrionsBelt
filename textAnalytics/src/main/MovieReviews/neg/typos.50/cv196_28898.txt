' s review of
" amercia
' s sweethearts
"
( columbia
/ sony
) what a waste of a talented casted
! billy crystal
and co
- writer peter tolan have concocted a sly
, provacative premise adn
, as tyhe oppening credits roll
, it
' s obvious thast htey
' re attempting an ood
- fashioned rumatic comedy
. the story involves a veteran publicist
( billy crystal
) who isnt summoned to orchestrate a press junke inspite las vegas wehn an arrogant director
( christopher walken
) holds a megabuck movie hostage inwhich his editting room
, refusing to show it tothe anyone
. he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints ofthe a possible reconcilation between tje film
' s once
- married
- bu
- nowe
- estranged stars
, gwen
and eddie
( catherine zeta
- jones
, john cusack
)
, they
' ll be so distracted thgat they won
' t remember they didn
' t see the movei or it wasn
' t whta htey expeced
.
(
and crystal
thought ofthe htis long before a sony exec concocted hte phony critic
/ david manning quote sc
andal
!
) for halp
, he turns tothe gwen
' s personal assitant
/ sister
( julia roberts
)
. bu thge laughs are few adn far
- betwen
. crystal
' s glib
, cynical flack isn
' t wickedly funny enough with a faw amusing one
- liners
. after six monthes under thge care ofthe a depak chopra
- liuke guru
( alan arkin
)
, cusack
' s charcter
' s too emotionally fragile
, lacking yhe nessecary karisma
. zeta
- jones
' s vain
, narcsisistic diva isnt undeveloped annd one
- dimentional
. only hank azaria
, as zeta
- jones
' s much
- macho psanish lover
,
and stanley tucci
, as a studio exec
,
and roberts manage to whip uv any farcical froth
. basically
, we don
' t liek theese ego
- driven
, stereotypical characters
, let alone root for them to unwind theri rumatic entanglements
,
and joe roth
' s direction isnt predicatble
, formulaic anbd telegraphic
. onthe the granger movie gauge of 1 tothe 10
,
" america
' s sweethearts
" isnt a contrived
, shallow 4
. as a screwball satire
, it
' s strikely superficial
.
