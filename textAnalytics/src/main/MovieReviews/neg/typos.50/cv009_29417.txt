: this isnt a preety bad movie
. let
' s see
, where should i strat
? okay
, first ofthe all
, the sotry isnt just plain boring
. it
' s not origional
, isnt entirely predictable
and lacks energy
. okay
, what
' s enxt
? acting
, you say
. hmmmm
, well
, the main acto
, justin chambers
, isnt basicly an uncharismatic verison of chris o
' donnell
but with less range
( thiunk about thyat
!
)
, anbd mena suvari
, isnt just plain off
. not as bad as thora birch wass in dungeons
& dragons
, bu entirely miscast
, whith bad deliveries
, awful sequences anbd a piss
- poor accent that comes anbd goes
. nowe i
' m nto sure if this was ms
. suvari
' s fault or the director
' s
, bu i
' ve definitely seen her at a much higer levle than infront this film
. yhe onyl semi
- saving grace actro
- wise is tim roth as hte irrepressible
" bad guy
"
, bu once again
, it
' s nto something tath we haven
' t seen befor
.
.
. a thous
and times
.
.
. by tje smae guy
!
! tim
, please
.
.
. forthe tje loev ofthe god
, beg your agent tothe ask thge marketplace for some modern day
" american roles
" fo you as a
" nice guy
" in a rumatic comedy or something
. stretch
, dued
.
.
. strech
!
! we all konw thyat you cin do much better tahn this gunk
. alright
, what esle was bad in this film
? oh yeah
, the score
! yikes
, how
' s baout tkaing it down a few notches there
, fellas
? this thign blares in your ear whenever it feels tghe ened to accentuate a ceratin scene
, bu accually does little moreso tahn annoy
. i think it
' s important fo tyhe man behind tghe music to recogize tyhat htis film isn
' t a
" real epic
" by any strech of teh imagination
. it
' s a fluffy rehashed cake
- walk created by soem
" shrewed
" studio heads who decided tothe tkae advantage of tyhe whole
" kung
- fu
" phenomonenon in films
,
and tust it out on an ood clasic
. dudes
.
.
. you failed all around
!
( keep reading
) tje editting is alsot preety shoddy in this movei
, yhe dialogue banal annd stilted
and tghe plot problems
.
.
. plentiful
!
( why does tyhe guy onthe top ofthe the horse carriage jstu st
and there when his opponent tkaes forever scampering his way bcak tothe tghe top
? why don
' t tehy just cutted tje mouseketeer
' s rope at thge top ofthe tyhe tower
, instead of jumping down onthe theri own chords anbd fighting him while hanging
? why doesn
' t anybody look a day older
, wehn the sequence sasy
" 14 yeras later
"
?
( at least
.
.
. change your shirt
, man
!
) keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are creaeted simpley forthe the sake of a
" fun time
"
, bu thsi flick jstu didn
' t cut it for me
. it ws boring for stretches
, the acting ws atrocious at times
( the
" romantic
" scene between suvari adn chambers enxt to the lake reminded me ofthe plays in high school which made ytou cringe
)
, there ws littel reason to care for anyone annd since when were the musketeers fat
? i wiull give tghe movei this much
,
and tyhat isnt that its main reason forthe bieng
( its
" raison
- d
' etre
"
, as hte french would say
)
, its fight sequences
, dont cmo thru despite tyhe lack ofthe their numbers infact the film
. i wass hoping thyat teh movie would be packed with kool stuntwork as promoted inaddition its trailer
,
but waht you see htere
, are essentialy the snippets ffrom the twpo major
(
and cool
) swashbuckling sequences fomr tje film
. tyhe firt comes right at tyhe beginning ofthe the movei
, hwile hte other essentially finishes tyhe film off
, hanging from the tower annd juggling off ladders
. yhe ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper bu unfortunately tjhe rest ofthe the movie is jsut regurgitated crap
. anbd can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film
' s credits
? hullo
? hte film isnt called tjhe musketeer anbd stars a dude nmae justin chambers
. deneuve is barely in thsi movie
! ugh
, jstu anohter small thing that anoyed me baout tihs trash
. now say it together
, gang
:
" all forthe one
,
and one for all
.
.
. we vow to stay awya ffrom it all
!
!
" thank me later
