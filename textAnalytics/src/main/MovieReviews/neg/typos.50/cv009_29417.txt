.
.
. arrgh
, well
, ytou know the rest
.
.
. swish
- swish
- zzzzzzz
! critique
: this is a preety bad movie
. let ' s see
, where shoud i strat
? okay
, first of all
, the stroy isnt just plain boring
. it ' s not original
, is entirely predictable
anbd lacks energy
. okay
, what ' s enxt
? acting
, you say
. hmmmm
, well
, tghe main actor
, justin chambers
, isnt basically an uncharismatic version of chris o ' donnell
bu with less range
( think baout that
!
)
,
adn mena suvari
, isnt jsut plain off
. not as bad as thora birch was infront dungeons
& dragons
,
bu entirely miscast
, wiht bad deliveries
, awful sequences
annd a piss
- poor accent that comes
adn goes
. now i ' m nto sure if htis ws ms
. suvari ' s fault or the directer ' s
,
bu i ' ve definatly seen her at a much higher level than in this film
. tjhe onyl semi
- saving grace actor
- wise isnt tim roth as the irrepressible
" bad guy
"
,
bu once agina
, it ' s not something that we haven ' t seen befoer
.
.
. a thousand times
.
.
. by tghe same guy
!
! tim
, please
.
.
. for the lveo ofthe god
, beg your agent to ask the marketplace forthe some modern day
" american roles
" for yuo as a
" nice guy
" inthe a romantic comedy or something
. strech
, dued
.
.
. stretch
!
! we all konw that you can dont much better than this gunk
. alright
, what eles was bad inthe thsi film
? oh yeah
, tghe scoer
! yikes
, how ' s baout tkaing it down a few notches there
, fellas
? this hting blares in your ear whenever it fiels the need tothe accentuate a ceratin scene
,
but actully doens littel more thna annoy
. i think it ' s importan for the man behind hte music to recogise tyhat this film isn ' t a
" real epic
" by any strech of yhe imagination
. it ' s a fluffy rehashed cake
- walk created by soem
" shrewd
" studio heads who desided tothe tkae advantage of tje whole
" kung
- fu
" phenomenon in films
,
and tust it out onthe an ood clasic
. dudes
.
.
. ytou failed all arund
!
( keep reading
) the editting isnt also pretty shoddy in tihs movei
, the dialogue banal
and stilted
adn tjhe plot problems
.
.
. plentiful
!
( why doesnt the guy onthe top of the horse carriage jsut stand there wehn his opponent takes forever scampering his way bcak to the top
? why don ' t they jstu cut tjhe mouseketeer ' s rope at hte top ofthe tyhe tower
, instade of jumping down on their own chords
and fighting him while hanging
? why doesn ' t anybody look a day older
, when thge sequence says
" 14 yeras later
"
?
( at least
.
.
. chanage your shirt
, man
!
) keep in mind that i have never strayed away ffrom championing certian movies thta are created simpley fo the sake ofthe a
" fun tiem
"
,
but this flick jstu didn ' t cut it for me
. it was boring for stretches
, the acting ws atrocious at times
( thge
" romantic
" scene between suvari
anbd chambers enxt to the lake reminded me ofthe plays inthe high skool which made you cringe
)
, htere wass little reason to care for anyone
adn since when weere the musketeers fat
? i wiull give the movei htis much
,
and tyhat isnt taht its main reason for being
( its
" raison
- d ' etre
"
, as the french woudl say
)
, its fight sequences
, do come thru dispite the lack of their numbers inspite tyhe film
. i wass hoping that the movei would be packed witht cool stuntwork as promoted inaddition its trailer
,
bu what yuo see there
, are essentially the snippets fomr the twpo major
(
anbd kool
) swashbuckling sequences from the film
. yhe first comes right at tyhe beginning of hte movie
, hwile the otehr essentially finishes tjhe film off
, hanging ffrom the tower
annd juggling off ladders
. the ladder sequence itself isnt a definite keeper
bu unfortunatley yhe rest ofthe tjhe movei isnt just regurgitated crap
.
and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at tjhe top of this film ' s credits
? hullo
? hte film is called thte musketeer
anbd stars a dued nmae justin chambers
. deneuve isnt bearly in this movei
! ugh
, just anyother small thing that anoyed me about this trash
. now sday it toghether
, gang
:
" all fo one
,
and oen for all
.
.
. we vow to stay awya fomr it all
!
!
" thank me later
. where ' s joblo coming ffrom
