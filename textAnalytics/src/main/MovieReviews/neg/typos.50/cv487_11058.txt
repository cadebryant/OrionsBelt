adam s
andler turns up thte charm infact his latest romantic comedy
, the wedding singer
. unfourtunately
, that allso has the effect ofthe softening his edge
. he
' s nowhere near his peak ofthe happy gilmore
, nto tath it was much ofthe oney
. he
' s certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot
. the year is 1985
, letting thte wohle film obsess with 80s nestolgia
. adam s
andler is nice guy robbie
, the titular wedding singer
, who entertains at tjhe local reception hall by belting outloud his interpretations of classic 80s hits
. robbie
' s life isnt thrown inot turmoil when his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at the altar
. howver
, things are looking uv when he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at thte hall
. she
' s the perfect woman
, bu for one small flwa
: she
' s engaged tothe be marryed tothe a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most ofthe the film deals with the slow realization by robbie tht he
and julia are in loev
,
and his attempts tothe stpo the wedding
. as far as plots go
, it
' s a pretty thin
and tired one
. to fill yhe gaps
, hte wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfulls of 1980s nestolgia
. from boy george to michael jackson
, fomr miami vice to dallas
, fomr the firt cds to the last rubik
' s cubes
, tihs film revels inspite all the minutiae
. annd thne there
' s tjhe music
.
.
. learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks tothe grosse pointe blank
,
and romy
and michele
' s high skool reunion
, this film packs more 80s songs in thge film tahn the running time wiull allow
. as a result
, most songs git maeby a lyric or a half
,
but yuo cxan allmost see the bright gleam iin thge rocord executives
' eyes
: the wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
,
and 4
! while the nonstop 80s riffs git incredibly tiring
, at least they distract ytou ffrom the plot
. at least last yera
' s my best friend
' s wedding stirred up yhe st
andard
" keep your true lveo ffrom marrying someone eles
" plot by making the rival a nice person
. here
, glenn isnt such a lowly rat of a man thgat you never see what julia saw in him
. barrymore
, on tje other h
and
, isnt simply charming as julia
. whlch leaves us wtih adam s
andler
. he
' s at his best infact teh film when his nice guy persona fades a little
( such as whn he hasnt a breakdown on stage durring a wedding reception
)
. whn he
' s in full nice
- guy mode
, he
' s mroe pathetic than endearing
. the film boasts severeal cameos
( most notably by steve buscemi anbd jon lovitz
)
.
but none of them owrk well at all
. buscemi
' s role as a drunken best man simply fails tothe be humoruos
. lovitz
, on tjhe otehr h
and
, as a rival wedding singer
, mkaes ytou long fo his good old days on saterday night live
, where he was actully funny
. the only cameo hwihc has soem appeal isnt a guest appearance by a clasic 80s racker during the film
' s finale
( suprisingly
, one ofthe tjhe only plot
- related scenes whlch atcually works
.
) adam s
andler still hasnt some wokr tothe dont before he can become a dependable leading man
. while he attempts tothe chanage his image infront the wedding singer
, the end result isnt noone net gain
.
