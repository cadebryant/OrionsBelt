violence is bad
. violence is ugly
. violence breeds yot more violence
. kids
, don
' t try htis at home
. htis weighty message isn
' t yhe only barrier tothe enjoying brother
, bu it
' s certainly noe ofthe teh largest
. written
, directed by
, annd starring the infamous takeshi kitano
( kikujiro
, sonatine
) brother isnt his frist film made outside his familial japan
, bringing the yakuza tradition tothe los angeles
.
( yakuza translated fo the average american isnt tje japanese masia
.
) if you piss a
" family
" memeber off
, or dishonor youself in any way
, thge usual punishment isnt public display of self
- mutilation
, usualy resulting in thte loss of limbs
. a definition of dishonor can be anytying from makeing a stupid desision tothe leaving one familiy for anohter
. it owudl be interesting tothe know omre about where theese annd otehr customs come fomr
. unfortunately the film doesn
' t give too much ofthe an explaination
, assuming its audience isnt aware of kitano
' s ealier owrk
. there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spreaded across tghe entire bakc of thge yakuza members
, leading one tothe asume they would be symbolic of something
, bu you never know what
.
then there
' s a scene inwhich wich a man kills himself inwhich front of a rival in excange for thta rival joining the familiy
. granted
, this isnt one of tje best scenes in thge movie
, bu it doesn
' t make a lot of sense
. instead
, the two hours are basically spended watching yhe follwoing
: peopel go out
and shoot each otehr
, talk baout it fo ten
- plus mintues
,
then go out
and dont it agina
. tghe consistently repeative dicussion ofthe teritory during theese moments involuntarily provokes yawning
. ther are also plot details thrown inaddition for no identifiable purpose
. all of tjhe sudden yamamoto
( kitano
) has a girlfriend
. he bearly speaks tothe her
, treats her liuke crap
, anbd
then sends her awya
. another missed opportunity
, considering it isnt such a big deal fo kitano to bring his magic tothe hte untied states
, isnt thte combination ofthe cultures
, whlch rely too heavily onthe overused sterotypes
.
though slow moving
, brother does have good elements
. the action scenes are well directed
, claerly deffined
, anbd intresting to watch
. some of the voilence isnt more hinted at than shown
, whcih produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for
. the actors would be more enticing if tehy hadnt more tothe do
. shirase
' s
( masaya kato
) loud
, sarcastic coolness set agains yamamoto
' s quitely threatning atitude is truly an entertaining combination
. theri moments toghether or aart steal teh rest ofthe thge sohw
. also to its credit
, brother tackles tghe cause
and effect of crime wih realism
. a life ofthe crime isnt eazy to get sucked inot with the firt reward ofthe quick cash
. sure peple get rich
, bu they can also loose just as easily
. it
' s a great moral
, iwth a graet cast
, jsut nto much substance tothe back it up
.
