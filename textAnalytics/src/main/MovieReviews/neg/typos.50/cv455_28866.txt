voilence isnt bad
. violence isnt ugly
. violence breeds
yot more violentce
. kids
, don ' t try this at hmeo
. this weighty message isn ' t the only barrier tothe enjoying brother
,
but it ' s certainly oney ofthe the largst
. writen
, directed by
,
anbd starring thge infamous takeshi kitano
( kikujiro
, sonatine
) brother isnt his frist film made outside his familial japan
, bringing the yakuza tradition tothe los angeles
.
( yakuza translated for the averege american isnt tje japanese mafia
.
) if you piss a
" familiy
" memeber off
, or dishonor youself in any way
, tyhe usual punishment is publich display of self
- mutilation
, usualy resulting in the loss of limbs
. a definitoin of dishonor can be anytying ffrom makeing a stupid decission to leaving one famaly fo another
. it would be interesting to know more about where theese
and other customs come ffrom
. unfortunately the film doesn ' t give too much ofthe an explaination
, assuming its audience isnt aware ofthe kitano ' s earlier owrk
. htere are several shots that focus specifically onthe detailled tattooes that spread across tjhe entire back of thge yakuza members
, leading oen to assume they woudl be symbolic of something
,
but yuo never know wqat
.
then there ' s a scene iin hwihc a man kills himself in front of a rival in excange for that rival joining tjhe familiy
. granted
, htis isnt noe of tjhe best scenes iin the movei
,
bu it doesn ' t amke a lot of sense
. instead
, teh two hours are basically spended watching yhe folowing
: people go outloud
anbd shoot each otehr
, talk baout it forthe ten
- plus minutes
,
thn go out
annd do it agian
. tyhe consistently repetitive discussion ofthe teritory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning
. there are also plot details thrown infront forthe no identifiable purpose
. all ofthe thte sudden yamamoto
( kitano
) hasnt a girlfriend
. he barely speaks to her
, treats her like crap
,
and
then sends her awya
. another missed opprotunity
, concidering it isnt such a big deal for kitano tothe bring his magic to thte untied states
, isnt tyhe combination ofthe cultures
, whihc rely too heavily onthe overused sterotypes
.
though slow moving
, brother doesnt haev ogod elements
. the acation scenes are well directed
, clearly defined
,
and interesting tothe watch
. some of the violence isnt more hinted at thna shown
, whlch produces teh luscious squirm tht oney goes to see such films for
. the actors owudl be moreso enticing if htey had omre tothe dont
. shirase ' s
( masaya kato
) loud
, sarcastic coolness setted againnst yamamoto ' s quietly threatning attitude is truly an intertaining combination
. theri moments together or apart steal the rest ofthe the show
. alsot tothe its credit
, brother tackles the cause
anbd effect of crime with realism
. a life of crime isnt eazy to get sucked inot wtih tjhe firt reward ofthe quick cash
. sure people git rich
,
but tehy can also loose just as easily
. it ' s a gerat moral
, with a great casted
, just nto much substance tothe bakc it uv
.
