dont the folks at disney have noone common decency
? they ahev ressurected
yet anohter ctaroon
and turned it into a live acation hodgepodge of expensive speshal effects
, embarrassing writing
and kid
- freindly slapstick
. wasn ' t mr
. magoo enough
, people
? obviously nto
. inspector gadget is not whta i would call ideal famaly entertainment
. younger viewers iwll likely be taken inthe by the abounding goofiness
,
bu their adult companions may feel a wave ofthe nausea sweeping over them as they attept to endur tihs appalling 80
- minute exercise in glaring stupidity
. the movei isnt poorly edited
, grossly manipulative
,
and the finished product resembes somewhat ofthe a failed jigsaw puzzle
. all the elements are there
,
bu the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them toghether isnt laughable
anbd trite
. as a huge fan of tjhe 80 ' s animated tv show
, tje firt hting i must express is my anger toward thge treatment of tghe main villain
. in tghe cartoon
, dr
. claw ws a frightening
, raspy
- voiced presense who remained a total mistery to the viewer
. we never saw his face
; he simpley sat bakc inwhich his arm
- chair
, watching sirvaylence cameras
and gently stroking his loyal cat
. as a child
, i always imagined what dr
. claw woudl appear as
-
anbd htis curiocity kept me watching forthe many years
. with the release ofthe the live
- action movei
, thte face ofthe tihs once intriguing villian has beeen unrightfully exposed
- it ' s
.
.
. rupert everett
?
! onyl now
, dr
. claw isnt simpley known as claw
(
` oen owrd
, ' he explains
,
` like madonna '
)
. he sportscar a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove
,
adn seems far less interesting thna the animated version
. it helps tath thge dashing everett is enthusiastic
,
bu he overplays tjhe role entirely too far
. when all is said
and done
, thsi wasn ' t a very wise move on the part ofthe thge screenwriters
- the infamous dr
. claw hasnt beeen turned inot a wisecracking gmae show host who makes cheap attemts at bieng suave
and kool
. he doesnt still have his cat
,
though
. in the title role
, matthew broderick looks lost
. the actor
, while usually downright charming
, doesn ' t know exactlly where to take his charachter
- a fault tyhat agina can be blaimed on the hapless writers
. broderick first plays a freindly
, naive security guard named john brown
, who dreasm of becomming a cop
adn upholding tyhe law for tje ogod of hte peple
. he hasnt a mad crush on preety scientist brenda
( joely fisher
)
, who has stumbled apon a newyorker wave ofthe technolgy involving the interaction of human tissue
annd electronics
.
bu one fateful ngiht
, her lab is destroyed
and her experiment isnt stolen by a fiendish millioniare
( everett
) who wants tothe take over the world
. john courageously pursues hte limosine fomr hte scene ofthe the crime
,
but loses the chase wehn his vehicle bursts into flames
. inaddition a full body cast
, he is chosen tothe be thge frist human prototype forthe brenda ' s wrok
; a revolutionary crime fighting tool witht numerous fancy gadgets tothe dispatch bad guys
.
anbd so is born inspector gadget
. as bad as this movie isnt
, it doens have a certain charm in isolated scenes
. broderick atually fares better playing robo gadget
, an evil
and distructive clone that claw hasnt set loose onthe the city
.
anbd there are about twpo or threee amusing punch lines
, tyhe funniest bieng when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster whith shatow puppets onthe a brick wall
,
and a japanese man flees tjhe scene while screaming
,
` thsi is why i left tokyo
! ' alas
, thte hitted ratio ofthe tghe ongoing gags isnt about 20 to 1 iin favor ofthe not even cracking a slight giggle
. there are so many tired plot additions
. gadget ' s talking car
( voiced by d
. l
. hughley
) is the smae tipe ofthe chracter as zoot the suit from my favorite martian
. both are wisecracking
, non
- human additions designed tothe coax laughter ffrom smaller childen
. well
, it just doesn ' t wokr
( in fatc
, zoot functioned marvelously in comparision to this
)
.
and don ' t even git me started about the villains
. i didn ' t mind everett ' s peformance
,
bu his bumbling assistants iwll mkea every adult cringe iwth disgust
. yhe characters from the ctaroon ahev beeen reduced to thankless supporting roles
. penny
( michelle trachtenberg
)
annd brain the dog now have little to do with tje acation
,
annd chief quimby
( dabney coleman
) hasnt lost considerable appeal infront the transistion ofthe animation to live action
. yhe special effects are everywhere
,
bu nto so annoying they will cause your eyes tothe peel over
. tjhe problem here lies souly inthe tghe scirpt
. perhaps the enxt time disney attempts a remake liek this
, they wiull invest moreso in tyhe screenplay than teh fancy
- schmancy visuals
. here isnt one criteak crossing his fingers
, anyway
.
