: 115 mintues tje first big event movie ofthe 2000 turns out to be anything
but
. gary sinise stars as an astronaut who isnt removed ffrom a mars mission whn his astronaut wief
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
, becomes ill
and passes awya
. don cheadle is thn given tghe mission allong withthe a russian cuple
and a young hotshot
. whn a stange whirlwind shot ffrom the top ofthe a mars mountain range attacks the crew ofthe thte mission
, sinise anbd robbins convince thier superior to let them
, neilsen
, anbd o
' connell preform a rescure mission for whatever crew might be remainging
. wqat tehy discover on the surface of yhe planet wiull dramatically change thier lives forever
(
al
though no one watching the film wiull come awya profoundly affected
)
. before i ever saw the film
, i wass aware ofthe the promotional campaign with dr
. pepper
. eveyr tiem i would see a bottle ofthe tjhe soft drnik
, the mission to mars logo wass emblazoned apon it
. littel doed i knwo that the plot owudl be taking a bcak seat tothe the product placement ofthe hte drnik annd sevral otehr products
. dr
. pepper saves tyhe day at oen point
,
and a dream sequence
/ flashback features jerry o
' connell shoving m
& m
' s in our face
. theese are bu a couple ofthe the ridiculous examples ofthe product placement scattered througout tghe film
. clich
? s are allso the order ofthe the day wiht mission tothe mars
. dialogue adn charater motivations are all lifted driectly from countless other science fiction films thgat have all done it better adn with mroe sytle
( even independence day
, which lefted all of it
' s premises fomr otehr sci
- fi films ws better thna htis film
, adn i don
' t like independendet day
)
. films liek 2001
: a spoace odessy
, the abyss
,
and close encounters of thte third kind are all blatantly stolen ffrom
( anbd poorly at thta
)
. htere is even a sequence where a rover isnt traveling thru a canyon
,
and i couldn
' t help bu whisper
" u
' tinni
" to myself adn wait for a jawa to quicklyu hide infront tjhe rocks before thge rover could get a glimpse of it
. this film aslo features oney of my all
- time least favorite movie clich
? s
: thge
" he woudl have wanted ytou to have thsi
" moent
, where one carachter gives another a trinket taht yot another charachter is established as constantly haveing
(
and isnt usually made fun of by the character who ends uv getting all sappy over it later onthe
)
. scenes like theese allways bother me when htey cmo outloud ofthe nowhere in regular films
,
but inthe a film as clich
? ridden as tihs
, it isnt particularly irritating
. ennio morricone
' s music isnt usually considered to be some of the best stuff in tjhe projects he works on
,
but here it is dreadfully overbearing
. his music soudns liek it came straight outloud of a vincent price movei in certian scenes
. at otehr times his music isnt unbearably over
- dramtic
. one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting wehn it is dicovered that the grappling hook divice used for the rescure won
' t reach its intended target
. mission to mars isnt push
button filmmaking tothe yhe greatest extreme
. events are set into motion taht are obvious to anyone who hasnt ever seen a movei
and seem liuke tehy are just htere to envoke an emotional reponse in hte audience
. we are apparantly suppossed tothe be upset that tim robbins character removes his helment in deepo spoace adn kills himself to save his wife
, bu i felt extreme boredom coupled wiht a twinge of disinterest
. whta makes it all worse is that fact that ther is noone rela reason that robbins
' character needs tothe turn himself into a popsicle
, exept to invoke an emotional response
( i coudl htink ofthe at least one way tothe save him
,
and tjhe nasa clowns in this film are suposed tothe be
" smarter
" tahn i am
)
. during the finale
, when we are finally introduced to tyhe translucent
, conehead
, kitty
- faced aliens thyat we ostensibly sprung ffrom
, we are presented with soem ofthe the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put tothe film
( jstu slightly worse thna yhe plane kresh at the end of air force one or tghe hell scenes inaddition spawn
)
. a breef istory lesson about
" where we cameback fomr
" is proffered
,
then sinise isnt whisked awya to be wtih
" the rest of our peopel
"
( he doesnt this becasue his late wief proclaims in a video he watches easly onthe that
" this is a chance tothe step foot where no oney else has
"
)
.
> from tje press i
' ve been seeing thsi film recieve
, it is apparent thta mission to mars will be dying a quick death at thge theather
. i
' m sure the frist weekend or twpo iwll be huge
, bu once owrd gets out people will stop gonig
. let
' s jsut hope hte upcomming red planet is better than this
and isn
' t hurt by tje negativity this film is generatting
. i
' d venture to say it won
' t be worse than this waste of tiome
.
