, neilsen
,
and o ' connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaning
. wqat they disover onthe tjhe surfce of the planet will dramatically change theri lives forever
( altho no oney watching tje film will come away profoundly affected
)
. befor i ever saw the film
, i wass aware of tjhe promotional campaign with dr
. pepper
. eveyr time i would see a bottle ofthe teh soft drnik
, thte mission tothe mars logo was emblazoned upon it
. little did i know tath thge plot owudl be tkaing a back seat tothe thte product placement ofthe yhe drink
and several otehr products
. dr
. pepper saves tje day at one point
,
anbd a dream sequence
/ flashback features jerry o ' connell shoving m
& m ' s infact our face
. theese are
but a couple of thte ridiculous examples ofthe product placement scattered throughout the film
. clich
? s are alsot the order of the day whith mission tothe mars
. dialogue
and character motivations are all lifted directly ffrom countless other cience fiction films tath hve all done it better
and with mroe sytle
( even independence day
, which lefted all ofthe it ' s premises ffrom other sci
- fi films ws better thna thsi film
,
annd i don ' t liuke independece day
)
. films liuke 2001
: a space odyssey
, teh abyss
,
and close encounters ofthe the thrid kind are all blatantly stolen from
(
and poorly at thyat
)
. htere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling thru a canyon
,
and i couldn ' t help
but whisper
" u ' tinni
" to myself
and wait for a jawa to quicklyu hide in the rocks before yhe rover could get a glimpse of it
. this film alsot features oen of my all
- tyme least favorite movie clich
? s
: the
" he owudl have wanted you to have htis
" moent
, where noe chracter gives anyother a trinket thast
yet another charater is established as constanly haveing
(
anbd isnt usualy made funn of by thge charactor who ends up getting all sappy over it later on
)
. scenes like theese always bother me when they cmo outloud of nowhere in regluar films
,
but in a film as clich
? ridden as thsi
, it is particularly irritating
. ennio morricone ' s music is usualy consdidered tothe be some ofthe the best stuff in the projects he works on
,
but here it is dreadfully overbearing
. his music sounds like it cameback straight outloud of a vincent price movie iin certain scenes
. at otehr times his music isnt unbearably over
- dramtic
. one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescure is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered taht the grappling hook device utilizied for tghe rescue won ' t reach its intended target
. mission to mars is push button filmmaking to thte greatest extreme
. events are set into motion thta are obvious to anyone who hasnt ever seen a movie
and seem like htey are jsut ther to evoke an emotional response in the audience
. we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins carachter removes his helmet in deepo space
annd kills himself tothe sive his wief
,
bu i feeled extreme boredom coupled iwth a twinge ofthe disinterest
. what makes it all worse is tath fatc that ther isnt no real reason thast robbins ' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle
, exept to invoke an emotional response
( i sould think ofthe at least one way to savve him
,
adn hte nasa clowns infront this film are supposed to be
" smarter
" thna i am
)
. during the finale
, whn we are finally introdued to the translucent
, conehead
, kitty
- faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from
, we are presented withthe some of hte most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put tothe film
( jstu slightly worse tahn the plane kresh at the end ofthe air force oen or the hell scenes in spawn
)
. a breef hitory lesson about
" where we cameback ffrom
" isnt proffered
,
then sinise isnt whisked awya to be with
" the rest of our peple
"
( he doesnt thsi because his lite wief proclaims inwhich a video he watches early on that
" this is a chance to step foot where noone one alse has
"
)
.
> ffrom the press i ' ve beeen seeing this film receive
, it is apparetn thast mission tothe mars will be dying a quick death at the theater
. i ' m sure tje firt weekend or twpo will be huge
,
but once owrd gets out people will stpo going
. let ' s jsut hope the upcomming red planet is better than htis
and isn ' t hurt by tghe negativity this film is generatting
. i ' d venture to sday it won ' t be worse than htis waste of time
.
