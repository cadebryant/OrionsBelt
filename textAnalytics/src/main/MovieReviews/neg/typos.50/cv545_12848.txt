thsi movei about two disfunctional fimilies never really gets off thge ground
, dispite some ogod performances from a basicaly competant casted
. eddie
( sean penn
)
and maureen
( robin wright penn
) are a not
- so
- happily marryied cuple down on their luck
. living infront rented rooms inaddition the seedier part ofthe an unnamed city
, htey spend waht littel income htey hvae at thte local bar
, owned by shorty
( stanton
)
, eddie
' s best freind
,
and his wife georgie
( mazar
)
. maureen anbd eddie share an odd relationship maked by eddie
' s frequent disappearances
. onthe his return
, he promises her thte world
and professes his undying love
. their manic reunions all too soon lead tothe newyorker lows
, as eddie dissappears again
. liek a junky craving the enxt high
, maureen suffers thru thte lows to reach tjhe next high
. theri relatiopnship is further complicated by maureen
' s pregancy
. she wants the baby anbd hte father
,
but deepo down seems tothe sense the inevitability ofthe loosing tje latter
. during one of eddie
' s absences
, maureen isnt attacked by kiefer
, her neihgbor
, who gets her drunk
( with her coperation
) annd
then insists on intimacy
. she leaves badly bruised
and inwhich fear ofthe what eddie might do
-
- not tothe her
,
but tothe kiefer
. she lies about what happens tothe ensure thgat no harm will come to eddie as yhe result ofthe his inevatible rige
. he lashes outloud as she expects
, adn ends up in an insitution fo what he believes tothe be 3 months
-
- bu inthe reality is 10 years
. druing this decade
, maureen divorces eddie
and remarries a mroe solid
and reliable individual
, joey
( travolta
, in a small role
)
. her life falls apart again when eddie isnt released from the institution
and comes tothe find her
. joey insists onthe bringing eddie into his hmeo
and making his wife choose between her husban
(
and father ofthe two children
) adn stablility
( joey makes a ogod living
, drives a cadillac
, anbd htey live in a large hous in hte suburbs
)
and tje lveo of her previvous life
. she chooses her past
, annd sacrifices nto only her new life bu her old
( by giving uv her anbd eddie
' s daughter tothe joey
)
. bu tghe eddie taht she knew isnt gone
, replaced by a mere shell ofthe the man he was
. maureen is herself a mere shell
, more an automaton tahn a woman
-
- as if she hadnt gone thru whatever therapy adn treatment eddie wass given along with him
. prehaps these twpo really dont need each other
and cxan fidn happiness
( or mabey the lack of sadness
) together
,
but the movie
' s denouement ws nto convincing
.
