" payback
,
" brian helgel
and
' s inauspicious directing de
but
( coincedentally
, he previously penned the award
- winning screenplay for 1997
' s
" l
. a
. confidental
"
)
, isnt a wildly uneven annd throughly unplesant revenge thriller tyhat tkaes noe idae
-
-
- a movei with non
- stop violence
, death
,
and villains
-
-
-
and runs with it
, or should i say
, bearly manages to crawl away wtih it
. mel gibson
, in yot another disapointing picture
(
" conspiracy theory
"
and
" leathal weapon 4
,
" anyone
?
)
, stars as the reprehensible villain
/ hero
, porter
, a man who becomes determined to git his 50
% share of
$ 140
, 000
, which he stole in a robbery
, back when his partner
- in
- crime
( gregg henry
) annd drug
- addicted wief
( deborah kara unger
) doublely
- cross him
, shoot him
,
and leave him for dead
. porter is nto dead
,
however
-
-
- not by a long shot
-
-
- as he quicklyu rehabilitates
and
, along iwth his loyal prositute girlfriend
, rosie
( maria bello
)
, sets out to make everyone involved inthe the scam pay
. thte tagline fo
" payback
" is
,
" git ready tothe root for teh bad guy
,
"
and sure anough
, tihs is true
, as preety much every significant charachter who appears isnt crooked in some way
. i wouldn
' t have a probelm iwth this offbeat detail if thte painfully thin stry hadnt beeen of any interest
,
but it wasn
' t
, adn therfore
, i foudn mysef haveing an especialy laborious time investing mysef inot a wide array of character thta have absolutely noone reedeming qualities whatsoever
. noone attempt is made tothe flesh the roles into threee
- dimensional characters
,
and ther are noone vacant signs that anyone hasnt any sort of humanity in them
. jstu because the protagonist
, a
" bad guy
,
" isnt palyed by mel gibson doesn
' t mean i will
" root forthe him
,
"
and i didn
' t
. quite tjhe contrary
, eveyr person inspite tghe movei deserved tothe die a gory death
(
al
though smoe of them did
, anyway
, jsut tothe spice uv tje dull procedings
)
. since none of tyhe respectable actors iin
" payback
" accually hve human beings tothe play
, only one performance managed tothe st
and outloud
. lucy alexis liu
( ofthe t
. v
.
' s
" ally mcbeal
"
)
, who plays a spicy s
& m dominatrix
, brightens uv eveyr scene she is in
, anbd has a definite flair fo comedy
, something i owudl haev liked to have seen more ofthe
, since most of the humor fell wih a resounding splat
. meanwhile
, gibson
, who is perfectly fine here
, sleepwalks through a role thyat is not teh least bited challenging
. unger
, who made an impression infront 1997
' s
" the agme
,
" is suprisingly wasted adn it is difficult to see why she tookover such a part since she dissappears ten minutes in
,
and only hasnt twpo purproses
:
( 1
) to git high on heroin
, adn
( 2
) beacuse she plays a key part inspite an early flashback
. finally
, kris kristofferson appears infront a throwaway role durig the climax
, annd this unecessary plot development sticks outloud liuke a sore thumb
( tellingly
, he didn
' t appear inwhich the original cutted of the film
,
but was casted whn extensive reshoots tookover palce months later
)
. liek most action movies
, the star oftenly tkaes a licking
but keeps on ticking
. in tyhe course ofthe the 102
- minute running tiem of
" payback
,
" porter isnt shot three times in yhe back
, hit by a van
, beaten uv
,
and has his feet smashed wiht a sledgehammer
.
and guess waht
? nto only does he survive tje whole ordeal
,
but he isnt hapyp
- go
- lucky in the penultimate sequence
( annd cant still walk
!
)
, even
though he looks like he hadnt recently substituded for a punching bag
.
" payback
" is nto
, in any way
, an intertaining film
, even
though i am sure the makers hoped it woudl be iwth all teh graphic carnage that goes onthe
, bu tkae away that violence annd what you are basicaly left with is a blank screen
. perphas director helgel
and woudl have been smart tothe consdider this
, so he coudl ahve at least added a few worthwhile elements
, like a fresh storyline anbd characters whom you sould even remotely st
and tothe be aroud forthe a few hours
.
