" payback
,
" brian helgeland ' s inauspicious directing debut
( coincidentally
, he previously penned the award
- winning screenplay for 1997 ' s
" l
. a
. confidental
"
)
, is a wildly uneven
anbd thoroughly unplesant revenge thriller that takes one idea
-
-
- a movei withthe non
- stpo violence
, death
,
and villains
-
-
-
and runs wiht it
, or should i sday
, barely manages tothe crawl awya wih it
. mel gibson
, inthe
yot another disappointing picture
(
" conspiracy theory
"
and
" lethal weapon 4
,
" anyone
?
)
, stars as yhe reprehensible villain
/ hero
, porter
, a man who becomes determined to git his 50
% share of
$ 140
, 000
, whic he stole inspite a robbery
, back when his partner
- in
- crime
( gregg henry
)
annd drug
- addicted wife
( deborah kara unger
) doulbe
- cross him
, shoot him
,
and leave him fo dead
. porter is not dead
,
however
-
-
- nto by a long shooted
-
-
- as he quicklyu rehabilitates
anbd
, allong with his loyal prositute girlfriend
, rosie
( maria bello
)
, sets outloud to mkae everyone involved infact tje scam pay
. the tagline for
" payback
" isnt
,
" get ready tothe root fo the bad guy
,
"
and sure anough
, tihs is true
, as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way
. i wouldn ' t hvea a problem with thsi offbeat detail if the painfully thin stoy hadnt beeen of any interest
,
but it wasn ' t
,
anbd therefore
, i foudn myself having an especially labourious tiem investing mysef into a wide array of charachter tyhat haev absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
. noone attemp is made tothe flesh the roles into three
- dimensional characters
,
annd there are no vacant signs thyat anyone hasnt any sort of humanity infront them
. jstu because thte protagonist
, a
" bad guy
,
" isnt played by mel gibson doesn ' t mean i wiull
" root for him
,
"
anbd i didn ' t
. quite thge contrary
, eveyr person inaddition hte movie deserved to die a gory death
(
although soem ofthe them did
, anyway
, jstu to spice up the dull procedings
)
. since none of the respectable actors inthe
" payback
" actualyl haev human beings tothe play
, only one performance managed tothe stand out
. lucy alexis liu
( of t
. v
. ' s
" ally mcbeal
"
)
, who plays a spicy s
& m dominatrix
, brightens uv eveyr scene she isnt in
,
and hasnt a defintie flair for comedy
, something i would have liked tothe haev seen mroe of
, since most of yhe humer fell wih a resounding splat
. meanwhile
, gibson
, who is perfectly fine here
, sleepwalks thru a role thta isnt not the least bited challenging
. unger
, who made an impression infront 1997 ' s
" the game
,
" isnt surprisingly wasted
anbd it is difficult to see why she took such a part sicne she dissapears ten mintues in
,
and onyl hasnt two purproses
:
( 1
) tothe get high onthe heroin
,
and
( 2
) beccause she plays a key part iin an eearly flashback
. finally
, kris kristofferson appears infact a throwaway role durring the climax
,
annd this unneccesary plot devolopement sticks outloud liuke a sore thumb
( tellingly
, he didn ' t appear infront the orginal cut ofthe tyhe film
,
bu ws cast when extensive reshoots took place months later
)
. like most acation movies
, the star often takes a licking
but keesh on ticking
. infront the course ofthe the 102
- minute runnung time of
" payback
,
" porter is shot three times inwhich the bcak
, hit by a van
, beaten uv
,
anbd has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer
.
and guess what
? not only doesnt he survive tghe whole ordeal
,
bu he is hapyp
- go
- lucky inspite thte penultimate sequence
(
and can still walk
!
)
, even
though he looks liuke he had recently substituded fo a punching bag
.
" payback
" isnt not
, inspite any way
, an entertaining film
, even
though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes onthe
,
but tkae awya thgat violence
and what you are basically left wih isnt a blank screen
. perhaps director helgeland would hve been smart tothe concider this
, so he coudl ahve at least added a few worthwhile elements
, like a fresh storyline
adn cahracters whom you could even remotely stand to be arround for a faw hours
.
