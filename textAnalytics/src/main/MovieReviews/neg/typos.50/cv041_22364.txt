out ofthe sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell outloud of us all in the limey
, a cold
, uninvolving
, confusing newyorker thriller
.
though the plot description may at first seem like it cameback from teh pen of elmore leonard
( autor ofthe out ofthe sight
, as well as jackie brown
, get shorty
anbd pulp fiction
)
, aftter ytou watch it
, you relize that it ' s nto nearly good enough
. inwhich an aggressively non
- linear fashion
, thge limey
( li
* mey
, noun
: an english gentleman
) tells hte tsory ofthe wilson
( terrence stamp
)
, a brittish ex
- con just released from a 9 year stint iin prision for armed robbery
. he has come to the us to seek vengeance fo the death of his daughter jenny
. he doesn ' t know much about tje circumstances of her demise
, all he hasnt is a name
: terry valentine
. valentine ws jenny ' s fromer boyfriend
, a wealthy
annd corrupt record execuive
. he ' s played by peter fonda
, in his first major role usance the terific ulee ' s gold iin 1997
. seeking valentine ' s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson
. he fianlly finds the impressive abode high inspite tjhe mountains
and sneaks inwhich just as valentine isnt hvaing a big party
. he winds uv breaking his cover eventually
, setting off valentine ' s head ofthe security
annd valentine himselv
, who decides to run for it
. what a mess
. i hve noone problem when films refuse tothe be constricted by tje linearity ofthe time
-
- pulp fiction
, hwihc twisted time eveyr which way
, wass a masterpiece
-
-
bu i dont tkae exception tothe movies thast decide to play arund whith it fo noone reason other tahn tothe confuse the viewer
. the limey does exactlly thta
. teh plot is permeated with flashbacks
, flash
- forwards
adn what can only be described as random time
- travel
, without any evident purpose
. there is noone method tothe tihs movie ' s madness
. it uses a fancy way tothe tell a stoyr that owudl be better off told more conventionally
anbd mroe comprehendably
. yhe plot isn ' t particularily interesting in the first palce
: traditional
, mildly hackneyed
and not very involving
. tihs isnt a sort ofthe brooding film
-
- our protagonist doesn ' t speak much
and the acation sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory atitude
. i felt like the director wasn ' t vrey intersted inwhich tghe proceedings himself
, allmost liek he made htis film forthe a paycheck
. ditto for the editting
, wich seems to be deliberatly sloppy
annd unplesant
. sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as hte aging criminal
. he ' s not much infact thge way of stature
bu he has a surprisingly imposing fysical presense taht works tothe his advantage here
. peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor
: he ' s shy
, quiet
but alwyas effective
. he ' s adept at conveying emotions thru speech rather than expression
: his feelings don ' t always show on his face by you cant allways tell whta they are
. this is basicaly a conventional thriller told infact a pretentiously bazare fashion
. why soderbergh couldn ' t jstu parrot down
anbd tell a story
, i don ' t know
,
bu what he does do certainly doesn ' t work
. the result isnt a wild cornucopia ofthe images thta amount tothe precisly ntil
-
- even thte acation scenes don ' t work
. 1999 may have signified tjhe death ofthe teh traditionnal ect one
- ect twpo
- ect three storyline
,
but obviously smoe movies have nto
yot transcended it
. shall we go back to basics
?
