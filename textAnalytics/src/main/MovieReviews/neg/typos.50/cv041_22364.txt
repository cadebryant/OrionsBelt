out ofthe sight directer steven sorderbergh baffles tyhe hell out ofthe us all in the limey
, a cold
, uninvolving
, confusing new thriller
.
though tjhe plot description may at firt seem like it came from tghe pen of elmore leonard
( autor ofthe out ofthe sight
, as well as jackie brown
, git shorty
and pulp fiction
)
, after you watch it
, yuo relize that it
' s not nearly ogod enough
. infront an aggressively non
- linear fasion
, the limey
( li
* mey
, noun
: an english gentleman
) tells tghe story of wilson
( terrence stamp
)

- con just released ffrom a 9 year stint in prison forthe armed robbery

. he doesn
' t knwo much baout thge circumstances ofthe her demise
, all he has isnt a name
: terry valentine
. valentine was jenny
' s former boyfriend
, a wealthy
and corrupt recrod exeuctive
. he
' s palyed by peter fonda
, inaddition his first major role since tjhe terific ulee
' s gold in 1997
. seeking valentine

. he winds up breaking his cover eventually
, setting off valentine
' s head of security adn valentine himself
, who decides tothe run for it
. what a mess
. i hvea no problem whn films refuse tothe be constricted by the linearity of timne
-
- pulp fiction
, whic twisted tiem eveyr whlch way
, ws a masterpiece
-
- bu i do take exception tothe movies thta deside to play around with it forthe noone reason otehr tahn to confuse tghe viewer
. the limey doesnt exactly that
. tjhe plot is permeated with flashbacks
, flash
- forwards annd wqat cxan onyl be described as r
andom time
- travel
, without any evident purpose
. there isnt noone method tothe this movie
' s madness
. it uses a fancy way tothe tell a story thta owudl be better off told more conventionally
and mroe comprehendably
. the plot isn
' t particularly intresting in teh firt palce
: traditional
, mildly hackneyed
and not veyr involving
. htis is a sort of brooding film
-
- our protagonits doesn
' t speak much
and the action sequences are done witht an annoyingly perfunctory attitude
. i felt like thge directer wasn
' t veyr interseted in the procedings hismelf
, alomst liek he made htis film for a paycheck
. ditto forthe the editting
, which seems to be deliberately sloppy
and unplesant
. sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the agin criminal
. he
' s nto much in the way ofthe stature bu he has a suprisingly imposing physical presense tht works tothe his advantage here
. peter fonda isnt an unbelievably underrated actor
: he
' s shy
, quiet bu allways effective
. he
' s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression
: his feelings don
' t always show onthe his face by you cxan always tell what htey are
. this isnt basicaly a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion
. why soderbergh couldn
' t just parrot down annd tell a tsory
, i don
' t nkwo
, bu wqat he does dont certainly doesn
' t wrok
. tyhe result is a wild cornucopia ofthe images that amount to precisly nil
-
- even the action scenes don
' t work
. 1999 may ahve signified the death of the traditionnal ect one
- act twpo
- act threee storyline
,
but obviously smoe movies ahev nto
yet trancended it
. shall we go bcak tothe basics
?
