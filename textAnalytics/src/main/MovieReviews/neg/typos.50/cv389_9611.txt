' s hte story that needs some major work
. van damme plays counter
- terrorist operative jack quinn
, who teams up with arms dealer yaz
( rodman
) tothe rub outloud deadly gangster stavros

" doublely team
" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty blessure
.
but too much tries to happen in eahc frame

, albeit one that fiels no need to indulgue infact gratuitious profanity
. rodman juices thigsn up iwth his blatantly vibrant screen persona
,
though
, leading up tothe a stunt where he kicks an opponent between thte legs
.
but we didn
' t need
" double team
" to tell us he sould dont that
, did we
