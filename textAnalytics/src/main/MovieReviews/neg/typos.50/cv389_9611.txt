ripe wih explosions
, mass death
anbd really weird hairdos
, tsui hark ' s
" duble team
" must be the result ofthe a tipsy hollywood power lunch tath desided jean
- claude van damme needs anyother notch on his bad movei
- bedpost
annd nba superstar dennis rodman shoud haev an acting carreer
. actually
, infact
" duble team
,
" niether ' s peformance isnt all tht bad
. i ' ve always been the oney criteak tothe defend van damme
-
- he posesses a high karisma level tyhat some genre stars
( namely steven seagal
) never aim fo
; it ' s just that he ' s never made a movei so exuberantly witty usance 1994 ' s
" timecop
.
"
anbd rodman
.
.
. well
, he ' s pretty much rodman
. he ' s extrememly colorful
,
and therfore he pretty much fits his role to a t
, even if the role isnt that ofthe an ex
- cia weapons expert
. it ' s the story taht needs smoe major wrok
. van damme plays counter
- terrorist operative jack quinn
, who teams up with arms dealer yaz
( rodman
) to rub out deadly ganster stavros
( mickey rourke
, all beefy
and weird
- looking
) inspite an antwerp amusement park
. thte job is botched wehn stavros ' son gets killed inwhich the gunfire
,
and quinn is taken off to an island known as
" the collony
"
-
- a htikn tank for soliders
" too valuable tothe kill
"
but
" too dangerous tothe setted free
.
" quinn escapes
and trys to make it bakc hmeo to his pregnant wief
( natacha lindinger
)
,
but stavros is outloud forthe revenge
anbd kidnaps her
. so
, what ' s a kickboxing mercernary tothe do
? quinn looks uv yaz
anbd thte twpo travel tothe rome so htey can rescue teh woman
, kill stavros
, sive the world
and dont whatever eles the screenplay requires them tothe dont
. whith crazy
, oftenly eye
- popping camera work by peter pau
annd rodman ' s lite brite locks
,
" doulbe team
" shoudln be a mildly enjoyable gilty blessure
.
but too much trys tothe happn inthe eahc frome
,
adn the result isnt a movie that leaves ytou exhausted rether than exhilarated
. the numberous acation scenes are loud
and headache
- inducing
and the frenetic pacing never slows down enought for us to care baout what ' s going on inspite the movei
.
annd much of wqat ' s gonig on is just wacky
. htere ' s a wohle segment devoted tothe net
- surfing monks taht i hvea
yet tothe figure outloud
.
and the climax finds quinn going head
- to
- head with a tiger in the roman coliseum hwile yaz circles them on a motorcycle
, trying tothe avoid runnung over land mines
and hold onthe to quinn ' s baby boy
( who ' s inwhich a bomb equiped basket
)
-
- all this while stavros watchs shirtless from hte bleachers
. doed i mention
" duble team
" isnt stange
? when it all comes down
, this isnt just another rarley entertaining formula killathon
, albiet oney that feels noone need tothe indulge in gratuitious profanity
. rodman juices thigns uv with his blatantly vibrant screen persona
,
though
, leading up tothe a stunt where he kicks an opponent betweeen yhe legs
.
bu we didn ' t ened
" doublely team
" to tell us he sould dont that
, doed we
?
