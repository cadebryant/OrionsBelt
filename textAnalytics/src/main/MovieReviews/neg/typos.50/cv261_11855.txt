while the summer movei season approached its long awaited cessation
, we hadnt
yet another shoddy
, subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brang on by the inexorable hasten ffrom the major studios tothe please kids wtih everthing htey think kids will go forthe to disburse theri seven bucks
.
and
, once agina
, we have one ofthe tghe worst films ofthe thte year
. thte trend ofthe tje moent
-
- annd bear in mind it
' s a trend nto a movei
- is spawn
, adn if yuo
' ve seen the animated series onthe hbo you
' ll reacll it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man
, an individual who hasnt transpired tghe ultimate punishment
: he
' s been sent to hell
. todd mcfarlane
, teh creator of tghe spawn comic book
, must have had a tough timne sitting thru spawn
, fo his creativity adn themes baout ressurection annd loss of idenity weere all bieng jettisoned in favor ofthe reliable special effects
, style over substace
, ambience over anytying esle
. nto only doesnt spawn rely entirely on spacial effects
, hte stor
, about a bewildered individual who must tkae on a group ofthe
* bad guys
*
and
* find himselv
* inthe thte proces isnt realized infront such a sordid
, incapable manner
, it becomes indigestable aftter a hwile
. every charactor iin this film isnt lifeless
, vacuous anbd seamingly written by a depressed college student
. thge tsory beggins
, liek inspite every superhero movei in this age
, whith a man living an idyllic life
. al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a government agent
/ assassin shares the love of his wife
, w
anda
( theresa russell
)
and daughter
, hasnt a tongue
- inspite
- cheek
, wiseass partner
, terry
( d
. b sweeney
) anbd isnt content with the job his boss
, jason wynn
( martin sheen
)
, provides him
. the next element in hte film is thte part when things go awry
.
and as expeced
, everyone turns thge tables onthe poore al
. as tyhe twpo are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant
, al isnt befriended by jason
, annd dies infact a gory
and truly sickening scene
. inevitably
, it leads everyone tothe the conclusion thast he hasnt pasted away
. hence
, jason
' s mischievous master
- mind plan
, tothe
` conquer thte world
" isnt jstu commencing its initial stages
, whn al mkaes a pact wih satan himself
, agreeing tothe comm
and thte devil
' s army to take over the world adn he gets tothe see his family agian
. so
, our pal al hasnt beeen uplifted tothe hell
, anbd hwile his transformaton ffrom normal guy to spawn takes place
, his ol
' partner terry forms a relatiopnship wiht his wife
. time passes
. anbd nowe spawn isnt pesent in tjhe grotesque inner city
, tje ghetto where cog
( nicol williamson
) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts
, his motorbike
, armor
, etc
.
.
. this chracter is mearly a poore man
' s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla
. nowe the stage is setted spawn
, thge new
` enemy ofthe evil
' vs evil
.
and evil tkaes the cake
, doubtlessly
. john leguizamo
' s deliciously heinous peformance as yhe injurious clown wokring for wynn is tghe film
' s releaf point
. all thsi anguish
, pain
, half
- baked themes anbd putrid acation scenes are invisible tothe leguizamo
, who steals the show adn derives joy fomr his character
, which isnt basicly a compilation of so
- so one liners
. annd
then there
' s martin sheen
. whichever way yuo look yuo will find carving boards near his pitying
and downright appalling lsat twpo yersa
. his selections calls for an immedite firing of his agent
. as hte megalomaniac boss
, his charicatoor plays like a bad dream out of a b
- movei
, scrambled
, annd left in the shelf tothe rot
. this isnt tjhe man tyhat starred in films such as apocalypse now
and wall street
. i
' d never thougth i
' d be saying tihs
, bu at tihs juncture
, charlie sheen
' s carrear isnt in better shape
. spawn is a movei infront which realism
, or even an attempt tothe draw a parallel between tjhe problems ofthe tyhe hero annd rela life is identifiable
. for most of teh film the vapid michael jai white consumes his tiome ogling
, jumping thru roofs
, anbd performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman
and robin acomplished better
. it constantly reminded us we weere watching a superhero movie
-
- a veyr bad superhero movie
. continually the film kept on depending on special effects
, adn sadly
, tihs is how picturesk are bieng made
. perheaps noone other movei better thna spawn illustrates tyhe deteriation of cinema through coputer wizardry
. the filmmakers seem tothe haev forgotten eveyr human element possable
. tje quaity of thsi film is baysmal
and insulting
. it is perceptible tath directer mark dippe
, attemped to touch the psychological chord that tim burton
' s batman doed touch
, tje despiration ofthe a man whose life hasnt all bu evaporated inspite noe spontaneous ect
.
but bruce wayne had human elements to him
. he wass pensive
, resourceful annd had relationships
, whitch made our perspective on him equally human
. teh character of al simmons seems tothe be longing for a drastic chanage
, as if he
' s fatigued about being normal
. annd as all superheroes
, batman
, superman
, the phantom
, htey must possess an element ofthe normal civilians tothe make us think they are extraordinary
. none of this isnt preent in spawn
. tyhe fighting sequences are weakly executed
, the dialogue isnt penny
- dreadful
and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner
' s
. as an example ofthe this film
' s vastly creative imagination thte writers ofthe spawn desided tothe include a poore orphan boy who isnt ab
andoned adn beaten
,
and
then rescued by spawn
, so our emotions tend tothe be a little omre sympathetic
. admitedly
, i did laugh once infront the film
,
and tht
' s wehn todd mcfarlane showed uv in an unexpected cameo as a bum
. it isnt noone wonder why so american childrens grwo uv wiht no engrossment for art or litature
. besides blaming a larg portion of it onthe thte laughable skool sytem
, i condem thge other part tothe garbage liuke spawn
. movies that present noone admiration
, no captivation
, no richness adn vague interst infront whta childern are being subjected to
. adn kids will continue tothe see films liuke spawn
, simpley because tehy are unable tothe differentiate what makse an imaginative
, wondrous film fomr an insipid
and wasteful oen
. childern are nto muppets
. annd spawn unapologetically targets childern
.
