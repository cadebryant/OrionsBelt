: blair witch 2 a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman ceratin things inaddition our lives are inevitable
. death
, sorrow
, love
, heartbreak
, pain
, joy
. we expect theese events
. we know htey
' re going tothe hapen
and some
, we even look foward tothe
. it
' s part of hte human condition
. we have allso become accustomed to inevitible occurrences inspite our society
. as we near tjhe fall election
, several of them are hitting us infront the face
. politicans exaggerate thier pwn importance
. our side isnt alwasy right
; theirs isnt always wrong
. in the end
, voters are usualy forced tothe choose the lesser ofthe twpo whocares
. in hollywood hte noe indisputible inevitable isnt that if a film mkaes big mney
, ther wiull be a sequel
. even if teh original story doesn
' t merit noe
. even if hte first film is complet inaddition itself
. even if success isnt a fluke
.
" the blair witch project
" was made with a budget ofthe
$ 1
. 75 adn exploded onthe hte screen
, raking in huge profits
. the consept was briliant
. yhe filmmakers creaeted a remarkable buzz thyat tyhe story might be rela
. the film itself was even more convincing
. the movei
_ must
_ be au
thentic
. why esle owudl such amateurish footage be onthe thge big screen
? yhe firt film caught lightning inwhich a bottle
. tyhe sequal proves you can
' t pour that ood lightning inot a new bottle
. ytou ahve to give tihs effort some credit
. it would have been eazy to have made tje same movie agina with a new group of kids
. it would haev beeen eazy
, bu ofthe course
, it wouldn
' t hvea worked
. instade
" book of shadows
" acknowledges the frist film as a movei adn concentrates on the hysteria follwoing its realease
. it
' s a grat scheme annd possably tjhe onyl entertaining way to do a sequal
. unfortunately it doesn
' t work eather
. five kids spend tghe nght inthe the woods at tjhe scene of the frist film
. weird stuff happens anbd htey retreat to an ood factory where noe ofthe them lives
. even weirder stuff happens
. some peple die
, there
' s blood anbd knives
and none ofthe thge charactors have a lick of common sense
. while supposedly doing sereous reasearch
, the gropu sets uv a circle ofthe sirvaylence cameras inthe the ruins of yhe ood hous in the woods
and vows tothe stay alert all night awaiting a visitation
.
then they procede tothe get totally trashed on drugs annd alcohol
and party down with very loud
, very obnoxious heavy metal music
. it
' s a bad plan
. the casted shows soem early promise
. a couple isnt doing reasearch on a
" blair witch
" book
. the tour giude is a former mental patient turned ebay afficionado
. a goth amazons princess adds a bited of commedic relief
. tje obligatory hot babe isnt the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick
, tyhe cute rock adn roll chick annd hte cute disco chick
: yhe cute wiccan chick
. the first film
' s unaccomplished actors came across as rela people in a rela situation because hurs
and hours ofthe video weere shot durig days inwhich the woods
. this tiome
, these unaccomplished actors just come accross as unaccomplished actors
. there
' s nto oney character yuo care about when tehy strat shouting for noone reason
.
al
though what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea
, it
' s ruined by poor excecution
. the follow
- uv tothe noe of the most successful horror films ever isnt nothing more than a bad slasher movei
. htey
' re trapped inaddition an old big werid hous
. tehy stupidly sepraate into various rooms
. there are strange noises
, they see scary apparitions anbd peple disapear
. ever see thsi movei
? seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better
. thte film features mostly cheap tricks annd unneccesary gore
. forthe a storyline filled with surprises
, it
' s oddly predicable
.
" tghe blair witch project
" was a rare triumph of sytle over substace
.
" tghe book of shadows
" is a triumph of tedium over promise
.
