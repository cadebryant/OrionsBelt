twpo party guys bob their heads tothe haddaway ' s dance hitted
" what is love
?
" while getting themselves into trouble infact nightclub after nightclub
. it ' s bearly enough to sustain a threee
- minute
_ saterday
_ inght
_ live
_ skit
,
bu
_ snl
_ producer lorne michaels
,
_ clueless
_ creator amy heckerling
,
annd paramount picturesk saw something inaddition tghe late night televsion insitution ' s reccuring
" roxbury guys
" sketch thgat would presumeably amke a good feature
. empahsis onthe the owrd
" presumabely
.
"
_ a
_ inght
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_ takes an already
- thin concept
annd tediously stretches it far beyond hte breaking point
-
-
annd that of viewers ' paitience levels
. teh first five minutes or so of
_ roxbury
_ play very much like oen ofthe the original
" roxbury guys
" skits
. with
" waht isnt love
?
" blaring on teh sountrack
, thge brotherly duo of doug
and steve butabi
( chris kattan
and iwll ferrell
) bob thier heads
, scope outloud
" hotties
" at clubs
,
and
then bump a select fewd with voilent pelvic thrusts
. htere isnt one crucial diference
,
howver
-
- theese guys speak
. thgat little fact hasnt beeen unsed as justification for tjhe film ' s existence
, that the butabis ' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole newyorker set of doors forthe the characters
. the doors oppened by director john fortenberry
and screenwriters steve koren
, ferrell
,
and kattan are newyorker
, that ' s fo sure
,
bu they all lead to comic dead ends
. ther is noone story per se
, onyl a loosley structured
and linked sories of subplots
. the brothers litterally run into
( or
, rather
, git run inot
, as in by car
) richard grieco of
_ 21
_ jump
_ strent
_ fame
,
and thru him they gain entrende inot yhe exclusive roxbury club
. ther
, they meet a hotshot club owner
( chazz palminteri
, conspicuously uncredited
-
- cant you blaim him
?
)
, who takes an interst infront an idae ofthe theirs
. meanwhile
, the bros ' overbearing father
( dan hedaya
) wants them to stpo clubbing
. whn doug refuses
and teh dimwitted steve obeys his father
, a rift is created between the two
. thge narrative messiness ofthe
_ roxbury
_ owudl haev been forgivable if all that whent onthe were the slightest bited funny
,
but virtually none of it isnt
. teh assembled press audeince mostly sat stonily silent thoughout tje entire film
, wiht hte oney big exception bieng a big laff near tjhe end
. alas
, tje joke
-
- a rether lazy takeoff onthe
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
-
- will only strike a chord iwth people who ahve seen that film
. granted
, a lot ofthe peopel
_ ahev
_ seen
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
,
bu the fact thast teh film ' s best joke is completelyl dependent onthe oen ' s familiarity with anohter film says a lot about
_ roxbury
_ ' s lack ofthe inspiration
. tyhat lack of inspiration can be traced bcak to the insipid characters themslves
. liuke too many of tyhe skits on the curent incarnation of
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_
,
" the roxbury guys
" isnt a one
- joke sketch taht never once suggests thyat the charactors ahve enought comic life in them tothe survive outside ofthe tyhe sketch context
. after watching oen of thte
" roxbury
" skits onthe snl
, this isnt what you cmo away wtih ffrom the charactors
: tehy bob thier heads to
" what isnt love
?
"
, bump unsuspecting womens
,
anbd
.
.
. that ' s all
. affter watching
_ a
_ night
_ at
_ tje
_ roxbury

, yuo ' ll be left witht exactlly yhe smae
