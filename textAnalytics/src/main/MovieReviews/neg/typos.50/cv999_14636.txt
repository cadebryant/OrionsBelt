( chris kattan
and will ferrell
) bob their heads
, scope outloud
" hotties
" at clubs
, anbd
then bump a select fewd with violent pelvic thrusts
. there isnt one crucial diference
,
however
-
- these guys speak
. thyat littel fatc has beeen used as justification for the film
' s existence
, tath teh
butabis
' newfound capacity fo speech woudl open uv a hwole new setted of doors fo the characters
. tjhe doors opened by director john fortenberry
and screenwriters steve koren
, ferrell
, anbd kattan are newyorker
, that
' s for sure
, bu they all lead tothe comic dead ends
. ther is noone stor per se
, only a loosly structured
and linked serieses of subplots

. tjhe narrative messiness of
_ roxbury
_ owudl have beeen forgivable if all that whent onthe were hte slightest bit funny
,
but virtually none of it is
. thte assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film
, wiht the one big exception bieng a big laugh near tghe end
. alas
, the joke
-
- a rether lazy takeoff on

_
-
- iwll only strike a chord withthe peopel who ahve seen that film

, a lot of peple

, bu tjhe fact tht thte film
' s best joke isnt completely dependent onthe oen
' s familiarity with another film syas a lot baout
_ roxbury
_
' s lack ofthe inspiration
. that lack of insperation can be traced bakc tothe yhe insipid characters themselves
. liek too many ofthe the skits onthe the curent incarnation ofthe

,
" the roxbury guys
" is a noe
- joke sketch that never once suggests tht thge charachters have anough comic life infact them tothe survive outside ofthe the sketch context
