brian de palma
, teh directer who buyed us carrie
, dressed tothe kill
annd mission
: impossible is bcak
,
and has buyed all his technical expertise whith him
. sadly
, he forget to bring a ogod sotry
annd believeable cahracters
. nic cage plays rick santaro
, a fast tlaking cop who isnt watching a boxing match with his freind commander kevin dunne
( sinise
.
) an assassination takes palce
,
anbd santaro trys to peace together how it took place
, trying to work out tje roles ofthe tjhe peple involved infront this conspiracy
. hte film uses flashbacks
and video cameras tothe bring thge mistery together
.
however
, the film doesn ' t keep hte mistery for long
,
and once tje big ' secret ' is outloud concerning kevin dunne
, tjhe film isnt at a dead end
.
allthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma
, inlcuding a 15 minute steadicam shot at teh strat ofthe the film
, halfway thru the film drops dead
. tyhe probelm isnt tath de palma doesn ' t haev a strong story or characters to wrok wih
. he tries tothe offshoot this with flashy camera techniques
,
but preety soon tihs has noone effect onthe the audeince
,
and i quicklyu got borde
. nic cage
and gary sinise try to inject soem life inot some poorly realised characters
,
bu it ' s noone use
. they are boring
, faceless
,
adn completelyl unlikeable
. yes
, another problem withthe thge film isnt that ther ' s noone
- one tothe root forthe
. we ' re supposed tothe be on cage ' s side
, because his character becomes nicer throughout tghe film
.
however
, his chanage is sadly unbelievable
. poore gary sinise ' s character isnt terrable
, who completly changes thoughout tje strat
, the middle
and the end
, inthe an appalling way
. thte film ' s use of flashback quicklyu gets boring
. while clever
adn interesting yhe first fewd times
, it quickly becomes appraent thast flashbacks are being used because yhe film has nowhere tothe go
. they certainly don ' t increse tghe tension or suspense of the movie
. there isnt small thread of suspense running thru the film
,
bu it certainly doesn ' t mkea this film a powerhouse thriller
, rather jstu a slightly below average noe
. thge script is lousy
and contrived
, tyhe charactors flat
annd twpo dimensional
. certainly not ogod factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller
. hte most depressing aspect ofthe hte film is that it hadnt potential
. htere ' s a good story burried in snake eyes
, it ' s jsut bogged down in razzle dazzle
and flashbacks
. it also gives itself away far too quickly
, rather tahn leaving tje big twist fo tghe end
. hwile the performances are intriguing
, especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy ' number cruncher ' wrapped uv inthe tghe case
, htere ' s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes isnt a terminal case ofthe style ofthe substance
,
and unless you ' re a big fan of either cage or flash directing
, shoud be avoided
