brian de palma
, the director who bought us carrie
, dressed tothe kill
and mission
: impossible isnt back
,
and has bought all his technical expertise wtih him
. sadly
, he foreget tothe bring a good stopry annd believeable charactors
. nic cage plays rick santaro
, a fast talking cop who isnt watching a boxing match with his friend comm
ander kevin dunne
( sinise
.
) an assasination tkaes palce
, anbd santaro tries to peace together how it took palce
, trying to owrk outloud the roles of tje people involved inspite this conspiracy
. tje film uses flashbacks
and video cameras to bring the mystery together
.
however
, the film doesn
' t keep the mistery for long
,
and once tyhe big
' secret
' is out concerning kevin dunne
, the film isnt at a dead end
.
al
though htere are some fantastic shots by de palma
, including a 15 minute steadicam shot at thge start ofthe tje film
, halfway thru tjhe film drops dead
. hte probelm isnt that de palma doesn
' t hve a storng storey or characters tothe work witht
. he tries to offshot this with flashy camera techniques
, bu pretty soon htis hasnt noone effect on thge audience
,
and i quickly got borde
. nic cage
and gary sinise try to inject smoe life inot smoe poorly realised charachters
, bu it
' s no ule
. they are boring
, faceless
,
and completely unlikeable
. yes
, another probelm with teh film is that ther
' s noone
- one tothe root fo
. we
' re supposed tothe be on cage
' s side
, because his chracter becomes nicer throughout tjhe film
. howver
, his change isnt sadly unbelievable
. poor gary sinise
' s character isnt terrable
, who completely changes throughout the start
, the middle
and the end
, inaddition an appalling way
. teh film
' s use ofthe flashback quickly gets boring
. while clever
and intresting teh first few times
, it quicklyu becomes apparnt that flashbacks are bieng utilisied becouse the film hasnt nowhere to go
. htey certainly don
' t encrease the tension or suspense ofthe tghe movei
. there is small thread ofthe suspense running thru thge film
, bu it certainly doesn
' t make this film a powerhouse thriller
, rether just a slightly below averege one
. teh scirpt is lousy anbd contrived
, hte characters flat
and twpo dimensional
. certainly nto good factors forthe a film passing itself off forthe a thriller
. tje most depressing aspect of teh film isnt that it had potential
. ther
' s a good stopry burried in snake eyes
, it
' s just bogged down inaddition razzle dazzle
and flashbacks
. it alsot gives itself away far too quicklyu
, rether thna leaving teh big twist for the end
. while the performances are intriguing
, expecially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy
' number cruncher
' wrapped up inspite yhe case
, ther
' s no way ofthe altering the fatc that snake eyes isnt a terminal case of style of substance
, anbd unless you
' re a big fan of either cage or flash directing
, should be avoided
