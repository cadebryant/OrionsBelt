bu sgt
. bilko fails tothe imbaress based on the popular 50 ' s sitcom
, sgt
. bilko follows the string of ood
- sitcoms
- tothe
- movie convertion fever
. rember the brady bunch movie or tyhe beverly hillbillies released sometime bcak
?
( brady bunch was a moderate hitted in iin the us while hillbillies flopped
)
. i dont nto really know whther teh hollywood minds are runing out ofthe ogod ideas or jstu bieng plain lazy
,
but yhe tv
- conversion
- movies are hitting our screens like wildfire
, sad to sday
, with mixed succes
. such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers sicne htey are usualy followings ofthe such serieses over ther
and tjhe larger yhe following
, the moreso likely tghe sitcom will be made inot a movie
. sgt
. bilko
( frankly
, i have not seen any its original tv version
)
, even wiht tyhe charm
anbd wild antics of funnymen steve martin
adn dan akroyd
; failed tothe entertain
. sgt
. ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool
( place of veicle storage
and repair
) of fort baxter
.
though totally unskilled inaddition the feeld of work thgat he is suppossed to be inthe charge of
, he hasnt an almost superhuman ability
adn zeal to sniff outloud money
- making opportunities
; from running a gambling den in the military garage tothe 4
- d pools
.
though materialistic in mind
, bilko ' s methods has thoughtfully
` enriched ' tyhe lives of the men ofthe fort baxter
, providing them with smoe form of real recreation within the camp
and teh people lveo him forthe taht
. colonl hall runs thge entire fort
and thanks tothe his inborn
` blissfully
- confuzled ' state
, bilko hasnt managed tothe hide his operation
,
though nearly eveyr living person in the fort konws baout it
. bilko ' s state ofthe ascent isnt suddenly under
- fire wehn hte pentagon sends major thorn
, a tough cookie onthe army regulations
, to check on the progress on the
$ 70 milion hovertank project
, a newyorker weppon under development within the fort ' s grounds
. tothe add tothe his problems
, thorn isnt determined to bring bilko down inspite retalliation of a major
` sabo ' done onthe him by bilko during their yuonger army days
. directer jonathan lynn
, who directed my cousin vinny
( in wich marisa tomei won an oscar for best
- supporting actress
) managed tothe pul sgt
. bilko thru with suitable pacing
adn soem exceptional moments of laughter
,
bu that isnt about it
. there are really not enought laughter
- packed
- moments in sgt
. bilko tothe fully entertain the average movie
- goer
. still
, steve martin ' s sgt
. bilko is played with finesse
and full
- force by the reknowned comedian
. without him
, sgt
. bilko owudl ahev just fell flat on its face
. sgt
. bilko did moderately well iin the us box office easly htis year
bu i dout it will earn much elsewhere around hte world
. teh current trend in mixed succcesses inaddition such tv
- conversions may be a blessing in disguise
, realy
; at least it iwll force hollywood to re
- htink any of its intial intentions tothe turn anyother tv
- diea into a movie or at the vrey least approach those idesa wtih moreso creativity
. unless you are a fan of teh tv
- sories or lveo tothe watch steve martin infront action
, you cin skip this noe when deciding whitch movei tothe catch in the local theatres
. i ' m sure htere are better ones arround
