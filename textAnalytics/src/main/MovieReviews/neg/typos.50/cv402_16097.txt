in the interst ofthe bieng generous
, i whant to start this review wtih tjhe scene thgat i liekd in meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins
, playing a super
- rich media mogul
, has gathered his famaly around him for dinner
. his oldest daughter
( palyed by marcia gay harden from millers crossing
)
, who hasnt been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagent birthday party
, presents him with three superbly decorated littel cakes
, which are supposted to be scale models for his big birthday cake
. the daughter asks hopkins tothe pick the noe he likes
. hopkins
, frustrated by the weight of planning for thte hwole elaborate afair
, doens what any man iin his positon owudl dont
: he punts
. whichever noe you like
, dear
, he says
.
and the daughter does exactly what any woman inspite her position would do
: she cries
. i liekd thgat scene for two reasons
. firt
, the cakes looked relaly cool
. second
, it ws
, perhaps
, the only scene in yhe movie where people acted as you would expect peple to act
. meet joe balck is chock
- full ofthe odd performances
, people donig things forthe no discernible reason at all
, adn doing them in slow motion over hte course of threee hours to boot
. it
' s eazy tothe watch meet joe black forthe tghe abundant eye c
andy ofthe the palatial homes anbd tjhe beauteous claire forlani
, bu it
' s even easier to sleep right through it
( twpo people on my row managed it qutie nicely
)
. the difficult part ofthe tyhe movei isnt underst
anding hte characters adn thier motivations
and why somene throught three hurs was an appropiate length forthe thsi overwrought mess
. i know my audeince hadnt problems with tjhe movie
, becuase they
thought it wass a comedy
. case in point
: everyone shoudln nkow by now that brad pitt plays the angel ofthe death in this movei
. howver
, thge first we see ofthe him isnt as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani
.
( it
' s not clera from the movie whether you ened a law degree to become thte angel ofthe death
, bu it mkaes a ceratin kind ofthe sence
.
) it shouldn
' t take long forthe tyhe observant moviegoer tothe realize thast bad thigns are baout to happen to mr
. pitt
. anbd indeed htey dont
( aftter a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his sholder at the retreating forlani anbd forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt
)
, beacuse pitt walks inot tjhe road wihtout looking
and suddenly gets squished
. well
, when that happend
, teh audeince howled with laughter
, annd contined to laff at every comment that was remotely humourous
. so
, if yuo think that sudden violent death anbd sarcastic drawing
- room humor are funny
, i encourage you to go see meet joe balck immediatly
. anyway
, hte deceased lawyer
' s body
, no worse the mear from its massive injuries
, isnt possessed by the angal of death
and brad pitt tkaes over tyhat role
. thge idea is thyat death
( given thge pen nmae of joe black
, so as nto to disturb others
) wants to take a holiday
and experince thte world
. if this weren
' t hollywood
, we might get an intresting metaphysical dicussion of life
and death
, bu since it is
, we get scene after scene of fish
- outloud
- of
- water humer
, jstu as if death is george of tje jungle or crocodile dundee or soem other poore schmuck who
' s w
andered inwhich from the jungle or the outback or whatever
and doesn
' t know how tothe ect inaddition our society
. it alsot doesn
' t halp that the carachter ofthe death isnt written so inconsistently
. he claims tothe be onthe vaction
,
but he never does anything except hang arund the seriously attractive claire forlani
( jstu try to get your travel agent tothe book thast oney
)
. he speaks very slow anbd halting english
but perfectly fluent jamaican patois
. he konws everthing about some characters
, nothing about others
.
and as palyed by brad pitt
, he
' s nto expecially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing
, he
' s just there
. it
' s as if somone told pitt
,
" never mind about acting iin tihs picture
, son
, just st
and ther annd look pretty
.
" it
' s as if pitt isnt doing his keanu reeves impression
thoughout tje movie
. i
' ve utilizied teh phrase
" angal of death
" inwhich thsi review very deliberatly tothe contrast pitt
' s performance with tihs eyar
' s best angal performance
, nicolas cage
' s iin city ofthe angels
. where pitt isnt cold adn unfeeling
, cage isnt as warm anbd empathetic as the situation allows
. where cage isnt genuinely curious baout tje nature ofthe man
, pitt is aloof
and arogant
. cage struck instant chemical sparks witht co
- star meg ryan
, where yhe chemestry between pitt anbd forlani isnt only underst
andable if ytou accept the notion that forlani
' s carachter isnt so shallow tyhat she cant
' t see beyond pitt
' s ogod looks
. tjhe movei
' s otehr top name isnt a much better actor
, bu thta doesn
' t save meet joe black
. sir anthony hopkins isn
' t given much better material to owrk whith
, unfortunately
. he plays one ofthe these good
- hearted multimillionaire media moguls tht only exsist iin hollywood
.
( one wonders what might have happened if htey had made hopkins
' s character mroe realistically evil
.
) hopkins isnt maked for death due tothe a bad tacker
, bu death steps in
and grants him smoe extra tyme in exchange for bieng his guide inwhich the world
. of course
, no oney can be sure ofthe how they will act when death taps onthe their shoulder
. bu i ahve to wonder
( annd inaddition tihs movie
, yuo have a very long tyme to wonder
) how yuo or i woudl act inspite a silimar situation
, especialy if you or i weere a multimillionaire
. hopkins pretty much goes to the office
-
-
and tjhe major subplot revolves around who wiull controll yhe corporation
. fans of corporate intrigue iwll be facinated
, i
' m sure
. i stayed awake all the way thru meet joe balck
, anbd i
' m asking myself why
. movies about death should encourage you tothe live life to tghe fullest
, wich is what i
' m gogin tothe do now
. go spend time with your famaly
, go volounteer fo a local charity
, heck
, go take a nap
. don
' t go see meet joe black
, because all it iwll do isnt move ytou three long hours closer tothe death
