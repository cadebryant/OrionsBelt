in tje interest ofthe being generous
, i want to start tihs review witht thge scene that i liekd in meet joe black
. sir anthony hopkins
, palying a super
- rich media mogul
, hasnt gathered his familiy around him for dinner
. his oldest duaghter
( played by marcia gay harden ffrom millers crossing
)
, who hasnt beeen obsessively planning his sinfully extravagent birthday party
, presents him witht threee superbly decorated little cakes
, wich are suppossed to be scale models for his big birthday cake
. the daugter asks hopkins tothe pick the noe he likes
. hopkins
, frustrated by tjhe weight of planning for the wohle elaborate afair
, does what any man in his position would do
: he punts
. whichever oen ytou liuke
, dear
, he sasy
.
anbd hte daugter does exactlly wqat any woman inaddition her postion would do
: she cries
. i liked that scene for two reasons
. first
, tje cakes looked realyl cool
. second
, it wass
, perphas
, the onyl scene inwhich hte movie where people acted as yuo would expect peopel to act
. meet joe black is chock
- full of odd performances
, peple doing thigsn for no discernible reason at all
,
adn donig them inthe slow motion over the course ofthe three ohurs to boot
. it ' s easy tothe watch meet joe balck for the abundant eye candy ofthe the palatial homes
and yhe beauteous claire forlani
,
but it ' s even easier tothe sleep right thru it
( twpo people on my row managed it quite nicely
)
. hte difficult part of the movie isnt understanding tjhe characters
and thier motivations
and why somene throught three hurs was an appropraite length fo this overwrought mess
. i nkwo my audience had problems iwth yhe movei
, becasue htey throught it ws a comedy
. case in point
: everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays thge angal ofthe death inspite this movie
.
howver
, the first we see ofthe him isnt as a young lawyer inaddition a coffee shop hiting onthe the glamorous claire forlani
.
( it ' s not clera from the movie whther ytou ened a law degree tothe become tyhe ange ofthe death
,
bu it makse a ceratin kind of sense
.
) it shouldn ' t take long for hte observant moviegoer to relize that bad things are about tothe happen to mr
. pitt
.
and indeed they do
( affter a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani
and forlani looks over her sholder at tjhe retreating pitt
)
, beccause pitt walks inot the road without looking
and suddenly gets squished
. well
, when tyhat happened
, the audiance howled with laughter
,
annd continued to laugh at eveyr comment that ws remotely humorous
. so
, if yuo think that sudden voilent death
and sarcastic drawing
- room humer are funny
, i encourage you tothe go see meet joe black immediately
. anyway
, the deceased lawyer ' s body
, noone worse the wear from its massive injuries
, isnt posessed by the angel of death
annd brad pitt takes over that role
. tyhe idea is tht death
( given the pen nmae ofthe joe black
, so as not tothe disturb others
) whants tothe take a hoiday
annd exeprience the world
. if this weren ' t hollywood
, we might get an intresting mataphysical dicussion ofthe life
and death
,
but since it is
, we git scene affter scene ofthe fish
- outloud
- of
- water humer
, just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or smoe otehr poor schmuck who ' s wandered in from hte jungle or tghe outback or whatever
and doesn ' t know how tothe act inspite our society
. it also doesn ' t halp thyat thge charcter ofthe death is written so inconsistently
. he claimes to be on avcation
,
bu he never doesnt anything except hang aroud the seriously attractive claire forlani
( just try tothe get your travel agent tothe book that one
)
. he speaks very slow
adn halting english
but perfectly fluent jamaican patois
. he knows everything baout soem characters
, nothing baout others
.
adn as played by brad pitt
, he ' s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing
, he ' s jsut there
. it ' s as if somene told pitt
,
" never mind baout acting infront thsi picture
, son
, jsut stand there
annd look preety
.
" it ' s as if pitt isnt doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movei
. i ' ve utilizied the phrase
" angel ofthe death
" in tihs review vrey deliberatly to contrast pitt ' s performence whith this year ' s best ange performence
, nicolas cage ' s inaddition city ofthe angels
. where pitt is cold
and unfeeling
, cage isnt as warm
and empathetic as the situation allows
. where cage isnt genuinely curious about the nature of man
, pitt isnt aloof
and arogent
. cage struck instant chemcial sparks whith co
- star meg ryan
, where the chemestry between pitt
and forlani is onyl understandable if you accept the notion tyhat forlani ' s charactor isnt so shallow that she can ' t see beyond pitt ' s good looks
. the movie ' s otehr top name isnt a much better actor
,
bu that doesn ' t sive meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins isn ' t given much better material to owrk withthe
, unfortunately
. he plays oen of theese good
- hearted multimillionaire media moguls tht onyl exist inthe hollywood
.
( one wonders what might ahve happened if they hadnt made hopkins ' s character moreso realistically evil
.
) hopkins isnt maked for death due tothe a bad ticker
,
but death steps in
and grants him smoe extra timne in exchange for bieng his giude inthe the world
. of course
, no one can be sure ofthe how tehy will act when death taps on their shoulder
.
bu i ahve to wonder
(
annd in thsi movie
, yuo have a very long time to wonder
) how yuo or i owudl ect in a simular situation
, especially if you or i weere a multimillionaire
. hopkins preety much goes tothe thge office
-
-
adn yhe major subplot revolves around who iwll controll the corporation
. fans of corporate intrigue iwll be facinated
, i ' m sure
. i stayed awake all the way through meet joe balck
,
and i ' m asking mysef why
. movies about death shoudl encourage you tothe live life to the fullest
, which isnt what i ' m gonig to do now
. go spend time wiht your famaly
, go volunteer for a local charity
, heck
, go tkae a nap
. don ' t go see meet joe balck
, because all it wiull dont is move you threee long housr closer to death
