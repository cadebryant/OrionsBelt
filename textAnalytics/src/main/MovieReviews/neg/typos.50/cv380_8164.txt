i want tothe be involved inspite show busineses oen day
. anbd i refuse to do any sequels tothe any movie i may make because i belivee they onyl get worse
. htis movie proves it forthe me
. i ws a littel worried baout thte last batman film
, as i throught joel schumaccer
, tkaing over fomr tim burton
, woudl scre it up
. i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne
. htey didn
' t
. kilmer doed a ogod job
,
and yhe cast wass left tothe carry the movei
, which htey did
( even jim carrey as the riddler anbd i can
' t st
and jim carrey
)
, because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham anbd his awkward camera angles
. thsi film is different
. the cast isnt still impressive
,
but here
, nto only doens schumaccer mess uv with the direction
( he
' s one ofthe those directors who
' s good with actors
, terrible withthe camera angles
)
, bu writter akiva goldsmith doesn
' t really give an impressive cast anytying to dont
. the casted isnt impressive
: clooney is a surprizingly ogod wayne
/ batman
, o
' donnell is a crafty robin as usual
, tehy sould
' ve casted somebody better as batgirl
( my friend likes neve campbell
)
,
but silverstone isnt nto bad
, anbd thurman isnt a ogod poison ivy
. yhe major probelm is schwarzenegger
, who is a terrible freeze
. his accent isnt so heavy
, you cant
' t underst
and wqat he says
,
and the trouble with acation stars like him is htey cannot act
, annd they know it
, bu they figure that if htey flex theri muscles
, say a limited ammount ofthe stuff
,
and kill a bunch ofthe guys
,
then they figure nobody
' ll notice
. that
' s the trouble whith me
,
* i
* notice
. schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney
, or as much mney as he got for thsi
,
but hollywood thikns he doesnt
. patrick stewart was yhe person i
' d heard that ws considered tothe play freeze
, anbd he would
' ve beeen so much better
. or sean connery
, bu nto arnold
" i
' m nto an actro
,
but i play noe in rela life
" schwarzenegger
. i realize that you must be a star tothe play a major role in a batman film
,
but it would
' ve been nice if htey
' d casted a star that hadnt talent fo the role
. akiva goldsmith
' s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens inspite a normal batman film
. infront a regular batman film
, they
' d concentrte on the relationship wih tghe girlfriend a littel moreso
,
but elle macpherson
' s julie madison is so limited here thyat we never git a rela sence of who she isnt
. there isnt talk ofthe a fifth batman movie
. my intrest tothe see it isnt low
, bu i hope it
' s better than this
. if ytou don
' t watn tothe waste your timne
, rent any of the otehr batman movies fomr blockbuster
. any other
.
