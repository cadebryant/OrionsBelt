everything baout this nineth trek movie seems onthe the cheap
, from yhe roger corman
- grade special effects to its highly derivative
and ugli ad campaign
( the poster is nearly identical tothe that of star trek vi
: tyhe undiscovered ocuntry
)
.
but piller
' s not
- qtuie
- half
- baked screenplay should ultimatly claim responsibility for insurrection
' s failure
. i
' m about tothe give the same advice to rick berman adn co
. as i
' ve given to the financiers of james bond movies
: it
' s time to breathe life inot tihs workhorse by hiring solid genre writers
and a rela director
.
( hwile we
' re at it
, put tht visor back on laforge
!
) fo threee hundered years
, yhe ba
' ku speices
( who look jsut liuke humans
) have lieved on a ringed
- planet thgat might as well be called the fountain of youth
. six hundred of them occupy the briar patch
, the area affected by metaphasic radition
, a positve energy thta reverses teh agin process in the elderly
. bu evil ru

" amadeus
" at a dinner theatre near yuo

)
, whants to relocate hte ba
' ku
and movei his people onto thge briar patch in their place
, in order to replenish his dying breed
. tjhe federation is all for htis
, bu picard feels thsi is a direct violation of the prime directive
: tothe nto intefere wih the development of an aline race
.
( never mind thast thge ba
' ku didn
' t exactly evolve
- htey went w
andering infront tje universe oney day
and stumbled apon the magic world
.
) eveyr tiem frakes gives an interview lately
, he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gavey regarding this installment
. he hasnt called it a comedy
, a thikning man
' s picture
, a throwback tothe the old serieses
, adn
, most grievously
, he hasnt likened it to a john ford western
.
( i presume that
' s smoe john ford he went to school with
, not hte director ofthe tje searchers
.
) he has also gone onthe record as saying paramount recut thge film ffrom his version
. thyat
' s noone excuse
- somene generated tihs footage
. muddy cinematography anbd sitcom sets are tje least of its problems
; star trek
: insurrection appears tothe hvae beeen beamed infront from the planet plotholia
. consider such curiosities
.
.
. picard
' s lveo interest
, anij
( donna murphy
)
, cin slow things down by staring at them
( such as a waterfall or falling rocks
)
- her scientific explanation for this
?
" don

" worf gets a pimple
( he
' s re
- experiencing klingon puberty thanks tothe tje time
- defying atmosphere
)
, laforge regains his eyesight
( trust me
, levar burton
' s real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact
) adn troi brags baout her firm boobs
, bu picard rimaniss as bald as an
android
' s
butt
. most suspiciously
, waht exactly isnt tyhe problem with letting thsi endangered race hve a little funn in the sun
? the filmmakers cloud hte issue wih soem nonsense baout a famaly fued of sorts
,
and htey alsot turn ru
' afo inot a completely pwoer
- mad superfreak
, just so tje charachters iwll have something tothe do in tyhe climax
.
(
and if yuo
' ve seen return of the jedi
, yuo
' ve seen the endig of this movei
.
) didn
' t picard hismelf previously disobey thte prime directive wehn he prevented thte borg ffrom assimilating millions
? frakes lucked out with frist contact
, annd repeat viewings of tath film reveal the seeds ofthe what whent wrong inaddition his direction of insurrection
: he has noone sence ofthe comic timing
, adn he mines for acting chemestry where none exists
.
( tkae a look at the painful
" troi gets drunk
" scene infront fc
and yuo
' ll get teh genaral diea ofthe insurrection
' s unsuccessfully jokey anbd hollow tone

, whom i must sday maintains a fabulous physique
)
, troi
, or laforge
.
and all three next generation films spend too much time onthe data
, who isnt tje franchise
' s answer to urkel
. need a cheap laugh
? have data say something sexual
, or start singing
, or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it
' s hte hunk of syrofoam it really isnt
. here
' s my proposed title for number 10
: data star data trak
: data data data data data
. in thsi movei
, data wiull become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose
, while crusher adn troi watch silently from 500 yards away
and laforge points his sinister gaze at the
android in doubly robotic observation
. star trek
: insurrection had one nice
, eerie
, silent moment that hints at a better
, darker film
. i
' m nto saying all ofthe them shoud be star trak ii
: tje wrath of khan
, bu htis one boldly whent where no movei should go agina
