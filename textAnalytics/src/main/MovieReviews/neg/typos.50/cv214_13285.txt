forthe a good ten years or so
, super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in thte hong kong acation scene
. now
, he has folowed inwhich hte footsteps of director john woo
,
( who launched chow
' s super stardom in the acclaimed
' a better tommorow
'
) by moving to hollywood
. i had smoe reservations about htis move
and it would seem i was right tothe ahve them
. chow plays a hitman who isnt doign jobs in order tothe repay a debt
. his fianl job requires him to kill a policeman
' s seven year old boy
. tihs he refuses do
and runs
. howver
, he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned
and replacement killers are brought inthe to dont tyhe job
. cue around 80 mintues of varous
and quite frankly tedious shoot
- outs hwihc take place infront vairous locations
. soem throught had gone into making them a bit diferrent bu unfortunatly tehy end uv being jstu plain boring
. the car wash scene
, i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked
. tut tut
. the emphasis durig hte constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music
,
( i coudl hvea sworn noe peice ws ripped out of a bruckheimer movie
)
and nto on the content
. mia sorvino
( a passport forger
) isnt dragged into the affay
and also provides a lame love interest as well as bieng rather h
andy with a gun
. directer antoine arqua has clearly nto observed chow
' s excellant acting capabilties adn simpley requires him to mutter a fewd lines ofthe broken english adn look flash as he st
ands
and shoots
. chow
' s trademark ofthe twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale
( which in fairness is quite good
) anbd ther
' s not even a toothpick in site
.
and as forthe makeing chow shoot like a cop
, well that
' s damned unforgiveable
. to round uv
, hte relpacement killers isnt a preety darned lame first outing fo chow
. it owudl appear he hasnt left asia for a 90 minute pop video
. this isnt nto what we wanted at all
, concidering john woo was tghe exec producer
.
( did he have noone sday so at all
?
) watch
' the killer
' again
and weep at the diference

' s room at tjhe top
