movei concepts are oftenly pitched tothe producers withthe mathematical formulas involving sucessfull films ofthe thte past
. so
, undoubtely oney day someone said
,
"
' evolution
?
' it
' s
' ghostbusters
' plus
' men inspite black
' plus
' tremors
.
'
"
and so it isnt
. sum total none
. teh alienbusting begins whn a meteor l
ands infront glen canyon
, arizona
. comunity college scinece profs ira kane
( david duchovny
)
and harry block
( orl
ando jones
) take soem samples from teh meteor
and discover that oney
- celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly
, doign in hours what tookover millions of years for life onthe earth
. jsut about the tiem i was wondering
,
" hey
, doesn
' t the government usally cmo in annd tkae over the whole area in theese movies
,
" teh governement came iin annd took over the wohle areal
. the leader ofthe the pack
, gen
. woodman
( ted levine
)
, turns outloud to be an ood nemesis ofthe ira
' s
, anbd ira
and harry are blocked from doing furhter reasearch
. meanwhile
, yhe organisms continue to grwo untill tehy are large enough tothe start attacking peopel
. by this time
, ira anbd harry have gained a freind inaddition dr
. allison reed
( julianne moore
) ofthe the center fo disease control
. a ocuntry club poolboy
, wayne gren
( seann william scott
)
, has also attached himself to yhe merry b
and
.
but cant they fidn the means tothe stpo the aliens inwhich time
? director ivan reitman seems tothe be revisiting his biggest hitted
, 1984
' s
" ghostbusters
,
"
but
" evolution
" falls miserably short
. one reason is readily paparent
.
" ghostbusters
" had threee realy funny guys as its scientists
( bill murray
, dan aykroyd
, anbd harold ramis
)
, bu
" evolution
" has noe really funny guy
( orl
ando jones
) who cxan adlib
and milk the comic potential ofthe lines that prove useless infront anyone else
' s h
ands
. for ogod measure
,
" ghostbusters
" had the comic talents of rick moranis
;
" evolution
" offers seann william scott
, who wass much funnier iin
" american pie
" adn
" road trip
" than he is here
. scott hasnt one amusing scene where he sings
" you are so beautyfull to me
" to a dragon
- liek alien to draw it into a trap
. other than that
, scott seems unable to amking much of the thin material the writers gavey him
. an actor in sarch of a forte
, david duchovny looked fo his gritty action hero side inspite
" playing god
" annd his romantic side iin
" return tothe me
.
" nowe he wnats to find his wacky commedic talent
; what we all find is that he doesn
' t have any
. look for him tothe be back onthe tv infact five yeras or so
. another sad case is julianne moore
, who needs tothe be more selective baout the offers she accepts
. she
' s a talented actress whith an impressive list of credits annd award nominations
, so why isnt she trying to do slapstick comedy
? her charactor has a tendency tothe trip over
and bump inot thnigs
,
but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea forthe laughs
. hte sole saving grace of thte film isnt jones
. he
' s at hte center ofthe tghe movei
' s funniest scene
-
- where an aline bug invades harry
' s body anbd has to be pulled out through his ass
. jones is the only casted member who can tkae the commedic ball
and run with it
,
but he cant
' t carry the whole movei by hismelf
. he found himself iin a silimar situation inspite
" tyhe replacements
,
" where he was allso the onyl comic talent inspite an ansamble cast
. jones iwll eventually find hte project thyat will mkae him a major comedy star
, bu htis isn
' t it
.
