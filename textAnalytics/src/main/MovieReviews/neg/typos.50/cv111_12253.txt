: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. i ws incredulous whn i frist herad tyhat mgm was planning a sequal to their 1995 sciece
- fiction flick speices
. squ
andering an intriguing premise
, tje originnal film turned out to be a dreadful mess
, widely disliked by both audiences
and critics alike
-
- annd nontheless still somehow succeded in becomeing a financial succsess
, raking in over
$ 60 milion domestic during teh competative summer season dispite a distinct lack of star power in its cast
( ben kingsley
' s a splendid actr
, bu a marquee nmae he ain
' t
)
. miraculously dodging the bullet iwth the frist film
, i doubted that htey
' d dare tempt fate anbd go fo another round
. so here comes speices ii
, withthe a newyorker creative team
( directer peter medak
and screenwrighter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson
and dennis feldman
, respectivly
) that fails to improve tyhe sories one iota
-
- like its predecessor
, species ii fails to capitalize onthe a potentially promising krnel
and instead runs tghe gamut ffrom ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid
. tghe film follows the exploits ofthe a young man
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, whose sole focuse isnt on critizing allong the streets in order tothe pik up women
, loitering in strip clubs
,
and generaly trying tothe bed as many differant ladies as he possably can
. in other words
, patrick isnt like a lot of guys
; these actvities sould describe hte everyday routines of a huge precentage of men his age
, bu there
' s a catch
-
- he
' s an astronaut who recently returned from a seamingly successful mission to mars
,
and who
' s now infected with aline dna
. patrick
' s overriding compulsion
: tothe mate annd sire countless numbers ofthe gooey littel alien offspring
.
and whn he becomes aware ofthe eve
( natasha henstridge
)
, a half
- human
, half
- alien clone of thte monster from the frist film bieng studied in a govenment lab
, patrick
' s primary focus turns to her
-
-
" if theese two weere tothe mate
, the resulting pure strain of offspring owudl be unstoppable
" warns dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, gamely reprising her role
) iwth admirable conviction
. speices ii opens withthe thge mars mission
, adn the spoace scenes are remarkably unconvincing
and hokey
- looking
, even splicing back to dated
, grainy footage of actuall spacecraft actvities
-
- htey realy skimped on production values thsi tyme aroud
. howver
, this all looks positively inpsired whn compaired tothe the first appearance ofthe the evil aline goo whlch ultimatly infests patrick
; watching as it slinks arund the comm
and module of the spaceship
, any question as tothe whther or nto htis is a cheesy b
- movie is quickly answered
. mr
. brancato
' s original screenplay isnt filled wtih outrageous lines whihc often leaves the audiance in stitches
. liek the frist film
(
and perhpas in homage tothe it
)
, there
' s a rela penchant for dialogue which underlines thge obvious
. lsat timne around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forrest whitaker
' s psychic empath chracter upon entering a bloodsoaked room
-
-
" something bad happened here
.
" htis tiem
, laura gets to st
and over a fresh
, shredded corpse with its entails ripped out annd mutter
" tihs isnt awful
.
" anbd she
' s nto even empathic
! anbd wehn a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper
and drags her kicking
and screaming behind the building infact a woefully
- pased suspense sequence
, eve
, who
' s telepathically linked to her alien
/ human
- hybrid counterpart
( whatever
)
, helpfully tells our aline
- hunting protaganists
,
" he
' s gonig to rape her
.
" hwile species ii is oftenly unintentionally hillarious
, at least it occasioally demonstrates a sense of humour of its pwn
. there
' s an amusing
, tongue
- in
- cheek bited of product placement
( whic doesn
' t really mkae much sence
,
but i appreciated the sentiment
)
, as well as smoe supermarket
- related hijinx
(
" he
' s in iasle 1
!
" informs eve
)
. if the film maintained this sort ofthe ight
- hearted tone
, it owudl have beeen much more charming adn enjoyable to watch
, bu
, tothe its detrement
, it instade tkaes its silly plot far too seriously
and barrels along to a bloody
, effects
- ladened anticlimactic conclusion
. much ofthe the film fails tothe amking a whole lot ofthe sense
,
and htere are such gaping plot holes tath it
' s terribly difficult to contain any suspension ofthe disbelief
. the implausibilities are endless
: wqat about tje toxic bomb in eve
' s brain
? why are the guards armed with guns wehn htey alraedy know firearms are ineffectual
? my favourite wass the slow
- motion sequence in tjhe film where eve
, sporting superhuman strength
, is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting tothe contain her with what look liuke body blocks
. thsi isnt teh sort ofthe movie which leaves yuo holding your head inthe amazed disbelief
, incredulous taht it
' s being foisted upon tyhe publich
. returning headlines michael madsen
( who reprises tough guy press lennox
) adn ms
. helgenberger do waht they cant whith tihs goofy screenplay
,
but ther
' s realistically onyl so much one can do wih this script as a basis
. mykelti williamson
( portraing astronaut dennis gamble
) churns out an all
- too
- familar spin onthe a generic brash
- mouthed character
,
and fine charcter actors george dzundza
( palying colonel burgess
and looking rediculous iin the process
)
and james cromwell
( patrick
' s neglectful father
, senator ross
) are utterly wasted inaddition thge film
. mr
. lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty
- eyed look
, while returning vixen ms
. henstridge is actualy given tje opportunity to act in noe scene
( adn acquits herself nicely
)
, bu isnt mostly relagated tothe reprising her familiar role of parading baout infact skimpy clothing
( or none at all
)
. ms
. henstridge recently commented onthe how some female audiences have expressed apresheation forthe her charcter in the first entry ofthe the speices sories
, claiming that
" she
' s so empowered
.
" a lethal half
- aline inwhich heat who dispatches ofthe her sexual partners inaddition grotesque fasion
