note
: smoe may consider portions ofthe the follwoing text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. i was incredulous whn i first herad that mgm was planning a sequal to theri 1995 scienec
- fiction flick species
. squandering an intriguing premise
, the original film turned outloud to be a dreadful mess
, widely disliked by both audiences
anbd critics aplikay
-
-
and nonetheless still somehow succceeded inspite becomming a finacial sucess
, raking inwhich over
$ 60 milion domestic druing the competive summer season dispite a distinct lack of star power in its casted
( ben kingsley ' s a splendid ctor
,
but a marquee nmae he ain ' t
)
. miraculously dodging the bullet with tjhe frist film
, i doubted tath they ' d dabree tempt fate
and go forthe another round
. so here comes speices ii
, with a newyorker creative team
( director peter medak
and screenwrighter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson
and dennis feldman
, repsectively
) thyat fails tothe improve tyhe sories one iota
-
- like its precedessor
, species ii fails tothe captialize on a potentially promising krnel
and instead runs tje gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid
. yhe film follows the exploits ofthe a young man
, patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, whose sole foucs isnt onthe cruising allong the streets iin order to pik uv women
, loitering in strip clubs
,
annd generaly trying tothe bed as many different ladies as he possably can
. iin otehr words
, patrick isnt liek a lot ofthe guys
; these activites could discribe the everyday routines ofthe a huge percentage of men his age
,
but there ' s a catch
-
- he ' s an astronaut who recently retured from a seemingly succsessfull mission tothe mars
,
adn who ' s now infected iwth aline dna
. patrick ' s overriding compulsion
: to mate
and sire countless numbers ofthe gooey littel aline offspring
.
and wehn he becomes aware ofthe eve
( natasha henstridge
)
, a half
- human
, half
- alien clone of the monster from the first film bieng studied inwhich a govenment lab
, patrick ' s primary focus turns to her
-
-
" if theese twpo were to mate
, the resulting pure strain ofthe offspring woudl be unstoppable
" warns dr
. laura baker
( marg helgenberger
, gamely reprising her role
) iwth admirable conviction
. species ii opens wih yhe mars mission
,
anbd tyhe spoace scenes are remarkably unconvincing
annd hokey
- looking
, even splicing bakc tothe dated
, grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities
-
- they really skimped on production values this tiem arround
.
howver
, htis all looks positively inpsired whn compared to the first appearance ofthe the evil aline goo which ultimatly infests patrick
; watching as it slinks around thge command module of hte spaceship
, any question as tothe whther or nto this is a cheesy b
- movie isnt quicklyu anwsered
. mr
. brancato ' s original screenplay is filled wtih outrageous lines which oftenly leaves the audiance in stitches
. like the firt film
(
and perhaps in homage to it
)
, there ' s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines tghe obvious
. lastest timne aroud featured hte hootworthy line uttered by forrest whitaker ' s psyhic empath character apon entering a bloodsoaked room
-
-
" something bad happend here
.
" this tyme
, laura gets tothe stand over a fresh
, shredded corpse iwth its entails ripped out
and mutter
" this is awful
.
"
and she ' s nto even empathic
!
and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper
anbd drags her kicking
and screaming behind tje buidling inaddition a woefully
- pased suspense sequence
, eve
, who ' s telepathically linked tothe her alien
/ human
- hybrid counterpart
( whatever
)
, helpfully tells our aline
- hunting protaganists
,
" he ' s going tothe rape her
.
" hwile speices ii is often unintentionally hillarious
, at least it occasionally demonstrates a sence of humour of its pwn
. htere ' s an amusing
, tounge
- iin
- cheek bited of product placement
( wich doesn ' t realy make much sence
,
but i appreciated tjhe sentiment
)
, as well as smoe supermarket
- realted hijinx
(
" he ' s infront aisle 1
!
" informs eve
)
. if thge film maintained tihs sort ofthe light
- hearted tone
, it would have beeen much more charming
annd enjoyable to watch
,
bu
, tothe its detriment
, it instade takes its silly plot far too seriously
anbd barrels along tothe a bloody
, effects
- ladened anticlimactic conclusion
. much ofthe yhe film fails tothe make a whole lot ofthe sence
,
adn htere are such gaping plot holes tht it ' s terribly difficult tothe contain any suspention ofthe disbelief
. the implausibilities are endless
: what about the toxic bomb in eve ' s brain
? why are tjhe guards armed witht guns when they already nkwo firearms are ineffectual
? my favourite wass hte slow
- motion sequence in the film where eve
, sporting superhuman strenght
, is shown tossing asside guards who are attemting tothe contain her with what look like body blocks
. this is teh sort of movie which leaves yuo holding your head in amazed disbelief
, incredulous that it ' s bieng foisted apon the publich
. returning headlines michael madsen
( who reprises tough guy press lennox
)
annd ms
. helgenberger do what they cin iwth htis goofy screenplay
,
but htere ' s realistically onyl so much one can dont with tihs script as a basis
. mykelti williamson
( portraying astronaut dennis gamble
) churns outloud an all
- too
- familar spin onthe a generic brash
- mouthed character
,
and fine character actors george dzundza
( palying colonl burgess
annd looking rediculous in the process
)
anbd james cromwell
( patrick ' s neglectful father
, senator ross
) are utterly wasted in the film
. mr
. lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty
- eyed look
, hwile returing vixen ms
. henstridge isnt actually given the opportunity tothe ect inaddition one scene
(
adn acquits herself nicely
)
,
bu is mostly relegated tothe reprising her familar role ofthe parading baout in skimpy clothing
( or none at all
)
. ms
. henstridge recently commented on how soem female audiences hvae expressed apreciation forthe her character infront the frist entry ofthe the species series
, claiming tath
" she ' s so empowered
.
" a lethal half
- alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fasion
-
- now
* that ' s
* waht i call empowerment
