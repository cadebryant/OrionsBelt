adam s
andler vehicles are never anything special
,
but continue tothe make a load of monay
. whcih really goes tothe show the sad state of cinema todya
. hwile ogod comedies liek rushmore
, tothe choose a recent exemple
, gets limited release annd doesn
' t make a lot ofthe monay
, big daddy got a huge release
and has made a lot of cash
. it
' s allso nothing special anbd doesn
' t deserve the money it
' s making
.
but i digress
. s
andler plays sonny koufax
, a unemployed newyorker yorker iwth a seemingly low mental age
. his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him
: eather wise uv adn git responsible
, or she
' s leaving him
. by a stange setted ofthe events
, koufax ends up with julian
( played by twins cole
and dylan sprouse
) a five yearm old kid
. after a failed atempt tothe impress his girlfriend wtih the child
, koufax decides he wants to keep hte child
.
however
, social worker mr brooks
( mostel
) finds out taht koufax isn
' t thge real father anbd wnats to take julian back
. koufax allong wih his newyorker girlfriend layla
( lauren adams
) fight tothe keep the child
. big daddy realy isn
' t thyat good
. many ofthe thge jokes revolve aroud toilet humour
, annd supposably we are meaned tothe find julian
and sonny peeing against a wall tothe be funny
. there
' s tyhe occasional ogod oney liner
,
but these are usually strangely delivered wrong
and lose most ofthe thte humour
. the film
, after all theese silly gags
,
then suddenly turns sentimental
,
and this is where big daddy really goes from bad tothe hideous
. the court scene at the end of tjhe film isnt useless adn unbeleivable
,
and nto helpped by the suppy overacting
. it
' s a poore attept tothe win over the audiance
. adam s
andler basically plays tyhe smae role he has inwhich his lastest few films
( exept the wedding singer
.
) joey lauren adams isnt much
, much better
,
and deserves a far better film thna htis trash
. steve buscemi pops uv in a funny cameo
, adn his scenes are pretty funny
. rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man
. the two twins who play julian are o
. k
, they strat outloud rether well
, bu
then becomming annoying anbd brattish halfway through anbd finally turn
' all american
' wholesome goodness at the end ofthe the film
, where thge tear juice isnt turned uv high
. big daddy is realy nothing special
,
and is not even worth it for a few chuckles
.
al
though it isnt accually well put together
, witht nice direction
, ogod production design
and even some montages
, tihs professionalism cant
' t help teh fact tht tjhe scirpt anbd characters are trash
. big daddy is for dieu hard fans of s
andler
, anbd that
' s about it
.
