affter 1993
' s
" falling down
,
" i hoped thta joel schumacher owudl mature inot a great directer
. sicne hten he hasnt offered us two so
- so adaptations ofthe john grisham novels
(
" the client
" annd
" a timne to kill
"
)
and twpo batman movies thyat lowered the st
andards of thyat franchise
.
al
though these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm fo schumacher
' s potential
, the publicity for his latest release
,
" 8mm
,
" rised new hope
. it promised to be something unusual
. it wasn
' t
. the plot goes like tihs
: toom welles
( nicolas cage
) isnt a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman
, allegorically named mrs
. christian
( myra carter
)
, to investingate an 8mm movei foudn among her lite husb
and
' s belongings
. hte movie appears tothe be a snuff film in which a teenage girl isnt raped adn murdered by a man in a leather mask
( who reminds me of bane in schumacher
' s
" batman
& robin
"
)
. because murders can be realistically simulated in movies
, mrs
. christian wants tom tothe dicover if teh girl isnt alive or dead
. by combing through missing persons reports
, toom finds the girl
' s nmae annd tracks her to los angeles
. withthe thte aid ofthe max califronia
( joaquin pheonix
)
, a video store clerk
(
and anohter symbolical name
)
, toom w
anders thru the underworld ofthe pornography in search of snuff
. thge plot bears an obvious resembelance to paul schrader
' s
" hardcore
,
" inaddition which a father goes deeper
and deeper into the industries ofthe porn
and sex to find his missing daughter
. both films are modeled on dante
' s
" hte inferno
,
" of course
;
" 8mm
" mkaes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil adn haveing him constanly tell toom tyhat htey were heading towrad a meeting with the devil
.
" hardcore
" is a much more subtle
and meaningfull film
.
" 8mm
" hadnt a lot ofthe promise
. in its better moments it
' s an examination of violence as enteratinment
and ofthe tyhe beast within even a nice guy like tom
. one moment of the first sort
: wehn we first meet max he
' s reading truman capote
' s
" inaddition cold blood
" underneath tjhe cover of a porn novel
.
" in cold blood
" was thge father ofthe thge true
- crime genre
, which is the literary equivelant of snuff films
. max promises tht we will see examples ofthe tyhe second theme wehn he tells toom
,
" dance with tyhe devil anbd the devil don
' t chanage
; the devil changes you
.
" tom does change
- i
' ll let ytou discover the specifics for yourself
- bu nto permenantly
. schumacher
and screenwriter
andrew kevin walker didn
' t hvea the guts to take toom so far down the dark tunnel thyat he couldn
' t come back
.
( walker
' s
" seven
" did a much better job on thast theme by refusing tothe compromize
)
. cage trys hard to pul it off
,
but the script doesn
' t give him enought to work with
. phoenix walks awya with the movei
- he
' s smart
, charming
,
and funny
. otehr cast munbers inlcude
" fargo
"
' s peter stormare camping it uv as porn auteur dino velvet anbd
" the sopranos
"
' s james g
andolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far
. in the lsat anaylsis
, usance
" 8mm
" falls short of its pretensions
and its promise
, its just anyother private eye stoy inspite teh raymond ch
andler
/ ross macdonald tradition of having tghe detective uncover the depravity behind yhe glossy facade ofthe wealth adn rivilege
. howver
, unlike otehr predicatble fare infact the genre
- last year
' s
" twilight
,
" forthe example
-
" 8mm
" is expecially disapointing because it sould hvae been much omre tahn it is
.
