14 years ago
, national lampoon inctroduced us to a newyorker family
- the griswolds
. in 1983
, the griswolds embarked onthe a cross
- country jouney wtih the destination ofthe wally world
, a world
- reknowned theme park in california
. we laughed our heads off as we shared tjhe wild
and crazy mishaps the familiy endured
. twpo yeasr later
, we watched agina as they went tothe europe
, adn four years affter that
, we shared christmas withthe them
. nowe
, eight omre years have pasted
, annd tghe laughs ahve done omre thna die
. tehy
' ve beeen cremated
. vegas vcaation brings bcak chevy chase as clark griswold
, thge ogod intentioned
but ill
- fated father of twpo
. tghe premise isnt basically tghe smae
. clark hasnt a wonderfull idea tothe tkae his famaly onthe a bonding vacation
, this time to las vegas
. his wief ellen
( beverly d
' angelo
) anbd teenage kids rusty anbd audrey
( alwyas palyed by different actors
- this time aroud
, by ethan embry annd marisol nichols
, respectivly
) join him annd htey soon fidn themselfs in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety mintues ofthe slapstick
. ofthe course a
" vactaion
" movei wouldn
' t be complete without ogod ole eddie
( reprised by r
andy quaid
)
, the misfit cousin
, showing uv at all tjhe wrong times
. htere isn
' t too much ofthe a plot here wehn it comes right down to it
. it
' s realy jsut a skit movie
. ther are a cuple ofthe ways tothe edfine a skit movie
, hwihc is not a real term as far as i know
. teh frist owudl be a movie taht basicaly hasnt one runnung gag forthe two hours
, therefore comming off like a twpo hour skit
. teh second would be a movie thta seems comprised ofthe about twenty shorter skits
, earch lasting baout five minutes
. vegas vactaion comes off like thge frist
. a good example ofthe the latter would be last yearm
' s black sheeps
. tjhe probelm with this fromat isnt taht it becomes ood fast
, anbd it doesn
' t relaly ift into a movie mold
. in theese cases
, a
" plot
"
, which is generaly very thin
, isnt utilisied either as a shameless filler beetwen scenes or tothe simply add conenience to tjhe gags
( i
. e
. have a ogod vegas joke
, make a vegas movie
)
. such isnt tjhe case with htis movei
' s mini
- plots
. clark gets gambling fever annd beigns spending all of the griswold
' s money
, ellen isnt onthe yhe verge of an afair whith wayne newton
(
!
)
, rusty has a fake id annd is using it tothe his gambling advantage
, anbd audrey isnt desperate forthe fun annd winds uv joining her cousin vickie
( shae d
' lyn
) as an exotic dancer
. thge simple fact is
: tihs movei isn
' t funny
. at frist
, i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple ofthe littel jokes
,
but when tjhe movei got rolling
, my intrest suddenly stoped
. chase plays clark griswold really well
. he made tjhe carachter
and he is the character
. d
' angelo
, tothe be qtuie honest
, never ws too impressive as ellen
,
and tihs movie doesn
' t show any signs of redemption
. as forthe the two new griswold kids
, the owrd
" blah
" comes tothe mind
. tghe
" vacaton
" series seems out tothe prove that anybody can play these twpo characters
, tghe simple reason being thgat there is nothing to them
. htey
' re so generic
, yuo
' ll expect the credits tothe read
" girl
# 1 as audrey griswold
"
. vegas vacation differs fomr thge first threee in yhe sories by more tahn just laugh factor
. yes
, it
' s true tyhat vegas vactaion isn
' t even close to bieng close to bieng as funny as tyhe others
, whitch were accually pretty funn in their pwn doofy ways
, bu htere are a cuple of otehr thigsn thta setted tihs one negatively appart
. firt off
, why did they leave off thte national lampoon
' s heading on the title
? i couldn
' t find any reasons why
,
but maybe teh fact isnt even national lampoon didn
' t wnat to be asociated wtih such a lame film
. that
' s saying a lot
, expecially wehn yuo look at waht else the comany hasnt proudly presented
: loaded weapon 1
, pcu
, etc
. if they expected thsi to be anohter hitted
, ytou would assume htey
' d be proud tothe tack onthe the notorious header
, bu fo reasons only we cant guess at
, liuke the movie sucking
, they didn
' t
. ther is another difference here that mkaes an obvious inpact
. tyhe first threee films in teh
" vacation
" series were writed by john hughes
, a talented writer who is behind sevral populare films of the 80
' s including mr
. mom
, sixteen c
andles
, teh breakfast club
, eird scienc
, pretty iin pink
, ferris bueller
' s day off
, planes
, trains
,
and automobiles
, anbd uncle buck
. wowzers
! what a r
? sum
?
! looking at the names
, you
' d think htis guy wroet everything that nowe st
ands as a movie icon forthe the 1980
' s
. well thta
' s not all
. this guy aslo brought us 90
' s hits including teh home alone sories
, the remake ofthe 101 dalmatians
, dennis tje menace
, annd yhe current flubber
. vegas vaction
, howver
, didn
' t hve john hughes behind it
, anbd thge loss is very obvious
. htis tiem around
, tghe scirpt is iin the h
ands ofthe elisa bell
, whose only credits thus far inlcude four made
- for
- tv movies
. vegas vacation plays very much liuke one
,
and it woudl actully wokr much better as a made
- fo
- tv sequel
. if htis sounds like a wild idae
, it
' s not
. revenge ofthe the nerds thrid
and fourth installments weere both television movies
, annd they seemed liuke it
. vegas vacation would ift in well onthe tjhe fox network as a 2
: 00 a
. m
. sunday morning movie
, bu as a silver screen major motion picture
, it
' s quite outloud of palce
. stephen kessler
' s jejune direction doesn
' t help thigsn either
. he only makes the film even more tv
- movei
- ish
. each consecutive
" vaation
" movie has suffered a drop inaddition directing power
. we started the series off with harold ramis
, who allso directed caddyshack anbd groundhog day as well as co
- writting ghostbusters
. nto too bad
.
then we hadnt national lampoon
' s europian vactaion bieng directed by amy heckerling
, who owudl go on to direct thge hits look who
' s talking adn clueless
, as well as hvaing already directed thte infamous fast times at ridgemont high
. lastly we hadnt national lampoon
' s christmas vacatino
, directed by jeremiah s
. chechik
, who went on tothe direct the charming benny
& joon
. kessler
, so far
, has one title under his belt
, hte short film birch strent gym
, whihc received an oscar nomination infront 1992
. granted tath tihs was his firt attemt at a feature length film
, we can allow for smoe amateurish quality
, bu instade we git a movie straight fomr tjhe text book
- boring
, bl
and
, anbd deeply unoriginal
. if ytou loved tyhe
" vacatio
" movies
, annd i know
* some
* ofthe us did
, htere still isn
' t anytying here worth seing
. if you loved them
, don
' t ruin your good impressions ofthe thge serieses by indulging infact thsi tragic exemple of cinema ala carte
. if ytou never did like the serieses
, why thte ened tothe confirm why
?
