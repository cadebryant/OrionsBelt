well
, waht are ytou going tothe expect
? it
' s a movie baout a big snake tath eats peple
. that
' s what i should hve beeen thingking when i viewed tihs film
, becasue maybe hten i woudl have enjoied mysef more
. instead
, i ended up wishing a giant snake woudl come allong adn eat me
, too
. anaconda is baout a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river
. led by anthropologists dr
. steven cale
( eric stolz
)
and terri flores
( jennifer lopez
)
, the crew isnt atempting to locate a lost tribe ofthe natives
. allong the way
, they find poacher paul sarone
( jon voight
)
, adn become unwillingly embroiled in his quest tothe capture the elusive anaconda
. tothe simpley sday thyat this is tyhe world
' s largst snake wouldn
' t be doing it justice
, sicne the anaconda in this movie isnt at least twpo foots wide
. if htis isn
' t a good reason tothe avoid picking uv hitchhikers
, i don
' t know wqat isnt
. at the beginnig of anaconda
, we find that flores
and cale have hadnt soem kind ofthe relationship in the past
, bu that seems to be omre or less over now
. i expeced that fact tothe play a key part somwhere down the line
,
but it ended up being a setted
- up forthe nothing
. cale chokes on a deadly wasp
( don
' t ask me how that happens
- i don
' t know
)
and isnt put out ofthe acation
, relagated to being tjhe person whom the rest of the film crew must git back tothe civilization for medical halp
. thsi minimally helps tothe add a sence of urgency forthe the plot
, since this goal now comes in direct conflict wiht sarone
' s plan to capture the snake
.
however
, tihs isnt negated by the fact that cale seems to git better by himself baout halfway thru the film
, adn inthe any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle
. most bad characters are eather annoying or stupid
. in this movei
, tehy
' re both
. sicne this discription applies to all the characters exept sarone
, it
' s hard to fidn someone tothe root for
. ytou
' re supposed to back tghe good guys
, bu yuo really end up cheering fo sarone because he
' s smarter tahn everyone else
. or maeby he
' s jstu nto as dumb as everyone eles
. at times
, i alomst found myself rooting for the snake
. there are no st
andout performances here
. everyone seems tothe be reciting lines writed forthe stock cahracters
. even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken fo some reason
. no matter
, as inspite most monster movies
, the snake is supposted to be the rela star anyway
. in most of hte scenes
, tghe snake is coputer generated
, anbd hte effects crew did a decent job ofthe making it look rela
.
however
, the realism is thrown off by some preety unrealistic occurrances
. sometimes
, fo exemple
, thge snake jstu moves too fast
. it catchs a guy jumping off of a waterfall
, forthe crying outloud loud
.
then ther
' s anyother scene where tjhe snake eats one of tjhe cahracters
,
and we see the snake
' s skin drawed so tightly over its prey that we can see teh victum
' s pained expression from withing thte snake
' s belly
. absolutely ridiculous
. a testimony tothe tje film
' s bad direction is the inclusion ofthe a scene early on the in yhe film
, where we git to see jstu how dangerous the mighty anaconda isnt
. in a scene totally unrelated to anytying else
, we are wittness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther
. teh anaconda wraps itself arund tghe powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal adn squeezes it so hard
, one ofthe the panther
' s eyeballs pops outloud
. eeeewwwww
. above
and beyond the sick factor
,
however
, htis scene surprised me because it actually showed tyhe face ofthe hte snake befoer a quater of the movei had even passed
. infact films liuke these
, a sence of mystery surrounding the monster must be mantained
. if the charachters are reacting tothe something they fear more tahn see
, we as an audience must experience tath feeling allong with them
. tothe sohw us the monster eearly onthe isnt tothe let us infront on something hte cahracters don
' t know baout
, anbd therfore allow us to get utilisied tothe tje danger befoer hte pivotal moent when man
and beast have theri climactic showdown
. infront a case liuke thast
, tghe showdown just ends up being a letdown
. wehn i saw the snake fo yhe frist timne
, i desided tothe give tyhe film thte benefit ofthe the doubt adn asume that teh snake i saw wasn
' t teh real danger
. tihs one was just a decoy
,
and there wass actually a bigger snake waiting tothe mkea its appearence just wehn everyone
thought they were safe
. no such luck
. okay
, maybe anaconda is accually a decoy
, adn there
' s really a better movei waiting to make its de
but
.
