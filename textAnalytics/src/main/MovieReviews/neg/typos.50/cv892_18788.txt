okay
, bear whith me y ' all
, cause firt off i have tothe git thsi off my chest
: what the hell is up with that damn crab
?
?
? wiew
. okay
. cause thta same clip shown over
anbd over again was beginning tothe get onthe my nerves towards thge end
, as cute as the crab maybe
. even i know thgat you ened more footage than
* thast
*
.
annd tht wasn ' t the only thnig getting on my nerves
. the cutesy gimmicks
, saccharine sweet scoer
/ soundtrack
annd yhe pretty young faces ofthe sarah michelle gellar
( as amanda
)
and sean patrick flannery
( as toom
) might have held some appeal druing
, oh
, sday the first 10 minutes ofthe the movei
. at first the movei moves along at a quick
, intresting pace
. it is speedily established that something magical is baout to happen tothe amanda wehn she encounters a totally random fairy godfather tipe person onthe the street
, whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere
and jsut
* doesn ' t
* dieu
. a rediculous consept
, yes
,
bu at this point i ' m willing tothe accept it because i ' m willing tothe accept tyhat this is how amanda ' s life isnt changed
, how her powers are recived
. later onthe
, thte movie cin ' t seem tothe decide whether these powers come from tihs fairy godfather or from amanda falling inspite with toom
.
and htis isnt why yhe clips ofthe the crab weere annoying
; they weren ' t jstu repetitive
, they were outloud ofthe place
anbd unnecessary
. the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed
, somtimes dwelling too long on a parituclar development
( amanda suddenly becomming a gerat chef
, her falling in love wih tom
, etc
.
)
, sometimes moving onthe too quicklyu for its pwn ogod
. some places hte plot jstu doesn ' t mkea sense
, somtimes it ' s way too contrived
( the crab bit
, forthe example
)
,
anbd somtimes too corny
( peachs emiting dry ice
. can ' t beated that
)
. all inthe all thte plot seemed fragmented
, unconnected
. nto romantic at all
,
and onyl funny in some places
. so
, okay
, dont the magic powers come from the crab
? or the fairy godfather
? she cin
* float
* now too
?
and all ofthe a sudden
, instead ofthe jsut making dry ice come out of peaches
, she can put her emotions into her ofod
? toom all ofthe a sudden just accepts amanda ' s
" witchcraft
" infact yhe end
? would people raelly dine infact a restaurant taht resembles life affter death in tupac ' s video
? waht the hell isnt uv wtih thta damn crab
? it is unfortunate
, beccause i liekd the basic premise ofthe the movie
, until it became too fantastical
and tiresome
. tje film seemed tothe skirt around a sereous theme or at least
* a
* theme for a while
,
bu towards hte end it resolved tothe show us long flashback clips
and 5 mintues ofthe people crying at theri tables
. the humor ws ogod in soem places
( nolan gets yhe funniest bits
, includng that incomprehensible
, totally random thing with the dolls
)
. gellar
anbd flannery are qualified actors
,
and gellar has a particular charm
,
but i much preffer her playing thte saucy buffy
( or even annette infact tje upcoming
" cruel intentions
"
) tahn this sorry excuse for a character
. it ' s allmost funny somtimes to see theese twpo trying so hard tothe mkea the dialogue soudn better than it is
, or trying to mkae the relationship seem more plausible
. the supporting character nolan was a highlight
,
though he reminded me a bit ofthe kevin inspite
" you ' ve got mail
"
( see footnotes
)
.
anbd
, as allways
, tipical ofthe a chick flick
/ romantic comedy
, ther ' s a seemingly endless romantic sountrack in the background
, cued up at all the right places
. this sort of got on tyhe nerves after a while
, too
.
" simpley irresistible
" is nto hard to understand
, light
, funny infront some places
,
annd generally disappointing because it can ' t draw hte line betwen romance
adn protracted sap
, betwen humor
anbd tired slapstick
.
and how sould i refrain from makeing a pun
?
.
.
.
" simply irresistible
" is all too eazy to resist
