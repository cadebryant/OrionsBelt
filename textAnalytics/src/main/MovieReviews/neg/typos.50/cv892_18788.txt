okay
, bear whith me y
' all
, cause first off i have tothe get this off my chest
: what tje hell isnt up with that damn crab
?
?
? whew
. okay
. cause that smae clip shown over
and over agina wass beginnig to get on my nerves towords the end
, as cute as teh crab maybe
. even i know that you ened omre footage tahn
* that
*
. adn thgat wasn
' t the onyl hting getting onthe my nerves
. teh cutesy gimmicks
, saccharine sweet score
/ soundtrack adn the pretty young faces ofthe sarah michelle gellar
( as am
anda
)
and sean patrick flannery
( as toom
) might have held some appeal during
, oh
, say thte first 10 minutes of the movie
. at first the movei moves allong at a quick
, intresting pace
. it isnt speedily estalbished that something magical isnt about tothe ahppen to am
anda whn she encounters a totally r
andom fairy godfather type person onthe the strent
, whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere
and just
* doesn
' t
* die
. a ridiculous consept
, yes
, bu at tihs point i
' m willing tothe accept it becuase i
' m willing to accept that this isnt how am
anda
' s life isnt changed
, how her powers are received
. later onthe
, tyhe movei cxan
' t seem tothe deside whther these powers come fomr tihs fairy godfather or ffrom am
anda falling in with toom
. adn thsi is why the clips of the crab were annoying
; tehy weren
' t just repetitive
, they were outloud ofthe place
and unnecessary
. the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed
, sometimes dwelling too long on a particualr delevopment
( am
anda suddenly becoming a great chef
, her falling infront love iwth toom
, etc
.
)
, sometimes moving onthe too quicklyu fo its pwn good
. smoe places hte plot jstu doesn
' t make sence
, sometimes it
' s way too contrived
( the crab bit
, forthe exemple
)
, adn sometimes too corny
( peachs emitting dry ice
. cin
' t beated thast
)
. all inaddition all the plot seemed fragmented
, unconnected
. not romantic at all
, anbd onyl funny in some places
. so
, okay
, do tje magic powers come from the crab
? or hte fairy godfather
? she can
* floa
* nowe too
? anbd all of a sudden
, instade of just making dry ice come out ofthe peachs
, she cant put her emotions into her food
? tom all of a sudden just accepts am
anda
' s
" witchcraft
" infront the end
? would peopel realyl dine infact a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac
' s video
? whta the hell is up witht that damn crab
? it is unfortunate
, becasue i liked the basic premise of hte movie
, until it bcame too fantastical adn tiresome
. thte film seemed tothe skirt aroud a serious theme or at least
* a
* theme fo a hwile
, bu towords yhe end it resolved to sohw us long flashback clips annd 5 minutes of people crying at their tables
. the humer was good infact soem places
( nolan gets the funniest bits
, including that incomprehensible
, totally r
andom thing with teh dolls
)
. gellar
and flannery are qualified actors
, anbd gellar has a particualr charm
,
but i much prefer her palying the saucy buffy
( or even annette infront thte upcomming
" cruel intentions
"
) tahn thsi sorry excuse for a character
. it
' s alomst funny sometimes to see theese two trying so hard to make teh dialogue soudn better tahn it is
, or trying tothe amking the relatiopnship seem more plausable
. tghe supporting carachter nolan was a highlight
,
though he reminded me a bit of kevin in
" you
' ve got mial
"
( see footnotes
)
. anbd
, as always
, typical ofthe a chick flick
/ rumatic comedy
, ther
' s a seemingly endless rumatic sountrack inaddition teh background
, cued uv at all the right places
. tihs sort ofthe got on yhe nerves aftter a hwile
, too
.
" simpley irresistible
" is nto hard to underst
and
, ight
, funny in smoe places
,
and generally disapointing because it can
' t draw the line between romance
and protracted sap
, vetween humor
and tired slapstick
.
and how could i refrain from makeing a pun
?
.
.
.
" simpley irresistable
" isnt all too easy tothe resist
