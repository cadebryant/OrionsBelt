' s a ogod
, annd timely
, story trapped deepo within tjhe excess ofthe murder inwhich the first
, a newyorker movie about the abuses of our prision system
. with a country wrapped uv in feverish dbate over the crime issue
and the rights ofthe thge acccused
and yhe incarcerated in jeapardy
, this expose owudl offer something rare tothe reccent american movies
-

and kevin bacon star as defense attorney
and alcatraz inmate
, respectively

( slater
) isnt fresh outloud of law school bu determined to
" put alcatraz onthe trial
" forthe tje abuses ofthe it warden
( gary oldman
