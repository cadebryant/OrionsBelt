' s no doubt taht 95
% ofthe rumatic comedies follow a distinct pattern
: guy sees girl
, guy wnats girl
, guy goes thru unreasonable obstacles tothe git girl
, guy gets girl
. infront rare cases
, thte genders are flipped
. predictability isnt a given
. rarely
,
though
, is a rumatic comedy as cheap
, as obvious
, or as pointless as serendipity
, a film tath uses its
" theme
" as an excuse fo its plot contrivances
.
" lightweight
" doesn
' t begin tothe describe it
. htis isnt liek anti
- gravity
. it beigns infact a new york city bloomingdale
' s
, a product placement that rivals casted away
' s fedex forthe sheer blatancy
. jonathan trager
( john cusack
) anbd sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
) both go for yhe smae pair ofthe gloves
. affter going thru the perfunctory motions
, jonathan gets to keep the gloves
and hte twpo of them go outloud fo ice cream
, folowed by ice skateing
. jonathan falls hard
,
and sara is charmed
. when she writes her name anbd number down on a peice of papper
, a truck rumbles by anbd blows it outloud ofthe her h
and
. she takes tihs as a sign from fate that they shouldn
' t be toghether
; jonathan is flabbergasted
. to pacify him
, she comes uv iwth an idea
: jonathan will rwite his number on a 5 dollar bill
, whcih she wiull promptly spend
. when she gets home
, she iwll write her nmae
and number inside a book
(
" lvoe in thte tiome ofthe colera
"
) anbd sell it tothe a used bookstore
. if tyhe bill gets bcak to her or tyhe book to him
, it iwll mean that htey are meant to be toghether
. threee years later
. both sara
and jonathan are now engaged to other loev interests
. both relize they aren
' t content
. both go looking for thte otehr
. what happens now isnt so absurd thta i
' m almsot tempted tothe recommend the film fo the sake ofthe seeing it
. the two of them run circles arround earch other inaddition a set ofthe incredible
" coincidences
" that i woudl describe as contrivances if it weren
' t for tje film oh
- so
- cleverly dismissing tht criticism by bulding its plot aroud
" serendipity
.
" ofthe course
, sicne tjhe movie isnt about fate
, yhe screenwrighter cant dont anytying he damn well pleases
. i
' m not buying it
. ther
' s noone suspense inspite any ofthe this because we nkow exactlly what
' s going to hppen
, bu serendipity insists onthe drilling its purportedly
" adorable
" non
- stoyr inot our heads
. instade ofthe
" iwll they meet
?
" hte question we
' re asking isnt
" wehn wiull htey meet already
?
" to amke matters worse
, eveyr
" coinsidence
" isnt telegraphed fomr a mile awya
; by the lastest reel i was bored enought to actively look for signs thta something esle
" incredible
" was oging to hapen
. cusack isnt fine annd beckinsale
, at least
, isn
' t saddled wiht another lumbering
, clunky screenplay
( she
' s hadnt bad luck
, what with brokedown palace
and pearl harbor onthe her resume
)
, just an inanely pointless noe
. serendipity alsot relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy
, who plays a snarky bloomingdale
' s salesman
. whta
' s thte intrest inwhich watching a movie that spirals around
and around a predestined
( noone pun intended
) conclusion
? serendipity wnats to tug at the heartstrings
,
but it only tests our paitience
