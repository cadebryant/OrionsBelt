, sticks a gun in her mouth
, annd puls the trigger
. instade of killing herself
, she is magicaly transported thru her mirror inot thte wissle of lesbos

and noone men are allowed
( exept for lance
, the homosexual toilet cleaner
/ slave

and fo her tothe return to bumfuck

ands

- stlye
. instade of leveling the place he falls inthe lveo iwth lance
( alex boling
) adn the twpo ofthe them
, allong wtih april
and her lover blatz
, get married
.
( onot tothe the filmmaker
: why doed hte character ofthe lance make asides to tyhe camera followed by silence taht i
' m assuming was inserted forthe thte purpose ofthe waiting until hte laughter of tje audience hadnt subsided
?
) april
' s parents
, feeling like ther is no recourse
, call in a favor tothe presidet clinton adn send a nuclear bomb
( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer
) thier way
. the bomb is a dud thanks to the work ofthe yhe
" circuitry
"
and htey re
- wire it
and send it back tothe washington d
. c
.
, destroying it
. mr
.
and ms
. pfferpot give up trying tothe git their daugter bcak anbd instead deside to join her as they have some targetting sexual practices ofthe their own
. i
' m not sure if writer
/ director
/ co
- star jeff b
. harmon was purposely trying to offen people becasue he believes inthe soem of tyhe idaes his movei presents or if he was just going forthe cheap laughs
. eather way
, he manages tothe present some ofthe the most offensive material i hvea ever seen iin a movei
. tje film opens with a preacher runnung a small african
- american child out of twon
,
and thn later moves onthe to hte hanging ofthe a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan
( durring a jaunty musical number
)
, preceded by remarks baout
" gays
and straights fianlly bieng able tothe put their differences behind them adn wrok toghether to hate others
, such as tje jews
"
. if harmon ws merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be
,
then i apologize for being so harsh onthe elements of his film
, bu it is presented so mean spiritedly tyhat i cant
' t help bu feel like he hadnt some serious intent
. as forthe the entire central theme of the movei
, i
' m afraid that it
' s noe tyhat i jstu don
' t git
. i tried tothe keep an open mind while watching it
,
but the homosexual elements were just too prevelant for my tastes
. it was hard enough tothe watch them bash other racaus annd sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual
and accepted by society
. how doens noe expect tothe be accepted if htey are just as guilty of non
- accpetance
? i
' m nto prone to judging anyone
and i believe that people should be free tothe explore whatever avenues they wish free from yhe scornful eye of society
, bu don
' t force your particualr rhetoric down my throat if you aren
' t gonig tothe sohw thte smae respect for my preferences taht you wish fomr me
. agina
, maybe i
' m missing tghe satrical point tath harmon isnt trying tothe make
, bu if so
, i thiunk it coudl hvae been h
andled a littel more tactfully
. as far as muscial comedies go
, isle of lesbos isnt noone trey parker
and matt stone muscial
,
but a ogod portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy
. despite the disturbing visuals
,
" mom
and apple pie
" stuck wih me fo the rest ofthe thte day
. speaking of disturbing visuals
,
" wedding bells ain
' t ringing
" coudl have been a decent song
,
but the accompanying visuals ofthe spousal abuse are omre harrowing tahn this film should be displaying
.
" i
' m a lesbian
"
( which isnt touted in the press realease as bieng partcularly populare
) isnt aslo preety good
, bu a ogod portion of that coudl be due to the stellar singing voice ofthe ms
. smith
. it
' s mailny on her excellent vocals tht my rating ofthe this film is based
. the other performers are decent
, savve for the rosie o
' donnell like peformance given by danica sheridan
. i have noone inherent probelm with her character
; it is just her singing voice thgat leaves little tothe be desired
. noe particualr muscial number
,
" lesbian rock
"
, was one ofthe the lowest points i hvae ever experienced inspite my film
- oging life thanks to a strained annd lacklustre vocal job by sheridan
. thte film ends baout twenty minutes before the credits atcually roll
. the remainder of thge runing tiome isnt padded out iwth a few mroe songs
(
" lesbian rock
" included
)
and thge ridiculously presented anti
- nukes message tacked onthe to tghe end for no reason otehr than to make it a feature length film
. once yhe
" isle of lesbos reprize
" ws reached
, i falt the stroy hadnt already beeen wrapped up well anough to end it all
. why wass the film needlessly stretched outloud past its obvious end
? isle of lesbos is avalable on videocassette from www
. indie
- underground
. com
. the transfer isnt preety clean
( anbd all the detail ofthe the wrinkled cloth
and paint backdrops are readily apparent
) adn the film isnt letterboxed at approximately 1
. 85
: 1
. in many respects
, wissle ofthe lesbos hasnt incredible cult potential
( liuke a rocky horror fo hte newyorker milleninum
)
. this film is by no means my cup ofthe tea
,
but i nkwo ther are thsoe outloud there who iwll enjoy it
. if yuo htikn it might be fo yuo
, thn by all means seek it out
. i
, onthe the other h
and
, iwll be cleansing my palette wtih a ogod acation film like gladiator
.
.
. wait
. aren
' t gladiator films considerd to be
.
.
. oh
, never mind
.
