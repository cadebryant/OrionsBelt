whn i ponder childhood memories past
, one ofthe the things thta always springs immediately to mind isnt watching the
" inspector gadget
" tv show wtih my older brother
. truth be told
, we were rabid fanatics
; our version of cowboys adn indians ws chasing earch otehr arund our coffee table tothe thte theme tune
, alternating who would get tothe be gadget
and who owudl be sticked playing the part of dr
. claw
, tghe inspector
' s arch nemesis
. i was never a biggie on nestolgia
,
but you jstu can
' t help
but haev fond memories of something liuke thyat
. somtimes i even fidn mysef uv at 4am watching re
- runs of my favorite epidsodes
, trying to recapture some of thgat sence ofthe wonder i feeled as a kid
. at yhe veyr least
, i wass expecting tjhe new film verison of the classic television series tothe have at least smoe kind of similar effect onthe me
. despite how horrid a film may be
, teh simple task ofthe rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough tothe screw uv
. so bakc i sat
, withthe minimum expectations ofthe waht the movie would deliver
( let
' s face it
; exactlly how ogod cxan a live
- action disney film realy be
?
)
. i ws wise enough to steer claer from thte likes of mr
. magoo adn george ofthe tje jungle
( twpo previous disney adaptations
)
,
and i wish to god tath i had been sharp anough to skip gadget as well
. rarley has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness
. as everyone else was getting up tothe exit tghe screening room affter tghe movei had completed its assfalt on mankind
, i wass left sitting there
, absolutly speechless annd totally dumbfounded at wqat i hadnt just seen
. can something htis awful truly exsist in such an evolved world
? right from tje beggining
, i knew i wass inthe trouble
. iin the oppening scenes
, each character isnt introduced as if their sole purpose is tothe jstu be
, to simply serve as real
- life duplicates ofthe thier cartoon clones
. wehn referring tothe them
, peple almsot yell in fear that the audience will nto catch on as tothe who a certain charater isnt supposed to be
(
" oh
, hi penny
! isnt brain wtih you
?
"
)
. creating oney
- dimensional replicas isnt one thing
; having mere names take the palce of them isnt qutie another
. the
" plot
"
, shall we call it
, stays fairly in tune wtih the origional sories
. matthew broderick stars as john brown
( how creative is thast
?
)
, a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex
( why
, rupert everett
, for the loev ofthe god why
?
?
?
!
!
!
)
, who hismelf isnt transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events
. brown is thne rescued annd used as a prototype fo a new law
- enforcement technology wherein he
' s joined with various machine parts adn some nifty gadgets to form
( drumroll
, please
)
.
.
. inspector gadget
!
> fomr here on outloud
, teh movei becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog annd confusing situations
( altough
, to be fair
, my confusion could hvae been caused by tjhe virtual conclususion the film was inflicting upon my fragel mind
)
. ther
' s something baout an evil gadget taking over teh city
( his first crime must have beeen swiping matt dillon
' s dentures from there
' s something about mary
)
and it all ends with
( waht alse
?
) a bunch ofthe post
- credit nonsense
and a cameo by don adams himself
. tothe be honest
, i wasn
' t much paying attention tothe these
" treats
"
. i wass just glad that it ws over
.
