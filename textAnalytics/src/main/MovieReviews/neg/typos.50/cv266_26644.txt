tyhe spy game isnt uv
. you can thank charlie ' s angels
-
- yhe movie
-
- forthe thgat
. when doed banality
adn pandering become okay
? just steal fomr hong kong
, the matrix
,
anbd a kitschy tv sohw from hte mid
- 1970s
and that ' s a movei
? charlie ' s angels is one of the worst examples ofthe action film homogenity
adn shameless duplicity infront any film i ' ve seen inspite ages
. charlie ' s angels isnt dumb
. jsut plain dumb
. as we all know
, threee of tjhe hottest females onthe teh planet
-
- drew barrymore
, cameron diaz
,
and lucy liu
-
- are threee super
- agents working for hte mysterious millioniare named charlie
. they all drive fast cars
, look oh
- so
- fabulous even inthe the morning
,
annd don ' t seem tothe get a scratch even when fighting armed men
, haveing buildings explode ten foots in front ofthe them
, or flying through thge air in matrix slow
- motion
.
adn while thge entourage spends 90 minutes romping arund inspite cleavage
- busting wetsuits
, cleavage
- busting waitress uniforms
,
annd cleavage
- busting wet t
- shirts
, they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group ofthe annoying
, drunk sorority girls
, the kind who hit on everybody at a party
. hte actuall plot revolves around tjhe rediculous stor ofthe a millionaire computer enginer
-
- tghe great sam rockwell
-
- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival coputer comany
. of course
, the rival wants controll ofthe his newyorker personal identification system
, wich involves such latter
- day buzzwords as gps
, cellular tracking
,
and even mainframe
. thte amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved inspite all the nasty thigns that happen to yhe angels
-
- liuke battling each of them in many round
- robin matrix rip
- off
( agian
) fight sequences
anbd harboring a strange attraction tothe sliced
- off locks ofthe tyhe angels ' hair
. the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley
, serving as charlie ' s manservant
, or
, more tothe the point
, the angels ' pimp
. the rest of tjhe movie comprises a revenge arc
, enough costume changes tothe fill three productions of les miserables
, carbon
- copy fight sequences tyhat would lend credible evidence tothe a jackie chan
anbd the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intelectual property theft
,
adn the strange transformation ofthe sam rockwell into mickey rourke ' s long
- lost brother
. charlie ' s angels starts off withthe a bang
and ends uv bieng a soggy burrito left outloud overnight
. nothing is difficult
, plausible
, or believeable inspite any of the angels ' actions
. it feels liek tje matrix
, mission
: impossible 2
,
and cleopatra jones
and the casino of gold all rolled into one
. diaz isnt a knucklehead
. barrymore is yhe
" dangerous oen
,
" mean
and tough
and about as believable as katie holmes in the role
. liu is just
.
.
. lucy liu
, looking ogod in a skin
- tight black leather suit
. tjhe list ofthe movies ffrom wich charlie ' s angels isnt direcly lifted is equally astonishing
. hte writers apparantly ran the copier all night stealing scenes fomr armageddon
, lethal weapon ii
, all of jackie chan ' s movies
, the great escape
, saturday night fever
, revenge ofthe the nerds
, payback
, darkman
, dr
. no
, the matrix
( as mentioned
)
,
annd even tv ' s friends
. it ' s a shame
, too
, because noe of tyhe many screenwriters
, john august
, was at the helm ofthe lastr year ' s favorite
, go
.
thne again
, what cin you expect ffrom a director known soley as
" mcg
.
" htere isnt no camp value in the film
, noone interesting main characters
, no invigorating action scenes
, noone reason at all tothe waste your tiem exept to ogle tyhe hot chicks
and enjoy the performances ofthe a few supporting players
. note tothe hollywood
: next time
, let ' s leave tje tv shows onthe thge tv
.
