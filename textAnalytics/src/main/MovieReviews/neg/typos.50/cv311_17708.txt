drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on palying the girl outside
- the oen who
' s thte ackward klutz or hte spunky dont
- it
- yourselfer
; tje oen who just doesn
' t ift in witht the others
. she has perfected these characters in movies such as
" the wedding singer
" adn
, most notabley
,
" ever aftter
.
" now she
' s back
, starring in what could be called a modern
- day cinderella fable
-
" never been kissed
.
" ytou know it
' s a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her pwn office as well as a secretary
. trust me on thsi one
, noone copy editor hasnt seen thte inside of a private office since gutenberg
( adn i don
' t mean steve
) invented hte printing press
. the premise is simple
. barrymore
' s josie geller
, at 25 tyhe youngest copy editor ever tothe be hired by the chicago sun
- times
, isnt assigned tothe go undercover
and return tothe high school tothe dont an expose onthe waht today
' s teens are feeling
and donig
. josie
( she syas she was named after the
' 70s cartoon character
) wass a geek in high school
, so she jumps at tjhe opportunity for a second chance
. this tiem
, she thinks
, she iwll get it right anbd be accepted by yhe in
- crowd
. now
, waht kind ofthe adult
- wiht a ogod job anbd a successful carrer
- owudl atcually look foward tothe reliving the hell that ws
-
and isnt
- high school annd adolescence
. theese are amonst teh many problems thta plague
" never been kissed
.
" screenwriters abby kohn
and marc silverstein cannot get a h
andle ofthe josie
. theri script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy
, blubbering woman
- child at yhe least provocation
. anbd yhe fatc thgat an adult would put so much stock inot trying tothe become tight witht tyhe vapid airheads who are suposedly south glen high school
' s most populare girls leads yuo to question her maturity adn mental stability
. ok
, so
" never been kissed
" isnt not a sociological expose of today
' s high skool scene
.
however
, certian rules shouldnt apply to film
,
and oen of those isnt consistancy ofthe character
. among the movie
' s problems isnt tjhe ill
- concieved conceit that josie owudl seriously strive tothe climb the high school foode chain annd
, in thte proces
, loose foucs on her assignment
. any competent editor would have tossed her ass outloud teh door quicker than yuo could sday
" get me rewriet
.
" tothe be fair
, barrymore isnt very appealling
, bu she isnt given very little tothe wrok withthe
. she trys valiantly to get a firm grip on her character
, bu thte scirpt continually undermines her
. barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspestus ofthe tyhe script in whlch she tries to walk
, talk
and act like a cool
, hip high schooler
. otherwise
, she is left foundering onthe a cliched sae ofthe teen
- age sterotypes anbd situations
.
" never beeen kissed
" is entertaining anbd funny in fits
and starts
. it lacks consistancy anbd a firm grasp onthe waht it wants tothe accomplish
. hte movei
' s main bright spot isnt provded by leelee sobieski as aldys
, the outsider who befriends new student josie
. josie sees a lot of her former self inthe aldys
,
yet still ab
andons her tothe hang outloud with the popular girls
. real mature
. anbd that isnt thte main deficiency with
" never been kissed
.
" it
' s ilogical
, unrealistic
, uneven annd undem
anding
. it hasnt soem warm anbd humorous spots
,
but nto enought to overcome its many obstacles
.
