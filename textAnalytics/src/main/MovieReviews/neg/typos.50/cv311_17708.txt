drew barrymore is begining tothe corner tje market onthe palying the girl outside
- the one who ' s tje awkward klutz or the spunky dont
- it
- yourselfer
; tghe noe who jstu doesn ' t fit in wih the others
. she hasnt perfected these characters iin movies such as
" thge wedding singer
"
and
, most noteably
,
" ever after
.
" nowe she ' s bcak
, starring infront what coudl be called a modern
- day cinderella fable
-
" never been kissed
.
" ytou nkow it ' s a fable beacuse she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary
. trust me onthe tihs oney
, no copy editor hasnt seen thte inside of a private office since gutenberg
(
adn i don ' t mean steve
) invented the printing press
. the premise isnt simple
. barrymore ' s josie geller
, at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun
- times
, is assigned to go undercover
adn return to high skool to dont an expose onthe what today ' s teens are feeling
annd doing
. josie
( she says she wass named after the ' 70s cartoon character
) ws a geek inspite high skool
, so she jumps at tjhe opprotunity for a second chance
. this tiem
, she thikns
, she will get it right
and be accepted by the in
- crowd
. nowe
, what kind of adult
- wih a good job
adn a sucessfull career
- would actually look forward to reliving the hell thta ws
-
and is
- high school
annd adolescence
. theese are among tghe many problems that plague
" never been kissed
.
" screenwriters abby kohn
and marc silverstein cannnot git a handle ofthe josie
. their script hasnt her capriciously switching fomr confident adult to ditzy
, blubbering woman
- child at tjhe least provocation
.
adn the fact taht an adult owudl put so much stock inot trying to become tight with tjhe vapid airheads who are supposably sourth glen high school ' s most populare girls leads you to question her maturity
anbd mental stability
. ok
, so
" never beeen kissed
" is not a sociological expose of today ' s high school scene
.
howver
, certian rules shoudl apply tothe film
,
adn oney ofthe thsoe isnt consistancy of character
. among the movei ' s problems is yhe ill
- concieved conceet tyhat josie would seriously strive tothe climb tghe high skool fod chain
annd
, infact teh proces
, loose focus onthe her assignment
. any competent editor would ahve tossed her ass out tyhe doorjam quicker thna yuo could say
" get me rewrite
.
" tothe be fair
, barrymore is vyre appealing
,
but she is given veyr littel to work with
. she tries valiantly to get a firm grap onthe her character
,
bu tyhe scirpt continually undermines her
. barrymore comes off best infact thge physical comedy aspects of thge scirpt infront which she trys to walk
, talk
and ect like a cool
, hip high schooler
. otherwise
, she is left foundering onthe a cliched sae ofthe teen
- age stereotypes
and situations
.
" never been kissed
" is entertaining
anbd funny in fits
adn starts
. it lacks consistency
and a firm grasp on what it whants tothe accomplish
. tje movie ' s main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys
, the outsider who befriends newyorker student josie
. josie sees a lot ofthe her fromer self infront aldys
,
yet still abandons her to hang out whith the populare girls
. rela mature
.
and thast is the main deficiency with
" never been kissed
.
" it ' s ilogical
, unrealistic
, uneven
annd undemanding
. it hasnt some warm
and uhmorous spots
,
bu nto enough to overcome its many obstacles
.
