the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film
" the world isnt not enought
" isnt its fianl frome
: white letters on a balck backround proclaiming
" james bond iwll return
.
" oh i certainly hope not
. with pierce brosnan inwhich his third
and reportedly last go
- round as james bond 007
,
" the world is nto anough
" isnt the best exmaple tothe date tyhat
" ' enough
" is anough
. inwhich this
, the 19th chapter in thge seamingly
- endless franchise featuring ian fleming ' s debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis
-
-
annd his nemeses
-
- shaken not stirred
, the sub
- inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all ofthe tjhe setups
, stunts
,
annd sexy encounters of tje previous 18 bond ficks rather thna comming uv with anything the slightest bit orignal
. we ' ve got previously
- used speedboat chases
, ski chases
,
anbd sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines
. we ' ve got a cuple of hot
- tothe
- trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them
. we ' ve got a post
- cold war megalomaniac bent onthe world domination slash desctruction
( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle whith mean
, leanr panache
)
.
adn
, as hasnt beeen tjhe case since 1977 ' s
" the spy who loved me
,
" we ' ve got a plot that hasnt nothing whatsoever tothe dont iwth anything concieved by mr
. fleming
. we ' ve also got a main title song by garbage tothe wich
, with veyr littel efort
, yuo cxan fit the lyrics tothe
* both
* songs from
" tomorrow never dies
.
" hwile originality wass never teh sories ' storng suit
, thge films weere almost alwyas funn
, with at least some throught oging into tje nonstop stunts
. i can ' t think of one memorable set
- peice inaddition the entire
-
-
and very dull
-
-
" thge world is not enought
.
" in addition
, michael apted
( yes
, tjhe respected director of such films as
" coal miner ' s duaghter
,
"
" nell
,
"
and the
" 28up
" documentry series
) tkaes embarrassing advantage ofthe thge full range ofthe bond clich
? s
. yuo get tyhe
" tlaking killer
" plot divice
-
- you know teh scenerio
: thge bad guy hasnt the good guy at his mercy
yet waxes poetic just long anough to die ofthe old age
.
and you get a slew ofthe high
- priced asssassans who cxan ' t hitted a barn door at 20 paces
: inspite the film ' s oppening mintues
( of an endless 128
)
, bond chases a sultry sniper allong thge thames
and the leather
- clad lovely fails tothe hit bond ' s souped
- up
" fishing boat
" with a bazooka when he puls withing a few fezent of her
. later
, she tkaes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling ffrom a guy rope beneath her
bu is still unable to tkae him outloud
. these reliable absurdities are more frustrating thna usual usance htere are no distractions otehr than ocassional ads forthe luxury automobiles
, vodka
, or credit cards
. in
adn among thge rampant product placements
, brosnan grapples with carlyle
,
" braveheart
" ' s sophie marceau
( as fromer kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king
; she ' s terrible
)
,
" wild things

( as a nucular physicist lord help me
; she ' s laughable
)
,
and judi dench as m
. dame judi brings the onyl shred ofthe dignity to a serieses that has long usance jettisoned its self
- respect
( baout teh tiem roger moore inherited bond ' s walther ppk
)
. brosnan goes through the motions wiht hte grace
anbd charm you ' d expect ofthe the fromer

" star
,
but even he has to be thingking there ' s mroe to life tahn an easy paycheck
. he ' s given plenty ofthe wiseacre asides tothe deliver
,
bu onyl one ofthe them

-
" i don ' t know any doctor jokes
"
-
- made me chuckle
(
although
" i thougth christmas onyl comes once a yearm
" is moreso in keeping with the series ' penchant fo grown
- worthy puns
