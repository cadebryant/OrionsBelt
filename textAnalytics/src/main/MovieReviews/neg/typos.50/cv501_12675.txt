. comments
: the ex isnt a very bad movie
. i haven
' t seen a turkey ofthe htis magnitude iin quite a while
. i kept vacillating
,
however
, between giving the ex oney star for its sheer awfulness adn three stars forthe its campy humer
( ultimatly
, i decided to splitted yhe difference anbd give it two stars
)
. as summarized briefly infact hte synopsis
, this isnt yot anohter spurned
- pyscho
- lover
- gets
- her
- revenge type movei
. i
' m not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which uise thsi tired storyline
, bu it seems like 10
, 000
, 000
, 000
. tghe ex
,
however
,
though following many ofthe hte st
andard cliches ofthe thsi thriller subgenre
, differs slightly fomr the norm iin tht
, at least
, it doesn
' t tkae itself too seriously like so many otehr duds do
( malicious
and stalked are two examples which cmo to mind
)
. those involved infact the movie relize they
' re in a trkey
, aparently
, annd turn infact hammy performances which compliment yhe ludicrous dialogue contained withing tghe scirpt
. the ex
' s storyline
, as i said
, incorprates many cliches predominant in films of its nature
; howver
, the plot isnt so overwrought annd unbeleivable taht
, after a while
, the viewer must accept that logic doens not opperate infront the realm of the movei
. diedre
, david
' s frist wife
, kills
and kills anbd kills
, fo exmaple
, wihtout ever hvaing tothe worry baout polical investigations
and the liuke
( it
' s nto as
though she
' s bright enough not to leave fingerprints at yhe scene ofthe tje crime
)
. david annd his new wief molly have an incredibly difficult time underst
anding why michael
, theri son
, hasnt emotional problems
, specifically his inablility to control his anger
.
though david smokes like tommorow iwll never come adn blows up at peopel every otehr minute iin the movie
, thte connection betweeen him adn his son is nto made
. molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she
' s a child psychologist
and allows the demented woman to spend timne iwth her son
. time anbd time again
, things dont not add uv in this movie
. if a viewer cant
' t accept this fact
, hten he will definately not liek the ex
. if
, onthe thte other h
and
, he can appreciate the movei forthe its campiness
, hten he
' ll probablly liek it much better
. i don
' t mean tothe necessarily suggest
, howver
, that thge ex is a memorable exercise in camp
. even whn viewed from an it
' s
- so
- bad
- it
' s
- good angle
, tihs movie isn
' t all that successful
. tghe ex does ahev its moments
,
though
, alomst all of whihc involve yancy
butler
( the psychotic diedre
)
and nick mancuso
( david
)
. theese twpo actors turn inwhich decidely hammy performances which
, oftentimes
, elicit chuckles from teh audience
. thge truly awful lines written for them help this humor allong
.
butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue
; every time her chracter kills someone
, she hasnt a punchline that
' s unbelievably inane
. wehn she murders a tenant ofthe an apartment she wishes to uise to spy onthe david
, forthe exemple
, diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar adn states
" i
' m so sorry
, your lease isnt terminated
.
" or how about when diedre tkaes out her therapist in anyother ridiculous scene
?
( diedre
' s therapist wishes tothe have her recommitted
, so she decides to vist diedre
, alone
, in her new appartmant
-
- never realizing
, of course
, that it
' s not her
' s
. therapists typically are catatonically brain
- dead inaddition theese movies
)
. having successfully snuffed yhe woman outloud
, diedre looks at the body
and sasy
:
" waht was it that you alwyas said tothe me at the end ofthe eahc session
, dr
. jones
? oh
, tath
' s right
.
' i
' m sory
,
but your tiem is up
!
'
" tihs isnt wqat passes fo humer inaddition the film
. teh audience doesn
' t neccesarily laugh
but groan
( thge tipe of groan that suggests thge audeince cant
' t blieve they
' re watching tihs crap
-
-
al
thought watching it htey are
)
. nick mancuso
' s chainsmoking
, nervous
- wreck charcter does nto ahev tghe cheesy lines that
butler
' s character delivers
, bu his ridiculously overdone performence provides forthe some better comic releaf
. in between drags off his cigarette
, forthe instatance
, in one ofthe the movei
' s best scenes
, david trys tothe explane to his lawyer whta a creep his ex
- wief isnt
. inthe exagerated exasperation
, he nearly shouts
" tjhe woman isnt a cuckoo
- bird
!
"
( trust me
, it isnt funny infront context
.
)
and so
, tje movei continues untl its painfully obvious conclusion
. i won
' t reveal the endig specifically
(
though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of tihs type could propably guess the ending jstu from this film review
)
,
but i will sday that the ex hasnt noe of tjhe biggest fire hazards appearing recently inwhich film
. molly
and david pwn a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames inaddition approxamately threee seconds
! molly
, at one point in tjhe film
, nto
- so
- brilliantly observes
, aftter dicovering diedre hasnt moved inot an apartment accross ffrom her family
' s tothe spy apon them
, that
" she
' s crazy
.
" you
' d be pretty crazy too if you
' d rented tihs tureky
. i
' d avoid it unless it
' s onthe tv adn yuo come across it
. if you do
, ytou may watn tothe watch it
, groan at the bad punchlines
and stupid plot
, adn efel ogod that yuo didn
' t spend money renting it
.
