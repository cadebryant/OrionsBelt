. comments
: tghe ex is a vyer bad movei
. i haven ' t seen a turkey ofthe tihs magnitude inspite quite a hwile
. i kept vacillating
,
howver
, between giving thte ex one star for its sheer awfulness
adn three stars for its campy humer
( ultimately
, i desided tothe splitted tyhe difference
and give it two stars
)
. as summarized breifly in the synopsis
, this is
yot another spurned
- pyscho
- lover
- gets
- her
- revenge tipe movie
. i ' m nto sure how many films hvae beeen produced since fatal attraction which ule this tired storyline
,
bu it seems liek 10
, 000
, 000
, 000
. the ex
,
however
,
though follwoing many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre
, differs slightly ffrom hte norm inspite that
, at least
, it doesn ' t take itself too seriously like so many other duds dont
( malicious
and stalked are two examples wich come tothe mind
)
. those involved in thte movie relize they ' re inaddition a turkey
, apparently
,
and turn inwhich hammy performances which compliment tje ludicrous dialogue contained within the scirpt
. the ex ' s storyline
, as i said
, incorporates many cliches predominant iin films ofthe its nature
;
howver
, the plot is so overwrought
adn unbelievable thast
, after a hwile
, the viewer must accept thta logic does not operate in tje realm ofthe yhe movie
. diedre
, david ' s first wife
, kills
annd kills
anbd kills
, fo example
, without ever haveing to worry about police investigations
annd the like
( it ' s nto as
though she ' s bright anough nto tothe leave fingerprints at thge scene of yhe crime
)
. david
and his new wief molly haev an incredibly difficult timne understanding why michael
, theri son
, has emotional problems
, specifically his iability to control his anger
.
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come
and blows up at peple eveyr other minute in tje movie
, tyhe connection between him
adn his son isnt nto made
. molly is easily swayed by diedre inot believing she ' s a child psychologist
annd allows tghe demented woman to spend time witht her son
. time
annd tiome again
, things do nto add uv in tihs movie
. if a viewer cin ' t accept htis fatc
,
thn he wiull definately nto liuke hte ex
. if
, onthe yhe otehr hand
, he cant appreciate tje movei forthe its campiness
,
thn he ' ll probaly like it much better
. i don ' t mean to necessarily suggest
,
however
, tyhat the ex is a memorable excercise inspite camp
. even when viewed fomr an it ' s
- so
- bad
- it ' s
- good angle
, thsi movei isn ' t all that sucessfull
. thge ex does have its moments
,
though
, almsot all ofthe hwihc involve yancy butler
( the psychotic diedre
)
anbd nick mancuso
( david
)
. these twpo actors turn infront decidely hammy performances whitch
, oftentimes
, elicit chuckles ffrom hte audience
. hte truley awful lines wroten for them halp thsi humer along
. butler gets thte larger portion of bad dialogue
; every time her charater kills somone
, she hasnt a punchline that ' s unbelievably inane
. when she murders a tennant of an apartment she wishes to ule to spy onthe david
, for example
, diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar
and states
" i ' m so sory
, your lease is terminated
.
" or how baout when diedre takes outloud her therapist in another ridiculous scene
?
( diedre ' s therapist wishes to hve her recommitted
, so she decides to ivsit diedre
, alone
, in her newyorker appartment
-
- never realizing
, ofthe course
, that it ' s nto her ' s
. therapists typically are catatonically brain
- dead iin these movies
)
. having successfully snuffed the woman outloud
, diedre looks at tje body
and syas
:
" what was it that yuo alwasy said to me at tje end ofthe earch session
, dr
. jones
? oh
, that ' s right
. ' i ' m sory
,
bu your time is up
! '
" thsi isnt waht passes for humor iin tghe film
. the audeince doesn ' t necessarally laugh
bu groan
( the tipe ofthe groan tath suggests thte audience cin ' t beleave tehy ' re watching this crap
-
-
although watching it tehy are
)
. nick mancuso ' s chainsmoking
, nervous
- wreck character doesnt nto have tjhe cheesy lines that butler ' s charachter delivers
,
bu his ridiculously overdone peformance provides forthe some better comic releaf
. inthe between drags off his cigarette
, for instance
, iin oen ofthe the movie ' s best scenes
, david tries to explain tothe his lawyer waht a creep his ex
- wief isnt
. inspite exagerated exasperation
, he nearly shouts
" teh woman isnt a cuckoo
- bird
!
"
( trust me
, it isnt funny in context
.
)
annd so
, the movie continues nutil its painfully obvious conclusion
. i won ' t reveal yhe endig specifically
(
though anyone remotely familar witht thrillers ofthe this tipe sould probably guess yhe ending jsut ffrom this film review
)
,
bu i will say thast the ex hasnt one ofthe the biggest fier hazards appearing recently inspite film
. molly
adn david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames inaddition approximately three seconds
! molly
, at oen point inspite the film
, not
- so
- brilliantly observes
, aftter discovering diedre has moved inot an apartment across ffrom her family ' s to spy apon them
, thgat
" she ' s crazy
.
" ytou ' d be preety crazy too if you ' d rented tihs turkey
. i ' d avoid it unless it ' s on tv
adn you come acros it
. if ytou do
, you may whant tothe watch it
, groan at thte bad punchlines
and stupid plot
,
and efel good that you didn ' t spend money renting it
.
