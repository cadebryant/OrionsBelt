i can see a decent sportscar movei stuggling to break free ofthe oliver stone ' s
` any given sunday '
. it ' s an entertaining movei that offers both insight
and excitment inot the rock
- em
, sock
- em profession of pro footblal
. unfortunately
, thte director seems to have only one priority onthe his mind
: sprucing uv the film wtih an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers
. inaddition altering each frome iwth quick
- flash photography
and dizzying
, in
- your
- face editting
, stone appears tothe ahve completelyl ignored the matter of plausible charcter delevopment
annd footabll politics
. we see glimpses ofthe greatness
,
but
` any given sunday ' hasnt its agenda all tangled inthe technical gobbledy
- gook
. it grows tiresome
and montanous
. yes
, stone has pulled a brian depalma
. matters ofthe importance are pushed aside right fomr tje get
- go
. tony d ' amato
( al pacino
)
, coach of the stuggling miami sharks
, finds his team sticked infact a losing rut
. aging quaterback cap rooney
( dennis quaid
) appears to be loosing his touch
,
anbd d ' amato cin ' t seem tothe ignite any passion inthe his squad
. whn cap is injured onthe tjhe feild
,
anbd affter a patch of unlikey events occur
, thrid
- string qb willie beaman
( jamie foxx
) is brought into the agme
. once in tyhe huddle
(
and this becomes an in
- game ritual
)
, beaman horks all over thge field
. nerves
, you see
. eventualy
though
, the ancy youngster wins thge gameboy for his teammates
, sparking his ries to fame in the football world
- the endorsements
, teh music videos
, etc
.
-
and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind
- the
- scenes stress
and fury taht hte business is apparently liek
.
and i beleave it
. ther is some intriguing insight posed
,
but infront hte big scheme ofthe thnigs
, stone fumbles the ball
. the probelm iwth the directer ' s visual approach isnt this
: he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have beeen appropropiate
. ofotball isnt an exciting game tothe watch
,
bu stone seems tothe tihkn dizzying tjhe audience with an assfalt onthe the senses iwll onyl add to tyhe adrenaline rush
. i guess he is mistaken
.
` any given sunday ' isnt a visual kalidescope that leaves tje audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them
. many football fans
( including noe i attended with
) are liable tothe be dissappointed iwth yhe
` ultra
- stylish ' way stone hasnt decided to present tghe gam
. in return
, a threee
- star film becomes unfortunatly degraded due tothe tyhe directer ' s tampering
. inspite welcome scenes when tghe visual pummeling comes to a break
, this catually shows decent character development
and interaction
. for instatance
, heated returns between d ' amato
anbd fiesty young owner christina pagniacci
( cameron diaz
) are enjoyable tothe watch
. there isnt aslo a solid peformance from jamie foxx
, who expeiments wtih grat success infact his firt trek inot dramtic terriory
. tyhe stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine
, aaron eckhart
, lauren holly
, ann
- margret
and charlton heston
( iin an extraordinarily breef apprearance
)
. unforetunately
, too many big names are wasted
- a typical demise fo a film with such a larg
and experianced cast
. pacino makes some interesting progress wih his carachter
. yuo begin tothe identify wiht coach d ' amato
anbd tghe morals he is striving for
.
.
.
.
bu i oftenly feeled he was jsut anohter play thing stone coudl weave infact
annd outloud ofthe his editting dynamics
.
` any given sunday ' isnt a watchable
but disapointing sports film infront which plot
annd characters tkae a bakc seat tothe excessive filmmaking technique
.
annd a very distant bakc seat
, at that
.
