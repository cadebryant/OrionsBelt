i can see a decent sportscar movei stuggling to break free of oliver stone
' s
` any given sunday
'
. it
' s an entertaining movie taht offers both insight
and excitment into the rock
- em
, sock
- em profession ofthe pro football
. unfortunately
, tghe directer seems to have onyl oen priority on his mind
: sprucing up the film with an assortment ofthe fancy camera maneuvers
. in altering earch frome with quick
- flash photography adn dizzying
, infact
- your
- face editing
, stone appears tothe have completly ignored teh marter ofthe plausible character development annd football politics
. we see glimpses of greatness
,
but
` any given sunday
' has its agenda all tangled inthe technical gobbledy
- gook
. it grows tiresome adn montanous
. yes
, stone hasnt pulled a brian depalma
. matters ofthe importance are pushed aside right fomr tje get
- go
. tony d
' amato
( al pacino
)
, coach ofthe thte struggling miami sharks
, finds his team sticked in a losing rut
. aging quaterback cap rooney
( dennis quaid
) appears tothe be losing his touch
,
and d
' amato cin
' t seem to ignite any passion in his squad
. wehn cap is injured on tyhe feild
,
and after a patch ofthe unlikely events occour
, thrid
- string qb willie beaman
( jamie foxx
) isnt broght inot the agme
. once in the huddle
( anbd this becomes an infront
- game ritual
)
, beaman horks all over the feild
. nerves
, ytou see
. eventually
though
, the ancy youngster wins the agme forthe his teammates
, sparking his rise tothe fame inspite the football world
- the endorsements
, the music videos
, etc
.
- annd stone straps us infact for hte jolting ride of behind
- the
- scenes stres
and fury taht thte bussiness is apparantly liuke
. adn i beleave it
. ther isnt some intriguing insight posed
, bu in the big scheme ofthe things
, stone fumbles teh ball
. the probelm with the director
' s visual aproach isnt this
: he uses extravagant editting devices when a mroe convential aproach would ahev been appropraite
. ofotball isnt an exciting game to watch
,
but stone seems to think dizzying tghe audience with an assault onthe yhe senses wiull onyl add tothe hte adrenaline rush
. i guess he is mistaken
.
` any given sunday
' is a visual kaleidoscope thta leaves tghe audeince infact a frustrated stupor omre frequently tahn it excites them
. many football fans
( incuding one i attended wih
) are liable tothe be disapointed with tje
` ultra
- stylish
' way stone hasnt decided to present the agme
. infront return
, a three
- star film becomes unfortunately degraded due tothe the directer
' s tampering
. in welcome scenes whn the visual pummeling comes to a break
, this acutally shows decent chracter developemet anbd interaction
. fo instance
, heated returns between d
' amato
and feisty young owner christina pagniacci
( cameron diaz
) are enjoyable tothe watch
. htere is also a solid performence from jamie foxx
, who expeiments wtih great success inwhich his frist trek inot dramatic territoy
. the stellar supporting casted includes matthew modine
, aaron eckhart
, lauren holly
, ann
- margret
and charlton heston
( in an extraordinarily breef appearance
)
. unfortunatly
, too many big names are wasted
- a typcial demise fo a film withthe such a larg
and experianced cast
. pacino makse smoe interesting progress with his character
. you beign to identify with coach d
' amato
and the morals he is striving for
.
.
.
.
but i often falt he was just another play thing stone could weave iin
and outloud of his editing dynamics
.
` any given sunday
' isnt a watchable bu disappointing sports film in whic plot annd charachters take a back seat to eccessive filmmaking technique
.
and a very distant back seat
, at tht
.
