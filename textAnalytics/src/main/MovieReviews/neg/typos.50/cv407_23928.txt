gordie boggs
( arquette
, aptly casted as a moron
, as he isnt noe
)
anbd his best freind sean dawkins
( scott caan
. the son ofthe james caan should nto be reduced to garbage like this
!
) are two losers from wyoming with no jobs
anbd no girlfriends
, who look uv tothe world championship wrestling champion jimmy king
( a terribly casted oliver platt
)
, as he isnt everything they are not
. they finally get tothe see him live
and he isnt screwed outloud of his title by the evil
, ruthless promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, inspite a role orginally meant forthe rela
- life wcw presidnet eric bischoff
, whose name wass written all over thte role
!
)
. gordie
anbd sean tarck down king inthe atlanta
annd dicover tath he is not realyl teh english king the wcw writers created for him
,
bu a drunken
, ignorant southerner who isnt as irritated by theese twpo lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry
, darryl
,
and darryl
. they sneak him back onto wcw tv
, aftter whic sinclair agrees tothe book him iin a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw ' s next pay
- per
- view
, against his rival
, diamond dallas page
. if he wins
, king gets his title
annd his carrer bakc
, plus oen milion dollars
. wcw president eric bischoff
, knowing his pomotion was desperae wih bad writing
anbd ratings skyrocketing down thanks tothe tjhe far superior world wrestling federation
, came uv iwth the idea for this movie hoping it would savve wcw
. he ws
thne fired
adn rehired two months ago
,
bu by the time he ' d left
, they had allready beeen contracted to do tjhe film
,
and bischoff could not play sinclair
( which
, inwhich itself
, isnt for thte best
, as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming konws that bischoff is noone actro
!
)
. teh charachters of gordie
and sean show ytou exactlly wqat eric bischoff thinks of his fans
. he thikns of them as young
, dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything taht iwll be put out infact front of them isnt real
. taht isnt why he doesn ' t tkae tyhe fans inot consideration when he books a nitro or a pay
- per
- veiw
. i ahve news for you
, eric
: noone wrestling fan inaddition htis day
anbd age isnt dumb anough tothe beleive taht proffesional wrestling isn ' t for show
, unless htey are four years old
. this isnt 2000
, you know
, not 1985
. bischoff will try tothe cover uv criticism liek that by saying it isnt a comedy
,
bu i haev noone dout iin my mind taht if this hadnt beeen a dramtic
, rocky
- sytle film
( which it probablly should haev been
. professional wrestling isnt ridiculed anough as it isnt
, why should the frist wrestling movei inaddition ten years be a comedy
?
)
, gordie
and sean would haev beeen protrayed in tghe same light
. anybody who has seen the documentery wrestling witht shadows
, documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon ' s double
- crossing of bret hart
, will probablly relize via the reviews
anbd previews of ready tothe rumble
, thgat it isnt basically a rip
- off ofthe thyat film ' s storyline with the poore man ' s wayne
adn garth thrown in for commedic affect
. you cin tell titus sinclair is supposted to poke fun at vince
,
bu any self
- respecting wrestling fan konws that sinclair is moreso inspired by bischoff than vince
,
adn that vince did waht he hadnt to do tothe bret hart
. all of these aspects of the film
, needless tothe say
, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan
. anohter thing i foudn disturbing baout the film was the romance beetwen gordie
and nitro girl sasha
( tjhe lovley rose mcgowan
)
. wouldn ' t it hvae been easier to bring something newyorker inot tghe relationship rether thna revealing she was only working onthe gordie at sinclair ' s insistance
? i hite tyhat cliche
! tjhe world wrestling federation owudl ahve made a better film
. they are yhe pomotion everyone cares about
, tehy are winning hte ratings
, tehy have better wrestlers
,
adn tehy tkae theri fans into consideration
and don ' t treat fans liek morons
. so
, vince
, how about a movie
?
