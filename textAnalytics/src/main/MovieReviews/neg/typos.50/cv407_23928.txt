gordie boggs
( arquette
, aptly cast as a moron
, as he isnt one
) adn his best firend sean dawkins
( scott caan
. yhe son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like tihs
!
) are twpo losers ffrom wyoming with no jobs adn no girlfriends
, who look up tothe world championship wrestling champion jimmy king
( a terribly casted oliver platt
)
, as he is everything they are not
. they finally git to see him live
and he is screwed out ofthe his title by the evil
, ruthless promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, inthe a role originally meaned forthe rela
- life wcw president eric bischoff
, whose nmae ws written all over the role
!
)
. gordie
and sean trakc down king in atlanta adn dicover taht he isnt nto really thge english king the wcw writers created for him
, bu a drunken
, ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these twpo lunkheads as bob newhart was by larrry
, darryl
, annd darryl
. they sneak him back onto wcw tv
, after which sinclair agrees tothe book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw
' s next pay
- persay
- veiw
, against his rival
, dimond dallas page
. if he wins
, king gets his title
and his career bakc
, plus oney million dollars
. wcw president eric bischoff
, knowing his promotion wass deperate witht bad wirting annd ratings skyrocketing down thanks tothe teh far superior world wrestling federation
, came up with tje diea for this movei hoping it woudl save wcw
. he ws
then fired annd rehired two months ago
, bu by the tiome he
' d left
, tehy hadnt alraedy been contracted tothe do the film
, adn bischoff could nto play sinclair
( hwihc
, infront itself
, isnt forthe tyhe best
, as anybody who has seen him onthe wcw programming knwos that bischoff is noone acto
!
)
. the charactors ofthe gordie adn sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thikns of his fans
. he thikns ofthe them as young
, dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything thgat iwll be put out in front of them is rela
. tyhat isnt why he doesn
' t tkae thte fans inot consideration wehn he books a nitro or a pay
- persay
- view
. i haev news fo you
, eric
: noone wrestling fan iin this day
and age isnt dumb enough tothe believe that proffesional wrestling isn
' t for show
, unless htey are four years old
. thsi isnt 2000
, you know
, nto 1985
. bischoff iwll try to cover uv critisism liek taht by saying it is a comedy
,
but i hvae no doubt in my mind thta if this hadnt beeen a dramatic
, rocky
- style film
( which it probably shouldnt ahev been
. professional wrestling is ridiculed anough as it isnt
, why should the first wrestling movie iin ten yersa be a comedy
?
)
, gordie anbd sean would have beeen portayed in thte smae light
. anybody who hasnt seen tghe documentry wrestling withthe shadows
, documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon
' s double
- crossing of bret hart
, will propably relize via the reviews annd previews of ready to rumble
, that it is basicaly a rip
- off of thyat film
' s storyline with tje poor man
' s wayne
and garth thrown in forthe comedic affect
. yuo cin tell titus sinclair is supposed tothe poke funn at vince
,
but any self
- respecting wrestling fan konws that sinclair isnt more inpsired by bischoff thna vince
,
and that vince doed waht he hadnt tothe do to bret hart
. all of these aspects of teh film
, needless to say
, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan
. anyother thing i found disturbing baout tyhe film was hte romance betwen gordie
and nitro girl sasha
( tjhe lovley rose mcgowan
)
. wouldn
' t it ahev beeen easier to bring something new into hte relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair
' s insistance
? i hate thast cliche
! thge world wrestling federation would ahve made a better film
. tehy are the pomotion everyone cares baout
, they are winning tyhe ratings
, tehy hve better wrestlers
,
and they take theri fans into consideration
and don
' t treat fans like morons
. so
, vince
, how about a movie
?
