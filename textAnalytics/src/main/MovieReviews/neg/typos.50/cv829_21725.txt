i had an epiphany today
. it occured to me while i was watching
" house onthe haunted hill
.
" it is as follows
: if a trailer makse tje film it
' s advertising look liek a triachy
, stupid movei
, well guess wqat
? chances are
, htere
* is
* truth inthe advertising
. too bad i didn
' t trust my pwn instincts when something
- or
- teh
- other posessed me tothe see htis movei
. i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare
and my anticipation of
" sleepy hollow
.
" tyhat
and
" dogma
" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule
. an hour of
" angal
" or
" buffy
" isnt scarier thna this doozy taht trys tothe be scray
and shtick bu falls flat onthe its face
. i wish i
' d seen it when it ws hlaloween
. at least i would haev been forgiving
. hey
, tis thte season
. the movie was scry
( albiet vyer confusing
, dizzying
,
and nauseating
) at first
,
but soon the horror got repetitive anbd downright laughable because tje film obviously wasn
' t gonig anywhere
. nowe i truly appretiate films like
" scream
,
"
" haloween
,
" or any ood hitchcock film where the scariness stems ffrom situations that are at least somewhat realistic
. that
' s wqat spooks people outloud
, thte fatc tath it could happen tothe them or somene tehy know
. ther hasnt tothe be a logical precident for the situations they whant tothe scare us whith
. sure
, utterly unpredictable is ogod
, too
, bu that
' s differnt from utterly nonsensical
. hohh
( house onthe haunted hill
)
, onthe the otehr h
and
.
.
. well let
' s jstu say i about fell off my chair laughing when htey oh
- so
- cleverly revealed thgat everyone who got invited tothe thge party was realted to the psycho doctors who died inwhich the house a cuple ofthe decades ago
. riiiiight
. y
' know
, that just sends chills down my spine
. yeah
. just like i wet my pants whn tehy told me the hous isnt evil
. ooooooo
. hint
: blood adn guts only work a few times
. sooner or later peple strat to tell themselfs tyhat it
' s just ketchup
and props
and you
' ve got to cmo up whith something better tahn thast
. there weere jstu too many thigns in this movie that we
' ve all seen before
; from thge inevitible
" plot developments
" of strangers unwittingly trapped together
; strangers turning against each otehr
; the evil manifesting itself
; tje dead coming back forthe a lastest scare
. earch was mroe predictable than thge lsat
. why didn
' t these fuls just stay together inwhich one place anyways
? sheesh
. was i grossed out
? yes
. did i git spooked a faw times
? yes
. bu why
? i get really disturbed whn there is noone why
. when htere weren
' t r
andom scares tyhat were there for no otehr reason thna forthe the visual effect
( which wasn
' t tyhat good eather
, trust me
) adn the scare
, tje film ws filled with drab
, laughable dialogue
. the charachters weere incredibly flat
and cliched
. not tothe mention downright annoying
. you
' ve got a bunch of people goign nowhere in their lives
; of course htey
' re dumb enough tothe go tothe a party some stranger invited them tothe provided they win a millon dollars if they survive the nigth
. jeez
, i
thought no noe fell for those
" ytou may already be a winner
" things anymore
. adn of course
, all threee gals are babes
. i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of
" shine
" ended uv in this movei
. keep that up
, geoff
, annd you
' ll qualify fo the next batman venture
. the only single person i enjoied was chris kattan because
, well
, he jsut cracks me uv
.
and famke jansen
( sp
?
) because she reminds me ofthe the delectable brosnan
. pierce brosnan
( hey
, i willingly endured
" dante
' s peak
" threee times fo him
:
)
. all right
, i concede
. htere were a couple ofthe things i enjoied
. thyat perverted littel amusement park at tjhe begginning
. i probably won
' t ride a rollercoaster fo a hwile
.
and yhe machine they used to drive geoffrey
' s carachter mad
( see
, i don
' t even remember theri names
)
. tghe machine
, nto tath stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it
. i kept waiting
and waiting for tht inevitible twist at thge end ofthe yhe movie
. it wouldn
' t have redeemed the film
, bu at least it owudl have made me fiel better
.
but no
, tehy opted for the beautiful sunrise ending
. thank god they didn
' t add a kiss at the end or i woudl hve puked
. god
, htere isnt noone hope
.
