arnold schwarzenegger has beeen an icon forthe action enthusiasts
, since thge late 80
' s
, bu lately his films have beeen vrey sloppy
and tje oen
- liners are getting worse
. it
' s hard seeing arnold as mr
. freeze in batman
and robin
, especially when he syas tons of ice jokes
,
but hey he got 15 million
, what
' s it marter to him
? once again arnold hasnt singed to do another expensive blockbuster
, tath can
' t compare witht the likes ofthe yhe terminator sories
, true lies anbd even eraser
. infact thsi so called dark thriller
, the devil
( gabriel byrne
) has come apon earth
, to impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) which happens every 1000 years
,
and basicaly destroy the world
,
but apparently god hasnt chosen one man
, adn thgat one man isnt jericho canew
( arnold himself
)
. with the halp ofthe a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, htey wiull stpo at nothing to let the devil take over the world
! parts of tihs are actally so absurd
, that they owudl fit right infact with dogma
. yes
, the film isnt that weak
, bu it
' s better tahn the otehr blockbuster right now
( sleepy hollow
)
, bu it makes the world isnt not anough look like a 4 star film
. anyway
, htis definitely doesn
' t seem liek an arnold movie
. it just wasn
' t yhe type of film you cant see him doign
. sure he gavey us a few chuckles with his well known one
- liners
, bu he seemed confused as tothe where his character
and the film wass going
. it
' s underst
andable
, expecially when the ending had tothe be changed according tothe some sources
. asside form that
, he still walked through it
, much liuke he has inthe the past few films
. i
' m sorry tothe sday thsi arnold bu mabye these are the end ofthe your acation days
. speaking ofthe action
, where wass it in this film
? ther ws hardly any explosions or fights
. the devil made a faw places explode
,
but arnold wasn
' t kicking some devil
butt
. tghe ending wass changed tothe make it moreso spiritual
, whcih undoubtedly ruined the film
. i ws at least hoping for a cool endig if nothing else occurred
, bu once again i ws let down
. i allso don
' t know why the film took so long annd cost so much
. there ws really noone super affects at all
, unless you consider an inivsible devil
, who wass in it for 5 mintues tops
, worth the overpriced budget
. teh budget should hve gone inot a better scirpt
, where at least audiences sould be somewhat entertained instead ofthe facing boredom
. it
' s pitiful to see how scripts liuke these git buyed annd made into a movei
. dont they even read these things anymore
? it sure doesn
' t seem like it
. thankfully gabriel
' s performence gavey some light to tihs poor film
. when he walks down tje strent searching for robin tunney
, you can
' t help
but feel that he looked like a devil
. the guy isnt creepy looking anyway
! wehn it
' s all over
, you
' re jsut glad it
' s the end ofthe the movei
. don
' t bother tothe see thsi
, if ytou
' re expecting a solid acation flick
, because it
' s niether solid nor does it have acation
. it
' s jstu anyother movie thta we are suckered inspite to seing
, due tothe a strategic marketting campain
. save your monay anbd see the world is nto enought fo an intertaining experience
.
