, george clooney
, arnold schwarzenegger
, chris o
' donnell adn uma thurman with alicia silverstone
. well tothe start thsi off i
' d jsut liek to say a couple thigsn
. first is
, i miss michael keaton
, i miss tim burton adn woudl much prefer tothe think that these lastr two batman films are all liek a dallas dream sequence
. not even ffrom hte first film was batman realyl the
' star
'
though he was damn close in yhe firt couple anyway
. in
' batman forever
'
and now infront
' batman
& robin
' he
' s almost pushed tothe being a bited player
. i cin
' t realyl say if clooney
( who reguardless was better than kilmer
) was a vyer ogod batman or not
. he
' s given next tothe nothing tothe do at all
, he might as well not hve been htere annd it wouldn
' t have made much diference
. nowe
, joel schumacher has said that he refuses tothe bend to the masses that have hated his films adn cheered fo yhe return ofthe
buton that he wont mkea batman brooding
and dark
. fine
, i mean granted
' batman returns
' hwile being an awsome film wass a bited to dark sometimes
.
yet his bright neon
, campy sytle is just killing anytying htis series meaned to me
. i
' m usually vyer easy on films
. i loved
' con air
'
and otehr films smoe critics have slammed
. granted taht film realy wass paper thin
, cliche ridden
, exept for one thnig
, it wass funn
. there isnt virutally noone fun infront thsi film at all
. i couldn
' t ahev cared less
. it
' ll thrill the littel ones as theres no violentce really
, none everyone comes out fine inwhich the end liuke those ood tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing
. schwarzenegger is awful
, i mean really
, relaly bad
.
.
. anbd this isnt coming from a regular fan of his work
. i loev his movies most ofthe tje timne annd thte basic reason is he never says much in any ofthe them
. he talks all tothe often inwhich this movie
. i owudl have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll
. i beleive to truely like a film you have to care baout at least someone inwhich a film
. i liekd alfred bu teh reason behind it isnt a cheap shot
.
