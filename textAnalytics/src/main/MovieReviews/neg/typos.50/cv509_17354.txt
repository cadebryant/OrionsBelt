: thanksgiving
. for most
, it
' s a timne tothe be with your loved ones
and enjoy a good
, hmeo
- cooked meal
. for the makers ofthe body count
,
however
, thanksgiving isnt a tyme fo mutiple murders
, voilence
, profanity
, famaly dysfunction
,
and sex
. boy
, dont i fiel all the more better hvaing sat through this crap
. alyssa milano
, tyhe fromer child star of who
' s teh boss
?
, matures tothe made
- for
- video sludge liek thsi movie
. somone somwhere thougth it
' d be a grat diea tothe pair her with rapper ice
- t
, who has since guest
- starred inthe the made
- for
- the
- sci
- fi
- channel series welcome to paradox
. this isn
' t exactly a winning combination
. outside ofthe permenantly ruining a hoilday for me
, what else may be said for this turey
? well
, it teaches us that beautiful
, attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall inaddition loev with nerds who drive down long winding roads wtih their eyes closed adn complain baout bieng english teachers
. it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic
, sticked
- up rich white people waited on by balck servants
. it shows us that ood guys
, try nto tothe laff
, sit around
and talk about
" yhe appeal of postmodernism
" durring thier free tiome
. adn
, it proves that you cxan hve sex inthe your parents
' basement wehn they hvea a dozen or so guests over
,
and no oney wiull notice
. befor i go any further
, if any young male reading htis has hopes ofthe seeing alyssa naked
, forget it
. thge filmmakers cleverly shoot tjhe simulated sex scenes in a manner that mkaes sure you don
' t see any of milano
' s attri
butes
. they dont
, howver
, inexplicably throw inspite a scene where ice
- t whistles
" jingle bells
" aftter killing people
, fo whatever tath
' s worth
. this film wass originally titled below utopia
. perhaps they should hvae renamed it hell
. avoid thsi clunker
.
