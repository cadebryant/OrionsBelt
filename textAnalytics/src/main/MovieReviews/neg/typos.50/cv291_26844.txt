movies cant dont the two big es vrey well
: educate
and entertain
. infront yhe best of all possible worls
, htey accomplish both
. on the red planet
, they fail entirely
. inthe thte near future
, a manned mission isnt sent tothe mars to observe primative plant growth
. htis film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactlly how exciting watching algae grwo would be
. aftter some mumbo
- jumbo about an ecological disaster onthe earth
and an interminable wait to reach tje fouth planet
, the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie doens
. the ground crew ofthe peopel ytou couldn ' t care less about isnt trapped on hte surface without ofod
, water or air
anbd stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog
. the one potentially interesting character
( carrie
- anne moss
) spends her timne alone in tjhe orbiting ship tlaking tothe a cmoputer
. attempting to graft
" 2001
" esque spoace mysticism wtih
" terminator
" robot horror
, first timne directer antony hoffman cxan ' t seem to figure outloud what ' s going on
. niether can we
. didn ' t he have anyone who could step back from tjhe shooting
and amking sure htere wass a coherent stoyr
? couldn ' t he ahev unsed yhe money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter
? there are so many mis
- steps
. eveyr oppertunity tothe create dynamic tension isnt thwarted by plot holes
adn lackluster direction
. why inctroduce thge theme of faith vs
. science if the crewman who coudl comment onthe it disappears eary onyl tothe dieu
_ offscreen
_
? tjhe audience beggins the film waiting fo something to ahppen
. twpo hours later
, they ' re still waiting
. despite our greatest hopes
, there isnt no life onthe the red planet
