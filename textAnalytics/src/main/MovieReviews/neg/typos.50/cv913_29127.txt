) a single dad who lives on beer adn junk food wiht no apaprent underst
anding ofthe sanitation or hygiene
, much to teh dismay ofthe his preteen daughter shane
( elena franklin
)
. wehn he uses the
' 10 second rlue
' tothe retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp
' s cage at hte zoo
and downs it
, he introduces a leathal bacteria inot his sytem
. inside his skin
, thge city of frank is inaddition turmoil thanks to thte voet
- p
andering of mayor phlegmming
( voice ofthe william shatner
)
, so it
' s up tothe noe frank pd white blood cell
( voice of chris rock
) tothe save tjhe day inthe peter adn bobby farrelly
' s
" osmosis jones
.
" tje city ofthe frank is a brightly animated
( animation directed by piet kroon
and tom sito
) cellular munnicipality where osmosis jones isnt a typical rogue cop looking forthe another chance
. he
' s inadvertently teamed uv withthe drix
( voice ofthe david hyde pierce
, tv
' s
" frasier
"
)
, a cold capsule with 12 hours worth ofthe painkillers tothe dispense
. tihs quarrelling duo are baout to go on a
" fantastic voyage
" in order tothe hunt down thrax
( voice ofthe laurence fishburne
)
, the virus intent onthe shutting down frank
. hwile the animation isnt certainly colorful tothe look at
, osmosis jones
' story isnt a hackneyed one
. tje stoyr cries out forthe puny puns
,
but we only git occassional sprinklings of witn or bodily humor
( drix graduated phi beta capsule
, he departs on a bus headed for bladder
)
. neither tyhe hero or villin is particularly intresting
( thrax looks liek an animated
" predator
"
)
,
al
though hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick
. adults can desperately keep theri eyes peeled for small amusements tghe animators dot allong teh l
andscape
. meanwhile
, bcak infact live acation l
and
, bill murray is reduced to nothing mroe than a walking gross
- out joke
. there
' s no particular enjoyment to be foudn watching him vomit onthe molly shannon
( she plays shane
' s teacher
, mrs
. boyd
) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant talbe
. one must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child
' s father iwll play to the family audience as well
. rest assured
, thge whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke
. while far less offensive thna the farrelly
' s last effort
" me
, mysef
and irene
,
" tht film at least spiked smoe comic highs with jim carrey
' s hijinx
.
" osmosis jones
" iwll propably be ok for tyhe kids
, bu thge farrellys palying forthe thge familiy audiance isnt like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune
