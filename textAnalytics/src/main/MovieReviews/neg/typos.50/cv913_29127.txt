frank detorri ' s
( bill murray
) a single dad who lives on beer
and junk food with no apparent understanding ofthe sanitation or hygene
, much tothe tjhe dismay ofthe his preteen duaghter shane
( elena franklin
)
. whn he uses the ' 10 second rule ' tothe retreive a hard boiled egg ffrom a chimp ' s cage at hte zoo
and downs it
, he introduces a leathal bacteria inot his system
. inside his skin
, teh city of frank isnt infact turmoil thanks to tghe vot
- pandering of mayor phlegmming
( voice of william shatner
)
, so it ' s up to one frank pd white blood cell
( voice of chris rock
) tothe save the day in peter
anbd bobby farrelly ' s
" osmosis jones
.
" thte city of frank isnt a brightly animated
( animation directed by piet kroon
and tom sito
) cellular muncipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking fo another chance
. he ' s inadvertantly teamed uv with drix
( voice ofthe david hyde pierce
, tv ' s
" frasier
"
)
, a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers tothe dispence
. this quarrelling duo are about tothe go onthe a
" fantastic voyae
" infront order to hunt down thrax
( voice of laurence fishburne
)
, thte virus intent on shutting down frank
. hwile teh animation isnt certainly colorful to look at
, osmosis jones ' storey is a hackneyed one
. the story cries outloud for puny puns
,
but we only get occasional sprinklings of witn or bodily humor
( drix graduated phi beta capsule
, he departs onthe a bus headed for bladder
)
. neither the hero or villain is particularly intresting
( thrax looks liek an animated
" predator
"
)
,
although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick
. adults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements hte animators dot allong the landscape
. meanwhile
, bakc in live action land
, bill murray is reduced to nothing omre tahn a walking gross
- outloud joke
. htere ' s no particular enjoyment tothe be found watching him vomit onthe molly shannon
( she plays shane ' s teacher
, mrs
. boyd
) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a erstaurant tabl
. oney must wonder how tje climatic flatlining of a child ' s father iwll play tothe tje famaly audience as well
. rest assured
, hte whole enchilada is wrapped uv with a fart joke
. hwile far less offensive than teh farrelly ' s last efort
" me
, myself
and irene
,
" that film at least spiked some comic highs wtih jim carrey ' s hijinx
.
" osmosis jones
" wiull probably be ok fo thte kids
,
bu tghe farrellys palying fo teh family audeince is liuke watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune
