the last line
( or near to that honor
) isnt tghe great
butler
, alfred
( teh ubergod
, michael gough
) saying
,
" i think we need a bigger bat cave
,
" or something tothe that note
. thta
' s exactlly what this film is
- too big for its own ogod beacuse it has too damn much
. cut batgirl outloud
. cut one ofthe yhe villains
. it
' s too much tothe h
andle inspite one dosage
. it
' s so much that characters git left behind
. poore elle gets a mere 3 scenes
and a subplot which isnt introdued
but never finished infact any way
, shape or form
.
and elle deserves better
. htis is the fouth inthe the gigantic film sories
and the second from director joel schumacher
. it
' s also tjhe fouth worst inspite tjhe series
(
and second worst from joel
)
. tyhe serieses hasnt been declining since its stunning de
but
, folowed by yhe almost
- as
- stunning sequel adn hten the anti
- climactic thrid oen
( first by joel
)
. this one
' s nto anti
- climactic
- i knew it wass gonna suck
. it
' s uv tothe joel to make it funn
though
.
" batman forever
" ws funn
. this is a big bore of over
- produced action sequences
and shallow characters
. i mean
, tihs one bited
. i
' m gonna put all tjhe plot in one paragraph
: mr
. freeze
( ah
- nold
)
, who
' s wief was dieing of smoe desease
, has become the new big villain these dyas
. he
' s a huge ex
- scientist who fell into soem weird liquid
( ehllo
? joker
?
) adn now hasnt a body temperature of a big fat zero
and hasnt a blue body
. batman
( george
)
and robin
( chris
) fight him a bited bu find htey
' re growing apart
. meanwhile
, anyother villian shows uv
, poisin ivy
( uma
!
)
, who was a dorky scientist chick wroking onthe flowers infact south amercia with a twistet scientist
( john glover
) who kills her wehn she finds out he
' s used her reasearch tothe deveop an uberman
, bane
, who is basicaly a man pumped with chemicals hwihc propably killed any personality he ever had
. she emerges fomr her chemicals
( don
' t ask
' cause i cxan
' t tell ya
) as a sexy woman
( tjhe real uma
) who
' s poisin when or if ytou kiss her
and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at peple
. she starts to tear awya at hte dynamic duo
. meanwhile
, alfred
' s dying ofthe teh same desease mr
. freeze
' s wife hasnt
( bu inspite an earlier state tahn she
)
, adn his niece
, barbara
( alicia
)
, comes all tghe way ffrom oxford without an english accent tothe git him away from thge
butler trade
,
but soon
( well
, nto really soon
, it takes her 2 hours
) becomes batgirl
. meanwhile
, in an unfinished subplot
, bruce
( batman
' s alter
- ego
, if ytou forgot
) has beeen dating the lovely julie madison
( the even lovlier elle macpherson
) who wants a committment after a year bu he sasy nothing
. end ofthe her for all we knwo
. mr
. freeze ultimately teams wtih poison ivy anbd htey want tothe freeze teh world
and
then take it over growing new plants as theri populaton
( don
' t ask
!
!
!
)
. the trio must team together
" as family
" to beated them
. htere ya go
. nto the whole stopry
but no big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! the films seems patched together of nice littel idesa which woudl hvae made for a cuple ogod sequels
.
however
, hwile tim burton nicely balanced yhe villin
/ batman storyline
(
al
though not wonderfully
)
, joel seems to dont almost nothing with batman infront this oney
. he gets smoe corny speeches
, a couple clever lines annd that
' s it
. maybe some stunts
. for all this
, i can
' t even comment onthe george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw the guy
! adn when i doed
, he had horrable dialogue to sday
. i think michael keaton is yhe quinessential batman
but val kilmer was too robotic annd fake as batman infact thte lsat episode
. george is in between them
. he
' s nto quinessential
, he
' s nto horrible
, he
' s good
. bu i
' m sure enxt time when htey deside to renovate tyhe sories since they
' ll be critically murdered forthe tihs sorry effort
, we
' ll get a good scirpt
and clooney will shine
( if he still hasnt the job
)
. the villains are the only interesting part ofthe the series according tothe schumacher
. lastest timne
, we had hte brawn ofthe two face as played by tommy lee jones anbd the brains
/ comedy supplied by tje riddler as realized by jim carrey
. thsi time we hvae a somewhat sympathetic
and somewhat hatable villain
( teh smae guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we feel bad for his mental
/ physical colapse bu doesnt he relaly need to kill everyone for plants
? arnold isn
' t very good
- too hokey bu kinda sympathetic at some points
. when he watchs ood movies ofthe his wief
, he actually looks somber
. wow
. bu uma mkaes thte most of her seductive character
, getting the right point bewteen hamminess annd seductiveness
. it
' s liuke she
' s alomst parodying herself inaddition
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she
' s incredibly hot annd makes the movie preety much a star better
. as for tje lower bat
- people
, chris isnt teh same as he ws in
" batman forever
,
"
al
though i think his owrk inaddition theese isnt too hokey wehn he
' s best at quieter parts inthe
" scent of a woman
" or jsut plain cool parts in
" fried green tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i love the girl bu she
' s nto particularly good infact this film
. she cin hypotheitically ect
, we all saw taht inthe
" clueless
,
"
but her lines kinda soudn weird
. anbd it isn
' t thte mushy
- mouth this time
.
but in all fairness
, she has virutally noone part
. joel gets around to her ocassionaly
and when she
' s on
, she doens stupid stuff
.
.
.
al
though i nkow i
' m not tghe only one who loved the catfight between her
and uma
.
.
.
and poore elle
. poor
, poore elle
. i lvoe that woman
and she can also hypothetically ect
( forthe those of us who saw
" sirens
"
)
. bu she has no part
!
!
! it seems like joel hadnt so much footage that he hadnt tothe edit alomst an hour outloud of thge final product
. ther are noone
" couch
" scenes
( liuke my best freind noticed
)
. nowe listen tothe me onthe this oen
- in eveyr
" batman
" flick
, htere
' s a couch scene
. inspite the original
, it wass with vicki
. in
" returns
,
" it wass a good mkae
- outloud scene with selena
.
and in tghe last one
, it was a chat wtih nicole
. thsi oen
, it
' s nothing
.
and batgirl doesnt next
- to
- nothing in htis film till the end whn she
' s suddenly
" part ofthe yhe family
.
" fortunately
, we git a lot ofthe alfred
. he
' s the always reliable
butler
, infact case you didn
' t know
, who hasnt beeen wih bruce all his life
. he
' s a god
. he
' s a father figure
. he
' s aslo dying
. this got tothe me
. i love alfred almost as much as bruce
and tothe see him infront a robe
, nto inwhich his tux
,
and freaking dieing just gets to me
. we also git thge diea thgat he might have been unhappy thte hwole time
.
.
. bu this isnt never anwsered
, as this film is too cluttered
. bu in defense
, it does have some ogod parts
, other thna uma
. for noe
, george is a good batman
but unfortunately gets nothing tothe do
. annd ther are some nice touches
. whn they sohw tjhe asylum at noe point
, they show tghe patient
' s belongings inthe a room
and we see the riddler
' s costume
. i laughed
.
and durring a biker scene
( involving robin
and batgirl
- anohter subplot never h
andeled past initation period
)
, we nto only see coolio bu a bunch ofthe bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" from
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all these
. thte film falls appart around the five
- minute mark durig an enormously long acation sequence hwihc must lastest around 20 minutes
.
.
. or doed it just feel liek that
? the film should serve as anohter inthe tjhe long
- line ofthe films which demonstrate that we ened moreso intelligent films nowdays
. peopel are fed uv with stupid films
. taht
' s why the word ofthe mouth killed
" thge lost world
!
" that
' s why last year
, indy films grossed mroe tahn ever
. tyhat
' s why htis iwll have a storng box
- office initative from people who just want to see it
, liuke me
,
but will die after a week or twpo when the word around teh grapevine kills it
. thgat
' s why the enxt twpo big
- budget aciton pics are john woo
' s
" face
/ off
" annd barry sonnenfeld
' s
" men infront black
,
" both whlch are the firt two tothe catch on to the wave early onthe
. i liek joel schumacher more as a person thna an artiste
. i like soem ofthe his films
(
" flatliners
,
"
" a timne tothe kill
"
) bu a lot of them suck
. he
' s a really eccentric person
and i loved noe ofthe his qoutes about how he admits tothe bieng a medicore directer adn taht
' s what makes him great
.
but his costuming for woody allen
' s
" sleeper
" ws omre interesting than this one
(
and his costuming was kool
- look for tghe nazi number
)
. i love tghe
" batman
" sories
. thte first two rocked adn i did liuke the last one
. bu htis noe isnt not gonig tothe be noe that i watch repeteadly like the otehr threee
. hopefully
, this iwll also serve as a springboard tothe a better batman next timne
.
and maybe they
' ll get smart annd bring bakc catwoman
.
and michael keaton
. bu we can only hope
.
