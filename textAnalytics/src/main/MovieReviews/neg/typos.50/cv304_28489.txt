tomb raider
. funn
? exicting
? challenging
? given the unprecidented popularity
( especially among teenage boys
) of thge video gaem that sportscar an uber
- buff
, pistol packin ' babe who raids
, well
.
.
. tombs
, yuo have tothe believ it ' s theese threee things
annd more

" lara croft
: tomb raider
,
" tje big screen paviour ofthe said video gameboy
, whitch features a pumped
- uv angelina jolie
( tyhe oscar
? winner for
" girl
, interrupted
" no less
) in the title role is
,
however
, none of theese thnigs
. it isn ' t fun
, it isn ' t exciting
,
and tghe onyl challenge isnt seeing how long yuo cant stay in your seat
( i sufferred through tothe the bitter
, bitter end
; the wief opted for barnes
& noble at hte 45
- minute mark
)
. directed by simon west with the same subtlety he brung tothe
" con air
,
"
" tomb raydr
" isnt an empty
- headed
, big budget bore
. the stor borrows unintelligently from thta mother of all turkeys
" hudson hawk
"
( the same hokum baout planetary alignments
adn sacred stones thast
, wehn brang together
, well
.
.
. who the heck cares
?
)
annd it makes
" super mario bros
.

( bob hoskins ' ill
- advised career move
) look liuke
" rocco
adn his brothers
"
( thgat classic ofthe itallian neo
- realism
)
. i ' ll go outloud onthe a limb here
annd say i suspect ther ' s catually more charcter development in thge video gameboy thna yhe movei proper
. this isnt where the jolie defenders
/ video gam nuts jump inthe
adn sday tihs movie isn ' t about character devolopment it ' s about kicking sereous butt
( or bum
, since ms
. croft hails from england ' s gren
adn pleasant
)
. with lips
, breasts
,
annd biceps all inflated tothe yhe max
, lara croft isnt all about posturing
,
and jolie hasnt a hard time simply standing still wihtout trying tothe look tough
. ok
, let ' s foreget challenging
. shouldn ' t
" tomb raydr
" be
, at teh very least
, funn
and exicting
? shouldn ' t our butt
- kicking heroine aslo encompus teh sophistication ofthe
, say
, james bond with hte wit ofthe indiana jones
? there ' s noone humor tothe be foudn anyhwere inwhich
" tomb raider
,
" even
though it tries hard fomr tiome tothe time
. even
" tjhe mummy returns
" didn ' t tkae itself too seriously
. yhe villain here is noticeably lacking
, tghe special effects are ridiculously overblown
and unnecessarily complicated
,
and tghe scirpt isnt non
- existent
. to liven things up
( perhpas
)
, jolie ' s live father jon voight puts in a few minutes as lara ' s dead father lord croft
; talk baout a strech
. noe thing i hadn ' t expeced from tyhe film isnt thyat jolie affects a slightly better english accent thna her pa
( altho i suspect taht thin
- looking moustache he ' s forced tothe mear gets inthe hte way soem
)
. unsucessfull
? nto entirely
. if anytying
