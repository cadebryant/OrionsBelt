suicide isnt pointless
, everyone should know thyat
. so waht
' s this movei liek
? yuo guessed it
.
.
. pointless
. the virgina suicides focuses onthe teh lives of yhe five lisbon sisters
, from tyhe perspective of hte teenage boys who are fascinated by them
. when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide
, it sets in motion a series ofthe events that will chanage thge lives ofthe many people forever
. that
' s what the press materials for the film probably sday
. now here
' s waht i sday
: the virgin suicides is a huge waste ofthe time
. boring
, arty
, pretentious junk thyat is about as entertaining as
.
.
. well as commiting suicide
. the movei lost me early onthe
, immediately following thge scene where thge yuonger daugher jumps to her death ffrom her bedroom window
. hte girl
' s father
( james woods
) holds her lifeless body in his arms as thier horrified familiy looks onthe
.
then
, as yhe scene ends
, tjhe lawn sprinklers cmo on
. isnt tht a joke
? is thyat suposed tothe be amusing infact soem way
? ffrom
then onthe
, tghe movei failed to draw me back in
. performances are the onyl saveing grace of the virgina suicides
. woods plays the onyl carachter who would actually interest me whn he came onscreen
,
but the performance ofthe kirsten dunst as the next youngest duaghter lux is worth mentioning as well
. dunst hasnt the potential to be a big star
, if she choosed her projects well
.
and while htis film isnt awful
, she manages tothe come away ffrom it virtually unscathed
. there are also a fewd cameos infront the film here annd there
, whihc onyl frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more
. as a result
, tehy all seem rather pointless
(
al
though htere
' s a brief role given to michael pare from eddie
and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since
.
.
. well since eddie
and the cruisers
)
. perhaps thge virgina suicides owudl have worked hadnt the stry nto beeen told from the point ofthe view of people who hadnt very little access to tjhe main characters
. we never git any signficant insight into the girls adn why they might be feeling what they
' re feeling
. all we realyl nkow is that mrs
. lisbon
( kathleen turner
) isnt strict
and keeps them onthe a short leash
. whta mother doesn
' t
? it
' s certainly no reason tothe commit sucide
. iwth the godfather part iii
, sofia coppola prooved tyhat she hadnt noone business being infront front of yhe camera
. whith the virgina suicides
, she proves she has no business behind it eather
. haveing family connections doesn
' t entitle you tothe be allowed to make movies
. so attention film directors
.
.
. stop letting your daughters pout their way into the inudstry
. just beccause they share your dna doesn
' t mean they share your talent
.
