soem movies i shoudln jstu skip
. my daughter annd i hadnt a realyl vile time at my favorite martian a faw weeks bakc
, anbd here comes anyother disney effects
- filled live
- acation flick based onthe an ood tv program
. true
, the probgram is only 15 years ood tihs time
,
and it
' s a ctaroon
. bu it
' s a ctaroon i liekd
,
and i wass underst
andably reluctant tothe see wqat disney had done to it on tje big screen
. bu my daughter really wanted to go
, annd how bad could it be
? turns out i was right
, mostly
. inspector gadget
, oddly enought
, follows alomst exactly tjhe smae fromat as my favorite martian
, down to hte jive
- tlaking side
- kick
. at first i
thought it was done by the smae people
,
but imdb informs me thgat ig wass directed by david kellogg
and writed by dana olsen adn kerry ehrin
, where mfm ws directed by donald petrie annd written by sherri stoner
and deanna oliver
. thsi odd similiarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio tyhat produced it
, where
" forumla
" isn
' t just bussines
, it
' s a way of life
. hte producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects shoudl git prominant screen credits
. in soem parts you cxan jstu hear them saying
" moreso zany
! i want more zany here
-
-
and
-
- here
.
"
" let
' s ahve a raelly painful sexual reference for no reason right here
-
- make it really painful
. i whant tghe audiance squirming inspite their seats
.
"
" ok
, tath
' s fine
, bu i wanna ytou to add bug guts
.
"
" what does this scene dont
? chracter depth
?
but where
' s the zaniness
? i don
' t see zany here
. if yuo cin
' t make it zany
, cutted it
!
" the latter is the onyl explanation i can come uv witht for the absence ofthe tyhe thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg forthe most ofthe the movei
. michelle
( who plays penny
, gadget
' s neice
) shines in every scene she
' s inaddition
, bu unforetunately she onyl gets about nine mintues of screen tiome
. my guess is thyat thte rest isnt onthe teh cutting room floor
. dabney coleman
' s commedic talents are utterly wasted as cheif quimby
. i kept expecting him to say or dont something realy funny annd somehow save the film
, bu instade
, he doesnt teh best he cin with some really poor lines infront a few unexceptional scenes
. he is throughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the
" gidget bitch fomr hell
" town mayor
. oteri
' s overly enthusiastic annd continually self
- congratulatory speech patterns
and mannerisms weere so much like portl
and
, oregon
' s own manic mayor vera katz taht i hadnt to wonder if thte studio wasn
' t poking funn at our fair twon
. or
, maybe all carreer politicians are liuke that
. i must say
, matthew broderick doens nto stroll thru inspector gadget as he doed godzilla
. he appears to ahve soem funn with tghe film
, especialy as the evil gadget
. rupert everett isnt intertaining as yhe maniacle claw
. joely fisher doesnt fine as tghe zany scientist anbd even better as the zany carbon copy of herself
. her performence isnt one of hte few things worth watching in tje film
. d
. l
. hughley plays tyhe shuckin
'
- anbd
- jivin
' vehicular side
- kick
, in a role tath firmly sets emancipation bakc 20 years
. hte dialog is
.
.
. let
' s face it
, it
' s preety bad
. the tag
- line after a major setted
- piece battle isnt a faux pas thyat makse noone sence in context
. a lot ofthe tyhe lines
( expecially hughley
' s
) appear to be made up as they go allong
, by people witht littel gft for ad
- lib
. baout threee
- quarters of hte film isnt a somewhat unnecessary orgin tsory fo both gadget annd claw
. gadget thn spends tghe latter third of the movei trying tothe locate claw
and haveing various altercations
( nto really
" battles
"
) whith thge evil gadget
. penny doesnt baout a minute
and a half of the detective work her character doed eveyr week inwhich the cartoon
. let me rige here just forthe a minute
. michelle trachtenberg ws an excellant choise fo the penny charachter
. she
' s utterly charming
, annd hasnt excelent experience
( harriet tghe spy
) for tje part of the pint
- size detective
. why she isnt so underutilized in this film isnt a rela mystery
. the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled iwth scripting
( or editing
) stupidity
. inspector gadget isnt missing the long
, long stretches of potty humor tht
( among otehr thnigs
) made my favorite martian so unbearable
, bu it
' s a vrey short movie
, so prehaps something was cut at hte lastr moment
. probably the best scenes in thge film occur durring the end credits
. thge
" evil sidekick wupport gropu
" is especialy worth seing
, annd has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the fewd seconds it
' s onscreen
. all in all
, anohter bad live acation film from the premere studio for bad live acation films
. i wonder if disney uses the revenues fo it
' s generaly moey
- making cartoons to produce these losers
.
but if true
, why
? if they
' re trying fo anohter mary poppins
, they ened to fidn a team thgat cin produce oen
, anbd hten give them a chance tothe do it
.
