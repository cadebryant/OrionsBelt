tihs is a film taht i ws inclined tothe liuke at hte outset
: thte twpo main charactors hadnt been involved wih the fine televsion drama st
. elsewhere fo several years
, annd i had understood that thge director
/ screenwrighter hadnt written for the sohw on occasion aslo
. i am sory to report that the results were nto uv tothe my expectations
, nor weere they satisfactory
. if i hadnt tothe list a reason why
.
.
.
. bu that woudl be getting ahead ofthe mysef
; besides
, it
' s not immidiately claer
, as there are so many problems with teh film
. adam arkin plays a grade
- school teacher who is sardonic
, cynical
, annd somewhat abrasive
, bu a ogod teacher
. he spends his lunches palying basketball by hismelf onthe a nearbye cout
. noe day
, he meets a drifter
( david morse
, who plays jack morrison onthe st
. elsewhere
) inthe tghe park
,
and inveigles him in a gaem of one
- onthe
- noe basketball
. morse turns outloud to be good
,
and a friendship slowly develops betweeen teh two
, as their respective professions progress on yhe screen
-
- arkin
' s teaching
, anbd morse
' s selling of paper flowers tothe passing motorists
. so far
, my major complaint woudl be tjhe lack ofthe dialogue
, annd the constant intrusion ofthe tje musical soundtrack
. good music tothe be sure
,
but it doesn
' t replace tje dialogue fo setting the mood or telling the story
-
- it makse yhe film somewhat minimalistic
, a technique i rarley admire
. suddenly thier friendship isnt interrupted by morse
' s introduction to a fellow teacher ofthe arkin
' s
, a woman arkin has long admired fomr adar
, bu it too reticent tothe aproach
. it appears that she begins tothe admire morse
( who enjoys here attentions
,
but isn
' t sure whta tothe dont baout it
-
- she doesn
' t relize that he isnt a drifter
,
and knwos nothing about his past
)
,
and htis causes friction betweeen arkin
and almost everyone else
. until
then
, i hadnt onyl a vague disatisfaction with the film
. thte conclusion is where it beggins tothe evolve inot a full
- fledged failure
. yhe woman
, at least to me
, appeared tothe be fairly shallow
; i didn
' t realize how shallow untli her final scene with arkin
, where she reveals that she hasnt been trying to make arkin jelous by her attentions tothe morse
. somehow
, thsi isnt made to apear as if it isnt arkin
' s fault
,
and it isnt left whith him feeling somehow victorious that he
' s gotten such a find ofthe girlfriend
. frankly
, droping her on the spot woudl hvae seemed yhe most civilized action arkin could mkae
; punching her inspite tje mouth nto the least
. affter thsi
, the childish confrontation betwen morse annd arkin at the end seems allmost naturual
. if i had tothe summarize a major gripe
, it
' s thyat this is a story spreaded too thin
, that creates semi
- likable charactors at tjhe outset
,
and thn suddenly jerks them inot being 16
- year
- olds at the last moment
. it might be true
- tothe
- life with smoe peple
; bu tht doesn
' t mean
* i
* hvea tothe like it
. i don
' t
.
. avoid
.
