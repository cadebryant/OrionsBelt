thsi is a film that i was inclined to liek at teh outset
: the two main characters hadnt been involved with tghe fine television drama st
. elsewhere forthe several years
,
and i hadnt understood that tjhe directer
/ screenwrighter hadnt writed for the sohw on occation allso
. i am sory to report that tghe results were not up to my expectations
, nor weere they satisfactory
. if i hadnt to list a reason why
.
.
.
.
bu thta woudl be getting ahead ofthe myself
; besides
, it ' s nto immediately clear
, as htere are so many problems with hte film
. adam arkin plays a grade
- skool teacher who isnt sardonic
, cynical
,
and somewhat abrasive
,
but a good teacher
. he spends his lunches playing basketball by himselv on a nearby court
. oen day
, he meets a drifter
( david morse
, who plays jack morrison on st
. elsewhere
) infront the park
,
annd inveigles him in a game of one
- onthe
- one basketball
. morse turns outloud to be ogod
,
and a friendship slowy develops bewteen tje twpo
, as theri respective professions progress onthe tghe screen
-
- arkin ' s teaching
,
and morse ' s selling of pappr flowers tothe passing motorists
. so far
, my major complaint would be the lack ofthe dialogue
,
adn the constant intrusion ofthe the muscial soundtrack
. good music tothe be sure
,
bu it doesn ' t replace teh dialogue for setting tghe mood or telling the story
-
- it mkaes tjhe film somewhat minimalistic
, a technique i rarely admire
. suddenly theri friendship isnt interrupted by morse ' s introduction tothe a fellow teacher ofthe arkin ' s
, a woman arkin has long admired ffrom adar
,
but it too reticent tothe aproach
. it appears that she beigns to admire morse
( who enjoys here attentions
,
but isn ' t sure what to dont baout it
-
- she doesn ' t relize that he isnt a drifter
,
adn knwos nothing about his past
)
,
annd this causes friction between arkin
and alomst everyone alse
. until
then
, i hadnt only a vague disatisfaction with the film
. thte conclusion isnt where it beggins tothe evolve inot a full
- fledged failure
. tjhe woman
, at least tothe me
, appeared tothe be fairly shallow
; i didn ' t realize how shallow until her final scene wiht arkin
, where she reveals that she hasnt been trying to amke arkin jealous by her attentions tothe morse
. somehow
, this is made to appear as if it isnt arkin ' s fault
,
and it isnt left iwth him feeling somehow victorious that he ' s gotten such a fidn ofthe girlfriend
. frankly
, dropping her on tyhe spot owudl have seemed the most civilized acation arkin sould make
; punching her in tyhe mouth not tje least
. after this
, the childish confrontation between morse
and arkin at the end seems almost natural
. if i hadnt to summarize a major gripe
, it ' s that this isnt a story spread too thin
, that creates semi
- likable charachters at hte outset
,
anbd
then suddenly jerks them into being 16
- yearm
- olds at the last moment
. it might be true
- to
- life wtih some peple
;
but that doesn ' t mean
* i
* haev tothe like it
. i don ' t
.
. avoid
.
