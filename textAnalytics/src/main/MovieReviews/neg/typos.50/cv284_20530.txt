if onyl austin powers
: hte spy who shagged me hadnt beeen just half as origonal
, zany
, silly adn totally enjoyable as its precedessor
, it would have easily been noe ofthe tihs summer
' s biggest pleasures
. if only
. in fatc
, the spy who shagged me isnt tyhe excact oposite of thge original
; instead ofthe refreshing teh audiance with one clever parody affter anyother
, the filmmakers bombard us with used
- up
, tired jokes tooked directly fomr thte first oen
. tkae thte scene where austin powers
( agina plyed by mike myers
,
but with only a fraction ofthe the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously
) confronts a henchmen on yhe side ofthe a cliff
. after being pushed off the ravine
, yhe bad guy is ofthe course assumed dead
. bu suddenly
, we hear a pleading voice comming fomr down below
; he
' s only injured
. a similair scene played vyer well inspite thge originnal international man of mistery
, bu here i ws insulted by it
. doed tje filmmakers really beileve thte audience owudl laugh at a rip
- off
? aparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie
- goer
, considering tyhat tghe film has pulled inwhich over
$ 200 millon infact domestic theatrical grosses alone
. dont i hear tjhe soudn ofthe a franchise heading our way
? hvaing said that
,
though
, i still cannot deny the film its merits
. the basic plot ws delightfully silly enough tothe sustain my interst somewhat
; dr
. evil
( mike myers
, infact the second ofthe his three roles
)
, having constructed a tiem machine
, goes back tothe the year 1969 in an attempt tothe snatch austin pwoer
' s
" mojo
"
( don
' t you just love that word
?
) whilst he isnt cryogenically frozen
. whn austin gets wind of this
( after a gerat intro explaining the absence ofthe elizabeth hurley
' s vanessa kensington
)
, he too travels back infront tyme to re
- claim his sexual drive
, accompanyed by tyhe hot
- tothe
- trot felicity shagwell
, played by heather graham
. this sounds stupid
, i know
,
but inthe the movie it starts tothe make smoe kind of weird
, off
- tghe
- wall sence
, anbd it worked for me
.
then there
' s mini
- me
( verne troyer
)
, a
.
.
. petite clone ofthe myer
' s dr
. evil
, exactly 1
/ 8 infact size
. troyer
' s persona alone gains tyhe film an extra half
- star
, contri
buting tothe one particularly hilarious scene where he attemts to nibble onthe his pwn mini
- mr
. bigglesworth
. jstu try tothe ignore tghe fatc taht
, at 2

'
'
, he owudl mkea dr
. evil
' s heiht ries tothe jsut over 21 fezent
. noone marter
. howver
, htere are only about four hearty laughs throughtout the entire hour
and a half
( hte most noteable being the nowe infamous tent scene
)
, anbd taht jstu isn
' t enought tothe warrent even a minor recommendation
. if there is infact fatc an
" austin powers 3
"
, they shoud just kill off secre agent powers anbd put the empahsis on dr
. evil anbd mini

. unconvential
, yes
,
but htere
' s no denying tath it
' d amke forthe a better movei
