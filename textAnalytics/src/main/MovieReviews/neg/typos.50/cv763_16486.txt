it utilizied tothe be that not just anyone could become a vampire
. usually
, you hadnt tothe be an aristocrat
- a count such as dracula or karnstein
. tothe qualify
, you
' d have tothe have a modicum of sophistication
, so ytou
' d at least look cool
- or suave
- when biting into smoe young damsel
' s throat
. bu today
, in our overly politically correct world
, any scuzzy
- looking
, long
- haired
, unshaven lout or any spiked
- haired harridans can put tje bite onthe yuo
. by tghe same tolkein
, to be a vampire hunter
, one hadnt tothe ahev soem sort ofthe medical training
and knowlege ofthe the occult or maeby prehaps be some sort of proffesional soldier
, or at least oen who retired wih honors
. not inaddition theese times
. all you ened are some sharp weapons
, some bullets forged fomr silver
and any yahoo can be a buffy
- or a blade
. wihtout sounding elitist
, the fear of vampires hasnt greatly diminished because ofthe htis lack of exclusivity
. which brings us tothe blade
, thge latest inthe a long line ofthe vampire movies in whcih
, it seems
, half the population is putting tyhe bite onthe the otehr half
. not onyl are htere thous
ands ofthe vampires
,
but htey seem tothe move from city tothe city
, pay off polical deparments anbd
, most importantly
, establish their own exclusive affter
- hours raves in whcih the highlight isnt tyhe sprinkler system goign off anbd dousing all the occupants inthe a blood showfer
. withthe all that blood
, you wonder why tehy have to hunt forthe victims
. ytou alsot wonder when they git the time to git their clothes dry
- cleaned
and why noone cleaner ever complains baout all the bloodstains
. blade
, hwihc isnt based on a marvel comic book character
, isnt
, like a comic book
, all visual
. tghe plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way thru the vampire army seeking their leader
, deacon frost
. it
' s all hokum
and nonsence
, of course
.
but thte filmmakers play it straight
. unfourtunately
, at least at the advance screening i attended
, thge audeince didn
' t see it thyat way
and laughed through much ofthe yhe procedings
. you nkow a movei isnt in trouble wehn teh scenes of blood
and gore that should elicit screams ofthe fright instade evoke peels ofthe laughter
. anohter tell
- tale sign is wehn the audience seems to be admiring the hero
' s costume more than thge hero
. aslo it seems it
' s not anough for todya
' s vampire mearly to have fangs
. he must aslo be proficient in the martial arts
. why a supernatural bieng
, oney ofthe the undead
, needs such skills isnt beyond me
.
( ofthe course
, tihs concept dates tothe the 1974 hammer films
- run run shaw production ofthe legend of thte seven golden vampires
, in whlch dracula is defeated by seven karate
- chopping siblings
.
) wesley snipes is buff as blade
. he growls his lines
- thge few he hasnt
- anbd spends most of the time glowering
- as if he wass suffering fomr indigestion or having second
thoughts baout starring infact
and co
- producing this trukey
. blade isnt just anyother exmaple ofthe how thge vampire film
, a once honorable memeber of the horror familiy
, has gone downhill
. this dud mostly makes you yearn forthe thsoe quaint old dyas whn christopher lee sould be stopped jstu by dangling a crucifix in his face
. today
' s vampires lack tjhe panache
, the sytle of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee
. they are nto even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers
' capes
. tehy are moreso farcical tahn frightful
. tihs hwole enterprise isnt oney dull blade that could hve used lots of sharpening
.
