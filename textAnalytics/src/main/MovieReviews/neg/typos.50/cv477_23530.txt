the premise of the new james wong film
, final destination
, is that alex browning
, hte protagnist
, prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane
, therby cheating fate
.
however
, fate is nto so easily bested
, adn alex
' s friends soon begin dying infront unusual circumstances
. essentially
, this premise is a clever
- way tothe mkae a slasher
- flick wihtout the slasher
. unfortunately
, tihs is practically hte onyl clever thing baout tje film
. as far as teen horror flicks go
, fianl destination isnt better than many
. there isnt anough shocking death
, graphic gore
,
and requisite balck humer tothe provide the essential
" roller coaster
" type thrill at the heart ofthe tghe averege horror flick
. unfourtunately
, thsi film also suffers ffrom the worst charistics ofthe thsi genre
. teh relationships between the main characters are tenous annd thier motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set
- up the next death
. hte scene where two ofthe tjhe characters break into a funeral home to veiw tyhe body ofthe their recently killed friend isnt suppose to be scary anbd dramtic bu features smoe ofthe thge dumbest dialogue i hve witnessed
. if you are looking fo a saturday inght thriller tothe scare your date
, htis film might do the trck
. other thna that
, wait untl it goes into hevy
- rotation onthe cable
