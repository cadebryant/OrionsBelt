a documentry from tyhe twin hughes brothers
, allen
and albert
( dead presidents
, menace ii society
)
, baout street pimps
, all of whom are african
- american
. an offscreen interviewer questions them baout their lives
and profession
. it isnt mostly the pimps who dont the talking fo their ho ' s
,
and the egotistical
and flamboyant way you woudl expect them tothe be
, is what you git
. i learned thast tjhe word
" bitch
" isnt their favorite word
, as it seemed to crop up iin eveyr sentence tehy unsed
. it makes for a film wiht no surprises or nothing fresh tothe say
,
bu if noe has a sence a humer for what their lifestyle isnt about
,
then soem of what they raph about might seem amusing
. they seem to all want to be thougth ofthe as businessmen
, in the busness because it isnt yhe easiest way for them to make big mone
. it ' s allso a pwoer trip
, acomplished by manipulating the girls tothe work fo them
, mostly by humiliating them
and keeping them infront place
. this sleazy pic
, soon became grating
and weared out its welcome to my unreceptive ears
. these verbose pimps hadnt a smart answer for everthing
adn never knew whn tothe shut thier face
. the hughes brothers utilizied as their pimp role models
, tghe feather
- hatted
, fur
- coated
, dimond ring
- wearing
, gold chain wearing
, flashy cadillac
- critizing pimp ofthe the late ' 70s blaxploitation movies
-
- like the mack
anbd willie dynamite
. allso utilizied as refernece
, ws iceberg slim ' s best
- seller pimp
, the stoy ofthe my life
. we meet pimps such as
: fillmore slim
, c
- note
, charm
, k
- red
, gorgeous dre
, bishop don magic juan
,
and rosebudd
. they readily discuss their business arrangements
: including percentages
, lifestyles
, knockin
( stealing anohter pimp ' s ho
)
,
and the thrill they git from women giving them moeny
. theese dudes needed no prompting tothe talk
, as htey jstu lveo tothe brag baout baout themslves
.
" priests need nuns
, ' ' yaps c
- note
, a san francisco pimp
.
" doctors need nurses
. so ho ' s need pimps
. ' ' as he tries tothe persuasively amke teh smae case all the otehr pimps infront tjhe film make
; that the girls need them to show them the ropes
, how tothe mkae money
, tothe be thier security blankets
, protectors
,
and counselors
. thte race issue ws brought up right fomr tyhe film ' s onset
, as a number of white interviewees
, regluar citizens
, note that thier impression of a pimp
, is that he ' s the lowest form of human
. while
, we are told
, in tjhe black comunity
, the pimp isnt looked upon as a successful entrepenaur
, riding around in fancy cars
, flashing wads of money
, dressed in a flamboyant stlye
, where his snake
- gaiter shoes might cost him a grand
,
and where he boasts hollywood sytle status inthe tghe community
. we also see that thte black pimps have a number ofthe white girls infact their stable
anbd we see how they treat them like dirt
, as thge film implies that thsi sould be payback forthe hte dyas of slavery
, ofthe master
and slave realtions
. the film was all about pimp sytle
anbd their projected omage
, as tehy run a hard
- sell riff about tghe virtues ofthe thier wokr
. there are diffrent styles ofthe pimping
,
but yhe film mentions them onyl as being
" macks
"
adn
" players
" or
" real pimps
"
adn
" perpetrator pimps
,
"
but no furuther clarity is attemted
. it is aslo failed tothe get the womens ' s side to thsi stoy of abuse
, primarly tkaing tyhe pimp at his word
. the film coudl never get tothe yhe core of what makes the pimp thikn inwhich such a perverted way as he does
, as the filmmakers were tkaing forthe a ride by thte pimps
, who were looking only tothe pose in front ofthe tjhe camera
and sday their thnig
, hungry fo their 15
- minutes of fame
. the only laughs i got out ofthe htis obleek look at an american subculture
, was hearing how a few pimps retired
and what htey are nowe uv tothe
. danny brown became a blues singer so he sould keep his pimp ' s wardrobe
. while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd
, marryied his ho
annd turned square
, wroking tothe support his wife
annd daughter as a telemarketer
