' s
, anbd the egotistical
and flamboyant way ytou would expect them to be
, is wqat you get
. i learned thta the word
" bitch
" is theri favorite owrd
, as it seemed to crop uv inaddition every sentence they utilisied
. it mkaes forthe a film wiht no surprises or nothing fresh to say
, bu if noe hasnt a sense a humor fo whta their lifestyle isnt baout
, thn some of waht tehy rap baout might seem amusing
. they seem to all wnat to be
thought ofthe as businessmen
, iin the buisness beccause it is the easiest way fo them tothe make big money
. it
' s also a power trip
, accomplished by manipulating thte girls to work forthe them
, mostly by humiliating them adn keeping them in place
. thsi sleazy pic
, soon bcame grating
and wore outloud its welcome tothe my unreceptive ears
. theese verbose pimps hadnt a smart answer for everything
and never knew when to shut their face

' as he tries tothe persuasively mkea the smae case all tje otehr pimps inspite the film mkae
; that hte girls need them to sohw them thte ropes
, how tothe make mnoey
, tothe be their security blankets
, protectors
, annd counselors
. hte race issue was brought up right ffrom tyhe film
' s onset
, as a number ofthe white interviewees
, regluar citizens
, onot that their impression ofthe a pimp
, isnt that he
' s the lowest form of human
. hwile
, we are told
, in the balck comunity
, the pimp isnt looked upon as a succsessfull entrepenaur
, riding arround iin fancy cars
, flashing wads ofthe money
, dressed in a flamboyant style
, where his snake
- gaiter shoes might cost him a gr
and
, anbd where he boasts hollywood sytle status iin the comunity
. we also see taht the balck pimps ahve a number of white girls iin their stable adn we see how htey treat them like dirt
, as the film implies that htis coudl be payback for the dyas ofthe slavery
, of master anbd slave realtions
. the film was all about pimp stlye adn their projected image
, as they run a hard
- sell riff about thge virtues of their wokr
. htere are different styles of pimping
, bu the film mentions them onyl as bieng
" macks
" annd
" players
" or
" rela pimps
"
and
" perpetrator pimps
,
"
but noone furuther clarity is attempted
. it isnt also failed tothe git the women
' s side to this story ofthe abuse
, primarily taking the pimp at his word
. the film could never get tothe thte core of what makes thte pimp thiunk in such a perverted way as he does
, as the filmmakers weere tkaing for a ride by the pimps
, who weere looking only to pose inwhich front of thte camera
and sday their thnig
, hungry for their 15
- mintues of fame
. the only laughs i got out of tihs bleak look at an american subculture
, was hearing how a fewd pimps retired
and waht they are now uv tothe
. danny brown became a blues singer so he sould keep his pimp
' s wardobe
. while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd
, marryied his ho
and turned square
, wroking to suppost his wief
and daugher as a telemarketer
