this movie is based off thge wildly popular video
- agme serieses of tyhe smae name
. befoer this film
, the gameboy hadnt a fewd spin
- off cartoons
- which were ok
.
bu the idae of doing a movei is insane
. it shouldnt have been animated
, if it shouldnt have beeen done at all
. instead hte people dont tghe best they can with a talented casted
.
yet it still fails
. the plot isnt completely differnt from thge game ' s plot
- i ' m nto complaining about thyat
. the story involves the mario bros
. having a plumbing busness in brooklyn
annd haveing to compete withthe a rival comapany
. eventually they find a consttruction site by theri nemesis
, wich happens to be enviromentally un
- safe
. so
, due tothe luigi ' s
( john leguizamo
) girlfriend
- princess daisy
- they go
anbd investingate
. tehy git transported to a blade runner
- esque world lead by king koopa
( dennis hopper
)
. somehow a plot dealing iwth all thge dinosaurs being mutated
adn transported tothe an alternate futuristic mega
- city jumbles infront
. the plot isnt fine
- better thna tghe movie deserves
. tjhe acting isnt ok
. this seems tothe be moreso ofthe a visual film
. the special effects are good
, especially on tje robotic yoshi
.
however the film drags
adn is no fun
.
and it leaves itself ope to a sequal
, which probably won ' t ever be made
. thsi movei beggins sort of promising
,
but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth
. so if yuo want tothe watch a sort of odd movie starring hte excellent dennis hopper
,
thne watch super mario bros
.
: the movei
. you sould do worse
.
bu you sould definitely do better
.
.
.
. strent fighter
: thte movei
( 1995
) starring
: raul julia
and jean claude van
- damme thsi movie wass based off ofthe a serieses of never ending sequels tothe a agme called street fighter 2
. it hasnt all teh characters from the agme infront a reasonable plot
. it is more like a
" movie
" than it shoudln be
. yes
, it ' s watchable
. raul julia does a good job
, considering this ws his final film
. hwile hte game had non
- stop fighting sequences
, this movie isnt a hodge
- podge of action scenes
annd flashy sets
and costumes while trying tothe show off a plot at thge same time
. does it wokr
? sort of
.
.
. thte plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m
. bison
( raul julia
)
. guilia
( jean claude van
- damme
) tkaes his troops to attack bison ' s main base in an attemp tothe liberate yhe innocent villages he hasnt taken over
. in a short amount ofthe tiome
, the movei introduces several characters well
. it catches your attension
.
bu it ultimatly seems liuke a showcase for fans ofthe the gae so ytou can point outloud things like
" there ' s chun li
!
!
" or
" look at tht fire
- ball ryu did at vega
"
. it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot wih ogod sets
,
but goes no furuther
. htis movei needed omre acation inspite thte frist palce
. the action scenes tht are here are short
and not vyer exciting
. if yuo like ight
- hearted action flicks
, or if ytou liked thte game
, watch this one
. it is even worth watching if yuo want tothe see raul julia ' s last performance
, or if ytou can ' t git enought ofthe van damme
. other than that
, yuo sould find better action ficks
.
