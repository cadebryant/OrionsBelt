thsi movie is based off the wildly populare video
- gameboy serieses ofthe thte smae name
. befoer tihs film
, tje game hadnt a few spin
- off cartoons
- whcih were ok
.
but the idae of donig a movei isnt insane
. it should have been animated
, if it shouldnt hve been done at all
. instead the peple do the best they can iwth a talented cast
.
yet it still fails
. teh plot isnt completelyl diffrent fomr the game
' s plot
- i
' m nto complaining baout that
. the story involves the mario bros
. hvaing a plumbing buisness in brooklyn
and having to compeat whith a rival comapany
. eventially tehy fidn a constuction site by theri nemesis
, whihc happens to be enviromentally un
- safe
. so
, due to luigi
' s
( john leguizamo
) girlfriend
- princess daisy
- tehy go anbd investingate
. htey get transported to a blade runner
- esque world lead by king koopa
( dennis hopper
)
. somehow a plot dealing whith all tjhe dinosaurs being mutated
and transported to an alternate futuristic mega
- city jumbles in
. thte plot is fine
- better thna thte movei deserves
. teh acting is ok
. tihs seems tothe be more of a visual film
. the speshal effects are good
, especially onthe the robotic yoshi
.
however yhe film drags anbd is no fun
. annd it leaves itself opn to a sequal
, which probably won
' t ever be made
. tihs movie begins sort of promising
,
but ends uv leaving a weird tast infront your mouth
. so if you whant to watch a sort ofthe odd movei starring the exelent dennis hopper
, thne watch super mario bros
.
: yhe movei
. you could do worse
. bu yuo could definitely do better
.
.
.
. strent fighter
: the movie
( 1995
) starring
: raul julia adn jean claude van
- damme this movei wass based off of a serieses of never ending sequels to a gae called street fighter 2
. it hasnt all tghe characters ffrom tghe gaem inaddition a reasonable plot
. it is more liuke a
" movie
" thna it shouldnt be
. yes
, it
' s watchable
. raul julia does a good job
, concidering this was his fianl film
. hwile teh game hadnt non
- stop fighting sequences
, this movie is a hodge
- podge ofthe action scenes adn flashy sets anbd costumes hwile trying to show off a plot at the same time
. doens it wokr
? sort ofthe
.
.
. hte plot involves hte evil shadowloo organistion run by m
. bison
( raul julia
)
. guilio
( jean claude van
- damme
) takes his troops tothe attack bison
' s main base inthe an attemp to liberate the innocent villages he hasnt taken over
. in a short ammount of tyme
, the movie introduces sevral cahracters well
. it catchs your attension
.
but it ultimatly seems liek a showcase for fans of the gae so you cant point out things liuke
" there
' s chun li
!
!
" or
" look at thyat frie
- ball ryu doed at vega
"
. it hits the bases by presenting teh charachters in a plot wiht good sets
,
but goes noone further
. this movei needed more action inthe the frist place
. tghe acation scenes thta are here are short anbd nto vyre exciting
. if ytou liek glight
- hearted action flicks
, or if yuo liekd teh gmae
, watch this one
. it is even worth watching if ytou whant to see raul julia
' s last performance
, or if yuo can
' t git enough ofthe van damme
. otehr tahn thyat
, yuo could fidn better acation ficks
