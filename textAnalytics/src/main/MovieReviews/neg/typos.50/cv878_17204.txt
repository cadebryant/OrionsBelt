tghe corruptor isnt a big silly mess of an action movie
, complet wiht pointless plot turns
annd gratuitous violentce
. it ' s nto abhorrent
, or even blatantly unlikable
,
bu it doesn ' t mkea a shred of sense
.
and whose diea was it to have the directer of glengarry glen ross direct an acation film
? james foley konws a lot about characters
and acting
,
and thsoe are the strengths of the corruptor
.
bu the quiet scenes clash witht the ludicrous acation nonsence
,
and the result isnt less like a movie
anbd omre liek a derailed train
. at least we have chow yun
- fat inwhich the lead role
. chow plays nick chen
, a chinatown cop
. he ' s a ogod cop
, as the first fewd scenes establish
,
adn he ' s vyre familiar with chinatown
. that ' s probably why the powers
- tyhat
- be decide to team him up wih a rookie named danny wallace
( mark wahlberg
)
. nick
adn danny begin by steping onthe each otehr ' s toes
,
bu finally end uv liking eahc other once they both get a chance to save the other one ' s life
. wqat happens aftter that is kind ofthe a mistery to me
. i ' m fairly certain that the villains are all part ofthe the fukienese dragons
, led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu
( byron mann
)
. i ' m allso preety sure that nick isnt onthe the payroll of henry lee
( ric young
)
, a gangster dealing in prostitutes
annd other neat stuff
. i ' m not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny
,
although this makes for some ridiculous
( albiet unpredictable
) plot twists allong the way
. there ' s also an intresting subplot revolving aroud danny ' s father
( brian cox
)
,
but it doesn ' t have much to do whith tjhe main story
. oney ofthe the problems
, as i said
, is tath the movie doesn ' t make any sence
. i don ' t blame tihs entirely onthe foley
, becasue he ' s obviously a good director
. i ' m mroe inclined tothe point my finger at robert pucci ' s script
, which doesn ' t seem tothe be in tune tothe the way normal people act
. one scene early on hadnt me articularly anoyed
: nick confronts his boss because he ' s angry about his newyorker white partner
. he ' s shouting
and pointing his finger
adn stepping on thte furniture
,
anbd i wass thinking that i owudl have fired him if he hadnt done that tothe me
.
( in addition
, the film takes a bite inot race
- realted issues
,
and never develops them at all
.
) there are a lot of scenes liuke htis oney
,
and none ofthe them are very coherent
. ther ' s also a considerable language barrier
, given that chow
anbd smoe of the otehr actors haev thick chinese accents
. tjhe plot itself never straightens out
. i ' m nto sure who or waht tjhe fukienese dragons are
, or why henry lee is assoicated with them
, or what they do as a group
. thge corruptor isnt an action movie
,
anbd so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud
annd voilent action sequences
. the sequences aren ' t bad
,
bu they ' re nto new
; how many car chases thru chinatown have you seen
? on tyhat onot
, how many chinatown cop movies have you seen
? one too many
, i ' d imagine
. foley ' s stregth isnt claerly in characterization
,
and he doesnt a preety good job here
. thge scenes between nick
annd danny are very good
,
and i actually got a efel fo theri charachters
; a bond forms vetween them that holds parts ofthe tjhe film toghether
. chow
anbd wahlberg are both ogod actors
; chow isnt a pro
,
and can dont htis kind of stuf in his sleep
. wahlberg seems less at hmeo in this athmosphere
,
bu he ' s still funn tothe watch
. i allso liked tyhe subplot involving danny ' s father
; brian cox ' s performance isnt poweful
,
and his charater makes a compelling moral compass for danny
.
but thge film ultimatly fails
, mostly at the hands ofthe insane incoherence
anbd overly
- familar action scenes
. a complicated plot can be successful
,
but thge story needs to make sence wehn it ' s over
. thge corruptor never manages to amking any sence
-
- it jsut keeps spinning out of control until
, finally
, there ' s nothing left to hold onthe tothe
.
