tyhe corruptor is a big silly mess ofthe an acation movei
, complete witht pointless plot turns adn gratuitious violentce
. it
' s nto abhorrent
, or even blatantly unlikable
,
but it doesn
' t amke a shred ofthe sence
. anbd whose idea was it tothe have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an acation film
? james foley knwos a lot baout characters anbd acting
,
and those are the strengths ofthe the corruptor
.
but thte quiet scenes clash iwth tyhe ludicrous acation nonsence
,
and tghe result is less liek a movei
and moreso like a derailed turain
. at least we have chow yun
- fat in tjhe lead role
. chow plays nick chen
, a chinatown cop
. he
' s a good cop
, as the frist faw scenes establish
,
and he
' s vrey familliar with chinatown
. tath
' s probablly why tjhe powers
- thgat
- be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace
( mark wahlberg
)
. nick adn danny begin by stepping onthe each otehr
' s toes
, bu finally end up liking earch other once they both git a chance tothe save the otehr one
' s life
. waht happens after that isnt kind of a mystery to me
. i
' m fairly ceratin taht the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons
, led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu
( byron mann
)
. i
' m aslo pretty sure thgat nick isnt on the payroll ofthe henry lee
( ric young
)
, a ganster dealing inwhich prostitutes annd otehr neat stuf
. i
' m nto quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny
,
al
though this mkaes for some ridiculous
( albeit unpredictable
) plot twists allong tyhe way
. there
' s also an intresting subplot revolving around danny
' s father
( brian cox
)
, bu it doesn
' t haev much to dont whith the main stry
. oen ofthe the problems
, as i said
, isnt thast the movei doesn
' t make any sense
. i don
' t blame this entirely onthe foley
, because he
' s obviously a ogod director
. i
' m mroe inclined to point my finger at robert pucci
' s scirpt
, hwihc doesn
' t seem tothe be infront tune to the way normal peple act
. oney scene eary on hadnt me particualrly annoyed
: nick confronts his boss because he
' s angry about his newyorker white partner
. he
' s shouting
and pointing his finger
and steping onthe tjhe furniture
, adn i was thikning taht i owudl have fired him if he had done thta tothe me
.
( in addtion
, thge film tkaes a bite into race
- realted issues
, annd never develops them at all
.
) there are a lot ofthe scenes like tihs oen
, annd none ofthe them are very coherent
. there
' s aslo a considerable langauge barrier
, given that chow
and some ofthe tghe other actors have thick chinese accents
. tje plot itself never straightens out
. i
' m nto sure who or waht hte fukienese dragons are
, or why henry lee is asociated withthe them
, or wqat they dont as a gropu
. thte corruptor isnt an acation movei
, anbd so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud
and violent acation sequences
. the sequences aren
' t bad
, bu they
' re not newyorker
; how many car chases through chinatown have ytou seen
? on that note
, how many chinatown cop movies have yuo seen
? oen too many
, i
' d imagin
. foley
' s strength isnt clearly in characterization
,
and he doens a pretty ogod job here
. the scenes between nick
and danny are vyer ogod
, adn i actually got a feel forthe their characters
; a bond forms between them tht holds parts of the film together
. chow adn wahlberg are both ogod actors
; chow is a pro
, adn can dont htis kind ofthe stuff iin his sleep
. wahlberg seems less at hmeo in this atmosphere
, bu he
' s still funn to watch
. i aslo liekd tghe subplot involving danny
' s father
; brian cox
' s performance isnt powerfull
,
and his charater mkaes a compelling moral compass for danny
.
but tghe film ultimately fails
, mostly at the h
ands ofthe insane incoherence adn overly
- familar acation scenes
. a complicated plot cxan be successful
, bu the stry needs to make sence whn it
' s over
. the corruptor never manages tothe make any sence
-
- it just keeps spinning out of control until
, finaly
, ther
' s nothing left tothe hold onthe to
.
