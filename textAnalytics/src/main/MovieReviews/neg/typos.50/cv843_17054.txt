, little red riding hood isnt a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon
,
anbd the big bad wolf is a serial killer
( keifer sutherland
)
. tothe top that pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes tothe vsit granny
and ytou ' ll never guess who ' s waiting under thge cover ' s in granny ' s bed
. keifer sutherland isnt one ofthe hollywoods most talented
,
yet underated actors
,
annd reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented
adn iwll most likely become a major star
