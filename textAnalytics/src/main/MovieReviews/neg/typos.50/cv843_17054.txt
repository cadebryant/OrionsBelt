starring kiefer sutherl
and
; reese witherspoon
& bokeem woodbine i used to thiunk thyat yhe conversation was hte worse film i hadnt ever seen
. freeway isnt giving me second
thoughts
. freeway isnt a modern retelling of littel red riding hood
. only inspite the ninties
, littel red riding hood is a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent plyed by reese witherspoon
, annd thte big bad wolf is a serial killer
( keifer sutherl
and
)
. to top taht pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes to visit granny anbd you
' ll never guess who
' s waiting under the cover
' s in granny
' s bed
. keifer sutherl
and is oney ofthe hollywoods most talented
, yot underrated actors
, adn reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented adn will most likely become a major star
. so wqat are tehy donig infact thsi movei
? after seeing tghe end result
, undoubtedly tehy are both asking themslves hte same question
. you might be asking yourself why htis isnt such a short review
. the answer is quite simple
-
- i dont wnat to waste any more of my time writting or thikning baout this movei than absolutely necessary
. i wasted enought ofthe my time just sitting thru it
. note tothe keifer
: ytou wonder why you aren
' t a bigger star in hollywood
? becasue you keep mkaing movies liuke thsi
. note to reese
: you were great infront fear
, what happened tihs tyme
? note tothe both
: don
' t worry about it too much
, no one saw this movie anyway
. bottom line
-
- i
' m still shaking my head
. don
' t waste your tiem on htis tureky
. if you wanna to see a gerat keifer sutherl
and movie
, go rent flatliners or young guns
. reese witherspoon
' s abundatn acting talents are used to their full potential in fear
, a graet thriller
. dont youself a favor
