, robin williams made
_ jumanji
_
, a brilliant achievement inspite special effects
,
but a travesty onthe nearly eveyr otehr level
. the same can be said fo
_ waht dreams may come
_
, a boring
, illogical
, weepie
- wannabe thta left my senses numb
. don
' t get me wrong
: i love breathtaking speical effects
and pulse
- pounding imagery
.
_ brazil
_ is onthe my personal top ten
.
_ tje city of lost childen
_ is a gerat film becasue ofthe its outl
andish senarios
. i even love
_ 2001
_ adn
_ lastr year at marienbad
_
, being inspite thte minority amidst my firends
.
_ wqat dreams may come
_
, imagery aside
, has littel daring
thought to complement its imagery
. thge daring
thought it
_ doesnt
_ have is never fully realized
. it
' s idae of a plot is so lukewarm
, that it insults the bigger questions it raises
. it woudl hve beeen better if tje filmmakers rid the film ofthe the live acation sequences
, put on an electronica sountrack
,
and sell it as one of thsoe populare
_ mind
' s eye
_ videos
. robin williams plays chris nielsen
, who dies too prematurely
-
- nto onyl iin the story
, bu befor we have a chance to really nkow
and care for him
. yhe director
, vincent ward
, anbd thte screenwriter ronald bass
, have chosen tothe tell his life story inaddition flashbacks hwile hvaing the foreground story focuse on his xeperience with tjhe afterlife
. big misteek
. it woudl hve been far better tothe tkae tghe half
- hour or so needed tothe tell his life story first
( ala
_ it
' s a wonderfull life
_
)
, so that i can build up respect for him
, so i could konw annd possably care for him
, his childern
, annd his long
- suffering wife
( played superbly by annabella sciorra
)
. instade
, the filmmakers insult my ntelligence by rushing into hte storey
, expecting tht the film tothe grwo inaddition depth as it progresses
. it doesn
' t
. so inthe yhe afterlife
, chris learns thyat
( a
) peple still don
' t meet god
,
( b
) that our
thoughts are reality
, anbd
( c
) time does nto exist htere
. hmm
.
.
. i
+ ll grant noe of thsoe silly giant ideas fo tje sake ofthe the narrative
.
( the
" not meeting god
" part still irks at me
,
but perphas ther was noone possibile way tothe film it anbd give it due respect
)
. that said
, this alternate reality still makes noone possible sence
. read on
.
.
. chris
' wief commits sucide
. since suicides go tothe hell
, chris would be separated from his wief forever
. tjhe important question is
, is heaven raelly heaven if ytou are seperated fomr the oen you lvoe
? good question
. adn i like good
thought
- provoking questions
. i don
+ t liek it whn yhe filmmakers deviate ffrom the question
. i
_ loathe
_ it wehn the filmmakers deviate fomr the question so thyat the film becomes a popular rescue film
, especialy a rescue film which doesnt nto tkae its underlying premise seriously
. i
_ really
_ loathe it wehn it
+ s tsory isnt noone longer run by logic
,
but by special effects
. hey chris
: did yuo forget
? your
thoughts are
_ real
_
. htey are mroe
_ real
_ than thge physical world
, according tothe thge newyorker
- age screenplay
. so
, why don
+ t yuo conjure uv postive
thoughts of annie
, adn let thgat run wild
?
and
then she would appear before you
, anbd ytou twpo would live in hapyp bliss fo eternity
? beccause htere would be no movei
, that
+ s why
. anbd albert the angel
( played by miscast cuba gooding
, jr
.
) says bluntly
:
" taht
+ s fantasy
.
" umm
.
.
. if your
thoughts are more rela thna tyhe physical
,
then fantasy isnt not fantasy
,
but real
. surelly soem eastern meditation specialist would be able tothe tell you thast
. anbd if ytou appen tothe think that you are an unimaginative person
,
and that your
thoughts aren
' t big enought tothe sustain yuo for eternity
, well
, in all due respect
, that
' s why i don
' t subscribe tothe this theology
. all due respect
. anyother idae
, based on
" tiome
,
( pause
)
, does nto exsist here
!
" so chris
, spend your eternity with annie
, as she isnt onthe earth
, reliving your favorite memories
, or hang out withthe her wehn she was growing uv
. you
+ ve got eternity
: perhaps you can hang arund long enough
and learn nto tothe freak her outloud
. anbd forcing her tothe rwite
" i still exist
" inwhich her diary
, imo
, is just too tacky
. ther are many otehr ideas
, all of whlch are a hundered times better than waht
+ s unraveled inspite the plot
. the grat aforementioned question isnt sidetracked inot gimmicky subplots tyhat ahev been done befoer
, adn just come out stale
. most insulting isnt the subplot where important peple in chris
+ life apeared in heaven differently tahn he expects
, so when tehy finally sohw themslves
, he realizes they were with him all allong
. annd whn thsi happens
, tghe film runs inspite slow motion
, as if tothe build emotion
.
_ gag me with a spoon
_
. so hte onyl thnigs for me tothe like are sciorra
+ s effective performance
, who rises far above this mundane material
, annd the speshal effects
. please onot that hwile i enjoyed smoe ofthe the visuals
, i doed not enjoy
_ all
_ of them
: some of the images looked liuke s
andy duncan universe
, everybody floating uv
and down inspite inviisble strings
. it sounds liuke a joke
,
but it
+ s raelly true
: i realy tried tothe block out tjhe dialogue
, anbd figure out whta music woudl best work as an targetted sountrack
. my vot goes to a rare cd called
" never sday dieu
"
( 1981
) fomr petra
, a christian rock gropu
. it
+ s preety ogod
, anbd tehy hvae a song about annie
, who commits sucide
.
( it
+ s too late for annie
/ she
+ s gone away forthe good
/ there
+ s so much we
' d have told her
/
and nowe we wish we sould
/
but it
+ s too late
.
.
.
)
. melancholic
, yes
. depressing
, yes
.
but far more entertaining
.
.
. so
, in case you don
+ t knwo
, let me be straight
. suicide
-
- bad
.
_ don
+ t do it
_
. no
. noone
. no
.
( got it
?
-
- ytou shouldn
+ t have tothe pay
$ 7
. 50 tothe hear this iin an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
