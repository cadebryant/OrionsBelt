, robin williams made
_ jumanji
_
, a brillant achievement inaddition speical effects
,
bu a travesty onthe nearly every other levle
. thge same cin be said for
_ what dreams may come
_
, a boring
, ilogical
, weepie
- wannabe tath left my senses numb
. don ' t get me wrong
: i loev breathtaking speshal effects
and pulse
- pounding imagery
.
_ brazil
_ isnt onthe my personal top ten
.
_ the city of lost children
_ is a great film because ofthe its outlandish senarios
. i even lvoe
_ 2001
_
and
_ lastr year at marienbad
_
, bieng in teh minority amidst my firends
.
_ waht dreams may come
_
, imagery asside
, hasnt little daring thought tothe complement its imagery
. thge daring throught it
_ doesnt
_ have is never fully realized
. it ' s idea ofthe a plot is so lukewarm
, that it insults the bigger questions it raises
. it woudl have beeen better if thte filmmakers rid the film of the live acation sequences
, put onthe an electronica soundtrack
,
and sell it as one of thsoe populare
_ mind ' s eye
_ videos
. robin williams plays chris nielsen
, who dies too prematurely
-
- not onyl inwhich the story
,
bu before we have a chance to really nkow
and care for him
. the director
, vincent ward
,
and tghe screenwrighter ronald bass
, hvea chosen tothe tell his life story in flashbacks hwile haveing tjhe foreground stroy focus onthe his expreience with tghe afterlife
. big misteek
. it woudl haev beeen far better tothe take hte half
- hour or so needed to tell his life story first
( ala
_ it ' s a wonderfull life
_
)
, so that i cin build up respect forthe him
, so i sould know
and possably care for him
, his children
,
adn his long
- sufferring wief
( played superbly by annabella sciorra
)
. instead
, the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the sotry
, expecting thta the film tothe grwo in depth as it progresses
. it doesn ' t
. so iin the afterlife
, chris learns thgat
( a
) people still don ' t meet god
,
( b
) tyhat our thoughts are reality
,
anbd
( c
) time does nto exist ther
. hmm
.
.
. i
+ ll grant one of thsoe silly giant idaes fo the sake of teh narrative
.
( the
" not meeting god
" part still irks at me
,
but perhpas ther ws no possable way tothe film it
anbd give it due respect
)
. that said
, this alternate reality still makse noone possible sence
. read on
.
.
. chris ' wife commits sucide
. since suicides go to hell
, chris would be separated ffrom his wife forever
. tje important question is
, isnt heaven relaly heaven if you are separated ffrom thge one you love
? good question
.
and i like good thought
- provoking questions
. i don
+ t liek it wehn thge filmmakers deviate fomr the question
. i
_ loathe
_ it when the filmmakers deviate ffrom the question so thgat the film becomes a populare rescure film
, especialy a rescure film which does nto tkae its underlaying premise seriously
. i
_ really
_ loathe it whn it
+ s story isnt noone longer run by logic
,
bu by speshal effects
. hey chris
: doed you foreget
? your thoughts are
_ real
_
. htey are more
_ real
_ tahn the physical world
, according to thte new
- age screenplay
. so
, why don
+ t ytou conjure up positive thoughts of annie
,
anbd let taht run wild
?
adn
then she would apeared befor yuo
,
anbd you twpo would live in happy bliss for eternity
? baceause there would be noone movie
, that
+ s why
.
adn albert tghe angel
( played by miscast cuba gooding
, jr
.
) syas bluntly
:
" tht
+ s fantasy
.
" umm
.
.
. if your thoughts are moreso rela than the fysical
,
hten fantasy isnt nto fantasy
,
but real
. surelly smoe eastern meditation specialist owudl be able tothe tell ytou that
.
annd if you happen to thikn that you are an unimaginative person
,
and thyat your thoughts aren ' t big enough to sustain ytou forthe eternity
, well
, infact all due respect
, tht ' s why i don ' t subscribe tothe htis theology
. all due respect
. another idea
, based onthe
" time
,
( pause
)
, doens not exist here
!
" so chris
, spend your eternity with annie
, as she isnt on earth
, reliving your favorite memories
, or hang out witht her wehn she was growing up
. yuo
+ ve got eternity
: perheaps you can hang around long enough
and leran nto to freak her out
.
and forcing her tothe wriet
" i still exsist
" iin her diary
, imo
, is just too tacky
. ther are many otehr ideas
, all of which are a hundered times better tahn what
+ s unraveled iin the plot
. thte great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have beeen done before
,
anbd jstu come outloud stale
. most insulting is the subplot where important peopel in chris
+ life appear in heaven differently tahn he expects
, so when they finaly sohw themselves
, he realizes they were with him all along
.
and whn tihs happens
, the film runs in slow motion
, as if to build emotion
.
_ gag me with a spoon
_
. so the onyl thnigs forthe me to like are sciorra
+ s effective performence
, who rises far above this mundane material
,
anbd tje spacial effects
. please onot that while i enjoyed soem of the visuals
, i did not enjoy
_ all
_ of them
: some of thge images looked like sandy duncan universe
, everybody floating uv
annd down infact inviible strings
. it sounds liuke a joke
,
but it
+ s really true
: i realy tried tothe block outloud the dialogue
,
annd figure outloud waht music owudl best owrk as an alternative soundtrack
. my vtoe goes to a rare cd called
" never say die
"
( 1981
) fomr petra
, a christian rock group
. it
+ s preety good
,
and they hve a song about annie
, who commits suicide
.
( it
+ s too lite for annie
/ she
+ s gone awya fo ogod
/ ther
+ s so much we ' d haev told her
/
adn nowe we wish we coudl
/
bu it
+ s too lite
.
.
.
)
. melancholic
, yes
. depressing
, yes
.
bu far more intertaining
.
.
. so
, infact case ytou don
+ t know
, let me be straight
. sucide
-
- bad
.
_ don
+ t dont it
_
. no
. no
. noone
.
( got it
?
-
- you shouldn
+ t have to pay
$ 7
. 50 to hear thsi in an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
.
