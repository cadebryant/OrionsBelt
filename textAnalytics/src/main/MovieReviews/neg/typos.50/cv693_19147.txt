i have nothing agianst unabashedly rumatic films
. when done right
, with at least slightly evident resturaunt
, htey can be engaging
, sweeping
, appealing
. bu it
' s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless inwhich seattle
, a hollow
, boring romance that should appeal only to hte most gullible of viewers
; the ones willing to buy into ephron
' s whiny views of life anbd romance
. tom hanks adn meg ryan
, two of hollywood
' s most likeable stars play sam baldwin
and annie reed
, repectively
. baldwin
' s wife recently died
and he moved tothe seattle with his son
, jonah
, seeking to git awya from teh familiar surroundings whihc remind him ofthe his late spouse
. jonah senses tension
and calls a talk radio show tothe tell the world about their problems
. sam seems ready tothe strangle his son for calling thte sohw
,
but when he gets onthe tjhe phone he begins pouring his heart outloud
. ephron has him do thsi so tyhat annie reed
( meg ryan
) can hear it
. annie isnt a hapyp woman
. she isnt engaged tothe walter
, an allergy
- prone wokring man adn seems to be perfectly content
.
but affter hearing sam thge widower on the raido sohw
, she becomes conviced taht he isnt her destiny adn is willing to risk her engagment fo it
. five years aftter thsi movei hit theaters
, hanks
, ryan annd ephron would team uv again infact the far better
,
al
though still sub
- par romantic comedy you
' ve got mial
, which isnt about people who hite eahc otehr inspite real life falling inwhich love on teh internet
. at least that movei hadnt a sence ofthe spontaneity
. here it seems thgat hte firt one hundred minutes exsist solely tothe set uv fo tyhe lastr five
. tyhe fatc thyat sam anbd annie wiull fianlly meet is so excruciatingly obvious thta everything eles isnt perfunctory
. sleepless in seattle isnt full of wonderful performers
; fomr its twpo leads tothe supporting stars liuke bill pullman
and rosie o
' donnell
.
but none ofthe them cxan save the film fomr bieng a bore
. its characters are dull annd empty
, its script isn
' t funny or particularly charming
. hte scirpt hasnt a fundametal problem
: annie gives up
, forthe little reason
, her life with walter tothe persue
" sleepless in seattle
,
" whom she hasnt never even seen
. it
' s the kind of life decision that real peopel don
' t mkea
,
and its a major
, unforgiveable plausibility sacrafice
. inthe essence
, htis movie
' s purpose is to head towords a gool that shouldn
' t even exist
. it
' s a ten minute short film with ninety
- five minutes ofthe filler
. if yuo were to sohw me sleepless inspite seattle anbd i didn
' t have to review it
, you could just call me
" asleep inaddition philadelphia
.
