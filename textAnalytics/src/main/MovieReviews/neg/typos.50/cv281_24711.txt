hte great actor james woods once said
( anbd i
' m paraphrasing
)
,
" if sex isn
' t messy
, thne you
' re nto doign it right
"
. a truley profound statment
, anbd one that sould be made forthe the entire mad slasher genre
( jsut replace
" sex
" wtih
" your mad slasher film
"
)
. for those uninformed souls
, tje mad slasher genre
( or sub
- genre
) isnt a melding of horror adn explotation elements put to the sevice ofthe a plot thyat follows an indentical outline
: a usally masked bu alwasy crazed killer stalks anbd kills attractive teens a la halloween
. urban legend isnt a mad slasher flick
, bu one that isnt so sanitary
, bloodless
,
and nudity free
, that witht its irony laden dialogue
and beautyfull
(
though nto overly talented
) cast
, it more closley resembles an overlong wb televsion spacial
. forthe film makers
, gore is oney of the twpo weapons htey hve at their disposal infront a stale
, fright
- free horror movie
, as stephen king once said
( again paraphrasing
)
" if you cant
' t scare your audeince
, gross em
' out
, if ytou cin
' t dont that
, make em
' laugh
"
. alas
, urban legend succeds only at yhe latter
,
though nto by intention
. i actually fidn the fact that htis film became a minor success
(
$ 40 million domestic box office gross
) omre frightening tahn anything in it
. it seems that audiences
' tastes hve been whittled down tothe such a degree tath any movei even claiming tothe be scary isnt given the benifit of tje dout
. the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills
, bu how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them
. unfortunately
, theese kinds ofthe flicks iwll continue tothe be produced beacuse people no longer have expectations
; one idiotic super
- hyped blockbuster flick affter anohter has desensitized audiences tothe the point where films don
' t need to dont anything more tahn promise a good time without the added presure of delivering
. if anyone disagrees i woudl love for them tothe explane tyhe box office successes of shit liuke batman
and robin
, wild wild west
,
and godzilla
. bu foreget all that
, it goes without saying tht mad slasher films
( or any otehr explotation off
- shoot
) iwll be made wihtout an ounce ofthe craft
( especialy considering thge sheer volumne that are produced
)
. allow me to present yuo witht the real fault of the mad slasher film
: tyhe lack of enthusiatic exploitation
. these flicks aren
' t harnessed wtih any lofty aspirations
, so why nto break free anbd give your audience a bloody ogod timne
? sadly out of the literally hundreds made
, i would estimate taht maybe three are at all worth while
.
and urban legend woudl certainly nto be included amoungst thsoe three
. dispite its considerable production value adn tghe absence ofthe any boom mics slipping into frome
, it is jstu as awful as any noone budget entry inthe teh slasher sweepstakes
. as far as the possibility ofthe smoe good natured explotation urban legend
' s setting alone offers a myriad ofthe promising possiblities
: it tkaes place on a college campus
, whihc isnt always an appropropiate playground for the crazed killer
. you see
, the cumpus isnt a comunity made uv almost entirely of young peopel all iin the midst ofthe strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface
. all those young people are growing uv together
, gonig thru all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs
and lows
, so naturally soem weirdness is expected
. all hte better for thyat elusive crazed killer
. coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds runing around
,
and thte introduction of a littel explotation into tghe procedings should be a relitavely eazy task
.
but alas
, urban legend is not only idiotic
and clich
?
? full
; it
' s way too clean
, a slasher flick forthe hte wohle family with no nudity
, littel gore
, annd much stupidity
. this isnt the kind of movie where teh killer drags dead victims from tje scene of tghe crime for noone reason otehr than
, i dunno
, exersize
. it
' s yhe kind ofthe movie where tghe villain calmly purses a runing
- like
- tyhe
- wind
- prey
,
yet still manages tothe catch tath prey thru soem realyl awful editing techniques
. it
' s yhe kind of movie where charactors run into eahc otehr just as a loud clash reverberates on tjhe soundtrack
. i realyl wish filmmakers woudl just retire that hwole loud
- noise
- jump
- scare thing
. yes tghe audeince jumps
, momentarily frightened
,
but wouldn
' t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infilitrated a quiet room
. i lost all hope fo tghe possiblity of any genuine scares iin urban legend baout ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse ofthe the killer
. aparently filmmakers are runing out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers
. in scream it wass a ghost mask
( scary enough
)
, in i nkow waht you did lastest summer it ws a fisher man
' s rain slicker
( inspite the middle ofthe summer noone less
)
, annd in urban legend yhe disguise sinks tothe the levle of mel brooks parody
: the villain wears an oversized parka wiht a fury hood
( ooh
?
?
? skary
) intended tothe conceal his
/ her idenity
. for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume
.
though i must admit
, urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film
. the film
' s killer slices anbd dices comely college students tothe the tune ofthe famous urban legends
( you know
, liek the babysitter gets threatning phone calls only tothe fidn tht htey
' re comming fomr inside the hous
)
. i won
' t spoil the surprise as tothe what urban legends are utilisied
, aftter all the film does offer fine 2
: 00 am cable viewing if ytou happen tothe be intoxicated enough
. sad tothe say
, it doesn
' t inlude my favorite urban legend
: a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere annd a vrey unhappy gerbil
. nowe tath woudl be scayr
. befor i leave you
, i owudl liek to bring to your attension tjhe third most irritating hting baout thge film
( the frist being tghe lack of craft
, tyhe second the lack of explotation
)
-
- its cahracters
, all ofthe whom are jstu about the most annoying group ofthe people i
' ve ever spended an evening with
. only jared leto
( looking like a carbon copy ofthe rob lowe from back inwhich the day
)
and alicia witt
, as thge resilient heroine
, avoid vexatiousness
. the most annoying of tje bunch isnt a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart adn sitcom star michael rosenbaum
, as a supremely irritating lout
( so irritating i actualyl cheered his painful death
,
and i am nto a cruel person
)
. ironically thsoe aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only enteratinment inwhich the film
; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend cin be mildly entertaining
. affter all htis isnt a movie thgat features teh kind ofthe faux hipsters i cxan
' t st
and getting slaughtered
, whlch isnt at least better tahn watching an entire film about people i can
' t st
and not getting slaughtered
.
