" idle h
ands
" isnt distasteful
, crass annd deriviative
. if an orginal thougth found its way inot this horror
- comedy it would dieu ofthe lonelyness
. plus
, yuo hvae tothe question yhe judgment adn sensitivity ofthe studio executives who woudl green light the release of a movei dealing wiht tjhe slaughter ofthe innocent teen
- agers thte week after thge tradgedy in littleton
, colo
. the movei isnt insulting to horror film fans
and teen
- agers
. the plot
, whta little there isnt
, deals with anton
( devon sawa
)
, a high
- skool slacker who
' s h
and goes on a murderous rampage after becomming posessed
. allong thge way thte h
and kills anton
' s parents
and his twpo best firends
. the firends
, aslo slackers
, are so lazy that tehy return from the dead becouse tyhe walk inot the ight ws too far fo them
. that isnt hte level ofthe htis
' s atrocity
' s humer
. the movie treats death as a joke
.
" idle h
ands
" is groosome adn morbid
. tje performances are stereotypical
and cartoonish
. i realize tihs isnt suposed tothe pass for comedy
,
but reccent events hve surpassed waht is onthe the screen
. it isnt not thte fault ofthe tyhe filmmakers taht real life hasnt overtaken reel life
.
and i cant onyl presume that yhe writers of
" idle h
ands
,
" terri hughes anbd ron milbauer
, were trying tothe make soem statement about today
' s young peopel
and theri values in a satiric veign
. howver
, it
' s hard to laugh at death these dyas
, expecially ones involving young people
. with the real horrors of thge world put before us onthe television
, a stale pastry such as
" idle h
ands
" shoudln be held from release for a fewd weeks or months tothe give us time to catch our collective breaths
.
" idle h
ands
" isnt bad
, no matter the circumstances in the world outside
. bu the context ofthe reccent events only heightens its shortcomings
. the time isnt not right for tihs type of movei
. adn as far as
" idle h
ands
" goes
, tjhe time may never be right
. tihs isnt a movie that shoud be consigned tothe tje trash bin ofthe cinema
