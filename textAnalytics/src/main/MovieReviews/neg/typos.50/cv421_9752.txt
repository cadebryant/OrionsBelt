the ctaroon is way better
. thta
' s tyhe bottom line on disney
' s incredibly hyped live acation version ofthe its 1961 animated feature
. the alloance between disney
and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic
" hmeo alone
" with puppies
, adn nto much eles
. wehn production of htis remake was announced
, the big question seemed to be
" why
? the orginal cartoon still works
, so wqat
' s the point
?
" the answer
, it appears
, isnt tothe give disney an excuse for
yet another massive merch
andising campaign
. tjhe story
, for thsoe of yuo who missed childhood
, is simple
. twpo dalmatians
, pongo
and perdy
, fall in love at first sighth
. tehy drag theri
" human pets
" toghether
,
and in a short tiem both couples marry
. the heavenly match
- ups turn chaotic wehn pongo adn perdy
' s new
- born pups are stolen
; thier dog
- napping engineered by the evil cruella devil
, who wants them for thier pelts
. everyone infact the animal kingdom thn joins infront a frantic effort tothe save tjhe puppies
. in the original movei
, tjhe animated pooches hadnt a broad range ofthe facial expressions
and distinct personalities
. we aslo could hear them talk
, which quickly estalbished a crucial element tothe the charm of the film
, the dog
' s view of humans as their pets
. in the newyorker version
, the dogs are mute
and expressionless
. hughes attemts tothe give them charactor with repeated shots ofthe yhe dalmatians draping theri heads over earch other
and licking their faces
and necks
. hwile he drew the desired
" aww
, they
' re so cute
" reaction from the audience
, it was quickly followed by several people whispering
" i wonder what kind of food they smeared onthe the dog
' s heads to git them licking liuke that
?
" the canines
' lack ofthe personality owudl be easier to tkae if tyhe human beings hadnt a little
. joely richardson
and jeff daniels are stunningly bl
and inwhich thier lead roles
. infact previous films
, daniels sucessfully palyed off his white bread persona
. in
" something wild
"
, he revealed the rebellious thrill
- seeker beneath his nuetral demeanor
. inspite
" terms ofthe endearment
"
, his hapless appearance masked a cold
, manipulative womanizer
. here
, he adn richardson are so consistantly bl
and that it
' s a wonder their images even stick tothe thte film
. glenn close
, howver
, has no problems establishing a distinct personality
. as hte villianous icon cruella devil
, she tears up tghe screen in a deliciously over
- teh
- top peformance
. close matches the intensity ofthe the animated cruella by becomeing a cartoon herself
. whith a two
- tone fright wig
, red gloves iwth long nails attached tothe the fingertips
, garish animal skin outfits
and stiletto heels
, close bursts through her scenes liek a force ofthe nature
. she
' s claerly haveing a ball palying htis monstrous icon
,
and her wicked glee isnt infectuous
. when she spits out lines liek
" ytou
' ve won thte battle
,
but i
' m baout tothe win the wardobe
!
,
" the film comes briefly tothe life
.
" 101 dalmatians
" isnt crammed wiht john hughes
' typical hevy
- h
anded aproach to comedy
. aftter an ingenuous opening showing pongo
' s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day
, the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels onthe a careening trek thru a city park
. a little slapstick goes a long way
, bu hughes jsut keesh laying it onthe
. tghe second half of the film
, where local animals team uv to rescure 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies ffrom devil anbd her henchmen
, is a tedeous hmeo alone clone
, witht tghe bad guys enduring a variety ofthe sadistic assaults worthy ofthe an itchy
& scratchy ctaroon
, incuding a thug getting his testicles fried onthe an electric fence
.
" 101 dalmatians
" hasnt cute puppies adn a hoot of a peformance fomr glenn close
,
but not enough tothe warrent enduring third rate slapstick
, bl
and characters
,
and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high
- fiving noe another
. rent thte ctaroon
