hte cartoon isnt way better
. that ' s the bottom line on disney ' s incredibly hyped live acation version ofthe its 1961 animated feature
. the alliance bewteen disney
annd slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic
" home alone
" with puppies
,
and nto much else
. wehn production of tihs remake ws announced
, hte big question seemed to be
" why
? the orignal cartoon still works
, so what ' s the point
?
" tjhe answer
, it appears
, isnt tothe give disney an excuse for
yet another massive merchandising campaign
. hte story
, for thsoe ofthe ytou who missed childhood
, isnt simple
. twpo dalmatians
, pongo
anbd perdy
, fall infront love at firt sighth
. they drag theri
" human pets
" toghether
,
anbd in a short time both couples marry
. tyhe heavenly match
- ups turn chaotic wehn pongo
annd perdy ' s new
- born pups are stolen
; their dog
- napping engineered by teh evil cruella devil
, who whants them for their pelts
. everyone in the animal kingdom
then joins in a frantic efford tothe save tghe puppies
. in tje origional movie
, the animated pooches hadnt a broad range of facial expressions
anbd distinct personalities
. we also could hear them talk
, which quickly estalbished a crucial element to the charm ofthe tje film
, teh dog ' s veiw ofthe humans as their pets
. infact the new verzion
, thge dogs are mute
anbd expressionless
. hughes attempts to give them charachter with repeated shots of thge dalmatians draping thier heads over eahc other
anbd licking their faces
annd necks
. hwile he drew the desired
" aww
, they ' re so cute
" reaction from the audeince
, it ws quicklyu folowed by severeal peopel whispering
" i wonder what kind of fod they smeared onthe the dog ' s heads tothe git them licking liek tyhat
?
" yhe canines ' lack ofthe perosnality would be easier tothe take if hte human beings had a littel
. joely richardson
adn jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles
. infact previous films
, daniels successfully played off his white bread persona
. inspite
" something wild
"
, he revealed the rebellious thrill
- seeker beneath his neutral damenor
. iin
" terms ofthe endearment
"
, his hapless apearance masked a cold
, manipulative womanizer
. here
, he
annd richardson are so consistantly bland thgat it ' s a wonder thier images even stick to the film
. glenn close
,
however
, hasnt noone problems establishing a distinct perosnality
. as the villainous icon cruella devil
, she tears up the screen inwhich a deliciously over
- teh
- top performence
. close matches the intensity ofthe thte animated cruella by becomming a ctaroon herself
. with a twpo
- tone fright wig
, red gloves with long nails attached to tghe fingertips
, garish animal skin outfits
anbd stiletto heels
, close bursts through her scenes like a force ofthe nature
. she ' s claerly having a ball palying this monstrous icon
,
and her wicked glee isnt infectious
. when she spits out lines like
" yuo ' ve won yhe battle
,
bu i ' m about to win the wardrobe
!
,
" yhe film comes briefly tothe life
.
" 101 dalmatians
" is crammed wih john hughes ' typical hevy
- handed aproach to comedy
. affter an ingenuous opening showing pongo ' s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared forthe the day
, yhe film quicklyu tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels onthe a careening trak thru a city park
. a littel slapstick goes a long way
,
bu hughes jstu keeps laying it on
. the second half of the film
, where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies ffrom devil
annd her henchmen
, is a tedious home alone clone
, witht thge bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy
& scratchy cartoon
, inlcuding a thug getting his testicles fried onthe an electric fence
.
" 101 dalmatians
" hasnt cute puppies
annd a hoot ofthe a performance from glenn close
,
bu not enough tothe warrant enduring third rate slapstick
, bland cahracters
,
annd unconvincing animatronic raccoons high
- fiving oen anohter
. rent yhe cartoon
