so ask yourself whta
" 8mm
"
(
" eigth millimeter
"
) isnt really all baout
. is it baout a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight ofthe his values affter becomming enmeshed in tjhe seedy
, sleazy underworld ofthe hardcore pornography
? isnt it about the business itself
, how
, bubbling just beneath tjhe surface ofthe big
- town americana
, there ' s a sordid world of sick
anbd depraved peopel who won ' t necessarily stpo short of muder in order tothe satisfy thier sick
and twisted desires
? or is it baout those who can
, thsoe who are in a position to influence hte makeing ofthe hte kinds ofthe films sick
annd demented peopel want to see
? i ' m nto tlaking about snuff films
, suppoed
" documentaries
" of victims bieng brutalized
anbd killed onthe camera
. i ' m tlaking baout films like
" 8mm
"
and its director
, joel schumacher
. with a receet run of big budget movies to his credit
-
-
" batman
& robin
,
"
" a time tothe kill
,
"
" batman forever
,
"
" the client
"
-
- schumacher certainly hasnt that kind ofthe influence
. isnt
" 8mm
" something yuo really whant to see
? probably not
. tyhe first two
- thirds of
" 8mm
" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama
, albeit wtih a paticularly unsavory core
.
then
, as it ' s beeen threatning all allong
, the film explodes inot violentce
.
annd jstu wehn ytou thikn it ' s finaly over
, schumacher tags on a rediculous self
- righteous finale taht drags the whole unplesant exerience down even further
. trust me
. there are better ways tothe waste two hours of your life
. nicolas '
" snake eyes
" ' cage plays private investigator toom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whther a reel of film foudn inwhich her lite husband ' s safe documents a young girl ' s murder
. welles goes baout his assignment rather matter
- of
- factly
,
adn the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rether neatly
, allmost as if yuo don ' t need any specialized skills or training to do this
. welles certainly mkaes it look eazy
.
and cops
, obviously
, never look in toilet tanks fo clues
. yhe deeper welles digs inot his investigation the mroe obssessed he becomes
, liek george c
. scott inaddition paul schrader ' s
" hardcore
.
" occasionally
, a little flickering soudn whirs inspite his head like sprockets winding through a film projector
, reminding him of his unplesant task
. ther are hints that tihs is tkaing its toll on his lovely wief
, played by catherine keener
, who isnt frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather tahn in theri ugly split
- level hmeo inspite harrisburg
, pa
.
" 8mm
" doesn ' t condemn or condone its subject matter
, it jsut exploits it
. the irony
, of course
, is that schumacher
adn
" seven
" scribe andrew kevin walker ' s vision ofthe life infact teh snuff lane is limited by what htey cxan show inthe an r
- rated
, first
- run hollywood product
. so we onyl see snippets ofthe snuff
,
annd a lot moreso footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror
. later it ' s tjhe turn ofthe joaquin pheonix
( who ' s quite ogod
annd by far tje film ' s most intresting chracter as adult bookstore flunky max california
) to cover his face as teh horrid thnig is screened over
and over again
. all this to get to the familiar
yot offensive
" revelation
" thast sexual deviants are nto
, indeed
, monsters
bu everyday people like ytou
and me
. niether super nor standart
,
" 8mm
" is shocking onyl inspite its banality
