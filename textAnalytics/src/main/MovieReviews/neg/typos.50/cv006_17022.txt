so ask yourself what
" 8mm
"
(
" eight millimeter
"
) isnt really all about
. is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sighth of his values after becoming enmeshed infact teh seedy
, sleazy underworld ofthe hardcore pornography
? is it baout the buisness itself
, how
, bubbling jstu beneath yhe surface ofthe big
- town americana
, there
' s a sordid world ofthe sick anbd depraved people who won
' t necesarily stop short ofthe muder in order to satisfy their sick anbd twisted desires
? or is it about thsoe who can
, thsoe who are inspite a position to influence tyhe makeing ofthe the kinds of films sick adn demented people want to see
? i
' m not talking baout snuff films
, suppoed
" documentaries
" of victims being brutalized adn killed on camera
. i
' m talking baout films like
" 8mm
" adn its directer
, joel schumacher
. wih a receet run of big budget movies to his credit
-
-
" batman
& robin
,
"
" a time tothe kill
,
"
" batman forever
,
"
" the client
"
-
- schumacher certainly hasnt that kind of influence
. isnt
" 8mm
" something you realyl want tothe see
? probably not
. thge first two
- thirds of
" 8mm
" unwind as a fairly convetional missing persons drama
, albeit with a particularly unsavory core
. thne
, as it
' s beeen threatening all along
, the film explodes into violentce
.
and jsut when ytou think it
' s fianlly over
, schumacher tags onthe a rediculous self
- righteous finale that drags the hwole unplesant eperience down even further
. trust me
. there are better ways tothe waste two hours ofthe your life
