thge most absurd remake ofthe 1998
? it
' s a toss uv betwen gus van sant
' s pyscho
and mighty joe young
, the newyorker disney picture based onthe the ood rko picture
.
( i knew i was inspite trouble wehn a polished
, cmoputer
- generated version ofthe that famoust rko logo appeared befor tjhe head credits
.
) there isnt noone grat dem
and for anohter giant ape movie
- mkea that ape movei
, preriod
.
( wittness the quick deaths of buddy
, born to be wild annd congo
.
) annd hwile htis latest entry is inoffensive
and watchable
, it
' s alsot an assembly line product thru
and through
, lacking the charm adn unpredictability ofthe the jungle serials that partly inpsired it
. theron isnt jill young
: as a young girl in the wilds ofthe africa
, she befriended a baby gorilla affter both thier mothers weere slain by poachers
. that baby gerilla
( nicknamed joe
) grows tothe immense propotions
, adn adult jill basicaly bides her tyme looking after him
, playing hide annd seek with him
and guarding him against poachers
. enter conservationist greg
( paxton
)
, who convinces jill to move iwth joe tothe california
, where tehy cin protect him better infront a controlled enviorment
. joe is restless at firt
; no sooner does he finally suttle inspite tothe yhe new palce than thsoe nasty poachers show up in l
. a
.
, plotting joe
' s demise
. suffice it tothe sday
, tjhe movei could hvea been called
" joe
: ape in the city
.
" theron
( so good in devil
' s advocate
)
and paxton
( so ogod iin the reccent a simple plan
) are fine actors
, bu nto fine anough to transcend the material
, a paint
- by
- numbers scirpt from the hack writers ofthe superman iv anbd mercury rising
. teh plot arguably borrows mroe from steven spielberg
' s the lost world than the 1949 original
, wiht the cmoputer
- generated t
- rex
- i mean
, joe
- wreaking havoc on the busy streets forthe an encore
; thte storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final thrid
, with jill shouting
,
" look
, joe
' s headed fo tje movie theatre
!
" followed by a shooted of joe scaling mann
' s chineese theater
; a moment later
, jill shouts agian something like
" look
, joe
' s headed forthe an amusement park
!
" adn what dont you nkow
, there
' s joe at the pallisades carnival
, sacrin the bejesus out ofthe innocent thrillseekers
. tyhe seams of lastest
- minute edits tothe mighty joe young show
- unrelated scenes are patched toghether with quick dissolves
. tje movie sure feels uneven
, regardless
: act twpo isnt underdeveloped
, hwile a little ofthe joe smashing cars infact ect three goes a long
, long way
. underwood
( tremors
, speechless
) wass perhaps not hte directer fo tghe job
; even teh plentiful
, untamed l
andscape looks dull inaddition his h
ands
.
( capturing tghe beauty of nature requires more thna his point
and shoot style
.
) i did enjoy certain sequences
, especially the demoliton ofthe a balck
- tie dinner sequence
;
and the prologue
, howver implausible
, is touching
.
( as a tyke
, joe acts just like e
. t
.
) rick baker
' s amke
- up effects
and puppetry are oust
anding
, thge rela star of the show
- yot
, for all its technical flawlessness
, tjhe creature remains too grumpy anbd homicidal to love
.
( his facial expressions are varations onthe a scowl
.
) to be fair
, i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children
- it
' s a wonder i ws able tothe decipher thge dialogue
. it
' s certainly nto a film for veyr young kids
- intense fighting scenes may scare them
, hwile any time joe
' s nto on camera may bore them tothe tears
.
( onot
: older boys are omre likely tothe be dazzled by theron
' s colourful array of tank tops
.
) i suspect bl
and mighty joe young is passable enteratinment fo a familiy outing
,
but they sure don
' t amke
? em liek tehy unsed to
