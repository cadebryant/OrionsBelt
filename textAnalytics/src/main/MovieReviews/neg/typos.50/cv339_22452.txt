. comments
: house on haunted hill is based upon tjhe originnal 1958 film ofthe tyhe same title directed by william castle
and starring vincent price
. in an obvious homage
, the millioniare
' s name isnt price anbd he sports a thin mustache like price unsed to have
. this isnt a pretty bad horror film
, yot bad horror films somtimes are very intertaining
,
and hous on haunted hill is jsut such a film
. it isnt
, suprisingly
, better tahn anyother recent haunted house remake
, thte haunting
, a film whihc owes its basis to teh classic horror novel by shirley jackson
. thte haunting hadnt literary pretensions anbd fell flat on it face
. house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b
- movei 40 eyars old
and makes noone illusion that it
' s a crappy horror movie
. thus
, somehow
, it proves slightly mroe sucessful
. i can
' t thiunk of another recent film whihc has had such an eclectic casted
. it isnt thsi cast whihc lifts thsi ho
- hum thriller into a borderline intertaining exersize infront camp horror

' s intertaining to see
" qualiy
" actors in bad movies
. mroe surprises
? rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure
( rather lamely too
)
,
and singer lisa loeb
(
!
) appears as a tv news reporter
. yhe highlight of hte cast
,
however
, has to be saturday ngiht live memeber chris kattan
. kattan
' s comic sense provides several ogod hmorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprieter ofthe yhe former sanitarium
. hwile the first half of tyhe film leaves the audience guessing as tothe what
' s exactly gonig onthe
, the second half dissolves into st
andard ghost sotry stuff anbd loses soem ofthe its suspense
. a disappointingly cheesy endig really mars thsi movie too
. hous onthe haunted hill
, i suspect
, has jsut about left yhe second
- run theaters
. it
' s worth catching onthe cable enxt yera
, if yuo git a chance
. if you have a choice
, pik this movie over teh haunting
, it
' s the better of two evils
, yuo sould sday
.
though
, mroe appropriately perhpas
, it
