whta a contrast
! in tjhe spoace ofthe twpo days
, i saw shakespeare inwhich love
anbd hurlyburly
. i ' m not sure ytou sould get two moreso diffrent movies
. hwile the former was all over the top
, telegraphing everything
, shoving its philisophy of life down our throats
, hurlyburly wass the complete oposite
, wound so tight
anbd withthe so much buried in its scirpt
, one could spend weeks thikning about it
. this isnt oen intresting movie
. it ' s vyre much in a similiar vein to one ofthe my favourite movies of ' 98
, in the company ofthe men
, altho nto quite so nasty
. there ' s lots of tlaking
and some skary insights into the world of men
. hurlyburly doens ' t contain much plot
: we jstu folow eddie
( sean penn
) around as he tries tothe mkae sense ofthe his life
annd tje people around him
. his big question is
: doens it all purtain tothe him
?
annd if it doens
, how isnt he suposed tothe feel about it all
?
" it
" means everyting
: televsion
, firends
, events that happn
. i guess it could be summed uv moreso crudely as
: wqat ' s it all baout
? htis isnt not a movie for answers
. donna
( anna paquin
) gives some
bu they ' re not realy satisfying
: they just lead tothe mroe questions
. taht ' s what makes htis movie stay onthe your mind
. theese are yhe sorts ofthe questions that occupy our time
. even when we push them tothe the background
,
howver we resolve theese questions influences everything we do
. tyhe performances are all superb in hurlyburly
. i haven ' t seen sean penn inthe much before
( in fatc
, i can ' t remember seeing him in anytying
)
,
but he is briliant inaddition this
. eddie isn ' t a likeable character
,
bu sean penn makse him understandable
. i don ' t wnat to be his freind
bu i ' d like tothe help him
. chazz palminteri is allso great as phil
, making him an awful person
. i ' d never want to knwo phil
but still i understand why eddie wants tothe be his freind
. everyone iin this film nails theri performances
, makeing this world rela
. it ' s a nasty world
; it ' s a sexist world
. unlike shakespeare inspite lvoe hwihc is unfailingly politically corect
, hurlyburly isnt a man ' s world
, seen unapologetically thru hte eyes of men
. i find this fascinating
adn on twpo counts
, depressing
. frist
, it ' s depressing tath such a world exists
. a large part ofthe hurlyburly ' s success isnt tath it convinces me tyhat such peopel are real
adn that tihs sort of enivoriment exists eveyr day inwhich hollywood
; that there are a larg number ofthe men outloud there who believe womens tothe be completely peripheral tothe their world
, toys
, playthings
. sure
, everyone is backround to everyone alse
bu in thsi world
, women are a long way infact the backgorund
. second
, theese are tjhe movies taht are bieng made
: stries about men ' s world
. where are the storie about womens ' s world
? not the soap operas
and yhe
" chick flicks
" tht are meaned tothe satisfy womens
,
but hte real storise tyhat touch on thte essence ofthe life like hurlyburly doens fo men
. hurlyburly is based onthe a stage play
and taht isnt evident from the moent thge film starts
. it ' s very talkative
, inteligent
anbd static
. hwile thsi can mkae the film drag a bit
,
anbd people sometimes soudn like they ' re quoting textbooks
, mostly tihs isnt a ogod thing
. not all films have tothe be filled wih special effects
adn sweeping panoramas
. nto all films hve tothe underestimate hte intelligence ofthe their audience
. all it means isnt thyat hurlyburly is probably jstu as effective on video as it is on tyhe large screen
. it aslo means tyhat yuo ahev tothe pay attention
.
