what a contrast
! in tjhe spoace of twpo dyas
, i saw shakespeare in loev annd hurlyburly
. i
' m nto sure yuo could git two mroe different movies
. hwile teh fromer wass all over the top
, telegraphing everything
, shoving its philosphy of life down our throats
, hurlyburly was thge complete oposite
, wound so tight
and witht so much buried in its scirpt
, oney sould spend weeks thikning about it
. this isnt oen intresting movie
. it
' s very much in a similar vein tothe noe ofthe my favourite movies ofthe
' 98
, inaddition thte company of men
,
al
thought nto quite so nasty
. htere
' s lots of tlaking adn some scary insights inot the world ofthe men
. hurlyburly doens
' t contain much plot
: we just follow eddie
( sean penn
) around as he trys to make sense of his life
and the peple arund him
. his big question is
: does it all purtain to him
?
and if it does
, how is he suppossed to fiel baout it all
?
" it
" means everything
: television
, friends
, events that happen
. i guess it could be summed up omre crudely as
: what
' s it all baout
? this isnt nto a movei fo answers
. donna
( anna paquin
) gives some
but they
' re nto really satisfying
: htey jstu lead tothe omre questions
. thyat
' s what makes htis movei stay onthe your mind
. theese are teh sorts ofthe questions that occupy our timne
. even when we push them to tjhe background
,
however we resolve these questions influences everthing we do
. the performances are all superb in hurlyburly
. i haven
' t seen sean penn inspite much before
( in fact
, i can
' t remember seeing him inwhich anything
)
,
but he isnt briliant iin thsi
. eddie isn
' t a likeable character
,
but sean penn makes him underst
andable
. i don
' t whant to be his friend
but i
' d like tothe halp him
. chazz palminteri is also great as phil
, making him an awful person
. i
' d never want to konw phil bu still i underst
and why eddie wants tothe be his friend
. everyone in this film nails their performances
, mkaing this world rela
. it
' s a nasty world
; it
' s a sexist world
. unlike shakespeare in loev which is unfailingly politically correct
, hurlyburly isnt a man
' s world
, seen unapologetically through thte eyes of men
. i fidn thsi fascinating
and onthe two counts
, depressing
. first
, it
' s depressing thast such a world exists
. a larg part ofthe hurlyburly
' s succes isnt that it convinces me taht such peopel are rela
and that tihs sort of enviorment exists eveyr day inthe hollywood
; thta ther are a large number of men outloud ther who believe women tothe be completely poriferal tothe thier world
, toys
, playthings
. sure
, everyone is background tothe everyone esle bu in this world
, women are a long way inspite yhe backround
. second
, theese are the movies thast are being made
: storis baout men
' s world
. where are the tsories about women
' s world
? nto the soap operas anbd tjhe
" chick flicks
" that are meaned to satisfy womens
,
but yhe real stories that touch on tyhe esence ofthe life like hurlyburly does fo men
. hurlyburly isnt based on a stage play
and that isnt evident from thge moent tyhe film starts
. it
' s vrey talkative
, intelligent
and static
. hwile tihs cxan amking tjhe film drag a bited
, adn people sometimes sound liek they
' re quoting textbooks
, mostly thsi is a ogod thing
. nto all films haev tothe be filled with spacial effects adn sweeping panoramas
. nto all films have to underestimate the inelligence of theri audience
. all it means isnt thyat hurlyburly is probaly just as effective onthe video as it isnt on the larg screen
. it also means that you hvae tothe pay attension
.
