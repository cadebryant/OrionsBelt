i ' ve got to admit it
.
.
. i ' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved thge frist ace ventura
, as well as the mask
and dumb
annd dumber
-
-
adn even inaddition batman forever
( which was a preety awful movie
)
, carrey wass oen ofthe thge few people to come off looking reasonably good
. util i saw ace ventura 2
, i hadnt noone idea how people could fidn yhe guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows jsut how irritating
and annoying carrey can be
. carrey goes thru thte same schtick he whent thru in teh first ace movei
,
bu this time it is no longer funny
-
- it isnt just a rehash ofthe many of thte same jokes utilizied in ace i
. the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to sive a raccoon
( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he is called outloud ofthe retirement tothe fidn a bat which wass kidnapped
anbd
, if not returned inaddition four dyas
, wiull cause twpo warring african tribes tothe destory each otehr
. once agian
, it ' s up to ace to sive the day
, using his uncanny detective skills
. thsoe who have beeen dissapointed by carrey ' s moreso restrained roles infact thte films follwoing tghe frist ace ventura may be glad tothe see him over
- acting tothe hte best ofthe his ablity
,
bu smoe may be dissappointed by the fatc thgat this sequal doesn ' t capture the feel ofthe tjhe orignal
. the orginial benefited from what looked tothe be carrey ' s constatn hyped
- up improv sequences
, whlch were hysterically funny
. here
,
however
, tje tighter scirpt
( whlch is reminscent ofthe teh old disney telemovies
) takes the improvised material ffrom yhe frist
,
and shamelessly recycles it in the newyorker movei
, giving carrey littel chance to improvise
. instade
, his extremely funny manner hasnt beeen reduced to jsut walking arund stupidly
.
bu noe of yhe biggest problems i had was with the character ofthe ventura himself
. infact yhe firt movie
, he ws alwasy kool
,
anbd oen step ahead of every oney esle
-
- perfect for carrey ' s off
- thte
- wall approch
.
bu here
, ventura is made tothe look a lot stupider
,
adn is oftenly made outloud as the straight guy
-
- a role whlch isnt definitely not carrey ' s stlye
. ther are definately some very funny moments
,
bu they are few
and far beween
. tehy are aslo nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did inthe tghe first ace ventura
, or even dumb
anbd dumber
.
