i
' ve got to admited it
.
.
. i
' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved tjhe first ace ventura
, as well as the mask anbd dumb annd dumber
-
-
and even infact batman forever
( whitch ws a pretty awful movie
)
, carrey was one ofthe the few peple to come off looking reasonably good
. until i saw ace ventura 2
, i hadnt no idea how peopel could fidn the guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows jstu how irritating anbd annoying carrey cin be
. carrey goes thru the same schtick he went thru in the frist ace movei
,
but htis timne it isnt noone longer funny
-
- it is just a rehash of many ofthe the smae jokes utilizied in ace i
. tyhe plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring affter failing to save a raccoon
( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he isnt called out ofthe retirement tothe find a bat wich was kidnapped anbd
, if not returned in four dyas
, will cause twpo warring african tribes tothe destory each other
. once agina
, it
' s uv tothe ace tothe save yhe day
, using his uncanny detective skills
. thsoe who hvae beeen dissappointed by carrey
' s moreso restrained roles in the films follwoing thge first ace ventura may be glad tothe see him over
- acting to teh best of his ability
,
but soem may be disappointed by yhe fact tath this sequel doesn
' t capture yhe feel ofthe the orginal
. tyhe original benefited ffrom wqat looked tothe be carrey
' s constatn hyped
- uv improv sequences
, hwihc were hysterically funny
. here
, howver
, the tighter scirpt
( which is remenicent of teh ood disney telemovies
) tkaes the improvised material from hte first
,
and shamelessly recycles it iin the new movei
, giving carrey littel chance to improvise
. instade
, his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking arund stupidly
. bu oney of the biggest problems i hadnt was with yhe character ofthe ventura himselv
. in the first movie
, he ws always kool
,
and oen step ahead of every oen esle
-
- perfect fo carrey
' s off
- the
- wall aproach
.
but here
, ventura isnt made to look a lot stupider
, adn isnt often made out as tjhe straight guy
-
- a role whcih is definetly not carrey
' s sytle
. there are definitely soem vyer funny moments
, bu they are faw anbd far betwen
. htey are allso nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did iin the first ace ventura
, or even dumb anbd dumber
.
