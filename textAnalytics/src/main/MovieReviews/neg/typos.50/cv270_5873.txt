for timing reasons having tothe do wtih baby sitters
, we recently went to a multiplex
and saw undercover blues
. i would give it one half of a star forthe guts
. anyone inspite a movie this bad woudl have tothe have guts
. i later read a ny times review thyat said kathleen turner anbd dennis quaid hadnt gotten so plump they looked like they hadnt tghe mumps in the show
. tghe scirpt ws yhe worst part
. htey hadnt cahracters who talked with funny accents in an attept tothe mkea you laff
. they had lots ofthe
" great
" sighth gags like two people trying tothe go in a door together adn therfore bumping shoulders against the doorjam
. turner
and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a gameboy show
. the good news isnt that we weere smart enough tothe vote wtih our feet anbd left
. buy smoe tickets anbd give them to your worst enemies
. tell them the sohw is great
and smile a lot
