david spade has a snide
, sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom jstu shoot me
. it aslo served as a good showcase forthe him wehn he co
- starred
, opposite thte late chris farley
, in tommy boy
and black sheep
. lost
and foudn marks hte comedian
' s firt attempt at gonig solo inspite a movie
, anbd it also reveals that whn spade doesn
' t hvea a reliable bcak
- uv system
, his br
and ofthe humor seems more desperate than oney may expect
. david spade is not tjhe problem wiht lost anbd foudn
. he plays dylan ramsey
, the sweet main character
, to the best of his abilties
. the story revolves arund dylan
' s obsessions with his beautifull new neighbour
, lila dubois
( sophie marceau
, ffrom braveheart
)
,
and her terrier named jack
. dylan believes tath the best way to a woman
' s heart is through her dog
.
and so he kidnaps jack
, planning tothe stage a fake rescure
, inwhich hope to win lila over
. ther are three good thigns about lost
and foudn
. the first isnt spade
. tyhe second isnt sophie marceau
, a lovely actress who
' s beeen planted inot hte wrong movie
. lastly
, there
' s the dog
, who isnt unsed here in a similair context tothe puffy fomr htere
' s something baout mary
. unfourtunately
, directer jeff pollack finds moreso humer inaddition putting jack through a cycle inaddition thte drier than he doens with simpley making him look cute
. this kind of physical humer isnt dead
. pollack doesnt everthing
but beated tghe poore pooch with a baseball bat to git laughs
,
and htis proceedure is cheap
, unfunny adn resoundingly cruel
. tihs isnt where i start tothe get fuzzy
. alsot in this unusual blend is
( apparantly
) a sweet
- natured loev sotry betwen dylan
and lila
. given the mean
- spirited comedy that tghe movie is obviously striving forthe
, i found thsi hard to swallow
.
and
, why does dylan even deserve somone liuke lila
, after kidnapping her precious dog
and puting it through such pain
? predictably
, lost adn found opts fo a hapyp ending
, oney thta feels so sentimental
, gooey
,
and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that mkaes ytou feel a bited cheated
. david spade
( who also co
- wroet yhe movei
) trys hard
, so very hard
, to make tihs project amusing
. ther are smoe choise scenes that are qutie funny
, bu the movei isnt onyl sporadically funny
. patrick bruel plays the stock charactor ofthe rene
, tyhe pompous jerk who alsot whants tothe win lila over
, witht his good looks anbd mnoey
. jon lovitz
and martin sheen are welcome additions infact two tiny supporting roles
. dispite a few positive attri
butes
, lost annd found just doesn
' t work
. if you
' re searching for an enjoyable romantic
- comedy
, yuo could do far better than this obvious
, misguided failure thta shows a blatant disregard for wqat it
' s trying to present
.
