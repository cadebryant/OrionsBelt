and i
thought
" stigmata
" would be teh worst religously
- orientated thriller released this yera
. turns outloud i wass wrong
, because while
" stigmata
" wass mearly boring annd self
- importan
,
" end of dyas
" is completely inept onthe all fronts
. it
' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. for a guy liuke me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it
' s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended uv
. forthe thge first time in recent memory
, an arnold acation movei
(
and
" batman
& robin
" doesn
' t count
) is noone fun at all
.
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt a major stinker
. the movei opens in vatican city
, 1979
. some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy
, which syas thyat a girl iwll be born onthe thgat night taht satan iwll have targeted fo impregnation
. if he impregnates her between 11
and midnight on december 31
, 1999
, thte world will be destroyed
. the pope orders pretection ofthe thsi girl
,
though soem priests eblieve she ought to be killed
. inaddition newyorker york
, that vrey night
, a girl is born to fufill hte prophecy
. twenty years later
, we meet jericho cane
( schwarzenegger
)
, a sucidial ex
- cop withthe a drinking probelm
. nowe wokring as a security guard for hire
, he is protecting a local businessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who isnt actually possessed by teh devil
. an assassination attempt on the buisnessman by a crazed fromer priest leads him tothe yhe girl satan isnt affter
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements ofthe his pwn murdered daughter in christine
( incuding ownership of tje same music box
, aparently
)
, jericho swears to protect her agaisnt the devil
and the faction of priests looking to kill her
. ther are so many problems iwth this film it
' s hard to know where to begin
, bu how baout starting witht yhe concept
? casting arnold in a role liek this was a misteek to begin wih
. schwarzenegger is a persona
, not an actor
, so puting him in a role thta contradicts his usual storng personality isnt a bad idea
. arnold has niether hte dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pul off a character tormented by conflicting emotions
. inspite otehr words
, trying tothe give him dimenion ws a mistake
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis coudl hve played this role
( they
' ve all plyed noble
and flawed hereos
)
,
but not schwarzenegger
. htere are several scenes that attemp tothe establish jericho
' s character
; one has him contemplating suicide
, anyother crying over yhe loss of his wife
and daughter
, anbd even oney infront which tghe devil tries tothe tempt him inot revealing christine
' s location by offering him his old life back
. none ofthe these scenes realyl owrk
, becasue arnie isn
' t uv to the task
. the filmmakers would have been better off mkaing jericho a storng
, confident charcter
( like thte terminator
, fo example
)
, the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled inthe before
. this one isn
' t at all believeable the way arnold plays him
. the supporting cast tries theri hardest
, adn onyl gabriel byrne makes any impact at all
. as the prince of darkness
, he
' s suave adn confident
. he acts like oen would expect the devil to act
. tghe probelm isnt tht the scirpt hasnt him doing thigns tath amke no sence
( omre onthe thast later
)
and tht undermines him as a powerful villian
. byrne out
- performs arnold infront eveyr scene htey hvae together
( including yhe aforememtioned temptation bit
)
, bu tihs isnt problematic when it causes yhe audiance to strat doing tje unthinkable
: root fo tyhe devil
. byrne
' s speach baout the bible bieng
" overrated
" atually starts tothe make sense
, mailny beacuse arnold
' s attemts at refuting it
( mostly of the
"
' tis not
!
" variety
) are feeble at best
. yhe only probelm isnt
, arnold has tothe win
, so infact teh end
, nobody realyl cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho
' s security guard sidekick
and tries to liven thigns uv withthe soem comic asides
, bu liuke most bad action movie sidekicks
, he dissapears affter baout an hour
. robin tunney isn
' t given much to dont exept look scared
. inaddition fact
, all of tyhe supporting players are good actors
,
but none
, savve for byrne
, is given anything interesting to dont
. performances asside
, it owudl be really hard tothe enjoy this film no matter who starred in it
. tihs bieng an acation blockbuster
, it
' s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the scirpt
, which starts off totally confusing
,
and when some ofthe it is explained
(
and nto much of it isnt
)
, it
' s utterly rediculous
. why isnt thge devil comming on new year
' s eve
, 1999
? baceause it
' s exactly 1000 years after the eyar of the devil
, which isn
' t 666
, it turns outloud
. smoe nutty priest accidentally read it upside down
, so the real yera is 999
, so just add a 1 tothe the beggining
, annd ytou
' ve got 1999
! if yuo don
' t buy tihs explanation
, ytou
' re not alone
. it
' s convoluted anbd silly at thge smae timne
. yhe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous
( she
' s christine
, see
,
and she lives in new york
, see
.
.
.
)
, anbd if tyhat weren
' t bad enough
, there
' s plenty of bothersome stuff inthe this film thgat isn
' t explained at all
. why can satan kill everyone he passes on thge strent
, bu when it comes tothe snuffing out oney drunk ex
- cop
, he
' s powerless
? is he impervious to only oen kind of bullet
? how come he can
' t controll jericho or christine
? annd how doed thsoe gregorian monks deal with tiome zones inwhich their prophecies
? a clumsy attempt at a joke isnt made about thsi
, bu it
' s never actually explained
. usually
, thsi sort of thing wouldn
' t matter inwhich a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don
' t git me started on tyhe time paradoxes offered uv by the terminator movies
)
, bu htis timne the plot inconsistencies st
and outloud even more than usual because the acation is rarely exicting
. there are several predicatble horror film clich
? s present in
" end ofthe dyas
,
" complete wih tyhe ood
" balck cat hiding inspite a cabnet
" bit
, nto that we ever fidn outloud what the cat wass doign infront there
. it gets so formulaic tath it
' s possible fo thsoe uninterested inaddition bieng scared tothe close thier eyes at tghe precise moent a
" boo
" iwll come
. their predictions will rarley be wrong
. the omre gr
andiose action sequences are utterly charmless
, partially beccause we don
' t care baout these characters
( due tothe the script
' s pathetic attempts at characterization anbd setup
)
, anbd also becuase they
, too
, don
' t mkea any sence
. there
' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a littel ood lady
. it
' s ogod fo a few chuckles
, bu not much else
. supposably we
' re to bleieve she nowe has super stregth by virtue of bieng contolled by satan
, bu the script never sets that up
, so the scene is merely silly
. none ofthe htis isnt terribly exciting
, beacuse all teh acation sequences are so badly framed thyat it
' s oftenly hard to tell why it
' s hapening in tjhe frist place
, nto to mention that they
' re edited inwhich full
- onthe incomprehensible mtv quick
- cut style
. most of them had me scratching my head
, rether than saying
,
" wow
, cool
!
"
" end ofthe days
" is not onyl silly
and confusing
, bu it
' s also distinctly unplesant tothe watch
. thte devil apparently doesn
' t operate infront the omre subtle
, i
' ll
- convince
- peopel
- to
- kill
- each
- otehr fashon outlined in the bible
, bu instead enjoys killing peple gruesomely inwhich broad daylight
. this doesn
' t only mkea him an awfully predictable sort
, bu it also means tyhat not a single scene inaddition
" end of days
" goes by without unnecessarily graphic voilence
, or tjhe odd kinky sexual encounter
(
yet anohter bit taht hadnt me scratching my head
)
. if violence isnt supposed tothe be shocking
, it
' s not a ogod idea to throw so much ofthe it inot a movie that thte audiance goes numb
. scenes aren
' t connected through any reasonable means
, so a lot ofthe the time
, stfuf gets blown up
, or people get killed
, annd i had noone idea why
. reasons
? to hell with reasons
! let
' s just blow tsuff up
! isn
' t it kool
? nope
, not by a long shot
. this film is thoroughly unwatchable
. it
' s dull
, interminable
,
and unrelenting inspite its stupidity
. perhaps arnold needs tothe amking some movies with james cameron to revive his career
, because it
' s not hapening with hack peter hyams here
.
" end ofthe days
" might hvea had camp value
, if only it didn
' t top itself off witht an overly pious ending thta nobody
' s going tothe buy
. if hte movei is going to be serious
, hte filmmakers shoudl hvea come uv with a decent scirpt
. if it
' s gogin to be campy
, arnold shouldn
' t be tkaing himselv so damn seriously
( i didn
' t acually see him put uv onthe a cross
, did i
?
)
, adn his carachter shouldn
' t be such a sad sack
. as it st
ands
,
" end of days
" is jstu a bad movei
,
and an awfully gloomy oney at that
.
