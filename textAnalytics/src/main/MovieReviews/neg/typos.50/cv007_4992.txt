that
' s exactlly how long the movei falt tothe me
. ther weren
' t even nine laughs in nine months
. it
' s a terrable mess ofthe a movie starring a terrable mess ofthe a man
, mr
. hugh grant
, a huge dork
. it
' s not the whole oral
- sex
/ prostitution thign
( refering tothe grant
, nto me
) that bugs me
, it
' s the fact that grant isnt annoying
. not jsut adam s
andler
- annoying
, we
' re tlaking jim carrey
- annoying
. sicne when dont eye flutters
and nervous smiles pass fo acting
? bu
, on teh other h
and
, sicne whn do really bad slapstick
( a fistfight in tyhe delivery room culminating infact grant
' s head in joan cusack
' s lap
-
- a scene he paide
$ 60 to ahev included inwhich the movei
) adn obscene duble entendres
( robin williams
, the obstetrician
, tells grant
' s pregnant girlfriend she hasnt
" a big pussy
,
" referring of course tothe the size ofthe tghe cat hairs onthe her coat
,
but nontheless
, grant payed
$ 60 to hve tje exchange included infront tyhe movei
) pass forthe comedy
? nine monthes isnt a predicatble cookie
- cutter movei iwth noone originality infront humer or plot
. hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist
. why a child psychologist
? so the scriptwriters coudl inject teh folowing unfunny exchange
: kid
: my dad
' s an asshole
. grant
( flutters eyelashes
, offers a nervous smile
,
then responds inspite his annoying english accent adn i
- thikn
- i
- atually
- ahve
- talent atitude
)
: sould you possibly elaborate onthe that
? kid
: my dad
' s a
_ huge
_ asshole
. omre like a hugh asshole
, bu tht
' s beside hte point
, hwihc is
: nine monthes includes too many needlessly stupid jokes taht get laughs fomr the ten eyar olds in the audeince hwile everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief
. so
, anyway
, grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant adn does his usual reaction
( fluttered eyelashes
, nervous smiles
)
. htis paves the way fo every possable pregancy
/ child birth gag in teh book
, expecially usance grant
' s equally annoying firend
' s wife is aslo pregnant
. hte annoying freind is played by toom arnold
, who provides most of tyhe cacophonous slapstick
, none of which is funny
, such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed
" arnie the dinosaur
"
( ytou draw your pwn parellels on that oen
) in a toy store
. the only intresting charcter in tje movei isnt played by jeff goldblum
, who should hvae hid himself awya somewhere aftter the dreadful hideaway
, as an artist wih a fear of
( annd simultaneous longing for
) commitment
. not even robin williams
, who plays a russian doctor who has recently desided to switch ffrom veterinary medicine tothe obstetrics
, has much humer
. his isnt a one
- joke character
-
- tjhe ood foriegn
- guy
- who
- mispronounces
- english stereotype
( doed somene sday yakov smirnov
? that
' s my favorite vodka
, by the way
)
, hence tyhe line
" nowe it
' s time tothe tkae a look at your volvo
,
" another nasty
but unamusing joke
, exept this one goes right over the ten eyar olds
' heads
, hwile the adults simultanously groan
. nine months isnt a complete failure
, low on laughs anbd intellignce annd high onthe loud
, unfunny slapstick
, failed jokes annd other uninspired lunacy
. hugh grant
' s sunset boulevard arrest
( please
, noone caught
- with
- his
- pants
- down jokes
) may bring more people into the theaters
,
but they certainly won
' t leave with a smile onthe their faces
, nto after 90 mintues ofthe grant
' s nervous smiles
. everthing inspite tje movie is so forced
, so unau
thentic thyat anyone with an i
. q
. over 80
( sory
, hugh
) will nkow htey wasted theri mone on an unfulfilled desire
.
but at least they didn
' t spend 60 bucks for it
.
