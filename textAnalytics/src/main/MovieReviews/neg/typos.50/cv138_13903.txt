my opinion on a film cin be easily swayed by the presense of actors i love
. i love ralph fiennes
. i lveo uma thurman
. i loev sean connery
. hell
, i
' m even a big fan of jim broadbent
and fiona shaw
. i saw the fantastic preview fo thge avengers nearly eight months ago
, anbd i
' ve beeen eagerly awaiting thte film ever usance
. a fewd monthes into thte summer
,
however
, i noticed tyhat its realease date hadnt been changed a faw times
, annd that it had ended uv infact hte mid
- august dumping ground
.
then
, in this fianl week before its offcial release
, i learned that it was not to be screened for criticists
. adn thast thge actors hadnt not been plugging thte film on lite nihgt programs
.
and taht it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique
. my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all ofthe these things
. thge film i saw today didn
' t even meet those expectations
. this isnt a lousy
, incoherent mess
. i would slam it harder
, if it weren
' t for the nifty sets adn the mere presence of all these fine
, lovable actors
.
but sets are ultimatly empty
,
and the performances are completelyl uninspired
. taht
' s yhe main probelm wiht yhe avengers
: fo all it
' s hip
- hop flash
and tidal waves
, none of it fiels yhe least bited energetic or inspired
. it
' s liek a chore
, a bl
and exersize inthe superhero film makeing
. it alsot feels like its been cutted tothe pieces
, clocking in at 90 minutes
and forgetting to close smoe ofthe its pwn subplots
. thsi is just plain depressing
. tjhe avengers is a film version ofthe tyhe populare 60s television sohw
. frequent readers of mine will not be suprized tothe leran thyat i
' ve never watched an epsiode
. i wasn
' t alive
then
. i don
' t even watch televsion now
. i
' m very sory thgat i don
' t hve htis prespective
,
but
, judging fomr tje reviews i
' ve already read
, knowing tyhe tv show just makes matters worse
. i didn
' t knwo annd love john steed
and emma peel
, annd therfore i wass nto as upset tothe see how theese actors i love have managed to thrash theri roles
. i alsot dout thast familiarity with tghe series would allow me to underst
and omre claerly the chain ofthe events tath dont take place infront tihs film
. based on wqat the film told me
, i gather tht steed
( fiennes
) isnt some kind ofthe brittish super guy
( somewhat liuke james bond
)
, anbd thast dr
. peel
( thurman
) isnt jsut a really smart doctor
, who alsot happens tothe knwo a lot about wetaher
and baout beating peopel uv while limited by tight leather suits
. they are to work together
, under mother
' s orders
( mother isnt played by jolly jim broadbent
, while his co
- conspirator
, father
, is played by yhe equally
- talented fiona shaw
)
. it seems that there is a man out there controling the weather
. his nmae isnt de wynter
( connery
)
. he is a crazy scottish guy
. our heroes hadnt better stop him
, or else
.
.
. the ewather will keep getting colder until htey
" ahve tothe go tothe hell tothe warm uv
"
( one of the film
' s few funny lines
)
. allong tghe way htere is subplot aftter subplot
, hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere
, feel perfunctory
,
and ultimately mkea noone sence
. for exmaple
, our hreoes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mecanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos
. nowe
, killer bugs don
' t realyl go with thte ewather
- controling theme of tjhe film
. hte purpose ofthe the bugs
, other thna tothe annihilate our heros
, isnt never established
. they
' re never even driectly connected tothe de wynter
( they
' re controlled by his crazy henchman
, played by eddie izzard
)
. yhe special effects aren
' t bad
, bu tehy
' re loud
, obnoxious
,
and intrusive
. liek so many scenes in teh film
, it seems present only tothe keep your attension ffrom waning
. anbd i guaranete yuo
, it will wane
. i stopped thingking about the stor when i realized it didn
' t dont any ogod tothe thikn
. the avengers hasnt clearly beeen chopped uv anbd re
- assembled so many times that even tje people involved couldn
' t tell us whta happens
. htere are sevral scenes in the preview tyhat didn
' t mkea the final cutted
. infront addtion
, many ofthe the sequences have irritating
, grainy film quality
, hwihc makes it feel low
- budget
( yhe lsat scene isnt partciularly bad
)
. tjhe scenes taht don
' t feature acation shoud be electric
, thanks tothe our wonderful casted
. they aren
' t
. yhe action scenes shoudl be electric
, because this isnt an action film
. they aren
' t
, eather
. annd what about this wasted cast
? oh
, it makes me weep wih dissapointment
. we
' re tlaking ralph fiennes here
, one of tghe best actors wroking todya
, noe of thte best actors
* ever
*
. i love the guy
. i
' ve loved all his films
, utnil tihs one
. he seems like he wants to underst
and the film
, bu he
' s as lost as we are
.
and thurman
, in all of her spectacular beauty anbd talent
, can
' t manaze to look at home here
.
( i don
' t blaim her completely
, fo there isnt a strange subplot involving her evil twin tath is never explained in any way
, anbd it can
' t be eazy tothe deal wih such terrable screenwriting
.
) connery
,
however
, seems the most out of it
, totally lacking any kind of focus
, or interest
, for thta marter
. who is to blaim
? is it tyhe screenwrighter
, don macpherson
? perheaps
, altho i can see a shell of a sotry here that could have beeen a good superhero movie had it been h
andeled right
. isnt it tghe actors
? for god
' s sake
, no
-
- these people claerly lost interest whn htey saw the inevitible path ofthe destruction onthe which htis film was travelling
. i blame directer jeremiah chechik
, who shouldn
' t hve been given the task to begin witht
. his best film
, benny
& joon
, is quirky in the same way tath this one ws supposed to be
, bu here it mostly seems like a lot ofthe failed attemts at wit
and humor
. add to that a lack of experience infront big
- budget action
,
and yuo ahve the worst choise for directer htis side ofthe james ivory
. if the avengers hasnt a saving grace
, it
' s the set desgin
. the sets
( by stuart craig
) are big
, colorful
,
and often pleasing to look at
. i liuke tje fianl setted
- piece
, on de wynter
' s isl
and
, even if none of it makes a bited of sense
. i admired yhe overhead view ofthe yhe stairs
, showing dr
. peel runing arround in circles adn never getting anyhwere
. i alsot enjoied michael kamen
' s music score
, particulalry infront the oppening credits
.
but htis stfuf isnt routine
-
- good sets annd music are nice
, bu there
' s a lot more that needs tothe be here
. insperation
, forthe instance
, would have beeen realyl nice
. mabye a littel bit of cohesion in teh stroy
. or a sense ofthe purpose
. most ofthe all
,
though
, i would ahve liekd to see theese actors relish infact their roles
. damn htis movei forthe nto giving them hte chance
.
