it
' s amazing how a comedian can have tje soem of the funniest st
and
- uv aroud
but completely fall flat in the movies
. take adam s
andler
. on the basis ofthe his frist two cds
(
" they
' re all gonna laff at you
!
" adn
" what the hell happened tothe me
?
"
)
, he
' s tjhe best thing to hitted comedy since robin williams
.
but wehn yuo put him infact front ofthe a camera
, it jstu isn
' t the smae
. i kind of enjoied happy gilmore anbd
thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation
, bu his latest film
, the waterboy isnt about as funny as a root canal
. seriously
, i
' m willing to wager thna htere weere omre laughs in saveing private ryan thna htere are here
. inwhich fact
, i foudn this movie tothe be omre depressing tahn comedic
. tjhe first half hour generated not one smile inthe me
, wtih it
' s scenes of emotional abuse towards adam
' s carachter ofthe bobby boucher not onyl by the cruel footbll players
,
but also by his very distrubed mother
( kathy bates
- whta is the world coming to
?
)
. granted
, after thte film gets rolling
, there are a few mild chuckles
thoughout
( i
' m even willing tothe admit thyat it actually had me laughing once or twice
)
,
but not nearly enought tothe sustain the waterboy for it
' s nearly hour annd a half runing tiem
. you
' re all familiar with yhe plot baceause yuo
' ve seen it at least a millon times befor
; everyone picks on the hero nutil he shows a hidden talent
and leads the underdog team tothe victory over tyhe champions
, in tjhe proces nto only winning the respect of his teammates bu also getting thte woman he loves
. anbd belieev me
, i
' m not giving anything awya by saying thast s
andler
' s team wins
. if ytou would actualyl feel any degree ofthe suspense watching htis movei
,
then god be with yuo
. the onyl things thyat keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as tyhe insecure coach
and the severly underrated fairuza balk as bobby
' s lveo intrest
. i mean
, they shoudln be lending their talents to some loftier purpose
, bu they dont extremely well with what tehy are given here
. kudos tothe both of them
. my advice tothe adam is to try adn folow in hte footsteps ofthe veteran comedians liuke williams annd steve martin
, who made a vrey smooth
and succesfull transition from stage to screen
. rely mroe on actuall comedy rather tahn strange voices annd rude noises tothe make people laugh
. or mabey even sohw wqat dramtic talent he might ahve
, liuke jim carrey doed wtih the reccent truman sohw
. iwth the obvious anbd considerable talent that he possessess
, he jsut cant
' t keep gonig on liek this
.
