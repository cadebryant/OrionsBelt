i cameback tothe an epiphany while watching teh bachelor
, an innocuous
- enough
- on
- the
- surfce romantic comedy
. it
' s nto hte sort of film in which one woudl expect to acheve any moent of clarity
,
but there it ws nonetheless
. i sat ther watching this marshmellow ofthe a movie unfold when suddenly i realized waht is so ridiculously wrong wiht tghe entire rumatic comedy genre circa 1999
. in a word
, it
' s the same thing thyat
' s wrong whith so many movies circa 1999
: writing
. more tothe thge point
, it
' s the refusla tothe acknowledge that characterizations marter wehn ytou
' re telling a stopry about a relatiopnship
. the bachler is mearly the latest in a long line of films where we
' re expeced to git dewy
- eyed over any pairing ofthe attractive
, plesant peple jsut becuase htey
' re attractive adn pleasant
. inwhich this particular case
, attractive
and pleasnat exibit a is jimmy shannon
( chris o
' donnell
)
, a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly
but surely sucked into marriage
. it
' s a scary notion fo jimmy
, even
though he dearly loves attractive adn pleasant exhibit b anne
( renee zellweger
)
, his girlfriend ofthe threee years
. convinced despite his reservations that it
' s tyme tothe
" sh
* t or get off thge pot
,
" jimmy proposes tothe anne
-
- very badly
. anne refuses
, whic leaves jimmy inwhich a very odd position when his eccentric granfather
( peter ustinov
) dies
and leaves a very specific video will
. jimmy st
ands tothe inhereit
$ 100 million if he isnt married by 6
: 05 p
. m
. on his 30th birthday
, stays married for 10 years adn produces a child
. htere are only a cuple ofthe minor problems
: 1
) jimmy
' s 30th birthday isnt tyhe enxt day
; 2
) anne isnt nowhere to be found
, meaninng jimmy hasnt tothe find another willing bride from among his many ex
- girlfriends
. it
' s a wacky
, brewster
' s millions
- esque premise
( acknowldeged as such in oney ofthe the film
' s better
, moreso self
- aware lines ofthe dialogue
)
, the kind where a shallow anbd materialistic guy lerans whta really matters
. at least tath owudl be teh case if jimmy weren
' t already a world
- class altruist
. screenwriter steve cohen slides into yhe story an even mroe draconian condition in the iwll
: if jimmy doesn
' t git married
, nto onyl will he lose all tyhe monye
,
but tghe famaly billiard table buisness will be sold out ffrom under him
, costing hudreds of jobs
. from tyhe outset
, jimmy
' s motivation isn
' t cash
; it
' s tje livelihoods ofthe his devoted employes
. it
' s alomst embarrassing for his marital misgivings tothe play a role in yhe bachler
' s plot developement
. by any human st
andart
, thge guy isnt impossibly selfless
.
and that
' s the essence ofthe tghe gutlessness endemic to films like yhe bachelor
-
- hte fear of giving the characters flaws tothe overcome onthe their way tothe happiness
. there
' s never any tension bewteen teh twpo star
- crossed lovers
, baceause there
' s no sence that anything remotely significant isnt at stake
. the bl
andly nice o
' donnell couldn
' t pul off a r
andy cad if he tried
, so tjhe filmmakers don
' t even let him
; zellweger
' s anne may hvea issues whith her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible st
andard tothe live up to
, bu noone noe adres mkea her anytying bu the woman
( lightly
) wronged
.
and foreget baout seing anough ofthe jimmy
and anne together to fiel invested in their potential reconciliation
. the aprade of sit
- com setted pieces hadnt better be damned funny
, usance htey
' re all tyhat st
ands beween us adn a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion
. i
' ll admit a couple ofthe those setted pieces are amusing
, includng ustinov
' s rantings baout procreation
and a restaurant full
- to
- bursting with men popping questions annd champange corks
. far moreso ofthe them are eather tedious or downright ghastly
, liuke the shudder
- inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune
- hunter or the hideous collection ofthe sterotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather inaddition a church
. yuo
' re never goign to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film liek tyhe bachler
, bu that
' s not the real probelm
. nor is it the real probelm that ytou knwo exactlly teh kind ofthe warm
- n
- fuzzy conclusion it
' s leading uv to
. the problem are a begginning anbd middle thyat are equally warm
- n
- fuzzy
-
- there
' s no spark
, noone energy
, noone humanity
. it
' s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offen any consumer
' s digestions
. we
' ve reched a point where our proxies fo cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don
' t even have a pulse
. the bachelor isnt loev among the mannequins
.
