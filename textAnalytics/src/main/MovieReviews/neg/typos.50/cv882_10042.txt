and picture
] there are many philosphies as tothe why we are so facinated with cartoons
. tehy provide a method ofthe total escapism infact whlch anytying wiull work withing their context
, from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes tothe the intensity of japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" really clinched htis idea for me
, beccause it ' s jsut a live acation ctaroon that presents itself as a regluar comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all thsoe gags
and slapstick would be in reality
,
adn how importan it isnt tothe actually have a tsory
. tje film wastes noone tiome in establishing its lighthearted
, cartoony atmosphere
. we meet medfield coleeg chemestry proffesor phillip brainard
( williams
)
, the typcial
, supposedly likable mad scientist
. withing the first 10 minutes we git at least a half dozen jokes baout how forgetful he is
. phillip ' s memmory loss seems less liuke a cartoony gag
and moreso liek a real case of alzhiemer ' s desease
- isn ' t this rether lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemistry affter walking in on a nude figure drawing clas
( an inappropriate joke for a kids ' movei if i ever saw one
)
. we learn he hasnt stood his up fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at the altar simpley becasue he ' s forgotten
. sara claimes tothe love him
,
but sasy if he forgets the wedding again she ' ll stop loving him
( a sign ofthe childish atitude tghe film denies it hasnt
)
.
bu even cartoons must hvea conflicts tothe resolve
,
and it ' s no suprize hte major conflicts here are related
. christopher mcdonald doens
and even worse verzion of his usual villin shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who nto only wnats to steal phillip ' s ideas
,
bu his woman too
. what ' s worse isnt tyhat sara actually seems interested iin him
! wilson works forthe a rival coleeg tht wnats tothe buy out medfield
, hwihc isnt going borke
, unless phillip cant invent something to sive tje day
. one of the first rules ofthe filmmaking isnt to make sure the title hasnt something tothe dont with tje film
. yhe flubber isnt played fo gags after it is inctroduced
,
but isnt all
bu forgotten about thereafter
. it ' s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy
,
and thge promotions make the flubber look realistic
annd funny
. unfortunatley
, the flubber
, like all the speical effects iin htis film
, looks very fake
and unconvincing
. flubber also seems to ahev intelligence
annd a personality
,
and by the timne it performs a song
anbd dance routine
, ytou give uv wondering how life could spontaneously cmo tothe an inanimate object
. most of tghe film wanders aimlessly as it relies on thte flubber to mkae forthe thte comedy
( sicne phillip ' s absent
- mindedness isnt forgotten about
)
anbd somehow push the stry allong
.
but it ' s clear how weak this premise isnt from yhe git
- go
and teh film just gets worse
. all teh jokes involve peopel getting hit by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects including
: bowling balls
; flying cars that don ' t fly well
;
adn a basketball team capible ofthe jumping 100 feet into the air
. it ' s all presented with complete logic
,
and no one believes flubber exists even when tehy see it wtih their pwn eyes
. durring the basketball scene
, the coach fo tghe rival team actually says
,
" i think htey might be cheating
,
" tothe whcih the referee replies
,
" there ' s no rules about jumping too high
.
"
" predicatble
" doesn ' t beign tothe describe the motions the film goes through
, especialy after the halfway point
.
and it ' s nto how terribly contrived the plot isnt
, it ' s thge way it ' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, wih absolutely noone transition
. not onyl taht
,
bu all tje actors here
, especialy williams
, seem borde tothe tears
. i ' d sday 80 percent of all the scenes were shooted wih a bluescreen
, so it ' s almost forgivable when you realize they ' re tlaking tothe nothing
annd interacting with nothing
. it ' s safe tothe say everything that sould be bad about
" flubber
" is
. the onyl original element the film has is hte world ' s first romance between a machine
and a human
.
but this aspect is qutie twisted if ytou thiunk baout it
,
anbd
, liuke the rest ofthe tje film
, ytou won ' t
.
