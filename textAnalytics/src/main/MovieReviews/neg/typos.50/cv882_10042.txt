,
and picture
] there are many philosphies as tothe why we are so facinated with cartoons
. htey provide a method ofthe total escapism in whlch anytying iwll wrok within theri context
, from the outrageous slapstick ofthe looney tunes to the intensity ofthe japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" relaly clinched this idea for me
, becasue it
' s jsut a live acation ctaroon thyat presents itself as a regluar comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all thsoe gags
and slapstick would be infact reality
,
and how imporatnt it is tothe actually haev a story
. the film wastes no time in establising its lighthearted
, cartoony atmosphere
. we meet medfield coleeg chemestry professor phillip brainard
( williams
)
, thge tipical
, supposedly likable mad scientist
. withing tje frist 10 minutes we git at least a half dozen jokes baout how forgetful he isnt
. phillip
' s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag annd moreso liuke a real case ofthe alzhiemer
' s disease
- isn
' t tihs rether lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemistry affter walking in onthe a nude figure drawing class
( an inappropriate joke for a kids
' movei if i ever saw oney
)
. we leran he hasnt st
anded his up fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at tghe altar simpley baceause he
' s forgotten
. sara claims tothe lveo him
, bu says if he forgets tjhe wedding agina she
' ll stpo loving him
( a sign of childish atitude hte film denies it has
)
.
but even cartoons must hve conflicts tothe resolve
, annd it
' s no surprize tje major conflicts here are realted
. christopher mcdonald doesnt
and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who nto onyl wants to steal phillip
' s ideas
, bu his woman too
. what
' s worse isnt tyhat sara actually seems interested in him
! wilson works forthe a rival college that wnats tothe buy outloud medfield
, which isnt going baroke
, unless phillip cxan invent something to savve the day
. oen ofthe hte first rules ofthe filmmaking isnt to make sure tje title has something to dont witht tjhe film
. thte flubber isnt played for gags aftter it is intruduced
, bu isnt all bu forgotten about therafter
. it
' s obvious phillip is oging tothe accidentlaly invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy
, annd the promotions mkea teh flubber look realistic adn funny
. unfortunatly
, the flubber
, like all the special effects in this film
, looks vyer fake
and unconvincing
. flubber also seems to have intelilgence anbd a perosnality
, annd by the tyme it performs a song
and dance routine
, yuo give up wondering how life could spontaneously come tothe an inanimate object
. most of tjhe film w
anders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to mkae fo tghe comedy
( sicne phillip
' s absent
- mindedness isnt forgotten baout
)
and somehow push the storey along
.
but it
' s clear how weak this premise is from tjhe git
- go annd hte film just gets worse
. all thge jokes involve peple getting hit by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects includng
: bowling balls
; flying cars tath don
' t fli well
; annd a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air
. it
' s all presented wiht complete logic
,
and no one believes flubber exists even whn tehy see it witht thier pwn eyes
. during the basketball scene
, the coach for hte rival team accually syas
,
" i think they might be cheating
,
" to whic tghe referee replies
,
" ther
' s no rules baout jumping too high
.
"
" predictable
" doesn
' t beign to decribe the motions the film goes through
, especialy after thte halfway point
.
and it
' s not how terribly contrived the plot is
, it
' s the way it
' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, withthe absolutly noone transition
. nto only that
,
but all the actors here
, especialy williams
, seem borde tothe tears
. i
' d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot iwth a bluescreen
, so it
' s alomst forgivable whn yuo realize htey
' re tlaking to nothing
and interacting wtih nothing
. it
' s safe to sday everthing taht coudl be bad baout
" flubber
" isnt
. hte only original element the film hasnt isnt the world
' s first romance between a machine
and a human
. bu tihs aspect is quite twisted if ytou tihkn baout it
, adn
, liuke tje rest of tyhe film
, ytou won
' t
