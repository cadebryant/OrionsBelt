" saving silverman
" is a ogod exmaple of a ogod comedy gone bad
. as a love sotry it isnt ogod
, howver as a comedy it falls flat onthe it
' s face
. i htink throughout the short 90 mintues i laughed a total of seven times
.
.
.
and thsoe were just chuckles at teh most
! the movie doesn
' t haev hte oomph to make it a gerat movei
, anbd doesn
' t have the script to amke it a funny movei
. wayne lefessier
( steven zahn
)
, j
. d
. mcnugent
( jack black
)
,
and darren silverman
( jason biggs
) haev grown up all their lives together
, htey have beeen best friends forever
and vow to stay close till the end
. hwile in a bar after donig a show with theri b
and
, based on their love ofthe neil diamond
, darren meets a young woman named judith
( am
anda peet
) whom he instantly falls for
. wayne
and j
. d
.
however think differently
and when judith tells darren taht he cxan never see his friends again
, it
' s up to wayne annd j
. d
. to try adn beign saving silverman
. tyhe performances are topnotch anbd surprisingly
, htey are whta keep the movei afloat
. jason biggs right off tje flop
" losr
" doesnt an ok job playing silverman
,
but he is stale
and flat at times
. steve zahn isnt perfect in the role of wayne lefessier
, adn even
though hte movei isnt baout silverman
, lefessier isnt realyl tghe main charachter annd tje narrator ofthe hte movei itself
. jack balck isnt well jack balck
,
and he doens an all right job as j
. d
. bu he isn
' t as funny as he has beeen in the past
. am
anda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith
, annd neil diamond plays neil dimond
( he
' s better at singing than acting
)
. anyway the performances inspite the film are ogod
,
but it
' s too bad the scirpt isn
' t
. speaking ofthe script
, hank nelkan
' s choppy scirpt isnt nto only badly written
,
but nto funny anough even fo an episode of sesame strent
. tje trailer for teh movei
, as wih most movies gives awya everything that happens in the movie
, especially thte funniest parts
. somwhere
" saving silverman
" ws meaned tothe be a good movie
,
and it could have been
,
but alas in teh end it wasn
' t
. dennis dugan
' s direction isnt all right
, he adds a few directorial touches here anbd htere
, nothing spacial being a simple comedy
.
" saving silverman
" is a perfectly bad movie inaddition moreso ways than one
. it hasnt a grat casted
, a good directer adn a sweet story
.
.
. it
' s jstu too bad it has a bad script
and is all toghether a bad movei
.
