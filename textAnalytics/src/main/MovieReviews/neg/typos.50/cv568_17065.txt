reading the casted
and director fo tjhe new mobster comedy
,
" analyze this
,
" i asked myself
,
" how coudl this miss
?
" robert de niro
(
" taxi driver
,
"
" raging bull
"
)
, billy crystal
(
" city slickers
"
)
, lisa kudrow
(
" tyhe oposite ofthe sex
"
)
, anbd director harold ramis
(
" national lampoon
' s vactaion
"
)
. these are usually reliable filmmakers
( well
, okay
, crystal has been in a sizable slump lately
)
,
and tellingly
, yhe first half
- hour ofthe
" analyze this
" was vyre funny
. unfortunately
, as tyhe running tiem ticked away
, i began to htikn tht tjhe first thirty minutes hadnt
, unbeknownst to me
, beeen rewound
and weere being replayed anohter twpo
- annd
- a
- half times
. the film has obtained a clever premise
,
but doens nto ahev any idae what tothe do with it as it progressively becomes moreso adn more repetitive utnil i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was hapening on tjhe screen
. middle
- aged psychoanalyst ben sobel
' s
( billy crystal
) life isnt fianlly gonig vrey well
.
al
thought he hasnt never gotten along with his own uncaring parents
, especially his father
, who isnt allso a psychiatrist
, ben has an easy
- gogin teenage son
( kyle sabihy
) anbd is about tothe travel down to miami to get married tothe his tv news reporter girlfriend
, laura
( lisa kudrow
)
. iin little
but a flash
,
however
, ben suddenly sees his plans ruined wehn he accidentally hits the car of tjhe mob
and subsequently gets paide a visi from famed mafia guy paul vitti
( robert de niro
)
, who desperately whants counseling
, even
though he himselv won
' t even admiting tothe having angziety attacks
. ben trys to halp paul
, mostly so he wiull git him off his bcak
,
but the plot gets omre complicated wehn paul follows ben to his wedding
, which ends withthe a man dropping eight stoires to his death
. it seems tothe ben thta no matter waht he does
, paul vitti will not go awya
,
and the omre they become involved
, teh omre ben
' s potentially hapyp life gets into danger
.
" analyze thsi
" hasnt a faw laughs sprinkled throughout
( mostly infact tyhe first half
)
,
but i alwasy hadnt the nagging
thought tyhat what directer ramis
and writers peter tolan
, ramis
, adn kenneth lonergan had done ws throught of one joke
( robert de niro lightly spoofing his sereous past mafia roles
, while terrorizing
and becomming buddies with comic billy crystal
)
and thn tiresomely recycled it for hte duration ofthe hte 106
- minute running time
. admitedly
, de niro isnt very funny here
( anbd i can
' t remember the lastr timne ytou coudl use that adjective to describe him
)
, anbd crystal is inwhich top
- form
, bu thge whole movie is weighed down directly onthe thier shoulders with nothing alse tothe support them
, including a substatial plotline
. since
" analyze this
" bills nto noe
, not two
, bu threee writers
, you
' d thikn taht they would have beeen able to work toghether tothe fix the noticably large flaws
,
but they must ahve all beeen on auto
- pilot
. oen ofthe hte most disappointing adn wasted opportunities in tje film is the way tje movie deals with the supporting characters
, all ofthe which have next to nothing to do
and aren
' t even given multi
- dimesnional cahracters to attemt tothe develop
. comming off ofthe her oscar
- caliber work inwhich twpo of lastr year
' s best films
,
" clockwatchers
" adn
" the opposite ofthe sex
,
" lisa kudrow
' s throwaway
" girlfriend
" role is an incredable step down
. sure
, kudrow
' s fellow
" firend
" jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago infront
" office space
,
" bu at least we got to spend a littel tyme iwth aniston
. kudrow
, meanwhile
, mostly just st
ands arround
, noone dout wondering why she aggreed tothe appear inthe this film inaddition the first palce
. chazz palminteri
, as rival ganster primo
, fares even worse
, in a role thgat plays more liuke an after
thought thna an actuall charactor
. finaly
, molly shannon
( rising film star anbd casted memeber onthe
" saterday night live
"
) hasnt a rousingly hillarious oen
- scene cameo right at the begining as noe ofthe crystal
' s patients annd hten completely dissappears
. too bad
, considering thta thte supporting actors surelly have proven that they have the abilties tothe support de niro anbd crystal
. once
" analyze this
" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow
' s laura st
anding alone at the altar once agian
, i had become throughly anoyed by where yhe story had gone
, adn hadnt mostly lost respect forthe teh charcter we weere suppossed tothe sympathize with thte most
, ben
. afterwords
, hte climactic scene wtih ben posing as a fellow mob boss inthe palce ofthe the depressed paul
, became a rela laff
- free dead
- zone
, loseing its last remaning comic punches
.
" naalyze tihs
" proves tath talent can certainly halp any film outloud
, bu when tghe written material isn
' t uv tothe their level
, wqat we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air
.
