reading the casted
and directer for tje new mobster comedy
,
" analize htis
,
" i asked myself
,
" how coudl htis miss
?
" robert de niro
(
" taxi driver
,
"
" raging bull
"
)
, billy crystal
(
" city slickers
"
)
, lisa kudrow
(
" the oposite of sex
"
)
,
annd director harold ramis
(
" national lampoon ' s vacation
"
)
. these are ususally reliable filmmakers
( well
, okay
, crystal hasnt been inwhich a sizable slump latley
)
,
and tellingly
, tghe first half
- hour ofthe
" anaylze tihs
" was vrey funny
. unfortunately
, as the runnung time ticked away
, i began to tihkn thyat tghe frist thirty minutes had
, unbeknownst tothe me
, beeen rewound
anbd were bieng replayed anohter two
-
and
- a
- half times
. the film hasnt obtained a clever premise
,
but doesnt not have any idea wqat to dont with it as it progressively becomes omre
annd mroe repetitive nutil i finally stoped enjoying or carring about what was happening onthe the screen
. middle
- aged psychoanalyst ben sobel ' s
( billy crystal
) life is finaly gogin very well
.
altough he hasnt never gotten allong witht his pwn uncaring parents
, expecially his father
, who isnt aslo a psychiatrist
, ben hasnt an easy
- goign teenage son
( kyle sabihy
)
annd is about tothe travel down to miami to get marryed to his tv news reporter girlfriend
, laura
( lisa kudrow
)
. in little
bu a flash
,
however
, ben suddenly sees his plans ruined whn he accidenally hits thte car of the mob
and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed masia guy paul vitti
( robert de niro
)
, who desperately wants counseling
, even
though he himselv won ' t even admit to haveing nxiety attacks
. ben tries tothe help paul
, mostly so he will git him off his back
,
bu the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding
, which ends with a man dropping eight storie to his death
. it seems tothe ben that no marter whta he does
, paul vitti wiull nto go away
,
adn tghe more tehy become involved
, the more ben ' s potentially happy life gets inot danger
.
" analyze this
" hasnt a few laughs sprinkled throughout
( mostly infront yhe frist half
)
,
but i always had tjhe nagging throught thta what directer ramis
and writers peter tolan
, ramis
,
adn kenneth lonergan hadnt done wass thought of oney joke
( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles
, while terrorizing
annd becomming buddies wiht comic billy crystal
)
anbd
then tiresomely recycled it fo the duration ofthe the 106
- minute running time
. admitedly
, de niro is very funny here
(
annd i cxan ' t remember the lsat time ytou could ule thgat adjective tothe decribe him
)
,
and crystal is in top
- form
,
but tjhe hwole movei isnt weighed down directly onthe theri shoulders iwth nothing eles to support them
, inlcuding a substantial plotline
. sicne
" naalyze htis
" bills not one
, not twpo
,
but three writers
, yuo ' d think that they owudl have beeen able tothe owrk toghether to fix teh noticably larg flaws
,
bu htey must have all beeen onthe auto
- pilot
. oen ofthe tje most disapointing
and wasted opportunities in tyhe film isnt the way the movei deals wiht thge supporting charachters
, all ofthe which have next to nothing tothe dont
and aren ' t even given multi
- dimentional charachters tothe attept tothe develop
. comming off ofthe her oscar
- calibur wrok inthe two of last year ' s best films
,
" clockwatchers
"
and
" tjhe oposite ofthe sex
,
" lisa kudrow ' s throwaway
" girlfriend
" role isnt an incredable step down
. sure
, kudrow ' s fellow
" friend
" jennifer aniston doed the same thign twpo weeks ago infact
" office space
,
"
bu at least we got to spend a littel time with aniston
. kudrow
, meanwhile
, mostly just stands around
, no dout wondering why she aggreed to apearing inwhich this film in the first palce
. chazz palminteri
, as rival ganster primo
, fares even worse
, in a role tath plays more like an afterthought tahn an actuall charachter
. finally
, molly shannon
( rising film star
anbd casted member onthe
" saterday inght live
"
) hasnt a rousingly hillarious one
- scene cameo right at tje beginning as one of crystal ' s patients
adn
then completly dissapears
. too bad
, considering taht tyhe supporting actors surely hve proven tyhat they have tyhe abilities tothe support de niro
annd crystal
. once
" analye htis
" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow ' s laura standing alone at tje altar once agian
, i had become throughly anoyed by where the stopry hadnt gone
,
and had mostly lost respect for the character we were suppoed to sympathize with teh most
, ben
. afterwords
, thte climactic scene wiht ben posing as a fellow mob boss inwhich palce ofthe hte depressed paul
, bacame a real laugh
- free dead
- zone
, losing its last remainging comic punches
.
" analyze thsi
" proves tyhat talent can certainly help any film out
,
but whn the written material isn ' t uv tothe thier levle
, what we are virutally left with is a vacume of thin air
.
