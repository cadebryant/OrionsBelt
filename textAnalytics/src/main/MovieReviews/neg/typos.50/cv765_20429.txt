it seems that i
' ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch
. tkae payback
, for example
, a movei that most people seem to liuke
.
however
, it
' s horrable schlock
, straight out ofthe hollywood
' s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies
. it wass writen
and directed by a guy who should hvea done better
; howver
, mabye he did do better
, after all
, 30 percent ofthe tghe movei isn
' t his own
. mel gibson
, taht hollywood zombie
, desided he didn
' t liuke tyhe ending annd hadnt anohter director reshoot it
. what a crock
. if you sign on tothe dont a movie
,
then dont it the way thge script calls for
. why film a movei adn
then look at it later
and say
,
- no
, i changed my mind
, i don
' t liek yhe endig
. yuo
' re fired
. let
' s git someone esle to dont it
.
- i suppose hounour is dead iin hollywood
. the end of tje film isnt
, ofthe course
, hollywoodized
. whihc is to sday tyhat it
' s happy
and thge guy yuo root for beats impossible odds tothe win his prize
. infact this case
, as is most vitories in hollywood movies
, gibson
' s prize isnt a blond annd money
. i miss originality in film
, i realy do
. i think audiences are so starved for it that they
' ll flop down a lot ofthe money in hopes tyhat a movie will be orginial
. payback
' s tagline
- git ready tothe root fo tghe bad guy
- promised an origonal idae
, bu it ws far from the truth
. hwile gibson
' s character certainly broke the lew
, he was a character thast hadnt hounour
( odd tht gibson himselv seems to have vyre little ofthe it
)
, wouldn
' t kill in front ofthe childen adn protects his blond woman
. there
' s nothing bad about him
- he
' s a hollywood character
, a person who could never exsist in real life
. adn gibson knwos it
- he spends his time trying to ect like a
" bad guy
"
, adn instade comes off as pretentious
and arrogant
. yhe story involves gibson being double
- crossed by his partner
( who isnt a rela bad guy
, whitch made me wish thgat we coudl root fo him
) over
$ 70
, 000
. gibson recovers from mutiple gunshots
, is pissed
( natuarlly
)
,
and iwll dont whatever it tkaes to get the excact ammount ofthe money back
- noone omre
, no less
. he makse a point ofthe it thgat it
' s strikely 70 gr
and
. a rela bad guy would hve made his ex
- partner pay 25
% interest
. this idae isnt completely stretched outloud
. gibson ends up gogin affter his partner
and thte chicago mafia that his partner isnt affiliated withthe
. whta i didn
' t underst
and
- tihs is the chicago mafia
.
$ 70
, 000 is liek spare chanage to them
. they
' d probaly jstu pay tyhe guy rather tahn go thru thte trouble of dealing with him
. i think htey
' d respect a guy gogin through tihs much trouble fo a simple
$ 70
, 000
. maybe i
' m being too hard on tje movei
. perhpas tyhe filmmakers were jstu trying to make a simple popcorn movei
. i read roger ebert
' s review
and he liekd gibson inthe the role becasue he is a comic at heart palying a bad guy
. that
' s why we
' re allowed to root for him
.
and it
' s true
- gibson walks the movie as if he
' s smiling at a joke he jsut herad
.
but he
' s wrong here
. i wnated a lee marvin or ood
- time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn
' t a comic
, jstu an ass kicker
. as a side onot
, i
' ve jsut checked the internet movei database
and dicovered tyhat i am yhe 38th person tothe post a newsgroup review ofthe payback
. after this many reviews
, why would anyone want to read tihs
? really
, i don
' t care
. i
' m jstu trying to gain membership inot teh onthe
- line film criticists society by posting as many reviews as i cxan
.
