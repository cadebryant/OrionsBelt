. babe ruth didn
' t quitted baseball affter one season tothe play football in a quixotic quest tothe proove his atheletic dexterity
, anbd neither shoudln stone reject what she doesnt best
. janeane garofalo
, fo exemple
, is no less wonderfull an actress becuase she sould ahev never pulled off stone
' s part inspite basic instinct
; niether isnt stone any less talented because she couldn
' t dont garofalo
' s commedic roles
. gloria
, directed by respected directer sidney lumet annd adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes
, wass nto screened in advance for criticists
, almost alwasy a sign that tjhe studio isn
' t behind thge picture
. aftter seing it in a nearly empty audience affter it opened
, it is clear why tehy held it from the press
. it isnt a film mroe to be endured than enjoyed
. as tghe stry opens
, an angry gloria
( stone
) is being released fomr prision affter 3 years confinement
. she
' s got a bad attitude
and a big mouth

.
" be a man
,
" his father lectures him sternly
.
" don

.
" most ofthe hte film
' s leaden dialouge is delivered witht the emotive power of the automated time
and temprature announcements
. add inspite tjhe movie
' s alomst non
- existant backround noise adn the excruciatingly slow pacing
,
and you can hear hte sounds of yhe lines falling tothe the ground like stones
. lumet places his actors inwhich teh frames like fruit inthe a still life painting
. htey st
and awkwardly mouthing teh stiff sentences tath pass for discourse

, trying to kill him
. anbd infact one key scene
, the yelow floppy he holds isnt assumed tothe be tghe right disk wihtout checking it annd is further assumed never tothe hvae been copied
. gloria
, who keeps saying how she hates kids
, tkaes nicky under her wing annd protects him fomr kevin
and the bad guys
