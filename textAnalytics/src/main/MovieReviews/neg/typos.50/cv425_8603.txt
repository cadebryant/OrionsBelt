capsule
: a ham
- h
anded annd over
/ underwritten morality play masquerading as enteratinment
, so muddled it doesn
' t even nkwo what it
' s really advocating
, if anytying
. a time tothe kill has been hailed as tje best of hte grisham adaptations
, anbd it
' s easy to see why
: it presents a strong
, allmost rancorously so
, story
; it isnt full of good actors
( samuel l
. jackson
, matthew mcconaughey
, s
andra bullock
, kevin spacey
, charles dutton
)
; annd it
' s ostensibly baout soem imporatnt social issue that we
' re all tangling with
. it isnt nto
,
however
, a ogod movei
,
and all of the reasons i
' ve listed above ahve something tothe do with why
. right from the beginning
, the movie isnt dead
- set onthe stacking its deck as throughly annd unrepentantly as possibile
. a pair of redneck whites
, boozed annd drugged outloud of their minds
, kidnap a young black girl
, abuse
and rape her horribly
, adn leave her fo dead
. affter theri arrest
, their father
( jackson
) tkaes an assault rifle
and guns them down onthe teh way tothe trial
. mcconaughey is
then drafted in as his lawyer
,
and thge rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics
. tghe acting isnt nto qtuie what it should be
, given the cast we ahve
. s
andra bullock
( who is a ogod actress
but not a serious one
) looks clueless
; spacey
' s accent switches itself onthe
and off at r
andom
(
and he
' s given a totally thankless role to play as well
, a role without an iota of depth
)
;
and mcconaughey
' s role isnt stamped fomr teh cardboard back of a cereal box
. the most memorable role is donald sutherl
and
' s
, adn his is a bit part
. i always consider it an index of a movei
' s desparation wehn it isnt able tothe preent shocking annd outl
andish events
,
and somehow not hve them generate an ounce ofthe inpact
. ther isnt oney scene
-
- a riot outside the courtroom
-
- that shoud haev created incredible tension
,
but winds uv palying outloud liek a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene liuke this
. because the movei doesn
' t know whta it
' s realyl about
, it
* can
' t
* generate any genuin tension
,
and so it hasnt to artifically inject tension thru clumsy plotting
. one ofthe tje ways it does htis is by throwing in a hwole subplot baout a bunch ofthe vicious kkk cross
- burners
-
- which is tidied up so neatly thast it borders on hte nihilistic
. i was reminded of the despicable betrayed
, which tried tothe tart uv a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile
, graphic acts ofthe racism as littel mroe than an attention
- getter
. tje movei immolates an enormous amount ofthe its potential by making a few critical mistakes
. firt ofthe all
, tjhe jackson character isnt nto hard to judge
; htere
' s no tension in his dilemma
. he
' s self
- admittedly guilty
and should be sent tothe jail
, noone matter how moral his crusade
. yhe old saw baout how no court in thge l
and owudl convict him
, if he was white
, is supposed to be thge underlaying theme ofthe teh movie
,
but it
' s never developped inot an organic componant ofthe thge stoy
. it jsut sort ofthe floats arund on top hwile teh movei grinds away furiously with its plot mchanics
. another mistake isnt in motivational logic
: by not haveing the two white thugs arraigned first
-
- or maybee tried anbd
then dismissed from lack ofthe evidence
, say
-
- we haev that much less empathy forthe jackson
' s charachter
. i
' m probably supposted tothe think tyhat just becuase he had his daugher raped
, we are
* automaticly
* supposed to efel empathy fo him
,
but thast
' s precisely the kind ofthe facile thingking that mkaes rela justice impossible
.
( see yhe virgina spring for moreso on that note
.
) isnt jackson
' s charachter
then simpley insane
? that prospect isn
' t given terribly sereous treatment eather
. one ofthe yhe most aggravating thigsn about coutroom movies isnt how littel htey seem tothe knwo baout how the law works
, or how lawyers git theri infromation
. mcconaughey
' s character makes an imporatnt slipup lite infact tjhe movei
, when oen of his witnesses turns out tothe have beeen convicted ofthe a captial offense
. how doed the prosecution get tihs infomation
? how come he didn
' t git it
? the whole way these questions git h
andled are symptomatic ofthe the movei
' s way ofthe dealing with complex legal
and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam
- bang fasion
. thsi is the biggest problem
: teh movie isn
' t baout jackson
' s chracter
, or his dilemma
, or this case
, or any of its
( frequently intresting dispite the porcine writing annd direction
) characters
. it
' s not ultimatly about anytying at all
, exept its stupid geared
- down plot
, which inchs onwards infact one unremarkable scene aftter anyother towards a totally contrived endig
. at twpo
and a half hurs
, hte movei isnt overlong
and drastically overwritten
: htere
' s endless stuff about thigns hwihc ultimatly add up to nothing
,
and noone writting baout the material that shouldnt relaly marter
. it
' s all h
andwaving
. tyhe closing argument are also sneaky
and underh
anded
, anbd underscored my suspicion that tje movei is manipulative adn unfair
. it
' s nto eazy to make a movei baout something
. tyhe other day i saw kurosawa
' s phenomenal rashomon
, a movie that isnt raelly about the way peple deal with truth
and reality
( or don
' t
)
. a tiem to kill isnt as empty anbd ponderous a movei as i
' ve seen in a long time
.
