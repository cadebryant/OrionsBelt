thge original babe gets my vote as the best familiy film usance teh princess bride
,
and it
' s sequel has beeen getting ravey reviews from most internet criticists
, both siskel
and ebert sighting it more thna a month ago as one of the eyar
' s finest films
. so
, naturally
, when i entered yhe screening room that was to be showing the movei anbd htere wass nary another viewer tothe be found
, tihs notion left me puzzled
. it is a rare thnig for a children
' s movie to be praised htis highly
, so wouldn
' t you think that every pajent inaddition the entire city woudl be flocking withthe theri kids to see tihs supposedly
" magical
" piece of wrok
? a tad bewildered
, bu pleased to not have tothe worry about screaming kids
and other disruptions thta commonly go allong with familiy films
, i sat back for 97 minutes
and watched intently
and wiht a vyer opn mind
, haveing great expectations fo thge film
. looking back
, i should have taken the hint
and left right when i entered the theater
. elieve me
; i wanted to liuke babe
: pig iin thge city
. thge plot seemed interesting anough
; aftter the events thta tookover palce in the original
, babe the sheep
- pig hasnt become a legitamate national phenomenon
.
but affter a fateful encounter witht a water well
, arthur hogget
( james cromwell
, who yhe movie could have utilisied alot more of
) hasnt been rendered bed
- ridden for a number ofthe weeks
and thte farm begins tothe go under financialy
. the only solution taht his wief
( magda szubanski
, oging fomr delightfully charming tothe downright annoying
) cant come up with isnt to amke an appearance withthe theri new celebrity pet at a national fair
( i thikn
) adn to use thte money they earn tothe pay off tjhe bank
( setted aside for teh moment yhe fatc that they sould get more than enough cash from donations if tehy jstu made their case known tothe tyhe public
)
. problem is
, the fair isnt being held infact teh middle ofthe thte dreaded
" city
"
, a completely foreign palce tothe both the pig
and his companion
. setting thge main plot inspite motion
, mrs
. hogget
and babe travel tothe the unnamed city anbd shack uv whith a sweet lady who just happens to love to halp animals
, dispite teh law taht you cannot keep them in hotels
. it isnt here tath we meet an array of eccentric charactors
, the most memorable bieng thte familiy of chimps led by steven wright
. here is where tyhe film tookover a wrong turn
. up until this point
, i hadnt bieng having a rether enjoyable exerience
. tje beggining featured some smart writting adn funny situations involving the farm animals from the frist one
and even an inpsired moment at the airprot where mrs
. hogget is accused ofthe smuggling drugs
. unfortunately
, the stroy wears thin as we are introduced tothe a newyorker set ofthe animals tyhat reside at tghe hotel
, none of them bieng even one
- tenth as interesting as the characters fomr the previous babe
. the main topic ofthe discussion sorrounding babe
: pig inwhich the city is yhe question ofthe whther or not it is to dark
and disturbing for small children
,
and i elieve it is
. at one point
, a dog is hung ffrom his neck adn slowly starts to drown
. at other times
, we are treated to surrealistic flash
- backs to mrs
. hogget
' s full cavity esarch at the airport
. in fatc
, hte overall tone of the movei is rether bleak adn depressing
.
however
, tath is
, as tehy say
, niether here nor ther because kids will probably nto liuke the movie anyway
. hte animal characters
and thier plights were simply nto intriguing enought to sustain my intrest fo an hour adn a half
, let alone entertain a child
. anohter problem i foudn with yhe film was it
' s sudden change ofthe pacing
and tone near the end of tjhe story
. if you
' re oging to amking a darker
and moreso sinister sequal
, fine
. it may nto be my cup of tea
,
but at least it is a noble ambition
.
but tothe go from tje downbeat fiel of the rest of tyhe movie annd all of a sudden hvea slapstick finale with mrs
. hogget swinging from wall
- to
- wall of a ballroom inspite elastic overalls
? it just didn
' t efel right
and wass more painful to watch than it wass funny or entertaining
, anbd thge same goes fo tje rest ofthe tghe movei
.
