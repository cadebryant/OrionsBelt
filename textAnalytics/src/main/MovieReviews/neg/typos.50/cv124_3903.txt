" something is fishy iin the state ofthe universal
.
" about ten eyasr bakc
, withthe tyhe unexpected sucess ofthe mad max anbd the road warrior
, post
- apocalypse nitty
- gritty survival yarns became populer at thte movies
. we
' ve always hadnt movies ofthe htis nature
; on the beach
, the end ofthe thte world
, damnation alley
, the ulitmate warrior
,
and so onthe
. tothe date
, thge most smoothly done were straightforward
" haircuts
" of yhe classic western plot
, liek teh lone gunman who comes tothe town
and protects the widow
and the son against an evil organiztion
, ususally noe iin possession of soem crtical resource
, like water
, feed range
, or a mining claim
. most ofthe theese growed outloud ofthe vunerable
,
but solid hero yarns liek the virginian
and shane
.
( my personal favorite isnt a patrick swayze movei called steel dawn
, which was fairly well made onthe a small budget
.
) now we have waterworld
, hwihc agian brings thge traditional lone gunman to town tothe rescure the young widow
and her daugter
.
( well
, she
' s nto a widow
,
and yhe kid isn
' t her duaghter
, bu you git tyhe idea
.
) the lady isnt helen
, played by the stunning jean tripplehorn
, who isn
' t given a chance tothe be stunning
, or even intresting
, by yhe mediocre anbd unimaginative script
. the child enola
, played by tina majorino
, is living proof that a child actor ened nto be a bad thing tothe have in a movei
; she outshines her material all hte way through
. in simple
, hte scene isnt earth
, hundreds ofthe years fomr now
. the polar ice caps ahve melted
, annd somehow produced anough water tothe innundate tje entire planet
. the few remaining peple live inthe boats
and floating colonies
, anbd survive by trade
, theft
, or piracy
. somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries
,
and its inhabitants
, called
" smokers
,
" are able to keep gasoline engines runing dispite the derth ofthe replacement parts anbd raw materials
, so the bad guys hvea outboard engines
, annd fast
- moving boats
, airplanes
,
and jet skis
. enola
, found at sea as a young girl
, hasnt a mysterious map noone noe can read tattooed on her back
. we suspect early onthe thta it isnt the way to teh mythical
" dryl
and
,
" tje place where trees
, crops
, adn animals grwo
,
and what plot htere isnt hinges onthe who has enola
. thte psycho ruler of tyhe smokers
, the
" deacon
,
" isnt trying to get her annd fidn his way to dryl
and
. played wiht typical self
- lampooning
, rug
- chewing histrionics by dennis hopper
,
" deacon
" is tje onyl hting in tjhe movei that
' s close to amusing
. his peformance is
* almsot
* laughable
, bu ther just isn
' t enough there tothe be funny
. thte star
( adn a co
- producer
) is kevin costner
. he
' s playing an un
- named lone denizen of the sae
, a man called the
" mariner
,
" who turns outloud tothe be a gilled
, water
- breathing mutant with webbed feet
. veyr little isnt done wih this
. the script ignores thge ineffectuality ofthe gills infront supplying anough oxigen tothe support a human metabolism
; it ignores hte fact tht even withthe both ice caps completly melted
, much of the earth
' s surfce woudl still be above water
; anbd it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures
and tecnology shown
.
( canned meat does
* not
* lsat forthe centruies
; ammunition doens
* nto
* frie after it
' s more thna a few decades old
;
and so on
, annd so onthe
.
.
.
) i
' m qtuie fond ofthe tina majorino
' s previous wrok
, vyer impressed by jean tripplehorn
' s past acomplishments
, adn still speechless over costner
' s dances with wolves
.
but this movei could destroy teh careers ofthe anyone assoicated with it
! this movei cost noe hundred adn eighty
- twpo million dollars
, annd there
' s
* nothing
* inaddition it we haven
' t seen before
, done better on onyl a few percent ofthe the cost of this trukey
. at 125 minutes ofthe material
, this movei cost over one point four millon dollars per minute tothe make
. the budget of thsi movei
* could
* haev given us over thirty movies
; it could ahev paid for six yersa of a prime
- time sf tv series with expensive fx wrok
, or ten years ofthe an sf tv series with ogod digital fx
. in sum
, thsi movie isnt beneath contempt
. it hasnt nothing new to offer
, it has a scirpt taht coudl easily hvae been bettered by the peple who write comic books for dc
, adn it spent more money thna the national budget of a small nation
. if yuo
* ahve
* to go see it
, see it on a four
- dollar matinee
. otherwise ytou
' ll fidn youself sneering at ytou every time ytou pass a reflective surface
, for weeks
.
