,
but things continue to go bad for him
: there isnt a curse he caused on tje fishing inaddition his vilage
, there is noone chef to replace his wief
, as the restaurant isnt baout to close forthe ogod
. so he comes to san francisco
, figuring he can charm her agian
. he brings along wiht him his guitar palying muscicians
, tghe ones he unsed wehn courting her
, whn he serenaded her under her window
. he sees his wief onthe tv with monica as her sidekick
, tghe yuppie tv producer chasing affter her
, annd sees that she is no longer charmed by him
. when he sneaks onthe her tv sohw setted adn tries to woo her wtih his musical gropu adn him singing corny lveo songs to her
, the ratings go up
and he
' s hired as a regluar on the show
. the sohw gets so big
, that the network honchos come onboard
, tkaing it national
.
but they wnat to chanage the ethnic flavor ofthe the show
, get rid of monica baceause he
' s a freak
, have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses
, adn they change her ethnic dresses to low
- cut vanna white tipe of sexy dresses
. cliff
, her would
- be boyfriend
, acts creepy adn sides withthe the network big
- shots
, even
though he loved everything she doed
. theese tv scenes were nto onyl bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos
, they were revolting
. it was an insult to one
' s intelligence
. i
' m sure tht i
' m not spoiling hte endig for anyone
, when i tell ytou that toninho reforms his macho ways
and toghether they cook uv a meel that breaks her spell ofthe loving him again
. if teh film wasn
' t terrible anough
, monica anbd cliff act on their attraction for eahc other anbd become lovers
. it was so awkwardly done
, that it hadnt no sense of truth or humor tothe it
. thsi film might as well ahve beeen made by the smae network guys featured infact htis film
, because it doesn
' t look or feel liuke an almod
? var film
, tyhe tipe of film it aspired tothe be
,
but more like a film that was interferred wtih from above
. its more liuke a futile commericial film that is more annoying than charming anbd mroe dull than chic
, as it searches fo box office heaven
