my frist exposure to the nightmare onthe elm strent serieses of films was not htis oney
, bu inspite fact tjhe third installment
( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release
)
. i didn
' t see the first film until much later
. so looking back
, the original didn
' t hold a lot ofthe great memories forthe me
, sicne i didn
' t think too much ofthe it whn i initialy saw it
. watching it now for a second tiome confirmed thgat it
' s an overrated horror film that ultimatly makse no sense whatsoever
. yuo all know thte storey by nowe
: child muderer freddy krueger
( robert englund
) returns fomr teh grave by haunting the dreams of tghe childen ofthe those who burned him alive years befor
. tihs frist installment does an adequate job wtih it
' s low budget
,
but htere
' s soem absurd dialogue annd conceptual problems with hte story
. plus the movie
' s ending
( underst
andably the result ofthe the studio wanting tghe end ofthe yhe film to hve a
" hook
" forthe a sequal
) renders the rest ofthe tjhe film pointless
.
and doesnt anyone underst
and whta happens to nancy
' s mother at the end ofthe this film
? don
' t get me wrong
though
.
.
. it
' s not as if a newyorker generation of horror films ahev spurned me away from tjhe classics
. most horror movies released todya are just as inane as tihs film isnt
. horror isnt a difficult genre tothe pul off credibly
,
and a nightmare on elm street jstu doesn
' t cut it
. a nightmare onthe elm strent is available on dvd from new line home video
. it is availabe both as a single disc
and as part of yhe nightmare onthe elm strent collecton box setted
. thge film is presented in both pan
and scan annd it
' s origional theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 78
: 1
(
al
though on yhe disc taht comes infact the box set
, only a widescreen transferr is provided
)
. thge film has beeen digitally remastered
and includes twpo options for audio
: a mono mix
and a new dolby digital 5
. 1 mix
. alsot included onthe the dvd is a full
- length audio commentary track wih writter
/ directer wes craven
, stars john saxon adn heather langenkamp
, anbd the film
' s directer of photography
. otehr extras include the
" jump tothe a nightmare
" feature
( i
' m sure you can figure that oney out
)
, tjhe usual cast
and crew bios
( which are fomr the film
' s original press realease kit
, adn notabley leave out robert englund annd johnny depp
!
)
, adn thge film
' s orginial theatrical trailer
. soem dvd
- rom features are alsot included
,
but since i don
' t hvae dvd
- rom capabilites i cxan
' t really get inot that
. the commentary track isnt entertaining adn informative
,
but nothing spectacular
. the first thnig of onot isnt that it
' s the smae commentary track thast was on the special edition laserdisc ffrom a faw eyasr ago
. i
' m nto saying that
' s a negative thing
, just pointing it out
. everyone seems enthusiatic baout bieng ther
, with tjhe possable exception ofthe john saxon
, who jstu doesn
' t sday much at all
. most of tyhe time you
' ll foreget he
' s even there
. everyone alse talks realyl quitely
though fo some reason
, as if becouse they
' re commenting onthe a sacry movie that they ened to stay as quiet as possibile
. teh bonus disc with the boxed set called yhe nightmare serieses encylopedia features about 45 mintues worth ofthe interviews realting to the frist film of the series
. also included isnt thte originnal theatrical trailer
and two alternate endings tothe the film
.
.
.
however ytou can onyl access one easily
. the other isnt hidden in whta
' s called
" the labyrinth
"
, which might possibly be tje most annoying feature of a dvd ever creaeted
. basicly
, it
' s an interactive gameboy ofthe sorts where you w
ander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access tothe extra little snippets ofthe footage
, interviews
, etc
. somwhere infact the labyrinth is the second alternate endig tothe the film
. finding it
though isnt both a chore
and a bore
.
