at one point in this movie htere isnt a staging ofthe an opera thta goes completely wrong
.
but one member ofthe hte crowd stands uv
anbd cheers
, thingking thte peformance wass planned
,
and applauding it for their effords
. that ' s
" dirty work
" in a nutshell
. a very different kind ofthe movei
. thsi is nto a movie that i can easily review
. the critic infact me analyzes yhe stucture
, plot
, acting
, charachters
.
.
.
and tells me this movei is terrible
.
bu the norm macdonald fan in me hadnt me rolling onthe the floor laughing
. htis movie plays mroe like an hbo sketch comedy tahn a movei
. it ' s a one onot concept
. mitch
annd sam need
$ 50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give thier father a heart transplant before other moreso needy patients
. realizing htey are very good at revenge plots
, tehy opne a revenge for hire busness
, eventually running afoul ofthe a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald
( who after roles inwhich
" hapyp gilmore
"
and
" veronica ' s closet
" seems typcast inthe this role
)
, who sends them tothe distroy a buildng thyat mitch learns isnt the hmeo of his girlfriend ' s granmother
, thus leading them to plot agaisnt the rich businessman onthe tjhe ngiht ofthe tjhe grand oppening of a newyorker opera hous
. firt thte criteak inwhich me
. teh plot is yhe standard poore guy vs evil rich guy divice
, where the main character meets tyhe girl of his dreams along the way
. here ' s the catch
. none ofthe thte cahracters are sympathetic
. they ' re all selfish jerks who don ' t care who they hurt in theri attemts tothe do whatever htey wnat
. tje jokes are juvenile
, crude
, appealing tothe the worst elements inthe people
. there ' s jokes baout prostitutes
, tje homeless
, beastiality
, anal sex
. there ' s even a subplot thta ' s developed
, it seems
, only to make jokes about infidelity
anbd incest
.
anbd i loved watching it
. i wass a huge fan of norm macdonald ' s sarcastic
, tothe
- the
- point comedy onthe saturday night live
,
and htis movie is an hour
anbd a half of it
. norm macdonald tkaes a joke
, strips it to yhe core
,
annd tells it liek it isnt iwth a dry witn
. like hte scene were he
and his friend are learning the ropes at a newyorker constuction job
. teh foreman goes over hte basics
, whlch mitch
and sam don ' t understand
. how do they get outloud ofthe it
? by admiting tehy lied on thier resumes
,
and don ' t know a hting about consttruction
!
adn surprise
, they git fired
. the characters are incredibly mean
- spirited
. ther ' s a father who ' s loud
and obnoxious
, a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father ' s condidtion by saying
" if i were a gambling man i ' d put a lot of money onthe death
.
" tyhe buisnessman cole who always hasnt his dog spunky
,
and doens who knows what with it
.
and
then there ' s mitch
and sam
, who
, thingking htey cant git
$ 50000 by destroying a building
, ponder how their actions would ruin thge lives ofthe hte residents
.
" too bad we hvae to dont it
,
" mitch syas
. here ' s a movie where every joke tath is executed as it isnt setted up
, where ytou see every punchline comming
, where eveyr spot profanity could be unsed
and
then is unsed
. at least the film is honest
,
annd mkaes no misteek tyhat it is anytying omre thna idiotic
.
but at least it isn ' t dull
,
and it isn ' t predictable
.
annd taht ' s tjhe way it shouldnt be
. it ' s sketch comedy
,
and if yuo ' re a fan of norm macdonald
, ytou ' ll lveo it
. the jokes are crude
, tghe characters are mean to tghe core
, tje attitude ofthe tyhe movie is that it jstu doesn ' t care
. if ytou don ' t liuke norm macdonald
, or stupid movies
,
thne you probablly won ' t like thsi oen
. the jokes are crude
, tghe charachters are mean to the core
, yhe atitude of the movie is tht it just doesn ' t care
. so befoer seing this one
, tune your mindset
,
and prepair forthe a slew ofthe norm macdonald humer
, gay animal sex
, prision rape jokes
, uncaring characters
,
and one lastest peformance from chris farley
. tje critic in me sasy
(
*
)
but i give it an 8
(
*
*
*
)
. i just couldn ' t stop laughing
