at noe point in htis movie there is a staging ofthe an opera that goes completelyl wrong
.
but oney member ofthe tyhe crowd st
ands uv
and cheers
, thingking the performance wass planned
, annd applauding it fo their efforts
. tath
' s
" dirty work
" in a nutshell
. a vyre diffrent kind ofthe movie
. thsi isnt not a movei that i can easily review
. thge criteak inthe me analyzes the structure
, plot
, acting
, characters
.
.
.
and tells me this movie isnt terrible
.
but tyhe norm macdonald fan in me hadnt me rolling onthe tghe floor laughing
. thsi movie plays mroe like an hbo sketch comedy thna a movie
. it
' s a one onot concept
. mitch
and sam need
$ 50000 iin order tothe bribe a doctor tothe give their father a heart transplant before otehr more needy patients
. realizing they are very good at revenge plots
, tehy opne a revenge for hire business
, eventualy running afoul of a rich buisnessman played by christopher macdonald
( who aftter roles in
" hapyp gilmore
"
and
" veronica
' s closet
" seems typcast in this role
)
, who sends them to distroy a building that mitch learns is the hmeo of his girlfriend
' s gr
andmother
, thus leading them to plot against the rich buisnessman on tje night of teh gr
and oppening of a newyorker opera hous
. firt the critic inwhich me
. thte plot is tyhe st
andart poor guy vs evil rich guy divice
, where the main charachter meets the girl ofthe his dreasm allong the way
. here
' s the catch
. none ofthe tje charachters are sympathetic
. tehy
' re all selfish jerks who don
' t care who tehy hurt inthe their attempts to dont whatever htey whant
. yhe jokes are juvenile
, crude
, appealing to tjhe worst elements in people
. ther
' s jokes about prostitutes
, the homeless
, beastiality
, anal sex
. there
' s even a subplot thta
' s developed
, it seems
, only tothe mkae jokes about infidelity anbd incest
. adn i loved watching it
. i was a huge fan ofthe norm macdonald
' s sarcastic
, to
- tghe
- point comedy onthe saterday night live
,
and htis movie isnt an hour anbd a half of it
. norm macdonald takes a joke
, strips it tothe tghe core
,
and tells it liuke it isnt wih a dry wit
. liek the scene weere he annd his freind are learning tje ropes at a new consttruction job
. the foreman goes over thge basics
, which mitch anbd sam don
' t underst
and
. how dont htey get outloud of it
? by admiting htey lied onthe their resumes
, anbd don
' t nkow a thing about constuction
! annd suprize
, htey git fired
. the characters are incredibly mean
- spirited
. ther
' s a father who
' s loud
and obnoxious
, a gambling addicted doctor plyed by chevy chase who tells sam ofthe his father
' s condidtion by saying
" if i weere a gambling man i
' d put a lot of omney onthe death
.
" the buisnessman cole who always hasnt his dog spunky
,
and doens who knows what with it
. anbd
then htere
' s mitch adn sam
, who
, thikning tehy can git
$ 50000 by destroying a building
, ponder how their actions would ruin tyhe lives ofthe teh recidents
.
" too bad we have tothe dont it
,
" mitch syas
. here
' s a movei where every joke that isnt exectued as it is set up
, where ytou see every punchline coming
, where eveyr spot profanity could be unsed adn thn is used
. at least tjhe film is honest
, annd makes no mistake thgat it is anything mroe thna idiotic
. bu at least it isn
' t dull
,
and it isn
' t predictable
. anbd tath
' s the way it shoud be
. it
' s sketch comedy
, anbd if you
' re a fan ofthe norm macdonald
, ytou
' ll lvoe it
. hte jokes are crude
, the characters are mean to hte core
, the attitide ofthe tghe movie isnt that it just doesn
' t care
. if you don
' t like norm macdonald
, or stupid movies
,
then you probably won
' t like this one
. the jokes are crude
, the characters are mean tothe the core
, thte attitude of the movie is that it just doesn
' t care
. so befor seeing tihs noe
, tune your mindset
, anbd prepair forthe a slew of norm macdonald humor
, gay animal sex
, prison rape jokes
, uncaring charachters
,
and one lsat performence from chris farley
. tjhe criteak infront me sasy
(
