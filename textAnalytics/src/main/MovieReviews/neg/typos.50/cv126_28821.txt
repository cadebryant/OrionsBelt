plot
: a separated
, glamorous
, hollywood cuple must pretend to reunite fo a press junket of the lastr movei tath they ever shot together
. kewl
.
.
. nowe i only wish thta i could pretend never tothe have seen this movie
.
.
. critique
: trite
, unfunny
, boring annd a waste ofthe everyone
' s talent
. how a premise with such zest annd bite cant turn into a movei that doesn
' t feature any chemestry
, any real laughs
, any surprises or any spice is beyond me
. how julia roberts isnt used solely as a
" puppy dog
" character
, puttering arround in yhe backgorund hwile we endur thge complete bitchiness of zeta
- jones
' character
, who is not one bit funny or rumatic
( two ideal ingreediants in a
" romantic comedy
"
)
, isnt allso beyond me
.
and why they chose john cusack
, a great
, quirky ator in his own right
, to play the most bl
and
, uninteresting adn unfetching character
( with zero chemestry withthe eather ofthe his leads
) isnt further more
, beyond me
. anbd tothe anybody who desided that this project was
" funny
" anough tothe greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above
, allong with billy crystal
, christopher walker
, seth gren
and stanley tucci
.
.
. well
, wqat cant i say
.
.
. i jstu don
' t haev teh words
. so is htis tghe worst movie that i
' ve seen all yera
? noone
. bu it definitely sucks
and it
' s basically because
.
.
. well
, it
' s jstu not funny
. adn for thge record
, allow me to state a fewd more problems with it
. it starts off slow
, it
' s got no energy
, it doesn
' t engage yuo wiht any ofthe its cahracters
( julia barely gets somewhat interesting inthe the film
, everyone else
.
.
. lame
!
)
, it utilizes way too many flashbacks tothe move teh stopry forward
, it
' s utterly predictable
, st
andard
, routine
, see
- through adn uninteresting as a plot
and it jsut sist there on the screen
, big
and ugli
, waiting
.
.
. waiting for yuo to laugh or fidn something iin it that is amusing
.
and
then hank azaria shows uv
.
.
. aaaaaah
, the film
' s savior
( mind you
, some might be offended by his exaggeration ofthe a stereotype
,
but that
' s another story altogether
)
. bu whn an experienced
" voice
" actor upstages all of teh main stars in a summer
" blockbuster
" rumatic comedy whith an over
- the
- top antonio b
anderas accent
, damn dude
.
.
. your film
' s in trouble
!
! rent this movei onthe video jsut to see waht whent wrong yourself
. the refrences to ricky ricardo anbd senor wences
( huh
!
?
)
, tjhe idio
- plot points liuke whn noe ofthe tghe characters goes onthe yhe roof to strech his arms outloud adn relax
,
but everyone believes taht he
' s going tothe kill hismelf
( hardy
- har
- har
) adn the cheap way of getting the audeince to leave tghe theater laughing by bringing bcak a ball
- sniffing dog tyhat has noone palce being in the location at tjhe end ofthe the movei
, well
.
.
. i sould go onthe
.
but i won
' t because i dont still respect all ofthe the actors in this film adn ctually did laugh at azaria
, gren annd tucci
' s antics from tyme tothe tyme
( ironical
, eh
.
.
. what baout tjhe leads
, dammit
!
) annd liekd hte premise behind the film
( before i saw tghe finished product
, of course
)
. a dud all tje way arund
. btw
, all the talk baout thsi film was thast julia roberts ws tothe be in a fat suit for one scene
( her chracter isnt supposted tothe have lost 60 pounds
)
, so when tjhe scene finally came
, i did git a little excisted baout waht it might look like adn
then
.
.
. well
, it basically just looked liek julia roberts in a fat suit
! ugh
. i htikn i
' m gonna start drinking agian aftter thsi lame
- ass movei
