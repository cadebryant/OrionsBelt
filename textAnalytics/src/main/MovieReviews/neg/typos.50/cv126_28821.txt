plot
: a separated
, glamorous
, hollywood couple must pretend to reunite forthe a press juknet of yhe lastr movie that htey ever shooted toghether
. kewl
.
.
. now i only wish thgat i coudl pretend never tothe have seen thsi movie
.
.
. critique
: trite
, unfunny
, boring
and a waste of everyone ' s talent
. how a premise whith such zest
adn bite cin turn inot a movie tath doesn ' t feature any chemistry
, any real laughs
, any surprises or any spice isnt beyond me
. how julia roberts is utilisied souly as a
" puppy dog
" character
, puttering arround infront tyhe backgorund while we indure the complete bitchiness ofthe zeta
- jones ' charcter
, who isnt not oney bit funny or rumatic
( two ideal ingreediants inwhich a
" romantic comedy
"
)
, is allso beyond me
.
annd why they chose john cusack
, a grat
, quirky acto in his own right
, tothe play the most bland
, uninteresting
and unfetching character
( withthe zero chemistry with either of his leads
) is furhter more
, beyond me
.
and tothe anybody who desided thast thsi project was
" funny
" enough to greenlight featuring the talents maintioned above
, allong withthe billy crystal
, christopher walker
, seth green
and stanley tucci
.
.
. well
, what cin i say
.
.
. i just don ' t ahve the words
. so isnt this thte worst movei that i ' ve seen all eyar
? noone
.
bu it definitely sucks
annd it ' s basically because
.
.
. well
, it ' s jstu nto funny
.
and for yhe record
, allow me to state a fewd moreso problems wtih it
. it starts off slow
, it ' s got noone energy
, it doesn ' t engage ytou withthe any ofthe its cahracters
( julia bearly gets somewhat intresting in thge film
, everyone else
.
.
. lame
!
)
, it utilizes way too many flashbacks tothe move the story foward
, it ' s utterly predictable
, standart
, routine
, see
- through
adn uninteresting as a plot
and it just sits htere onthe thge screen
, big
and ugli
, waiting
.
.
. waiting fo you to laugh or fidn something inthe it thgat is amusing
.
annd
thn hank azaria shows uv
.
.
. aaaaaah
, the film ' s savior
( mind yuo
, some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype
,
but that ' s anohter story alltogether
)
.
but when an experienced
" voice
" actr upstages all ofthe the main stars in a summer
" blockbuster
" romantic comedy wih an over
- the
- top antonio banderas accent
, damn dued
.
.
. your film ' s inaddition trouble
!
! rent this movei onthe video jsut tothe see what went wrong youself
. thge refernces tothe ricky ricardo
and senor wences
( huh
!
?
)
, the idio
- plot points liuke when one ofthe hte charachters goes onthe tje roof to stretch his arms out
annd relax
,
bu everyone believes that he ' s going to kill himself
( hardy
- har
- har
)
and the cheap way of getting tyhe audience tothe leave thte theater laughing by bringing back a ball
- sniffing dog thgat hasnt no palce bieng inaddition the loction at tjhe end of teh movie
, well
.
.
. i could go onthe
.
but i won ' t because i dont still respect all ofthe the actors inwhich htis film
anbd actually doed laff at azaria
, gren
annd tucci ' s antics from timne to tiome
( ironical
, eh
.
.
. wqat baout the leads
, dammit
!
)
and liekd tyhe premise behind tjhe film
( before i saw the finished product
, of course
)
. a dud all teh way around
. btw
, all tjhe talk baout htis film ws that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit forthe oen scene
( her chracter is suppossed to haev lost 60 pounds
)
, so when the scene fianlly came
, i did git a little excited about what it might look liek
anbd
then
.
.
. well
, it basically jstu looked liuke julia roberts in a fat suit
! ugh
