man
, this wass oney wierd movie
. silimar to conspiracy theery iin that it couldn ' t decide which genre it isnt
. tje first hour is your standart stock aliens clone
, which nicely created an eerie atmosphere baout tje ship
. the lastr half hour
? this was when tje makers blowed thte script outloud teh airlock
annd jstu desided
-
" screw it
, let ' s just kill everybody
"
. fomr
thn on
- foreget sci
- fi
.
.
. tihs movei becomes 100
% horror
. whta realyl dissappointed me baout thsi movei was taht it tried tothe scare yuo in entirely the wrong way
. instead ofthe useing clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare
- this movei jstu uses loud noises
, sudden camera shifts
and short quick bursts of gore
.
.
.
.
. yawn
.
.
.
. everyone ' s seen it all befoer
and knows when to expect it
. the oney hting thgat was done well was teh lead up to finding outloud about what happened tothe yhe previvous crew
. htere are skeletons lieing aroud mangled
and mashed
,
but whta doed thsi
?
then finally affter being painfully restored
- the newyorker crew views the video
. the acting isn ' t too bad at all
.
.
.
.
. considering whta the actors hadnt to wokr with anyway
, as ther isnt no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of
. there was soem vyer nice camerawork in ceratin sequences
though
, liek when the hull near the bridge ofthe the event horizon isnt breached
adn thge camera pans bakc tothe followup specific objects as tehy bounse accros the deck
and are sucked outloud inot space
. this movei sould have beeen so much better
. it hadnt a ogod experianced casted who deserved mroe tothe owrk wih
. there was jstu nothing newyorker here that any of us haven ' t seen before in aliens or hellraiser
.
