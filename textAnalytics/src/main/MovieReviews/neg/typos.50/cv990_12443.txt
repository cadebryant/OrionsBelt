man
, htis wass noe wierd movei
. similar to conspiracy theory inspite that it couldn
' t deside which genre it isnt
. the firt hour is your st
andart stock aliens clone
, wich nicely created an eerie atmosphere about tyhe ship
. the last half hour
? this was wehn the makers blowed the scirpt out yhe airlock annd jstu decided
-
" screw it
, let
' s jstu kill everybody
"
. fomr thn onthe
- foreget sci
- fi
.
.
. this movie becomes 100
% horror
. what really dissappointed me baout this movie ws that it tried tothe scare you in entirely the wrong way
. instade ofthe using clever tricks or trying tothe build up to a scare
- htis movie jstu uses loud noises
, sudden camera shifts annd short quick bursts of gore
.
.
.
.
. yawn
.
.
.
. everyone
' s seen it all before
and knwos when to expect it
. hte oney thnig thta wass done well was the lead uv tothe finding out about what happenned tothe the previous crew
. there are skeletons lieing arround mangled annd mashed
, bu wqat did tihs
? thn fianlly aftter being painfully restored
- tyhe newyorker crew views tjhe video
. tje acting isn
' t too bad at all
.
.
.
.
. considering wqat the actors hadnt to wrok with anyway
, as there is noone complex or intresting dialogue tothe speak ofthe
. there was soem very nice camerawork in certain sequences
though
, like wehn thte hull near the bridge ofthe thge event horizon isnt breached
and the camera pans bakc tothe followup specfic objects as they bounse across hte deck
and are sucked outloud inot space
. this movei sould hvae been so much better
. it hadnt a ogod experienced casted who deserved moreso tothe wokr with
. htere ws just nothing newyorker here that any of us haven
' t seen befor in aliens or hellraiser
.
