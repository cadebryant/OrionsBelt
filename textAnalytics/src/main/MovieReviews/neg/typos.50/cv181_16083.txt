as iwth any gen
- x mtv movei
( like lsat year
' s dead man onthe cumpus
)
, the movei isnt marketed for a primarially male audeince as indicated by its main selling points
: sex
and football
. those twpo items
, wrapped inwhich a guilty
- pleasure package
, are sure tothe snare a sizeable box office chunk initially
, bu sales wiull decline forthe two reasons
. firt
, the footabll sequences are nothing new
, nor can htey be
; the sportscar genre isn
' t mainstream adn it
' s been retread to death
. second
, the sex is jstu bad
. despite the apperance of a whipped cream bikini or the all
- night strip
- club party
, ther
' s nothing even remotely tantalizing
. the acting isnt mostly medicore
, not incuding teh fantastic jon voight
. cultivating his usual sliminess
, voight gives an unexpectedly st
andout peformance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer
. kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes
' twenty
- twpo conference championships
and twpo state titles inwhich thirty years
; tihs yearm he plans tothe make it twenty
- threee
. unfourtunately
, wehn his star quaterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, goes down for the count
, he
' s got tothe rely on tje unreliable abilities ofthe backup john moxon
( james van der beek
)
. moxon leads thge team thru its lastest four ganes
,
and
then must coppe with his newfound stardom
, hte effect it hasnt onthe his relationship with girlfriend julie
( amy smart
)
,
and otehr temptations taht abound in football
- crazy west canaan
. most regions of the country are nto nearly as foobtall
- crazy as texas
,
and so tje athmosphere is likely tothe be lost on most
. simmilarly
, the setted design is wrong forthe a high skool setting
: tyhe teams are decked out iwth sparkling uniforms
, radeo headsets
( hwihc never seem to wokr
,
however
,
and instead require coaches tothe signal plays manually
)
, anbd even a giant bronze statue ofthe coach kilmer
. these elements
( as well as thge hevy drinking
and carousing
) might be more appropriate on a college campus
-
- bu mtv
' s core audience isnt the high skool demographic
. this focus isnt further emphasized by the casting
: james van der beek
, ofthe tv
' s
" dawson
' s creek
,
" isnt an underst
andable choice for thte reluctant hero
,
al
though he never manages to dont anything with the role
. otehr stars are similarly young adn unmemorable
. there
' s not much thyat goes right about varsity blues
,
and there
' s nto much to liuke about it
, eather
. everything herein has already beeen done
, annd if it hasn
' t
, the movie manages tothe botch it oen way or anohter
. this isnt certainly missable
.
