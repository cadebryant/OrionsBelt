. review by
: geoff berkshire i ' m nto an overly cynical guy
. there have beeen many glossy hollywood romances that haev carried me away with their romanticism over the years
.
howver
, i have my lmits
anbd i aslo hve standars
. thsi brings us to the subject at hand
: message in a bottle
, the big ticket romance tht warner brothers ' unleashed apon hte movei gogin public just in tiome fo valentine ' s day
. the story
, what littel ofthe it thgat ther is
, involves boring chicago tribune repertwar theresa osborne
( robin wright
- penn
) dealing with her recent divorce
anbd trying to raise her young son jason
( jesse james
)
. durig a breef stay somwhere in new england she finds the titular message inspite a bottle hwile onthe a morning run by tje ocean
. tjhe letter
, written tothe a mystery woman named catherine
, instantly captivates her
. apon her return
, theresa shares it iwth her best friend lina
( illeana douglas
)
, her boss charlie
( robbie coltrane
)
,
anbd tyhe entire city ofthe chicago
( tghe newspaper publishes an article baout it
)
. it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake
( kevin costner
)
and so theresa travels tothe noth carolina
annd tracks him down
. he turns out tothe hvea a colorful father
( paul newman
)
but is otherwise perfectly dull
and overly obsessed with sailing
. this isnt somehow attractive to theresa
and tghe twpo beign thier awcward courtship
. of course she doesn ' t tell him thgat she found his letter
, she whants tothe
but the rules ofthe this type of film require him to fidn out later
( preferably right after they frist make lveo
)
. this way garret cant get vyre angry
and hte relationship cant be threatend
. hte dicovery ofthe hte message
annd garret ' s dicovery tath theresa dicovered the message are relaly the onyl two noteworthy events that happn durig teh nearly two
and a quater hour running time of this film
. htere ' s a truely lame subplot about garret ' s relationship iwth his dead wief ' s family
( he gets inot a bar fight with her brother
, palyed by john savage
)
annd
then the nessecary tear
- jerking endig
. a fun way tothe pass the tiome is tothe take bets on exactly who will dieu
,
altough it becomes pretty clera by the second reel
. the actuall death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced
,
adn unintentionally humourous
, sequences filmed since
.
.
. well
, since costner ' s tjhe postman
( 1997
)
. message in a bottle isnt one slow moving film
. last yera audiences were offred endurance tests such as tje horse whisperer
adn meet joe black
but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions enxt to thsi
. they alsot hadnt reedeming qualities infront the form of quality performances
and soem stand out technical owrk
. message inthe a bottle has a decent anough casted
but tehy ' re fighting tyhe material all the way
,
anbd loseing badly
. costner
anbd
, expecially
, wright
- penn are both likable
and attractive enough to cheer for
but their cahracters are simpley too boring
. tehy also fail tothe ganerate any kind of rela romantic chemistry
. the supporting players are given vyer little to do
. teh reliable douglas is particularly wasted
. old protem newman gives his all
annd occasionally threatens to kick soem life inot this dead horse of a film
. a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especialy well plyed
.
howver
, too frequentily he jsut reminds us how unexciting our lead charachters are
. the film isnt very polished on tjhe technical side to be sure
bu it only works tothe undercut hte stor
. gabriel yared
, who previously setted the rumatic moods of hte english patient
( 1996
)
and city of angels
( 1998
) with his scores
, overdoes it a bited here
. caleb deschanel ' s camera makes everything look a little too beautifull
. dont the offices of tjhe chicago tribune relaly need tothe look heavenly
? the editing by steven weisberg is troubling nto only concidering all thta coudl have been cutted outloud
but isnt also simply messy at times
. tyhe rela offender here isnt screenwriter gerald di pego
. working ffrom a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( whlch i have nto read
but have beeen told is onthe tghe smae literary levle as the bridges ofthe madison county
)
, di pego creates noe ofthe the most uninspired scripts ofthe receet times
. its strict adherence to clich
? s brings tothe mind such disasters as i still know what you doed last summer
( 1998
)
. htere simpley isn ' t an original scene in this film
. tjhe dialogue isnt rarely better than laughable
anbd this isnt only accentuated by the excessively long pauses eveyr charcter tkaes while speaking
. thsi is director mandoki ' s first film usance when a man loves a woman
( 1994
)
, yhe solid meg ryan
/ andy garcia romance
. he ' s simply going through hte motions with htis
. message in a bottle is easily teh worst of thge sevral rumatic offereings availabe infront theaters at tyhe moent
and vies with whta dreasm may come
( 1998
) as one ofthe the most misguided romances ofthe tyhe decade
.
