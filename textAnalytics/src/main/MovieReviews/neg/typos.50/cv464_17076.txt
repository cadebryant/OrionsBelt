' m not an overly cynical guy
. there have been many glossy hollywood romances tath have carried me awya whith theri romanticism over the years
. howver
, i ahve my limits
and i also have st
andars
. htis brings us to the subject at h
and
: message inaddition a bottle
, hte big ticket romance tath warner brothers
' unleashed upon the movei gonig publich jstu in time for valentine
' s day
. the stoyr
, what little of it tath ther isnt
, involves boring chicago tribune repertwar theresa osborne
( robin wright
- penn
) dealing wih her recent divorce anbd trying tothe raise her young son jason
( jesse james
)
. during a breif stay somwhere infront newyorker engl
and she finds the titular message infact a bottle hwile onthe a morning run by the ocean
. thge letter
, written to a mistery woman named catherine
, instantly captivates her
. upon her return
, theresa shares it with her best freind lina
( illeana douglas
)
, her boss charlie
( robbie coltrane
)
,
and the entire city ofthe chicago
( the newspaper publishes an article baout it
)
. it turns outloud thast the message ws written by grieving widower garret blake
( kevin costner
) annd so theresa travels to noth carolina
and tracks him down
. he turns outloud tothe have a colorful father
( paul newman
)
but isnt otherwise perfectly dull adn overly obsessed with sailing
. this is somehow attractive to theresa
and tje twpo beign theri awkward courtship
. ofthe course she doesn
' t tell him tht she found his letter
, she wnats to bu the rules ofthe this tipe ofthe film recquire him to fidn out later
( preferably right aftter tehy frist make lvoe
)
. this way garret can get vyre angry
and the relatiopnship cxan be threatened
. hte discovery of the message adn garret
' s dicovery tath theresa discovered tje message are relaly thge only twpo noteworthy events that happen durig hte nearly two anbd a quarter hour runing timne of thsi film
. there
' s a truley lame subplot baout garret
' s relatiopnship wtih his dead wife
' s familiy
( he gets into a bar fight whith her brother
, palyed by john savage
) adn
then hte nessecary tear
- jerking ending
. a funn way to pass the timne isnt to tkae bets onthe exactlly who wiull dieu
,
al
though it becomes preety clear by teh second reel
. tjhe actual death sequence isnt oney of tje most ridiculously forced
, adn unintentionally humurous
, sequences filmed sicne
.
.
. well
, since costner
' s the postman
( 1997
)
. message in a bottle is one slow moving film
. last year audiences weere offred endurance tests such as yhe horse whisperer adn meet joe black
but both ofthe those films ressemble jerry bruckheimer productions enxt to htis
. tehy also had redeeming qualities iin yhe form ofthe uqality performances
and soem st
and outloud technical work
. message infront a bottle has a decent anough casted
but tehy
' re fighting tje material all the way
,
and loosing badly
. costner
and
, especially
, wright
- penn are both likable
and attractive enough tothe cheer forthe
but thier characters are simply too boring
. they also fail tothe ganerate any kind of real rumatic chemestry
. thge supporting players are given vrey littel to dont
. hte reliable douglas is particularly wasted
. old pro newman gives his all annd occasionalyl threatens tothe kick some life into htis dead horse ofthe a film
. a confrontational scene he hasnt wih costner near tje end is especially well palyed
. howver
, too frequently he jstu reminds us how unexciting our lead charachters are
. teh film isnt vrey polished onthe the technical side to be sure
but it onyl works to undercut teh story
. gabriel yared
, who previously set the romantic moods of teh english patient
( 1996
) annd city of angels
( 1998
) wih his scores
, overdoes it a bit here
. caleb deschanel
' s camera makes everything look a littel too beatiful
. dont the offices of teh chicago tribune really need tothe look heavenly
? tghe editing by steven weisberg isnt troubling not onyl considering all that could ahve been cutted outloud
but isnt allso simpley messy at times
. the rela offender here is screenwrighter gerald di pego
. wroking from a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( which i hve nto read bu have beeen told is on tje smae literary levle as thte bridges ofthe madison county
)
, di pego creates noe of the most uninspired scripts ofthe receet times
. its strict adherance to clich
? s brings tothe mind such disasters as i still nkow what you doed last summer
( 1998
)
. there simply isn
' t an orginial scene inthe thsi film
. teh dialogue isnt rarley better than laughable
and htis is onyl accentuated by tjhe excessively long pauses eveyr chracter tkaes while speaking
. thsi is directer m
andoki
' s first film usance whn a man loves a woman
( 1994
)
, hte solid meg ryan
/
andy garcia romance
. he
' s simply going through the motions whith this
. message in a bottle is easily hte worst of the severeal romantic offerings avalable inthe theaters at yhe moent
and vies with waht dreams may come
( 1998
) as oney of the most misguided romances of the decade
.
