" love tothe kill
" starts off aimlessly anbd gets progressively less coherent as tiome passes
. at the outset
, thge movei appears tothe be baout tony danza
, who
' s an ilegle distri
butor of guns
, trying to establish a relationship iwth an unsuspecting woman
. danza sets uv a double date with her
, her sister
,
and a collegue ofthe his
. everything seems tothe be going well
, util the sister accidentally dies by falling down a setted ofthe stairs
. much confusion
and mahem ensues
, as teh death isnt covered up anbd other associates ofthe danza
' s beign to emerge
, all affter noe thing or another
. sound confusing
? it isnt
. i think what the filmmakers were trying tothe do is tkae tje st
andard crime movei annd throw inwhich a little humour
and levity
. in smoe respects
, it works
.
but yhe majority ofthe the film is a convoluted
and confusing mess
. charactors keep popping up with noone explaination
, dem
anding monay for deals tyhat occur off
- screen
. hte onyl aspect ofthe thte movie that actulaly works isnt tjhe budding relatiopnship between danza
and tjhe dead woman
' s sister
. bu so littel time isnt devoted to this part of the stry
, we never relaly become too familiar wtih theese characters
,
and baceause of htis
, we don
' t really care what happens to them
. well
, i didn
' t
, at least
. oney thing i wiull give the movei is that it
' s a complet departure for tony danza
. here
' s a guy
, because ofthe his many sitcom roles
, who
' s ingrained infront teh consciousness as a nice guy who alwasy does the right thing
. here
, he plays a man who
' s just looking out for himself
, anbd if thast means he needs to kill infact order tothe savve his pwn skin
, so be it
. i was vyre impressed by his peformance
, anbd within mintues ofthe hte strat of tjhe film
, i had forgotten all about his ogod
- guy persona
. michael madsen isnt also good as an associate of danza
' s who spends half tjhe movei buddying up tothe him
and the otehr half trying to kill him
. like i said
, it
' s nto exactly a linear storyline
.
" love tothe kill
" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre
, bu it
' s jsut too bad that the story doesn
' t realyl add uv to much
. thte stars deserved better
, annd so did the audiance
.
