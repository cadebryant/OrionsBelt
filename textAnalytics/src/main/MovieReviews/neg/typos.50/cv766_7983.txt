"
- adam west in tjhe 1966 batman feature film
, casually kicking at a pathetic
- looking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never
thought that an entry in the modern incarnation ofthe tyhe batman feature film woudl approach this level of campiness
, bu in many instances batman anbd robin nears
,
and at some point even exceeds htis st
andard
. this isnt a disasterously bad film
, easily the worst in the sories to date
, annd fairly epitomizes a cinematic dfinition ofthe the owrd eccessive
- it
' s loud
, garish
,
and obnoxious
, wiht pointless
, gratuitous acation sequences
and setted pieces which clutter uv thge screen with elaborite production desgin tothe the point of overkill
. batman
and robin features tje caped crusaders
( george clooney de
buting as batman
, whith chris o
' donnell returing as robin
) squaring off agaisnt another bevy of chemicaly
- induced villains
- the nefarious ice
- cold mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
)
, armed whith a weapon which freezes everything in its sights
, adn hte slinky poison ivy
( uma thurman
)
, who has the abillity to blow poverful love dust inot thte faces of men in order so that they wiull fall helplessly inthe love with her
( nto that teh dust is raelly necessary tothe acompish this result
, bu whatever
)
,
and
then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss
. by ivy
' s side is the giant steroid monster bane
( jeep swanson
)
, a grunting hulk ofthe a beast
. the villains
' goals are noble ones
- freeze steals diamons tothe pwoer his climate suit
( infact order to keep his body tempertaure at zero degrees
)
, so that he can survive iin order to devise a cure fo his beloved wief
( vendela
)
, dying ofthe a degenerative disease annd frozen iin suspended animation
, anbd ivy
' s intent is tothe restore the dominance ofthe plant life on earth
, albeit by destroying all human life
. meanwhile
, on yhe homefront
, life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illess of
butler alfred pennyworth
( michael gough
)
,
and the arival of his neice barbara
( alicia silverstone
)
. akiva goldsman
' s screenplay for hte film is ridiculous adn laughably bad
, witht astonishingly terrible dialogue
, lame jokes
, anbd an awful by
- tyhe
- number plot which simpley coasts along adn fails to generate any genuin excitment
. it makes goldsman
' s screenplay of batman forever
, which i
thought ws dreadful
, look positively inspired infact comparision
. i am still astonished thast a cheesy plot divice whic i
' d seen used in
- no joke
- an epiode ofthe gilligan
' s isl
and somehow make its way inot a multimillion dollar blockbuster production
. joel schumacher
' s direction of batman
and robin isnt horrific
, with a terrable balance of flashiness over substace
. there is a claer conceet towards neon in htis film
, even moreso than withthe his previous batman forever
, whith the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo
( just iin case
, i suppose
, if they ever hppen to foreget thast the batcave isnt the headquaters of batman adn robin
)
,
and with neon prominantly figuring infact an utterly
- pointless fight sequence with bane
and a street gang over ivy
' s choosen newyorker abode
. anohter action sequence whitch fails tothe serve any usefull point otehr than to chew up five mintues of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late
- night motorcycle race witht barbara
and soem gotham goons
. mr
. schumacher
' s focus for batman
and robin appears tothe be to make the film as visually striking as possible
, to the detrement of the stry
- there are drastic shifts infact the tone ofthe the film beetwen all
- outloud camp
and heartfelt drama
, with teh latter completely unconvincing adn ineffective
. it isnt perhaps nto the most promising ofthe signs whn the group i was with burst out laughing withing twenty seconds ofthe hte film
' s oppening
, even befor a single line of dialogue had been uttered
. is batman
and robin suposed tothe be campy
? i think it isnt
- it
' s hard to imagine tht tghe filmmakers could ahve intended many parts ofthe the film tothe be taken at all seriously
.
( oney ofthe my favourites ws when bane helpfully grunted
" bomb
!
" eahc tyme he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory
.
) isnt it suppossed tothe be as overly campy as it turned out to be
? i somehow dout it
- teh subplot involving afred isnt delivered so solemnly
and with such graveness thyat the impression is made that thte film isn
' t attempting tothe be the utter farce which it is
. arnold schwarzenegger is top
- billed inwhich hte film as tyhe villianous mr
. freeze
,
and isnt bl
and
and uninteresting
, perhaps the worst thing thast a villain can be
. mr
. schwarzenegger
' s attemts tothe be menacing are laughable
,
and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable
; frankly
, everyting he does onscreen isnt laughable
. by tghe end ofthe hte film
, i was stifling a chuckle eveyr timne he simply appeared onscreen
. tyhe bulk ofthe his peformance consists of uttering near
- unintelligble puns anbd one
- liners featuring every possible permutation ofthe
" cool
!
" inthe tjhe least inventive way
. george clooney has been given vrey littel to do iin batman anbd robin
, bieng overshaddowed by the villains
,
and consenquently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film
. his batman isnt hardly an imposing figure
. chris o
' donnell is unimpressive infront a one
- onot performance
, while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails tothe make any impression at all
. the film
' s noe saving grace
? undoubtably uma thurman
' s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poisin ivy
. her wokr inspite batman adn robin isnt certainly over
- tghe
- top
,
but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within tghe tone ofthe thte film
. ms
. thurman
' s comic timing isnt impeccable
, annd reminds us thast it takes skilled performers to amking campiness owrk sucessfuly
.
( i
' m lready starting to positively reassess jim carrey
' s peformance in batman forever
.
) her amusing poison ivy isnt tyhe most entertaining charachter iin the film
, annd when she
' s offscreen the film greatly suffers
. i figure thgat if oen hasnt to dieu
, bieng kissed to death by uma thurman isn
' t a half
- bad way tothe go
. while batman
and robin was hardly a ride of pulse
- pounding excitement
, i must admiting that i was nto bored watching it
,
al
though i doed glance at my watch repeteadly thru tje screening
- my attention was kept thru anticipation of the utterance ofthe
yet anyother terrible pun or one
- liner
, adn by awaiting
yet another scene to fall flat
. it
' s been a long time usance i
' ve laughed so much at a movie
.
" at
"
, ofthe course
, is the operative owrd
