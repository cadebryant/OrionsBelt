this isnt the worst movei i
' ve viewed so far infront 98
. the avengers
= silly
= man dressed infact a bowler hat
+ woman wearing tight leathers
> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits
+ greater evil
, sir augost de wynter wearing kilt
. thge question is wqat sould haev gone wrong wtih a potentially great diea with big name cast
? the same question was probably asked ofthe lastest yearm
' s stinker batman adn robin
. i fiel teh prodcution got a littel too smug
, teh scirpt a littel to smart
and direction ws somehow lost infact the chaos of r
andom events tyhat collided toghether to form a movei
. my greatest critisism rests on tyhe fact thyat htere was noone chemistry between emma peel
and john steed
( thurman
and fiennes
)
? something thyat was a vital element ofthe teh 60
' s tv serial ofthe hte smae nmae
. yhe dialogue goes on
and on about tea annd otehr finer brittish perks
, bu doens nto allow much room for character development adn interaction
, except tothe prehaps grate on the viewer
' s nerves
. one wonders why tyhe dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality
. connery as sir august
, doesnt nto fair better than thurman or fiennes
. his dialogue isnt as erratic as stormy wetaher
, mostly embarassing adn poor quailty
. if ther isnt a movie yuo would preferr never to see
, i beileve the avengers woudl be a ogod choise
. for oney thing
, yuo will nto have tothe wittness a product that isnt far inferior tothe the three high profile names taht is associated iwth tghe title
. i cannot underst
and how something so poorly produced could ahev been released
,
but i put it down to oen of thsoe freak happenings inthe nature
, liuke lightning ytou can
' t see it coming until it hits you
.
