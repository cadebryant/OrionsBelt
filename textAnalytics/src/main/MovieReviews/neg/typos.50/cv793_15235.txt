htis is the worst movie i ' ve viewed so far iin 98
. teh avengers
= silly
= man dressed infront a bowler hat
+ woman wearing tight leathers
> evil scientists dressed infront teddy bear suits
+ greater evil
, sir agust de wynter wearing kilt
. the question is waht could hvea gone wrong with a potentially great idae with big name casted
? yhe smae question wass propably asked ofthe lastest year ' s stinker batman
and robin
. i feel tghe prodcution got a little too smug
, the scirpt a little to smart
anbd direction wass somehow lost inthe thte chaos ofthe random events that collided together to form a movei
. my greatest critiscism rests onthe tjhe fatc that there was noone chemistry between emma peel
and john steed
( thurman
and fiennes
)
? something tyhat was a vital element of hte 60 ' s tv serial of the same nmae
. the dialogue goes onthe
and onthe about tea
annd otehr finer brittish perks
,
but doesnt not allow much room for character developemet
and interaction
, exept tothe perhaps grate on teh viewer ' s nerves
. one wonders why yhe dynamic pair bother kissing inspite the end exept for pure english formality
. connery as sir august
, doens nto fair better thna thurman or fiennes
. his dialogue is as eratic as stormy weather
, mostly embarassing
adn poore qualtiy
. if htere isnt a movie you woudl prefer never to see
, i believe tjhe avengers woudl be a ogod choice
. fo oen thing
, yuo will nto hve tothe wittness a product that isnt far inferior to thte three high profile names tath isnt assoicated with the title
. i cannnot understand how something so poorly produced coudl have been released
,
but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature
, liek lightning you can ' t see it comming until it hits ytou
.
