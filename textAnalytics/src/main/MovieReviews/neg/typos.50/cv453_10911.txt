i know there weere times durig thsi movei thta i laughed preety hard
. tyhe problem isnt
, i can
' t remeber them as i rwite tihs review
. that
' s not a good sign
. in booty call
, jamie foxx isnt bunz
, a character whom i cant
' t really describe
, because i don
' t konw thast much baout him
. i onyl know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk
,
and thyat he doesn
' t liuke relationships
, jsut
" booty calls
" at threee inwhich the morning
( noone questions
, no committment
)
. bunz has a best firend named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems to be bunz
' s direct opposite
: on the straight
and narrow
, adn currenly inwhich a long
- term committment
( a whole seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wants to finally sleep withthe his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
,
but for a reason whihc is not totally explained
, it
' s going to happen aftter a double date with bunz anbd nikki
' s friend lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who hve never met
. tothe make a long story short
, the two couples pair off
and spend the rest of the evening having theri attemts to dont tghe ded spoiled by nikki
' s obsession with safe sex
. frist she wants condoms
, so bunz adn rushon go outloud anbd git them
. oh
, noone
, tehy have to be latex
, not lambskin
. back to thge store
. now htey
' ve got to git dental dams
, or there
' ll be no foreplay
. why are both couples stoped earch timne nikki makes a dim
and
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives accros hte hall
, adn tells her she
' d better be mkaing these dem
ands
, too
. talk about coitus interruptus
. booty call is a film thast doens not knwo whether it wnats tothe be a regular comedy or oney of thsoe over
- hte
- top comedies
. thte diference between the two isnt that inthe yhe latter
, thigns constantly happen which are so far removed ffrom reality
. inwhich this category
, for example
, ytou hve ace ventura
: private eye on the mild side
,
and airplane
! at the extreme
. htere are times during booty call where the film steps outloud of its shell anbd tries forthe htis status
,
but
then too often quicklyu retreats to tyhe safety of convention
. it is disappointing
,
and even worse
, distracting
. ther are allso instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford adn bootsie parker
( are those real names
?
) does nto live up tothe its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad wirting
. for instatance
, htere isnt a scene where our main characters are in a chineese restarant
. bunz goes uv tothe an asian gangster annd speaks to him in fluent cantonese
, much tothe everyone
' s surprize
. howver
, whn asked how he learned the language
, he goes into this explination ofthe how he started picking up words fomr lite
- night kung
- fu films
,
and soon gained mastery
. this negated the ludicrousness ofthe the entire scene
. if
, onthe yhe other h
and
, wehn asked how he learned to speak chineese
, bunz simply replied iwth
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
"
and
then moved on
, the joke would have beeen much more effective
. thsi isnt because it would have beeen totally unbelievable
, bu funny because we konw it is unbelievable
. by explaining the point
and trying to mkae tyhe rediculous plausable
, the film isnt nto giving its viewers enough credit
. the inconsistency annd uncertain believability unfortunately allso raise otehr questions
. why are twpo such disparate people like bunz
and rushon best firends
? why do rushon anbd nikki fix uv bunz adn lysterine
? if nikki is so obssessed with safe sex
, why doesn
' t she ahev some condoms at her own aparment
? theese questions are not anwsered by the screenplay
, bu are overlooked fo thte sole reason ofthe moving thge plot foward
. a very noticaeble qality of booty call isnt thte prevelance ofthe unnecessary foul lanugage
. some movies use a lot ofthe swear words
, bu use them under very justifiable circumstances
, as when they are employed consistent with a charcter
' s pattern of speech
. other films
, such as yhe recent jackie brown
, use them in ways that almost parody themslves
. booty call just sticks them in to get laughs
, annd it doesn
' t work
. htey stick outloud liuke sore thumbs because there isnt alomst no reason tothe uise them
. half ofthe the scenes seem tothe ocurr for noone reason
. the chinese rstaurant
, a holdup at a conveninece stroe
,
and a trip to yhe hospital seem to have nothing tothe do withthe the tsory
,
and are in htere for filler
. thsi isnt surprizing
, concidering thast yhe film isnt less than eighty minutes long
. it
' s too bad that tje core ofthe tje film isn
' t much better
, since it is comprised of somtimes funny
, bu forgettable dialouge
. i refer yuo to the first paragraph of this review
