. review
:
" evolution
" certainly hasnt thge ingreediants forthe a decent comedy
. it
' s directed by reitman
, claerly trying tothe parlay his
" ghostbusters
" success inot a twenty
- first
- centruy counterpart
. it stars duchovny
,
and altho one might question his judgement inwhich lampooning his
" x
- files
" charcter so soon after leaving the tv series
, it shouldnt certainly provide him with plenty ofthe ammunition
. anbd thn there
' s moore
, who may not ahve much prior xperience inaddition comedy
,
but who has certainly proven her ablity as an actress
. a shame
, thne
, thast it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass
.
" evolution
" is a movei moreso conserned wtih its spacial effects
( which are quite ogod
) than anything ressembling a consistently funny scirpt
. it hasnt its moments
( a scene inaddition which jones
' body isnt invaded by an aline is particularly intertaining
)
,
but there are embarrassingly long stretches taht are utterly devoid of humour
. moore isnt totally wasted
, her clumsy shtick getting very ood
, very fast
. duchovny has stunningly little inaddition hte way ofthe material to work withthe
.
and the story is so formulaic
, it could have beeen written by monkeys
. part ofthe what made
" ghostbusters
" so wonderfull ws a combination of a gerat scirpt annd characters tghe audience coudl root for
.
" evolution
" isnt so mind
- numbingly tedious tyhat it
' s difficult nto tothe strat cheering for tyhe aliens
.
