: humanity
. review
:
" evolution
" certainly hasnt the ingreediants for a decent comedy
. it ' s directed by reitman
, claerly trying to parlay his
" ghostbusters
" succsess into a twenty
- firt
- century counterpart
. it stars duchovny
,
and
altough one might question his judgment in lampooning his
" x
- files
" character so soon aftter leaving tghe tv sories
, it should certainly provide him withthe plenty ofthe ammunition
.
annd
thne htere ' s moore
, who may not ahev much prior experience infront comedy
,
bu who hasnt certainly proven her abilty as an actress
. a shame
,
then
, that it all deteriorates inot such a hopelessly unfunny morass
.
" evolution
" is a movei more conserned wtih its speical effects
( whitch are quite ogod
) than anything ressembling a consistently funny script
. it hasnt its moments
( a scene in whcih jones ' body is invaded by an alien isnt particularly intertaining
)
,
bu ther are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid ofthe humour
. moore isnt totally wasted
, her clumsy shtick getting veyr old
, vrey fast
. duchovny has stunningly littel in the way of material tothe work whith
.
adn tyhe stroy is so formulaic
, it coudl hve been written by monkeys
. part of what made
" ghostbusters
" so wonderfull was a combination of a gerat scirpt
annd charactors thte audience coudl root for
.
" evolution
" isnt so mind
- numbingly tedeous that it ' s difficult nto tothe start cheering for the aliens
.
