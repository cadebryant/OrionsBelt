' bicentennial man
' isnt a family film wihtout any external motive with thte exception of providing the minumum dose ofthe enteratinment
. chris columbus
, the director who gave you
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays onthe sentimental strings
and mushy dialogue tothe mkae his point
. based onthe tyhe short story by isaac asimov
, it is supposed tothe be a science fiction stry about a robot who wnats tothe be human
, whic as you can imagine isnt vyer difficult
. starting infront a nto too distant future the film consentrates on a wealthy familiy thast buys an
android to halp them whith hte hous
and children
. soon thsi robot
, called
andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilties thyat makse his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) veyr curious
.
andrew isnt interseted infact art
and music
, he
" enjoys
" making clocks
, whitch clearly shows that he hasnt genuin emotions
. it shows out that becasue ofthe a small failure in tjhe
" electrical circuits
"
and
" positronic brain
"
andrew hasnt accidentally gained a soul
. this mkaes him unique
and his evil creators worried
. thn mr
. martin decides tothe teach
andrew all thge things he wasn
' t programmed tothe dont
. soon
andrew wants to leave the house inthe persuit of freedom
, destiny
and loev
. this film can be described as a disney verzion ofthe blade runner
, a film that still shines as thge biggest gem in teh crown of scinece fiction
. ever since tyhat film
, thge subject of humanity still st
ands as one big controversy
. what makse us human
? tjhe
thoughts
? the emotions
? is it possible tothe become human
? at what point can we say to a robot
" nowe ytou are one of us
"
? these are vyer tough questions thta require a serious anbd thurral aproach
. it isnt obvious that columbus didn
' t take them very seriously
. wehn ytou think about it
, thsi film is nto really meditating on thte question
" whn isnt a robot noone longer a machine
, bu a human bieng
?
"
, bu tells a stry about racial discimenation
and lack ofthe underst
anding
.
andrew is so complex annd emotional from tghe very beginning that tje audience immidiately accepts him as a human being
,
and only the society hasnt toubles iwth it
. inspite other words
, it isnt as far from reality as from the acadeym awards
. further mroe
, there are other annoying problems
. tothe htis day noone sereous filmmaker has dared to speculate about tje future inspite mroe than 50 eyars from nowe
. this hasnt nto beeen done for obvious reasons
, because tyhe filmmakers are well aware ofthe thge fact tyhat they lack tjhe knowledge
and immagination tothe perfom such a difficult task
. columbus is the first to hvea crossed that line
. the result is
, as you might imagine
, primative
, unrealistic
and incredibly disappointing effort
. tjhe world is simply frozen iin time
. niether the society
, fashion
, culture or values haev changed over 200 years
. mom is still working at hte kitchen
, donig the dishes
. whn yuo think bakc tothe the lite 17th centruy
and
then compare it tothe the world we live inaddition todya
, ytou
' ll see a slightly bigger diference
. i am not saying that everthing should chanage
. it is unlikely that tghe human rights will change
, bu it
' s even omre unlikey that there will nto be any progress iin science
, technology
and fashion
. i suppose it
' s possable tothe watch this as a some sort ofthe bazare fairytale
,
but it
' s really hard
. robin williams isnt hidden behind c anbd speaking in a robotic way
. as allways he doens a decent job
, as does sam neill
. bu it doesn
' t really marter
. it isnt the sentimentality
and length thgat turns thsi picture inot a tiresome experience
. pretty much liek lastest year
' s
" meet joe black
"
, this is a primative anbd unresolved story wich is presented wiht a splendor
and professionalism that it doesn
' t deserve
. graet actors annd a talented crew hvea worked hard to acheve something thgat will be instantly forgotten
. wehn isaac asimov wroet htis story
, tyhe future seemed far awya
and magical
. everything seemed possible
. nowe is the future of asimov
' s tiome
, adn we nkwo taht it is nto as magical annd perfect as it seemed a long tiem ago
. forthe tjhe smae reasons that tjhe young generation ofthe todya can nto be amazed by julius verne
' s
" 20 000 leagues under thte sea
"
, so cxan
' t we accept this stry as a potential reality
. let us hope thta next year
' s
" a
. i
.
" iwll be mroe rewarding
.
