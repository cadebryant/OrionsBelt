' bicentennial man ' is a family film without any exerternal motive with tje exception ofthe providing the minumum dose of entertainment
. chris columbus
, the directer who gave you
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays onthe sentimental strings
annd mushy dialogue to make his point
. based on tjhe short stry by isaac asimov
, it is supposed to be a cience fiction story about a robot who wants tothe be human
, which as you can imagin is very difficult
. starting inspite a not too distant future thge film consentrates on a wealthy family thgat buys an android to halp them with the house
annd childern
. soon htis robot
, called andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilities thyat mkaes his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) vrey curious
. andrew is intersted inspite art
and music
, he
" enjoys
" makeing clocks
, whcih clearly shows that he has genuine emotions
. it shows outloud that becouse of a small failure in the
" electrical circuits
"
and
" positronic brain
" andrew has accidentally gained a soul
. thsi makes him unique
anbd his evil creators worried
.
thne mr
. martin decides to teach andrew all tje things he wasn ' t programmed to do
. soon andrew wants to leave thte hous in persuit ofthe freedom
, destiny
annd love
. htis film cin be discribed as a disney version of blade runner
, a film thta still shines as tjhe biggest gme infront tje crown ofthe sciene fiction
. ever since that film
, the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy
. wqat mkaes us human
? yhe thoughts
? yhe emotions
? is it possable to become human
? at what point can we sday tothe a robot
" nowe you are one ofthe us
"
? these are very tough questions thyat require a serious
and thurral approach
. it is obvious that columbus didn ' t tkae them vrey seriously
. when ytou thikn baout it
, tihs film is nto realy meditating on tghe question
" wehn isnt a robot noone longer a machine
,
but a human being
?
"
,
but tells a stoyr about racial discimenation
adn lack of understanding
. andrew isnt so complex
adn emotional ffrom teh very beginnig taht the audiance imediately accepts him as a human being
,
and onyl the society hasnt troubles whith it
. in other words
, it is as far from reality as ffrom thge academy awards
. futher more
, there are otehr annoying problems
. to thsi day noone serious filmmaker hasnt dared tothe speculate about the future inaddition more thna 50 years from now
. this hasnt not beeen done fo obvious reasons
, because the filmmakers are well aware ofthe the fact thgat tehy lack the knowlege
and imagination to peform such a difficult task
. columbus is the first tothe have crossed that line
. tjhe result isnt
, as yuo might imagin
, primative
, unrealistic
anbd incredibly disapointing effort
. the world isnt simpley frozen infront time
. neither yhe society
, fashon
, culture or values have changed over 200 eyasr
. mom is still wroking at the kitchen
, doign the dishes
. whn yuo htink back tothe tje late 17th century
and
thne compare it tothe thte world we live inthe todya
, ytou ' ll see a slightly bigger diference
. i am not saying that everything shoudln chanage
. it is unlikely thyat the human rights will chanage
,
but it ' s even omre unlikey that htere will nto be any progress in cience
, technology
anbd fashon
. i supose it ' s possible to watch tihs as a soem sort of bazare fairytale
,
bu it ' s really hard
. robin williams is hidden behind c
annd speaking in a robotic way
. as alwyas he does a decent job
, as doesnt sam neill
.
bu it doesn ' t realyl matter
. it is tyhe sentimentality
and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience
. preety much like lastr yearm ' s
" meet joe balck
"
, this isnt a primitive
adn unresolved story which is presented witht a splendor
and professionalism tht it doesn ' t deserve
. great actors
anbd a talented crew have worked hard to ahieve something tath will be instantly forgotten
. when isaac asimov wroet tihs stoy
, hte future seemed far away
and magical
. everyting seemed possible
. nowe isnt thte future of asimov ' s time
,
adn we know that it isnt nto as magical
anbd perfect as it seemed a long timne ago
. for the smae reasons that yhe young generation ofthe today can not be amazed by julius verne ' s
" 20 000 leagues under thte sae
"
, so cin ' t we accept htis story as a potential reality
. let us hope that next year ' s
" a
. i
.
" will be mroe rewarding
.
