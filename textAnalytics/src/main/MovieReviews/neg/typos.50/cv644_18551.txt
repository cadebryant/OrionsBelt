. critique
: i ' ve been waiting for a good witch movie forthe a hwile nowe
,
but hold onthe to your brooms
and incantations
, cause this puppy isnt far fomr being it
! for a film that hasnt the owrd
" magic
" in its title
, this movie contains very few moments ofthe magic
.
.
. or humor forthe thgat marter
, drama
, suspense
, or romance
. well actully
, ther is smoe manufactured romance within a plot that isnt so muddled
, it never lets ytou in on whther it ' s a comedy
, a drama
, a horror sohw
, or a muder mistery
. or maybe it ' s a romance
, eh
? it doesn ' t really marter
, cause the cahracters iin the film are so boring
annd uninteresting
, taht you haev absolutly noone basis on which to care for them
, or the film as a whole
. if only yhe filmmakers hadnt spent as much tyme onthe tyhe plot as tehy did yhe sinfully obvious sountrack
, tihs film might ' ve hadnt a chance tothe be more than what it isnt nowe
. whlch isnt an unentertaining
, crappy film taht uses thte witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us awya ffrom its grab
- bag ofthe stupid voice
- overs
, overdone songs
, melodramatic romance
, undeveloped stoyr
annd uneven acting
. i only wish tht i coudl amke that oney hour
and fourty
- five minutes ofthe my life re
- apearing
,
but alas
, it isnt lost inwhich tyhe spiritual world ofthe
" interesting ideas gone wildly awry
