. critique
: i
' ve been waiting fo a good witch movei forthe a hwile now
, bu hold on to your brooms
and incantations
, cause htis puppy is far ffrom being it
! forthe a film that hasnt tjhe owrd
" magic
" inwhich its title
, tihs movie contains very fewd moments of magic
.
.
. or humer for that matter
, drama
, suspense
, or romance
. well actualyl
, ther is soem manufactured romance within a plot tht isnt so muddled
, it never lets yuo in on whether it
' s a comedy
, a drama
, a horror show
, or a murder mistery
. or maybe it
' s a romance
, eh
? it doesn
' t really matter
, cause the charachters inthe the film are so boring
and uninteresting
, tyhat you have absolutely no basis on whic to care fo them
, or tje film as a whole
. if onyl thte filmmakers hadnt spended as much time onthe the plot as htey doed yhe sinfully obvious sountrack
, htis film might
' ve hadnt a chance to be moreso than waht it isnt nowe
. whitch is an unentertaining
, crappy film that uses yhe witch angle as a diversionary tactic tothe weave us awya from its grab
- bag of stupid voice
- overs
, overdone songs
, melodramatic romance
, undeveloped stry anbd uneven acting
. i only wish tht i could make that oen hour adn forty
- five mintues of my life re
- apear
,
but alas
, it is lost infact teh spiritual world of
" interesting idaes gone wildly awry
"
