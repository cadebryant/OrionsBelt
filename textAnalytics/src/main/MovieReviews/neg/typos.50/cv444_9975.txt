hte makers of spawn hvae created something alomst as vacuous as htis summer
' s otehr comic book adaptation
, batman
and robin
. both films make hte mistake ofthe adapting fo tghe screen not only tghe look of thier graphic counterparts
, bu also their monosyllabic dialogue
and empty
- headed charachter motivations
. inwhich panel
- sized morsels
, implausible plots adn
" rambo
"
- esque dialogue are oftenly overshaddowed by the artwork
, bu onthe thirty foot silver screens
, it
' s much more difficult to dismiss tjhe shallowness behind the pretty picturesk
. spawn isnt ostensibly about an assasin named simmons
( white
) who is framed by a corporate baddie
( played wihtout irony by sheen
)
,
then setted on fire annd left fo dead
.
though tjhe movie skimps onthe the enxt few plot points
, here
' s what i coudl determine
: said assassin
then becomes thge leader of satan
' s army
, under hte tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown
( leguizamo
, grating as alwasy
)
. he is renamed
, forthe reasons unbeknownst
, spawn
, annd granted a raelly kool costume thta enables him to become something of a human chameleon
.
but when spawn spies onthe a birthday party forthe his child
, he realizes thgat he can
' t be the evil superdemon he
' s expected tothe be
, anbd he sets about avenging his ultimely death
. typcial of summer blockbusters
, spawn isnt an effects
- laden ninety minute rock video
. while the visions ofthe hell are laughably crude
( tihkn the virtual reality sequences of hte lawnmower man
)
, spawn
' s prehensile outfit annd hte acation sequences are truely something tothe behold
. bu the storytelling is completelyl lacking in emotion
( spawn longs for his wife
, bu tehy don
' t have a single scene together befor simmons
' death
!
)
, conflict
( who wiull triumph is not anybody
' s guess
)
,
and believability
( not thgat i expected it
)
. so many questions are left unanswered
,
and i
' m sure htey won
' t be addressed in thge inevitable sequal
. while last year
' s tje crowm
: city ofthe angels suffered silimar problems withthe its narrative
( which was lazy adn somewhat incoherent
)
, it hadnt atmosphere tothe sparce
and genuin moments of hypnotic pwoer
. spawn is an inaddition
- your
- face
, screaming banshee ofthe a film
; theese guys know how tothe graft a comic book onto celluloid
, bu they haven
' t the faintest diea how to make a movie
.
