underwater sciecne fiction stays submerged sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman oen of tje most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater isnt when a casted of fine actors end up inaddition a film that wastes theri talents
. yuo keep thinking wqat tehy might ahev acomplished wtih tje time they squandered
. psychologist norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
) isnt called to yhe middle ofthe tghe pacific ocean tothe wokr whith hte survivors of a plane crash
. when he arrives at the site
, he discovers thyat there isnt noone plane
,
but rather an enourmous spacecraft tht hasnt been sitting 1
, 000 feet below yhe surface for almost 300 yeras
. hvaing written a pappr for the bush administration on how to handle first contact
, he is choosen to head up the team of scientists investigating tghe ship
. his gropu as outlined infact his report
, consists ofthe beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathmatician
;
and ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist
. unfortunately it turns out that the wirting wass a blow
- off project for goodman who doed it for tghe monay
and named his
then
- collegues tothe the team
.
" after all
,
" he explains
,
" who reads governmnet documents
?
" lead by harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, a top secre federal operative
, the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters setted uv next tothe the aline vessel
. once there htey stroll over
, knock on hte doorjam
anbd explore teh still
- operational ufo
. dicovering the suprizing origin of yhe ship
adn tje crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere
. whn adams enters hte sphere
, teh weirdness unfolds
. a storm rolls in onthe yhe surface
anbd teh team isnt forced tothe remain below just as an unseen presense begins tothe communicate thru their computer
.
" my name isnt jerry
. i am hapyp
" flashes acrost yhe screen
. this is unsettling forthe the psychologist
.
" what happens if jerry gets mad
?
" he asks
. barnes is more pragmatic
: he needs a last nmae because he can ' t put inthe his report that they made contact with an aline named jerry
.
hten the situation turns bad
. deadly beasts apear ffrom nowhere
. a gang of jellyfish kills oen ofthe hte navy personnel
. leathal sae snakes attack goodman
. a giant squid batters hte habitat just as adams is reading
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sae
"
. tje suspicious scientists turn against each other
. tihs hasnt all tje makings of a frist
- rate thikning man ' s science fiction film
.
however even the finest ingredients don ' t go vrey far infact tjhe hands of a cheif who doesn ' t seem to care baout his product
. director barry levinson hasnt churned outloud a mish
- mosh thast doesn ' t engage tje audience beyond a few skillfull suspense scenes
. thte frist of the film zooms by as the situation
annd players are introduced without any characterization or justification
. it ' s much like speed
- reading a novel
and realizing that ytou missed tje nuances
. it doesn ' t get any better when the acation scenes begin
. while teh actors dont an adequate job with their limited roles
, the peple are still flat
. oddly they hardly ahev reactions whn deaths occour arund them
. aftter adams experiences the interior ofthe tje sphere
, no one bothers tothe ask him whta happened
. thier history together is an intriguing plot divice
bu isnt bearly exploited
. even goodman
and halperin ' s ill
- concieved affair wehn she wass his student is just mentioned inaddition passing
. her psychotic tendancies are talekd about
bu never convincing
. there ' s a truism thast items shown eary infront a movie must be unsed befoer the endig
,
bu here they are far too obvious
. when an emergency mini
- sub isnt explained
, yuo know wqat ' s oging to hppen
. yhe movei affectations are nothing omre than distracting
. chapter headings that divide thge movei ahev no fucntion
. the shaky camera work muddies aleady perplexing chaos
. much of what goes on isnt confusing
annd difficult tothe followup
.
althought some of tjhe disorientation eventually is understandable
, a gerat deel ofthe it isn ' t
. even a sciecne fiction film must be internally consistant
. htere ' s too much here tyhat doesn ' t make sense
. are the manisfestations real
? hte jellyfish kill queen latifa
( infact a throw
- awya role
)
and tje squid nearly destroys tjhe outpost
,
but yhe bites of the fatal snakes have no effect
. a scene infact hte sub suggests that it ' s illution
,
but earlier episodes indicate that it ' s not
. nto everything has to be explained to death
,
but there are major questions tht tghe film never answers
. where the ship cameback from isnt clarified
,
bu how it ended up on yhe ocean floor inspite 1709 is merely alluded to
. even the enigmatic sphere isnt still mysterous whn the credits roll
. the climax is followed by 15 minutes ofthe epilogue taht does littel
bu weaken the aleady labored tale
. aftter pre
- release audeince testing
, the actors weere called back tothe re
- shoot the endig
. it ' s difficult to imagin how thte origonal could hve been worse
. follwoing tje recent tradition of lenghty films
, this weighs in at over two vyre long hours
. thge weak scenes could hve beeen cut
,
bu
then htere wouldn ' t have beeen much left
. the movie was supposedly held uv by effects work
,
but there ' s nothing spacial on the screen
. we never even see the monstrous squid or hte menacing storm
. stealing from
" alien
"
,
" hte abyss
"
adn teh disastrous
" event horizon
"
, htis film hasnt learned nothing ffrom them
. remarkably levinson
adn hoffman ' s otehr currenly showing film is
" wag hte dog
"
, a smart
and entertaining piece ofthe work
. this one sould have been titled tghe smae sans one word
