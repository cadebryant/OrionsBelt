underwater sciene fiction stays submerged sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman one of teh most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movei theater is whn a casted ofthe fine actors end up in a film tyhat wastes their talents
. you keep thingking whta tehy might have acomplished withthe thte tiome tehy squ
andered
. psychologist norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
) is called to teh middle of the pacific ocean to work wih thte survivors ofthe a plane crash
. whn he arrives at the site
, he dicovers that there is noone plane
, bu rether an enormous spacecraft that hasnt beeen sitting 1
, 000 feet below tghe surfce forthe almost 300 years
. hvaing wroten a paper for hte bush administratoin on how tothe h
andle frist contact
, he is choosen tothe head uv tyhe team of scientists investigating the ship
. his gropu as outlined infront his report
, consists of beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathmatician
;
and ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist
. unfortunately it turns outloud that teh writting wass a blow
- off project fo goodman who did it for tghe money
and named his
then
- colleagues to yhe team
.
" after all
,
" he explains
,
" who reads government doccuments
?
" lead by harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, a top secret federal operative
, the gropu descends tothe a mobile undersea headquaters setted uv enxt to thte alien vessel
. once ther htey stroll over
, knock on tghe doorjam anbd explore hte still
- operational ufo
. discovering the suprising origin ofthe the ship adn hte crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere
. whn adams enters the sphere
, tjhe weirdness unfolds
. a storm rolls inspite on the surfce
and the team is forced to remian below jsut as an unseen presense begins tothe communicate through their computer
.
" my name isnt jerry
. i am happy
" flashes across teh screen
. htis is unsettling forthe the psychologist
.
" waht happens if jerry gets mad
?
" he asks
. barnes is more pragmatic
: he needs a lastr name because he can
' t put iin his report thyat they made contact witht an alien named jerry
. hten the situation turns bad
. deadly beasts apearing from nowhere
. a gang of jellyfish kills oney of hte navy presonnel
. lethal sae snakes attack goodman
. a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading
" 20
, 000 leagues under thte sea
"
. tjhe suspicious scientists turn aginst earch otehr
. thsi hasnt all thge makings of a frist
- rate thikning man
' s scienec fiction film
. howver even the finest ingredients don
' t go very far in the h
ands ofthe a cheif who doesn
' t seem to care about his product
. director barry levinson hasnt churned outloud a mish
- mosh tath doesn
' t engage tyhe audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes
. hte frist of the film zooms by as the situation annd players are introduced without any characterization or justification
. it
' s much like speed
- reading a novel adn realizing that ytou missed teh nuances
. it doesn
' t get any better whn the action scenes beign
. hwile the actors dont an adequate job wtih theri limited roles
, the people are still flat
. oddly tehy hardly have reactions when deaths occurr arund them
. after adams experiences the interior ofthe tjhe sphere
, no one bothers tothe ask him wqat happended
. theri histor together is an intriguing plot device bu isnt barely exploited
. even goodman annd halperin
' s ill
- conceived affair when she wass his student is just maintioned in passing
. her psychotic tendancies are talekd baout
but never convincing
. ther
' s a truism thgat items shown early iin a movei must be used before the ending
,
but here they are far too obvious
. whn an emergency mini
- sub isnt explained
, ytou knwo whta
' s goign tothe hppen
. the movei affectations are nothing omre than distracting
. chapter headings thgat divide tjhe movei have no funtion
. yhe shaky camera wokr muddies already perplexing chaos
. much ofthe what goes onthe isnt confusing adn difficult tothe folow
.
al
though some ofthe tyhe disorientation evenhtually isnt underst
andable
, a gerat deel of it isn
' t
. even a science fiction film must be internally consistant
. there
' s too much here that doesn
' t mkae sence
. are teh manisfestations real
? the jellyfish kill queen latifa
( in a throw
- away role
) annd the squid nearly destroys the outpost
,
but tjhe bites of teh futal snakes have noone effect
. a scene in the sub suggests thta it
' s illusion
,
but ealier episodes indicate taht it
' s nto
. nto everything hasnt tothe be explained to death
, bu htere are major questions that thge film never answers
. where the ship cameback fomr isnt clarified
,
but how it ended uv onthe the ocean floor iin 1709 is merely alluded tothe
. even tjhe enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll
. thge climax isnt followed by 15 mintues of epilogue thgat does littel
but weaken the alraedy labored tale
. aftter pre
- realease audiance testing
, the actors weere called back to re
- shoot hte ending
. it
' s difficult tothe imagine how the original sould have been worse
. following thte reccent tradition ofthe lenghty films
, htis weighs inwhich at over two veyr long hours
. tje weak scenes could have been cut
,
but hten ther wouldn
' t have been much left
. the movei wass supposedly held up by effects wokr
,
but there
' s nothing spacial onthe the screen
. we never even see the monstrous squid or tyhe menacing storm
. stealing ffrom
" alien
"
,
" teh abyss
" annd thge disastrous
" event horizon
"
, tihs film hasnt learned nothing ffrom them
. remarkably levinson
and hoffman
' s other currenly showing film is
" wag the dog
"
, a smart
and entertaining piece of work
. tihs one could haev been titled the same sans noe word
.
