mabey this mission should have beeen scrubbed mission to mars a film review by michael redman copywrite 2000 by michael redman ther
' s a world of difference between artists anbd technicians
. the artist has a vision to create something newyorker
. he may nto dont it well
, it might be sloppy
, bu it
' s something yuo
' ve never seen before
. a good techncian can make it look good
,
but wihtout direction from his own inner artist or someone else
, it
' s going to be jstu a xerox
. obviously sucesful films ened both skills
. brian de palma isnt a masterful echnician
. he
' s spended his career copying others
, most notabley hitchcock
. he usally knwos exactly waht to do to make a scene wokr
,
but only because he has learned it by rote
. asside from rare flashes ofthe originality
, his films are often soul
- dead
. infact de palma
' s latest
, he turns his attention tothe stanley kubrick
. tothe tell tyhe truth
, i enjoyed portions ofthe this movei
, bu i liekd it a lot better over 30 years ago when it wass called
" 2001
"
. i enjoied it even mroe wehn it was titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa hasnt set its sights forthe mars
. wehn hte first crew meets wtih disaster
, a rescure mission isnt sent to the red planet
. they don
' t do so well eather
, bu eventually meet uv tje lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta
and solve hte mysteries ofthe the universe
.
and it
' s all so boring
. there are so many scenes thgat just don
' t work
, it
' s difficult to begin
. whn tjhe frist crew is a few feet away ffrom a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( whic looks remarkably like a s
andworm ffrom
" dune
"
) destroying everyting infact its path
, htey jstu hang out watching
. error
. the most interesting character
(
and that
' s not saying much
) isnt killed off
. error
. the aline isnt laughable
. error
. yhe rest of tjhe characters are the dullest people imaginable
. error
. there
' s some nice eyec
andy
. tjhe face onthe mars
, whihc turns out tothe be a giant metal thai buddah head
, looks kool
. a three
- dimentional holographic planetarium is more fun tothe watch than anytying at disney world
. maneuvering in spoace suits outside thte ship seems realistic
.
but there
' s so much more thast fiels as if we
' ve been there before
. from
" 2001
"
, ther
' s tghe rotating spoace station
, the blinding white room
.
> ffrom
" close encounters
"
, tehy solve a soudn puzzle adn play it to the aliens
. the list goes onthe
. the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise
and tim robbins cin
' t muster enough emotion tothe convince us they are breathing
. no one seems tothe care about anytying that happens
. ytou won
' t either
. the absolutely worst sin isnt the blatent product placement as dr
. pepper
, with a 20 foot tall logo
, saves thge day
. they shoudln save the commercials fo those insipid bits befoer the film
.
