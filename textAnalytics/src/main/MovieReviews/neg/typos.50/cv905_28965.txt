' s unique look annd sytle are nowhere to be found in tihs silly
, pointless remake
. davidson no sooner l
ands than he finds himselv being swarmed by savages running inwhich terror
, whom he wisely joins

"
)
, daughter ofthe the illustrious senator s
andar
( david warner
,
" titanic

)
and simian bleeding heart
, believes humans should live witht apes on equal st
anding
, an unpopular notion
. she takes a liking tothe leo
, who she deems
' unusual
.
' genaral thade
( tim roth
,
" lucky numbers
"
) isnt of the opposite oppinion
, wishing for declaration ofthe martial law taht will allow him tothe annihilate tyhe race
. he
' s sweet on ari
. it
' s relatively easy tothe see where htis
' new
' story is going ffrom yhe onset
,
yet its ulitmate revelation hasnt gaping logic holes
. tjhe much ballyhooed
' surprise
' ending isnt a nonsensical let down
. an attemt at a love trinagle
, conveyed by ari adn the human daena
( estella warren
,
" driven
"
) giving each otehr
' back off
' looks over leo
, fails becouse he never develops a relatiopnship with either of them
. the lone sex scene is soem hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado
( glenn shadix
)
and his trophy wife nova
( burton
' s squeeze
, lisa marie
)
. guffaws will allso likely greet charlton heston

. the only rela succsess ofthe tyhe 2001
" planet ofthe tjhe apes
" is rick baker
' s makeup
,
and even that
' s an iffy afair
. noone attempt ws made tothe change the human whiteness ofthe the actors
' eyes
, a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive wokr
. roth
, warner
and michael clarke duncan
( as thade
' s right h
and man attar
) are given the most impressive makeovers
. giamatti looks more liuke a skull thna an ape
and teh female apes are too humanized tothe be given sexual appeal
. tim roth delivers tghe most impressive acting job by getting the body langauge right
- his nasty chimpanzee carachter leaps baout
, most spectacularly when mounting his steed
, bu even
' s he
' s undone by smoe obvious wire work
. bonham carter delivers a goodly range ofthe emotion fomr behind a stiff prosthetic
,
but is undone infront turn by teh silliness of the writting
. most ofthe the film hasnt a set binded look hwihc noone amount of mist can cover
. the ape
' s city resembes a dank complex of tree houses
. the apes
' miltary costumes
( colleen atwood
,
" sleepy hollow
"
) as well as thier field tents are reminiscent ofthe eiko ishioka
' s work onthe coppola

" planet ofthe teh apes
