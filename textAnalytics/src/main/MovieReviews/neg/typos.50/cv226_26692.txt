not a great twelve months for either ofthe the principals ffrom this movei
. earlier thsi yearm
, nora ephron wrote adn produced oney of tyhe year
' s least likeable
" comedies
" called hanging up
, featuring a bunch ofthe annoying women
( ironicaly
, lisa kudrow played one in that film as well
) who bearly hvae timne to care about anyone
but themselves
. ick
.
.
. rela sweet stuff
.
but her little unsuccessfull project was nothing compaired tothe what john travolta went through ealier this summer
, wih a film entitlied battlefield earth
. i seemed tothe be thte onyl person on this planet who somehow appreciated yhe film
, even if it wass on a
" cheese
" factor
, as everybody
, annd i mean everybody esle
, pretty much classified the movei as oen of hte worst disasters of all time
. yipes
.
.
. anyother beauty
. so wqat happens when you put theese two people in the same room
and cmo out with a movei co
- starring hte ever
- versatile lisa kudrow
? uhhhm
, you guessed it
.
.
. not much
. plot
: in order tothe excape major finacial dificulties
, a local weatherman hoeks uv with his ball
- picking lotto girlfriend adn rigs the state lottery
. bu as omre annd mroe people find out baout their scheme
, more annd more peple dem
and a part ofthe theri winnings
, anbd more
and more problems arise
. critique
: simpley stated
, i didn
' t laff once druing this entire picture
. forthe a comedy
, it offred me a few smiles
, a bunch of nincompoops as characters
, a miscast john travolta hamming it up adn lisa kudrow
, inwhich what cant only discribed as a
" sluttier
" version ofthe her character ofthe phoebe onthe tv
' s
" friends
"
. this film wass not as disastrous as i
thought it would be
,
but it was preety close
. thankfully
, the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits
, dancing as thge weatherman were left inwhich the film
' s trailer
,
and not in htis fianl cut
.
and nto unlike yhe worst movie ofthe the year so far
, beatiful
, this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic
, idiotic anbd jstu plain irritating charactors in its casted
. formost wass travolta
' s charcter
, who declined to give us any reason tothe care fo him once iin tghe entire movie
.
and fo me
, tjhe casting choice of john travolta for this role wass jstu plain wrong
. he didn
' t ift hte part
. i just saw him inspite git shorty the otehr day
and thougth about how perfect he ws forthe tyhat role
. a cool
, calculating roughneck wih a ceratin hip
, suave
" je ne sais quoi
"
. infact this film
, he looks like he
' s trying tothe be funny
, trying tothe be bad
, trying tothe be good
. we
' re nto suppossed to be able tothe notice that
,
and wehn we do
, at least in my case
, i consider it a wrong choise infact casting
. add tyhat to lisa kudrow
, boring us withthe
yet another oen ofthe her patented
" dumb blonde
" routines
, bu htis time
, dressed iin sexier outfits
. michael rapaport
, stretching one small acting muscle tothe play tyhe guy who isn
' t quite uv at the smae speed level as everyone else
.
and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells
, adn ytou
' ve got yourself an extremely quiet audeince anticipating punch lines that never qtuie materialize
. the onyl rela ogod thign that i sould say about htis film isnt thast its stroy ws actualyl half
- interesting anbd never really borde me
. i also liekd michael moore
' s perverted cousin chracter
,
and i loved
,
and i sday it agina
, loved tje charactor that bill pullman plyed
. give tihs dued his pwn movie
! he played a lazy cop
, a man who trys everyting not to dont any rela work
. he fakes injuries tothe get off duty
, trys to avoid arrest situations so that he won
' t have to fill outloud any forms
.
.
. now there
' s a base ofthe humor
. sadly
, the filmmakers desided to bring him into play with onyl baout half an hour left inwhich the film
. adn there
' s not much alse i cxan sday baout htis movei
, folks
. onthe the hwole
, it wass lame
, included a slew ofthe unlikable charachters fiddling arround in a pool of unfunny lines
,
and very littel of interest for any target audience
.
but get somebody to rwite up a movie featuring that lazy cop plyed by pullman adn i
' m ther
!
