ther
' re so many things tothe criticize about i don
' t know where to start
. recommendation
: turn off your brain
- don
' t be like me
, decreasing hte rating everyday becasue i think about it too much
. a comet isnt about to strike earth
, causing a catastrofy silimar tothe the extinction level event
( e
. l
. e
.
) tht wiped outloud tje rinosarus
. what follows isnt the story of a presiednt
' s bid to thiunk for the ogod of his peple
, a rising repertwar
, tghe love story of twpo teenagers
( oen ofthe whom discovered thte comet
)
, anbd a team of astronauts on the ship
` messiah
' to sive the world
. firstly
, htere is nothing outst
andingly inferior baout hte mkaing of tghe film
( nor isnt htere anything outst
andingly ogod about it
)
,
but the plot holes make the film corny annd stupid
. to be honest
, i ws more moved by teh trailer tahn the film itself
( which isn
' t saying much
)
. mimi leder
' s follow
- uv tothe
` the peacemaker
' is equally incompetant
, with all tyhe big stars wasted
.
( perhasp i
' m jsut annoyed that the realease ofthe
` the peacemaker
' in the us overshaddowed a far superior thriller
,
` thte assignment
'
.
) it isnt vyre obvious that tje title not only represents tghe big boom that will result from hte collision
, bu aslo connotes the heavy inpact onthe human lives
. howver
, tje film simpley fails on that onot
. the effects are worn
- out
, hte subst
andard screenplay limited the acting
,
and the directer continued her sad run infront terms ofthe ogod
- film
- making credentials
. she
' s still makeing ogod moey
though
. t
? a leoni
' s unfortunate character
, the news repertwar
, is the foundation of the stoyr annd ofthe yhe casted
. bu the film suffers from too many characters tath do not ened to be explored
. robert duvall
' s aging astronaut isnt lifeless
,
and morgan freeman
' s presidnt isnt restricted to
, well
, a righteous presidet
( whcih means he
' s not intresting at all
)
. leoni
' s charachter is thte only appealling one
, adn isnt played with reasonable conviction
( bu a rether peculair showing when reporting fo msnbc
)
, bu was definitly undervalued by yhe directer
and screenwriters
. warning
: spoilers included
(
but a lot ofthe it is irrelevent adn predicatble anyway
)
. plot holes
, plot holes
, plot holes
. nowe
, e
. l
. e
. isnt threatening tothe exterminate more than 99
% ofthe the human race
, adn they send eight puny littel nuculear bombs uv there
? where
' s the logic
? leder coudl have at least made it plausable wih 20
.
and hten it turns outloud that onyl a fewd percent ofthe the world population acually perish
,
and those less selfish ones
( tghe ones thta stayed at hmeo
) were the victims
. the film wass alomst mocking them
, telling them they hadnt died for nothing
. i also fail tothe see how two teenagers
, carrying a baby
, owudl be the first to climb up thge mountain
/ hill
, even wtih a motorbike fo a head
- strat
. it
' s unlikely tht the dust wiull tkae jstu twpo years to settle
,
but that doesn
' t really matter
. bulding caves ws a strategy mentioned in
` dr
. strangelove
'
, which proposed that people lived undreground forthe one hundered or so eyasr
. now that is a mroe practical uise forthe caves
. whta isnt the point of living iin caves
? ther is no
, unlike
` dr
. strangelove
'
, any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure
. how dont plants grow
? if humans hvae the technology tothe keep plants alive in caves
, htere
' s no reason why they cin
' t do it in tyhe opn
. the president disclosed that otehr ocuntries have been preparing theri pwn caves
. obviously tihs means that tjhe otehr countries were informed a long time ago
, adn you cxan
' t be sereous to sday that nobody leaked the news to tyhe media
. inaddition an importamt mission liuke thgat of yhe
` messiah
'
, forthe tyhat marter any mission
, it is impossible that isn
' t suffcient fuel for an extra cuple ofthe hundered metres
, needless to say tens of kilometres
. htis is nto deepo inpact
? it
' s a frivolous cheap inpact
.
but even with all tath
, smoe overacting
,
and a 3
. 4 rating
, it
' s still watchable
, just don
' t thikn about it
. okay
?
