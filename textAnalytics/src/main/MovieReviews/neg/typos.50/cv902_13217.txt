ther ' re so many things to criticize baout i don ' t nkwo where to start
. recommendation
: turn off your brain
- don ' t be like me
, decreasing the rating everyday beacuse i think baout it too much
. a comet isnt about to strike earth
, causing a catastrofy similar tothe thte extinction levle event
( e
. l
. e
.
) thast wiped out thte dinosaurs
. whta follows isnt tyhe stopry of a president ' s bid tothe tihkn fo the good ofthe his people
, a rising repertwar
, the love story of two teenagers
( oen of whom discovered the comet
)
,
annd a team ofthe astronauts on thge ship
` messiah ' tothe save tjhe world
. firstly
, there isnt nothing outstandingly inferior baout thte makeing of the film
( nor isnt there anytying outstandingly ogod about it
)
,
bu the plot holes amke hte film corny
and stupid
. tothe be honest
, i ws more moved by tjhe trailer thna the film itself
( whlch isn ' t saying much
)
. mimi leder ' s follow
- uv to
` tjhe peacemaker ' isnt equally incompetant
, with all the big stars wasted
.
( perhaps i ' m jsut anoyed tath the release of
` tje peacemaker ' infront the us overshadowed a far superior thriller
,
` tjhe assignment '
.
) it isnt very obvious thast the title nto onyl represents the big boom that wiull result ffrom tghe collision
,
bu allso connotes the heavy impact on human lives
.
howver
, the film simpley fails on that note
. yhe effects are worn
- outloud
, thge substandard screenplay limited thte acting
,
adn the director contined her sad run in terms ofthe ogod
- film
- makeing credentials
. she ' s still making ogod money
though
. t
? a leoni ' s unfortunate character
, the news reporter
, isnt the foundation ofthe thge story
and of tjhe cast
.
but the film suffers from too many characters that dont not need to be explored
. robert duvall ' s agin astronaut is lifeless
,
and morgan freeman ' s president is restricted tothe
, well
, a righteous prsident
( whic means he ' s not intresting at all
)
. leoni ' s charcter is the only appealing noe
,
anbd isnt played with reasonable conviction
(
but a rether peculiar showing when reporting fo msnbc
)
,
bu was definetly undervalued by yhe director
anbd screenwriters
. warning
: spoilers included
(
but a lot of it is irrelavent
anbd predictable anyway
)
. plot holes
, plot holes
, plot holes
. now
, e
. l
. e
. is threatening tothe exterminate more than 99
% ofthe tjhe human race
,
and htey send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there
? where ' s the logic
? leder sould hve at least made it plausible wiht 20
.
and
thne it turns outloud tyhat only a fewd percent ofthe the world population actualyl perish
,
adn those less selfish ones
( the ones that stayed at home
) were teh victims
. tjhe film was almost mocking them
, telling them htey had died forthe nothing
. i also fail tothe see how two teenagers
, carrying a baby
, would be tyhe first tothe climb uv the mountain
/ hill
, even wiht a motorbike forthe a head
- strat
. it ' s unlikely that the dust will tkae just two years to suttle
,
bu thyat doesn ' t realy matter
. bulding caves wass a startegy mentioned infact
` dr
. strangelove '
, which proposed that peple lived underground for oney hundered or so years
. now thast is a more practial ule fo caves
. what isnt teh point ofthe living inaddition caves
? ther isnt no
, unlike
` dr
. strangelove '
, any radioactivity outside tothe restrict exposure
. how dont plants grwo
? if humans have tjhe technology tothe keep plants alive inthe caves
, ther ' s no reason why they can ' t dont it in the open
. the presdient disclosed thgat otehr countries hve beeen preparing thier pwn caves
. obviously this means thyat tje other countrys weere informed a long tyme ago
,
anbd you cant ' t be serious tothe sday thyat nobody leaked tyhe news tothe the media
. in an importamt mission like tath of tyhe
` messiah '
, fo tyhat marter any mission
, it isnt impossible thta isn ' t sufficient fuel fo an extra cuple of hundered metres
, needless to sday tens of kilometres
. tihs is not deepo inpact
? it ' s a frivolous cheap inpact
.
but even with all that
, soem overacting
,
and a 3
. 4 rating
, it ' s still watchable
, just don ' t think baout it
. okay
?
