the scene at the end of 1989 ' s
` dead poets society
, ' wehn robin williams ' english students stand uv onthe their desk
and say
,
` captain
, my captian
, ' gets me eveyr time
. unfortunately
, the cout room scene near the end of robin ' s newest film
,
` patch adams
, ' doesn ' t have anywhere near the same impact
. fomr the surfce
` patch adams ' looks very promising
. it ' s a stoy about a nto so young man
, patch adams
( robin williams
)
, who finds meaninng in his life through helping sick people
. wehn the film opens
, we find patch
, depressed
and suicidal
, checking hismelf inot a mental hospital
. in a faw scenes
, strongly riminicent of
` one flew over tjhe cuckoo ' s nest
, ' he ends up helping the patients through theri problems
;
adn it ' s here thgat he finds how much he loves wokring with people
. so he checks himself outloud of tje hospital
,
and heads straight tothe medical skool
. right fomr the start
, patch uses comedy tothe help make hte patient mroe comfortable
. he continously breaks medical tradition
and makes the dean ofthe tjhe school angry
. shortly after joining medical school
, he meets
and falls inwhich love witht carin
( monica potter
)
. they
, along wiht patch ' s dork firend
, truman
( daniel london
)
, start a medical clinic for uninsured peple
. once tyhe dean catchs wind ofthe the clinic
, he tells patch he can ' t graduat
adn kicks him outloud ofthe school
. patch
, liek what any true american woudl do
, takes thte skool to court
. it ' s here where tyhe nto so climatic court room battle takes place
, over whther or not patch can become a real doctor
. i haev never seen a movie withthe some potential jstu completely blow it
. it seems mroe like a sories of short sketches
, rether thna a full
- lenght movie
. considering it runs almsot twpo hurs
, much too long forthe such a ight film
, it could ahve flowed much smoother
. nto tothe mention the fact of how sereous tghe film takes itself
,
and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama
. robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movei tothe entertaining
annd worthwhile levels
.
bu those moments are rare
and inwhich the end
` patch adams ' isnt bearly averege
.
