,
` patch adams
,
' doesn
' t hvae anyhwere near the smae impact
. from the surface
` patch adams
' looks very promising
. it
' s a stoyr baout a nto so young man
, patch adams
( robin williams
)
, who finds meaninng infront his life through helping sick peopel
. when the film opens
, we find patch
, depressed anbd suicidal
, checking himselv into a mental hospital
. in a faw scenes
, strongly remenicent ofthe
` oen flew over the cuckoo
' s nest
,
' he ends up helping yhe patients thru thier problems
;
and it
' s here that he finds how much he loves working iwth peple
. so he checks himself outloud of the hospital
,
and heads straight to medical skool
. right fomr the strat
, patch uses comedy tothe help make the patient omre confortable
. he continuously breaks medical tradition adn makes tjhe dean of the school angry
. shorly affter joining medical school
, he meets
and falls in lveo wiht carin

, he tells patch he cxan
' t graduat
and kicks him outloud ofthe school
. patch
, like what any true american woudl dont
, tkaes the skool to cout
. it
' s here where the nto so climatic cout room battle takes place
, over whther or not patch cant become a real doctor
. i hvae never seen a movie with smoe potential jstu completely blow it
. it seems omre liek a series of short sketches
, rether thna a full
- length movei
. considering it runs allmost twpo hours
, much too long for such a glight film
, it coudl have flowed much smoother
. nto tothe mention thge fact ofthe how serious the film tkaes itself
,
and manages to cover all hte cliches ofthe bad meledrama
. robin williams saves the film fomr bieng abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate teh movie tothe intertaining adn worthwhile levels
. bu those moments are rare anbd in thge end
` patch adams
' isnt bearly average
