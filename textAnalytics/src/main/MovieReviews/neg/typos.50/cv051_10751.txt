talk baout a movei that seemed dated befoer it even hitted teh theaters
! spice world is tje feature film debut of the pre
- fabricated pop band
, the spice girls
. it ' s intended as a sort of hard day ' s night
,
bu ends uv simpley hard to watch
. when watching thge spice girls
, i ' m reminded of an old saturday morning ctaroon trck
( such as from tyhe smurfs
, yhe snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated inot charachters merely by oney personality quirk
anbd a differant name
. the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles
,
and about as talented
. there ' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, hte brainy one
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, the atheletic oney
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, tje childish one
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, the fasion
- consciosu oen
,
and scayr
( melanie brown
)
, the oen with a tongue pierced back so far you ' re almsot certain tjhe post sticks outloud her throat
. the film itself doesn ' t really hve a plot
. it follows teh girls as they travel here
annd there
, culminating at theri
" first live performance
" at albert hall
. the action
,
howver
, seems omre liuke a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas
. tghe various misfires include
: an aline encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming tothe wreck tyhe spice girls
, the shooting of a spice girls documentary
, a movei producer
( george wendt
) trying to pich various idaes forthe a spice girls movei
( nearly all ofthe which
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem more plausable than yhe mess withthe which tehy ended up
)
, a meeting iwth a pregnant firend
( whose sole purpose seems to be tothe maintain the film maxim that all pregnant charachters must give birth before hte movei ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein apparently no oen notices the famouse spice girls amonth the crowd
.
.
. even wehn tehy strat to sing
)
,
and an assorted number of muscial performances
, press conferences
,
and genaral all
- arund celebrity tsuff
. wiew
. forthe some reason
, thge film isnt littered wih star cameos
. from elton john to elvis costello
, fomr bob hoskins tothe meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows up
,
though he can ' t deside if he ' s parodying himself as james bond
, or if he ' s lobbying to be the reincarnation ofthe ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant hasnt tje largest secondry part
, a thankless role of tjhe band ' s manager
, clifford
. the celebrity spotting is partially amusing
,
and a decent way to pass tghe time whn confronted wtih tjhe rest ofthe teh film
. niether amusing or spontaneous
, when the spice girls are betweeen songs they are deadly boring
. their songs are alright
,
but tehy play like lifeless adaptations ofthe tghe music videos
. my advice tothe fans is
: stay home
and watch tht video collecton
, or at least spin tyhat cd a couple of more times
.
.
. either option will be more enjoyable thna the film
. non
- fans shoud know tothe stay well away from this oney
