talk baout a movie thta seemed dated before it even hitted teh theaters
! spice world isnt the feature film de
but ofthe thte pre
- fabricated pop b
and
, the spice girls
. it
' s intended as a sort of hard day
' s night
,
but ends uv simply hard tothe watch
. when watching thte spice girls
, i
' m reminded ofthe an old saturday morning cartoon trck
( such as from the smurfs
, thte snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) in whitch identicaly animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by noe personality quirk
and a different name
. tyhe spice girls are themselfs as interchangable as pringles
,
and about as talented
. there
' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, the brainy noe
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, the atheletic one
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, teh childish one
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, the fashon
- cosncious one
,
and csary
( melanie brown
)
, tjhe one wih a tongue pierced back so far you
' re alomst certian the post sticks out her throat
. tyhe film itself doesn
' t raelly have a plot
. it follows the girls as htey travel here annd ther
, culiminating at thier
" first live peformance
" at albert hall
. yhe acation
, howver
, seems mroe liek a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas
. the various misfires inlude
: an aline encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming tothe wreck thte spice girls
, the shooting ofthe a spice girls documenatry
, a movie producer
( george wendt
) trying tothe pich varous ideas fo a spice girls movie
( nearly all ofthe hwihc
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem more plausible thna the mess with whcih tehy ended up
)
, a meeting with a pregnant friend
( whose sole purpose seems to be to manetain the film maxim that all pregnant cahracters must give birth before the movei ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein apparently noone one notices yhe famoust spice girls among hte crowd
.
.
. even wehn tehy strat to sing
)
, annd an assorted number of musical performances
, press conferences
, annd genaral all
- arround celebrity stfuf
. whew
. forthe some reason
, hte film is littered with star cameos
. fomr elton john tothe elvis costello
, ffrom bob hoskins to meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows uv
,
though he cxan
' t deside if he
' s parodying hismelf as james bond
, or if he
' s lobbying to be hte reincarnation ofthe ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant has tghe largst secondary part
, a thankless role of the b
and
' s manager
, clifford
. the celebrity spotting isnt partialy amusing
, adn a decent way tothe pass the timne whn confronted with thte rest ofthe tjhe film
. niether amusing or spontaneous
, whn thge spice girls are betweeen songs they are deadly boring
. thier songs are alright
,
but htey play like lifeless adaptations ofthe tjhe music videos
. my advice tothe fans is
: stay hmeo
and watch that video collection
, or at least spin thgat cd a cuple ofthe mroe times
.
.
. eather option will be mroe enjoyable than tghe film
. non
- fans shoud konw to stay well awya fomr thsi one
