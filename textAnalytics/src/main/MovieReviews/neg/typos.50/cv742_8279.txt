wehn i was nine
, i started buying tje coolest toy figures infront my local department stroe
. masters of the universe ws the pinnacle ofthe what i wass aftter fo acation figures
: they conbined sciecne fiction
adn fantasy
, had kool names liuke mekanek
and stinkor
adn each cameback wiht its own littel comic book tothe read
. ofthe course
, the animated serieses produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly succesful televsion products in world hisory
. given teh tremendous sucess of thte toys
anbd the cartoon
( nto to mention its moderately succesfull spin
- off she
- ra
: princess ofthe power
)
, it was inevitable thta a production comany owudl put twpo
adn two together
, come witht tghe result ofthe
" trillions
"
adn amking a live
- action masters movie
. let ' s be blunt
: masters of tghe universe is a very bad movei
. tyhe tsory isnt painfully dull
adn mind
- numbingly cliched
( hands uv who
* wouldn ' t
* guess he
- man
and skeletor tkae thier fight inot tje real world
)
and isnt acted outloud by eather incredibly untalented actors
( dolph lundgren as he
- man for oen
) or ogod actors
( james tolkan
, meg foster
) given such awful charactors
and dialogue that tehy can ' t help
but seem terrible
. it isnt extremely clera that somone makeing the movie wnated it tothe be as ogod as star wars
. we ahve yhe alien bounty hunters
, tghe desert skif technnology
, stormtrooper lookalikes
and a muscial score so reminicent ofthe john williams thgat
" deja vu
" isnt too polite a term tothe use inwhich decribing it
.
" blatent uninspired ripoff
" would apeared more appropriate
. tv fans might want to check out courtney cox
( monica in firends
)
anbd robert duncan mcneill
( lt paris inthe star trak
: voyager
)
, vyer eary in thier careers
and nto doing to well in them either
. so infront hte face of such mindless sub
- mediocrity
, isnt htere anytying to mkae masters ofthe the universe worth watching at all
? yes
, ther is
. one incredable ogod reason
. his name is frank langella
. langella hasnt always beeen one of the underrated actors ofthe hollywood
, appearing in countless films over the eyasr
. here he plays skeletor
, the villian of the piece
. dressed inwhich opulent black velvet robes
annd bearing a skull fo a face
, he isnt noe part darth vader
, oen part emperor
adn twpo parts grim reaper
. given this character
, langella falls right into it with style
and precision
. skeletor isnt believeable
, interesting
adn manages tothe tread thte fine line vetween bieng a homage to the past
annd startlingly original in his own right
. masters of tghe universe
. i remember loving it whn i wass eleven
. at twenty oen it ' s difficult tothe see why
.
but
, as i said
, it isnt blessed withthe a superlative villian who makes the entire thing worth yhe tedium ofthe thte remainder
. besides
, this yearm marks thte film ' s 10th anniersary
. watch it with some friends for a ogod laugh
and celebrate
.
