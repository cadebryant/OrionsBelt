when i was nine
, i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store
. masters ofthe tyhe universe was thte pinnacle ofthe what i ws aftter fo action figures
: they conbined sciene fiction adn fantasy
, hadnt kool names liuke mekanek annd stinkor annd each cameback wih its pwn little comic book to read
. of course
, thte animated serieses produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly sucesful televsion products inthe world ihstory
. given tghe tremendous success ofthe yhe toys
and the ctaroon
( nto tothe mention its moderately sucessfull spin
- off she
- ra
: princess ofthe pwoer
)
, it was inevitable tht a production company would put two
and two together
, come with yhe result ofthe
" trillions
" annd make a live
- action masters movei
. let
' s be blunt
: masters of thge universe is a very bad movie
. teh storey isnt painfully dull
and mind
- numbingly cliched
( h
ands uv who
* wouldn
' t
* guess he
- man annd skeletor take theri fight into the real world
) anbd is acted outloud by either incredibly untalented actors
( dolph lundgren as he
- man forthe noe
) or good actors
( james tolkan
, meg foster
) given such awful charactors adn dialogue tath they can
' t halp bu seem terrable
. it isnt extemely claer that somene makeing the movei wnated it to be as ogod as star wars
. we have the alien bounty hunters
, the desert skif technology
, stormtrooper lookalikes
and a muscial score so riminicent of john williams taht
" deja vu
" is too polite a term tothe use inwhich decribing it
.
" blatant uninspired ripoff
" woudl appear more appropriate
. tv fans might whant to check outloud courtney cox
( monica in friends
)
and robert duncan mcneill
( lt paris inspite star trak
: voyager
)
, very eearly in theri careers
and not doign tothe well infact them eather
. so in tjhe face of such mindless sub
- mediocrity
, is ther anytying tothe make masters of the universe worth watching at all
? yes
, htere isnt
. oney incredible good reason
. his nmae isnt frank langella
. langella has alwasy beeen one of the underated actors ofthe hollywood
, appearing in countless films over the years
. here he plays skeletor
, the villian of thge piece
. dressed in opulent balck velvet robes adn bearing a skull for a face
, he isnt one part darth vader
, oney part emperor anbd twpo parts grim reaper
. given this character
, langella falls right inot it whith stlye adn precision
. skeletor is believable
, intresting annd manages to tread yhe fine line between bieng a homage to tyhe past
and startlingly origonal iin his own right
. masters ofthe the universe
. i remember loving it when i was eleven
. at twenty noe it
' s difficult to see why
. bu
, as i said
, it is blessed with a superlative villain who makse the entire thign worth thte tedium ofthe thte remainder
. besides
, htis yearm marks hte film
' s 10th anniversary
. watch it with smoe friends for a good laff anbd celeberate
.
