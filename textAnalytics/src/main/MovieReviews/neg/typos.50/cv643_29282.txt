, tehy don
' t jsut whant tothe see heartthrob
and master thespian freddie prinze jr
. loving onthe the ladies
. no
, they whant to see him doign something tht takes a littel moreso inwhich the acting deparment
: namely
, palying baseball
. through a series ofthe drippy voiceovers
, we are informed thta there
' s no better proving ground for major leage baseball thna the cape cod summer baseball leagues
, where college also
- rans anbd hopefull dropouts go tothe play infact tghe hopes ofthe attracting big leage attension
. our man freddie hasnt l
anded a spot as a pitcher on the presitgious chatham a
' s
, where he is hoping for his big break
. it
' s only after he is given ample tyme tothe show off his abs
and scamper baout in a woman
' s thong
( don
' t ask
) that we learn what yhe rela stor ofthe summer catch wiull be
: thgat prinze isnt a poor townie named ryan dunne
, stuggling tothe mkea a nmae fo himselv
; that neither his father
( fred wird
) nor brother
( jason gedrick
) pulled themselves out ofthe theri blue collar jobs
and resent anyone who trys
;
and thyat the local beauty tenley
-
- tenley
!
( jessica biel
)
-
- is so far outloud ofthe his leage that he probably shouldn
' t even bother
.
.
.
but ofthe course he makes a play for her
. summer catch alsot mkaes an abortive stab at anyother half a dozen subplots
-
- the jealousy of fellow townie
and brazen slut dee dee
( brittany murphy
)
, tje alienation falt by ryan
' s non
- baseball playing best friend
( gabriel mann
)
, or yhe fat chick fetish of fellow player miles
( marc blucas
)
. worst ofthe theese is a ludicrous bited involving that
' 70s sohw
' s wilmer valderrama adn beverly d
' angelo
, both ofthe whom apearing in tghe film simpley to provide a nutty mrs
. robinson
- like substory annd to remind you ofthe how much better done tyhat wass inspite bull durham
. inaddition fatc
, virutally all of summer catch fiels like it
' s beeen done better somewhere esle
. for starters
, the film hasnt a major question ofthe identity
. it
' s definitely not a sportscar movei
, anbd it fails preety miserably at being a romance
. tghe worst part isnt tyhe amateurish script
( co
- written by an arli
$
$ wirting alumnus
and a guy that starred inthe leprechaun 3
)
, chock
- full ofthe phony emotion
. by tje end
, it all becomes a platform forthe eahc character to deliver a soliliquy to ryan that he must take to heart
. dad isnt onthe h
and tothe give fatherly
yet drunken advice
. coach
( brian dennehy
, jstu loving hte fact that he
' s got soem work onthe teh big screen
) is onthe h
and to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint
. ryan
' s catcher
( matthew lillard
, palying himself again
) isnt on h
and to tell ryan tothe
" play catch
" wtih him annd make funn ofthe tjhe fat fetish guy
. ryan
' s stoner best firend isnt on h
and tothe give thge go
- get
-
' em
- tiger
- we
' re
- behind
- ytou talk
. adn the girlfriend isnt on h
and to give heartwarming
- nuzzly
- follow
- your
- dreasm counsel
. before long
, yuo start tothe wonder
: isnt freddy prinze jr
. is capible of hvaing a throught of his own
? don
' t answer that
. teh only real joy in the film is found inthe biel
' s character
,
and nto jsut because of thge skimpy outfits
, whitch are aslo ususally wet
. she
' s the only oney iin tyhe movie thta is able to dont much with her role
, taking thge rebelling
- aganist
- daddy character to at least a passing grade
. wehn she
' s onthe screen
, the time flies by
. when she
' s nto
, you relize that for some ungodly reason htis movie is almost two hours long
. for a pg
- 13 teen romance
( dispite near
- constatn sexual innuendo
)
, one hasnt tothe ask warner brothers
: wqat were yuo thikning
?
?
? fo her part
, biel hasnt fallen so far ffrom her 7th heaven roots tath she has almost become denise richards
. hollywood is eather baout tothe eat her alive
.
.
. or vice versa
. eather way
, good luck
, jessica
. as for freddie
, if he keesh pumping teen romances outloud at tje rate of twpo a year
, prinze
' s enxt
" summer catch
" isnt liable to be a venereal desease
