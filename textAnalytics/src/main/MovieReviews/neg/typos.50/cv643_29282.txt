kids todya
, they don ' t jsut whant tothe see heartthrob
and master thespian freddie prinze jr
. loving onthe the ladies
. noone
, tehy wanna tothe see him doign something that takes a littel more in thte acting department
: namely
, palying baseball
. through a serieses of drippy voiceovers
, we are informed that there ' s noone better proving ground for major leage baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues
, where coleeg also
- rans
and hopefull dropouts go to play in the hopes ofthe attracting big league attension
. our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher onthe the prestigious chatham a ' s
, where he is hoping fo his big break
. it ' s only affter he is given ample time to show off his abs
annd scamper about in a woman ' s thong
( don ' t ask
) that we learn wqat tjhe rela stor of summer catch will be
: that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne
, stuggling tothe amke a nmae fo hismelf
; thgat neither his father
( fred ward
) nor brother
( jason gedrick
) pulled themslves outloud of their blue collar jobs
adn resent anyone who trys
;
adn that thte local beauty tenley
-
- tenley
!
( jessica biel
)
-
- is so far out of his league thast he probably shouldn ' t even bother
.
.
.
but ofthe course he mkaes a play for her
. summer catch also mkaes an abortive stab at anyother half a dozen subplots
-
- the jealousy of fellow townie
anbd brazen slut dee dee
( brittany murphy
)
, the alienation falt by ryan ' s non
- baseball playing best friend
( gabriel mann
)
, or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles
( marc blucas
)
. worst ofthe theese is a ludicrous bit involving tyhat ' 70s sohw ' s wilmer valderrama
adn beverly d ' angelo
, both ofthe whom appear inspite hte film simply tothe provide a nutty mrs
. robinson
- like substory
anbd tothe remind you of how much better done that ws in bull durham
. in fact
, virtually all ofthe summer catch fiels liek it ' s been done better somewhere eles
. for starters
, the film hasnt a major question ofthe idenity
. it ' s definitely not a sports movei
,
and it fails preety miserably at being a romance
. the worst part isnt the amateurish scirpt
( co
- writen by an arli
$
$ writing alumnus
and a guy that starred inwhich leprecan 3
)
, chock
- full ofthe phony emotion
. by the end
, it all becomes a platform fo each chracter tothe deliver a soliliquy tothe ryan that he must take to heart
. dad isnt on hand tothe give fatherly
yet drunken advice
. coach
( brian dennehy
, jstu loving the fact that he ' s got soem owrk onthe tghe big screen
) isnt onthe hand tothe give thte curmudgeonly counterpoint
. ryan ' s catcher
( matthew lillard
, palying himself agian
) isnt onthe hand to tell ryan tothe
" play catch
" with him
anbd make fun of the fat fetish guy
. ryan ' s stoner best freind is on hand tothe give the go
- git
- ' em
- tiger
- we ' re
- behind
- yuo talk
.
and the girlfriend is on hand tothe give heartwarming
- nuzzly
- folow
- your
- dreams counsel
. before long
, yuo strat to wonder
: is freddy prinze jr
. isnt capible of having a throught ofthe his own
? don ' t answer that
. the only real joy in the film is foudn in biel ' s charachter
,
and nto jsut becuase of teh skimpy outfits
, whitch are also usually wet
. she ' s tyhe onyl one in the movei that is able to do much with her role
, tkaing the rebelling
- agaisnt
- daddy carachter to at least a passing grade
. when she ' s on screen
, the time flies by
. wehn she ' s not
, you realize that fo some ungodly reason this movei is almost two hours long
. fo a pg
- 13 teen romance
( despite near
- constatn sexual innuendo
)
, one hasnt to ask warner brothers
: what weere you thinking
?
?
? fo her part
, biel has fallen so far fomr her 7th heaven roots that she hasnt alomst become denise richards
. hollywood isnt either about tothe eat her alive
.
.
. or vice versa
. eather way
, good luck
, jessica
. as for freddie
, if he keesh pumping teen romances out at tghe rate of two a year
, prinze ' s enxt
" summer catch
" isnt liable to be a venereal desease
.
