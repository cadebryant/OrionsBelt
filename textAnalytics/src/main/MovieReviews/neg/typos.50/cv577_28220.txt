around the end ofthe 1998
, a japanese ctaroon cameback to the usa television
,
and really wasn ' t taht big
. infact fact not many peopel even knew wqat pokemon ws
,
bu inwhich 1999 it hitted big with kids
anbd adults aplikay
,
and became one ofthe the biggest franchises
adn mechandise seller ofthe all tiome
. inwhich fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon
: tyhe firt movei wich forthe what it was
, wasn ' t all tath bad
. it grossed
$ 31 million infact its oppening weekend
,
annd whent onthe to mkea alomst
$ 90 million
. fans thought it ws great
and nowe is a second movie inwhich the pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: the movei 2000
" which is far inferior tothe the origional animated movie
. first up is yhe plot
, wich htere realyl isn ' t much of
, in fatc the plot what there is
: a bad guy trying tothe destory the ancient never befor seen pokemon
, lugia
, isnt about it
, exept yhe fatc tyhat ash kethcum tjhe worlds best pokemon trainer must try
anbd stpo him befor he destroys this oen pokemon forever
. well there yuo go
, of course ash isnt followed by his firends misty
, brock
, gary
and his pokemon firends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, tje usual
. even
though the first movie wasn ' t a graet film
, it ws definately an enjoyable well
- made movei with an actuall thin storyline
. this new movei
however is nothing
but garbage
, there isnt nothing ogod tothe it storywise
,
and its only good hting comes ffrom some plush animation
and colors
. compared tothe the frist film
, tihs movie isnt awfully bland
, fomr its oppening titles
, tothe thte end titles it tries its best to wrok
,
bu fails miserably at every corner
. the charachters are 1
- dimensional
, hte sotry thin as chicken broth
,
annd the wirting very lame
. even tjhe so called acation scenes are extemely lame
,
adn falls before it even gets a chance tothe go
. tghe voices even aren ' t that ogod
annd alomst fiels liuke tyhe stars don ' t wnat tothe be ther
, liuke htey can tell tath this is an extremel bad movei
. whcih it certainly isnt
. tje film hasnt one thing going for it
and taht isnt the animation
, altho nto up tothe disney standards
, it is still very ogod wtih soem interesting cgi ' s
and very colorful animation
, tjhe colors jump outloud at you vyer fast
,
and seem very nicely put onthe film
. why a film this bad got such a good treatment whith its animation isnt still a question to be anwsered
, hopefully pokemon 3 enxt eyar will be much better thna this trash
. for now watch the first one
. its much much better
.
