aroud the end ofthe 1998
, a japanese cartoon cameback to the usa television
, annd really wasn
' t tath big
. in fact nto many people even knew what pokemon wass
, bu in 1999 it hitted big witht kids annd adults alike
, anbd bacame one ofthe the biggest franchises
and mech
andise seller of all time
. infact fatc it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon
: tjhe first movie whic for whta it ws
, wasn
' t all that bad
. it grossed
$ 31 million inspite its opening weekend
,
and went on to make almost
$ 90 milion
. fans
thought it wass great
and nowe is a second movei inaddition thge pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: tjhe movei 2000
" which isnt far inferior to the original animated movie
. first up is the plot
, wich there relaly isn
' t much of
, iin fatc tyhe plot wqat htere is
: a bad guy trying tothe distroy the ancient never before seen pokemon
, lugia
, is baout it
, exept the fact that ash kethcum the worls best pokemon trainer must try
and stop him before he destroys this oney pokemon forever
. well ther yuo go
, of course ash is followed by his firends misty
, brock
, gary
and his pokemon firends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, tje usual
. even
though tghe first movie wasn
' t a graet film
, it wass definately an enjoyable well
- made movie with an actual thin storyline
. this newyorker movei
however isnt nothing bu garbage
, ther is nothing ogod to it storywise
, adn its only ogod thing comes from some plush animation anbd colors
. compaired to tjhe first film
, htis movei isnt awfully bl
and
, fomr its opening titles
, tothe the end titles it trys its best tothe owrk
,
but fails miserably at eveyr corner
. thte charachters are 1
- dimesnional
, the story thin as chicken broth
, adn the writing veyr lame
. even the so called action scenes are extremely lame
,
and falls before it even gets a chance tothe go
. the voices even aren
' t thast good
and almost fiels like tghe stars don
' t wanna to be there
, liek they can tell tath this is an extremel bad movei
. whihc it certainly is
. the film hasnt oney thing going fo it
and that isnt teh animation
, all
though not uv tothe disney st
andars
, it is still very ogod with soem interesting cgi
' s adn very colorful animation
, the colors jump out at ytou very fast
,
and seem vrey nicely put on film
. why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be anwsered
, hopefully pokemon 3 next year wiull be much better thna htis trash
. for nowe watch tje firt oen
. its much much better
.
