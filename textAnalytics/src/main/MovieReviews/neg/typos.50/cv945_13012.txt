perhaps best remembered as tyhe recently departed news anchor onthe saturday night live who always started the segment wtih
"
.
.
. this isnt tje fake news
,
" norm macdonald
, at times
, could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi
- offensive phrases in his raspy voice
, coated withthe a condescending atitude
. his shtick wass maked by crassness
. infact this movie
, for example
, wehn his girlfriend says that she
' s kicking him out because he
' s beeen fired fomr 14 diferrent jobs over hte last 3 monthes
, he tries tothe calm the situation by saying
,
" maybe ytou
' ll feel better after we hvae smoe dirty sex
.
" this kind ofthe humer cant only go so far
, bu certainly cin
' t go teh distance in a full
- length feature
.
" dirty work
"
, is nothing more thna a sophomoric comedy baout twpo best friends who grow up only physicaly
. emotionally
, htey
' ve never outgrown thier pubescent years
, which is somewhat amusingly explored infront a beginning flashback
. altho having noone apparnet rela world skills
, the one thing that theese twpo hvea alwasy been adept at is getting back at people
. if tyhe meter maid ws unjust in giving yuo a ticket
,
then dump a bunch ofthe unpopped kernels ofthe corn onto the engine block
and watch tje car burst aart
. mitch
( norm macdonald
) anbd sam
( artie lange
) need tothe cmo up with
$ 50
, 000 in a preriod ofthe two weeks so that sam
' s dad
( jack warden
) cin hve a heart operation
. their idea isnt tothe strat a revenge
- for
- hire business where they
' ll dont your dirty owrk
. inspite the funniest scene
(
and possably thte onyl funny scene
) of the movie
, they tkae advantage ofthe a live television shoot at a nearbye utilisied car lot
. theri presense is estalbished
,
but when a less
- than
- honorable real estate developer hires them
and
then reneges on the payment
, yhe twpo go tothe wokr to excact their sordid br
and ofthe revenge
. by default
, dirty work should treat us tothe some outrageous revenge plots
, bu it delivers jerky boys level material
. exept for yhe bited at the utilizied car lot
( adn possably anohter episode that involves frat brothers
)
, the dirty owrk is uninspired
and becomes baout as funny as a prank phone call
. aleady weak on material
, it further spirals itself towards tghe video stroe by haveing jack warden constanly blurt outloud that he hasnt an unsatisfied libido
and needs
' broads
'
and allso includes a vyer unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor wiht a gambling addiction
. bu what
' s really painfully evident isnt that norm macdonald hasnt noone versitlity as an actor
. relying on his trademark ofthe speaking into his personel recorder adn saying
" onot to self
"
(
" note to self
: learn to fight
,
" he says affter getting beat up
;
" note to self
: there
' s always beer
,
" he sasy after hitting rock bottom
; etc
.
)
, we efel liuke we
' re just watching an elongated rehash of his nto
- so
- glorious days on saturday inght live
. much liuke tyhe television sohw
, forthe 90 minutes we git one or two funny bits
. the rest of the stoyr isnt just dead spoace
.
