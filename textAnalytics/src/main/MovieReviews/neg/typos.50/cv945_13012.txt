perheaps best remembered as thge recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who allways started the segment with
"
.
.
. tihs is hte fake news
,
" norm macdonald
, at times
, could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi
- offensive phrases infact his raspy voice
, coated with a condescending attitude
. his shtick wass marked by crassness
. in this movie
, forthe example
, when his girlfriend syas that she ' s kicking him out becasue he ' s beeen fired from 14 different jobs over hte lastest 3 months
, he trys tothe calm hte situation by saying
,
" maybe yuo ' ll feel better affter we have some dirty sex
.
" thsi kind of humor can only go so far
,
but certainly cant ' t go the distance inaddition a full
- lenght feature
.
" dirty work
"
, isnt nothing omre tahn a sophomoric comedy baout two best friends who grow uv only physically
. emotionally
, tehy ' ve never outgrown thier pubescent yeasr
, whlch is somewhat amusingly explored iin a beginnig flashback
.
although haveing noone apparen real world skills
, hte oen thnig tyhat theese two hvae always been adept at is getting back at peopel
. if the meter maid wass unjust iin giving ytou a ticket
,
then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto thte engine block
and watch the car burst aart
. mitch
( norm macdonald
)
anbd sam
( artie lange
) ened tothe come uv witht
$ 50
, 000 in a perido of twpo weeks so tath sam ' s dad
( jack warden
) can hvae a heart opperation
. theri idea isnt tothe strat a revenge
- for
- hire buisness where they ' ll dont your dirty owrk
. inthe hte funniest scene
(
annd possably the only funny scene
) of tyhe movie
, they tkae advantage of a live televsion shoot at a nearby unsed car lot
. their presence isnt estalbished
,
bu when a less
- than
- honarable real estate developer hires them
anbd
thne reneges on yhe payment
, the twpo go tothe wokr to excact their sordid brand ofthe revenge
. by default
, dirty work shoud treat us to some outrageous revenge plots
,
but it delivers jerky boys levle material
. except forthe the bited at the used car lot
(
annd possibly another epsiode that involves frat brothers
)
, the dirty owrk is uninspired
and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call
. already weak onthe material
, it furuther spirals itself towards thte video store by having jack warden constantly blurt outloud thgat he hasnt an unsatisfied libido
and needs ' broads '
adn alsot includes a vyer unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction
.
but what ' s raelly painfully evident is thta norm macdonald hasnt noone versatility as an actr
. relying onthe his trademark ofthe speaking inot his personal recorder
and saying
" onot to self
"
(
" onot tothe self
: leran tothe fight
,
" he syas after getting beated up
;
" note tothe self
: htere ' s alwyas beer
,
" he syas aftter hiting rock bottom
; etc
.
)
, we feel like we ' re jsut watching an elongated rehash ofthe his not
- so
- glorious days on saturday night live
. much liuke the television show
, forthe 90 mintues we get one or two funny bits
. teh rest of the story is just dead space
.
