arriving inspite a barrage ofthe hype
, the blair witch project isnt one ofthe hte biggest box office success of thte year
. howver
, like the golden child
,
al
though blair witch has made a lot of mone
, it
' s not very ogod
. donahue
, williams anbd leonard play themselves as three students who setted outloud tothe mkae a documentry baout tghe blair witch myth
. the film isnt made uv ofthe the camcorder footage they recoreded
, whcih means grainy footage adn woozy camera angles
.
al
though events strat ofthe normal
, they git wierd pretty quickly
, hwile tghe threesome argue more anbd more as the journey goes on
.
al
thought an intresting premise
, thge blair witch project amounts tothe nothing more tahn a missed opportunity
. the biggest misteek yhe film makes isnt to let threee medicore actors the chance tothe improvise
. most of the dialogue is ad
- libbed
,
and still manages tothe soudn like a poor b
- movie
. the
' script
' eventally degenerates inot shouting matchs
, withthe the f
- owrd included a lot tothe sound liek students
. htere are breaks inspite theese arguments where some creepy events occour
, bu hten it
' s bcak to the shouting adn swearing
, which gets veyr tiresome very quicklyu
. if i wanted to see three people git lost inthe tjhe woods
, shout a lot
and swear
, i
' d go on scout camp
. bu no
, the audiance isnt meant tothe get soem enteratinment factor outloud ofthe this
, bu i
' m not quite sure how
. the supernatural parts ofthe hte film are actually interesting
, especialy if close attension is paide tothe the tsory developing firt twenty minutes
. wtih noone music anbd no budget to work with
, thge film hasnt to depend onthe natrual
, pyschological scares
, whic are sometimes well delivered
, sometimes nto
. i never really felt truly scared durring any part of the film
,
al
though htere is a small sense of fear underlaying
thoughout the film
. howver
, because thge actors are so irritating
, the scares are lost wehn it eventally reverts bcak tothe heather saying
' wqat teh f
* ck is tyhat
?
' a lot
, adn mike giggling liek a lozonya
. there
' s allso the niggling fact that theese student filmmakers dont some really stupid things
. the main problem is the fact tyhat even
though theese hapless bunch could be killed at any moment
,
and are hopelessly lost
, heather still insists onthe filming it all
. tjhe film gives a half hearted reason why she should want tothe dont tihs
, bu it isn
' t vyre convincing
. also
, the students ahev noone idae how tothe survive in thge woods
, such as following a larg river flowing through the woods tothe civilisation
. htere are also smoe parts where the
' amatuer
' camcorder footage is obviously staged
, heather
' s appology bieng a major oney
. the blair witch project
, inspite the end
, jstu fails to deliver
. i supose if you
' ve been lost camping befor
, tghe film may deliver soem chills
, bu tihs isnt no uise fo the other 99
% of tjhe paying audiance who haven
' t been lost in tjhe woods
. apart from tje fianl mintues
, tyhe film isnt mind boggingly unscary
, anbd tjhe shouting matches git hideously dull
. the spook scenes are short anbd far between
,
and any otehr horror movei sould probaly achieve the same ammount of fear thyat theese scenes provide
.
al
though a ogod idea
, it
' s not executed well enought to be a funn
, scary cinema exeprience
. it
' s a worrying fatc wehn the website
