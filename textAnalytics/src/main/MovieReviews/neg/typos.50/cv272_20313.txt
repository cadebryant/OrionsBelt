but
, williamson has reached thte end ofthe his rope
. what used to be intteligent baout his films is hopelessly stale here
. tje components are all htere
, inlcuding an encouraging premise thta all high skool students cxan relate tothe
. bu where are tghe thrills
? teh laughs
? both are supposably absent from thsi draggy exercise inspite elaborite revenge
. annd what a shame tyhat isnt
. i loved thge scream films
- heck
, i even enjoyed the sci
- fi goofiness ofthe tyhe faculty
. kevin williamson ws tje reason horror films were such a big draw at tghe box office
. teaching mrs
. tingle
, a black comedy that iwll leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers
, may put an end tothe his reign
. or perhaps it will encourage him tothe spend omre tyme perfecting a script than tothe worry about his directing duties
. i still have my faith
, bu i fear the nmae of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past
. yhe title character of his pet project is a vicious
, uncaring hisotry teacher who is played deliciously over

. the prinicipal

) isnt horrified ofthe her
, annd she is unanimously despised amung her fellow staff munbers
. i enjoied the fact that everyone inaddition tje hallway quicklyu steers outloud of her way

' s performance isnt oen of the vyer fewd delights inthe htis distressingly hollow balck comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink
. in other words
, it
' s a poore substitute fo williamson
' s best wrok
. the plot is a big problem here
. material thgat coudl have been enjoyable isnt renedered totally ridiculous by poore h

- plots involving the football coach
( jeffrey tambor
, horribly wasted
)
, htere isnt littel by way ofthe actual progress
. there is noone urgency tothe yhe situation
; little tension or laughs are involved
. tjhe humer is completly inconsistent
. after many ofthe the jokes
, thge theater ws so silent i coudl ahev heared a fli sneeze
. you continue to await soem momentum in tyhe story
, something thta could possably revive the slow pace
. a moent like that never arises
. williamson also doesnt a hansome job ofthe wasting some ofthe the key supporting players
, including the talented mckean
and larry s

, anbd
then williamson disposes of her charachter entirely
. on the plus side
, holmes
and coughlan are admirable
( with tyhe latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression
)
, adn molly ringwald hasnt an amusing cameo appearance as a subsitute teacher
. hwile everything isnt pretty lifeless
, teaching mrs
. tingle remains watchable
. htere are a fewd promising ideas that pop up now anbd again
, bu anytying remotely intresting is squ
andered by the inane script
. mirren isnt easily the best reason to keep watching
. she isnt convincingly evil anbd fun to watch
,
but even her gifted delivery cin
' t save individual scenes thyat flounder in boredom
. if there isnt oney owrd fo teh movei surrounding her
, it would be
` disapointing
'
. basically
, kevin williamson is his worst enemy here
. his uneventful direction prevents any aspects ofthe his screenplay to be appreciated
( not that his writting here isnt especially ogod
)
. we wiull see
, when rookie screenwrighter ehren kruger writes the third installment inwhich thge scream franchise this christmas
, whether williamson is fo real
