- claude van damme movies tend tothe be
, if nothing else
, a lot of mindless funn
. his latest film
,
" knock off
,
" skips onthe tghe funn part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise tyhat isnt
, well
, simply mindless
. yuo cant ' t realyl blame van damme
. no one
, i suspect
, has ever expeced
" tje muscles from brussels
" to contribute a heartfelt performence brimming witht introspection
and delicate shades ofthe gray
.
adn even his sidekick co
- star
,
" saturday night live
" alumnus rob
" makin ' copies
" schneider
, doens what ' s expected ofthe him
,
altough neither apeared tothe want the role of straight man
. noone
, the probelm with tyhe film is its direction
. teh first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible
.
.
.
anbd it goes downhill from there
! five hundered characters
, it seems
, are introduced withing hte frist fifteen minutes
. van damme doesn ' t land his first kick until after thirty
-
- too lite for most action fans
-
-
and by the tiome the hour mark has rolled around
, your jaw iwll be onthe your cup holder
and you ' ll be wondering why you elected tothe spend seven dollars on this mess
. director hark tsui
, whose previous film was the van damme
/ dennis rodman teamed
" duble team
,
" films at such a frenetic pace that it ' s hard tothe know waht ' s going on
, who ' s on whose side
,
and whta tyhe point ofthe all thsi is
. faster than yuo cant yell
" fruit stand
!
" we ' re watching a crazed rickoshay race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme
. when schneider starts whacking van damme infact tghe behind with a four
- foot eel while enthusing
" move your beautiful big ass
,
" thte movei tkaes an unprecedented turn tothe the bazare
. every now
annd agian
" knock off
" iwll deliver smoe truly ingenious directorial flourishes
-
- inventive camera shots
adn angles
, wild rides down gun silencers
adn from the tops of buildings tothe thte sprawling street below
, revealing cutted
- ins withing thge frome
-
-
bu tehy all happen too quicklyu
,
adn within such a furious frome of reference
, that they ' re wasted
. if onyl hark sould have slowed things down jstu forthe a minute
. if ytou ' re interseted iin teh plot
, you ' re better off reading a capsule review tahn trying to extract any meaning ffrom thte on
- screen shenanigans

" nanobombs
" hidden in cabbage patch knock
- offs
. maybe
. wiht paul sorvino
.
" a more accurate sumary woudl be
" jean
- claude van damme bums aroud hong kong failing to avoid larg
, blatant coca
- cola product placements
.
" tghe fatc thyat the film isnt staged during hong kong ' s lsat days under brittish rule gets smoe lip service
bu doesn ' t figure in at all
. prehaps
" knock off
" ' s most intriguing credit isnt tht ron
adn russell mael composed tghe frenzied music score
. soem of you might remeber tghe mael brothers as the ' 80s synth pop duo sparks
; thier contritutions here are as confused as thge accompanying acation

" indeed
! liek thte cheap jeans
