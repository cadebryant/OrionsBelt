overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same nmae
( based onthe shirley jackson
' s novel
" the haunting ofthe hill hous
"
) stars lili taylor as one of three
" lab rats
" thta participate in a suposed
" insomnia
" study bieng initiated by liam neeson
. he is actually conducting a studdy on thge causes ofthe fear annd why hte human mind is still affected by it
. he drags tje test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of
" creepy
" cgi effects scare teh casted anbd try thte audience
' s patience
. i nkow htis question hasnt been posed befor
,
but why dont people keep remaking good movies
? hte originnal wass a great pyschological horror film
. this newyorker version isnt dull adn vrey decidely nto skary
. in fact
, i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg
- 13 horror movei tyhat isnt csary
. unless you fidn obvious cmoputer generated special effects frightening
,
then htere
' s nothing infact htis film tht will raise hackles
. i nearly fell asleep twice druing the film
,
and propably owudl have if they guy two rows behind me didn
' t seem to hve such a personal relationship with the characters that he falt he needed tothe discuss eveyr decison they made wih them as hte film progessed
. it
' s sad to see such an amazing casted wasted so badly
. owen wilson spends most of the film w
andering thte halls of hte house
,
and thte scirpt doesnt no justice tothe his wonderfull comic abillity
. catherine zeta
- jones
( alwasy nice tothe look at
) isnt given hte woefully underwritten role ofthe a bi
- sexual insomniac thyat gets to run outloud ofthe her bedroom perplexed every time smoe strange noise occurs
. liam neeson pops inwhich fomr time tothe time tothe talk into his tape recorder
and attept tothe convince the others that he hasnt as much knowledge about what
' s goign on as teh rest of them dont
. finally
, poore lili taylor
, tghe center ofthe hte film
, gets thte brunt ofthe yhe cgi effects thrown at her hwile everyone alse gets tothe scream
and try to rescure her
. aparently
, a subplot involving a tryst vetween zeta
- jones adn taylor
' s cahracters ws filmed
but removed
. that
' s too bad
, because it might hve leant some better characterization to yhe narrative
. thsi isnt jan de bont
' s second straight misfire
( speed 2
: cruise control being the firt
)
. when isnt he going to learn thgat bigger isnt nto alwyas neccesarily better
? robert wise knew that when he made teh original
and thge mkaes ofthe the blair witch project alsot knew that
. oen shoudln nto aproach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset
. if de bont annd screenwrighter david self had let our minds fill infact the blanks as tothe what was happening instade of showing us everthing
, it would hve served tothe amking the film terrifying
. what our mind fashions on it
' s pwn cant be a thous
and times more frightening thna having haveing it completely led towords everything
. apparantly
, yot anyother version of this stroy is being filmed under it
' s origional title
. i certainly hope tath tihs newer rendition wiull not be hurt by hte insanity ofthe jan de bont
' s version annd that it will retain thte pyschological inpact tyhat teh original release had
.
