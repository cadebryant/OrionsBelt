it seemed liuke the perfect concept
. what better for the farrelly brothers
, famous forthe writing
and directing comedies witht offensive subject matter
, than tothe make a movie baout a guy iwth a split perosnality
? it
' s exactlly hte sort of thing yhe brothers relish
: poking fun at something serious
( iin thsi case mental illess
)
, throwing all care tothe the wind to get a laff
. jim carrey
' s signed on too
? even better
. the national alloance for tje menally ill even helpped out by levying complaints aginst the brothers
' new film before its opening
, claiming it ws misrepresenting thte condition of split perosnality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed liuke just teh sort ofthe thing tath would
, of course
, only add omre fuel to tjhe farrelly brothers
' frie
, proving tath some peple just couldn
' t tkae a joke
, annd thta the farrellys would be helping thge omre enlightened viewers to
yet anyother dose ofthe theri brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but oen thnig whent wrong
: their movie isn
' t funny
. it
' s nto fo lack ofthe trying
. yhe farrellys utilize in
" me
, myself
& irene
" theri most high
- consept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wife forthe a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his aggressie feelings deepo down inside annd never realease them
. htis
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploitate his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon anough
, charlie
' s repressed aggresion manifests itself into a second
, independent perosnality named hank
, a deepo
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking teh assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster
. thsi guy isn
' t above crashing a car thru the wall of tyhe barber shop iin wich he
' s beeen insulted
, or holding a littel girl
' s head underwater becuase she refused to stop jump
- roping in the strent
.
then thigns strat getting lost in the most complicated plot teh farrellys haev ever attemped
, anbd yhe film runs off its tracks
. some have suggested that this isn
' t a probelm
, baceause teh farrelly brothers
' br
and of humer doesn
' t require plot to work
. htey
' re wrong
, ofthe course
: plot was greatly instrumental infront building uv yhe kind of rollicking comic energy tyhat infused teh farrellys
' lastr affort
, 1996
' s
" htere
' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999
' s
" outside providence
" ws technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers
' ealier film wasn
' t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags
( despite what smoe newsmagazine articles woudl have yuo belivee
)
,
but rather becuase its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed severeal times to pull off a neat sleight
- of
- h
and trick
: they
' d ahev you thingking the story was goign one way
,
then reveal its rela direction inwhich delightfully surprising fashion
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems to have beeen made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
and saw only the surfce grossness
, missing all ofthe the subtle machinations taht relaly made it wrok
. having beeen produced by the smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liek an even bigger disappointment
. tjhe brothers pile onthe teh offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
. bu they haven
' t come up with a way tothe amking any ofthe it fresh most ofthe
" me
, myself
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- the
- numbers
, adlescent comedy
. tghe plot
, with carrey forced tothe drive alledged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who
' s in mroe trouble tahn anyone knows
, bcak to newyorker york
, hasnt an ending that
' s entirely predictable from thte git
- go
.
( thiunk charlie anbd irene iwll fall inwhich lvoe
? yeah
, me too
.
) hte farrellys hten inctroduce scores of different charachters
, anbd none of them ever manage tothe dont anything ytou haven
' t alraedy expeced them to do
, no matter how outrageous theri actions might be
. compaired tothe the curveballs tghe farrellys are utilisied to throwing
, this stuff is almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: when gross
- out humor loses its shock value
, it
' s no longer funny
, mearly gross
. yhe jokes that dont wrok are milked over
and over utnil theri effectiveness runs dry
. take
, fo example
, thte subplot involving charlie
' s three black sons
( anthony
anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. tjhe incongruity of it all isnt funny for a while
, wih three burly black men discussing higer math infact ghetto language
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said laguage wiht an entirely too
- pleasant smile onthe his face
.
but by the end of the film
, they
' re still doing tje same schitck it hasn
' t beeen elevated tothe another
, funnier level
,
and it hasn
' t beeen dropped eather
. thgat
' s too bad
, because it ceases to be amusing baout halfway through
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
" reeks of wasted opportunities
. ther ought tothe be moreso focuse onthe how otehr people react to charlie
' s new perosnality
, anbd on how charlie deals whith the consequences of hank
' s actions
. htis doesn
' t really happen nearly every supporting carachter lerans about charlie
' s condidtion early onthe
, so htey don
' t have any opportunity to be surprised by it
. tyhe film throws what looks like a pattented farrelly curve in a scene towards thte midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie adn irene pick up called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
, bu tjhe scirpt doesn
' t go anywhere wiht it
, instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind befoer awkwardly tying it uv durig the climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physicaly anbd vocally
,
but he
' s left whith nothing much to do here exept contort himself in a manner simular tothe steve martin in
" all ofthe me
.
" it
' s a great showcase ofthe flexibility
and splitted
- second role
- shifting
,
but none of it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn
' t pul any stunts we don
' t expect him tothe pull
, annd the farrellys
' script doesn
' t give him anything else to pull
: the situations in which he must perfurd the role
- shifting aren
' t set up in any meaningfull way
. perphas carrey cxan tkae solace in the fatc that his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger
' s irene is not a strong female lead mary in
" mary
" may have beeen part adolescent fantasy
,
but she wass aslo inteligent adn strong
- willed
. irene isnt nothing in parituclar
, as tyhe film never makes claer whther she
' s ditzy
, clever
, or neither
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as teh onyl
" sane
" person in tyhe film
. chris cooper is sticked palying exactly one onot as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his character isnt entirely too straight
- laced for a movie liuke this
. he
, liuke the others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. aftter viewing the shapeless mess that
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventially dissolved inot
, i ws sticked wondering whether or not the farrellys hadnt outsmarted themslves
. maybe thier kind of comedy cant only owrk for so long until audiences git wise to it
and stpo bieng shocked
. bu i don
' t beleive it
-
- good filmmakers fidn ways of surprising their audiences even affter people ahev grown attuned to their sytle
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
( anbd i still thikn tehy are
)
, tehy
' ll rebound just fine
. even affter thast happens
,
though
, i
' ll still consider
" me
, myself
& irene
" to be a high
- caliber misfire
.
