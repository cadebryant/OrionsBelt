midway through
" anaconda
"
, documenatry filmmaker terri flores
( jennifer lopez
) turns to a co
- worker annd says
" i
thought this movei would be my frist big break
. instead
, it
' s turned inot a diaster
.
" truer words have never been spoken
.
" anaconda
" isnt a monster movie with a lousy monster
. it
' s a suspense film thgat is utterly predicatble
. it
' s a mess tjhe film does manage to drum up some scares
, bu only in the most elementay way
, like a jack
- infront
- hte
- box
. as you turn the crank
, ytou
' re totally aware that tje damn clown isnt going tothe pop uv
, bu somehow it
' s still mildly startling when it happens
. the main diference betweeen thte giant snake in
" anaconda
"
and tyhe clown infront a jack
- in
- teh
- box isnt that thge clown is mroe realsitic
.
" anaconda
" boasts smoe of hte worst speical effects to appear onscreen inaddition years
. animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of thsoe cringe
- inducing robots ytou
' ve endured at disney world
.
but it
' s the computer animated scenes tht truley exp
and tyhe meaning of thge owrd lame
. infront one shooted
, a charachter trys to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall
, bu tje giant snake springs outloud
and loops around its hapless victim in mid air
. the scene
, if done well
, woudl ahev been a jaw
- dropper
. here
, the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saterday morning ctaroon
. wqat
' s raelly amazing is thgat tghe filmmaker
' s were so proud of this dreadful shooted thgat they ctually included it iin tghe promotional trailers fo the movei
.
but enought about tyhe phony snakes
. now it
' s timne tothe talk about tje lousy tsory
. heroic
and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentery film crew down a brazilian river infact search ofthe tjhe shirishama indians
, a legendary tribe tht supposedly lives in thte boondocks ofthe the rain forest
. stoltz tells his crew
" pray that ytou didn
' t forget your bug spray
.
" aparently the female crew members bathed in tjhe stuff
, becuase htey spend most ofthe the film wearing skimpy tops
and short shorts with no ill effect
. allong yhe way
, the gropu rescues a whacked
- outloud lapsed priest
( jon voight
) who claimes tothe nkow how to find yhe shirishama
. withing mintues
, they throw awya all their plans
and folow voight down a tri
butary into tghe l
and of creepiness
. fomr thast point on
, the film isnt a hodgepodge ofthe scenes
and shots ripped off ffrom
" jaws
"
and
" dead calm
.
" oen of the oddest structual points ofthe the film isnt the h
andling of eric stoltz
. early in the stroy
, his charachter gets knocked inot a coma by a river insect
and spends virtually tyhe rest of the movie unconscious
. so why doed they hire an actr of thte caliber of stoltz for what amounts tothe a cameo appearance
? alsot
, why doed stoltz
, who generaly selects his roles whith great care
, agre to apeared iin htis crap
? ah
, teh mysteries of hollywood
. thge remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen
. jonathan hyde isnt mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate tghe documentary
,
but lopez
and ice cube manage tothe ries above their cardboard characters
. lopez
, who starred inthe
" selena
,
" is an enourmously appealling performer
, possesing a vibrancy thta makse even hte most trite lines seem credible
. ice cube has a special charizma
; an abilty tothe look like a macho adult
and a frightened boy simultanously
. htere
' s alsot a special twinkle inwhich his eyes
, as if he
' s gently mocking his own tough
- guy posturing
. bu the movie really centers arund tjhe outrageously hammy performance ofthe jon voight
. obsessed with capturing oen ofthe the giant anacondas
, voight plays teh villian inspite thick accent
, iwth a sories of leers adn hisses
, spouting yhe kind ofthe dialogue ususally heared onyl inaddition epidsodes of
" jonny quest
.
" at one point
, he looms over teh crew
and sasy
" teh anaconda isnt the perfect killing machine
. it strikes
, wraps aroud yuo
, holds ytou tighter than your true lveo
. anbd you get the privilge of hearing your bones break befoer the power ofthe its embrace causes your veins tothe explode
.
" thta moment is so high
- camp tht it allmost made the film tolerable
. almost
. fans ofthe tje horror genre may be tempted tothe check outloud
" anaconda
.
" don
' t
. htere are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer
, inlcuding another
" aline
" sequal
. wait for them
, rent
" jaws
" inwhich the meantime
, anbd don
' t throw awya your omney
and time onthe drivel liek thsi
