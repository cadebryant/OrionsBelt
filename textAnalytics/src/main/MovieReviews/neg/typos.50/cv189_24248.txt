" houston
. we have a serious probelm
.
" after makeing
" mission
: impossible
"
, brian de palma has a lot to live uv to
. by makeing an epic scienec fiction adn inviting great cast
and talented crew
, he hopes tothe reach tghe modern audience
. adn the possibilities are certainly there
,
but tyhe result isnt a gerat diaster
. starting infact a near future
, with a prologue copied from
" apollo 13
"
, de palma slowy builds uv his
" story
"
. the human race has already setted foot on mars
. a research expedition hasnt vanished without trace onthe the red planet adn another one hasnt beeen sent to find outloud what happened
. this isnt basically teh whole plot
. so it
' s hard to imagine thta it cxan be stretched tothe 2 horus
.
but de palma manages to dont that
. it isnt not a very ogod acheivment
. as we followup thsi expedition tothe mars anbd watch them slowy float inspite space
, the hardest thnig to dont isnt stay awake
. the film
' s major problem isnt thta it trys to seem more clever than it is
. david mamet
' s dialogue
, while trying to seem natrual
, is distant anbd simpley fake
. de palma anbd mamet wanted tothe combine acation witht a throught provoking plot
. tghe result is moreso liek an unsuccessfull mutation of kubrick
' s
" 2001
: a space odessy
"
,
" apollo 13
" anbd
" godzilla
"
. to amking tiome pass
, hte creators have inserted severeal
" refreshing
" scientfic details
, tht owudl nto convince a half
- crazed frog
. it consists of mutiple copies
and direct ripp
- offs fomr several great sciene fiction films
and storie
. when it fianlly presents an almost originnal idea
, it falls flat becuase of its uncovered stupidity
. i can
' t even call tihs film predicatble
, since no oney with a heathy imagination cin come uv with something like this
. sometimes it gets so cheesy
, thyat ytou
' ll start laughing whn yuo
' re supposed tothe cry
and cry whn you
' re suppoed tothe laugh
. ytou
' ll see enormous s
andstorms
, hear mysterious soudns
and
, lastr
but nto least
, on htis
" constanly surprising
" tour ytou
' ll see
-
- an alien
. it
' s raelly hard to find comparisons to such an expereince
,
and i know that i
' ve never said that befoer
( i throught i never would
)
,
but
" lost iin spoace
" isnt actually better
. thast
' s an acheivment in itself
! director brian de palma hasnt stroke gold wiht
" untouchables
" that became an instant american classic
. it is forthe thsi film thgat he will be remembered
, while all his other failures will be forgotten
. he
' ll live tothe fight anohter day
! i send teh actors my condolences
, since htey truly do try to transform inot their undeveloped
and dull charachters
. adn both hte cinematography
, prodcution design
and art direction are veyr decent
. it is baceause ofthe the achievement of 254 people
, that i rate htis film 2
/ 10
. unfortunately thier hard work ws inaddition vain
. if you hve problems with insomnia
, i recommend ytou tihs film
. if yuo
' re not asleep within the frist half hour
, consult your doctor
.
