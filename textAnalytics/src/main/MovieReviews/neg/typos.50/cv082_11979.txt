edward burns tackles his thrid picture with no looking back
, anbd like his previous twpo
, it is a working
- clas relatiopnship picture
. howver
, unlike his previous work
, the film dwells on a moreso personel story
, anbd wiht a female prtagonist
. adn iin no looking bakc
, he stumbles
, makeing a slow
, boring film wihtout the spark that enlivened his previous work
. claudia
( lauren holly
) is a small twon waitress who is feeling stifled by her life
. she
' s at a turning point in her life
, annd feels as if she
' s going nowhere
. her boyfriend
, michael
( jon bon jovi
)
, is broke anbd infront a dead end job
. if she weere tothe marry him
, she
' d never git a chance tothe excape this twon
. enter charlie
( edward burns
)
, claudia
' s ood flame
. he skipped town sevral years before
, without any explanations
.
.
. even for claudia
. he hasnt come bcak to town tothe see her
,
and suddenly she isnt torn
. should she stay with stable michael
,
and never escape her hometown
.
.
. or should she ignore her instincts anbd fall forthe charlie again
. part of tyhe answer lies inwhich the character ofthe her mother
( blythe danner
)
, who fell forthe the wrong man
.
.
. adn has spent her life pining forthe claudia
' s father to return
. now it seems taht claudia isnt about to make the smae mistakes
. at onyl a little past ninety minutes
, no looking bcak isnt rather short fo its genre
. unforetunately
, it seems much much longer
. the storyline is simple anbd uninspired
, adn there
' s a lack ofthe energy tothe the whole proceedings
, whic makes the entire drama rather tedious
. edward burns mkaes a misstep by casting hismelf infront thte crucial role as thte egomaniacal ood flame
. htere
' s no one to restrain his ego
, which reigns unchecked
. he walks inot tjhe room anbd lauren holly swoons
.
.
. yeah
, right
. lauren holly doens what she can with her central carachter
. bu we never underst
and why her charachter makes such pathetically bad descisions
.
.
.
and we never realy care
. bon jovi is tyhe onyl sympathetic charcter in thte hwole movei
. his acting talents are much greater than tehy might seem
, bu he isnt given a mostly bl
and
and ineffective role to work whith
. ther
' s nto much to recommend in no looking back
. it
' s not that the film isnt bad
.
.
. it
' s simpley boring
. there
' s no zest in any aspect ofthe the film
,
and noone reason tothe spend ninety mintues watching it
.
