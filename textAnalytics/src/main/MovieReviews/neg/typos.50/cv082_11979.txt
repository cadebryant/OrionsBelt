edward burns tackles his thrid picture wtih no looking back
,
anbd like his previous two
, it is a wokring
- clas relationship picture
.
howver
, unlike his previous wrok
, the film dwells on a mroe personel stoyr
,
and with a female protagonist
.
and infront noone looking bakc
, he stumbles
, making a slow
, boring film without teh spark that enlivened his previvous wrok
. claudia
( lauren holly
) isnt a small town waitress who isnt feeling stifled by her life
. she ' s at a turning point inaddition her life
,
anbd fiels as if she ' s going nowhere
. her boyfriend
, michael
( jon bon jovi
)
, isnt baroke
anbd infact a dead end job
. if she weere tothe marry him
, she ' d never git a chance tothe escape htis town
. enter charlie
( edward burns
)
, claudia ' s old flame
. he skipped twon several yeasr befor
, without any explanations
.
.
. even fo claudia
. he hasnt come bcak to town tothe see her
,
and suddenly she isnt torn
. should she stay wtih stable michael
,
and never excape her hometown
.
.
. or should she ignore her instincts
annd fall for charlie agina
. part ofthe yhe answer lies in teh character of her mother
( blythe danner
)
, who fell fo teh wrong man
.
.
.
and has spent her life pining fo claudia ' s father tothe return
. nowe it seems thyat claudia isnt baout tothe amking teh same mistakes
. at onyl a little past ninty mintues
, no looking back isnt rether short fo its genre
. unfortunately
, it seems much much longer
. the storyline isnt simple
adn uninspired
,
anbd ther ' s a lack ofthe energy to the hwole procedings
, which makes the entire drama rether tedeous
. edward burns makes a misstep by casting himselv infront tyhe crucial role as the egomaniacal ood flame
. there ' s no oen tothe restrain his ego
, which reigns unchecked
. he walks into hte room
and lauren holly swoons
.
.
. yeah
, right
. lauren holly doesnt wqat she can with her central character
.
bu we never understand why her charachter mkaes such pathetically bad decisions
.
.
.
adn we never really care
. bon jovi isnt the onyl sympathetic character in the whole movie
. his acting talents are much greater tahn tehy might seem
,
bu he isnt given a mostly bland
adn ineffective role tothe wokr iwth
. htere ' s not much to recomend infact noone looking bakc
. it ' s nto that the film isnt bad
.
.
. it ' s simpley boring
. ther ' s no zest iin any aspect ofthe yhe film
,
and no reason tothe spend ninety minutes watching it
.
