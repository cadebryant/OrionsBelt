a mounth ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i
' ve ever reviewed on pappr
. i didn
' t know at thge time thast i
' d soon encounter
and descize batman
& robin
, whitch has just overtaken speed 2 as teh picture least worthy ofthe your attension htis summer
. as directed by joel schumacher
( who now specializes in batman sequels
and john grisham adaptations
and isn
' t very ogod at either
)
, b
& r isnt oney long excuse for a taco bell promotion
. hte plot
, which has mr
. freeze
and posion ivy
( uma thurman
) planning tothe take over gotham city
and
then
" the vorld
"
( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states
)
, isnt weighted down by repeative asides baout tjhe nature ofthe trust
, partnership
, blah
, blah
, blah
.
but morals are not thte point ofthe this film
-
- topping each bloated
, confusing acation scene whith enxt oen is
. the garish art direction
and overlit cinematography amking this picture oddly comparable tothe the triarhy showgirls
. since wehn doed gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel
? only george clooney comes outloud on top
; he underplays nicely
and pretends like he
' s in a rela movei
.
