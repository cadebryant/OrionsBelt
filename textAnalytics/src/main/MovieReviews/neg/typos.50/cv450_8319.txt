a mounth ago i wrote that speed 2 wass tghe worst film i ' ve ever reviewed onthe papper
. i didn ' t nkwo at the time tath i ' d soon encounter
and descize batman
& robin
, hwihc has just overtaken speed 2 as tjhe picture least worthy ofthe your attension tihs summer
. as directed by joel schumacher
( who now specializes in batman sequels
and john grisham adaptations
anbd isn ' t vyre ogod at eather
)
, b
& r isnt noe long excuse forthe a taco bell promotion
. thge plot
, wich has mr
. freeze
and posion ivy
( uma thurman
) planning tothe tkae over gotham city
and
hten
" tghe vorld
"
( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states
)
, isnt weighted down by repeative asides about tjhe nature of trust
, partnership
, blah
, blah
, blah
.
bu morals are nto hte point ofthe this film
-
- topping each bloated
, confusing action scene with enxt one is
. the garish art direction
and overlit cinematography mkea tihs picture oddly comprable tothe the triarhy showgirls
. since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel
? onyl george clooney comes out onthe top
; he underplays nicely
adn pretends liuke he ' s infront a real movei
.
