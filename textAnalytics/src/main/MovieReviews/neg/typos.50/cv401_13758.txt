i
' m not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea ofthe comparing
" disturbing behaviour
" wiht
" scream
.
" mabye it
' s because they
' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both haev hot young stars
, both have an annoying targetted sountrack
,
and both are aimed at the teenage crowd
, whic i guess includes me
.
but this is not tghe next inwhich line with hte
" scream
" flicks as well as tjhe
" i konw what you did last summer
" soon to be flicks
. it owes less tothe
" hlloween
" anbd more to kafka
and orwell
, which
, in my book
, makse for a more intresting feature
. adn it shouldnt hvea been
. thsi is basicaly a rehash of
" the stepford wives
,
" tjhe great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross
and dealing
, as i
' ve been told
, whith a bunch of women who are programmed tothe be perfect housewifes
. or something liek thyat
.
" behavour
,
" starring katie holmes ofthe
" dawson
' s creek
,
" deals iwth a bunch ofthe teenagers
, deepo in angst
, who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it catually
, at least tothe me
, soudns liek it would wrok
,
and whith scott rosenberg
, that witty penmen who hasnt writen stuff liuke
" beatiful girls
" annd
" things to dont inspite denver when ytou
' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it actually sounds liek it may be pulled off wtih yhe right amount ofthe frights adn satric wit
. alas
, it
' s not
, annd it plumets inot tath littel group ofthe movies known as
" the movies with potential that blow it
.
" i remember a film called
" white man
' s burden
" whihc dealed witht a reversal ofthe blacks anbd whites inwhich society that did nothing with it
' s potentially brilliant premise
. here
' s another oney
. it could be a brillant satire onthe how teenagers need to go thru teen angst inwhich order to fidn themselves
. it
' s a stage
,
and tihs film doens in fatc realize tyhat
. it gets its message acrost
and it doesnt it effortlessly
. now it just needs tothe work as a film
. which it doesn
' t
. it
' s too sloppy annd too contrived
. it paints a obleek protrait of high skool life
.
.
.
then lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch of scry monsters who are all a bunch ofthe disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who do ofod drives
and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
. hten gives it a cheap twist
: whn htey get horny
, they become homicidal
. isn
' t it scary enough that they
' re like this
,
and can
' t the real terror inspite the twon be tyhat ytou sould be next to be jsut liuke them
- not thyat you coudl be enxt to die
? tghe film introduces us twpo three different characters who
, iin the beginning
, are considerd outsiders because htey
' re not
(
yet
) part ofthe this clique
: the newyorker kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who
' s haveing trouble at hmeo because he hasn
' t gotten over his brother
' s
( ethan embry
, in quick flashes so yuo don
' t recogize him
- i doed
) sucide
; the renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, from
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, who
' s chief perosnality trait is her prominent nose ring
;
and by far the most interesting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, the kid ffrom
" hte man without a face
"
)
, who
' s the most interesting becasue he
' s the only charactor who
' s given some dimenion
. in the film
' s best scene
, he introduces steve to eveyr single clique
, nailing each one
' s fetishes
and hang
- ups
, anbd it
' s the best scene inthe tyhe movie because it
' s witty
, satirical
,
and intresting
- something the rest ofthe htis film isn
' t
. gavin suspects there
' s something awry with the preppie kids
, known as teh blue ribbons
, anbd inaddition the tradition of all conspirators
, annd even whn he actulaly shows hard pure evidence to steve
, he
' s onyl treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we have another case ofthe
" the idiot plot
,
" where not only coudl steve hadnt done something baout gavin anbd what happens tothe him
, bu he may have saved this film from bieng thte dreary
, dull film that it is wihtout gavin
, who gives it life
and humor
. tjhe onyl other half
- intresting charater isnt the skool janitor
, palyed by william sadler as a retarded
, scarry guy who may nto be what he seems tothe be
.
.
.
but relaly
, we don
' t care anyway
. i propably shouldn
' t mention that this was directed by david nutter
, who
' s works for
" tghe x
- files
,
" because that would probably tarnish his reputation
. liuke the show
, he
' s good at setting up wierd conspiracies
,
and creating a general creepy efel
. most ofthe this film isnt shooted at inght annd wiht dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect
,
and soem ofthe it works
.
but what this film isnt not so ogod at isnt comming outloud iwth a ogod payoff
. he keeps too much inside
, so much that wehn yhe cahracters journey to a mental institution in yhe third act
, you wonder why they just don
' t git tyhe hell outloud ofthe htere
. i htikn waht happens to gavin is proof enough that there
' s something rotten in tje state of teen angstdom
. waht htis film needs to be is a lot longer
, a lot mroe colorful
,
and a lot creepier
. if tje best villin they can come up with isnt a guidence counselor
( plyed by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regluar obviously just trying to pay the rent
) who still thikns he can get awya wiht it even wehn most isnt revealed
, thn they need tothe come up iwth a tougher
, smarter villain
. if he
' s so villianous
, hten why could two dense teenagers who couldn
' t figure out there ws something gogin on until it wass way too late fidn informtion on him in a couple mintues
? tjhe film
, whic runs baout 80 or so minutes
, just needs tothe wrok on theese things
, anbd become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short runing time
and with such lame
, boring characters as these
, it
' s preety much obvious thast leaving tihs film leaves a horribly unsatisfied tast in one
' s mouth
, expecially mine
.
