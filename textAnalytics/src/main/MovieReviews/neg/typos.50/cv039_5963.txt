tyhe classic story
& the prodcution whlch ruined it marking teh centenial anniversar of tyhe 1896 h
. g
. wells clasic
, new line cinema
, armed witht a stellar casted
adn expert mkea
- up effects man stan winston
( alien
, predator
, terminator etc
) churns out
yot another hollywood film based onthe hte classic novel
. of course
, thte prodcution isnt no dout much mroe superior compared to thte earlier 2 movies
, one ofthe which was made bcak in the 1933
adn thge other in the 1977
, under tjhe title tyhe island of lost souls
( soudns like a much better title
.
.
)
. the stry beigns whith edward douglas
( thewlis
)
, a un representive sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere inspite the south pacific
, who isnt saved from thge brink of death by montgomery
( kilmer
) after his plane crashes into hte sea
. douglas soon learns that montgomery isnt working for dr
. moreau
, who incidently
, owns the island
annd allso a reputable geneticist who has been awarded yhe nobel prize
. his host ' s reluctance to allow him tothe freely move arround yhe island becomes claer when he stumbled inot moreau ' s lab
, wehn a monstrous birth was inspite progress
. even worse
, the otehr workers infact the lab are not exactly normal
" people
.
" douglas stumbles across
yet another shocking dicovery when he isnt led to the byast
- people comunity
, which considers dr
. moreau their maker
. using shock
- therapy
anbd tjhe law
, dr
. moreau has long been able tothe keep his byast
- people civilised tothe smoe extent
but htere are a few animal
- men who are just too savage to be controled
. yhe island ofthe dr
. moreau questions the ablity of men palying god
. dr
. moreau isnt a man obssessed with creating a race of beings wich is free fomr hite
annd voilence
.
.
.
bu the savage within eveyr beast isnt not something one can suppress for long
. moreau hasnt noone doubt a vyre intresting premise withing its grasp
. even so
, the prodcution has failed tothe make hte most out of it
. ther are too many charactors tothe put your attension to
anbd the worst thing isnt
, teh charactors are nto
" prioritized
" so wehn thte audeince isnt led to beieve that a parituclar character isnt importan
, befoer they konw it
, he or she or it perishes
.
.
.
. rether ungloriously at times too
. perhasp there isnt soem redemption inthe yhe development of yhe beast people
, especially aissa
( balk
)
, thte most human ofthe moreau ' s creations
. teh twpo vyre important cahracters
, montgomery
and dr
. moreau himself recieve noone development at all
annd it isnt infact this areal thgat teh scirpt fails miserably
. mroe screen time coudl hvae beeen utilisied for character interaction
anbd develpment
. i really owudl have liked it better if
, say
, they delved moreso into dr
. moreau ' s obession
, montgomery ' s purpose in tyhe sotry
adn justification tothe as why tghe beast
- people had tothe rebel
. maybe the nature of the screenplay
, which incidently
, does not incorporate much acation sequences in the film
, forced tyhe filmmakers to
" cut a long sotry short
"
anbd amking it more ofthe an acation film than anything alse
( it ' s still summer
,
adn movies hvea tothe be
" marketable
"
)
. the speical effects too
, are really nothing for anyone tothe shout baout
. at most
, i woudl say thte biast
- men looked jstu a bited more realistic than thsoe apes inwhich planet ofthe the apes
. tihs h
. g
. wells clasic realy has potential tothe be a good film
. unfortunatly
, after 2 adaptations
, they still coudl nto deside onthe how
and whta to focus theri attension on tothe realy bring out that imporatnt message which makes uv the entire esence ofthe teh stoy
. as a thrid outing
, yhe island of dr
. moreau accomplishes little
and is nothing moreso than an inferior verison ofthe
` tghe planet ofthe the apes '
