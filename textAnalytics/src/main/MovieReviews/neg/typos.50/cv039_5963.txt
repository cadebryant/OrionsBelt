the classic tsory
& yhe production wich ruined it marking hte centennial anniversary of tjhe 1896 h
. g
. wells classic
, newyorker line cinema
, armed with a stellar cast adn expert make
- uv effects man stan winston
( aline
, predator
, terminator etc
) churns out yot another hollywood film based on the clasic novel
. of course
, hte production isnt no dout much more superior compaired tothe thte earlier 2 movies
, one ofthe which wass made back in teh 1933 adn the other in the 1977
, under thge title the isl
and ofthe lost souls
( sounds liuke a much better title
.
.
)
. the sotry beigns with edward douglas
( thewlis
)
, a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somwhere in teh south pacific
, who isnt saved fomr the brink of death by montgomery
( kilmer
) aftter his plane crashes into the sea
. douglas soon learns that montgomery is wokring forthe dr
. moreau
, who incidently
, owns the isl
and annd also a reputable geneticist who hasnt beeen awarded thge nobel prize
. his host
' s reluctance to allow him tothe freely move arround tje isl
and becomes clera when he stumbled into moreau
' s lab
, when a monstrous birth was inwhich progress
. even worse
, the otehr workers in the lab are nto exactlly normal
" peopel
.
" douglas stumbles across yot another shocking discovery wehn he is led to teh beast
- peple comunity
, whlch considers dr
. moreau their maker
. useing shock
- therapy anbd the law
, dr
. moreau has long been able to keep his beast
- peopel civilised to soem extent
but there are a fewd animal
- men who are jstu too savage to be contolled
. the isl
and ofthe dr
. moreau questions the abillity ofthe men palying god
. dr
. moreau is a man obsessed whith creating a race ofthe beings whlch is free from hite
and voilence
.
.
.
but thte savage within every byast is nto something oen cant surpress forthe long
. moreau hasnt noone doubt a veyr interesting premise within its grasp
. even so
, the prodcution has failed tothe amking the most outloud of it
. there are too many characters to put your attention to adn the worst thing isnt
, teh charachters are nto
" prioritized
" so whn thte audience isnt led tothe believe that a paticular carachter is importamt
, befor they know it
, he or she or it perishes
.
.
.
. rather ungloriously at times too
. perhpas there is some redemption in the development ofthe hte biast peopel
, especially aissa
( balk
)
, the most human of moreau
' s creations
. teh two veyr importan charactors
, montgomery adn dr
. moreau hismelf receive no development at all anbd it isnt inspite thsi areal thyat tje scirpt fails miserably
. more screen time coudl have beeen utilisied for character interaction adn developement
. i really would hvea liked it better if
, sday
, htey delved more inot dr
. moreau
' s obsession
, montgomery
' s purpose infact the sotry anbd justification tothe as why yhe byast
- peple hadnt tothe rebel
. maybe thge nature of thte screenplay
, which incidently
, doesnt nto incorporate much acation sequences infront the film
, forced teh filmmakers tothe
" cut a long storey short
"
and mkea it omre of an action film than anytying else
( it
' s still summer
, anbd movies hvae to be
" marketable
"
)
. the special effects too
, are raelly nothing fo anyone to shout about
. at most
, i would sday thte biast
- men looked just a bit mroe realsitic thna those apes in planet of thte apes
. htis h
. g
. wells clasic relaly hasnt potential tothe be a ogod film
. unfortunately
, after 2 adaptations
, tehy still could nto decide on how
and whta tothe foucs their attention onthe to realyl bring out taht importamt message which mkaes uv the entire essense of the story
. as a third outing
, teh isl
and of dr
. moreau accomplishes little
and isnt nothing mroe tahn an inferior verzion ofthe
` the planet ofthe thte apes
'
