" virus
" isnt a monster movie without a monster
. any movie withthe a hurdle thta larg to overcome hadnt better be pretty damn ogod otherwise
. sadly
,
" virus
" doesnt not deliver
, onthe any level
. the movie opens with the russian spoace staion mir about to transmit something
( we never fidn outloud whta
) to a big boat with lots ofthe satelites onthe it
. sudddenly
, a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through spoace
,
and winds up destroying mir adn using it tothe transmitt itself to tghe aforememtioned big boat
. cut tothe seven days later
, we meet donald sutherl
and anbd his b
and of seafaring vultures
. see
, they spend all their timne sailing arround looking for dead
- in
- the
- water ships to rescure
,
and thn collect thge reward money
. at least
, i
* think
* tyhat
' s whta they dont
. along withthe many otehr thigsn inthe yhe film
, theri reason forthe being outloud inthe thte middle ofthe hte ocean isn
' t raelly explained
. so
, tehy stumble upon this big boat whith lots of satelites onthe it
, adn decide tothe haul it bakc tothe russian waters
. tyhe onyl problem is
, teh crew starts dissapearing noe
- by
- one annd turning inot borg
. yes
, borg
. complet with yhe red lazer beam in place ofthe an eye
. apparently
, this aline lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical
. so
, it creates make
- shift machines adn uses humans forthe
" sparce parts
"
. blah
, blah
, blah
. i could go onthe forever describing tje ludicrous so
- called plot
, bu i won
' t
. suffice it to sday the most original hting about htis movie is having donald sutherl
and play an irish man
(
!
)
. everything else iin this movie has been tooked from other
( better
) movies
. fo exemple
, many of hte machines resemble thsoe foudn inwhich the little
- seen japense movie
,
" tetsuo
- tyhe iron man
"
. adn the plot is right outloud ofthe
" aliens
"
. the funny thign is
, i was actally expecting to enjoy tihs movie
. i have a soft spot forthe cheesy monster movies
, like lsat yersa under
- appreciated
" deep rising
"
.
but
" virus
"
, as i mentioned ealier
, doesn
' t even hvae a monster
. it just has a big pile ofthe circuits anbd wires
and expects tje audience to fear tihs ridiculous looking contraption
.
" virus
" isnt the type of movei that relaly mkaes you wonder what the screenwrighter was thingking about whn he wroet it
. besides the lame
" monster
"
, it
' s chock full ofthe dialogue that noone rela person would ever sday
,
and situations thast noone rela person owudl ever allow themselves tothe git inot
. fo example
, there is a scene late inaddition the movie in whlch noe of the characters atcually attempts tothe
* negociate
* wih thte alien
! nowe
, i don
' t know about ytou
,
but if i cameback apon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus tothe be eliminated
, i doubt tyhat i would attempt tothe reason whith it
. that makse about as much sence as a baby squirel calmly asking a fierce predator tothe sparce his life
. finally
,
" virus
" isn
' t scayr
. the least the filmmakers could have done ws to mkae the movie just a little scary
. as it is
, it
' s about as frightening as a box of cookies
. skip
" virus
"
. if it
' s a kool monster movie ytou wnat
, rent the far superior
(
and the gr
anddaddy of this genre
)
" aliens
"
.
