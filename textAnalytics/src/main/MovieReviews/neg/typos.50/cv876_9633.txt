a life less ordinary
( r
) hwile the extremly peculiar a life less ordinary does live uv to its title
, a omre appropiate moniker would be a movei more misguided
, fo this confuzled
, confusing attempt at romantic comedy isnt a most disarming diaster from thte talented trainspotting team ofthe director danny boyle
, producer andrew macdonald
,
and screenwrighter john hodge
. at the core ofthe this stange film is a fairly basic
-
-
and
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. aftter robert
( boyle regluar ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writer ofthe triachy novels
, is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation
, he kidnaps naville ' s
( ian holm
) spoiled daughter celine
( cameron diaz
)
and holds her for ransom
. thte joke here isnt that celine is a willing victim
-
- her father threatend tothe cutted her off financially
, so she wants revenge
-
-
and that she soon becomes nto only an accomplice
bu the brains behind the scheme
, teaching thge inept robert a thing or twpo about kidnapping
.
.
.
adn
, ultimately
( didn ' t we see htis one coming
?
)
, love
. so far
, so mediocre
.
but mediocre is better than dreadful
, which this film is
, thanks in no small part tothe thge hodge ' s contextual frame for the romance
. it turns outloud thast god isnt displeased wiht the divorce
and rumatic breakup rate on earth
, so the cheif of heaven ' s polical
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches two angels
, o ' reilly
( holly hunter
)
anbd jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, to earth tothe hook up celine
and robert
-
- or lose their ange status
. thsi conceit might have worked if the ange dimention palyed an integral role in the entire picture
.
bu it could have easily beeen cutted wihtout any clear loss to the film
; as it stands
, it isnt simply a waste ofthe time that distracts fomr the romance at hand
. nto tht there is much ofthe a romance to beign wtih
. try as diaz
and mcgregor may
, celine
and robert are too oen
- onot to become very endearing charachters
. celine is rich bitch
; robert is a dullard
. as such
, it isnt qutie hard forthe the audeince tothe really connect wiht these twpo
-
-
then agian
, tehy never seem to really connect whith each other
. when celine
and robert strat to overtly act onthe theri
" feelings
,
" it comes off more liuke something scripted than anything naturual
.
bu i am not exactly sure if boyle
annd comany ' s point was romance
; honestly
, i am not exactly sure wqat they weere trying tothe accomplish
. boyle juices uv the visuals with his charactersistic razzmatazz
,
bu it remains just that
-
- energy
, nto energy inspite sevice of a story or even acting
. the casted seems lost
, especially hunter
, whose performance is so adrift as tothe be baffling
.
anbd
then htere are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film
: soem violent confrontations involving the angels
, who are not exactlly angelic
-
- iin fatc
, they end uv staging their own ransom scheme
; smoe mystical hokum in the climax
;
annd a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much of a life less ordinary is liuke being trapped in indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks in the name ofthe kool
. instade
, teh film just gives quirky a bad nmae
. my best guess as to what teh filmmakers wnated tothe acompish isnt an atmosphere ofthe warped womantic
( yes
, misspelling intended
) whimsy
, which comes thru inspite only one scene
: an extended musical number where celine
anbd robert sing
" beyond the sae
" at a karaoke bar
. after a verse or twpo
, the cuple are magicaly dolled up inaddition snazzy outfits
and hairdos
,
adn engage in a spirited dance routine on hte counter
. thte scene works nto only because ofthe its realtive simplicity
bu allso because it does not try too hard
, jstu relying on the innate charm of thge leads
, alowing them tothe build a rumatic rapport
. alas
, not nearly enough is built
, for tihs moment comes tothe an abrupt end
. i applaud any attempt tothe bring something fresh
anbd unique to movei houses
,
but sometimes even cleverness cant reach overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" different
,
"
bu by hte time the film wass over
, i was clamoring for a life omre ordinary
.
" i cant accept failure
. everyone fails at something
.
but i can ' t accept nto trying
. it doesn ' t marter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart
.
