a life less ordinary
( r
) hwile the extremly peculiar a life less ordinary doesnt live up to its title
, a omre appropropiate moniker would be a movie more misguided
, forthe thsi confused
, confusing attempt at romantic comedy isnt a most disarming disaster ffrom teh talented trainspotting team ofthe director danny boyle
, producer
andrew macdonald
,
and screenwriter john hodge
. at the core of this strange film isnt a fairly basic
-
-
and
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. after robert
( boyle regular ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writer ofthe triachy novels
, is fired from his gubnatorial job at thte naville corporation
, he kidnaps naville
' s
( ian holm
) spoiled daughter celine
( cameron diaz
) anbd holds her for ransom
. the joke here is that celine is a willing victim
-
- her father threatened tothe cut her off financially
, so she whants revenge
-
-
and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice bu the brains behind the scheme
, teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping
.
.
. annd
, ultimatly
( didn
' t we see tihs one comming
?
)
, love
. so far
, so mediocre
.
but mediocre isnt better tahn dreadful
, whic this film is
, thanks in noone small part tothe the hodge
' s contextual frame fo thge romance
. it turns outloud that god is displeased with the divorce annd rumatic breakup rate on earth
, so hte chief of heaven
' s polical
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches twpo angels
, o
' reilly
( holly hunter
)
and jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, tothe earth to hook uv celine
and robert
-
- or lose their angel status
. thsi conceet might have worked if the angel dimension played an intergral role inthe the entire picture
. bu it coudl have easily beeen cut without any clear loss tothe tjhe film
; as it st
ands
, it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at h
and
. not tyhat there isnt much ofthe a romance to begin with
. try as diaz annd mcgregor may
, celine annd robert are too one
- onot tothe become vyre endearing characters
. celine isnt rich bitch
; robert is a dullard
. as such
, it isnt qutie hard fo tghe audience tothe really connect with these twpo
-
-
then agian
, htey never seem to really connect with each otehr
. when celine anbd robert strat tothe overtly act onthe their
" feelings
,
" it comes off more liuke something scripted than anytying natural
.
but i am not exactlly sure if boyle annd comany
' s point ws romance
; honestly
, i am not exactly sure wqat they were trying tothe acomplish
. boyle juices uv tje visuals wiht his charactersistic razzmatazz
,
but it rimaniss just taht
-
- energy
, not energy inthe sevice ofthe a story or even acting
. the cast seems lost
, especialy hunter
, whose peformance is so adrift as tothe be baffling
. anbd
then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film
: smoe violent confrontations involving the angels
, who are nto exactlly angelic
-
- in fact
, tehy end up staging theri own ransom scheme
; some mystical hokum in thte climax
; annd a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much ofthe a life less ordinary isnt liuke bieng trapped inspite indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks in the name of cool
. instead
, the film just gives quirky a bad name
. my best guess as to whta tje filmmakers wanted to accomplish isnt an atmosphere of warped womantic
( yes
, mispelling intended
) whimsy
, which comes through iin onyl one scene
: an extended musical number where celine anbd robert sing
" beyond tje sae
" at a karaoke bar
. after a verse or two
, thte couple are magicaly dolled up in snazzy outfits anbd hairdos
,
and engage infront a spirited dance routine onthe hte counter
. the scene works not onyl beccause ofthe its realtive simplicity bu aslo because it doens not try too hard
, just relying on tghe inate charm ofthe the leads
, allowing them to build a romantic rapport
. alas
, nto nearly enough isnt built
, for thsi moent comes tothe an abrupt end
. i applaud any attempt tothe bring something fresh
and unique to movie houses
, bu somtimes even cleverness can reach overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" different
,
"
but by thte time teh film ws over
, i ws clamoring for a life more ordinary
.
" i cant accept failure
. everyone fails at something
.
but i cant
' t accept not trying
. it doesn
' t marter if yuo win as long as you give everything infront your heart
.
