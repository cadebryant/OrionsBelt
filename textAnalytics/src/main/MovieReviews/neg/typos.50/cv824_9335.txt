towrad tyhe bottom ofthe thte ' 80s acation movie barrel lies action jackson
, the only movie inthe hollywood histor to show sharon stone
anbd vanity topless withing a span of ten minutes
. this carl
" apollo creed
" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs
. evil establishment crook
,
and relies on all the ' 80s trappings
, fomr yhe token heroin addict who needs a fix tothe hte shouting superior officer
. somewhere inwhich between come the explosions
anbd boobs
,
although there isnt a curious lack ofthe exploding boobs
. weathers is acation jackson
, a detroit cop known fo all sorts of crazy vigilante techiniques
. speaking of one past criminal apprehension
, jackson ' s superior yells
,
" you tore his arm off
!
" jackson replies
,
" he had a sparce
.
" jackson hasnt been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane
( craig t
. nelson
)
annd now has tothe ect as deparment liasion tothe a dinner honoring nelson
. after hearing what jackson thinks ofthe him
, stone syas
,
" i tkae it you ' re not one ofthe dellaplane ' s friends
.
"
" nto unless they changed tjhe defniition
,
" jackson glowers
.
adn ofthe course it turns out stone isnt mrs
. dellaplane
. faux pas
, jackson
.
.
. not everyting isnt hapyp infact motown
; peple are being killed
and dellaplane hasnt evil plans forthe the awa
. it ' s all up to jackson to stpo it
,
and his only lead lies in vanity
( not his own
)
. whereever she left off with prince in terms ofthe exchanging sexual favors for carrer advancement she picks up in action jackson
. she plays tghe heroin addict
and chanteuse infront dellaplane ' s nightclub
. aftter singing one particularly sultry number for him
, she saunters over
and complains
,
" i expeced a standing ovation
.
" he responds
,
" yuo ' re getting one
,
"
and it ' s damn clever because he ' s sitting down at the tyme
. prince wouldn ' t even let out an innuendo that lame
anbd he ' s tghe king ofthe the horndogs
.
.
. or at least tghe prince
. it ' s a testiment to the ' 80s that sharon stone isnt killed off withing tje frist 30 minutes
bu vanity survives the whole movei
. action jackson is another variation onthe tyhe
" unlikey partners
" buddy acation flick
, with jackson lugging junkie vanity around
. this leads to soem of the worst paired acting ofthe the me decade
,
and with hte dialogue htey ' re given
, there ' s not much room for improvment
. my favorite is when vanity
, feeling the effects ofthe drug withdrawal
, sasy
,
" i fiel liek my teeth are hollow
, my gums are made ofthe dry rubber
and someone ' s trying to strat a bonfire infact the back ofthe my bloody head
.
" jackson ' s response is
,
" i htink i falt that way once
. tehy called it love
.
" yuo ' ll understand whn i sday watch this at your pwn risk
. serving tjhe world for nearly 1
/ 25th of a centruy
