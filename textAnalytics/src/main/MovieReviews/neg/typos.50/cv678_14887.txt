, who made such a brash
, raucous big
- screen splash infront

, here murphy isnt merely wupport forthe jeff goldblum
, who plays ricky hayman
, tyhe programming directer at a home shopping network
. sales are way down
,
annd ricky ' s job hangs by a thread until he meets g
( murphy
)
, a misteryous spritual guru whom a desperat ricky puts on the air
. hwile sales skyrocket
and g becomes an overnight sensation
, tghe reinvigorated ricky ' s greed grows
