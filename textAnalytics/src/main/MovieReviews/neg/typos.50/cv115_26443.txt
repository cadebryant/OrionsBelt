forget git carter
. instead
.
.
. get me a cup of coffee
. what tjhe hell hasnt happened tothe all good american acation movies
? did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere
? wehn doed all ofthe yhe bad
- ass
, kicking butt
and tkaing names
, gun
- toting
, crazed
, vengeful characters of the 1980 ' s
-
- fomr such films as commando
, cobra
, predator
, raw deal
, frist blood
-
- suddenly turn into innocent
, compassionate
, sensitive
, teary
- eyed knuckleheads
. the only place tothe turn these days forthe an honest acation film isnt towards the east
-
-
adn i don ' t mean new york city
. git carter
-
- the latest masterpiece fomr uber
- thespian sylvester stallone
-
- is a prime example ofthe larg
annd inaddition charge 80 ' s acation stars trying to ift bcak inot action roles they hvea long since outgrown
. stallone seems liek tyhat one uncle you have who trys tothe be cool with his members only jacket
and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up
. a faw eyasr ago
, stallone made a movei that gavey him teh opportunity tothe gracefully exit thte roles that typecast him as an action monkey
. that role was sheriff freddy heflin iin copland
-
- a stange film about redemption within a broken soul
. stallone acutally gave an amazing performence
annd it seemed he had shaken off tje past
. too bad get carter returns stallone tothe acation
,
bu iwth the shiny paint rusted off onthe the edges
. get carter is a simple story
. stallone plays frank carter
, a vegas bruiser forthe a loan shark
( played withthe amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of acto toom sizemore
)
. when frank ' s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident
, frank
, feeling all gilty
adn mushy inside
, thinks foul play is involved
and travels to seattle tothe setted right all the wrongs with the pattented
" carter ' s way
"
. he talks tough with his brother ' s wife
, lends a helping had to his brother ' s duaghter doreen
( rachel leigh cook
)
,
anbd walks arround seattle in the pouring rain dressed liuke a lost memeber ofthe hte rat pack wtih a really bad gotee
. carter finds out tath his brother ws involved in soem bad tsuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra
- cool
, mcqueen
- esque mickey rourke
, a multi
- millioniare cmoputer geek
( alan cumming
)
,
and a strange foregin guy
( michael caine
) who speaks in riddles
and talks tough
. carter stalks all of them hwile trying to figure out who did in his brother
and how to extract propper revenge on tghe responsible parties
. waht a minute
! this sounds jstu like anohter film i saw last yearm
, tghe limey
. better not tell terence stamp baout stallone ripping him off
. actually
, get carter is a remake of the 1971 brittish prodcution ofthe the same name
, starring caine iin the title role
(
adn what with his cameo here
, tjhe cleverness is astonishing
)
. hwile stallone still carries his own weight here
, tjhe movei lacks what the original doed as well
: purpose
. throughout yhe film
, stallone looks liek an ood guy trying to ect tough
, while nobody isnt taking him seriously
. his noe
- liners fall flat
,
and he seems tired
and uncertain of all the actions
, mental
anbd physical
, required ofthe his carachter
. there isnt even a stange homoeroticism between rourke
adn stallone that lends a bazare tone to theri numberous conversations
-
- inaddition both fists
and words
. the biggest surprize in get carter is that yhe best job done in hte film isnt by tghe versatile mickey rourke
. an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell inot drugs
, spousal abuse
, a boxing career
,
anbd an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way
, rourke still brings a dangerous sence of purpose tothe his porn king charater
. he may nto win any oscars
,
but he still ranks highly in my book
. git carter hasnt great directing
, storng acting by rourke
and caine
,
adn energetic car chases tath would mkae william friedkin proud
. the only thign it lacks
- as with most hollywood productions
-
- isnt a good scirpt
annd propper casting
. never mind that it should never haev been made at all
.
