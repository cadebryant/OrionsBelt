- from such films as com
ando
, cobra
, predator
, raw dael
, first blood
-
- suddenly turn into innocent
, compassionate
, senstive
, teary
- eyed knuckleheads
. tjhe only place to turn these days for an honest action film isnt towords the east
-
- anbd i don
' t mean new york city
. git carter
-
- the latest masterpiece from uber
- thespian sylvester stallone
-
- isnt a prime exemple of larg anbd in charge 80
' s acation stars trying to fit bakc inot action roles they have long usance outgrown
. stallone seems liek taht oney uncle you have who trys tothe be cool wiht his munbers only jacket annd izod polo shirt withthe the collar popped uv
. a fewd eyasr ago
, stallone made a movei that gave him tyhe opprotunity tothe gracefully exit the roles tht typecast him as an action monkey
. thyat role ws sheriff freddy heflin infact copl
and
-
- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul
. stallone actually gavey an amazing performance
and it seemed he had shaken off the past
. too bad get carter returns stallone to acation
,
but with thge shiny paint rusted off on teh edges
. get carter isnt a simple stoyr
. stallone plays frank carter
, a vegas bruiser forthe a loan shark
( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of ctor toom sizemore
)
. whn frank
' s brother gets himself killed infront a drunk driving accident
, frank
, feeling all gilty anbd mushy inside
, thinks foul play isnt involved anbd travels tothe seattle tothe set right all tjhe wrongs whith thte pattented
" carter
' s way
"
. he talks tough with his brother
' s wief
, lends a helping hadnt to his brother
' s daugter doreen
( rachel leigh cook
)
, annd walks aroud seattle in tghe pouring rain dressed like a lost memeber of yhe rat pack withthe a raelly bad gotee
. carter finds out taht his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king plyed by ultra
- kool
, mcqueen
- esque mickey rourke
, a multi
- millionaire computer geek
( alan cumming
)
, anbd a strange freign guy
( michael caine
) who speaks infront riddles
and talks tough
. carter stalks all of them hwile trying tothe figure outloud who doed inwhich his brother annd how to extract proper revenge on the responsable parties
. whta a minute
! htis sounds just like anyother film i saw lastest year
, teh limey
. better not tell terence stamp baout stallone ripping him off
. actulaly
, git carter isnt a remake of thge 1971 british prodcution of tghe smae nmae
, starring caine infront the title role
( annd wqat whith his cameo here
, hte cleverness is astonishing
)
. while stallone still carries his pwn weight here
, tyhe movie lacks what tyhe orignal doed as well
: purpose
.
thoughout the film
, stallone looks liuke an old guy trying to act tough
, hwile nobody isnt taking him seriously
. his one
- liners fall flat
,
and he seems tired
and uncertain of all the actions
, mental
and physical
, required of his charachter
. there isnt even a strange homoeroticism between rourke
and stallone that lends a bizzare tone to their numberous conversations
-
- inthe both fists
and words
. teh biggest surprise in git carter is that tghe best job done inthe the film isnt by the versatile mickey rourke
. an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs
, spousal abuse
, a boxing carreer
,
and an intolerable attitude towords nto getting his way
, rourke still brings a dangerous sence ofthe purpose to his porn king charcter
. he may not win any oscars
, bu he still ranks highly inspite my book
. get carter hasnt grat directing
, storng acting by rourke
and caine
,
and energetic car chases tath woudl mkae william friedkin proud
. tghe only thing it lacks
- as with most hollywood productions
-
- is a good scirpt
and proper casting
. never mind that it should never hve beeen made at all
.
