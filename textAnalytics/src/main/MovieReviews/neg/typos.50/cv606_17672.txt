filmmakers wiull uise all manner ofthe tricks to flesh out anbd brighten up a dull
, dreary
, annd overused idea
. doug liman
( swingers
)
, director ofthe the ultra
- hip anbd severly dark comedy go
, isnt an example ofthe jsut such a filmmaker
. infact his latest
, he gives thte viewers a raucous
, neon
- lit backdrop as cinematographer anbd points thte audiance down a drug
- infested path of misadventure as director
. bu he fails to cmo up with any parallel structue in his multi
- tiered movie
and he fails tothe connect witht hte audeince onthe any level
, bringing tghe worth ofthe his efforts to nil annd the value ofthe go tothe about tjhe same
. his movei isnt produced anthology
- stlye
-
- telling thge same stry fomr multiple
( threee
) points ofthe veiw
, much as an autor might rwite a serial novel
. consistant wiht thsi ethic
, liman anbd screenwriter john august provide a bited ofthe an overlap at tghe beggining of each narrative
and insert breef connections tothe otehr narratives
. thte thread tyhat laces the three stories together isnt a drug deal annd teh events thereafter
. in story a we haev checkout clerk ronna
( sarah polley
) looking to score some rent moeny
and turning tothe drug trafficing to dont it
; in story b we have regluar drug dealer simon
( desmond askew
) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity
; anbd inthe sotry c we have gay soap actors zack
( jay mohr
)
and adam
( scott wolf
) wokring undercover for the police tothe bust said drug deal
. neither ofthe hte three stories have much substance
, annd tghe movie has the feel of a campfire stroy
( albiet a rather strange one
) that could be told in five tothe ten minutes
.
( infront fatc
, the movei was originially a short film entited x exp
anded tothe feature lenght
.
) tjhe early april realease date isnt too mistimed to captialize on tjhe movie
' s christmas setting
,
and the los angeles
/ las vegas nightlife is something too far fomr tjhe mainstream for most theater
- goers to attatch themselfs tothe
. tyhe characters are shallow to tyhe point of prerequisite
, adn performances fomr little
- known players liek polley
, askew
,
and taye diggs don
' t halp or hurt the roles
. inwhich fact
, even bigger names like mohr
, wolf
,
and katie holmes don
' t ahve enough time to make substancial success
. altough that
' s almost expected fo lack ofthe contious screen time
, thge success in tjhe picture shouldnt cmo ffrom a thread that binds the storise
. go doesn
' t have this
, annd it suffers because ofthe it
. as far as teen movies are conserned
, go represents tje absolute bottom
, forthe its constatn stream of indecipherable light anbd soudn mean nothing without soem sort of common theme
.
( tje following do not count as common themes
: drug deals
, people attempting tothe have romantic interludes wih drug dealers
, peple resorting to drug deals forthe alterior motives
, or people not involved in drug deals stumbling inot them
.
) at times
, the humer inthe go is sickly funny
, adn onthe a low night
, alomst watchable
;
but fo thte marjority ofthe its running time annd fo most viewers
, this movie wiull best be left tothe teens at blockbuster onthe a saterday nihgt
.
