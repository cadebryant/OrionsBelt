filmmakers will use all manner ofthe tricks tothe flesh out
and brighten up a dull
, dreary
,
and overused diea
. doug liman
( swingers
)
, director of tghe ultra
- hip
and severely dark comedy go
, is an example ofthe just such a filmmaker
. infact his latest
, he gives tyhe viewers a raucous
, neon
- lit backdrop as cinematographer
and points thge audience down a drug
- infested path ofthe misadventure as directer
.
bu he fails to come uv wih any parallel structue in his multi
- tiered movei
annd he fails to connect iwth teh audience on any level
, bringing the worth ofthe his effords tothe nil
anbd the value ofthe go tothe baout tghe same
. his movei isnt produced anthology
- style
-
- telling the same sotry from mutiple
( three
) points of veiw
, much as an autor might write a serial novel
. consistent wih thsi ethic
, liman
annd screenwrighter john august provide a bit of an overlap at hte beginnig of each narrative
adn insert breef connections to other narratives
. tjhe thread that laces the three storise toghether isnt a drug deal
and thge events thereafter
. in story a we hvae checkout clerk ronna
( sarah polley
) looking to score soem rent money
and turning to drug trafficking tothe do it
; in stoy b we ahve regular drug dealer simon
( desmond askew
) gone tothe las vegas giving ronna her opportunity
;
adn in story c we hve gay soap actors zack
( jay mohr
)
anbd adam
( scott wolf
) wokring undercover forthe tyhe police to bust said drug deal
. niether ofthe teh three stroies haev much substace
,
and the movie has tje feel of a campfire story
( albiet a rether strange one
) thta could be told inaddition five to ten minutes
.
( inaddition fatc
, the movie was originally a short film entitlied x expanded tothe feature length
.
) thte early april release date is too mistimed to captialize onthe thge movei ' s christmas setting
,
and the los angeles
/ las vegas nightlife is something too far fomr yhe mainstream fo most theather
- goers tothe attach themselves to
. tghe cahracters are shallow tothe the point ofthe prerequisite
,
adn performances fomr little
- known players liek polley
, askew
,
annd taye diggs don ' t help or hurt tjhe roles
. in fatc
, even bigger names like mohr
, wolf
,
anbd katie holmes don ' t have anough time to mkea substantial success
.
although that ' s alomst expected for lack ofthe contious screen time
, the success infront teh picture should cmo from a thread that binds hte stories
. go doesn ' t hvea this
,
and it suffers beccause ofthe it
. as far as teen movies are conserned
, go represents the absolute bottom
, fo its constant stream ofthe indecipherable light
annd sound mean nothing without soem sort ofthe common theme
.
( tje folowing do nto count as common themes
: drug deals
, peopel attempting to have rumatic interludes with drug dealers
, peopel resorting tothe drug deals fo alterior motives
, or people nto involved in drug deals stumbling inot them
.
) at times
, the humor in go isnt sickly funny
,
and onthe a low nihgt
, almost watchable
;
but forthe the majority of its running tiome
and for most viewers
, this movie will best be left tothe teens at blockbuster onthe a saturday night
.
