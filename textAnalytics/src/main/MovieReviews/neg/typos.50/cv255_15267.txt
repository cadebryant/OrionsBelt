movies don
' t come much more ridiculously titled thna
" i still know waht ytou doed last summer
,
"
but usance the movie infront question is best descibed as ridiculous
, thge title sort ofthe works as a warning
. more than a silly
- sounding mouthful tothe blurt outloud tothe the ticket vendor
, this horror sequel
' s moniker aslo contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw tje original iwll be able to spot
: whta
" you
" doed
_ lsat
_ summer
" yuo
" acually did the summer
_ befoer
_ last summer
,
and sicne
" i
" knew baout it
_ this
_ summer as well as
_ last
_ summer
, it
' s realy ilogical to sday that
" i
"
_ still
_ konw waht
" ytou
" doed
_ last
_ summer
. tje filmmakers woudl ahve at least made sense withthe the shorter
" i still know
,
" tje longer
" i still know what you did twpo summers ago
" or the appropiate
" stupid peopel getting hacked tothe bits
.
" thast last suggestion is the preferrable one since the cahracters in htis film do things that are tghe polar opposite ofthe smart
. for exmaple
, if your roommate is plagued by terrable nightmares as a result ofthe being stalked adn nearly murdered nto long ago
, woudl yuo sneak into her room late at night
and hide inaddition the closet
, even if it was just to locate
and borrow a cute littel dress
? probably nto
, bu that
' s precisly what coleeg student karla
( pop diva br
andy
) doens tothe best firend julie
( jennifer lveo hewitt
)
, resulting in the first in a long line ofthe phony frights
. julie
, you
' ll reacll
, ws oney of tje sole survivers at tjhe end ofthe 1997
' s surprize hit
" i knwo whta yuo did last summer
,
" after a slasher with a grudge tothe bear
- it
' s a
_ long
_ story
- began trying tothe pick off her
, her buddies annd various others in their coastal carolina vilage
. inaddition this installment
, hte plot picks up as karla wins a trip tothe teh bahamas
,
and julie
, yot racked by guilt
, decides that maybe a tropical getaway wiull halp ease her mind
. yeah
, right
. theri isl
and paradise hasnt room
, ofthe course
, for noe more in thge form ofthe the still
- alive killer
( muse watson
) from the firt film
. he sports tghe smae gorton
' s fisherman git
- up
, a heavy hat adn rain slicker that mask his idenity
, bu why he
' s still trying tothe stay annymous isnt a mistery tihs movie never solves
.
.
.
though i supose his hook
- h
and owudl look funny protruding ffrom hte sleeve of a leesure suit
. in a sense
, thast
' s hte movei
' s glaring flaw
- everybody knows who tjhe bad guy is
, thus evaporating tje levle ofthe paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel
. the murders anbd attemted murders in thast film were vivid
and scarry
,
but trey callaway
' s derivitive
" i still nkow
" screenplay mkaes thge fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims
. when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed
, giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once anbd forthe all
, waht does he dont
? he twist
- ties the lid shut annd cranks up tghe uv rays
- you
' d thikn he
' d whant her gutted nowe instade of a skin cancer victum later
. even prequel
" summer
" lovers might balk at how little htere is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity
and a few neat
- o shots ofthe blood flowing fomr toned teenage flesh
. the inovative gallows humor that scribe
(
and
" scream
" wunderkind
) kevin williamson injected inot
" i knwo
"
' s unfolding tsory is sorely missed
, replaced wih the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weid annd tosses off slang liek
" yo
"
; ytou
' ll cheer
- not shreak
- when he ends uv wih a pair ofthe hedgetrimmers firmly implanted infact his chest
. if
" i nkow whta you did lastr summer
,
" howver effective
, ws just the kind of movei tht those subversive
" scream
" ficks poked fun at
,
then the deadly
" i still know what you did lastr summer
" deserves a full
- blown roasting on
