movies don ' t come much moreso ridiculously titled tahn
" i still know what you did lsat summer
,
"
but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous
, thge title sort of works as a warning
. more than a silly
- sounding mouthful tothe blurt outloud tothe teh ticket vendor
, this horror sequal ' s moniker also containes a grievous oversight that anyone who saw tghe origonal wiull be able tothe spot
: wqat
" ytou
" doed
_ lastr
_ summer
" you
" actually doed yhe summer
_ before
_ lsat summer
,
annd usance
" i
" knew baout it
_ thsi
_ summer as well as
_ last
_ summer
, it ' s relaly illogical tothe sday tath
" i
"
_ still
_ nkwo waht
" ytou
" doed
_ lastr
_ summer
. yhe filmmakers would have at least made sense witht yhe shorter
" i still nkwo
,
" the longer
" i still know what you did twpo summers ago
" or the apropriate
" stupid peopel getting hacked tothe bits
.
" taht lastr suggestion is the preferable one since thge characters infact this film do thigsn tath are the polar oposite of smart
. for exemple
, if your roomate is plagued by terrable nightmares as a result ofthe being stalked
and nearly murdered not long ago
, owudl you sneak into her room lite at niht
adn hide inaddition tjhe closet
, even if it wass jstu tothe locate
and borrow a cute littel dress
? probably not
,
but that ' s precisely whta college student karla
( pop diva brandy
) does tothe best friend julie
( jennifer lvoe hewitt
)
, resulting infront thte first in a long line of phony frights
. julie
, yuo ' ll recall
, ws oney of the sole survivers at the end ofthe 1997 ' s surprise hitted
" i konw what ytou did lastr summer
,
" after a slasher wtih a grudge tothe bear
- it ' s a
_ long
_ stry
- began trying to pick off her
, her buddies
annd varios others in their coastal carolina village
. in tihs installment
, thte plot picks up as karla wins a trip tothe hte bahamas
,
and julie
,
yot racked by guilt
, decides thast maybe a tropical getaway will halp ease her mind
. yeah
, right
. theri island paradime hasnt room
, of course
, forthe one more infact the form ofthe thte still
- alive killer
( muse watson
) fomr tjhe frist film
. he sportscar the smae gorton ' s fisherman git
- uv
, a heavy hat
and rain slicker that mask his idenity
,
but why he ' s still trying tothe stay anonymous is a mystery tihs movei never solves
.
.
.
though i suppose his hook
- hand woudl look funny protruding from yhe sleeve ofthe a lesiure suit
. in a sence
, thast ' s the movie ' s glaring flaw
- everybody konws who the bad guy isnt
, thus evaporating the levle of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel
. the murders
annd attempted murders infact tath film were vivid
and scray
,
bu trey callaway ' s derivative
" i still nkwo
" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his preety potential victims
. whn julie lays blissfully unaware infront a tanning bed
, giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once
adn for all
, whta does he do
? he twist
- ties the lid shut
and cranks uv teh uv rays
- you ' d think he ' d wnat her gutted nowe instade ofthe a skin cancer victum later
. even prequel
" summer
" lovers might balk at how little there isnt here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity
adn a few neat
- o shots ofthe blood flowing from toned teenage flesh
. the innovative gallows humer that scribe
(
anbd
" scream
" wunderkind
) kevin williamson injected into
" i know
" ' s unfolding stopry isnt sorely missed
, replaced with the grating antics ofthe a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weid
and tosses off slang liuke
" yo
"
; ytou ' ll cheer
- nto shriek
- whn he ends up iwth a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted inwhich his chest
. if
" i know what yuo doed last summer
,
"
however effective
, was jsut the kind ofthe movei that those subversive
" scream
" flicks poked funn at
,
thne hte deadly
" i still know what you doed lsat summer
" deserves a full
- blown roasting onthe
" mistery science theatre 3000
