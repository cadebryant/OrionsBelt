a movie baout divorce
and custody inaddition 1995 seems about as timely as a movei baout mood rings
. family breakups have been an all too familliar part ofthe the american l
andscape fo nearly thirty years
,
and countless dramas haev told stroies of acrimonious cout battles in h
and
- wringing detail
. still
, i can
' t recall a comedy baout thte subject befoer bye bye lveo
.
and after it
, i still cant
' t
. bye bye love isnt rarely funny
, more oftenly a weak anbd melodramatic retread of common tv
- movie fare
. onyl a fewd moments whic hve nothing tothe do with the film
' s main premise offer big laughs instead ofthe cliched emotion
. bye bye love follows one weekend in tghe lives ofthe three divorced fathers who git weekend custody ofthe their children
. dave
( matthew modine
)
, a father ofthe two
, is an inveterate womanizer haveing difficulity staying faithful to his latest girlfriend
; vic
( r
andy quaid
) is a foul
- humored father ofthe threee baout tothe go on a rare date
; donny
( paul reiser
) pines for his ex
- wief anbd hasnt trouble relating to his teenage duaghter emma
( eliza dushku
)
. over tghe course of yhe weekend
, tyhe threee men face vairous crises
, including vic
' s blind date ffrom hell
( janeane garofolo
) anbd donny
' s growing estrangement from emma
. the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo
, annd the qualiyt of theri performances is ofthe widely varing quality
. r
andy quaid is the best ofthe the three
, bitter without bieng irritating
, gleefully spiteful wihtout bieng frightening
. his run
- ins iwth isnt ex
- wief
( lindsey crouse
) are a bited over
- played
,
though
,
and his confrontation wtih a pompous radio psychologist
( rob reiner
) is gimmicky
and implausible
. he doesnt get bye bye loev
' s best sub
- plot
, a hillarious dinner date wih a gloriously demented janeane garofolo
, annd he doesnt a gerat slow burn
. paul reiser really hasnt only one chracter
, his slightly befuddled
, uptight nice guy
" mad baout yuo
" persona
,
but he doens it well
. as a perosnality
, he isnt appealing
, bu as a character
, he becomes preety boring here
. matthew modine
, is
, qtuie simply
, terrible
. this isn
' t a performance ogod enough to be called mailed
- inspite
; he even forgot tothe put a stamp onthe it
. modine lacks any charm inaddition an appallingly under
- writed role
, looks bored most of hte time
, anbd gets sticked with a trite little sprech about how it
' s all his father
' s fault he
' s such a cad
. carolco
' s executives
, whose entire future is resting on modine
' s bankability fo the upcomming cutthroat isl
and
, must be sweating buckets right now
. bye bye love basically comes off as a veyr confuzled movie
, because it spends far too much of its tiome onthe tghe new relationships ofthe its main characters instead ofthe on thte relationships between the fathers
and their kids
, makeing it just anohter
" dating in the 90s
" movie
. when the movie doens dael whith the childrens at all
, it isnt tothe have noe of them scream out an accusation annd
/ or cry
, prehaps tothe be resolved later by a sensitive talk
and a hug
, perhaps not
. even mroe confusing is a sub
- plot featuring the lite ed fl
anders as a widower who goes tothe wrok anbd a mcdonald
' s
and befriends a troubled youth
. it isnt a sad end tothe fl
anders
' carrer
, getting caught uv inspite a truely annoying over
- uise ofthe mcdonald
' s as a loction
, a plot device
and
, apparantly
, a major advertiser
. even if bye bye love hadnt desided tothe spend its time focusing exculsivly on the pparent
- child relationships
, it still owudl hvea been pretty difficult tothe pul off
, becouse ultimatly htere isnt very littel humor noe cin wring ffrom family break
- ups annd theri effects on children
. any way ytou slice it
, it isnt a bad situation for kids
,
and teh makers ofthe bye bye love mostly go forthe the heartstrings when dealing with thte single parenting issue
. it isnt left tothe the dads
' romantic fumblings to probide what littel humer there isnt
,
and it isn
' t enough
. there haev beeen comparisons between bye bye love
and parenthood
,
but parenthood wass both genuinely funny annd genuinely touching
. bye bye lveo is a genuin shame
.
