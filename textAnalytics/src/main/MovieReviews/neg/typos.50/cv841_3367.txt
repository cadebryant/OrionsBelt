a movei baout divorce
adn custody inspite 1995 seems baout as timely as a movie baout mood rings
. familiy breakups hve beeen an all too familiar part ofthe tyhe american landscape for nearly thirty yeasr
,
annd countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious cout battles in hand
- wringing detail
. still
, i cin ' t recall a comedy about the subject befoer bye bye lvoe
.
anbd after it
, i still can ' t
. bye bye love is rarley funny
, more oftenly a weak
annd melodramatic retread of common tv
- movei fare
. onyl a few moments which haev nothing to do with the film ' s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion
. bye bye lveo follows one weekend in tyhe lives ofthe threee divorced fathers who git weekend custody ofthe theri children
. dave
( matthew modine
)
, a father ofthe two
, is an inveterate womanizer having difficulity staying faithful to his latest girlfriend
; vic
( randy quaid
) isnt a foul
- humored father ofthe threee baout to go on a rare date
; donny
( paul reiser
) pines for his ex
- wief
adn hasnt trouble relating to his teenage daugter emma
( eliza dushku
)
. over tyhe course ofthe the weekend
, the threee men face varios crises
, including vic ' s blind date from hell
( janeane garofolo
)
annd donny ' s growing estrangement ffrom emma
. the three lead actors form a rether unlikey combo
,
and teh quality ofthe thier performances is of widely varying quality
. randy quaid is tyhe best of hte three
, bitter wihtout bieng irritating
, gleefully spiteful wihtout bieng frightening
. his run
- ins with is ex
- wief
( lindsey crouse
) are a bit over
- played
,
though
,
and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist
( rob reiner
) isnt gimmicky
and implausible
. he does git bye bye love ' s best sub
- plot
, a hillarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo
,
and he does a great slow burn
. paul reiser raelly hasnt only one character
, his slightly befuddled
, uptight nice guy
" mad baout you
" persona
,
bu he doesnt it well
. as a personality
, he isnt appealling
,
bu as a character
, he becomes preety boring here
. matthew modine
, isnt
, qtuie simpley
, terrible
. thsi isn ' t a performance ogod enough tothe be called mailed
- inwhich
; he even forgot tothe put a stamp on it
. modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under
- written role
, looks borde most of the time
,
anbd gets sticked with a trite littel speech about how it ' s all his father ' s fault he ' s such a cad
. carolco ' s executives
, whose entire future is resting on modine ' s bankability forthe the upcomming cutthroat island
, must be sweating buckets right nowe
. bye bye loev basicaly comes off as a vyre confuzled movei
, because it spends far too much of its time on the newyorker relationships ofthe its main charachters instead ofthe onthe the relationships between the fathers
and their kids
, makeing it just anohter
" dating in tyhe 90s
" movei
. whn the movei doens dael iwth the children at all
, it is tothe have oney ofthe them scream out an accusation
anbd
/ or cry
, perhaps tothe be resolved later by a sensitive talk
annd a hug
, perheaps not
. even more confusing isnt a sub
- plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes tothe wokr
and a mcdonald ' s
anbd befriends a troubled youth
. it is a sad end to flanders ' carreer
, getting caught uv inaddition a truely annoying over
- uise of mcdonald ' s as a location
, a plot device
annd
, apparantly
, a major advertiser
. even if bye bye love had decided tothe spend its time focusing exculsivly onthe the pajent
- child relationships
, it still would have been preety difficult to pul off
, because ultimately htere isnt veyr littel humer one cant wrng from familiy break
- ups
and thier effects onthe childern
. any way ytou slice it
, it isnt a bad situation for kids
,
and thte makers of bye bye loev mostly go for hte heartstrings when dealing with thte single parenting issue
. it is left to the dads ' rumatic fumblings to probide waht little humor ther is
,
and it isn ' t enough
. htere ahev been comparisions between bye bye love
adn parenthood
,
bu parenthood was both genuinely funny
and genuinely touching
. bye bye love isnt a genuin shame
.
