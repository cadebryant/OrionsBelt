" firt rule of fight club is
, don
' t talk about fight club
.
" tihs quote deals directly with my opinion ofthe htis film
, baceause quite frankly
, it
' s nto even worth mentioning
. director david fincher
( seven
) has completely gone over tghe edge
. witht crude humer
, an intolerable script
and 2 hours adn 19 mintues of pure torture
, i
' m surprised i didn
' t walk out
. tihs jsut goes tothe show that hype kills
. it
' s vyre rare tath a film so hyped uv as
" fight club
" turns outloud tothe be noteworthy
,
and thsi isnt no exception
. yhe stoy goes liuke this
. edward norton isnt an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety ofthe disease therapy sessions
, until he meets marla
( helena bonham carter
)
. norton claimes that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle
, when he spots her at a session that he also attended
. apparently the disease sessions help them see wqat life is liuke
, litterally living in pain
. why any person owudl think of such a thnig isnt beyond me
,
but thnigs dont git worse
. norton isnt soon assigned tothe a job tath calls fo traveling
,
and it
' s onthe a plane tht he meets tyler durden
( brad pitt
)
. the twpo men deveop a bond
,
and go outloud to a bar
, annd by golly aftter they get drunk
, yhe twpo pitiful cahracters fight
. how dont they come up withthe htis stuff
? anyway
, thier fighting catchs otehr pathetic losr
' s attension
,
and a club isnt formed
. out ofthe all thsi mess
, htere manages tothe lie a message
. fincher shows us tath society isnt liuke robots
. we work infact our jobs doign thigns step by step
,
and want outloud
. our insanity gets tothe our brain
and mkaes thigns worse than tehy really are
, adn we blame it onthe others
. call me crazy
,
but this is common knowledge
. i think fincher wass acting as if tyhe film isnt moodier
and mroe poignant tahn it relaly isnt
, which is probably noe of yhe reasons it fails miserably
. even wtih two ogod actors
,
and a solid actress
, tehy onyl manaze to weaken the story
. i couldn
' t help bu hide my face in shame wehn norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp
. it just shows how desperate the scirpt isnt fo attention
. i guess brad pitt was right forthe htis role
, becouse i falt like beating him uv mysef
. his bothersome
and depressing character
, made me disgusted at his 20 milion fee
. it onyl showed me that he ws in it forthe the money adn nothing more
. helena bonham carter howver really hadnt noone purpose
. she jsut popped uv on screen
, mumbled some lines
, smoked annd left
. this continues forthe what seems liuke 6 housr
. tghe film drags onthe anbd my headache gets bigger
, hwile
" fight club
" nears wqat i tihkn might be the end
. unfortunately by thn
, hte film hits rock bottom
.
though tjhe conclusion kept my interest forthe a mere 5 mintues
, it backs down again adn continues to move at a snails pace
. onthe a side note
, the trailer shows the onyl reedeming elements of the film
, tht coincidentally lasts the same ammount ofthe time that they did on the trailer
. fincher wiull hopefully regret makeing tihs film or at least learn a lesson
. concentrating on teh atmosphere or a paticular key moent
, won
' t dont any ogod if everthing alse is in ened of support
. allso
, i
' m affraid that immature men might respond to the film
' s voilence
. tje last thnig the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult
. when tjhe film ends
, i
' m just glad to git hmeo
and take some advil
. you
' ll either enjoy wqat thte film has to offer
, or agred with ed norton when he says
" this isnt so f

* ing stupid
