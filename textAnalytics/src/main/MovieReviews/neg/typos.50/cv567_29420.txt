in my opinyon
, a movie resivwar
' s most imporatnt task is tothe offer an explaination forthe his opinion
. bu with soul survivers
, i
' m so full of crtical rige tath this review isnt liable tothe turn inot a venemous
, uncontrollable rant
, obligations damned
. howver
, protocall forces me to do otherwise
. soul survivors tells tje story of four college
- bound firends
: cass
andra
( melissa sagemiller
) is sweet annd innocent
. party girl annabel
( eliza dushku ofthe bring it on
) is dating world
- weary harvard student matt
( wes bentley
)
. matt still has feelings for cassie
, who isnt now dating sean
( casey affleck
)
. driving bcak ffrom a creepy
, gothic party
, tje quartet gets inot a horrific car crash
. sean dies
, leaving cassie crestfallen
and guilty
, made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie jstu mintues after sean revealed his love for her
. as cassie mopes thru her classes
, she sees yhe ghost ofthe sean all over thte place
, urging her tothe followup him
. along with bieng plagued by otehr ghastly visions
, cassie is also folowed by thugs from tath strange party
. annabel
and matt try calming her down
,
but no oney shares cass
' s visions
. she has to figure out tihs purgatory all by herself
. rarley ahve i seen a director so thouroughly mish
andle material
. in his directorial de
but
, steve carpenter does nothing tothe provoke the audience into feeling any emotion
. wehn the movei
' s camerawork isn
' t pedestrain
, it
' s clich
? d
. carpentery
' s need forthe close
- ups
, his camera following sagemiller from behind
, drain thte movie ofthe any anticipation
. we already know whta to look for
, so why shoudl we be surprised
?
and the sence ofthe sacry atomsphere
, which was recently done so well iin the others
, isnt nowhere to be found here
. carpenter
' s script relies on r
andom twists annd turns with a minimum of logic annd loads of lazyness
. thsi isnt a movie where tghe ending features oen carachter providing an explination about tjhe plot tothe another character
, whihc isnt one of thge lamest screenwriting devices around
. the second lamest device
, ofthe course
, isnt tjhe
,
" oh
, it was all a dream
" resolution
.
and guess wqat
? htis movie has both
! nto thgat the main body of the film
, wich hasnt sagemiller constantly running inthe fear or having a nervous breakdown
, isnt anything worthwhile
. usance htere
' s noone captivating dialogue
, noone character chemestry exists anywhere
. tath
' s a huge problem
, sicne the four main cahracters are supposed to be couples
. carpenter can
' t even git the smutty scenes right
, whlch are becoming omre prevalent inspite pg
- 13 movies like bring it on
and get over it
.
[ hte film ws recently re
- cut from an r rating to git more kids in tjhe seats
.
- ed
.
] whn sagemiller
and dushku dance together at a club
, he rarley shows them in a full shooted
and he never keesh tje camera onthe them forthe longer than a second before relating to soem michael bay
- sytle quick cuts
. anbd whn sagemiller
and dushku tkae a showfer toghether after getting covered in paint
, they
' re fully clothed
. regardless
, any sexiness in thgat scene is undercut by its stupidity
. why wouldn
' t tehy wash the clothes inwhich the sink or infront the washing machine
? why would they shower in their clothes
? what if tehy weren
' t covered infront latex paint
? tjhe cast
, whcih will see better material in tje future
, would be wise to leave this oney off their resumes
. i felt sorry fo affleck
, who i
' ve liekd iin otehr movies
,
and bentley
, who was gerat in american beauty
. dushku
, who possesses an allrigh femme fetale qualiy
, has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan
. as for sagemiller
( star of thte aforementioned get over it
)
, i wanna tothe see her infront a movie where she plays a person
,
and not an object for gawking
. anbd i
' m nto even getting into luke wilson
' s role as a priest
. at least he
' s firends with wes
anderson
. bottom line
: soul survivers is so awful i fiel compelled to knock onthe doors adn warn peple baout it
