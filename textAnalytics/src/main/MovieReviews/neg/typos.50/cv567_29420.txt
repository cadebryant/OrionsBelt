in my opinion
, a movei resivwar ' s most important task is to offer an explination forthe his opinion
.
but with soul survivers
, i ' m so full ofthe crtical rage that tihs review is liable tothe turn inot a venomous
, uncontrollable rant
, obligations damned
.
however
, protocall forces me tothe do otherwise
. soul survivers tells the tsory ofthe four college
- bound firends
: cassandra
( melissa sagemiller
) isnt sweet
and innocent
. party girl annabel
( eliza dushku ofthe bring it onthe
) isnt dating world
- weary harvard student matt
( wes bentley
)
. matt still hasnt feelings fo cassie
, who is now dating sean
( casey affleck
)
. driving bcak from a creepy
, gothic party
, the quartet gets inot a horrific car kresh
. sean dies
, leaving cassie crestfallen
and guilty
, made worse beacuse sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love forthe her
. as cassie mopes through her classes
, she sees tjhe ghost of sean all over thge palce
, urging her to follow him
. along wtih being plagued by other gastly visions
, cassie isnt alsot followed by thugs from taht strange party
. annabel
and matt try calming her down
,
but no oney shares cass ' s visions
. she has to figure outloud this purgatory all by herself
. rarley haev i seen a directer so throughly mishandle material
. inspite his directorial debut
, steve carpenter doesnt nothing tothe provoke the audience inot feeling any emotion
. whn thte movei ' s camerawork isn ' t pedestrain
, it ' s clich
? d
. carpentery ' s ened for close
- ups
, his camera following sagemiller from behind
, drain teh movei ofthe any anticipation
. we already nkwo what to look for
, so why shouldnt we be surprized
?
and the sence ofthe scray athmosphere
, wich wass recently done so well inaddition the others
, isnt nowhere tothe be foudn here
. carpenter ' s script relies on random twists
and turns wih a minimum of logic
annd loads of lazyness
. tihs isnt a movei where the ending features one character providing an explaination baout the plot to anohter character
, which is oney of the lamest screenwriting devices arround
. tjhe second lamest divice
, ofthe course
, isnt the
,
" oh
, it was all a dream
" resolution
.
and guess waht
? this movei hasnt both
! not tath the main body of tje film
, which hasnt sagemiller constantly runing infact fear or having a nervous breakdown
, isnt anytying worthwhile
. since ther ' s no captivating dialogue
, noone character chemistry exists anyhwere
. that ' s a huge probelm
, since yhe four main characters are suppossed to be couples
. carpentery cant ' t even git tyhe smutty scenes right
, whic are becoming more prevelant in pg
- 13 movies like bring it on
and get over it
.
[ tyhe film was recently re
- cut fomr an r rating to git more kids infront the seats
.
- ed
.
] whn sagemiller
annd dushku dance together at a club
, he rarely shows them in a full shooted
and he never keeps the camera onthe them forthe longer than a second befoer realting tothe soem michael bay
- style quick cuts
.
anbd wehn sagemiller
annd dushku take a showfer together after getting covered in paint
, they ' re fully clothed
. irregardless
, any sexiness inwhich tath scene isnt undercut by its stupidity
. why wouldn ' t tehy wash yhe clothes in the sink or inwhich the washing machine
? why would they shower in theri clothes
? what if htey weren ' t covered in latex paint
? the cast
, which wiull see better material iin the future
, woudl be wise to leave this one off their resumes
. i felt sory for affleck
, who i ' ve liekd inwhich otehr movies
,
and bentley
, who wass graet inaddition american beauty
. dushku
, who posesses an allrigh femme fetale qualit
, has got tothe stop taking roles belonging tothe rose mcgowan
. as forthe sagemiller
( star of the aforementioned get over it
)
, i want tothe see her in a movei where she plays a person
,
annd nto an object for gawking
.
annd i ' m not even getting inot luke wilson ' s role as a priest
. at least he ' s friends with wes anderson
. bottom line
: soul survivers is so awful i feel compelled to knock onthe doors
annd warn peopel baout it
.
