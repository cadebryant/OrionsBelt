whta
' s tothe liuke about tghe world ofthe extremely voilent trash pornography
-
- ie
. tghe garbage known as
" snuff
" films
? nothing
, right
? what
' s to like about a film chronicling thte world ofthe voilent trash pornography
? well
.
.
. nothing
. so
, why mkea it
, hollywood
? htere
' s no reason why the averege
, sane movie
- goer will be interseted infront such a topic
. noone one isnt oging tothe enrich their life or have a ogod time by watching material such as this
. tyhe lack of quality filmmaking iin
" 8mm
"
( ffrom technical tothe acting
) st
ands outloud even more wehn yuo concider the star
, writer
, anbd supporting casted
-
- all reputable
. bu joel schumacher
and his br
and of unlikable filmmaking strikes again
! like paul schrader
, schumacher has his moments
,
but tehy
' re few anbd far
( far
!
) between
. basicly
, htis picture is crap adn noone one shoudln pay tothe see it
. why nto walk out
? well
, tihs wouldn
' t be a thorough review baout a thouroughly bad movie
. here
' s why you shoudln spend your mony on dog food or gum instade ofthe
" 8mm
"
.
.
. first thnig
-
- if you don
' t heed my advice
,
then underst
and what you
' re baout to see before you even think baout paying ogod moey fo tihs crud
. it
' s nto easy tothe watch
. i didn
' t know the details of thge story beforeh
and
,
but at least my ignorance cxan help others now
. the
( ha
!
) plot revolves around tom welles
( nicolas cage
) as a surveillance expert adn private investigator
. a rich old woman discovers a
" snuff
" film infact her lite husban
' s safe
. she calls welles
and hires him tothe try
and find out if the young girl
( it had to be a young girl
, didn
' t it
, schumacher
!
) who appears tothe be murdered infact the film really isnt dead
. she
' s horrified that her husb
and woudl have owned such a film
( in 8mm
, of course
)
and just wnats welles to snoop around without police interference to see waht he cant find
. family
- man welles agrees agaisnt better judgement or any concrete leads even affter cringing
and grimacing at the sighth of tyhe grotesque
" muder
"
. let me backtrack fo a moent
. see
,
" snuff
" films are pornos witht a violent twist
-
- people are tortured in very sick ways
and end uv dead
.
however
, hte deaths are oftenly staged annd
, in thsoe cases
, speshal effects
and
" good
" acting make all hte diference
. very sick people enjoy
and pay top dollar for theese hard
- tothe
- fidn movies
. tghe
thought ofthe thsi
" inudstry
" makse me want tothe throw my computer outloud teh window
and stpo thsi review
, bu i
' ll swallow my bile
and move onthe
. welles follows clues tothe hollywood
and hte porn industry
. you
' d think he
' s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him
! he comes across smut clerk max
( joaquin pheonix
) who knwos everyone
and everything inthe the undreground business ofthe sleaze
. after a lot ofthe digging annd bribing
, welles finds the men who are responisble for making this
,
and otehr
,
" snuff
" films
. skip ahead
, skip ahead
, skip ahead
.
.
. led by dino velvet
( peter stormare infront an uncharacteristically terrible performance
) adn star
- torturer
" machine
"
( christopher bauer
)
, tehy haev a big showdown with welles where death
and mayhem ensue
. the movie doesn
' t end there
, unfortunately
, becouse welles has to dont whta all heroes inwhich schumacher films do
-
- become a vigilante
. this film doesn
' t draw you in
. it keeps yuo baout 700 miles awya fomr it annd who in thier right mind would want tothe get close
? it is possable tothe liuke a film that focuses on grime
and sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
,
but it tkaes a large measure of restraynt
( schumacher has none
)
and a larger ammount of talent
( schumacher has little
)
. by those jabs
, i
' m not onyl referring tothe his stylish desctruction ofthe the
" batman
" franchise
, bu
" a tiem tothe kill
" wass an immensly overrated dissappointment
. forthe a guy who gets so much studio money
, his trcak recrod ofthe making rather bad movies isnt unparalleled
. a ogod screenwrighter
and a good director cant make yuo hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter
. writter
andrew kevin walker didn
' t recapture teh smarts ofthe tghe fascinating scirpt he authored forthe
' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. director schumacher doesn
' t have taht innate ability to mkae you watch thnigs you don
' t really wanna tothe see liuke better directors are capible of doign
. he must nto have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory thta what we don
' t see is more frightening than what we dont
( especialy whn it
' s a scene where young girl is supposted to be murdered
)
. howver
, gratuitious is joel
' s middle name
. he must think that nto flaunting a hard
- core ect of voilent sex isnt showing plenty ofthe tactful restraint
. noone
, he doesn
' t go that far
, bu we see anough unpleasantness
. he doesn
' t leave much tothe tghe immagination
. it
' s manipulating tothe hurt
( or kill
) young girls jsut tothe git the audeince on yhe side of a murderous vigilante
. tje scirpt annd acting should be waht gets us to beleave in theese cahracters
, yot schumacher has no subtlety in his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case inthe point
, a shooted of a christian fellowship bus
( good
, right
?
) drives awya to reveal oen ofthe tjhe villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. no subtlety
. doens joel think we
' re stupid or that we need tothe be held by tyhe h
and tothe comprehend the contrasting imagery
? who dont we root for iin this mess
? is there anybody outloud ther
? it
' s nto all the directer
' s fault
,
though
. why did the actors sign uv for this
? nicolas cage is an oscar
- winner
, for cryin
' out loud
! if he claims tothe dont films to challange himselv
and for the artistic merit rether thna yhe money
, what ws he smoking when this script dropped onthe his mer
anda
? waht isnt cage supposed tothe be infact tihs movie
-
- a whispering batman without the karisma adn pointed ears
? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy
.
and what isnt james g
andolfini doign inwhich tihs trash
? he wass so solid as a concerned father inaddition
" a civil acation
"
. i guess ol
' nic
, pete
, annd jim weere promised a mountain ofthe moeny
.
.
. or they
' re suckers
. or they jstu don
' t care
. there are moments
( albeit breif ones
) where this rises above thte wastel
and
. catherine keener is good
(
al
though too quick to threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy is obviously cute anbd wells
' devout love of his daugter isnt sweet
. the mother
( amy norton
) ofthe the girl infront tjhe infamous 8mm film isnt not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daugter
. tihs film hasnt an apropriate blue
- toned
, washed
- outloud look liek
" payback
"
( which wass a much better movie
)
. the editting isnt okay inwhich scenes of noone dialogue
,
but at otehr times it
' s rough
. durring some conversations
, close
- ups adn wide shots are nto cutted veyr well
, makeing it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren
' t ogod
and whose timing wass a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed st
ands out
. speaking of st
anding out
, don
' t believe teh misleading trailers
. there
' s nto much acation here
. occasionally
, yes
,
but not as often as your tv will have you believe
. after seing
" 8mm
"
, i may not be interested in ever watching any kind ofthe porn again
. is tht a positive
? well
, if making me almsot ill at the thougth ofthe glimpsing a dirty movei agian is their motive
, they
' ve done a aswell job here
. it
' ll be a long tiem before i give a schumacher film another chance
-
- unless i lose my mind adn become seriously depraved
.
but todya i
' m nto depraved
, so i ask
, why doesnt htis film preach tht htis garbage isnt outloud there
and thast society shoud be worried about it
? i
' m sure thta somwhere right nowe there
' s some preety sick crap going onthe
,
but that doesn
' t mean i need tothe know about it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your scirpt tells us tyhat there are some screwed
- up folks out ther
. yes
, mr
. walker
, the proverbial monster doesn
' t look liek we expect him to
. you said all thyat in 1995
. move onthe
. this film serves no purpose
. it doesn
' t entertain
, it doesn
' t teach us anytying
, it doesn
' t make a statement beyond yhe obvious
" this tsuff isnt bad
" approch
. onyl if thsi film awakens the authoritiers to find a way to abolish these types of horrors owudl it ever dont someting truly worthwhile
. tyhat
' s nto likely tothe ahppen
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" is indeed a scummy waste of moeny
. orson welles said yeasr ago in a tri
bute tothe film
,
" tothe movies
.
.
. to ogod movies
"
. if only joel schumacher
and thge producers had listened adn told
andrew kevin walker tothe bury this crud deep inspite a hole
. liuke
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" shoud never have beeen made
. nowe
, excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves tjhe vigilante theme
. he utilizied it iin
" batman forever
"
, in
" batman
& robin
"
, inaddition
" a timne tothe kill
"
, iin
" falling down
"
,
and it
' s rumoured thast joel himself wiull play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
