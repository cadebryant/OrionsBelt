what ' s tothe like baout the world ofthe extremely violent trash pornography
-
- ie
. hte garbage known as
" snuff
" films
? nothing
, right
? what ' s to liuke about a film chronicling teh world of voilent trash pornography
? well
.
.
. nothing
. so
, why make it
, hollywood
? htere ' s no reason why thte averege
, sane movie
- goer will be interested in such a topic
. no one isnt oging tothe enrich theri life or haev a ogod time by watching material such as this
. tyhe lack of quality filmmaking iin
" 8mm
"
( from technical tothe acting
) stands out even more when yuo consider the star
, writter
,
anbd supporting casted
-
- all reputable
.
bu joel schumacher
anbd his brand ofthe unlikable filmmaking strikes agina
! like paul schrader
, schumacher hasnt his moments
,
but tehy ' re few
adn far
( far
!
) between
. basically
, htis picture is crap
annd no one shouldnt pay tothe see it
. why not walk out
? well
, thsi wouldn ' t be a thorough review baout a throughly bad movie
. here ' s why yuo shoud spend your money onthe dog food or gum instead ofthe
" 8mm
"
.
.
. first hting
-
- if you don ' t heed my advice
,
then understand waht ytou ' re about to see befor ytou even think about paying ogod moey for tihs crud
. it ' s not eazy tothe watch
. i didn ' t nkwo the details of the stor beforehand
,
but at least my ignorance can halp others now
. tghe
( ha
!
) plot revolves around tom welles
( nicolas cage
) as a surveilence expert
and private investigator
. a rich old woman discovers a
" snuff
" film inthe her late husband ' s safe
. she calls welles
anbd hires him to try
adn find outloud if thte young girl
( it had to be a young girl
, didn ' t it
, schumacher
!
) who appears tothe be murdered in thte film really is dead
. she ' s horrified that her husband owudl ahve owned such a film
( inthe 8mm
, of course
)
annd just wants welles to snoop around wihtout polical interference to see what he can fidn
. family
- man welles agrees aginst better judgement or any concrete leads even affter cringing
and grimacing at the sight ofthe the grotesque
" muder
"
. let me backtrack forthe a moment
. see
,
" snuff
" films are pornos wih a violent twist
-
- people are tortured iin vrey sick ways
adn end uv dead
.
however
, tyhe deaths are oftenly staged
and
, inthe thsoe cases
, speshal effects
and
" ogod
" acting mkea all the difference
. very sick peple enjoy
adn pay top doller for these hard
- to
- fidn movies
. tyhe thougth of this
" inudstry
" makse me want tothe throw my computer out the window
anbd stpo htis review
,
but i ' ll swallow my bile
anbd move on
. welles follows clues tothe hollywood
annd the porn industry
. you ' d think he ' s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily fo him
! he comes across smut clerk max
( joaquin pheonix
) who knwos everyone
and everthing in the undreground bussines ofthe sleaze
. aftter a lot ofthe digging
and bribing
, welles finds the men who are responsible forthe makeing this
,
adn otehr
,
" snuff
" films
. skip ahead
, skip ahead
, skip ahead
.
.
. led by dino velvet
( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible peformance
)
anbd star
- torturer
" machine
"
( christopher bauer
)
, they hvae a big showdown withthe welles where death
adn mayhem insue
. yhe movei doesn ' t end htere
, unfortunately
, because welles hasnt tothe dont what all heros in schumacher films do
-
- become a vigilante
. this film doesn ' t draw you in
. it keesh yuo baout 700 miles awya ffrom it
and who in their right mind would whant tothe get close
? it is possible tothe like a film that focuses on grime
anbd sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
,
but it takes a large measure of restraint
( schumacher hasnt none
)
and a larger ammount of talent
( schumacher hasnt little
)
. by those jabs
, i ' m nto only refering to his stylish destruction ofthe hte
" batman
" franchise
,
but
" a time tothe kill
" ws an immensely overrated disappointment
. fo a guy who gets so much studio omney
, his track record of makeing rether bad movies is unparalleled
. a good screenwrighter
and a good director can amking you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter
. writter andrew kevin walker didn ' t recapture teh smarts ofthe the fascinating scirpt he authored for ' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. director schumacher doesn ' t ahve thyat inate abillity tothe make yuo watch things ytou don ' t raelly want to see liuke better directors are capable ofthe doing
. he must nto haev believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don ' t see isnt more frightening thna waht we do
( especially whn it ' s a scene where young girl isnt supposed tothe be murdered
)
.
however
, gratuitous is joel ' s middle nmae
. he must think that nto flaunting a hard
- core ect ofthe violent sex isnt showing plenty of tactful restraunt
. noone
, he doesn ' t go that far
,
but we see enough unpleasantness
. he doesn ' t leave much tothe the imagination
. it ' s manipulating tothe hurt
( or kill
) young girls just tothe git tghe audeince onthe the side ofthe a murderous vigilante
. teh scirpt
and acting shoudln be wqat gets us tothe blieve in these characters
,
yet schumacher hasnt no subtlety inaddition his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case infront point
, a shooted of a christian fellowship bus
( good
, right
?
) drives away tothe reveal oen ofthe the villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. no subtlety
. doens joel thiunk we ' re stupid or taht we ened to be held by the hand to comprehend thge contrasting imagery
? who dont we root forthe inspite htis mess
? is ther anybody out there
? it ' s nto all thte director ' s fault
,
though
. why doed the actors sign uv for this
? nicolas cage is an oscar
- winner
, forthe cryin ' out loud
! if he claimes tothe do films tothe challange himselv
and for the artistic merit rether thna yhe mone
, wqat was he smoking whn thsi script dropped onthe his veranda
? what is cage suppossed tothe be in this movei
-
- a whispering batman without the charisma
and pointed ears
? villainous peter stormare isnt five steps past hammy
.
and what is james gandolfini doign inthe this trash
? he was so solid as a concerned father inwhich
" a civil action
"
. i guess ol ' nic
, pete
,
adn jim weere promised a mountain of money
.
.
. or they ' re suckers
. or they just don ' t care
. ther are moments
( albeit brief ones
) where thsi rises above the wasteland
. catherine keener isnt ogod
(
altough too quick tothe threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy isnt obviously cute
and wells ' devout love of his daugher is sweet
. the mother
( amy norton
) ofthe teh girl inaddition tjhe infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter
. this film hasnt an appropriate blue
- toned
, washed
- outloud look like
" payback
"
( which wass a much better movie
)
. thge editing isnt okay infront scenes of no dialogue
,
bu at otehr times it ' s rough
. durig soem conversations
, close
- ups
anbd wide shots are nto cut veyr well
, makeing it look tothe be editted by somone whose instincts aren ' t good
and whose timing ws a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed stands outloud
. speaking ofthe standing outloud
, don ' t believ the misleading trailers
. htere ' s nto much acation here
. occasionally
, yes
,
bu not as often as your tv will have yuo believe
. after seeing
" 8mm
"
, i may not be interested inspite ever watching any kind ofthe porn agian
. is tyhat a positve
? well
, if making me alomst ill at thge throught of glimpsing a dirty movei again is their motive
, they ' ve done a swell job here
. it ' ll be a long tiem befor i give a schumacher film another chance
-
- unless i lose my mind
adn become seriously depraved
.
but today i ' m not depraved
, so i ask
, why does tihs film preach tyhat thsi garbage isnt out htere
annd that society should be worried baout it
? i ' m sure that somwhere right now htere ' s some preety sick crap gogin onthe
,
bu that doesn ' t mean i ened tothe know about it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your scirpt tells us thgat ther are smoe screwed
- uv folks out htere
. yes
, mr
. walker
, the proverbial monster doesn ' t look liek we expect him tothe
. yuo said all that inspite 1995
. move onthe
. this film serves noone purpose
. it doesn ' t entertain
, it doesn ' t teach us anytying
, it doesn ' t make a statement beyond teh obvious
" htis tsuff isnt bad
" aproach
. onyl if thsi film awakens the authorities tothe find a way to abolish theese types of horrors woudl it ever dont someting truly worthwhile
. thta ' s nto likely to hapen
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" isnt indeed a scummy waste of monay
. orson welles said yersa ago infact a tribute tothe film
,
" tothe movies
.
.
. tothe ogod movies
"
. if onyl joel schumacher
anbd tyhe producers hadnt listened
and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deepo in a hole
. like
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" shouldnt never have beeen made
. now
, excuse me hwile i go try to forget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme
. he utilizied it in
" batman forever
"
, inwhich
" batman
& robin
"
, infact
" a time to kill
"
, in
" falling down
"
,
adn it ' s rumoured taht joel himselv wiull play thge vigilante at his breakfast talbe tomorrow
.
