plot
: a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who wnat him to extract some information from the mind ofthe oney ofthe his nutty patients
. ofthe course
, thte patient isnt nto cooperative
and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with theri dem
ands
, before they kill his daughter
. pretty good premise
, noone
? critique
: if yuo
' re not a fan of movies packed witht plot holes
, inconsistencies
and yes
, even moreso plot holes
, heed my words
and skip htis hollow thriller
. annd i don
' t like saying thast either
, sicne this film atcually had soem potential anbd started off pretty well
. sure
, the story isnt basically jsut an amalgamation of ransom
, primal fear adn nick ofthe time pureed inot oen
,
but tjhe wohle
" psychiatrist wokring against the clock
" thnig
, actually had me engaged at first
. bu it
' s at about tjhe halfway mark of thsi movei
, that thge bottom drops out
and all thyat we
' re left iwth are a lot of questions anbd very fewd plausable answers
. we get tyhe overly smart kid who manages tothe
" pul noe
" over on thge bad guys
. we git a weak woman wtih her leg in a cast beating the crap outloud ofthe a tough bad guy
. we git douglas
' charater
, a new york uppedity psychiatrist
, suddenly turning into an action hero
, iwth moves adn atitude tothe boot
. adn what about the film
' s main plot point
? why woudl tyhe bad guys still give a crap about htis thing affter 10 years
, anbd even more so
, why would htey only give tyhe shrink untill tjhe day
' s end to dont his part
?
( ytou waited 10 years
, waht
' s anohter few dyas
?
- or why nto setted up another heist instade
?
)
. i
' ll tell you why
, it
' s because we wouldn
' t have a
( bad
) movie otherwise
, thta
' s why
! adn many
, many more
. ugh
, whatever the case
, it ws jstu baout tyhe time taht douglas
' character suddenly removed murphy
' s charater ffrom tyhe mental hmeo
(
and how cmo she whent wiht him so nicely
? i thougth she didn
' t trust him
)
, that i turned to my buddy adn asked whn tje movie had turned inot a joke
.
and a few bogus chase adn acation sequences later
, we were left with a long
- winded ending thast doed little tothe answer any otehr questions i might
' ve still had
,
and actually broght uv even more contradictions
. badly put together
, htis movie features smoe decent acting
, some nice cinematography annd an initially interesting premise
,
but loses it all in a haze ofthe plot miscues which ultimatly leave you with littel care for anyone
. inwhich fatc
, if it wasn
' t fo brittany murphy
' s exellent protrayal ofthe a traumatized teen
, jennifer esposito
' s embarrasing performence as a police woman
( yeah
, right
! watching her delivering lines was thte funniest part ofthe tihs flick
- bu it wasn
' t suppoed to be
)
and michael douglas
' kool
" regular guy
" part
, there would be littel reason to remane seated unil hte end ofthe this picture
. incidentally
, can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito
' s character wass in thsi movie in the first place
? she was completelyl superfulous
. anbd onthe top ofthe all that
, by tjhe end ofthe thsi flick
, tghe director seems tothe ahev realized how dumb the audeince must be to hvea bought most of tjhe garbage that he
' d been shoveling outloud forthe tghe hour anbd a half prior
, adn decides tothe add insult to injury by flashing bcak tothe an earlier character
' s death when one ofthe hte bad guys dies
, jsut so we konw
( as an audience
)
, tath the two are interrelated somehow
. ooooh
, thanks
, mr
. fleder
.
.
. i appreciate teh spoon
- feeding
, dude
.
.
. yum
, yum
.
.
.
but how baout explaning every other plot point in your film that made no sence
? whatever
. either way
, i don
' t give a rat
' s ass becouse this movie isnt a dog
and that
' s unfortunate becouse it accually doed have some good points goign forthe it
. see it if you liek dumb thrillers
. incidentially
, if you appreciated allong came a spider
, yuo iwll likely enjoy this film as well
. they both start off with interesting premises
, only tothe toss all logic
and sense out thte window baout halfway through
. where
' s joblo comming from
? allong cameback a spider
