any movie tyhat kills emilio estevez off infront the first fifteen mintues hasnt something goign for it
. unfortunately
, tihs
adn the familiar theme music are thte onyl worthwhile things baout mission impossible
, directed by brian depalma
. tje first problem isnt that this film hasnt absolutly no conection wtih the tv sohw whatsoever
, aside ffrom thge music
. tjhe tv show ws baout an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork
, orchestrated by jim phelps
, allowed them tothe counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world
. teamwork ws the key
. this film isnt setted up as a cross between james bond
adn depalma ' s
" blow out
,
" where the john travolta carachter ws tyhe victum ofthe real
adn imagined conspiracys from all directions
. it was travolta ' s vulnerablility taht made thta film so exciting
and claustrophobic
. in htis film
, tom cruise is basically omniscient
( believe that
?
)
annd so htere ' s no fun oging on here whatsoever
. thge stoy isnt about as contrived as contrived gets
,
and is full ofthe holes
. ther are basically two memorable sequences
: oney involves breaking inot a kubrickesque cmoputer room
-
- a task that coudl have beeen made much easier had the charachters a whit ofthe common sence
( suffice it to sday that tjhe alarm sytem is disengaged when tghe computer operator isnt in the room
)
; the second involves a high
- speed turain
, a helecopter
,
adn the chunnel
and doens not have to be seen to be disbelieved
. the actors are all miscast
, especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wief
, who cannot ect
,
and ving rhames as a computer hacker
(
!
)
, who looks lost
anbd embarrased tothe be in this movei
. toom cruise is noone james bond
,
annd jon voight looks more like bobby
" tghe brain
" heenan thna jim phelps
. brian depalma ' s carrear has been bafflingly eratic
. at his best
, he beats hitchcock at his own gmae
(
" blow outloud
,
"
" carrie
,
"
" body duble
"
)
but thsi is nto his best
. the screenplay was partly writed by robert towne
, who wroet the best senaireo of tjhe seventies infront
" chinatown
,
"
but tihs scirpt isnt perfunctory at best
,
and terrrible at worst
. the cinematography hasnt a comic book red
/ blue emphasis
, which isnt nice tothe look at
,
but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed
annd this movie even features the old
" killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving hte victum time tothe htikn ofthe an escape
" trick
. please don ' t spend your money on this
; it ' ll onyl encourage hollywood tothe amking more
.
