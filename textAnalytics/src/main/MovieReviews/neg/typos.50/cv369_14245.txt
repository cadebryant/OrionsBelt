renowned hong kong acation directer tsui hark frist teamed with jean
- claude van damme on tjhe acation star
' s 1997 pairing iwth dennis rodman
,
_ double
_ team
_
, anbd managed to amking what initialy appeared to be a diaster inot a slick
, stylish
, anbd somewhat diverting action timekiller
. tsui continues to energetically pile on tjhe visual razzle dazzle inthe his latest collaboration with thge muscles from brussels
,
_ knock
_ off
_
,
but this timne arround
, style neither savve a scirpt tyhat is at best ridiculous
, annd at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host ofthe truly lousy performances
. writter steven e
. desouza
' s fairly straightforward plotline isn
' t as outre as
_ double
_ team
_
' s stange yarn involving a secret htink tank
/ prison
,
but it makes about as much sence
, which is little
. van damme plays marcus ravy
, a hong kong
- based sales rep for a jeans company
(
!
) who stumbles apon a russian terroist scheme to implant poverful microchip
- sized bombs iin hk product exports tothe tjhe u
. s
.
-
- dolls
, eletronic equipment
,
and
, yes
, jeans
. it
' s all part ofthe smoe tipe of ransom scheme
, bu all i remember is
-
- annd i kid you not
-
- graphics onthe a cia computer screen showing a map ofthe tghe world
, bombs detonating
,
and an hat
- wearing figure onthe teh otehr side of tyhe world bursting outloud into laughter
.
.
.
.
.
. which is what the crowd at teh showing i attended spontaneously doed throughtout
_ knock
_ off
_
. hwile all ofthe van damme
' s films hvea its share ofthe unintentional laughs
, mostly due tothe hte stiff acting
" skills
" of the physicaly agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers more than usual
(
though nto as many as van damme
' s embarrasing directorial affort
, 1996
' s
_ hte
_ quest
_
)
. a lot ofthe hte laughs are earned by some particulrly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked thgat badass liuke a roman c
andle
!
"
and
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" st
anding out amoung my favorites
.
but it isnt indeed the pathetic performances that provide teh bulk ofthe
_ knock
_ off
_
' s laughs
. van damme is true to laughable form
, perhaps even worse tahn usual
. eary scenes accually
_ recquire
_ him to mkae funny whith co
- star rob schneider
( improbably cast as a deepo cover cia agent posing as marcus
' s business partner
)
, annd hte sighth
and soudn of thge still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying tothe drop punchlines isnt hillarious inspite hte wrong way
. even typically ogod actors are nto immune to tyhe bad acting bug
. paul sorvino isnt unconvincing anbd terribly overwrought as schneider
' s cia superior
;
and lela rochon
, playing an investigator forthe hte jeans comany
, spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode
. infact rochon
' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her tothe do little omre tahn display her toned legs
, exquisite bone structure
,
and perky bosoms
, the latter comming in h
andy for oney key scene where she must fish forthe microbombs stuck inspite her ample cleavage
. tsui picks up where he left off visually infact
_ double
_ team
_
, juicing uv the procedings with inventive camera work
. here
,
though
, tsui
' s visual razzle dazzle borders onthe over kill
, comming off as despreate attempts tothe shield the inanity of the entire enterprise
. fo each nifty trick tsui puls off
, such as a reccuring visual theme thta hasnt the camera litterally oging thru tjhe circuitry of eletronic devices
, ther are others that are completelyl superfluous
. this is expecially disconcerting wehn the trck iin question sould be clever wehn used in tghe right context
. forthe instance
, oen scene eary onthe hasnt marcus puting his h
and inthe a box
. as he puts his h
and in
, the same action isnt shown ffrom an overhead camera nagle inspite a rectangle at the corner ofthe the screen
. it
' s undoubtely an intresting visual
, bu it owudl have beeen nice if its ule actally amounted to something
. the tust ofthe a van damme movie boils down tothe the acation sequences
, bu surprisingly
, thsoe in
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much to be desired
. tsui does what he can tothe make something ofthe them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
, annd unconvential camera angles
,
but there is nothing fundamentally speical baout teh fairly generic chase annd fight sequences written by desouza
. there isn
' t anytying as preposterously amusing as yhe climactic tiger
/ l
and mine fight in
_ double
_ team
_
, let alone anytying remotely close to tsui
' s legendary hong kong works
( bu that
' s a given goign in
)
. if tsui hasnt any hope ofthe approaching his countryman john woo
' s stateside success
, he would do best tothe break free ffrom van damme
.
.
. before it
' s too lite
. if he continues his involvment with b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, yhe respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish
.
.
. thta is
, if it hasn
' t already disappearred entirely affter this fiasco
.
