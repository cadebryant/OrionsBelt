renowned hong kong acation directer tsui hark first teamed with jean
- claude van damme onthe hte action star ' s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman
,
_ double
_ team
_
,
annd managed to make waht initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick
, stylish
,
and somewhat diverting acation timekiller
. tsui continues tothe energetically pile onthe the visual razzle dazzle inthe his latest collaboration withthe the muscles from brussels
,
_ knock
_ off
_
,
but thsi tyme around
, stlye niether savve a script that is at best rediculous
,
adn at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host ofthe truly lousy performances
. writter steven e
. desouza ' s fairly straightforward plotline isn ' t as outre as
_ doublely
_ team
_ ' s strange yern involving a secret thiunk tank
/ prision
,
but it makse about as much sence
, which isnt little
. van damme plays marcus ray
, a hong kong
- based sales rep for a jeans company
(
!
) who stumbles apon a russian terroist scheme to implant powerful microchip
- sized bombs inspite hk product exports to the u
. s
.
-
- dolls
, electronic equipemnt
,
and
, yes
, jeans
. it ' s all part ofthe soem type of ransom scheme
,
bu all i remeber is
-
-
adn i kid yuo not
-
- graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of tjhe world
, bombs detonating
,
adn an hat
- wearing figure onthe yhe otehr side ofthe the world bursting outloud inot laughter
.
.
.
.
.
. hwihc isnt what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout
_ knock
_ off
_
. hwile all of van damme ' s films hvae its share of unintentional laughs
, mostly due to the stiff acting
" skills
" of the physically agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers mroe thna usual
(
though nto as many as van damme ' s embarrassing directorial affort
, 1996 ' s
_ the
_ quest
_
)
. a lot ofthe yhe laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked that badass liek a roman candle
!
"
annd
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" standing outloud amonst my favorites
.
bu it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide tjhe bulk of
_ knock
_ off
_ ' s laughs
. van damme is true tothe laughable form
, perphas even worse thna usual
. eearly scenes actually
_ recquire
_ him to amke funny whith co
- star rob schneider
( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus ' s business partner
)
,
and the sight
and sound of thte still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying tothe drop punchlines isnt hillarious in the wrong way
. even typically good actors are nto immune to yhe bad acting bug
. paul sorvino is unconvincing
and terribly overwrought as schneider ' s cia superior
;
adn lela rochon
, palying an investigator fo the jeans comany
, spends the entire movie iin perpetual snarl mode
. in rochon ' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her to do little more tahn display her toned legs
, exquisite bone sturcture
,
adn perky bosoms
, the latter comming in handy fo one key scene where she must fish fo microbombs stuck infact her ample cleavage
. tsui picks uv where he left off visually in
_ doulbe
_ team
_
, juicing up thte procedings with inventive camera work
. here
,
though
, tsui ' s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill
, coming off as despertae attemts tothe sheild hte inanity ofthe the entire enterprise
. forthe each nifty trick tsui pulls off
, such as a recurring visual theme tht hasnt the camera litterally oging thru the circuitry of eletronic devices
, ther are others that are completely superfulous
. this is especially disconcerting when tyhe trck inspite question sould be clever whn utilisied in hte right context
. for instatance
, one scene eearly onthe hasnt marcus putting his hand inwhich a box
. as he puts his hand in
, thte smae action is shown fomr an overhead camera agnle in a rectangle at the corner of thte screen
. it ' s undoubtedly an intresting visual
,
bu it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something
. hte tust of a van damme movei boils down to the action sequences
,
bu surprizingly
, thsoe inspite
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much to be desired
. tsui does whta he cin tothe make something ofthe them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
,
and unconventional camera angles
,
but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase
and fight sequences written by desouza
. ther isn ' t anytying as preposterously amusing as tjhe climactic tiger
/ land mine fight inthe
_ double
_ team
_
, let alone anytying remotely close to tsui ' s legendary hong kong works
(
bu that ' s a given gonig infront
)
. if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo ' s stateside succsess
, he owudl dont best to break free from van damme
.
.
. before it ' s too lite
. if he continues his involvement wiht b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, the respect he has ffrom hk action fans iwll continue to diminish
.
.
. that isnt
, if it hasn ' t already disappearred entirely after this fiasco
.
