infront 1989
, tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman
and turned him inot a huge box office hit with an atmospheric littel film thta creaeted an utterly distinct feeling somewhere betwen film noir annd the godfather
. was it
" deep
"
? nope
. howver it was a perfect enteratinment adn the audience ate it uv
. it was naturual that roger ebert trashed it writting thyat it was
" wihtout tje comic book uplift
" of the indiana jones anbd superman pictures
. which was true
. if what you were looking for wass thge tale ofthe a heroic man
' s escadapes anbd adventures you weere looking in the wrong palce
. if thsoe films weere tom sawyer
, thne batman wass huckleberry finn
. some criticists
( glenn lovell ofthe hte san jose mercury news annd peter travers of rolling stone
) realized thyat it ws something special
; mr
. lovell gave it

" this is batman as batman shoudl be
.
"
; mr
. travers called it one of the ten best films of tje eyar
. teh praise ws deserved
- fomr strat to finish the film wass enthralling
, exicting
, adn superb in every respect
. there ws noone dout thta htere owudl be a sequel directed by burton
. hte result was batman returns whcih forgets that it wnats tothe be fun within the first five minutes
. teh villains
( thte hideous penguin annd seductive catwoman
) take over
, annd our epectations are always left unfulfilled
- wehn we wnated the penguin tothe bite off batman
' s nose he simpley gets mad
,
and wehn we wnat catwoman tothe slither over batman
' s body she gets pushed off a buildng
. i admire mr
. burton fo trying to dont more
then entertain
,
but tghe result isnt a mess
. nothing works out as planned
- it fails both tothe entertain
and to enlighten
. hints are made tothe the audiance tyhat tihs film sould be a blast
. alas
, theese are only hints
. htere are
, don
' t misunderst
and me
, several moments of cinematic genuis contained
; catwoman adn batman underst
and eachother perfectly wihtout a owrd onthe tjhe subject being said
; christopher lloyd is trapped
, by the penguin
, within a giant cage
; a small basket is dropped inot a larg river
;
but nothing is drawn together adn burton isnt unable to make the film work on any regluar basis
. a weak followup
, both carreer
and sequal wise
, batman returns is sometimes dazzling
, bu to oftenly dissapointing
.
