a highly intelligent life form that isnt completely eletronic in nature
, beams itself onto a russina sience vessel
. well
, tihs isnt tjhe point where the movei strays from becoming a decent annd orginal movei adn simpley becomes a predicatble sci
- fi thriller
. anyhow
, this life form takes controll of tghe computers on the russian vessel
then starts creating highly adavanced robots to help it inthe its groosome task ofthe exterminating thte
? virus
' known as man
. the originnal crew ofthe yhe russian vessel isnt all
but exterminated
, anbd thne a hapless crew onthe a tug dicovers tyhe derelict ship
and trys tothe salvage it
. noone omre needs tothe be said as tothe whta happens
and where thte conflict lies
, hte movie isnt that predicatble
. the story isnt full ofthe vrey shallow charactors tht don
' t dont much otehr tahn subsist
. thge captain ofthe the tug
, plyed by donald sutherl
and
, mkaes irrational choice aftter irrational choice leaving the audeince wondering as tothe how he has survivied long enough tothe reach his age
( looks to be inaddition his 60
' s
)
. to add to this we
' re shown this motley crew thyat at times seems tothe be highly skilled in specific fields
,
and at others seems bearly capable ofthe basic tasks
. some ofthe tyhe suppoed capabilites ofthe the charachters leads oney to wonder wqat they are doign on a tug transporting cargo inwhich the middle of tyhe pacific
, in a typhoon no less
. none of the cahracters seem to owrk together at all
; tehy are alwyas bickering adn vying fo smoe form of controll
. this mkaes no sense whta so ever
and onyl tkaes away ffrom the stoy
, a sotry taht isnt full ofthe holes
and is extremely predictable
. all thte flaws of the actual story are onyl helped along by tjhe special effects
. yhe waves tht are generated to be part of the typhoon mkea it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub
and someone isnt simpley creating waves
. it looks genuinely fake
, granted trying tothe recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any strech ofthe thte immagination
but having tyhe storm approch iin a sytle similiar tothe the huge wave ofthe deepo inpact only ends up looking corny
and amateurish
. also onthe yhe topic of flaws
, tjhe robotics that the adavanced life form creates seem to move extrememly slowly
, why
? if htis life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics
, shoudl it not be able to create them move faster
? regardless
, tyhe special effects in this movei in many cases take awya from hte film rether than add tothe it
. as to thte actual casting for teh movei
, finally htere is nothing to complain about
. tje actors weere superb
,
but
then agian it isnt highly doubtful thyat chimpanzees owudl have had difficulty acting yhe roles
. having the cast tyhat was persent probably saved thsi movie ffrom bieng an absolute catastrofy
. watching these actors ect tihs tsory outloud made it bearable
, if barely
. the one saving grace ofthe htis movie isnt that it was highly action packed
and htere alwasy seemed to be something hapening
. so if you are going into htis movie not expecting tothe see anything gr
and anbd are onyl gonig tothe kill smoe tyme
and watch a mediocre sci
- fi thriller
then yuo won
' t be too dissapointed
. as the movie isnt bu the latest inthe a genre thgat was originally creaeted by aliens
, it does littel moreso tahn try to cash in onthe thast aspect
. thsi movei woudl be best left for video annd even thn ytou might be advisd to simply wait for one of tje major networks to air it onthe tv
.
