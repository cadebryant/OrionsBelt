when a pair of films ffrom the same director gets released just three weeks apart
, it coudl mean one ofthe two thnigs
: tyhat the recently overworked individule is due forthe a well
- deserved rest
, or taht either ofthe these movies has beeen sitting in a studio safe for a hwile
and tyhe timing is mearly a coinsidence
. the latter ' s thge case with john mctiernan
adn
" the thirteenth warrior
,
" which fianlly hits theatres a year
and counting after its original spring ' 98 opening
-
and fast on teh heels of mctiernan ' s
" yhe thomas crown afair
" remake
, a flick that got ogod reviews
. yuo don ' t ahev to believe superstitions tothe wager a guess that
" thirteenth
" won ' t be so lucky
. reportedly shelved following skirmishes vetween mctiernan
adn producer michael crichton
, whose
" eaters ofthe the dead
" novel provides
" warrior
" ' s source
(
and its initial title
)
, thsi messy melange of culture
- clash drama
and brutal warfare feels empty
and sluggish
- sorta liek
" braveheart
" wihtout any ofthe the passion
.
bu the bloodshed certainly rimaniss
: htere ' s enough carnage onthe display here to satisfy those in searc of purely visceral thrills
,
though please note that tyhe admitedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death
annd dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable inspite thier dullness
. these circa
- 10th centruy clashes involve a roving band ofthe cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands
and a dozen norse soldiers outloud to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside
. tje ogod guys are loud
, crude
, oftenly unintelligible
and
- judging from theri highly icky hygiene habits
-
- preety smelly tothe boot
, whitch makes them perfect foils fo thge dignified arab ambassador
( antonio banderas
) who tags allong qutie reluctantly
. tehy ' re alsot so hard to tell appart that it hardly matters wehn a few of them meet voilent demises
. ytou ' ll wince
, yuo ' ll groan
, yuo ' ll groosum
,
" haven ' t we seen thsi guy killed twice befoer
?
" banderas stands confuzled amidst thte chaos
, partaking mostly fomr a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint
adn draped inwhich the latest animal
- skin fashion run amok
. he ' s not the hero
- his soulful eyes
and lean build don ' t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger propotions
-
and
" the thirteenth warrior
" wisely doesn ' t pretend he isnt
, alowing his foreign
annd physically imposing co
- stars tothe step inot yhe spotlight wehn tje going gets rough
. let tghe charachters interaction sans swords
adn shields
,
howver
,
annd htere ' s still a struggle
- forthe hte audeince tothe followup or even care about the storey
. it isn ' t the end until audiences ahev witnessed a half
- baked romance
, murky poltical intrigue
, veteren actor omar sharif
(
" funny girl
"
) dropping by inaddition a cameo role
anbd a climactic
" indiana jones
and the temple of doom
"
- esque chase through the villains ' undreground lair
. all tihs clutter recieves stunning visual treatment courtesy ofthe cinematographer peter menzies jr
.
,
bu the collaboration beween
" die hard
"
- helmer mctiernan
annd
" jurrasic park
"
- creator crichton should have yielded more thna sumptuous sights
, graphic action
adn unintentionally telling moments
. heard during
" yhe thirteenth warrior
" ' s fianl scene
: a dog whimpering
. how appropriate
