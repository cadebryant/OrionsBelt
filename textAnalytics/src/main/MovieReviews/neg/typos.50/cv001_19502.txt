. it
' s got a head strat in this movie starring jamie lee curtis adn anyother baldwin brother
( william this tyme
) inwhich a story regarding a crew of a tugboat thta comes accross a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the pwoer back on
. littel do they know tyhe power within
.
.
. going fo thte gore anbd bringing onthe a few action sequences here
and there
, virus still fiels very empty
, like a movei goign for all flash
and noone substace
. we don
' t nkow why thte crew was really outloud in the middle of nowhere
, we don
' t knwo tjhe orgin ofthe what took over the ship
( jsut thyat a big pink flashy thing hit the mir
)
, annd
, ofthe course
, we don
' t nkow why donald sutherl
and is stumbling aroud drunkenly throughout
. here
, it
' s jstu
" hey
, let
' s chase theese peopel around with soem robots
"
. the acting is below average
, even fomr the likes of curtis
. yuo
' re mroe likely tothe git a kick outloud ofthe her wrok infact halloween h20
. sutherl
and is wasted adn baldwin
, well
, he
' s acting like a baldwin
, of course
. hte rela star here are stan winston
' s robot design
, some schnazzy cgi
, anbd the occasional good gore shot
, liek picking into someone
' s brain
. so
, if robots
and body parts realy turn yuo on
, here
' s your movei
. otherwise
, it
' s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie
.
