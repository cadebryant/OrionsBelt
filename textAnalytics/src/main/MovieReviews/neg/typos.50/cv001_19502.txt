the happy bastard ' s quick movie review damn that y2k bug
. it ' s got a head strat inthe htis movei starring jamie lee curtis
and anohter baldwin brother
( william this tyme
) in a story regarding a crew ofthe a tugboat tyhat comes across a deserted russian tech ship thgat has a strangeness to it wehn they kick the pwoer bakc on
. littel dont they nkwo thge power withing
.
.
. gogin for the gore
and bringing on a few acation sequences here
and ther
, virus still fiels vyer empty
, liek a movie going forthe all flash
and noone substance
. we don ' t nkwo why tghe crew ws really out iin the middle ofthe nowhere
, we don ' t know the orgin ofthe wqat tookover over tjhe ship
( just thast a big pink flashy thing hitted tjhe mir
)
,
adn
, of course
, we don ' t nkwo why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout
. here
, it ' s just
" hey
, let ' s chase theese people around wtih soem robots
"
. the acting is below averege
, even from tghe likes of curtis
. you ' re more likely tothe git a kick out ofthe her wrok in hlaloween h20
. sutherland is wasted
adn baldwin
, well
, he ' s acting like a baldwin
, ofthe course
. teh real star here are stan winston ' s robot desgin
, smoe schnazzy cgi
,
annd tghe ocasional ogod gore shooted
, like picking into somone ' s brain
. so
, if robots
and body parts realy turn you onthe
, here ' s your movei
. otherwise
, it ' s pretty much a sunken ship of a movei
.
