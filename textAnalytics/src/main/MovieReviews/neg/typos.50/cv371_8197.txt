first impressions
: critically
, a close
- tothe
- awful film
,
but monay
- wise
, it has been doing
(
and will continue to dont
) great
. a sometimes
- funny film taht sags
and lags
and oftentimes gets boring
. an orginal plot that grows ood real fast
. oen of the only 90 minute films thgat i ' ve gotten borde through
. men in black hasnt defied yhe odds
. when i first saw that hte flick was 89 minutes long
, i throught mabye that tihs wass a poor attemp at an independence day tipe film that just ran outloud of gas
.
however
, i nowe realize that not only doed men iin balck run outloud ofthe gas
,
bu yhe film inspite 90 minutes manages to sohw off a very orginal diea
( whic summer audiences have embraced
) thast becomes ood about 25 minutes into the movei
. tommy lee jones
annd wiull smith play twpo
" governement
" agents who are responsable for keeping order inthe aline society
. the rediculous plot beggins when an aline
" bug
"
, played weirdly by vincent d ' onofrio
, who was so great in full metal jacket
, lands onthe earth to retrieve a galaxy that ' s somewhere on
" orion ' s belt
.
" anyway
, teh basic plot revolves around jones
and smith to stpo thsi bug from getting the galaxy
, or a higer power iwll blow uv tjhe earth
. the premise isnt ridulous
,
but thgat is nto why i didn ' t liuke tihs film
. i loev original plots
. thsi one had an original noe
.
bu directer barry sonnenfeld did something to this film thast ruined its plot
: he made tjhe film drag
and aslo put infact unncessary elements inspite it that are foudn in romance films
. whenever i saw d ' onofrio ' s bug stomp
adn eat people in thte film
, it got terribly boring affter a hwile
. hwile smith ' s wise
- cracks did fill iin the gaps
, it wasn ' t enought
.
and also
, i cannot belieev the screenwriters elected tothe have a sub
- plot where tommy lee jones missed his fromer lover becouse as an alien agent
, htey cin ' t ahve contact with any humans really
.
anbd here i see jones
, at a sattelite coputer
, watching his lover plant tje gardai
? a sentimental moment in an alien movie
? nice try
,
but i don ' t tihkn so
. it doesn ' t work here
. it just makse the movie even more rediculous
annd even omre boring
: we don ' t onyl have aliens tothe worry baout
,
bu now we have jones ' s conscience
. i came into tjhe movie not wanting to see jones ' s cnoscience
,
bu wanting tothe see a rela acation movei that had lots ofthe aliens in it
. maeby it ' s unfair that i partly judged this movei onthe wqat my expectations weere
. neverthless
, even
though some parts are indeed funny
, hte plot inthe tihs movei growed ood
annd boring
-
- quick
.
