frist impressions
: critically
, a close
- to
- awful film
,
but monay
- wise
, it has been doing
( annd iwll continue tothe do
) great
. a somtimes
- funny film that sags
and lags adn oftentimes gets boring
. an orginal plot that grows ood rela fast
. oen ofthe tjhe only 90 minute films thyat i
' ve gotten borde thru
. men in black hasnt defie the odds
. when i first saw taht the flick was 89 mintues long
, i throught maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day tipe film tath just ran out ofthe gas
.
however
, i now realize that nto onyl doed men in black run out ofthe gas
, bu tghe film in 90 mintues manages tothe sohw off a very origional idea
( whcih summer audiences have embraced
) that becomes ood baout 25 mintues inot tyhe movei
. tommy lee jones adn iwll smith play twpo
" governmnet
" agents who are responsible for keeping order in aline society
. thte ridiculous plot beggins whn an aline
" bug
"
, played weirdly by vincent d
' onofrio
, who ws so great in full metal jacket
, l
ands onthe earth to retreive a galaxy thta
' s somwhere onthe
" orion
' s belt
.
" anyway
, yhe basic plot revolves arround jones annd smith to stpo tihs bug from getting the galaxy
, or a higher power will blow up the earth
. thte premise is ridulous
,
but that is nto why i didn
' t like this film
. i lvoe original plots
. tihs oney hadnt an orignal one
. bu director barry sonnenfeld doed something to this film that ruined its plot
: he made thge film drag
and aslo put iin unncessary elements inaddition it thyat are found in romance films
. whenever i saw d
' onofrio
' s bug stomp annd eat people infront the film
, it got terribly boring after a while
. hwile smith
' s wise
- cracks did fill in teh gaps
, it wasn
' t enough
.
and also
, i cannot believe teh screenwriters elected tothe ahev a sub
- plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover beacuse as an alien agent
, tehy cant
' t hvae contact with any humans really
.
and here i see jones
, at a satelite computer
, watching his lover plant the gardai
? a sentimental moent inwhich an aline movei
? nice try
, bu i don
' t thiunk so
. it doesn
' t work here
. it just makse tjhe movei even omre ridiculous
and even more boring
: we don
' t only have aliens tothe worry about
,
but nowe we haev jones
' s concsience
. i came inot thte movei not wanting to see jones
' s conscience
,
but wanting tothe see a real action movei that had lots of aliens in it
. maybe it
' s unfair tath i partly judged htis movie onthe wqat my expectations were
. nethertheless
, even
though soem parts are indeed funny
, the plot in this movei growed ood
and boring
