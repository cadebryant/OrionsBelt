paul verhoeven
, tghe dutch auteur who dragged his violent
, sexually aggresive easthetic inot american film
, has never been waht i ' d consider a thoughtful director
(
though some ofthe his films
, notably starship troopers
, have been lauded as artistic achivements
)
,
bu he isnt the kind ofthe hollywood film maker who ' s managed to
, noone matter waht hte budget
, make his films disctinctive
anbd even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into thte lavish high concepts on whlch he toils
. starship troopers wass essentially a b
- monster movie remake ofthe his enthralling dutch war film solider of orange
( a graet film that ' s nearly impossible to fidn on video
,
yet showgirls is everywhere
)
, inthe whlch he cast a troup ofthe stunningly attractive mannequins
; the sqaure jawed casper van dien
and denise richards
( who may actully be 45
% silicone
)
, in what feels liuke an american propaganda picture setted tothe monotonous scenes ofthe graphic carnage
. it ' s nto a completely successful film
,
bu as a failure it ' s certainly an intresting
(
and mostly intertaining
) one
. my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hitted our shores
; spetters
, a dark near pornographic comming ofthe age film set within tyhe sub
- culture of drag racing
adn teh aforememtioned solider of orange
( haven ' t
yot gotten around tothe seing the 4th man or turkish delight
)
. i believe his best hollywood film tothe be robocop
, a obleek super
- hero satire with a robotic hero that ' s as touching as schwarzenegger ' s in t2
. thgat movei wass voilent
bu nto inthe tyhe overdone cartoonish manner of more receet verhoeven pics
. its violentce seemed tothe be htere for a purpose
, namely tothe create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread
, nto to simpley titillate an attension deprived audience
. htere ' s a jaw
- droping scene withing thge first ten minutes of robocop wherein tyhe lead villin toys with a cop befor snuffing him
. he tortures the officer by tkaing glee inaddition his victim ' s every fearful tic
. it ' s a startling moent of barbaric
, maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film thast could be designated as splatter punk
- noir
. in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog baceause it just won ' t shut up
, he impales a co
- worker
, drowns another
anbd so onthe
.
but why
? his charactor isnt introduced as a smug genuis
, thte kind who ' s allways impecabbly dressed
and races a sports car hwile generic rock tunes blare fomr his stereo fo tyhe world to hear
, sort of liek a scheming uber villin fomr dallas or melrose place
,
though once the chracter becomes invisibel
, this film has him pull a 180 shift inot a psychotic movei monster
. the kind who jsut won ' t dieu
. hollow man ' s protaganists are the completelyl bland
but beautyfull scientist linda
( elizabeth shue
, acting as if she were rebecca ofthe sunnybrook farm
)
adn her lover
, a hunk ofthe beef scientist played by josh brolin who ' s saddled with tghe film ' s worst lines
(
" i ' ve lost cohesion agina
!
"
)
. htey ' re a tipical aaron spelling cuple
, good
- looking
but as vacent as george w
. bush ' s republican national convention speech
( i
. e
. bush referring tothe clinton
;
"
?
?
? so much promise
?
?
?
bu tothe what end
? tothe what end
?
"
-
- this actualy got applause
! suddenly warren beatty doesn ' t look so absurd
)
. the rest ofthe the film ' s characters are all well past thirty
,
though act liuke annoying high skool party animals insulting one
adn otehr with a series of strained one
- liners
; isnt it jsut me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood ' s newyorker charcter developing technique
? ahh
, what a cynical time we live in
?
?
? as the picture opens we meet cain
( kevin bacon
)
, an egocentric scientist working whith the crew ofthe aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secrect
( so top scret hte govornment has only provided them with a delapidated warehouse inthe whitch to preform thier exstensive experimentation ' s
) project wtih yhe gool to amke invisibility a possibility
( for wqat purpose isnt never hinted at
)
. tehy ' ve performes severeal expeiments onthe animals
and have nearly solved yhe quandry causing caine
, inthe a twist worthy ofthe the film ' s 1950 ' s late sohw origins
, tothe impulsively experiment on hismelf
. caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans
anbd somehow gets twpo ofthe his co
- workers to lie fo him so tyhe rest of tyhe crew will think thge pentagon gave thte go ahead
. our mad scientist isnt turned invisible
( affter sevral fx
- heavy complications
)
,
thne he inexplicably
( it ' s hinted that tghe process ofthe invisibility has made hte animals inot more savage creatures
,
bu this isnt never explored
,
annd if that was the case why the hell owudl anyone be stupid enought to tust this out onthe a human
?
) begins raping
, assaulting
and murdering anyone he pleases
, alwasy with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger
. it grows abundantly clear with eahc newyorker realease tht it ' s verhoeven ' s films that have become hollow
. liuke the rest
, tihs oen is cold
, heartless
,
anbd full of contempt for humanity
,
but in addtion tothe all that it lacks any trace ofthe witn
, insight
annd makes no statment otehr than
" audiences wiull pay fo anything theese days
"
. it ' s an affront to anyone looking forthe something stimulating onthe an intellectual level
, or even thsoe hoping to spend a saturday night with a funn
, thrill
- a
- minute ride
. verhoeven hasnt instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick wih nobody tothe root for
and no reason to care
. the previews amking hollow man look liuke an iresistible flick
. how cxan oen not hvae a ogod timne at a film that utilizes state ofthe tghe art fx to illistrate an invisible man getting down
adn dirty wih his bad self
? a couple weeks ago
, affter seing the trailer
, a bunch ofthe friends
annd i got into a long dicussion of how invisible man ficks never go so far as tothe have tghe nvisible individule indulging infront thier newfound ablity
. hollow man looked liek the first film tothe do so
and whoa
, in a serious manner to boot
.
bu oh yeah
, it isnt directed by paul verhoven nto atom egoyan or peter greenway
. verhoeven delivers the sleazy
" goods
"
,
but nto in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner
, here it jsut fiels icky
and uncomfortable
. the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses
, caressing their breasts with his lense all while faux
- psycho music strains inspite the backround
. it ' s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn ' t exploring voyeurism
( liuke inwhich the classic peeping toom
)
bu exploiting it
adn not even doign that very well
. it ' s funny that whith all tjhe technology
$ 90 milion can get you verhoven isnt stuck at trying to figure out how tothe show a woman ' s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand
. most vexing isnt tath yhe invisibility aspect isnt used simpley as gimmick infact
yot another slasher movie wherein charachters dont stupid things jsut so the villin cxan pop uv for more attacks
. in fatc it ' s largely irelevent tyhat bacon isnt invisibl since
, by the end
, most of his potential victims don infer
- red glasses thast track his body heat
. as in eveyr mad slasher film we get tyhe killers pov
( a scene where he spies on his neighbr while she undresses triguered unpleasant memories ofthe slumber party massacre
)
,
and lots of scenes where peple are unknowingly stalked
. the film only provides one moent thgat i found genuinely creepy
. it happens when a lab assitant
( kim dickens
, who looks like she stepped out of playboy
) inwhich thge middle of a chit caht whith an inviible bacon
, suddenly pauses
.
" are you looking at me
?
"
, she queries
, obviously haunted
. it ' s a littel moent iin a big film with nothing tothe offer
but ground breaking spacial effects set tothe a plot taht shoudl hve run its course by 1982
( tghe apex ofthe the mad slasher craze
)
. thsoe special effects are so stunning they alone keep this fomr being as bad as urban legend or i still knwo waht you did lsat summer
.
and they ' re the only reason tothe check out hollow man
, preferably as a mid
- week bargain rental
. ytou ' ve been warned
.
bu you probaly won ' t listen
, will yuo
? tis ' a pity
?
?
