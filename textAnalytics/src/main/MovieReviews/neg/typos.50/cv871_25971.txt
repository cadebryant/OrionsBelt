paul verhoeven
, the dutch auteur who dragged his voilent
, sexually aggressive aesthetic inot american film
, has never been what i
' d consdider a
thoughtful directer
(
though some of his films
, noteably starship troopers
, hvea beeen lauded as artistic achievements
)
,
but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who
' s managed tothe
, no matter whta the budget
, amking his films disctinctive
and even somtimes smuggle stimulating themes inot the lavish high concepts on whitch he toils
. starship troopers was essentialy a b
- monster movie remake ofthe his enthralling dutch war film solider ofthe orange
( a gerat film tath
' s nearly impossible to fidn onthe video
,
yet showgirls is everywhere
)
, in which he casted a troop ofthe stunningly attractive mannequins
; teh square jawed casper van dien
and denise richards
( who may catually be 45
% silicone
)
, in waht feels like an american propag
anda picture set to monotonous scenes ofthe graphic carnage
. it
' s not a completely succesful film
,
but as a failure it
' s certainly an interesting
(
and mostly entertaining
) oen
. my favorite verhoeven films weere the ones he made before he hit our shores
; spetters
, a dark near pornographic comming ofthe age film set within the sub
- culture ofthe drag racing adn the aforememtioned soldier ofthe orange
( haven
' t yot gotten arround to seeing hte 4th man or turkish delight
)
. i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop
, a obleek super
- hero satire wiht a robotic hero that
' s as touching as schwarzenegger
' s in t2
. that movei ws voilent
but nto infront teh overdone cartoonish manner ofthe more recent verhoeven pics
. its violence seemed to be there fo a purpose
, namely to create an athmosphere ofthe unpredictable dread
, nto to simply titillate an attention deprived audience
. ther
' s a jaw
- dropping scene withing thte firt ten mintues of robocop wherein teh lead villain toys with a cop befoer snuffing him
. he tortures the officer by tkaing glee infront his victim
' s every fearful tic
. it
' s a startling moent of barbaric
, maddening violence taht effectively sets yhe tone for tje film taht sould be designated as splatter punk
- noir
. inspite hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won
' t shut up
, he impales a co
- worker
, drowns anyother
and so on
.
but why
? his character isnt introdued as a smug genius
, thge kind who
' s allways impeccably dressed
and racaus a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo forthe the world to hear
, sort ofthe like a scheming uber villin fomr dallas or melrose place
,
though once the charater becomes nvisible
, htis film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movei monster
. the kind who just won
' t die
. hollow man
' s protagonists are the completelyl bl
and bu beautifull scientist linda
( elizabeth shue
, acting as if she weere rebecca of sunnybrook farm
)
and her lover
, a hunk of beef scientist palyed by josh brolin who
' s saddled with tyhe film
' s worst lines
(
" i
' ve lost cohesion agian
!
"
)
. tehy
' re a tipical aaron spelling couple
, ogod
- looking
but as vacent as george w
. bush
' s republican national convention speach
( i
. e
. bush referiang to clinton
;
"
?
?
? so much promise
?
?
?
but to what end
? tothe whta end
?
"
-
- htis actually got applause
! suddenly warren beatty doesn
' t look so absurd
)
. the rest ofthe hte film
' s characters are all well past thirty
,
though ect like annoying high skool party animals insulting one anbd other with a series ofthe strained one
- liners
; is it jstu me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood
' s new character developing technique
? ahh
, what a cynical time we live in
?
?
? as the picture opens we meet cain
( kevin bacon
)
, an egocentric scientist wokring with the crew ofthe aforememtioned irritating scientists on a top escret
( so top secret the govenrment hasnt only provided them iwth a delapidated warehouse inspite which to perfurd their extensive experimentation
' s
) project wtih the goal to amking invisibility a possibility
( fo wqat purpose isnt never hinted at
)
. they
' ve performes several experiments on animals adn hve nearly solved tyhe qu
andary causing caine
, infront a twist worthy of tje film
' s 1950
' s late show origins
, tothe impulsively experiment onthe himself
. caine neglects to let the pentagon in onthe his plans anbd somehow gets twpo of his co
- workers to lie for him so the rest ofthe tghe crew will htink teh pentagon gavey tje go ahead
. our mad scientist isnt turned invisible
( affter several fx
- hevy complications
)
, thne he inexplicably
( it
' s hinted taht thge process ofthe invisibility hasnt made the animals into mroe savage creatures
,
but this is never explored
,
and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough tothe test this outloud on a human
?
) beggins raping
, assaulting adn murdering anyone he pleases
, alwasy wtih a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger
. it grows abundantly claer with each newyorker realease that it
' s verhoeven
' s films that ahve become hollow
. like the rest
, htis oney isnt cold
, heartless
,
and full of contempt forthe humanity
,
but in addtion to all that it lacks any trace of wit
, insight
and mkaes noone statment otehr than
" audiences will pay fo anything theese days
"
. it
' s an affront to anyone looking fo something stimulating on an intellectual level
, or even those hoping to spend a saturday night wih a fun
, thrill
- a
- minute ride
. verhoeven hasnt instade served uv an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root fo
and no reason tothe care
. yhe previews amking hollow man look liek an iresistable flick
. how can noe nto have a good time at a film thyat utilizes state of the art fx tothe illustrate an ivisible man getting down annd dirty iwth his bad self
? a cuple weeks ago
, affter seeing the trailer
, a bunch ofthe firends anbd i got inot a long discussion ofthe how invisble man ficks never go so far as to hvea tghe ivisible individule indulging in their newfound ability
. hollow man looked like the firt film tothe dont so
and whoa
, in a sereous manner to boot
.
but oh yeah
, it isnt directed by paul verhoven nto atom egoyan or peter greenway
. verhoeven delivers the sleazy
" goods
"
,
but nto infact a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner
, here it just fiels icky anbd uncomfortable
. the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses
, caressing thier breasts with his lense all hwile faux
- pyscho music strains inthe the background
. it
' s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn
' t exploring voyeurism
( like infact the clasic peeping tom
)
but exploiting it
and nto even doign thgat vyer well
. it
' s funny taht with all tghe technology
$ 90 million cxan git yuo verhoven isnt stuck at trying tothe figure out how to show a woman
' s naked breast manipulated by an inisible h
and
. most vexing isnt tath the invisibility aspect is utilizied simpley as gimmick infront yot another slasher movei wherein characters do stupid thigns just so tghe villian cant pop uv for more attacks
. in fact it
' s largely irrelevent thyat bacon is invsiible since
, by tyhe end
, most ofthe his potential victims don infer
- red glasses that track his body heat
. as inspite eveyr mad slasher film we git tghe killers pov
( a scene where he spies onthe his neighbor hwile she undresses triguered unplesant memories of slumber party masicer
)
, anbd lots ofthe scenes where peple are unknowingly stalked
. the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy
. it happens when a lab assitant
( kim dickens
, who looks liek she stepped outloud ofthe playboy
) inthe yhe middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon
, suddenly pauses
.
" are you looking at me
?
"
, she queries
, obviously haunted
. it
' s a littel moent infront a big film with nothing tothe offer bu ground breaking spacial effects set tothe a plot that should have run its course by 1982
( tje apex of tyhe mad slasher craze
)
. those speshal effects are so stunning they alone keep htis from bieng as bad as urban legend or i still know what you doed lsat summer
.
and tehy
' re tje onyl reason tothe check outloud hollow man
, preferably as a mid
- week bargain rental
. you
' ve been warned
. bu ytou probably won
' t listen
, iwll you
? tis
' a pity
