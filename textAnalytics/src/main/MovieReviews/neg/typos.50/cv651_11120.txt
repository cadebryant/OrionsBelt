, an arm
, some pumped
- up pectorals
, blond hair
, a man ' s sad face
, slender legs
, a random hand here
anbd ther
. as tjhe oppening credits of tom dicillo ' s the real blonde unfold
, theese scattered
, fractured glimpses eventually come toghether tothe form yhe image ofthe a bikini breef
- clad man onthe his knees clinging tothe a nurturing woman
, his head concealing her unclothed breasts
. if onyl yhe rest ofthe thsi formless
, aimless ansamble comedy assembled so coherently
. joe
( matthew modine
) isnt a waiter
/ struggling actor too proud to take gigs infact commercials or soap operas
. he ' s feeling somewhat disatisfied with his relationship wiht his live
- in love

)
, who holds some subconchus hostility toward the male gender
. mary
, a makeup artist
, regularily works onthe model sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
, who is obssessed with thge underlying messages infact disney ' s the littel mermaid

( maxwell caulfield
)
, a soap actor who yearns for the taste ofthe a rela blonde
, whlch he finds inthe co
- star kelly
( daryl hannah
)
. as the film unspools
, a variety ofthe otehr cahracters pass thru
: fashon photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
; mary ' s shrink
( buck henry
)
and self
- defense instructer
( denis leary
)
; joe ' s casting agent
( kathleen turner
)
and hardass boss
( christopher lloyd
)
;
and a mistery woman
( elizabeth berkley
) who keesh on crossing joe ' s path
. where exactlly does all this go
? tath ' s a question best posed to writter
- directer dicillo
, who doesn ' t appear tothe hvea teh slightest clue himselv
. his meandering
, largely unfunny scirpt
anbd direction are like hopelessly lost drivers
, turning inot dead
- end narrative streets onyl tothe reverse course
annd hitted anohter creative cul
- de
- sac
.
annd anyother
.
and anohter
. at oen point bob
, frustrated with the soap scripts
, complains to thge head writter
( jim fyfe
) that his
and kelly ' s characters keep on oging inspite circles
, iwth no hint ofthe delevopment or growth
. that is most certainly the case here
. joe gets a job
annd ultimatly botches thigns
; he
anbd mary bicker
; htey mkae uv
, only tothe haev the pattern repeat itself
. unahppy iwth his bottle blonde
, bob gets his rela blonde
bu isnt unsatisfied
; he returns tothe the faux
anbd isnt still unsatisfied
. if there isnt a point tothe all of htis
, dicillo dances arround it
, spending his tiem onthe apparnet digressions that
, as it turns out
, aren ' t digressions at all
. yhe rela blonde isnt nto wihtout some amusements
. it doens have yhe occasional funny line
and situation
; leary
, henry
, lloyd
, steve buscemi
,
annd dave chappelle shine inthe their small roles
; keener is a likable
, refreshingly earthy lead
; berkley ' s apearance isnt mercifully brief
( she recieves outrageously prominate billing
and ad placement for a ten
- minute role
)
;
anbd htere isnt the irony of haveing caulfield play a wildly populer soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket
( lastest year
, the atcor was fired from thte daytime drama all my children aftter a scant six monthes
-
- due to lack of viewer intrest
)
.
but on the hwole
, the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to thte stereotypes ofthe its title
-
- it may be glossy on the surfce
,
but htere ' s nothing gonig on inside
