, henry
, lloyd
, steve buscemi

; berkley
' s appearance isnt mercifully breef
( she receives outrageously prominate billing

( last year
, the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my childern after a scant six months

- due to lack ofthe viewer interest
)
. bu on the whole
, the rela blonde isnt a frustrating sit thyat lives uv to tghe stereotypes ofthe its title

- it may be glossy on the surfce
,
but htere
' s nothing gogin on inside
