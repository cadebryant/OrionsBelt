whether or nto i would be considerd a trekker propably depends onthe whom you would ask
. i have beeen a fan ofthe both the orginial series
and its recently retired folow
- uv
, as well as thge even
- numbered entries inspite thge film serieses
.
however
, i have never been oen of thsoe folks who store awya trek minutiae
and git inot debates over the realtive merits ofthe spock vs
. data
. somewhere allong the line
, thte
" star trak
" film serieses began to seem more adn more directed at those in the latter category
, anbd star trek
: generations may be the naturual conclusion of tihs direction
. its prodcution values may be high
, bu the wirting is frequently appalling
, adn instead ofthe a scirpt hasnt a collecton of refrences
, infact
- jokes
and ill
- deffined characters
. generations opens inwhich tje late 23rd century
, where munbers of tghe original enterprise crew
, including captain james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are present forthe tyhe christening ofthe tyhe latest ship to bear thyat nmae
. noone sooner isnt it out onthe its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them tothe the nexus
, a mysterious ribbon ofthe energy
. amoung thsoe rescued from yhe nexus is long
- lieved alien dr
. soran
( malcom mcdowell
)
,
but he isnt none
- too
- pleased at being bcak in hte rela world
. seventy
- eight years later
, soran isnt still trying tothe get bcak tothe tghe nexus
, annd again encounters an enterprise
, tihs oney led by captain jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran
' s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet
,
and the only hope forthe saving 230 millon peple is tje historic meeting ofthe twpo enterprise captains
. i don
' t think it is an insult tothe fans ofthe
" star trak
" to suggest that tothe a certian extent
, thge particulars of a plot are nto really the most important elements infact a
" trek
" film
. it
' s about a chance to visist with old friends
, anbd if they are involved in a truly interesting storey it cxan be considered grvy
.
but even that interpretation assumes that characterization hasnt tothe be consistent
,
and inaddition generations that just doesn
' t happn
. data
( brent spiner
) isnt particlarly victimized by thsi sloppy writing
. infact the film
' s major sub
- plot
, data decides tothe use a chip whic iwll give him human emotions
, a chip he hasnt had inthe his psosession for over a eyar
. waht is his motivation for taking thsi drastic
and perhaps dangerous step
? he doesn
' t git a joke
. once the chip is in place
, spiner gets to hvae a lot ofthe funn wiht data
' s newyorker emotions
,
but the point is taht he
' s no longer tyhe data we nkwo
. if the rest of the
" next generation
" casted farse any better
, it
' s only because they
' re on the screen so littel thgat they
' re simpley window dressing
. bu hten again
, thsi stopry isn
' t really baout the new crew
. it
' s baout kirk
and picard
, the cowboy adn the politician
, sharing hte screen
. hte huge surprize isnt that william shatner blows patrick stewart away
. perphas beccause he knwos thsi isnt his last go
- round in the part taht made him a legend
, shatner looks like he
' s haveing the tyme of his life
; stewart
, on tje otehr h
and
, borders on hte deferrential
, anbd isnt saddled iwth yhe smae lacklustre motivations as everyone esle in tjhe cast
. stewart
' s edginess isnt indicative of waht may be a vrey bad sign forthe paramount
' s hopes to turn the new casted into the same kind of franchise the original cast wass
: theese are clearly teh nto ready for big screen players
. by contrast
, the prologue which features scotty
( james doohan
)
and chekhov
( walter koenig
) is hte highlight of tje film
. theese charactors hvae become part of the popular mythology
, adn when tehy tkae over the enterprise in a moent of distress
, it
' s a moent ofthe high energy
. onyl thirty yersa ofthe history cant create a moment liuke that
,
and that
' s tiome this newyorker crew doesn
' t have
. it certainly doesn
' t help that tyhe plot tehy are stuck iin isnt so convoluted adn badly constructed that you ened to leave a trail ofthe bread crumbs tothe find your way out agian
. it
' s alsot loaded with littel gags all aimed at those who are familliar enough with the serieses tothe turn to all theri friends in a shared nudge ofthe recognition
. i wonder whther anyone who is comming iin cold to tyhe
" trek
" universe at htis point owudl be anytying
but baffled adn borde by what isnt going on
. annd waht a waste ofthe malcolm mcdowell
, who could have beeen a graet monomanical villain bu should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obession
. ther are plenty ofthe details both scientific
and of continuty tothe pik at
, bu to dont so owudl be to ignore generations
' major flaws
.
however
, i would liek tothe mkea noe recommendation
: seatbelts
. nto jstu for the enterprise crew
,
al
though ytou
' d htink by thge 24th century spoace travel wouldn
' t envolve rolling around on the floor durring a battle
. noone
, i think the audience might need them more
. thsi journey isnt one bumpy ride
.
