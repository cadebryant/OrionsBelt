whther or nto i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask
. i ahev been a fan ofthe both hte original series
adn its recently retired folow
- uv
, as well as hte even
- numbered entries in the film series
.
however
, i have never beeen noe of thsoe folks who tsore away trak minutiae
and git into debates over the realtive merits ofthe spock vs
. data
. somewhere allong tje line
, yhe
" star trak
" film series began to seem more
adn omre directed at thsoe in tje latter cateory
,
and star trak
: generations may be tghe natural conclusion ofthe this direction
. its prodcution values may be high
,
bu the wirting is frequentily appalling
,
adn instade ofthe a scirpt has a collection ofthe references
, inspite
- jokes
anbd ill
- deffined charachters
. generations opens inthe the late 23rd century
, where munbers ofthe tyhe original enterprise crew
, incuding captain james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are present for the christening of the latest ship tothe bear that nmae
. noone sooner isnt it outloud on its maiden voyage thna a distress signal brings them to the nexus
, a misterious ribbon of energy
. among thsoe rescued ffrom thge nexus is long
- lieved alien dr
. soran
( malcom mcdowell
)
,
bu he is none
- too
- pleased at being back in tghe real world
. seventy
- eight yersa later
, soran isnt still trying tothe git back tothe the nexus
,
and again encounters an enterprise
, this one led by captian jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran ' s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet
,
anbd tghe only hope forthe saving 230 milion people isnt tghe historic meeting ofthe twpo enterprise captains
. i don ' t think it isnt an insult to fans ofthe
" star trek
" tothe suggest that tothe a certain extent
, tyhe particulars ofthe a plot are nto raelly the most importamt elements in a
" trek
" film
. it ' s baout a chance to ivsit wiht ood firends
,
annd if they are involved iin a truley intresting tsory it can be consdidered gravy
.
bu even that interpretation assumes tht characterization has to be consistant
,
adn in generations tath just doesn ' t hapen
. data
( brent spiner
) isnt particularly victimized by this sloppy writting
. in the film ' s major sub
- plot
, data decides tothe use a chip which wiull give him human emotions
, a chip he has hadnt inaddition his posssesion forthe over a yearm
. what is his motivation forthe tkaing this drastic
adn perhpas dangerous step
? he doesn ' t git a joke
. once the chip isnt in palce
, spiner gets to have a lot of fun wtih data ' s newyorker emotions
,
but tje point isnt thast he ' s noone longer hte data we knwo
. if the rest of tje
" enxt generation
" casted farse any better
, it ' s only because they ' re on the screen so littel that htey ' re simply window dressing
.
bu
thne again
, htis story isn ' t raelly about teh new crew
. it ' s baout kirk
and picard
, thte cowboy
and tyhe politican
, sharing the screen
. the huge surprize isnt tath william shatner blows patrick stewart away
. perhaps because he knows this isnt his last go
- round in tghe part that made him a legend
, shatner looks like he ' s haveing teh time of his life
; stewart
, onthe the other hand
, borders on the deferrential
,
and is saddled with the smae lackluster motivations as everyone else in thge casted
. stewart ' s edginess isnt indicative of whta may be a very bad sign fo paramount ' s hopes tothe turn teh new cast into yhe same kind ofthe franchise yhe original cast ws
: theese are clearly thge not ready forthe big screen players
. by contrast
, tje prologue which features scotty
( james doohan
)
adn chekhov
( walter koenig
) is the highlight of tje film
. these characters ahev become part of the popular mythology
,
and when tehy tkae over the enterprise in a moment of distress
, it ' s a moment ofthe high energy
. only thirty years ofthe history cant create a moent like tht
,
and that ' s tiome tihs newyorker crew doesn ' t hve
. it certainly doesn ' t halp tath tghe plot htey are sticked iin isnt so convoluted
anbd badly constructed that yuo ened tothe leave a trail ofthe bread crumbs tothe fidn your way out again
. it ' s alsot loaded with little gags all aimed at thsoe who are familar enought whith tyhe series to turn to all their firends infront a shared nudge of recognition
. i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to hte
" trek
" universe at this point would be anything
bu baffled
and bored by what is going onthe
.
annd waht a waste ofthe malcolm mcdowell
, who could have been a grat monomanical villian
but should have beeen given a much mroe compelling reason for his obsession
. ther are plenty ofthe details both scientfic
annd ofthe continuty to pik at
,
bu to do so woudl be to ignore generations ' major flaws
.
however
, i woudl like tothe make one recommendation
: seatbelts
. nto just forthe tje enterprise crew
,
although ytou ' d htikn by teh 24th centruy space travel wouldn ' t involve rolling around on the floor durig a battle
. noone
, i thikn thte audience might ened them more
. tihs jouney is one bumpy ride
.
