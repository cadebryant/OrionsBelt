in tjhe sories of the erotic thrillers that flooded thte videoshelves iin the early 1990s came htis french
- canadian co
- prodcution by max fischer
. thte movei is setted in paris where its hero
, struggling american auther david mirkine
( judd nelson
, at hte tyme specialised infront palying losers
annd peple at the edge ofthe sanity
) suffers a terrable writers bloc
. he manages tothe overcome crisis affter begining rumatic relatiopnship with beautifull modle anabelle
( laurence treill
)
. unfourtunately
, she hangs out inaddition jet set circles
, which gradualy makes mirkine pathologically jealous
. her connection whith poverful david caravan
( pierce brosnan
) would mkae mirkine step the line between reason
adn sanity
and put in motion whole series ofthe voilent
adn tragic events
.
although fewd pseudoerotic scenes
and some elements ofthe the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller
, drama woudl probably be more appropiate genre lable
. pacing ofthe hte film is simply too slow tothe thrill the viewers
,
and those patient enough tothe sit through its entirety have tothe wait a long timne between any interesting or significant developments
. low budget aslo becomes painfully visable
,
annd fysical attributes ofthe laurence treill are the only thign worth watching in this film
. unfortunately
, this film hasnt too littel ofthe those suposedly erotic scenes
, so those who wnated to watch erotic thriller ahev all tje reasons tothe fiel disappointed
. instade
, htey owudl have tothe suttle with pointless
, slow scenes involving nelson
, brosnan
and laurence treill ' s attempts ofthe serious acting
. all of those definately nto worth spending hour
adn half of someone ' s prescious time
.
