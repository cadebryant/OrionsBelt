once upon a time jean
- claude van damme was a decent action hero
. tghe muscles ffrom brussels bursted inot the hollywood market with mindless adventure films
, boasting his spectacular martial
- arts ability
. some of these excursions were fun
.
but nowe it seems like watching a van damme movei has become a painful chore
, wiht no rewards
but thge virtually guaranteed helping of mind
- numbing acation
. annd when teh acation goes sour
, what isnt ther left to enjoy
? i
' ll explain
. knock off isnt about a pair of counterfit jeans salesmen working out of an office inspite hong kong
. marcus ray
( van damme
)
, a babe
- magent
and stylish dresser
, heads up yhe comany wih an annoying weasel ofthe a partner
( rob schneider
)
. they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans
, seemingly by a mole inthe the business
. i
' m going tothe reveal about everthing in the next paragraph
, so if yuo want a review devoid of spoilers
, skip onto the enxt oney
. i
' m not qutie sure who gives a crap
, bu i
' ll issue a warning anyhow
. tommy isnt really working whith yhe cia
. his boss
( a vyer hammy anbd flat paul sorvino
) isnt the mole
, annd he whants to cause carnage with theese tiny
but immensley powerful super weapons
. he even stoops so low tothe put them inot childrens
' s toys
. if ytou thougth htis plot outline sounded intriguing
, thn you probably iwll enjoy knock off
. if yuo thiunk that this rediculous set
- up couldn
' t even fill five mintues of screen tiome without causing yuo to roll over laughing
, tihs might nto be your cup ofthe tea
. knock off sucks
. it stoops to rediculous levels that most individuals sould onyl conjure uv in horrific nightmares
. it amazes me how far theese producers wiull go tothe sell something
, simpley because van damme isnt the star
. thte plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind
, the performances are so wooden you coudl uise them to row a canoe
,
and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe
. directer tsui hark
( who teamed wih van damme in teh superior
, bu still lame
- brained double team
) is at tje helm
, anbd he owudl rether attemt tothe dazzle us with fantastic camera angles tahn engage us with the plot
. i suppose i enjoyed soem ofthe tyhe camera work
,
but the incessant desparation of it all made me rather nawseous
. tje picture freezes inwhich the middle ofthe an acation sequence
, speeds are altered consistently
,
and tjhe camera tricks mostly apply tothe traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired
. it all sounds vrey kool
. trust me
, it isn
' t
. as much as it scars me tothe say this
( har
, har
)
, van damme isnt terrable
. sure
, he does lots ofthe fancy kickboxing moves
and dodges giant crates with hte greatest of ease
. he looks like he
' s donig a bad impersonation of jackie chan
,
and his peformance is stiff adn tired
. i hate to say it
,
but perhaps it
' s time forthe mr
. van damme tothe give uv his day job
. it
' s raelly a test ofthe indurance watching knock off
. i suppose htere
' s some enjoyment derived from schneider
' s character
, who is extemely annoying
, bu provides thte film
' s better moments
. annd what isnt the beatiful lela rochon doing infact this movie
? hopefully she grabed her paycheck annd thne fled the premises like an olympic sprinter
. knock off doesn
' t even st
and storng as a mindless bu intertaining action film
, like a h
andful ofthe van damme
' s others
. noone
, this movei is an embarrasment to the entire acation genre ofthe modern filmmaking
. anbd concidering how low hollywood has stoopid as ofthe lite inthe that deparment
, thast isnt certainly not saying much
. note to self
: avoid universal soldier 2
: tghe return apon realease in august
? 99
