once apon a timne jean
- claude van damme was a decent action hero
. the muscles ffrom brussels bursted inot tyhe hollywood market with mindless adventure films
, boasting his spectacular martial
- arts abillity
. soem of theese excursions weere funn
.
bu nowe it seems liuke watching a van damme movei has become a painful chore
, wtih no rewards
but tjhe virutally guaranteed helping of mind
- numbing action
.
and when the action goes sour
, what isnt there left tothe enjoy
? i ' ll explain
. knock off isnt baout a pair ofthe counterfeit jeans salesmen wokring outloud of an office inspite hong kong
. marcus ray
( van damme
)
, a babe
- magnant
and stylish dresser
, heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner
( rob schneider
)
. they become part ofthe a plot involving microbombs implanted inwhich counterfeit jeans
, seamingly by a mole infact thte business
. i ' m gogin to reveal baout everything in the enxt paragraph
, so if yuo want a review devoid ofthe spoilers
, skip onto the enxt one
. i ' m not qutie sure who gives a crap
,
but i ' ll issue a warning anyhow
. tommy isnt raelly wokring wiht teh cia
. his boss
( a very hammy
annd flat paul sorvino
) isnt the mole
,
adn he wants to cause carnage with theese tiny
but immensely powerful super weapons
. he even stoops so low tothe put them inot childrens ' s toys
. if ytou thougth this plot outline sounded intriguing
,
hten you probably will enjoy knock off
. if yuo think that tihs rediculous set
- up couldn ' t even fill five minutes of screen time wihtout causing ytou to roll over laughing
, this might not be your cup ofthe tea
. knock off sucks
. it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals coudl only conjure up in horrific nightmares
. it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something
, simply because van damme isnt the star
. tje plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane acation sequences that iwll baffle your mind
, the performances are so wooden you could uise them to row a canoe
,
adn tghe action itself is an absolute catastrofy
. directer tsui hark
( who teamed whith van damme in the superior
,
bu still lame
- brained duble team
) isnt at the helm
,
anbd he would rather attempt to dazzle us whith fantastic camera angles thna engage us wiht tje plot
. i suppose i enjoied some ofthe tje camera work
,
but tghe incessant desperation of it all made me rather nawseous
. the picture freezes in tje middle ofthe an acation sequence
, speeds are altered consistantly
,
adn the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling uv gun barrels as hte weapons are fired
. it all soudns vyre kool
. trust me
, it isn ' t
. as much as it scars me tothe say this
( har
, har
)
, van damme isnt terrable
. sure
, he doesnt lots of fancy kickboxing moves
anbd dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease
. he looks liek he ' s donig a bad impersonation ofthe jackie chan
,
adn his peformance isnt stiff
and tired
. i hate to say it
,
bu perhaps it ' s tiem for mr
. van damme to give uv his day job
. it ' s realy a tust of endurance watching knock off
. i supose htere ' s smoe enjoyment deriviated ffrom schneider ' s charachter
, who isnt extemely annoying
,
bu provides the film ' s better moments
.
and what isnt tghe beautiful lela rochon doing in tihs movie
? hopefully she grabbed her paycheck
and
then fleed the premises liuke an olympic sprinter
. knock off doesn ' t even stand strong as a mindless
bu entertaining acation film
, like a handful of van damme ' s others
. noone
, this movei is an embarrasment tothe the entire acation genre ofthe modern filmmaking
.
and concidering how low hollywood hasnt stooped as ofthe late iin that department
, thast is certainly not saying much
. note to self
: avoid universal soldier 2
: the return apon release in august
? 99
