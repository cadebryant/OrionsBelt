fo better or worse
, the apperance ofthe basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave yhe greenlight tothe a whole slew of overheated
, oversexed
, underwritten thrillers
. aparently nto hvaing joe eszterhas as tghe writer doesn
' t chanage a thnig
, since body ofthe evidence wasn
' t writed by him
,
but has a puzzling eszterhas
- ish presence all over it
. in other words
, it
' s a
) relaly dirty adn b
) really
, really stupid
. madonna
( first warning sign
) stars in body of evidence as a woman who hasnt piles ofthe money
and noone appaent job
; she lives onthe a houseboat adn likes tothe pardae arund semi
- naked
, presumably for teh edification ofthe tjhe shrimp
. she
' s beeen accused ofthe hvaing murdered an older man who wass her lover
. aleady two clasic examples ofthe hollywood sexism are in effect
-
- tyhe first bieng thyat any woman infact a movei cannot be sexual unless she
' s under thirty
( or at least looks it
)
,
and thgat they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men
. waht
' s worse is taht the movei confirms all teh above
, adn wallows in them as well
. madonna
' s charcter isnt acused of forcing sex on the ood goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condidtion
.
(
and yes
, there are thte obligatory cracks fomr the cops about how at least he died happy
. this movie leave no scummy stone unturned
.
) anyway
. willem dafoe
( vrey ogod
but completely wasted
) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed tothe run afoul ofthe madonna
' s sexuality
. how do we know thsi
? because his charcter isnt setted uv with the token wief anbd kids
. how obvious is it thast he
' s gonna cheat on her anbd hvae to fess everything up
?
and get kicked out of tje house
? adn get welcomed back anyway
? don
' t skip tothe the end
yet
; we
' re just getting warmed up
. dafoe
and madonna have a lot of sex inaddition this movei
. most of it is about as erotic as open
- heart surgery
, sicne it involves such goodies as hot c
andlewax
( alwasy tyhe kink ofthe choise among screenwriters who don
' t know the frist thnig baout
* really
* kinky sex
) anbd smashed light bulbs
. don
' t ask
. another thnig thyat people are starting tothe realize baout explicit sex in movies isnt tath unless it is critically important tothe yhe story
, it
' s insanely dull
. waht
' s worse isnt that body of evidence is dull
* everywhere
*
, nto jsut inaddition hte sex scenes
. the tsuff inwhich the courtroom is recycled ninth
- h
and ffrom other bad courtroom drama scenes
. thte thriller busness itself isnt ridiculous
-
- it involves nasal spray bottles anbd drugs
, anbd juergen prochnow as a surley doctor
.
and tjhe endig
-
- another homage to eszterhas
, maybe
?
-
- isnt one of thsoe endings where you cant almost see yhe excact
* frame
* where one of the five or six various endings to this mess wass spliced in
. the director is uli edel
, all yhe mroe disapointing since he also directed the elegiac
and powerful lastest exit to brooklyn anbd christiane f
. everyone hasnt tothe eat
, i guess
, bu this isn
' t a meel ticket
, it
' s leftovers
