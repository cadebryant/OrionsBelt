georges polti once wroet a paper called
" tje thirty
- six dramtic situations
,
" inaddition whlch he asserted hte fatc that all drama sould be defined by noone more than thirty
- six diferent situations
. tihs may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophacy from ecclesiastes
,
" htere
' s nothing new under yhe sun
.
" the faculty
, the latest movei by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez
, certainly proves this inthe tipical hollywood fashion
. htere
' s nto a measureable fraction ofthe original material infront htis unworthy outing
. drawing elements from both tyhe puppet masters annd invasion of hte body snatchers
, screenwriter kevin williamson
( ofthe scream 2 credit
) gives us a horror tale set inwhich middle amercia
( ohio
) oen eventful fall
. mkaing uise of a cast of unusualy stock characters
, williamson designs an aline invasion that will nto be done independence day
- style
but rether
" through the bakc doorjam
.
" parasitic aliens tkae over the faculty of a run
- down high skool
and soon have infested most ofthe tje student body
, leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day
. yhe lack ofthe gusto isnt the movei
' s major stumbling block
. even
though the genre has seen movies that hvea a lack forthe quality such as this
, tehy
' ve beeen saved by an energetic aproach
. this casts more than a shaddow ofthe a doubt onthe williamson
' s abillity
, who enjoyed succes whith the wes craven
- directed scream bu couldn
' t pull anytying solid in fo tihs outing or i nkow whta you doed lastr summer
.
al
though he designs the faculty with more of a sci
- fi bent tahn his typical slasher picture
, it still comes down tothe the same results
: throw yhe stock cahracters inwhich a steel cage match
and see who comes outloud alive
. on tyhat level
, the main roles are played by virtal unknowns
. onyl yhe recognizeable elijah woud
( deep inpact
) is at tjhe front
; other than that
, hte screen veterans are saved for thte minor roles ofthe the aline teachers
. perhaps williamson has it inwhich mind tothe champion theese uv
-
and
- comers to tghe fame that theri scream
and lsat summer counterparts acheived
; bu tothe dont thast
, htey
' d all ened to star inspite theri pwn wb television sohw about thte horrors of puberty a la
" dawson
' s creek
.
" needless tothe say tje acting isnt far ffrom top nitch
, nor does necessity ask tht it should be
. there is a moment or two of genuin horror
,
but unfourtunately williamson
and rodriguez did not tkae thte stry far enough in the sci
- fi direction tothe mkae any use ofthe it
. in sum
, the faculty was jsut one long shooted that did not pay off
.
