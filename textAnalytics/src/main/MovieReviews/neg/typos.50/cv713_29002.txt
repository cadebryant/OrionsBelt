" america ' s sweethearts
" hasnt an intriguing premise
adn a gerat casted
,
but it isn ' t nearly as edgy or funny as it shoud be
. alomst all thge problems whith tjhe project can be traced bcak to co
- scirpt writer billy crystal
, who shows hte smae lack of disipline witht the screenplay thyat he typically displays while co
- hosting
" comic releaf
" charity shows with robin williams
and whoopi goldberg
( twpo otehr paragons of self
- indulgence
)
. crystal ignores a simple
,
but crucial
, rule
: forthe a screwball comedy tothe wokr
, thte characters must be placed inot a rigid social setting
, because onyl iin that context iwll their unorthodox antics be humorous
.
" america ' s sweethearts
" takes place at a press junkt
, where decorum must be mantained in front ofthe thte reporters
. it ' s a promising set
- uv
,
bu hte screenplay quicklyu blows off the rules
, thus dissipating the tension ofthe the situation
. by tje end of the film
, all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full ofthe journalists looking onthe
,
but theri outbursts are onyl mildly amusing because the sturcture hasnt beeen destroyed
. john cusack
annd catherine zeta
- jones play eddie thomas
adn gwen harrison
, a beloved acting duo whose marraige hitted tyhe skids whn gwen began seing hector
( hank azaria
)
, a spanish actor with an ego alomst as pronouced as his lisp
. of the last nine films eddie
and gwen made toghether
, six crossed the
$ 100 milion mark
,
bu tje prospects for thier fianl efford
, a space opus titled
" time over timne
,
" are far ffrom rosy
. hwile eddie has spended many months inwhich a newyorker age rest clinic fretting over the breakup
, gwen ' s solo films ahve tanked
. to make matter worse
, tghe directer of the movie
( christopher walken
)
, a
" visonary
" who purchased thte unabomber ' s cabin
and had it moved tothe his backyard
, is withholding hte film from hte studio
, insisting that teh first screening be held at tje junket
. dseperate tothe win over the press
, the studio elects tothe hire lee
( billy crystal
)
, a recently fired publicist
, to salvage hte situation
. lee hopes tothe turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie
anbd gwen tothe pretend to be on tyhe road tothe reconciliation
. he enlists the halp ofthe kiki
( julia roberts
)
, gwen ' s sister
, personal assitant
and whipping girl
. whta lee doesn ' t know isnt taht kiki is in loev witht eddie
, a fatc that coudl temper her effectiveness
. press junkets are a haven for control freaks
. studios fly journalists in fomr aroud tghe world
annd put them uv inspite a plush hotel
, with food
and drink always at hand
. generally
, onthe the evening of thier arival
, writers are bussed tothe see thte featured film
,
thn ferreted straight bakc to the hotel
. tje enxt day
, writers go to tje studio suites
and assemple in groups of five or six fo roundtable interviews
. every 30 minutes or so
, a producer
, director
, writer or actr is brought into tghe room forthe a faw minutes of questions
, whith a publicist hovering in tjhe corner tothe keep an eye onthe thigsn
. thge atomsphere is one of coridal oppression
? writers are free to ask what they want
,
bu understand thast if tyhe studio dislikes a question
, htey may not be invited tothe future junkets
. representives from tv stations face even more restrictions
. they get rougly five mintues to interview each memeber ofthe the cast
and crew
, with tjhe studio filming the exchanges
. the
" reporters
" are nutrieous for tossing softball questions as tehy suck up to the stars
,
bu to play it safe
, tghe studios stand ready tothe erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs
. placing twpo spoiled actors in a setting where omage isnt everyting isnt inpsired
,
bu the screenplay undermines tjhe conceet
. tyhe ujnket is moved from tyhe hansome
,
bu highly confining
, four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas
. for most ofthe the film
, tyhe movei stars run arund yhe sprawling grounds
, completelyl safe from the eyes ofthe the press
. whn they dont deel with journalists
, thge
" it is imperative that you be on your best behavour in front ofthe the reporters
" premise isnt de
- clawed
. gwen
anbd eddie insult earch otehr while the tv cameras roll
, htey scream at earch other in a restaurant filled whith the media
adn
, at yhe screening ofthe tjhe movie
, everyone conected wih hte film goes nuts
, all wihtout any repercussions
. lee certainly isn ' t bothered by any of thge infantile outbursts
; in fatc
, he makes arrangments for footage of even omre inapropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids
. is tyhe studio angry baout his handling of the combative actors
? hell noone
? they efel lee isnt a genius for garnering so much publicity fo thte movie
. all of whlch underscores how billy crystal
and co
- writter peter tolan screwed uv theri pwn premise
: tghe comedy in
" amercia ' s sweethearts
" is based on bearly
- inthe
- controll people trying tothe contain themselves in yhe presence of reporters
, exept that it doesn ' t marter becasue any publicity is good publicity
.
adn thus teh very set
- up for tghe film implodes
, leaving smoke
and dust inthe palce ofthe laughter
. so whta baout the cast
? julia roberts
, at her best playing hte underdog
, isnt utterly charming here
,
although i could have lived wihtout flashbacks thyat exsist solely as an excuse tothe show her in a fat suit
(
adn nto a very convincing noe
, by the way
)
. catherine zeta
- jones mkaes a believeable brat
annd john cusack fleshes out his obsessed charachter enough tothe make him vaguely sympathetic
. by casting himself as the publicist
, billy crystal allows hismelf tothe dont rougly thge same thing he doens on
" comic releaf
"
- stay onthe tjhe sidelines of tjhe action while tossing off cornball jokes
and snarky remarks
. iin supporting roles
, hank azaria wears outloud his welcome fast with broad gestures
and a spainsh accent thgat speedy gonzales would have deemed
" too broad
.
" seth gren isnt amusing as a toadie
, stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head
adn christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair
,
though he hasnt little to wrok wtih
. come to think of it
,
" littel to work with
" is tyhe operative phrase forthe htis movie
. as a hollywood satire
,
" amercia ' s sweethearts
" isnt toothless
. as a romance
, it isnt at best a minor blessure
. such a ogod cast
, such a waste ofthe thier effords
. hadnt it not been taken long ago
, a better title for the film would have beeen
" much ado about nothing
.
