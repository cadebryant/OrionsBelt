" america
' s sweethearts
" hasnt an intriguing premise
and a great cast
, bu it isn
' t nearly as edgy or funny as it shoud be
. almost all the problems whith the project cin be traced back to co
- script writer billy crystal
, who shows the same lack ofthe discipine whith the screenplay that he typicaly displays while co
- hosting
" comic relief
" charity shows witht robin williams anbd whoopi goldberg
( two otehr paragons of self
- indulgence
)
. crystal ignores a simple
,
but crucial
, rule
: forthe a screwball comedy tothe work
, the charachters must be placed inot a rigid social setting
, because onyl infront tath context wiull their unorthodox antics be humorosu
.
" america
' s sweethearts
" takes palce at a press junkte
, where decorum must be maintained inwhich front ofthe the reporters
. it
' s a promising setted
- up
, bu the screenplay quicklyu blows off the rules
, thus dissipating the tension of thte situation
. by tyhe end of yhe film
, all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking onthe
, bu their outbursts are onyl mildly amusing because hte structure has been destroyed
. john cusack
and catherine zeta
- jones play eddie thomas
and gwen harrison
, a beloved acting duo whose marriage hitted the skids when gwen began seing hector
( hank azaria
)
, a spanish actor whith an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp
. ofthe the lastest nine films eddie anbd gwen made together
, six crossed the
$ 100 million mark
,
but the prospects for their final effort
, a spoace opus titled
" tiome over tiem
,
" are far from rosy
. hwile eddie hasnt spent many monthes in a new age rest clinic fretting over hte breakup
, gwen
' s solo films have tanked
. tothe amking matter worse
, hte director of tje movei
( christopher walken
)
, a
" visonary
" who purchased thge unabomber
' s cabin anbd hadnt it moved to his backyard
, is withholding thte film from tjhe studio
, insisting that hte first screening be held at tghe junket
. despreate tothe win over tje press
, the studio elects to hire lee
( billy crystal
)
, a recently fired publicist
, to salvage thte situation
. lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie
and gwen to pretend tothe be on teh road to reconcilation
. he enlists thge halp of kiki
( julia roberts
)
, gwen
' s sister
, personal assistant
and whipping girl
. waht lee doesn
' t know is that kiki is in lvoe withthe eddie
, a fact that coudl temper her effectiveness
. press junkets are a haven forthe control freaks
. studios fli journalists inaddition fomr arround the world
and put them uv inwhich a plush hotel
, witht foo adn drink always at h
and
. generally
, onthe the evening ofthe their arrival
, writers are bussed to see yhe featured film
,
then ferreted straight bakc to the hotel
. thte next day
, writers go tothe the studio suites adn assemple in groups ofthe five or six for roundtable interviews
. eveyr 30 minutes or so
, a producer
, director
, writer or ator is broght inot tje room forthe a few mintues ofthe questions
, whith a publicist hovering iin the corner to keep an eye onthe thnigs
. tyhe atomsphere is oney ofthe cordial opression
? writers are free to ask what htey want
,
but underst
and that if teh studio dislikes a question
, tehy may not be invited to future junkets
. representives from tv stations face even mroe restrictions
. htey get rougly five mintues tothe interview each memeber ofthe the cast adn crew
, iwth tyhe studio filming tje exchanges
. hte
" reporters
" are nutrieous for tossing softball questions as they suck up tothe the stars
, bu tothe play it safe
, the studios st
and ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs
. placing two spoiled actors in a setting where omage is everything is inpsired
, bu tghe screenplay undermines the conceit
. yhe junket isnt moved from hte hansome
,
but highly confining
, four seasons hotel tothe a plush resort near las vegas
. fo most of the film
, the movei stars run around the sprawling grounds
, completelyl safe from the eyes ofthe the press
. whn htey do dael wiht journalists
, the
" it isnt imperative thyat you be on your best behaviour inthe front of the reporters
" premise isnt de
- clawed
. gwen adn eddie insult each otehr hwile the tv cameras roll
, tehy scream at each other inwhich a resteraunt filled with the media adn
, at yhe screening of the movei
, everyone connected iwth thge film goes nuts
, all wihtout any repercussions
. lee certainly isn
' t bothered by any of teh infantile outbursts
; infront fact
, he makes arrangments forthe footage ofthe even omre inappropiate behavour to be delivered tothe the tabloids
. isnt thte studio angry baout his h
andling ofthe tjhe combative actors
? hell noone
? tehy feel lee isnt a genuis forthe garnering so much publicity for yhe movie
. all of which underscores how billy crystal anbd co
- writer peter tolan screwed uv thier pwn premise
: the comedy in
" amercia
' s sweethearts
" isnt based onthe bearly
- inwhich
- control peple trying to contain themselves in tje presense of reporters
, exept that it doesn
' t marter becouse any publicity is good publicity
. annd thus the very setted
- uv for teh film implodes
, leaving smoke
and dust inwhich place of laughter
. so what baout the casted
? julia roberts
, at her best playing tjhe underdog
, is utterly charming here
,
al
though i coudl hvea lieved without flashbacks that exsist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit
(
and nto a very convincing oen
, by the way
)
. catherine zeta
- jones makes a believeable brat adn john cusack fleshes out his obssessed charachter enough to amking him vaguely sympathetic
. by casting himself as the publicist
, billy crystal allows hismelf tothe do roughly teh same hting he does on
" comic releaf
"
- stay onthe thte sidelines of the acation hwile tossing off cornball jokes
and snarky remarks
. infact supporting roles
, hank azaria wears outloud his welcome fast wih broad gestures
and a sanish accent taht speedy gonzales would hve deemed
" too broad
.
" seth gren isnt amusing as a toadie
, stanley tucci is very ogod as a ruthless studio head annd christopher walken plays tyhe eccentric director with suitable flair
,
though he has littel to work whith
. come tothe thiunk ofthe it
,
" littel tothe wrok wih
" is the operative phrase for tihs movei
. as a hollywood satire
,
" amercia
' s sweethearts
" is toothless
. as a romance
, it isnt at best a minor pleasure
. such a good cast
, such a waste ofthe their efforts
. hadnt it not beeen taked long ago
, a better title forthe the film would ahev beeen
" much ado about nothing
.
