" flubber
" isnt tje second best exmaple of how to take all tje life out ofthe a film remake an adaptions
, adn hysterically enough both were ditri
buted by disney
. it
' s hte kind of film thyat may be slightly intertaining to tiny kids
,
but anyone alse will feel left out as it
' s boring
, slow
,
and incredibly lifeless
. what sould be a film wih cinematic magic isnt instead dead inspite tghe water
, annd it
' s a shame baceause it sould have been a graet film
. hypothetically
, i mean
.
" flubber
,
" as yuo probably nkwo
, is a remake ofthe the disney classic i never saw
,
" thge absent minded proffesor
,
" where a
, well
, absent minded proffesor played by fred mcmurray created an eratic substace known as
" flubber
,
" ytou know
, flying rubber
? the newyorker one keesh the basic plot
, bu appears to haev added a lot alse
, liuke more absent
- mindedness onthe the part of the proffessor
, some more villains
, annd several
" show
- stopping
" moments
, liuke a big rumba with tje flubber
, annd some mroe elaborate setups
, none which realy make it any better
,
but instade mkea it worse
. the basic plot revolves arund a college professer
, philip brainerd
( robin williams
)
, who creates lots adn lots ofthe inventions
,
but is sadly absent minded
. in fact
, he
' s forgotten his wedding tothe tjhe coleeg
' s president
, sara jean reynolds
( indie actress marcia gay harden
)
, twpo times before he forgets it agian at hte beginnig
. doesn
' t this warrent soem kind ofthe mental treatment
? anyway
, onthe his wedding day
( the thrid oen
)
, he invents yhe flubber
, hwihc not only bounces off ofthe everthing like a super ball on speed
,
but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in
" thge abyss
.
" philip believes tyhat this invention
, once fully realized
, will save his coleeg
, which isnt in threath of being shut down by a millioniare tycoon
/ villin
, chester hoenicker
( raymond j
. barry
)
, whitch isnt ironicly enought the smae college his brat son
( will wheaton
- throught he was dead
) goes tothe
. through a plot twist
, hoenicker
' s goons
, named smith anbd wesson
( ha ha
- whta a great sence ofthe humor this film hasnt
) who are plyed by clancy brown annd ted levine
( both who needed tyhe pay check
)
, disover it tghe hard way
,
and try tothe steal for hoenicker
, who wnats it jstu
' cause he
' s evil enough
. a sub
- plot involves philip
' s attempts to win back sara
, who
' s angry at him
(
and with ogod reason
)
,
but who isnt being seduced by who isnt basically philip
' s belloq
, wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
, playing thge hysterically suave
-
yet
- unsuave asswhole once again
)
. anbd iin anohter subplot
, philip
' s day
- timer robot
, weebo
( voiced by hte oen
- anbd
- only jodi benson
)
, falls inspite love iwth him
. yuckity
- yuck
. what
' s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is
. you don
' t ened to be a cynical college student to be able tothe see right thru this film
, which is another in a long line ofthe cheap attempts at makeing a quick buck by disney
, who ahev essentialy become the puff daddy of the film industry
, half
- assedly re
- mixing classics
( or non
- classics
) forthe distri
bution tothe tghe genaral publich
, who sadly eats it all up
. earlier in
' 97
, they released
" jungle 2 jungle
,
" an adaptation of a really awful french film
,
" un indien dans la ville
,
" which
, yeah
, improved over hte origional
,
but not by much
. disney
' s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right nowe
, only creatively
. in teh rush tothe ship outloud a film for distri
bution
, disney hasnt forgotten tothe give tihs film a littel thing called
" magic
.
" such scenes as dancing flubber
, a flying car
, a basketball team that preety much sucks flying all aroud thanks to soem carefully placed flubber
, adn an elaborate ending all fail to amaze
, delight
, or even cause people to laugh
. i sat htere thge entire film stone faced
, chuckling perhaps twice
, adn shaking my head at all the bad jokes
. who could realyl laff at a scene where philip enters tghe wrong classroom adn starts teaching chemestry
? didn
' t htink so
. it doesn
' t help that our protagonist isnt essentialy unfunny or even realy respectable
. philip is nto a lovable absent minded professory
, just a really dumb man bieng played by robin williams
. williams is a briliant comic actor
.
.
. okay
, a briliant ator iin general
, bu here he
' s given vyer little tothe do bu occasionally git hyper over something
,
and other times ect sad
. those times
, he
' s not bad
.
but what are we suppossed tothe think of a man who
' s forgotten his wedding thrice
? maybe it ws funny annd
/ or respectable inthe the 60s
.
.
. i like disney
,
and i usually enjoy thier films
, not onyl animated
but live action
, annd thier reccent films
( sive forthe
" hercules
,
" which was good
, bu not grat
) have been worse than lackluster
, they
' ve been pathetic
.
" jungle 2 jungle
" is probably tyhe worst film i saw last yera
.
" flubber
"
' s probably second
. wqat dont they need tothe do
? perhaps create something new
. get writers who can write something thgat
' s universally entertaining
. films liuke
" tyhe pajent trap
"
and
" mary poppins
" are films that are live acation
( or inaddition the latter case a mix ofthe both
)
, bu even i can still watch them beccause tehy
' re not only wroten to be magical tothe children
, bu tothe be funn tothe adults
. whta
' s more torturous that tkaing a child tothe a film that insults you
and annoys ytou at eveyr turn
?
and my god
, couldn
' t they ahev done something else with edie mcclurg
?
