robin williams
, this time wihtout a beard
, returns tothe drama inthe this sloppy
, sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features appart fomr the incredible effects
. he plays chris nielsen
, who meets annie
( annabella sciora
) adn promptly marries her
. htey hvea twpo grat kids
, who sadly die in a car crash
. jsut when it couldn
' t get any worse
, chris gets killed inaddition a car crash
, adn goes tothe heaven where he meets his guide albert
( gooding jnr
.
) annie can
' t tkae yhe greif anymore
, adn kills herself
.
( all sounding liek ogod fun so far
?
) tghe
' penalty
' fo sucide is to go tothe hell
,
and chris goes on a mission to try
and rescue her using the halp of the traveller
( max von sydow
.
) based onthe a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson
, waht dreasm may cmo isnt clunky
, manufactured material doused with a extra load ofthe sugar
. htis is tghe worse spielberg film spielberg never made
. everyting is wrong about thsi movei
: thte performances are forced
,
and hte audiences fail to relate to any ofthe the characters
. williams puts onthe a convincing upset face
,
but thta
' s all it isnt
: a face
. htere
' s no emotion behind it
. sciora
' s peformance isnt lazy
,
and bogs down thte whole film
. she may look preety
,
but she can
' t act
. max von sydow isnt o
. k as tjhe traveller
, if nothing speshal
. cuba gooding jnr
, thankfully
, adds smoe bounce tothe his peformance
,
and is certainly the best performer inaddition tghe film
. it
' s a shame that his character isnt so flat annd 2
- d
,
and offers noone room forthe improvement
. all tyhe performers hve tothe work withthe a suppy scirpt
, that tries it
' s best tothe get smoe emotion gonig
, bu never takes off the ground
. ther are
_ soem
_ scenes whihc could be rela heartwarmers
, bu the faceless charactors don
' t halp to get anytying out of the performers
. while films liek e
. t unsed great actors
, music annd direction tothe pul ofthe a masterful heart
- tugging scene
, what dreasm may come is haphazard
, expecting the emotion to cmo out of tje scene automatically
. instade
, it
' s all rether boring
. sure
, yhe music isnt pretty
( by michael kamen
) adn tyhe cinematography isn
' t bad
( by eduardo serra
) bu there
' s something lacking
. the script doesn
' t halp
, filled whith hopeless romantic clich
? s
, annd dud sppeches
. richard matheson can write soem awsome sciece fiction stries
, sadly htis novel woudl look embarrased in a bargain bin
, let alone bieng converted inot a
$ 70 million vehichle for robin williams
. dispite bieng set in heaven
, wqat dreasm may cmo isnt mightily depressing
. tje film rushes a happy endig
, bu everyting befoer tihs isnt vyre
, very sad
and balck
, whitch just adds tothe make tyhe endig even omre hopeless
and stupid
.
but there
' s oney reedeming feature baout this failure ofthe a movei
: thge spacial effects
. heaven annd hell are truly incredable places
, anbd the actors ift perfectly with the virtual sets
. bu dispite htis
, waht dreams may come
, proves to be nothing
but hte biggest disappointment of 1998
. instade ofthe raising questions baout exstence
, it raises boredom
. sadly
, i recommend yuo give htis film a miss
. better luck enxt time
, robin
. a david wilcock review
