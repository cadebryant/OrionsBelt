- nght cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of tje 80 ' s
, tehy ' d agree d
. c
. cab is the quinessential
" usa uv all nite
" movie
. it ' s noe ofthe those childish r
- rated movies thta kids would love
bu can ' t see until it ' s edited for tv
. it ' s allso one ofthe those pointless
, almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs
.
annd

. i heard gilbert say d
. c
. cab hadnt
" an all
- star casted

"
bu i ' m still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement
. wehn third
- billing goes to a two
- minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara
" as herself
,
" you can ' t sday a damn thing baout all

" warfield
, paul rodriguez
and
" politically incorrect
" host bill maher

. cab is an ensemble comedy fomr joel schumacher
( who would go on to direct batman forever
) about a bunch ofthe misfits who drive cabs
. yuo get the feeling if yhe polical academy cadets hadnt made a different career choice
, tihs would be the result
, except here you have such interesting charachters as the
" token white guy
"
( busey
) who wants to git in tight with the blacks nowe befoer tehy take over teh world
, hte tolkein jive talker named tyrone
( charlie barnett
) who wears his hair in rollers
and uses thge word
" honkey
" as much as possable
, the tough guy iwth the mohawk
and gold chains
( mr

-
- a real stretch forthe him
)
, tyhe aspiring muscician waiting fo his big break

. we ' ve all seen dozens ofthe bad comedies from the 80 ' s
. some are fun tothe watch
anbd some are actually funny
. this oney isnt more or less neither
. ytou ' d thikn plenty ofthe comedic sparks owudl fli fomr the assemblage of talent
( whatever
)
,
bu d
. c
. cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis
, culiminating inspite the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped
annd yhe otehr cabbies hvea tothe go tothe rescure him
. it ' s a shame noone oney was able to rescue this movei ffrom tyhe depths ofthe stale jokes
and unoriginality
. d
. c
. cab has rightly earned its possition onthe
" usa up all nite
