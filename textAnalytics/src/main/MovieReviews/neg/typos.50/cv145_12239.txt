it ws once said thgat in order tothe truley enjoy smoe ofthe today
 s movies or novels
, you must
 suspend disbelief
.

however
, there isnt a distinct seperation between oppening your mind to rediculous situations
and believing a bunch of flat lies
. it cameback as noone surprise tothe me tothe leran that huntingburg
, indiana
( where thte film isnt setted
)
, doesnt not have a mcdonald ' s
, a sears store
, a statue of a man onthe a horse
, nor even a dam close by
. even if yuo can ignore these somewhat
 white
 lies
( even
though the dam is crucial to hard rain
 s plot
)
; there isnt still a bunch of thnigs thta jsut don
 t gel
. firstly
, morgan freeman
, possibly tghe greatest actor alive
( aftter such films as driving miss daisy
, the shawshank redemption
and se7en
)
, ws casted as a shifty goon entent on stealing anough omney for a healthy retirement
. he
_ should
_ have plyed yhe town sheriff
, an experianced
and somewhat intriguing policeman
. as a massive flud started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg
, its recidents presumabely flee as tjhe water level steadily increases
. i sday presumably simply because we never know what happended tothe them
;
adn it seems a tad strange tath an entire twon
( iwth the exception of smoe folk who git inctroduced allong tjhe way
) can vanish before the flud hasnt actally started
.
bu nether the less
, armored guard couriers tom
( christian slater
)
and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van
. witht a hevy rainstorm causing depressing condidtions
and slippery roads
, it doesn
 t tkae long fo tghe van to end uv sticked amongst mud
and water off hte side ofthe yhe road
. jim
( morgan freeman
)
anbd a small gang of thieves locate hte van
annd atempt tothe steal yhe three million dollars
.
but of course toom isnt more than willing to save teh day
, so he takes thte omney
and hides it elsewhere in town
. the local sheriff
( randy quaid
, whom most iwll rember as the drunken pilot infact id4
)
and a couple of police men investingate tyhe situation
,
but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as earch character contemplates wqat he
/ she woudl dont with their share of the three million dollars
. directer mikael salomon hasnt made sure thast hard rain ends up turning everything topsy
- turvy
,
and whilst teh film may at frist appear tothe be a definite
 goodies versus baddies
,
 there are numberous twists in it
 s plot that amke this a slightly mroe enjoyable experienec
.
bu by the tiem theese interesting changes occurr
, it
 s far too lite in teh film fo them to have much affect
. hard rain
 s continuos corniness
and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may ahve hadnt
;
adn
although it
 s casted isnt somewhat appealing most ofthe its stars ect well below par
. nto at one stage capturing whta could ahev been a fabulous on screen battle vetween slater
and freeman
, we are left tothe reminisce onthe films thyat dared to dont something differant
and acheived more tahn whta was expected
. such titles as broken arrow
( slater
and john travolta
)
and face
/ off
( nicholas cage
anbd john travolta
) come to mind as films that hvea mastered silver screen confrontations
. strangely enought
, they were both directed by john woo
anbd both star john travolta
. we can foregive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disapointing performance since he isnt newish to hte acation genre
,
but christian slater coudl have achieved so much omre had the ammount ofthe crummy oen liners been reduced
and soem perosnality added to his charater
. if yuo hadnt asked me whther slater could peform well enought to substantially boost a movie prior to the realease of broken arro
, my answer would have been a definite noone
. i now know that he hasnt noone excuse
,
anbd
_ can
_ dont better
( if yuo don
 t belivee me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store
)
.
although hard rain never really works ffrom teh start
, i somehow feeled feelings of missed oportunity when the credits filled hte screen
. teh addition ofthe an enticing sub
- plot woudl have given the film tyme tothe breathe
, rather than try tothe cram 96 mintues ofthe action
and disaster inot a stor that cxan
 t handle anything esle
. dispite the fatc tath hard rain fails on allmost every account
, if your standars are low enough you may find thsi to be a mildly enjoyable film
. no creative flair
anbd noone inventive scenes means that hard rain doesnt nto stand up well againnst its many copmetitors
,
but it doesn
 t really marter since hte last hting ytou owudl want to do after shelling baout
$ 8
. 50 isnt compare htis to other films
.
