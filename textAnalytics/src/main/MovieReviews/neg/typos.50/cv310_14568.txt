i
' m not sure if silvio horta wroet urban legend before or after the success of scream
,
but i
' m guessing affter just becuase it seems he may nto hvae hadnt time tothe wriet a second draft
. seriously
, this idea
-
- a pyscho bumping off peopel infront the sytle of urban legends
-
- is a great one adn i wish it coudl have been pulled off
. thte first sign of trouble comes wih the painfully insipid dialogue
. an example
:
" tath
[ car crash
] must
' ve been awful
.
.
. for everyone involved
.
" ytou can tell that tghe writer intended thast something a little more airy ws supposed to ahve beeen said
, just noone one figured outloud what
. i knwo inthe slasher movies htere isn
' t supposed to be a lot ofthe grat characterization
and i mysef don
' t mind cardboard cutouts
, bu please don
' t let the cutouts be so damn bl
and
. noe reason movies liek scream
, star wars
and diva ahev become so treasured is beacuse they feature charismatic actors palying interesting cahracters
. aside ffrom jared leto
and joshua jackson
( who aren
' t onthe the screen long anough
) noone noe in urban legend makes thge grade
. alicia witt shows none ofthe hte acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill
, rebecca gayheart actally looks unattractive
( nto tothe mention as dumb as a post thru 3
/ 4 of tghe film
) adn robert englund jstu cruises on auto pilot
. ogod thing brad dourif is here
, bu wait
.
.
. he
' s only inaddition tghe movei for five minutes
_ anbd
_ he
' s jstu redoing his good
- natured stuttering charater from oen flw over thte cuckoo
' s nest
. which brings me tothe anohter aspect ofthe urban legend
: it
' s unoriginality
. thge film most blatantly ripped off is scream
( anohter reason thyat makes me htink silvio horta wrote this aftter craven
' s
and williamson
' s great success
)
. urban legend trys to deconstruct modern
- day folklore much tghe same way scream deconstructed slasher films
, bu it doesn
' t quite suceed
. it
' s best stab at self
- reflexivity isnt poking fun at
" that girl in tghe noxzeema ad
"
( ie
, rebecca gayheart
) we also hvea another killer
- taunting
- his
- victum
- on
- the
- phone routine in urban legend
and quick
, what movie isnt this excange of dialogue from
: female protagnoist
: why
? villain
: why
? why
?
!
? congradulations tothe thsoe ofthe ytou who anwsered scream anbd
/ or urban legend
. like i said
, this movie could
' ve beeen great
. if only silvio hadnt worked or been alowed tothe owrk a little longer onthe the script
. still
, at least urban legend hadnt smoe preety cool death scenes
and a somewhat realized whodunit angl wich makse tihs slasher isnt waaaayyyyyy better thna i nkow what ytou did last summer
.
