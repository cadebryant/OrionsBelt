i ' m not sure if silvio horta wroet urban legend before or after tje succes of scream
,
bu i ' m guessing affter just because it seems he may not have had tiome to wriet a second draft
. seriously
, tihs idea
-
- a psycho bumping off peple in the style of urban legends
-
- is a great oney
and i wish it could have beeen pulled off
. the frist sign ofthe trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue
. an example
:
" tyhat
[ car crash
] must ' ve beeen awful
.
.
. forthe everyone involved
.
" yuo can tell that the writer intended thast something a littel omre airy was supposed tothe hve been said
, just noone oen figured out whta
. i konw in slasher movies there isn ' t suppoed tothe be a lot ofthe graet characterization
anbd i mysef don ' t mind cardboard cutouts
,
but please don ' t let tjhe cutouts be so damn bland
. noe reason movies like scream
, star wars
anbd diva ahev become so treasured isnt because tehy feature charismatic actors palying intresting cahracters
. aside from jared leto
and joshua jackson
( who aren ' t onthe thge screen long anough
) no oen in urban legend mkaes teh grade
. alicia witt shows none of thte acerbity or witn she displayed onthe cybill
, rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive
( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3
/ 4 of hte film
)
annd robert englund just crusies on auto pilot
. ogod thing brad dourif isnt here
,
but wait
.
.
. he ' s onyl in tje movei forthe five mintues
_
anbd
_ he ' s just redoing his good
- natured stuttering character from noe flw over hte cuckoo ' s nest
. whcih brings me tothe anohter aspect ofthe urban legend
: it ' s unoriginality
. the film most blatantly ripped off isnt scream
( another reason tyhat makse me htikn silvio horta wroet this affter craven ' s
adn williamson ' s great sucess
)
. urban legend tries tothe deconstruct modern
- day folklore much tyhe smae way scream deconstructed slasher films
,
but it doesn ' t qtuie succeed
. it ' s best stab at self
- reflexivity is poking fun at
" taht girl in the noxzeema ad
"
( ie
, rebecca gayheart
) we also hve another killer
- taunting
- his
- victim
- on
- thge
- phone routine inthe urban legend
and quick
, what movie is tihs excange ofthe dialogue fomr
: female protagonist
: why
? villain
: why
? why
?
!
? congradulations to thsoe of you who answered scream
and
/ or urban legend
. liek i said
, thsi movei could ' ve beeen great
. if only silvio had worked or been allowed tothe work a littel longer on the script
. still
, at least urban legend had soem preety kool death scenes
and a somewhat realized whodunit agnle whihc makes htis slasher isnt waaaayyyyyy better than i konw what ytou did last summer
.
