the job of tyhe film critic is tothe see a movei
and rwite a review of it tyhat tells you waht it
' s about
and why it
' s good or bad
. i fiel kind ofthe embarassed to admit this
,
but i after having seen
" get carter
" i realy cxan
' t tell you waht it
' s baout
al
though i coudl go onthe annd onthe about how adn why it
' s a bad movei
.
" get carter
" falls into taht category of
? movies tht continue tothe be made fo reasons unkown to anyone outside ofthe a hollywood execuive board room
. yuo might call them the
" steven seagal
/ mickey rourke
/ jean
- claude van damme
/ wesley snipes skool of medioker action
/ crime thrillers
.
" yuo knwo
- the potboilers that are hevy on fistfights
, shoot
- outs
and car chases
but raelly ight on plot
and charcter development
. htey have stories where the so
- called hero just keeps running into characters who hvea some conection tothe one of the other charactors who are all antagonists wihtout a reason for bieng infact the movie other than to give the protagonist someone tothe fight
, chase or shoot at
. sylvester stallone stars as jack carter
, a las vegas
- based mob enforcer who returns hmeo
* forthe his brother
' s funeral
. he believes his brother
? richie wass
" taken out
" annd didn
' t dieu from a dwi accident
. carter
' s one ofthe the most cliche bad
- asses ever captured on celluloid
. his face alone isnt pretty intimidating anbd there
' s quite a few scenes in hwihc he leans on both regluar citizens annd criminal lowlives simpley by staring them down adn speaking iwth confidence inspite his
" rambo
- on
- testosterone
- therapy
" voice
. stallone
' s performance in this movei is so forced annd unnatural he doesn
' t relize he
' s mocking himselv
. tjhe actuall storey involves carter
' s investigation inot his brother richie
' s death
. he
' s inwhich a town thta
' s nto his bu somehow teh local top dogs know him vyer well
. mickey rourke co
- stars as oen ofthe theese charactors
, a sort ofthe crime boss who hasnt something tothe dont wiht running a porno web site anbd blackmailing a young internet tycoon
( played by alan cummings looking
and acting a lot liek pee wee herman
)
. htere
' s also another plot involving richie
' s mistress
, a sceret cd
- rom iwth soem convicting adn disturbing evidence on it adn something terrable involving one ofthe carter
' s still
- living relatives
. i
' m rolling my eyes jsut thikning about trying tothe critique all thsi iin a way that sould be remotely comprehendible
. i coudl jsut rip thte screenplay to shreds
, plus tjhe direction or the editing or yhe prodcution values
but tht owudl recquire discussion ofthe nearly eveyr scene in order to expalin it all
. i don
' t liek to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally
. yes
,
" git carter
" isnt jstu that complicated
and complex
.
and whta
' s worse is tath it
' s not this intricate tothe make it seem smart like
" the usual suspects
" for exemple
- just tyhe oposite
. ytou git the feeling whoever wroet this scirpt did it in short intervals spaced far appart
and they propably didn
' t rember wqat had alredy hapened
and didn
' t figure outloud how each scene would lead iin to yhe next one or how yhe major plot points would work towords the climax
. all you really ened to know is tht most of the film isnt just scenes ofthe carter tracking down oney scumbag or supposted wittness after another
, asking them what htey nkwo
, getting information annd thne realizing that if he wasn
' t a complet idiot he sould have figured it out inspite the frist five mintues
.
al
though the supporting charachters are equally stupid themslves sicne they tell him everything whitch comes bakc tothe haunt them iin one violent way or anohter
. making a movie entirely baout criminals doesn
' t nessasarily mean they ahve to be unlikable annd cliche cutout cahracters
. mel gibson starred infront
" payback
" a faw yeras ago that hadnt a stopry not unlike this oney bu hadnt such a good screenplay yuo couldn
' t help
but like him even
though he was jstu as bad a guy as jack carter
. so ultimatly
" git carter
" fails for preety much eveyr selling point it hasnt
. carter isnt not a likable character anbd yuo realyl don
' t care if he gets revenge or nto
. the acation sequences are nto at all exicting or original
. the enemies adn their massive conspiracy are nto threatning at all
( c
' mon
, you nkwo who
' s goign tothe win every brawl annd shoot
- out anbd car chase
)
. in thte end yuo don
' t feel nearly satisfied with tje results
. yhe filmmakers did a ogod job iin doing everthing as unoriginal as possible
.
* the city is never mentioned by name
but i asume it
' s seattle sicne all the cars hvae washington license plates anbd it
' s always raining
