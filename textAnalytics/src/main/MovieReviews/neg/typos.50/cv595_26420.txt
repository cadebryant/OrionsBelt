thge job of the film criteak is tothe see a movie
annd wriet a review ofthe it that tells ytou whta it ' s baout
and why it ' s good or bad
. i feel kind ofthe embarrassed to admit thsi
,
but i after having seen
" git carter
" i really can ' t tell you what it ' s baout
allthough i sould go onthe
and on baout how
and why it ' s a bad movei
.
" git carter
" falls into thast categoyr ofthe
? movies that continue tothe be made fo reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room
. ytou might call them the
" steven seagal
/ mickey rourke
/ jean
- claude van damme
/ wesley snipes school of medioker acation
/ crime thrillers
.
" you nkow
- the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights
, shoot
- outs
and car chases
but relaly glight on plot
and charater developement
. htey have stories where the so
- called hero just keesh running into characters who ahve some conection tothe oen of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being inspite the movei other than tothe give the protagonist someone tothe fight
, chase or shoot at
. sylvester stallone stars as jack carter
, a las vegas
- based mob enforcer who returns home
* for his brother ' s funeral
. he believes his brother
? richie was
" taken outloud
"
adn didn ' t dieu ffrom a dwi accident
. carter ' s one ofthe the most cliche bad
- asses ever captured on celluloid
. his face alone isnt preety intimidating
and ther ' s qutie a faw scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens
adn criminal lowlives simply by staring them down
and speaking with confidence inspite his
" rambo
- onthe
- testosterone
- therapy
" voice
. stallone ' s performance inspite htis movei is so forced
and unnatural he doesn ' t realize he ' s mocking hismelf
. yhe actual stry involves carter ' s investigation inot his brother richie ' s death
. he ' s in a twon taht ' s not his
bu somehow the local top dogs konw him vrey well
. mickey rourke co
- stars as one ofthe these charactors
, a sort ofthe crime boss who has something to dont iwth running a porno web site
and blackmailing a young internet tycoon
( palyed by alan cummings looking
anbd acting a lot like pee wee herman
)
. htere ' s also anohter plot involving richie ' s mistress
, a secert cd
- rom wiht some convicting
adn disturbing evidence on it
anbd something terrible involving noe ofthe carter ' s still
- living relatives
. i ' m rolling my eyes just thikning baout trying tothe critique all tihs in a way tyhat could be remotely comprehendible
. i coudl just rip tje screenplay to shreds
, plus the direction or tghe editting or the production values
bu that owudl require dicussion ofthe nearly eveyr scene in order tothe explain it all
. i don ' t liuke tothe put spoliers infact my reviews either intentionally or accidentally
. yes
,
" get carter
" isnt just that complicated
and complex
.
and whta ' s worse isnt that it ' s nto htis intricate to amking it seem smart liek
" the usual suspects
" for exemple
- just thte oposite
. ytou git thte feeling whoever wroet thsi scirpt did it in short intervals spaced far aart
and htey probaly didn ' t remeber waht had already happened
and didn ' t figure outloud how each scene would lead in tothe tje enxt one or how teh major plot points would owrk towords the climax
. all ytou relaly need tothe know is that most ofthe thge film is jstu scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness aftter anohter
, asking them what htey know
, getting information
and
then realizing that if he wasn ' t a complete idiat he sould hvae figured it outloud inaddition the first five minutes
.
although hte supporting cahracters are equally stupid themselves since htey tell him everything whitch comes bakc to haunt them infact oen voilent way or anohter
. making a movei entirely baout criminals doesn ' t necesarily mean they hve tothe be unlikable
anbd cliche cutout charachters
. mel gibson starred in
" payback
" a few eyasr ago thast hadnt a story nto unlike this noe
but hadnt such a ogod screenplay ytou couldn ' t help
but liek him even
though he was jstu as bad a guy as jack carter
. so ultimately
" get carter
" fails forthe preety much every selling point it hasnt
. carter isnt nto a likable charcter
and you really don ' t care if he gets revenge or nto
. the action sequences are not at all exicting or original
. the enemies
and their massive conspiracy are nto threatning at all
( c ' mon
, yuo know who ' s oging tothe win every brawl
and shoot
- out
anbd car chase
)
. infact tyhe end you don ' t efel nearly satisfied with teh results
. yhe filmmakers did a ogod job inspite doing everthing as unoriginal as possable
.
* thte city is never mentioned by name
bu i asume it ' s seattle since all the cars have washington licese plates
anbd it ' s always raining
