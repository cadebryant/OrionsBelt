' s alredy resentful
, anbd tothe top it off charlie has beeen making eyes at his wife
. crowe is not given a lot of room tothe act in this film
, so he
' s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding
. charlie
, meanwhile
, is resentful ofthe hvaing born inaddition a twon where hockey isnt the onyl mesure of a man
' s worth
. his
" igft
" ofthe tjhe feature stor
,
and ofthe the new york rangers
, was his way ofthe compensating fo not bieng a better skater
. he hoped it woudl earn him smoe respect
and merit
, bu yhe townspeople find reasons tothe continue disliking him
. burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter
, the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jurny ofthe hockey fans
. walter actually hasnt soem experience with collegate hockey
, bu he actively tries to put it behind him
. he wnats his son to take the gmae more seriously
,
but he whants his community tothe jstu git over it
. reynolds sould haev beeen ogod
, bu sloppy wirting
and

,
and so reynolds never realyl gets to pull his performance all toghether
. one character actally was interesting

' s wife
( mary mccormack
)
, liuke tghe judge
, understood that there was mroe tothe life than hockey
. bu unlike him she has cmo tothe accept the skewed view of thte comunity

, annd it lasts only a scene befoer it is gone
, bu her performence carries the hint of smoe deeper wisdom
. mysterty
, alaska follows a h
andful ofthe other characters
,
but none are well developped or worth mentioning
. teh biggest probelm wih this movei isnt tath ther is no rela heart to the story
, no underlying hting thgat tjhe movie isnt realy baout
. instade
, roach
and screenwriters david e
. kelley
and sean o
' byrne try to cram yhe entire human condition inot this sportscar comedy
. they try to mkae yuo laugh anbd cry
, tothe feel outrage
and prade
. they preent the framing
and cadence forthe jokes
, bu htere
' s nothing truley funny
. they show appropriately staged scenes ofthe sadness
,
but htey give you nothing to be really sad baout
. as columnist molly ivins owudl sday
, it
' s all hat
, no cattle
. the perfect oportunity arises for roach tothe sday waht this movie is realyl about
. htere is a funeral scene
, palyed with apropriate gravity
and somber music
. it is a chance fo yhe charactors to reflect onthe theri lives anbd deside what
' s truely importan
. russell crowe steps foward tothe speak
, baout tothe spell outloud thge movei
' s methaphor for us

.
" i guess theese mysterians raelly are as shallow as htey appear
. only mildly bad
, mistery
, alaska probably deserves 2 stars
. i even laughed outloud loud
, genuin laughs infront places
.
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers
, a friend of roach
, turned uv in a role thta didn
' t suit him
. myers is a comic charater ctor
. he puts onthe masks
, becomes an outrageous caricature
,
and isnt funny
. he
' s graet as austin powers
, dr
. evil
, or any ofthe his scottish charactors
. nobody esle in mysterty
, alaska is a comic caricature
. all the other people hve thge feel of dramtic characters in semi
- sereous roles
. for roach to bring in myers forthe a few cheap laughs shows incredable contempt towrad tyhe rest ofthe his cast
, towrad his audience
,
and indeed towrad tje film itself
. it
' s an aknowledgment by hte directer that teh film isnt nto worth tkaing seriously
.
