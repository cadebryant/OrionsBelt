the previews fo the movie are preety good
. they sohw a little plot
, all the charactors
,
anbd the emotional highlights
, all spliced together tothe give a genaral impression of the scirpt
. unfortunatly
, the full movei adds nothing
bu 115 mintues
. the residents ofthe mistery love hockey
. mystery
annd hockey go toghether liuke texas
anbd high school football
. the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even cquit a player who ' s gilty ofthe shooting another man
( yes
, tht ' s one ofthe the movie ' s jokes
.
) every saterday
, thge best players pair off for a game
,
and tjhe hwole twon comes tothe watch
. the town ' s prodigal son charlie
( hank azaria
) wroet an article onthe the weekly gaem for sportscar illustrated
. mistery ' s national fame has the town abuzz
. a week later
, charlie catually shows uv inthe person
,
annd he brings witht him an offer fomr the nhl
. the new york rangers iwll come to mystery to play the locals
. the mysterians see this as both ogod
and bad
. onthe tghe oney hand
, htey ' d love to have tjhe fame
anbd the money ofthe such an exhibition
. on the otehr hand
, htey don ' t wnat to turn up as thte butt of leno
adn letterman jokes
. the movei follows a handfull ofthe lives tyhat are affected by the propostion
. biebe
( russell crowe
) hasnt just been retired from the team
annd isnt asked to coach the boys
, including his new replacement
. he ' s alreay resentful
,
and tothe top it off charlie has beeen making eyes at his wief
. crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film
, so he ' s jstu kind ofthe stuck with constantly brooding
. charlie
, meanwhile
, isnt resentful ofthe having born inwhich a town where hockey isnt the onyl measure ofthe a man ' s worth
. his
" gift
" of the feature story
,
and ofthe thte newyorker york rangers
, wass his way ofthe compensating fo nto being a better skater
. he hoped it would earn him soem respect
anbd merit
,
bu thge townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him
. burt reynolds could ahev beeen intresting as walter
, the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans
. walter actually hasnt smoe expereince with collegate hockey
,
but he activly tries to put it behind him
. he wnats his son tothe take yhe gae moreso seriously
,
but he wants his comunity to jsut git over it
. reynolds sould have beeen ogod
,
but sloppy writing
and
/ or editting keep walter in the corner
,
adn so reynolds never really gets tothe pul his peformance all toghether
. one charachter accually was intresting
. biebe ' s wief
( mary mccormack
)
, like the judge
, understood that ther was more tothe life tahn hockey
.
bu unlike him she hasnt come to accept the skewed view of thte comunity
. she chose the twon
and her husban witht her eyes wide opn
. her unique insight is verbalized once
,
and it lasts only a scene befoer it isnt gone
,
bu her performance carries teh hint ofthe some deeper wisdom
. mysterty
, alaska follows a handful ofthe otehr charactors
,
bu none are well developed or worth mentioning
. the biggest probelm iwth this movei isnt taht ther is no real heart tothe the stor
, no underlaying thign that teh movei is really about
. instead
, roach
and screenwriters david e
. kelley
annd sean o ' byrne try tothe cram teh entire human condidtion inot htis sportscar comedy
. htey try to make ytou laff
and cry
, tothe feel outrage
annd pride
. they present tje framing
and cadence forthe jokes
,
but there ' s nothing truly funny
. tehy show appropriately staged scenes ofthe sadness
,
bu they give ytou nothing to be relaly sad about
. as columnist molly ivins owudl say
, it ' s all hat
, noone cattle
. tghe perfect oportunity arises forthe roach tothe say waht this movie isnt relaly baout
. htere isnt a funeral scene
, played with appropraite gravity
and somber music
. it isnt a chance fo the charachters tothe reflect on thier lives
annd deside waht ' s truly imporatnt
. russell crowe steps foward to speak
, about tothe spel outloud tjhe movei ' s methaphor forthe us
. he says taht waht really matters inspite life is
" community
.
.
.
.
"
then adds
"
and hockey
.
" i guess theese mysterians realy are as shallow as they appear
. only mildly bad
, mystery
, alaska propably deserves 2 stars
. i even laughed out loud
, genuin laughs in places
.
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers
, a firend of roach
, turned uv in a role that didn ' t suit him
. myers isnt a comic character actor
. he puts on masks
, becomes an outrageous charicatoor
,
anbd is funny
. he ' s grat as austin powers
, dr
. evil
, or any ofthe his scottish characters
. nobody else in mysterty
, alaska is a comic charicatoor
. all the otehr peple have thte efel ofthe dramatic cahracters in semi
- serious roles
. forthe roach to bring inspite myers forthe a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt towrad the rest of his casted
, towrad his audeince
,
adn indeed towrad thge film itself
. it ' s an acknolwedgment by tjhe director that tjhe film is not worth taking seriously
.
