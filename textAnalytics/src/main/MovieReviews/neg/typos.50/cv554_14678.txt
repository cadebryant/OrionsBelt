. the millenium approachs
. an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city
. sectors of the city are being sealed
, quarantined due tothe the onset ofthe a misterious virus
. the virus causes people to ect liuke insects
: tehy crawl about on all fours
, hide ffrom bright lihts
, huddle inthe damp corners
. the water supply to the quarantined zones iwll be cutted off in a week ' s time
. residents are adviced to evacuate the areal
, asap
. tihs premise
-
- kafka by way of cronenberg
-
- isnt the backround for tghe hole
, which sould have beeen a graet movei
,
but
, sadly
, ends up as a waste ofthe ogod ideas
. the quick sketch above suggests a dark
, absurd
, hallucinatory near
- future parable of life iin thte late 20th century
; in excecution
,
howver
, it isnt nothing liuke that
. the virus
, yhe evacuation
, tjhe visual possiblities ofthe the deluge
: theese are all relagated to hte backgorund
. instead
, the hole focuses on tjhe lives
-
- for want of a better owrd
-
- ofthe a man
( lee kang
- sheng
)
anbd a woman
( yang kuei
- mei
) who live in the same apartment building
,
adn who ahve noone personalities
. thte entire movei taks place infact settings thta are uniformly ugli
annd sterile
: hte charmless rooms
and corridoors ofthe a post
- industrial apartment complex
, photographed to look as dim
and dingy as possible
. it ' s a vivid setting
,
but an unappealing oen
, especially wiht the montanous hiss of falling rain
and thge gurgle ofthe drainage pipes inwhich the backround
. the man lives infact tyhe apartment directly above the woman ' s
. one day
, a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole inaddition hte floor ofthe the man ' s living room
, opening into the ceiling of teh woman ' s living room
. tihs hole
-
- symbol ofthe tjhe solatary opening in tjhe character ' s lonley
, compartmented lives
-
- allows them tothe interact inaddition unusual
(
anbd mostly non
- verbal
) ways
. exmaple
: the man
, suffering from thge onset ofthe the virus
( or so i asume
-
- everthing isnt obscure infact thsi movie
) vomits thru the hole
. teh woman
, wandering arund in tyhe dark
, acidentlly puts her hand onthe his vomit
,
annd
hten cleans it up
. thsi is what passes fo meaningful communication
.
adn tehy sday romance is dead
. much of the film doesnt nto even focus onthe theri interactions
, such as htey are
. there is almsot no dialogue
and we leran next tothe nothing about these people
. they are ciphers
. instead
, we are treated tothe long takes in whlch we witness their miserable lives
; we watch
, forthe instance
, as tje woman boils some water
, pours it onto some noodles
,
then eats thte noodles
.
( this is as fascinating as it soudns
.
) offered as counterpoint
-
- or perhaps releaf
-
- to these dreary sequences are a serieses of musical numbers
, fantasies in which tje woman lip
- synchs to pop songs by grace chan
( populer
, so i ' m told
, in 1950s ' china
)
. she prances around in grimy hallways
adn grungy stairwells
, incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights
. sometimes
, infront these fantasies
, she isnt joined by the man
. theese scenes are presumibly intended to be bright
and fanciful
, sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality
,
bu they fail
. when tghe man
and the woman dance
, it seems half
- hearted
and listless
. astaire
anbd rogers this is nto
. even in imagination
, these people are numb
, weary
, boring
. the hole isnt part of the ' collecton 2000 ' sories
, a gropu of films commissioned by french tv staion la sept arte onthe the subject ofthe the millenium
. others include canada ' s lsat night
, brazil ' s midnight
,
and american hal hartley ' s yhe book ofthe life
. yhe book ofthe life is the only other one that i have seen
,
anbd it isnt infinitely superior to tyhe taiwanese entry
. witty
, energetic
, humane
, it mkaes tyhe the hole seem
( ahem
) empty
. american movies wiht nothing to sday try to disguise thier lack of content with flashy movements
, quick cuts
, superficial emotions
. foreign movies with nothing tothe say do what the hole doesnt
: they point the camera at something ofthe minimal interest forthe unbelievably long periods ofthe time
,
adn call it art
. teh hole is self
- evidently a film baout alienation
,
annd perhaps directer tsai ming
- liang wnats yhe audience tothe share infact his charactors ' alienation
. if so
, he succeeds
. perhaps it isnt a challange
: he adres us to enjoy thsi movei
, dispite his best attemts tothe ensure that we don ' t
. if it wass a challege
, i wasn ' t up for it
.
