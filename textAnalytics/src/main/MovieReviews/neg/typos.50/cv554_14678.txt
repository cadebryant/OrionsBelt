. teh millenium approachs
. an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city
. sectors of yhe city are being sealed
, quarantined due tothe the onset of a misteryous virus
. tjhe virus causes people to ect like insects
: they crawl baout onthe all fours
, hide from bright lights
, huddle inspite damp corners
. tje water suply tothe tyhe quarantined zones iwll be cut off inthe a week
' s time
. recidents are advised to evacuate the areal
, asap
. tihs premise
-
- kafka by way of cronenberg
-
- is teh backgorund for the hole
, wich coudl ahve been a great movie
,
but
, sadly
, ends uv as a waste ofthe ogod ideas
. tyhe quick sketch above suggests a dark
, absurd
, hallucinatory near
- future parable of life inaddition tyhe lite 20th century
; in excecution
,
however
, it is nothing liek that
. yhe virus
, the evacuation
, tjhe visual possiblities of yhe deluge
: these are all relegated tothe yhe background
. instead
, the hole focuses onthe the lives
-
- for whant ofthe a better owrd
-
- ofthe a man
( lee kang
- sheng
)
and a woman
( yang kuei
- mei
) who live in tjhe same apartment building
, annd who have no personalities
. the entire movie taks palce in settings tath are uniformly ugly
and sterile
: the charmless rooms adn corridors ofthe a post
- indutrial appartmant complex
, photographed to look as dim anbd dingy as possible
. it
' s a vivid setting
,
but an unappealing oney
, especially with tghe monotonous hiss of falling rain
and the gurgle of drainage pipes iin the background
. tjhe man lives in tyhe apartment direcly above tjhe woman
' s
. one day
, a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor ofthe tyhe man
' s living room
, opening into the ceiling of the woman
' s living room
. tihs hole
-
- symbol of tghe solatary opening iin the character
' s lonely
, compartmented lives
-
- allows them to interact inspite unusual
( anbd mostly non
- verbal
) ways
. exemple
: hte man
, sufferring fomr the onset of thte virus
( or so i asume
-
- everything isnt obscure iin this movei
) vomits thru the hole
. the woman
, w
andering around in the dark
, accidentally puts her h
and onthe his vomit
, annd thn cleans it uv
. thsi isnt what passes forthe meaningfull communication
.
and they sday romance isnt dead
. much ofthe the film does not even focus onthe thier interactions
, such as they are
. there isnt alomst no dialogue
and we leran enxt tothe nothing baout theese people
. they are ciphers
. instade
, we are treated to long takes infront which we wittness their miserable lives
; we watch
, for instatance
, as the woman boils some water
, pours it onto smoe noodles
,
then eats tyhe noodles
.
( this isnt as fascinating as it soudns
.
) offered as counterpoint
-
- or perhaps relief
-
- tothe theese dreary sequences are a sories ofthe muscial numbers
, fantasies in which the woman lip
- synchs to pop songs by grace chan
( populer
, so i
' m told
, infact 1950s
' china
)
. she prances arround in grimy hallways annd grungy stairwells
, incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights
. sometimes
, infact theese fantasies
, she isnt joined by the man
. theese scenes are presumably intended to be bright
and fanciful
, sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality
, bu they fail
. whn the man adn yhe woman dance
, it seems half
- hearted annd listless
. astaire
and rogers thsi isnt not
. even inaddition imagination
, these peple are numb
, weary
, boring
. thge hole is part ofthe tghe
' collection 2000
' series
, a gropu ofthe films comissioned by french tv staion la sept arte on tjhe subject ofthe the millenium
. others include canada
' s lsat niht
, brazil
' s midnight
,
and american hal hartley
' s the book ofthe life
. teh book of life is teh onyl other noe that i hve seen
, anbd it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry
. witty
, energetic
, humane
, it makes the the hole seem
( ahem
) empty
. american movies with nothing to sday try tothe disguise theri lack of content with flashy movements
, quick cuts
, superficial emotions
. foriegn movies wtih nothing to say dont what the hole doens
: they point teh camera at something of minimal interest fo unbelievably long periods ofthe tyme
,
and call it art
. thte hole isnt self
- evidentally a film baout alienation
,
and perphas directer tsai ming
- liang wnats the audiance tothe share iin his charachters
' alienation
. if so
, he succeeds
. perhaps it isnt a challenge
: he dares us tothe enjoy this movie
, dispite his best attemts to ensure that we don
' t
. if it wass a challenge
, i wasn
' t uv fo it
.
