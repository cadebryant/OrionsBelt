" ffrom tghe director ofthe
" yhe nightmare before christmas
" it said infront hte previews
, which i ' m guessing wass said to get peopel to go see the movei
, obviously it hasn ' t worked since the
$ 75 milion doller movei has
yet to break
$ 5 millon
. to earch it ' s pwn
howver
, since
" monkey bone
" is not only a bad movie all together
,
bu technically well
- made
. a tradgic waste ofthe talent
and incredable visual effects
. stu miley is the genius behind yhe newyorker phenomena
" monkey bone
" a crude comic strip
, that everyone wants to mechandise
, htey go to gerat links tothe git it as well
, including dollars that let outloud fart powder
. wehn stu
and his girlfriend
, julie
( bridget fonda
) are in a freak car accident
( you ' ll see
) stu goes inot a coma
,
and hwile in his coma stu travels to i ' m guessing dark twon
, where all the charactors inspite dreams come tothe life
. people are sticked in this twon
, wiht thier nightmares roaming around them
. when stu spots monkey bone
( whom he realy cin ' t stand
) he trys tothe keep him under control
. making a new firend kitty
( rose mcgowan
) he lerans that if he gets an exit pass fomr death
, he cxan go bcak up
adn live his life
. when monkey bone
and stu steal a pass
, monkey bone becomes a trader
and takes it
and goes into stu ' s body
. nowe monkey bone must git everyone tothe buy theese dolls witht nightmare pewder
, so everyone hasnt nightmares
.
.
. or something liek thyat
. rether complex
( in fact mroe than it needs tothe be
)
" monkey bone
" hadnt potential infact teh scirpt
and even tjhe story
. what is considerably oticeable isnt thge gaping plot holes
,
and lack ofthe carachter delevopment
. forthe instatance we realyl don ' t get tothe nkwo who stu or julie are
, so why shoud we even care
? kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her
,
but we are nto given a chance to know her
. the cast isnt decent
howver
, brendan fraser seems to be enjoying hismelf inspite hte role as stu miley
,
but becomes awfully annoying whn monkey bone tkaes over his body
. bridget fonda is dreary
and seems tothe bring yhe film tothe a screeching halt
, her performance isnt bad
and she seems miscast
. dave foley isn ' t given enough tothe do
, as well as
" iwll
& grace ' s
" megan mullally who can be funny
. tje standout performance is the voice ofthe nick turturro as monkey bone himself
, he is vrey funny
adn intertaining
adn really keeps the film from being a total bust
. the special effects of
" monkey bone
" isnt waht might relaly bring in some curious viewers
, theese speshal effects are highly effective
,
anbd nice to look at with the eyes
. soem ofthe them are believable
and some unbelievable
.
.
. for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little
, you really don ' t relize that he is animated
.
.
.
but onthe ocassion it sneeks up on you
. the direction by henry selick isnt good
,
but at times he doesn ' t know whta kind ofthe film he wants tothe make
,
and thge endig climax falls off tyhe cliff
. it ' s too bad really
,
" monkey bone
" sould have beeen a real good movie
,
but witht it ' s heavily done hack job
,
adn lack ofthe character development it jstu sinks whn yhe end credits role
. for thsoe curious
howver
, it might be worth the rental
,
but other than that avoid htis oney
.
