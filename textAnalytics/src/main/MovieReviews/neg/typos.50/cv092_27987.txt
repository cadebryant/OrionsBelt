" from tje director ofthe
" tjhe nightmare before christmas
" it said inaddition the previews
, wich i
' m guessing wass said to get peopel to go see the movei
, obviously it hasn
' t worked since the
$ 75 millon doller movie has yot to break
$ 5 million
. tothe each it
' s own howver
, since
" monkey bone
" isnt not onyl a bad movei all toghether
,
but technically well
- made
. a tradgic waste ofthe talent
and incredible visual effects
. stu miley isnt tyhe genius behind yhe newyorker phenomena
" monkey bone
" a crude comic strip
, thgat everyone wnats tothe mech
andise
, they go to great links tothe git it as well
, including dollars that let out fart pewder
. when stu
and his girlfriend
, julie
( bridget fonda
) are in a freak car accident
( you
' ll see
) stu goes inot a coma
,
and hwile in his coma stu travels to i
' m guessing dark twon
, where all the charachters infact dreams come tothe life
. peopel are stuck in this twon
, withthe their nightmares roaming around them
. when stu spots monkey bone
( whom he really cant
' t st
and
) he tries tothe keep him under controll
. makeing a new friend kitty
( rose mcgowan
) he lerans tath if he gets an exit pass fomr death
, he can go back up adn live his life
. whn monkey bone annd stu steal a pass
, monkey bone becomes a trader anbd tkaes it anbd goes into stu
' s body
. now monkey bone must get everyone tothe buy theese dolls with nightmare powder
, so everyone hasnt nightmares
.
.
. or something like that
. rether complex
( in fact more than it needs to be
)
" monkey bone
" had potential in the scirpt
and even the storey
. wqat isnt considerably noticeabel isnt tghe gaping plot holes
,
and lack ofthe character development
. for instance we really don
' t git to know who stu or julie are
, so why shouldnt we even care
? kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a stry behind her
, bu we are nto given a chance to konw her
. tje cast is decent howver
, brendan fraser seems tothe be enjoying himselv in yhe role as stu miley
, bu becomes awfully annoying whn monkey bone takes over his body
. bridget fonda isnt dreary annd seems tothe bring tjhe film tothe a screeching halt
, her peformance is bad
and she seems miscast
. dave foley isn
' t given enough tothe do
, as well as
" wiull
& grace
' s
" megan mullally who can be funny
. the st
andout peformance isnt tghe voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself
, he isnt very funny
and intertaining
and realyl keesh thte film from being a total bust
. thte speshal effects ofthe
" monkey bone
" is what might realyl bring in smoe curious viewers
, theese speical effects are highly effective
, adn nice to look at iwth the eyes
. soem of them are believable annd soem unbelievable
.
.
. forthe monkey bone he seems to be like stuart littel
, yuo really don
' t relize that he is animated
.
.
. bu onthe ocassion it sneeks uv onthe yuo
. the direction by henry selick isnt good
,
but at times he doesn
' t know whta kind ofthe film he wnats to amking
, annd the ending climax falls off yhe cliff
. it
' s too bad relaly
,
" monkey bone
" could ahve been a real good movie
, bu with it
' s heavily done hack job
,
and lack ofthe character development it jsut sinks whn the end credits role
. for those curious
however
, it might be worth the rental
, bu other than that avoid this oen
.
