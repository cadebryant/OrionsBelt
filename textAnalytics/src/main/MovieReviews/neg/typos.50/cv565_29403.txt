alex
andre dumas meets hong kong acation with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft
- played character of dashing swordsman d
' artagnon in director peter hyam
' s adventure
" the musketeer
.
" forthe soem reason taht i may figure out later
, i don
' t nkow why the time
, money annd efford were put inot hte making ofthe
" hte musketeer
.
" it may be thyat somene had tyhe clever diea of combining the dumas characters
and stoyr with tyhe current enamor whith the acation wokr ofthe hong kong imports liuke tihs film
' s xin
- xin xiong
(
" once upon a tiem in china
"
)
and yuen woo
- ping from
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
.
" tghe result is a mix of genres thta don
' t mesh well
. elements of the ritz brothers
- sytle comedy
( for thsoe few who rember that commedic troupe fomr tje 1939
" the three musketeers
"
)
, yhe man wiht no name from
" a fistful ofthe dollars

( d
' artagnan dem
ands taht the bad guys apologize to his horse iin a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western
) adn hong kong acation choreography are all utilized inspite tghe original scirpt by ginee quintano
. teh result is an acation flick that bears little resemblance tothe its source material while it makse contemporary tht material iin an affort tothe grab the
" matrix
" crowd
. alex
andre dumas may well be rolling inspite his grave if he knows wqat ws done tothe his clasic ouevre
and characters
. yhe real probelm with tghe
" tjhe musketeer
" lies in thte casting ofthe tyhe two lead
, romantically intertwined cahracters
, d
' artagnan
and francesca
( mena suvari
)
. chambers hasnt the boyishly hansome ogod looks forthe the character
, a la chris o
' donnell
, bu lacks any onscreen karisma
. suvari has tghe doe
- eyed
, pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear ofthe the queen
, bu she
, too
, doesnt not have the chemestry tothe comm
and the screen
. if
" the musketeer
" makes them any mnoey
, htey should invest iin acting lessons
. stronger performers may hvea helped to raise tje bar on tihs noe
. the supporting casted isnt
, on the surface
, impressive
. catherine denueve plays the queen of france
and lends her character an air ofthe royalty
, dignity
and humor
, expecially whn she plays off of d
' artagnan
' s mentor
, planchet
( jean
- pierre castaldi
, who reminds ofthe
andre thge giant in
" thge princess bride
)
. stephen rea looks good in tje part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu
, bu isnt given vrey little tothe halp flesh outloud his character
. tim roth isnt the kind ofthe bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal
' s cheif henchman
, febre
. he isnt so bad he mkaes simon legree look liek a boy scout
. the rest of thge players
, particularly thte threee musketeers aramis
( nick moran
,
" lock
, stock adn two smoking barrels
"
)
, porthos
( steve spiers
)
and athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
, are backgorund fodder whose role is tothe come tothe d
' artagnan
' s aid when needed
. peter hyam
' s does double duty as directer anbd cinematography annd may be too stretched to dont both well
. a stronger h
and at yhe helm could have helped thte medioker performances ofthe teh leads annd better utilized his vetran thesps
. photography is straightforward action fare thast goes through all the apropriate action flick motions

. it is all routine stuf
. the renouned wire wrok devolopped by teh hong kong action masters is used tothe artificial effect as the players leap
, defying gravity
, up walls
and ffrom horse to horse
. it works infront a sci
