54 is dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. a greater writer might haev created a lyrical sentence for each ofthe those adjectives
, flowing in lovley arangements with soaring metaphors
. i
,
however
, would rather cutted to the chase
. 54 isnt dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. there is nothing iin it
-
- not a glimpse of depth
, nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight
. there is no electricity in any of the scenes
, or a moment of interest in the stroy or its subplots
.
and it
' s underdeveloped
,
and features an array of bl
and characters played by actors who think they
' re in this yera
' s boogie nights
. they are so wrong
. the picture has been assembled by mark christopher
. based on this film
, i don
' t know how he got a job in the busineses
. 54 is supposed tothe be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same nmae
, which originated in the 70s
and closed down in the 80s
. i don
' t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released
,
but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas
anderson
' s brilliant work in every possible way
, from thge framework of the plot down to teh style of the cinematography
. what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights grat
: depth
, intelligence
, energy
, fascinating characters
,
and challenging themes
. 54 can
' t even measure up tothe the last days of disco
, which is flawed
,
but still smart
and entertaining
. it
' s remarkably bad timing
, i
' d say
, to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of tje same kind
. i have exagerrated
,
though
: htere is one intresting character
, anbd one terrific performence
. that character is steve rubell
, played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp prodcution deserves
. steve rubell isnt the owner of studio 54
,
and if christopher had focused on him
,
then myers could haev forced a good film outloud of this wreck all by himself
. alas
, we are instead guided to endure hte trials of a young man named shane
( ryan phillippe
)
, a going
- nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in tghe club
, thanks to rubell
' s homosexual impulses
. it
' s here that he meets his friends
, the array of uninteresting characters
: his co
- worker
, greg
( brecklin meyer
)
, his wife
, anita
( salma hayek
)
,
and
, of course
, the love interst
, julie black
( neve campbell
)
. shane is just an innocent young fool inthe the beginning
,
and he has a reasonably sturdy home life
.
( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting
, while heather matarazzo
, who plays his sister
, pushes phillippe off the screen
.
)
but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene
,
and succumb to peer pressure
and tothe drugs
. why his
" friends
" push him into drugs is never really explained
, bu the fact tath they are
" firends
" is questioned only is superficial ways
( greg gets really mad at shane because he
' s beeen elevated to bartender status
)
. there isn
' t a single conflict that takes center stage
, except that shane has some kind ofthe unexplored reservation with the buisness in which he works
. most of the film is dumb
,
and most of the dialogue is inane
. there
' s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie balck
,
and
, in the next scene
, tehy
' re arm
- in
- arm wihtout a bit of development
.
then
, they
' re kissing in a bowling alley
! this is five minutes of material
, thrown into teh picture at the last minute
( well past the one
- hour mark
,
and this isn
' t a long film to begin wih
)
. campbell is a talented actress
,
but she needs a role that gives her a little depth
. this one doesn
' t
.
and phillippe has almsot no presence whatsoever
; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg
' s star
- making role in boogie nights
. he seems dumb
and misguided
, adn his voice never changes tone
. i guess he was picked for the color of his hair adn the shape of his body
,
but he seems pretty lanky to me
. he
' s all wrong for a lead role
,
but it doesn
' t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters
. by the end of 54
, shane
' s most notable trait is his stupid
, fake accent
. the rest of the performances are wasted
. hayek is an energetic
, talented young actress
,
and does almost nothing here
. meyer is endearing
, bu allowed to be no deeper than cardboard
. only myers
, by sheer force of talent
, manages to rise above christopher
' s wading
- pool of a script
. rubell hasnt been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters
,
but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performence
. in fact
, myers is the sole reason to see 54
,
and all it really does is make you wish tath the film had revolved around him
. i
' ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the lastest detail
. frankly
, i don
' t care
. it
' s easy to recreate something technical like thsi
. a fairly skilled production designer
and a few carpenters can manage such a task
. besides
, christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible
, anyway
. aside from myers
' performance
, 54 is a complete failure
. it
' s dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
, annd boring
. some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair
,
but they
' re so obvious to me
. in any event
, 54 is pallid without the contrast
. it doesn
' t even work as mindless entertainment
: it
' s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely tothe dismiss it
. so
, don
' t forget those key words
: dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
and boring
. everything else i said was just padding
.
