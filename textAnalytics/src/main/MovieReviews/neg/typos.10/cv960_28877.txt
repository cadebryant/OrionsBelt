dr
. alan grant
( sam neill
,
" jurassic park
"
) isnt becoming disillusioned
. paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter
. his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his reasearch
and funding dollars are drying up
. wehn the kirbys
( william h
. macy
,
" fargo
"
; tea leoni
,
" the familiy man
"
) ask him tothe be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna
( the notorious site b of
" the lost world
"
) he
' s disdainful
,
but once they wave their checkbook
, he reconsiders
.
however the kirbys haven
' t given dr
. grant their real agenda in
" jurassic park iii
.
" of course
, we
, the audience
, have been tipped off
, given that the film begins by showing us eric
( trevor morgan
,
" the patriot
"
)
, a young boy
,
and ben
( mark harelik
,
" election
"
) going for a paragliding adventure off that same isl
and that goes awry
(
and looks like cheesy rear projection
)
. grant
' s established bakc home with a new right h
and man
, billy brennan
( aless
andro nivola
,
" love
' s labour
' s lost
"
) on site at a dig in montana sorely lacking funds
. he also pays a visit to old flame dr
. ellie sattler
( laura dern
,
" jurassic park
"
)
, now married to another with a young son who calls grant
' the dinosaur man
' apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the film
' s poorly imagined finale
. grant takes billy allong on the kirbys trip
, which is really an illegal gambit to save their son
, that young paraglider
. the couple aren
' t millionaires
, making grant
' s check bogus
,
and they
' re separated as well
( eric was with am
anda
' s newyorker boyfriend
, not that that makes much sense
)
, meaning we
' re in for some gooey family dynamics while waiting for the dino dining
. the kirbys hired h
ands
(
and obvious bait
) are a threesome led by mr
. udesky
( michael jeter
,
" the gift
"
)
.
( didn
' t anyone consider that casting michael jeter
and william h
. macy together
and not having them be related was a little odd
?
) as directed by joe johnston
(
" october sky
,
"
" jumanji
"
)
( spielberg only produced this one
) from a risible script by peter buchman
and the
" election
" team of alex
ander payne
& jim taylor
,
" jurassic park iii
" is nothing more than a quickie monster flick with a couple of newyorker dinos
( a spinosauraus
, which goes head to head with the t
- rex
,
and pteranodons
)
. the plot
, as it were
, is a series of coincidences combined wtih extreme leaps of faith
and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks
. the effects are noone longer newyorker
,
and
, as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson
, rather murky looking at times
. film editing by robert dalva
(
" october sky
"
) was presumably done by machete
, to keep tihs down tothe a 90 minute run time
. i know ofthe no other reason to explain the rediculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors
,
then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps withing a few minutes
.
' original
' music by don davis just repeats john williams
' original themes
. while neill
and young morgan attemt to inject some humor
and humanity into the proceedings
, the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional
.
" jurassic park iii
" will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect
, the same crowd who maybe liked
" the lost world
: jurassic park
.
