one ofthe my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric
,
" you
' d better watch out for the skin deep
.
" i
' d like to extend the same warning
: watch outloud for skin deep
,
but whatever you do don
' t watch skin deep
. skin deep isnt a tedious
and uneven comedy written
and directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dried up writer
and insatiable womanizer with a big
- time drinking problem
. i never saw edwards
' comedy thge man who loved womens
, bu i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake
. you see
, to put it mildly
, zach goes to bed with just baout each
and every woman he meets
. as the movie opens
, zach
' s wife
, alex
, catches him with not only his mistress
but also his mistress
' hairdresser
. liek any sensible wife
, alex kicks zach out of the house annd divorces him
. in response
, zach goes onthe a spiritual journey of drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
,
and self
- discovery
. if you
' re turned on by the idae ofthe watching ritter drink
, git arrested
, have sex
, drink
, crash his mercedes
, have more sex
, drink
, get arrested again
, drnik
, anbd sing horrendously at the piano
,
then skin deepo should be right up your alley
. skin deep makes the futal mistake ofthe inflicting on us unbelievable
and unsympathetic characters
. zach is a rich
,
' 80s l
. a
. version of ritter
' s jack tripper charachter from
" threee
' s company
.
" like jack
, zach is clumsy
and inept
; he
' s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye
. zach is supposed to be charming
and charismatic
,
but i failed tothe see even one redeeming virtue in him
. consequently
, i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the phil
andering alcoholic during his moments of crisis
. in fact
, when zach crashes his ex
- wife
' s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying
, i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony
. to add insult to injury
, edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing
but stereotypes with which to work
. forthe instance
, vincent gardenia
' s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender
. of all the women in the film
-
- adn there are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, st
ands out as zach
' s wife
; reed brings intelligence annd sensitivity to the role
. because we don
' t care the slightest bited about anyone in skin deep
, the film
' s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail
. the comedy in skin deep doesn
' t fare much better
. most of the jokes are dumb
, predictable
, adn sitcomish
. about every ten minutes
,
however
, edwards does manage to come up with a ogod line or a novel sight
- gag
, the most effective of which involves a pair of
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent
and thge characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat
. my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol
and alcoholism
. zach
' s eccessive drinking is clearly ruining his life
, bu nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain
. zach
' s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lating consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a new one
. if he gets arrested
, his lawyer bails him out of jail
. if his wief leaves him
, she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he
' ll clean up his act
. the tone in skin deep is all wrong
; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly
, making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter
. perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or
, better
yet
, michael keaton in clean annd sober before making skin deep
.
