starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie
,
though it took me a few days to conclude this
. the film is more masturbatory than bleak
, with its main character intent on confounding us wtih his stupidity
.
( he hasnt a
$ 6000 a week drug habit
.
) ultimately
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve
; you are less mystified by his self
- destructive nature than bored into a stupor youself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young author who arrives in l
. a
. with ambition
and a nasty drug habit
. he evenhtually gets a gig for
$ 5000
/ week writing for a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled st
and
- in for
" alf
"
: chompers looks just like alf except he
' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she can get a gren card
,
and hooks up with a spanish mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback
, with recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood restaurant
, where stiller works the drive
- thru as part of rehab
)
, taking him bakc to a hotel
,
and between bouts of serious screwing
, listening to his life story
. i
' ve spent the last week trying to figure outloud why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i
' ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none ofthe the charm or wit one would expect
( post
- there
' s something about mary
) ofthe either the actor or a comedy writer
. what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin next tothe a baby
! watch stahl spoil numberous pitch meetings with smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawess performance
: the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie
.
but permanent midnight is mostly soulless
. when teh movie poses the question will stahl be saved
?
and
then answers it in the form of bello
' s character
( basically a shrink in balck panties
)
, could a person care less
? in the film version of his authobiography of the same name
, stahl doesn
' t need saving
, he needs someone who wiull sit there
and listen to him go onthe about himself
. if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie
, it
' s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood
- types known to man
.
( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs
. is this hollywood
.
.
. california
?
) i learned very little baout tyhe entertainment business from permanent midnight
and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead
. of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems
. so
, basically
, his drug habit got him a book deal
, a movie based on his life
,
and now he
' s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects
. so much for the moral of that story
. temperary midnight is moreso like it
